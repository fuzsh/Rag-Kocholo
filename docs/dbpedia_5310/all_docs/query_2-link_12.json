        "text": "There is no single cannabis brand as well-known Cookies. It has dispensaries, lounges, and lifestyle stores in 4 countries, 17 markets both medical and recreational, with a total of 40 storefronts. Cookies was named one of America's Hottest Brands of 2021 by AdAge, and was the only cannabis company to make the cut.\n\nCookies will be the exclusive home to the Wiz Khalifa cannabis brand called Khalifa Kush, which launches on Friday, January 28, 2022, at the Cookies Maywood location. Khalifa Kush has been available on the Nevada marketplace for a while now, but has been highly anticipated to enter California’s market. Wiz Khalifa will make an appearance as a “guest budtender” for its launch at Cookies Maywood, so it’s sure to be a scene. Cookies storefronts across the state of California will carry Khalifa Kush beginning on Saturday, January 29, 2022.\n\nThe very first Cookies storefront in Canada is launching this weekend. Cookies Toronto is the brand’s flagship in our northern neighbors, through a partnership with Gage Cannabis. The brand is constantly making moves, thanks to its founder, Berner. Since 2010, the entrepreneur and rapper built the brand from humble beginnings in the Bay Area to a worldwide lifestyle brand. One of his co-founders and original Cookies Fam grower Jai is among the most prolific geneticists in the state. Some of Cookies most popular strains grown today include Cereal Milk, Gary Payton, Pancakes, Grenadine, London Pound Cake, and Sweet Rozay.\n\nI spoke with Berner on the exclusive launch of the Khalifa Kush brand at Cookies in California, Berner and Khalifa’s longstanding friendship that evolved into a cannabis partnership, his excitement for new locations across the world, and how he’s healing with cannabis as he goes through chemotherapy treatments.\n\nFirst off, how are you? I know you’ve been going through treatment for cancer and I am so blown away by your courage, sheer strength, and honesty on social going through chemotherapy.\n\nBerner: I’m feeling a lot better, yesterday and the day before were extremely tough. I’m learning the way the chemotherapy cycles work, day 7, 8, 9, are usually not your friend. That’s when your white blood cell count is super low. Today I woke up feeling good, I’m positive. Just blessed.\n\nHas cannabis helped in your healing process with the chemo treatment? How has your relationship with weed changed and evolved?\n\nAppreciating still, no matter how recreational it is, how much of a medicine it is. How much it really brings people together. I was watching this crazy clip of my journey to Jamaica with Damian Marley, reflecting on how weed really brings people together. As I get older, I’ve been working with this plant for 20, 21 years now, I am really excited to still see that it is still doing what it’s supposed to do. Healing, helping people, uniting people.\n\nThis Khalifa Kush partnership launch in California is amazing, congrats. How long have you been partners or cannabis collaborators with Wiz?\n\nI go way back with Wiz. Our friendship developed off of weed, which again, I’m grateful for. It brings people together from all different walks of life. We’ve been down with each other for a while now, I think I met him in 2009. We bonded over the herb right away. His brand launching in California has been a long time coming. He took his time, and didn’t rush anything.\n\nDoes Wiz Khalifa’s brand align with Cookies?\n\nIt just aligns through our friendship, bond, and history. I remember when I first brought Wiz his batch of Khalifa Kush back in the day, and we named it KK because that was his. He found a kush that he liked from the Bay area, it was my job to always make sure he had it. I would drop everything I was doing to make sure he got his KK in a timely fashion. He said, ‘this is mine, I love this shit.’ I would write KK on the bag. Through history, a long time of being smoking buddies, it just aligns perfectly.\n\nI saw a Cookies opening in Toronto this weekend, congrats. How many countries is the Cookies brand in? How does it feel to be an international cannabis brand.\n\nIt’s absolutely crazy, it’s mind-blowing, I can’t even believe it. One person from San Francisco was able to touch the whole world through cannabis, music, and clothing. It’s pretty humbling. It actually makes what I’m going through a little easier. God forbid something goes the wrong way, at least I know I did something that people dream of, right? I believe we’re in 4 countries. Canada is a super important one for us so I couldn’t be more proud about that.\n\nBecause of COVID, I actually still haven’t been able to go visit our Barcelona location. Right when Barcelona opened up, that’s when they locked down Spain, Spain had its issues. I dream every day about going to my lounge in Barcelona, getting a milkshake, smoking a blunt with some people from Ireland. International stoner vibes.\n\nDo you have your sights set on another city/country for 2022 that you can hint to the Forbes readers?\n\nYeah, the U.K. Slowly but surely, they’re moving forward. We’ll probably have to start off with a CBD lifestyle store, that turns into a medical pharmacy type vibe, that turns into a recreational store. We’re planning for that for sure. New York’s going to be dope, as well, I am super excited about New York.\n\nI saw you’re on this amazing lineup for The Smoker’s Club Fest in April. How does it feel to be performing/back on stage after the last few years?\n\nHell yeah, I did some performances recently after COVID. I did my companies Christmas party, I did Rolling Loud, I did some shows in LA. I did some pretty big festivals. It felt great. The Smoker’s Club Fest is going to be a good time. You got Wiz on there, it’s a super powerful lineup. You got Kid Cudi, ASAP Rocky, to be along those names, it will be great. Especially getting done with chemo therapy, along the end of March, April. It’ll probably be my first show in a while so I can’t fucking wait.\n\nMusic and weed: does cannabis help your creativity and flow when writing new music?\n\nYeah, if you ever look at any of the studio footage from my sessions, or any of the collaborative albums we do, you’ll see there’s more weed in that room than anything. Hundreds of jars, all different flavors. When I did that collaboration album with Curren$y, we looked at the ashtray one night, there were 33 roaches in the ashtray, we thought fuck, this is crazy. We got so high, we don’t remember making that album, and it ended up one of our best.\n\nWe smoke one strain that gets your heart pounding super hard, it changes the mood. By the end of the night, you get burnt out, so we relax, smoke something with a bit deeper vibes. It takes more time for me to pack my weed than anything else: stuff to give away to people who want bud, the stuff I’m not willing to give away, tips, papers, grinders, it helps the creativity so much. All the artists love it, I love it because they get to experience something they’ve never experienced.\n\nDo you have a favorite strain (Cookies, or Khalifa Kush) that you like to smoke right now\n\nMy favorite strain from Cookies right now is the Bernie Hana Butter. It’s tasty, strong, euphoric, it smells good in the air. It’s a really refreshing high. I love that. My favorite strain from the Khalifa Kush company is the collaboration we have together called Baby Powder, it’s supposed to come out in April, I may push a little bit to get it out before, but it’s strong as hell. We had a great time naming it, we laughed our asses off. When Mike Eps smacks that dude in the movie that nug is as frosty. The nug looked like it was covered in baby powder.\n\nWhen you go to Benihana, I hear people say ‘extra garlic butter.’ First, I called it Benihana Butter, someone hit me on the phone saying they got that name so I just changed it to Bernie Hana Butter."
