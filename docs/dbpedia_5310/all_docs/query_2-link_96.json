        "text": "This cover story is part of Hip-Hop Is Life, a series of profiles and features that revisit key moments in the intersection of hip-hop and Black men’s health over the last 50 years. Read the rest of the stories here.\n\nWHEN WIZ KHALIFA broke through with his number-one hit “Black and Yellow” in 2010, the Pittsburgh rapper was a stringy six-four and 140 pounds. Over the next few years, he earned more fans with soulful feel-good songs like “See You Again” and “Young, Wild & Free” and his wholehearted embrace of cannabis.\n\nKhalifa, born Cameron Jibril Thomaz, created his own weed brand, Khalifa Kush, in 2015 and turned it into a growing empire in and outside of hip-hop. Now 35, Khalifa has taken an active interest in martial arts since 2017, working with Muay Thai and mixed martial arts trainers to pack on muscle: He’s now 175 pounds. The opposite of a lazy stoner, Khalifa gets up at 6:00 A.M. most days, takes his son to school, and then hits the gym. He focuses on a different muscle group every day but the regimen stays the same: one hour of weights, one hour of MMA. That strength helps him perform better. MH caught up with the Khalifa to talk hip hop and health.\n\nMen's Health: What hip hop artists inspired you over the years? Do you have a favorite hip hop song or album?\n\nWiz Khalifa: Tyler the Creator. I like his music visuals and the all around direction of his art.\n\nWhen you think of hip-hop health, what other artists come to mind for you and why?\n\nLL Cool J. Method Man. Melle Mel. Couple dudes who take their physique serious.\n\nWhat’s your favorite hip-hop health song or piece of health advice you got from a rap song?\n\nNone really! LOL.\n\nYou’ve been rapping for nearly 20 years at this point. What inspires you as a rapper as you get older?\n\nAdding to sauce creatively. I love to create, so just the act of doing something new inspires me.\n\nWhen did your health journey first start?\n\nSix years ago.\n\nGrowing up as a Black boy, did anybody in your family impart how important fitness was?\n\nWe always played sports and I had natural athleticism but being in the gym wasn’t something that was regular until I got older.\n\nWalk us through a typical day at the gym for you. How often do you work out? What’s your favorite workout?\n\nNormal day I wake up at 6 A.M., eat breakfast, take my son to school, then hit the gym. We do different muscle groups every day, so I do weight training for an hour, then mixed martial arts for another hour. Afterwards I stretch, and then I like to have a protein shake and smoke a fat-ass joint.\n\nHow has all this working out and eating impacted your shows?\n\nI look buff as hell on stage. I always had good energy—now my body looks amazing.\n\nDo you feel like it’s helped you become a better performer?\n\nI was always a dope performer so naw, working out hasn’t really changed that.\n\nWhat advice do you have for Black men looking to get into health and fitness?\n\nExercise definitely helps me focus, slow things down, work on the smaller things, and be more patient. And when I have injuries, smoking puts my mind in a good place to heal the right spots and get better.\n\nIs using marijuana part of your wellness/mental-health practice?\n\nFor sure. It’s more acceptable and not seen as something that will slow you down or make you lazy. You still have people who believe that but you also have people like me to end that stereotype, so it’s more balanced.\n\nYou're a father, businessman, son, and musician. Rank those four in terms of importance to you and your life?\n\nFather first. Everything else can go wherever it wants.\n\nWho are your heroes?\n\nI don’t have any heroes. My biggest inspirations are my dad, my son, and myself.\n\nWhat contributions to the world do you think are uniquely hip-hop?\n\nStyle of dress, words, attitude, fun, and an open expression of yourself.\n\nWhat could hip-hop do better?\n\nAllow our artists to age gracefully.\n\nA version of this story appeared in the September 2023 issue of Men's Health.\n\nAll shoots and interviews for this cover were conducted prior the SAG-AFTRA strike."
