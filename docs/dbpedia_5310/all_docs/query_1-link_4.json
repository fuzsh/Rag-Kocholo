        "text": "Juicy J and Wiz Khalifa connect once again to share a song off their upcoming joint album featuring Project Pat.\n\n“Backseat” which comes with an electrifying video, is the latest exciting single Juicy and Wiz have released as they prepare to drop their collab album sometime in February. With Pat making a special appearance to deliver some bars of his own, the visuals reflect the lyrics that both he and Khalifa passionately deliver over the creative Juicy J production. Prior to this single, the duo released “Pop That Trunk” in December, which also came with a unique, funny video. That one and “Backseat” were both directed by Video God.\n\nThe upcoming collab album marks Juicy J and Wiz Khalifa reuniting after joining forces on “Gah Damn High” off The Hustle Continues in 2020. The comradery that Khalifa and Juicy J share is something that the Taylor Gang rapper wishes more artists had.\n\nIn December, Wiz took to Twitter to implore his fellow rappers to show more love to one another going into 2022.\n\n“As enternainers lets try some shit next year,” Khalifa wrote. “Minding our own business. Not dis respecting each others family, dead homies, or area they come from. Stop using someone else’s significant other as a one up to the other person. Actually showing the same love you expect to get.”\n\nWatch Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J’s new video “Backseat” featuring Project Pat up top, and stream it with Spotify here:"
