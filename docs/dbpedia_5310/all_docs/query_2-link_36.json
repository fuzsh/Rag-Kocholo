        "text": "Criminal proceedings have been launched against rapper Wiz Khalifa after he allegedly smoked a cannabis joint onstage at a concert in Romania.\n\nThe country’s special directorate for organized crime and terrorism did not name the musician, but said in a statement Sunday that criminal proceedings were launched against a U.S. citizen, who was being investigated for “unlawful possession of drugs.”\n\nThe statement said that the suspect consumed the drug on stage in the form of a “craft cigarette” at a music festival in the Black Sea resort town of Costinești. The statement said that the suspect was also found to be in possession of more than 18 grams of cannabis.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Khalifa, whose real name is Cameron Jibril Thomaz, appeared to admit that he had lit up.\n\nThe 36-year-old wrote that he “didn’t mean any disrespect to the country of Romania by lighting up on stage.”\n\n“They were very respectful and let me go,” he wrote. “I’ll be back soon. But without a big a** joint next time.”\n\nKhalifa, who often references cannabis in his song lyrics and appears on social media smoking joints, was performing at the Beach Please! Festival in Costinești. The festival’s Instagram page shared videos of his performance over the weekend.\n\nThe rapper previously admitted on X that he was going to “get stoned” before he threw the first pitch at a game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cleveland Guardians last July. “Shroomed out throwin a baseball is crazy,” he later wrote after the event at PNC Park in Pennsylvania.\n\nRomanian authorities did not say whether Khalifa had been detained or charged in connection with what the statement called a “risk drug,” but recreational use of cannabis is illegal in Romania.\n\nThe investigation was ongoing, the statement said.\n\nKhalifa later posted a video on Instagram of him smoking something in Paris with the Eiffel Tower sparkling in the distance and fireworks going off."
