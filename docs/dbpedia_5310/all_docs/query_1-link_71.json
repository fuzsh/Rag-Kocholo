        "text": "Producer, songwriter, record executive, and entrepreneur Juicy J quickly learned early in life that he could only make financial gains when there were risks involved.\n\nHis most recent investment with the marketing titan Gary Vaynerchuk, Cody Hudson, and the creative magic of Green St. Agency taps into one of cannabis’s largest markets: Los Angeles.\n\nThe sound, tempo, lyricism, and tone of hip-hop was profoundly influenced by Juicy J’s veteran hip-hop group Three 6 Mafia, culminating in widespread success and an Academy Award win for “It's Hard out Here for a Pimp”—the theme song to 2005’s Hustle & Flow. As a solo artist, Juicy J strategically chose to collaborate with pop singers, including Usher, Miley Cyrus, and Katy Perry—who created the track “Dark Horse” with Juicy J, which spent four weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014.\n\nJuicy J is barely getting started. His solo album, The Hustle Continues, is due for release on November 27 and features an all-star lineup including Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Baby, A$AP Rocky, Logic, Ty Dolla $ign, 2 Chainz, and more. The new album’s first two singles, “Load It Up” feat. NLE Choppa and “Gah Damn High” feat. Wiz Khalifa are both focused on cannabis—his next big venture. Juicy J shared his vision with cannabis brand Asterisk* and his first two strains: Wildflower and Mystic Potion.\n\nBenjamin Adams: You launched a cannabis brand Asterisk* a few months ago. Why did you choose to work with Gary Vaynerchuk?\n\nJuicy J: Gary [Vaynerchuk] is a genius. Everything he touches turns to gold. He’s a great guy. He’s exactly like me: he hustles. He works 24/7, I work 24/7, and you know, when we met, we was on the same page. It’s a no-brainer. He’s real smart. If there was any other investment that he’d want to put me in, I’d definitely jump in. And why not? You know what I’m saying? The cannabis movement is growing and growing and getting big. I just heard that Jay-Z just jumped in. In the next two or three years, everybody is going to be smoking weed across the world. Weed is going to be legal everywhere. So it’s just a no-brainer. Why not? Gary is a genius. I had to partner up with him. I smoke a lot of weed, so why not sell it?\n\nAdams: Where is Asterisk* flower available at?\n\nJuicy J: We just started this. We’re doing some exclusive things in Los Angeles, California. We’re about to branch out into the whole world. It’s about to go crazy. We would’ve done it soon, but due to this pandemic that hit, everything slowed down. We about to take over. This is going to be the number one weed company in the world, man. It’s going to go down.\n\nAdams: Your investment portfolio includes a massive deal with Keurig Dr Pepper and an investment with Epic Games. You’ve often described that your hustle ethic started at a much younger age. Is that true?\n\nJuicy J: I started investing in real estate and publishing companies. Stuff like that. I’ve been successful with it. So when I got these opportunities, investing in these other big companies. Why not? I got money invested in this water company called Zen Water. I’m invested in this company called Turo. As for Keurig, and Epic Games, I just jumped on it. It’s something different than real estate, but I just, you know, like to take risks. Life is all about taking risks—and that’s what I do. Usually when I take those risks, 90 percent is going to come back great.\n\nAdams: I assume that’s something you learned long ago with Three 6 Mafia.\n\nJuicy J: Yes. From investing in property and land. That’s what I did at an early age. I bought land, property, and homes. Just like that. I even bought and flipped cars. I would buy a couple cars, fix them up, and flip ‘em. Stuff like that.\n\nAdams: You have an indoor arena concert scheduled for December 11, for the first time since lockdown. Are you excited for a normal show, given that the entertainment industry was devastated by the pandemic?\n\nJuicy J: Yes. First time since lockdown. It’s a Three 6 Mafia concert, I get to perform with all of the legendary members of the group. I’m excited about that. It’s going to be a crazy concert. There’s a lot of social distancing [measures] we gotta do, you know, in order to be safe. I’m excited to get back on the road and jump back onstage with the guys.\n\nAdams: “Gah Damn High” is pretty straightforward. From what I understand you are close with Wiz, and own a portion of his company Taylor Gang?\n\nJuicy J: Yeah yeah. I’m a third-owner of Taylor Gang. And me and Wiz? We go way back. I met him on Twitter and we’ve become the best of friends. We started cooking from there, you know, making records. Every time we do a record together—it just goes crazy. We got a project. We got an album coming out—me and Wiz Khalifa. We haven’t named it yet, but I produced it. The whole project. It’s going to be dope. It’s crazy. We’ve already done like over 20 songs. I can’t wait to drop it. The final [release] is dropping in February. It’s a dope project. Juicy J and Wiz Khalifa. Produced by Juicy J. It’s crazy.\n\nAdams: Tell us about your signature strain Wildflower. Do you wish to share the strain’s parent stains?\n\nJuicy J: I came up with the name. I went through a couple of different weed strains. I feel like the name ‘Wildflower” and the strain I chose for it, is just like, It makes you feel like you’re in a flower patch. You’re super high. You’re seeing colors, and stuff like that. Because when I smoke that weed, I feel like I like to go smoke by the flowers. In the nature. I have flowers around my house. And I got this other one called Mystic Potion. It just puts you in this mysterious mystic vibe, especially when you’re in the studio, working on some music. So I kind of just come up with the names of the strains, and the vibes that go along with them. If I’m outside, in the car, smoking weed, going through different strains and naming it. I find that vibe where I’m at. So Wildflower is really good. Mystic Potion is really good and selling out everywhere. Right now, you can go get it in the biggest dispensary in LA—it’s called MMD. It’s probably sold out. Everything I drop sells out. So, we dropped some exclusive pieces, and now we’re going to take over the world.\n\nAdams: There is quite a bit of hype about your solo album The Hustle Continues. How would you describe this album?\n\nJuicy J: I produced it myself. On a lot of my other albums, I’ll just produce a track here and there, but this album is 100 percent produced by me. I got a couple of producers, you know, here and there. But it’s 98 percent me at the end of the day. I produced it 100 percent, because I work on every track. I’ll bring in people to co-produce one or two tracks—not that many—but its 100 percent produced by me. I had fun with this one. I took it back to the old Three 6 Mafia sound with the new-new. I enjoyed myself putting this album together. You’ll see. It’s crazy. I ain’t playing no games with this one.\n\nAdams: You’ve seen enormous success by linking up with pop stars like Usher, Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus.\n\nYears ago when I won an Academy Award, with Three 6 Mafia—I felt like I could do anything after that. We came from a small city, with a lot of poverty. An unknown city, and there was not a lot of people checking for rap at the time, in Memphis. Going straight from the underground to winning an Academy Award. We had never won anything. We jumped all of the other awards, because it was the biggest award you could possibly win, which is an Academy Award. At the time, I thought after we won that award—in my heart—that I could do anything. I could make pop music, I could do rock music. I started producing rock music and doing all kinds of stuff. I just started producing. I started getting my rap game up better. I felt like I could get more lyrical. And I’m a producer. Look—when you’re a producer, like me, I just feel like I can do anything right now. I could bring any project to me, and I could do it, whether it’s a rock n’ roll song, whether it’s a pop song, it don’t even matter, because I listen to all kinds of music. I listen to classical music, I listen to everything. So it’s no problem for me.\n\nAdams: Under Three 6 Mafia, you won an Academy Award in 2006—very few performers can say that. Where do you keep that Oscar at?\n\nJuicy J: I keep it at the crib. I used to keep it in a big ass safe. I wouldn’t let nobody touch it. “Nobody can touch it!” I used to keep it in a safe, but now it’s just chilling at the crib.\n\nAdams: Given that you co-founded Three 6 Mafia in ‘91, it’s safe to say you’re a pioneer in the development of hip-hop. Do you accept that title?\n\nJuicy J: Yeah, man. I appreciate it. I see it as a group that saved hip-hop. I feel like that if you listen to everybody’s beat, everybody’s flow, it’s Three 6 Mafia. I think that’s a blessing because you know, at the end of the day, we didn’t know what we had. We were just making music. It was fun, it was organic, and everything was natural. We never knew that 25 or 30 years later, the music would still be bigger than what it was back in the day. It was big back in the day, but it was not as big as it is now. Now it’s like Three Six Mafia is a household name. Everything is going up. The album sales are going up, the show are going up, people want to pay crazy amounts of money to get us to perform. The merchandise is crazy. I never thought that it would get to that point, you know what I’m saying? So it’s a blessing to be kings of the rap business.\n\nAdams: Do you have any shout-outs?\n\nJuicy J: I got this dope kid that I found out of Boston. He’s 21 years old. His name is Henry AZ. He’s an amazing kid. I signed him, when he was like 18 years old. I’ve just been working with him, and you know, in artist development. He’s been dropping albums, so you should go check his albums out. It’s on all streaming services. His name is Henry AZ. He’s a dope MC, man. He’s got straight bars. I think he’s going to be the next biggest thing—no, I know he’s going to be the next biggest thing. I don’t play no games when it comes to music. I can do this in my sleep."
