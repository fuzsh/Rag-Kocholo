        "text": "As a member of the Memphis group Three 6 Mafia, the rapper Juicy J memorably collected an Oscar in 2006, for “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp.” And his career has continued to follow a series of unexpected turns, from occasional actor to Twitter star (more than one million followers) to, lately, solo artist. On the heels of the platinum single “Bandz a Make Her Dance,” featuring Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz, his third solo album and major label debut, “Stay Trippy,” was released late last month on Kemosabe/Columbia Records. A few years ago, he had never performed onstage alone; now he is completing a sold-out, 40-city tour.\n\n“The solo thing just happened out of nowhere,” he said, by telephone from Los Angeles, where he had just landed after a concert in Las Vegas. “I wasn’t really planning to be a solo artist. I was trying to bring back the Three 6 Mafia buzz, so I was doing my own mixtapes. I put out ‘Bandz a Make Her Dance’ on Twitter, and then it blew up, and here I am.”\n\nAt 35, Juicy J is a hip-hop veteran, a foundation of the Southern rap scene and a mentor to younger rappers like Wiz Khalifa, a producer on “Stay Trippy.” “I met Wiz on Twitter,” Juicy J said. “I had listened to his mixtapes, watched his stuff on YouTube, and then I reached out to him on Twitter. We exchanged numbers, then we met up in California and became best friends.”\n\nJuicy J raps about strip clubs, smoking pot and boozing — and he’s authentic to the lifestyle. “I’m still drunk,” he announced in the early-morning phone call. He wasn’t apologizing or boasting, just acknowledging: “This is the life. This is what I chose.” But it didn’t stop him from talking seriously about his ambitions. As for where he keeps his Oscar, he said: “I keep it in a safe. I definitely got it.” He spoke with Melena Ryzik about his work ethic, rapping with his brother and why he still listens to demos. These are excerpts from the conversation."
