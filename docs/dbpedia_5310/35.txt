During a recent interview, Wiz Khalifa discussed the Taylor Gang signing of Three 6 Mafia’s Juicy J. The signing, Wiz said, was one that needed to happen to bridge the gap between them. Khalifa also reflected on what has made him such a fan of J.

“Well, I’ve always been a huge fan of Juicy J and Three 6 Mafia and what they brought to the game,” he explained to MTV. “As far as their music, as far as their consistency, as far as just if you’re in that mood and you know what you wanna hear, they brought it and I respected that. And they brought it for years, since I was young.”

For Wiz, the respect comes from being younger, watching Three 6 Mafia gain success and notoriety in the culture. He also reminisced about hearing Three 6 songs for the first time.

“I remember when ‘Tear da Club Up’ first came out and I remember when ‘Stay Fly’ came out, and those are two huge songs from the same group of people who never fell off or lost it at all. And I really look up to that and respect that.”

Knowing that Juicy J was also a fan of his, Wiz explained that a collaborative spirit was in the air.

“It was like, ‘Man we might as well bridge the gap and takeover,’ because he’s gonna be here forever and I’m gonna be here forever.”
