Lil Peep's 'Got Em Like,' featuring Wiz Khalifa and Juicy J, is a vivid portrayal of a night filled with hedonistic pleasures and rebellious attitudes. The song's lyrics revolve around themes of excess, indulgence, and a carefree lifestyle, capturing the essence of a wild night out. The repeated chorus, 'This gon' be a wild night,' sets the tone for the entire track, emphasizing the anticipation and excitement of the night's events.

Wiz Khalifa's verses highlight the indulgence in substances and the camaraderie of his clique. His lines, 'I just smoked a whole damn zip' and 'I came with my whole damn clique,' underscore the collective experience of partying and the bond shared among friends. The imagery of riding in a car, blowing smoke, and the desire to rule the world reflects a sense of invincibility and freedom that comes with living in the moment.

Juicy J's contribution adds another layer of extravagance and bravado. His references to wealth, such as 'brand new Rollie, bust it down,' and his dismissive attitude towards those who imitate his style, 'all these niggas bitin' off the Three Six sound,' reinforce his status and confidence. The explicit content and provocative language further amplify the rebellious and unapologetic nature of the song.

Lil Peep's verse brings a darker, more introspective element to the track. His lines, 'Life fucked up, Lil Peep poppin' beans' and 'droppin' candy in my lean,' hint at the struggles and coping mechanisms that often accompany a life of excess. The mention of GothBoiClique and the goth aesthetic adds a unique twist, blending elements of emo and hip-hop culture. Peep's raw and honest delivery provides a stark contrast to the otherwise celebratory tone, reminding listeners of the underlying pain and turmoil that can exist beneath the surface of a wild night out.
