        "text": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Two teens were killed and one other was injured in an overnight shooting in southwest Atlanta.\n\nThe Atlanta Police Department says they received a call about a person shot at 1043 Sparks Street SW Tuesday around 12:45 a.m. When officers arrived at the scene, they located three teenagers - a 14-year-old, a 13-year-old and a 12-year-old - with gunshot wounds.\n\nPolice say one of the teens died at the scene and another died at the hospital. The 12-year-old was taken to the hospital in stable condition and is expected to recover.\n\nThe Fulton County Medical Examiner has identified the victims as Jakody Davis, 13, and Lamon Freeman, 13. However, Freeman’s family told Atlanta News First at the scene that he was celebrating his 14th birthday on Tuesday.\n\n“He loved to bike. Loved to be outside. Go on bike rides, be outside. Ride around the neighborhood and stuff like that,” said Desree Barber, victim’s cousin.\n\nPolice say the shooting took place in the stairwell of an apartment building in Atlanta’s Oakland City neighborhood.\n\nInvestigators have not provided a suspect description at this time and are still looking for a motive.\n\n“This family is a family-oriented people. This is not the first time this has happened here at her place and I’m pretty sure this is not the last time it’s going to happen,” said Tiwana McCoy, victim’s cousin. “Now it’s just a different scenario because it took her son from her. It’s gotten a little more personal.”\n\nDebra Daniels, who lives at the apartment complex, said gunshots went through her home.\n\n“I’ve had a bullet come though my grandbaby window. I’ve had a bullet come through my door these were innocent bystanders we are not getting no help no justice,” she said.\n\nDaniels said the apartment complex is plagued with crime.\n\n“We need help I want the mayor and everybody else come out here and please help us,” Daniels said.\n\nCity leaders responded Tuesday.\n\nCouncil member Julian Bond said the Atlanta Police Department will be taking action.\n\n“The police department is going to do a newly tooled focused on this particular property and the area in general,” he said.\n\nBond said they also need the community’s help.\n\n“We want people to be involved, tell us where they need the service, where we can apply our resources to better help and serve them. We don’t want to just respond when there is a tragedy,” Bond said.\n\n“I am deeply saddened by the tragic shooting that occurred last night in Oakland City. Two young lives were lost because of gun violence, and another young soul was critically injured. The ages of all three victims range from 12 to 14 years old, underscoring the senselessness of this act. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of the victims during this challenging time,” Jason Dozier, Atlanta City Council District 4 representative, said in a statement. “I have been in communication with the Atlanta Police Department, the school social worker, community representatives, and the City of Atlanta’s Office of Violence Reduction to ensure that we are doing everything possible to support those affected by this senseless act of violence. We are working collaboratively to provide resources and assistance to the victims’ families, as well as to the broader community that this event has deeply shaken.”\n\n“The safety and well-being of our residents, especially our young people, are paramount, and this tragic incident underscores the urgent need to address the root causes of gun violence in our communities. The City of Atlanta is committed to working tirelessly to implement effective violence reduction strategies, increase community engagement, and provide the necessary support to prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future.”\n\nAnyone with information on the case can submit a tip anonymously to the Crime Stoppers Atlanta tip line at 404-577-TIPS (8477), online www.StopCrimeAtl.org, or by texting CSA and the tip to CRIMES (274637). Tips can also be submitted directly to the Atlanta Police Department’s Homicide Unit at (404) 546-4235. Persons do not have to give their name or any identifying information to be eligible for the reward of up to $10,000."
