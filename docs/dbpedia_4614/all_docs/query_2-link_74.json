        "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — The West Palm Beach Police Department (WPBPD) is investigating a shooting at the 1000 block of State Street. Gunfire occurred at 4:14 p.m. Tuesday evening.\n\nWPBPD Public Information Officer Mike Jachles says officers heard gunshots a block away from their National Night Out event and rushed over. The event is meant to promote police-community partnerships and camaraderie.\n\nOfficers have located a nearby vehicle and it was detained. They say a 23-year-old man from Riviera Beach and 31-year-old woman from Lake Park are being investigated and are claiming self defense.\n\nPolice say A 39-year-old victim was shot in the right leg and left arm and an officer assisted the victim with tourniquets. The victim was then taken to St. Mary’s trauma center and is in serious condition. Officers add he is not cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nJachles says this is an isolated & targeted incident. Officers add the 3 individuals involved in the gunfire know to each other through previous relationships. No one has been charged.\n\nThe West Palm Beach National Night Out event is happening at 18th and Tamarind until 10 p.m.\n\nAt the family-friendly, free National Night Out event, back-to-school backpacks will be given away and kids can play in a bounce house, and families can enjoy food and dance to a D.J.\n\nNational Night Out began in 1984 in the western suburbs of Philadelphia, PA. In four decades of NNO, 38 million neighbors have participated in 17,000 communities around the United States."
