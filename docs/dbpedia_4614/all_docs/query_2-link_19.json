        "text": "Minimum age laws prevent young people and those around them from falling prey to preventable gun violence and suicide.\n\nPurchasing and possessing a lethal weapon is a serious responsibility and one that should not be taken lightly. Our country sets minimum ages for driving, voting, and drinking alcohol to encourage responsible behavior. Because young adults are at elevated risk of attempting suicide and engaging in violent behaviors, strengthening minimum age laws for purchasing and possessing guns will help protect young people and the public at large.\n\nBackground\n\nThe parts of the brain responsible for impulse control, judgement, and long-range planning are among the last areas of the brain to fully mature, and in fact, may continue to develop until at least age 26.\n\nThe developing brains of adolescents and young adults may put them at higher risk of making risky decisions. Hormonal changes can have significant effects on self-control, decision making, emotions, risk-taking behaviors, and aggressive impulses.\n\nThe biological processes that take place during late adolescence and young adulthood can predispose individuals to riskier and more aggressive behaviors.\n\nA study of offenders incarcerated for crimes committed with firearms found that 17% of offenders would have been prohibited from buying a gun if their state had a law that raised the minimum age to possess a handgun to 21 years.\n\nPeople ages 18 to 20 are responsible for a disproportionate share of school shootings, public mass shootings, and gun homicides overall. In fact, 18-20 year olds comprise just 4% of the US population, but account for 17% of known gun homicide offenders.\n\nData also suggests that young people disproportionately commit gun homicides. For example, 18-20-year olds comprise just 4% of the US population, but account for 17% of known homicide offenders.\n\nBecause impulse regulation and emotional control continues to develop into the mid-20s, young people, including adolescents and people under age 21, are at elevated risk of attempting suicide.\n\nSuicide risk is often much higher in the early stages of the onset of major psychiatric conditions, and these symptoms usually first develop in adolescence or early adulthood.\n\nSuicide attempts that result in death or hospital treatment peak at age 16, but are at the highest rates from age 14 through age 21.\n\nGun access can significantly increase these risks. The association between firearm availability and suicide is strongest among adolescents and young adults.\n\nLaws that prohibit unsupervised possession or purchase of firearms by children and young people can reduce harm among people under age 21.\n\nOne study found that state laws raising the minimum legal age to purchase firearms to 21 years were associated with a twelve percent decline in rates of firearm suicides among 18-to-20-year-olds.\n\nAnother study found that when Washington State passed a law setting a minimum age to purchase assault weapons, there were significant decreases in the number of firearm incidents with assault weapons by this group, as well as an overall decrease in firearm violence in the state.\n\nControlling for other factors, unintentional firearm deaths and firearm suicides among youth (ages 0-19) also fell after the federal minimum age law was enacted.\n\nSUPPORT GUN SAFETY\n\nWe’re in this together. To build a safer America—one where children and parents in every neighborhood can learn, play, work, and worship without fear of gun violence—we need you standing beside us in this fight.\n\nAs described below, federal law and the laws in most states continue to allow unsupervised access to firearms by individuals under age 21. Additional information about laws preventing child access to firearms is included in our summary on Child Access Prevention.\n\nSummary of Federal Law\n\nFederal law in this area distinguishes between long guns (rifles and shotguns) and handguns, and between gun possession and gun sales. Federal law also provides stronger age restrictions for sales by licensed gun sellers.\n\nFederal Minimum Age for Gun Sales and Transfers\n\nHandguns\n\nLicensed firearms dealers may not sell or deliver a handgun or ammunition for a handgun to any person the dealer has reasonable cause to believe is under age 21.\n\nUnlicensed persons may not sell, deliver or otherwise transfer a handgun or handgun ammunition to any person the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is under age 18, with certain exceptions.*\n\nLong Guns (Rifles and Shotguns)\n\nLicensed firearms dealers may not sell or deliver a long gun, or ammunition for a long gun, to any person the dealer knows or has reasonable cause to believe is under age 18.\n\nUnlicensed persons may sell, deliver, or otherwise transfer a long gun or long gun ammunition to a person of any age.\n\nMinimum Age for Gun Possession: Subject to limited exceptions*, federal law prohibits the possession of a handgun or handgun ammunition by any person under the age of 18., Federal law provides no minimum age for the possession of long guns or long gun ammunition.\n\n*Exceptions: Federal law provides exceptions for the temporary transfer and possession of handguns and handgun ammunition for specified activities, including employment, ranching, farming, target practice and hunting.\n\nSummary of State Law\n\nSeveral states and the District of Columbia impose minimum age requirements, some of which extend beyond those contained in federal law. Those laws generally fall into four categories:\n\nLaws imposing a minimum age for handgun or firearm purchases ;\n\nLaws imposing a minimum age for all long gun purchases, from licensed or unlicensed sellers;\n\nLaws imposing age requirements for possession of handguns; and\n\nLaws imposing a minimum age for possession of long guns.\n\nAdditional information about laws preventing child access to firearms is included in our summary on Child Access Prevention.\n\nState Minimum Age Laws*\n\nStatePurchase of a HandgunPurchase of a Long GunPossession of a Handgun\n\nPossession of a Long Gun\n\nAlabama 1818Alaska181816\n\n16\n\nArizona1818 18\n\n18\n\nArkansas181818California212118\n\n18 for semiautomatic rifles (effective January 1, 2022; expanded to all firearms effective July 2023)\n\nColorado21 (Effective August 2023)21 (Effective August 2023)18Connecticut211821Delaware212121, subject to exceptions for people with concealed carry permits, recreation, and hunting\n\n21 for rifles, subject to exceptions for people with concealed carry permits, recreation, and hunting.

Similarly, while federal law prohibits handgun sales by licensed dealers to persons under 21, unlicensed dealers are prohibited only from selling handguns to persons under 18. As listed above, many states have imposed a minimum age for the purchase of all firearms, including both handguns and long guns, regardless of whether they are purchased from a licensed firearms dealer.\n\nStates with Stricter Minimum Age Requirements for Possession of Handguns than Federal Law\n\nConnecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Washington, and the District of Columbia impose minimum age requirements for the possession of handguns which are stricter than the federal minimum of 18.\n\nStates Imposing Minimum Age Requirements for Possession of Long Guns\n\nWhile federal law prohibits federally licensed firearms dealers from selling a long gun to anyone under 18, there is no federal minimum age for possession of a long gun. Twenty-three states have enacted laws to at least partially close this gap, and impose a minimum age at which persons can possess long guns. Many of these laws contain exceptions which allow younger children to possess long guns where the minor’s parent or guardian is present, or when the minor is engaged in hunting or target shooting.\n\nGET THE FACTS\n\nGun violence is a complex problem, and while there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, we must act. Our reports bring you the latest cutting-edge research and analysis about strategies to end our country’s gun violence crisis at every level.\n\nLearn More\n\nSelected Local Law\n\nNew York City\n\nIn New York City, however, no person under age 21 may be granted a permit or license to purchase, possess or carry any firearm, with certain exceptions. It is also unlawful to transfer a firearm to any person under age 21 unless he or she is exempted. A person under 21 may carry, fire or use a rifle or shotgun without being subject to the permit requirement if he or she is in the presence of, or under the direct supervision of, a permit holder, or engaged in a military drill, competition, or target practice at a firing range.\n\nKey Legislative Elements\n\nThe features listed below are intended to provide a framework from which policy options may be considered. A jurisdiction considering new legislation should consult with counsel.\n\nMinimum age of 21 is imposed for all handgun sales, from licensed or unlicensed sellers (California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Vermont, and District of Columbia).\n\nMinimum age of 18 is imposed for all long gun sales, from licensed or unlicensed sellers (23 states and the District of Columbia).\n\nMinimum age of 21 is imposed for possession of handguns (Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia).\n\nMinimum age of 18 is imposed for possession of long guns (16 states and the District of Columbia).\n\nYounger teens are allowed to possess long guns only under direct adult supervision."
