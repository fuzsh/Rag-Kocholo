        "text": "MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- We're learning more about the extensive criminal history of a 14-year-old Milwaukee boy who killed a motorcyclist June 27 in a hit-and-run crash.\n\nWe're not yet naming the boy because he is a minor. But he is in custody after a string of armed robberies, auto thefts, a shooting, and the deadly hit-and-run.\n\nThe boy is facing 25 counts for a host of crimes, 24 of them are felonies. There are 13 counts of armed robbery in a span of six weeks, and at least four stolen cars. And some of these incidents happened when this kid was just 13 years old.\n\nThe known crimes started June 13.\n\nTwo teens tried to break into a Kia, then noticed two women spotted them. They implied they had guns and threatened to shoot the women, then stole their car and fled, later abandoning it in the middle of the street.\n\nTwo weeks later, a teen reported the suspect robbed him at gunpoint.\n\nOn July 13, the boy turned 14 years old.\n\nLess than a week later, he went on another spree.\n\nOn July 19 he shot a girl in the jaw when he opened fire on her car near McGovern Park. He later admitted to the shooting.\n\nThree days after that, he and another boy robbed a man at a gas station on Capitol, pointing a gun in his face and saying, \"If you donâ€™t give us what you have, we will kill you.\"\n\nTwo days later, on July 24, he committed three robberies in a matter of minutes.\n\nFirst, he robbed a couple at gunpoint outside a bar on West National, saying, \"Gimme what you got\" and pointing a handgun with a light mounted on it in a woman's face.\n\nMoments later and around the corner, he robbed two people at gunpoint outside their hotel. They were in town for the Northwestern Mutual event and the Eric Church concert.\n\nThen he tried to steal a purse from another woman outside her hotel.\n\nThe boy later admitted to the three robberies.\n\nOn July 26 he shot at a man at a gas station and stole his car.\n\nThe next day, he robbed a couple at gunpoint. While officers investigated the robbery, he tried to break into a car a few blocks away.\n\nPolice went there and he fled, then tried to break into another car, and fled again.\n\nHe then blew a stop sign and hit 31-year-old motorcyclist Marc Jones near 1st and Walker.\n\nJones later died in the hospital from multiple blunt force injuries. He was visiting the Milwaukee area for the annual Harley-Davidson Homecoming.\n\nThe complaint said the boy skidded across the street before getting up and running off. A gun that flew out of the car and was recovered matched the one used in the McGovern Park shooting.\n\nHe was arrested at his aunt's house July 31.\n\nLast August, shortly after turning 13, the boy took part in an attempted carjacking outside a grocery store.\n\nIn September of last year there was another armed carjacking and another robbery.\n\nThe boy is currently in custody on a $200,000 bond."
