If you are an experienced competition shooter and are looking for a potential college or university to attend, use the Collegiate Shooting Sports Directory as a resource. If you are already enrolled in college, or plan to attend a university that does not have a competitive program and you would like to start one, use the e-book \"Developing A Scholastic Shooting Program.\"\n\nNational Youth Shooting Sports Cooperative Program\n\nNRA has resources, programs and training to assist youth organizations, such as Boy Scout troops, Royal Ranger outposts, American Legion posts, JROTC units, 4-H clubs, FFA chapters, commercial summer camps and U.S. Jaycee chapters.
