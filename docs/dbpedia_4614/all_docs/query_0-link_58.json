        "text": "BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Accidental deaths from firearms are way too common, and it happened again on August 4 in Baton Rouge.\n\nAccording to Baton Rouge Police Department’s Lieutenant L’Jean McNeely, the father of a two-year-old boy left his gun out to where the kid could access it. While playing with the gun, the two-year-old, Devonte Chambers, shot himself in the torso area. He died at the hospital shortly after. Devonte Chambers, also the name of the father, was arrested and charged with negligent homicide.\n\nRELATED: BRPD: 2-year-old dies after accidentally shooting himself; father arrested\n\nSince 2020, gun violence has been the leading cause of death for American kids, soaring above deaths from car crashes, cancer, and drownings, according to the Kids and Guns Organization.\n\nScott Roe is the owner of Spillway Sports, where you can get guns and all the accessories you need to keep weapons safe. He says it’s vital for kids to learn what happens when the trigger of a gun is pulled.\n\n“Children are curious. They see this. they see what’s on TV, they see what’s in the video games, and they don’t realize there’s no reset button. There’s no do-over button,” Roe says. “Somebody has to pull the trigger. Unfortunately, with children, if you leave the innate object there, a child gets a hold of it. Their curiosity is to pull the trigger, so training with your children, your family, showing them the implications of what would happen when that trigger gets pulled is what we have to do as parents.”\n\nRoe says if your kids are too young for training, keeping your guns in a secure and hidden place needs to be every gun owner’s priority. Gun stores offer things like magnets, mounts, safes, and various types of locks to keep your guns secure.\n\n“If you don’t have a gun safe, and you’re not able to purchase a gun safe and you still want a firearm in your house, keep, there’s multiple objects on the market that are available that you can keep a firearm out of children’s reach,” Roe says.\n\nAccording to a study that used data from the national violent death reporting system, from 2003 to 2021, accidental deaths with a firearm left 1,262 kids ages 0-17 dead. Almost 400 of those children were five and under (29.1%).\n\nClick here to report a typo."
