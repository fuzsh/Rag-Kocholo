His two children were inside the car.\n\nThat's when police say a suspect got into the car and tried to drive away.\n\nBefore the suspect could flee the scene, however, Cruz-Rodriguez reportedly tried to climb into the back of the car.\n\nRELATED | 'Heroic action': NJ father killed trying to protect his 2 children during carjacking attempt\n\nThe suspect then allegedly opened fire on Cruz-Rodriguez.\n\nAuthorities say the car crashed into two parked vehicles a short distance away.\n\nThe Mercer County Prosecutor said both children were unharmed, but Cruz-Rodriguez was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe juvenile suspect has since been charged with murder, carjacking, endangering the welfare of a child, and other related offenses.\n\nInvestigators say his name is being withheld due to him being a minor."
