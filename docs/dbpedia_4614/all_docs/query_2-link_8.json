The shooter has been identified by the Park County, Wyoming coroner as Samson Lucas Bariah Fussner, 28, of Milton, Florida. Fussner died after an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement. The investigation into this incident, including the actions of the National Park Service (NPS) law enforcement rangers, is being led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and will be reviewed by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Wyoming.\n\nJust after midnight on July 4, Yellowstone’s 911 dispatch center received a report that a woman had been held against her will by a man with a gun in a residence at Canyon Village. She also reported to law enforcement rangers that Fussner threatened to kill her and others, including plans to allegedly carry out a mass shooting(s) at July 4th events outside the park.\n\nResponding law enforcement rangers located his vehicle unoccupied in the Canyon area. The preliminary investigation indicated Fussner was likely armed and dangerous. With the individual at large, law enforcement rangers were strategically deployed to protect areas with park visitors and employees while searching for Fussner, and the park’s 911 dispatch center notified surrounding jurisdictions. By the early hours of July 4, over 20 NPS law enforcement rangers, including the park’s special response team, were working to protect people and locate Fussner.\n\nAt approximately 8 a.m., law enforcement rangers posted near Canyon Lodge, which houses employee and public dining rooms, encountered Fussner. Fussner reportedly walked toward the service entrance of the facility while firing a semi-automatic rifle. The building was occupied by approximately 200 people at the time. Several law enforcement rangers engaged Fussner. During an exchange of gunfire, Fussner was shot by law enforcement rangers. In addition, one law enforcement ranger was shot in a lower extremity. Additional rangers with emergency medical training rendered aid to both the injured law enforcement ranger and Fussner. Fussner died at the scene. The injured law enforcement ranger was transported to an area hospital in stable condition and has since been released. No other physical injuries were reported.\n\nFussner was an employee of Xanterra Parks and Resorts, a private business authorized to operate in Yellowstone.\n\nThe FBI, with support from the NPS, Xanterra and other partners, is providing victim/witness support to anyone who was involved in the incident.\n\nNPS policy for a law enforcement involved shooting calls for involved law enforcement rangers to be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation of the incident. Consistent with Department of the Interior and NPS policies, the NPS will release available body worn camera footage of the incident within 30 days.\n\n\"Thanks to the heroic actions of our law enforcement rangers, many lives were saved here last Thursday,\" said Superintendent Cam Sholly. \"These rangers immediately confronted this shooter and took decisive action to ensure he was no longer a threat to public safety. We are working now to provide maximum support to those involved and their families. We appreciate the support of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Park Service, Department of the Interior, and many other partners as we continue to manage through the aftermath of this incident.\"\n\nLaw enforcement involved shooting in Yellowstone National Park\n\nDate of release: July 4, 2024\n\nThere was a significant law enforcement incident at Canyon Village in the central part of Yellowstone National Park overnight and this morning, July 4.\n\nThere are no active threats to the public.\n\nRangers responded to a report of an individual with a firearm who was making threats. When rangers contacted the individual there was an exchange of gunfire between the subject and law enforcement rangers.\n\nThe subject is deceased. We are not releasing the individual’s identity at this time.\n\nOne Yellowstone law enforcement park ranger was injured. They are in stable condition and being treated at a nearby regional hospital.\n\nAn area around the Canyon Lodge complex remains closed for the investigation.\n\nThe FBI is leading the investigation with support from National Park Service special agents.\n\nDetails around this incident are under investigation. No additional information is available at this time."
