        "text": "Newly released surveillance footage shows the masked shooter police said shot two young boys inside a Bronx McDonald's and fled the scene, authorities say.\n\nIt shows the shooter slowly strolling across the floor of the fast food restaurant on White Plains Road in Allerton around 10 p.m. Saturday. They appear to have a thin build, though facial features are difficult to make out â€” due in part to the blue surgical mask the individual is wearing.\n\nAt some point, the shooter opens fire.\n\nA 12-year-old boy was shot in the left thigh and back, and a 13-year-old was hit in the left leg, according to police.\n\nLaw enforcement sources said the boys were the intended targets of the shooter, though it wasn't clear why. They were expected to recover.\n\nPolice are still searching for the person who fired the shots, last seen wearing a dark sweatshirt with red letters.\n\nAnyone with information on the shooting is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS."
