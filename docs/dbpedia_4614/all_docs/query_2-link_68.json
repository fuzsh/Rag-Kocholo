        "text": "Middle and high school students across the country shared their thoughts on gun violence with the NewsHour after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018. We thought you'd like to read their voices, since they were very clear in wanting to share them.\n\nWe should not have to beg the U.S. to stop letting our friends die\n\nby Carly Novell, 12th grade, Marjory Douglas Stoneman High School, Parkland, Florida\n\nOn average, there are about 13,000 deaths in the United States resulting from gun violence each year. Seventeen of those deaths were people I attended school with. People I passed in the halls everyday.\n\nNot many realize how much the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students are grieving. We are traumatized. We are scared. But we are ignoring all of that because we are trying to make a difference. We haven’t had a minute to process or grieve. We are just trying to make sure that this does not happen again. We, as high school students who just went through something traumatic, are forced to beg and plead for change.\n\nSomething needs to be done to get semi-automatic guns out of the hands of civilians. Something needs to be done to get firearms out of the hands of the mentally ill. It should not be so easy to obtain a gun. We should not have to beg the U.S. to stop letting our friends die. The NRA has silenced our government for too long. We will not be silenced by the media, by the government, by the president, by the NRA or by anyone for that matter.\n\nI am a proud supporter of the right to own a firearm. Notice I said firearm, not weapon\n\nby Aaron, 12th grade, Alexandria, Indiana\n\nI am a proud supporter of the right to own a firearm. Notice I said firearm, not weapon. A weapon is something used in a harmful manner. Firearms don't kill people, ignorant people do.\n\nTo start with, yes, firearms need to be regulated. Fully automatics are not needed. Bump stocks really don't matter because with a semi-automatic rifle, the rifle fires as fast as you pull the trigger.\n\nAs far as security, schools should have only one entrance and teachers should be given the choice to be armed. Not all educators need to be armed, and no one should be required to do so. Part of the application should include a mental health assessment and a background check. There is no reason why stores should have better security than schools.\n\nWe need to find a way to solve these school shootings as a country. Other countries are sitting back watching the U.S. tear itself apart from the inside. Let's go back to the time that if you had a problem, you just knocked the other person out. You didn't shoot them.\n\nStudents need a designated time to center themselves for school\n\nby Nathan, 12th grade, Chicago, Illinois\n\nOne solution is social-emotional learning. Before school, after school and during lunch period, there should be chill-spaces for students to de-stress, talk to a counselor and get themselves ready for the day.\n\nStudents have lives outside of school filled with experiences that are either traumatic, mentally exhausting or triggering. A designated time to center themselves for the school day would help. While this solution does not solve the problem of guns in the streets, it does help provide outlets for students who have mental health issues.\n\nA multi-pronged approach to guns is needed, not changes to the Second Amendment\n\nby Maria, 10th grade, Bronx, New York\n\n\"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\n\nThese words, adopted in the Constitution of the United States on December 15, 1791, are not to blame for the recent shootings in the first several weeks of 2018.\n\nThe solution to school shootings is regulation of gun laws, not problems with the Second Amendment. It's not having students practice lock-downs out of fear that an attack like Parkland could happen at their school. And it also doesn't involve getting caught up in the political ruckus surrounding the the election of 2016. Such behavior serves only as an excuse for our nation to not accomplish its goals, including keeping children safe.\n\nAs for gun regulations, our government could learn from other countries like Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Japan puts its citizens through a rigorous set of tests which includes a mandatory all-day class. From there, they must take a written test, have a 95 percent accuracy on a shooting-range test, a mental health evaluation and a background check. If that seems like a lot, Japanese citizens must then retake the class and the exam every three years.\n\nAustralia paid citizens to sell their firearms back to the government. Firearm homicides in that country dropped 0.15 per 100,000 people in 2006 compared to 0.37 in 1995.\n\nThe United States should use a multi-pronged approach in order to take us out of this deep depression. Our leaders need to start giving us hope by taking action.\n\nWhite privilege is real and Parkland was a clear example of it\n\nby Mya, 11th grade, McKinney, Texas\n\nThe problem America has is that we give everyone a gun without any mental health testing. We need to be more like other countries and require screenings. You can’t blame the entire problem of gun violence on the mentally ill either. We need stricter laws when it comes to gun control. Also, it should be illegal for a politician to take money from an organization such as the NRA.\n\nPoliticians who choose money over children’s lives are heartless human beings.\n\nAfter seeing the event unfold on television, this incident made me realize that we don't just have a gun control issue, but we also have a race issue. If the shooter was a different race other than white, they would’ve killed him on the spot instead of arresting him. Race should not be a factor when it comes to life or death. White privilege is real and Parkland was a clear example of it.\n\nRight to live outweighs the right to shoot\n\nby Ryan Deitsch, 12th grade, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Parkland, Florida\n\nThis country is a place I truly love; this government, however, has not gained my favor. Those in leadership consolidate power instead of legislate it. There is no good and bad I see here, only what is right for the American people, what is right for all people. I don’t want to infringe on the rights of man, but the right to live should far outweigh the right to shoot.\n\nThoughts and prayers are one of many coping mechanisms, and I praise those who put myself and others in their hearts, however, humanity is here to care for the Earth bestowed upon us. I see no better way to care for the world than to protect the lives of the innocent and take action where it must be taken.\n\nI have had enough of sitting around while adults do nothing\n\nby Eden, 12th grade, Iowa City, Iowa\n\nWhen I was 10, one of my friends and classmates was murdered . His father beat him, his three siblings, and their mother to death with a bat. Afterwards, Seth's father called the police to report the deaths and fled the home.\n\nAt the time, there was a great deal of confusion. No one knew where he was. No one knew if he was armed. No one knew what he might do. Fearing that he might come to the school, Longfellow Elementary went into lockdown. In Mrs. Dillard’s second-grade class, we sat in silence. The teachers said nothing. They didn’t know what to say. How can you explain something like this to a child? We knew nothing. And so we sat in our corner, in the dark and in the silence.\n\nI have had enough silence.\n\nI have had enough of being in the dark. I have had enough of sitting around while adults do nothing. I am not content with being in the corner anymore.\n\nChange will not come on its own. We have to make it for ourselves. The adults have proven that they are unwilling to move beyond thoughts and prayers. We must force them into action.\n\nThat includes my own senators: Joni Ernst , who has accepted millions of dollars from the NRA, and Chuck Grassley, who has accepted hundreds of thousands. Is this how much our lives are worth?\n\nWe may not have the power, the resources, or even the ability to vote, but we do have our voices. In America, there is no weapon more powerful.\n\nFor me, this conversation started with Seth, and with my own fear that followed. The next school year, we planted trees behind Longfellow for each member of the family. They’ve grown now, leaves sprouting and dying and falling with the seasons. Their branches have faded into the background, blending with the lines of trees behind them. But after ten years, I think their roots are finally spreading.\n\nMy family is scared to send me to school\n\nby Kearra, 11th grade, McKinney, Texas\n\n\"What are we supposed to do? Send our kids to school with bulletproof vests?\" My mom said to me yesterday. Instead of worrying about our grades and relationships, we have to worry if we are going to survive a day at school. The American people have a right to buy and own guns, but I also have a right to be able to go to school and not worry about dying. My right to live outweighs any gun rights. How many more people have to die before something is done?\n\nMy whole family is scared to send my siblings and I to school every morning because they don't know if we are going to make it home. Every day that we sit around and do nothing about the shootings and guns, we are killing more innocent people. The U.S. is number one in shootings and mass incarceration. President Trump doesn't want to face the fact that something needs to be done. Without the support of the American people, he wouldn't have a country to lead. It's the duty of the president to do everything in his power to protect the citizens. We have to make our voices heard and strive for change. Is a gun worth more than my life?\n\nREAD: OPINION: A student’s obituary should never say ‘gunned down while studying for chemistry’\n\nWe already have gun control. We do need to do something to help the mentally ill.\n\nby Katie, 11th grade, Parker, Colorado\n\nThe media in general provides a liberal stance on the gun debate. Weapons come in many different forms, and a common misconception in our country is that we would be safer without guns. Even though improvements to gun policy could prove to be beneficial, they will never end the violence that has come to play a part in our education system.\n\nHowever, we do need to do something to help the mentally ill instead of arbitrarily restricting already existing gun regulations. Nikolas Cruz had a well-known history of firearm obsession. Cruz was even evaluated by behavioral health experts, yet he was not hospitalized or detained. We could have helped him before this tragedy unfolded in front of our eyes.\n\nTeenagers' brains are not yet fully developed. Why can they buy guns?\n\nby Cecilia, 11th grade, New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nAfter listening to a story on NPR, I encountered a fact by a neuroscientist about brain development for the average 18-year-old. The prefrontal cortex of teenagers is not yet fully developed. This is the part of the brain that helps you to control impulses and make smart decisions in times of stress.\n\nIf 18 is the legal age to buy a gun, then I see a huge problem with this. I believe we should adjust the legal age requirement for someone to own a gun. These are steps Congress needs to take so that other high school students like me don’t have to worry about experiencing another terrifying and tragic attack.\n\nSchool shootings give responsible gun owners a bad name\n\nby Kenneth, 12th grade, McKinney, Texas\n\nPractically, there is not a solution. Based on inevitable mathematical probability, someone somewhere with gun access will carry out a school shooting. Theoretically, the only surefire way to prevent a school shooting is to prevent guns from getting into civilian hands whether illegal or legal firearms.\n\nWhat needs to happen instead is education. We need to educate the public about guns in order to prevent firearm ignorance. We should have mandatory gun safety classes in school and teach young people what a firearm is, the tools and parts of the gun and what purposes they serve. Even with one gun in public circulation, there will be a potential but very slim chance of a shooting. School shootings give responsible gun owners and guns a bad name. Gun restrictions will not get rid of school shootings, even if every single student in school had the discipline of a soldier and proper training. It's not the guns, it's the people holding them.\n\nWe have to stop judging others\n\nby Misti, 12th grade, Graham, Washington\n\nThe problems our society is experiencing right now have more to do with how we treat each other than gun control. We judge people based on their looks, especially if they look sketchy or just different. We see someone who is quiet or a kid who is always getting into trouble, and we judge them without know what they have been through. Society makes fun of those type of people. As teenagers, we constantly pick on someone until they are down on the ground. It’s like we are trying to kill someone who may already feel dead inside. You see all of these shows about criminals, and some of them are about murders, and it intrigues us. The real problem is us.\n\nSome may wonder how such people came into power\n\nby Gabe, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nThe right to bear arms is a fundamental freedom enjoyed in the United States. However, this does not mean there shouldn’t be regulations on the sale and production of these arms. Without laws, we are faced with the problem of unashamed maniacs and domestic terrorists. The simplest solution to this complex issue seems to be tighter restrictions and more cohesive background and mental state checks. Now, of course this will not take all guns off the street and black market, but it will prevent people who shouldn’t have guns from purchasing them. Or at least make it harder to.\n\nUnfortunately, with the presidential administration we currently have, and the lobbyists paying thousands and thousands to either campaign as a way to curry favor with whomever wins, we won’t see a mandate demanding any of these proposed solutions anytime soon. The gun industry is convoluted and has a tight grip on the politicians, who are forced to do the industry’s bidding. The same lawmakers are aware of the hundreds and thousands of dollars they receive from the NRA (National Rifle Association). Some may wonder how such people came into power.\n\nI have had my hunting license since I was in fifth grade. We need to make it harder to buy firearms.\n\nby Morgan, 12th grade, Anderson, Indiana\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I have nothing against people having guns. I have grown up in a house full of firearms and hunting bows. I have had my hunting license since I was in fifth grade. However, many people my age struggle with mental health. Some take it to extreme levels, like taking guns from their home to school and shooting innocent people.\n\nAs a country, we also need to make it harder to buy firearms. Only certain guns should allowed to be sold to the average joe. Not only should we add more regulations, but we should add a tax when buying a firearm, like we do for cigarettes and alcohol -- items that may bring harm to ourselves or others.\n\nPublic schools needs to use security tactics similar to other institutions\n\nby Bridget, 12th grade, Gretna, Nebraska\n\nThere are several measures that could have been taken to prevent the Parkland, Florida school shooting, like taking threats, including social media posts, more seriously. The Federal Bureau of Investigation ignored obvious signs, including the shooter's online comments, which stated, “I’m going to be a professional school shooter.”\n\nGuns themselves are not evil and do not murder individuals. They are safe in the possession of a majority of Americans and will never be used to kill children. With that said, a revisit to gun laws is reasonable, including extensive background checks and mental evaluations for those looking to purchase any firearm.\n\nRealistically, there will not be an end to school shootings any time soon. Therefore, public schools needs to heighten security now in order to protect those inside. In some cases, hospitals and banks have security systems that will lock doors; this isolates the shooter and would prevent their travel throughout the premise. Using tactics similar to these institutions would aid in saving students and teachers' lives.\n\nDon't turn schools into prisons\n\nby Ashunti, 12th grade, Chicago, Illinois\n\nSome individuals favor solutions that place armed guards in a defense perimeter around schools. Others want to arm teachers. And yet the idea of a “good guy with a gun” makes me more fearful of school shootings in our future.\n\nTeachers aren’t always 100 percent the good guys. There are many accounts of teachers who aren’t trustworthy enough to be around kids. Arming them all would endanger more kids than “protecting.” These solutions seem to want to turn schools from safe environments into prisons.\n\nSchool shootings can't be blamed on problems of big city life\n\nby Kelsey, 11th grade, Gretna, Nebraska\n\nThe truth about the Parkland shooting is that it opened eyes and it opened doors. The debate has shifted from petty Twitter fights to actual debates on gun control policy. A wave of voices has emerged and teens are demanding reform. Efforts to normalize gun violence by those in power and the news media have been shaken by our awareness that this violent American plague is anything but normal. School shootings cannot be blamed on problems of the big city. Parkland is no bigger than my hometown in the Midwest. I think the country is finally starting to notice that it can happen to any of our schools.\n\nMy tears have been quickly replaced with anger\n\nby Shahana, 12th grade, Dallas, Texas\n\nMost teenagers today remember the heartbreak after Sandy Hook but have become increasingly desensitized to such events as they occur more frequently. The individuals who commit such heinous acts are given the power -- easy access to weapons -- to instill fear into school-aged children. They are dubbed as people who are mentally-ill instead of as terrorists. While they are successful in breaking the spirit of many, they will never take away my voice. My tears are quickly replaced with anger. Anger towards a government that doesn’t enforce gun control, anger towards media outlets for how they focus so much on the shooter, anger towards the world for being so cruel and heartless. But nobody can take away my voice. I will never stop speaking out against the deep injustice of school shootings and a system which has failed its citizens too many times.\n\nWe will do everything in our power to ensure that our views are represented in future elections\n\nby Camille, 11th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nIn the aftermath of the most recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, adults tell us not to live in fear and to go on with our daily lives. Yet, over the last two decades since the mass shooting at Columbine High School, nothing has been done to prevent more school shootings. In fact, access to assault-style weapons has only gotten easier. This unfettered access to weapons has caused us to lose future Olympians, mathematicians, teachers, writers, doctors, astronauts and all those individuals who would one day make up our communities. Our generation will not forget that our elected leaders have let us down over and over again. We will do everything in our power to ensure that our views are represented when we are eligible to vote. When we do, we will create laws to restrict weapon access, ensure care for behavioral health issues and keep our schools safe for our friends, families and for generations.\n\nThe government isn't messing with the Second Amendment\n\nby Noah, 12th grade, Anderson, Indiana\n\nJust because you make it harder to get guns doesn’t mean your Second Amendment is being taken away. The person buying the gun should have to go through mental health screenings to see if they’re stable enough to handle guns. He/she should then be required to go every six months to retake mental health exams. It should be harder to get guns or certain attachments. They should be required to take a class to make sure they know how to handle guns.\n\nPeople complain that the government is trying to mess with the Second Amendment, which it really isn't. People just need to grow up and deal with the fact that some folks may not be stable or knowledgeable enough to own a gun. The world is safer that way.\n\nWe need a new plan\n\nby Briaja, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nIt's time for our country to step up and figure out a plan B because clearly plan A isn’t working. Plan B would involve improving security at schools and passing stricter gun laws. We can start by preventing anyone under the age of 25 from owning a gun. At 25, people's minds are more cognitively and physically developed than when they are teenagers. At 25, people are coming out of their adolescence phase and becoming responsible adults.\n\nOne of my teachers said the problem wasn't criminals shooting up the school but kids who are able to access guns. Under Plan B, we get our government to step up and find a way to take of the issue. Because no one should have to hear another government official say, “Our thoughts and prayers are with you,” especially if they aren’t doing anything to help solve the problem.\n\nWe have allowed greed to overpower our humanity\n\nby Ashley, 12th grade, Palo Alto, California\n\nI was 12 years old at the time of the Sandy Hook shooting. Hopelessly idealistic and a little naive, I believed that the government, who had to be equally sickened and shocked as I was at the massacre of elementary school children, would immediately scramble to prevent such tragedies from reoccurring.\n\nBut nothing changed. And then, another school shooting happened. Then another. Then 200 more . And here we are now, a nation reeling from the deaths of 17 more students and teachers in Florida, wondering what went wrong again.\n\nOur inaction as a nation is — and was — inexcusable. Thoughts and prayers won’t save the hundreds of kids whose blood has been spilled while simply pursuing their education, and they won’t create a safer America for future generations. There is no blanket solution to this incredibly nuanced issue, but we cannot continue to dodge and delay at the expense of children’s lives.\n\nWhen the National Rifle Association has donated millions to our representatives, it is no wonder that the many attempts to pass gun safety legislation have been repeatedly blocked. We have allowed greed to overpower our humanity; we cannot have the people who represent us value profit over lives.\n\nWhen politics have become increasingly polarized, it is no wonder that we have not had effective dialogue regarding gun control. Progress cannot be made without communication and compromise; effective gun control and the Second Amendment truly can coexist.\n\nREAD: Opinion: I’ve asked hundreds of students if they would feel safer if I was armed. Not one has said yes\n\nRemain hopeful, change will come\n\nby Evan, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nThe worst thing we can do at a time like this is to just accept that horrible things like this aren’t going to stop occurring in schools. I believe that the best solution to this problem is to increase the level of background checks regarding gun sales and make it harder for those suffering from certain mental illnesses to acquire guns. If a person is viewed as a danger to society, then they should not be allowed to own a gun under any circumstances. I also believe that those with violent criminal history should face much higher restrictions when owning and purchasing guns.\n\nWe should prioritize innocent children’s lives over giving criminals a second chance when it comes to owning weapons. However, I do not in any way support creating more total gun-free zones. The idea of total gun-free zones sounds like a good solution, but how likely is it for a potential shooter to follow a sign warning of a total gun-free zone? Schools should have at least one police officer. They should be able to do whatever they want about not letting in armed visitors, but they should definitely have some protection within the school to stop a potential shooter.\n\nI hope and pray that tragedies like this will cease to occur and the lives of American children will be protected. I also believe this recent shooting will lead to changes in gun laws.\n\nGuns have changed, shouldn’t our laws change with them?\n\nby Tacey, 11th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nAfter the Florida school shooting my friends and I were having a conversation at our lunch table. We were saying how if four shooters came in at that moment, blocking all exits, what would we do. Run. Hide. Hug your friends and call parents because you know it’s all over. These should not be the thoughts running through 17-year old girls' heads. We should be more concerned with a pop quiz in history than a mass murderer popping through the doors.\n\nYes, we have the Second Amendment, the “right to bear arms.\" This was passed in 1789, when loading a gun took a lot longer between rounds than it does now. An AR-15 can fire dozens of rounds a minute. A legally converted AR-15 can fire 700 a minute. Guns have changed, shouldn’t our laws change with them?\n\nWe need to ban some guns\n\nby Jemini, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nIn 2017, about four out of every 10 Americans said they owned a gun or live in a home with guns. Now am I saying we should ban all firearms? No, not at all. But I am saying that we should definitely ban some firearms. In most cases, semi-automatic weapons that mimic those used by our military on the battlefield. Why would you ever use such a gun for hunting?\n\nIn November, we will vote.\n\nby Morgan, 12th grade, Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nParkland is different. My generation has grown up living through nonstop violence, and now many of us are of voting age. However, it won’t begin with voting. We will organize school walkouts and speak to our administration. We will work with school boards and lobby local leaders. We will challenge the National Rifle Association and our elected officials. And in November, we will vote.\n\nI’ve always been told to not live my life in fear\n\nby Cassidy, 11th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nI’ve always been told to not live my life in fear. As a high school student, however, I’ve felt a lack of security after the recent school shootings. As a teenager, I've witnessed the impact of adolescents becoming depressed and afflicted by negativity and hate. Seeing how lax today’s gun laws are, I can’t ignore the feeling that causes me to wonder what would happen if that were my school?\n\nAs it is now, we are vulnerable and defenseless. We can’t face a shooter, and we lack options of how to act in a split second. We can only run and hide. I am demanding that we take action on this issue as a nation. We can’t have more innocent lives lost just because of one person’s failure to think logically.\n\nDo not take our right to bear arms\n\nby Maia, 11th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nI like that we have a right to bear arms. There are many people who want to take away this right, and I don’t agree with that. However, I do care about preventing the wrong people, including those with certain mental health issues, getting ahold of guns. Authorities should look for specific signs. Of course we won’t stop everything, but more can be done.\n\nWhy I'm careful how I talk about metal detectors\n\nby Ja’Kavien, high school student, Flint, Michigan\n\nI believe that every school should be well secured with metal detectors no matter how much they cost. But one thing I don't like when discussing metal detectors in schools are some of the underlying prejudices that are made about students who go to schools in the “hood,” where metal detectors are already in place.\n\nIf you go to school in a nice suburban area, there will probably not be any metal detectors in sight. That's because for a long time school leaders likely thought their students were not capable of doing such a thing, like killing innocent people. But just about every year, there is a school shooting in a town unknown to most Americans. The people who carry out mass shootings are predominantly white and live not far from the schools. It looks like metal detectors need to be everywhere now, not just in the hood.\n\nCongressional inaction on guns speaks volumes\n\nby Anson, 11th grade, Medford, New York\n\nAs a high school student myself in the modern world, it is quite honestly absurd that the issue of massacring children is even something that needs to be argued.\n\nSchoolchildren are criticized for their “ignorance” when they criticize the National Rifle Association. But one just needs to look at the NRA's social media platforms after a mass shooting to see if the criticism is justified - they will be met with silence or arguments that it is not a guns issue, but a mental health issue. The unfortunate hypocrisy is that despite recognizing that mental health is the issue, some members of the government still refuse to provide healthcare to those who can’t afford it. It seems that in today’s America, it is unjust to take away assault weapons and impossible to give treatments to those in need, so the only option is to keep letting children get gunned down.\n\nI don’t want to be surrounded by weapons when I'm trying to learn.\n\nby Brie, 11th grade, Reno, Nevada\n\nI find it terrifying that Nikolas Cruz was able to pass a background check to obtain his guns. Being suspended from his high school for violent behavior should have been enough of a red flag. Guns are designed to kill. Whether they are used to kill animals or people, they are weapons of death. The solution isn’t for teachers to carry guns. I don’t want to be surrounded by weapons when I am trying to learn. I believe that the solution is stricter background checks and outlawing bump stocks and military grade weapons. No one needs an AR-15 rifle to hunt, nor do they need bump stocks. Students are required to spend roughly 5,850 hours every year in school. We demand to feel safe.\n\nWe need to learn about the power of guns\n\nby Matthew, Joliet, Illinois\n\nOur culture is aware of the danger of guns, but the news and entertainment media have helped to rob the public of their true dangers. We need a greater sense of conscientiousness among student bodies about the threats firearms pose and how they especially affect those who have serious mental illness. By educating people more about guns, we are more likely to become aware of their power.\n\nThe problem with 'this too shall pass'\n\nRuby, 11th grade, New Orleans, Louisiana\n\nWhenever anything upsetting has happened during my life, whether Hurricane Katrina or the death of a family member, my grandma has always told me the common saying, “This too shall pass.” I have continued to remember this saying throughout my life after any tragic event. The problem with school shootings is that with time they do pass and over time the media moves on to a new topic.\n\nInstead of hoping and praying for change, we need to take responsibility and advocate for the changes we want to see in our country. We have drills at school for natural disasters such as fires or tornadoes or earthquakes. If we could pass a law to end these natural occurrences, I’m sure it would be passed unequivocally. In a country that has sent a man to the moon, invented cell-phones, legalized gay marriage, and has made so much progress in human rights, we have no excuse to not pass laws or make an amendment to our Constitution that enables citizens to obtain guns in a safer way and ensures that we don’t lose more lives.\n\nRELATED: Opinion: To prevent school shootings, can mental health be taught?\n\nWhen a black child commits a crime, they're called a 'thug' — not “mentally ill\"\n\nby Taniya, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nSchool shootings are not a problem in the African American community. There has rarely been an incident where a black child has shot up a school. And if a black child has shot up a school their deemed a “thug,” “ghetto,” or “hood.\" A brown child is called a “terrorist,\" but when a white child shoots up a school their deemed “mentally ill,” “has a hard life” or ”defending themselves.”\n\nWhen a black person commits a crime, the media digs for dirt on them. But when a white person does it, the media makes excuses for them. For example, with the recent school shooting in Florida, one of the first points that was brought to the media right after it happened was “he had a hard life,” or \"he’s adopted.” When he appeared in court, his lawyer claimed Nikolas Cruz was a “broken human being.”\n\nBeing broken is not an excuse to kill 17 people.\n\nStudents should not be afraid of fire alarms\n\nby Madelyn, 11th grade, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nThe day after the shooting in Parkland, my school’s fire alarm went off during fourth block. I remember my friends’ uneasy glances around the room. As we made our way outside, I started receiving several text messages from my friends reading: “This is how the shooting happened yesterday.”\n\nWe were all alert as we frantically walked outside not knowing what to expect. Sirens blared around as we continued to hear the fire alarm ringing inside. There was a faulty smoke alarm. We were safe, but it had been bad timing.\n\nThe following Monday, three minutes before dismissal, the fire alarm went off again. I remember my blood turning cold as students protested my teacher, telling her that they would not leave. Eventually, we were told that we must go outside and obeyed. Later, another one of my friends told me how she teared up. The chatter around me was fearful and angry.Luckily, yet another smoke detector had malfunctioned, and we were safely released from school afterwards. Were we next?\n\nMake security equipment mandatory\n\nJy’Quan, 11th grade, Castleton, New York\n\nI think schools districts should have mandatory security equipment in all schools to keep students and staff safe. There should also be more high-tech security for social media monitoring. Staff should be highly trained for events in order to protect students and themselves. The federal government should take responsibility and fund what is needed to keep schools safe. I think if everyone came together and took a stand, we could solve the problem, and schools could become places of learning once again.\n\nI saw my first handgun in the seventh grade\n\nby Grace, 12th grade, Langhorne, Pennsylvania\n\nI remember the first time I saw one of my classmates with a handgun. I was walking home from my middle school in seventh grade. He was sitting in the woods, showing it off to his friends. We live in an affluent county in Pennsylvania. I know few, if any, of these young men who have ever gone hunting.\n\nThere is another young man at my high school that sends dozens of his peers videos of him unloading and reloading guns at least twice a week. He is brooding, about twice my size and his excuse is that he wants to join the army. A friend of mine was punished for making a joke about Columbine in our junior year, but I don't know of anything that has been done about the young man with the guns.\n\nSchool districts should spend money on safety, not new laptops\n\nby Nicole, 11th grade, Gretna, Nebraska\n\nIf schools say our safety is their first priority, then why don't they spend money making us safe? Why buy students new laptops and computers, saying it's best for our learning, when we have been running on pencil and paper for as long as education has been a thing. Get us stronger security systems. Get us stronger communities where entire school districts don't have to shut down because someone made a threat. Get us more school counselors who can help those students who never really fit, who get made fun of by other kids, who eat alone at lunch and whose families struggle. There is so much we can do.\n\nI witnessed a shooting and firmly believe we need gun control\n\nby Jesse, 12th grade, Graham, Washington\n\nAs a high school student who witnessed a shooting just off campus , I strongly believe that legislative action must be taken.\n\nAn analysis by “Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence” showed that states with high gun restrictions like California, New York and Connecticut have the lowest rates of gun-related deaths. For instance, Connecticut passed legislation that banned assault weapons, outlawed magazines exceeding 10 rounds and began requiring background checks for all gun sales. Since then, gun-related deaths have dropped from 226 in 2012 to 164 in 2016.\n\nFor too long we have stood by and watched teachers and students get slaughtered by guns -- guns that are legal for merely recreational purposes. Our voices will no longer be drowned out by older, polarized generations. We need action. Gun control works.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/257306572\n\nFor many teens, witnessing the mobilization of student activists against gun violence in the wake of the Parkland shooting has been inspiring, but others remain skeptical.\n\nAdults no longer have the luxury to disagree\n\nby Lily, 10th grade, Ambler, Pennsylvania\n\nWhen I was in fifth grade I read, “I am Malala,” by Malala Yousafzai. Malala was a girl fighting for her education; the Taliban shot her in the forehead. Although our cultures are different, one thing connects America and Afghanistan: We both have kids who are frightened to go to school.\n\nAnd yet, the U.S. is classified as a first-world country. We are supposed to have our crap together. Instead, we are struggling to keep our children safe from assault riffles in their schools. And government officials are too stubborn to realize that they often see eye to eye on several matters of gun control. The adults of this country no longer have the luxury to disagree. They must come together to save the lives of our children.\n\nWe have failed too many kids\n\nby Curtis, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\n*pow*pow*pow*\n\nis all I hear when the school bell rings\n\nI jump when someone knocks on the classroom\n\ndoor too hard\n\nmy heart races while I walk through the halls\n\nat lunch I feel like a duck in an open field\n\nand hunting season is in full effect.\n\nI don't go to school anymore, I go to a\n\npotential war zone, I go to a potential shooting\n\nrange...19 years ago America was left in shock,\n\nhorror and pain. 19 years later kids are still waking\n\nup for what ends up being their final day on\n\nthis earth, they walk into school but never walk\n\nout. The official number doesn't matter because tomorrow\n\nit will be a different, higher number; the same goes for the\n\nday after that, and the day after that, and the day after that.\n\n19 years, countless victims, yet no change...\n\nWe're better than this.\n\nHow many of our country’s children will be forced to lose their lives?\n\nby Becka, 12th grade, Ventura, California\n\nThe shrill bleating of an alarm shattered my high school's lunchtime chatter. I watched, stunned, my gaze fixated on a boy sprinting for the Spanish teacher’s classroom door.\n\nLike a gunshot, panic broke out. Someone screamed. I looked around wildly for the teacher, waiting for her to start issuing orders to turn down the blinds and hide under the desks. But she was opening the door and herding people into the corridors.\n\nIt had been a fire alarm.\n\nTwo things deeply disturbed me about the incident. One, that I couldn’t tell the difference between a fire alarm and a lockdown alarm, or if that there was even a difference. Two, that it had provoked such mass hysteria.\n\nIf a shooter had come on campus, I couldn’t help thinking we’d have been butchered.\n\nThe next day, the Parkland shooting made national headlines.\n\nBeing in close quarters with a guardian of the Second Amendment, my father, pro-gun rhetoric and its recycled arguments no longer held any persuasion for me. I couldn’t help thinking I could have been one of those Parkland students being shot.\n\nCongress and the President need to understand that their inaction is trading away the lives of the future. But this time is different because we, the students, are the future and the future will not stand for it.\n\nStudents must be part of the conversation\n\nby Tierney, North Carolina high school student\n\nStudents and parents are holding their breaths, waiting to see where the next tragedy strikes, praying they won’t be the next victims. We need to make sure that people who are known to be violent or mentally unstable are given the help they need and not easy access to assault weapons. Programs that create smaller communities within schools would allow students with mental health issues to be identified and helped. Finally, students must be part of the conversation. Our lives are worth more than guns.\n\nBullying is alive in our hallways\n\nby Leslie, 11th grade, Satanta, Kansas\n\nValentine’s Day in Florida turned into a bloody massacre. A student, Nikolas Cruz, became a school shooter. Much of the discussion that followed has centered on the need for gun control. Few have even acknowledged the life of the shooter.\n\nCruz was a troubled student. Everyone wants to blame him, and yes, I do believe that he should be punished for his actions. But the root causes of such actions should be examined, too.\n\nWhy primarily argue about guns? Argue the fact that bullying is alive in all our hallways. Argue the fact that depression can rise like a fire with no help in sight. Argue the fact that students, kids who you might have grown up with, don’t know what the word “happy” means. Argue the fact that we teach students what x+y is not what to do when they feel suicidal. And when you’re arguing, remember Cruz is human, like me and you.\n\nMandatory health screens for everyone\n\nby Juston, 12th grade, Anderson, Indiana\n\nWe should teach students and faculty about gun safety, which includes how to shoot a gun, maintain a gun and how to disarm a gun at the bare minimum. Teachers and other faculty members should also have some sort of weapon available in the classroom. Whether or not it is a gun should be a decision left to the teacher to decide, but a weapon should be mandatory.\n\nI also believe in mental health checks before purchasing a weapon at a gun show or store. In fact, I would propose mandatory mental health screens for everyone, both young and old. This way the government could keep a mental health database and consult it when necessary.\n\nI have lived through too many national tragedies\n\nLeyton, 11th grade, Palo Alto, California\n\nThe Parkland shooting news alert popped up on my phone like many before it. But this one caught my eye…high school…shooter…fatalities. In shock, I blurted out the headline to a bus full of rowdy high schoolers headed to a soccer game. The response was heartbreaking. A couple of heads popped up from the lure of their phones but quickly looked back down. Many didn’t even acknowledge the tragedy. Only one person asked for details.\n\nThese are a handful of America’s youth, a diverse group living in the heart of Silicon Valley. They aren’t unique. We Americans have become desensitized to mass shootings. As a 16-year old born and raised in America, I have lived through too many national tragedies, more than enough for a lifetime. Mass shootings are now so frequent that many hardly bat an eyelash. Our pain has been desensitized. This is a problem. This is the problem. This is our problem.\n\nThese weapons are insanely powerful\n\nby Johanna, 10th grade, Ambler, Pennsylvania\n\nThe recent Florida shooting has made me aware of how much I had been living in fear without even realizing it. When I go out to places with large crowds, I always hug my parent’s goodbye, and the thought goes through my head that it could be the last time I see them. The types of weapons used in mass shootings are insanely powerful and, if not stopped, have the capability to kill hundreds of people in minutes. As students, we are the ones who are affected by this, yet it seems like no one will take our voices seriously.\n\nArm teachers with tools of knowledge\n\nby Grace, ninth grade, Binghamton, New York\n\nOne suggestion has been to put our teachers in the role of first responder, concealing metal and lead somewhere between their barely functioning technologies and dull dry erase markers. Instead, I wish they would arm our teachers with the tools they need to provide us with knowledge. If teachers wanted to be police officers, then it seems to me that they would have taken that oath.\n\nIt is more difficult for me to get my driver’s license than it is for someone to obtain a gun. This country, in all of its greatness, and it is already great, needs to get tougher on gun laws. Why do civilians need to own a weapon that the military uses during war to create mass casualties?\n\nWe are the same age\n\nby LaTisha, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nWhen will 'we are the same age' become 'we were the same age'? How can I be sure that it will not be me getting caught in the thought of a was.\n\nHow can I be sure that it will not be my family pleading on their worn battle knees, bleeding and crying out for answers, because their child no longer is but was.\n\nDo not act like prevention was a joke. A rehearsal that people knew would not work. A rehearsal that did not work for them. If you have a platform to speak and people to listen, use it. Speak up about gun violence and start making a change.\n\nIf you see a sign, how could you ignore it? Do not leave an abandoned mission to collect dust. Why not try to help? We cannot read minds, but we can read posts.\n\nRELATED: Students who support gun rights say schools safer when ‘good guys’ are armed\n\nI carry a spare car key, just in case\n\nby Alyssa, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nEvery day, while I'm at school, I carry a spare car key to my car wherever I go at all times. Just so in case there is a school shooting, I can go out the window and easily run to my car, fill it up with as many people as possible and get away. I feel safer that way and honestly, it's sad to think about. The other day at school I was sitting in the cafeteria and some kid dropped his binder and it made a big sound throughout the cafeteria, it sounded somewhat like a gunshot, and immediately I started crying.\n\nGuns are too easy to access\n\nby Raul, 12th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nWhen I moved to Mexico my sophomore year, I went to Acapulco for a week to visit some distant family. My family came back a week later to a cross sitting on our front door. Our neighbors told us that someone had been shot and killed next to our home.\n\nI found out that a boy my age had gotten into an argument and shot someone with a gun that he had gained easy access to. What really rattled me was later that night, when we got home, and saw all the children playing outside like nothing had happened.\n\nI have lived in both the United States and Mexico. I have thought about why gun violence is high in both places, and there is one thought that won’t leave my head: easy access.\n\nSafer schools cost money — it's worth it\n\nby Freddy, high school student, Joliet, Illinois\n\nMethods for taking down an active shooter need to be explored. Schools should create a team of non-lethal weapon carriers. There are many who protest the idea of faculty and staff in schools carrying weapons, but what if these weapons could bring down a shooter without ever posing a threat or causing a fatality? Pellet and bean bag guns have been developed for crowd control. It is not a stretch to ask and receive training to operate a non-lethal weapon. There's not a single mother or father who wouldn't pay extra tax dollars to ensure their child's safety in school.\n\nOur government pays more attention to people who aren’t “a part” of our country\n\nby Diasiia, 12th grade, Joliet, Illinois\n\nOur government is more focused on people who aren’t “a part” of our country when they should be focused on the people who they call Americans . While I know that all gun-related crimes won’t be solved with these laws, even a dent in the system could slow down the rate of increasing gun violence. After these problems are addressed and changes are made, maybe then we could come together and heal some of the wounds that this country has endured over the last few years.\n\nStudents also need to take some of the blame\n\nby Laurel, 9th grade, Amana, Iowa\n\nThe students also need to take some of the blame. The teens that create these massacres have to have a reason for doing all this. Maybe if one kid had said hello to him that day, he might not feel the need to go over the edge. It is the little things that can make someone's day. Isn’t it? Ignoring the weird kid, who sits alone at lunch, doesn’t help anything. Yes, maybe it wouldn’t have made a difference. But maybe, just maybe, some of the teens that were killed, maybe they would still be alive if someone noticed the weird kid, who sits alone at lunch.\n\nHire unemployed veterans as armed guards\n\nby Curtis, 12th grade, Anderson, Indiana\n\nWe need to have some restrictions and make it a little harder to get guns. One of the first restrictions we need is definitely a mental health screening. With a more comprehensive system for reporting mental health issues and conducting background checks, we can avoid putting guns in the hands of people who pose threats to themselves or others. Another thing that we need to have, and this goes for inside as well as outside of schools, is an armed guard. I personally think we should hire unemployed veterans. In 2016, the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans was just over 5 percent , or 453,000 people. We should make the job of protecting our schools available to these men and women.\n\nSchool shootings have become normal, but they shouldn't be\n\nby Isabelle, 12th grade, Joliet, Illinois\n\nIt's surprising to me that even talking about stricter gun laws makes people uncomfortable, simply because it seems to be the one obstacle our country faces in becoming safer. Stronger implementation of background checks when trying to purchase a gun is essential. Active-shooter drills should take place in every school. Threats to schools need to be taken more seriously by school administrators. I hear about too many threats being easily dismissed. Students should have weekly locker checks and doors around the building should be locked at all times. It makes me sick suggesting such precautions, mainly because school shootings have become normal, and they shouldn't be.\n\nThis is how to save the future today\n\nby Tanvi, 12th grade, Barrington, Illinois\n\nMany say that the immediate solution is gun control. However, in the face of slow legislative change and deepening cultural trends, what we need is a social shift. Our society is too filled with intolerance and “taboo” conversations, including mental health, gender roles and bullying. By fostering acceptance and fighting intolerance in school, we can take action instantaneously, focusing on the problem rather than political parties, and positively influencing social culture as a whole.\n\nTeachers are our role models. All it takes is one conversation and one teacher to set off the spark. A teacher could walk into their class tomorrow and start a discussion about a difficult, divisive issue that students face and adults shy away from. This is how to save the future today.\n\nParents and schools should monitor social media\n\nby Kaileigh, ninth grade, Binghamton, New York\n\nI think there are a lot of hints posted on social media about future events that the individual is planning. I also believe that parents could help keep their kids safe by monitoring their social media accounts for hints of dangerous or unhealthy behavior.However, students are afraid to go to school personnel if they suspect such a thing. I think this mindset also needs to change. Students need to talk with guidance counselors more often.\n\nHow school psychologists could help end bullying\n\nby Jeremiah, 11th grade, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania\n\nBesides putting more restrictions on guns, we could end or lower school shootings by having more psychologists in schools. These mental health experts could randomly rotate and observe students in their natural settings, like classrooms, lunches and gyms. They could spot students who may be prone to self-harm. It could possibly help save people from not only ending their lives but ending the lives of others. Plus, having more mental health professionals in schools could raise awareness for the amazing science and role of psychology. Lastly, this could put an end to bullying because the psychologists could pinpoint the bullies, and help the school find out why they are acting out.\n\nHigher levels of security are needed\n\nby Mykayla, 11th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nI can't stop thinking about the shooting in Parkland. I go to school every day, and knowing anybody could walk in and do the same thing all over, is not right. Given the prevalence of mass shootings, a higher level of security is needed at each and every school. Each and every part of the school should be monitored, and everyone who comes in should be checked from top to bottom. No child who attends school in order to learn should be hurt.\n\nGuns are a right, but not all kinds are necessary\n\nby Jared, 11th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nI believe that guns we should be able to have guns, but there are certain types, including assault weapons, that shouldn’t be available for citizens to own. Plus, not allowing easy access to guns would make it harder for the people who want to commit these shootings to get ahold of these weapons. While there is the argument that if they want to kill or harm people, they will find a way no matter what, something I agree with myself, at least we can reduce the chances of this happening.\n\nChange starts with the citizens of this country\n\nby Danika, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nThe issue is a person who never should have been allowed to purchase a gun was able to use that gun against innocent people. People who were just going to school. School, a place every child in America is required by law to attend. School, a place where people are free to expand their knowledge and embrace creativity. School, the place where I am writing this from and talking about gun control. How was this man able to buy this gun in the first place? What is the government doing to protect these children? We must have change and that starts with the citizens of this country.\n\nSchool safety should include stronger infrastructure\n\nby Destyne, 12th grade, Frankton, Indiana\n\nMany students are scared to go school and their parents are also scared. More safety precautions need to be taken at schools, including installing metal detectors and bulletproof windows and doors. Depending on the size of the school, at least three to five armed security guards need to be at each school. When it comes to purchasing a gun, a person should have to take a test to show that they have general knowledgeable about gun safety as well as a test to show they know handle a firearm. Right now, gun regulations are very lenient, and it is almost feels as if the government does not really care who purchases a firearm.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/257306272\n\n“We seem to be pushed aside a lot in these political situations and this time I think that we are making it known that we are the future,” says Kim Leadholm, a high schooler in Black River Falls, Wisconsin, and member of PBS NewsHour Student Reporting Labs program.\n\nHow a manmade machine reflects America's ugly side\n\nby Chloe, 9th grade, Patchogue, New York\n\nModern firearms have been around for over 100 years and somehow the laws to go along with them are still up for debate. How can we possibly have gotten this far as a civilization only to be threatened by a manmade machine? As a country, we must bring light to the uglier side of the United States.\n\nSecurity guards should be mandatory\n\nby Rylee, 8th grade, Pearl City, Hawaii\n\nAmerica is supposed to stand for things like freedom, equality, justice and hope, but with all of the gun violence and school shootings, how can America stand for any of those things? There are parents who are terrified to send their children off to school because they don't know if they will see them again. One solution could be for our government to write a law saying that every school in the nation will need security guards to patrol the campus. If we don't make a change, gun violence will continue to get worse.\n\nNumber of rounds is a key issue\n\nby Guari, 12th grade, Binghamton, New York\n\nI am not against people having guns as long as they are in good hands, but why does someone need an AR-15 with a 30+ round clip? If you want to own a gun like that, then there should be gun ranges where you can go to practice and leave it there before you leave. There is no real reason to have one in a household.\n\nNo problem can be solved in an instant, but we need to try\n\nby Kaiya, 11th grade, Gretna, Nebraska\n\nAs much as I’d like for guns to be gone, I don’t believe that idea is tangible. Prohibiting certain products just raises people's interests in them. However, by making it harder to obtain a gun through routine background checks and psychiatric evaluations, we can cut down on gun violence. No problem can be solved in an instant, but it is time to begin trying.\n\nThe silent majority needs to speak up\n\nby Drew, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nThey say that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Yet schools teach their students about events like Columbine and 9/11, and somehow it just happens again. I cannot sit here and think that people just don’t care, because that would be a dark world to live in. If all the people who cared took five minutes to just sit and think, I bet someone could figure something out. It’s time the silent majority stood up and made their voices heard, then turn to their politicians and really push to make a change.\n\nShooter shouldn't have been able to get a gun\n\nby Isabelle, 12th grade, Grand Rapids, Michigan\n\nWe cannot fight gun violence with more guns, and arming teachers is not the answer. The Second Amendment was put in place to establish protection for the American people against British tyranny. With the amount of government spending on our nation’s defense, this threat is not present. I am not arguing that all guns need to be removed, but instead, more actions need to be taken to keep them out of the wrong hands. The suspected shooter in Parkland had been reported to the FBI for suspicious actions and expelled from his school. He shouldn’t have had the means to attain a semi-automatic weapon.\n\nIn the immediate term, given the new wrinkle in the school shooting crisis, involving pulling the fire alarm to get students into the open, new precautionary measures need to be implemented. Students need to be taught more meaningful drills and preventive actions need to be taken about possible threats.\n\nI plan to hold my elected representatives accountable.\n\nby Maya, 12th grade, Palo Alto, California\n\nI will be eligible to vote for the first time this year, and I plan to hold my elected representatives accountable.\n\nSeventeen people are dead, and I am no longer willing to listen to lawmakers who deem my life less valuable than a piece of metal and claim that these events are simply unavoidable.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections have already begun. I plan to vote for candidates who support logic and reason and not those who show an unwillingness to compromise, or who deem that a civilian’s right to own a military-grade weapon is more important than a child’s right to receive an education free of violence.\n\nResponsible gun ownership, yes, but this isn't happening\n\nby Hannah, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nA buyer must pass a background check when buying a firearm in a store. This usually takes no more than a few minutes. If a buyer attends a gun show, however, no background check is necessary. In the attack in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine people were killed, the shooter was legally able to buy a .45-caliber Glock at a store. He passed his background check despite being arrested earlier that year for trespassing and drug possession. No safeguards were in place to take into account the racist symbols and comments made on social media. The messages might have indicated that such a hate-based crime could take place. I believe there is such a thing as responsible gun ownership, but this is not the way to get there.\n\nID cards should be worn by everyone inside schools\n\nby Michael, Flint, Michigan\n\nI believe that schools across the country should be more protected after all the school shootings we have had so far in 2018. I think it’s time for school leaders and government officials to take action to acquire higher-quality technology. Students within their schools should be required to wear their school IDs. Teachers as well. For the students who are expelled and teachers who have left or been fired, it’s best to deactivate their IDs immediately. America needs to take action now before another school is involved in a shooting.\n\nTreat one another as you would like to be treated\n\nby Blanca, 12th grade, Alta Loma, California\n\nI understand that owning guns is a right that we Americans have through the Bill of Rights. Still, I find it devastating to know that a person, whether male or female, young or old, is capable of harming another human being without taking the time to think through the consequences of their actions. I also find it troubling that us as a people, including students, mistreat one another enough to cause someone to fill up with so much anger and hate, that they carry out a school shooting. It all comes back to us and how we treat one another, along with speaking up when it comes to something that doesn't seem right, whether it be on social media, in school, out of school, wherever.\n\nI risk my life each day so I can learn about the Second Amendment\n\nby Holly, 11th grade, Vancouver, Washington\n\nThe total number of homicide deaths in the US in 2014 was 15,872. The number caused by a firearm was 11,008 . Though it’s true that people kill with or without firearms, it is also true that they overwhelmingly prefer to kill with one. These weapons give the attacker considerable distance between themselves and their assailant, or victim in these cases, minimizing retaliation. Guns do not kill people, but when awful people intend to kill people, guns are the easiest way for them to do so.\n\nIn the 44 days between January 1st and February 14th of 2018, there were seven firearm attacks inside schools or on school grounds during school hours, and five resulting in injury or death. One attack with a firearm per week in American schools on average.\n\nI don't want to get my education in a cement building with metal doors and armed guards wandering empty halls. I want the shooters who threaten our lives to rot in those places. That is called a prison. What I want is to feel safe knowing that the people who have guns are people who we trust to have guns in the event we need to form a militia, like was intended when the Second Amendment was written. I risked my life to learn that. I went to class.\n\nEvery teacher should have a stun gun\n\nby Jenna, 11th grade, Jension, Michigan\n\nThe gun control laws are almost good enough to keep schools and Americans safe. The major flaw with gun control laws would have to be the places where guns are not allowed. Think about where shootings happen. Schools, churches, concerts, etc. What do these places have in common? They are places where guns are not allowed. The innocent are defenseless. I'm not saying anyone should be allowed to carry a gun around school, but a stun gun should be given to each teacher to store somewhere safe in case of a shooting. A stun gun will make the shooter fall and drop the gun in time for someone to take the gun away-- hopefully with no casualties, not even the shooter. I am also concerned that an eighteen-year-old is allowed to purchase a gun. Most 18-year-olds are still in high school living with their parents. Plus, the average teen’s brain (the rational part of the brain) won’t be fully developed until age twenty-five.\n\nI support gun rights, just not AR-15s\n\nby Reece, 12th grade, Mayfield, Pennsylvania\n\nIn light of the recent high school shooting in Florida, I believe we need stricter laws on obtaining guns. Coming from a family of hunters in Northeastern Pennsylvania, I do support the Second Amendment. That being said, I do not support semi-automatic guns, like the AR-15. We hear the argument “good guys with guns can stop bad guys with guns” everyday, but what happens when the good guy with a gun is overpowered by the bad guy with a gun? A retrofitted AR-15 can shoot about 400 rounds per minute. Scary right? There is absolutely no need for a gun with that much power.\n\nWhere I come from, a lot of people love to hunt. I have not heard one single person tell me they use the AR-15 for that. Most people said “it’s fun to shoot” or, “I want to be properly armed if someone enters my home.” Nikolas Cruz could not even legally purchase alcohol, but it was perfectly legal for him to buy that gun.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nby Summer, 12th grade, Derby, Kansas\n\n[Note: Several students who submitted pieces are editors and writers for their school newspaper. We included an edited version of Summer's piece as a reminder of the role that young journalists play in covering the news.]\n\nJust a few days after the Parkland shooting, MSD student Carly Novel, who began this post, tweeted : “We don’t want higher fences and metal detectors. We don’t want our teachers to have guns. We don’t want to go to school in a prison. We want CHANGE. We want genuine, lasting change.”\n\nThe students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have joined with other shooting survivors and sympathizers to demand gun reform. Their goal is to be the last mass shooting.\n\nReaching even farther than Parkland, a number of protests are being organized to protest current gun laws including a march in Washington D.C on March 24 and student walkouts on March 14 and April 20 , the 19th anniversary of Columbine.\n\nHow an archaic 'right' forces students to watch videos about AR-15s\n\nby Eva, 11th grade, Greenville, North Carolina\n\nWe live in danger every day because of an archaic law made in the days of our country’s origin. An archaic law that requires students in America today to sit in school, watching videos that prompt us on what to do if someone comes into school with an AR-15 and opens fire.\n\nThe Second Amendment states that U.S. citizens should have the right to bear arms and form militias. But as technology now allows hundreds of rounds to be fired off in under a minute -- something the Founders could never have envisioned -- and our military is now made up of an all-volunteer force, the need for this amendment has become unnecessary.\n\nHow age and mental health affects the right to bear arms\n\nby Murphy, 9th grade, Greenville, North Carolina\n\nAccording to Florida’s gun regulations, one does not need a permit or license to purchase a gun nor to register a firearm. Our right to bear arms is authorized in Amendment II of the Constitution. But should that right be applied to all? If a person is not old enough to be able to rent a car or buy a beer, then he should not be allowed to legally purchase a deadly weapon. Especially those who suffer from severe mental illness. Rather than banning something that will protect us from future attackers, the government should implement proper background checks to ensure that people like Nikolas Cruz will never obtain a weapon.\n\nGuilty Congressmen and incompetent leaders\n\nby Elizabeth, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nHow many more people have to die before our government officials wake up and see the power that they hold in their hands? They have the power to save the lives of children and adults but do nothing more than send sorry tweets. These are the condolences of guilty Congressmen and incompetent government leaders. We are through with being neglected by our leaders and “representatives.” Our lives are worth more than the outdated idea that gun ownership is a right.\n\nGun control might create an even bigger problem\n\nby Alyssa, 8th grade, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nI do not think that reversing the Second Amendment is a good idea. This amendment keeps many people safe. It is a way for people to protect themselves in case of emergencies. The problem is not the gun, but the person holding the gun. Gun control might create an even bigger problem. How would the government take away all the guns that people already have? What if a person had not given up possession of their gun, leaving schools unable to defend themselves? What would the government do then? We shouldn’t have to be scared to go to our own school.\n\nIt's time to reinstate the federal assault weapons ban\n\nby Richard, 12th grade, Canoga Park, California\n\nI have felt that Congress has failed us ever since Sandy Hook. After every mass shooting since then, I have found myself only more disappointed at Congress’ inability to act. The evidence, including cross-national studies, and the victims, all tell us we need stricter gun control in America. We also need a Congress who is not afraid of the gun lobbies and ensures kids are safe at school. A Congress that ensures dangerous weapons stay out of the wrong hands. It’s time for Congress to reinstate its federal ban on assault weapons and strengthen its universal background check system.\n\nThe phrase “school shooting” shouldn’t exist\n\nby Mary, 12th grade, Manville, Rhode Island\n\nDuring lockdown drills, we are taught to hide, silently, and to hope that the shooter thinks that we aren’t there. Students in every state across America are required to participate in them. My six-year old brother does them, my thirteen-year old sister does them and I do them. They have become as routine as the calls for\"hopes and prayers\" by politicians after a school shooting, a phrase that shouldn’t exist.\n\nThis generation, led by these courageous survivors of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, are doing what adults should have done years ago. We are stepping up to the plate to ensure that the phrase “school shooting” has no reason to be put in the same sentence again.\n\nAvoid becoming too wrapped up in the media\n\nby Sarah, 10th grade, Greenville, North Carolina\n\nOne way to prevent school shootings is not to get too wrapped up in the media. We should only report new stories we know are a serious threat and always check the facts. Many people in the U.S. have differing opinions on gun violence, however, one thing remains the same: We all know that it is wrong to kill innocent students who are just trying to have a normal day of learning at school. We all know it is wrong to kill teachers who are just trying to do their job.\n\nSaving lives isn't a partisan issue\n\nby Sydney, 12th grade, Barrington, Illinois\n\nAssault rifles and bump stocks should be banned. Just because some people like using cocaine doesn't mean we let them use it legally, so we shouldn't let people have assault rifles just because they like to go hunting. In addition, any loopholes that allow individuals to bypass background checks should be taken away. According to Gallup , 60 percent of the U.S. wants stricter gun control. Saving the lives of other human beings shouldn't be a partisan issue. We don't allow people to keep grenades in their basement, and we shouldn't allow individuals to keep battlefield guns in their homes.\n\nGrace, 12th grade, Barrington, Illinois\n\nI’d like to remind those within the federal government of the preamble of the United States Constitution. Specifically, the government’s job to insure domestic tranquility and promote the general welfare. Currently, our leaders are doing neither, which makes me ask: am I next?\n\nWhen politicians place the NRA above their constitutional duty to safeguard our lives, we are losing the fight to preserve our democracy. We need those in power to strengthen federal regulations on gun control.\n\nPerhaps anyone interested in purchasing a firearm should follow the same steps required of a woman who needs to access an abortion or birth control. In several states, this includes: a mandatory waiting period, mandatory counseling, a physician’s approval, written information detailing the risks involved, and follow-up appointments.\n\nMy birth control should not be harder to access than an AR-15. Currently, it is, which makes me wonder: am I next?\n\nIf mental health is the root cause of gun violence, then why haven't lawmakers done anything about it?\n\nby Sireen, 10th grade, Greenville, North Carolina\n\nSoon after taking office, President Donald Trump repealed an Obama-era regulation that would have prevented individuals with certain types of mental illnesses from buying a gun.\n\nThe media constantly quotes lawmakers talking about how the mass shootings are about mental health issues instead of acts of terrorism. But if this is the case, why did politicians decide to repeal an act that could have stopped what they believe to be the cause of all of these shootings?\n\nSeventeen people who all had hopes and dreams\n\nby Nawal, 12th grade, Barrington, Illinois\n\nAlyssa Alhadeff, Scott Beigel, Martin Duque Anguiano, Nicholas Dworet, Aaron Feis, Jaime Guttenberg, Chris Hixon, Luke Hoyer, Cara Loughran, Gina Montalto, Joaquin Oliver, Alaina Petty, Meadow Pollack, Helena Ramsay, Alex Schachter, Carmen Schentrup, and Peter Wang. These are the 17 victims who were killed as a result of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. These are 17 innocent people who all had hopes and dreams and did not deserve to die.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, “the United States has one of the highest rates of death by firearm in the developed world.” Although some people use guns for hobbies like hunting, we have to draw the line somewhere. The AR-15, the gun used by Cruz, continually reappears as a common weapon used by the suspects of mass shootings. Why should we provide someone with mental health issues a gun, let alone a semiautomatic weapon?\n\nI support the Second Amendment, but the NRA has gone too far\n\nby Behr, 12th grade, Overland Park, Kansas\n\nThe right to bear arms is one of the most important amendments, but when it comes to the safety of civilians and especially of children, something needs to be done. Through lobbying and donations of millions of dollars to Congress, the National Rifle Association continually does everything in its power to keep gun rights firmly secured. I don’t think the purchase of a weapon needs to be so strict that it becomes impossible for an average citizen to buy a firearm. But thorough background checks at gun shows and online seem to make sense to me. I’m not naïve enough to think that money and politics don’t play a significant role in Congress, but when it comes to the lives of innocent children, they should play a significantly less role than our actual government.\n\nTighter security all around would go a long way\n\nby Kaitlyn, 12th grade, Gretna, Nebraska\n\nProviding teachers with weapons could worsen the situation. A teacher could use a firearm against students or the students may be able to gain access to the gun in the classroom. Instead, teachers should be required to have shades on their windows, conduct regular drills rather than just twice a year and attend programs to learn what to do in an active intruder situation and then share the strategies with students. More cameras should be installed, a police officer should be posted on campus and technological advancements should be made in school security equipment. Schools should also require background checks on students as well as their ability to access guns.\n\nMSD students have taken a page from their school's activist namesake\n\nby Michelle, 11th grade, San Jose, California\n\nI also learned that Marjory Stoneman Douglas was a journalist and activist for many causes throughout the 20th century – feminism, anti-racism and conservation among them. In a time when so many voices were silenced, she spoke up in order to promote the causes that she deeply believed in. The students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High have already taken a page from her book, speaking out against the cycle of violence, grief and inactivity. Perhaps it is time that we do so too.\n\nI know it's wrong, but I judge others\n\nby Elizabeth, 11th grade, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nI tend to judge. I walk through the hallways at school and see each person for who they are on the outside. Although I know this is wrong, I feel it could be useful knowing the events that have occurred recently in schools. I feel I have a grasp on the people who are safe and those who trigger a gut reaction to move. To me, this is useful, as everyday I take the path from my car to the school entrance, knowing this is the same walk a shooter would take. Many schools across the country are easy to get into. Doors are often unlocked and entrances are left unmonitored. Anyone could walk in with a gun in their pocket and not be stopped. So what do I do? I don’t let it get the best of me because you can't live your life in fear.\n\nSounds of students' uproar\n\nby Aimee, 11th grade, Aurora, Illinois\n\nWhen I was elementary school, I didn’t have to worry about someone coming into my school with an AR-15. If anything, I had to worry about if I was going to get a smiley sticker on my popsicle stick for being a good student that day. A decade later, as a junior in high school, I never thought I would be having class conversations about school shootings and what we would do if we had one. I never would have expected my teacher to tell me that they will do anything in their power to protect their students. I also never thought I would hear the sounds of students uproar. Students are organizing walkouts to protest inefficient gun laws and continuous broken promises from our President. We are tired of our voices being ignored. Something has to be done.\n\nWe need to change our pro-gun culture\n\nby Justin, 11th grade, Medford, New York\n\nOfficials in high government positions who receive donations from the NRA should be ashamed of themselves. Gun homicide rates are 25.2 times higher in the U.S. than in other high-income countries. In many northern European countries and even our neighbor Canada, strict gun control laws are in place and the gun violence and homicide rates are low. Weapons should be reserved for those who work either in the military, police or security. These are lessons that need to be learned in school in conjunction with an anti-gun framework to develop in future generations.\n\nLocal communities need to take more action\n\nby Gianna, 12th grade, Alta Loma, California\n\nThe reality of it is, no matter how many laws are put in place, guns will be found and used. Laws are only useful to the people who obey them. However, where and when they are used can be more controlled. The country looks to the President to take action, but it can start in own our schools and homes. Social media can be observed with a more cautious eye, both by the district and the community. Further proactive approaches such as active shooter training, randomized searches, and implementation of psychology evaluations can all minimize the reality of school shootings. Media also plays a crucial role in school shootings by giving them a massive amount of attention. They should suppress any attempts by the shooters for attention and remove any potential glorification from the lives of these criminals.\n\nLet's start with some real gun control\n\nby Whitney, 11th grade, Cottleville, Missouri\n\nPeople who don't support gun control will find every reason they can to explain school shootings: mental illness, bullying and so on. Yes, those are the shooter’s fuel, but ask yourselves: Could he have done that much damage with a knife? Could he have hurt that many people with his bare hands? I understand guns are not the sole blame for these tragedies, but I also understand that we need better gun control. To own a gun, people should have in-depth background checks, be approved by a doctor, and have to go through specific training like with a driver's license. Some may argue that even with stricter gun control, people will still find ways to get guns, like how people have found ways to get weed and other illegal drugs, but so what? Stricter gun control is still a pretty good start at a safer future for America's youth.\n\nRELATED: Students who support gun rights say schools safer when ‘good guys’ are armed\n\nDon't ignore signs about a person's mental health\n\nby Ginger, 9th grade, Greenville, North Carolina\n\nAfter each mass shooting, authorities investigate what could have been done to prevent such a horrific event. Others point to those who might have chosen to speak up and take action. In the most recent school shooting, it was quickly discovered that Nikolas Cruz had a history of threatening behavior and easy access to firearms. Many who knew him recognized that he was troubled and mentioned disturbing messages Cruz had made on social media. Even the FBI admitted to ignoring a warning that Cruz might attack a school, just weeks before the shooting rampage. This massacre may have been prevented if the government had been able to prevented the gunman from obtaining weapons, if it had taken more action.\n\nWe need to be kinder to each other\n\nby Kinadi, 11th grade, Covington, Georgia\n\nJust one day after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, several kids were caught with guns at different schools nearby to where I live. Several of my peers attended those same schools. It easily could’ve been my school. Yes, here in America, we have the right to bear arms, because at the time the Second Amendment was written, we had just fought a revolution. A weapon that was used to overthrow a colonial power in 1789, is now being used on students sitting in school, trying to learn.\n\nBetter regulation of guns would help, but if there are too many loopholes, shootings are likely to still happen. One thing I know we should do is to be kind to one other. Kindness goes a long way, and if we all made a little more effort to be kinder, maybe less shootings would occur, maybe those who need help won’t go straight for the trigger.\n\nGun control involves a little more paperwork, not taking away anyone's rights\n\nby Gabrielle, Joliet, Illinois\n\nIn the face of tragedy, rational thought often gets thrown out the window and people begin to panic, trying to make things happen that would probably only make things worse. For example, arming teachers and staff isn’t going to help anything. It’s just going to make those who want stricter gun control laws even angrier and make the possibility of those guns getting into the wrong hands even greater.\n\nMore security in schools could be a start. Having all students walk through metal detectors every morning is excessive, but necessary, at least for the time being. There has been talk of having older military veterans inside the schools, which could at least give parents some peace of mind. Stricter gun laws could also help. This doesn’t mean that everyone’s right to bear arms is going to be taken away. It just means a little more paperwork to make it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands.\n\nResearch would allow for stronger, smarter gun policy\n\nby Madison, 12th grade, Anderson, Indiana\n\nAs times have changed since passage of the 2nd Amendment, so do state and federal gun laws. Take ammunition, for example. If magazines were limited to ten, the shooter would have to carry more magazines. In the event of an attack, the police would have more time to do whatever was needed to stop the shooter. Other preventative measures include requiring gun safety classes in public school, so that students would be more prepared to use and handle situations involving guns, and conducting more research. In 1996, federal gun research was stopped and the funds were transferred to another department. If research on gun control was resumed, and we saw new statistics on gun purchases and learned more about the demographics of those gun manufacturers are most likely to target, we could create gun policy that address the issue head on.\n\nWe didn't blame Samsung users when their phones exploded\n\nby Megan, 11th grade, Jenison, Michigan\n\nMany people argue that conversations about gun control are not an appropriate response to a school shooting. They encourage others to send thoughts and prayers, but nothing else. In many other areas of tragedy or discomfort, people are quick to demand reform and regulations. When the Samsung Note 7 phones were catching on fire in people’s pockets, we didn’t blame them for using their phones or send them thoughts and prayers. Instead, we demanded that Samsung take care of the issue and make sure that their phones no longer had the potential to harm their customers. Unfortunately, this is not how the use of guns is viewed in our country. This thinking needs to change.\n\nIt comes down to ethics\n\nby Tommy, 11th grade, Barrington, Illinois\n\nA majority of the country, 59 percent , say they are dissatisfied with the nation's gun laws, up 5 percent from last year, according to Gallup. Yet this trend counters the voting record displayed by our \"representative\" leaders. I’m not asking for an outright ban on guns. I just think some restrictions to stop violent individuals and suspected terrorists (who've been placed on government watch lists) from purchasing weapons is the moral thing to do.\n\nWe'd be better off if the gun did pull the trigger\n\nby Jasmuan, high school student, Interlochen, Michigan\n\nI live in a small city in Michigan. Since we are a little out of the loop, I am able to see the faults in both parties. On one hand, there are old Congressmen who believe that changing gun laws will make the situation very similar to prohibition, because let's face it, Americans are raised believing they can have everything and do anything they please.\n\nSimilarly to today, we raise children to think that because several school shootings have taken place and violence is romanticized, that this is a perfectly normal way to live. That it’s completely plausible for a shooter to come to their school and kill children. After all, it’s something the adults have trained them for -- children are no longer taught to hide from bombs, but to hide under their dead classmate just to survive. Which is why I stand with the students. In a video I watched a young girl say that she didn’t want to be another statistic. She wanted things to change, and she wanted politicians to stop sweeping the topic under the rug because, “It’s not the right time.” No amount of time is going to change how much Americans have been taught to embrace violence. We'd be better off if the gun did pull the trigger.\n\nUnderstand the big picture\n\nby Shadayah, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nWe should look at the bigger picture rather than debate specific gun laws, like age requirements. A 21-year old can make the same mistakes as an 18-year old, and many people commit murder over the age of 21. The Florida school shooting was a terrible tragedy, and my prayers go out to the families involved. But sadly, the attack had little to do with guns and everything to do with the heart. We live in a world full of hate and division, and there is little respect and tolerance for those of differing opinions. We all have our opinions on what should be done about the shootings, but most importantly we should show compassion for the families who just lost their children.\n\nWhere would the money to arm teachers come from?\n\nby Emma, Traverse City, Michigan\n\nOne of the proposed solutions to arm teachers so they can fight off a school shooter has a lot of problems. Where would the money come from to do that? Would the government (state or federal?) pitch in or would it be an unfunded mandate? The ability to take down another person with a gun safely requires lots of training. Would that be paid for as well? On top of all that, the ability to take down an active shooter isn't exactly in the job title or description of teacher . Their main purpose is to educate students. Plus, not everyone would want to carry a gun in the first place. At the end of the day, I would rather have the security that individuals with questionable backgrounds cannot receive guns over the off chance that one of my teachers will be brave enough -- and a good enough shot -- to fend off a murderer.\n\nI have been alive for 24 fatal school shootings\n\nEmma, 12th grade, Joliet, Illinois\n\nIn my 18 years, I have been alive for 24 fatal school shootings . I was born nearly seven months after Columbine, and therefore for every year I have lived there has been at least one mass shooting at an elementary or high school in America. In addition to fatal school shootings, I have lived through shootings at nightclubs, churches, movie theaters and concerts. I have prayed and cried for the victims; hated the perpetrators, and signed every petition to the government I have come across.\n\nI hope that there is someone, some politician, who will finally see the obvious problem with America’s gun policy and change it. The key word here is “change.” To completely eradicate the Second Amendment would be unethical, but why can’t there be changes? Why should someone looking to purchase an assault rifle not be thoroughly background checked? Why can an 18-year-old not purchase a drink, but can purchase a weapon with the capability of killing hundreds?\n\nIn the U.S., we shouldn't be afraid to go out in public\n\nby Skylar, 12th grade, St. Peters, Missouri\n\nAnd as I scroll down my Twitter feed, seeing this list of 17 names over and over and over again, I can’t help but wonder, why not me? There’s no reason that the shooting in Parkland, Florida didn’t happen at my high school, that these 17 people weren’t my friends, my teachers. We as a country should not be afraid of going to school or going out in public, afraid of those around us who may or may not be dangerous or toting a gun bought under lax regulations. We have to take action now. If we don’t, we’ll have another tragedy on our hands within a month — another list of names of those who didn’t survive.\n\nI have one teacher who has talked with me about school shootings\n\nby Eric, 9th grade, Barrington, Illinois\n\nOne of my siblings has special needs. How am I supposed to know if she’s going to be safe if an attack were to occur? Schools need to be sure they have specific procedures in place for students like my sister. At my school, my global studies teacher is the only teacher I know who has talked about school shootings and lockdowns. She has been exceptionally helpful in discussing the issue of gun violence. It has helped me to be as prepared as I can be, if something were to occur.\n\nWe need more funding for mental health\n\nby Austin, 11th grade, Alexandria, Virginia\n\nInstead of attacking guns directly, Congress should come up with a compromise plan. It should include a task force specifically designed to cut down on illegal ways to obtain weapons and increased funding for mental health. When it boils down to it, whether it be a soldier suffering from PTSD or a teenager with depression or anxiety, our government simply does not do enough when it comes to funding mental health.\n\nMilitary-style weapons do not belong in the hands of civilians\n\nby Cassie, 6th grade, Westfield, New Jersey\n\nI would like to know how the President plans to protect the citizens of this country from those citizens who own military-style weapons -- military-style weapons whose main purpose is to kill.\n\nIn the U.S., where citizens can buy a gun with ease and very little gun regulation, has 32,850 deaths due to gun violence a year. Meanwhile, Japan has a 10-step rigorous gun buying process and has only 10 deaths per year due to gun violence. This isn't a coincidence. If we institute similar gun control as Japan, then maybe we can prevent the untimely deaths of students and teachers and all citizens. If one person tried to bring a bomb on a plane, and now passengers must take their shoes off to get through security, we can pass gun reform.\n\nHow could you ask teachers to handle a gun?\n\nClara, 11th grade, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nIt was fourth period, and I was dissecting a pig's heart in the lab. I was making jokes with classmates when the fire alarm started to blare and an uneasy feeling came over my classmates and I. We froze and looked at our teacher, as he hesitated to say, “Drop your things and go.”\n\n“Is this a repeat of the Stoneman shooting?” we asked ourselves. We later found out that it was simply a “faulty smoke detector.”\n\nAccording to Axios, 122 people have died in school shootings since Columbine in 1999. It’s time for change. It was time 18 years ago.\n\nLately, the idea of arming teachers has surfaced in many news outlets. What will fighting fire with fire solve? Nothing. This puts students like me in the crossfire and burdens teachers with a responsibility that they never should have been asked to take on. School security doesn’t need to be upped and teachers don’t need to be armed. I’m not going to prison. I’m going to school.\n\nThis generation will take up the mantle of leadership\n\nby Alvin, 11th grade, Jacksonville, Florida\n\nThe massacre in Newtown, Connecticut was the first time that I was able to form an understanding of a school shooting . I learned that 20 children and six educators had been robbed of their futures and would not be returning to walk the halls of their school. Since then, I have learned about many mass shootings in schools and in other places where each person did not expect any danger and yet, their lives were ended. One would think that to witness this tragedy time and time again that our reactions would be muted, that we would grow numb in the face of adverse tragedy and pain. Honestly, that may be true for some, but not for me. With each one of these events that I witness, my emotional reaction intensifies. As our leaders do nothing, sacrificing the lives of children and adults for a brief glimpse of their names in the history books — names that will appear in infamy -- this generation will take up the mantle of leadership.\n\nParkland students have emerged as true leaders\n\nby Audrey, 12th grade, Woodbridge, Virginia\n\nDuring times like these, the nation looks to those in positions of authority to lead. When our President, government officials and even our schools are unable or refuse to lead, we have to create those leaders ourselves. The survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting have emerged as those leaders.\n\nThe MSD students are some of the most remarkable people I have ever seen. In between going to classmate's funerals, they have taken a stand. Their voices will not be silenced. The students are taking to social media and speaking at rallies in order to get their stories out. These teenagers are demanding change and are leading an entire generation to speak out and make our voices heard.\n\nChange the age to buy a firearm to 21\n\nby Sophia, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nThose in high levels of authority — including lawmakers and the President -- are not acting fast enough. Many teachers, students and parents are doing whatever in their power to help, but these groups can only do so much. It seems like every time there is a major issue that needs to be fixed right away, the president and all three branches of government work at a slow pace. Here is one solution they can start with: E very state should require individuals who want to buy a gun and obtain a firearm license to be over the age of 21.\n\nIt will take several solutions — changing gun laws is not one of them\n\nby Dominique, 12th grade, Flint, Michigan\n\nIf you want to make schools safer, changing guns laws is not going to do it. It's the people who pull the trigger who doe the killing. Instead, we need to tighten up security around the school and patrol all entrances, making sure they are locked at all times. There should be metal detectors located at two or more entrances. This might be more expensive, but it would help keep students safe while they’re at school. Students should also carry their student ID around at all times. Another way to keep students and staff safe from an active shooter is to report if you hear or see something concerning on social media to your principal, parent or the police. These authorities could prevent the problem from happening by talking to the individual or group of members and seeing what they can do to help.\n\nGuns have created a much larger public health problem than we want to admit\n\nBy Emma, 11th grade, Lake Zurich, Illinois\n\nWhat I don't understand is why this is what it takes for us to have a conversation. Out of the 90 Americans who lose their lives each day to gun violence, almost 60 of them commit suicide using a gun. Domestic violence killings occur behind closed doors all around us. Children are getting into their parents' gun cabinets with tragic results. I'm not saying we shouldn't be thinking about school violence, but I believe in acknowledging the more common, but no less deeply profound, gun tragedies that befall the nation every single day with little notice. Guns have created a much larger public health problem. Why on earth aren't we talking about it?\n\nElected leaders: The ball is in your court\n\nby Sachi, 8th grade, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nElected leaders have the ball in their court. Do they want to save more lives or not? Because it seems like everyone except our politicians cares about this issue. But as much as I blame Congress and state leaders in Florida for lax guns laws, I also blame the people who knew that Nikolas Cruz, a very troubled young man, owned a gun, and didn't take it away.\n\nSmall scale solutions that will make a difference\n\nby Diana, 11th Grade, Chicago, Illinois\n\nMany high school counseling departments are understaffed and forced to focus on numbers instead of student health. A parent of a high school student should know that when their child leaves for school, the student is safe and has access to mental help if needed, but that isn’t the reality in a lot of schools.\n\nMore funding is also needed for up-to-date security equipment in schools, another key part of school safety that suffers due to lack of funding. School administrators need to be sure that security cameras function properly, locks and doors close all the way and drills are routinely practiced. It can take a long time for government leaders to make decisions for a variety of reasons. These are changes that can happen right now.\n\nThis isn't how you treat children\n\nby Abby, high school student, Gretna, Nebraska\n\nWe are told that we are the next generation, the final hope for the future. If that's the case, it seems strange to put our lives at risk five days out of seven. Are we truly expected to be the greatest we can be knowing that our society has turned its back on us--for the sake of owning five or ten more guns?\n\nPolitical discussions often center around the livelihood of the children. Within debates about abortion, same sex marriage, transgender bathroom bills and even the use of vaccines, everyone appears to be very concerned about the well-being of each and every child. But not with gun control. With gun control, the lives of children are an afterthought. Innocent students are slaughtered at school, and we are just told that we must add more guns and hope that the “good guys” can shoot faster with more accuracy. Are we really so resistant to being proven wrong that we will let young students be massacred? In a country built on change, we must be willing to change -- even on this.\n\nI can see both sides of the issue\n\nby Landon, 12th grade, Anderson, Indiana\n\nI agree with certain aspects from each side of the gun debate.
