        "text": "The shootings at Sandy Hook\n\nAdam Lanza gathered the AR-15, two semiautomatic pistols, and a shotgun, as well as several hundred rounds of ammunition stored in high-capacity magazines, and drove his mother’s car to Sandy Hook Elementary School, a public school in Newtown for kindergarten through fourth grade. Leaving the shotgun in the car, Lanza shot his way through a window next to the school’s locked security door just after 9:30 am. He was immediately confronted by Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung and school psychologist Mary Sherlach. Lanza shot and killed both women, but the encounter and the sounds of gunfire were broadcast to individual classrooms via the school’s public address system. In accordance with previously established lockdown protocols, teachers immediately took steps to attempt to safeguard their students, concealing them in closets or bathrooms and barricading doors with furniture or with their own bodies.\n\nLanza entered the classroom of teacher Lauren Rousseau and killed her and 14 children. He then went to a second classroom, where first-grade teacher Victoria Soto had hidden her students in a closet. She attempted to misdirect Lanza by telling him that her class was in the school’s auditorium on the other side of the building. Lanza killed Soto, as well as six students who attempted to flee from their hiding place. Also killed in the shooting were Anne Marie Murphy, a special education aide, and behavioral therapist Rachel D’Avino; two other Sandy Hook staff members were injured. Lanza fired 154 rounds in less than five minutes, claiming 26 lives."
