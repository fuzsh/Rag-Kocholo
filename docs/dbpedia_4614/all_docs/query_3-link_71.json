        "text": "Prince George's County Police Chief Aziz said police are actively searching for the gunman who opened fire on a group, killing an 8-year-old PJ Evans in Landover, Maryland Tuesday night.\n\n\"I just want to make sure that we assure our citizens that we are working diligently to find the people responsible for this senseless, act of violence, where one of our youngest citizens were taken from us,\" Aziz said.\n\nHe said detectives are working around the clock to find the person responsible for the boy's death.\n\nRELATED |\n\n\"They've done a phenomenal job in the past of bringing people like this to justice, so they can answer up to crimes like this that they have committed,\" Aziz said.\n\nThe child died Tuesday night, in the 1600 block of Brightseat Road. Police said a man drove up in a white sedan and began firing shots at a group of adults gathered outside of a home. The boy was struck and killed by a bullet. Police said he was not an intended target.\n\nHe said this shooting hit very close to home because many of the officers have children, \"the pain is real.\"\n\n\"He worked hard and so smart. Truly had a bright future.\" Those who knew PJ had nothing but glowing remarks about the boy's character.\n\nSEE ALSO |\n\nPJ's mother Tiffani Evans somehow found the strength to speak to 7 News Wednesday. She says there is one reason: she wants her son Peyton John Evans to be remembered.\n\n“My son was 8-years-old. He was born on Valentine’s Day 2013. My son loved God. He loved his family. He loved his friends. He loved his teammates,\" she said through tears. \"If I can’t stress nothing out here man, love on y’all kids. I loved my son and before my son closed his eyes, 10 minutes before he closed his eyes, I said, ‘Boy I love you. You played a hell of a game in that scrimmage.’\"\n\n\"My son was a straight-A student. He had 2 B’s! You understand me? But he worked his a-- off, excuse my French. My son was a mathematician. He loved math. That was his thing. My son is in heaven and I know it because he loved the Lord!” she said.\n\nAlthough he was only eight years old, Tiffani Evans says he was a superstar to her. On Tuesday night, he was doing what many little kids do -- playing video games as her mom visited a relative in an apartment on Brighseat Road near FedEx Field when somebody in a white car outside opened fire. A shot carried through a sliding glass door and hit PJ.\n\nThe police say they have leads but no arrest yet. Chief Aziz urged the killer to turn himself in. Aziz speaking to the killer directly said, “Turn yourself in and be the man you weren’t last night as you shot without regard for your actions.”\n\nTiffani Evans wants justice but mostly she wants you to know about PJ.\n\n“My son had a bright future. He had a lot of people that loved him and I just want y’all to know, love on y’all kids,\" she added.\n\nChief Aziz said he spoke to Tiffany Evans Tuesday night and assured her that they would bring her justice.\n\n\"My prayers and thoughts are with them,\" he added and said they have some promising leads, but that it'll still be a long road ahead for the family.\n\n\"Just a happy little boy who loved playing football, his little ATV and shoes,” one friend said.\n\nHis former football coach Tony Barr told 7News that Evans \"was a great kid that just wanted to play football.\"\n\nAziz acknowledged that there's been an uptick in crime in Prince George's County, but said it's also a trend nationwide.\n\nSEE ALSO |\n\n\"There are many factors that go into it and I've spoken on this in the past with socio-economic conditions and conditions of greed, drug dealing, you know people who are looking to make victims of other people without doing it the legal way,\" Aziz said about the root cause of the violence. \"There are so many factors variables that go into why violence will uptick, why it will increase in any given jurisdiction.\"\n\nHe said the county police have made 600 weapon-related arrests this year alone and 900 guns were seized off the streets.\n\nPrince George's County Police officers have asked that anyone with information please call them at 1-866-411-TIPS."
