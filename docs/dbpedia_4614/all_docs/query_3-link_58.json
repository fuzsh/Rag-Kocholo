        "text": "A young drifter dressed in military fatigues opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle at children playing outside and others inside an elementary school today. Five children between 6 and 9 years old, all of them refugees from Southeast Asia, were killed and more than 30 people were wounded, about half of them critically, before the gunman shot himself to death.\n\nThe gunman, 24-year-old Patrick West, originally of Stockton, had an ''extensive criminal history'' but the police had ''no idea'' of a motive, said Lucian Neely, a Deputy Police Chief in this agricultural city 65 miles east of San Francisco.\n\n''He was just standing there with a gun, making wide sweeps,'' said Lori Mackey, who teaches deaf children at the Cleveland Elementary School.\n\nShe said she ran to her classroom window when she heard what she thought were firecrackers, and saw a man standing in the schoolyard, spraying gunfire from what turned out to be a Russian-designed AK-47 rifle. There were 400 to 500 pupils from the first to third grades playing at the noontime recess.\n\nShe said that when she realized what was happening, she took her 10 pupils into a rear room where they could not be seen.\n\n''He was not talking, he was not yelling, he was very straight-faced,'' she said of the gunman, whom she described as about 5 feet 10, with short blonde hair. ''It did not look like he was really angry; it was just matter-of-factly.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
