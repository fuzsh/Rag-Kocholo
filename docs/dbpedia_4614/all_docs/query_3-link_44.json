        "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Three kids, ages five to 11 years old, have been shot within the last two weeks bringing the total number of kids gunned down in Kansas City to seven so far in 2024.\n\nA boy under 10 years old is in critical condition after a shooting around 7 p.m. Wednesday near East 33rd Street and Bales Avenue by Central High School. The Kansas City Police Department said officers were in the area and heard several gunshots nearby. They found the boy on the sidewalk suffering gunshot injuries and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nJuvenile male in critical condition after shooting in KCMO\n\nA 5-year-old boy was killed in what police believe to be an accidental shooting near East 51st and Eastwood Trafficway. The child’s mother is shocked by it saying, off camera, her son, Mari Scott, just finished Kindergarten Round-Up on Monday.\n\nKCPD continue to investigate ‘accidental’ shooting of 5-year-old boy\n\nLast week, 11-year-old Kourtney Freeman was shot and killed inside her home on East 33rd and Flora Avenue. The Kauffman scholar was about to finish 6th grade. Her case remains unsolved. KC Crime Stoppers has issued a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in this case.\n\nCommunity demands answers in murder of 11-year-old Kourtney Freeman\n\n‘It’s senseless’: 11-year-old girl loses life after shot through KC home\n\nThe City of Kansas City, Missouri announced earlier this week that $300,000 in grant money from the Missouri Department of Public Safety and Department of Justice is being utilized to decrease gun violence in our city among other aspects of their criminal justice system.\n\nMayor Quinton Lucas spoke with KCTV5 about that money coming in just hours before the third shooting.\n\n“Our hope is that through any number of our grant efforts, we’re able to do things that give people, frankly, value in their own lives values, values in lives around them, invest in our young people in more situations, and do bring down this gun violence issue.”\n\nLucas brought up how other cities like St. Louis, Baltimore, and New York City have implemented ways to decrease their gun violence. It shows positive trends, according to Lucas, so the feeling is KC needs to be on that list -- not on the trend we are on now.\n\n“St. Louis and Baltimore saw 20% decreases in murders. A place like New York City in the late 1980s ′s had more than 2,000 homicides a year -- today has around 500. I think we can see that level of decrease and that’s why we’ll continue to search for every grant and every engagement available to address the issues.”\n\nALSO READ: Alabama man sentenced in sextortion scheme against KU student\n\nTo get the latest news sent to your phone, download the KCTV5 News app here."
