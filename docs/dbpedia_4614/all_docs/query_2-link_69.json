        "text": "Alert Type info\n\nALERT: The filing location for U nonimmigrant-based Form I-485 is now only at the Nebraska Service Center. We will continue to accept applications for U nonimmigrant-based Form I-485 filed at the Vermont Service Center until April 12, 2023. After that date, we will reject any U nonimmigrant-based Form I-485 filed at the Vermont Service Center.\n\nThe U nonimmigrant status (U visa) is set aside for victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Congress created the U nonimmigrant visa with the passage of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (including the Battered Immigrant Women’s Protection Act) in October 2000. The legislation was intended to strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of noncitizens and other crimes, while also protecting victims of crimes who have suffered substantial mental or physical abuse due to the crime and are willing to help law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of the criminal activity. The legislation also helps law enforcement agencies to better serve victims of crimes.\n\nTo learn about updates to the program, visit our U Nonimmigrant Status Program Updates page.\n\nU Nonimmigrant Eligibility\n\nYou may be eligible for a U nonimmigrant visa if:\n\nYou are the victim of qualifying criminal activity.\n\nYou have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been a victim of criminal activity.\n\nYou have information about the criminal activity.

If you are under the age of 16 or unable to provide information due to a disability, a parent, guardian, or next friend may assist law enforcement on your behalf.\n\nThe crime occurred in the United States or violated U.S. laws.\n\nYou are admissible to the United States. If you are not admissible, you may apply for a waiver on a Form I-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant.\n\nQualifying Criminal Activities\n\nAbduction\n\nAbusive Sexual Contact\n\nBlackmail\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nExtortion\n\nFalse Imprisonment\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation\n\nFelonious Assault\n\nFraud in Foreign Labor Contracting\n\nHostage\n\nIncest\n\nInvoluntary Servitude\n\nKidnapping\n\nManslaughter\n\nMurder\n\nObstruction of Justice\n\nPeonage\n\nPerjury\n\nProstitution\n\nRape\n\nSexual Assault\n\nSexual Exploitation\n\nSlave Trade\n\nStalking\n\nTorture\n\nTrafficking\n\nWitness Tampering\n\nUnlawful Criminal Restraint\n\nOther Related Crimes*†\n\n*Includes any similar activity where the elements of the crime are substantially similar.\n\n†Also includes attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit any of the above and other related crimes.\n\nApplying for U Nonimmigrant Status (U Visa)\n\nTo apply (petition) for a U nonimmigrant status, submit:\n\nForm I-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status\n\nForm I-918, Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification.

To do this, you must:\n\nFile all the necessary forms for U nonimmigrant status with the Vermont Service Center.\n\nFollow all instructions that are sent from the Vermont Service Center, which will include having your fingerprints taken at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\n\nIf your petition is approved, you must consular process to enter the United States, which will include an interview with a consular officer at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.\n\nInformation about your nearest United States Embassy or Consulate can be found at www.usembassy.gov.\n\nSafe Address and Confidentiality Protections\n\nIf you do not feel safe receiving mail from USCIS at your home address, you may include a safe address on your application in the mailing address field. You do not have to be living at the safe address for USCIS to send mail to it. If you need to let USCIS know that you have changed your mailing address after you have filed a petition for U nonimmigrant status, see our Change of Address Procedures for VAWA/T/U Cases and Form I-751 Abuse Waivers webpage.\n\nIf you apply for U nonimmigrant status with USCIS, any information about you or your petition for U nonimmigrant status is strictly confidential and is protected by law. DHS can only share this information in very limited circumstances and may not deny your petition based on evidence provided solely by your abuser or other prohibited sources.\n\nFiling for Qualifying Family Members\n\nCertain qualifying family members are eligible for a derivative U visa based on their relationship to you, the principal, filing for the U visa. The principal petitioner must have their petition for a U visa approved before their family members can be eligible for their own derivative U visa.\n\nIf you, the principal, are...Then...Under 21 years of ageYou may petition on behalf of your spouse, children, parents, and unmarried siblings under age 1821 years of age or olderYou may petition on behalf of your spouse and children.\n\nTo petition for a qualified family member, you must file a Form I-918, Supplement A, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Recipient, at the same time as your application or at a later time.\n\nFees to File U Nonimmigrant Status Applications\n\nAll U nonimmigrant status applications (petitions) and other forms related to the U petition are filed with the USCIS Vermont Service Center.\n\nAll U nonimmigrant status applications (petitions) are fee exempt U nonimmigrant status petitioners and U nonimmigrants are fee exempt for all forms through adjustment of status. You can find additional information on filing fees for our forms on our Fee Schedule page.\n\nU Visa Extensions\n\nWhen U nonimmigrant status is granted, it is valid for four years. However, extensions are available in certain, limited circumstances if the extension is (PDF, 96.74 KB):\n\nNeeded based on a request from law enforcement,\n\nNeeded based on exceptional circumstances,\n\nNeeded due to delays in consular processing, or\n\nAutomatically extended upon the filing and pendency of an application for adjustment (application for a Green Card).\n\nU Visa Cap\n\nThe limit on the number of U visas that may be granted to principal petitioners each year is 10,000. However, there is no cap for family members deriving status from the principal applicant, such as spouses, children, or other eligible family members.\n\nIf the cap is reached before all U nonimmigrant petitions have been adjudicated, USCIS will create a waiting list for any eligible principal or derivative petitioners that are awaiting a final decision and a U visa. Petitioners placed on the waiting list will be granted deferred action or parole and are eligible to apply for work authorization while waiting for additional U visas to become available.\n\nOnce additional visas become available, petitioners on the waiting list and those who have received a bona fide determination will receive their visa in the order in which their petition was received. Petitioners do not have to take any additional steps to request the U visa. USCIS will notify the petitioner of the approval and the accompanying U visa.\n\nNote to Petitioners: Principal U nonimmigrant petitioners are employment authorized incident to status, after the underlying petition for U nonimmigrant status is approved and an employment authorization document is automatically issued without filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.\n\nDerivative family members residing inside the United States are also employment authorized incident to status, however an employment authorization document is not automatically issued. Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, may be filed for a derivative to obtain an employment authorization document.\n\nEmployment authorization for principals and derivatives can only be issued after the underlying U nonimmigrant status petition is approved, regardless of when the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, is filed.\n\nPrincipal petitioners and derivative family members living in the United States may receive employment authorization and deferred action if the underlying pending petition is bona fide, and they meet certain discretionary standards. USCIS will issue a notice if the principal petitioner or derivative family member needs to file a Form I-765 for employment authorization associated with a bona fide determination.\n\nIf the statutory cap is reached in a fiscal year and USCIS uses the waiting list process described at 8 CFR 214.14(d)(2), petitioners for U nonimmigrant status and derivatives in the United States can apply for employment authorization using Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, based on deferred action. An application for employment authorization based on deferred action can only be approved after DHS has deferred action in your case, regardless of when the Form I-765 is filed\n\nApplying for a Green Card\n\nYou may be eligible to apply for a Green Card (adjustment of status/permanent residence) if you meet certain requirements, including:\n\nYou have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least three years while in U nonimmigrant status, and\n\nYou have not unreasonably refused to provide assistance to law enforcement since you received your U visa.\n\nTo apply for permanent residence (a Green Card) for yourself or a qualifying family member, visit our Green Card for a Victim of a Crime (U Nonimmigrant) page.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Any qualifying family member who does not have a derivative U visa when the principal U nonimmigrant receives a Green Card is no longer eligible for a derivative U visa, but may still be eligible to apply for lawful permanent residence.\n\nFor information on extending your principal U visa to ensure your family member remains eligible for a U visa, please visit the T and U visa extension memorandum (PDF, 96.74 KB).\n\nFamily Members Deriving Status\n\nIf the family member deriving status based on your status has met the eligibility requirements for a Green Card, they may apply for lawful permanent residence by filing their own Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.\n\nEven if your family members never had U nonimmigrant status or a U visa, they may still be eligible for a Green Card.\n\nFirst, you must file a Form I-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of U-1 Nonimmigrant, for each eligible family member.\n\nYou may file the Form I-929 at the same time or after you file your Form I-485.\n\nIf the Form I-929 for your family member(s) is approved:\n\nFamily members in the United States may file the Form I-485 to apply for a Green Card.\n\nFamily members outside the United States must first visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to obtain their immigrant visa. Information for the local U.S. embassy or consulate and the procedures for obtaining a visa to enter the United States may be found at www.usembassy.gov.\n\nNOTE: The Form I-929 is the form that is used to establish whether your family member is eligible to apply for a Green Card based on your U visa based lawful permanent resident status. This does not mean that your family member will receive a Green Card. Even if the Form I-929 is approved, your family member is not automatically eligible for work authorization. They are eligible to work once they have received their Green Card.\n\nFiling Form I-929\n\nAll Form I-929 applications are sent to the USCIS Vermont Service Center.\n\nPlease visit our Green Card for a Victim of a Crime (U Nonimmigrant) web page for more information.\n\nResources for Victims of Human Trafficking & Other Crimes\n\nUSCIS offers resources for victims of human trafficking and other crimes and the organizations that serve them. This information is designed to help answer any questions you or your family might have about obtaining T or U Nonimmigrant status. Please see Resources for Victims of Human Trafficking and Other Crimes for more information."
