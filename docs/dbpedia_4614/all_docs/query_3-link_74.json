        "text": "A march was held Friday, a day after a\n\nThe near 23rd Avenue and Jefferson Street at 12:30 p.m., during the school’s lunch hour, when he was shot by a high school-age male, according to police. Police said they are still searching for the suspect, who was wearing a red hoodie, light-colored pants and light shoes.\n\nThe .Students were held inside the school on lockdown for about three hours while police secured the campus and looked for the suspect.\n\nClasses at Garfield were canceled Friday and Monday.\n\nA began Friday morning, shortly before 10 a.m. Parents said they planned to march from the Central District high school, demanding more police officers near the school.\n\n\"This is completely out of hand,” said parent Nadeem Uddin, who told KOMO News Thursday it was the third time in the last year he had to pick up his daughter because of a shooting. “Perhaps this is the last year for my daughter to go to school here. I've got to take her out or raise her somewhere outside the city because it is not safe for our kids anymore.\"\n\nFROM THURSDAY |\n\nThere have been multiple shootings in the same area of campus in the last year, including\n\nIn October, police responded to a shooting that damaged the school property. In May 2023,\n\n\"This happens so many times, and we’re just all so used to it. You don’t have any emotions towards it anymore,” Garfield senior Lezlye Lopez said Thursday. “I would hope to see more cops here before school, during school and after school.\"\n\nIn a , Washington State Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal called Thursday's shooting a \"senseless death.\"\n\n\"Every Washington student has the right to feel safe and supported in their place of learning,\"Reykdal said. \"In the face of a tragedy like this one, we absolutely must look ourselves in the mirror as a society. Easy access to guns is a public health crisis! Our young people should not have this kind of access to firearms. As parents, as educators, and as engaged community members, it will take work from every single one of us to ensure that young people do not have access to deadly firearms.\n\n\"While every single school in Washington state is required to have a comprehensive school safety plan and a threat assessment protocol, schools alone cannot stop gun violence.\""
