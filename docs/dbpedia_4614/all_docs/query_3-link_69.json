        "text": "PITTSFIELD, Wis. (WBAY) - Prosecutors allege a young Brown County man threatened victims over Snapchat before a 16-year-old was shot in Pittsfield Wednesday night.\n\nJackson Rego, 18, is due in court Friday afternoon for his initial appearance on charges including First Degree Reckless Injury by Use of a Dangerous Weapon, First Degree Recklessly Endangering Safety by Use of a Dangerous Weapon, and Endangering Safety by Reckless Use of a Firearm.\n\nSheriff’s deputies responded with armored vehicles Wednesday night for a report of a person shot and wounded.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, one of the first deputies on the scene found an Audi with its front passenger side window shattered. The victim was in the passenger seat, covering the gunshot wound with a blanket. The victim said he was standing up through the car’s sunroof when he was shot.\n\nThe victim unlocked his phone for the deputy, who reported it opened to Snapchat and a conversation between the victim and “John Rogo,” who was threatening the victim with messages like “You and [redacted] gonna be pouring blood my guy” and “Pull up and f----ing get slaughted (sic).” The deputy didn’t see any replies to John Rogo from the victim.\n\nThe victim said he was shot by Jack Rego.\n\nRego came out of his home without incident. Deputies asked where the firearm was, and Rego said they’d find an AR-15 in the closet in his bedroom. He said he didn’t know anyone was hurt because he’d fired at the ground.\n\nRego said he was sitting in his vehicle when his driveway was egged. He saw a car leave but it came back, so Rego went in his house and got his gun. He said he fired a “warning shot,” and when the car didn’t leave right away, “so he fired another warning shot in the direction of the vehicle but he stated his firearm was aimed toward the ground.”\n\nRego admitted he had a “beef” with a person. The victim at the hospital admitted he and a friend bought two cartons of eggs and drove past Rego’s house to “case it out,” and once it was dark drove past his house several times, throwing eggs at it each time.\n\nThe most serious charge against Rego carries up to 30 years in prison because of the dangerous weapon enhancer.\n\nHis initial appearance is at 2 p.m.\n\nBrown County Sheriff’s deputies responded to a shooting in the town of Pittsfield on Wednesday night, before 10 p.m. Deputies were initially told a person had been hurt by a gunshot.\n\nDeputies say they used armored vehicles to approach and contact people inside the home. A 16-year-old victim was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries while an 18-year-old person of interest was arrested without incident.\n\nThe situation was determined to be an isolated incident with no threat to the public.\n\nThe Brown County Sheriff’s Office says this is an active investigation and no further details are being released at this time."
