There are forces of evil, but the forces that are for us, the forces of God, are stronger than that,\" he continued. \"So we're going to keep going strong and just, you know, doing what God's called us to do, lift people up and give hope to the world again.\"\n\nSUSPECT ACCUSED OF KILLING 7 IN ILLINOIS KILLED HIMSELF WHEN FOUND BY US MARSHALS IN TEXAS: POLICE\n\nThe death of the shooter was first announced by Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez earlier that afternoon.\n\n\"Correction: shooter is down,\" Gonzalez wrote on social media. \"But it does not appear that@HCSOTexas deputies fired shots; other agencies fired.\"\n\n\"We continue to assist in a methodical/thorough search of the complex.\"\n\nAt around 2:10 p.m. CT, Gonzalez announced that there were \"possible shots fired at/or around Lakewood Church.\" Less than an hour later, Texas police confirmed that the scene was Lakewood Church.\n\nPolice later advised that anyone with missing family members should head to the \"family reunification location\" at Greenway Plaza's Life Time Fitness gym.\n\nLakewood Church confirmed on X that there was a shooting and asked that users \"please pray for Lakewood and our community.\"\n\nIn a press release sent to local outlets, Governor Greg Abbott called the shooting \"tragic.\"\n\n\"Our hearts are with those impacted by todayâ€™s tragic shooting and the entire Lakewood Church community in Houston,\" Abbott said. \"Places of worship are sacred.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News Digital reached out to the Harris County Sheriff's Office and the Houston Police Department for comment."
