        "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KKTV) - On Thursday night, two people were killed and another was injured after a shooting.\n\nIt happened right outside an apartment complex near the intersection of Platte and Murray, in the southeast part of Colorado Springs. Police said they arrived to find three people who had been shot. One was pronounced dead on scene as two were taken to the hospital. Of those two, only one survived.\n\nThe case is under investigation, as of this article’s publication, and so far, police have not released suspect information. They said they are still searching.\n\nIn the meantime, people who live nearby are sharing their stories with 11 News as they work to move forward.\n\nKendra Teasley lives in an apartment next door. Her windows look out to the parking lot where blood stains remained after the shooting. She said she had just put her 10-year-old and 12-year-old children to bed. Their bedtime is 10 p.m. for school nights.\n\n“And around 10:42, I was just hearing a lot of shots, screaming and crying and my kids ran into the room and they were asking me, like, what was going on,” Teasley said.\n\nHer kids sleep in a bunk bed, with one of them able to see over the fence separating their apartment complexes.\n\n“It was a lot of screaming, crying, of course, they stated the victim’s name as well as trying to get help, begging for help, pleading for help,” she said.\n\nIn the parking lot, some neighbors told 11 News the three victims were lying on the ground as some suspects ran away. So far, police have not been able to confirm whether they are searching for one suspect or multiple. But, Teasley said she heard there was arguing before the shots were fired; however, what mattered at the time was comforting her children.\n\n“They were kind of asking, because of all the chaos and the loud screaming, they were just concerned about everyone, they were like, ‘are they okay? Are they still alive?’” she said. “I could see it was people laying on the ground, but, as them being kids, I was like, ‘no, they’re fine, it’s okay,’ just to kind of give them peace of mind.”\n\nShe said the whole experience will likely have long-lasting impact on her family.\n\n“Seeing it in general... it was kind of traumatizing,” she said, “because my kids were the first ones to see it because they have bunk beds.”\n\nTeasley said she is disheartened by gun violence. But she said there was something that helped restore her faith in others.\n\nAfter the three victims were shot, a man ran to the scene and jumped into action. He spoke with 11 News, but given his status in the military, chose to remain anonymous.\n\nHe said he was told there had been a shooting and ran to the area, immediately finding the victims and trying to help. He told 11 News he was joined by two more people, both of which also had military experience.\n\n“He was too far gone,” he said, remembering the victim who died on the scene. He recounted the gruesome details.\n\nHe said he put a makeshift tourniquet on one victim.\n\nTeasley said she watched it happen and believes that action likely saved the life of the one person who survived.\n\n“I’m extremely grateful to our neighbor who was able to help,” she said. “He was able to get there and quickly think, like, ‘okay, we need to cut the blood circulation and we’re able to save a life.’ Unfortunately, the other two, he wasn’t able to get to, but because we were able to get just one, that was a blessing in disguise at that point.”\n\nTeasley was able to meet that man the next morning, identifying him as the one who helped just before speaking with 11 News. They both had stepped outside, hoping to learn more about what happened. Teasley said she still had a lot of questions.\n\n“Was it worth it to take someone else’s father or mother away from them at that point?” she said.\n\nAs police investigate, they are asking the community to call them if anyone knows anything. You can call police at (719) 444-4000 or remain anonymous at the Crime Stoppers number (719) 634-STOP."
