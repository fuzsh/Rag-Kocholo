        "text": "The community of Uvalde is left reeling more than a month after a lone gunman at Robb Elementary Scool.\n\nOne mother took matters into her own hands that afternoon when she heard gunshots while outside the Texas school. she heard there was an active shooter and quickly rushed to the school where her two young boys were.\n\nIt was just moments after she was face-to-face with law enforcement when she heard gunshots and then children screaming inside. Gomez said law enforcement was not doing what she hoped, so she tried to get some parents to force some action to get first responders into the school.\n\nGomez said authorities were telling her if she did not cooperate then she would be handcuffed, and she eventually was. She then told them she would cooperate and calm down just so she could be released.\n\n\"As soon as they [police] take me off the cuff, I see his arm, like, give me a little gateway, because I'm real little. So, a little gateway where I can just run.\"\n\nGomez said there was no doubt in her mind she would run into the school and save her children herself, which is what she planned to do.\n\nImmediately, and began banging on a door window where she saw her oldest son's teacher. Gomez told her, \"Like, you already have a gateway out, so might as well just come out, like, if I'm going to run out with him, y'all just come on, too.\"\n\nWithin minutes, Gomez said she was able to get her oldest son and some of his classmates out â€” but her youngest was still inside. She ran around the school desperately searching for his classroom.\n\n\"At this moment, I'm jiggling the handle and I'm going pretty nuts like trying to get the door open and it's not gonna open, so I stand back and the cops are already on me and they're like, 'Ma'am, calm down!'\"\n\nShe told them to evacuate the school or she wouldn't leave her spot, \"Immediately, they start evacuating that classroom and my son runs out to me and he's like, 'Mom, mom!'\"\n\n\"I just remember when my son saw my other son, one hugged the other one and said, 'I'm so glad you're OK,' and the other one said, 'I was so worried you weren't.'\"\n\nGomez wiped tears from her eyes as she recalled the moment. \"It was a big thing, because in that moment I was like, they're really happy to see each other, thank God to each other that they're alive.\"\n\nEver since that harrowing day, Gomez said she has faced scrutiny from law enforcement, even at her own home.\n\n\"The other night, we were exercising and we had a cop parked at the corner, like flickering us with his headlights,\" Gomez explained.\n\nBecause of these incidents, Gomez said she has had to separate from her boys so they \"don't feel like they have to watch cops passing by, stopping, parking.\"\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Gomez went to Uvalde's Town Square to continue protesting with other members of the community. With signs in their hands that read, \"Fire Pete Arredondo,\" Gomez said she wants to see Arredondo gone without pay.\n\nHer goal moving forward is to file a lawsuit. Her lawyer was sitting next to her during the interview. \"The fact that he wasn't fired immediately based upon whatever it is, hours of video, from testimonies such as Angeli's; is an indication that there is some sort of what, corruption or wrong-doing,\"Mark Di Carlo, a criminal defense lawyer from Corpus Christi, said.\n\nDi Carlo told the media he is currently representing about 15 parents in the Uvalde community. When asked when lawsuits will be filed, he said he wants to focus on gathering evidence and information before rushing to file lawsuits."
