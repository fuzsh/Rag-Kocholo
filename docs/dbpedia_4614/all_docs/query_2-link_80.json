        "text": "COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Local community members and law enforcement officers came together in a show of solidarity and community spirit to participate in the annual National Night Out event.\n\nThe event that fosters community-building by promoting police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie. It’s celebrated on the first Tuesday in August across the United States.\n\nIn the Chattahoochee Valley, local law enforcement officers were engaging with community members at multiple locations throughout Columbus. This outreach follows a report by Columbus Police Chief Stoney Mathis, who noted a decline in crime rates attributed to the strengthening of community ties.\n\nTuesday evening’s events showcased the friendships within the community.\n\n“I sprayed the huge hose and got in the fire truck and looked around,” said 9-year-old Titus Westbrook.\n\nIt was a great night for Westbrook. He got to meet Columbus firefighters in Oakland Park as part of National Night Out.\n\nThe sound of police sirens you may have heard in Columbus on Tuesday evening wasn’t signaling an emergency, but rather it was an opportunity for Columbus law enforcement, first responders, city council members, and others to engage with the community face-to-face.\n\n“It’s an opportunity for law enforcement and other public safety to bridge that gap between citizens and law enforcement,” said Donald Bush, retired Columbus police officer. “And we get a chance to have a good time because Columbus is a great place.”\n\nDozens of patrol cars went all around the city, including Frank D. Chester Rec. Center, the Food Mill and Old Town in north Columbus, just to name a few.\n\n“If they don’t trust us, they’re not going to call 911 when they see something or something suspicious,” Columbus police Sgt. Angela Florence.\n\nNational Night Out is a time to build trust, according to Sgt. Florence.\n\n“It’s always important to build those relationships and trust, so they’ll see us on the good times and not just the bad times because, sometimes, people call 911 and that could be the worst day for them. So, we want to make sure that we’re used to each other. We’re comfortable and building those positive relationships.”\n\nDistrict attorney Don Kelley had his share of fun Tuesday night, an opportunity for prosecutors to show another side.\n\n“A lot of times, unless people have a criminal case, they don’t come into contact with our office,” said Chattahoochee Valley Circuit Court District Attorney Don Kelly. “And that’s one main reason why we’re out here now...to let people know we’re people just like everybody else working a job, trying to make the city safer.”\n\nOfficials say this was one of the biggest national nights out and Columbus Mayor Skip Henderson says it’s not just law enforcement’s job to keep the community safe.\n\n“Police, sheriff, fire...they cannot do it alone,” the mayor said. “It’s not a one-man job. You absolutely have to get involved. This is our community. We all need to work at making sure it’s a safe one.”\n\nIn East Alabama, the City of Auburn also hosted its National Night Out with fun on the field behind Duck Sanford Stadium.\n\nThere were petting zoo animals, inflatables, rock climbing, face painting, and a touch-a-truck event.\n\nAuburn firefighters were also there giving out free hamburgers and hotdogs.\n\nPolice tell us National Night Out is important for building relationships.\n\n“Have some fun, spend some time...see these uniforms and go up and talk to us,” said Auburn Assistant Police Chief Michael Harris. “We live here, that’s one of the things with law enforcement is we’re part of the community, too. We live here, we raise our families here. Come sit down and talk with us. That’s what it’s all about.”\n\nThey also conducted a K-9 unit demonstration and showcased police vehicles and fire trucks for the public to view."
