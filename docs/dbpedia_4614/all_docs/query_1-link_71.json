        "text": "As I write this, it is six hours before I need to awaken my 8-year-old, a second grader, and get him ready for school. Except that, I don’t know if I have the heart to do it.\n\nHe has done his part: He completes his work on time, is a leader among his peers, follows classroom rules, wears his mask all day, every day. But his parents and the politicians that we elect are not doing our part to prevent his school from becoming the next Sandy Hook, Parkland or Robb Elementary. Our refusal today and every day to enact gun-control measures of any kind is killing our children.\n\nWhen I think about not sending my child to school, I fear what every American parent does: that I could at any moment be the next mom waiting outside a community center or in a police station to learn how many bullets my child took while I was working, because even well-trained and well-armed police officers cannot stop a teenage shooter with multiple rifles and body armor.\n\nI don’t know if I will send my son to school tomorrow. I also fear that the psychological stress of being an innocent child in a gun-sick country has done irreparable damage already. Will my son learn that second graders just like him were targeted Tuesday in Uvalde, Texas, from a friend, because I was too scared to tell him myself? Will a classmate whisper it on the playground? Will my son’s teacher cry, watching our children file into the classroom, feeling the enormous weight of their growing minds and bodies in their care? Teachers must protect our children from assault rifles and pandemics and summer brain drain. This is a responsibility we can neither accurately quantify nor adequately compensate.\n\n'Get back! There's a shooting!'\n\nAnother reason I don’t know if I will send my son to school tomorrow is earlier this spring, he experienced his first active shooter event. On Friday the 13th, he went to the Fiserv Forum with his 20-year-old brother to see their beloved Milwaukee Bucks play in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nMaybe this wasn’t a conventional Brothers Night Out for an 8-year-old, but my sons have grown up in Giannis Antetokounmpo jerseys and on Milwaukee Public Schools and county park basketball courts, even the ones without nets. Milwaukee is a basketball city first and foremost.\n\nOr maybe it’s a gun city first and a basketball city second.\n\nAfter the game that night, my sons were just a few steps from the ground floor of the arena when the fan exodus abruptly changed course. Patrons leaving early to shake off the Bucks loss streamed back inside, charging up the stairs.\n\n“Get back! There’s a shooting!” someone, or several people, yelled. My younger son tells me that his brother scooped him up and sprinted to The Jockey Club, a VIP chandelier-and-big-screens lounge. My sons say they heard shots outside as they raced up the interior staircase.\n\nMore: 21 people were injured in shootings in downtown Milwaukee; Mayor Johnson imposes curfew Saturday night\n\nAt first, my 8-year-old explained, spectators in the room asked the new arrivals “Why are you coming back?” Or, “What are you doing here?” But news and kindness travel fast. Bystanders became bouncers as folks streamed in. Or as my young son explained it: “People who were not working there but just trying to, you know, be nice, were standing by the doors and guarding them because we thought maybe the shooters would try to come inside.”\n\nThe shooters did not make it inside. At last count, three separate shootings occurred in Milwaukee’s downtown entertainment district on Friday the 13th: 21 injured, no fatalities, 11 arrests and 11 guns seized, according to the Journal Sentinel. I wasn’t there, and I’m not following news accounts closely. Instead, I’m following my son’s lead. The shooting was the last thing he talked about at bedtime that Friday and the first thing he mentioned upon waking Saturday.\n\nMy 20-year-old says that his little brother was brave, stoic even. When his friends’ parents asked my second grader if he was near the city’s “Deer District” during the shooting, he agreed to talk about it only if they promised to keep the details from their own sons.\n\n“I thought they should cover their ears,” my youngest told me. “I didn’t want them to be scared.”\n\nMy three older sons have tried to reassure my youngest, telling him that they were really scared the first time they heard gunshots, too, that active shooter drills are scary, but you get through them, that listening to responsible adults is a wise move when there are shots fired and people down.\n\nMy 16-year-old did not mention the tennis practice four weeks ago when he and his teammates heard two separate rounds of gunshots around 4 p.m. near school. Last fall, he and fellow JV soccer players were robbed at gunpoint, outside the same school, while they waited for a bus to transport them to a game. Our 8-year-old heard that story, but not the one about the drive-through customer who had an assault rifle resting between his legs. My 16-year-old saw it when he walked up to deliver the man's hamburger, cheese curds and Mountain Dew. Is there anything more America’s Dairyland than that?\n\nMore guns in the U.S. than people\n\nSo, Tuesday night, when my 20-year-old asked my 16-year-old if he heard about Uvalde, I snapped: “LATER,” hoping to get my youngest into bed for an untroubled night’s sleep.\n\nAnd that’s the most honest, most accurate thing I can say. When it comes to gun violence in America there will always be a “now,” and we are guaranteed a “later.\" Three hundred twenty-one Americans are shot every day in the U.S., according to Brady United.\n\nAt least we can put Friday the 13th in the rear-view mirror. It’s eight months until the next one: Friday, Jan. 13, 2023. That’s about 27,000 gun deaths from now. I don’t believe in superstition, but I do believe in data. With America’s 120.5 to 100 gun-to-resident ratio, with guns now the leading killer of our children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with state legislators more focused on bathroom bills, abortion and (nonexistent) voter fraud than on gun safety, maybe sheer dumb luck is the only thing standing between any one of us and gun violence.\n\nIs there anything more American than that?\n\nAngela McManaman attended Cudahy High School and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. She lives in Milwaukee."
