        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (WMC) - The Orange Mound community is still wrapping its thoughts around the deadly mass shooting Saturday.\n\nIn videos on social media, you can see people who look like teenagers and young adults gathered around the basketball court at Orange Mound Park on Saturday.\n\nBut what you do not see are the pre-teens and kids playing on the nearby playground at the park.\n\n“Memphis would be a better place if they would stop the killing,” said Michelle Wooten, an 11-year-old who lives in Orange Mound.\n\nJust days ago, she experienced the mass shooting at Orange Mound Park. She said she visits the park almost every day.\n\nThe Saturday night shooting at Orange Mound Park injured nine people and two of those people died, according to the Memphis Police Department.\n\nNow some kids who frequent the park say they feel hesitant about a space they once felt safe in.\n\n“Horrible, like if I wanted to go to the park, I should be able to go to the park without being scared. Without thinking something is going to happen,” said Tamiyah Wooten, a 13-year-old who lives in Orange Mound.\n\nShelby County Commissioner Britney Thornton represents District 10, which includes Orange Mound. She said knowing that kids are hesitant about going to the park is not a move in the right direction.\n\n“It’s not cool and it’s a major setback because I know the organizers who fought so hard to get the park where it is now, they did that because they wanted people to enjoy it,” she said. “So, to see young people perceive it as a place that is not safe for them, that is going to take a lot of work.”\n\nShe added that spaces like the park in Orange Mound are vital to the community.\n\n“They should also believe that some kids are actually scared to see someone walking around with a gun,” she said. “Tom Lee Park and Shelby Farms, well a community like Orange Mound is not connected to those great gems in Shelby County. Our transit system won’t get us there, our connectivity to the Greenline doesn’t exist. So, when you have something like this park, it is a major asset to the health and wellness of the community.”\n\nThornton still has a lot of questions about the party, the shooting, and gun laws in the state.\n\n“Why should a developing human have access to military-grade machinery and walk down the street, run down the street? Just so many questions with me about the state laws,” said Commissioner Thornton.\n\nThirteen-year-old Tamiyah said it feels like the kids at the park were not thought about on Saturday.\n\n“They should also believe that some kids are actually scared to see someone walking around with a gun,” she said.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department says the ages of the people injured during the shooting range from 16 to 29.\n\nThornton said the age group of 18 to 24-year-olds is a group that is hard for city and county leaders to reach. She added that resources for that age group are scarce across the county.\n\n“If we wanted to get that same 300-plus group of young people together, could we? I couldn’t. A lot of churches couldn’t. Our schools couldn’t. We have to literally try to reach them to be able to teach them,” she said.\n\nShelby County District Attorney Steve Mulroy said people between 16 and 24 are the most dangerous and likely to commit crimes.\n\nThornton said more investments in people in that age group are needed.\n\nAction News 5 also contacted Memphis City Councilwoman Jana Swearengen-Washington for a comment. We were told she is declining all interviews until MPD finishes its investigation.\n\nClick here to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nClick here to report a spelling or grammar error.
