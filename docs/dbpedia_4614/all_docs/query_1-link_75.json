        "text": "It was 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 24 in Uvalde, Texas, when a teenager opened fire on the students and staff of an elementary school in the city. At least 19 children and two teachers were killed by the young man, identified as Salvador Ramos, just 18 years old. The gunman was killed by law enforcement.\n\nIt was the deadliest shooting at a US elementary school since the shocking attack in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed, in December 2012. The teenager had announced via Facebook that he was going to attack an elementary school, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said at a press conference on Wednesday. His speaking engagement was disrupted by Democrat Beto O'Rourke. “You said this is not predictable. This is totally predictable... The time to stop the next shooting is right now and you are doing nothing,\" lambasted the Democrat gubernatorial candidate, accusing Mr. Abbott of being responsible.\n\nUS President Joe Biden has announced that he will be visiting Texas in a few days. The powerful pro-gun lobby, the NRA, cleared itself of all responsibility on Wednesday, denouncing “the act of an isolated and disturbed criminal.”\n\n\"My heart is broken today,\" said Hal Harrell, the school district superintendent, announcing that all school activities were canceled until further notice. The attack also came just 10 days after a deadly, racist rampage at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that added to a yearslong series of mass killings at churches, schools and stores. And the prospects for any reform of the nation’s gun regulations seemed as dim as in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook deaths.\n\n'Why are we willing to live with this carnage?'\n\nPresident Joe Biden appeared ready for a fight, calling for new gun restrictions in an address to the nation hours after the attack. \"As a nation, we have to ask, when in God’s name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby? When in God’s name are we going to do what has to be done?\" Mr. Biden asked. \"Why are we willing to live with this carnage?\"\n\nAfter shooting his grandmother, the gunman fled with his pick-up. After 3.5 kilometers on the road, he was the victim of an accident for an undetermined reason near the Robb primary school, where more than 500 children aged between 7 and 11 are educated. They only had a few more school days before the end of the school year.\n\nHe exited the vehicle with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and a backpack. He was quickly confronted by a police officer assigned to the security of the primary school who failed to prevent him from entering the establishment through an access door, said Steven McCraw, the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety.\n\nHe has no criminal history as a minor or any psychological problems known to local health departments. A cousin, Mia, told the Washington Post that he no longer wanted to go to school where he was bullied because of his stutter.\n\nOn May 17, the day after his 18th birthday, he had purchased a semi-automatic rifle, then ammunition, then another automatic rifle on May 20 at the same Uvalde armory, Mr. McCraw said. Investigators have so far found no evidence to explain his actions.\n\nThe attacker acted alone\n\nGovernor Abbott claimed the teenager announced the school attack via Facebook. A spokesperson for Meta, the company that owns Facebook, quickly clarified that these messages had been sent privately to another user: “We are closely cooperating with law enforcement in their ongoing investigation.\"\n\nAccording to statements by Mr. Abbott, the young man wrote three messages on the social media platform to announce that he intended to carry out a shooting against an elementary school. He then wrote that he was going to shoot his grandmother, then confirmed that he had indeed fired at the latter, added Mr. Abbott. Hit in the face, the 66-year-old woman survived and called the police. She was transported in critical condition to University Health Hospital in San Antonio. According to the governor, the third message, probably less than 15 minutes before arriving at the school, said: 'I'm going to shoot an elementary school.' These messages are the only warnings issued before the shooting, the governor continued.\n\nAccording to CNN, these last messages were not intended for a public audience, but rather for a German woman he met online earlier this month. He announced just before his act that he had shot his grandmother in the head and was going to shoot an elementary school now. The 15-year-old, who lives in Frankfurt, said he was angry with his grandmother that morning because she was on the phone with [telephone company] AT&T about his phone. According to her, the young man spent a lot of time alone at home and never had plans to go out with his friends.\n\nDeadliest school shooting in Texas history\n\nHeavily armed law enforcement officers swarmed to the school, with officers in tactical vests diverting traffic and FBI agents coming and going from the building. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden was briefed on the shooting on Air Force One as he returned from a five-day trip to Asia.\n\nPartner service\n\nLearn French with Gymglish\n\nThanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day.\n\nTry for free\n\nUvalde, home to about 16,000 people, is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from the border with Mexico. Robb Elementary is in a mostly residential neighborhood of modest homes.\n\nThe tragedy in Uvalde was the deadliest school shooting in Texas history, and it added to a grim tally in the state, which has been the site of some of the deadliest shootings in the US over the past five years.\n\nIn 2018, a gunman fatally shot 10 people at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area. A year before that, a gunman at a Texas church killed more than two dozen people during a Sunday service in the small town of Sutherland Springs. In 2019, another gunman at a Walmart in El Paso killed 23 people in a racist attack.\n\nEfforts for gun control consistently face roadblocks\n\nThe shooting came days before the National Rifle Association annual convention was set to begin in Houston. Governor Abbott and both of Texas' US senators were among elected Republican officials who were the scheduled speakers at a Friday leadership forum sponsored by the NRA's lobbying arm.\n\nIn the years since Sandy Hook, the gun control debate in Congress has waxed and waned. Efforts by lawmakers to change US gun policies in any significant way have consistently faced roadblocks from Republicans and the influence of outside groups such as the NRA.\n\nA year after Sandy Hook, Sens. Joe Manchin a West Virginia Democrat, and Patrick J. Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, negotiated a bipartisan proposal to expand the nation's background check system. But as the measure was close to being brought to the Senate floor for a vote, it became clear it would not get enough votes to clear a 60-vote filibuster hurdle.\n\nOn Tuesday, former President Barack Obama, who has called the day of the Sandy Hook shooting the darkest of his administration, said in a statement: \"Michelle and I grieve with the families in Uvalde, who are experiencing pain no one should have to bear.\" \"We’re also angry for them. Nearly 10 years after Sandy Hook – and 10 days after Buffalo – our country is paralyzed, not by fear, but by a gun lobby and a political party that have shown no willingness to act in any way that might help prevent these tragedies.\"\n\n'I'm here to beg... Pass laws that make this less likely'\n\nConnecticut US Senator Chris Murphy spoke from the Senate floor, on Tuesday, to beg his colleagues to finally pass legislation that addresses the nation's continuing gun violence problem. He demanded that lawmakers do what they failed to do after 26 students and educators were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, the area he represented as a congressman, and urged his colleagues to find a compromise: \"I’m here on this floor to beg, to literally get down on my hands and knees and beg my colleagues. Find a path forward here. Work with us to find a way to pass laws that make this less likely,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don’t understand why people here think we’re powerless,\" Mr. Murphy told reporters. \"We aren't.\"\n\nMr. Murphy said he was planning to reach out to Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn after the two had teamed on an earlier background check bill that never became law. He said he would also reach out to Texas' other Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nSen. Cornyn told reporters he was on his way to Texas and would talk with them later. Sen. Cruz issued a statement calling it \"a dark day. We’re all completely sickened and heartbroken.\" Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who sponsored gun legislation that failed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate after Sandy Hook, said, \"We’re just pushing on people who just won’t budge on anything.\"\n\n\"It makes no sense at all why we can’t do common sense things and try to prevent some of this from happening,\" he said.\n\nMore on this topic US is flooded with guns\n\nLast year, the House passed two bills to expand background checks on firearms purchases. One bill would have closed a loophole for private and online sales. The other would have extended the background check review period. Both languished in the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome objections from a filibuster.\n\nLe Monde with AP and AFP"
