        "text": "Authorities have arrested a man in Guyana who's believed to be responsible for the fatal shooting of a 6-year-old boy at a Fourth of July celebration in Maryland.\n\nInvestigators say the victim, Ahsan Payton, was caught in crossfire during a shootout at a neighborhood celebration in Temple Hills.\n\nPolice say Rakeem Gilgeours, 33, fled the country after the shooting, before he was identified as a suspect. He was arrested in Guyana and was brought back to the United States. He's now in Florida awaiting extradition to Prince George’s County.\n\n\"That’s usually the case when anybody is running. They have friends or family somewhere, and they're seeking cover,\" Prince George's County Police Chief Malik Aziz said. \"And he was seeking cover in Guyana.\"\n\nGilgeours is charged with second-degree murder.\n\n\"Call it tragic; call it a gun atrocity, whatever it is. Ahsan Payton isn't with us, and we believe that this person is the reason why,\" Aziz said.\n\nPrince George's County\n\nPrince George's County, Maryland, news updates, events and information\n\nNew charging documents lay out what happened the night of the shooting on Akron Street. The suspect allegedly pointed a gun at another person, who is still unknown to police. That person then pulled a gun, and both began firing.\n\nWitnesses told detectives that Gilgeours fell down, then raised his gun in the air and fired without regard for others in the area. That's when the little boy was hit.\n\n\"To have the loss of a 6-year-old, Ahsan Payton, to this type of gun violence is totally not acceptable,\" Prince George's County Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Barry Stanton said.\n\nGilgeours was identified as a suspect after police received multiple tips. One gave police the name Rakeem, while another gave them his nickname, ROC. Investigators say they found an Instagram page with that name and eventually identified Rakeem Gilgeours as a suspect. Police also recovered multiple photos and videos from the night of the shooting, allegedly showing Gilgeours at the scene.\n\nThey have not yet identified the second suspect.\n\nAhsan played for the Woodridge Warriors football team in Northeast D.C. The team's new season started a week after his death. His coach said the season was being dedicated to him and that his number was being retired.\n\nOn Thursday, Ahsan's football coach said he was glad a suspect was arrested. He said he hopes police catch everyone involved.\n\nPolice say two other people were hit by gunfire, but they were expected to be OK."
