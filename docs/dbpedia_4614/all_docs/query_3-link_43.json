It’s heartbreaking for my client. It’s heartbreaking for my client's family. It’s heartbreaking for the family of this young child because nobody obviously wants a young child that hasn’t yet enjoyed life to lose their life. Unfortunately, that child was in a situation where individuals around the child were aggressive and the child is the true victim of this episode. It’s really a sad, sad story. Because that’s an innocent child no matter what, it’s an innocent child,\" said Green's attorney Rick Escobar."
