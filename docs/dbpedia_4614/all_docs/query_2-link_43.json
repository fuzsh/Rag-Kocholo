        "text": "NEW CITY ‒ Rockland County has adopted a law mandating businesses selling firearms post warning labels about potential dangers and inform people getting licenses about guns.\n\nCounty Executive Ed Day signed the law on Wednesday after the Legislature adopted it on Tuesday night.\n\nThe labels warn that access to a firearm in the home significantly increases the risk of suicide, homicide and death during domestic disputes, as well as the risk of accidental deaths of children or others, according to the resolution approved Tuesday night. The labels also include contact information for the National Suicide Hotline.\n\nGun violence remains a major concern in the US\n\nThe proposal comes as gun violence remains the number one killer of children in the United States and continues to shatter lives here in Rockland County, sponsors said. Sponsors said the law recognizes gun violence as a public health crisis.\n\nSponsors cited statistics by the Center for Gun Violence at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health that showed 48,117 people died by firearms in 2022, an average of one death every 11 minutes. More than 26,993 people died by firearm suicide, 19,592 died by firearm homicide, and 472 by unintentional gun injury.\n\nRockland Legislator Beth Davidson, D-Nyack/Clarkstown, the chief sponsor, said her constituents tell her \"they are tired of watching children being gunned down and politicians saying ‘there’s nothing we can do.\"\n\n\"Here in Rockland County, we can treat gun violence as the public health crisis we know it to be and warn consumers of the risks of having a firearm in the home,\" said Davidson, a first-year lawmaker. \"If this law makes one person suffering from depression think twice, if it prevents one domestic violence death, saves one child from an accidental shooting, or protects one law enforcement officer answering the call of duty, it will have been worth it. \"\n\nLegislator Dana Stilley, D-Orangetown/Clarkstown, said the \"label law will help people make informed decisions and understand the additional risk of owning a gun. both for the owner and people around them, especially children who may access an improperly stored gun and accidentally discharge it.”\n\nLegislators cited stats from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which show 53% of gun deaths in New York are suicides and more than 27% of the suicides involve firearms. An average of 457 people die by gun-related suicide each year. In addition, from 2016-2020, 156 children under 18 were killed with a gun in New York.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued a landmark Surgeon General’s Advisory on Firearm Violence, declaring firearm violence in America to be a public health crisis, and issuing an advisory outlining the devastating and far-reaching consequences that firearm violence poses to the health and well-being of the country.\n\nLegislature Chair Jay Hood, D-Haverstraw, a cosponsor, said the major issue is making our communities safer and stronger.\n\n\"This law is a basic, commonsense safety measure, and I’m proud that Rockland County is tackling gun violence as a public health issue, becoming just the third county legislature in New York State to pass it,\" Hood said. \"Injuries and deaths caused by firearms are preventable — and yes, if one person struggling with mental illness, one child, one first responder is saved by this law, we have done our jobs as leaders.\"\n\nRockland becomes the third NY county seeking warning labels\n\nRockland is following in the footsteps of Westchester and Albany counties.\n\n“As a gun owner, I fully understand and appreciate the high level of commitment that fellow firearm owners have towards maintaining stringent safety practices,\" Day said. \"This new legislation serves to underscore the critical importance of firearm safety within our communities and I commend Legislator Davidson for her collaborative and thoughtful approach in crafting this legislation.\"\n\nIn June, Westchester County Executive George Latimer signed into law legislation requiring the posting of notices warning of the dangers of weapons or firearms at the point of sale and during licensing.\n\nOf interest: Where does NY rank on this U.S. map of gun shops that sell most guns used for crime?\n\nLegislator Jewel Williams Johnson, a Democrat who chairs the Legislature's Health Committee, and one of the legislation's chief sponsors, said in a news release that society is tragically reminded of the often fatal consequences that occur when guns are at hand. She cited the mass shooting in upstate Buffalo.\n\n\"This is especially true for someone suffering from mental illness or depression,\" Williams Johnson said. \"A warning label won't end criminal gun violence, or end the racism that apparently motivated the Buffalo shooter. But, it will help buyers and serve as an alert to be mindful of the danger of bringing a gun home, and perhaps inspire buyers to think more carefully about where and how they store their guns and who might have access to them.\"\n\nLegislator Colin Smith, a Democrat on the Legislation Committee, said the warning labels represent common sense.\n\n\"Like our county gun storage law, this is a basic, sensible, safety measure,\" Smith said. \"It's a gentle reminder to gun buyers that there are risks in having a weapon in the home, and that those risks can reach beyond just the gun owner, so think about everyone in the household.\"\n\nSteve Lieberman covers government, breaking news, courts, police, and investigations.
