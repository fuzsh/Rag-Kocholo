        "text": "A US mother on trial for failing to stop her son from carrying out a deadly school shooting has sought to put the blame on her husband.\n\nJennifer Crumbley, taking the stand in her own defence, told jurors that the gun she and her husband purchased for their son was not her responsibility.\n\nMrs Crumbley is the first parent to go on trial for a mass shooting carried out by a child.\n\nHer husband, James, is facing a separate trial on the same charges.\n\nIf found guilty, they each face up to 15 years in prison.\n\nTheir son is serving life in prison for killing four classmates at Oxford High School in Michigan in 2021. He was 15 years old at the time of the attack.\n\nMrs Crumbley, 45, took the stand on Thursday, the sixth day of the trial.\n\nShe was the first witness to testify for the defence after the prosecution presented 21 witnesses. Prosecutors will cross-examine her on Friday.\n\nMrs Crumbley said her husband brought their son to a gun store the day after Thanksgiving to buy a handgun for him as a gift.\n\nShe \"didn't feel comfortable\" being responsible for safely storing the gun, which had a cable lock, she said.\n\n\"It was more his thing, so I let him handle that,\" she said. \"I didn't feel comfortable putting the lock thing on it. I'd just rather not, and let him do it.\"\n\nA few days later, her husband removed the lock so she could take her son to a gun range, she said, describing it as a fun day.\n\nThe lock's key was kept in a beer stein displayed in the kitchen, and her husband hid the gun in their bedroom. She said she did not know that her son knew where it was kept.\n\nDuring the attacker's trial last year, his attorneys argued he was neglected by his parents and suffered from mental illness. But he later said his parents did not know about his plans and that he was solely responsible.\n\nHis lawyers have said that he will invoke his right to remain silent if called to testify at his parents' trials.\n\nMrs Crumbley's legal team say she could not have predicted her son's actions and she is being unfairly blamed.\n\nEarlier in the day, prosecutors presented text messages and diary entries from her son that they said showed he was having hallucinations.\n\n\"I have zero help for my mental problems and it's causing me to shoot up the ... school,\" he wrote in one diary entry.\n\n\"I want help, but my parents don't listen to me so I can't get any help,\" he wrote in another entry submitted by prosecutors.\n\nIn court, Mrs Crumbley said that she believed many of his text messages - which included some referencing \"demons\" and clothes \"flying off the shelf\" - were just \"messing around\".\n\n\"He's been convinced our house has been haunted since 2015,\" she added, adding that her son dubbed the ghost \"Boris Johnson\".\n\nOne of prosecutors' key arguments is that the parents did not help their child get the mental health support he needed."
