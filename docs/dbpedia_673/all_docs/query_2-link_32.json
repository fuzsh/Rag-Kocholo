        "text": "From cities, castles and manor houses to music and art, there is something for everyone to experience in this region filled with hidden gems. City tours will provide immediate insight into gorgeous medieval cities such as Schwerin, Wismar and Stralsund, notable pearls of the land in many aspects, rich in history and cultural treasures.\n\nThe castle Schwerin is a perfect example of unique things to discover. The castle itself is situated on a small island in the midst of Schwerin Lake, and is surrounded by impressive parks and gardens. This masterpiece of architecture resembles castles from romantic fairy tales and is a remarkable landmark for the City of Schwerin and the region.\n\nWismar is the prime example of a place where the time seems to stand still. This beautiful hanseatic city, whose historical old town has been declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site, was founded in 1226 and offers an impressive amount of old gabled houses to discover, built in the specific brick gothic architecture style typical of Northern Germany.\n\nThe old town of Stralsund has also been declared as UNESCO World Heritage Site and was one of the most prosperous medieval cities of the Hanseatic League. Rich in historic buildings with their distinctive gabled roofs, the old town reveals the way of life as it was the norm throughout the centuries, particularly in the “Old Market Square” that served as the beating heart of the city. Stralsund is especially well known for the most impressive three medieval Brick Gothic churches, namely the St. Mary's Church, St. Nicholas Church and St. James Church.\n\nFor centuries, the Baltic region has captivated the imagination of countless artists and attracted them to these parts of Germany, including - among many others - the famous painters Caspar David Friedrich and Philipp Otto Runge, who lived and worked in Vorpommern. Currently there are three artist colonies, Ahrenshoop, Schwaan and Hiddensee, that house a number of artists and display their formative works. The solemn and peaceful quality of both the cultural and historical heritage as well as the natural beauties of the region make it a perfect destination for not only cultural tourism, but also those interested in escaping the hustles of daily lives and creating the works of art of any kind in these tranquil sanctuaries.\n\nThere is a large number of exciting events one can attend to throughout the year on the culture trip to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, offering something for every taste.
