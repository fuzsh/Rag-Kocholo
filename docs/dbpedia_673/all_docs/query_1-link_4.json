        "text": "The Duchy of Mecklenburg was divided and partitioned a number of times over the centuries. In 1701, the last division created the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna recognized both Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz as grand duchies. Friedrich Franz I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin became the first Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Today the territory encompassing the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin is in the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n\nIn February 1918, Friedrich Franz IV, the last Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, began to serve as Regent for the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The reigning Grand Duke, Adolf Friedrich VI, had died by suicide, and the heir presumptive was serving with the Russian military and had made it known that he wished to renounce his rights of succession. The regency lasted only nine months, as on November 14, 1918, Friedrich Franz IV was forced to abdicate as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, as well as the Regent in the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nHoly Roman Empire, German Confederation, North German Confederation, and the German Empire Explained\n\nThe Constituent States of the German Empire\n\nGlossary of German Noble and Royal Titles\n\nBelow is an indexed listing with links to biographical articles about the Grand Ducal Family of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
