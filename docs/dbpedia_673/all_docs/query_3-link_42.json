        "text": "FAMOUS MORGANATIC.\n\nMARRIAGES.\n\nCopyright.\n\nDuke of Cambridge and\n\n\"Mrs. Fitzgeorge.\"\n\nVIII - By R L Hadfield\n\nThe morganatic marriage of the Duke of Cam-\n\nbridge, cousin of Queen Victoria, was a real\n\nromance of the purple, and one that turned out\n\nvery happily. For many years her late Majesty\n\nrefused resolutely to meet \"Mrs Fitzgeorge\" as\n\nthe morganatic wife was named, but at last\n\ncuriosity overcame her annoyance, and she con-\n\nfessed herself charmed by the beauty and at-\n\ntractiveness of the bride.\n\nThe memory of the old Duke of Cam-\n\nbridge, with his John Bull face and hearty\n\nmanners, his umbrella that tradition says\n\nhe always carried to reviews when acting\n\nas Commander-in-Chief of the British\n\nArmy, and the turbulent language that\n\npoured from his lips on the slightest pro-\n\nvocation — this memory is growing dim. Up\n\nto the year 1890 there was in his life a\n\nfrail figure of romance— an old lady with\n\na sweet face and a halo of silver hair.\n\nSixty years had passed since the bucks\n\nand gallant gentlemen of the town toasted\n\n'Louisa Fairbrother, the loveliest lady of\n\nLondon,' and an heir to the throne had\n\nstooped to marry her in defiance of the\n\nRoyal Marriages Act, and in the teeth of\n\nthe advice of his family and friends. On\n\na warm day in early spring she passed\n\naway, and in the hour of departing testi-\n\nfied that during the whole of her married\n\nlife nothing had occurred to mar the sweet\n\nfelicity of a union that had commenced\n\nwith sorrowful headshakes of those pro-\n\nphets of woe who declared that a mor-\n\nganatic marriage could never be a happy\n\none.\n\n— Hopes of a Throne. —\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge in his early life\n\nhad hopes - nay, almost a certainty — of\n\none day sitting upon the Throne of Great\n\nBritain. To understand the position\n\naright, and to appreciate the sacrifice that\n\nhe made for love, it is necessary to detail\n\nbriefly the tangled condition of the succes-\n\nsion to the Crown when George IV. died.\n\nGeorge III. had seven sons and five surviv-\n\ning daughters. It is a remarkable fact\n\nthat despite this large family the Crown\n\nGreat Britain seemed likely at one time to\n\npass from the House of Hanover. Of the\n\nseven sons all were childless when George\n\nIII. closed his weary eyes at Windsor. His\n\nsuccessor was married to Caroline of\n\nBrunswick, and long before she was\n\ndivorced it was known that there was no\n\npossibility of her giving the Crown an heir.\n\nThe next heir was the King's brother, who\n\nreigned, for a few years as William IV.\n\nHe also was childless. The remaining\n\nsons of George III were the Dukes of\n\nClarence, Cumberland, Sussex, Cambridge,\n\nand Kent. All of these were men of mid-\n\ndle age. The Duke of Kent and the Duke\n\nof Clarence, seeing the precariousness of\n\nthe succession, both decided to marry. The\n\nformer espoused the Princess of Saxe\n\nCoburg; Clarence fixed his choice upon a\n\ndaughter of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nThey were married within a few days of\n\neach other. If either of these wives gave\n\nbirth to a child the eldest would be the\n\ndirect heir to the Crown of Great Britain.\n\nFailing issue, the succession was so dubi-\n\nous that none could exactly say who would\n\ntake the place of William IV. For the\n\nDuke of Cumberland's claim to be the next\n\nheir was scarcely likely to be recognised.\n\n—The Princess Victoria. —\n\nWithin a year the new Duchess of\n\nClarence gave birth to a son, and in a few\n\nhours the little life had flickered out. The\n\nnation's interests were now centred upon\n\nthe Duchess of Kent. The Duke and\n\nDuchess had been residing for financial\n\nreasons— for the Duke was pursued by\n\nflocks of d..s whenever he set foot in Eng\n\nland—on the Continent. When, however,\n\nthe time for the accouchement of his\n\nDuchess drew near he felt that the\n\nexpected chiid must be born upon English\n\nsoil. In dire distress for money be ap-\n\nplied to a patriotic Englishman, the funds\n\nwere forthcoming, and after a tempestu-\n\nous journey the party landed at Dover\n\non May 22, 1819. After a tedious\n\ndrive to London they reached the apart-\n\nments set aside for them in Kensington\n\nPalace, and two days later (May 24, 1819)\n\nwas born a female child— a child destined\n\nto recreate the fortunes of the House of\n\nHanover, and to sit for over 60 years upon\n\nthe throne. The Princess Victoria, as\n\nshe was named, was therefore the heiress\n\nto the Crown. But a few months later\n\nthe Duke of Cambridge married, and his\n\nDuchess gave birth to a son. After anxious\n\ndebate it was decided that the Princess\n\nVictoria was the legitimate successor to\n\nthe Crown; but failing male issue the\n\ncrown would revert to the son of the Duke\n\nof Cambridge. It will thus be seen that\n\nuntil the birth of Queen Victoria's eldest\n\nson (King Edward), the late Duke of\n\nCambridge stood next in succession. The\n\nDuke of Cambridge, son of George III,\n\ndied when the son was quite young. But\n\non his twenty-first birthday he took the\n\ntitle of Duke. His position at Court,\n\nover which Victoria now reigned as Queen,\n\nwas a splendid one. For not only was he\n\ndirect heir failing male issue, as already\n\nexplained, but also it was generally be-\n\nlieved by the Court gossips that the young\n\nSovereign intended to take the advice of\n\nher Ministers and espouse the handsome\n\nyoung Duke who was her cousin. Then,\n\nit was argued, all the worries of the suc-\n\ncession would be at an end. But the\n\nMinisters and gossips had reckoned with\n\nout the influence of 'good Uncle Leopold'\n\n(Leopold I. of Belgium). He had other\n\nviews, and as all the world knows he\n\npushed forward the claims of a shy youth\n\n—a German princeling, without money or\n\ndistinction, but possessed of great talents\n\nfor work, and endowed with an uncommon\n\ndegree of integrity. He came to Wind-\n\nsor, Victoria fell passionately in love, and\n\nquickly she had proposed to 'dear, sweet\n\nAlbert,' and the wedding bells were ring-\n\ning for the nuptials of the young Queen\n\nand the studious Prince. The coming\n\nof the Princess Royal, followed by the\n\nbirth of Edward, Prince of\n\nWales, finally destroyed the hopes that\n\nthe Duke of Cambridge might have\n\nentertained of one day reigning\n\nas King of England. But before this some\n\nstartling events had happened. He had\n\nfallen violently in love. His choice had\n\nbeen fixed where, as a prince of the blood\n\nit ought not to be fixed. But love laughs\n\nat restrictions fixed by grave statesmen.\n\n— One of London's Loveliest Women. —\n\nThe Duke was 20 years of age when\n\n'love like a tornado came into my life.'\n\nThe manner of his meeting with his future\n\nwife was not devoid of romance. There\n\nwas at this time in London a young act-\n\nress named Louisa Fairbrother. At an\n\nearly age she went upon the stage, and\n\nachieved much success. By the time she\n\nwas 18 she had made herself a name, and\n\nhad achieved a reputation as one of the\n\nloveliest women in London. Naturally, in\n\nan age noted for its licentiousness, she was\n\npursued by clouds of dubious admirers;\n\nwith admirable good sense and tact she\n\nmanaged to keep the objectionable at\n\narm's length, and to avoid offending those\n\nwho might advance her in her profession.\n\nOn her nineteenth birthday she had an ad-\n\nventure that was destined to change the\n\nwhole current of her life. Returning from\n\na visit to Hendon her coach was stopped\n\non Hampstead Heath by the notorious\n\nhighwayman, 'Six-string Jack,' who,\n\nwhile in the act of taking toll from her\n\nlips as well as of her belongings, was at-\n\ntacked by a young gentleman who had\n\nridden up unperceived, 'Jack' fled in\n\na panic — for this sorry rogue was a great\n\ncoward, and made a wretched exhibition\n\nwhen brought out to be hanged at Ty-\n\nburn — and the newcomer was the hero of\n\nthe hour. He was the Duke. The chance\n\nmeeting ripened into friendship, and very\n\nsoon the possible heir to the throne was\n\nseen every day at the charming little\n\nhouse in Shepherd's Market, Mayfair,\n\nwhere 'lovely Louisa' lived with her aunt.\n\n'I was not only robbed of my purse and\n\ntrinkets,' wrote Louisa to a bosom friend,\n\n'but also my heart fell before the 'stand\n\nand deliver' of the noblest and the best\n\ngentleman in England. But, alas, he is\n\ntoo high above me in station for me to\n\nhope for the consummation of my hopes.'\n\nNaturally the affair was quickly blown\n\nabout the fashionable world. For Louisa\n\nFairbrother was too public a character,\n\nand the Duke too much in the eye of the\n\nworld, to allow of the intimacy to pass un-\n\nnoticed. The grave Lord Chancellor of\n\nEngland unwittingly brought matters to a\n\nhead.\n\n—'Good Gad, Sir!'—\n\nHe took the Duke on one side when en-\n\ncountering him at Windsor, and very pom-\n\npously and, perhaps, with little tact\n\nwarned him that \"his exalted position pre-\n\ncluded him from thinking of marriage with\n\nany but the blood-royal.\" The Duke had\n\nthe fiery blood of an undisciplined race in\n\nhis veins; he heard the harangue with a\n\ntapping heel and mounting colour. Ere it\n\nwas finished he had burst out with his\n\ncharacteristic expletive that many an army\n\nofficer quailed before in after days, 'Good\n\ngad, sir! Do you presume to lecture me,\n\nan heir to the throne, upon my matrimo-\n\nnial duties and obligations.' And so on\n\nand so forth, while the Lord Chancellor\n\ncoughed and stammered before the storm\n\nhe had raked. Events moved rapidly.\n\nMore and more open became the Duke's\n\nadoration of Louisa. A peer of the realm\n\nhappened to wait at the stage door with\n\na bouquet of flowers for the fascinating\n\nlittle actress, and the Duke of Cambridge,\n\nstruck to the heart with jealousy, seized\n\nthe bouquet and flung it into the mud, and\n\nfollowed this up with an attack upon the\n\nnobleman in which first canes and then\n\nfists came into play. A challenge to a\n\nduel followed, and only a personal request\n\nfrom the Queen to her cousin prevented\n\na meeting. It was than that Louisa,\n\nmoved, it is said, by an 'exalted\n\nperson,' wrote to the fiery Duke:—\n\n'These scenes and scandals, dearest, are to\n\nme as death. I have lost my happiness\n\nthrough them. I see but one way out—\n\nwe must separate. It cannot be right that\n\nI should place in jeopardy your bright\n\nprospects, for I am advised that a marriage\n\nbetween us would be fatal. And so I write\n\nthis with a breaking heart to wish my\n\nnoble lover good-bye. Believe me, sir, that\n\nit costs me something to write this.'\n\nWhen the Duke of Cambridge received this\n\nhe found love stronger than duty. He pro-\n\ncured a special licence, and the pair were\n\nmarried in Louisa's house by a Church of\n\nEngland clergyman. The bride's age was\n\n19, the bridegroom's 20. 'Love is stronger\n\nthan all else,' wrote the Duke to the Lord\n\nChancellor in announcing the marriage. 'I\n\ngive up all— everything— because love\n\nseems to me to be the better part.' And\n\nso their wedded life began — a union des-\n\ntined to run smoothly for nearly 60 years.\n\n—The Passing of the Years.—\n\nThe passing of the years brought changes,\n\nbut it did not dim the happiness of the\n\nyoung couple. Queen Victoria was 'fear-\n\nfully angry at the match; she thought the\n\nDuke had made a fool of himself, for an\n\nactress cannot make a good wife for a\n\nPrince' wrote the young Sovereign to her\n\nhusband, for the Prince was away at the\n\ntime. For long the wife of the Duke was\n\nnot mentioned by the Queen when she met\n\nher cousin, and the words 'The Duchess of\n\nCambridge' were never uttered in the\n\nQueen's hearing. The Duke's wife was now\n\nknown as 'Mrs. Fitzgeorge.' She took no\n\npart in society, but remained happily at\n\nhome engrossed by the love of her husband\n\nand the little family that quickly came to\n\ngladden their hearts. The day came, how\n\never, when Queen Victoria became curious\n\nto see this woman who held so firmly the\n\nheart of her cousin. A private meeting\n\nwas arranged, and 'Mrs. Fitzgeorge'\n\nentered the presence of her Sovereign.\n\nWith that lofty spirit that was\n\nso characteristic of Queen Vic\n\ntoria, she recorded her impressions: —\n\n'I was agreeably surprised by the D's\n\nwife; she seemed tolerably pretty, neither\n\nforward nor bashful. She also seemed in-\n\ntelligent, and Albert thinks that she makes\n\na perfect wife for the Duke, who has not,\n\nof course, the commanding mental powers\n\nthat my dear husband has. But I liked\n\nher immensely.' Comment upon this\n\nwould be superfluous. As their family in-\n\ncreased, the happy pair moved to a larger\n\nhouse in Queen's street, and their home\n\nbecame the centre of society and artistic\n\npeople. Mr. Gladstone was a frequent\n\nvisitor, and was wont to say that he re-\n\ngarded 'Mrs Fitzgeorge' as one of the\n\nmost attractive women he knew.\n\n—Summary Ejection. —\n\nWith advancing age the temper of the\n\nDuke did not lose its hastiness. On one\n\noccasion a pompous member of the Meck-\n\nlenburg-Schwerin family; being in London,\n\ncalled to see him. The wife coming into\n\nthe room, the proud Mecklenburg ignored\n\nher. The Duke seized the visitor, and,\n\nroaring to the butler to open the front\n\ndoor, propelled the unhappy man off the\n\npremises, administering a hearty kick as\n\nhe shot down the front steps.
