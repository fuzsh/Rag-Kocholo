        "text": "The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was a territory in Northern Germany held by the House of Mecklenburg residing at Schwerin. The Grand Duchy was bounded by the Baltic Sea in the north and the Prussian province of Pomerania in the northeast, where the border with the Prussian province of Lower Pomerania (formerly Swedish Pomeranian). In the south it bordered with the Prussian province of Brandenburg and in the southwest the Kingdom of Hanover, which was incorporated into the Prussian province of Hanover after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Mecklenburg was almost entirely surrounded by Prussian territory. (see map).\n\nIn 1867, Mecklenburg-Schwerin joined the North German Confederation and the Zollverein. In the Franco-Prussian War (1870â€“1871), Prussia again received valuable assistance from Grand Duke Frederick Francis II, who was an ardent advocate of German unity and held a high command in the Prussian army. In the course of the Unification of Germany in 1871, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz became states of the German Empire. After the 1866 War, Mecklenburg Schwerin military units were placed under command of the Prussian Army."
