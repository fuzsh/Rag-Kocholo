        "text": "The Schwerin Residence Ensemble in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region is an architectural and landscape ensemble most of which was built in the 19th century and dates back to the Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Apart from vast parks, the Residence Ensemble consists of more than 30 preserved buildings including palaces, sacred and cultural buildings, court infrastructure with court purveyors and official residences as well as administrative and military buildings.\n\nUNESCO has added Schwerin to its World Heritage Sites because: \"The Schwerin Residence Ensemble fits within the context of the emergence and development of the historicist style during the 19th century in Europe. Remarkably well-preserved, it constitutes an outstanding European royal residence ensemble of the 19th century by way of the richness and diversity of its architecture and landscape features, which express the whole spectrum of historicism, from neo-Renaissance to neo-Baroque and neo-Classicism, neo-Gothic and the regional “Johann-Albrecht” historicist style.\n\nkk/fw/pb"
