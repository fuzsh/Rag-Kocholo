        "text": "In 1807 Baron von Stein tried to carry through a reform of the Feudal system. He felt the peasants' and laborers' lot had to beimproved. He did not want to abolish the large Landholders, but they were to be limited in their political and administrativepowers and to improve the state of their workers. At that time, workers worked from sunrise to sunset for a pfennig an hour,a very small amount. The value of goods (potatoes, corn, wood, etc.) was deducted from that and most of their work was paidfor by these goods. Women and children performed heavy work. Baron von Stein's reform said that peasants could nowchange their place of residence without permission, and children were allowed to learn a trade. But the Landlords ought theseprogressive measures, refused to implement them, and the edict of Baron von Stein was never executed.\n\nFrom 1806 to 1813 the country suffered great hardship and destruction. This period came to be known to all Mecklenburgersas the \"Franzosentid\" ( period of French occupation). Robbery and pillage became commonplace. Both duchies,Mecklenburg Schwerin and Mecklenburg Strelitz, were forced to join the Confederation of the Rhine under Napoleon'sprotectorate. Of the more than 2,000 men who were conscripted from Mecklenburg to take part in Napoleon's campaign against Russia, less than one hundred came home again. After Napoleon's defeat in Russia, the dukes of both Mecklenburgs were among the first to renounce the alliance with France.In the War of German Liberation which followed (1813-1815), Mecklenburg played a significant part in defeating Napoleonand liberating Germany from France. In 1815, the dukes of Mecklenburg were elevated to \"Grand Dukes\", and Mecklenburgbecame a Grand Duchy. With the coming of peace, however, there also came a period of economic depression which lasteduntil the early 1820s. Legally, serfdom was abolished in Mecklenburg in 1820 and the peasants were freed from their obligations to land owners.But this worsened the conditions for most peasants because the land owners were freed , at the same time, of any obligationsunder feudal law to provide their tenants with any means of supporting themselves, thus leaving the peasants in even greaterpoverty. The servant of a noble landowner was not even permitted to marry unless his master gave him permission and a placeto live. Those villagers who were without land became cottagers or gardeners. Eventually they were simply known as day laborers(Tageloehners) and lived in poverty. They were deprived almost entirely of their earnings and thereafter were forced to workfor a starvation wage on the Junker estates. They traveled the countryside, moving from estate to estate as the land ownerrequired their labor for plowing, planting or harvesting crops. The life they lived gave no possibility of resistance in an effort tobetter their condition.\n\nMany peasants and labourers left Mecklenburg and emigrated to other countries s their conditions became unbearable. In the early 1840s, the liberal bourgeois party began to speak out against the noble landowners and the special privileges grantedthem. By 1848 there were secret meetings in many Mecklenburg towns of reform societies and a political revolution was adistinct possibility. However the revolution did not have enough support and eventually failed. The workers' situation inMecklenburg remained bleak until, under the Soviet Military Administration, in October 1945 there was a land reform and thelarge estates and their landholders disappeared. The government took over their land. The Mecklenburg Duchies joined the German Empire in 1871 and after World War I were declared states of the newGerman Republic. In 1934 they were united into a single German state of Mecklenburg. After World War II Mecklenburgbecame part of the Soviet Zone. The state was dissolved in 1952, when East Germany was reorganized into districts. Thearea remained behind the Iron Curtain and part of East Germany until 1990 when Germany was unified and the state ofMecklenburg-West Pomerania was created. The dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin had their castle (Schlo√ü) and main residence in the city of Schwerin. The seat of government and main home for the dukes of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was in Neustrelitz. Princess Sophie Charlotte ofMecklenburg-Strelitz became Queen Charlotte of England in 1761. Genealogical data concerning the house of Mecklenburgcan be found on the Internet Gotha, and some of its members can also be found in the royals databases at Hull and PSU."
