        "text": "The history of Mestlin\n\nThe Thirty-Years-War left a destructed land behind. A reconstruction takes place only slowly. In the following years, Mecklenburg has to suffer through a number of other smaller and bigger wars. In the 19th century, Mestlin develops to a pure estate-village. Just like anywhere in Mecklenburg, many inhabitants emigrate. The situation for the rural population hardly improves till World War II.\n\nIn1652, the effects of the Thirty-Years-War on Mestlin are, just like anywhere in Mecklenburg, tremendous. Only 12 peasantries remain.\n\n1654\n\nRabble-law with embodiment of serfdom\n\nAfter the rabble-law from 1645, that had already been enforced, the new \"Rabble - Day-Laborer - Peasant - Shepherd - Tax- and Victual-law\" is being passed on November 14th, 1654. It consolidates the worst way of suppression of peasants by the aristocrats. A marriage, for example, has to be allowed by the estate owner.\n\n1658\n\nSchwedisch-Polnischer Krieg\n\nIn 1658, Imperial, Brandenburgian, and Polish soldiers march into Mecklenburg. Warlike incriminations, just like at the time of the Thirty-Years-War, until the peace-treaty of Olivia in May 1660.\n\n1674 - 1675\n\nBrandenburg-Swedish war in Mecklenburg\n\n1688 Andreas Petri becomes pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\n1696 The effects of the Thirty-Years-War are still not overcome: there are only six peasantries in Ruest (house-people and people that own cottages): Hans Cords minor, Hans Cords, Köster, Soltow, Dolge and Möller.\n\n1700\n\nMecklenburg-Schwerin has not quite 100,000 inhabitants, Mecklenburg-Strelitz has 30,000\n\n1700 - 1721\n\nNordic War\n\nLootering by the war-parties: Sweden against Prussia, Denmark, Saxony, and Russia.\n\n1701\n\nThird major land seperation through the agreement of Hamburg\n\nMecklenburg is being seperated into Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg- Schwerin. One agrees on the primogenitural succession.\n\nIn1704, Mestlin has 109 inhabitants (over 14 years), Ruest has 64. In Mestlin live the house-people and people that own cottages: Hinrich Cords, Hans Hohe, Soltwedel, Hartwich Cordes, Westphal / Behrens, Kröger, Dolge, Nehls, Welzin, Joachim Cords minor. And in Ruest: Soltow, Stralendorff / Wiese, Hans Cords minor, Möller, Dolge, Soltwedel, Sülocke (Zülck), Köster, Hans Cords.\n\n1706 Georg Brennecke becomes the pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\n1711\n\nBeginning of deportments of people from Mecklenburg to the prussian army, the war is raging in Mecklenburg\n\n1717 Carl Helmut Neander becomes pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\n1731 the administrator of Mestlin around this time is Langhoff\n\n1733 / 1735\n\nViolent recruitment by Prussians in Mecklenburg\n\n1748 Building of a first windmill in Mestlin.\n\nUm 1748 Building of the brickyard in Mestlin.\n\n1751 Mestlin has 179 and Ruest 106 inhabitants.\n\n1751 the church is being built in today's shape.\n\n1753\n\nAt the same time, as the expropriation of the peasants (\"Bauernlegen\") by the aristocrats, the settlement of \"Häusler\" and \"Büdner\" (people that live in houses or cottages) began on the basis of the settlement decree by duke Christian Ludwig.\n\n1754; Johann Clamor Buchholz becomes pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\nApril 18th, 1755\n\nconstitutional heriditary settlement\n\nFurther embodiment of serfdom, legalisation of expropriation of peasants (\"Bauernlegen\"). Mecklenburg has 150,000 inhabitants at this time.\n\n1756 - 1763\n\nSeven-Years War\n\nPrussia occupies the neutral Saxony and fights against a coalition of Austria, Russia, France and Sweden, in the course of the war, Mecklenburg is being occupied a number of times (first in 1757) by Prussia, furthermore money- and payment in natural produces, forced recruitments (altogether approx. 4000 soldiers for the Prussian army) and lootings.\n\nAfter the war, finally a restricted progress takes place.\n\nPastors report 1784 / 1785\n\nThe pastor of Mestlin writes a church chronicle: \"In-depth news of church and parish-matters in Mestlin and Ruest, and what is necessary to know about the overview, set up and confirmed by enclosed documents, plans and tables, by Johann Clamor Buchholz, at this time pastor in Mestlin and Ruest, written in the years 1784 and 85\"\n\nPastor Buchholz put down the history of the village and its inhabitants in a unique way and meticulous completeness (216 pages). Buchholz covers, for example the history of the churches of Mestlin and Ruest, their patrons, their architectural composition. He copied documents, described parish lands, former and current parish villages and monastries of Mestlin. The part on the families of his monastry is of a special importance for geneological research (see publication of 1938).\n\nReprint 1938\n\nA part of the parish chronicle of Mestlin (see publicationn 1784 / 85) by Johann Clamor Buchholz is being printed under the title \"Of the old families of Mestlin - a chronicle\" in the framework of a series called \"sources to the rural court- and geneological research\".\n\nFor three periods of time (until 1648, 1648-1704, 1704-1785), the peasants and inhabitants of Mestlin, Ruest and Mühlenhof are being listed. Appearing special features are being interpreted and commented. 16 families, \"that are the strongest\" are being documented in great detail: Behrens, Cords, Dieckmann, Dolge, Eckelberg, Ehmck(e), Garling, Hohe, Kröger, Nehls, Soltau, Soltwedel, Wel(t)zin, Westphal, Wiese, Zülock(Sülck).\n\nA map from 1777 shows 15 peasanties in Mestlin, additionally the estate at the church, a forestry court and two courts of the mayor.\n\n1783; In Mestlin live: Johann Eckelberg, H.

On Johanni 1833 the 12 peasants of Mestlin are being settled over to Ruest. From the unsecure status as time-leaseholders they now became heriditary-leaseholders. From now on, Mestlin was a pure estate village, whereas Ruest was being upgraded to a big peasants' village, Ruest had 25 peasantries. At this time, the leaseholder of Mestlin is Karl Sauerkohl.\n\nIn1834, the step mill was built in Mestlin. Far visible it could still be the famous landmark of Mestlin, unfortunately it burnt down in 1945.\n\n1835 the fair justice, that Mestlin was entitled to until then, was transferred to Ruest.\n\nSeptember 3rd, 1847\n\nA grand-ducal decree rules the procedure for giving away passports to emigrants in Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\n1848 / 1849\n\nRevolution\n\nFebruary 5th, 1849\n\nA grand-ducal decree rules the \"general repeal of taxes for emigrants\" ... for the state of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\n1851\n\nBeginning of the mass emigration to America\n\nPolitical, social and economical problems caused the great emigration wave, at the end of the 19th century.

The constitution grants total freedom within the states of the North-German union, as well as in in the cross-border traffic for all union-members. The existing marriage restrictions are dropped. Mecklenburg was connected with the north-german mail- and telecommunication net and receives standardized measures and weights on the basis of the metric system, and the bank notes of the union.

In the 70ies of the 19th century, the houses (see picture below) of the day-laborers of the estate were built along the village street (today: Fritz-Reuter-Str., Goldberger Str.).\n\n1894 the lease-holder of Mestlin is H. Dehns.\n\nImportant historic book\n\n\"Mecklenburgische Vaterlandskunde\", by Wilhelm Raabe, Wismar 1894 is written about Mestlin:\n\nMestlin, post station, 1 1/4 mile to the west of Goldberg, important junction of our avenue-traffic, since the four avenues from Parchim, Crivitz, Sternberg and Goldberg unite here.

Schulz (Hinstorff Verlag, 1938) could be from this time from Mestlin:\n\nA boy of maybe seven years from an estate village came late to school, because he overslept. The teacher asked him, when he went to bed. \"I dunno,\" was the answer. The teacher replies: \"Was it dark out?\" After a short moment, the boy replied: \"We could still plow.\"\n\n1895 Karl Axel Walter pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\nAt the end of 1895 there were 270 people living in Mestlin, and 305 in Ruest.\n\n1897\n\nimperial law that ruled emigration\n\nAround the turn of the century, Hans Dehn is lease-holder of Mestlin.\n\nDocumentary book written around the turn of the century\n\nHow could the village Mestlin have looked like around the turn of the century? An unemployed from Berlin (name is unknown), that somehow got to an estate in Mecklenburg, describes his experiences: \"Life of a farm-walker in Mecklenburg\".\n\nWith simple words he characterizes the people he meets: inspector, farmhands, maids, day-laborers and farm-walkers (... in the point of view of a person from Mecklenburg are the farm-walkers coming here of no good what-so-ever. ...), he describes the village, the manor, Lüstuw, cottages, ... and the daily life of the people. (picture on the right: picture postcard from Mestlin, approx. 1905)\n\nAugust 1st, 1914 - November 11th, 1918\n\nWorld War I\n\n1917Bernhard Berckemeyer (picture on the right, 1937 in Weisin) leases the estate Mestlin. Owner is the monastry of Dobbertin. A year later, the entire property of the monastry is being taken over by the state.\n\nB. has been leasing the estate of Weisin near Lübz since 1906. In 1936 he buys the former estate of his parents in Gr. Thurow back.\n\nIn 1917, Mestlin was in a very bad shape. The approx. 60 families led a hard life. In the middle of the 20-ies, B. irrigates big areas in order to build the estate up again. B. hired the governor Briese for Vimfow, for Mestlin he hires the horse governor Prestin. At that time, Hahn was the governor of Mestlin.\n\n1914 - 1918 Again, there are victims among the people from Mestlin: memory board on the cemetery.\n\nNovember 14th, 1918\n\nabdication of the grand-duke\n\n1918\n\nTakeover of the administration of the monastry of Dobbertin by the free state Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\n1918 Friedrich Wehner becomes pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\n1918 / 1919\n\nFounding of the free states Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1919) and Mecklenburg- Strelitz (1918) as member states of the republic of Weimar\n\n1925\n\nMecklenburg-Schwerin has 674,000 inhabitants, Mecklenburg-Strelitz has 110,000\n\n1926 B. Berckemeyer realizes extensive irrigation measures in Mestlin.\n\nProperty lease-holder Major a. D. Berckemeyer was the leading force in the soldier union of Mestlin. The union arranged a number of social events (soldier dances, meetings, children's fairs).\n\nA marriage in Mestlin (Hermann Konow, cartwright, 1927)\n\n1934 Otto Schmidt becomes pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\n1933\n\nBoth parts of Mecklenburg have 805.000 inhabitants\n\n1934\n\nCombining of both parts of Mecklenburg to the district Mecklenburg\n\nBook written 1986\n\nIn 1986, the autobiography of Irene Zacharias is published under the title: \"My seven children and the course of the world\" (267 pages).\n\nIrene Zacharias, born in 1903 in Berlin marries the peasant Paul Holz in Poitendorf near Parchim in 1924. In 1938, the family takes over a farm in Ruest, that's 200 Morgen big (a \"Morgen\" is an obsolescent unit of measurement comprising between 2,500 and 3,400 square meters). There she lives until 1951. In simple moving words she describes her experiences and thereby the conditions of that time in Mestlin and Ruest. Mentioned are for example the neighbors Wahrmann and Ehmcke, the peasants Nehls, Dollase, Peglau, Radke, the peasants' wives Elsa Welzin, Ida Rinsche, the landlord Brennke, the mayor Martens. In the foreground however, stands the history of her family, the history of her eight children.\n\n1939 Friedrich Heise becomes pastor of Mestlin / Ruest\n\nMestlin has 1939 369 inhabitants\n\nIn 1939, Mecklenburg has 900,593 inhabitants"
