I am trying to find family photos of that line, and appreciate any suggestions you may have.

It has not been updated with her death, however. Karin-Elisabeth von Schaper\n\nAre you familiar with the noble family, von Johnston? I have traced them back to the 1500's in Scotland where they originated before immigrating to Poland and Germany. It was helpful that Baron Max v. Johnston published his family history in 1891 - and I found it in the World Catalog online. It was still available from the State Library in Berlin. The v. Johnstons are also related by marriage to the \"Red Baron\" Manfred von Richthofen.

She was killed in air accident but had a child by husband Hassan Sayed Kamil (1918 - ????). The daughter was named Sheila Kamil, born July 28, 1958 in Chur, Switzerland.\n\nI made some enquires about Hassan Sayed Kamil and was told he died sometime in the 1990s but not sure of the exact date, however with this I managed to find a death record for a Hassan Sayed Kamil, who died 19 September 1991, Sidney, British Columbia aged 72 which matches with his date of birth, where he emigrated to and what I was told regarding his death so I'm quite certain it is the widow of Duchess Helene.\n\nSheila Kamil was living in the USA.\n\nVIEW - SEARCH BC ARCHIVES\n\nLast edited: Jul 22, 2012\n\nDWC\n\nGentry\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n83\n\nCity\n\nLondon\n\nCountry\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nRecently Duke Borwin and his sister Marie Katharina were in St Petersburg for the 150th anniversary of the St Petersburg Conservatory.\n\nNews - Duke of Mecklenburg in Russia | House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nSt Petersburg Conservatory | Flickr - Photo Sharing!\n\nDWC\n\nGentry\n\nJoined\n\nJun 22, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n83\n\nCity\n\nLondon\n\nCountry\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nEvery year at Christmas a picture of the children of Duke Borwin gets released.
