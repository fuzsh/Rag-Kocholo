        "text": "Before the German conquest 1160 was Mecklenburg inhabited by Slavic tribes, the most important of these were the Obodrites, but thereafter were the Slavs gradually assimilated by the German settlers that arrived in large numbers. It had been the Saxon duke Heinrich the Lion that had conquered Mecklenburg and he installed a descendent of the Obodrites princes (Pribislaw) as his vassal. After having been under Danish supremacy 1200-1227 was Mecklenburg once again German, but the overlordship of it was claimed by both Saxony and Brandenburg until the Mecklenburg princes were elevated to dukes 1348 whereby Mecklenburg became subordinated only to the German Emperor.\n\nPrincipality of Mecklenburg\n\nMecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz was merged 1934 and formed the \"Land Mecklenburg\". This was in its turn merged after World War Two with Vorpommern to create the East German part state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, which already in 1952 was dissolved into three districts (Rostock, Schwerin and Neubrandenburg). Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was restored as a German part state after the unification 1990.\n\nOther Mecklenburg States\n\nBelow are those states that were created through inheritance partitions of Mecklenburg listed in alphabetical order"
