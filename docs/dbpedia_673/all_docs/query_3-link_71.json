        "text": "Does Germany have a royal family? No, modern-day Germany has never had a monarch. However, from 1871 through 1918, the German Empire consisted of Kingdoms, Grand Duchies, Duchies, and Principalities, and all had royal families whose linage could be traced back to the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nWhat Happened to the German Royal Family?\n\nThe German Empire united all the scattered parts of Germany under one king, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King of Prussia. However, unlike Britain, where the monarchy has only a constitutional role, the German Royals were directly involved in the government and the war. Therefore, after the defeat in World War I, they were the target of the people's wrath.\n\nThe German or November Revolution\n\nUnrest across the German Empire following the loss of World War I sparked the November Revolution. On November 9, 1918, when a parliamentary democracy was proclaimed, the Prussian monarchy and Germany's other constituent monarchies were abolished. On August 19, 1919, when the Weimar Constitution went into effect, all the German nobility's legal privileges and titles were forever abolished. However, former hereditary titles are still allowed as part of the surname.\n\nGerman Royal Family Surnames\n\nMost German royal last names related to the family's place of origin. These surnames are now preceded by the preposition von (meaning \"of\") or zu (meaning \"at\"). The two are sometimes used together, von und zu, meaning \"of and at\". Generally, von reveals the family's place of origin, while zu says the family is still in possession of the estate from which the surname is drawn. For example, Georg Friedrich von Preussen is the great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the last king of Prussia.\n\nRoyal Families in Germany\n\nSome German Royal Family dynasties are the Conradines, Carolingians, Salians, Ottonians, Supplinburger, Hohenstaufen, Welf, Wettin, Nassau, Habsburg, Luxemburg, Lorraine, Wittelsbach, Habsburg-Lorraine, Bonaparte and Hohenzollern.\n\nThe Last German Kings\n\nIn November 1918, following the German Empire's defeat in World War I, all the German Empire's kings either stepped down or were forced to abdicate.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II\n\nGerman Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was from the Hohenzollern dynasty and was the last King of Prussia. Following World War I, he fled to the Netherlands, where he spent the rest of his life. He was forced to abdicate from both the imperial throne and the Kingdom of Prussia on November 28, 1918. His abdication formally ended the house of Hohenzollern.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II has seven children:\n\nWilhelm, German Crown Prince of Prussia, was the last Crown Prince of the German Empire\n\nPrincess Victoria Louise of Prussia was Kaiser Wilhelm's only daughter\n\nPrince Wilhelm Keitel Friedrich Christian Karl of Prussia\n\nPrince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia\n\nPrince Adalbert of Prussia\n\nPrince Oskar of Prussia\n\nPrince August Wilhelm of Prussia\n\nKing Ludwig III\n\nLudwig III was from the Wittelsbach dynasty was the last King of Bavaria. On November 7, 1918, Ludwig fled with his family from Munich. On November 12, 1918, the Wittelsbachs were deposed, bring to an end their 700-year rule over Bavaria.\n\nLudwig III had 13 children:\n\nRupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Adelgunde of Bavaria\n\nMaria Ludwiga, Princess of Bavaria\n\nKarl, Prince of Bavaria\n\nFranz, Prince of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Mathilde of Bavaria\n\nPrince Wolfgang of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Hildegard of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Notburga of Bavaria (died as an infant)\n\nPrincess Wiltrud of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Helmtrud of Bavaria (died as a child)\n\nPrincess Dietlinde of Bavaria (died as an infant)\n\nPrincess Gundelinde, Princess of Bavaria\n\nKing Frederick Augusta III\n\nFrederick Augustus III from the Wettin dynasty was the last King of Saxony. He voluntarily abdicated his throne on November 13, 1918.\n\nFrederick Augusta III had seven children:\n\nFriedrich August Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony. After becoming a Jesuit priest, he is thought to have been assassinated in 1943 by the SS or Gestapo.\n\nFriedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen, Duke of Saxony\n\nErnst Heinrich\n\nMaria Alix Carola (stillborn)\n\nMargarete Carola Wilhelmine\n\nMaria Alix Luitpolda\n\nAnna Monika Pia\n\nKing William II\n\nWilliam II from the Württemberg dynasty was the last King of Württemberg. King William II abdicated on November 30, 1918. William II had three children but no living sons, which ended the royal branch of the House of Württemberg.\n\nWilliam II's Children:\n\nPrincess Pauline of Württemberg\n\nPrince Ulrich of Württemberg (died in infancy)\n\nA stillborn daughter (April 24, 1882)\n\nThe Last of the German Nobility\n\nGerman Grand Dukes, Dukes, and Rulers of Principalities also abdicated in 1918.\n\nThe Last German Grand Dukes\n\nFredrich II was the last Grand Duke of Baden.\n\nEarnest Louis was the last Grand Duck Hesse.\n\nFrederick Francis IV was the last Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nFrederick Augustus II was the last Grand Duke of Oldenburg.\n\nWilhelm Earnest was the last Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.\n\nThe Last German Dukes\n\nJoachim Ernst was the last Duke of Anhalt.\n\nEarnest Augustus was the last Duke of Brunswick.\n\nErnst II was the last Duke of Saxe-Altenburg.\n\nCharles Edward was the last Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nBernhard III was the last Duke of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nThe Last German Rulers of Principalities\n\nLeopold IV was the final Prince of the Principality of Lippe.\n\nAdolf was the last Prince of the small Principality, Schaumburg-Lippe.\n\nGunther Victor was the final Prince of the Principalities of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadn and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.\n\nFriedrich was the last Prince of the Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont.\n\nHeinrich XXIV was the last Prince of the Principality Rueuss-Greiz.\n\nHeinrich XXVII was the final Prince of the Principality Reuss-Gera.\n\nGermany's Current Royals\n\nEven though Germany abolished its nobility in 1918, the remaining fortune and status of different royal families in the country are significant. They are still a topic of conversation, and the heads of former royal dynasties often make headlines in the German press. As a matter of fact, the Thurn und Taxis dynasty has an official website and Facebook page.\n\n© 2024 LoveToKnow Media. All rights reserved."
