        "text": "Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (born Friedrich Franz Michael von Mecklenburg) is the 5th and current Grand Duke of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg and the current head of the House of Mecklenburg, succeeding his father Friedrich Franz III in 1897. Since the death of his relative Adolf Friedrich VI in 1918, he also functions as the prince regent of the neighboring Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nHis uncle, Adolf Friedrich, rules as the Duke of the United Baltic Duchy since November 1918.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nBorn on 9 April 1882, Duke Friedrich Franz IV was the son of Friedrich Franz III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, at that time still hereditary Grand Duke, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia. The family spent most of the year in Sicily as Friedrich Franz' father suffered from asthma, circulatory problems and acute eczema.\n\nIn 1883, his grandfather, Friedrich Franz II, died aged 60; Therefore his father became the next Grand Duke, and Friedrich became Crown Prince. The family only visited Mecklenburg during the summer, as soon as winter was coming they returned to Southern Europe, where they owned several properties in Sicily and Southern France.\n\nGrand Duke of Mecklenburg[]\n\nIn 1897, Friedrich's father died in his garden in Cannes when he experienced breathing difficulties and staggered around before falling over a low wall. Friedrich, only 15 at that time, was attending high school in Dresden at that time."
