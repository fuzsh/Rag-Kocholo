        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: In response to the post on the Birth of Adolph-Friedrich V, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, I was asked if the Schwerin and Strelitz line of the House of Mecklenburg intermarried. So starting with today’s post I will examine this question in a short series. Today we begin with some back ground information.\n\nLike many German territories, Mecklenburg was sometimes partitioned and re-partitioned among different members of the ruling dynasty. In 1621 Mecklenburg was divided into the two duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nPrior to the Duchy being divided in 1621 Mecklenburg was ruled by Johann VII of Mecklenburg (March 7, 1558 – March 22, 1592) (sometimes called Johann V, that will take another post to explain). Johann VII was the son of Johann-Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Schwerin (1525–1576), and his wife Duchess Anna Sophia of Prussia (1527–1591). Johann was eighteen years old when his father died and he succeeded as the Duke of Mecklenburg. A regency council was appointed that ruled in his name for the next nine years.\n\nThe regency handed over the actual rule of his territories to him in 1585. He immediately faced problems that he was ill-equipped to deal with, including massive debt and his uncle Christopher’s demands for territorial concessions. After an especially harsh argument with his uncle, he committed suicide.\n\nJohann VII, Duke of Mecklenburg.\n\nOn February 17, 1588 Johann married Sophia (1569 – 1634), a daughter of Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and his wife Christine of Hesse. They had three children:\n\n* Adolf Frederick I (1588 – 1658). Through Adolf-Friedrich I would spring both the Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz lines of the family.\n\n* Johann-Albert II (1590 – 1636). From Johann-Albert II came the short lived Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow line.\n\n* Anna Sophia (1591 – 1648)\n\nJohann-Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow\n\nAfter the suicide of Duke Johann VII, Adolf-Friedrich I and his brother Johann-Albert II reigned jointly under the guardianship of Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and Charles I of Mecklenburg (their father’s uncles). The two brothers took over governance of Mecklenburg-Schwerin beginning on April 16, 1608, after the death of Duke Ulrich III and after the death of Duke Charles I on July 22, 1610 they also governed in the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nDivision of Mecklenburg and Thirty Years’ War\n\nIn 1621 the Duchy of Mecklenburg was formally divided between the two brothers, with Adolf-Friedrich I ruling in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Johann-Albert II ruling in Mecklenburg-Güstrow.\n\nAdolf-Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nDuring the Thirty Years’ War, Albrecht von Wallenstein ousted both of the dukes after they secretly sided with King Christian IV of Denmark against Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II. Wallenstein ruled the duchies from 1627 until 1631, when the dukes were restored by the Swedes under King Gustaf II Adolph. In 1634 Adolf-Friedrich I succeeded Ulrik of Denmark as last Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin before its secularisation.\n\nDuke Adolf-Friedrich I died on February 27, 1658 (aged 69) and his eldest son, Christian-Ludwig I, (December 1, 1623 in Schwerin – June 21, 1692 in The Hague) became the reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Christian-Ludwig I’s mother was Anna-Maria (1601–1634), the daughter of Count Enno III of East Frisia.\n\nThe next post will examine the descendants of Duke Adolf-Friedrich I and the Mecklenburg-Schwerin family line.\n\nThe post after that will focus on Johann-Albert II of Mecklenburg-Güstrow which lead to further division of the Duchy.\n\nAdolf-Friedrich II (October 9, 1658 – May 12, 1708), Duke of Mecklenburg, was the first Duke of the Mecklenburg-Strelitz, reigning from 1701 until his death. Mecklenburg-Strelitz was a part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nAdolf-Friedrich II, Duke of the Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nBiography\n\nAdolf-Friedrich II was born in Grabow as the posthumous son of Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg (1588-1658) and his second wife, Maria-Catharina of Brunswick-Dannenberg (1616–1665).\n\nDivision of Mecklenburg and Thirty Years’ War\n\nThe Duchy of Mecklenburg had many complex divisions which I will cover in another blog entry. Briefly, the grandson’s of Duke Heinrich IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Heinrich V (1479-1552) and Albrecht VII (1486-1547) respectively, again divided the duchy, creating the subdivision of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, which Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin inherited in 1610.\n\nIn a second partition of 1621 the duchy of Mecklenburg was formally divided again between brothers, with Adolf-Friedrich I ruling in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Johann-Albrecht II ruling in Mecklenburg-Güstrow. During the Thirty Years’ War, Albrecht von Wallenstein ousted the dukes after they secretly sided with King Christian IV of Denmark against Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II.\n\nWallenstein ruled the duchies from 1627 until 1631, when the dukes were restored by the Swedes under King Gustaf II Adolph. In 1634 Adolf-Friedrich I succeeded Ulrik of Denmark, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (son of King Christian IV of Denmark and his consort Queen Anne Catherine of Brandenburg) as last Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin before its secularization.\n\nAdolf-Friedrich I, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nBy his first wife, Anna-Maria of East Frisia, daughter of Count Enno III of East Frisia and Anna of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg‘s eldest son Christian-Ludwig I, (1623-1692) became Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on his father’s death in 1658. Despite two marriages, first to his cousin Christine-Margaret (1615-1666), the second daughter of Duke John-Albrecht II of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, second to Elisabeth Angelique de Montmorency, Duchesse de Coligny, (b. 1626), Christian-Ludwig I died childless and he was succeeded as Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by his nephew Friedrich-Wilhelm, the eldest son of Duke Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Grabow.\n\nBy his second wife, Marie-Catharina (1616–1665), daughter of Duke Julius-Ernst, Duke of Brunswick-Dannenberg, and Maria of East Frisia (1582–1616), Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg‘s eldest son from this union was Friedrich I Duke of Mecklenburg-Grabow. Friedrich I married Landgravine Christine-Wilhelmine of Hesse-Homburg (1653-172) was the eldest daughter of Wilhelm-Christoph, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg and his first wife Sophia-Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt. Their eldest son was Friedrich-Wilhelm, the successor to his uncle, Christian-Ludwig I, as Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nIn 1695, came the death of Gustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, who was the son of Duke Johann-Albrecht II of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and his third wife Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg (1600–1657), daughter of Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg. with the death of Gustaf-Adolph the Mecklenburg-Güstrow branch of the House of Mecklenburg became extinct and Adolph-Friedrich II’s nephew, Friedrich-Wilhelm, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, laid claim to the inheritance, a move which Adolph-Friedrich II opposed.\n\nThe dispute was settled in 1701, when Adolph-Friedrich II reached an agreement with his nephew, Duke Friedrich-Wilhelm, to take as his inheritance the Principality of Ratzeburg and the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nFollowing his death in 1708, Adolph-Friedrich II was succeeded as Duke by his son, Adolph-Friedrich III.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nIn 1684 Adolph-Friedrich II married firstly to Princess Maria of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1659-1701), daughter of Gustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow and his wife Magdalene-Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp, a daughter of Duke Friedrich III of Holstein-Gottorp and his wife Duchess Marie Elisabeth of Saxony.\n\nThey had five children:\n\n* Duke Adolph-Friedrich III of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1686-1752).\n\n* Duchess Magdalena Amalia of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1689-1689).\n\n* Duchess Maria of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1690-1690).\n\n* Duchess Eleonore Wilhelmina of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1691-1691).\n\n* Duchess Gustave Caroline of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1694-1748) she married Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nChristian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nOn June 20, 1702, Adolf-Friedrich II married secondly, Princess Johanna of Saxe-Gotha (1680-1704), a daughter of Friedrich I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, and Magdalena Sybille of Saxe-Weissenfels. There were no children from this marriage.\n\nOn June 10, 1705 at Neustrelitz, Adolf-Friedrich II married thirdly to Princess Christiane-Emilie of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (1681-1751), a daughter of Christian-Wilhelm I, Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and Countess Antonie Sybille of Barby-Mühlingen (1641–1684). They had two children:\n\n* Duchess Sophia Christina Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1706-1708).\n\n* Duke Charles-Ludwig-Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1708-1752), Prince of Mirow.\n\nDuke Charles-Ludwig-Friedrich of Mecklenburg-Strelitz married on February 5, 1735 to Princess Elisabeth-Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen, daughter of Ernst-Friedrich I, Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1681 – 1724) and his wife Countess Sophia Albertine of Erbach-Erbach (1683–1742).\n\nThey had ten children, six of whom survived into adulthood:\n\nOne of his daughters was Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (1744-1818) who married, 1762, King George III of Great Britain and Ireland from October 25, 1760 until the union of the two countries on January 1, 1801, after which he was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland until his death in 1820.\n\nDuchess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n\nThis mean that through his granddaughter Charlotte, Adolf-Frriedrich II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is the great-grandfather of two future British monarchs, George IV and William IV; Charlotte, Queen of Württemberg; Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the father of Queen Victoria; and Ernst-August, King of Hanover, Adolphus-Frederick, Duke of Cambridge is named for him, Further Adolf-Frriedrich II is the ancestor of every British monarch beginning with George IV, who ascended the throne of the United Kingdom in 1820.\n\nAncestry\n\nAdolf-Frriedrich II was a fourth-generation descendant of Gustaf I Vasa, King of Sweden, and his second Queen consort Margareta Leijonhufvud through their second child and first daughter Katharina of Sweden. Katharina was consort to Edzard II, Count of East Frisia. East Frisia played a prominent role in the spreading of the Protestant Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire during the 16th century and was thus a natural ally for Protestant Sweden.\n\nTheir daughter Maria, Princess of East Frisia (1582–1616), became consort to Julius-Ernst, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1571–1636). They were the maternal grandparents of Adolf Friedrich II. He is a distant relative of Lord Louis Mountbatten of Burma, the last Viceroy of India."
