        "text": "Share:\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, one of the style icons in Europe was the princess and duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the daughter of the grand duke Mecklenburg-Schwerin Friedrich Franz III and the Russian grand duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna. She in 1905 married the heir to the throne of the German Empire Crown Prince Wilhelm.\n\nThe woman was tall - 182 cm, slim, had dark hair, perfect skin and expressive eyes. Thanks to her calm and benevolent nature, she was loved both at court and among the people. She quickly became one of the most popular members of the imperial family.\n\nPhoto © gazeta.ua\n\nCecilia has become one of the most fashionable and stylish ladies of the empire. Cleverly emphasized the natural beauty of elegant dresses. Many Germans copied her hairstyles and clothes.\n\nThe couple had six children - 4 sons and 2 daughters. The marriage looked perfect, but because of the betrayal of William, conflicts flared repeatedly. There was a time when Cecilia even thought about suicide. In response, the princess started a romance with the personal adjutant of Crown Prince Otto von Dungern-Oberau."
