        "text": "SchwerinCastle: A step into the Romantic era\n\nOnce the house of Dukes of Mecklenburg, Schwerin, the majestic palace we are discussing now was the residence of Mecklenburg-Vorpommernstate Parliament. The city itself has lent its name to the castle. Schwerin Castle ranks first among the romantic historicism works in all of Europe and rightly, it is on its way of becoming a world heritage site due to the beautiful amalgamation of art and nature that it presents. The city has no universities, so the young generation must leave the city for higher education, leaving behind a serene, unperturbed provincial charm that engulfs the entire town. It is also the smallest town in Germany in terms of population with barely 100,000 citizens. Those who visit spend at least an hour and a half among the 653 rooms inside the castle, majorly furnished with marquetry floors, strolling through the awe-inspiring ancestral gallery. The visitors also have the advantage of visiting the enchanting throne room of the Grand Duke.\n\nOne word that has time and again been used to describe this castle is ‘magical’, and it is often addressed as the original fairy tale castle, with its gilded domes and statues, it is a jaw- dropping, marvelous piece of architecture. It is incredibly picturesque, like a scene right out of a historical romance novel of the romantic era. Guided tours and audio tours are also provided to the tourists but since the castle is a museum and the seat of the state Parliament, the opening and closing times are rigid and must be kept in mind while visiting.\n\nLocation\n\nSchwerin is the capital of Mecklenburg, Vorpommern state, Germany. The castle is city’s main attraction, crowing an island surrounded by Lake Schwerin and Lake Bergsee. Most of the city’s festivities and legends are based on the castle and its surrounding lakes. It also lends deeply to Schwerin’s long history stretching through generations.\n\nWeather\n\nIt is almost as if the very air of the city embraces you in its breezy self. Despite the rain that surrounds Schwerin all year round, it is so bright that you know it is where you always wanted to be as soon as you arrive in the city.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first recorded date related to the castle was AD 973 when it was a fort belonging to Polabian Slav tribe of the Obotrites. In 1160, the Obotrites under Niklot wrecked the fort before leaving due to Germanic military dominance. The fort stood right above an island, making it a crucial battlefront. So its German conquers rebuilt it.\n\nA couple of centuries later, in 1358, descendants of Niklot who had now become Dukes (in 1948), purchased the entire Schwerin. They had come from a place near Wismar, Mikelenburg, to Schwerin. Their status and the gothic era demanded expansion of the fort. At this time, they also built the Bischofshaus, or the Bishop’s house, that you can still see standing there. Another couple of centuries later, Duke Johann Albrecht converted it into a palace, adding in on the romantic charm with the removal of the defensive front of the castle. A few more years into the century, the Duke rebuilt the Chapel, making it the very first newly constructed Protestant Church of the state.\n\nThe Thirty Years’ War hindered the reconstruction plan of the castle by the architect Gerhart Evert Pilooth. Later, Duke Friedrich Franz planned a rebuilding of the entire palace. His plans were implemented and only parts of the original 16th and 17th century remain today. Fast forward a few centuries that involved a change in its interior by Heinrich Starck and architectural changes from Berlin architect Friedrich August Stuler and Dresden architect Gottfried Semper. A huge portion of the castle got destroyed by fire in 1913. Before the reconstruction could be completed, the 1918 revolution resulted in the Grand Duke’s resignation. Some years later, it was tragically discovered that one-half of the castle was descending underground as it had been built on sandy soil.\n\nThe present day castle owes its grandeur to the Grand Duke Friedrich Franz. The present day castle as visible today was built from 1845-47. After a brief term as a museum, it was then used by the Parliament, and then used as a college for Kindergarten teachers, then a museum again. The castle finally became the residence of Parliament in 1990. Although castle itself is a spectacular work of art with its glorious towers and intricate turrets, its art museum contains all the work collected by the many Dukes who lived in the castle, detailing their history.\n\nThe City\n\nThe tranquil heart of the metropolitan Hamburg established in 1161; the city has a historical past that is deeper than the many lakes it is surrounded by. The narrow lanes invite you to explore them, to walk through the cobbled market, the pottery market. Or perhaps take a walk on the wooded shores of Schwerin lake, take a dip in it and breathe in its freshness as it replenishes your soul.\n\nTraveling in the City\n\nYou will never be short of buses and trains. The city is interconnected and connected to Berlin, Hamburg, and Rostock through trains. However, the best way to travel Schwerin will always be through bicycles. The town is small, and it’s as if the streets are made for the bicycles.\n\nWhy Visit?\n\nWell, why not? June and July are filled with festivals. The five lakes run an average of 3000 runners come to compete. They must choose one of three routes ranging for 10 km to 30 km and have to run across the castle island Schlossinsel, through the shores of five lakes leaving behind parkland and woods). The Christopher Street Day (held in various cities across Europe protesting discrimination against the LGBT community and celebrating their rights and their true selves) and Dragon Boat festival (over 3500 participants compete in teams on bright coloured boats that have artistically painted face and tail of dragons on either end), followed by Old town festival Wine festival (where people rake their passion for wine to a different level altogether), and literaturtage (Schwerin literary festival held in Autumn).\n\nIf these are not enough, then come for the Drachenboot festival, a water sport where over twenty people paddle one boat, with one person sitting right in the end to navigate and one seated in the front to beat drums. Both males or females can participate, and they generally choose a name that has a deeper meaning, as the origin of the team or the reason behind them being a team). The International Horticultural show – every gardener’s dream, on the grounds surrounding Schwerin castle, with a floating bridge,Castle Theatre (a spectacular display of performances portraying and arousing several emotions against the backdrop Schwerin Castle in the open air) see the opera festival (started small in 1993, now attended by thousands and thousands of spectators) that attracts wanderers from all over the globe, exhibiting works by Puccini to Verdi. Still not enough? Then come to see the Western Pomerania festival, or the Filmkunst festival.\n\nThen explore Petermannchen, a tiny, pleasant spirit that is believed to live in Schwerin Castle. He is believed to be the keeper of the castle, awarding the good and chasing away the bad through his pranks and tricks. Also, it is said that at night he used to move around the castle producing cacophony to save the castle soldiers on guard who fall asleep from facing consequences.\n\nMajor attractions\n\nSchwerin Cathedral – A monument standing tall since the 13th century, its Gothic Brick style is worth exploring. Its construction started in the year 1172 and was completed seventy-six years later in 1248. The churches that served as models for the Cathedral are the St. Mary’s Church in Lubeck, the cathedral of Ratzeburg and Nikolaikirche in Stralsund.\n\nSchlossgarten – An 18th-century baroque pleasure garden with orangery, a delicate cast iron and glass construction which is unique to German architecture, what’s stopping you?\n\nStaatliche’s Museum – The art museum and gallery is every art lover’s dream, holding Dutch and Flemish pieces ranging from the 17th century and various other priceless medieval collections like the Neustadt Altarpiece and Furstenberg porcelain. The museum is specifically renowned for holding one of the largest, most significant and most bewitching collection of Marcel Duchamp, the exceptionally talented French-American artist.\n\nSchelf Church of St Nicholas – Built in 1238, and rebuilt in 1713 (having been destroyed by a storm and built again in baroque style) it currently stands tall. In this dedication to Saint Nicholas is an Evangelical Lutheran Church, owned by a local congregation and is the burial ground of the House of Mecklenburg – Schwerin.\n\nMecklenburg State Theatre – An 1886 neo-Renaissance palace that hosts plays, operas, musicals, ballet performances.
