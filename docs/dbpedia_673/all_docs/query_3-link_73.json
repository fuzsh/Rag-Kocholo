        "text": "Well! Couldn’t I have an interest in this indeed! I’ve been pegged, @racefortheironthrone.\n\nObviously, I can’t talk about every monarchy in every part of the world at every time, but I’ll give you a few examples I know of and discuss them a little bit.\n\nWhy do royals marry non-royals? Well, despite their bluer-than-blue bloodlines and eminent titles, royals are people too, and people can - and do - get infatuated and fall in love with people you might not expect. Of course every case is individual to the person, but at least what I tend to find is that those royal who marry dynastically unequal partners just, well want to be married to that person.\n\nNaturally, given the exclusive nature of hereditary monarchy, certain tradeoffs usually came as a result of unequal marriages. When Prince Wilhelm of Prussia - eldest son of Wilhelm, German Crown Prince and his wife Cecile of Mecklenburg-Schwerin - announced that he wanted to marry the commoner Dorothea von Salviati (whom he had fallen in love with while they were students together at Bonn), his grandfather, the deposed Kaiser Wilhelm II, swiftly told him, “Remember, there is every possible form of horse. We are thoroughbreds, however, and when we conclude a marriage such as with Fräulein von Salviati, it produces mongrels, and that cannot be allowed to happen”. (Wilhelm, you might be pleased to know, married Dorothea anyway, though he renounced any right to the succession of the defunct German imperial throne.) Similarly, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, eldest son of Alfonso XIII of Spain, gave up his rights to succeed to the Spanish throne to marry a commoner (whom he divorced, to marry another commoner, whom he also divorced the following year). George III, to give another example, was so incensed at his brothers’ marriages to commoners - Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, married the illegitimately born granddaughter of Robert Walpole, while Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland, wed the previously married Anne Horton - that he proposed and saw passed the Royal Marriages Act of 1772, which forced any descendant of George II (save the children of princesses who had married or might thereafter marry ‘into foreign families’) to receive the consent of the monarch, or else see his or her marriage declared null and void (which did not stop the Prince of Wales from marrying the Catholic commoner Maria Fizherbert in 1785, or George’s sixth son Augustus from marrying Lady Augusta Murray in 1793). On the other side, however, a little more than a century before James, Duke of York, had married in exile Anne Hyde, a maid of honor to James’ sister, Mary, Princess of Orange. Anne was a commoner, and their first child was born only two months after the marriage (a large reason why the marriage had happened in the first place), but two of their children came to sit the English throne, and had any of her daughter Anne’s 17 pregnancies resulted in children who lived past childhood, perhaps today it would be Anne Hyde’s descendants who rule the British Isles.\n\nOccasionally, royalty would keep these non-dynastic marriages secret. Sometimes this would take the form of kings marrying their mistresses or favorites. Louis XIV, for example, married the Marquise de Maintenon, the former royal governess to whom he was much attached, several months after the death of his queen, Maria Theresa of Spain, though she was not openly acknowledged as the king’s wife. Nor was such a process limited only to kings. After being separated from Napoleon, his empress, Marie Louise of Austria, was given the Duchy of Parma for her lifetime and a dashing soldier called Albert von Neipperg for her chamberlain, to ensure that she did not seek out her imperial spouse. Far from it: Marie Louise fell passionately for von Neipperg, and they two promptly became lovers, with their first two children born while Napoleon was in exile on St. Helena, and though Marie Louise eventually married von Neipperg, the union was kept so quiet that her son by Napoleon, the Duke of Reichstadt, claimed he did not learn about it until von Neipperg’s death in 1829.\n\nNow, even where a marriage is contracted between a royal and someone of lesser or unequal rank, a ruling power can grant courtesy titles to the dynastically lower spouses. So, for example, when Prince Nicholas of Nassau (brother of Sophia, Queen of Sweden as wife to Oscar II) married the commoner Natalia Pushkina - a daughter of the famous poet Pushkin - the Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont granted Natalia the title “Countess von Merenberg” (unrelated fact: that Prince of Waldeck was the great-great-great grandfather of the current King of the Netherlands). When Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, youngest son of Alexander II of Russia, married his lover, the divorced commoner Olga von Pistohlkors, he was stripped of his status as Grand Duke and banished from Russia; but in 1912, Nicholas II pardoned his wayward uncle, and in 1915 granted Olga and the children of their union the style of Prince/Princess Paley. Similarly, after his own brother Michael wed the twice-divorced commoner Natalia Wulfert, Nicholas II agreed to legitimize her son by the Grand Duke (without any succession rights) and to grand her the courtesy title of “Countess Brasova”, after Michael’s estate.\n\nOf course, even if a royal marries morganatically, that does not necessarily bar that royal’s children from ever moving on to better things, dynastically speaking. A prime example of this, for me, are the Battenbergs. The Battenberg family began when Prince Alexander of Hesse und bei Rhine (one of the many petty German states that would eventually form the German Empire in 1870) married Countess Julia von Hauke. Now, Julia’s credentials were not terrible: her father, a German soldier in the employ of Russian Poland, had been made a count by Tsar Nicholas I, and when he was killed in the November Uprising, Julia was made the tsar’s ward, and eventually became lady-in-waiting to Nicholas’ eldest son’s wife, Marie Alexandrovna. It was in this role that she met and fell in love with Marie’s brother, Prince Alexander, and - against the tsar’s wishes - the lovers left St. Petersburg and married in 1851. Because there was such a disparity of rank, the children of their union were barred from succession to the grand ducal seat of Hesse und bei Rhine, though Alexander’s brother Louis eventually bestowed the title “Princess of Battenberg” on Julia. Still, despite their morganatic heritage, their children and descendants managed to do well. Eldest son Louis married his Hessian first cousin once removed, Victoria; their daughter Victoria became Queen of Sweden as wife to Gustav VI, and their daughter Alice (having married Prince Andrew, fourth son of King George I of Greece) was the mother of the current Duke of Edinburgh (interestingly, George, the elder son, married Nadejda Mikhailovna de Torby - a product of the morganatic marriage of Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich and Sophie von Merenberg, a daughter of the above-mentioned Natalia). Second son Alexander was elected the sovereign Prince of Bulgaria with the support of his uncle, Alexander II of Russia (though that fared rather poorly). Third son Henry married Queen Victoria’s youngest daughter, Beatrice; their daughter Victoria Eugenie became Queen of Spain as wife to Alfonso XIII (though with the unfortunate genetic baggage of hemophilia). Today, the Mountbattens (the Anglicized version of “Battenberg”) are still a family in the English peerage (though they lost their princely style after World War I, when George V severed the royal family’s ties to its German titles). I would also be remiss not to point out that Queen Elizabeth II’s paternal grandmother was born Mary of Teck, the daughter of Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge and Francis, Duke of Teck - the son of the morganatic marriage of Duke Alexander of Wurttemberg and a Hungarian countess, Claudine Rhédey de Kis-Rhéde. Additionally - though it means nothing practically - the only male line left of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (which produced, among others, the wife of George III of Great Britain and mother of Wilhelm I, German Emperor) is the product of a morganatic line.\n\nNowadays, of course, those countries still clinging to their old monarchies have largely given up on trying to keep the bloodlines pure. The Queen of Spain was a journalist before her marriage, the crown prince of Sweden was the crown princess’ personal trainer before they wed, and when she became engaged to the crown prince of Norway, the current crown princess was a single mother and former waitress."
