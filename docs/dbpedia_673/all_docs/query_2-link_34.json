        "text": "IOTL Catherine of Sweden (1584-1638) married John Casimir of Palatinate-Kleeburg, and after the death of her half-brother and abdication of her niece their son would become king of Sweden as Charles X. The marriage had been arranged by Catherine's stepmother, probably after John came to Stockholm as a representative for the Protestant Union, however the choice to arrange a marriage with John Casimir had always been an odd one and already met some opposing voices at the time.\n\nAs it was John Casimir was only a minor and relatively poor German prince with very little land of his own hardly worthy of a royal match, not to mention the marriage did little (if anything) to advance Swedish interests.\n\nHowever another potential suitor could have been Adolph Frederick I of Mecklenburg. He was about the same age as John Casimir (they were only a few months apart), and also still unmarried. Now admittedly Mecklenburg wasn't a major player in Germany either, however it had plenty more going for it than Kleeburg. It was much larger, it was strategically located right across the Baltic Sea just south of the Danish Belts, the region was an important grain exporter to Sweden, etc. Furthermore the dukes also had close family relations, as they were the nephew of Catherine's stepmother. And dukes of Mecklenburg had regularly married into Scandinavian royalty before. For good measure let's just say Mecklenburg decides to join the Protestant Union as well ITTL.\n\nAssuming Catherine's children still inherit the Swedish throne, how will it affect the Swedish Empire specifically and the Baltic region in general?​\n\nView attachment 865410\n\nWell it establish a much stronger Swedish presence in North Germany, it pretty much establish an earlier Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and de facto attempt to vassalize the other Güstrow. I also suspect that with the Swedish army backing him, the king-duke will enforce absolutism on Mecklenburg-Schwerin which will make it a much stronger state.\n\nGüstow will either accept their Swedish overlord or try to do like Gottorp in Schleswig-Holstein and try to ally with foreign power against Sweden and Schwerin, the three natural powers here would be Denmark-Norway, Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Brandenburg-Prussia.\n\nForeign policy wise, gaining Mecklenburg-Schwerin will make Sweden much more dangerous in the minds of Denmark-Norway, so I expect Frederik III will be much more careful declaring war against Sweden in 1657. Instead Denmark will try building a anti-Swedish alliance network.\n\nSweden will certainly have much more influence in the HRE than in OTL, in particular considering how much it had anyway after the Peace of Westphalia. Those most alarmed by this Swedish increase, in addition to Denmark, will obviously be Brandenburg ( which I see remaining a vassal of Stockholm to a much greater extent ) and then Saxony, naturally in this group of governments I also include the Habsburgs for obvious reasons ( who OTL sought a correspondence with Denmark, I don't see why they don't try again in ATL too, perhaps with greater results ) the PLC should also not be excluded in this anti-Swedish alliance, especially if the Polish Vasa were to manage to survive\n\nForeign policy wise, gaining Mecklenburg-Schwerin will make Sweden much more dangerous in the minds of Denmark-Norway, so I expect Frederik III will be much more careful declaring war against Sweden in 1657.

While Mecklenburg doesn't make Sweden much powerful in absolute terms compared to otl it will definitely be perceived as more of a threat.\n\nGüstow will either accept their Swedish overlord or try to do like Gottorp in Schleswig-Holstein and try to ally with foreign power against Sweden and Schwerin, the three natural powers here would be Denmark-Norway, Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Brandenburg-Prussia.\n\nThis I hadn't thought of yet, so I did some extra reading and there actually were some tensions between the two, at least around the mid-17th century. So there's definitely a chance for Gustow to become a diplomatic thorn in the side of the Swedes.\n\nThis was one of the first things that came to mind for me as well, the Dutch and the English will also be monitoring the situation closely as both of them didn't want any of the regional powers to become dominant in the Baltic.

So there's definitely a chance for Gustow to become a diplomatic thorn in the side of the Swedes.\n\nfurthermore we must consider how an ATL Gustavo Adolfo with HRE holdings already in his possession could change the cards on the table in a similar 30YW, he will certainly be aware of politics and imperial laws, therefore he would not commit the diplomatic horrors of Otl in interacting with his German counterparts, finally he might be more willing to come to terms with Vienna if the situation allows it and he can also gain a personal advantage from it, so it is not unlikely that we will see a more solid and stronger Sweden within the Reich and in able to exploit the existing institutions, without turning everything upside down like Otl, so it could very well happen that depending on the situation on the ground, the imperial emissaries are sent to negotiate with their counterparts, to find an agreement that satisfies both parties equally , perhaps even going so far as to put aside the defense of minor princes in exchange for discrete territorial gains ( same technique used by Otl with Saxony ), certainly we need to understand what Vienna would be willing to cede or concede to Stockholm, but I don't see many reasons for conflict in ATL, also because I doubt that a king who has gained experience in HRE politics would try to declare himself emperor knowing that it would unconstitutional ( although intended to be so for the Protestants ) compared to what happened historically, therefore I think it is possible to see a possible treaty, which sees the minor princes of the empire thrown under a tram in favor of the search for peace, and which at the same time favors Sweden, the Habsburgs and also the Electorates and find a solution to the problem of the mandate recognition of the Calvinists in the Peace of Augsburg of 1555"
