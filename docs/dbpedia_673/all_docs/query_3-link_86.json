        "text": "Duchess Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (10 August 1869 – 3 September 1955) was a daughter of Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg by his third wife Princess Marie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.[1] By her marriage to Frederick Augustus II, she became the consort of the last reigning Grand Duke of Oldenburg.\n\nContents\n\n1 Family\n\n2 Marriage\n\n3 Titles and styles\n\n4 Ancestry\n\n5 References\n\nFamily\n\nElisabeth was related to many of Europe's royal families. She was the eldest child of Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg by his third wife Princess Marie of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. She was an older sister of Hendrik, Prince consort of the Netherlands, husband of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, making her an aunt of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. She was also a younger half-sister of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg. Through Frederick Francis, she was an aunt of Alexandrine, Queen of Denmark and Cecilie, the last Crown Princess of Germany. Elisabeth was also a half sister of Marie, Grand Duchess of Russia, who was the mother of Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia, the pretender to the Russian throne.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were Paul Frederick, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg and Princess Alexandrine of Prussia. Her maternal grandparents were Prince Adolph of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Princess Mathilde of Schonburg-Waldenburg.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn 24 October 1896, Elisabeth married Frederick Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg.[1] His first wife Elisabeth Anna had died the previous year, leaving only one surviving daughter: Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg. Frederick Augustus was thus in need of a male heir. He succeeded as Grand Duke of Oldenburg in 1900, making Elisabeth Grand Duchess consort of Oldenburg.\n\nThey had four children:\n\nName Birth Death Notes Nicolas Frederick William, Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg 10 August 1897 3 April 1970 married Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont Duchess Alexandrine 25 March 1900 26 March 1900 Duchess Ingeborg Alix 1901 1996 married Prince Stephan Alexander Victor of Schaumburg-Lippe Duchess Altburg Marie Mathilde Olga 1903 2001 married Josias, Hereditary Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont\n\nFrederick was forced to abdicate his throne at the end of World War I, when the former Grand Duchy of the German Empire joined the post-war German Republic.[2] He and his family took up residence at Rastede Castle, where he took up farming and local industrial interests.[3] A year after his abdication, he asked the Oldenburg Diet for a yearly allowance of 150,000 marks, stating that his financial condition was \"extremely precarious\".[3]\n\nIn 1931, Frederick died in Rastede. Elisabeth died on 3 September 1955, having been widowed for 24 years.[2]\n\nTitles and styles\n\n10 August 1869 – 24 October 1896: Her Highness Duchess Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\n24 October 1896 – 13 June 1900: Her Royal Highness The Hereditary Grand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\n13 June 1900 – 24 February 1931: Her Royal Highness The Grand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\n24 February 1931 – 3 September 1955: Her Royal Highness The Dowager Grand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\nAncestry\n\nReferences\n\nDuchess Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nCadet branch of the House of Mecklenburg\n\nBorn: 29 September 1882 Died: 30 August 1963 German royalty Vacant\n\nTitle last held by\n\nPrincess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg Grand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\n13 June 1900 – 11 November 1918 Monarchy abolished\n\nGerman revolution\n\nTitles in pretence Loss of title\n\nMonarchy abolished\n\n— TITULAR —\n\nGrand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\n11 November 1918 – 24 February 1931\n\nReason for succession failure:\n\nGrand Duchy abolished in 1918 Succeeded by\n\nPrincess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont"
