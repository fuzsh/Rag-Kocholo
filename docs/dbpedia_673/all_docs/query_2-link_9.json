        "text": "The modern state of Mecklenburg–West Pomerania is coterminous with the historic region of Mecklenburg and the western parts of Pomerania. Germanic tribes had settled in the region by the year 500, though these people were displaced by Slavs before Germans resettled the area as part of a more general movement of Germans toward the east. In Mecklenburg a dynasty was established in 1160 following a successful Saxon effort to Christianize and Germanize the region’s population. The region’s dukes became princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1348, following which the region was dominated for centuries by duchies with shifting territorial configurations. In Pomerania Germanization proceeded as well, although Polish dukes ruled until 1637, after which much of Pomerania came under the rule of Brandenburg and Prussia. Many cities in Mecklenburg and Pomerania flourished during the Middle Ages in association with trade within the Hanseatic League. From about 1700 until 1934 Mecklenburg was ruled as two duchies, Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, until a state of Mecklenburg was formed of the two under the Nazi regime. The Swedes held Wismar and territory around it from 1648 to 1803, as well as parts of western Pomerania from 1648 until 1815, before the territories became part of Prussia. Most of Pomerania went to Poland after World War II, but Western Pomerania, along with Mecklenburg, became part of Soviet-occupied Germany and then part of Soviet-dominated East Germany. The contemporary state was re-created just before the unification of East and West Germany in 1990 from the East German Bezirke (districts) of Rostock, Schwerin, and Neubrandenburg.\n\nWilliam H. Berentsen"
