        "text": "This article is designated as vetted, meaning that it is up-to-date and accurate. Please ask before making changes.\n\nThe German Empire is a federal parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy established in 1871 after the Prussian-dominated North German Confederation's victory in the Franco-Prussian War. The Empire encompasses only the geographical term of \"Lesser Germany\", as Austria and Bohemia were not included after the Austro-Prussian War.\n\nIt is made up of 27 constituent states (Bundesstaaten), consisting of 4 Kingdoms, 8 Grand Duchies, 5 Duchies, 7 Principalities, 3 Free and Hanseatic Cities.\n\nKingdoms[]\n\nPrussia[]\n\nThe four German kingdoms are by far the most influential of the German states, above all of course the unifier of Germany, the Kingdom of Prussia, whose monarch, Wilhelm II, is simultaneously German Emperor. Encompassing more than 50% of the Empire's total area (mostly because of far-reaching annexations after the Napoleonic and Austro-Prussian wars), Prussia is seen abroad almost as a synonym for Germany as a whole, with traditional Prussian values such as discipline, efficiency, punctuality and austerity being world-famous. The Prussian is often perceived as arrogant, out of touch with reality and self-opinionated by other Germans, who do not like Prussia's encroachment into their own affairs.\n\nStretching from the Vesdre in the west to the Memel in the east, from the agrarian Geest of Schleswig to the mountains of the Swabian Jura in Sigmaringen, from the East Frisian Wadden Sea to the forested hills of Silesia and from the bustling metropolises on the Rhine to the Old Prussian manors in sparsely populated Masuria, West Prussia and Further Pomerania, the Kingdom is home to more than 40 million people of many different religions and ethnicities. Prussia's and Germany's capital, Berlin, is with almost five million inhabitants one of the most populous cities on the planet and the leading financial, cultural and political center of Europe. Visitors of Berlin will encounter well-known sights such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Royal Residence of the Imperial family, the Victory Avenue and the Victory Column, world-renowned museums and of course the Reichstag building, where political questions on Germany's and the world's future are discussed.\n\nBavaria[]\n\nVery different from the stoic Prussian is the sociable Bavarian, who is more close to his catholic brethren in Austria and native to the rich lands of Southeastern Germany. The Kingdom of Bavaria was originally established as a French tributary during the Napoleonic Wars, leading to the enlargement of the Duchy of Bavaria with territories in Franconia, Swabia and the Palatinate. Only through clever politicking and because of changing sides in the last minute, Bavaria managed to retain her sovereignty at the 1815 Vienna Congress, something that would greatly influence Bavarian national pride and would dominate Bavarian politics for the next decades. However, in 1866 Bavaria would lose said sovereignty after her defeat in the Austro-Prussian War, being bound by treaty to Prussia in the aftermath. The following decades would not be any better, with a 30 year-long regency crisis hitting the Kingdom in 1886 which would shatter the population's trust in the monarchy for many years to come.\n\nHowever, now, Bavaria seems to have left her troubles of the past behind and steers into a brighter future; The ascension of war hero Rupprecht of Bavaria to the throne in 1921 has restored the people's faith in their monarchy and the economic boom of the 20s also captured the relatively rural Bavaria. The picturesque capital of Munich is on its best way to become Central Europe's top hotspot for artists again and beautiful castles, lakes and mountains as well as the annually-held Oktoberfest lure hundreds of thousands of tourists into the Kingdom every year. Bavarian patriotism is slowly recovering from many decades of disgrace and Prussian supression and Bavarian particularism, manifestated in the Bayerische Volkspartei, becomes more and more present in German politics.\n\nWürttemberg[]\n\nThe other Southern German Kingdom in the Empire is the Swabian Kingdom of Württemberg. Simlarly to Bavaria, Württemberg, who was also formerly Napoleon-alligned, retained her territorial integrity and sovereignty in 1815, only to lose it in 1866 as well. Württemberg is known as a land with few resources, but with well-established industry: The kingdom is renowned for high-quality handcrafted goods, like watches, toys and tools and the typical Württemberger is perceived as the archetypical petty bourgeois, economical middle class citizen. Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance is internationally known for its aircraft production due to the local Dornier-Metallbauten GmbH and Zeppelin GmbH.\n\nSince 1921, Albrecht von Württemberg, a respected war hero like Rupprecht, rules the small Kingdom. His ascension to the throne led to the extinction of the Protestant line of the House of Württemberg and now Württemberg is ruled by Catholics, despite the majority of the country being Lutheran. The King resides most of the year in various castles in and around Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg, but also owns summer residences in the Swabian Jura and on Lake Constance.\n\nSaxony[]\n\nNot as lucky as Bavaria or Württemberg was the Kingdom of Saxony. After losing half of its territory to Prussia in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars and being almost made into a Prussian vassal state in 1866, the predominantly Protestant state in Central Germany is seen by outsiders as nothing more than \"Prussia's little brother\". The royal family, now headed by Georg II after an almost 30 year-long rule by his immensely popular predecessor Friedrich August II, is closely aligned to the Hohenzollerns.\n\nSaxony is by far the most industrialized state in Germany and a hotbed of socialist agitation, which is why cynics tend to call it the \"Red Kingdom\". The illustrous capital of Dresden, the \"Florence on the Elbe\", is listed as one of Europe's most beautiful cities, with famous sights such as the Church of Our Lady, the opera house and the Zwinger Palace.\n\nState\n\nRuler Capital Portrait Flag Coat of Arms Kingdom of Prussia Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern (*1859) Berlin Kingdom of Bavaria Rupprecht von Wittelsbach (*1869) Munich Kingdom of Württemberg Albrecht von Württemberg (*1865) Stuttgart Kingdom of Saxony Georg II von Wettin (*1893) Dresden\n\nGrand Duchies[]\n\nThe seven Grand Duchies within the German Empire are smaller than the Kingdoms and wield less influence on internal affairs.\n\nBaden[]\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Baden, located in Southwestern Germany, is arguably the most important of them and seen by some as equally powerful as the Kingdoms of Saxony and Württemberg. Formerly known as a hotbed of German liberalism and the birthplace of the 1848 March Revolution and German constitutionalism, Baden is now dominated by catholic conservative politicians of the Zentrumspartei. However, due to the University of Heidelberg, the oldest university in Germany and one of the best in the world, the Grand Duchy remains a popular spot for open-minded thinkers. Famous graduates include businessman Gustav Krupp, anarchist Gustav Landauer, sociologist Max Weber, ruling Grand Duke of Baden Berthold I and Russian politician Boris Savinkov.\n\nHesse[]\n\nIn Central Germany, the Grand Duchy of Hesse can be found, situated in the beautiful highlands east of the River Rhine. The British-raised Duke, Ernst Ludwig, has ruled over the Grand Duchy for the last 44 years and is a sophisticated patron of modern architecture, most prominently Art Nouveau. One of his rule's mottos is \"Mein Hessenland blühe und in ihm die Kunst\" (“My Hesse should flourish, and the art in Hesse too”): Under his stewardship, the Darmstadt Artists' Colony in the Duchy's capital has evolved into a safe haven for international artists, despite Germany's otherwise relatively conservative stance on art and architecture.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine[]\n\nFormerly a territory ceded by France in 1871, the Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine was first administered by the central government, growing later into a republic of restricted autonomy only, with an elected state parliament of its own since 1911.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine was formerly the eternal \"bone of contention\" within the German Empire before the WeltKrieg, as no one was really satisfied with the current state of this so-called former \"Reichsland\". In Alsace-Lorraine\n\nFrictions between the native population and the Prussian administration have led to various conflicts in the past: In the late 19th century, few German-speaking Alsatians identified as true Germans due to Bismarck's anti-Catholic agenda and even in the 20th century, when less and less people who had witnessed life under French rule were still alive, distrust of the German government remained common, especially after the disastrous 1913 Zabern Affair, which would strain the relationship between Alsace-Lorraine and the remainder of the German Empire for years to come. Further deterioration arrived during the Weltkrieg, when the French language in the Reichsland was completely suppressed, which only strengthened patriotism among the small French community. These harsh restrictions were repealed with the end of the Ludendorff Dictatorship, however.\n\nAs part of the March reforms, The Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine was abolished and reformed into a proper German constituent state. The Imperial Office for Alsace Lorraine, which previously was responsible for the administration of the territory, is abolished and an independent civil administration is set up in Straßburg. Similarly, the position of Imperial Governor (the permanent representative of the Kaiser in Straßburg) is abolished and the first monarch of the newly-created Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine, the Wittelsbach prince Franz of Bavaria, the third son of King Ludwig III, is welcomed by the Alsatian-Lorrainian Landtag.\n\nOn the Alsatian Constitution Day of 1920 - a regional holiday since the end of the war, commemorating the introduction of the Alsatian Constitution in 1911 – a swearing-in ceremony is held for the newly-arrived in front of the Landtag. Later, after a solemn mass at Straßburg Cathedral, the new sovereign would move into his family's new living quarters at Palais Rohan, with a good view over both the Castle Square and the Rhine.\n\nAlsace-Lorraine is one of the most beautiful states of the Empire. The Rhine and Moselle wind through green valleys, forested hills and picturesque valleys. Alsace-Lorraine is particularly famous for its wine, which is considered to be the best in all of the Empire; Alsatian wine villages like Reichenweier, Andlau or Kaysersberg are highly-regarded among sophisticated wine connoisseurs. The most important major cities of the grand duchy are Straßburg, Mülhausen and Metz.\n\nStraßburg, once almost completely destroyed during the Franco-Prussian War, was rebuilt soon after and now is a major site of Wilhelmine architecture in Germany; Important examples include the Kaiserpalast, the new train station, the synagogue and the famous Kaiser-Wilhelm-Universität, one of the most elite universities in Europe. The old city centre of Straßburg is famous for its half-timbered houses and Strasbourg Cathedral, the fourth-highest church in Germany and the fifth-highest in all of the world. Mülhausen, the \"city with a hundred chimneys\", is particularly known as a major industrial centre near the Swiss border, while Metz is the most important fortress town on the German-French border: The city's fortification system is the largest in the world, considered to be impenetrable and directly connected to Berlin via the so-called Kanonenbahn (\"Cannons Railway\").\n\nThe two most important industry branches of Alsace-Lorraine are coal mining and steel production; prior to the Weltkrieg, German Lorraine was one of the largest iron and coal mining areas in the world, and after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, it was even further enlarged with the annexation of the Longwy-Briey iron ore basin. Another annexation that came with the treaty was the city of Belfort in the Southern Vosges - not because of rich ore reserves, however, but due to the fact that the city is an important fortress between Jura Mountains and Vosges and always had been a symbol of French resistance, as the city's garrison had held out against the German siege for the entire duration of the Franco-Prussian War. Therefore, the annexation of Belfort mainly had the goal to further humiliate the defeated French and secure the Southern border of Alsace against future French aggression.\n\nLuxemburg[]\n\nThe newest addition to the German Empire is the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. United at last with the German fatherland after a referendum following the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the Grand Duchy, now enlarged with the formerly Belgian city of Arlon, is ruled by the only female monarch of the Empire, the popular Marie Adelheid, a common sight in German tabloid magazines. Luxemburg is highly industrialized and the seat of various German heavy industry firms, like Deutsch-Luxemburgische Bergwerks und Hütten-AG under the management of Albert Vögler or Vereinigte Stahlhütten Burbach-Eich-Düdelingen (ARBED), which make use of the Grand Duchy's rich ore deposits. Social Democracy is therefore very popular in Luxembourg.\n\nMecklenburg Schwerin & Mecklenburg Strelitz[]\n\nThe two Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg (Schwerin & Strelitz) can be found on the coast of the Baltic Sea in Northern Germany and are ruled in a personal union by Friedrich Franz IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin since the suicide of the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1918. Mecklenburg is closely aligned to Prussia and comparatively rural and backwards. While major cities like Rostock or Wismar are slowly evolving into important hubs for shipbuilding, railroad and plane construction, the true growth potential of Mecklenburg lies in the emerging tourism industry, as seaside resorts such as Warnemünde, Boltenhagen and Kühlungsborn draw in more and more visitors every year.\n\nOldenburg[]\n\nThe other important maritime Grand Duchy of the Empire is the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg on the North Sea Coast. This German State may be not very thrilling for foreigners, as it mostly consists of rural livestock pastures, marshland and sleepy villages, but the ruling family, the von Holstein-Gottorp dynasty, which is closely related to the Russian Romanovs, has often been a topic on German newspaper title pages in the past. Former Grand Duke of Oldenburg, Friedrich August, was a staunch wilhelminist, inventor of naval technology, German admiral and even a movie star in various propaganda films during the Ludendorff Dictatorship. He was known as a strong supporter of the DVLP and his divorce back in 1913 caused a diplomatic crisis which strained relations with Hesse, Mecklenburg and the Netherlands. His son Nikolaus, who rules since 1931, is rather inconspicuous in comparison; However, rumors say he is even further rightist than his father, which doesn't shed a good light on the small Grand Duchy.\n\nSaxe-Weimar-Eisenach[]\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach is the biggest of the Thuringian States, a cluster of eight minor fiefdoms which many see as nothing more than a remnant of the past. Complicated borders and administration procedures make the people call for reforms, but as long as the monarchist system in Germany endures, as long will the borders of old remain. Ruling Grand Duke is the young Karl August II, who succeeded his father, once the most unpopular prince of the Empire, in 1923. He still remains unmarried and the people of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach eagerly await who their future Grand Duchess may be.\n\nSaxe-Weimar-Eisenach has become an important centre for the German right-wing völkisch movement in the last years, mainly because of its historical importance as a centre of the German Reformation and German Classicism, with rightists such as Adolf Bartels being very influential in local governance.\n\nState\n\nRuler Capital Portrait Flag Coat of Arms Grand Duchy of Baden Berthold von Baden (*1906) Karlsruhe Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine Franz von Bayern (*1875) Straßburg Grand Duchy of Hesse Ernst Ludwig von Hessen-Darmstadt (*1868) Darmstadt Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Marie Adelheid von Nassau-Weilburg (*1894) Luxemburg Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Friedrich Franz IV von Mecklenburg-Schwerin (*1882) Schwerin Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz Neustrelitz Grand Duchy of Oldenburg Nikolaus von Holstein-Gottorp (*1897) Oldenburg Grand Duchy of Saxony (Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach until 1903) Karl August II von Wettin (*1912) Weimar\n\nDuchies[]\n\nThe Empire's five Duchies are on paper higher in the hierachy than the lower-ranking Principalities, but this hierarchy is based on centuries old treaties and glory of the past; Size-wise, they are not really that different from their smaller counterparts, and economic-wise even less so. Several of the Duchies suffer, similar to the Principalities, from structural weakness and many of their citizens migrate into the larger cities.\n\nAnhalt[]\n\nThe Duchy of Anhalt, almost entirely surrounded by Prussia, is an often forgotten piece of land in Central Germany, famous for virtually nothing except its prestigious history which includes beloved figures such as Albert the Bear, medieval ruler of Brandenburg, Anhalt and Saxony, who is celebrated by German nationalists as the man who established German dominance in Slavic-dominated territories for the first time, and Leopold I \"the old Dessauer\", brave field marshal of Prussian King Friedrich II in the 18th century. Nowadays however, the glorious past is long gone and Anhalt faces structural weakness and rural exodus. The only hope of Anhalt is its young and liberal duke Joachim Ernst of Ascania and his progressive government that aim to finally fix the chronic problems of the troubled duchy.\n\nBrunswick[]\n\nThe rural Duchy of Brunswick, like Anhalt located in Northern Central Germany, is the last bastion of the Lower Saxon spirit, as it remains the only state within the Empire which is still ruled by the House of Welf, the oldest noble family in Europe. Frictions with Berlin due to the Prussian annexation of the Welf Kingdom of Hannover by Prussia in 1866 and a decades-long regency crisis dominated the small Duchy for years, but since 1913, when Prussia and Brunswick reconciled after the marriage of Ernst August & Viktoria Luise, things are beginning to look brighter again. The Ducal couple is the most popular royal family of the Empire, beloved by European media, and the Brunswickian economy profits from the German economic boom due to the well-established industry and mining sector.\n\nSaxe-Altenburg[]\n\nThe small Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg is one of the various Thuringian states and probably one of the most idyllic states of the Empire. Duke Ernst II, a very down-to-earth ruler who shows great interest in technology, polar exploration and aviation, is a celebrated war hero and one of the Empire's most popular princes. Everyone, from the small farmer to the rich industrialist, can visit and talk to their Duke during audience time at Altenburg Castle. The city of Altenburg is world famous for the production of playing cards and the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg is considered to be one of the most liberal states within the Empire - especially in comparison to nearby Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nSaxe-Coburg and Gotha[]\n\nThe Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is located in Thuringia as well and primarily known for its ruling dynasty, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the most widespread dynasty in Europe; King George V, King Albert of Belgium, Tsar Ferdinand I of Bulgaria and former King Manuel II of Portugal are all members of this honorable family. Head of the dynasty however is the Duke of the Duchy with the same name, Carl Eduard. While British by birth, he is known as a staunch German nationalist with autocratic tendencies, who despises constitutionalism and democracy. Gotha is famous for the Gothaer Waggonfabrik (GWF), one of Germany's leading aircraft manufacturers. Financially supported by the Duke himself during the Weltkrieg, GWF produced the first German heavy bombers, called \"the Gothas\"; After multiple attacks on London, the Brits would strip Duke Carl Eduard of all of his honors and rename the British line of the dynasty into \"House of Windsor\".\n\nSaxe-Meiningen[]\n\nThe fourth and remaining Thuringian state ruled by a branch of the Wettin Dynasty is the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. Known as one of the most liberal states within the Empire, Saxe-Meinigen's open-minded spirit was disrupted by the 24 year long rule of Duke Bernhard II, a pro-Prussian conservative with great fascination for the military. Bernhard would eventually die in 1928 and be succeded by his brother Ernst, the \"Duke who never wanted to be Duke\". Ernst lives very secluded and mainly engages in painting, which is the source of his famous nickname \"Malerherzog\" (Painting Duke). His works are highly renowned and have their own exhibition at the Lindenau Art Museum in Meiningen. Meiningen is also known as one of Europe's most influential theatre locations, but the golden age of the Meiningen theatre lies already a few decades in the past.\n\nState\n\nRuler Capital Portrait Flag Coat of Arms Duchy of Anhalt Joachim Ernst von Askanien (*1901) Dessau Duchy of Brunswick Ernst August von Hannover (*1887) Braunschweig Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg Ernst II von Wettin (*1871) Altenburg Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Carl Eduard von Wettin (*1884) Coburg Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen Ernst von Wettin (*1859) Meiningen\n\nPrincipalities[]\n\nThe German Principalities have by far the lowest influence within the Empire and are, in some cases, smaller than the capital city of Berlin. Remnants of weird salic inheritation law from centuries ago, the Principalities have their highest density in Central Germany. Especially progressive elements in the Empire defame the Principalities, as well as the Duchies, as ancient \"Kleinstaaterei\" (small-state-ery) and would love to get rid of them in favour of a more efficient federal system - something that is of course no real option, as long as the old Bismarckian constitution remains in place.\n\nLippe[]\n\nThe Principality of Lippe is located in the fertile lands of Westphalia and looks back upon a very rich history: The House of Lippe, named after a local river, has ruled the area since the 12th century, therefore, the term \"Lippe\" has become a synonym for the region as a whole (\"Lipperland\"). Prince Leopold IV is known as a even-tempered and capable ruler and his dynasty is relatively inconspicuous when it comes to scandals and presence in gossip magazines, but in recent weeks, the family has come into the limelight when journalists revealed that Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, nephew of the ruling Prince, was seen courting Crown Princess Juliana of the Netherlands - whether that is correct is yet to be confirmed by the Dutch royal family. Lippe is famous for its idyllic landscapes which include the mythical Teutoburg Forest, the site of a major Roman defeat in the year 9 AD by Saxon tribes. To commemorate this grand \"German\" victory over the foreign invaders, a huge monument, the \"Hermannsdenkmal\", was inaugurated near the capital of Detmold in 1875.\n\nReuss Gera & Reuss Greiz[]\n\nThe two Principalities of Reuss (Gera & Greiz) are located in Thuringia; However, much different to most neighboring Thuringian states, Reuss is not ruled by a branch of the House of Wettin, but by the House of Reuss, an ancient dynasty with roots in the 11th century. An old house law of the dynasty stipulates that all male family members have to be named Heinrich, the German form of \"Henry\": Therefore, the current Prince of Reuss, Heinrich XLV, is already the 45th Heinrich to rule the Reussian lands. Nominally the Prince of Reuss-Gera, he also rules the Principality of Reuss-Greiz in a personal union. The ruling Prince is a known theatre & cinema enthusiast, hobby director & dramaturge and personally funds the Princely Reussian State Theatre in Gera, one of the most widely renowned German theatres during the Golden 1920s, gaining him the nickname \"Theaterprinz\" (Theatre Prince). Apart from their illustrious regent, the two principalities are also known as the centre of German textile industry and as a hotspot of Thuringian social democracy.\n\nSchaumburg-Lippe[]\n\nThe Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe in the Lower Saxon-Westphalian borderland is ruled by a side branch of the House of Lippe, Lippe-Alverdissen, since the 1600s. Sizewise, it is one of the smallest constituent states of the Empire; Even the capital, Bückeburg, is home to no more than 10,000 inhabitants. The currently reigning Prince, Adolf II, has successfully capitalized on the tininess of his domain, however, and extensively funded the consolidation of Schaumburg-Lippe as one of the leading recreational holiday spots in Europe: Under bis guidance, the small village of Bad Eilsen has evolved into a major spa location for the global elite and is known as the \"spa of princes & kings\". At Hotel Fürstenhof (\"Hotel Princely Court\"), famous figures such as King Manuel II of Portugal, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands or Austrian tenor Richard Tauber have stayed in the past, much to the delight of the local media.\n\nSchwarzburg Rudolstadt & Schwarzburg Sondershausen[]\n\nThe two Principalities of Schwarzburg (Rudolstadt & Sondershausen) are located in Thuringia, but, similar to Reuss, are not ruled by the Wettins, but by the House of Schwarzburg, a dynasty of Old Thuringian ancestry. The current Prince, Friedrich Günther, who rules both Schwarzburgian Principalities in a personal union, is in a precarious situation: As the last remaining male member of his dynasty, succession is currently at stake, and with no heir apparent & marriage in sight, the future of the two Principalities still remains unclear. Surrounded by scenic gentle hills and mixed woodland, Schwarzburg is known as the \"Pearl of Thuringia\" and a popular location for hiking and hunting and high above the town of Bad Frankenhausen, the migthy Kyffhäuserdenkmal (\"Kyffhäuser Monument\") with its giant Friedrich Barbarossa statue watches over the people of Schwarzburg; Opened in 1895, the monument is a homage to the Barbarossa Legend, which says that the old German Emperor is sleeping in a cave underneath the monument and will awake in Germany's darkest hour \"to restore it to its ancient greatness\" - the exact meaning of this can be interpreted in many different ways.\n\nWaldeck and Pyrmont[]\n\nThe Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont belongs to the geographic region of Hesse and has been ruled by old Prince Friedrich von Waldeck for the last 43 years; As a stoic, almost boring ruler with a strong Prussian militaristic attitude, Friedrich embodies \"mediocrity\" probably like no other ruler in the Empire. Much different however is his son, Hereditary Prince Josias: A veteran of the Weltkrieg, Josias fought for the whole duration of the war, even taking a bullet graze to the head. After the end of the war, he enrolled in the German colonial forces and nowadays serves as a distinguished army leader in German-occupied British Malaya, much to the interest of the German public, but to the dislike of his family, who fears for the health of their heir apparent.\n\nA major problem for Waldeck-Pyrmont is its obscure geographical situation: Pyrmont lays about 100 kilometres to the north of Waldeck and has no real cultural ties to Waldeck, the Princely family only comes to visit once a year and many Pyrmontians would prefer to join nearby Prussia instead; As one of the best examples of German small-state-ery, the future of Waldeck-Pyrmont will most likely remain the topic of progressive federal reform debates for quite some time.\n\nState\n\nRuler Capital Portrait Flag Coat of Arms Principality of Lippe Leopold IV zur Lippe (*1871) Detmold Principality of Reuss-Gera (Junior Line) Heinrich XLV von Reuss (*1895) Gera Principality of Reuss-Greiz (Senior Line) Greiz Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe Adolf II von Lippe (*1883) Bückeburg Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt Friedrich Günther II von Schwarzburg (*1901) Rudolstadt Principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen Sondershausen Principality of Waldeck and Pyrmont Friedrich von Waldeck (*1865) Arolsen\n\nFree and Hanseatic Cities[]\n\nDifferent from the above-mentioned monarchies, these city-states are constitutionally organised as republics and share a common history as major trading hubs of the Hanseatic League, dating back to the 12th century. As these cities do not have their own nobility, their ruling class is dominated by long-established Grand Burgher dynasties, called Hanseaten.\n\nBremen[]\n\nThe Free and Hanseatic City of Bremen was once the North German center of Radical Socialism, with influential leftists like Dutch theorist Anton Pannekoek or Jewish revolutionary Karl Radek working and living there. In the later stages of the Weltkrieg, during the 1918 September Insurrections, the \"Bremer Linksradikale\" (Bremen Radical Leftists) stormed the city hall, proclaimed the \"Bremen Socialist Republic\" and declared the replacement of the State Parliament of Bremen with a workers' and soldiers' council - but were crushed shortly after by loyalist troops. Nowadays, most radical elements have fled into exile and peace has returned to the port city; Bremen in the 1930s is mostly famous for its international harbour in Bremerhaven as well as its shipping and aircraft construction industry (like Norddeutscher Lloyd or Focke-Wulf).\n\nHamburg[]\n\nThe Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg is by far the most cosmopolitan city of the Empire. The Port of Hamburg, the fourth-largest in the world, is a melting pot of cultures: Illegal opium dens in Chinatown, international entertainment shows in St. Pauli and goods to buy from all around the planet at the Altona Fish Market. The city is a hotbed of leftist thought; A splinter group of the DOI led by Ernst Thälmann is active in the city and French and British agents sent by the International are operating in the shadows of the old harbour warehouses.\n\nLübeck[]\n\nMany Germans know the Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck as a town whose Golden Days are long over; Once the most powerful trading hub at the Baltic Sea with outposts from London to Novgorod, the Lübeck of the early 20th century is nothing more than a shadow of its past. Growing more and more irrelevant in comparison to the nearby Prussian city of Kiel, an important naval base and the Baltic Sea equivalent to Wilhelmshaven, Lübeck nowadays is mostly famous for its marzipan and meat production as well as being an emerging contender in the North German tourism industry.\n\nState\n\nRuler Flag Coat of Arms Free Hanseatic City of Bremen City Senate of Bremen Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg City Senate of Hamburg Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck City Senate of Lübeck\n\nStatistics[]\n\nLongest-ruling monarchs[]\n\nWilhelm II, King of Prussia (since 1888, 48 years)\n\nErnst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse (since 1892, 44 years)\n\nFriedrich, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont (since 1893, 43 years)\n\nFriedrich Franz IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (since 1897, 39 years)\n\nCarl Eduard, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (since 1900, 36 years)\n\nLeopold IV, Prince of Lippe (since 1905, 31 years)\n\nErnst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (since 1908, 28 years)\n\nAdolf II, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe (since 1911, 25 years)\n\nMarie Adelheid, Grand Duchess of Luxemburg (since 1912, 24 years)\n\nErnst August, Duke of Brunswick (since 1913, 23 years)\n\nJoachim Ernst, Duke of Anhalt (since 1918, 18 years)\n\nFranz, Grand Duke of Alsace-Lorraine (since 1920, 16 years)\n\nAlbrecht, King of Württemberg (since 1921, 15 years)\n\nRupprecht, King of Bavaria (since 1921, 15 years)\n\nKarl August II, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (since 1926, 10 years)\n\nFriedrich Günther, Prince of Schwarzburg (since 1926, 10 years)\n\nErnst, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (since 1928, 8 years)\n\nHeinrich XLV, Prince of Reuss (since 1928, 8 years)\n\nBerthold, Grand Duke of Baden (since 1929, 7 years)\n\nNikolaus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg (since 1931, 5 years)\n\nGeorg II, King of Saxony (since 1932, 4 years)\n\nOldest monarchs[]\n\nWilhelm II, King of Prussia (76)\n\nErnst, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen (76)\n\nFriedrich, Prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont (70)\n\nAlbrecht, King of Württemberg (70)\n\nErnst Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse (67)\n\nRupprecht, King of Bavaria (66)\n\nLeopold IV, Prince of Lippe (64)\n\nErnst II, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (64)\n\nFranz, Grand Duke of Alsace-Lorraine (60)\n\nFriedrich Franz IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (53)\n\nAdolf II, Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe (52)\n\nCarl Eduard, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (51)\n\nErnst August, Duke of Brunswick (48)\n\nGeorg II, King of Saxony (42)\n\nMarie Adelheid, Grand Duchess of Luxemburg (41)\n\nHeinrich XLV, Prince of Reuss (40)\n\nNikolaus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg (38)\n\nJoachim Ernst, Duke of Anhalt (34)\n\nFriedrich Günther, Prince of Schwarzburg (34)\n\nBerthold, Grand Duke of Baden (29)\n\nKarl August II, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (23)\n\nHeir-apparents[]"
