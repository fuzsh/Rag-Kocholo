        "text": "Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Streltz\n\nGroßHerzogtum Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nThe Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz consisted of two detached parts, Neustrelitz on the east of Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and the Principality of Ratzeburg on the west. The first was bounded by Schwerin, Pomerania and Brandenburg, the second by Schwerin, Lauenburg, and the territory of the Free City of Lübeck.Mecklenburg-Strelitz adopted the constitution of the sister Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin by an act of September 1755. In 1806 it was spared the infliction of a First French Empire occupation through the good offices of the King of Bavaria Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria; in 1808 the duke Charles II joined the Confederation of the Rhine, but in 1813 he withdrew therefrom. Having been a member of the alliance against Napoleon he joined the German Confederation in 1815 and assumed the title of Grand duke.\n\nIn 1866 the Grand Duchy joined the North German Confederation and the Zollverein, and began to pass more and more under the influence of Kingdom of Prussia, who in the Austro-Prussian War with Empire of Austria had been aided by the soldiers of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In the Franco-Prussian War also Kingdom of Prussia received valuable assistance from Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1871 the grand duchy became a state of the German Empire. There was now a renewal of the agitation for a more democratic constitution, and the German Reichstag gave some countenance to this movement. In 1904 Adolphus Frederick V, a son of the grand duke Frederick William and his wife Princess Augusta of Cambridge, daughter of Prince Adolphus, became grand duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. In 1907, the Grand Duke promised a constitution to their subjects. The duchy had always been under a government of feudal character, the grand duke having the executive entirely in their hands (though acting through ministers), while the duchy shared a diet (Landtag), meeting for a short session each year, and at other times represented by a committee, and consisting of the proprietors of knights' estates (Rittergiiter), known as the Ritter-schaft, and the Landschaft or burgomasters of certain towns. Mecklenburg-Strelitz returned one member to the Reichstag. The grand duke still styled Prince of the Wends.\n\nThe lingering end of the ruling family of Mecklenburg-Strelitz occurred just prior to the loss of actual monarchy in developments of World War I - at that time, there existed only two surviving recognized male dynasts of Strelitz, the young Grand Duke Adolphus Frederick VI and his cousin Charles Michael who was in Russian service, being a son of Grand Duchess Catherine Mikhailovna. In 1914, before the proclamation of war between Germany and Russia, Duke Charles Michael renounced his Mecklenburgish citizenship. On 23 February 1918, Grand Duke Adolf Frederick VI committed suicide, leaving his cousin Charles Michael as heir to the Strelitz throne. Being in Russia, however, Charles Michael did not assume the throne and in 1918, he wrote to Grand Duke Frederick Francis IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who was acting as regent in Strelitz, stating that he wished to renounce his rights of succession to Strelitz, though the letter was only received by Frederick Francis in 1919 after the end of German monarchies, so the issue of succession could not be resolved in time.\n\nThe House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz survives to this day descending from Duke George, the morganatic son of Duke George Alexander with Countess Natalia Carlow and nephew of Duke Charles Michael, who adopted him in 1928. George subsequently assumed the title \"Duke of Mecklenburg\" (Serene Highness) which was acknowledged by Grand Duke Frederick Francis IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was later given the style of Highness by the House of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. George's grandson Borwin is the present head of the House of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The American county of Mecklenburg which includes the city of Charlotte, North Carolina is named after the duchy.\n\nList of the Dukes and Grand Dukes of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nTitles and Styles of the Ducal House\n\nThe members of this family bore the titles Duke or Duchess of Mecklenburg together formal appellation of His or Her Highness."
