The Dukes of Mecklenburg, Albert II. and John I., acquired the county of Schwerin in 1358 – the original heartland of the Obotrite kingdom.

The Duchy of Pomerania is separated again in 1372. The territory of Pomerania-Slupsk is removed from Pomerania-Wolgast and awarded to Bogislaw V. (circa 1318–1373/74); his sons succeed him after his death.
