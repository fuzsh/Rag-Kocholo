Cordwainer Smith, the pseudonym of Dr. Paul M.A. Linebarger, is an author whose work has long fascinated and inspired readers of science fiction. His singular novel, Norstrilia, is a prime example of his unique storytelling style, blending the fantastical with the profound in a way that only Smith could achieve. For those who are uninitiated, Norstrilia is a narrative tapestry woven with threads of whimsy, dystopia, and philosophical inquiry. Let’s dive into this extraordinary novel and uncover the layers that make it a masterpiece of speculative fiction.

The World of Norstrilia

Norstrilia, short for Old North Australia, is a planet that stands at the heart of Cordwainer Smith’s only full-length novel. This world is unlike any other in science fiction—a rugged, deeply conservative society that has grown immensely wealthy thanks to a peculiar disease affecting its sheep. These sheep, grotesquely bloated from their affliction, produce a substance called stroon, which grants near-immortality. It’s a premise that sounds almost absurd, yet Smith weaves it into a compelling narrative that speaks to deeper themes of wealth, mortality, and human nature.

The Economy of Immortality

The economic monopoly that Norstrilia holds over stroon makes it the wealthiest planet in the galaxy. However, this wealth comes with its own set of problems. The natives of Norstrilia guard their precious sheep and the source of stroon with fierce jealousy, ensuring that neither the disease nor the drug can be exported to other worlds. This monopoly creates a societal structure that is both conservative and insular, with strict population control measures to prevent overcrowding and degeneration. It’s a fascinating exploration of how wealth and immortality can shape a society, leading to both progress and stagnation.

Rod McBan: A Hero’s Journey

At the center of Norstrilia is Rod McBan, a young man from an ancient family who faces a life-altering test. Unlike his peers, Rod suffers from an inability to communicate telepathically, a skill that is crucial in his society. This disability puts his life at risk, as the test determines whether he will be allowed to live or die. Rod’s struggle with his telepathic incapacity and his subsequent survival is a classic hero’s journey, marked by trials and tribulations that push him to his limits.

The Test of Survival

Rod’s journey begins with the test that threatens his existence. His inability to communicate telepathically makes him an outcast, and the test is a brutal reminder of his society’s harshness. Yet, Rod’s resilience and ingenuity shine through when he uses an ancient, illegal computer to gamble his inherited wealth on the galactic stock market. This risky venture pays off spectacularly, making Rod the richest man in the universe overnight and setting him on a path that will take him far from his home planet.

The Voyage to Old Earth

With his newfound wealth, Rod embarks on a journey to Earth, the cradle of humanity. This voyage is more than just a physical journey; it’s a metaphorical exploration of identity, belonging, and the search for meaning. On Earth, Rod encounters a society vastly different from his own, one mired in complexity and stagnation. The contrast between Norstrilia’s rugged conservatism and Earth’s sybaritic inertia provides a rich backdrop for the novel’s exploration of cultural and philosophical themes.

The Rediscovery of Man

On Earth, Rod becomes involved with the underpeople—animals genetically modified to resemble humans—and the “Rediscovery of Man” movement. This initiative, led by certain members of the Instrumentality, seeks to rejuvenate a humanity that has become complacent and stagnant. The underpeople’s struggle for recognition and equality mirrors real-world social issues, adding a layer of depth to the narrative. Rod’s interactions with the underpeople and his involvement in the movement highlight his growth as a character and his evolving understanding of what it means to be human.

The Instrumentality of Mankind

The universe of Norstrilia is overseen by the Lords of the Instrumentality, a scientific priesthood that governs the galaxy with a mix of benevolence and control. This enigmatic group is a recurring element in Cordwainer Smith’s stories, adding a layer of mystique and complexity to the novel’s world-building. The Instrumentality’s role in shaping the future of humanity and its involvement in the Rediscovery of Man movement are central to the novel’s philosophical explorations.

Themes of Control and Freedom

The Instrumentality’s control over the galaxy raises questions about the balance between order and freedom. While their governance ensures stability and progress, it also imposes limits on individual autonomy and societal growth. The Rediscovery of Man movement, with its emphasis on reclaiming human vitality and creativity, represents a challenge to the Instrumentality’s authority and a call for a more dynamic and free-spirited humanity. This tension between control and freedom is a recurring theme in Smith’s work, reflecting his deep interest in the philosophical and ethical dimensions of power.

A Tapestry of Whimsy and Depth

One of the most distinctive aspects of Norstrilia is its blend of whimsy and depth. Smith’s writing is characterized by its lyrical, almost sing-song quality, which gives the narrative a whimsical, fairy-tale-like feel. This whimsicality is balanced by the novel’s profound themes and philosophical inquiries, creating a rich tapestry that engages both the imagination and the intellect.

Whimsical Titles and Memorable Characters

Smith’s penchant for whimsical titles is evident in his short stories, and Norstrilia is no exception. The novel is filled with memorable characters and vividly drawn settings that evoke a sense of wonder and curiosity. Rod McBan’s encounters with the underpeople, the enigmatic Lords of the Instrumentality, and the diverse inhabitants of Earth are all infused with a sense of whimsy and eccentricity that makes the novel a joy to read.

Philosophical Inquiries and Veiled Religious Overtones

Beneath the whimsical surface of Norstrilia lies a rich vein of philosophical inquiry and veiled religious overtones. The novel’s exploration of themes such as immortality, identity, and the nature of humanity is deeply thought-provoking. Smith’s background in psychological warfare and his academic interests in philosophy and religion are evident in the novel’s complex, multi-layered narrative. The tension between the sybaritic stagnation of Earth and the rugged conservatism of Norstrilia serves as a backdrop for the novel’s meditation on the human condition and the quest for meaning in a vast, indifferent universe.
