It's jarring to hear about the background and co-author of a story before the last words are silent.\n\nGreat Science Fiction\n\nSeems like it has been a while since Audible released some great, classic science fiction, and this mid-century collection of short stories by \"Cordwainer Smith\" (aka Paul Linebarger, an East Asia scholar whose father was an activist in the 1911 Chinese Revolution) is one of the best. It's hard to come by in print unless you can find used copies online. Linebarger published all his SF under his pen name, all set within the same beguiling future that spanned thousands of years. The stories are exceptional--highly idiosyncratic in language and structure (influenced by Chinese fables) with great feeling for the sublime and the grotesque, as well as social justice. A real one-of-a-kind marvel.\n\nThe audiobook is well read in a perfectly relaxed, warm tone. Unfortunately, it highlights Audible's insufficient chapter system. It's a collection of short stories, many broken up into parts, with separate introductions for each. The Audible app devotes a chapter number to each of these elements, without any titles or ways to group them into wholes. It's a real problem of organization that prevents anyone from simply jumping to a specific story, as they would with a book in print using the Table of Contents. For example, one of the best stories is \"The Game of Rat and Dragon,\" which is the third story in the collection, but it's only listed as \"Chapter 19\" and is broken up into five chapters (through 23) because the story is written in five parts. Audible should really fix this, as it makes navigating the collection very difficult.\n\nComplete chapter list and titles\n\n1. Cordwainer Smith: The Shaper of Myths (J. J. Pierce)\n\n2. Scanners Live in Vain\n\n3. The Lady Who Sailed the Soul\n\n4. The Game of Rat and Dragon\n\n5. The Burning of the Brain\n\n6. Golden the Ship Was, Oh! Oh! Oh!\n\n7. The Crime and the Glory of Commander Suzdal\n\n8. The Dead Lady of Clown Town\n\n9. Under Old Earth\n\n10. Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons\n\n11. Alpha Ralpha Boulevard\n\n12. The Ballad of Lost C'mell\n\n13. A Planet Named Shayol"
