        "text": "Norstrilia [top]\n\nFirst published 1975\n\nThird Printing in 1978, November. Del Rey Science Fiction, paperback\n\nFirst Canadian Printing: 1975, March, ISBN 0345278003\n\nPortions of this novel were published under different titles: The Planet Buyer (Copyright 1964); and The Underpeople (Copyright 1968 by Genevieve Linebarger)\n\nStory: Rod McBan: The Hundred and Fifty-First. The Richest Boy in the Galaxy. He passed the test of the Garden of Death, but was still a telepathic cripple-a danger to Norstrilia his enemies claimed, as owner of the guarded planet's key landholding: the Station of Doom. The only road to safety, his computer told him was to become the richest man in the Universe...and he did, in one crowded, unbelievable night. The computer's logic was faultless...but Man isn't logical. And now Roderick Frederick Ronald William MacArthur McBan 151st had a galaxy of people-and other beings-out to rob him, to use him...or to kill him!\n\nWhat happens in the story?\n\nIt starts with Rod McBan. We know his family was distinguished. We know the poor kid was born to troubles.\n\nWhy shouldn't he have troubles?\n\nHe was due to inherit the Station of Doom.\n\nAnd then he gets around. He crosses all sorts of people. C'mell, the most beautiful of the girlygirls of Earth. Jean-Jacques Vomact, whose family must have preceded the human race. The wild old man of Adaminaby. The trained spiders of Earthport. The subcommissioner Teadrinker. The Lord Jestocost, whose name is a page in history. The friends of the Ee-telly-kelly, and a queer tankful of friends they were. B'dank, of the cattle-police. The Catmaster. Tostig Amaral, about whom the less said the better. Ruth, in pursuit. C'mell in flight. The Lady Johanna, laughing.\n\nHe gets away.\n\nHe got away. See, that's the story. Now you don't have to read it.\n\nExcept for the details."
