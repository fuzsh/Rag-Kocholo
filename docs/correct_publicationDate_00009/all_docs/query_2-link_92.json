        "text": "Maybe it is that hopeless romantic in Smith that attracts me so much to his work, because I certainly consider myself one. Regardless of what it is, Smith’s sf stories just sing to me. There is something special there, something hard to define that makes me feel differently than I do reading the works of most authors. His fiction is certainly unconventional, especially when compared against the short fiction of his contemporaries, but boy does it pack a wallop.\n\nScanners Live in Vain is a great story, by the way. I often wonder, with stories like this, what it would have been like to be the average joe SF fan, walking into a store to grab a copy of this or that sf mag only to take it home to read what would turn out to be a true classic. When I read SF mags or anthologies today I often wonder if the stories that leap out to me will be read and loved decades later by new readers looking for a blast of nostalgia or if the world is changing too much for that kind of thing to be a reality.\n\nI’m so glad Smith’s daughter has that website for him up. We had a brief conversation or two back when I first posted about Smith and she seems like a very sweet lady who understandably loves seeing her father’s work continue to have an impact today.\n\nCordwainer Smith (you gotta love that pseudonym) was an interesting individual with one of the most creative imaginations ever to be put down on paper. I’m thrilled that a good friend turned me on to his work a few years back and am thrilled that you decided to give him a try."
