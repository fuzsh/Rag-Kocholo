        "text": "Owing to the screen size of your device, you may obtain a better viewing experience by rotating your device a quarter-turn (to get the so-called “panorama” screen view).\n\nA Few Words About Cordwainer Smith\n\nRegrettably, I have not yet had an opportunity to write an essay on this author, but the “Other Resources” section below will lead you to some information about the “Notable Books” listed farther down this page.\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nOther Cordwainer Smith Resources\n\nCordwainer Smith Resources on the Web\n\nThere is a pleasing sufficiency of material available—pleasing, because one sometimes gets the impression that Smith is almost forgotten today, but the resources inspire hope that such is not the case. (Though as I update this page in 2020, I see that quite a few of those resources are gone and now available only through archived copies at The Wayback Machine).\n\nThe principal resource is Cordwainer Smith and His Remarkable Science Fiction, a dedicated site webmastered by a daughter of Smith’s. Besides that, Emeritus Professor of Psychology at UC Davis Alan Elms has a highly utile Cordwainer Smith Unofficial Biography Page, which is in fact not a “page” but a solid mini-site, with a biography, a bibliography, essays, links, and more: quite a treasure trove [archived copy].\n\nThere is also a lengthy and useful Smith page at The Templeton Gate site [archived copy]. And there are not a few extensive, insightful essays around, such as Graham Sleight's Yesterday’s Tomorrows: Cordwainer Smith at the Locus magazine site; “Cats, cruelty and children” by Angus McIntyre; and Christianity In the Science Fiction of “Cordwainer Smith” by James B. Jordan [archived copy]. And, not least, there is a Smith-related blog, still running.\n\nThere are also numerous individual appreciations of Smith’s work: it seems that scarcely anybody can read it and not feel moved to comment on its wonders and delights. I don’t usually just give a roll-call of pages for an author, but these each deserve mention on two counts: first, each contributes at least something toward an understanding of, or at least feeling for, Smith’s works; and second, they each evince that intensity that Smith seems so universally to evoke. Note, incidentally, that quite a few are by writers who are themselves published authors. They include (and I apologize if I’ve left any meaningful ones out):\n\nJeff VanderMeer’s Ecstatic Days, Cordwainer Smith;\n\nChris Roberson’s \"Interminable Ramble\" for February 13, 2006;\n\nDani Zweig’s Belated Reviews #8: Cordwainer Smith;\n\nRagnar’s Weeb Page: Cordwainer Smith (this site also has a useful timeline for Smith's future history);\n\nJohn Robinson’s The Rosy Gloom of Cordwainer Smith;\n\nAnthony G. Williams’s Norstrilia by Cordwainer Smith;\n\nBrandon Barr’s The Masters: Cordwainer Smith, which contains a neat and cohesive analysis of the religious symbolism of one of Smith's best-known stories (“Scanners live in Vain”); [archived copy]\n\nJoel Segal’s Cordwainer Smith; [archived copy]\n\nWilliam Alan Ritch’s Paean of Found C’Smith, a review of We the Underpeople; [archived copy]\n\nCynthia Ward’s review of Norstrilia at SciFi.com; [archived copy]\n\nPlok’s Madness as Allegory: Cordwainer Smith’s “Alpha Ralpha Boulevard” [archived copy] (Note that the reader responses are at least as interesting and useful as the main entry.)\n\nPeter Tieryas’s How Cordwainer Smith’s Work Influenced the Writing of Mecha Samurai Empire\n\nGautham Shenoy’s The (re)discovery of Cordwainer Smith, the shaper of myths\n\nThere is also a very brief but nonetheless interesting note at the self-descriptive page The Religious Affiliation of Cordwainer Smith [archived copy], and a curious article in The Atlantic; and, as expected, a useful Smith page at The Encyclopedia of Science-Fiction.\n\nAn absorbing and unusual site is the graphic 160th Century Worlds Tour, a “work-in-progress” by virtual-reality artist Corby James Waste that consists of a visual “tour” of of Smith’s imagined far-future universe. It’s impressive, informative, and a lot of fun, too.\n\nLet me also mention the site of The Cordwainer Smith Foundation, which annually awards the Cordwainer (in full, The Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award) “to a science-fiction or fantasy writer whose work displays unusual originality, embodies the spirit of Cordwainer Smith’s fiction, and deserves renewed attention or ‘Rediscovery’.”\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nThere are at least a few books (these may not be all):\n\nThe Science Fiction of Cordwainer Smith by Karen Hellekson\n\nConcordance to Cordwainer Smith by Anthony R. Lewis\n\nExploring Cordwainer Smith (33-page booklet) edited by Andrew Porter [now apparently unfindable]\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nNotable Science-Fiction and Fantasy Books by Cordwainer Smith ****\n\nNorstrilia\n\nThe Rediscovery of Man\n\nReturn to the page top. ↑\n\nDisclaimers | Privacy Policy\n\nAll content copyright © 2024 The Owlcroft Company\n\n(excepting quoted material, which is believed to be Fair Use).\n\nThis web page is strictly compliant with the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) HyperText Markup Language (HTML5) Protocol versionless “Living Standard” and the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3) Protocol v3 — because we care about interoperability.
