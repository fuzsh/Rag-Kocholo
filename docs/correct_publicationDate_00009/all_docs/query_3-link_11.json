Linebarger was born in Milwaukee in 1913 but grew up in Japan, China, France, and Germany. He was the godson of Sun Yat-sen. He earned his Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins when he was 23.\n\nHis first professional science fiction story, \"Scanners Live in Vain,\" was published in Fantasy Book in 1950. It wasn't until the mid-fifties, though, that Frederik Pohl encouraged \"Smith\" to write more. Most of his science fiction was written between 1955 and 1966. He died in 1966.\n\nIn addition to the stories included in this book, Linebarger wrote one SF novel, Norstrilia, and (under other pen names) three mainstream novels—Ria, Corola, and Atomsk. He was also the author of Psychological Warfare, which is still regarded as the authoritative book in its field.\n\nCordwainer Smith's daughter has set up a web site about him and his work.\n\nPrinting History\n\nCover art by Jack Gaughan (originally used for the Pyramid collection of Cordwainer Smith stories Space Lords)\n\nThe book number 0-915368-56-0 was reserved for this collection because of the prevlaence of the number 56 in the writings of Cordwainer Smith."
