        "text": "Australian small press book publisher\n\nNorstrilia Press is a small press publishing house based in St. Kilda, Victoria, Australia. It was established in 1975 prior to Aussiecon, Australia's first world science fiction convention, by Rob Gerrand, Bruce Gillespie and Carey Handfield.[1] Its primary aim was to publish science fiction, fantasy, critical essay collections and other genre works that were unlikely to see publication by other publishers.[2]\n\nThe press took its name from an imaginary planet from the works of Cordwainer Smith, an American author who was, for a time, resident in Australia. In Smith's fictional universe, \"Nortstrilia\" is the name given to the planet \"Old North Australia\".\n\nThis is a chronological list of books published by Norstrilia Press.[3]\n\nPhilip K Dick: Electric Shepherd edited by Bruce Gillespie\n\nThe Altered I : An Encounter with Science Fiction edited by Lee Harding\n\nThe View From the Edge : A Workshop of Science Fiction Stories edited by George Turner\n\nThe Moon in the Ground by Keith Antill\n\nThe Dreaming Dragons : A Time Opera by Damien Broderick\n\nThe Stellar Guage : Essays on Science Fiction Writers edited by Michael J.
