Born in Milwaukee in 1913 his godfather was the Chinese revolutionary and political leader Sun Yat-sen - the result of his political activist father's close ties with leaders of the Chinese revolution. Smith held a PhD in Political Science from Johns Hopkins served in the US military during the Second World War and acted as an adviser to President Kennedy. Although he only published one novel Norstrilia Smith is well regarded for his short fiction the majority of which is set in his future history of the Instrumentality of Mankind."
