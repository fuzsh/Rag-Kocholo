        "text": "Cordwainer Smith was the science fiction pen name of Paul M. A. Linebarger, 1913-1966, a professor of Asiatic Politics at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C. Linebarger wrote a definitive text, Psychological Warfare, other scholarly works, and other fiction, but it is his science fiction that continues to have the strongest fan base. His science fiction was written in a relatively short part of his life, from after World War II until his untimely death at the age of 53. All of his science fiction has been collected into two books, The Rediscovery of Man (stories) and Norstrilia (the only novel he wrote as Cordwainer Smith), both published by NESFA. It has been translated into numerous languages, and has influenced many of the great science fiction writers who wrote after him."
