        "text": "8.5/10\n\nWhat a wild, silly, unpredictable story!\n\nIn the year 15,000, the planet Old North Australia (Norstrilia) is the richest planet in the universe. Inhabited by a tiny population of farmers, the planet exports an elixir of immortality, which the farmers harvest from their immense mutated 1,000 ton sheep. The farmers, wealthy beyond dreams, but also xenophobic, arrogant and proud, stick to their old lifestyle and to their old dusty ranches under grey skies, and never even leave the planet. Until Rod McBan, heir to one of the most powerful old ranches, takes his wealth and leaves for the big universe. One of the first things he does is buy planet Earth, which, for all concerned, is an embarrassing situation.\n\nIf you’ve read Smith’s short stories in his The Rediscovery of Man collection, you will know what kind of tone in his writing to expect and what kind of future world he built. The novel is set in the same universe as those short stories but you can read it without having knowledge of them. However, I wouldn’t recommend it. Smith often refers to those stories, such as A Planet Named Shayol, Mother Hitton’s Littul Kittons and Alpha Ralpha Boulevard. An elaborate future timeline was constructed by Smith and Norstrilia is part of it, and those short stories could be seen as prologues to this novel. They will enrich your experience of it. By the way, it has been a decade and a half since I last read those short stories and I remember them as if it was yesterday. That’s how memorable Smith’s writing is. Norstrilia is no different.\n\nRod McBan the One Hundred Fifty-First leaves Norstrilia because he is a telepathic cripple (he’s actually too strong – all he can do is yell, mentally) and therefore doesn’t easily fit in with the rest of his people, and Norstrilia’s draconic population laws put him at risk of being culled and sent to the giggle death, to the Hoohoo House. Rod’s story is a sort of madcap journey, told in an irreverent, zany style that has echoes in it of Kurt Vonnegut and R.A. Lafferty. I can easily see how some would find his style annoying. He is seems preoccupied with being zany and treats many of his SF ideas as throwaway articles. I found it quite entertaining, though. Smith also has the imagination to match. The story is full of odd ideas and odder situations. One idea that plays a large role is that of underpeople – animals bioengineered to walk and talk like humans, yet exist as a lower social class. One of those underpeople is the cat-lady C’Mell from the short story The Ballad of Lost C’Mell, and Norstrilia is in some ways a sequel to that story.\n\nNorstrilia deals with the themes of huge wealth inequalities and the effects that can have, and how people opt to deal with it. The Norstrilians live controlled, simple, frugal and pastoral lives where ancestry and code of honour are everything. They keep themselves poor and don’t enjoy their wealth except for the occasional eccentric who buys an off-world palace. Rod McBan comes to Earth as Mr Money but he is still a countryside yokel and actually in grave danger of being kidnapped. The solution is to disguise him as an underperson, a cat, and so he becomes C’Rod and partners up with C’Mell.\n\nSmith’s future is grotesque. It has the high technology and biotech, but also the kind of creepy carnival feeling of monstrous sheep, a danger of death that keeps popping up in many disguises and the kind of future that M. John Harrison created in Light (2002) where you could find cat people, rundown cafe’s and accordion players. Smith keeps zooming out to see the events as a historian, to talk about what is normal or unusual about Rod McBan in this human epoch. Smith is engaged in myth-making and keeps the focus on baseline human experiences, sometimes with a touch of melancholy. He rather has his characters recite old folksy space poems than talk about hard-sf technology.\n\nI liked it a lot. Smith is special; he is different from any other space opera writer. But I could only read it in short stretches of time, because so much is happening in his chapters and I didn’t want to overload myself with weirdness. Each chapter had something interesting and unusual going on. Each chapter is like a scene in a theatre play. I loved how playful the story, the writing and the universe were, in general. At the same time, I can see people drop out because there is very little tension in this story. Rod himself doesn’t have a clear goal and he is passive as a protagonist. He’s on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nIt was the imagination of the author that kept me going. And after the halfway point, the human element of Rod’s emotional journey becomes stronger and that helped the story too. Rod’s is trying to figure out what he wants from life and what is important to him, and that’s a little unusual for a SF protagonist. He is still stuck with the values that Norstrilia gave him, and after visiting Earth he has to explore in how far those values still have meaning for him. In one telling scene, a problem that has been plaguing Rod for a lifetime on Norstrilia is fixed by a simple product that was never imported on Norstrilia and which he didn’t even know he could get on other planets. It renders the whole social system of Norstrilia stupid in a single second and all of his grief a waste. Rod’s journey is the human story amongst all the weirdness. He’s just a little confused kid who is forced to explore the deeper parts of himself on this journey. He stays the innocent kid, though, and you could argue that the story becomes less about him and more about the universe around him. He’s the little innocent nobody around which a hurricane turns in the shape of social change, and he is merely the catalyst. (Cat-alyst, get it? Never mind.) It’s amazing how much is packed into the novel’s 270 pages."
