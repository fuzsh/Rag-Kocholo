        "text": "First edition: Ballantine paperback, 1975. Cover by Gray Morrow. This edition: NESFA Press, 249 pages, hardcover. Cover by John Berkey.\n\nA kid had bought Earth, and it was his. Legally he had the right to pump up the Sunset Ocean, shoot it into space and sell water all over the inhabited galaxy.\n\nHe didn't.\n\nHe wanted something else.\n\nThe Earth Authorities thought it was girls, so they tried to throw girls at him off all shapes, sizes and ages â€“ all the way from young ladies of good family down to dog-derived undergirl who smelled of romance all the time.\n\nBut he didn't want girls... He wanted postage stamps.\n\nThe NESFA Press volume The Rediscovery of Man reprints all 30-odd of Smith's science fiction stories, including the Casher O'Neill ones later fixed up as Quest of the Three Worlds (1966). The identically titled Gollancz volume is a reprint of the 1975 Del Rey volume The Best of Cordwainer Smith, which comprises about half of the complete short fiction. NESFA has also done an edition of Smith's only SF novel, Norstrilia, originally published in two halves as The Planet Buyer (1964) and The Underpeople (1968) and only published in one volume in 1975. And the Baen volume We the Underpeople contains five long stories plus Norstrilia. The NESFA Rediscovery of Man is suited best for Smith's fan as a proofread hardback, and annotated with helpful background information."
