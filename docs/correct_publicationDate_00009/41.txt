RATING:

NOTATION: Expansion of "The Planet Buyer" and "The Underpeople". This is the first publication of the complete novel as Smith wrote it. The publishers in the 60's felt that it was too long to publish as a single novel, so Smith broke it in two, adding a small amount of material at the end of "The Planet Buyer" and at the beginning of "The Underpeople" so they could stand separately.

QUOTE….“ We were drunk with happiness in those early years. Everybody was, especially the young people. These were the first years of the Rediscovery of Man, when the Instrumentality dug deep in the treasury, reconstructing the old cultures, the old languages, and even the old troubles. The nightmare of perfection had taken our forefathers to the edge of suicide. Now under the leadership of the Lord Jestocost and the Lady Alice More, the ancient civilizations were rising like great land masses out of the sea of the past”….from Alpha Ralpha Boulevard by Cordwainer Smith
