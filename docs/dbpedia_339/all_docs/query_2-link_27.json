        "text": "Edward Peil was born on January 18, 1882 in Racine, Wisconsin. His parents were John H. Peil (born in Germany; occupation \"Mason\") and Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Tetard Peil, and Edward was one of five children. As a young man, he worked as an apprentist druggist and also graduated from Notre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana. Marriage followed and by 1910, he and wife Henrietta were in Chicago, and Peil had made a career change to theater work. A few years later, the couple were in Hollywood.\n\nDuring the silent era, he did films for director D. W. Griffith, including the role of \"Evil Eye\" in Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS in 1919. Peil also appeared in some westerns including several opposite Tom Mix. In the sound era, he free lanced hither and yon in support/character roles at various production companies in westerns, serials and other films. His movie career spanned about forty years, from approximately 1913 - 1953, and he did 400+ movies. Les Adams has Peil identified in 220+ sound films, and that includes 108 westerns and 19 serials.\n\nPeil was the brains heavy in a couple of John Wayne oaters, THE MAN FROM UTAH (Lone Star/Monogram, 1934) and BLUE STEEL (Lone Star/Monogram, 1934). He also had a minor role in Wayne's cliffhanger THE THREE MUSKETEERS (Mascot, 1933). Mascot boss Nat Levine employed him in other serials: THE GALLOPING GHOST (Mascot, 1931), THE DEVIL HORSE (Mascot, 1932), THE MYSTERY SQUADRON (Mascot, 1933), THE LAW OF THE WILD (Mascot, 1934), and THE PHANTOM EMPIRE (Mascot, 1935).\n\nPeil seemed to get attached to Columbia and Charles Starrett - he appeared in fourteen Starrett sagebrush adventures during 1936 - 1943. In about half of those, he played a lawman. He didn't get many paychecks from Republic Pictures. The best of his five Republic westerns is COME ON, COWBOYS! (Republic, 1937), a Three Mesquiteers yarn with Peil as the crooked half-owner of a circus.\n\nIn the 1940s, an older and balder Edward Peil was often relegated to background/bit parts and his roles were mostly mild mannered rather than villainous. During this period, you can spot him as a rancher, jailer, townsman, etc. at PRC (with Bob Steele, Buster Crabbe, George Houston, Tim McCoy) and Monogram (with the Range Busters, Rough Riders).\n\nOn the trail of Edward Peil ... and his son\n\nThe Family Search website (free), California Death Index and the Death Certificate provide more about Edward Peil and family:\n\n1890 census is unavailable - it was lost in a 1921 fire (and water damage) at the Commerce Building in Washington, D.C.\n\n1900 census summary and census takers worksheet - living in Racine, Wisconsin were 61 year old John H.

Vallhalla was the funeral director and burial at San Fernando Mission Cemetery.\n\nCalifornia Death Index mirrors the death certificate - Edward John Peil, born 1/18/1883 in Wisconsin, Mother's maiden name of Tetart, and he passed away at age 75 years in the Los Angeles area on 12/29/1958.\n\nDecember 31, 1958 and January 1, 1959 issues of the Los Angeles (California) Times newspaper had an obituary and funeral notice. Excerpt: \"... leaves his widow, Mrs. Henrietta Peil, a daughter, Virginia Margulies, and son, Edward Jr. Interment ... in San Fernando Mission Cemetery.\"\n\nCalifornia Death Index has a record for Henrietta E. Peil , born May 20, 1884, and passed away on September 15, 1974 in the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe California Death Index also has a record for their son, Charles E.

Screen career: Harold Bell Wright Co. (\"Shepherd of the Hills\"), Morosco (\"The Shuttle\"), Wm. Fox (\"Walls of Jericho\"), Edgar in Booth Tarkington \"Edgar\" series. Height: 4, 6. Brown hair, grey eyes. Home ad.: 4211 Delmar Ave., Los Angeles, CA.\n\nJack Tillmany found a photo and telephone number for Peil in the 1939 Casting Directory: he listed himself as \"Edward Peil, Sr.\"\n\nDoesn't appear to be too much confusion with our Edward Peil - except that he may not be Senior - just plain Edward Peil. And his acting son is probably not Junior, but is Charles Edward Peil. Methinks that \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" were added to differentiate the father and son in their Hollywood careers.\n\nAbove are photo ads for Peil father and son from the 1925 Standard Casting Directory (available at the Internet Archive).\n\nIn the early 1920s, Gertrude 'Gertie' Messinger co-starred in the \"Johnny Jones\" comedies for Pathe. Her brother was prolific silent screen kid star Buddie Messinger. Starring as Johnny Jones was Charles Edward Peil (1907 - 1962), Edward Peil's son. Above is a 1922 ad from Motion Picture News (available at the Internet Archive) with images of Gertrude on the left and Peil on the right.\n\nPeil Links\n\nAlthough some of the data may be incomplete or inaccurate, the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) has information on Edward Peil: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081361/\n\nand the Internet Movie Database has information on Peil's actor son, Edward (1907 - 1962) (but his real name is listed as Charles Edward Peil Jr., when it probably should be Charles Edward Peil): https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0670523/\n\nNotre Dame University in South Bend, Indiana has an alumni newsletter from March, 1959 which includes a mention of the December 29, 1958 death of Edward J. Peil, actor ... and a graduate of the class of 1904. This link is to a pdf file to download/view that newsletter. Scroll to page 36 to view the Peil death notice: https://archives.nd.edu/Alumnus/VOL_0016/VOL_0016_ISSUE_0005.pdf\n\nBoyd Magers has a profile on Peil at his Westerns Clippings website: http://www.westernclippings.com/heavies/edwardjpeil_charactersheavies.shtml\n\nKay Shackleton's SilentHollywood.com website has several photos of the young Edward Peil Jr. in EDGAR'S FEAST DAY (Goldwyn Pictures, 1921), one of the series of two-reel \"Edgar Pomeroy\" shorts with Peil's son billed as \"Johnny Jones\".
