Top billing (4/5 blocks) went to Spring, 28, rue de la Tour d’Auvergne in the 9th, 01.45.96.05.72, closed Sundays, evening (only for the present) menu for 4 courses for 36 €, where they loved the pintade lightly minted with a gratin of leeks. They also gave 3/5 to the old-fashioned bistrot, La Cantine de Quentin, 52, rue Bichat in the 10th, 01.42.02.40.32, lunch formula 14 €, brunch 16, a la carte 30 €, closed Mondays, where they liked the ½ liter Cotes du Rhone, lamb with thyme and rosemary and chocolate/praline dessert. In the “in-places” section, they wrote of another old (1930’s style) bistrot Mosca Libre, 3, rue Victor Masse in the 9th, 01.48.78.55.60, closed Sundays, menu = 25 €, cooking French food with a Sicilian twist, Palestinian olive oil, Indian spices, Laotian and Sri Lankan tea, South American chocolate and Ethiopian coffee; serving items such as polenta with spinach and grilled swordfish.\n\nWednesday, Emmanuel Rubin was back in Figaroscope with his “C’est nouveau” that awarded 2 hearts to Les Fougeres, 10, rue Villebois-Mareuil in the 17th, closed weekends, menu-carte at 32 €, lunch formula at 22 € {where it sounds like he had a better experience than I did} eating eggs with mushrooms, tete de veau and pear with anise ice. He also gave one heart each to the Louvre Ripaille, 1, rue Perrault in the 1st, 01.42.97.49.91, closed Sundays at about 35 € a la carte for what sounds like pretty good food: Royan raviolis, sautéed petoncles and baba; La Bastringue, 67, quai de Seine in the 19th, no telephone, closed Sundays, lunch formula 10 €, a l carte 15-20 € for runny (not cooked enough) eggs and filet de sandre; the Italian Impro’vista in the 9th and the Japanese Meiji in the 8th.\n\nIn their Dossier, the Figaroscope crew listed chestnuts every which way:\n\nVeloute Cappucino fashion\n\nLa Villa Corse\n\nSausage\n\nThoumieux\n\nVeloute chestnuts with foie gras\n\nLa Cerisaie\n\nPurée\n\nChez les Anges\n\nCake\n\nMaison de la Lozere\n\nMont Blanc\n\nAngelina\n\nMont Blanc and Trifle\n\nPinxo\n\nCold Soufflé\n\nBistrot d’a Cote Flaubert\n\nIce cream\n\nMartine Lambert\n\nBread\n\nMaison Kayser\n\nAnd also: sausage with chestnuts and apples at Le Clou, veloute of chestnuts at Bath’s, scallops with chestnut polenta at Jardinier and pannacotta with chestnuts at the Rose Bakery.\n\nOn his part Francois Simon, ever the imp, got a 2 € cornet of chestnuts for his ”Hache Menu.”\n\nWednesday, the English language GoGo Paris featured a nice review of the Argentinian beef place Unico in the 11th.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Paris Update’s Richard Hesse wrote a nice review of the pseudonymous Leo Fourneau’s book “Bon Appetit, Messieurs!” (Paris, Editions Grasset, 260 pp., 16.90 €) that Margaret Kemp talked of in November in Bonjour Paris but since one must be a Premium member to read that piece, this article gives Americans a nice idea of what Thierry Wolton, ex-Elle food critic’s gripes and goodies are.\n\nAnd on Wednesday, Jean-Claude Ribaut in Le Monde wrote about the judicial/financial trouble encountered by Marc Meneau, famed chef of l'Espérance in Vézelay. It recounts his rise and fall and seeming recovery due to a more reasonably-priced menu of 85 euros with wines and coffee but indebtedness in the millions of euros. Inevitably, Francois Simon in Saturday’s Figaro used Marc Meneau as an example of the perils of the 3-star places and how even the best (Ducasse, Legendre, Martin) must ally themselves with big groups or renovate, make tunnels and heliports and go through all sorts of contortions to stay alive.\n\nThursday, Gilles Pudlowski returned to the lists with his usual melange of items in Le Point. He says he’s following two places recently taken over by big groups: La Maree in the 8th by the Groupe Blanc and the Brasserrie du Theatre in Versailles (NB - menu at 21 €, everyone going out there) by the Flo group as well as the Cantine de Quentin in the 10th run by two ex’s of the Savoy stable and also thinks that Diane in the 8th is in good shape. Outside town he touts the auberge with restaurant La Ferme Ostalapia in Ahetze, brunch at the Carlton in Cannes, Une cuisine en ville in Dax, the cheese (and its restaurant) at La Fromagerie in Meribel, the bread at the Tourte de Besse in l'Oisans and the rillette and other butcher products at A la rouelle de veau in Le Mans.\n\nFriday in Liberation, Vincent Noce wrote an article on Pierre au Palais-Royal, 10, rue de Richelieu in the 1st, 01.42.96.09.17, menu-cartes from 31 à 38 €, closed Saturday lunch and Sundays. {Since Jean Paul Arabian has departed for his justly acclaimed Cameleon}, a new young couple (Nadia and David Frémondière) has fully taken over this spacious, 60 cover place with tables widely-spaced and doors on each end, making it perfect for spies or lovers. Noce mentions tons of dishes they serve, but it’s the gutsy stuff (great simplicity but very pleasurable) that’s best: pork and game, blanc-manger and moist cake with tea, and wine starting at 4 € a glass and 21 € a bottle.\n\nFriday, Jean Louis Galesne covered places to go for light or snack-type food and included: Cojean Le Bon Marché Rive gauche, Baramaki Printemps de la mode, Bar à Soupes et Quenelles Giraudet-Lafayette Gourmet, Seafood Bar Caviar House & Prunier + Senderens.\n\nFriday as well, in Figaro, as Menton1 has already summarized, the gang taste-tested 64 croissants and found Pierre Herme 1st, Le Triomphe 2nd, Duchene 3rd, Mulot 4th and Poilane 10th.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on La Tradition and an essay by John Talbott on “Eating at lunch.”\n\nSunday December 31st, the New York Times published one of Mark Bittman’s “Bites,” this on the As du Fallafel and a letter this Sunday suggested that one can eat the sandwiches at the little square of Charles V Langlois on the rue des Blancs Manteaux in the 4th as well.\n\nIn the January-February issue of the American Saveur they had their 100 Best Of’s that included: #21 a tribute to ‘The French Chef”and Julia Child, #46 Romain Corbiere’s success at the Relais du Parc in the footsteps of Robuchon and Ducasse, and #97 the best ice cream in Nice at Glacier Fenocchio.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of January 15, 2007\n\nMonday in Le Fooding, they wrote up what Gilles Marchal, ex-pastry chef at le Bristol, now at le Blé Sucré, 7 rue Antoine Vollon in the 12th, 01.43.40.77.73 makes; the pastries run 0.75 to 2.50 E.\n\nTuesday, in A Nous Paris, courtesy of co-host Felice, they gave 3/5 blocks to two new places: l’Heureux Pere, 47 bis, bd Senard in Saint Cloud, 01.46.02.09.43, lunch formula at 19, a la carte 34-49 E, closed Saturday lunch and Sunday night, (chef’d by a guy who went to St Martin in 1991, then St Bart’s, then cooked on yachts around the Caribbean and thus his food has a hint of the islands,) where they liked the chicken soup with foie gras and cepes, roast grouper with chorizo and lentils and a trio of crèmes brulees; and Le 16 Tholoze, 16 Tholoze in the 18th, 01.42.64.17.86, closed Saturday lunch, a la carte 20-30 E, run by the guy from Le Square nearby, who serves dry and regular sausage, beef cutlet with fries and crème brulee; regret - not much except beef – treat – lots of little known wines from small vineyards.\n\nThis week’s GoGo Paris features Bob’s Juice Bar coordinates given before.\n\nThe European Gourmet lists several trends for 2007:\n\n-New restaurants god-fathered by great chefs – Sensing by Guy Martin, Gaya by Pierre Gagnaire and Drouant by Antoine Westerman.\n\n-Great starred chefs reducing the prices by ½: eg Senderens, Westerman in Strasbourg and Constant.\n\n-Great starred chefs leaving famous places to set up more modest places: himself to Dominique Bouchet + Auguste (Gael Orieux)\n\nLinda Thalman of Paris In Sites went to l’Auberge du Mouton Blanc, 40 rue d'Auteuil in the 16th, 01.42.88.92.21, costing about 28 E for three courses and 11 E for 50 cl of wine, and had “classic and hearty dishes” like “pintade with roast potatoes and spinach, grilled salmon, crème brulée, vacherin glace, accompanied by a carafe of tasty Brouilly red wine.”\n\nWednesday, Emmanuel Rubin in Figaroscope’s “C’est nouveau” awarded only one heart only to each of five places; the latest (failed) reincarnation of La Moulin de la Galette in the 18th, the tapas/etc. place l’Atelier de 8e in the 8th, the “Woody Allen”-esque pastrami/burger place Razowski’s in the 1st, the Lebanese resto Al Charq in the 8th and the Thai Rajapreuk in the 6th.\n\nThen in the “Dossier,” the Figaroscope group rated places that serve club sandwiches:\n\nThe best\n\nHarry’s Bar, Café de l’Esplanade 9/10\n\nThe Duke’s Bar 8/10\n\nBar Tuileries, Bar de l’Astor + Lounge Daniel 7.5/10\n\nThe middle\n\n1515 Hotel Marignan, Plaza Athenee 6/10\n\nPublicisdrugstore, Park Hyatt Vendone 5/10\n\nLast in the club\n\nKong 4/10\n\nApart\n\n46 Avenue\n\nIn his space, the “Hache Menu,” Francois Simon went for one to Le Pub St Germain in the 6th, where he spent 56.10 E (very Odeon says he) for a half-meal. Go? Well, he sort of says if you’re nostalgic for this sort of late-night place, maybe.\n\nWednesday, as well, Richard Hesse in Paris Update wrote up Le Square Trousseau in the 12th and despite the “fatty” paté and 10 E overprice, he thought it was an ideal neighborhood bistro.\n\nJean-Claude Ribaut, using as a peg the 13th Salon international de la restauration, Wednesday-Thursday in Le Monde wrote about the continued dominance of Lyon in French cuisine, going back to Mère Brazier and her daughter Jacotte, Sonia Ezgulian of L'Oxalis and Paul Bocuse, more recently Nicolas le Bec, Léon de Lyon, Pierre Orsi, Christian Têtedoie, Philippe Gauvreau at La Rotonde, Davy Tissot at the Villa florentine, and most contemporary - Olivier Paget at Le Fleurie, Joseph Viola (Meilleur Ouvrier de France in 2004) at Jean-Paul Lacombe + Daniel et Denise and Mathieu Viannay (another Meilleur Ouvrier de France in 2004) at his eponymous resto and Les Oliviers.\n\nThe big news Thursday was revealed by Adrian Moore in his blog who wrote that “Le Cinq and Taillevent go from three to two, and Astrance, Le Meurice, Pre Catelan and Helene Darroze get three stars, with Constant's Les Fables de la Fontaine getting one star. Pic looks like the first woman chef to get three stars after Darroze..” He also noted that as already announced, Marc Meneau is in bankruptcy. Francois Simon in Figaro went farther afield outside Paris, stating in his article “The waltz of the stars” that Nicholas Le Bec in Lyon, also went to two stars, Marc Veyrat and Marc Westermann gave up their stars, the latter to start over again, and Jacques Lameloise in Chagny recovered his three stars.\n\nThis week, François-Régis Gaudry in l’Express reviewed three places, already mentioned in the Digest: Tante Marguerite with its new chef, Chez Casimir ditto and Bastringue that plunges you twenty years back.\n\nGilles Pudlowski, in Le Point wrote that he is following the little bouchon, Le Panier Volant, 37, rue La Bruyère in the 9th, 06.03.21.29.56 with a lunch menu at 11 E, a la carte 30 E where the Polish chef serves Southern (Fr) food such as Italian meats, a soup and fish of the day, aligot with salad and ostrich with honey; and Chartier, 146, rue du Président-Wilson in Levallois-Perret, 01.47.37.07.21, a la carte 35 E for stuffed cuttlefish, veal liver and pots de crème. He continues to like Entre les vignes in the 12th {me too} and Shanghai Café in the 6th as well as the rustic temple of Savoyard cooking Le Vieux Megève in Megève and Sergio Mei’s Il Teatro & La Veranda at the Four Seasons in Milan. He calls comté the fruit of winter and gives Dominique Schmitt of La Ferme des Trois Frères in Furdenheim’s recipe for Alsacian salad with comté. Finally, he suggests Jean Paul Grosso’s Alpages & Gastronomie artisanal cheese shop in Toulon as well as the mini-sandwich place in Vienna – Zum Schwarzen Kameel.\n\nFriday in Liberation Anne Deguy looked at upscale pizzas (eg with caviar or black wheat) and wrote about those at La Pizzetta, Maria Luisa, Amici Miei + San.\n\nThe Relais Christine site recommends Bath’s, coordinates already given and whole not endorsing the food, mentions the Paris Bodega, 23 Rue Taitbout in the 9th which has tapas and “dining shows (circus, dance, singing… 250 places on 900 sqm).”\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP also published an article by Margaret Kemp on the new site and menu for Bath’s’s, coordinates given before.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nEdited January 28, 2007 by John Talbott (log)\n\nThe Week of January 22nd, 2007\n\nFrancois Simon, in his “Croque-Notes” this week, really liked Spring {don’t we all,} coordinates given before, where he enjoyed the mint flavored petit pois soup, avocado salad and pigeon with pureed almonds.\n\nL’Express has renovated its “Saveurs” section and I finally figured out how. They now have three restaurants each week, usually reviewed by Francois-Regis Gaudry, unless otherwise specified, whose coordinates can be found elsewhere in the Digest; one they call the resto of the week, another “within sight” and the third less than 30 €. This week the first was l’Orenoc, where Gaudry spends most of his time on the décor not the food – a complicated onion/parmesan entrée, an over-cooked tuna filet with a complex sauce and a memorable beet “pop” with many accompaniments. The second was Bonpoint (Katell Pouliquen) in the boutique of the same name, serving a reasonably priced “too good” ham and chocolate mousse and the third 16 Tholozé (Pierrick Jegu), where he liked the charcuterie, “correct” tartare and frites and a “sincere” fondant of chocolate. {Digester’s Note: Because I didn’t figure out that Jean Luc Petitrenaud had written his last reviews for the November 13th edition I have missed digesting the reviews since then. Therefore, in the interest of those who might want to read the reviews of Francois-Regis Gaudry of new restaurants in Paris that are still available on their website, here they are with their dates of appearance:\n\nTante Marguerite Jan 15\n\nChez Casimir Jan 15\n\nLe Bastringue Jan 15\n\nLe Violin d’Ingres Jan 8\n\nL’Arome Jan 3\n\nLe Bon Temps Jan 3\n\nLe Moulin de la Galette Jan 3\n\nLa Cantine de Quentin Dec 12, 2006}\n\nMonday in Figaro, the self-same Francois Simon had another piece entitled “Tempest in a glass of water,” eg teapot, on the reaction of the chefs affected by the Michelin 2007 decisions.\n\nMonday as well, in Le Fooding Elvira Masson wrote up Le Saut du Loup, 107, rue de Rivoli in the 1st (in the Musée des Arts Déco), 01.42.25.49.55, open everyday from noon to midnight (the bar til 2 AM) with a tea salon from 3-7 PM, serving light fare such as celery soup, caesar salad, hamburger with (not great nor home made) fries in a cone and lots of desserts for 20 € for light lunch, 45 € for the works.\n\nTuesday, in A Nous Paris, courtesy of co-host Felice, they wrote up two places serving Italian food, giving 4/5 blocks to Serafina in the 17th and 3/5 blocks to the Bonpoint Restaurant in the store of the same name in the 6th. In their shaded side bars, they announced (all this quoted from Felice) “a takeout service {already mentioned above}, a new cook book called La Cuisine des Papas, for fathers and their kids and the new decor at Tsé Yang, a branché Asian resto in the 16th.”\n\nThis week’s Figaro featured two new products; Lucile Escourrou wrote on January 23rd about a pepper syrup with which to make cocktails and the 26th about a pate des fleurs (lavender, lilies, violets) sold in small boxes at Bon Marche’s Grande Epicerie. Speaking of cocktails, the WSJ’s weekend edition’s Eric Felten revealed that the sidecar, made with cognac, cointreau, lemon and simple syrup was born in Paris during WWI, either at the Ritz or Harry’s New York Bar or a bistro called Henri’s.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded 2 hearts to three places: the restaurant/superb cantine in the Musee des arts deco called Le Saut de Loup, coordinates above, where he liked the tarama, hamburger and veal mignon but not the lumpy rice pudding; the offshoot of the bistro Au Pied de Fouet in the 7th – Au Pied de Fouet VIe, 3, rue Saint Benoit, 01.42.96.59.10, closed Sundays, costing about 20-30 E for escargots, a contrefilet and a lemon meringue tart; and the Japanese Guibine Opera in the 2nd. He gave one heart to the tapas/neo-cantine place S’Agaro in the 1st and a busted heart to Le Bistrot du Palais in the 7th about which he had nothing good to say.\n\nFollowing the Musee des arts deco review, the Figaroscope group’s Dossier was on eating in other museums and covered:\n\nthe Louvre, most specifically the Le Grand Louvre +Café Marly\n\nthe Orsay’s Restaurant d’O\n\nthe Musee des Arts et Metiers’ Café des T\n\nthe Musee Jacquemart-Andre ‘s Cafe Jacquemart-Andre\n\nthe Foundation Antoine de Galbert’s Arty\n\nthe Musee Guimet’s Restaurant\n\nthe Centre George Pompidou’s Georges\n\nthe Institut du Monde Arabe’s Ziryab\n\nthe Musee du Quai Branly’s Les Ombres\n\nthe Palais de Tokyo’s Tokyo Eat\n\nthe Musee Bacarrat’s Cristal Room and\n\nMAC-VAL’s Transversal\n\nAlso: the cafes and restos at the Picasso, Rodin, Musee du vin, Musee de Roland-Garros + Musee de la Musique.\n\nFrancois Simon chose to visit the Café de l’Homme in the museum of the same name, 17, place du Trocadéro in the 16th, 01.44.05.30.15 where he paid 144 E for two meals (overcooked veal liver) and shared a “no taste land” [sic] dessert. The service sounds dreadful (a first-job type waitress who doesn’t drink wine unable to assist in a wine selection, etc).\n\nWednesday as well, Richard Hesse, writing in Paris Update entitled his article “Inspired Kitchen, Wonky Service” but it was worse than that, it was bad service at Louis Vins in the 5th, spilling stuff on him three times and sloppy service at l’Angl’Opera in the 1st, bringing him the wrong main course. Except for soggy toast rounds, everything at the latter place sounded pretty good – foie gras crème brulee, pastilla, roast breast of veal, scallops and blood pudding, figs with bleu d’Auvergne and a pineapple tart.\n\nWednesday also, Alison Culliford, in GoGoParis reviewed two places: Le Doudingue, 24, rue Durantin in the 18th, 01.42.54.88.08, open daily 11.30 AM–2 AM, with 23 and 28€ menus that feature goat’s cheese salad, roast salmon and chocolate nems with crème anglaise; and La Casque d’Or, 1, rue d’Eupatoria in the 20th, 01.43.58.37.09, open for dinner Weds-Mon and lunch only on the weekends, which they call the third serious place in the area (the other two being Le Baratin + La Boulangerie, serving Auvergnate food such as spicy pear, chestnut and blue cheese soup, a terrine, steak topped with morilles, served with cheesy aligot, suckling pig and Reine Claude plums.\n\nThursday, Gilles Pudlowski, in Le Point wrote that he is eagerly following the renovated Pharamond, thinks Le V + Le Tournesol are in good shape but Et Dans Mon Coeur, il y a….. is not. Outside the city, he likes L'Amirauté in Brest, chef’d by Yvon Morvan who trained with Bocuse, Robuchon and Duquesnoy and Le Clos de la Violette in Aix en Provence. He also likes the pastry shop Le comptoir du Père Sotieu in Megeve, the bakery shop Croquants Villaret in Nimes and the macaroons at Adam in Saint-Jean-de-Luz. His recipe of the week is an Easter cream.\n\nFriday, in Les Echos, Jean Louis Galesne summarized eating at these restaurants in Strasbourg: Le Pont aux chats, L'Atable 77, Le Gavroche, Au Verre à soi, Baan Thaï, Le Penjab + Moose noting that he really liked the first three.\n\nAlso Friday, Vincent Noce in Liberation reviewed La Table de Fabrice coordinates given before, whose chef had an Italian mother, which explains his menu containing everything from risotto to game.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on Bath’s and an essay by John Talbott on “One sings, the Other Doesn’t” about good and bad service at Pharamond.\n\nSunday's NYT Magazine had an article by Christine Muhlke on l'Ami Jean, saying that one should go there before the other places on your list, e.g., Le Comptoir + Sensing, and describing it as among the \"adventurous\" places like Chez Michel, l'Os a Moelle, l'Ourcine + l'Acajou, {the last recommendation, I could not disagree with more}. To read the article and the accompanying recipe for its riz au lait, it's here if you are a Times Select member. P.S. the confiture de lait recipe is adapted from that of eGullet Society member – David Liebowitz.\n\nI was remiss in noting an article by Nick Lauder of the FT in December where he wrote glowingly about four places he’s eaten at in Paris recently: the Bistrot Paul Bert, L’Ecailler du Bistrot, Ribouldingue + Gaya par Pierre Gagnaire.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of January 29th, 2007\n\nFrancois Simon, instead of his “Croque-Notes” this week, devoted a whole page to a tribute to and interview with Paul Bocuse on the occasion of his 81st birthday. An accompanying article by Alexandra Michot, announced that the 20th “Nobel Prize of Gastronomy” had been awarded to Fabrice Desvignes, 2nd in command at the presidency of the Senate. I missed digesting Simon's “Croque-Notes” of 13-14 January wherein he recounted a meal at Arpege for two; bill=1,097 €, which while mostly perfect (speck, turbot and scallops), seemed a bit over the top and with not chilled enough champagne, mignardises they had to ask for and a disappearing voiturier; the director of the salle pointed to their car sitting at the end of the street in the pouring rain. He contrasts this with a dinner at the Bistrot Paul Bert for {would you believe it?} the same price – but for 16 persons. Finally he loved a lunch (scallops and veggies and a coffee with heart-clogging Chantilly at the brasserie at Printemps open 9 AM – 7 PM, now run by the Bertrand Group (Lipp, Angelina etc), chef’d by Alain Cirelli who cooks evenings at Natasha. Also there was a sidebar “En Bref” noting that Marc Veyrat had indeed sold La Ferme to the Z Group and they refused comment on its future.\n\nMonday, Elvira Masson and Alexandra Cammus, using a visit to Bonpoint’s new restaurant that they liked as a jumping off point, they listed the “Best of undergastground” places that included: Azxabu, Chez Michel, Les Papilles, Le Pre Verre, Le Water Bar de Colette + Cojean.\n\nTuesday, in A Nous Paris, Philippe Toinard gave 3/5 blocks to La Table d’Anvers, 2, place d’Anvers in the 9th, 01.48.78.35.21, closed Sundays, formulas from 16.50 to 28 € where this old favorite of my gangs evidently has a new chef; the service and music sound dreadful but the food (pied de porc, sautéed kidneys and a chocolate mousse) sounds good. Meanwhile, his partner, Jerome Berger gave 3/5 blocks to the wine cantine A Cote, 14, rue de l’Amiral Mouchez in the 14th, 01.53.80.02.45, open for lunch Tuesday-Saturday and dinner Thursday to Saturday, closed Sundays and Mondays, a la carte about 15 € for fish soup, rabbit with cepes and 20 wines by the glass. On the sidebar they announced the opening of two shops dedicated to chocolate – Cho’room, 5, rue Jean Baptiste Pigalle in the 9th, open afternoons Tuesday-Saturday and Chocolatitudes, 57, rue Daguerre in the 14th, 01.42.18.49.02\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded 2 hearts to three places: the “chic dinette,” not really a restaurant, in the children’s clothing boutique Bonpoint, 6, rue de Tournon in the 6th, 01.56.24.05.79, open everyday but Sunday from 11 AM – 6:30 PM that runs one about 25-40 €; the North African place La Table Algeroise in the 7th; and the Bengali resto: Village du Bengale in Asnieres. In addition, he gave one star each to a Lebanese “resto-snack” Fakra in the 11th and the franco-world jazz brasserie l’Esquisse, 73, ave de Suffren in the 7th, 01.47.34.90.56, open everyday, running one 30-40 € for Chilian chicken, Salers entrecote and mascarpone.\n\nFigaroscope’s “Dossier” covered fish at different restaurants:\n\nMerlan Colbert at La Table de Joel Robuchon\n\nSalmon Tartare at Seafood Bar Prunier\n\nFish Soup at La Fontaine de Gaillon\n\nSole Meuniere at Garnier\n\nLine caught bass at Le 21\n\nWild turbot at La Grille\n\nCod brandade at Le Soleil\n\nSolettes des Sables at La Maree Passy\n\nRougets Barbets at La Cagouille\n\nAnd also: Ray at Cameleon, eel at Nodaiwa, lamprey at Carre des Feuillants, bouillabaisse at Charlot, fera and omble chevalier at Why Not and swordfish at l’Espadon bleu.\n\nNaturally, Francois Simon went along with the game and ate raw bass, bass with thyme and classic desserts, which he calls “Gstaad food” at Le Duc, coordinates in the guides, for 183 € for two. Should one go? More than once he suggests.\n\nAlso, in Wednesday’s Figaro Lucile Escourrou wrote about making good bread by hand, in other words not by machine.\n\nThursday, Richard Hesse in Paris Update wrote a tribute to Fils de la Ferme, coordinates in the guidebooks, where, despite the annoying supplements to an otherwise well-priced (28 E) menu and edgy décor, he had an almost perfect risotto with pieces of melting garlic, carrots and apricots, sea bass and a brochette de banane et pain d’épices poêlée au beurre de clémentine.\n\nThursday as well, Adrian Moore of GoGoParis wrote up Le Cantine de Quentin coordinates given before, where he liked the lunch menu at 14 €, which in his case consisted of starters of charcuterie and millefeuille of beetroot with crab and balsamic vinegar as well as his main – a lobster risotto but raved about an “amazing” 'tarte tatin’ of duck breast with thyme and rosemary whipped cream as well as a 8 € pichet of Cote de Rhone.\n\nAlso Thursday, the freebie newspaper ParuVendu covered Jarrasse in Neuilly, coordinates given before.\n\nThursday, Gilles Pudlowski, in Le Point wrote that he considers Unico + Au Bascou promising and thinks Carre des Feuillants + l’Entregeu to be in good shape. In the suburbs he features Mohamed Fedal’s second restaurant outside Marrakech, this called Dar Moha in Boulogne-Billancourt. Outside the city he touts Tantris in Munich. His product of the week is/are beets for their nutritional value and of course he gives a recipe for Borscht from the Café de la Paix. His shops of the week include a Breton “country store” [sic] like one finds in Vermont – Ty Pot in Carantec and a pastis store that carries 95 brands – La Maison du Pastis in Marseille.\n\nFriday, in Les Echos, Jean Louis Galesne went eating in St Gervais in the mountains and recommended: Le Sérac, 4 Epices, La Ferme du Cuquelin, L'O à la bouche + La Vieille Auberge.\n\nAnne Deguy wrote an article in Liberation on the flowering in the 19th; she focused on places within a couple hundred meters of or on the Rue Rebeval that have opened in the last two years, including: Le Café Chéri(e), 44, bd de la Villette, 01 42 02 02 05, which sounds like a tequila sunrise, chips and popcorn and music place; Le KD, 1, rue Pradier, 01 44 84 76 59, lunch menu = 12 €, which also sounds like a hip bar; Valentin, 64, rue Rébeval, 01 42 08 12 34, which serves Thai-Agentinian-Auvergnat fare; Mon Oncle Vigneron, 2, rue Pradier, 01 42 00 43 30, serving Southwest cuisiune with Southern wines; Zoé Bouillon, 66, rue Rébeval, 01 42 02 02 83 that considers itself a boutique of soups and Chapeau Melon, 92, rue Rébeval, 01 42 02 68 60, a wine bar serving decent food. And in the same issue, Vincent Noce confirmed Michelin’s award to Anne-Sophie Pic of a new star.\n\nIn the weekend Figaro Madame Olivier Hachon-Bueb wrote about a black truffle sandwich from the Restaurant Michel Rostang in his Miam section, this Number 5.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on about Valentine’s possibilities and an essay by John Talbott on “What on Earth Do Two Hearts Mean?”\n\nSunday in JDD’s Version Femina Astrid T’Serclaes reviewed three places: Unico, the Argentinian beef place in the 11th, Partage in the 5th and Le Bizen in the 2nd. In addition, in the main paper, Aurelie Chaigneau has an article on where Nicolas Magie, chef at Le Cape in Cenon, just outside Bordeaux, considers good well-priced restos in Paris – l’Affriole + l’Os a Moelle.\n\nI just got my February-March Gault Millau and they’re now giving headers like Pudlo does in Le Point. Thus restaurants they think are good new ones are:\n\nHier et Aujourd’hui Champion of quality-price\n\nCarmine Chic Italian\n\nPlaces to follow (largely because they are under new management/ownership, excepting Bath’s that simply moved) include:\n\nLe Jules Verne, La Maree, Chez Georges, Chez Bath + Le Rech\n\nPlaces in good shape are:\n\nDrouant + Buisson Ardent.\n\nOthers:\n\nCitrus Etoile for a rendez-vous\n\nViolin d’Ingres got it right (eg the renovation and new menu)\n\nCameleon’s comeback succeeded\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of February 5th, 2007\n\nJanuary’s WHERE had several reviews by Alexandre Lobrano, one of Le First, 234, rue de Rivoli in the 1st, 01.44.77.10.40 {Digester’s Note: that I must admit I went by today and thought too mod to even enter and look.} He describes a mix of “homey” and modern food: mussels in wine and shallots, smoked salmon, stuffed veal paupiette, langoustines in vanilla sauce, macaroni filled with fava beans, a Ladurée-created sponge cake plus, and a “pricey” wine list. He also writes an enthusiastic review of Daniel Rose’s Spring, coordinates given before. In the February edition, he describes in more detail the past history that I’ve read elsewhere of the experiences and travels of chef Samuel Cavagnis of Le Versance, coordinates given before: specifically Australia, China, Viet Nam, Malaysia, East Hampton Long Island, Beirut, Nepal, Burma, Laos and Cambodia. He also reviews two French-Italian places: Le Soleil + La Gazzetta , the Asian fish/sushi resto Yushi 16 in the 16th and a “cozy” wine bar/ bistro” Villa Monceau, 16, rue des Acacias in the 17th, 01.44.09.85.59, with an exLoiseau chef, Yvan Sternat, cooking a variety of blackboard plates such as terrines, eggs mayo, cote de boeuf, roast ham, apple tart and “giant” éclairs.\n\nFebruary 1st, but just posted recently is an article by Véronique André and Marie-Christine Delacroix in Figaro Madame that is part of the run up for Valentine’s Day. They suggest:\n\nA deluxe cruise up the Seine on the “Don Juan II,” leaving from the Port Henri-IV in the 4th, 01.44.54.14.70, costing various amounts from 349-1499 € a couple, depending on the date, serving food (lobster, veal confit with cepes, chocolate) by yet another MOF – Guy Krenzer.\n\nEt dans mon coeur\n\nLe Partage\n\nPetrossian with champagne\n\nAstier for rabbit\n\nUn jour a Peyrassol for truffles.\n\nMonday in Le Fooding, someone wrote about the restaurant Magali et Martin in Lyon’s 1st.\n\nMonday, l’Express did its now traditional three reviews all tilted towards Valentines Day; 1st François-Régis Gaudry reviewed Flora Mikula’s place in the 8th, now called the Saveurs de Flora apparently; Pierrick Jégu doing the Chateau de Maulmont in Saint-Priest-Bramefant (Puy-de-Dôme) and Anne-Laure Quilleriet sampling the food at the Hotel Amour in the 9th, where she terms the menu nostalgic bobo in old Paris.\n\nTuesday, in A Nous Paris, Philippe Toinard gave 3/5 blocks to Le Café de la Paix, coordinates well-known, whose new chef Laurent Delarbre is another MOF, cooking half-cooked tuna, rouget doré and a meuillfeuille. He says despite the tourists the prices of menus are OK: 25, 35 and 45 €. His compatriot, Jerome Berger also awarded 3/5 blocks to Le Moulin de la Galette, who coordinates are also well-known, where some exChamarré folk now serve up dishes such as pumpkin soup, suckling pig and a baba; carte = 45 €, lunch menus are 17 and 25 € with a discovery menu of 60 €.\n\nTuesday as well, Richard Hesse on Parisist posted a review of a new tapas place – the Casa San Pablo in the 4th.\n\nFinally, Tuesday, from the Alps, Adrien Jaulmes wrote an article in Figaro’s travel pages about things in Val d’Isere including restos: La Savoyade, La Grande Ourse + La Table de l’Ours. Also, dated February 6th there was an article by Lucile Escourrou on food blogs, 90% of which are authored by women and have been set up relatively recently because so many blogs were in English. They include: Pascale Weeks, Mercotte, Clea who lived in Japan, Anaïk who uses frozen ingredients and Passion Fusion written by a man who uses lots of foreign ingredients. She had an article the next day as well, this on exoticly flavored pastries and suggests getting them from Le Pain de Sucre, 14, rue Rambuteau in the 3rd, 01 45 74 68 92, Dolfin and Giraudet. Also this week, in Figaro Economie, there was a notice that the Freres Blanc (owners of Chez Clement, Procope, etc.), have bought La Casa del Campo and intend to open 10 tapas places in Paris.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin reviewed five places, none of them truly French, except the toney snack-sandwich-salad place Boulangerie Fauchon in the 8th (one heart). He gave two hearts to an Italian resto-epicerie-cave-non-stop Caffe’Vergnano in the 7th and one heart each to the Spanish Paris Bodega in the 9th and the Lebanese A Beyrouth. Finally, a busted heart went to the Chinese Yse Yang in the 16th.\n\nFigaroscope’s “Dossier” covered Valentine’s Day places :\n\nBig time gambler\n\nLa Table de Lancaster 140 € (all without drinks unless otherwise noted)\n\nLes Elysees du Vernet 160 €\n\nBroke\n\nAu Pied de Fouet VIe 20-25 €\n\nChartier 30€\n\nImprovised\n\nNemo by Bert’s Delivery service 01.47.23.43.37\n\nPremiere etoile Ditto but by Gilles Choukroun + Raphael Berland 01.42.71.67.78\n\nGourbi Palace 30 €\n\nAndy Warloo\n\nA wink of the eye\n\nAstier 39.50 €\n\nChai 33 39 €\n\nFrozen\n\nHotel Kube 200 € for two\n\nIn vino\n\nLes Craneuses 20 € plus\n\nOh! Bigre\n\nWomen’s Special\n\nDrole d’endroit pour une rencontre (Depur) beginning at 20 €\n\nBollywood Soft\n\nRatn 70 €\n\nIndira 50-60 €\n\nVenitian\n\nMori Venice Bar 70 €\n\nMadrilinian\n\nAlmodobar 25-30 €\n\n15 Cent 15 15-20 €\n\nTake Out\n\nBread & Roses\n\nDa Rosa\n\nGranterroirs\n\nFrancois Simon’s idea of the theme is the Hotel Amour, see above, where his bill was 218 € for a room, two dinners and two mojitos. Should one go? To the hotel yes but on the patio side, otherwise it’s noisy; for the food, if you like brouha ha.\n\nThursday, Gilles Pudlowski, in Le Point wrote that he has been following Les Tonneaux des Halles, 28, rue Montorgueil in the 1st, 01.42.33.36.19, a la carte : 35 € with great sounding stuff like: a terrine de campagne, andouillette with mustard, entrecote and fries; and La Villa Monceau coordinates above, whose menus at lunch are 19 and 26 E, and a la carte runs one about 35 E, a good bet near the Porte Maillot he says; and he thinks two places are in good shape: the Café de la Paix + Mori Venice Bar. Outside Paris he touts Georges Blanc in Vonnas, the Manoir de la Boulaie in Haute-Goulaine and; in Clermont-Ferrand suggests getting sophisticated takeout from Picnic en ville and everything in the world from L'Atre des Bourcas in L'Alpe-d'Huez. His product of the week are macaroons from Macarons de Montmorillon in Poitiers and he gives the recipe.\n\nJean Claude Ribaut, in Wednesday-Thursday’s Le Monde wrote an article on the best brasseries in Paris. First he states that one can easily think that the great Paris brasseries, like le Ruc have disappeared or been taken over by the Costes empire. What’s going on now may not resemble past glories for habitués of La Closerie des Lilas, La Coupole + Wepler and while each era changes the situation, they still remain open all day, 7/7. He says the staff have both tact and dignity and cites in particular \"Monsieur Paul\" at the Zeyer. Two big companies now control a lot of them: Albert Frere who bought the Flo group (La Coupole, Bofinger, Julien, Le Vaudeville etc.) and the Blanc brothers (Le Pied de Cochon, Le Procope, La Lorraine etc.) So far he thinks their acquisitions have preserved the quality and consistency of traditional brasserie food such as leeks vinaigrette, céleri rémoulade, andouillette, choucroute, red meat, etc. He notes that since March 31st, seven Blanc establishments are featuring oysters and wines from famous places/regions. He mentions Au Boeuf Couronné for soufflé potatoes, Chez George + Brasserie Stella for the best fries and the Closerie des Lilas for beef Hemingway (flamed with bourbon) with Pont-Neuf potatoes. In addition he likes L'Ascot, Le Gourmet des Ternes, le Coq de la Maison Blanche in Saint-Ouen, and a new place Le Petit Vanves in Vanves. He advises you to avoid Le Café des Editeurs + Le Zeyer, otherwise excellent, because of their poor fries.\n\nIn the weekend Figaro, Alexandre Michot wrote a full-page article on French (and some Anglo) food blogs that starts by quoting eGullet Society member Clotilde Dusoulier and also lists another member Pim. {Digester’s Note: rather than copy down the list of the other nineteen blogs, I’ll wait and see if they post it on their website after the weekend.} In the next column is Francois Simon’s “Croque Notes” wherein he visits Brussels and writes up Bon-Bon.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on cooking schools and an essay by John Talbott on “Price Quality Ratios”\n\nSunday’s JDD has several pieces. Their Version Femina’s Astrid T’Serclaes reviewed three places: l’Assiette, Tartufo + Wadja, coordinates known for all in this paragraph unless stated; Guy Martin, famed chef at Le Grand Vefour reveals his favorite places for under 35 € as Le Radis Rose + Ribouldingue, coordinates ditto; and writer Dan Franck picks several places not so well-known, although again, their coordinates are findable: café Le Closerie des Lilas, bistrot Le Bistrot des Pingouins, 79, rue Daguerre in the 14th, tea place La Maison de la Chine, and restos l’Apollo + le QuinZe [sic], 3, pl Denfert-Rochereau in the 14th.\n\nOne additional source, the freebie journal Voyage d’Affaires reviews and touts l’Orenco, Sensing + Versance.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of February 12th, 2007\n\nMonday, a new book was announced in Le Fooding by Alexandre Cammas called Carnets de saisons Été by Jean-Luc André and Marie Kalt, 45 €, Editions Funny Bones that he calls full of inspiration, poetry and vegetables.\n\nMonday also, l’Express did its three reviews; in the category under 30 €, Katell Pouliquen reviewed the restored Parisian bistro Mosca Libre, 3, rue Victor-Massé in the 9th, 01-48-78-55-60, three courses for 25 €, lunch formula at 11,50 €, open Monday to Saturday, serving food influenced from all over, such as Bolivian quinoa with Sri Lankan paprika, Mediterranean beef with polenta and pleurotes, Magrebian swordfish and over-cooked Indonesian cod (save space for the chocolate fondant with confited orange, she says) and Yves Nespoulous went to Chez George, coordinates well-known, where he recommends the tartare and fries, a bottle of the Cote de Brouilly and a Baba. Finally, François-Régis Gaudry reviewed Megali & Martin in Lyon. On Friday on their website, they posted a stunning set of photos of the following; Brasserie Printemps, Fogon, Eatme, Sensing, TokyoEat, Mood, Unico, Black Calvados, Murano, Rich, Delicabar, Kong, Cristal Room Baccarat, Ze Kitchen Galerie, Le Boudoir, Flora Danica, Bar le Passage, Apollo + Bioboa.\n\nTuesday, in A Nous Paris, Philippe Toinard gave 3/5 blocks to the new twin of La Villa Corse, 141, ave Malakoff in the 15th, 01.40.67.18.44, lunch menu 25 € which features a broad array of Corsican wines, artichoke salad, mushroom and chestnut raviolis, supions and cherry tomatoes, charcuteries, veal stufatu and boar stew. His partner, Jerome Berger, gave 3/5 to l’Arome, coordinates above, where he regretted the supplements to the blackboard menu-carte of 26 and 33 € but liked the perfectly cooked scallops and not bad ray. In the sidebar, they announce the openings of: an offshoot of the Belgian cantine chain Exki, 9, bvd des Italiens in the 2nd, 01.42.61.06.52, serving soups, sandwiches and soufflés; another fast-food Tang Gourmet in the 20th; a wine bar La Cave des Cascades, 101 bis, rue de Menilmount in the 20th, 01.40.33.42.53; and a Canadian resto Le Tadoussac in the 1st.\n\nTuesday, as well, eGullet Society member and author, Dorie Greenspan did a 17 minute podcast for Bon Appetit that covered everything from patisseries (Mulot) to where to buy cookware (at Dehillerin & Mora and the St Ouen & Vanves flea markets) and regarding dining, her favorite museum places (Les Ombres + Jacquemart-Andre), foreign ones (Fogon) and bistros (Paul Bert), tea salon (Maison de la Chine), places in tourist areas (C. Constant’s three and the Maison de l’Aubrac) as well as off the beaten track (l’Avant Gout) and one up-and-coming place – Daniel Rose’s Spring. I was alerted to its existence by Felice; the piece is called “Paris Confidential;” and the interview was conducted by Martha Simon.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin rated one French restaurant worth two hearts: the mignon and sympa bistrot M Comme Martie, 33, rue Cardinet in the 17th, 01.43.80.63.60, closed Sundays and Mondays at dinner, menus at 18 and 23 €, a la carte 30 €, serving Basque eggs, half-cooked tuna and iced Vacherin; his other two heart went to the Chinese-VietNamese Chez You in the 6th. One heart was awarded the chic Westin Hotel over-priced (70 € a la carte) First, 234, rue de Rivoli in the 1st, 01.44.77.10.40, open everyday, serving beef tartare and an overcooked hamburger; the wine bar Les Caves Angevines, Chez Clarisse 2, pl Leon Deubel in the 16th, 01,42.88.88.93, running one about 25-30 € for a cote de boeuf, androuillette and cheesecake; and l’Arpent, 12, rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the 1st,01.42.36.52.90, closed Saturday lunch, Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays for dinner, serving parsleyed ham, bourgigno and fromage blanc for about 25 € (formula = 13 €.)\n\nFigaroscope’s “Dossier” covered Places around 30 €:\n\nBelow 30 €\n\nLes Delices du Shandong\n\nLe Tajine\n\nL’Arbre de Sel\n\nUnder 30 €\n\nLa Cantine de Quentin\n\nLe Cercle du XVIIe\n\nLes Cailloux\n\nLa Gazzetta\n\nFleurs de Thym\n\nAu Bascou\n\nFrancois Simon’s place under 30 € in his Haché menu was the Hier et Aujourd’hui, in the 17th which he says you should go to for the green bean salad, fricassee of chicken and tendron of veal, tiramisu and a nice Bordeaux for 95.50 € a couple (the menu is 26 €).\n\nWednesday in Paris Update Richard Hesse had an account from the Feb 12-13 Omnivore Food Festival in le Havre featuring Anne Sophie Pic, Fabrice Biasiolo and Alexandre Bourdas.\n\nWednesday’s New York Times’s Florence Fabricant had an article on Paul Bocuse’s 80th (really 81st) birthday organized by Alain Ducasse at the Hôtel de Paris in Monte Carlo featuring 80 chefs from all over.\n\nOn Wednesday-Thursday, in Le Monde, Jean Claude Ribault published an article entitled “Confusions asiatiques” about the 6000 Asian places in Paris, timing it just before the Chinese New Year’s Day Sunday. The article covers everything from eating sushi etc on the backs of nude women (for 100 E) to his favorite restos in Paris: for Japanese food: Issé + Kinugawa in the 1st, Isami in the 5th, Azabu + Yen in the 6th and Wada in the 17th. The Chinese ones include Chen in the 15th, Chez Vong in the 1st, Hansan in the 16th and Zen Garden in the 8th. His incomparable VietNamese place is Kim Anh in the 15th.\n\nFriday, in Les Echos Jean Louis Galesne reviewed several restaurants in Marseille : L'Epuisette, Les Trois Forts, Une Table au Sud, Le Café des Epices, La Cantinetta + Pizzeria L'Eau à la Bouche. In the same issue is a longish article on bouillabaisse that talks about fishing for its components, a cookbook devoted to it and how to take a tour of the Vieux Port.\n\nRosa Jackson of Paris Bites in Paris Notes wrote up romantic restaurants that she likes. They included: La Tour d’Argent, Laperouse, Jospehine Chez Dumont, l’Ambassade d’Auvergne & A. Beauvilliers.\n\nAdrian Moore in GoGoParis says that the jury is still out on the neobistrot Urbane, 12, rue Arthur Groussier in the 10th, 01.42.40.74.75, closed Sundays and Mondays, chef’d by an ex of Helene Darroze and Gilles Choukroun’s, serving a 29 € 3-course meal of good scallops with curry and rice pilaf, but dull brownies with ice cream.\n\nThe British version of France magazine’s March edition contained several restaurant suggestions. In Brittany, Restaurant La Sterne, Hotel-restaurant Les Arcades, Restaurant Alizes, Creperie Ti Saozon, Hotel-restaurant Printania + Restaurant le Bulot. In an article on Toulouse they list: Michel Serran, La Table du Sommelier, Le Bruit qui Court, Le Gentry Magre, Valentin + Bicoq. To celebrate their 100th issue, they published their 10 favorite restaurants, that are : Bernard Loiseau in Saulieu, Zucca Magica in Nice, a Bateau mouche in Paris, La Tupina in Bordeaux, Michel Bras in Lagouile, Chez Ju Ju in Camargue, Brasserie Georges in Lyon, Relais de la Poste in Magescq, ’T Rijset in Lille and Bastide de Moustiers in Moustieres-Ste-Marie.\n\nIn Le Point this week, Gilles Pudlowski says that in Paris he’s following Il Cortile + l’Hotel Amour and thinks that l’Astrance + Casa Olympe are in good shape. In Megeve he likes Les Marronniers “Chez Maria”, in Tours Les Linottes Gourmandes and in Le Havre La Villa du Havre. His products of the week are AOC mussels from the Mont St Michel bay, for which he gives a recipe and his fromagerie is Nivesse in Clermont-Ferrand.\n\nIn the weekend FT Nicholas Lander recounted his version of the Bocuse celebration (see above) stating that he was puzzled by the relative paucity of French chefs and that a keen observer allowed as how those that were there were over 60 or under 40 and the group in between felt they had not gotten the reputation they deserved, implying that Bocuse’s role as “Pope” was a make or break one.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on Lasserre and one by John Talbott on “What Makes a Meal Great.”\n\nIn Sunday the 4th of February’s New York Times Travel section, {which just caught up with me,} Sarah Wildman wrote about Strasbourg, mentioning: Chez Yvonne, Bertani, Le Marquet’s, Fleur de Sel + l’Arnsbourg Baerenthal.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of February 19th, 2007\n\nMonday, in Le Fooding, they published an article by Elvira Masson on the food and lodging at the Château de Mondésir in Villefranche-de-Lonchat,\n\nMonday night, FR2 broadcast a piece on the 20h00 News about the business of food, giving the amount of money involved in various chefs’ enterprises world wide; e.g., the Pourcels 37.5 million, Robuchon 60 million, Ducasse 93 million € and the product lines for: Bocuse, Loiseau, Martin & Robuchon.\n\nTuesday in A Nous Paris, courtesy of Felice, I read that Jerome Berger had given 3/5 blocks to La Cremerie, coordinates given in the guidebooks, open for lunch and dinner but closed Sundays and Mondays, a la carte about 30 €, that has been taken over by a couple of young architects and it sounds like quite successfully, adding {to my memory anyway} more dishes and desserts to the charcuterie, but fewer glasses of wine. Meanwhile his co-equipier Philippe Toinard gave 3/5 blocks to Rich, 14, rue Cadet in the 9th, 01.48.01.87.87, menus at 25 and 30 €, located in the SIAPPPP building where precious stones are polished/prepared/sold/who knows?, open to the public, serving chicken nems, shrimp, steak, veal, cheese and chocolate tart. In the side bar, they announced a new food-oriented art show at Fraich’attitude; the opening of a new cave-resto serving bourgeois food, La Cave Des Cordeliers, 9, Rue de l'Ecole de Médecine in the 6th, 01 43 29 39 00; a free recipe book from the promoters of meat at the CIV; and 230 producers etc of Languedoc who will meet the 11th of March in the Carrousel du Louvre.\n\nTuesday as well, in Figaro, Lucile Escourrou wrote of creative snacks like Tyrell’s veggie chips.\n\nWednesday, in Paris Update Richard Hesse found Spring and wrote a nice review. In addition, Heidi Ellison wrote up the Italian Innamorati Caffè in the 3rd.\n\nMonday, l’Express did its three reviews: in Paris, François-Régis Gaudry covered Le Saut du Loup, coordinates given above, which serves a ham club sandwich, a cone of fries, caviar on ratte potatoes, Ladurée pâtisseries, cream of carrot soup, steak crisp on the outside, melting on the inside, all for 50 € a person; in the category under 30 €, Pierrick Jégu reviewed Youpala Bistrot in Saint-Brieuc; and Marie-Amal Bizalion reviewed Le 6 Quai des Epices in Marseille.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded two hearts to two old Chez favorites, revived by a new teams – Chez René, costing about 30 €, serving Swiss chard gratinee, Lyon sausage with potatoes and crème caramel and Chez Georges, costing about 40 € for herring, veal blanquette and a baba. One heart each went to the Villa Monceau, 15, rue des Acacias in the 17th, 01.44.09.85.59, closed Saturdays and Sundays, costing about 35 €, but with menus at 19 et 26 €, serving jambon persillé, veal and clafoutis with apples and pears; the anonymous café Chai Lui, 36, rue Bayen in the 17th , 01.42.67.60.95, open everyday running one about 35-40 € for foie gras, beef and crumble and a new Thai place - Au Petit Thai in the 4th.\n\nFigaroscope’s “Dossier” covered and ranked pizzas:\n\n9/10 La Pizzetta + Amici Mei\n\n8.5 Maria Luisa\n\n8 Cantina Clandestina, Pizza Positano + Enzo\n\n7.5 Il Tre, Paparazzi + San\n\n7 Da Pieto\n\n6 l’Etape\n\nAlso rans: Pizzería Da Carmine, Bartola, Da Mimmo + Le Mercure.\n\nAnd of course Francois Simon in his Haché menu went to another place – the Bistrot Napolitain, 18, avenue Franklin-Roosevelt in the 8th, 01 45 62 08 37, closed weekends where for 100 € he had good pizza, sodas, an “execrable” liqueur of coffee, miserable tiramisu and a ½ bottle of Chianti, saying you should go.\n\nOn Wednesday-Thursday, in Le Monde, Jean Claude Ribault published a straight news article on the Michelin rankings and another opinionated article that questions by what common standards the Michelin measures two different places - Le Bec in Lyon and Briffard in Paris. A companion piece on Gilles Pudlowski’s book on female chefs, already mentioned above in the Digest, is apparently pegged to Anne Sophie Pic’s elevation. It is called Elles sont chefs, Flammarion, and those mentioned are both historical and current figures: Mere Brazier, Lea Linster (in Luxembourg), Anne Sophie Pic, Fernande Allard, Adrienne Biasin, Reine Sammut (Lourmarin), Fatema Hal (La Mansouria, Paris), Judith Baumann (Switzerland), Nadia Santini (Italy), Flora Mikula, Johanna Maier (Austria), Lydia Egloff (Lorraine), Nicole Fagegaltier (Belcastel, Aveyron), and Hélène Darroze.\n\nThursday, Francois Simon in Le Figaro reported on the release of the Michelin Rouge in an article subtitled a “cru de transition.” Most of the elevations and demotions have already been noted, but he does add that Jean Claude Vrinat (in an accompanying interview, see below) is puzzled at the demotion of Taillevent as is Jacques Lameloise in Chagny, who cannot figure out why he went down and up, both stating or implying that nothing has changed in their cuisine; equally questioning is Simon about Laurent whose food he terms “impeccably identical.” In addition, he notes that the Four Seasons management had pumped a fortune into Le Cinq before its knock. Next, he (Simon) is puzzled by the omission of the “Camdeborde generation’s” places which are the hottest in town. Lastly, he takes a swipe at the Michelin for acting like French food is all there is in the world ignoring the vogue and pertinence of foreign cuisine although he does applaud them for listing 484 “Bib’s.” Thursday as well, in Le Figaro there was an interview with Jean Claude Vrinat of Taillevent in which he makes several points, some of which repeat what he said on his website. First, that he knew this was coming a month ago when he had his interview with the second-in-command (M. Mespledes) rather than the Director at the Michelin who had been only once and that a year ago; second, that Mespledes said his meal was totally different from that of 8 years ago but he couldn’t recall the food consumed (ergo, he thinks Michelin is cavalier, kicked him in the rear and has lost its ethics); third, that as opposed to prior regimes, this one handed him no letter with their findings/suggestions; fourth, that while the products he uses are still of the same high quality, the cuisine has “evolved” – fewer heavy sauces, more veggies, etc; fifth, that he’s not clear how he regains his third star and cannot see how some restos merit them while others shouldn’t be so blessed; sixth, that he’ll listen to his clients (before a guidebook) and will change nothing now; seventh, that the charge of running too many covers a night through is ridiculous; next (and most interestingly), that guidebooks are less important than they used to be and blogs, the Internet and word-of-mouth are more influential although dangerous if uncontrolled and finally that the Michelin, through this act, is sending the message that no one is untouchable and is stepping over his body to make its point. “But you’re an institution!” “Like Bocuse.” Answer “Yes, then why don’t they go after him?”\n\nThursday, an unsigned article in Gayot was an almost word for word translation into English of the brasserie article “digested” the week of February 5th, originally written by Jean Claude Ribaut in Le Monde.\n\nFriday, in Le Figaro, Lucile Escourrou reviewed Elise et ses 28 délices, written and delightfully illustrated by Elise Collet-Soravito, a former fashionista/cook (Les Éditions culinaires, 64 pps, 14,90 €). She gives recipes for 28 desserts, each with its own caricature of an appropriate woman (for example, a vertiginously décolletaged Italian widow accompanying a Sicilian cannoli).\n\nAlso Friday in an article in Les Echos, Jean Louis Galesne reviews three sparkling, unpretentious, invigorating, inventive new places he likes in Paris: Le Café qui Parle, 24, rue Caulaincourt in the 18th, 01.46.06.06.88, closed Wednesdays, lunch formula = 12,50 €, menu 17, a la carte 25-30, a no limit on the food Sunday brunch for 15 €, run by a young couple Catherine (ex-George V) and Damien (ex-Daniel Boulud, Goumard + Flora Danica, serving poached egg with vegetables, squid fricassee with chorizo risotto, lamb chops with pine polenta, and chocolate cream – no smoking allowed; Le Bistot de l’Olivier, 13, rue Quentin-Bauchart in the 8th, 01.47.20.78.63, closed Saturday lunch and Sundays, lunch formula at 27, menu-carte 33,50€ run by the Mediterranean influenced chef Raphaël Bembaron, trained at Joia in Milan (the only starred vegetarian restaurant in Europe) who also directs Il Baccelo in the 17th, serving emblematic bouillabaisse, fresh pasta, such as spaghetti with seafood and grilled bass with fresh spinach as well as lots of other pastas and fish; and L'Ordonnance, 51, rue Hallé in the 14th, 01.43.27.55.85, closed Saturday lunch and Sundays, formula at 22 and menu 28 €, serving less light food such as a copper casserole of blanquette, sweetbreads in vermouth with rice apart and rum to your pleasure (eg no limit) with the baba. He says he’s awaiting the opening of several others, including Kinugawa, 26, rue Bayard in the 8th and Alain Ducasse’s Jules Verne in the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAdrian Moore in GoGoParis this week reviewed the deli-snack room Castro Maison, 15bis rue Alexandre Parodi in the 10th, 01.46.07.11.60, a soup and sandwich shop where he says the Serrano ham is excellent.\n\nIn the weekend Figaro, Francois Simon’s “Croque Notes” {explanation: no url is or will be given because they’ve removed “CN” from the website and it’s only available on the free pdf version for about 3 weeks} discussed a survey TNS-Sofres did for the March edition of the French pub Le Chef that showed that only 17% of French folk used a food guide in the past year, that to choose a resto 60% of folks use friends’ opinions and only 4% a guide. He posits that there are two societies out there: that of the guides, mentors, chefs and chocolate medals and that of the real folk, nose in the air, elbows on the table who like places such as Le Soleil, coordinates given before, that delivers good solid chow which one would only need to use a guide for to find its address. The week before, he discussed three places, in Shanghaï, le Whampoa Club serving nouvelle cuisine (of Shanghai that the chef invented), in Lyon, Nicolas le Bec for green asparagus, St Pierre and pineapple Victoria for 209 € a couple with two glasses of wine and a simple bistro/brasserie in Paris – le Griffonnier, costing 45 € for three good dishes. Alexandra Michot, meanwhile, wrote the lead article on the fusion cuisine of Beijing, there was another on the fact that the Chinese like Chinese wine and French cognac and there was yet a third one on where to go to get Peking duck in Paris: at Tsé Yang, Chen + Vong.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published two articles by Margaret Kemp, one on the release of the Michelin, the other on Bocuse’s 81st fete; and John Talbott on “Hyping Paris restaurants.”\n\nSunday in JDD’s Version Femina there were articles on Anne Sophie Pic and Marc Veyrat.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of February 26th, 2007\n\nMonday, in Le Fooding, Alexandre Cammas had an article on the Café-restaurant Jean-Claude Delbouis in Les Bessades Montpeyroux.\n\nTuesday, A Nous Paris, courtesy of Felice, had another article (see above the Week of January 29th, 2007) on the 20th anniversary winner of the Paul Bocuse Championship, Fabrice Desvignes, chef de cuisine at the Senat. {BTW: the Senat’s President’s kitchen boasts three MOF’s and one Bocuse d’Or.}\n\nTuesday, François-Régis Gaudry in L’Express reviewed La Villa Corse as his regular place and Au Pied de Fouet as his resto under 30 € and Anne Cécile de Monplanet reviewed Le Plan des Mains in Meribel.\n\nTuesday as well, in Figaro, Lucile Escourrou wrote about the food art by the “Generation C” chefs (Gilles Choukroun, Frédéric Coursol, Alexandre Gauthier, Eric Guérin, Stéphane Marchal and David Zudas), now showing in a show called “Tool’s Food” at the Galerie Fraîch’Attitude. As an example she shows and explains the update of a barbe a papa of Eric Guérin from Nantes. {Digester’s Note: If you’ve never been to this gallery, it’s worth going to once.} Figaro also put up on their website this week last week’s interview with the resto designer Philippe Starke that was previously only on their pdf version. In it he expresses his liking of many Italian and Venetian places but also the Relais Plaza, Carette, Kong + le Voltaire in Paris. They also posted the article by Alexandra Michot from Saturday on the 30 year old Maison du Chocolat.\n\nWednesday, in Paris Update Richard Hesse wrote a not at all enthusiastic review of La Régalade.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded two hearts to two places, the new resto in the old diamond bourse called Rich, coordinates given last week, and the Thai place Baan Kanya. One heart each went to the very Italian sounding (vitello, penne) L’Eclaireur, 10, rue Boissy d’Anglas in the 8th, 01.53.43.09.99, closed Sundays and the revived (by the Bucher/Flo Group) River Café, 146, quai de Stalingrad in Issy les Moulineaux, 01.40.93.50.20, closed Saturday for lunch, menus at 27 (2 courses) and 32 € for three, serving eggs forestiere, smoked salmon and chicken fricassee. A busted heart went to the Bistrot du B in the 5th.\n\nFigaroscope’s “Dossier” this week was all about Asian soup-type dishes:\n\nBo Bun\n\nLittle Hanoi + Suave\n\nBeef Soup\n\nLe Bambou\n\nSaigon Soup\n\nLa Tonkinoise\n\nShrimp Ravioli Soup\n\nFleur de Mai\n\nNoodle soup\n\nSalon de The Wenzhou\n\nUdon soup\n\nKunitoraya\n\nCrab, asparagus & bean soup\n\nGinger\n\nChirashi\n\nZen\n\nAnd Francois Simon in his Haché menu went to another such place – Zen in the 6th, using his experience to bemoan the lack of curiosity of the French for other-than-French food.\n\nIn Wednesday/Thursday’s Le Monde, the restaurants reviewed were all in Belgium and in Friday’s Les Echos, they were all in New York.\n\nFriday last, Liberation published a more detailed account of the OFF (Omnivore Food Festival) extravaganza in Le Havre, February 12-13th than I had digested, in which Natalie Castetz notes that there were 70 plus chefs, 100 wine growers/makers and 2500 visitors. (Thanks to member Le Zouave for noting my omission.)\n\nAdrian Moore in GoGoParis this week, reviewed the Saut du Loup .\n\nSaturday/Sunday in Le Figaro, Francois Simon in his Croque Notes, wrote that now that the 2007 Michelin wave has passed, he wants to complain about two places got no mention in the 2007 Red Guide, despite at least one’s great expenditure of money on a renovation. They were/are: Michel Del Burgo’s l’Orangerie and Gilles Epie’s Citrus Etoile, coordinates given before. In a nearby article, Alexandra Michot wrote about several places that don’t “lay it on too thick,” either by charging too much or packing in too many folks or both, giving as exemplars: Spring + Violin d’Ingres in Paris, Paul Bocuse’s projected resto near Lyon inspired by Cojean + La Fresque in La Rochette, L et Lui in Saint Paul Trois Châteaux, l’Astrance, Nature & Saveurs in Annecy, and Alain Bourgade, ex-starred chef at La Poêle d’Or who’s opening a place in the 16th. She also comments on the “Tool’s Food” exhibition at Fraich’Attitude Gallery and Fabrice Desvignes winning the Bocuse d’Or. And finally, Christian Flacelière wrote of the success of pink champagne worldwide. (Ironically, in my pile of unread papers was the WSJ of Feb. 15 (p B1) with a similar article entitled “How Moet & Chandon made Rosé Champagne Fashionable.”\n\nWhile I tend to regard coffee-table books with the same appreciation as Parisian dog feces on my shoes, I do feel the need to comment occasionally on newly published (March 2007) books of note. In the Ferrara, Italy Museum Shop in the Palazzo dei Diamanti this week, I picked up a copy of a book by Angelika Taschen entitled Paris: Restaurants & More that has stunning pictures by Vincent Knapp of 35 Parisian eateries, from Le Grand Vefour to the Café Marly. A companion volume is entitled Paris: Shops & More and covers places like Hediard and Androuet. Both cost 9.99 € and available from their online catalogue or failing that, I suppose, in real stores in places like Paris and New York.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp entitled “George and the Dragon Buzz” and John Talbott on “A Marathon List of Restos.”\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of March 5th, 2007\n\nMonday, François-Régis Gaudry in L’Express reviewed Bath’s, Yves Nespoulous reviewed Chez Rene and Pierrick Jégu did Cristina’s Tapas par Mavromatis, coordinates below.\n\nMonday, in Le Fooding, Elvira Masson published an article on the hot new place Urbane, coordinates below, which has an Irish patronne and which serves Irish potatoes and Banoffie = Banana + toffee.\n\nTuesday in A Nous Paris, courtesy of Felice, Jerome Berger awarded 3/5 blocks to l’Affriande, 39, rue Truffaut in the 17th, 01.43.87.21.17, buffet lunch at 11, menu-carte at night at 28 and 32 €, closed Mondays, Tuesday nights, Saturday lunch and Sundays. They replaced an Italian resto with a cantine that serves dishes such as a gratin of endives, soups and a compote of apples. The second review, by Philippe Toinard, also meriting 3/5 blocks, is of Love, 72, rue Vieille du Temple in the 3rd, 01.42.78.91.59, menus at 27 and 35 €, no closing days given, which despite the “drole concept” (pink-red décor, Yves St Laurent New Year’s cards, bizarre erotic names to dishes, etc) serves OK food such as asparagus, roast bar and an “After midnight” dessert. The side bar announced that Mood on the Champs Elysees, now serves Sunday brunch for 28 €; that “Le Fooding” is holding a wine and fooding party – password at www.lefooding.com after the 15th; and that Le Table de Claire is featuring menus based on the recipes given in the books written by the Italian Antonio Tabucchi and Spaniard Manuel Vasquez Montalban.\n\nTuesday, Vincent Weiss wrote in Le Figaro about the new Fauchon bakery serving up deluxe snacks.\n\nWednesday Richard Hesse reviewed l’Avant Gout for Paris Update, not especially liking the food and detesting the service.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded two hearts each to Urbane, 12, rue Arthur Groussier in the 10th, 01.42.40.74.75, closed Sunday dinner and Mondays, lunch menus for 15 and 19 €, dinner 24 and 29 €, which he calls good “Bobo” food like eggs with asparagus, a slab of beef with lime butter and poached bar with artichokes and seaweed and Cristina’s Tapas by Mavrommatis, 18, rue Duphot in the 1st, 01.42.97.53.04, closed Sundays, running one 35-45 € with light stuff such as sardines, stuffed cabbage, tzatziki, etc. He gave one heart each to l’Auberge Nicolas Flamel, 51, rue Montmorency in the 3rd, 01.42.71.77.78, closed Sundays, running one about 60 € for frogs’ legs, sweetbreads and pigeon in the oldest (600 years) auberge in Paris and the revamped Le Reminet, coordinates well-known, that has gone from “bistronomique” to touristy, saying it is not ”totally bad” and giving the price as 50-60 € with a 50 € menu at dinner (that’s a sizeable increase) for quail salad, pumpkin soup, magret and fondant of chocolate. Finally he deems Love, in the 3rd, see above, worthy of a broken heart.\n\nFigaroscope’s “Dossier” this week covered sausages:\n\nDanish hotdogs Le Cesar\n\nArgentinian sausage Unico\n\nSabodet Auberge Pyrenees-Cevennes\n\nYole de Cantal Le Coude a Coude\n\nFigatelli Balbuzard Café\n\nMontbeliard Chez Maitre Paul\n\nSaucisse au Couteau Melac\n\nMerguez Wally le Saharien\n\nBratwurst, Francfort Epycuria\n\nSausage with fennel Sardegna a Tavola\n\nAnd also Saucisse au Couteau at l’Abordage, Herb sausage at Radis Rose and Morteau at the Verre Vole.\n\nFrancois Simon, on his part, went to Paolo Petrini in the 17th where I did find that among lots of other things he had for 137 € for two, he also had tuscan sausages. The food was sometimes good, sometimes not so good.\n\nWednesday/Thursday in Le Monde Jean Claude Ribaut wrote about provençal rabasse truffles and how researchers are trying to figure out hoe they come to be.\n\nThursday, Gilles Pudlowski, in Le Point provided his assortment of food and restaurant likings: he states that he is following Le Restaurant, at/in L'Hôtel, 13, rue des Beaux-Arts in the 6th, 01.44.41.99.01, menu = 50 €, recently taken over by Philippe Bélissent, a young ex-Ledoyenist serving farm eggs with truffles, bar with chestnuts and Bresse chicken as well as l’Orenoc and thinks Chez Georges and Chez Michel are in good shape. Outside Paris he liked Brouilly run by Jean Brouilly in Tarare and La Ferme de Victorine in Notre-Dame-de-Bellecombe in the Savoie. He also describes the pastilles from Moinet in Vichy and the chocolatier Frédéric Cassel’s shop in Fontainebleau. His product of the week is butter from the Laiterie cooperative in Echiré and he provides a recipe for Beurre blanc d'Echiré.\n\nFriday, in Parisist, Anna reviewed Chez Toinette.\n\nIn the March Paris Notes, Rosa Jackson’s Paris Bites covered the Louis XV in Monaco as well as the Buisson Ardent + Le Gorille Blanc in Paris, coordinates given before.\n\nSaturday-Sunday in Le Figaro, Alexandra Michot and Francois Simon discussed six springtime tables that are especially appealing as well as announcing several openings.

Their sidebar also mentioned Fiona Cairns’ cakes, a 15 € special edition of a magazine called Intramuros that features interviews with {Alexandre Cammas and} Alain Ducasse and an ephemeral jam shop – Autour du Pot, 44, rue Lepic in the 18th.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded two hearts each to the newly renovated by the Ducasse-group Rech, 62, ave des Ternes in the 17th, 01.45.72.29.47, closed Saturday lunch and Sundays, which, for 60-90 €, serves abalone and bulot bouillion, gratin of crab and skate wing {sounds good, albeit pricey, why not three hearts?} and a Creole restaurant, l’Heureux Pere in Saint Cloud.

Outside Paris, he liked Kaya in Les Menuires and Le Plan des mains in Meribel. His product of the week is/are grey shrimp, which he calls democratic shrimp, contrasting them with rose or bouquet shrimp, however his recipe is for wild turbot roasted in the oven and his store of the week the pastry-shop Jean-Charles Lemoy in Metz. Finally he mentions a new book - “Tout Robuchon” - published by Perrin, 768 pages, costing 25,90 €.\n\nTwo articles appeared in Le Figaro: the first dated Thursday by Régis Arnaud on the appearance in November of the Japanese Michelin Red Guide; the second in which Francois Simon says Ducasse, Gagnaire, Robuchon and Troisgros may be included.

Francois Simon’s “Croque Notes” was entitled “Chickens, your papers please!” and largely discussed the effort in Japan to declare restaurants genuinely Japanese, the necessity to have fresh good products and his list of “bistrots gourmands” that includes: le Comptoir de l’Odéon, Villaret, Paul Bert, Baratin + Bascou, less enthusiastically l’Atelier de Maître Albert, but most enthusiastically – Chez Michel. In the Style section there were three articles on wine: (1) An article written by Christian Flaceliere about the growing popularity of wine in some areas/countries, predicting huge increases between 2005-2010, for example: 80% in Taiwan, 50% in China, 25% in South Korea and 21% in Singapore; (2) An article about vineyards and wine interest in Brasil; and (3) The push for rosé wines during April of vintners from Provence .\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on the new Pudlo Bistro and Brasserie book and one by John Talbott on “Where we really want to eat.”\n\nSunday in the JDD, there was an article by Marie Nicot about the opening April 12th of a “Flower Bar” at the Galeries Lafayette-Haussmann and she pegged this to an old book by Alice Caron-Lambert entitled La cuisine des fleurs, eg Cooking with Flowers, ACR Edition, 1995, 192 p., 49 euros.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of March 19th, 2007\n\nFriday, February 27th, I completely missed Patricia Wells' article on Taillevent's demotion in the IHT.

Impressive in this Ducasse seafood restoration were the wine prices: not a glass under 14 € and a bottle of Château Simone costing 67 € at the Dôme was 90 here, thus he had a 40 € Vouvray, but the food was good. Meanwhile Pierrick Jégu went to Au Petit Thaï in the 4th and Marie-Amal Bizalion to Le Ventre de l'architecte in Marseille.\n\nMonday as well Paris to the Spoon ate at the Korean place Nam San in the 19th.\n\nChristopher Dickey, Newsweek’s Paris bureau chief wrote an article dated March 26th but posted March 17th, entitled “ Where would I send my friends in which he cites Benoit, Allard + Chez Eux although he also like the brasseries Balzar, La Coupole, Boeuf sur le Toit + Wepler and the Costes places Georges, l’Avenue + Costes Hotel.\n\nTuesday, Adrian Leeds in her ParisParler wrote a perfectly lovely review of Drouant.\n\nTuesday in Le Figaro Cécile Alizon wrote a piece on l’Atelier LZC’s wonderfully colored dishtowels.\n\nTuesday also, in A Nous Paris, courtesy of Felice, there were two reviews, both of which merited 3/5 blocks; Philippe Toinard reviewed Le Bistrot des Faubourgs in a piece entitled “Girly Food,” coordinates above, with a short menu due to their commitment to serve only what’s in the market, such as a carrot and ginger soup, osso bucco and moelleux of chocolate (the Corbieres is 4 € a glass); and Jerome Berger reviewed the pricey (30 € for 2 dishes) Le Saut de Loup, coordinates also given before, where he had a hamburger of today and tomorrow and entremets from Laduree.\n\nWednesday, Richard Hesse published a review in Paris Update of the Bistro des Faubourgs, 55, rue des Vinaigriers in the 10th, 01 42 05 19 05, Open Monday-Friday for lunch and Friday and Saturday for dinner, lunch menu 14 and a la carte around 30 € where he was upset by the repetition of the use of mache as a garniture and the cold camembert and not impressed by the innovativeness of the carte (you could make this food at home) or by Irish chef Carolyn Buckley’s steak or over-cooked sea bream but did like the oxtail and leek terrine and apple crumble. In a final blow he suggests its OK to go there with an old friend or ex-lover where you want to talk not eat impressive food.\n\nWednesday in Figaroscope, Emmanuel Rubin awarded two hearts each to the newly moved and expanded l’Oriental, coordinates given last week, open everyday, lunch menu 14.50, dinner 30 €, the classic couscous place and Le Bistrot des Faubourgs, coordinates given above, where he liked the Lyon sausage, boudin and beef.

In the same edition, Alexandra Michot reported on the trendy-ness of “easy-cook books” where one can make simple dishes. And, in a third article, a Swiss psychoanalyst “analyzes” Guy Savoy saying he sublimates his anxiety into food creations, masters his Oedipal wishes and retains his “bad boy” adolescent rebellious side. {As a psychiatrist/psychoanalyst, I found what he said to be on the border between the ridiculous and the hilarious.}\n\nThe weekend FT had an article written by Nick Landers of the MOF competition (see above), which members whose French is challenged, may prefer to Alexandra Miochot’s article on the process.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on Pierre Gagnaire and one by John Talbott on “Why it’s easier to review bad places.”\n\nSunday in the JDD, there was the usual response of the famous chef about his favorite inexpensive places in Paris, this week it was Christophe Cussac of Joel Robuchon’s Metropole Hotel/restaurant who picked the Cave a l’Os a Moelle + Les Papilles. And, in their Version Femina, Astrid T’Serclaes reviewed the Bis de Severo, Le Parti de The + Le Bonheur de Patisserie.\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nThe Week of March 26th, 2007\n\nVeronique Andre, in Figaro Madame wrote an article on three of her favorite restos for under 30 €, they were: the Villa Periere, M comme Martine + Le Café du Commerce.

He says to go with an angel.\n\nAn article in last Wednesday/Thursday’s Le Monde by Jean Claude Ribaut noted that a decree currently being considered by the Conseil d'Etat will create a title of \"maître restaurateur\", like the one that artisinal bakers now have. {The only requirement it mentions is that one must use fresh, eg not precooked, products, but I suspect that like the “slow food” rules, there must be other requirements.} A second article by the same critic talked about “left wing and right wing” (politically speaking) food and suggests that if you are eclectic and like uncomplicated and unchichi bio or sushi, burgers or fooding, you’re a lefty versus those who admire right-wing traditional food such as poule au pot, blanquette or le pot-au-feu. Extreme righties go for palace banquets, extreme lefties exotic and foreign cuisine. He quotes Edouard Herriot (1872-1957) who said that politics is like andouillette, it smells a bit like feces but not too much. And he gives the restos and the dishes they like there: Valéry Giscard d'Estaing - Trois Marches, François Mitterrand at La Cagouille for oysters and fried céteaux and L'Assiette Chez Lulu, Michel Charasse, at the Ritz for lamb testicles, Edouard Balladur - wine by the carafe, Jacques Chirac - tête de veau and Le Père Claude.

In the weekend Figaro Madame Sandie Meusnier wrote both about Jean Paul Hevin’s chocolate eggs as well as Mariage Freres' tea blend for Easter and Véronique André and Marie-Christine Delacroix wrote up three hotel restaurants - the Palme d’Or, in Nice, and the Hôtel Regina and Le restaurant de L’Hôtel in Paris.\n\nEvery once in a while it’s interesting to see what certain sites’ best list is. This week’s heart throbs for RestoAParis are Le S, Le Bistrot Montsouris, Le Niv's, Fontaine Fiacre, Le Djoon, L'Art Home, Chez Cécile, Pdg Rive Gauche, Le Selen, Shah Jahan + Le Serpent qui danse.\n\nSaturday/Sunday, BP published an article by Margaret Kemp on the Cantine de Quentin and one by John Talbott on “It’s the Wrong Place.”\n\nPlease post comments here and not in the Digest thread.\n\nEdited to correct location of Momoka.\n\nEdited April 13, 2007 by John Talbott"
