        "text": "John George Gardner Brammell or Bramall (records differ, which was the family-name then is unclear, since he used each variation), was born in Rochdale (a suburb of Manchester, about thirteen-miles to the northwest), England, on October 15, 1879 to George and Ellen; he arrived in the United States in 1902. In 1907 at the age of twenty-seven he married Ruby Leona Ross, on September 25; they would have a daughter, Leona (Lee), in October of 1908. Brammell was a man of medium height at 5’7,” quite slender weighing only 135-pounds, blonde hair and grayish-blue eyes; this afforded him the opportunity to play juvenile roles well into his late thirties. Brammell used different spellings throughout his career: Bramall, Bramhall, Brammail and the most popular being Brammall; Jack, John, J. G. and John G. were often seen before his family name. In the very early days he was also referred to as George, but never professionally as Gardner. There is no preface for Brammall in regards to acting; what he did before stage and film, what his training was we may never know the answers to these questions.\n\nBrammall Before Film:\n\nJack Brammall and Ruby Ross were both members of the Trahern Stock Company of New York, in 1907, they became acquainted, then married; Al Trahern, founder and leader of the group was referred to by friends as “Cupid” because of the abundant members of his company who married one another.[1] The Trahern Company presentations were unique in that Trahern had bought and leased theaters on Long Island, NY, in Bay Shore, Patchogue, Riverhead, Greenport, Sayville and Freeport; each week, each town, saw the troupe perform an up-to-date play.[2] This was accomplished by the touring (albeit a short distance, yet none the less a daunting undertaking) company using a Long Island Railroad car to transport the players, costumes, props and orchestra. Although the six aforementioned municipalities were the main focus of Trahern, yet the acting group did make visits to other communities, including Sag Harbor and Cutchogue, which are also on Long Island. When not on Long Island the Trahern Stock Company was performing at the Camden Theater, in Camden, New Jersey, returning to Long Island in the spring.[3]\n\nOne might tend to think that these were humble beginnings for Mr. Brammall who would one day be a silver-screen-star, but, Al Trahern, proprietor and manager of the stock company that bared his name, was a man of some note in the area, controlling six theaters, investing in a significant amount of real estate, while being a member of the Board of Trade of Suffolk County, as well as serving on several of the civic organizations in the towns where his actors troupe were housed. Mr. Trahern was the only theatrical manager who successfully catered to Long Island audiences for any considerable length of time. He and his group, sans the Brammalls, would move on to larger pastures, in Nashville, Tennessee, finally moving to southern California in 1920, setting up a string of seven smaller cities for his regional troupe.[4] Trahern used a similar system in California as he had on Long Island, except instead of a train car he used a bus and trailer for transporting the company and the accouterments of actors and staging.[5]\n\nLeaving the Trahern Company proved profitable for Mr. Brammall and quickly gaining him attention. The first notable part for Brammall was, Ingomar, which was staged as a special event for the benefit of the Lincoln Memorial Hall on Thursday, December 30, 1909; Mr. Brammall was seen with soon to be silent film super-star, William Farnum and a company of seventy-five for this exclusive showing.[6] Winter of 1910, found Brammall portraying Crawley, in, Springtime; William Harrigan and Mabel Taliaferro who had also been in the, Ingomar, benefit-showing, were again with Brammall in this production, in Washington, D. C., at the Columbia Theatre, on February 1.[7]\n\nBrammall’s first role on the Great White Way was, The Call of the Cricket, 1910; this was at the Belasco Theatre, premiering on April 19 of ’10. Cricket had much more success prior to Broadway, playing well in Chicago, Indianapolis, Knoxville and Atlanta.[8] The Broadway run of Cricket was cut short either by the sudden illness of its star (Tuesday, May 3), Mabel Taliaferro or by the drubbing that the play took from the critics. The harsh tones of the reviews for Cricket did not include Ms. Taliaferro, whose performance was considered to be pleasing and that her acting carried the production;[9] the play closed after the showings on Saturday, May 7, 1910, having given just twenty-five performances.[10]\n\nDuring this time proved a boost for Ruby Ross Brammall, who joined the Professional Woman’s League, along with her mother, Leona and her younger sister, Helen Ross, who can be seen in the rear seats of this 1910 Alco.[11]\n\nIn the 1910-1911 season, Mr. and Mrs. Brammall appeared in support of Lillian Russell, in her starring vehicle, In Search of a Sinner, which toured the medium to large markets in the U.S…[12] Ruby Ross and husband Jack Brammall came to the Lillian Russell play, In Search of a Sinner, by favoritism, resulting from nepotism; Ruby was the niece (on her mother’s side) of Helen Leonard, better known as, Lillian Russell.[13] That is not to say that Ross and Brammall were not deserving of the opportunities afforded them by Russell, for they had put in three years with the Trahern Company, just that the relation with Russell was a leg-up for the young couple.\n\nBrammall On Celluloid:\n\nBrammall got his film debut in the Majestic Motion Picture Company film: The Lighted Candle, which was released in March of 1912. Mr. Brammall made an additional five short films for Majestic in 1912 and The Old Mam’selle’s Secret for Reliance Film Company, released in late ’12. The Kinemacolor Company of America hired director David Miles (also of Majestic who directed Brammall more often than not), was appointed by Kinemacolor to establish two companies in the west at Hollywood in the Kinemacolor Studios and the third he was keen to be in control of, being that this group would film at the Grand Canyon, New Mexico, other areas of Arizona and north to south and east to west of California. Jack Brammall was a member of the cast of actors who worked with Miles[14] on three color films; this company left for the west about the first of October, 1912.[15] The shorts that Brammall was involved in were: Parson Jim’s Baby, Too Many Maids and, The Major’s Story; each of these saw openings in 1913. This trip west for Brammall was a family affair, for his wife Ruby (using her maiden name) was in the company of Kinemacolor actors and their daughter, Leona was one of the, K. K.’s, Kinemacolor Kids;[16] Leona Brammall was just three on this colorful film-making trip. One of the roles that Little Leona played was the part of Pearl, the daughter of Hester Prynne, in the Kinemacolor production of, The Scarlet Letter, 1913.[17] The Brammall family found themselves without work in Los Angeles when Kinemacolor folded operations in June of 1913 and the Brammalls headed east for employment.[18]\n\nHe appeared in numerous shorts from 1912 through 1915, but Mr. Brammall’s interest still lay on the stage. In 1915, he joined with the Bramhall Players, (1915-1918) a theater troupe housed in the Bramhall Playhouse located at 138 E. 27th Street (the corner of Lexington Ave. & 27th Street[19]), in New York. Brammall was appointed to the position of producer with the Bramhall Players, and he would oversee nine plays,[20] all at the Bramhall Playhouse.\n\nWith forty films under his belt, Brammall’s best known roles were in, The Wolf Man, 1914; The Stronger Man and The Bankhurst Victory, 1915, The Missing Links, 1916, The Master Man, 1919, Terror Island, 1920 and The Cheater Reformed, 1921. Brammall was often first billed or within the first four or five names of the actors’ credits; mentioned often in film announcements, and any reviews of his work were almost always positive. During Brammall’s tenure in film, he worked with two soon to be notable names in Hollywood: James Cruze and Tod Browning. He also acted under the direction of durable journeymen: James P. Hogan, William K. Howard, Scott R. Dunlap, Robert Thornby and Henry King. Brammall co-starred with some of the leading-leading-ladies of Tinsel-Town, Lillian Gish, Irene Hunt, Ethel Clayton, Lila Lee and Mae Marsh. And Brammall appeared with some the finest actors of the fledgling celluloid industry: Robert Harron, Allan Sears, F. A. Turner, Johnnie Walker and William Russell.\n\nBrammall Pettifogged:\n\nIn the Majestic Motion Picture Company, one-reeler, The Silent Call, Internet Movie Data Base has Herbert Prior as the, Hotel Clerk, and Brammall as the Traveling Salesman, yet the Motion Picture Story Magazine, reported in consecutive editions (August and September, 1912) that Mr. Prior was the traveling man or drummer, Brammall the clerk and Miss Mabel Trunnelle the switchboard girl, in this drama depicting the trials of a telephone operator in a large hotel and the important part the switchboard plays to the enterprise.[21]\n\nBrammall After Film:\n\nAfter Brammall’s stint in film, he reverted to stage work and eventually became a stage director in New York, but prior to that leg of credits he had roles before the footlights…\n\nThe Ramsey Wallace, 1927 production of, Secret Service Smith, which saw performances in Stamford, CT, Mamaroneck, NY, and Boston, prior to a planned Labor Day opening in New York City, had Brammall in a supporting role.[22] What happened between Boston and Broadway with Secret Service Smith is a mystery, with no opening in Manhattan. Secret Service Smith was written by Lincoln Osborn, adapted from, The Black Magician, one of the Secret Service Smith detective stories by Major R. T. M. Scott.[23] In late 1929, Brammall appeared in, Thunder in the Air, on Broadway, although the play had a short run and it would be another three-and-a-half-years (early 1933) before he would once again tread the boards on the Great White Way.\n\nHis next work beginning in March of 1933 was in Young Sinners, then, June Moon, which ran a month, in May and June of ’33; he also appeared in No More Ladies, in both the January to June 1934 run and in the abbreviated stint in September of ’34. His final work on Broadway was in Living Dangerously, which began on January 12, 1935 and did not see the month out before closing. What other work with the theatre Brammall was associated with from 1930 onward, I can find no trace. His last Federal Census was in 1930, which he listed stage director as his occupation; but what work is the question, since the paper-trail shows he was idle from 1930 through February of 1933? Brammall’s last known address was in Manhattan. There is no record of his death, his ending as enigmatic as his genesis in acting. His wife Ruby Ross, died his widow in 1980; his daughter Leona passed away at the age of 92, just days after her birthday in 2000.\n\nBy C. S.

Her relationship was such with Mr. and Mrs. Edwards that she took the Edwards name professionally, Little Cuddles Edwards; this with full permission from her mother. The song “Look out for Jimmy Valentine is the reason that Augusta Appel, soon to be ‘Little Cuddles’ was discovered. “Jimmy Valentine” was published in October of 1910, and Edwards saw her outside of a theater, and it was not until he got inside and like a flash the idea of this little girl lying on a piano, while “Look out for Jimmy Valentine” was sung, came to him; he asked Miss Lee’s mother for consent, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAll did not remain amenable between the Edwards and the Appel families; an April, 1920, legal battle ensued which lasted two weeks, finally awarding custody of Lila Lee once again to her parents, Charles and Augusta Appel of Chicago;[1] Augusta Cuddles Lila Edwards-Lee-Appel had lived with the Edwards for ten years. A month later, guardianship for Lee was appointed to Chicago attorney Philip Sultan.[2] As we explore the early career of Lila Lee we cannot forget that she was still a child, throughout those formative acting years, she learned the art of celluloid acting on the job.\n\nThe next subject I want to tackle is the Lila Lee conundrum: her age. FPL (Famous Players-Lasky) signed the then sixteen-year-old actress in June of 1918.[3] Yet, her given age to the press was fourteen-years, in 1918,[4] eh, I’m lost? Was she 16 or 14? If 14 then she was born in 1904, but her date of birth on file is 1901 or 1902? Any birth-date earlier than 1903 would have made the custody between the Edwards and Appels moot; we will consider 1901 and 1902 as Ms. Lee attempting to pass herself off as older. In a newspaper article in December of 1912 her age is listed as seven[5] and her discovery by Gus Edwards when she was five? If Lee was five when discovered in 1910, then she was born in 1905? Which would make her? Total confusion! Even her own personal statements (this could be a common trait in Hollywood) make the process of finding her true age difficult. In the 1930 Federal Census, she listed her birth year as 1906; we would continue confused as to her real age excepting that she married James Kirkwood July 25, 1905, on her eighteenth birthday.[6] She was a star from the get-go! Top billing amongst the children on the vaudeville circuit, was the norm. She continued her vaudeville appearances through April of 1918, and then as stated above, Ms. Appel contracted with FPL, no later than the first week of June, 1918;[7] taking the name of Lila Lee.\n\nAt first glance it appears Ms. Lee may have been in the pre-Broadway production of Common Clay (penned by Cleves Kinkead), which played in Atlantic City, in August of 1915,[8] but, it is more reasonable to believe that the actress was Ms. Lela Lee, and not Lila Lee, listed in the trial-run of the Harvard award-winning play; accepting this as a misprint jibes well with the Broadway run of Common Clay where Lela Lee is in the cast. Lela Lee retired from the stage in January of 1916, after marrying Samuel Hoffenstein; the new Mrs. Hoffenstein left the cast of Common Clay, being succeeded by Ruth Boyd.[9]\n\nIn July of 1918 the preparation for her first appearance was laid down, with a nice piece in Film Fun magazine, where The Cruise of the Make-Believes is not called her first movie but One Hundred Per Cent American (a WWI Bond-Campaign film);[10] obviously plans changed for Lee’s role in this Liberty Loan Drive[11] movie, we see not hide nor hair of her in this 1 ½ reel short-patriotic-subject.\n\nWhen taking notice of the advertising afforded Ms. Lee with her film debut, The Cruise of the Make-Believes, in 1918, it is clear that she had name recognition, which translated to a starring role for her first celluloid appearance. Adding to that the Paramount Pictures public-relations department was quick to connect the Little-Cuddles angle in every publicity-release, interview and photo-shoot and in nearly every ad seen; this was especially true, through 1919 (her name appeared over five-hundred times in entertainment magazines and papers, in those two years). Lila Cuddles Lee was remembered fondly when she made her mark in movies, by those that had seen her on stage.[12]\n\nSoon her star began to fade as bad reviews piled high; this became a concern with distributors and exhibitors, once they began looking at the box-office analysis. Their suggestion, to off-set lackluster performances and weak story-lines, was to direct the attention of the potential movie-goer back to Lila Cuddles Lee, reminding the audience of her vaudeville fame.[13] Although the poor reviews were not contained to the film-making industry; there were enough pans and lukewarm notices to damage the rise of the young star, albeit, a manufactured starlet by Paramount Pictures. The common complaint of Lee was that her airy, vivacious stage presence did not translate well on film.\n\nMiss Lee was set to take the lead role in Judy of Rogue’s Harbor, as of December, 1918,[14] further it was reported in April of 1919 that she had wrapped up shooting for Judy of Rogue’s Harbor.[15] Yet the final project was not produced by Paramount and the role was given to Mary Miles Minter;[16] a very perplexing mishmash of events.\n\nWith turns in the Cecil B. DeMille production of Male and Female, 1919, and under the direction of William C. De Mille and James Cruze, with her best work yet to come in 1922 in Blood and Sand (starring Rudolph Valentino, directed by Fred Niblo and Dorothy Arzner), it may have appeared that she at last had found her acting stride, but her contract with Famous Players-Lasky/Paramount was not renewed. Her last film for the company (for which she receives modern credit for; please see Lee miscellany, below for her true final FPL/Paramount flick) was The Ne’er-Do-Well, released in April of 1923. Lee was announced to play in the 1924 release of North of 36,[17] but she did not make the trail to North of 36; FPL canceled the project, (no sooner having announced it), then reversed their decision again in February, 1924, this time with Irvin Willat to direct instead of James Cruze, their original choice for the film.[18]\n\nLila Lee is a most interesting subject, a talented child brought along too quickly, attaining a certain celebrity, without reaching the stars.\n\nLee miscellany\n\nTwo films that are not included in Ms. Lee’s work history are Human Wreckage (produced by the Thomas H. Ince Corporation), 1923, and Pied Piper Malone (for Paramount), 1924.\n\nWith James Kirkwood, Lee married a man more than twice her age, twice divorced, his last divorce-decree coming just a week before the Kirkwood-Lee-nuptials (the grounds for the second Edwards divorce, granted to his wife was ‘other women’).[19] Lee defied her parents, by marrying Kirkwood, whom they opposed and her guardian Philip Sultan, was surprised at the wedding.[20] To add to the strain for Lila Lee, just a month later her husband came close to death, by fracturing his skull, when thrown from a horse.[21] Kirkwood was working on the King Vidor, film, Wild Oranges, and the entirety of the five reels required retakes, with Frank Mayo taking Kirkwood’s role.[22]\n\nLila Lee’s father, Charles Appel, must have been a constant embarrassment for the young lady, while everything at casual observation looked fine (he owned a special events facility in Chicago, Illinois[23]) Mr. Appel was walking the razor’s edge of criminality when at his best, and not only flirted with the wrong side of the law, but took up residence in the dark region; all the while maintaining the persona of a philanthropist.[24]\n\nIn autumn of 1919, Appel admitted that he purchased contraband beer from a Kenosha, Wisconsin, provider.[25] In the summer of 1920 one of Appel’s facilities was broken into and he had four-hundred cases of alcohol stolen; later Chicago Police detectives confiscated the remaining fifty-three cases of Appel’s stock, and began a watch on Appel, his truck and properties. This led them to a new hideout and police were able to apprehend seventy-five more cases of the illegal (prohibition) libation.[26]\n\n1923 saw Appel charged with embezzlement, larceny, and running a confidence game; the indictment totaled approximately $250,000 (of course all charges were denied by the family, and further that Appel would face his accusers [27]). Even the money that Appel made off with was to be used to buy intoxicants, (again reminding us that this was illegal).[28] The initial excuse for the absence of Appel from Chicago was that he went to visit his daughter in California, and would return to Chicago, which he did not; in January of 1924 a reward $500.00 was put out for the return of Appel.[29]\n\nLila Lee so much believed in her father that she had supplied $30,000, in an attempt to preclude action against him.[30] Lee faced accusations that she had funded some of the illegal transactions; she threatened to leave the film-industry altogether if the ‘cloud’ of suspicion was not cleared up immediately by the press, regarding her involvement.[31] The situation worsened when in May of 1924, Lee brought suit against her father and mother, seeking clear title to eight pieces of property in Hollywood.[32]\n\nAppel reportedly left the country in 1924, for Mexico City; [33] finally, he was located in Germany, in October of 1925, and the US State Department requested the German government to return Appel to the United States, as extradition was not possible under the provisions of the treaty between the two countries.[34] Appel died in November of 1935, in Elyria, Ohio; what happened between his stay in Germany and his death, I cannot ascertain.\n\nLila Lee and a non-lengthy Filmography:\n\nThe Secret Garden, 1919\n\nTerror Island, 1920\n\nLove’s Whirlpool, 1924\n\nThe Unholy Three, 1930\n\nThe Ex-Mrs. Bradford, 1936\n\nBy C.

I cannot resist the dynamic-duo of a melodramatic-thriller and the ‘one and the only,’ the ‘Handcuff King’ himself, Harry Houdini! Even with one or two missing reels, this little Paramount Aircraft Picture still crackles with excitement, and is rippled with ingenuity. Terror Island has some brilliant photography and the remarkable submarine scenes, were shot on Catalina Island in November of 1919, five months ahead of the film’s premier date.[1] Location filming for the Island action is described only as “an island in the Pacific ocean.”[2] We do know that filming was not yet complete in January of 1920,[3] and the working title for the production was Salvage.[4]\n\nTerror Island opened at the Rex Theater in Waco, Texas, on Sunday, April 18, 1920, and receiving plaudits from the local paper.[5] This is the earliest mention of a showing that I am able to find. It seems in New York, and San Antonio, Texas, that Terror opened on Sunday, April 25, 1920,[6] while in Chicago, Terror premiered on Tuesday, April 27.[7] At the Sterling Theatre, in Greeley, Colorado, they hosted that city’s grand-opening on Tuesday, April 27, 1920,[8] and in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Terror began on Thursday, April 29, 1920;[9] other cities and venues followed quickly.\n\nAlthough the Internet Movie Database and Library of Congress, Catalogue of Copyright Entries[10] and numerous others, lists the number of reels as seven (the only ad that I know of that listed Terror Island as seven reels is from Australia[11]), yet ads for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Kansas City, Missouri, describe the film as six-reels;[12] an announcement in San Francisco remarks “six reels of thrills, action and suspense.”[13] So which source is more reliable? Usually, I select the contemporary source, but for the running time to be fifty-five minutes you need five-reels. Modern information says that two-reels are lost, if that is so, then it began as a seven-reel picture. Yet, those ads give us compelling evidence that Terror Island started as a six-reel feature, therefore it is down only one reel. Wid’s Daily in its review of Terror Island stated that the production’s length was 5,813 feet[14] and in fact this length is confirmed by the Motion Picture News, more than once, in the publication’s, ‘Advance Information on All Film Releases’ listings.[15]\n\n35 mm film travels at 24 frames per second, 90 feet per minute, which works out to 64.5 minutes; a reel being about 11 minutes… clearly the original running time for Terror Island was around 64 minutes. That leads me to believe the contemporary documentation over today’s theories… Terror Island is missing one reel.\n\nThere are some early references that make the length of Terror Island at five reels,[16] Wid’s Daily (The Film Daily) repeatedly referred to the length of Terror Island in their ‘Current Releases’ section as five reels, yet, the aforementioned review listed it at more than 5,800 feet which of course can only be six reels; very confusing to say the least and most likely we will never know the full truth. One last bit of data, in 1922 Cinéa[17] of France reported the length of Terror Island as 1500 meters, which is 4920 feet, which brings us down to five-reels. It is possible that incongruous, axe like edits were made to this adventure-thriller; in the end it is difficult to believe that announcements and ads, nation-wide over the course of almost two years, are all wrong when it comes to the film’s length.\n\nBelow you will find short biographies of each of the players and those behind the camera.\n\nNow Let Us Proceed to Our Players:\n\nHarry Houdini (Harry Harper), a man that really needs no introduction, so therefore, I will leave off his work as an escape artist, as spiritualist-debunker and focus on his involvement in the film industry. Houdini appeared in just five movies, beginning with The Master Mystery, 1919, and in the same year, The Grim Game. Following Terror Island, 1920, he made The Man from Beyond, 1922 and finished out his celluloid career with Haldane of the Secret Service, 1923. Adding to his résumé, Houdini directed two films, well, no he did not, because the first title listed by the Internet Movie Data Base under Houdini’s directing credits is The Soul of Bronze, 1921, which turns out to be just a re-release of the 1918, French production (Eclair Studios[18]), L’ Ame du bronze, a story not only adapted by Henry Roussel but directed by him as well. The story was written by Georges Le Faure, which was serialized in Paris Matin (a daily newspaper), in eleven-installments, from December 30, 1917 through January 13, 1918.[19] Houdini acquired the rights to L’ Ame du bronze, added new intertitles and distributed it under his name… viola! Just like any sleight of hand, it became Houdini’s. Even the American Film Institute Catalog lists Houdini as a member (the only name mentioned) of the cast, of course this is a ridiculous statement, for that would necessitate Houdini beginning in films a year earlier than what his history tells us, and besides this, the stars of L’ Ame du bronze were Harry Baur and Gaston Rieffler. The aforementioned Haldane, is the second, I mean the only film directed by Houdini. The ‘mystery-man’ himself was also responsible for the story of The Man from Beyond, 1922, which he also served on as executive producer.\n\nJack Brammall, AKA John Bramall, John Bramhall, Jack Brammell, (Tom Starkey) was an English actor, who made quite a mark on Broadway, not only as a performer but as producer as well. His first role on the Great White Way was The Call of the Cricket, 1910; from there Brammall got his debut in the Majestic Motion Picture Company film: The Lighted Candle in 1912. He appeared in numerous shorts from 1912 through 1915, but Mr. Brammall’s interest still lay on the stage. In 1915, he joined with and established the Bramhall Players (1915-1918) a theater troupe housed in the Bramhall Playhouse (corner of Lexington Ave. & 27th Street[20]). Most often Brammall worked behind the scenes as producer, not taking a stage-acting turn again until 1929; he had a total of seven roles on Broadway and was involved in the production of nine plays, all at the Bramhall Playhouse. Regardless which name we look at, Brammall, Bramall, Bramhall, Brammell, this expat of England appeared in nearly forty films, from 1912 to 1921.\n\nLila Lee (Beverly West) was a child star on the vaudeville circuits, under the management of Gus Edwards. FPL (Famous Players-Lasky) signed the then sixteen-year-old actress in June of 1918.[21] Yet, her given age to the press is fourteen-years, in 1918,[22] eh, I’m lost? Was she 16 or 14? If 14 then she was born in 1904, but her date of birth on file is 1901? In a newspaper article in December of 1912 her age is listed as seven[23] and her discovery by Gus Edwards when she was five? The song “Look out for Jimmy Valentine is the reason that Lila Lee, soon to be ‘Little Cuddles’ was discovered. “Jimmy Valentine” was published in October of 1910, and Edwards saw her outside of a theater, and it was not until he got inside and like a flash the idea of this little girl lying on a piano, while “Look out for Jimmy Valentine” was sung, came to him; he asked Miss Lee’s mother for permission, and the rest, as they say, is history. If Lee was five when discovered in 1910, then she was born in 1905? Which would make her? I am totally confused! Let’s just leave it as age undetermined. Whatever Lila Lee’s age, she was a star from the get-go! Top billing amongst the children on the vaudeville circuit, was the norm. Lee was remembered fondly when she made her mark in movies, by those that had seen her on stage.[24]\n\nWilton Taylor (Job Mourdant) made his Broadway debut on August 13, 1898, in the musical comedy, “In Atlantic City,” which had an amazing nine performances before closing; Taylor in the intervening twelve years before his next Broadway appearance, played the vaudeville circuit in New York (many times at Proctor’s Fifty-Eighth Street and Twenty-Third Street Theatres[25]) and in New Jersey. Not being confined to the east-coast, Taylor went to Columbus, Ohio, in 1904 for “The Prodigal Daughter” at the Empire Theatre and in 1912,[26] he also traveled to Chicago when he was cast in “Within the Law,” produced at the Princess Theatre.[27] [28] Mr. Taylor had just four more roles from 1910 through 1914 on Broadway. In February of 1910 we see that Taylor has started his own troupe named Wilton Taylor and Company.[29] From 1914 to 1923 Taylor appeared in 30 movies, with Alias Jimmy Valentine and Treasure Island, both produced in 1920, along with The Cave Girl, 1921 are his most notable of film work.\n\nEd Brady (Captain Black) was one of Hollywood’s most prolific actors making some three-hundred-fifty films in thirty-one years; Brady began in the early days of cinema, in 1911 and lasted throughout the silent era and into the talkies. Brady experienced some sense of popularity and near top-billing status, yet the majority of his work was uncredited or a supporting role in a B-movie. In addition, Brady had one role on Broadway, in “The Spy,” 1913.\n\nFrank Bonner (Chief Bakaida) made only three films: Hawthorne of the U.S.A., 1919, Terror Island, 1920 and Old Ironsides in 1926. He was a west coast actor who worked primarily in the San Francisco-Oakland area; he made his stage debut at Oakland’s Dewey Theater, playing the part of Gheco in “Trilby,” on September 9, 1900.[30] And at the ripe old age of twenty-four, in 1901, he had the privilege of appearing with Maud Miller (daughter of Joaquin Miller) at the San Francisco theatre: Sherman & Clay Hall.[31] In 1905 Bonner was in support to the comedic star, Barney Bernard in “The Financier,” which played for one week at the Grand Opera House in San Francisco.[32] Bonner was with the Central Theatre Stock Company, of the Central Theatre (managed by Ernest Howell), in 1907;[33] in 1911 he was part of the King Dillon Musical Comedy Company, in Stockton, California.[34] He also appeared with the National Theatre Company, which had just been announced as a permanent stock company, at that theatre.[35] 1913 found Bonner with the McKee Rankin Players, seen with that company in “A Kain-tucky Feud.”[36]\n\nApril of 1914 afforded Bonner the opportunity to play with the George Webb Company in the islands of Hawaii for a fourteen-week season.[37] Soon after getting back from Hawaii, the George Webb Company moved ‘lock stock and barrel’ to the Grand Theatre in Sacramento, for an indefinite engagement.[38] Bonner was considered a versatile actor, in the Bay area a ‘Star,’ man of a thousand roles. In 1915 he continued his acting prowess in the cities by the bay.[39] As seen in his travels to Hawaii, Bonner would commit to leaving the San Francisco area for a good opportunity; that is what took him next to Salt Lake City, Utah, a long commitment… May 9, 1917 marked the end of a seventy-seven week run with the Wilkes Players, which were housed at the Wilkes Theatre;[40] Bonner and the Wilkes troupe began their long stint in November of 1915. The spring of 1919 had Mr. Bonner back in California playing in Los Angeles, with Kolb and Dill at the Majestic Theatre.[41]\n\nTaylor N. Duncan, AKA Ted Duncan, (First Officer Murphy) according to the Internet Movie Data Base only had thirteen film roles in thirteen years, but he also appeared in two additional movies, sandwiched between Intolerance and In Mizzoura. The first was with Fannie Ward in Betty to the Rescue, 1917.[42] In Betty to the Rescue (produced by Famous Players-Laksy Corp. and distributed by Paramount Pictures, the director-general was Cecil B. DeMille, while DeMille’s mother, Beatrice DeMIlle wrote the story), Duncan has the pivotal role of ‘Big Jim,’ who helps our heroine along the way by discovering ‘gold in them thar nuggets,’ (sorry about the unneeded description) it was considered one of the big moments of the movie.[43] Later in 1917 (our second film missing from this actor’s profile), Duncan was in The Squaw Man’s Son (considered a lost moving-picture) which starred Wallace Reid, Anita King, Dorothy Davenport and Clarence Geldart; directed by Edward LeSaint, written by Charles Maigne.[44] What a terrific résumé! Yet, if we only named two other titles besides Terror Island, these two movies would be enough for most actors to fuel their self-congratulating conversations for the rest of their lives: Intolerance, 1916 and Tumbleweeds, 1925.\n\nRosemary Theby (Stella Mourdant) was the owner of a long-lived career debuting in 1911’s The Sacrifice, produced by Vitagraph. Theby was shall we say, prolific in silents, particularly during the early silent era. In 1917, after some successful films with husband Harry Myers (often directing their films while with Universal and VIM); in 1931 Myers would play the ‘rich man’ in Charlie Chaplin’s, City Lights). The couple tried their hands at producing; they finished four movies before hanging up the production-hats. The Myers-Theby Comedy Corporation of Yonkers, was incorporated in early March of 1917, capitalized at $100,000; with Mr. F. Seldman of Brooklyn, New York, appointed as one of the directors to the new film corp… Myers-Theby began by making The Delicatessen Mystery, in May of 1917, and followed with Jumping Jealousy, Rusticating and Police Protection, the last title released in June of 1917. Theby had one success after another, but with sound, she and hubby Meyers were relegated to bit parts and uncredited roles.\n\nFred A. Turner (Mr. West) for a further look at Turner please read our post on A Girl of the Timber Claims.\n\nEugene Pallette AKA Eugene Pallett, Gene Pallette, Jean Pallette, (Guy Mourdant) is truly a very interesting, controversial actor from the Golden Age of Hollywood. He was the son of Baird William Pallette, referred to as J. W. or Baird[45] the general-manager of The National life Insurance Company in St. Louis, Missouri,[46] and his mother was Elnora ‘Ella’ Jackson-Pallette. Baird Pallette was able to pass on his love and experience of having lived on a farm, and his time spent as cowboy, and his familiarity with the cattle business[47] to Eugene; Pallette had just one sibling, his older sister Beulah. According to Culver Military Academy (located in Culver, Indiana) Eugene Pallette graduated in 1912, which makes no sense, for Culver is a preparatory school, which would have made Pallette twenty-three when leaving Culver. Culver Academy was a boarding and educational institution, so we may assume that like everyone else Pallette graduated by the time he was eighteen, but that does not jibe with the fact that he was a clothing salesman, hailing from Sedalia, Missouri, in 1906.[48] Since Pallette is listed proudly as alumni of the Culver Military Academy, we may conjecture that he was not expelled; therefore he either left or graduated early.\n\nEugene Pallette made his first appearance on stage in Little Eva (yes, the title role), with his next performance being in East Lynne as Little Willie.[49] In fact in seems that his parents were in a tour of East Lynne, when young Eugene played ‘Little Willie’ in that production;[50] Pallette’s parents being actors is confirmed, according to an article by Robert Grandon.[51] Who’s Who on the Screen had Mr. Pallette’s first stage role in Alias Jimmy Valentine, which was written by Paul Armstrong, 1909 and began its Great White Way run in January of 1910; there is no record that Pallette was cast in the original Broadway production.[52] In 1909-10, Pallette traveled with a stock company to Portland, Oregon, maybe Alias Jimmy Valentine was the play that he went to Portland, Oregon for? Anyway, enough of that conjecture. When the acting troupe went broke in Portland,[53] he paid the bills by working as a streetcar motorman.[54] He acquired the position of motorman by circumventing the crowd of applicants ahead of him, slipping through a side window; the superintendent was impressed by Pallette’s enterprise, and hired him.[55] Trolley veterans who worked with Pallette recounted his solution to slow fares one day, saying that he took his trolley off route to the baseball park, but, even after he picked up more fares, Pallette was still instructed to stay on his own route.[56] His hodgepodge of jobs did not end there, somewhere in between the years-who knows when, and pounds-300 of them, Pallette found time to be a jockey, a circus bareback rider and an aerialist;[57] with twelve years in front of live audiences, [58] Pallette arrived in Hollywood in 1910.[59]\n\nFrom the horse’s mouth is usually the best way to get the correct information or sometimes it may end up being an exaggeration, yet, Pallette claimed that in his first four years in Hollywood, he made one-hundred pictures per annum![60] Of course there is some allusion by Pallette that he was a stunt rider (which fits nicely when remembering his bare-back circus riding days) before he acted. It appears that a goodly amount of his traceable early work in Tinsel-Town is lost; if his start year is 1910, then that is a full three years before our earliest knowledge of any of his film work. Further, a 1932 report claims that Pallette had already worked in 640 motion pictures.[61] Some others have claimed as many as twelve-hundred movies to his credit.[62] These hundreds of extra titles would have to have been walk-ons, crowd-scenes and stunt work, or I would think we would have a little more evidence. And one piece of information that is often forgotten is that Pallette was also a supervisor of productions during his early stint in Hollywood,[63] and he worked with director Tom Ricketts at Universal in 1912;[64] this definitely could have rolled up the stats for young Pallette’s résumé. But with that said, it was in February, 1913 that we saw his official film debut (The Fugitive), at least it will remain official until someone somewhere, turns over a movie-stone and changes film and date.\n\nThere are too many classic films to make mention here. Suffice it to say that Pallette not only may be one of your favorite Hollywood supporting players, he is one of mine, but he was definitely a favorite of many producers, directors and his acting peers.\n\nPallette miscellany Pallette was a close friend of actor-director Raoul Walsh and shared an apartment with the Hollywood legend, somewhere around 1914-15.[65] Once Pallette gained his weight (which began creeping up in the 1920’s), it was constant fodder (pardon the food pun) for the press, nary an article was remiss in making reference to his portly state. In the 1920’s Pallette slowed down his acting assignments and concentrated on black-gold in Texas, gaining a fortune in oil and then losing it all.[66]\n\nOne drawback to this character actor supreme, at least according to Otto Preminger, is that he was a racist, which if true was a sad epitaph for such a talented actor.[67] Yet, still more confusion in the matter was supplied by Jet Magazine, reporting that Pallette was in attendance, at the banquet for Madame Sul-Te-Wan; at that time the oldest living black actress in the world. Sul-Te-Wan and Pallette had both appeared in The Birth of a Nation in 1915 and Intolerance in 1916.[68] Is this a contradiction to Preminger’s statements? Did Jet Magazine bow to the pressure of the Hollywood machine trying to rehabilitate Pallette or was this a ‘wink and nod’ from Jet to let everyone in Hollywood know that they knew the truth? Or, yet again, was this the real Pallette?\n\nIn 1937, as though Oregon was calling, Pallette begin to make regular journeys to the Beaver state beginning to acquire small parcels of land that would eventually add up to around thirty-five hundred acres. By those outside of Wallow County, Oregon, the retreat was labeled a compound, a fortress, but for those who knew Pallette, it was his home; a self-sustaining community was his goal.[69] To that end he developed (his retreat was located in the wilderness, in the eastern part of the state, along the Imnaha River)[70] the property with a ranch-house (constructed next to an old post-office), bombproof underground installations, a saw-mill, a gas station and he built a slaughter-house. He had bunk houses, a central kitchen and a mess-hall. Machine shops, stables, a cannery, water works were added to the mix and a 60×90 foot concrete warehouse to handle all of the foodstuffs.[71] Pallette ventured back to Hollywood in 1949,[72] (the world having not been blown-up, as he anticipated[73]) and according to some reports he sold the Oregon ranch in 1951; it included three-hundred head of cattle, and the foodstuffs in the sale.[74] But, in one obit, it makes mention that a 3,500 acre ranch in Oregon, was not affected by the probate proceedings.[75] Much of the preceding information was related by Claude Hall, in 1977. Mr. Hall was a retired Wallowa County, Oregon, judge and had been a former partner in the Pallette Ranch.\n\nNow We Ensue to the Crew of Terror Island\n\nJames Cruze (director) directed more than seventy movies, working well into the sound era. Cruze made just one short-film (From Wash to Washington, 1914) and then promptly moved on to feature-length pictures. His is a varied profile with over one-hundred acting credits (1911-1923), producing thirty-four films, and writing for two movies.\n\nWilliam Marshall (cinematography) photographed nearly seventy films; probably his best know work was for The Sheik, 1921, starring Rudolph Valentino. His career lasted just sixteen-years.\n\nWilfred Buckland (art director) was a busy man, handling the art direction duties more than eighty times in thirteen years; while only working on one short-subject (The Unafraid, 1915). Once he multi-tasked and added the title of production designer, with The Roaring Road, in 1919. All told, Buckland oversaw the production design in eleven projects.\n\nArthur B. Reeve (co-wrote the story) was by talent and trade, a novelist and short-story weaver, his first work writing directly for the screen was The Hidden Hand, 1917; in total Reeve penned or co-penned a dozen stories and scenarios. But he buttered his bread by the printed word; his most famous and lasting work was that of the eighty-two Craig Kennedy stories and the various adventures of Elaine which involved Professor Craig Kennedy, which stories make up the bulk of his written works adapted for the silver-screen, beginning with: The Exploits of Elaine, 1914, The New Exploits of Elaine, 1915, The Romance of Elaine, 1915, and then in 1936, The Amazing Exploits of the Clutching Hand, again with his most recognizable character Craig Kennedy.\n\nJohn Grey (co-wrote the story) had writing assignments on more than one-hundred movies; he worked well beyond the silent era, with his last feature-film being Swingin’ on a Rainbow, 1945. Grey finished his career writing a few episodes for Television (Sky King, 1958-1959, The Texan, 1960, and The Littlest Hobo, 1963). Both Grey and Arthur Reeve are missing a writing credit in their résumés: $1,000,000.00Reward, starring Lillian Walker, released in January of 1920.[76]\n\nCullen ‘Hezi or Hessie’ Tate (assistant-director) may not be easy to distinguish from the thousands of film making personnel, from a hundred years ago, but to Hollywood in that era he was highly recognizable. A shock of red hair, a man of humor, and an a highly opinionated assistant-director; while some in authority want a ‘yes-man’ Tate fit perfectly with Cecil B. DeMille, who wanted anything but an obsequious AD. Tate makes for one of the most interesting résumés in Hollywood history. As we look back upon the career of Cullen Tate there are a good number of non-listed credits as well as listed (whether named-uncredited or credited). Tate made a career of being the assistant-director or the second-unit-director; most of his work in sound films went uncredited. Two films catch the eye as outstanding; he worked (assistant-director) with Cecil B. DeMille on The Ten Commandments, 1923, and The Man in the Iron Mask, 1939 as the second-unit-director, with James Whale.\n\nIn addition to the thirty or more movies as ‘AD’ or ‘SUD,’ Tate also directed four films: Try and Get It, and Cheap Kisses, both released in 1924, The Carnival Girl, 1926 and his co-directing in My Heart Belongs to Daddy, 1942, went uncredited. And I do not want to neglect mentioning that Tate was a favorite of DeMille, assisting the master on both silent and sound projects. His specialty was properties, scouting for location shoots;[77] often, Tate handled mob or large crowd scenes for DeMille and other directors.[78]\n\nA perfect example of Tate’s normal duties was when for Manslaughter, 1922, he visited the women’s prison in Auburn, New York, and the Manhattan Detention Complex; while there Tate shot footage, gathered details on apparel, and other prison paraphernalia.[79] During his stay in New York he sat in on an actual manslaughter trial, from beginning to end; he obtained copies of the official documents, from the indictment to the commitment to prison.[80]\n\nThere are projects that Tate not only goes uncredited for, but some films are not listed in his work-history, the type which we see commonly (IMDB is a primary source for all of us cinephiles) on the internet. Here is the roll of Tate’s overlooked films that I have complied thus far: Joan the Woman, 1916, A Romance of the Redwoods, 1917, The Woman God Forgot, 1917,[81] What Happened to Jones, 1920,[82] The Affairs of Anatol, 1921,[83] Adam’s Rib, 1923,[84] The Dark Angel, 1925,[85] The Barker, 1928,[86] His Captive Woman, 1929,[87] The Crusades, 1935,[88] Virginia, 1942 (second-unit-director),[89] Tate again in each of these films was the assistant-director unless otherwise noted.\n\nTate miscellany: He sat in the director’s chair (at least as co-director) for The Follies Girl, 1924, AKA The Chorus Lady, starring Margaret Livingstone, but it was Ralph Ince that received the credit.[90] Tate was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Assistant Director, for Cleopatra, 1934. ‘Hezi’ Tate was the first person to fill the new industry position of short-wave-tech, for Captains Courageous, 1937.[91]\n\nWalter Woods (adapted Terror Island for the screen) when he came to films 1915, he was already an accomplished playwright, theater-manager, and basic all around ‘jack-of-all-trades.’ Woods had spent extensive time not only in the entertainment field but in journalism as well. In 1903 Woods finished his four act play, “Billy the Kid,” under the pseudonym of Walwin Woods. Evidently Woods could not get the play produced, since I have found no evidence to the contrary. In 1906 he partnered with Joseph Santley, the pair reworking or polishing “Billy the Kid,” although retaining all four acts of the comedy drama; this version went on to open on Broadway (with Santley appearing as Billy), on August 13, 1906.[92] Billy the Kid went on tour and received a glowing review in Syracuse, New York.[93] And in August LeRoy Sumner took over the role of Billy and by all reports the part fit the actor well, playing in Lebanon and Harrisburg Pennsylvania.[94] The traveling production continued on, making stops in Greenville, Pennsylvania, East Liverpool, Ohio,[95] and Monongahela, Pennsylvania; usually playing for one or two nights. Billy the Kid toured Illinois, Michigan and Ohio through January of 1908.\n\nIn 1907 Woods finished “Girl of Eagle Ranch,” (a melodrama), and made the production available on September 16, 1907. [96] The western opened in Philadelphia at Hart’s Kensington Theatre on September 23, 1907.[97] Girl of Eagle Ranch on the Great White Way premiered on October 21, 1907.[98] While the Internet Broadway Date Base does not provide a cast list, I was able (no small feat of research) to obtain it and include it for your perusal… enjoy![99]\n\nWe know that Girl of Eagle Ranch, did not last long on Broadway, for it was already on tour in Cincinnati, Ohio, in December of 1907, at Heuck’s Opera House,[100] and from there the production moved on to Indiana.[101]\n\nWoods was not above writing for vaudeville,[102] wherever he could sell a story, his profile seems to relate to us; the Dudleys would use his sketch “A Fish Story” for their show (1907-1908 season), on the Keith & Proctor circuit.\n\nFebruary of 1910 saw Walter Woods take the duties of editor and manager of the Copan Enterprise, Copan, Oklahoma,[103] and his new play, The Reformer (a political drama), co-written with Benjamin J. Leger was being presented at the Cumings Theater, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, produced by the Leigh De Lacy (Mrs. Woods) Company.[104]\n\nWoods miscellany: In 1904 Mr. Woods wrote and copyrighted another four act play, a melodrama entitled: The Chicago Bay Bandits.[105] He was seen on stage in summer stock with the Fenberg Stock Company, in 1905;[106] he was considered a leading member of the acting group. In 1911 Woods became the manager of the Olympic Theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio; Walter Woods was evaluated as a man of extended experience in managing stock and other theaters.[107] Much of Woods well known managing acumen was gathered from the facts that he co-managed (with Monte Thompson) his wife’s company (Leigh De Lacy) for eight years.[108] Walter Woods was the managing partner of the Walter Woods-Monte Thompson Players; the group had offices in Brockton, Massachusetts.[109] The company worked in stock seasons, as far north as St. John, New Brunswick, Canada.[110]\n\nSide-Note:\n\nIn autumn of 1919, John Grey, Arthur Reeve, Harry Houdini, H. Sumnich and Louis Grossman decided to form a new motion picture production company with Grey installed as president and Reeve as vice-president;[111] the company’s purpose was to rehab the serial genre.[112] The studios were located at Flushing, Long Island, New York.[113] The young company had a contract with Goldwyn, indeed, it is stated that the purpose of forming Supreme Pictures was to produce four Craig Kennedy pictures a year, over an undetermined number of years; what happened to stall that deal?[114] And what happened to the purpose? It is most likely not one impetus, but many that drove the group to establish Supreme Pictures.\n\nYet, the genesis may be found (at least Reeve’s reason) in Arthur Reeve’s attack on Democratic Senator Thomas Gore (grandfather of Gore Vidal, and a distant relative of Al Gore) of Oklahoma and his bill; Gore had introduced legislation to prohibit Interstate transportation of “blood and thunder” films or still pictures. Reeve was impassioned regarding the subject, and he deftly argued his points, simultaneously defending thrills in general, making mention that if Gore’s bill succeeded it would create a “namby pamby world.”[115]\n\nBut the Supreme Pictures Corporation lasted but one project and was done by the following year. The Mystery Mind, released in November of 1920, was the sole serial and only title for the company. Grey and Reeve collaborated on the writing (not uncommon for this pair), as well as acting as the producers of the fifteen-chapter photo-play[116]. Houdini was not involved in the making of the picture, and of course Grossman being the financial expert, took care of the business end.\n\nBy C. S.
