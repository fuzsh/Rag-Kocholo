This post is part of the James Stewart Blogathon hosted by the Classic Film & TV Cafe. You can view the complete blogathon schedule here.\n\nThe screen credit always read James Stewart, yet the people in the audience always called the actor \"Jimmy\". Jimmy was like an old pal they had watched for years, first angling for his spot in Hollywood at MGM then speaking for what is good in all of us with his Oscar-nominated performance in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Then there was the war, where Jimmy the flyer was an instructor and flew combat missions in Europe, become a Colonel by the end. When he retired from the Air Force Reserve in 1959 he was a brigadier general. After the war, like other actors, and directors like Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life), Jimmy took control of his own career.\n\nJimmy Stewart's film career in the 1950s is a model of versatility and success that any actor would be proud to claim. In 1950 he played Elwood P. Dowd in the screen version of Mary Chase's Pulitzer Prize winning play Harvey and found a role he could return to in future on the stage. At the end of the decade he was Oscar-nominated for the Otto Preminger directed courtroom drama Anatomy of a Murder. In between there were three biographies, The Stratton Story and The Glenn Miller Story, both co-starring June Allyson and The Spirit of St. Louis. His collaboration with Hitchcock which began with 1948s Rope, continued with Rear Window, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. There were thrillers, romance, dramas, and he even got to be a clown in The Greatest Show on Earth. Best of all there were westerns. Jimmy Stewart made eight films with director Anthony Mann and five of them are among the best westerns of the 1950s, Winchester '73, The Naked Spur, The Far Country, The Man from Laramie, and Bend of the River.\n\nBend of the River is my movie. We all have one. The movie we reach for when a cold is coming on. Not the flu or anything major, but a cold that entitles you to pampering while foregoing a trip to the ER. You snuggle on the couch under a mound of blankets with tissue at your side while obliging family members bring you classes of water, cups of soup and toast with the crusts cut off. You watch the movie that comforts you right down to your fluffy slippers. Life is good.\n\n\"How many bad guys have to bite the dust before you are comforted?\"\n\n- Janet Hall, concerned daughter\n\nScreenwriter Bordon Chase had been working in Hollywood since his first novel Sand Hog was adapted for Raoul Walsh's 1935 film Under Pressure. Mysteries, war pictures and westerns make up the bulk of Chase's work, with his westerns being true classics of the genre such as Red River, Man Without a Star, Winchester '73 and The Man from Colorado. I find his best films to be emotionally epic, and this is how Bend of the River, adapted from William Gulick's novel Bend of the Snake, struck me when I first saw it over 40 years ago, and strikes me again on my many re-watches.\n\nJulie Adams, James Stewart\n\nJimmy Stewart plays Glyn McLyntock, leader of a wagon train taking settlers to the Oregon territory. Glyn has a past as a border raider during the Civil War, a past he wants to forget. He's hoping to have a new beginning with these brave settlers, particularly with lovely Julie Adams playing Laura Baile. On a scouting expedition Glyn saves the life of Emerson Cole played by Arthur Kennedy. Cole has angered some vigilantes and he and Glyn recognize each other for the bad men they have been. Cole is willing to string along with the wagon train until something better turns up or Laura Baile casts an eye in his direction. Cole knows he owes Glyn, but his allegiance is strictly self-serving.\n\nThe settlers led by Jay C. Flippen as Jeremy Baile, father of Laura and younger sister Marjie played by Lori Nelson, are greeted warmly in Portland purchasing the supplies which will carry them through the winter. Merchant Tom Hendricks played by Howard Petrie will see that the supplies are shipped in time. The approaching winter causes concern when the supplies have not arrived as promised so Glyn and Jeremy return to Portland to check on their stock and on Laura. Laura had been wounded in an Indian attack and had been recuperating in Portland.\n\nRock Hudson, Arthur Kennedy, James Stewart\n\nThe intervening months had seen a gold strike and the countryside was filling up with optimistic miners who needed supplies and were willing to pay much more than top dollar. Hendricks is holding back the settler's necessaries for all the money he can get. Meanwhile, Emerson Cole is running a gambler's paradise with Laura and with a handsome young gunman named Trey Wilson played by Rock Hudson. This was a breakout role for Rock who proved himself an appealing screen personality. Glyn hires some men at the dock to load the settler's goods on a paddle wheel run by Cap'n Mello played by Chubby Johnson and Adam played by Stepin Fetchit. It is a messy situation and Glyn can't get away cleanly as they are followed up river by Hendricks and a gang.\n\nArthur Kennedy, Harry Morgan, Royal Dano\n\nGlyn counts Cole and Trey as his partners in the dangerous enterprise, but the men who were basically shanghaied from the dock are not satisfied with the situation. Jack Lambert, Harry Morgan and Royal Dano are among the crew who decide to turn on Glyn, hijack the goods and sell them to the miners. As masterminds, they fall a little short of their scheme, but Emerson Cole is ahead of them and were it not for Laura's presence, Glyn would be dead. Instead, he is left to die in the wilderness.\n\nJames Stewart as Glyn McLyntock\n\n\"You'll be seeing me. You'll be seeing me. Everytime you bed down for the night, you'll look back to the darkness and wonder if I'm there. And some night, I will be. You'll be seeing me!\"\n\nThe twists and turns of Glyn's redemption make for riveting viewing. Bend of the River was the second Jimmy Stewart-Anthony Mann western following Winchester '73. It was filmed in gorgeous Technicolor by cinematographer Irving Glassberg and has an appropriate stirring score by six time Oscar nominee Hans Salter. Location filming in Oregon lends a sense of the treachery of the land and of the people. You can feel the crisp breeze, the mundane hazards of rocks and mud, and be awestruck by the vistas of rivers and mountains.\n\nA perilous journey.\n\nThe story of Bend of the River is compelling and filled with action. Glyn's search for a new life is heartbreakingly convincing in the hands of Jimmy Stewart, who was giving the public a look at the new post-war actor, a man of darker shades. Arthur Kennedy is a charming skunk as Emerson Cole. Whether he is playing a sweetheart or a villain, he is an actor that it is impossible to ignore.\n\nChubby Johnson's long screen career in movies and on TV was just beginning. Oldtimer J.C. Flippen still had some interesting roles to play, even into the 60s. Until a couple of late life roles in the 70s in a Moms Mabley comedy and Won Ton Ton the Dog Who Saved Hollywood, this year would mark the end of the movie road for Stepin Fetchit. His role in Bend of the River did not rely on much of the traditional comic schtick for which he is most remembered. Rock Hudson staked his claim in the star lottery. In future years, certain cast members would become famous for TV roles, Harry Morgan for December Bride, Pete and Gladys, Dragnet and M*A*S*H, and Frances Bavier for The Andy Griffith Show. In the 1970s Julie Adams would play Jimmy Stewart's wife in The Jimmy Stewart Show, but for now it was 1952. The 1950s, Jimmy's decade, was just beginning.\n\n↧\n\nThe Great Villain Blogathon: The Spider Woman\n\nSomething scary is happening. Speakeasy, Shadows and Satin and Silver Screenings have pooled their considerable talents to bring us The Great Villain Blogathon, running April 20th to 26th.\n\nBasil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce first embodied Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson for Twentieth Century Fox in 1939s The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The Victorian-era tales were well made and popular, but a series idea did not continue past those two excellent movies. In 1942 Universal took up the mantle with Rathbone and Bruce, updating the pair to a contemporary setting with the majority of the films directed by Roy William Neill. Holmes was free to pursue various nefarious villains from Professor Moriarty to Nazis. In 1944 Holmes was pitted against one of the most fiendish of them all - The Spider Woman!\n\nGale Sondergaard, Basil Rathbone\n\nHolmes: I suspect a woman.\n\nWatson: A woman? You amaze me, Holmes. Why a woman?\n\nHolmes: Because the method, whatever it is, is peculiarly subtle and cruel. Feline, not canine.\n\nWell, if that's not a ringing endorsement, I don't know what is.\n\nLondon newspapers are full of reports of mysterious deaths known as \"pajama suicides\". Eminent men of means retire for the evening and, with no apparent cause, leap to their deaths. What is behind it all? Only one man can solve the puzzle, but that one man is dead. While on a fishing vacation in Scotland, Sherlock Holmes falls to his death leaving behind a baffled constabulary and a bereft John Watson. Of course, we know he's an old faker. Holmes wouldn't go and die on us. He wants to lull the criminal element behind the \"pajama suicides\" into a false sense of security. A disguised Holmes will follow up on his one lead by placing himself in harm's way. Holmes, in his everlasting confidence, does not fear the \"female Moriarty\" of crime.\n\nDennis Hoey, Basil Rathbone\n\nGale Sondergaard stars as Adrea Spedding, the Spider Woman. Ms. Spedding has quite the lucrative racket. Through the auspices of a gaming establishment she induces the eminent men of means to sign over their insurance policies and then on a luckless night frightens them into causing their own deaths to escape the lycosa carnivora, the deadliest insect known to science. Creepy and effective.\n\nIt is a deadly game of cat and mouse between Holmes and the Spider Woman. They see through each others disguises and ploys easily, and their enjoyment in the game is as great as ours is in watching the sparring. Holmes comes very close to underestimating his adversary in this adventure. Adrea Spedding is a brilliant manipulator and exceedingly clever. She controls her organization with an uncanny ability to anticipate her enemy's moves and an easy access to her dark side. A mad scientist, an annoying child, and an arcade shooting gallery all figure in the match-up between the two masterminds, which gives us one of the most entertaining entries in the Universal Holmes series.\n\nVernon Downing, Basil Rathbone, Alec Craig, Gale Sondergaard\n\nHolmes aficionados will have fun looking for nods to The Adventure of the Final Problem, The Sign of Four, The Adventure of the Speckled Band, The Adventure of the Devil's Foot and The Adventure of the Empty House in Bertram Millhauser's screenplay.\n\nGale Sondergaard\n\n(1898 - 1985)\n\nWhen stage actress Gale Sondergaard came to Hollywood in the 1930s it was for her husband, writer/director Herbert Biberman's career. However, it was Gale's screen career that started off brilliantly when Mervyn LeRoy cast her in the 1936 epic Anthony Adverse. Her peers saw something in her portrayal of the manipulative and avaricious Faith that moved them to nominate her for a Best Supporting Actress Award in the first year of that category. For her first film Gale was the first winner of the, at the time, plaque. Less than two decades later her peers would not be so kind when Herbert Biberman was jailed as one of the Hollywood Ten and Gale was blacklisted. Her last movie role for many years before the blacklisting set in was as Barbara Stanwyck sympathetic mother in Mervyn LeRoy's East Side, West Side.\n\nGale Sondergaard was an actress of versatility and intelligence who could and did play a variety of roles, including the mysterious Mrs. Hammond in The Letter, Lady Thiang in Anna and the King of Siam (another Oscar nomination) and the possessive Mrs. Manette in Christmas Holiday. It is for the classy relish she brought to her villains for which Gale Sondergaard is best remembered. Whether played in earnest or played for laughs her presence is as welcome and comforting as any on the screen. You know what you are getting when Gale shows up in The Cat and the Canary, The Road to Rio or The Time of Their Lives as surely as when you are watching The Mark of Zorro and The Spider Woman. In the 1970s, Gale Sondergaard returned to our screens with guest spots on television programs including Get Smart, Rod Serling's Night Gallery, the mini-series Centennial and the daytime drama Ryan's Hope.\n\nOnce a Spider Woman, always a Spider Woman. Originally a freelance actress, during the 1940s Gale Sondergaard signed with Universal who capitalized on her appearance in the Holmes series by again presenting her as the \"Spider Woman\". However, in the 1946 film The Spider Woman Strikes Back she plays a different character named Zenobia Dollard. Ms. Dollard is even more mad than Ms. Spedding. Does anyone else feel a chill?\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for May on TCM\n\nThe May spotlight is doing double duty as my annual birthday salute to Bing Crosby.\n\nWhat is better than a \"Road to\" movie? How about a \"Road to\" movie in Technicolor. 1953s Road to Bali is the only \"Road to\" movie filmed in colour and is the last of what I would call the official \"Road to\" pictures. The code I live by does not accept 1960s The Road to Hong Kong as Dorothy Lamour is not the leading lady.\n\nThe first of the Crosby - Hope - Lamour comedies, 1940s Road to Singapore had a checkered history having been conceived as a vehicle for George Burns and Gracie Allen then refashioned into a buddy picture for Fred MacMurray and Jack Oakie. The timing didn't work out for that duo to play the playboy and his pal who stir up comic misadventures in the south seas. Bing Crosby and Bob Hope ended up singing Johnny Burke, James Monaco and director Victor Schertzinger songs to a saronged Dorothy Lamour. The movies slight plot was bolstered by the music, a faux-exotic locale and the breezy camaraderie of the newly installed leads. Paramount found themselves with an unexpected hit.\n\nBing and Bob had first met in NYC in 1932 when Bob was emceeing at the Capital Theater where Bing had a week long engagement. Sharing a love of fun and repartee, the two hit if off and worked up routines to enliven the show. Years later in Hollywood, between their writers and their individual wits, the future entries in their movie series took off in wild flights of fancy and fun, for the participants and for the audience. The followups, all with songs by Johnny Burke and Jimmy Van Huesen, are 1941s Road to Zanzibar, 1942s Road to Morocco, 1945s Road to Utopia, 1947s Road to Rio, 1952s Road to Bali (and the other one).\n\nDorothy Lamour, Bing Crosby\n\nThe idea in all these movies is that Bing and Bob are shiftless entertainers usually on the run from the law and/or shotgun armed fathers of voluptuous daughters. Along the way there would be evil-doers (Anthony Quinn, Douglas Dumrille, Jack LaRue, etc.) and Dorothy Lamour as a damsel in distress who loves both of them but usually ends up with Bing. Songs in the series would become standards such as Moonlight Becomes You, Personality and But Beautiful. Ensuing hijinks include contemporary political humour, inside jokes, breaking the fourth wall, talking animals and Robert Benchley.\n\nBob Hope, Dorothy Lamour\n\nIn Road to Bali (they never do get there) the boys are broke in Melbourne and on the run from a couple of dolls. One of them is 22-year-old Carolyn Jones! They end up as deep sea divers aka giant squid bait retrieving sunken treasure. A half Scottish Island princess gives the boys an excuse to wear kilts for a novelty tune,Hoot Mon. The princess has an evil cousin played by Mervyn Vye (Golden Earrings, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court). A widowed gorilla falls for the boys. Bob, Bing and Dorothy sing a lively The Merry Go Run Around. Oh - and there's a volcano. All of this happens with non-stop one-up-mans-ship in the form of quips, asides and some of the corniest sight gags, sound gags and celebrity cameos you have ever seen in one movie. It cracks me up!\n\nTCM is showing Road to Bali on Friday, May 2nd at 10:45 am. It is part of a morning of Bing Crosby films to commemorate his birthday. The lineup is Going Hollywood, Road to Bali, High Society and Man on Fire.\n\n↧\n\nThe Romantic Comedy Blogathon: Footlight Serenade (1942)\n\nA Boy. A Girl. A Boxer. On Broadway!\n\nThe Boy: Bill Smith came to the big town to make his mark, but the only success he's met with has been the romantic time. However, he is willing to temporarily leave his girl behind looking for a new start. She convinces him to stop by a theatre where she is auditioning for one last goodbye. He'll be staying put!\n\nJohn Payne plays Bill. The former Warners contractee had been with Twentieth Century Fox for two years at this point and had proven himself with his good looks, fine voice and easy chemistry with leading ladies. Tin Pan Alley, Week-End in Havana and The Great American Broadcast with Alice Faye, Sun Valley Serenade with Sonja Henie and To the Shores of Tripoli with Maureen O'Hara (they would meet up later with a fella called Kris) were solid hits.\n\nThe Girl: Pat Lambert is like hundreds of dancers looking for work on Broadway. The big difference is she has Bill in her corner. Pat's talent and personality also catch the eye of the Boxer. Well, a job is a job and a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do!\n\nBetty Grable plays Pat. The bubbly and talented Grable had been around Hollywood for ten years in small, but showy parts. It took a role on Broadway in Cole Porter's Du Barry Was a Lady to bring her back to Tinseltown where she would become one of the most popular performers of the 1940s. Down Argentine Way was the colourful Fox musical co-starring Don Ameche would really put her on the map.\n\nThe Boxer: Tommy Lundy is the champ. The ladies love him almost as much as he loves himself. He can't sing and he can't dance and he can't act, but that won't stop him from starring in a Broadway show. After all, the ladies love him!\n\nVictor Mature plays Tommy. The physically imposing actor self-deprecatingly maligned his own talents to go along with the critical catcalls. However, he was a trained professional whose performances in such films as My Darling Clementine, Kiss of Death, Cry of the City and I Wake Up Screaming belie his \"not an actor\" reputation. The larger-than-life, exuberant and extremely confident Tommy is a particularly fun characterization.\n\nOn Broadway!: Phil Silvers as the comic \"Slap\" convinces producer Bruce McKay played by James Gleason that a show starring the ring's latest heartthrob will be a surefire hit. A hit, he wants. What he gets is ulcers when the swell-headed Tommy takes over. Tommy's not malicious, it's just that he's always right so why shouldn't people do what he says? He wants someone to box in the last act and Bill seems like the right guy, so he gets Bill. He thinks Pat is darn cute, and she sure can dance, so he gets Pat in the show.\n\nBetty Grable, Jane Wyman\n\nAlso along for the fun is Pat's best friend Flo played by Jane Wyman. I don't know why this Warner Brothers gal was at Fox for one picture in 1942, but I know what she was doing. She was doing the Eve Arden bit, that of sardonic best friend, and she nails it. Flo sees nothing but trouble in the cards for Pat. \"You have as much chance of going on as I have of becoming First Lady!\"\n\nThe supporting cast is a movie buffs delight featuring Irving Bacon, Mantan Moreland and Frank Orth. Tommy's current girlfriend, society singer Estelle Evans played by society singer Cobina Wright, is not right for a Broadway show so naturally Tommy wants her for his leading lady. Miss Evans is immediately jealous of the attention Tommy pays Pat. There's a lot of that going around. Bill isn't too pleased either. Pat uses this to her advantage. Some guys have to be dragged to the altar or municipal city hall. Love is in the air, but has to be kept a secret until opening night as everyone is afraid of upsetting Tommy before the show is declared a hit, Pat becomes a star and the money starts rolling in.\n\nThe director of Footlight Serenade is Gregory Ratoff (Intermezzo: A Love Story, Rose of Washington Square, The Corsican Brothers), Max Fabian of All About Eve fame. He gives us a nicely paced show and some memorable tracking shots through the backstage areas of our Broadway theatre setting. The cinematography is by Lee Garmes (Scarface, The Furies, A Big Hand for the Little Lady) who would also produce and direct in his Hollywood career.\n\nI like my romantic comedies with generous helpings of music. Cupid's arrow is often greatly helped by the right love song or a passionate dance. Hollywood obliged with many great examples starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at RKO, Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald at MGM, and Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler at Warner Brothers. The Great American Songbook is filled with movie standards from Irving Berlin, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer, Harry Warren and others.\n\nSongs for Footlight Serenade were composed by Oscar winners (Thanks for the Memory) Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin. The tunes are peppy and humourous befitting this lively story, and the dance routines are fun and polished. Choreography is by Hermes Pan (Top Hat, Swing Time, Silk Stockings) who plays a dance director in the movie and performs Land on Your Feet with Betty. The shadow boxing number I Heard the Birdies Sing is a very nice showcase for Betty. The number I'm Still Crazy for You shows why Bill and Pat are perfect for each other.\n\nJohn Payne, Betty Grable, Victor Mature\n\nBetty Grable has a very appealing screen personality. She's attractive and energetic. She knows what she wants and goes after it. She doesn't suffer fools lightly. She's a gal that can take care of herself. John Payne is one of those performers who always seems just right in whatever he is doing, a musical-comedy, a film-noir or a western. He makes it look easy.\n\nYou know going into a romantic comedy what the ending will be. The story told must entertain and amuse. The actors must be personable and professionally committed to putting over the script. There has to be a lot of confusion and misunderstanding before that final clinch or production number, and the audience has to enjoy the ride. Footlight Serenade is one enjoyable ride.\n\nLara of Backlots and Vince of Carole & Co. have brought love to the blogosphere with The Romantic Comedy Blogathon running from May 1 - 4.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCMBA Fabulous Films of the 50s blogathon: Champagne for Caesar (1950)\n\nThe Classic Movie Blog Association sponsors the Fabulous Films of the 50s blogathon from May 22 to May 26. So many great movies and so many great posts.\n\nRonald Colman stars as Beauregard Bottomley, the last scholar, in the delightful 1950 comedy Champagne for Caesar. As always, Colman is perfect in his role. He was a perfect Sidney Carton, a perfect Robert Conway, a perfect George Apley, a perfect Rudolf Rassendyll, etc. Beauregard Bottomley is a head-in-the-clouds and rather naive sort of fellow who devotes his time to higher learning and Greek translations, which doesn't pay very well. He lives in a friendly bungalow court with his younger sister Gwenn, a piano teacher played by pretty Barbara Britton (The Virginian, I Shot Jesse James, TVs Mr. and Mrs. North). The abode is also shared by a parrot named Caesar. Caesar's former owner taught him a number of colourful phrases and encouraged a taste for the grape. Caesar is voiced by Mel Blanc.\n\nA stroll on a pleasant, warm evening to join others gathered in front of a storefront to watch television will irrevocably change not only the lives of the Bottomley siblings, but of the nation! Beauregard is anxious to watch the broadcast of a scientific experiment and is prepared to return home at its conclusion when the popular radio/TV hit \"Masquerade for Money\" hosted by \"Happy\" Hogan begins. This is the program which has drawn the rest of the crowd and Gwenn wants to check it out. Perennial host Art Linkletter is cast as \"Happy\" and does a credible job. Certainly he is on his mettle as a TV host and handles his \"off\" scenes well. The premise of \"Masquerade for Money\" is that the contestant dresses up as someone or something and is asked questions about their assumed identity. The first correct answer is a $5 win and the money increases to the top prize of $160. The program is the brainchild of and sponsored by Milady's Soap (\"the soap that sanctifies\"). Milady's Soap is run by Burnbridge Waters. In Vincent Price's mad and hysterical performance as the mastermind you will see the genesis for his Professor Ratigan from The Great Mouse Detective, 35 years in the future.\n\nBeauregard is appalled by what he sees on the television. \"This man is the forerunner of intellectual destruction in America. If it is noteworthy and rewarding to know that 2 and 2 make 4 to the accompaniment of deafening applause and prizes then 2 and 2 making 4 will become the top level of learning.\" Gwenn, on the other hand, thinks \"Happy\" is cute.\n\nBeauregard's ongoing efforts to find meaningful employment are a problem for both himself and Mr. Brown of the Department of Employment. \"If you know everything, you're not wanted around for long.\" Perhaps at long last they have found the way Beauregard can \"make a buck\" and he eagerly attends for an interview at a firm that is looking for someone to do something with a research survey. The company is Milady's Soap (\"the soap that sanctifies\") which is housed in an office complex that looks as if Dr. Seuss was hired as interior designer. There is a hushed atmosphere, an obelisk with disembodied arms holding soap, disembodied voices greet and offer commands and eventually Beauregard is ushered in to see the top man. Burnbridge Waters is currently in a trance. It's how he thinks up things like \"Masquerade for Money\". Coming out of the trance, he questions the applicant and finds Beauregard Bottomley not to his liking. \"You are the intellectual type. I despise intellectuals types.\" Beauregard's attempts at injecting humour into the interview are also met with strong disapproval and insults. Beauregard does not take the rejection from the \"pompous ass\" lightly.\n\nArt Linkletter, Ronald Colman\n\nBeauregard enters \"Masquerade for Money\" as the Encyclopedia Britannica. His appearance causes a sensation. The audience cannot get enough of the \"overgrown wiz kid\". Waters plays along. After all, it's great publicity for Milady's Soap (\"the soap that sanctifies\"). Soon enough is too much! Beauregard refuses to leave the game and they cannot stump the genius. They try pulling the plug on the show, but there is outrage and sales plummet. Beauregard's revenge is taking shape. He wants to win the entire company. \"Happy\" Hogan is sent to influence Beauregard through Gwenn, but instead falls for the girl.\n\nWaters resorts to his secret weapon in the feminine form of Celeste Holm as Flame O'Neill. What a name! What a woman! Ostensibly a nurse hired by one of the many Beauregard Bottomley fan clubs that dot the country, to help him recover from a cold, the brainy and beautiful Flame puts a plan in action to upset the equilibrium of the corporate raider. Beauregard is smitten. Two romances, the fate of a prominent company and television history all rest with Beauregard Bottomley, the last scholar.\n\nChampagne for Caesar was produced by Harry Popkin. Harry and his brother Leo were film distributors who got into the producing line and whose titles gladden the hearts of old movie buffs. Along with Champagne for Caesar there is the great Christie adaption And Then There Were None, the classic film-noir Impact and D.O.A., and the social conscience drama The Well, among others.\n\nThe director of Champagne for Caesar is former actor Richard Whorf (Yankee Doodle Dandy, Blues in the Night). He began directing in the early 40s and movie credits include It Happened in Brooklyn and Luxury Liner. As of 1952 Whorf's work would be entirely for television including many episodes of My Three Sons, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Barbara Stanwyck Show and Gunsmoke. The sprightly score by Dimitri Tiomkin hits all the right notes. Tiomkin would also work with Harry Popkin on D.O.A. and The Well.\n\nVincent Price, Vicci Raaf\n\nThe supporting cast of this film are a delight. John Eldredge and Lyle Talbot are beleaguered Milady's Soap (\"the soap that sanctifies\") executives. Vici Raaf as Waters' secretary is a quiet riot and Ellye Marshall as a Monroe-like starlet is charming. Byron Foulger adds a droll touch as one of Gwenn's piano students. Bess Flowers can be found backstage at the Hollywood Bowl during the finale of \"Masquerade for Money\".\n\nChampagne for Caesar is one of those movies that could very easily be translated from 1950 to 2014. The gadgets have changed, and some of our TV viewing habits, but the habit is still there and the advertisers still have us by the throat. Game show contestants become celebrities, whether their knowledge exceeds that of 2 and 2 making 4 or not. Side note: my sisters and I once saw Jeopardy champ Ken Jennings on a street in Toronto and we pointed and screamed. I think we frightened him. The comedy in Champagne for Caesar is relatable and played with elan by a cast that truly delivers the good natured and hearty laughs.\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for June on TCM\n\nSome stories strike a chord with audiences and creators alike and find expression again and again throughout generations. Author Robert L. Fontaine was born in Illinois, but spent part of his childhood in Ottawa, Canada, the setting for his 1945 novel The Happy Time, which began life as several magazine short stories. In 1950 Samuel Taylor (Sabrina Fair, No Strings) adapted the stories for a Broadway play which had a successful run of 614 performances. Earl Felton (The Narrow Margin, Armored Car Robbery) received a Writers Guild Award nomination for his 1952 screenplay adaption for the Stanley Kramer production of The Happy Time. The Happy Time once again went to Broadway in 1968 as a Kander and Ebb musical winning three Tony Awards out of eight nominations. Thanks to DVDs and the astute TCM programmers, the winning film continues to find an accepting audience.\n\nDirector Richard Fleisher was keen to work on the project for his friend Stanley Kramer and recounts in his 1993 memoir Just Tell Me When to Cry:\n\n\"The making of The Happy Time was an unadulterated delight, and we were all pleased with the result. In the 1950s Radio City Music Hall was to movies what the Palace Theater used to be to vaudeville. To play the Palace was to achieve the pinnacle of success. To play the Music Hall was something to be proud of. The Happy Time played the Music Hall.\"\n\nSpringtime in Ottawa, circa 1921 is full of confusion and joy for Robert Bonnard, known affectionately to his large and loving family as Bibi. It is the springtime whenBibi will grow in understanding and from short pants to long. Bibi is played by 15-year-old Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan, So Dear to My Heart, special Oscar winner for The Window). His performance is sincere and amusing showing a young man with natural gifts who needed only guidance and material to fulfill his potential.\n\nBibi's Anglo-Scot Presbyterian mother is played by lovely Marsha Hunt (Raw Deal, The Valley of Decision). Madame Bonnard sees herself as the voice of reason and discipline in a family of crazy francophone males. For all her protestations she is as open-hearted and fun-loving as the rest of the Bonnards.\n\nBibi's father Jacques is an artist, the music director at the local vaudeville theatre. His philosophical nature may be the greatest influence, not only on Bibi, but on his whole family. Four time Oscar nominee for Best Actor Charles Boyer (Algiers, Love Affair) is charming in the role of family man. He wears it like a glove.\n\nGrandpere, played by versatile character actor Marcel Dalio (Casablanca, Tip on a Dead Jockey), lives with Bibi and his parents. He is, for all his years, a man whose hobby, avocation and reason for living is \"the ladies\". The dapper skirt chase is frowned upon by his daughter-in-law and accepted with a smile by his eldest son. His youngest son is the infamous Uncle Desmond played by Louis Jourdan (Gigi, The Swan). Desmond is a chip off the old block and, as Mme. Bonnard fears, a bad influence on Bibi. Ah, Louis Jourdan!\n\nKurt Kasznar, Jeanette Nolan, Ann Faber\n\nIn a neighbouring house resides Uncle Louis played by Kurt Kasznar (Lili, The Ambushers). Like his older brother Jacques, Louis is a philosopher, but one whose wisdom comes from a water cooler filled with wine. He is well-jmeaning, but more than a little cock-eyed. Louis' wife Felice is played by Jeanette Nolan (MacBeth, The Big Heat) and perhaps one of these days she will wear out from yelling at him. Perhaps not.\n\nKurt Kasznar played the role of Uncle Louis in the Broadway production and while Kramer and Fleischer agreed he was brilliant in the role at first they balked at paying the requested price for his service. They offered the role instead to Zero Mostel, but Harry Cohn of Columbia Studios who was backing the project refused to hire the blacklisted Mostel.\n\nAnother neighbour of the Bonnard's is Peggy O'Hare aka \"The Fighting American\" played by Marlene Cameron, also from the original Broadway production. Peggy is Bibi's classmate and fervent admirer.\n\nKurt Kasznar, Charles Boyer, Bobby Driscoll, Marsha Hunt, Louis Jourdan\n\nInto this mix of high spirits comes the Linda Christian (Battle Zone, The V.I.P.s) as the beauteous Mignonette. Eva Gabor played this role in the play. Mignonette is the refugee from a handsy vaudeville magician. The stranded showgirl is hired by Jacques to help his wife with the housework. Her charms are not lost on either Desmond or Bibi, although the proper young woman only has eyes for Rudolf Valentino.\n\nBibi's infatuation with Mignonette is not lost on Peggy and this inadvertently leads to a school crisis which requires the combined forces of the Bonnard to solve. The Happy Time is filled with charming and nostalgic episodes. It is amusing and touching in surprising and frank ways. Be prepared as the last scene will burst your heart.\n\nCharles Boyer as Jacques Bonnard in The Happy Time is one of my all-time favourite movie dads. Perhaps someone at TCM agrees with me as they are screening the movie as part of their Father's Day Salute on Sunday, June 15th at 8:00 am.\n\n↧\n\nSNOOPATHON: \"Bulldog\" Drummond\n\nFritzi of Movies, Silently is hosting the SNOOPATHON running June 1, 2 and 3 which celebrates all things spy-related in classic film. Check out all the intrepid sneaks and the bloggers who love them.\n\nH.C. (Sapper) McNeile's \"Bulldog\" Drummond captured reader's imaginations with the release of the 1920 novel Bulldog Drummond. Captain Hugh Drummond has too much energy and moxie to adjust totally to post-war life and advertises his brawny and brainy skills as an adventurer. Adventures he has - and plenty! Romance he finds with Phyllis Clavering. Arch-enemies and stalwart pals populate Bulldog Drummond's universe whether it is a private mission or one for Mother England.\n\nReaders turned into playgoers and then film fans. Ian Hunter (The Adventures of Robin Hood) once played Drummond on stage. The first movies based on the stories was filmed as early as 1922 and 1925. In his first talkie, Ronald Colman was nominated for an Oscar as Bulldog Drummond in 1929. Eighteen year old Joan Bennett was his Phyllis. In 1934 British International Pictures released The Return of Bulldog Drummond starring Ralph Richardson and Ann Todd and 20th Century gave us Colman in Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back.\n\nReginald Denny, John Howard, E.E. Clive, John Barrymore. A clue?\n\nParamount's busy young leading man Ray Milland (The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock) starred in the January 1937 release of Bulldog Drummond Escapes. Hugh (the character never refers to himself as \"Bulldog\" nor do any of his friends) falls in love with damsel in distress Phyllis played by Heather Angel (Lifeboat, The Last of the Mohicans). Also in place are Hugh's Bertie Wooster-like pal Algy Longworth played by Reginald Denny (Rebecca, Private Lives) and the indispensable manservant Tenny played by E.E. Clive (The Invisible Man, Night Must Fall). Inspector Nielson of The Yard is played by Sir Guy Standing (Death Takes a Holiday).\n\nOver the next two years seven movies would be made in the Bulldog Drummond series starring John Howard as Hugh. If you only know John Howard as the impatient younger brother of Ronald Colman in Lost Horizon or as stuffy George Kittredge in The Philadelphia Story you might look askance at the casting. No need to worry as John Howard brought a great sense of fun to the oft-times far out adventures, all the while maintaining an honest relationship with the other characters.\n\nHeather Angel and John Howard face danger.\n\nIt may a contradiction in terms, but I find these movies to be the most \"cozy\" of thrillers. It is the relationship among the three main characters that gives the series that \"family\" feeling. Howard, Denny and Clive make a perfect team as the devil-may-care Hugh, the lovably buffoonish Algy and the ingenious Tenny. These actors are the constant among all of the titles. The role of Phyllis alternated between Heather Angel and Louise Campbell (The Star Maker). The gist of most of the movies was that just as Hugh and Phyllis are about to march down the aisle, there is a murder, a robbery, a murder and a robbery, or a mystery of national import requiring Hugh's undivided attention. Often times Phyllis kidnapped. Often times Hugh and company underestimate Phyllis' resolve and usefulness.\n\nFrank Puglia in Bulldog Drummond's Revenge. Honest!\n\nAmong the great character actors determined to keep Hugh a bachelor throughout the series are J. Carroll Naish, Frank Puglia, Porter Hall, Anthony Quinn and Eduardo Ciannelli.\n\nElizabeth Patterson (Intruder in the Dust, Remember the Night) was featured as Phyllis' Aunt Blanche in three of the series titles and Zeffie Tilbury (The Grapes of Wrath, Werewolf of London) as Aunt Meg once and as different characters in two other outings. Nydia Westman (The Late George Apley, The Velvet Touch) was Algy's wife Gwen in two of the features before disappearing into the nursery to care for the couples' also never mentioned again child.\n\nThe role of Colonel Nielson was played by John Barrymore (Counsellor at Law, Twentieth Century) in the series launch and for three of the movies in which he was top billed, Bulldog Drummond Comes Back, Bulldog Drummond's Revenge and Bulldog Drummond's Peril. H.B. Warner (Lost Horizon, It's a Wonderful Life) took over the role in Bulldog Drummond in Africa and continued through Arrest Bulldog Drummond, Bulldog Drummond's Secret Police and Bulldog Drummond's Bride. Barrymore's Nielson was a master of disguise who dug right into the case at hand. Warner's Nielson was more of a fatherly desk jockey, but had moments of true quiet bravery. John Sutton (A Yank in the R.A.F., Captain from Castille) is uncredited as a Scotland Yard's Inspector or assistant in five of the seven movies.\n\nIn 1939s Arrest Bulldog Drummond Leonard Mudie (The Mummy, Kidnapped) is an electrical engineer who has invented a ray that destroys ammunition. The crackpot inventor believes he has found a way to stop war and shows his creation to one he believes to be in sympathy with the cause. The interested party turns out to be the great George Zucco (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Mummy's Hand) sporting coke bottle lenses and a poisoned dart in his walking stick. Lights go out, bodies are discovered and things start exploding all over London on the night of Hugh's bachelor dinner. Drummond is right in the middle of things. Why is he always there when a body shows up? He'll be the death of Colonel Nielson and Phyllis is definitely not going to be happy. We can see Tenny aging before our eyes.\n\nH.C. McNeile's The Final Count was the basis for this installment adapted by Stuart Palmer, creator of Hildegarde Withers. James P. Hogan, director of four of the Drummond flicks, was in charge on this story and, like each of the series, it moves along briskly so you don't have time to stop and think about things too deeply. You shouldn't be thinking. You should just be enjoying the solid entertainment. We go from murky London nights to sunny Caribbean days following thrill seeking aristocrats and greedy mercenaries. These spy types never do anything by halves. The world is always in danger from crackpot inventors and George Zucco. We are lucky that there's always a Bulldog Drummond and his pals and gals around to save us.\n\n↧\n\nLet's Go to the Movies: The Navigator (1924)\n\nWhat's better than a Sunday afternoon at the movies? How about Silent Sundays at the Revue Cinema. Throughout the year, Silent Sundays gives Toronto movie fans the chance to enjoy silent era shorts and features at the saved-from-the-brink charming Revue Cinema on Roncesvalles Avenue in west end Toronto. Nolan girls of various ages and shapes can often be found in attendance. One of us, Maureen, is the official tweeter (@SilentRevue) for the group.\n\nReal movie theatre popcorn.\n\nIt's what they munch in Asgard.\n\nIt was with unspoken assent that Nolan girls planned to attend The Navigator on June 8th, but it turned into something even more special than a regular #TeamBuster outing. It was niece Lenny's first at-the-movies movie experience! Her first movie theatre popcorn! Her first Buster movie!\n\nI have had the opportunity to see many of Buster's films in theatres in recent years and never have I shared more laughs with an audience be it a short like The Neighbors or an acclaimed feature like The Cameraman. When the lights go up you can actually feel the ache of stomach muscles.\n\nGirls Go Wild!\n\nLenny with her cousin Janet, Aunt Paddy, Aunt Maureen, mom Tracey, Aunt Paula\n\n(dad Jim was the photographer)\n\n1924s The Navigator co-directed by Buster and Donald Crisp is one of Keaton's most popular features. A rich young sap and the rich young lady who spurned his marriage proposal are set adrift on a luxury liner set adrift by spies. Her father sold the ship, spies bought it and other spies want to wreck it. It's the MacGuffin. The fun begins when these two babes at sea have to fend for themselves far away from civilization. Among the biggest laughs at yesterdays screening were the scene where Rollo (Buster) and Betsy (Kathryn McGuire) are running around the ship and keep missing each other, and the clever cameo from director Donald Crisp. Lenny, an aficionado of Margaret and H.A. Rey's Curious George was particularly fond of the scene where the monkey showed up.\n\nIt is especially heartwarming at silent film screenings to see families attending with their children. Kids laugh the loudest and it is wonderfully contagious. Lenny's excitement in the lobby when she saw the poster, \"Look! It's the picture of Buster in his under water outfit!\" caused a ripple of smiles down the queue of ticket buyers.\n\nMakia Matsumura and Lenny\n\nNot the usual \"first movie\" experience.\n\nHere's Lenny with accompanist Makia Matz, a large part of the wonderful experience of enjoying Buster's The Navigator. A great time was had by all, and we want more. Silent Sundays curator Alicia Fletcher mentioned that before the summer is over they will have a screening in Lenny's east end neighbourhood. We're there! The fall season will start off with Josef von Sternberg's Underworld, which has long been on my wish list. It's not exactly a Lenny movie, but Janet has already committed. Toronto is lucky to have Silent Sundays at the Revue.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n1967 in Film Blogathon: Who's Minding the Mint?\n\nToday we travel to 1967 in Film for a blogathon co-sponsored by Silver Screenings and The Rosebud Cinema.\n\nCanada celebrated its Centennial in 1967 and the most successful World's Fair of the 20th century, Expo '67, made Montreal a happening destination. I received my first wristwatch for my 10th birthday. Little Women was my favourite book, The Jungle Book my favourite movie and my favourite pop groups were The Seekers and The 5th Dimension. I loved to snack on Humpty Dumpty Potato Chips and Buried Treasure ice cream treats. All my TV crushes wore cowboy hats. My observations of adults in general, and the goings on on Search for Tomorrow in particular, led me to the conclusion that grown-ups were a screwy and emotional lot, and I feared for my impending journey into adulthood. It was all downhill from here! It is perhaps a good thing that I didn't see Who's Minding the Mint? as a serious minded 10-year-old. Talk about your screwballs!\n\nWalter Brennan, Jim Hutton\n\nHarry Lucas (Jim Hutton, TVs Ellery Queen) is a man with a plan. By day he is an average, fairly disgruntled wage slave at the U.S. Mint. He draws to himself the unwanted friendship of old coots (Walter Brennan, TVs The Real McCoys) and pups, the unlooked for romantic attentions of nice girls (Dorothy Provine, TVs The Roaring Twenties), and the suspicions of officious middle management types (David J. Stewart, TVs The Defenders). By night, courtesy of sample promotions and installment plans, Harry lives the high life with snazzy cars, snazzy apartments, snazzy suits and snazzier dames. Life is good until fate places Harry in a sticky situation making him responsible for the loss of 50,000 samples of his employer's product.\n\nHarry needs another plan. Somehow he must replace what has been lost before the long arm of the law puts the kibosh on all that is snazzy. His pal Pop can help as he wants one more kick at the presses before his retirement forced by a soon to be implemented automated system. Verna, whose affection is behind the trouble, can access necessary plates and would do anything for Harry. It's a start.\n\nThe services of a safe cracker are required and Pop knows just the man. Avery Dugan (Jack Gilford, TVs Soap) is about to get out of the Pen. He's down on his luck and hard of hearing. Every gang needs a deaf safe cracker! Armies march on their stomachs and crooks on a big job need backing and supplies. Meet Luther Burton (Milton Berle, TVs The Milton Berle Show), a pawnbroker with a generous streak of larceny.\n\nEntering such a visible edifice as the Mint in the dead of night requires stealth and knowledge of the city's underground tunnel system. Meet the sewer guy, Ralph Randazzo (Joey Bishop, TVs The Joey Bishop Show) who is always short of funds. For lookout there is Ralph's cousin Mario (Jamie Farr, TVs M*A*S*H). English is his second language, or would be if he had a second language. Their entry to and exit from the underground tunnel system is located under a most inconvenient window. There must be a way to keep the apartment's occupant occupied. Awkward ice cream peddler Willie Owens (Bob Denver, TVs Gilligan's Island) is like catnip to kooky artist Imogene (Jackie Joseph, TVs The Doris Day Show). He'll keep her busy!\n\nJim Hutton, Dorothy Provine, Jack Gilford\n\nMilton Berle, Walter Brennan, Joey Bishop, Victor Buono\n\nThe atmosphere of sewers being somewhat damp, it is determined that watercraft of some description be obtained for the reverse raid. You will never meet a more stalwart and focused mariner than \"Captain\" (Victor Buono, TVs Batman). Perhaps as a fan of the movie you have your favourite from among the zanies in the cast. Mine is Victor Buono as \"Captain\". I have only to think about his accent and his single-intentioned performance to lapse into convulsions.\n\nHarry is a man with a gang or does the gang have Harry? What's a few minutes more in the Mint? What's a few more runs of the press for a few dollars more evenly split among the worthies? It is the way of all heist flicks that one thing interferes with the strength of a well-rehearsed plan and so it is with ours when the Mint moves up the date of automation. You know how it is when you've planned something one way and suddenly it's not how you expect. There will be glitches and these glitches in Who's Minding the Mint? are hysterically and impeccably funny as these mismatched misfits of mayhem doggedly carry out \"the plan\".\n\nHoward Morris, genius\n\nWho's Minding the Mint? is my idea of the perfect 1960s comedy. How can it fail being directed by a certifiable genius in the comedy line, Howard Morris (TVs Caesar's Hour, immortal as Ernest T. Bass on The Andy Griffith Show, Hanna-Barbera performer)? Under Morris' direction the consummate ensemble plays the witty lines and sight-gags for maximum effect. The score by Lalo Schrifin has the driving insistence of his Mission Impossible theme, but with a goofy, off-kilter bounce. The sights and sounds of Who's Minding the Mint? bring me back to the world of yesterday and makes today just that much more amusing with its all or nothing wackiness.\n\n↧\n\nMGM Blogathon: Three Godfathers (1936)\n\nI'm an thrilled to be taking part in the MGM Blogathon sponsored by Diana and Connie of Silver Scenes and running from June 26th - 29th.\n\nMGM is justly renowned for its epics such as Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ and The Big Parade, its meticulously crafted costume dramas like Camille and Marie Antoinette, and its gloriously talent-stuffed musicals like Singin' in the Rain and The Wizard of Oz. MGM is not the first studio that leaps to mind when considering that Hollywood staple, the western.\n\nThe studio's western output of the 1920s is barely more than a dozen features, but they can boost of a genuine genre star in Tim McCoy. The real life sharpshooter and Native expert's storied career from soldier to film star to Ringling Brothers performer would be as interesting as any of his movies. In the 1940s MGM's westerns were mainly used as buffoonish vehicles for Wallace Beery (Jackass Mail, The Bad Man). They stepped up during the 1950s, a golden era for the genre, releasing a small but laudable group of titles including Devil's Doorway, Stars in My Crown, Westward the Women and The Naked Spur.\n\nMGM's western output in the 1930s was dismally sparse and included mainly musicals like the operetta The Girl of the Golden West with Jeanette MacDonald and Joan Crawford in Montana Moon, and comedies such as William Haines in Way Out West and Frank Morgan in Henry Goes Arizona. However, in the middle of the decade MGM surprises us with a gritty and artistic version of a venerable story by Peter B. Kyne.\n\nThe timeless Christmas tale of redemption The Three Godfathers first published in 1913 is the story for which Peter Kyne is best remembered thanks to the many film versions beginning in 1916 with The Three Godfathers directed by Edward LeSaint up to television with 1974s The Godchild directed by John Badham. William Wyler's Hell's Heroes in 1929 was the first sound version of the story. You can read Jim Lane's excellent article on that film here. The animated features 2002s Ice Age and 2003s Tokyo Godfathers owe more than a passing debt of gratitude to that long ago Saturday Evening Post serial. Spoiler alert: the discussion of the story and film here will make the bold assumption that you are familiar with The Three Godfathers either in its original form or from one of its many filmed adaption.\n\n\"Four Bad Men had ridden into Wickenburg that December afternoon, but only three rode out. One of the three had a bullet hole through his left shoulder.\"\n\nThe Worst Bad Man, The Wounded Bad Man and The Youngest Bad Man make their way across a desert to elude a posse and come across a stranded and recently widowed young woman about to give birth. The unfortunate woman asks the unholy trio to care for her child, placing most of her hope on The Youngest Bad Man. The Wounded Bad Man is the first to realize that their young compatriot is the truest hope for the child as neither he nor The Worst Bad Man possess the strength to complete the arduous journey to civilization after the loss of their horses and potable water. The Youngest Bad Man, a newcomer to the outlaw world, is also the purest of the trio and one The Wounded Bad Man hopes will be able to go forward and live a more blameless life for the sake of his fellows.\n\nRichard Boleslawski, Jean and Judith Kircher, Joseph Ruttenberg\n\nThe screenplay for this 1936 film version of the story is by Edward E. Paramore Jr. (The Virginian, The Bitter Tea of General Yen, Three Comrades) and Manuel Seff (Woman Chases Man, Trouble for Two, Blessed Event). Joseph Ruttenberg, four time Academy Award winning cinematographer (Gigi, Somebody Up There Likes Me, Mrs. Miniver, The Great Waltz) here plied his trade on location at Mojave and Red Rock Canyon State Park. The sense of desolation and weariness brings the viewer uncomfortably into the world of the story.\n\nThree Godfathers was directed by Richard Boleslawski (Rasputin and the Empress, Les Miserables, Theodora Goes Wild). Director Boleslawski is described by actress Marilyn Knowlden (young Cosette, Les Miserables) in her autobiography Little Girl in Big Pictures as \"a great bear of a man ... perfectly costumed in the role of director, with his leather-front sweater, pipe, and ascot tie.\" Boleslawski, a student of Constantin Stanislavski, was at the forefront of bringing that \"method\" of acting to the 20th century theatre. He founded the American Laboratory Theatre in 1923, and published Acting: The First Six Lessons in 1933. Spontaneity and sincerity were the hallmarks Richard Boleslawski sought from his actors.\n\nChester Morris, Irene Hervey\n\nThe setting of New Jerusalem is presented as the hometown of Bob, The Worst Bad Man, played by Chester Morris (The Big House). He takes a particular glee in robbing the \"hypocrites\" at Christmas. Bob torments his former love, Molly, played by Irene Hervey (Destry Rides Again) and her betrothed, a bank clerk played by Robert Livingston (The Three Mesquiteers). The vibrant Morris gives us a character brimming with cynicism and contempt. Everyone is a sucker and he uses their sentimentality against them.\n\nChester Morris, Walter Brennan, Lewis Stone\n\nLewis Stone (Grand Hotel) plays the outlaw known as \"Doc\", The Wounded Bad Man, and by his manner and interactions with the townspeople we learn that he is an educated man from New England, a wry observer of humanity. It is Doc who clearly sees the hopelessness of their situation, keeps Gus on the side of the angels, and uses all of his power to convince Bob to \"give the kid a break\". Bob's chilling response: \"I'll give him a break. If he wants to crawl to New Jerusalem I won't stand in his way.\" For it is back to New Jerusalem they must travel, the shortest way to civilization, the longest way to Bob's redemption. Doc is the first of the trio to die. In a quiet and unforgettable scene, Doc, alone with his books and a gun, recites Macbeth's famous soliloquy from Act 5 of that play. We hear Stone's resonant voice as the camera follows Gus and Bob walking away with the baby, then a shot.\n\nWalter Brennan (Red River) plays \"Gus\" who claims to be the world's oldest outlaw. At first glance Gus appears to be a stock comic relief character, but he proves to be quick on his feet, adept at his trade and entirely loyal. Gus is a man seemingly addicted to lying, but played by Brennan with a refreshing lack of artifice. On one level he has understood the import of their task, but the only way he can continue is by trying not to think about this being his end. When the full realization of his situation hits him Gus recites a prayer from his childhood, ashamed that he cannot recall it entirely and embarrassed by Bob's cynical derision. While Bob and the child sleep, Gus will wander off into the desert to die.\n\nThe baby in this version of the story is a sturdy, trusting crawler starting to teeth (twins Jean and Judith Kircher), rather than a newborn. After Gus' death Bob takes the loot and leaves the child crawling on a blanket. A few yards from the infant Bob turns and fires his gun. He has shot a rattlesnake crawling perilously close to the child. Bob admonishes the baby for making him kill the innocent critter. The die is cast.\n\nKyne's original story does not specifically state that The Youngest Bad Man dies when he reaches the next town with the baby, only that he collapses. The extent of his privations lead his death to be a natural conclusion, but prior to arriving at the saloon he has been imagining the life he will make for himself and the baby. In John Ford's 1948 version of 3 Godfathers (an Argosy Pictures production distributed by MGM) that dream is realized in the ending. You can read Kevin Deany's look at that film here. Ford had filmed the story previously in 1919 as Marked Men starring Harry Carey. I don't know how he ended that film, but I hope that as in the 1948 film he included my favourite part of the book. It is when the outlaws struggle to care for their helpless charge following instructions from a 19th century Dr. Spock.\n\nThe 1936 film gives us no doubt as to the fate of Bob, The Worst Bad Man. An hour away from New Jerusalem and knowing his strength is failing, Bob drinks from a poisoned water hole. Doc had mentioned when they had passed this way on the run that the poison would take about an hour to kill. Bob's sacrifice is done with this knowledge. He stumbles into New Jerusalem and, more dead than alive, drags himself to the front of the church during Christmas service. He places the child in Molly's arms and leans against a pillar where hangs a crown of thorns before collapsing in death. The last close-up of the film is not on the man we have journeyed with, but with his legacy as Molly resolutely leaves the church with the rescued child. The hope of the Three Bad Men.\n\nThe Three Godfathers is an unforgettable story that works as much as an adventure as an exploration of the depths of men's souls and the ironic twists of fate. It is understandable that it has inspired so many films. The IMDb lists two films projects as currently under production, one with a contemporary setting. Using the same plot different directors and screenwriters have been able to reach our hearts and minds, with audiences claiming one or more of the films as \"ours\". The rugged determination in the face of destruction is what touches me most in Richard Boleslawski's Three Godfathers.\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for July on TCM\n\nAh, summer. Many folks long to get away from the day to day routine of life. Maybe visit an exotic location. Meet some interesting people. Have an adventure! Can't get away? Well, that's where movies come in handy. We can hit the road to an exotic location, meet some interesting people and have an adventure all from the comfort of our favourite chair.\n\nOur behind-the-scenes tour guide on the trip known as The Big Steal is Don Siegel, early in his career change from editor and montage creator (The Roaring Twenties, Gentleman Jim) to director (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Charley Varrick). Our on-screen hosts are Jane Greer and Robert Mitchum, stars of 1947s Out of the Past as a couple with a twisted, angst-filled relationship that drips pure noir. This time around the characters played by our attractive leads do not have a past, but a present filled with danger.\n\nJane Greer, Robert Mitchum\n\nThe Big Steal, based on crime and western writer Richard Wormser's The Road to Carmichael's, is a road picture filmed on location in Tehuacan, Pueblo and at the Iverson Ranch. A gentleman by the name of Fisk played by Patric Knowles (The Adventures of Robin Hood, Auntie Mame) is a very popular fellow. His former fiance played by Jane Greer is most anxious to locate him and the $2,000 he \"borrowed\". Robert Mitchum is after Fisk for reasons which are initially unclear, but may parallel Ms. Greer's somewhat. Hot on Mitchum's tail is a door crashing, gun toting, hot headed William Bendix (The Blue Dahlia, Kill the Umpire). When there's a door crashing, gun toting, hot headed guy following you, you just want to keep moving, but watch where you're going as you might bump into a fussy art dealer played by John Qualen (The Grapes of Wrath, Casablanca).\n\nThese visitors to Mexico may well give tourists a bad name. They lie, cheat, speed, shoot and make general nuisances of themselves all over the countryside. None of their actions go unobserved as a very cool and smart official in the form of Inspector General Ortega played by Ramon Navarro (The Cat and the Fiddle, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ) works his own agenda.\n\nThe great fun in The Big Steal is the relationship between Greer and Mitchum that begins with outright dislike and progresses to wary admiration then trust through their masterful way with wisecracks and innuendo. The vigorous chase scenes and characterizations make The Big Steal a joy to watch.\n\nTCM has a day of crime pictures on tap Tuesday, July 8th. Check out The Big Steal scheduled for 4:15 pm. It's a dandy!\n\n↧\n\nThe John Ford Blogathon: Ford and The Informer (1935)\n\n\"For a director there are commercial rules that it is necessary to obey. In our profession, an artistic failure is nothing; a commercial failure is a sentence. The secret is to make films that please the public and also allow the director to reveal his personality.\"\n\nThe \"baby\" of his family, 19-year-old John Feeney, Jr. followed his successful actor/director elder brother Francis Ford to Hollywood in 1914. The son of Irish immigrants would be successful beyond imagining, growing up with an industry and helping it to grow. At the Francis Ford serial unit at Universal, Ford learned by doing everything - stunts, extra, assisting cameramen and directors, and writing. By the age of 22 the newly billed Jack Ford was a full-fledged director of westerns and collaborating with the great actor Harry Carey. At 25 he became a contract director at Fox Studios where, in addition to westerns, his talents were put to use in dramas, crime pictures and comedies. It was noticeable to the public and the studio that Ford was an able and reliable movie director. Occasionally critics would take note as well at his unerring eye and way with a story.\n\n\"It's no use talking to me about art, I make pictures to pay the rent.\"\n\nHe protests too much. John Ford continually pushed himself as a creator and that often placed him in positions of conflict with budget and time conscious officials. While shooting backgrounds in Europe for the 1928 release Four Sons Ford met and became friends with F.W. Murnau, soon to work for Fox. Ford studied the German filmmakers methods of pre-production and their sophisticated visual techniques, bringing those to his WWI drama.\n\n\"I'm a journeyman director, a traffic cop in front of the camera, but the best traffic cop in Hollywood.\"\n\nThe \"traffic cop\" may have been proud of his working class attitude toward the job, but obviously yearned for more control over content as his contract at Fox/20th Century Fox allowed for freelance work. The freelance clause would prove most fortuitous for a singular project when Ford met the Irish author Liam O'Flaherty and in 1933 optioned his award winning 1925 novel The Informer. The novel spoke to Ford's Irish soul and his artist's heart.\n\n\"It's going to be very hard to find a studio that will back this picture. It's very different from the usual fare.\"\n\nFord knew his industry and was not welcomed when he shopped his and Dudley Nichols (The Long Voyage Home, The Lost Patrol) treatment of The Informer at the various studios. Merian C. Cooper at RKO was fearless enough in spirit and looking for something artistic to compliment the great commercial success he had experienced with King Kong. It was the beginning of a friendship and a business partnership resulting in Argosy Pictures.\n\nThe budget for the film as $243,000 and the soundstage a building formerly used for storage.\n\n\"I'm going to build all the production values into the camera.\"\n\nFord and Nichols had pared the story down to its essential dialogue and Ford was excited about a stylistic approach to the shoot, giving a sense of the mystical in the fogbound night and the foggy mind of the leading character, Gypo Nolan. Meticulous planning and storyboarding was carried out with cinematographer Joseph August (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, They Were Expendable), art director Van Nest Polglase (Citizen Kane, Top Hat), set decorator Julia Heron (The Best Years of Our Lives, The Bishop's Wife) and composer Max Steiner (King Kong, Gone With the Wind).\n\nVictor McLaglen as Gypo Nolan\n\nIt is 1920, the height of the \"the troubles\" in Ireland when the brutish, but loyal Gypo Nolan foolishly seizes upon an opportunity to get a little money and save his girlfriend Katie from prostitution and give them a new life. He informs on his best friend Frankie McPhillip, wanted for murder by the British. Gypo's love for his friend hasn't died, but he sees a way out and takes it. Perhaps he didn't foresee Frankie's death at the hands of the police. Gypo is not one who thinks very far ahead. The enormity of his betrayal he both understands and denies. While the local IRA commander Dan Gallagher hunts for the informer, Gypo wanders through the city in increasing remorse and in trying to run away from himself, he loses all his money at the prodding of a fair weather friend and drink. Brought to trial by his former comrades the frightened Gypo struggles to divert blame and escape. Katie pleads with the commander for the hapless soul, but what Gypo set in motion cannot be stopped.\n\nVictor McLaglen was the only choice Ford had for Nolan and the director constantly kept his lead off balance to achieve the performance he desired. Often noted for over-the-top cruelty toward some actors, one wonders whether or not it was necessary, but the proof is in the performance. The Informer was McLaglen's seventh picture with Ford and he would vow never to work with him again. He would appear in five more Ford movies.\n\nJohn Ford\n\n1895 - 1973\n\nThe Informer opened at Radio City Music Hall to glowing critical response, but little box office. Surprisingly, to Hollywood brains, it was in the smaller cities throughout the country that The Informer gathered steam. If audiences were at first taken aback by the unexpected Ford/ McLaglen collaboration, they were impressed.\n\nFord was awarded the first of four Oscars for Best Director for The Informer; the other titles being The Grapes of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley and The Quiet Man. The nomination for Stagecoach was caught up in the Gone With the Wind juggernaut. However, with The Informer John Ford's reputation as a director of artistic merit was now assured.\n\nThe Informer is, to this date, the only film to win the New York Film Critics Circle award for Best Picture by a unanimous vote on the first ballot. John Ford was acclaimed Best Director. The National Board of Review named The Informer Best Picture.\n\nOscar wins\n\nBest Actor in a leading role, Victor McLaglen\n\nBest Director, John Ford\n\nBest Writing, screenplay, Dudley Nichols\n\nBest Music, score, Max Steiner\n\nOscar nominations\n\nBest Picture (winner, Mutiny on the Bounty)\n\nBest Editing, George Hivey (winner, Ralph Dawson, A Midsummer Night's Dream)\n\nAt the time of the release of The Informer John Ford was active in the Screen Directors Guild as treasurer and fervent supporter of labor. The Guild boycotted the Academy Awards that year and Dudley Nichols and John Ford refused their awards. A few months after the event John Ford chose to accept his well-deserved award and his ties with the Guild were irreparably broken.\n\nIn the cyclical nature of motion picture criticism and assessment, The Informer has gone through periods where it has taken hits as \"not living up to its reputation\", even from its creator. I don't know where it stands currently in the minds of the great thinkers. Personally, the characters, the conflict and the masterfully controlled and visually exciting storytelling leaves my gut wrenched and my heart singing.\n\nI'm very grateful that Krell Laboratories and Bemused and Nonplussed for hosting The John Ford Blogathon from July 7 - 13 and so will you be when you check out the insightful articles from passionate writers.\n\nQuotes\n\nPappy: The Life of John Ford by Dan Ford\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nJames Garner (1928 - 2014)\n\nJames Garner, whose great ease and charm on screen has convinced generations that he was only playing himself, does his thing in the greatest comedy-western of all time, 1969s Support Your Local Sheriff!. Written by William Bowers and directed by Burt Kennedy, the movie spoofs everything which is near and dear to my heart, My Darling Clementine, Red River, Rio Bravo, High Noon and Winchester '73, et cetera.\n\nJim plays Jason McCullough, a stranger in town who drifts into the sheriff's job. Life is complicated by every character actor from every western you have ever seen including Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan, Jack Elam, Willis Bouchey, Walter Burke, Bruce Dern, Gene Evans and Kathleen Freeman.\n\nThe scene posted here for your pleasure has Jim/Jason working out his High Noon dilemma with off-kilter leading lady, Prudy, played by the extremely talented Joan Hackett.\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for August on TCM\n\nI'm a sucker for an after-life fantasy. As an impressionable youngster I saw The Green Pastures on television and I'll certainly be surprised if I get past those Pearly Gates and the head guy doesn't look like Rex Ingram. Of course, in Cabin in the Sky Mr. Ingram was in charge of that other place, which impressed me because of the presence of Louis Armstrong (\"You gotta get hot to play real cool.\"). However, in that movie Ethel Waters was so adamant about Heaven being THE place to go that she made me feel guilty about liking the music.\n\nIn Powell and Pressburger's Stairway to Heaven an angelic emissary opines that \"Many people would consider it heaven to be a clerk (as in office worker)\". That's for me! I can find heaven browsing in a stationery shop.\n\nSomeone else who was a sucker for after-life fantasies was writer Harry Segall whose play Heaven Can Wait aka The Wonderful Journey was filmed in 1941 as Here Comes Mr. Jordan. The Jordan of the title was played by stylish Claude Rains. As the angel in charge, his unflappability could be either comforting or annoying as the mood strikes you. Most of us, I imagine, would retain our human fallibility as Messenger 7013 played by Edward Everett Horton exhibits when he causes all the fuss in the plot.\n\nLike Mr. Ingram mentioned previously, Claude Rains covered both realms of Forever-after on screen. Also written by Harry Segall, in Angel on My Shoulder Rains plays Nick, the harried manager of the repository of soiled souls. The 1946 film directed by Archie Mayo (The Petrified Forest, Orchestra Wives, Moontide) tells the tale of his experiences with bumped off mobster Eddie Kagel played by Paul Muni.\n\nPaul Muni\n\n1895 - 1967\n\nIn his time Mr. Muni was a highly respected actor of stage and screen. He received a Tony as Henry Drummond in the 1956 Broadway production of Inherit the Wind and won an Oscar for 1937s The Story of Louis Pasteur. His five other Oscar nominations were for 1929s The Valiant, 1934s I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, 1936s Black Fury, 1938s The Life of Emile Zola and 1959s The Last Angry Man. Paul Muni's reputation has diminished as tastes in acting have changed, but I believe audiences do themselves a disservice in dismissing Muni's range and commitment.\n\nPaul Muni Day during TCM's August Summer Under the Stars salute is the perfect opportunity to judge anew the man who seamlessly immersed himself in the roles of intellectuals and brutes, labourers and gangsters.\n\nPaul Muni, Claude Rains\n\nAngel on My Shoulder's Eddie Kagle is a kid of the streets, a self-made man who used his instincts and his strength to gain power. After doing a stretch in prison and expecting due consideration from his partner in crime, Smiley Williams played by Hardy Albright, Kagle gets what's coming to him. Shot with his own rod and sent straight to ... well, where the \"H\" is he? The place is a hellhole, suffocatingly hot and smelling of sulphur. Guards or no guards, nothing will stand in Eddie's way. He has to crash out and make Smiley pay for his betrayal.\n\nNick or Mephistopheles or whatever you want to call him, has a use for Eddie. It seems our boy is the spitting image of a crusading judge named Parker. Nick has got to stop Parker from cleaning up the streets and helping disadvantaged kids. If he plants Eddie's body in Judge Parker's, Eddie will have the means to get even with Smiley and the thick-headed lout will ruin Judge Parker's reputation in time to keep him from becoming Governor. Win-Win as far as old Beelzebub is concerned. Eddie's willing to go along, even though he senses that Nick is a con man of the highest order. Revenge is the engine moving his actions.\n\nAnne Baxter, Paul Muni\n\nYou'll be able to see the plot coming a mile away, but the fun is in the journey. Judge Parker's pretty secretary, Barbara, played by Anne Baxter (The Magnificent Ambersons, The Razor's Edge, All About Eve) has a softening influence on Eddie's heart and Eddie's impetuosity turns each misstep into something favourable on the Judge's behalf. The screenplay is a delight to my ears. Nick speaks as if he had swallowed the Oxford English Dictionary while Eddie's speech is a jumble of blunt and colourful 1940s slang.\n\nThe fun and philosophy can be found on Wednesday, August 6th at 4 p.m. Let's spend Summer Under the Stars with Paul Muni.\n\n↧\n\nLet's Go to the Theatre: FringeKids and Geri Paige Gans\n\nToronto's Fringe Festival ran this year from July 2 - 13. Like Fringe Festivals everywhere, the theatre scene crackles with creativity and the joy of discovery. This year, the \"Nolan Girls\" got together to enjoy FringeKids, plays with an appeal to the younger set (get 'em while they're young). Specifically, we were keen to see, for the first time since the 80s, writer/composer Geri Gans take on Rapunzel.\n\nRapunzel author/composer Geri Gans with my niece Lenny, a fan\n\nnote: Lenny doesn't need glasses, she just likes them\n\nThe show was a success (nobody got rich, but nobody went broke) playing to sold out audiences throughout the run. The very funny play filled with memorable tunes and wacky characters won over its audience in all age brackets. The sheltered and silly Rapunzel, the sarcastically wicked witch, the friendly frog, the put-upon crow (minion to witch) and the befuddled prince will live long the memories of many. It was a shorter version than the production last seen in Toronto back in 1986 to fit Fringe requirements, but still a vivid presentation.\n\nGeri Gans, Paddy (Caftan Woman) and Judy Gans\n\nFringeKids 2014\n\nOne of the great things for me about getting out to FringeKids was seeing Geri. Oh, we chat on e-mail these days, but a real, honest-to-goodness face to face has been sorely lacking. As an actress, teacher, writer and composer Geri Paige Gans is someone who makes Toronto the swell theatre town that it is. I wanted you to meet her and she graciously shared some memories with us. You will find funny stories and familiar names. And you'll find that, like most of us, the theatre bug bites early!\n\nABOUT ME\n\nMy father died and he left me a cow\n\nWith a wing wang waddle-oh\n\nJack sing saddle-oh\n\nBlowsy boys bubble-oh\n\nUnder the moon\n\nI am 4 years old, sitting on my father's lap and he is reading a nonsense poem to me from the Book of Knowledge. It went on for several more verses and choruses, and the first line always upset me.\n\nI AM 7 YEARS OLD\n\nThe teacher gave us a very interesting project called What I Want to Be When I Grow Up. You had to write \"I want to be\" and fill in the blank. I knew right away. I wanted to be an actress. I put it in book form complete with a table of contents.\n\nTitle page: I Want to Be an Actress\n\nPage 1: Great Actresses. I listed everyone I could think of from Sarah Bernhardt to my favourite at the time, Ginger Rogers.\n\nPage 2: Great plays. Peter Pan and whatever Shirley Temple had been in, even though she only made movies.\n\nPage 3: Plays I have been in. Completely blank. I hadn't been in anything yet.\n\nMy mother bought me a Big Little Book that summer called My Life and Times by Shirley Temple. She was only 6 years old and had written a whole book! It included a picture of Will Rogers reading Life Begins at 40 to her.\n\nSYLVIA\n\nThe greatest influence in my life was my sister, Sylvia. Shirley Temple sang a song When I Grow Up in a movie. In Toronto at that time there was a radio show called The Ken Sobel Amateur Hour. My sister thought it would be fun if I went on the show and sang When I Grow Up. Since our father's store was on Yonge Street near Dundas, it would just be a short walk to the radio station. Mr. Sobel asked people in the audience if they wanted to perform. My sister put my hand up and I was escorted onto the stage. A pianist played for me and I sang using all the stupid gestures I had seen in the movie. Polite applause then I was escorted back to my seat whereupon Mr. Sobel noticed my sister Sylvia who was a stunning 18-year-old, \"Do you do anything?\" She said, \"Yes, I sing.\" He said, \"Would you like to sing for us?\". She said, \"I'd love to.\" He said, \"What is your name?\". She said, \"Sally Smith.\" I said, \"It is not!!!\" But he obviously wasn't listening to me. \"What would you like to sing, Sally?\" She said Goody Goody. He led her to the stage and announced \"Miss Sally Smith will sing Goody Goody.\" Audience applause determined the winner. No contest. Sally Smith won hands down (together?) and returned to the stage to receive her prize, a Bulova watch. And our dad owned a jewelry store.\n\nI AM 9 YEARS OLD\n\nMy best friend Clara and I would write little plays. At closing time on Friday or Saturday the poor staff at my father's store would have to sit around in the large repair area in the back and watch our \"performances\". They were very gracious about it.\n\nOne skit I remember was called Dr. Picklepuss and Dr. Hicklepuss. The dialogue had to sound very mysterious and sinister.\n\nDr. P: Is everything ready, Dr. Hicklepuss?\n\nDr. H: All Ready, Dr. Picklepuss.\n\nDr. P: Equipment all in place, Dr. Hicklepuss?\n\nDr. H: All in place, Dr. Picklepuss.\n\nDr. P: And no one is about?\n\nDr. H: No one is about.\n\nDr. P: You sure?\n\nDr. H: Very sure.\n\nDr. P: Then shall we begin?\n\nDr. H: Yes. Let us being.\n\nThey turn on the equipment and start waltzing to the Minuet in \"G\". What is interesting about this is that years later I saw a couple of comics doing a similar route on television.\n\nSYLVIA\n\nWhen I was 10, and because of my interest in acting, my sister thought it would be a good idea to take elocution lessons from a friend of hers named Mildred. Every week she drove me to Mildred's house for my hour. My lessons consisted of reading some paragraphs or speeches and then looking up a bunch of words in the dictionary for proper pronunciation. That was my homework. I remember \"profile\" was supposed to be pronounced either \"profeel\" or \"proful\". At the end of the year we did a play and I got the lead! I was to play \"Corinna\" in Beyond the Gate. I wore a beautiful white satin dress and drove the dressmaker crazy wanting a fuller skirt. I would only answer to Corinna and I'm sure I was unbearably obnoxious. I also had dreadfully phony speech and my sister pulled me out of those classes immediately after the play. One interesting highlight was that on a streetcar one day a little girl came over to me and asked if I was \"Corinna\" in Beyond the Gate. When I said I was, she asked for my autograph!\n\nSTUPID! STUPID!! STUPID!!!\n\nMy sister had taken piano lessons and composed a very dramatic piece of music which she called Melancholia. I thought it was wonderful and wanted to learn it. I couldn't read music so she taught it to me by memory. When my parents asked me if I would like to take piano lessons too I said yes. They called my sister's piano teacher, Mr. Adelmo Melecci. I played Melancholia for him and he was very impressed. I was ten years old and was much more impressed with the fact that my sister could actually compose beautiful music like that! Playing it was easy for me. I liked learning new pieces, but hated thepractice sessions which, of course, became longer as the music became more difficult. Mr. Melecci would come to the house Saturday morning or sometimes I would be taken to the Toronto Conservatory of Music. When that happened my treat was to sit on one of the two lion statues in front of the building after my lesson.\n\nMr. Melecci had perfect pitch and the first few minutes of every lesson were spent in trying to fool him. He would cover his eyes and I would play sharps or flats, but he guessed the right note every time. He brought over a metronome at my first lesson, but I never really learned proper timing. He would play pieces from each new grade and I would pick the ones I liked. Because he had played them I knew how they should sound so I never had to figure out the timing for myself. I completed 7 grades in a year and a half. Did OK at my exams at the Conservatory and played in one recital. My piece was Boccherini's Minuet. My friend Clara was also studying with Mr. Melecci, so her father had recital dresses made for us in his little clothing manufacturing factory, which was relaly a couple of rooms at the back of his house occupied by ladies sitting at machines and sewing. The \"Hammer Garment Company\" dresses were exactly the same except that Clara's was wine taffeta and mine was blue.\n\nI wanted to stop taking lessons because I was nearly 12 and knew everything and I would be going into high school in the fall and was sure I'd have way too much work to practice piano. Mr. Melecci would come over to the store once or twice a month for a whole year and say he'd teach me for $1.00 a lesson. Then he said for free!! He could have me in Carnegie Hall by thetime I was 16!!! But I was stubborn and stupid. I was going to be an actress! Who needed piano lessons? Little did I know how much those lessons lessons would have helped me when I started teaching acting and composing music.\n\nFIRST SONG\n\nI am 10 years old. My brother, age 12, and I are composing a song. It's called Sitting Alone in the Moonlight. I'm music, Ned is words. He was very proud ofone line: \"You are a perfect gem. You're in my arms again\". \"Get it?\" he asked. \"Perfect gem! And we have a jewelry store.\" \"But it doesn't rhyme!\" \"Doesn't matter.\" From that day on my lyrics had to rhyme.\n\nSYLVIA\n\nMy sister was cast as the mother in a play called The World We Make by Sydney Kingsley and they needed a kid to play her daughter. There was never any question. She just brought me to a rehearsal and that was that. Lou Jacobi played my father. I became the resident kid when Sylvia and Ben (Lennick) formed The Belmont Group Theatre with Leo Orenstein and his wife Lucille Kallen. Lucille later became one of the writers of the Sid Caesar Show and got Ben (Gans) and I tickets to the show on our honeymoon.\n\nWORDS AND MUSIC\n\nIt was at The Belmont that I first met Sarah. She wanted to work backstage and learn theatre. She was 3 years older than me and a brilliant writer. We suddenly found ourselves composing songs. It worked this way. She would say \"Give me a title.\" then she would come back the next day with a whole page of lyrics and I would try to compose a melody that would mesh with her words. Some of the stuff was not too shabby.\n\nAfter high school (2 years at Jarvis Collegiate and 3 years Central Tech Art Department) Sarah and I went to New York for a month (my graduation present). You could line up at 6 am and guy standing room only theatre tickets for $1.00. We went to every musical we could. I remember vividly standing at the back of the theatre and it seemed that only an hour had elapsed for the entire production of Guys and Dolls. It just flew by! And we were flying too!\n\nSYLVIA\n\nBack home again, worked at the store as a cashier, played \"Hennie\" in Clifford Odets'Awake and Sing with the Belmont. One day my sister said, \"Why don't you try out for summer stock at the Royal Alex. You'll get to work with Ferrer.\" Good idea.\n\nJose Ferrer\n\nI had read about Jose Ferrer doing Charley's Aunt with a caption under his picture that read \"Brazil: Where the nuts come from\". He was going to do Richard III and The Green Goddess that summer in Toronto. Sylvia's husband Ben took me to the Royal York Hotel to meet with the director Robert Henderson and told him I was very talented. I was asked if I could sing. (Yes.) Could I dance? (Like a rock, but I told him yes.) Mr. Henderson liked me (he said that I \"sparkled\" on the stage) and gave me a small bit in \"Richard\" as Mistress Shore. I had to walk up the stairs with Ferrer and laugh lustily. Unfortunately, at 18, I looked cute, not lusty, so the part went to a hefty, bosomy gal instead. But it did begin a friendship with Jose that lasted for many years.\n\nIn the fall I was cashiering at the Rio Theatre up the street from my dad's store and got to know a group of young musicians who were looking for a vocalist. That was fun! We still had the piano at the store so that's where we rehearsed. Ralph, the pianist, taught me a little about chords, but I can still only write in the key of C. Timing? Pathetic.\n\nLorne Greene\n\nOne day, my sister said that Lorne Greene had started a marvelous school that she thought would be good for me. She was right. The Academy of Radio Arts was a wonderful, wonderful experience. I couldn't wait to get to class every day. I won the acting scholarship.\n\nMy sister had always wanted to go to the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and was very happy that my scholarship and a word from Lorne Greene would allow me to go there. But for the summer Greene wanted me to be a councilor at Arowhon Camp as well as Director of Evening Program and Arts and Crafts. Before I left his office he told me to look up a councilor there by the name of Ben Gans. At the door he said \"Paige*, I met my wife at Arowhon.\" Great matchmaker.\n\nTIME CAPSULE\n\nMarried Ben in 1951. Worked to help save for a house. Bought Don Mills (north Toronto) home in 1954. Had two beautiful little girls, Judy in 1955 and Debi in 1957. Started teaching acting in 1963 in rec room, the \"Downstairs Studio\". Wrote a short year-end play based on children's stories and alternated between the four plays and a demonstration script for the year-end production which was held in the studio or the Don Mills library. After 25 years teaching bit the dust and I began adding music to the studio plays. The Emperor's New Clothes is finished and I'm starting to work on Cinderella, Rumpelstiltskin and The Pied Piper are waiting in the wings. Got back to performing in Community Theatre. Won a Thea for Torch Song Trilogy. Loved doing Cabaret. Did Social Security (twice) with Ben and am trying to get back to painting. I would hate those three years in the art department go to waste.\n\nSYLVIA\n\nOne day my sister asked me to write a musical based on Rapunzel as it was very rarely done. She would like to produce it and present it at the old Eaton's College Street Theatre. I spent a very enjoyable summer working on that project, but when it was finally finished it turned out that the cost of producing it was prohibitive. Sylvia was very upset but suggested that I offer it to Young People's Theatre, which I did. Susan Rubes loved it and held onto it for a year and a half, but finally had to return it. It had only six characters and their productions usually had large casts. Rapunzel / The Girl in the Tower did find a home with Scarborough Music Theatre for a 6 performance Christmas weekend in 1986. Remember, Paddy?\n\nRapunzel aka The Girl in the Tower\n\nThe original cast\n\nPaddy (Caftan Woman) remembers. I was on the Board of Directors of Scarborough Music Theatre at that time when we decided to produce Geri's wonderful show. I acted as stage manager on the production and later performed on a demo tape of the songs with leading lady Judy Gans, the author's daughter. It's something I recall with great fondness and pride.\n\nAnd a mere 28 years later when two friends of Judy wanted to do a children's musical for the Fringe Festival, Rapunzel was ready once again to let her hair down. When I think about it I realize that without my sister Sylvia there would be no Rapunzel.\n\nI've never stopped composing music. I'm very lucky. Melodies just seem to come into my head all by themselves. Writing them down on sheet music is a different story, but I think I'm getting the hang of it ... almost.\n\nThere are so many wonderful memories. The people I worked with at the Royal Alex, some great Ferrer stories, my buddy at the Academy who ended up as president of CTV, the brilliant young student who played piano for me at the Neighborhood Playhouse and is a big-time director in Hollywood, doing a scene with Eddie Robinson Jr. and meeting his dad, Edward G., later. Seeing friends on TV and being able to say \"I want to school with him or her.\" Good stuff.\n\nRapunzel follow-up. My sister Tracey relates that daughter Lenny has been playing Rapunzel for the last 3 weeks. It's a sequel of sorts - Lenny meets Rapunzel on the subway and invites her to come move in with us. Melody (the frog) too.\n\n↧\n\nBuild Your Own Blogathon: T-Men (1947)\n\nThe Build Your Own Blogathon hosted by the Classic Film and TV Cafe is successfully underway. Today's post links to Paul's (Lasso the Movies) through Wallace Ford, the actor who philosophically reminded us what stinkers normal human beings can be in Harvey.\n\nWallace Ford, the subject of one of my earliest blog posts, was an actor whose long career included ten Broadway shows, with a highlight being the role of George in Of Mice and Men. We are fortunate to be able to share in his four decade Hollywood career through such titles as Freaks, The Beast and the City, Lost Patrol, The Informer, Blues in the Night, The Mummy's Tomb, Shadow of a Doubt, Black Angel, The Set-Up, The Furies, The Man from Laramie, The Rainmaker, The Matchmaker, A Patch of Blue, and your favourite that I may have missed.\n\nDennis O'Keefe and Alfred Ryder star as Treasury Department agents who go undercover to bust up a counterfeit ring in Anthony Mann's 1947 crime-noir-docudrama T-Men. Beginning in 1944 and throughout the decade Mann honed his considerable skill on a number of intense crime dramas that speak \"noir\" to generations with such titles as The Great Flamarion, Raw Deal and Border Incident. In the 50s he would bring that dark sensibility to the adult western with Winchester '73 and The Man from Laramie, etc. before tackling epics including El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire. The Mann I like best is whichever Mann I happen to be watching.\n\nWilliam Malten, Dennis O'Keefe\n\nVirginia Kellogg's (White Heat, Caged) story and John Higgins' (Raw Deal, Big House, USA) screenplay follows in the docucrama tradition of The House on 92nd Street and Boomerang! featuring a voice over narration (Gayne Whitman) that takes us through the procedure of the investigation. The field officers, the lab technicians, informants and supervisors all play vital roles in penetrating the underworld. Like actors preparing a back story for a character, Agents O'Brien and Genaro create criminal personas to give them access to a Detroit based mob. Information links the criminals in Detroit to brazen counterfeiters in Los Angeles. An informant was brutally gunned down by an enforcer who enjoys his work too well played by cold-eyed Charles McGraw. It will be a long and dangerous road that leads from Detroit to L.A.\n\nOur sharp and resourceful agents discover a link between the two mobs in the form of a character known as The Schemer played by Wally Ford. The physical description is about 5'9\" and stout, smokes cigars and takes Chinese herbs. While there are probably more than a few stout, 5'9\" smokers in Los Angeles, the Chinese herbs is something to go on. Agent O'Brien, now known as Harrigan, heads to California to track the lead, leaving Genaro, now Galvani, with the Vantucci mob in Detroit.\n\nDid you ever spend ten nights in a Turkish bath looking for a man? Don't.\n\nWhen a herbalist complains of the customer fitting the agent's description taking too many unhealthy steam baths, Harrigan has a further lead. It's not the most comfortable of assignments, and it's going to get worse. In order to get The Schemer to open doors to the gang, Harrigan poses as a would be rival in the counterfeiting game, receiving lots of bumps and bruises for his trouble, not to mention losing eight pounds in the Turkish baths.\n\nDennis O'Keefe, Wally Ford\n\nThe Schemer is one of those roles where, in the hands of the right actor, the character can steal the movie. Wally Ford was the right actor. Once involved in the higher echelon of the gang, The Schemer has fallen from grace and fallen far. He has the nerve to keep up the pretense of being a main player despite the disdain heaped upon him by the muscle men and messenger boys. Knowing he is only tolerated by the boss because of the threat of revealing inside details through a hidden book, The Schemer's bravado only thinly covers his constant fear. Initially, Schemer hopes Harrigan's promise of exceptional plates to compliment his gang's high quality paper will put him back in a position of trust. However, he is not above looking for a way to hijack the entire business. When an unfortunate meeting puts a crack in Genaro's cover, a doomed Schemer will use that information in an effort to save his own skin. The Schemer's demise at the hands of McGraw is one of the most memorable in all film-noir.\n\nAlfred Ryder\n\nDennis O'Keefe, Charles McGraw in reflection\n\nA further murder may be one of the most heart-breaking in 40s crime pictures and serves to illustrate the commitment of the agents and the depravity of their quarry. While the narration serves to keep the viewer grounded in the routine of the work, the human factor is filled with tension, suspense and brutality. We are kept in a beautiful yet suffocating world of black and white images, of choking close-ups, upward angles and deceiving distances. Director Mann and cinematographer John Alton create a world and a mood removed from our own that is frightening and inviting. Their collaborations are impressive: T-Men, Raw Deal, He Walked by Night, Reign of Terror, Border Incident and Devil's Doorway.\n\nJane Randolph\n\nThree women perform essential roles in the unfolding drama of what is labeled \"The Shanghai Paper Case\". Glamorous nightclub singer Mary Meade plays Evangeline, a go-between for the LA mob who knows enough to know when to be frightened. Lovely and expressive June Lockhart has an important cameo that is a prelude to tragedy. Strangely uncredited, Jane Randolph of The Curse of the Cat People, Railroaded! and Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein exudes power as the face of the mob kingpin.\n\nT-Men is an outstanding example of the crime docudrama, a true \"noir\", and a movie that can place the viewer in another time while retaining the freshness of genuine interest and emotion.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCaftan Woman's Choice: One for September on TCM\n\n\"It is always up there, close to the clouds, on the topmost floors of the sky-reaching towers of big business. And because it is high in the sky, you may think that those who work there are somehow above and beyond the tensions and temptations of the lower floors. This is to say that it isn't so.\"\n\nHeigh ho, heigh ho, it's off to work we go. Work takes up a large portion of all of our lives. Even away from the salt mines, whether we are a boss or a nameless cog in the wheel of industry, its influence is pervasive. The subject of the corporate life is endlessly fascinating to explore, and entertainment in the 1950s gave us many interesting takes on business power, how to obtain it, how to use it, as well as the struggle to balance work and home life. Rod Serling's 1956 teleplay Patterns examines personal responsibility in a power struggle. Broadway (1953) and Hollywood's (1956) comedy of a shareholders revolt, The Solid Gold Cadillac brings a romantic comedy to the boardroom. Jean Negulesco directed 20th Century Fox's glossy Woman's World from 1954 and soapy The Best of Everything in 1959.\n\nMGM assembled one of their all-star ensembles for Ernest Lehman's character study, Executive Suite in 1954 directed by Robert Wise. Each actor in the cast was familiar to the audience and exceedingly skilled. We get to know these people over the course of a 24 hour period when the charismatic chairman of the Tredway Corporation, a large furniture manufacturing concern, is felled by a heart attack. Initially, the body of Avery Bullard is unidentified leading to an attempt at stock manipulation by Board member George Caswell (Louis Calhern) who witnessed the body being removed by ambulance.\n\nA note here about blonde babe Lucy Knoch who plays the bored and ignored, and much younger than her spouse, Mrs. George Nyle Caswell. I had for many years, since my first viewing, considered this character as Caswell's live-in girlfriend. It was only on a recent viewing that I noticed the character's billing as \"Mrs.\". Was this censor appeasement or was I a particularly cynical teenager? Consider this exchange:\n\nGeorge Caswell: \"Do me a favor, will you? Read the funnies.\"\n\nMrs. Caswell: \"There aren't any in The Times. Don't you know that?\"\n\nGeorge Caswell: \"Then read \"Situations Wanted\". You may need one.\"\n\nThe relationship could be read either way.\n\nFredric March, Paul Douglas, William Holden\n\nPrior to succumbing to the attack, Bullard had telegraphed his head office to call a meeting at which he would name an executive vice president as the position had been vacant for several years. Assumed to be the first in line is dyed-in-the-wool company man Fred Alderson (Walter Pidgeon). His ambitious wife (Virginia Brissac) certainly feels entitled to the promotion. Long-time head of production Jesse Grim (Dean Jagger) views it all with the detachment of a man who has decided to retire. Loren Shaw (Fredric March) is a bean counter with one eye on the bottom line and the other on a corner office.\n\nGlad handing salesman Jos Dudley (Paul Douglas) is in the running, but only by virtue of his status as a vice president, not his suitability. If his affair with his secretary Eva (Shelley Winters) was known, Dudley would be counted out. Research and development ace Mcdonald Walling"
