        "text": "Meena Menon Sep 2021\n\nFlicker Shimmer Glow\n\nThe brightest star can shine even with thick black velvet draped over it.\n\nQuartz, lime and salt crystals formed a glass ball.\n\nThe dark womb held me, warm and soft.\n\nMy mom called my cries when I was born the most sorrowful sound she had ever heard.\n\nShe said she’d never heard a baby make a sound like that.\n\nI’d open my eyes in low light until the world’s light healed rather than hurt.\n\nThe summer before eighth grade, July 1992,\n\nI watched a shooting star burn by at 100,000 miles per hour as I stood on the balcony\n\nwhile my family celebrated my birthday inside.\n\nIt made it into the earth’s atmosphere\n\nbut it didn’t look like it was coming down;\n\nI know it didn’t hit the ground but it burned something in the time it was here.\n\nThe glass ball of my life cracked inside.\n\nLight reflected off the salt crystal cracks.\n\nI saw the beauty of the light within.\n\nNacre from my shell kept those cracks from getting worse,\n\na wild pearl as defense mechanism.\n\nIn 2001, I quit my job after they melted and poured tar all over my life.\n\nAll summer literature class bathtubs filled with rose hip oil cleaned the tar.\n\nThat fall logic and epistemology classes spewed black ink all over my philosophy\n\nwritten over ten years then.\n\nTar turned to asphalt when I met someone from my old job for a drink in November\n\nand it paved a road for my life that went to the hospital I was in that December\n\nwhere it sealed the roof on my life\n\nwhen I was almost murdered there\n\nand in February after meeting her for another drink.\n\nThey lit a fire at the top of the glacier and pushed the burning pile of black coal off the edge,\n\nburnt red, looking like flames falling into the valley.\n\nWhile that blazed the side of the cliff something lit an incandescent light.\n\nThe electricity from the metal lightbulb ***** went through wires and heated the filament between until it glowed.\n\nI began putting more work into emotional balance from things I learned at AA meetings.\n\nIn Spring 2003, the damage that the doctors at the hospital in 2001 had done\n\nmade it harder for light to reflect from the cracks in the glass ball.\n\nI’d been eating healthy and trying to get regular exercises since 1994\n\nbut in Spring 2003 I began swimming for an hour every morning .\n\nThe water washed the pollution from the burning coals off\n\nAnd then I escaped in July.\n\nI moved to London to study English Language and Linguistics.\n\nI would’ve studied English Language and Literature.\n\nI did well until Spring 2004 when I thought I was being stalked.\n\nI thought I was manic.\n\nI thought I was being stalked.\n\nI went home and didn’t go back for my exams after spring holiday.\n\nBecause I felt traumatized and couldn’t write poetry anymore,\n\nI used black ink to write my notes for my book on trauma and the Russian Revolution.\n\nI started teaching myself German.\n\nI stayed healthy.\n\nIn 2005, my parents went to visit my mom’s family in Malaysia for two weeks.\n\nI thought I was being stalked.\n\nI knew I wasn’t manic.\n\nI thought I was being stalked.\n\nI told my parents when they came home.\n\nThey thought I was manic.\n\nI showed them the shoe prints in the snow of different sizes from the woods to the windows.\n\nThey thought I was manic.\n\nI was outside of my comfort zone.\n\nI moved to California. I found light.\n\nI made light,\n\nthe light reflected off the salt crystals I used to heal the violence inflicted on me from then on.\n\nThe light turned the traffic lights to not just green from red\n\nbut amber and blue.\n\nThe light turned the car signals left and right.\n\nThe light reflected off of salt crystals, light emitting diodes,\n\nelectrical energy turned directly to light,\n\nelectroluminescence.\n\nThe electrical currents flowed through,\n\nilluminating.\n\nAlone in the world, I moved to California in July 2005\n\nbut in August I called the person I escaped in 2003,\n\nthe sulfur and nitrogen that I hated.\n\nHe didn’t think I was manic but I never said anything.\n\nI never told him why I asked him to move out to California.\n\nWhen his coal seemed like only pollution,\n\nI asked him to leave.\n\nHe threatened me.\n\nI called the authorities.\n\nThey left me there.\n\nHe laughed.\n\nThen the violence came.\n\n****: stabbed and punched, my ****** bruised, purple and swollen.\n\nThe light barely reflected from the glass ball wIth cracks through all the acid rain, smoke and haze.\n\nIt would take me half an hour to get my body to do what my mind told it to after.\n\nMy dad told me my mom had her cancer removed.\n\nThe next day, the coal said if I wanted him to leave he’d leave.\n\nI booked his ticket.\n\nI drove him to the airport.\n\nBlack clouds gushed the night before for the first time in months,\n\nthe sky clear after the rain.\n\nHe was gone and I was free,\n\nmelted glass, heated up and poured—\n\nlooked like fire,\n\nlooked like the Snow Moon in February\n\nwith Mercury in the morning sky.\n\nI worked through ****.\n\nI worked to overcome trauma.\n\nElectricity between touch and love caused acid rain, smoke, haze, and mercury\n\nto light the discharge lamps, streetlights and parking lot lights.\n\nThen I changed the direction of the light waves.\n\nLike lead glass breaks up the light,\n\nlead from the coal, cleaned and replaced by potassium,\n\nglass cut clearly, refracting the light,\n\nelectrolytes,\n\nelectrical signals lit through my body,\n\nthick black velvet drapes gone.\n\nLava\n\nI think that someone wrote into some palm leaf a manuscript, a gift, a contract.\n\nAfter my parents wedding, while they were still in India,\n\nthey found out that my dad’s father and my mom’s grandfather worked for kings administering temples and collecting money for their king from the farmers that worked the rice paddies each king owned. They both left their homes before they left for college.\n\nMy dad, a son of a brahmin’s son,\n\ngrew up in his grandmother’s house.\n\nHis mother was not a Brahmin.\n\nMy mother grew up in Malaysia where she saw the children from the rubber plantation\n\nwhen she walked to school.\n\nShe doesn’t say what caste she is.\n\nHe went to his father’s house, then college.\n\nHe worked, then went to England, then Canada.\n\nShe went to India then Canada.\n\nThey moved to the United States around Christmas 1978\n\nwith my brother while she was pregnant with me.\n\nMy father signed a contract with my mother.\n\nMy parents took ashes and formed rock,\n\nthe residue left in brass pots in India,\n\nthe rocks, so hot, they turned back to lava miles away before turning back to ash again,\n\nthen back to rock,\n\nthe lava from a super volcano,\n\nthe ash purple and red.\n\nCircles on a Moss Covered Volcano\n\nThe eruption beatifies the magma.\n\nIt becomes obsidian,\n\nonly breaks with a fracture,\n\nsmooth circles where it breaks.\n\nMy mom was born on the grass\n\non a lawn\n\nin a moss covered canyon at the top of a volcanic island.\n\nMy grandfather lived in Malaysia before the Japanese occupied.\n\nWhen the volcano erupted,\n\nthe lava dried at the ocean into black sand.\n\nThe British allied with the Communist Party of Malaysia—\n\nafter they organized.\n\nAfter the Americans defeated the Japanese at Pearl Harbor,\n\nthe British took over Malaysia again.\n\nThey kept different groups apart claiming they were helping them.\n\nThe black sand had smooth pebbles and sharp rocks.\n\nEthnic Malay farmers lived in Kampongs, villages.\n\nIndians lived on plantations.\n\nThe Chinese lived in towns and urban areas.\n\nEthnic Malays wanted independence.\n\nIn 1946, after strikes, demonstrations, and boycotts\n\nthe British agreed to work with them.\n\nThe predominantly Chinese Communist Party of Malaysia went underground,\n\nguerrilla warfare against the British,\n\nclaiming their fight was for independence.\n\nFor the British, that emergency required vast powers\n\nof arrest, detention without trial and deportation to defeat terrorism.\n\nThe Emergency became less unpopular as the terrorism became worse.\n\nThe British were the iron that brought oxygen through my mom’s body.\n\nShe loved riding on her father’s motorcycle with him\n\nby the plantations,\n\nthrough the Kampongs\n\nand to the city, half an hour away.\n\nThe British left Malaysia independent in 1957\n\nwith Malaysian nationalists holding most state and federal government offices.\n\nAs the black sand stretches towards the ocean,\n\nit becomes big stones of dried lava, flat and smooth.\n\nMy mom thought her father and her uncle were subservient to the British.\n\nShe thought all things, all people were equal.\n\nWhen her father died when she was 16, 1965,\n\nthey moved to India,\n\nmy mother,\n\na foreigner in India, though she’s Indian.\n\nShe loved rock and roll and mini skirts\n\nand didn’t speak the local language.\n\nOn the dried black lava,\n\nit can be hard to know the molten lava flickers underneath there.\n\nBefore the Korean War,\n\nthough Britain and the United States wanted\n\nan aggressive resolution\n\ncondemning North Korea,\n\nthey were happy\n\nthat India supported a draft resolution\n\ncondemning North Korea\n\nfor breach of the peace.\n\nDuring the Korean War,\n\nIndia, supported by Third World and other Commonwealth nations,\n\nopposed United States’ proposals.\n\nThey were able to change the U.S. resolution\n\nto include the proposals they wanted\n\nand helped end the war.\n\nChina wanted the respect of Third World nations\n\nand saw the United States as imperialist.\n\nChina thought India was a threat to the Third World\n\nby taking aid from the United States and the Soviets.\n\nPakistan could help with that and a seat at the United Nations.\n\nChina wanted Taiwan’s seat at the UN.\n\nMy mother went to live with her uncle,\n\na communist negotiator for a corporation,\n\nin India.\n\nA poet,\n\nhe threw parties and invited other artists, musicians and writers.\n\nI have the same brown hyperpigmentation at my joints that he had.\n\nDuring the day, only the steam from the hot lava can be seen.\n\nIn 1965, Pakistani forces went into Jammu and Kashmir with China’s support.\n\nChina threatened India after India sent its troops in.\n\nThen they threatened again before sending their troops to the Indian border.\n\nThe United States stopped aid to Pakistan and India.\n\nPakistan agreed to the UN ceasefire agreement.\n\nPakistan helped China get a seat at the UN\n\nand tried to keep the west from escalating in Vietnam.\n\nThe smoldering sound of the lava sizzles underneath the dried lava.\n\nWhen West Pakistan refused to allow East Pakistan independence,\n\nviolence between Bengalis and Biharis developed into upheaval.\n\nBengalis moved to India\n\nand India went into East Pakistan.\n\nPakistan surrendered in December 1971.\n\nEast Pakistan became independent Bangladesh\n\nThe warm light of the melted lava radiates underneath but burns.\n\nIn 1974, India tested the Smiling Buddha,\n\na nuclear bomb.\n\nAfter Indira Gandhi’s conviction for election fraud in 1973,\n\nMarxist Professor Narayan called for total revolution\n\nand students protested all over India.\n\nWith food shortages, inflation and regional disputes\n\nlike Sikh separatists training in Pakistan for an independent Punjab,\n\npeasants and laborers joined the protests.\n\nRailway strikes stopped the economy.\n\nIn 1975, Indira Gandhi, the Iron Lady,\n\ndeclared an Emergency,\n\nimprisoning political opponents, restricting freedoms and restricting the press,\n\nclaiming threats to national security\n\nbecause the war with Pakistan had just ended.\n\nThe federal government took over Kerala’s communist dominated government and others.\n\nMy mom could’ve been a dandelion, but she’s more like thistle.\n\nShe has the center that dries and flutters in the wind,\n\nbeautiful and silky,\n\nspiny and prickly,\n\nbut still fluffy, downy,\n\nA daisy.\n\nThey say thistle saved Scotland from the Norse.\n\nMagma from the volcano explodes\n\nand the streams of magma fly into the air.\n\nIn the late 60s,\n\nthe civil rights movement rose\n\nagainst the state in Northern Ireland\n\nfor depriving Catholics\n\nof influence and opportunity.\n\nThe Northern Irish police,\n\nProtestant and unionist, anti-catholic,\n\nresponded violently to the protests and it got worse.\n\nIn 1969, the British placed Arthur Young,\n\nwho had worked at the Federation of Malaya\n\nat the time of their Emergency\n\nat the head of the British military in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe British military took control over the police,\n\na counter insurgency rather than a police force,\n\ncrowd control, house searches, interrogation, and street patrols,\n\nuse of force against suspects and uncooperative citizens.\n\nPolitical crimes were tolerated by Protestants but not Catholics.\n\nThe lava burns the rock off the edge of the volcano.\n\nOn January 30, 1972, ****** Sunday,\n\nBritish Army policing killed 13 unarmed protesters\n\nfighting for their rights over their neighborhood,\n\nprotesting the internment of suspected nationalists.\n\nThat led to protests across Ireland.\n\nWhen banana leaves are warmed,\n\noil from the banana leaves flavors the food.\n\nMy dad flew from Canada to India in February 1972.\n\nOn February 4, my dad met my mom.\n\nOn February 11, 1972,\n\nmy dad married my mom.\n\nThey went to Canada,\n\na quartz singing bowl and a wooden mallet wrapped in suede.\n\nThe rock goes down with the lava, breaking through the rocks as it goes down.\n\nIn March 1972, the British government took over\n\nbecause they considered the Royal Ulster Police and the Ulster Special Constabulary\n\nto be causing most of the violence.\n\nThe lava blocks and reroutes streams,\n\nmelts snow and ice,\n\nflooding.\n\nDays later, there’s still smoke, red.\n\nMy mom could wear the clothes she liked\n\nwithout being judged\n\nwith my dad in Canada.\n\nShe didn’t like asking my dad for money.\n\nMy dad, the copper helping my mother use that iron,\n\nwanted her to go to college and finish her bachelors degree.\n\nShe got a job.\n\nIn 1976, the police took over again in Northern Ireland\n\nbut they were a paramilitary force—\n\narmored SUVs, bullet proof jackets, combat ready\n\nwith the largest computerized surveillance system in the UK,\n\nhigh powered weapons,\n\ntrained in counter insurgency.\n\nMany people were murdered by the police\n\nand few were held accountable.\n\nMost of the murdered people were not involved in violence or crime.\n\nPeople were arrested under special emergency powers\n\nfor interrogation and intelligence gathering.\n\nPeople tried were tried in non-jury courts.\n\nMy mom learned Malayalam in India\n\nbut didn’t speak well until living with my dad.\n\nShe also learned to cook after getting married.\n\nHer mother sent her recipes; my dad cooked for her—\n\nturmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne and green chiles.\n\nHaving lived in different countries,\n\nmy mom’s food was exposed to many cultures,\n\nChinese and French.\n\nGround rock, minerals and glass\n\ncovered the ground\n\nfrom the ash plume.\n\nShe liked working.\n\nA volcano erupted for 192 years,\n\nan ice age,\n\ndisordered ices, deformed under pressure\n\nand ordered ice crystals, brittle in the ice core records.\n\nMy mother liked working.\n\nThough Khomeini was in exile by the 1970s in Iran,\n\nmore people, working and poor,\n\nturned to him and the ****-i-Ulama for help.\n\nMy mom didn’t want kids though my dad did.\n\nShe agreed and in 1978 my brother was born.\n\nIran modernized but agriculture and industry changed so quickly.\n\nIn January 1978, students protested—\n\ncensorship, surveillance, harassment, illegal detention and torture.\n\nYoung people and the unemployed joined.\n\nMy parents moved to the United States in December 1978.\n\nThe regime used a lot of violence against the protesters,\n\nand in September 1978 declared martial law in Iran.\n\nTroops were shooting demonstrators.\n\nIn January 1979, the Shah and his family fled.\n\nOn February 11, 1979, my parents’ anniversary,\n\nthe Iranian army declared neutrality.\n\nI was born in July 1979.\n\nThe chromium in emeralds and rubies colors them.\n\nMy brother was born in May and I was born in July.\n\nObsidian—\n\niron, copper and chromium—\n\nisn’t a gas\n\nbut it isn’t a crystal;\n\nit’s between the two,\n\nthe ordered crystal and the disordered gas.\n\nThey made swords out of obsidian.\n\nWarm Light Shatters\n\nThe eruption beatifies the magma.\n\nIt becomes obsidian,\n\nonly breaks with a fracture,\n\nsmooth circles where it breaks.\n\nMy dad was born on a large flat rock on the edge of the top\n\nof a hill,\n\nMolasses, sweet and dark, the potent flavor dominates,\n\nHis father, the son of a Brahmin,\n\nHis mother from a lower caste.\n\nHis father’s family wouldn’t touch him,\n\nHe grew up in his mother’s mother’s house on a farm.\n\nI have the same brown hyperpigmentation spot on my right hand that he has.\n\nIn 1901, D’Arcy bought a 60 year concession for oil exploration In Iran.\n\nThe Iranian government extended it for another 32 years in 1933.\n\nAt that time oil was Iran’s “main source of income.”\n\nIn 1917’s Balfour Declaration, the British government proclaimed that they favored a national home for the Jews in Palestine and their “best endeavors to facilitate the achievement” of that.\n\nThe British police were in charge of policing in the mandate of Palestine. A lot of the policemen they hired were people who had served in the British army before, during the Irish War for Independence.\n\nThe army tried to stop how violent the police were, police used torture and brutality, some that had been used during the Irish War for Independence, like having prisoners tied to armored cars and locomotives and razing the homes of people in prison or people they thought were related to people thought to be rebels.\n\nThe police hired Arab police and Jewish police for lower level policing,\n\nMaking local people part of the management.\n\n“Let Arab police beat up Arabs and Jewish police beat up Jews.”\n\nThe lava blocks and reroutes streams, melts snow and ice, flooding.\n\nIn 1922, there were 83,000 Jews, 71,000 Christians, and 589,000 Muslims.\n\nThe League If Nations endorsed the British Mandate.\n\nDuring an emergency, in the 1930s, British regulations allowed collective punishment, punishing villages for incidents.\n\nLocal officers in riots often deserted and also shared intelligence with their own people.\n\nThe police often stole, destroyed property, tortured and killed people.\n\nArab revolts sapped the police power over Palestinians by 1939.\n\nMy father’s mother was from a matrilineal family.\n\nMy dad remembers tall men lining up on pay day to respectfully wait for her, 5 feet tall.\n\nShe married again after her husband died.\n\nA manager from a tile factory,\n\nHe spoke English so he supervised finances and correspondence.\n\nMy dad, a sunflower, loved her: she scared all the workers but exuded warmth to the people she loved.\n\nObsidian shields people from negative energy.\n\nDavid Cargill founded the Burmah Oil Co. in 1886.\n\nIf there were problems with oil exploration in Burma and Indian government licenses, Persian oil would protect the company.\n\nIn July 1906, many European oil companies, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and others, allied to protect against the American oil company, Standard Oil.\n\nD’Arcy needed money because “Persian oil took three times as long to come on stream as anticipated.”\n\nBurmah Oil Co. began the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. as a subsidiary.\n\nNinety-seven percent of British Petroleum was owned by Burmah Oil Co.\n\nBy 1914, the British government owned 51% of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co.\n\nAnglo-Persian acquired independence from Burmah Oil and Royal Dutch Shell with two million pounds from the British government.\n\nThe lava burns the rock off the edge of the volcano.\n\nIn 1942, after the Japanese took Burma,\n\nthe British destroyed their refineries before leaving.\n\nThe United Nations had to find other sources of oil.\n\nIn 1943, Japan built the Burma-Thailand Railroad with forced labor from the Malay peninsula who were mostly from the rubber plantations.\n\nThe rock goes down with the lava, breaking through the rocks as it goes down.\n\nIn 1945. Japan destroyed their refineries before leaving Burma.\n\nCargill, Watson and Whigham were on the Burmah Oil Co. Board and then the Anglo Iranian Oil Co. Board.\n\nIn 1936 Palestine, boycotts, work stoppages, and violence against British police officials and soldiers compelled the government to appoint an investigatory commission.\n\nLeaders of Egypt, Trans Jordan, Syria and Iraq helped end the work stoppages.\n\nThe British government had the Peel Commission read letters, memoranda, and petitions and speak with British officials, Jews and Arabs.\n\nThe Commission didn’t believe that Arabs and Jews could live together in a single Jewish state.\n\nBecause of administrative and financial difficulties the Colonial Secretary stated that to split Palestine into Arab and Jewish states was impracticable.\n\nThe Commission recommended transitioning 250,000 Arabs and 1500 Jews with British control over their oil pipeline, their naval base and Jerusalem.\n\nThe League of Nations approved.\n\n“It will not remove the grievance nor prevent the recurrence,” Lord Peel stated after.\n\nThe Arab uprising was much more militant after Peel. Thousands of Arabs were wounded, ten thousand were detained.\n\nIn Sykes-Picot and the Husain McMahon agreements, the British promised the Arabs an independent state but they did not keep that promise.\n\nRepresentatives from the Arab states rejected the Peel recommendations.\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly Resolution181 partitioned Palestine into Arab and Jewish states with an international regime for the city of Jerusalem backed by the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Israeli Yishuv had strong military and intelligence organization —-\n\nthe British recognized that their interest was with the Arabs and abstained from the vote.\n\nIn 1948, Israel declared the establishment of its state.\n\nGround rock, minerals, and gas covered the ground from the ash plume.\n\nThe Palestinian police force was disbanded and the British gave officers the option of serving in Malaya.\n\nThough Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy supported snd tried to get Israel to offer the Arabs concessions, it wasn’t a major priority and didn’t always approve of Israel’s plans.\n\nArabs that had supported the British to end Turkish rule stopped supporting the West.\n\nMany Palestinians joined left wing groups and violent third world movements.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of the territory of former Palestine was under Israel’s control.\n\nMy dad left for college in 1957 and lived in an apartment above the United States Information services office.\n\nBecause he graduated at the top of his class, he was given a job with the public works department of the government on the electricity board.\n\n“Once in, you’ll never leave.”\n\nWhen he wanted a job where he could do real work, his father was upset.\n\nHe broke the chains with bells for vespers.\n\nHe got a job in Calcutta at Kusum Products and left the government, though it was prestigious to work there.\n\nIn the chemical engineering division, one of the projects he worked on was to design a *** distillery, bells controlled by hammers, hammers controlled by a keyboard.\n\nHis boss worked in the United Kingdom for. 20 years before the company he worked at, part of Power Gas Corporation, asked him to open a branch in Calcutta.\n\nHe opened the branch and convinced an Industrialist to open a company doing the same work with him. The branch he opened closed after that.\n\nMy dad applied for labor certification to work abroad and was selected.\n\nHis boss wrote a reference letter for my him to the company he left in the UK. My dad sent it telling the company when he was leaving for the UK.\n\nThe day he left for London, he got the letter they sent in the mail telling him to take the train to Sheffield the next day and someone from the firm would meet him at the station.\n\nHis dad didn’t know he left, he didn’t tell him.\n\nHe broke the chains with chimes for schisms.\n\nAnglo-Persian Oil became Anglo-Iranian Oil in 1935.\n\nThe British government used oil and Anglo-Persian oil to fight communism, have a stronger relationship with the United States and make the United Kingdom more powerful.\n\nThe National Secularists, the Tudeh, and the Communists wanted to nationalize Iran’s oil and mobilized the Iranian people.\n\nThe British feared nationalization in Iran would incite political parties like the Secular Nationalists all over the world.\n\nIn 1947, the Iranian government passed the Single Article Law that “[increased] investment In welfare benefits, health, housing, education, and implementation of Iranianization through substitution of foreigners” at Anglo-Iranian Oil Co.\n\n“Anglo-Iranian Oil Company made more profit in 1950 than it paid to the Iranian government in royalties over the previous half century.”\n\nThe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company tried to negotiate a new concession and claimed they’d hire more Iranian people into jobs held by British and people from other nationalities at the company.\n\nTheir hospitals had segregated wards.\n\nOn May 1, 1951, the Iranian government passed a bill that nationalized Anglo- Iranian Oil Co.’s holdings.\n\nDuring the day, only the steam from the hot lava can be seen.\n\nIn August 1953, the Iranian people elected Mossadegh from the Secular Nationalist Party as prime minister.\n\nThe British government with the CIA overthrew Mossadegh using the Iranian military after inducing protests and violent demonstrations.\n\nAnglo-Iranian Oil changed its name to British Petroleum in 1954.\n\nIranians believe that America destroyed Iran’s “last chance for democracy” and blamed America for Iran’s autocracy, its human rights abuses, and secret police.\n\nThe smoldering sound of the lava sizzles underneath the dried lava.\n\nIn 1946, Executive Yuan wanted control over 4 groups of Islands in the South China Sea to have a stronger presence there: the Paracels, the Spratlys, Macclesfield Bank, and the Pratas.\n\nThe French forces in the South China Sea would have been stronger than the Chinese Navy then.\n\nFrench Naval forces were in the Gulf of Tonkin, U.S. forces were in the Taiwan Strait, the British were in Hong Kong, and the Portuguese were in Macao.\n\nIn the 1950s, British snd U.S. oil companies thought there might be oil in the Spratlys.\n\nBy 1957, French presence in the South China Sea was hardly there.\n\nWhen the volcano erupted, the lava dried at the ocean into black sand.\n\nBy 1954, the Tudeh Party’s communist movement and intelligence organization had been destroyed.\n\nBecause of the Shah and his government’s westernization policies and disrespectful treatment of the Ulama, Iranians began identifying with the Ulama and Khomeini rather than their government.\n\nThose people joined with secular movements to overthrow the Shah.\n\nIn 1966, Ne Win seized power from U Nu in Burma.\n\n“Soldiers ruled Burma as soldiers.”\n\nNe Win thought that western political\n\nInstitutions “encouraged divisions.”\n\nMinority groups found foreign support for their separatist goals.\n\nThe Karens and the Mons supported U Nu in Bangkok.\n\nRare copper, a heavy metal, no alloys,\n\na rock in groundwater,\n\nconducts electricity and heat.\n\nIn 1965, my Dad’s cousin met him at Heathrow, gave him a coat and £10 and brought him to a bed and breakfast across from Charing Cross Station where he’d get the train to Sheffield the next morning.\n\nHe took the train and someone met him at the train station.\n\nAt the interview they asked him to design a grandry girder, the main weight bearing steel girder as a test.\n\nIron in the inner and outer core of the earth,\n\nHe’d designed many of those.\n\nHe was hired and lived at the YMCA for 2 1/2 years.\n\nHe took his mother’s family name, Menon, instead of his father’s, Varma.\n\nIn 1967, he left for Canada and interviewed at Bechtel before getting hired at Seagrams.\n\nIron enables blood to carry oxygen.\n\nHis boss recommended him for Dale Carnegie’s leadership training classes and my dad joined the National Instrument Society and became President.\n\nHe designed a still In Jamaica,\n\nOrdered all the parts, nuts and bolts,\n\nHad all the parts shipped to Jamaica and made sure they got there.\n\nHis boss supervised the construction, installation and commission in Jamaica.\n\nQuartz, heat and fade resistant, though he was an engineer and did the work of an engineer, my dad only had the title, technician so my dad’s boss thought he wasn’t getting paid enough but couldn’t get his boss to offer more than an extra $100/week or the title of engineer; he told my dad he thought he should leave.\n\nIn 1969, he got a job at Celanese, which made rayon.\n\nHe quit Celanese to work at McGill University and they allowed him to take classes to earn his MBA while working.\n\nThe United States and Israel’s alliance was strong by 1967.\n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 242 at the end of the Third Arab Israeli War didn’t mention the Palestinians but mentioned the refugee problem.\n\nAfter 1967, the Palestinians weren’t often mentioned and when mentioned only as terrorists.\n\nPalestinians’ faith in the “American sponsored peace process” diminished, they felt the world community ignored and neglected them also.\n\nGroups like MAN that stopped expecting anything from Arab regimes began hijacking airplanes.\n\nBy 1972, the Palestine Liberation Organization had enough international support to get by the United States’ veto in the United Nations Security Council and Arab League recognition as representative of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe Palestinians knew the United States stated its support, as the British had, but they weren’t able to accomplish anything.\n\nThe force Israel exerted in Johnson’s United States policy delivered no equilibrium for the Palestinians.\n\nIn 1969, all political parties submitted to the BSPP, Burma Socialist Programme Party.\n\nNe Win nationalized banks and oil and deprived minorities of opportunities.\n\nNe Win became U Nu Win, civilian leader of Burma in 1972 and stopped the active role that U Nu defined for Burma internationally\n\nHe put military people in power even when they didn’t have experience which triggered “maldistribution of goods and chronic shortages.”\n\nResources were located in areas where separatist minorities had control.\n\nThe British presence in the South China Sea ended in 1968.\n\nThe United States left Vietnam in 1974 and China went into the Western Paracels.\n\nThe U.S. didn’t intervene and Vietnam took the Spratlys.\n\nChina wanted to claim the continental shelf In the central part of the South China Sea and needed the Spratlys.\n\nThe United States mostly disregarded the Ulama In Iran and bewildered the Iranian people by not supporting their revolution.\n\nObsidian—\n\niron, copper and chromium—\n\nisn’t a gas\n\nbut it isn’t a crystal;\n\nit’s between the two,\n\nthe ordered crystal and the disordered gas.\n\nThey made swords out of obsidian.\n\nEdelweiss\n\nI laid out in my backyard in my bikini.\n\nI love the feeling of my body in the sun.\n\nI’d be dark from the end of spring until winter.\n\nThe snow froze my bare feet through winter ,\n\nmy skin pale.\n\nAmerican towns in 1984,\n\nFree, below glaciers the sunlight melted the snow,\n\na sea of green and the edelweiss on the edge of the limestone,\n\nfrosted but still strong.\n\nWhen the spring warmed the grass,\n\nthe grass warmed my feet.\n\nThe whole field looked cold and white from the glacier but in the meadow,\n\nthe bright yellow centers of those flowers float free in the center of the white petals.\n\nThe bright yellow center of those edelweiss scared the people my parents ran to America from India to get away from.\n\nOn a sidewalk in Queens, New York in 1991, the men stared and yelled comments at me in short shorts and a fitted top in the summer.\n\nI grabbed my dad’s arm.\n\nThe Bread and Coconut Butter of Aparigraha\n\nTwelve year old flowerhead,\n\nMarigold, yarrow and nettle,\n\nI’d be all emotion\n\nIf not for all my work\n\nFrom the time I was a teenager.\n\nI got depressed a lot.\n\nI related to people I read about\n\nIn my weather balloon,\n\nGrasping, ignorant, and desperate,\n\nBut couldn’t relate to other twelve year olds.\n\nAfter school I read Dali’s autobiography,\n\nYoung ****** Autosodomized by Her Own Chastity.\n\nFresh, green nettle with fresh and dried yarrow for purity.\n\nDead souls enticed to the altar by orange marigolds,\n\npassion and creativity,\n\nCoax sleep and rouse dreams.\n\nSatellites measure indirectly with wave lengths of light.\n\nMy weather balloon measures the lower and middle levels of the atmosphere directly,\n\nFifty thousand feet high,\n\nMetal rod thermometer,\n\nSlide humidity sensor,\n\nCanister for air pressure.\n\nI enjoy rye bread and cold coconut butter in my weather balloon,\n\nBut I want Dali, and all the artists and writers.\n\nRye grows at high altitudes\n\nBut papyrus grows in soil and shallow water,\n\nStrips of papyrus pith shucked from their stems.\n\nWhen an anchor’s weighed, a ship sails,\n\nBut when grounded we sail.\n\nMarigolds, yarrow and nettle,\n\nFlowerhead,\n\nI use the marigold for sleep,\n\nThe yarrow for endurance and intensity,\n\ntoiling for love and truth,\n\nAnd the nettle for healing.\n\nStrong rye bread needs equally strong flavors.\n\nBy the beginning of high school,\n\nI read a lot of Beat literature\n\nAnd found Buddhism.\n\nI loved what I read\n\nBut I didn’t like some things.\n\nI liked attachment.\n\nI got to the ground.\n\nMushrooms grow in dry soil.\n\nAttachment to beauty is Buddha activity.\n\nNot being attached to things I don’t find beautiful is Buddha activity.\n\nI fried mushrooms in a single layer in oil, fleshy.\n\nI roasted mushrooms at high temperatures in the oven, crisp.\n\nI simmered mushrooms in stock with kombu.\n\nRye bread with cold coconut butter and cremini mushrooms,\n\nraw, soft and firm.\n\nLife continues, life changes,\n\nAttachments, losses, mourning and suffering,\n\nBut change lures growth.\n\nI find stream beds and wet soil.\n\nI lay the strips of papyrus next to each other.\n\nI cross papyrus strips over the first,\n\nThen wet the crossed papyrus strips,\n\nPress and cement them into a sheet.\n\nI hammer it and dry it in the sun,\n\nWith no thought of achievement or self,\n\nFlowerhead,\n\nHands filled with my past,\n\nHead filled with the future,\n\nDali, artists poets,\n\nWishes and desires aligned with nature,\n\nAbundance,\n\nCocoa, caraway, and molasses.\n\nIf I ever really like someone,\n\nI’ll be wearing the dress he chooses,\n\nFresh green nettle and yarrow, the seeds take two years to grow strong,\n\nLasting love.\n\nMarigolds steer dead souls from the altar to the afterlife,\n\nAntiseptic, healing wounds,\n\nSoothing sore throats and headaches.\n\nImperturbable, stable flowerhead,\n\nI empty my mind.\n\nWhen desires are aligned with nature, desire flows.\n\nPapyrus makes paper and cloth.\n\nPapyrus makes sails.\n\nCharcoal from the ash of pulverized papyrus heals wounds.\n\nWithout attachment to the fruit of action\n\nThere is continuation of life,\n\nRye bread and melted coconut butter,\n\nThe coconut tree in the coconut butter,\n\nThe seed comes from the ground out of nothing,\n\nNaturalness.\n\nIt has form.\n\nAs the seed grows the seed expresses the tree,\n\nThe seed expresses the coconut,\n\nThe seed expresses the coconut butter.\n\nRye bread, large open hollows, chambers,\n\nImmersed in melted coconut butter,\n\nDesire for expansion and creation,\n\nNo grasping, not desperate.\n\nWhen the mind is compassion, the mind is boundless.\n\nEvery moment,\n\nonly that,\n\nEvery moment,\n\na scythe to the papyrus in the stream bed of the past.\n\nSound on Powdery Blue\n\nPotter’s clay, nymph, plum unplumbed, 1993.\n\nDahlia, ice, powder, musk and rose,\n\nmy source of life emerged in darkness, blackness.\n\nSeashell fragments in the sand,\n\nThe glass ball of my life cracked inside,\n\nLight reflected off the salt crystal cracks,\n\nNacre kept those cracks from getting worse.\n\nYoung ****** Autosodomized By Her Own Chastity,\n\nNymph, I didn’t want to give my body,\n\nTorn, *****, ballgown,\n\nTo people who wouldn’t understand me,\n\nPiquant.\n\nOutside on the salt flats,\n\nAphrodite, goddess of beauty, pleasure and fertility and\n\nAsexual Artemis, goddess of animals, and the hunt,\n\nMistress of nymphs,\n\nPunish with ruthless savagery.\n\nIn my bedroom, blue caribou moss covered rocks, pine, and yew trees,\n\nThe heartwood writhes as hurricane gales, twisters and whirlwinds\n\nContort their bark,\n\nRoots strong in the soil.\n\nOrris root dried in the sun, bulbs like wood.\n\nDahlia runs to baritone soundbath radio waves.\n\nLight has frequencies,\n\nViolet between blue and invisible ultraviolet,\n\nFlame, slate and flint.\n\nEvery night is cold.\n\nTorii gates, pain secured as sacred.\n\nAn assignation, frost hardy dahlia and a plangent resonant echo.\n\nHigh frequency sound waves convert to electrical signals,\n\nBreathe from someone I want,\n\nSilt.\n\nBeam, radiate, ensorcel.\n\nI break the bark,\n\nSap flows and dries,\n\nResin seals over the tear.\n\nI distill pine,\n\nResin and oil for turpentine, a solvent.\n\nQuiver, bemired,\n\nI lead sound into my darkness,\n\nOrris butter resin, sweet and warm,\n\nHot jam drops on snow drops,\n\nOrange ash on smoke,\n\nBalm on lava,\n\nThe problem with cotton candy.\n\nElectrical signals give off radiation or light waves,\n\nThe narrow frequency range where\n\nThe crest of a radio wave and the crest of a light wave overlap,\n\nInfrared.\n\nGlaciers flow, sunlight melts the upper layers of the snow when strong,\n\nA wet snow avalanche,\n\nA torrent, healing.\n\nBrown sugar and whiskey,\n\nUndulant, lavender.\n\nPine pitch, crystalline, sticky, rich and golden,\n\nAnd dried pine rosin polishes glass smooth\n\nLike the smell of powdery orris after years.\n\nSoftness, flush, worthy/not worthy,\n\nRich rays thunder,\n\nIntensify my pulse,\n\nFrenzied red,\n\nViolet between blue and invisible ultraviolet.\n\nBabylon—flutter, glow.\n\nUnquenchable cathartic orris.\n\nPink Graphite\n\nCamellias, winter shrubs,\n\nTheir shallow roots grow beneath the spongy caribou moss,\n\nRobins egg blue.\n\nAfter writing a play with my gifted students program in 1991,\n\nI stopped spending all my free time writing short stories,\n\nBut the caribou moss was still soft.\n\nIn the cold Arctic of that town,\n\nThe evergreen protected the camellias from the afternoon sun and storms.\n\nThey branded hardy camellias with a brass molded embossing iron;\n\nI had paper and graphite for my pencils.\n\nAfter my ninth grade honors English teacher asked us to write poems in 1994,\n\nIt began raining.\n\nWe lived on an overhang.\n\nA vertical rise to the top of the rock.\n\nThe rainstorm caused a metamorphic change in the snowpack,\n\nA wet snow avalanche drifted slowly down the moss covered rock,\n\nThe snow already destabilized by exposure to the sunlight.\n\nThe avalanche formed lakes,\n\nrock basins washed away with rainwater and melted snow,\n\nStreams dammed by the rocks.\n\nMy pencils washed away in the avalanche,\n\nMy clothes heavy and cold.\n\nI wove one side of each warp fiber through the eye of the needle and one side through each slot,\n\nSalves, ointments, serums and tinctures.\n\nI was mining for graphite.\n\nThey were mining me,\n\nThe only winch, the sound through the water.\n\nA steep staircase to the red Torii gates,\n\nI broke the chains with bells for vespers\n\nAnd chimes for schisms,\n\nAnd wove the weft across at right angles to the warp.\n\nOn a rocky ledge at the end of winter,\n\nThe pink moon, bitters and body butter,\n\nThey tried to get me to want absinthe,\n\nWormwood for bitterness and regret.\n\nHeat and pressure formed carbon for flakes of graphite.\n\nHeat and pressure,\n\nI made bitters,\n\nBrandy, grapefruit, chocolate, mandarin rind, tamarind and sugar.\n\nI grounded my feet in the pink moss,\n\npaper dried in one hand,\n\nand graphite for my pencils in the other.\n\nFlakes\n\nI don’t let people that put me down be part of my life.\n\nGardens and trees,\n\nMy shadow sunk in the grass in my yard\n\nAs I ate bread, turmeric and lemon.\n\nCarbon crystallizes into graphite flakes.\n\nI write to see well,\n\nGraphite on paper.\n\nA shadow on rock tiles with a shield, a diamond and a bell\n\nHad me ***** to humiliate me.\n\nThough I don’t let people that put me down near me,\n\nA lot of people putting me down seemed like they were following me,\n\nA platform to jump from\n\nWhile she had her temple.\n\nThere was a pink door to the platform.\n\nI ate bread with caramelized crusts and\n\nDrank turmeric lemonade\n\nBefore I opened that door,\n\nJumped and\n\nDescended into blankets and feathers.\n\nI found matches and rosin\n\nFor turpentine to clean,\n\nDried plums and licorice.\n\nIn the temple,\n\nIn diamonds, leather, wool and silk,\n\nShe had her shield and bells,\n\nDrugs and technology,\n\nThermovision 210 and Minox,\n\nAnd an offering box where people believed\n\nThat if their coins went in\n\nTheir wishes would come true.\n\nHollyhock and smudging charcoal for work,\n\nBelled,\n\nI ground grain in the mill for the bread I baked for breakfast.\n\nThe bells are now communal bells\n\nWith a watchtower and a prison,\n\nHer shield, a blowtorch and flux,\n\nHer ex rays, my makeshift records\n\nBecause Stalin didn’t like people dancing,\n\nHe liked them divebombing.\n\nImpurities in the carbon prevent diamonds from forming,\n\nMeasured,\n\nThe most hard, the most expensive,\n\nBut graphite’s soft delocalized electrons move.\n\nOCEAN BED\n\nThe loneliness of going to sleep by myself.\n\nI want a bed that’s high off the ground,\n\na mattress, an ocean.\n\nI want a crush and that person in my bed.\n\nOnly that,\n\na crush in my bed,\n\nan ocean in my bed.\n\nJust love.\n\nBut I sleep with my thumbs sealed.\n\nI sleep with my hands, palms up.\n\nI sleep with my hands at my heart.\n\nThey sear my compassion with their noise.\n\nThey hold their iron over their fire and try to carve their noise into my love,\n\nscored by the violence of voices, dark and lurid,\n\nbut not burned.\n\nI want a man in my bed.\n\nWhen I wake up in an earthquake\n\nI want to be held through the aftershocks.\n\nI like men,\n\nthe waves come in and go out\n\nbut the ocean was part of my every day.\n\nI don’t mind being fetishized in the ocean.\n\nI ran by the ocean every morning.\n\nI surfed in the ocean.\n\nI should’ve gone into the ocean that afternoon at Trestles,\n\nholding my water jugs, kneeling at the edge.\n\nMorning\n\nI want to fall asleep in the warm arms of a fireman.\n\nI want to wake up to the smell of coffee in my kitchen.\n\nMorning—the molten lava in the outer core of the earth embeds the iron from the inner core into the earth’s magnetic field.\n\nThe magnetic field flips.\n\nThe sun, so strong, where it gets through the trees it burns everything but the pine.\n\nThe winds change direction.\n\nStorms cast lightening and rain.\n\nIron conducts solar flares and the heavy wind.\n\nIn that pine forest, I shudder every time I see a speck of light for fear of neon and fluorescents. The eucalyptus cleanses congestion.\n\nAnd Kerouac’s stream ululates, crystal bowl sound baths.\n\nI follow the sound to the water.\n\nThe stream ends at a bluff with a thin rocky beach below.\n\nThe green water turns black not far from the shore.\n\nBefore diving into the ocean, I eat globe mallow from the trees, stems and leaves, the viscous flesh, red, soft and nutty.\n\nI distill the pine from one of the tree’s bark and smudge the charcoal over my skin.\n\nDeath, the palo santo’s lit, cleansing negative energy.\n\nIt’s been so long since I’ve smelled a man, woodsmoke, citrus and tobacco.\n\nJasmine, plum, lime and tuberose oil on the base of my neck comforts.\n\nParabolic chambers heal, sound waves through water travel four times faster.\n\nThe sound of the open sea recalibrates.\n\nI dissolve into the midnight blue of the ocean.\n\nI want to fall asleep in the warm arms of a fireman.\n\nI want to wake up to the smell of coffee in my kitchen.\n\nI want hot water with coconut oil when I get up.\n\nWe’d lay out on the lawn, surrounded by high trees that block the wind.\n\nEmbers flying through the air won’t land in my yard, on my grass, or near my trees.\n\nBlue Paper\n\nHaze scatters blue light on a planet.\n\nFrought women, livid, made into peonies by Aphrodites that caught their men flirting and blamed the women, flushed red.\n\nand blamed the women, flushed red.\n\nFrought women, livid, chrysanthemums, dimmed until the end of the season, exchanged and retained like property.\n\nBlue women enter along the sides of her red Torii gates, belayed, branded and belled, a plangent sound.\n\nBy candles, colored lights and dried flowers she’s sitting inside on a concrete floor, punctures and ruin burnished with paper, making burnt lime from lime mortar.\n\nGlass ***** on the ceiling, she moves the beads of a Palestinian glass bead bracelet she holds in her hands.\n\nShe bends light to make shadows against thin wooden slats curbed along the wall, and straight across the ceiling.\n\nA metier, she makes tinctures, juniper berries and cotton *****.\n\nLoamy soil in the center of the room,\n\nA hawthorn tree stands alone,\n\nA gateway for fairies.\n\nlarge stones at the base protecting,\n\nIt’s branches a barrier.\n\nIt’s leaves and shoots make bread and cheese.\n\nIt’s berries, red skin and yellow flesh, make jam.\n\nGreen bamboo stakes for the peonies when they whither from the weight of their petals.\n\nAnd lime in the soil.\n\nShe adds wood chips to the burnt lime in the kiln,\n\nUnrolled paper, spools, and wire hanging.\n\nWood prayer beads connect her to the earth,\n\nThe tassels on the end of the beads connect her to spirit, to higher truth.\n\nMinerals, marine mud and warm basins of seawater on a flower covered desk.\n\nShe adds slaked lime to the burnt lime and wood chips.\n\nThe lime converts to paper,\n\nTrauma victims speak,\n\nLight through butterfly wings.\n\nShe’s plumeria with curved petals, thick, holding water\n\nThis is what I have written of my book. I’ll be changing where the poems with the historical research go. There are four more of those and nine of the other poems.\n\nMateuš Conrad Jan 2022\n\npromise me! promise me to get me out of this hell-hole i put myself in! promise me! i don't know why i put myself through, several days of transcribing a snippet, this was merely a snippet from Kierkegaard's oeuvre, but, how unbelievable! each word was a labour, prop up the book in the right place, read, don't look at the keyboard, let the devil find work for idle hands... look for the devil who would be able to write like he might read Braille! my god, the punctuation, ****** an elephant's ***...the essential Kierkegaard - edited by howard v. hong & edna h. hong: hurt my sensibilities, or, rather, my pedantry, when it comes to punctuation... transcribing is not plagiarism... its brick-layer toils... one word, after another... if i were translating from Danish, i think i'd punctuate the text better: to give it some... panache! some: oomph! you know? this is my dedication, i'm supposed to be awake at 7am... i already shined my shoes, i've already prepped my white shirt, black trousers, black clip on tie, i have my papers (credentials) in order... tomorrow i'll be at the London Stadium overlooking West Ham take on Leeds United in the FA cup... like always, i'll be more interested in the crowd... spotting a pretty girl among the \"yobs\"... because i truly care about football when it's on the t.v.: in real life... i once stood with three cans of beer and watched a non-league / non-professional match compromising of enthusiasts in a park, at a distance... i couldn't see much... i still don't see much difference... unless it's on the t.v.: the stadium doesnt really \"frighten\" me... but this one time in the park, i sort of looked the Michael Myers part... headphones in... one young woman was trying to... communicate to this older woman: also walking her dog... about confronting me... i think i \"said\": gaze... i looked at them... the younger woman was trying to tell the older woman about confronting me... the older woman told the younger woman: YOU, HAVE, NOTHING, TO TALK ABOUT, WITH THIS, MAN! i was drinking a beer, standing... a decent distance from the football match: but i also remember that... that 1995 Charity Shield game at the Old Wembley between Manchester United & Newcastle: ants kicking a grain of sand... obviously i didn't understand why i might pretend to be a *****... my new favorite word... *****... alias for paedohpile... if i don't look menacing and some woman can \"think\" she stands a chance against me: merely posturing... then we have issues... oh **** me... transcribing... that's worse than plagiarism.... i once did the most pristine plagiarism job on some... social-science course up in Edinburgh... i was having to make up credit scores, being the romantic idiot... losing my virginity to Isabella of Grenoble... oh, get a French girlfriend, take up French... i hate the language... they write what they don't speak: phonetically... which is sort of in line with my prior ambition for the plunge - to transcribe some Kierkegaard, but also translate some SZYMON STAROWOLSKI observations... circa... 1650... the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth... sorry.. it's not going to happen... i've done enough transcribing enough *******'s worth of: this punctuation needs to... \"go\"... to better understand myself... through this iron maiden of: someone else wrote: what someone else wrote... i'll leave ol' SIMON for another take... given... transcribing is a labour... writing, freely... idiosyncratically: appealing to my, appeal... how, why, when... oh i can deal with that, these days... it's not even concerning what sort of thesaurus peacocking exfoliation is being used / abused by the writer... i'm... more allured... by... punctuation... since i don't bother to rhyme, since i find all lyricism a tad bit... crass... what else is there? the measure of: how to stop... how to begin... how to \"objectify\" the conjunction-intermediacy of... punctuation... no manner of human speech can be / could be encapsulated by comparing it to a river... point being... i'd rather write as freely as i can, about the most mundane events in my own life: prop up my subjectivity than... somehow... \"somehow\"... succumb to some sensible objective reality... objectivity does not give me a drive... it does not equip me with a manly persevence... it's antithetical to what i understand as human nature simply because... ha ha... objectivity has been owned by the English... it's their lot of being sensible... like watching would-be journalists looking at what's currently happening in Kazakhstan... then trying to compare it to... the posturing: the civilian security of protests in Ham-Ham-H'America... and it's like... so what?

reflection, specifically, that of inwardness, of possession, whereby it belongs to the subject and to no one else. whereas objective thinking invests everything in the result and assists all humankind to cheat by copying and reeling off the results and answers, subjective thinking invests everything in the process of becoming and omits the result, partly because this belongs to him, since he possesses the way, partly because he as existing is continually in the process of becoming, as is every human being who has not permitted himself to be tricked into becoming objective, into inhumanly becoming speculative thought.\n\nthe reflection of inwardness is the subjective thinker's double-reflection. in thinking, he thinks the universal, but, as existing in this thinking, as acquiring this in his inwardness, he becomes more and more subjectively isolated.\n\nthe difference between subjective and objective thinking must also manifest itself in the form of communication ˣ. this means that the subjective thinker must promptly become aware that the form of communication must artistically possess just as much reflection as he himself, existing in his thinking, possesses. artistically, please note, for the secret does not consist in his enunciating the double-reflection directly, since such an enunciation is a direct contradiction.\n\nordinary communication between one human being and another is entirely immediate, because people ordinarily exist in immediacy. when one person sttes something and another acknowledges the same thing verbatim, they are assumed to be in agreement and to have understood each other. yet because the one making the statement is unware of the duplexity (dobbelthed) of thought-existence, he is also unable to be aware of the double-reflection of communication. therefore, he has no intimation that this kind of agreement can be the greatest misunderstanding and naturally has no intimation that, just as the subjective existing thinker has set himself free by the duplexity, so the secret of communication specifically hinges on setting the other free, and for that very reason he must not communicate himself directly; indeed, it is even irreligious to do so. this latter applies in proportion to the essentiality of the subjective and consequently applies first and foremost within the religious domain, that is, if the communicator is not god himself or does not presume to appeal to the miraculous authority of an apostle but is just a human being and also cares to have meaning in what he says and what he does.\n\nobjective thinking is completely indifferent to subjectivity and thereby to inwardness and appropriation; its communication is therefore direct. it is obvious that it does not therefore have to be easy. but it is direct, it does not have the illusiveness and the art of double-reflection. it does not have that god-fearing and humane soliciude of subjective thinking in communicating itself; it can be understood directly; it can be reeled off. objective thinking is therefore aware only of itself and is therefore no communication, at least no artistic communication, inasmuch as it would always be required to think of the receiver and to pay attention to the form of communication in relation to the receiver's misunderstanding. objective thinking is, like most people, so fervently kind and communicative; it communicates right away and at most resorts to assurances about its truth, to recommendations and promises about how all people someday will accept this truth - so sure is it. or perhaps rather so unsure, because the assurances are recommendations are the promises, which are indeed for the sake of those others who are supposed to accept this truth, might also be for the sake of the teacher, who needs the security and dependability of a majority vote. if his contemporaries deny him this, he will draw on posterity - so sure is he. this security has something in common with the independence that, independent of the world, needs the world as witness to one's independenceso as to be certain of being independent.\n\nˣ double-reflection is already implicit in the ideas of communication itself: that the subjective individual (why by inwardness wants to express the life of the eternal, in which all sociality and all companionship are inconceivable because the existence-category, movement, is inconceivable here, and hence essential communication is also inconceivable because everyone must be assumed to possess everything essentially), existing in the isolation of inwardness, wants to communicate himself, consequently that he simultaneously wants to keep his thinking in the inwardness of his subjective existence and yet wants to communicate himself. it is not possible (except for thoughtlessness, for which ll things are indeed possible) for this contradiction to become manifest in a direct form. - it is not so difficult, however, to understand that a subject existing in this way may want to communicate himself. a person in love, for instance, to whom his ****** love is his very inwardness, may well want to communicate himself, but not directly, just because the inwardness of ****** love is the main thing for him. essentially occupied with continually acquiring the inwardness of ****** love, he has no result and is never finished, but he may nevertheless want to communicate; yet for that very reason he can never use a direct form, since that presupposes results and completion. so it is also in a god-relationship. just because he himself is continually in the process of becoming in an inward direction, that is, in inwardness, he can never communicate himself directly, since the movement is here the very opposite. direct communication requires certainty, but certainty is impossible for a person in the process of becoming, and it is indeed a deception. thus, to employ an ****** relationship, if a maiden in love yearns for the wedding day because this would give her assured certainty, if she wanted to make herself comfortable in legal security as a spouse, if she preferred marital yawning to maidenly yearning, then the man would rightfully deplore her unfaithfulness, although she indeed did not love anyone else, because she would have lost the idea and actually did not love him. and this, after all, is the essential unfaithfulness in an ****** relationship, the incidental unfaithfulness is to love someone else.\n\nas a side-note... these impossible, to my mind:\n\nimaginary \"problems\"...\n\nsay, for

aren't we?!\n\nwho's waking up the populists?!\n\nyou really want germans on the warring path?\n\nof course... let me tell you how *william burroughs\n\nnoted the creation of the schutzstaffel\n\nas over-heard:\n\npet a kitten for month... then gauge its eyes out.\n\noh i have no care for a romance:\n\ni'm seeing Paris contained in an envelope\n\nciting the address: Hades... arise!\n\nit's not the same Paris i remember, not the Paris\n\nof 2004 or 2005...\n\nit's really a case of playing with\n\nan elastic band.... you pull it, stretch it...\n\nbut finally it snaps! and yes...\n\nwe'll be drinking schnapps in Libya at some point...\n\ni'm thinking: what will ever make a man\n\nrelieve himself of using a hammer and a nail\n\nas a carpenter, and take to a machine gun?\n\nthere must be an enzyme-point that just festers\n\nin its ability to give momentum...\n\nthere must be... perhaps when being global merchants\n\nleaves people too ordained to wait for death\n\nthat they start seeking it in the ***** of Mars?\n\nwhen utopia nears and merely breathes into\n\nman's ear, and says no word, unlike a god:\n\nthat the fatality dynamo begins...\n\nakin to the fateful comparison of Damocles -\n\ndangling, but at the same time: tickling... teasing...\n\nisn't the Islamic world merely agitating?\n\ntrying to move the Christian world from\n\nfully engrossing the \"protestant\"-liberal\n\neasy adaptation working from unearthing\n\nthe nag hammadi library?\n\nwell... the left is without an economic\n\nmodel... so it's politics is what it is:\n\nthe original intention of Hegel:\n\noutlines of the philosophy of right -\n\nwhat's the genesis of Marx... funny enough\n\nthe book is merely a collection of notes on lectures...\n\nthere no thesis involved...\n\nnothing as grand as what could stand alone\n\nakin to the phenomenology of spirit -\n\nthey're just notes... just like i'm reading heidegger's\n\nponderings ii - vi... notes... half-baked scripts...\n\nso my post-communist inheritence...\n\njust when inflation gripped Polish economy...\n\nand we had the Kantian idea reaching pulpit\n\n1000000zł, i.e. so many denials of a stable 1...\n\nthus the inner working of modern capitalism...\n\nhow certain things are really worth\n\nnothing, as such: £0.000001 -\n\ni can only guess to state, the only class of people\n\nable to experience this counter-inflation\n\nin western societies are \"artists\"...\n\nor artists, in the context of a harold norse\n\nautobiography: memoirs of a ******* angel;\n\ni.e. getting published, giving ****...\n\nit would have been easier under Stalin or ******...\n\nat least the chance of martydom\n\nand the holy ghost of censorship...\n\nat least it would have made sense then...\n\nbut the concept of counter-inflation isn't that alien...\n\nit exists for a reason to suggest:\n\nwe really don't need so many contestants\n\nin an x-factor show... we don't need so many\n\nartists... counter-inflation is at work already...\n\nthe same sort of inflation that worked its way\n\nto ensure plumbers and carpenters, roofers\n\nfrom eastern europe at the end of communism\n\nwere necessarily exported into western europe...\n\ngiven the communist work ethic...\n\nhence the power of money, so inhuman and\n\nakin to an elemental force that man\n\ncan contain with pocket-money as a child,\n\nbut as a man, can't contain neither forest fire\n\nor tsunami, so too money: with the economic crisis...\n\nmoney overpowers man, akin to the elements...\n\nthe same inflation in poland at work\n\nto shift people is apparent now, but as counter-inflation...\n\nbecause England can't be known as a nation\n\nof singers... but of nurses and carpenters and\n\nshopkeepers, hence the counter-inflation:\n\nwhen a song on Spotify is worth £0.000001 per streaming...\n\nan immigrant plumber from eastern europe is\n\nworth 1000000zł... or how the coordinate (0, 0)\n\ncancels out... and we're left with what's later just\n\na pedantic fact stated by someone like me: a zzzzzzzz\n\ncoordinate...\n\nwe can't control money no more than\n\nwe can control seas...\n\ncould we ever not dream of being given enough\n\nmoney to then not waste them on pointless urges\n\nakin to a lottery win and the easy way, via no\n\nbusiness or syndicate?\n\nreally? there's a reason we live in a time\n\nthat's necessarily soulless...\n\ni can't give it a piquant phrase (only a phrase\n\nas germans put it, chemically, hydrocarbon spelling\n\nakin to zeitgeist - spirit of the times,\n\nand there's nothing holy about it...\n\nit just moves to the next generation,\n\nand the next poker hand... so **** that trinity\n\num... person?) - it gets ***** with fashion...\n\nor as i see it: cannibalism of 20th century trends\n\nas the neo-original basis of fashion in the 21st beginning...\n\nthis is the one time i'll get to coin a phrase,\n\ni.e. pick up a penny from the street pavement...\n\ncounter-inflation brought it about...\n\nrather than a zeitgeist where we can share afflictions\n\nand, perhaps succumb to empathy early on...\n\nnein... none of that... let's see what we really see it as:\n\nebenegeist - or?
