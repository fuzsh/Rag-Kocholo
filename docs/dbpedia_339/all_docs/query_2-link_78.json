        "text": "Reviewed by: Tim Salmons\n\nReview Date: Jul 19, 2023\n\nFormat: Blu-ray Disc\n\nReview\n\nVintage made-for-TV documentaries have often been relegated to being low quality bonus features on home video releases, or they’re never to be seen again thanks to mountains of legal red tape to even include them in the first place. That’s why something like the Blu-ray collection Stooge O-Rama: The Men Behind the Mayhem – And Even More Mayhem! is so special. Not only does it include a revised, extended, and upscaled version of the A&E Biography TV special that originally aired in 1996, but also adds a mountain of bonus material that every die-hard Three Stooges fan will want to dig through endlessly. Directed by Paul E. Gierucki, who also produced other documentaries about Fatty Arbuckle and Buster Keaton, this is a loving tribute to the history and career of the beloved vaudeville-turned-movie star comedy act, featuring interviews with some of their (then) surviving relatives and friends, as well as voiceover artist Billy West, among others. For fans wanting to know more about the history of classic slapstick, this is a must.\n\nStooges: The Men Behind the Mayhem was captured and finished on video in the aspect ratio of 1.33:1. Sprocket Vault, Kit Parker Films, and Cinemuseum bring the film to Blu-ray for the first time, upscaled to 1080p. It has its obvious limitations, but it’s clean and sharp enough to be enjoyable, featuring a mix of video-based interviews and segments with other film and video sources of differing qualities, including various kinescope material. Audio is included in English 2.0 LPCM, but unfortunately, there are no subtitle options. The latter is a shame, especially since—not to be overly ageist—many Three Stooges fans are likely in their 40s and beyond, meaning that they may depend on subtitles more than most. Even so, the audio comes across just fine with good support for the interviews and various TV programs and film clips. Nothing is amiss.\n\nStooge O-Rama is a 3-Disc set with the main documentary appearing on the first disc. The gargantuan amount of extras are spread across the three discs:\n\nDISC ONE – STOOGES: THE MEN BEHIND THE MAYHEM\n\nIntroduction by Brad “Curly G” Server (HD – :50)\n\nExtended Interviews: Lyla Fine Budnick (Upscaled SD – 12:06)\n\nExtended Interviews: Nate Budnick (Upscaled SD – 16:55)\n\nExtended Interviews: Billy West (Upscaled SD – 2:56)\n\nExtended Interviews: Lola Jensen (Upscaled SD – 1:43)\n\nUnaired Commercial Bumpers (1992) (SD – 4 in all – 1:05)\n\nPhoto Galleries: Lyla Fine Personal Scrapbook (HD – 45 in all – 2:37)\n\nPhoto Galleries: Stooge Memorabilia (HD – 56 in all – 5:38)\n\nDISC TWO – STOOGES LOST AND FOUND\n\nFox Movietone News Outtakes with Moe & Shemp (August 6, 1929) (Upscaled SD – 6:33)\n\nStooge Home Movies: Snippets of the Stooges at Work and Play (1920s-1960s) (HD and Upscaled SD – 5:47)\n\nEverybody Likes Music – Rare Shemp Howard Van Beuren Short (March 9, 1934) (HD – 19:25)\n\nSurprise, Surprise Lost Theatrical Short (October 31, 1937) (HD – 2:09)\n\nEd Wynn Camel Comedy Caravan TV Kinescope (March 11, 1950) (Upscaled SD – 29:44)\n\nAndy Wade’s California Home Movies (July 1956) (HD – 7:56)\n\nOn the Go TV Interview (April 15, 1960) (Upscaled SD – 19:17)\n\nStrictly for Laffs TV Pilot (July 1, 1962) (Upscaled SD – 21:32)\n\nStar Spangled-Salesman Government PSA (February 9, 1968) (Upscaled SD – 18:07)\n\nKook’s Tour Outtakes (December 7, 1969) (Upscaled SD – 11:15)\n\nJoe DeRita Interview (1976) (Upscaled SD – 6:20)\n\nThe Funniest Guys in the World Documentary Outtake Reel (1983) (Upscaled SD – 27:37)\n\nMousie Garner Live at The Three Stooges Convention (June 1994) (Upscaled SD – 15:31)\n\nDISC THREE – ADDITIONAL EXTRAS\n\nCommercial Stooges:\n\nInstant Simonize (March 15, 1960) (HD – 1:06)\n\nDo Lamond Spot – KTTV TV-11 Los Angeles (1961) (Upscaled SD – 1:05)\n\nMr. Poplolly – Cartoonerville Trolley Promo WJZ TV13 Baltimore (Circa 1961) (Upscaled SD – :23)\n\nDickie’s Work Clothes (March 21, 1969) 60 Second Spot (Upscaled SD – :59)\n\nDickie’s Work Clothes (March 21, 1969) 30 Second Spot (Upscaled SD – :28)\n\nStroke of Luck Book (November 1, 1973) 60 Second Spot (Upscaled SD – 1:04)\n\nThree Stooges Tee-Shirt (June 1, 1974) – Partial (HD – :49)\n\nMovie Trailers and Coming Attractions:\n\nTurn Back the Clock (August 25, 1933) (HD and Upscaled SD – 2:41)\n\nDancing Lady (November 24, 1933) (HD and Upscaled SD – 1:58)\n\nHollywood Party (May 24, 1933) (Upscaled SD – 3:10)\n\nTime Out for Rhythm (June 5, 1941) (Upscaled SD – 2:11)\n\nGold Raiders (September 14, 1951) (Upscaled SD – 1:42)\n\nThe Three Stooges Laff-A-Rama (1950s) (Upscaled SD – :46)\n\nHave Rocket, Will Travel (August 1, 1959) (HD – 2:43)\n\nThree Stooges Fun-O-Rama (September 1, 1959) (Upscaled SD – :35)\n\nStop!
