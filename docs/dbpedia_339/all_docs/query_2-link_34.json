Photo: Selig Polyscope Co.\n\t\n\t<b>Stella Razeto/Stella LeSaint</b> (1881-1948) was an American actress of the silent screen, who worked at the companies Selig and Universal, often directed there by her husband Edward LeSaint.\n\t\n\tStella Razeto started on the stage with the Florence Roberts company in San Francisco. She then moved on to vaudeville in New York City and formed the &quot;Stella Razeto and Company&quot; group. Due to illness she left the stage, eventually joining the Majestic Company where she played with Mabel Trunnelle and Herbert Prior for many months (IMDB, however, lists no film titles). In 1913 she moved to the Selig Polyscope Company where she mostly worked with her future husband, director Edward LeSaint (1870-1940); they married in December 1913. Her first feature at Selig was Memories (1914) by LeSaint, in which she acted opposite Harold Lockwood and Guy Oliver. Oliver was Razeto's regular film partner in those years. While doing dozens of shorts in 1913-1914, from 1915 Razeto did more and more features, first the Selig production The Circular Staircase (LeSaint, 1915). From that time, she also used her now husband's name as Stella LeSaint. In 1915 LeSaint and Razeto moved to Universal and continued their career there in both shorts and features, all through 1915 and 1916, including features with Harry Carey such as The Three Godfathers (LeSaint 1916). In 1917 Razeto stopped film acting. Between 1934 and 1949 she acted in 23 American sound films, all in uncredited roles. All in all, she acted in over a 100 film titles.\n\t\n\tSources: IMDB, English Wikipedia.",
