        "text": "Between April 2002 and April 2010, Chris de Burgh answered over 1,000 questions from his fans, submitted via his official website in a section called 'Man On The Line'. This section of the official website went offline many years ago, so the questions and answers are archived here.\n\n1st January 2005 - Rowan Troy (19) from Kent, England:\n\nWhere did you get the inspiration for \"Just A Word Away\"? I have been a fan for a long time now since my Dad played all of your records but this one struck me in particular. In the lyrics you mention \"It must be a daddy's pride and joy, a little baby boy\" and also \"Your sister Rosanna's fast asleep\". I have a sister called Rosanna, she is my twin and I really like the song. I was wondering what inspired you to write these lyrics as it is very coincidental that I feel really connected to the song - keep up the good work!!!\n\nHi Rowan! \"Just A Word Away\" was written for my first son, Hubie. Because I had written already a song for his sister, Rosanna. And I wanted again to describe the bond that exists between fathers and their children. And I am saying to him that wherever you are in the world when you grow up, all you have to do is call me and I am there for you. It's an eternal kind of love that you have for your children. And I am fascinated by the fact that you also have a sister Rosanna, your twin! I wrote this song because I wanted to celebrate the birth of my second child and that indeed now we have a sister for him and a brother for her. And that's why I mentioned \"it must be a Daddy's pride and joy, a little baby boy is lying in my arms here tonight\".\n\n2nd January 2005 - Julia (54) from Melbourne, Australia:\n\nHello Chris, Some months ago I saw a documentary on TV about the discovery of almost two hundred year old graves of fallen soldiers from Napoleon's army. These soldiers died whilst in retreat from Moscow during one of the worst winters ever seen. Most of these men had either starved or froze to death. Your song \"Snow Is Falling\" from the new album \"The Road To Freedom\", reminded me of this very interesting, but sad documentary. These soldiers had lain in their graves for so long, just crying out to be discovered. My question to you is, what made you write this beautiful, melancholy song? Was it something that you had seen or experienced, or just something that came into your head? Thank you for your wonderful music, best wishes Julia.\n\nJulia, I just read your question and I got the shivers, thinking of those young men who have been lying in a grave for 200 years. And when they disappeared, can you imagine the grief of the families, not knowing what had happened to them? And the companions not knowing what had happened in the retreat from Moscow? And I tell you, I didn't have this in my mind when I wrote the song. What happened was that I was in a beautiful hotel called Lainston House Hotel near Winchester in England, and I was working with my friend, Chris Porter, at his recording studio which is a few miles away. And I am staying in this place, and this hotel is at least 300 or 400 years old, it's absolutely gorgeous, I can recommend it to anybody who wants to find somewhere unusual to stay in that part of England. It's about 6 miles outside of Winchester. And they had a piano there in one of the drawing rooms downstairs. And one morning, it was a beautiful sunny morning, I started playing it. And the melody of \"Snow Is Falling\" just came straight out of my fingers. And it immediately started a film in my head. And the film was a vast white snowy landscape, and then the camera moves into trees, fir trees, heavy with snow, and it is absolutely silent. And occasionally a lump of snow would fall from the trees. But like little snowflakes are falling, we go deeper into the forest. And there is a clearing, broken earth with snow on the top, and it's the grave of three or four hundred young men. And an old man had been taken from their village and had been murdered. And nobody knows where they are. And as the seasons come and go, from spring to summer to winter, those bodies in there and those spirits are calling to be found, so they can have a decent burial and so their families know what happened to them. What you said in your question about these soldiers lying in their graves for 200 years, crying out to be discovered, it's exactly what I had in my mind. I have no idea where the idea came from, it just hit me. And I remember dramatically performing this in Russia, and I had an interpreter describe what I have just said to you about what I had in my mind. And at the end of the song it struck such a chord with those people, because that sort of thing has happened so much in Eastern Europe. You know, people had been taken in their hundreds and thousands and been murdered and never been found again. But at the end of the song, virtually everybody in the audience was crying. And it had a big impact on me. This song is beautiful, but it's melancholy as well, and I hope it makes people think a little bit about what is actually out there, waiting to be found.\n\n3rd January 2005 - Norman (60) from Celle, Germany:\n\nHi Chris, I don't really have a question but a suggestion. I happened to hear a song on a local Radio station this morning and thought straight away, hey! I think Chris de Burgh could make a beautiful version of this. The song is one which I am sure you know, \"Those were the days\" done by Mary Hopkin about 30 years ago, what do you think?\n\nFunny you should say that about Mary Hopkin. I know this song extremely well. It is based on a Russian folk song. Mary Hopkin was, and still is a beautiful Welsh lady. She was discovered by Paul McCartney and he produced and I believe co-wrote or wrote the song \"Those Were The Days\", based on this traditional Russian folk song. And it became a massive hit for Apple Records. I used to know every single word. In fact I was listening to, somebody sent me a CD of Russian folk songs, and I heard exactly that with Russian words, quite unusual sounding. I did a kind of a Russian song with \"Natasha Dance\", which speeds up at the end. Lots of Russian songs do that. \"Those Were The Days\", maybe there is a chance to sing it again for me, because it is a lovely tune.\n\n4th January 2005 - Nico (26) from Ermelo, The Netherlands:\n\nDear Chris, Congratulations on your great new album! However, I have a question regarding the song \"What you mean to me\": I think it really breaks the whole peaceful and romantic atmosphere of the album... Is there a special reason why you included this different kind of song?\n\nThank you for what you are saying about my album. And you ask about \"What You Mean To Me\". Well, I know exactly what it does to the album: It lightens the mood. Some people have said exactly that, some people love that song. And other people are not mad about \"What You Mean To Me\". It's very difficult getting the balance of the songs right. And in fact you may have come across the three new songs on the special edition of \"The Road To Freedom\": \"Little Angel\", \"Once Upon A Time\" and \"Even Now\". You see, I think that if any of those three songs had gone in instead, the atmosphere of the whole record would have changed and it would have been extremely melancholy. So one thing that I am always very very aware of is creating balance on a record. And I do believe that, if I had been performing that album live, at that point after the song \"Here For You\", where many people are getting tearful, thinking about their children leaving the country at an airport, or indeed if you have a child leaving parents and friends behind, it does need something to lighten the mood a bit. And that's why I decided to put that one in there.\n\n5th January 2005 - Sibylle Marwitz (38) from Hilden, Germany:\n\nHi Chris, was the very first song you've ever written really called \"A Waste of Love\"? Your only comment on it so far is that it was \"a waste of time\", but I think the title sounds interesting and it must have been about something at least ;-) ... so do you remember how old you were when you wrote it, what inspired you to do so and what it's about? xx Sibylle\n\nGreetings to Sibylle Marwitz, one of my great fans from many many years ago. And Sibylle, thank you for those wonderful compilations of pictures and articles you put together for me, most recently about Rosanna winning Miss World and what she has been up to. And the various articles that appeared in German magazines and newspapers about me and my family. Yeah, I think the first song I ever wrote was called \"A Waste Of Love\". And I was a bit flippant when I said it was a waste of time, but it wasn't really good. I think it is like anything, the first thing that you create, you think it is marvellous until you create something slightly better. And songwriting is no different from anything else. You just got to get good at it. And you write quite a lot of rotten songs before you start coming up with anything that is decent. I remember playing it to some people, thinking I am very clever, having written a song... but they weren't that impressed. I don't remember what it was about, except that it was in E minor. And I would have been about 14 or 15 years old.\n\n6th January 2005 - Anna Dolgikh (24) from Moscow, Russia:\n\nHi Chris! Thank you for your wonderful songs! Your last album is really exciting! Hope one day I'll hear you singing your new songs in Moscow! Chris, I have got a question that really concerns me greatly. How should parents bring up their child in order to make him strong and happy? I've seen two major approaches. The first one is when the parents try to protect their child from the problems of this \"big world\" around him. They try themselves to deal with difficulties their child face with and save him from pain and tears. The second one is to let the child resolve his problems himself (except very complicated, perhaps). My Dad considers this approach to be right assuming that the child should learn how to survive in this \"big world\" without help and should be able to overcome difficulties and build relationships himself. The most interesting fact that I've noticed that even when the parents try to combine two approaches one of them anyway will prevail. Chris, what approach is closer to you?\n\nThis question is one of the most difficult questions to answer for any parent. And there is no actual answer. It all depends on a number of environmental questions like \"Where do you live?\", \"Who else is in your family?\", \"Are your mother and father in the home?\", \"Do you get on with your mother and father?\", \"What are your hopes and dreams for yourself and for your family?\". It's a question that has dominated human thinking ever since time began: \"What is the best way to raise your children?\" Well, I think the first thing to consider is that there have been times when parents have ruled their children through fear and not love. Notably I would say in the Victorian era in English history. Not all parents of course, but there is an old rule which was used at the time: Children should be seen, but not heard. You can't stop children developing, but I think that you must always be encouraging to your child to develop and grow and try things out. But be there for them almost like an invisible wall. When they go that little bit too far, at least they know you are there. Even just today I was hearing about a family that grew up, where they had no rules. It was a very Bohemian, relaxed, easy-going atmosphere, where the girls in the family had their boyfriends stay overnight in their beds and all. And it did not work for this family. In fact, it was a catastrophe. One of the girls committed suicide. The other was a drug addict. Children do need rules, and they do need help, they need encouragement. I certainly don't have the answer, Anna, but with my children I am aware that as they grow through their teen years, the relationship with their parents changes. You must always shift and change. It is nothing cast in stone. You must always change, preshape their changes, understand their moods, understand why they are changing. And as you see, even my short answer, I think it presents more questions than answers. The protection against the big world? Well, that is a natural thing that parents try to do. But then again, if you are too protective of your children, when they finally get into the big world, it is a dreadful shock. They shouldn't be too streetwise, they should be a bit streetwise. Again, it depends on where you live and how you live. I must say, I would not be drawn to the second one that you are referring to, about a child having to fight the fight all on its own. I think you should allow the child to resolve their own problems on their own, but you should always be beside them in case they need you. It's like going with your child, climbing a tree. You know, you don't just send your child out and say \"climb every tree in the garden\", you just go out with them and say \"Try that one! No, that might be a big high for you, try this one! Careful that you don't fall! Oh, well done, you went up that one all by yourself.\" That's what I call encouragement, but being there for them, when you feel that they need your advise and company. And being aware all the time of the shifting sense of change as children grow up. And as parents change as well! I hope this helps you a little bit, but it is a complicated problem.\n\n7th January 2005 - Marc Stynen (30) from Antwerp, Belgium:\n\nI am a fan of your music (of course), but I also like the music from Alan Parsons very much. The Crusader album was produced by Alan Parsons and also Andrew Powell worked on it, and together they worked again later, on the Alan Parsons albums. I wonder how you remember working with him (or them), and what do you think of his music? Regards, Marc.\n\nYes, my Crusader album was produced by only Andrew Powell. But Alan Parsons and Andrew Powell used to work together quite a bit. They used to make extraordinary good records, and in fact the musicians on the Crusader album also came from the Alan Parsons Project. And looking at my record collection right now, I have a few of Alan Parsons albums. I don't know if he is still making records these days, but he certainly made some very interesting and unusual records back in those days.\n\n8th January 2005 - Evan Bishop (10) from Montreal, Canada:\n\nHi Chris, My Mom has been a fan of yours since she was my age, so I have gown up listening to your music. Last year (2003) she brought me to your concert at Place des Arts. It was cool. My grandmother came also, so we had three generations. My question is this: I have been playing the guitar now for two years (learning in school). Sometimes I make up songs - which comes easiest for you - the notes or lyrics when you compose your music? Any advice for a young musician? Looking forward to seeing you again, next time we're going front row - Mom promised...Thanks, Evan Bishop\n\nWhat a wonderful question from ten year old Evan from Montreal! And those of you who read MOtL know that I often talk about Montreal and my great friends, who live there, and the lovely people of that town, and how grateful I am to the people from Montreal for their love and support and friendship and loyalty for all these years that I have been making music. Not just in recent times, but since many many years ago. I loved playing in Montreal and if you were at the Place des Arts, as you said you were, I am sure you would have seen a really extraordinary show, but made not just out of me and my music, but also the wonderful people of Montreal who give so much of themselves to a performer. It is great that you are starting to write songs so young. The key is to write songs about things that you believe in, things that mean something to you. Maybe about friends and friendship, or a story about something you have seen or want to do, or a dream. As far as the music is concerned and the words, I find the easiest thing for me to do is to try and define the shape of the song, almost like the outline or the skeleton of the song and then the music will tell me what it is about. Whether it is a minor key, it is going to be slightly sad. Or major key, fun or happy. Let the music start nudging you and say \"well, this is a song about this\" and then let the words sort of tumble out, even if it is gibberish and nonsense. Sometimes you will pick up a phrase or something that will give you an indication of what the song is actually about. There are some people who believe that every song has already been written and what you really try to do is to discover them. Then again, I think it's also up to your own brain to develop an idea. So good luck with the music, Evan!\n\n9th January 2005 - Caroline & Michelle Hardwick (47 & 21) from Gloucester, England:\n\nDear Chris, We all like to laugh and feel happy, and occasionally we have one of those laughs where we cannot stop. Tears are streaming down our faces, our stomachs ache, and when we try to stop, just a glance at someone and we start all over again! This type of laughter does not usually happen very often, but when it does, isn't it great! Can you remember the last time you experienced laughing like this? All our love Caroline & Michelle\n\nCaroline and Michelle, great supporters, great fans for many years! You have been fantastic in sending me gifts and taking care of me in many different ways down the years. Very interesting question about laughing! Yes, that does happen. I am trying to think about the last time that happened to me. But there are moments, you know, when your stomach is aching and tears are pouring down your face as you described. I am actually inspired by all sorts of things to laugh a lot. But it's obviously not something that you do on your own very often. But when you are out and people are acting in a very dumb and dozy way, or else a dog does something stupid, or you see a photograph of animals behaving in an odd way or people. You know, things do trigger me off, but the continuous can't-stop-laughing, that sometimes happens when I am out or at home with friends. You know, you keep on referring to something. My kids certainly collapse laughing sometimes and I join them. There's a very funny series which was on television called Father Ted. And although I have seen each episode 50 times, I still fall around laughing, I think it is quite the funniest thing I have ever seen. For me it's funnier than Faulty Towers or Monthy Python. I think Father Ted, because I live in Ireland and it is about an Irish priest in some godforsaken place in the West of Ireland, I just find it absolutely extraordinarily funny. And at the beginning of each episode that I am watching, particularly if I am with friends or family, I am laughing almost at the very first thing that happens, because I am anticipating how funny it is going to be.\n\n10th January 2005 - Tracey Gleave (21) from Lancashire, England:\n\nI have managed to get hold of the record 'Lonely Sky and Other Stories' for a bargain price of $18 do you know approximately how many copies of this record were minted and/or what it is worth?\n\nHi Tracey! Well done in getting hold of a copy of \"Lonely Sky And Other Stories\". I have no idea how many copies were made, I think it was probably about 2000. Because \"Spanish Train\" was banned in South Africa, and apparently somebody complained that the line \"And God didn't see what the Devil did\" was blasphemous, because God sees everything, even when the Devil cheats. I thought it was absolutely ludicrous as did a lot of other people at the time. And we got the ban lifted by doing two things. One, by releasing an album called \"Lonely Sky And Other Stories\" which is the same black cover, but instead of the words \"Spanish Train\" written on the front it had the words \"Lonely Sky\". And the second thing is, I performed the song with my band to a group of censors from South Africa, we played it during a show in Johannesburg, just to show there was nothing wrong with it. And I think it was about half a dozen elderly gentlemen from the censorship board, we put them right in front of the speakers and cranked up the volume. I don't think they could have heard anything. Anyway, it was unbanned about six months later. But it is certainly a very unusual item to find. And I have one copy, but I have no idea how many others exist.\n\n11th January 2005 - Ron (39) from Guelph, Canada:\n\nHi Chris, My wife and I saw you in concert in Toronto in May, 03. You performed a beautiful portion of an \"uncompleted\" song relating it to a young girl whom had recently been killed in Toronto. Did you ever complete the song? Please come back to Canada soon, my daughter wants to hear you do Spanish Train live.\n\nHi Ron! The concert at the Hummingbird theatre in Toronto in May 2003 did feature a song called \"Little Angel\". Yes, I did complete it, and it is available on my extended CD of \"The Road To Freedom\". And thank you very much about your wish to see me again in Canada. As you know, I have a long and terrific love affair with Canada going back many years, and I can't wait to get back there. And bring your daughter to come and see me doing \"Spanish Train\", because it is quite a scary song.\n\n12th January 2005 - Cleopatra (54) from Melbourne, Australia:\n\nHi Chris! I have recently bought a fabulous book called 'Irish Gardens\" by Olda FitzGerald which show some very beautiful gardens in some very beautiful old estates and castles, and being a keen gardener myself I was wondering what your garden was like and what sort of trees you have growing, being an old house I should imagine some of the trees would be quite old. Thank you as always for taking the time to answer our questions. Love Cleo.\n\nNice to hear from you, Cleo! I often read your emails that you send into the website, the guestbook, and also I read a lot of things on the Yahoo website that have been said. The book \"Irish Gardens\", actually I have a copy, I know the one you mean. The house that I currently live in, that we developed and expanded and renovated across 7 years has a beautiful garden and a lot of it got damaged during the construction process, so we're in the position now of bringing the garden back to its original beauty. It was, before we bought the house, one of the gardens that featured in \"Irish Gardens\" that you could go and visit during the summer and the autumn and the spring of course around the Wicklow area. But there's a lot more to be done to bring it back to its original state and we have a terrific gardening team here who are looking after it. But I don't think it's likely to be in that book. Maybe you should come out to Ireland and visit some of these gardens, Cleo! It's a beautiful country. Just as far as the trees are concerned, because the house itself originated in the 1740s, a lot of trees were planted during that time and 50 years afterwards. So we are surrounded by very beautiful big old trees. And sadly some of them are reaching the end of their days, the beech trees, the oak trees, the Spanish chestnuts. So we are going through a process of replanting hopefully for future generations to enjoy.\n\n13th January 2005 - Paul (40) from St-Jean, Quebec, Canada:\n\nHi Chris, first English is not my first language.... The last time you came to Montreal (at the Place des Arts), they gave us a program that talked about a French version of Guilty Secret (secret mensonge) that you made. Is it true? Because I didn't find anything about this version. Thank you.\n\nThere is a French version of \"Guilty Secret\", in fact I did \"Le Coeur D'Une Femme\" (A Woman's Heart) in French, \"Guilty Secret\" in French and several others actually in the French language, because as you know I really enjoy singing and speaking French. The version does exist. I guess the best way to find is through one of the radio stations, because it was a number one hit in the province of Quebec and also the song A Woman's Heart was a big hit there too. So maybe the radio stations can help you find a copy.\n\n14th January 2005 - Robert Meister (41) from Nassau, Bahamas:\n\nHow many songs do you typically write for a new album that don't make the final cut? And would you ever consider letting your fans vote via your official website (for example, by posting one minute sound clips) which songs you would release on a new album?\n\nWell, that is an interesting idea to encourage the fans to vote in their favourites. I don't think that would work in practice, because I have in my head an idea of what I am trying to say with a whole album and as I said earlier in one of the MOtL questions, getting the balance of an album right is extremely difficult. And it really has to reflect what I have been thinking about in the last couple of years. However, that said, it might be an interesting idea in the future to ballot the fans on the website and see what songs they would like to hear me singing live. Well that would be an interesting thing to try and do. And as far as the songs I write, if I am recording, say, 12 songs, I usually write about 14 or 16 and keep the extra ones for another album or another idea. Or if they are not good enough, I just ignore them and move on to something else.\n\n15th January 2005 - Konni Risse (46) from Bochum, Germany:\n\nFirst I have to thank you for the fantastic concerts I've seen on your \"Road to Freedom Tour\"! And I have to say I absolutely love your guitar version of \"Rainy Night in Paris\"! So here is my question: What gave you the idea to play this song with a guitar instead of a piano?\n\nWhat I was trying to do for the new tour, was to come up with different ways of playing songs that people had heard before. For example I do \"Sight And Touch\". Originally it was done on the piano, but now I have moved it across to guitar. And I think it gives it a different feel, a different flavour. And the same thing with \"A Rainy Night In Paris\". I liked the slow version of that and it makes it funkier and more rhythmic. I went through virtually every track that I have ever written and recorded in order to put together the concert tour I have just completed for \"The Road To Freedom\". And it took a lot of work. But I looked at songs how to perform them, maybe ones that people hadn't heard for a while, maybe do them in different ways. And that's why I came up with the idea of playing \"A Rainy Night In Paris\" on the guitar. I think it works quite well.\n\n16th January 2005 - Peter (19) from Warsaw, Poland:\n\nI am very pleased with your latest album, \"The Road To Freedom\". I was wondering if it is possible somehow to obtain your music in written form - notes. Particularly I'm interested in piano notes for \"When Winter Comes\". Do you sell your music \"on paper\"? Thank you for your efforts, and best wishes from myself - Peter.\n\nThe answer is yes, my music is released in songbooks with piano and guitar notes. And I am sure at some stage the music of \"The Road To Freedom\" will be available in these kind of songbooks. \"When Winter Comes\" is not that complex actually. It's the chords of D minor, A minor, B flat, F, G minor and A. I am sure you can probably work it out on the piano. Good luck! Hopefully it'll wind up in a songbook at some stage.\n\n17th January 2005 - Karin (40) from Austria:\n\nHi Chris! First I must tell you that your songs go right to my heart for nearly 20 years now and they helped me through a very grave crisis in my married life! The song \"Rose of England\" is my favourite of your latest album since I heard it for the first time. Now I would like to know why you chose Elisabeth I for a song. Why did you make a song about duty winning over love this time whereas mostly you spread the opinion of \"finding for the heart over the head\"? I wish you and all your fans many, many more years with your wonderful music, your most unique voice and your love for mankind. Thank you!\n\nHow nice of you to say to me that my music has helped you through a tough time in your married life. I can only guess what that must have been, but it sounds like you are full of hope at the moment and things have worked out for you. \"Rose Of England\", that came from nowhere in particular, except that I was thinking about how Queen Elizabeth I was one of the longest reigning monarchs in English history. And how ironic was the fact that she felt herself unable to marry a man that she loved. And in effect she married the country of England. I know it's different to what I said in \"The Head And The Heart\" where I usually find for the heart, but in her case she decided that the country needed her more than one man did. That is why she made her decision. I must say I love singing this song. It may not be historically as accurate as it could be, but it's what we call poetic license. When you are writing a complicated song like that, you are looking for the right words to rhyme, and they don't necessarily tell the full story. But I think people who know the story will understand exactly what I was getting at. And how a rose is a beautiful flower, but the thorns can hurt you, if you pick it up the wrong way, just like love.\n\n18th January 2005 - Edwin Baeyens (36) from Antwerp, Belgium:\n\nHi Chris, Thanks for a great new album and a fantastic concert right here in Antwerp. I've always been fascinated by your song \"Spanish Train\". Where did you get the inspiration for this song? When I was at school (a long time ago, I'm afraid), I did an essay on it, comparing it to works of Magical Realism. Are you familiar with this literary genre? Also, have you ever read Belgian author Johan Daisne's novel \"De Trein der Traagheid\" (One night, One Train), in which the train is used in a similar manner? Thanks.\n\nThank you for your remarks about the concert in Antwerp. I enjoyed that, I remember it well. \"Spanish Train\", the reason I wrote it, as I am sure some people may have heard before, I'll tell you again anyway. I was staying in Spain in 1974, and I had a guitar and a backpack, and I took a train from the border of Spain and Portugal North towards Seville. And we were crossing the Quadalquivir river, and the train was going very slowly, and there were just two carriages, and there were very menacing looking Guardia Civil guards, because this was still in the time of General Franco of Spain. There was a very strange atmosphere on the train, as these guards walked up and down, looking frightening. And I glanced up a hill, and a farmer had got lots and lots of bits of wood, which were very dry and very twisted and knotted. And he put several of them together to create a fence all the way up the hill. And as we passed by, I glanced up, and in my weird state of mind at the time I fancied that they were skeletons dancing up the hill. And at the same time I imagined the train driver being a skeleton. And then one thing led to another, and I wrote down in a book, that I still have, the opening lines \"There's a Spanish train that runs between Quadalquivir and old Seville. The dead of night the whistle blows and people hear she's running still.\" And I wrote that down. I didn't come back to it for a couple of months, but I loved the idea and I started to developing it around this cosmic struggle for good and evil which was described so brilliantly in John Milton's epic poem of the 17th century called \"Paradise Lost And Paradise Regained\", where the devil was once a favourite in heaven but he did very evil things and was thrown out. And it describes his fall into hell and now he lay there vowing his revenge. And I just thought, well, if there is this cosmic struggle between good and evil, looks like evil is getting the upper hand right now. So that was the inspiration. I don't know about this Belgian author Johan Daisne \"The train\", but it sounds like an interesting story.\n\n19th January 2005 - Doris Neerfries (35) from Dinslaken, Germany:\n\nDear Chris, I just saw the report \"Hoechstpersoenlich\" on ARD about and with you. I really loved it! The 30 minutes were very interesting: old private films and photos and new spots of your tour!!! It was like being in your concert again for a (too) short time! I wondered, if you really composed that song about \"always having to say goodbye\" exactly in that moment or did you develop the melody before? It's hard to believe, that somebody just can sit at the piano and play a new melody and sing a new text and it even sounds so wonderful!!!! Is it really so easy for you to write songs?\n\nHi Doris! This \"Hoechstpersoenlich\" report on ARD was a great program to record. And I must admit, I was fascinated by it. Yes, that was the first time he had asked me about writing a song. And the idea of always having to say goodbye came into my head. I think, at my stage now, because I am a professional musician for so many years, and I have studied modern music for so many years as well, it is not difficult to write a song. But what is difficult is to write a really good one. And I certainly don't believe I would have recorded that one. I would have worked on it a lot more and polished it up and made it better. But yes, it was straight out of the blue. It's simple enough, if you have a few words in your head and create a melody and create chord structure. But as I say, Doris, the hard thing is to make something good and create a really good song.\n\n20th January 2005 - Chris Raymond (53) from Whitton, Twickenham, UK:\n\nDear Chris, it was a bit of a shock for your fans to see that you bid for the latex model \"monster\" from the 1979 film Alien on 13th July. I think that, like me, many people are very curious about this!! Please would you tell us more about your reason for purchasing such an unusual object? We're fascinated! Many thanks. Chris R P.S. Also please can you tell us where you have displayed the monster?\n\nHi Chris! It was great to see you on the British tour a few times and thank you for your continued love and support. The latex model monster from the 1979 film Alien? Well, I saw the film when it came out, and I was absolutely shocked by that tiny episode. I think it only occupies about 12 seconds, when the alien comes out of John Hurt's stomach. It was one of the most extraordinary moments in movie history, and it's not just me who feels that. Millions of people all over the world have identified that as one of the top three or top five most horrific moments in movie history. Now the reason I bought it was, unlike for example the shower scene in Hitchcock's movie Psycho, where the woman is hacked to death, that was a horrible scene or The Exorcist, where the girl's head goes round and round, the fact is this is an object. It wasn't just a cinematic moment created by film, this object actually exists. And I think it's a really horrible thing, but for me it is the object that was in that film. And it's one of those things that happened, that can never happen again and you will never ever see in film. Unless it is a parody or a satire, you will never see something like that coming out of somebody's stomach again. It was such an extraordinary moment. Many people have come to my house and admired it. You know, it works. It has got pumps that make the gills move up and down at the sides of the head. It makes the jaw open and close. All sorts of things happen. So next time anybody reading this watches the film and sees the moment when it comes out of John Hurt's stomach, just remember I have that object in my home. I know it cost a lot of money, but on the other hand I do firmly believe that it is an investment for the future. And it gives a lot of interest to me and my friends in the present time.\n\n21st January 2005 - Pouya (22) from Iran:\n\nDear Chris de Burgh, I have two questions. Maybe you think hey slow down but I like to know do you have any plan to release another album in 2005 or do you have a plan for later? Do you write any songs and lyrics right now for next album? I think it will be a nice idea if you could give this chance to your fans around the world to come with some titles for your next album. Maybe it gives you some more idea to write new songs after you see titles. You know people around the world have a lot of different great idea. My second question is about internet. I like to know how much you spend on the internet to search and find related websites and news about yourself and your work. I think it is great to see different websites and sources about our own works. And finally did you find any of those websites interesting? Actually these are questions from a group of your fans from Iran. I hope you answer to my questions because I sent different questions before but I was never lucky to get an answer. Have a great day my forever favourite singer.\n\nI keep on stressing how much I look forward to going to Iran to sing, and I really hope that I can do that soon. My plans for 2005 are firstly that I am involved in a film called \"Through These Eyes\". I have written some songs for that and we are very much hoping that we start the production of this film in 2005, which obviously will mean for me doing some recording for soundtrack. I have been approached by a leading European playwright who wants me to become involved in a musical, which I find a very exciting idea, which I hope to also do in 2005. Another plan is to record some songs from my past catalogue again in a different style and a different way, plus some new material. That might be a good plan to do early in the year. And I feel fit and I really love doing what I do and I can't see that I am ready to stop. Certainly after the touring that I have done last year, seeing the response of people of all ages, I strongly feel that people still really want to see me. Indeed in the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, to sell out that big place just for a solo performance, one guy with a guitar and piano, selling more than 7,000 tickets, well that is quite an extraordinary achievement. That tells me I am not ready to put my 12 string guitar to bed quite yet. The internet is a wonderful place to look for virtually any information about anything. And I do spend a little time on the internet. I must admit, not a lot. I do check out some other websites. Particularly on my own website, I read the guestbook quite a bit, I am really interested in the comments that are made. Astrid herself has been wonderful in helping me and indeed you to get all this information out to you, so a big debt of gratitude is owed to Astrid. And I hope she won't be shy and leave this bit off, but I want to say in public thank you very much for all your help and support. And I go onto the Yahoo site and I look at some of the comments which are very interesting. I am not sure everybody understands that I actually do read this stuff, but it doesn't matter. What they say is what they feel, and I find it interesting. And the interesting ones, also the websites from Iran? Yeah, I've checked them out.\n\n3rd April 2005 - Chris de Burgh\n\nHello everyone! This is just to let you know that I am working on a lot of questions for MOtL at the moment. Sorry it has taken so long, but the answers should be back on the website in the next few weeks. I would also like to express my enormous gratitude and thanks for the wonderful book of greetings that I was given at the Dortmund fan meeting. Most impressive!!! Love, Chris de Burgh\n\n13th May 2005 - Chris de Burgh\n\nHi everybody! It's great to be back here again on MOtL. Thank you for all your questions, and comments, and remarks that you have sent in the last few months. I regularly read the guestbook and the wonderful things people have written for me to read. And I also keep a close eye on the Yahoo website which is also extremely interesting. I am going to try and answer all the questions that were sent through to me.\n\nI'll start off by saying again I'd like to thank Astrid for all her tremendous hard work in the past and of course in the future. And many congratulations on the safe arrival of Jonas a couple of months ago. I hope Robin is getting on great with his new baby brother, and I am sure in years to come they'll be great friends. I hope everything is going well for you.\n\nI'd also like to thank all those involved with the fantastic tribute CD that was sent to me. Each one is getting better and better, the quality is getting higher and higher. And perhaps even one day someone singing on this tribute CD now or in the future will get noticed by a record company and have their own records to make as well. That would be a fantastic thing to happen. So, congratulations to all concerned for your hard work and your dedication. I really enjoyed listening to that CD.\n\n14th May 2005 - Patricia Guilhermina Torres Afonso (19) from Porto, Portugal:\n\nHello! I love your songs! I write poems sometimes and I send them to a band. But my poems are much worse than the lyrics of your songs. My question is: Is there any difference between a poem written to be sung and a poem written to be read, I mean, are there any poems that are useless for songs? Or should I just give up? Thank you for reading this! And congratulations for the results of your work. You are a real artist! Bye... Patricia\n\nWell, I don't think I would be a particularly good poet. Poetry relies on a different set of disciplines and rules than lyric writing, because writing lyrics, what I am trying to do, is marry the sound of a word with the musical note that it sits in with. So if anything, it's possibly a little more difficult to put a good lyric to a piece of music. Secondly, what you are trying to convey with a word in music is the same emotion that the music is trying to convey as well. I can give you an example of this. If you listen to my song \"Borderline\" - the line \"I watched a bunch of soldiers heading for the war, I could hardly even bear to see them go.\" Now, if that was just written down as a poem, it wouldn't be particularly significant. But I do believe that the melody that carries those words is strong enough to convey the emotion that I am trying to get across. In particular the word \"bunch\", which is not a very nice word, but it indicates the sort of feeling that the singer is having about war and how people are caught up in it, not just individually, but also collectively. I think, if you are writing poems for songs, you have to work very very closely with the person who is writing the songs. A lot of people often think they have written a song, or send me songs which are indeed just poems. A song is a piece of music. So, Patricia, keep writing the poetry, because poetry is beautiful to read. But it is not necessarily going to work with music as easily as a lyric writer will be able to put together his words with a musician.\n\n15th May 2005 - Gunter Kohl (31) from Trier, Germany:\n\nWhen you're at home and discovering a beautiful simple good sounding melody - how do you know, that you've just invented it or that you only remember music you've heard before? When I'm improvising melodies on my piano this question is always in my head: Is that me or my memory?\n\nI am very fortunate that I have a melodic recall, which is not as good as a computer, but I always feel it is pretty good. I often hear a so-called new melody on the radio and I can identify frequently three or four songs that this melody has come from. I think it is very difficult to come up with new melodies these days, because we are only dealing with a small number of musical notes. And the pop music field in particular is just jammed with frequently heard melodies, you know, that many of us have heard in the past. I think one of the reasons for this is, very few modern musicians if any are as gifted as the great melody writers in the past: Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin for example. So we tend to repeat ourselves. But I am always very very careful to try and make sure that the melodies that I write don't come from somewhere else. Unless it is of course from my own music, in which case I don't feel so bad about it. But there are people now, lawyers, who are called musicologists, whose job it is to take people to court for stealing melodies. Unfortunately this does go on a lot and a lot of very famous people have been caught by either deliberately or accidentally stealing other people's music. You have to have quite a few notes to make it a court action, and then of course you have to give over a lot of the royalties. One of the most famous cases was George Harrison, who inadvertently copied another song for his work \"My Sweet Lord\", and he had to give a lot of the money earned from that to the original writers of the melody that he took. The best way to discover whether or not a melody is original is play it to two or three friends who also love music and say \"does this sound familiar?\". A very good example again of this happening was when Paul McCartney wrote his song \"Yesterday\". He was so convinced that he had heard it before, that he played it to a few people, including the rest of the Beatles and said \"have you heard this before?\". And none of them had, which convinced him that it was an original melody. And we all know what happened to that song subsequently, becoming one of the most played songs of all time on radio.\n\n16th May 2005 - Myrte (27) from The Netherlands:\n\nDear Chris, I have great admiration for your work and I think that you are a great artist on making songs that really act out a specific feeling, both in the text as well as in the music! I am already some time wondering if there is any chance that you might write a song about home-abuse (do I have the word I mean?) So, husbands hitting their wife or vice versa. I think that you would be thé artist to make a song about that, that really speaks/sounds for itself! (I'm sorry, my English isn't all that brilliant.) With great admiration, Myrte, Netherlands.\n\nYes, it would be possible to write a song about this subject. I don't think it would be a very happy song. And again I tend to avoid writing songs about things that we read in the papers or watch on TV on the news on a regular basis. I like to create a bit of a fantasy world from time to time, although it's obviously very important to study realism and reality as well. I did have a look at a difficult subject recently with the song called \"One Upon A Time\" which I am sure many of you have heard. It looks at the child's point of view in the break-up of a marriage and how the child can never understand why it's happening. Often children believe it's their fault that mother and father are fighting and breaking up. And this is never the truth. Parents fight for very different reasons and very very rarely about the child. But the guild that the child feels is a terrible thing, a terrible burden through the rest of their lives. But I'll certainly consider this one. I think another topic that I have been asked to have a look at is orphans, children who have been abandoned by their mother for some reason. That again can leave a very unhappy feeling throughout somebody's life, wondering why was I given away at birth. It's an interesting topic, but it has to be dealt with very very sensitively.\n\n17th May 2005 - Jeanette (43) from Essex, UK:\n\nHello Chris, if there was one thing you could change about your life what would that be? I wish you had fallen in love with me, the way that I have fallen for you. But I can't sing, you inspire me. Love you lots, Jeanette xxxxx\n\nYou know, I am a very happy person the way I am. I'd certainly like either to be a few inches taller or a few kilos lighter. My body mass index (BMI) indicates that if I had been about four inches taller, I wouldn't be too worried about my weight. But I must admit, I wouldn't mind losing a few pounds. Although I do take regular exercise. I swim a lot, I walk at speed. Recently I bought for my family a treadmill which you find in gymnasiums. And it's an absolutely amazing machine, because you can walk up hills at high speed and run and in twenty minutes you can have a hell of a good workout. What else would I change about my life? It's a very tough one. I don't really think I'd change anything, I always feel to be doing something that I love to do. And to do something that I feel is significant and changes other people's lives in a better way some of the time, is possibly the best job in the world. There are obviously things about one's personality that you possibly would like to change, but for me it's not a significant problem. I am perfectly happy with the way I am. Unfortunately, Jeanette, I have never met you, but who knows, in the future I might. And thank you for your kind words of inspiration.\n\n18th May 2005 - Ilka (34) from Allmersbach, Germany:\n\nHi Chris, have you ever heard of the Irish Folk band Bachelors Walk? It's a bunch of Irish musicians (actually one Englishman also ;o)) who live and perform in Germany, but also abroad. I've been to a concert of them last weekend, and it was great! Traditional folk music, jigs, reels etc. - fantastic! Led me to the question whether you have ever thought of having a folk band with you on stage. What do you think of the \"traditional Irish music\" and do you like it? All the best for you! Ilka\n\nNo, I have never heard of them. But Bachelors Walk is a famous street in Dublin. Irish music is very popular in Germany, it is feel-good-music, it is fun. And memorably I remember Paddy Maloney and The Chieftains, when they played on my song \"The Connemara Coast\" on the album \"Power Of Ten\", was talking about a review they once had for a concert review in New York, where the reviewer was saying that the Chieftains music awakens echoes in him that he didn't even know he had. And I think beautiful Irish music can be very inspiring, I think it can make you think of all sorts of historical and spiritual things. Indeed we have the power nowadays, because we see so much visual image in our lives, with television and film and photographs, that when we hear Irish music we can almost visualize a seascape or a cliff edge or a man with a donkey cart or whatever it happens to be. Rain falling down in the West of Ireland, these things are easy to visualize and by using music we can use musical clues to create a feeling that you are actually there. A sort of visual stimulation to help you believe that you are actually seeing what the musician himself is attempting to convey to you. Curiously enough I am looking at creating a new style of music for a project I have coming up. And part of that would be using traditional Irish music, but in a form that isn't identifiable as Irish. I would marry it with Eastern European music and possibly something from South America, to create a new sort of a blend of world music. And it is possible that some day I will actually be on stage with this kind of combination of music.\n\n19th May 2005 - Jan-Peter van Oudheusden (22) from Ede, The Netherlands:\n\nHi Chris! During the concert at the Pepsi Stage in Amsterdam, on June 5, I noticed that you took the time for those people who offered you flowers during the show. I really think that's a good thing, because you're getting real close to your fans. My question is: Before the show begins, do you plan every song (length, when to play etc.)? Do you also plan a specific amount of time for 'people with flowers', or is it more like 'OK. Let's play and we shall see what will happen'? I hope you can give me an answer. Keep up the good work!\n\nWell, I never really plan a specific time for people to give me flowers and for me to accept them. I tend to be very flexible about these things, but when it comes to a concert set, because I am working with a fairly complicated light and sound team, I can't switch around too much because that really throws them. I think you would have noticed during that concert that I use a lot of visuals behind me, created by a wonderful team of guys from Southern Germany. And if I started moving things around too much, it would cause a lot of confusion. But as far as accepting flowers, you know, I love that. It's not just flowers; people bring me bottles of wine and pictures of their children and love letters even. And this is a very genuine way of people saying \"thank you for helping me in my life\", or just a genuine way of saying \"thank you, I love your music\".\n\n20th May 2005 - Sandy Williams (25) from Burlington, Ontario, Canada:\n\nI have been a big fan of yours since I was 8 years old. My older brother and sister introduced me to your music. Years ago they recorded some of your concerts such as The Munich Concert, The Simple Truth Concert, The Getaway and more recently, the Beautiful Dreams tour. Now that I have purchased a DVD writer I would love to transfer these onto DVD but I'm finding the quality has degraded too much. Do you have any plans to release these concerts onto DVD because I ..and I'm sure I can speak for many others.. would love to watch them.\n\nWell, Sandy, I am looking forward to being back again in Canada in November 2005, hopefully to do some concerts in your area. And your question about the video tapes transferred to DVD: I believe there is a very good case for saying yes we should do this, because, as you say, the VHS tapes are degrading a lot. In fact recently I transferred through a company in Scotland about 180 of my family videos, you know, half hour videos, one hour videos onto DVD. And the quality is just superb. So rather than having to watch them on a lower quality VHS player now through DVD it's great. So I think it would be a wonderful idea to get the DVDs of the concerts that you referred to. And it'll certainly make me feel better, because I think I look an awful lot younger and more energetic!\n\n21st May 2005 - H. Engelbrecht (40+) from Bredasdorp, South Africa:\n\nWhat was Patricia the Stripper originally written about, (re 1924 in the song)?\n\nI am sure I have told this story before, but I will tell it again. I was in England, this was in about 1973, and at this time as a solo performer I was occasionally playing the odd folk club, but prior to that I have been singing in my father's castle hotel and in a hamburger restaurant in Dublin called Captain America's cookhouse. And occasionally I'd write songs with strange and unusual words like \"Hot Barrel Hannah\" and \"Star Spangled Tangerine Seethrough Topless Trousers\". And in this particular genre I had been at a rather boring and rather posh weekend in the East of England. And everybody was very la-di-da the whole weekend. And as I flew home to Ireland, I was imagining myself as part of this setup, but actually secretly inside I didn't want to play tennis with these people or hang out at posh dinners wearing a tuxedo. I wanted to be downtown with Patricia who was the best stripper in town. The words 1924, I don't know where they came from, but I was going through the words in my head recently and I was thinking this is a pretty unusual song. And I think the words are quite clever, and I certainly find that people still enjoy listening to it.\n\n22nd May 2005 - Damien Donovan (19) from Ireland:\n\nHi. I'm an aspiring musician, and almost accidentally stumbled across your music two years ago, I immediately realised the quality and substance of your music. Firstly I would like to express my admiration and thanks for you music. Now, the main question I would like to ask of you is, who were your musical influences when you started music? And secondly, a lot of your songs contain fantastic, sometimes haunting, sometimes soothing orchestration. Do you arrange the orchestral parts yourself? I think that's about it. Oh, and what instruments do you yourself play? Thanks again.\n\nNice to hear a 19 year old boy from Ireland getting in touch! Aspiring musician? Well, I wish you luck! These are different times to create music, but I think the best advice I can give anybody starting the music business is: Learn your trade from the bottom up! I don't think there is any successful business man who hasn't sampled the low end of his company. The bottom end of for example a hotel, successful hoteliers have always started in kitchens and working as bellboys and behind reception desks. You've got to know your trade inside out to give yourself a chance of not only becoming successful, but more importantly staying successful. So good luck and thank you for your kind words about my music! My musical influences, I would refer to as being great writers like Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, of course John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Later on they would be Sting, Peter Gabriel. People, whose music still stands the test of time, people who wrote very clever songs. These are craftsmen. If you can look upon a songwriter as somebody for example on a level who makes furniture, beautiful furniture, you can't make a beautiful table or a beautiful chair without having a lot of knowledge about how you put these things together, becoming as it were an apprentice. And so the people that I admire, they learned their apprenticeship almost exclusively from live performance, and I think that's where the strength of my songwriting comes from. Live performance gives you a very strong insight into how people react to music, and what they like to hear and how to surprise them and how you can create dynamics on stage. All those things, if you bring that to your songwriting, it can make a huge difference. The orchestrations in my music are, because I can't write or read music, created by an orchestrator. It is usually somebody like Chris Cameron that I have used recently, who will write an orchestral part to a song under guidance and with help from me, as I try to explain what exactly I am after. I don't give them a song and say \"well, do what you want with it\". These people will always provide a rough demo of what they planned and I will listen to it and say \"no, change that string sound, change the horns, or make this melodic movement a bit stronger\", or whatever. So I am very much involved with the orchestration, although I don't actually write the finished product. I play the keyboard and the guitar.\n\n23rd May 2005 - Mau Van Le (44) from Norway, originally from Viet Nam:\n\nDear Chris! Thank you for the beautiful music that I've been listening for the last 25 years. Your music brings to me experiences that make my life rich. I could listen to the same song over and over and every time it's a different feeling. I really love the songs: Flying Home, Some things never change, Missing You, Broken Wings, Fatal Hesitation and many more. But there is one song that I love very much. As a refugee from South Viet Nam I settled in Norway in 1975 and could not return to my homeland before the year 2000. For me it was very exciting and just 10 minutes before landing the captain addressed my homecoming and turned on your beautiful song Flying Home. I felt something touched me at that moment and I also felt the warmth of tears on my face. \"The last time I cried\" was 25 years ago when I fled my motherland. Every time listening to \"Flying Home\" I feel \"the freedom in my soul\". So Chris, now you know a little bit why your songs touch me. I just wonder how/where you got the inspiration of crafting \"Flying Home\"? Is it \"The Simple Truth\" that you wish to make the world a better place to live through your music? It makes my world better!! Thank You Chris. My best regards to you and your family.\n\nI think anybody reading this question cannot help but be moved and touched by the emotions expressed. To have to leave your homeland and live somewhere else, even in a comfortable country like Norway, must be difficult. And the feelings expressed, the songs that you love \"Flying Home\", \"Some Things Never Change\", \"Missing You\" and so on, the story that you come up with about the captain turning on the song \"Flying Home\" and the way you responded by crying, that is an extraordinary story. And whenever you hear it, you think about Viet Nam, your mother land. I got the idea of \"Flying Home\", because I was at that time spending a lot of time in America. I was lonely, getting up the ladder of success. But it is terribly, terribly hard and anybody who thinks that it is easy should have been with me every step on the way, because it was really really tough. And a lot of the time I was unhappy, miserable. I often questioned what I was doing, whether I should be carrying on. I had friends back home. If I was married at the time, I had a wife back home waiting for me to come back, Diane. And all I can say is, I'm a person who can accept a lot of pain, a lot of turmoil in my life. I'm very strong inside, and I am surrounded by strong people. But nevertheless there have been times when I felt really sad. And \"Flying Home\" was written, I am sure, underneath one of those moods. About the feeling that you get, when you are finally on the aeroplane and you are heading home. It's just one of the best feelings in the world. It's the release of all those tensions and emotions. And also, if you have done a good job, the feeling that you have done a really good job and you can now relax and head back home. So as I am sure regular readers of this know, I feel that if I can express the emotion that I have inside successfully in music and words, then I have succeeded in transferring the emotion that I feel. \"The Simple Truth\", well this is about children. They are innocent. We must protect them from war, from all the horrible things that grown-ups can do to them. And that's why I am saying in \"The Simple Truth\": \"the life of a child is more than a forest, the life of a child is more than a border, the life of a child is more than religion, the life of a child is only a heartbeat from eternity\". And you listen to those words in the song and like me I hope you get a real chill. I think that's probably one of my top three favourite songs that I have ever recorded. And I did produce that one myself. And it always moves me when I hear it, because I play it at home really loudly. It takes me back to the emotion that I was attempted to convey.\n\n24th May 2005 - Deborah Madge (36) from St. Helens, Lancashire, UK:\n\nHi Chris, you once mentioned that you would consider doing two separate concerts, one for the oldies (like myself!) with you playing only the older hits and one for the newer fans, with you playing the more recent stuff, is it still an idea that you are considering and, if so, then when will it be?\n\nI am very amused to see that you refer to yourself as one of the oldies. As far as I am concerned, you are a really young one! The two sets of music? Well, I actually went to a concert a couple of years ago where a performer was playing one night his songs from the 60s and 70s, the next night from the 70s and 80s and so on. And it was pretty good! But it could be a little boring as well. But I can see that there would be definitely an interest for me in some day performing, you know, one night only songs from, say, the first five albums, and then the next night only songs from the next five, and so on. That would be quite interesting. You've put a little seed of an idea in my brain, Deborah. As far as when it'll be, I really don't know. But it is a definite possibility, if such a thing exists.\n\n25th May 2005 - Christina Martin (24) from England:\n\nChris, I think you should be knighted for your contribution to music. What honour would make you proudest?\n\nWell, I personally don't think I should be, but what a nice idea. \"Sir Chris de Burgh\"! Mmmh, has a certain ring to it, doesn't it? You know, I work abroad a lot, I travel a lot and I am fortunate to have a successful international career. And any honour from a foreign country, which means a lot to them in that country, to bestow upon somebody like me who comes from Ireland, would be a tremendous thing for me to receive. I was honoured by the Red Cross in Portugal some years ago for my contribution to the Red Cross and the things I have done for them in the past. And I was very proud of that. Similarly, I think I would be very proud to receive such an honour from a country in which I didn't necessarily live. Ireland does not have an honour system, which in some way is a good thing, in some way is a bad thing, because it really depends on who gives out these honours. That adds to the credibility.\n\n26th May 2005 - Mark Gardiner (34) from Wallasey, England:\n\nHi Chris, I've been listening to your songs for years now (since I was 16!) and one of my favourites is Crying & Laughing. I've always wondered about the woman in the story. Where is she, who is she with and who is she going back to on the plane?\n\nThe scenario I had in my head was a short film about a man from the West, say from America or England or indeed anywhere in what we call the Western World, who had been to Russia or the Eastern bloc in the time when there was a Cold War on. And he was a business man, and he had gone over there and he had fallen in love. And he is on his way home. We are not quite sure what he is going home to, whether he has a wife and family back home. But whatever has happened, he has fallen madly in love with this local girl and they are in the car on the way to the airport. And \"searchlights, rain on the road\", this indicates that they are in a country where there is a lot of pressure on the local citizens. Secret police, army and so on in the streets, creating a feeling of danger. And he has to go and she has to stay. That's why \"crying and laughing\", it means crying obviously for the sadness of parting, laughing because of the memories that they have had of the wonderful times together. And he will be half a world away, across the other side of the world, dreaming of her. And in this piece of music, those who know it will hear engines starting at the end, like in the film \"Casablanca\", when Humphrey Bogart says good-bye to the girl who gets on the plane. And you can hear the engines starting up and he goes back. And you can tell that inside he is crying, but he is trying to be brave as well. So I was creating a sort of musical film, I suppose you could call it, during this particular song.\n\n27th May 2005 - Pete Bailey (50) from Hull, England:\n\nHi Chris, I am originally from Rhodesia and have been a fan of yours since I heard \"The Girl With April In Her Eyes\" and was so impressed I went and bought that album, plus the two previous ones, and have bought every album since. Since moving to Europe in 1982 (Germany for 8 years and now live in England) I have seen you in concert 5 times. I am going to be at the concert in Nottingham on the 11th Oct, (Had the tickets since Feb) in the stalls in seat C4, which I am led to believe is the third row from the front. I have always wanted to meet you, but I realise this is for the select few. Now my question is this. You have written so many songs over the years, and yet you can't really be set in any one genre, as you do rock as well as ballads, both with equally brilliant results, but do you consciously sit down to write a rock song or a ballad, or is it just what takes over you mind at the time. i.e., apart from anyone who knows your music and your voice, The Power Of Ten (more rock) and The Road To Freedom (more ballad) are two complete different genres, and could easily have been done by different people. Looking forward to seeing you on the 11th.\n\nBy now you will have seen me in concert in Nottingham on the 11th of October. Hope you enjoyed it! It's an interesting question about styles of songwriting, because I have always been drawn to various styles. Although, as I said in an earlier question, the rock area of music is fairly limiting and limited, but I try to break away from that by using my imagination to go into areas that don't necessarily get the interest of other rock writers. You know, I would say my most recent album \"The Road To Freedom\" illustrates this best. I hope in the future to go into even more musically unusual areas. Away from the restrictions of, I suppose, the format that most modern rock music has to adhere to, which is the three and a half minute radio song. I have always been interested in breaking free of that culture of thinking and to try and create through music and imagination and words something a bit more far reaching, something more important to say. It's true to say that \"The Power Of Ten\" and \"The Road To Freedom\" are different. Well, one of the strong reasons behind this is that with \"The Power Of Ten\" I was touring with a band as I was with \"Timing Is Everything\" and indeed \"Quiet Revolution\". But with \"The Road To Freedom\" I literally had the freedom to do whatever I wanted. And it was for me to perform solo. With other records, when you are writing songs for a band to perform, you are keenly aware that you have to really write music that a band can play, will enjoy playing, and that an audience will enjoy hearing, which means involving drums, bass guitar and other various instruments that happen to be in the band.\n\n28th May 2005 - Wayne Barrett (47) from New Zealand, now living in Turkey:\n\nChris, I'm a long term fan since \"Crusader\" days and have even attempted to sing one of your songs on stage in the 80's when I was in a dance band as drummer and occasional vocalist. I couldn't reach the top notes though... I just wondered what your vocal range is, and how much vocal warm-up you do before a performance? The reason for my dual \"nationality\" by the way is that I have moved from NZ to work in Turkey for a few years. (had to leave the drums behind...sob)\n\nHi Wayne! I have been to Turkey a few times, it is a great country and the people are terrific. And I look forward to welcoming Turkey to the Economic Union at some stage, sooner hopefully rather than later. I hope you are enjoying yourself there. What a pity about leaving your drums behind, I am sure you have come up with some native drums. Because native music is fascinating. Some of the best records I have are from deepest Africa or from the top of the Andes or unusual places like that. As far as my vocal range is concerned, I have about three octaves, three and a half octaves really I suppose. Although it is an inevitable thing as you get older, your range will start getting a little less. But nevertheless I exercise my voice like I would exercise any other muscle in my body. And my voice becomes strongest after I have been out singing on tour. I have often been in a recording studio either just before or just after, and it's a marked difference certainly to my producer, the strength of my voice. Because after sung on stage for 2 1/2 hours every night, 34 or 36 songs, after a few weeks of that, your voice does get very strong. As long, and I have to stress this, as long as you breathe in the correct way. Because too many people, too many singers, they sing from the top of their chest rather than from their stomach. And that way you'll put a terrible strain on your voice. I have always been very aware of that. And the second point is to drink a lot of water. So even if I, or anybody who is a singer, enjoys taking a few drinks after a show, always compensate with lots of water, avoid smoke. For me smoke is a very dangerous thing and I hate it so much. It's such a pleasure to be able to go out in Ireland into pubs and bars and public places where there is no smoking, in restaurants as well. You don't smell the smoke, and you don't breathe in other people's smoke and affect your own health, and more critically for a singer, you don't get chest infections and it doesn't affect your voice. So avoid smoke and take plenty of exercise and drink plenty of water!\n\n29th May 2005 - Ehab Lotayef (46) from Canada:\n\nIn Crusader you mention Richard recapturing Jerusalem. I found no reference to this in any history book. Did you get this from a certain source (which) or was this your alternate (artists liberty) version of history?\n\nYou know what; I'd have to check my history books on this one. I did some fairly extensive research, but I thought that the crusaders did actually take Jerusalem. But I think on a number of occasions they lost it again. So I bow to your greater knowledge on this occasion. Maybe what I should do is check my history books again. There is one part of this incidentally which is of interest that some people have suggested that I have a problem with Saladin and the Islamic religion. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have always been the first to go on record to say that I believe every man can have is own believes and faiths, and it is up to nobody else to tell them that they are wrong. But thanks again for your question, and I will go and check again. I am pretty sure that on that particular crusade Jerusalem was taken. But I'll have to go back into my history.\n\n30th May 2005 - Mohammad (19) from Tehran, Iran:\n\nHi Chris I wanna know that what would you do if you were an invisible man??\n\nThis is a fascinating question! This is the first time I have ever been asked this and it requires a bit of thought. I suppose, if I was living in a repressionist regime like in Iran, it would be wonderful to be an invisible person. To be able to affect things from an invisible point of view and therefore a secure point of view, where nobody could attack you, force your opinions to change, where you could actually create through your good works a chance that democracy could shine through, that young people have a chance to live their lives the way they want to. As far as being an invisible man in my own home, I think people would get pretty bored of it after a while and so would I, but it's an extraordinary concept and requires a bit of thought. I'd be interested to see what other people's response would be. Perhaps as people read this answer, they could also log onto the guestbook and say \"Yes, I would like to be an invisible person for the following reasons:\" and then state their reasons.\n\n31st May 2005 - Chris de Burgh\n\nThanks again for all the wonderful messages on the website - and on Yahoo - that I read on a regular basis. I was smiling about a recent note on the guestbook, \"Chris, when will you visit Turkey again?\" Well, I was in Istanbul with my family from May 24 to May 26 to support our team Liverpool in the Champion's League Final on Wednesday, May 25th. If you saw this match on TV, or were lucky enough to be there, you would have seen what has been universally described as the most exciting final in 50 years! Liverpool struggled in the first half against an excellent AC Milan side who scored 3 good goals before half time. We were in despair at the break, many fans in tears or leaving the ground, as our team seemed doomed to a humiliating defeat. A lone voice in the crowd started to sing the team's anthem, hoping to be heard in the dressing room to give hope to the players. Suddenly forty thousand voices took up the words of \"You'll never walk alone\", and as the teams emerged for the second half, we roared support for our boys with an awesome display of noise. What happened next has already gone down in the annals of history. With the addition of German International - and my friend - Didi Hamann, Liverpool crushed the heart out of Milan with a blinding three goals in six minutes. As the game went into extra time, there were moments of amazing luck and courage, with players running and tackling beyond the limits of their endurance, pain etched on their faces. Then came the penalty shoot-out, and drama of the highest order. It was almost impossible to watch, but when the first Milan shot flew over the bar and Jerzy Dudek, Liverpool's Polish goalkeeper, saved the second Milan penalty, it seemed our team's name was destined to be on the Cup. The tension was unbearable, and when Milan's shot from Shevshenko, who looked white with nerves, was saved by Dudek, the Liverpool supporters exploded with a joy, a euphoria and a disbelief that is almost impossible to describe in words. WE HAD WON THE CHAMPION'S LEAGUE, AGAINST ALL THE ODDS!! Tears rolled down the cheeks of tough men from Liverpool, people hugged strangers and we shouted, screamed and sang our appreciation for a group of players who had shown an incredible display of courage and self-belief epitomised by Captain and man-of-the-match, Steven Gerrard, coming back from a situation that seemed to be utterly hopeless, but driven on by sheer passion and heart. It was a privilege to have been there, and thanks to all the people we met from Turkey who showed us such kindness. I will return!\n\n1st June 2005 - Robin Thibeault (46) from Pointe-Claire, Québec, Canada:\n\nDear Chris, my husband & I have long been fans of yours, and so are our children especially our oldest. Your music has always been in our lives, at our wedding a friend sang In a country churchyard. We have gone to see you every time you come to Montreal, the last time you came our eldest came with us. It was an awesome experience. Last year in July (he) our eldest got married and although it's wonderful, seeing him leave home was very hard. When I heard the song on Road to Freedom, with you and your daughter Rosanna singing it brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. I was wondering what Diane's reaction to that song was when she first heard it? Do you get emotional when you sing it? Well take good care of you and your family, With thanks and our best wishes to you all, Robin Thibeault.\n\nI think everybody knows my extreme affection and fondness for Canada and in particular French Canada. And whenever I perform in Québec or Trois Rivières or Montréal or Sherbrooke, anywhere in the Québec area, I am greeted with such an overpowering sense of warmth and emotion, it is joyous. That's not to say it doesn't happen elsewhere in Canada, but there's something about the French-Canadians which I think you can only find uniquely there. So thank you for that, and I look forward to being back in Canada later this year. This is about the song \"Here For You\". The first time I played it, I had the idea for it and I played the first part to Diane, my wife, in our old home. It was actually quite a long time ago. And I played the piano and I said \"I've got this idea\". And I set the scene about this is at the airport, and the parents are saying good-bye. And unfortunately I could only get into the first verse, before I had to stop because I was so choked up. And her eyes were full of tears as well. Because you start imagining what it must be like, to have your child leave and go away. Although it is for the reasons that the song is trying to express, which is exciting for the child who is leaving, but also very emotional. I recently sent a copy of \"The Road To Freedom\" to the president of Ireland, Mary McAleese. And I wrote, because she is a wonderful woman and I am friendly with the lady and her husband, I wrote a short story about what I saw in my mind in that song, about the scene at the airport that I had just described. She wrote a lovely letter back again, saying that the timing was brilliant, because just a few days later, after she heard the song, she went to the airport to say good-bye to her elder boy who was heading off to, I think, Australia or America for a year and a half. And she was very emotionally moved by the experience, and I think that the song helped her through that, perhaps to understand it. And it is a song to sing to convey emotion. I think the only time I performed it was at the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, and I did get very emotional during it. I think I'd better do it a bit more often, because it touches people. Not just the people who are thinking about their child leaving, but also it touches people who are that child leaving and saying good-bye to their friends and parents.\n\n2nd June 2005 - Thelma Heath (62) from Chichester, Sussex, UK:\n\nI discovered your music when visiting Bulgaria for a skiing holiday before the 'Wall' came down and have since attended several of your concerts and have never been disappointed. You have a good family life and appreciate the importance of those close to you, but do you have any furry members of the family? If so what are they and do you think that there is an advantage for children to be brought up with animals?\n\nYes, I very much appreciate my family being around me and the importance of my family. Yes, we do have - well, I wouldn't describe my dog as a furry animal - but we have a dog called Milly. She is a black labrador and she is 9 years old. She is terrific fun. Recently I was going through some old video tapes which I have had transferred to DVD of family life and growing up, and lots of it seems to centre on the dog. And the fun and the love she has brought into our lives, starting from when we first saw her as a puppy in a litter. And we were given a choice of I think about seven or eight puppies. Some of which were black little baby labradors, others were chocolate coloured. And two in particular stood out. And I think we always like to think it's the dog that chooses us. Well, my daughter Rosanna wound up with this tiny little puppy. And filming it at the time and seeing it now and the things she has done down the years is so funny. I found another short film of the first time she saw snow. And she is leaping and hopping on all fours. Those of us who have dogs know how they can jump in the air, all four feet leaving the ground at the same time. Throwing herself into the snow and doing one of those crazy dog runs that dogs do, you know, with feet going everywhere and the tail flapping around. It is very funny. So, I think animals can bring an enormous amount of affection and love into people's lives. Not just older people, but I think great for children to grow up with animals in their home.\n\n3rd June 2005 - Wendy Beckett (41) from Coventry, UK:\n\nYour locations for your latest tour have included ones where you were able to do the \"Britney Spears\" bit walkabout, I think this is brilliant (Birmingham Symphony Hall last night!). Did you choose the locations so that you could do this and do you intend to do this again? For me it made it so much more personal and it was an intimate evening with Chris De Burgh. In the twenty five years I have been listening to your music last night was the best ever. Thank you for your music!! With Love, Wendy\n\nIt doesn't matter where I am. Certainly in the last tour, where we came up with this idea of doing it, I always work out a system where I can go down some steps. Sometimes I even have to walk out of the wings of the stage and out back into the audience that way, even disappearing for half a minute, carrying on playing and singing. But usually there are steps we organize in the front, so I can get into the audience. I think it's a wonderful feeling for me, and hopefully for the audience. It breaks down the barrier that can often be erected between a performer and the audience. And I work very hard to make sure that the audience, who are every bit as important, are part of the night as I am. And I like to get up close and see people as well! And see who is there, particularly when there are children in the audience. I like to have a bit of fun singing to them, or selecting somebody and sing a few lines to that person. It's pretty unusual to do, but I certainly feel very good about doing it. And I am sure I'll be carrying on doing the same thing in the future.\n\n4th June 2005 - Kelly (36) from Riverview, New Brunswick, Canada:\n\nHi again Chris, and may I say I am loving \"The Road to Freedom\". I ordered it from the web site and got it before it was released in Canada. I have to admit..I felt like a little school girl when Mr. Canada Post left me this wonderful present in my mail box on a gloomy March Friday afternoon. It's now October and I don't think it's left my CD player yet! As I mentioned, it's October and as we are all putting up decorations for Halloween I was wondering if you celebrate Halloween like we do here in Canada (carved pumpkins, decorate houses in scary decor, trick or treating, etc.)?? If so, were you able to enjoy the fun in going 'door-to-door' with your children trick or treating?? I saw you on Canada AM back in May and you had mentioned \"I'll be back\" referring to coming back to our great land...I look forward to seeing you again in concert. Thanks so much for all you do...you have no idea what it means to me!!\n\nNew Brunswick is an area that I know well as well from the past. Thank you for your words about \"The Road To Freedom\". I must admit that I still go back and listen to it. I have a bit of a problem with it now, because I don't know how I am going to do another album as good as that one. Because I think it's turning out to be one of the best that I have ever done. It has a unique feel to it. I particularly like the deep ideas. And also I have no interest in what the media think of it, I don't care about what people in general would think of it, as long as those who like it absolutely love it too. At this stage of my career, criticism doesn't touch me at all, because I made this album specifically for solo performance in this specific kind of a way, away from the usual disciplines that you have to follow when you are making these kinds of albums. This doesn't follow any particular discipline at all, it's just an unusual record. And very few records if any start with an instrumental and put a trilogy as the first three songs that link together. So it was my particular personal journey of discovery and revelation. You ask about Halloween. Yes, Halloween is a big deal in my country. Whether it is a commercial big deal or whether people really enjoy it, I am not quite sure. It's a bit of both, I suppose. My children now aged 21, 17 and 14 are probably too old for trick or treating. But they used to do it in earlier years and I used to go around with them to homes and knock on doors. And I've got lots of old films of them all dressed up in scary costumes. So they were great fun to do, and I think it's of course a very interesting thing and great fun for children. Halloween, All Saint's Night, is when I believe all the spirits of the dead emerge from the graves. And I think that's what we are trying to think about during Halloween Night. So it can be very scary.\n\n5th June 2005 - Maggie Hebblethwaite-Sharpe (48) from Hinckley, Leicestershire, UK:\n\nHello Chris. I only discovered this site during the summer and have been eagerly waiting for your return for weeks!! Although I have always loved your music it was this year at the Domplatz Bamberg where I first saw you in concert. I will NEVER forget that concert. I was sooo cold. It was so warm in England when I left for Bavaria that I only had summer clothes with me. But once you appeared I forgot my cold feet, hands, nose etc. ROFL. Your unassuming appearance, almost from nowhere, lit the cold night. I could feel the warmth and love that all of your fans have for you. It was like no other concert I have ever been to. You seem to have surpassed the ordinary \"Super Star\" status and have an extraordinary and completely honest relationship with your fans. As you said on the night it was more like a C De B party than a concert. So to my question, how do you perceive your success? Are you totally aware of the love and affection on a basic level that millions of people have for you? Is this the sort of response that you hoped for - dreamed of - in the early days, or has it taken you by surprise. There is so much I want to say to you, but realise that if I waffle on for too long you definitely won't answer my question, so I'll keep the other thousand or so questions, comments and compliments for another time. I really feel, as do the rest of your fans I would suppose, that you are such an approachable and honest man. Maybe one day I'll get to have a coffee and a chat with you. I hope so. Bye and God bless you and your lovely family. I hope to see you in concert again in Nottingham next week and I really can't wait. Love and best wishes Maggie.xxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThis is a lovely question and indeed short story about the concert in the Domplatz in Bamberg. Yes, it was very cold and also by now hopefully you will have enjoyed the concert in Nottingham. I remember it well, because it is really such a pretty place and there were a number of things that happened that night, including a dedication of a song to a young girl who was murdered in Nottingham the week before. That stayed in my mind. You've said a few things which are of great interest to me and I'll tell you why. You say I have surpassed the ordinary super star status and have an extraordinary and completely honest relationship with the fans. Well, I would agree with you there. Not that I have surpassed the super star thing, because I don't believe any, you know, the super star thing only comes from human beings and the jungle for example, the law of animals is power. But, you know, to be famous for me is not a big deal. I don't think anybody is any better than anybody else. I certainly do not believe that anybody is more divine than anybody else, which is why I have a bit of a problem with some aspects of organized religion, where we are told that there are people in the more exalted areas of the Hierarchy, have it believed that they are closer to God than the rest of us. This is absolute nonsense. Nobody is closer to God than anybody else. And this is the very foundation, I suppose, of my belief that we are all ordinary. You know, I have often come across people saying to me, you might be very famous, but you seem to be very down to earth. This is what I absolutely and sincerely and firmly believe. I don't have to work at it, it's the way I feel. And funnily enough my daughter Rosanna who was Miss World 2003, she feels exactly the same thing. People say \"but you are so nice, you are not bitchy, you're not stuck up, just ordinary!\" You know, this is the way we feel about people and about life. But anyway, thanks for what you say. And as for the affection in which I am held, I don't want to sound like I am searching for compliments here, but I don't think about it too often. I am always surprised by the lovely things that people write and say. I suppose one failing that I have is that I am not very good at accepting what I have achieved and how well I have done. I always seem to be living in the present and indeed looking to the future. So I am thrilled about the things that people say. And I am also very sincere about the fact that I do not like to buy into the cynical world of, you know, rude super stars. I don't see why people have to act like that. And I think in the end it will revert to them and cause them problems in the future. You cannot believe that you are anything different or special. So I like to think that I can bring this to my persona, to my public life and indeed my private life as well. But thanks for the lovely things you have said.\n\n6th June 2005 - Graham (50) from Nottingham, England:\n\nHi Chris. I love your music. The minor chord has often been associated with doom and gloom but you have used as a romantic visionary aid. Was this something you worked on or did it just happen that way? Keep those albums coming and as a song writer myself thanks for the inspiration.\n\nIt's an interesting thing. Not that I am a specialist or an expert in this field, but it seems to me that an awful lot of what we perceive as music has been created by the major key and the minor key in terms of mood. For example I think you'll find that a lot of folk music, if not all folk music, that is trying to describe the sadness of life on the land, the harshness of the farming life, to reflect the seasons as they change, you know the hard winters, that tends to be represented in minor key music. Whereas major key seems to be the celebration of harvest time, the celebration of life, of rebirth, of sunlight. That for me appears to really show the other side of music. It's almost the Yin and the Yang of music. If you want to see the effect of music, the subliminal effect, when you next go to see a film and there's a sad scene - listen very carefully to the music. And you'll find for example lots of dropping notes. When you have two or three notes that drop, one after the other, that is creating usually a sad feel. Whereas the reverse of notes going up tends to create the opposite feel. These are, I suppose, not exactly tricks of the trade, but there are things, the more you listen to music, and wonder about why they are having the effect that they do, the more you realize that we as human beings react in a fairly standard way, in a very similar way to the various ways musical notes move. And the way I like to use the minor key is to create not a very sad mood, but a reflective, melancholy mood perhaps, perhaps even a romantic, visionary mood as you have suggested. And I am glad that I am some kind of inspiration to you.\n\n7th June 2005 - Chris Raymond (53) from Whitton, Twickenham, UK:\n\nHello Chris! As you know I have been in the fortunate position to attend more than one Concert during a Tour. Most 'non C de B friends' think I'm crazy seeing the \"same\" Concert again but as any dedicated fan would tell them each Concert is unique! My question is - how soon into a gig would you say that you know what your audience will be like? I've certainly seen you walk on stage and be greeted so warmly that I've thought to myself, \"They're hooked already!\" but this is not always so. How much do you think the actual venue can impact on the audience response and therefore affect your performance? Hope to hear your thoughts on this. Thanks! Chris R xx\n\nHi Chris! Yes, I have seen you at many concerts, and we have met a number of times, and hopefully many times in the future. Every venue is different. There are so many different factors to take into consideration, wondering how the audience reaction is going to be. The only thing that I can say, as I have said in the past, to perform a concert is not dissimilar to seduction, where one would hope for a certain result, which is mutually satisfying to everybody in the audience. But how you get to that point, it demands subtlety, it demands respect, it demands so many different factors. For example you can't go out onto a concert stage, cold and start shouting at everybody: \"Clap your hands!\" Because nobody is going to want to. So every concert hall has its own strange and different feelings. If it's architecturally cold, if the seats aren't very comfortable, if the lighting in the hall is bright, if the stage is very high or indeed very low - there are so many different factors. If the sound is a bit woolly or it's a bit sharp, all these factors can have an impact on your audience. Whether for example, if you are doing two concerts in a city, if one is sold out before the other one, you usually find that the one that is sold out has a more vibrant crowd than the second one. Also the place that you play, some countries differ. Some areas in countries differ. So I usually know pretty soon when the house lights go out, then I can tell you probably within 5 seconds what kind of an evening it is going to be. Possibly less than 5 seconds. It's just an instant response, taking all the other factors on board, and judging that first moment of applause. Sometimes I am completely surprised and shocked, other times it's a bit of a struggle. But generally speaking by a certain point of a concert, I know that people are with me. In capital cities quite often you are playing concerts which are a little more difficult, because the people in capital cities are used to seeing lots of major acts coming through and they get a little spoiled. And it's almost like they sit there and say \"prove something to me\". The minor places, particularly the really outer way places, who never get major stars turning up, they are usually very grateful that you are there. But as I say, Chris, there are a lot of different factors that play here. And I think after all these years I am fairly experienced about knowing what to expect.\n\n8th June 2005 - Normand Allard (34) from Toronto, Canada:\n\nHi Chris, I am a French Canadian and really do appreciate the French songs you included in your latest albums. I translated myself \"Just A Word Away\" and sing it to my family, they just love it. So here are my questions: since your French is already amazing, do you help on the translation of your songs? Have you thought of writing a song in French only without translating it first from the English version? Thanks for your generosity and keep on writing those amazing songs. I always look forward to your new albums.\n\nThat's interesting that you translated \"Just A Word Away\", well done! My French is good enough, I think, to certainly communicate with people. And in the past I have recorded three songs in French, specifically for the French market, which is \"Quand Je Pense A Toi\" (When I Think Of You), \"Le Coeur D'Une Femme\" (A Woman's Heart) and \"Comme Un Rêve\" (Five Past Dreams). As far as the translation is concerned, it is very difficult to translate the song, if you are not a real French speaker. But when I see the translations I always amend them or change them with whoever has written the French lyrics. And change them to not only what I believe the meaning should be, but also more importantly to where the movement for words should be within the song, which is always critical.\n\n9th June 2005 - Marion Ben Rejeb (34) from Kronach, Germany:\n\nDear Chris, first of all let me thank you for your great and wonderful music. I am a great fan of you since about 25 years. Your music is with me in good and in sad times in my life. For whom did you write the song: \"Even Now\"? For me it's like a consolation about my mum, she died too young, with only 54 years. Thank you for this song. Take care, Marion\n\nFunnily enough I didn't have anybody in mind for this song. People have suggested various names to me that I could have written it about, but they would all be wrong. I think what I was suggesting here was, I had the image in my head of a young person, perhaps from a boy band like Westlife for example, standing on a stage alone. And for once, instead of singing those sugary ballads that mean absolutely nothing, to stand on the stage and sing something that meant a lot to that person, i.e. to give it a lot of emotion and to give it a lot of feeling. And I started this song actually when I was on holiday in Mauritius, and the words \"even now\" came out. And there is the clue, you see. When you say something like \"even now\", you are saying \"after all these years, after all this time, I am still going back somewhere that I have left in the past\". That's what it means to me. And it means really that, in spite of the way one's life has changed, moved on, perhaps different loves, different lifestyle, there's something that keeps drawing you back to a person. I know there's a major website now called \"Friends United\", which I have never clicked on, because I don't need to. But I know a lot of people have been on that, and there's an echo from the past that constantly calls and it's like a voice in the night calling out your name. And that's what I was thinking of when I wrote that song. I am glad that it reminds you of your mother. And 54 years is very very young to die, I am so sorry.\n\n10th June 2005 - Gletto (56) from the UK:\n\nDear Mr Burgh, I have followed your path since almost your first footsteps and how privileged I am to say that has been a marriage of bliss. When you wrote the song \"Shine On\" it bridged a gap in my life that is so silly. I had fallen out with my father over something that should have never come between us. However, if you haven't made a mistake then you haven't lived. That song allowed me to stand up and be counted and I did find the words to say \"I love you\". Please may I ask you if the song \"The words 'I love you'\" is a song that has been echoing in your mind. Finally, "
