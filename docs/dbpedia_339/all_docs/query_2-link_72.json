A few of the films listed here are made-for-television movies or direct-to-video releases. Most are theatrically-released feature films. There is a separate list of films with MAJOR characters who are Latter-day Saints.\n\nThe Alibi (2005)\n\nMain character (played by Steve Coogan) crosses paths with a high-minded assassin (played by Sam Elliott) who calls himself \"The Mormon.\" Enci plays a \"Mormon wife\" in this movie. Also starring Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Selma Blair, James Brolin, John Leguizamo, James Marsden, Jerry O'Connell. Screenplay by Noah Hawley.\n\nSlipstream (2005)\n\nDirected by David Van Eyssen. Written by Phillip Badger. \"Winston Briggs\" (actor Vinnie Jones) and \"Bonnie\" (actress Tamsin MacCarthy) are two bank robbers who cross paths with time machine inventor (Sean Astin, best known as \"Sam Gamgee\" from The Lord of the Rings trilogy) and FBI agent Sarah Tanner (Ivana Milicevic) in this direct-to-video/DVD science fiction feature. In two separate scenes, Winston and Bonnie discuss their admiration for the last scene in the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. They mention Butch Cassidy three times by name, although no mention is made of the fact that Butch was a lapsed Latter-day Saint. Interestingly enough, \"Sarah Tanner\" (the film's female lead character, second-billed after Astin), shares her name with real-life Sarah Tanner, the wife of President N. Eldon Tanner, an Apostle who served in the First Presidency of the Church from 1963 until 1982. This is almost certainly a coincidence.\n\nLast Days (2005)\n\n$454,711 U.S. box office. Written and directed by Gus Van Sant. Adam Friberg and his brother Andy Friberg have a small supporting role as oddly matching Latter-day Saint missionaries (named Elder Friberg #1 and Elder Friberg #2 in the cast list), who visit the protagonist, played by Michael Pitt. In this rock and roll story set in Seattle, Pitt plays a musician whose life and career is reminiscent of Kurt Cobain's. (Whether or not this means that the real Kurt Cobain met with Latter-day Saint missionaries, I don't know.) This movie was nominated for a Golden Palmes at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nHustle & Flow (2005)\n\n$22,125,461 U.S. box office. Written and directed by Craig Brewer. Terrence Howard stars as \"DJay\", hip black would-be rap star. DJ Qualls (who is white) co-stars as a somewhat nerdy musician whom DJay mistakenly thinks is a Latter-day Saint missionary when he first meets him.\n\nJiminy Glick in La La Wood (2005)\n\n$36,039 U.S. box office. Directed by Vadim Jean. Written by Martin Short, who stars in the title role as an obese and obnoxious film critic. Jiminy Glick has twin sons named \"Matthew Modine,\" named after prolific Mormon movie star Matthew Modine. These names humorously illustrate Glick's quirky obsession with movies and celebrities. \"Matthew Glick\" is played by Landon Hansen. \"Modine Glick\" is played by Jake Hoffman.\n\nInside Deep Throat (2005)\n\n$683,852 U.S. box office. The primary figure in this documentary is Harry Reems, now reformed from the days when he starred in the taboo-shattering \"adult\" film \"Deep Throat.\" Reems lives in Park City, Utah where he sells real estate and has become a Christian. Although about 90% of Christians in Utah are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Reems himself is not LDS. He identifies himself as a born-again Christian/Evangelical.\n\nThe Jacket (2005)\n\n$6,303,762 U.S. box office. Directed by John Maybury. Screenplay by Massy Tadjedin. Story by Tom Bleecker and Marc Rocco. Starring Adrien Brody and Keira Knightley. The premise of this movie is largely the same as Jack London's 1915 novel, which was published as The Jacket in England and The Star Rover in the United States. Chapters 12 and 13 of the book (comprising 15% of the book's total length) focus entirely on Latter-day Saints. Despite the prevalence of LDS characters and themes in the book that inspired it, this movie has no overt LDS references.\n\nMillions (2004)\n\n$6,583,149 U.S. box office. Directed by Danny Boyle. Screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce. British family film about two British young boys who find millions of pounds (lost by bank robbers) and decide to spend it altruistically before the impending switch to the Euro. The film is replete with overt religious themes and imagery, including appearances by Catholic Saints. The boys live next to three Latter-day Saint missionaries, to whom they give some of the money.\n\nThe Aviator (2004)\n\n$102,610,330 U.S. box office. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this epic biopic about billionaire industrialist Howard Hughes, a man who identified more closely with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints than with any other religious denomination, although he was never a member of the Church. Hughes married devout Latter-day Saint actress Terry Moore during the time period shown in this film. Later in life he surrounded himself with an all-Latter-day Saint cadre of bodyguards, as well as a number of LDS advisors. Hughes' famous \"Mormon will\" was the subject of the Jonathan Demme movie \"Melvin and Howard,\" but the will was eventually ruled unusable by a Nevada court. \"The Aviator,\" directed by Martin Scorsese, focuses on Hughes' role as an aviator and his pivotal role in developing the American aviation industry. The film omits references to the various important Latter-day Saint connections in his life, but countless reviewers and articles written at the time the film was released mentioned these connections.\n\nFinding Neverland (2004)\n\n$51,680,613 U.S. box office. Johnny Depp stars as J.M. Barrie, the turn-of-the-century English writer who was inspired by real-life Mormon actress Maude Adams to create the character of Peter Pan, and cast her in the lead role for the play's first U.S. production. The movie fictitiously invents alternative events leading to the creation of Peter Pan, and neglects to show Adams' pivotal role.\n\nFlight of the Phoenix (2004)\n\n$21,009,180 U.S. box office. Song playing during the film's opening credits is Johnny Cash's \"I've Been Everywhere,\" which mentions majority Latter-day Saint cities Rexburg and Cedar City. Details\n\nLast Shot (2004)\n\n$463,730 U.S. box office. Alec Baldwin plays an FBI agent who recruits a budding filmmaker (Matthew Broderick) to pretend to make a film as part of a sting operation to catch Mafia members. Alec Baldwin suggests an idea for a movie about two FBI agents - one good and one bad - with the twist being that both are Latter-day Saints.\n\nWithout a Paddle (2004)\n\n$58,156,431 U.S. box office. The whole plot of this film revolves around three twenty-something buddies searching for the unrecovered treasure of Latter-day Saint folk hero D.B. Cooper.\n\nNapoleon Dynamite (2004)\n\n$44,530,254 U.S. box office. Although the cast and crew were predominantly Latter-day Saints, including the director, writers, producers and title character/star, this is not a movie about overtly Latter-day Saint characters. Yet the setting is Preston, Idaho, an area where the majority of people are Latter-day Saints. One can presume that many of the characters in the movie are LDS, although nothing overtly identifies them as such. Minor LDS references include the LDS-style \"pseudo-swearing,\" various pictures seen on the walls of homes, and the \"Rick's College\" T-shirt worn by Napoleon in one scene. (\"Rick's College\" is the former name of BYU-Idaho, a university owned by the Church, at which over 98% of the students are Latter-day Saints.)\n\nCatwoman (2004)\n\n$40,198,710 U.S. box office. This setting of this big-budget comic book movie was Salt Lake City, Utah, according to countless reports in the entertainment press prior to the movie's release. Apparently pre-release information provided by the production studio specified Salt Lake City as the setting, although overt references to Salt Lake City have apparently been removed from the film. It is not entirely clear why Salt Lake City (the world headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) was specified as the setting for the story, as none of the characters are overtly Latter-day Saints and nothing in the film seems Utah- or LDS-related. The original \"Catwoman\" character from the \"Batman\" comic books was a resident of the fictional city of Gotham. One possible explanation is that the character of the movie's villain (\"Laurel Hedare\", played by Sharon Stone) was based on real-life anti-aging advocate/entrepreneur Heather Bird, a Latter-day Saint woman from Salt Lake City. Details\n\nAround the World in 80 Days (2004)\n\n$24,008,137 U.S. box office. Although the original Jules Verne has an entire chapter devoted to Latter-day Saint, this film starring Jackie Chan only shows Utah briefly. Details\n\nBush's Brain (2004)\n\n$11,927 U.S. box office. Documentary about Karl Rove, widely regarded President George W. Bush's closest and most important political advisor. Rove grew up primarily in Utah. Documentary mentions his time at Olympus High School. One photo shows him wearing a \"Y\" baseball cap apparently from BYU. Documentary states that Rove attends an Episcopalian church in Washington, D.C. The LDS Church is never mentioned by name, although it is widely believed that Rove has a Latter-day Saint family background or ancestry.\n\nA Boyfriend for Christmas (2004)\n\nTV movie. Directed by Kevin Connor. Written by Roger Schroeder. Broadcast several times during Christmas season on Hallmark Channel. No overtly Latter-day Saint characters, but the story is set in Salt Lake City. The skyline is shown a number of times, and the Salt Lake Temple can be seen. Story begins with a girl who asks Santa for a boyfriend for Christmas. On Christmas morning she receives a note promising delivery within 10 years. Ten years later, it's almost Christmas. The girl-turned-woman doesn't believe in Santa, as she still hasn't a boyfriend. But Santa comes through in the end to grant her wish.\n\nDancing with Gaia (2004)\n\nDirect-to-video feature-length film written by Matt Stratton and Dallas Trinkle, directed by Stratton. Comedic mockumentary about Zoe, a modern dance instructor and hippie who seeks to bring the spirit of the earth-goddess Gaia to people through a big swing dancing performance. Assembles an eclectic group of people to help her, including a number of Latter-day Saints.\n\nCheaper by the Dozen (2003)\n\n$138,614,544 U.S. box office. A joke about the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Also, Steve Martin paraphrases famous saying by Pres. David O. McKay. Details\n\nFat Pizza (2003)\n\nAUD 3,457,127 Australian box office gross. Pip Mushin and Phillip Scott have bit parts as injured Latter-day Saint missionaries in this politically incorrect Australian comedy from writer/director Paul Fenech. Movie pokes fun at every minority imaginable, including ethnic, racial and religious minorities, plus GLBTs, the handicapped, and more.\n\nPhantasm's End (2003)\n\nThe year is 2012. There are only three U.S. states left. Between New York and California is the wasteland known as the Plague Zone. Since many people are dead, the Tall Man is able to make thousands of dwarf slaves for his planet daily in the Mormon Mausoleum.\n\nPoolhall Junkies (2003)\n\n$562,059 U.S. box office. Filmed and set in Salt Lake City, Utah. A key scene in which the protagonist meets his benefactor (Christopher Walken) is framed with the Salt Lake Temple in the background. Details\n\nDon: Plain & Tall (2003)\n\nCharlie Jett plays a Latter-day Saint character in this low budget feature-length comedy about a computer whiz. Writer/director Scott Peters has written and/or directed for many science fiction TV series, including: The 4400; Animorphs; Ghost Stories; Goosebumps; The Outer Limits; Tracker; Highlander.\n\nCatch Me If You Can (2002)\n\n$164,606,800 U.S. box office. Steven Spielberg's adaptation of the biography of real-life impersonator Frank W. Abagnale Jr. (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). In his autobiography (on which the film is based) and in a documentary featurette that accompanies the DVD release of the film Abagnale claimed that he was a sociology professor at Brigham Young University (BYU), where over 90% of faculty members are Latter-day Saints. Details\n\nChicago (2002)\n\n$170,684,505 U.S. box office. During a musical number an inmate's song reveals why she is incarcerated: she murdered her Mormon boyfriend (played by Scott Wise). Details\n\nTwo Weeks Notice (2002)\n\n$93,354,918 U.S. box office. Sandra Bullock makes a joke about Utah and the 19th century Latter-day Saint practice of polygamy. Details\n\nRoughing It (2002)\n\nTV movie adaptation of Mark Twain's classic book. Also titled \"Mark Twain's Roughing It.\" Directed by Charles Martin Smith. Teleplay written by Steven H. Berman. James Garner stars as Samuel Clemens, a.k.a. \"Mark Twain.\" Twain's experiences with and observations about Latter-day Saints comprise 6 out of 79 total chapters in Roughing It (chapters 12 through 16, and 25), plus two of the three appendices.\n\nLittle Secrets (2002)\n\n$405,182 U.S. box office. The main character, Emily, has a crush on a \"middle-aged composer\" -- none other than Kurt Bestor, the celebrated Latter-day Saint composer and songwriter. Emily has a poster of Bestor on her wall, and there is one in the studio where she takes lessons. In one scene she watches a concert on television in which Bestor is conducting a symphony playing his composition \"Innovations.\"\n\nStray Dogs (2002)\n\nDirect-to-video/DVD release. Directed by Catherine Crouch. Adaptation of the same-titled play by Mormon playwright Julie Jensen. The play is set among Latter-day Saints in rural Southern Utah, where Jensen grew up. But the director set the film version among Protestants in the Deep South, where she grew up. Thus, the actual film does not have LDS/Utah references. Plot outline: A mother must choose between love and devotion to her sons and unborn child or staying with her sexy, maniacal husband and his patriarchal sister, who respectively fulfill her physical and emotional needs. Starring Guinevere Turner, Bill Sage, Dot Jones and Zach Gray.\n\nVanilla Sky (2001)\n\n$100,614,858 U.S. box office. Directed by Cameron Crowe. Adapted from the Spanish film by Alejandro Amenabar and Mateo Gil. Starring Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell. In the famous opening scene, in which Tom Cruise finds himself completely alone in a deserted Times Square (New York City), a few shots prominently show the sign of a Marriott Hotel behind Tom Cruise. (The hotel is part of the worldwide hotel chain founded and owned by devout Latter-day Saints). The Marriott Hotel sign can first be seen at 3 minutes, 16 seconds after the start of the film. Three different Marriott Hotel signs can be seen in succession behind Tom Cruise, during a 17-second segment (ending 3 minutes, 33 seconds after the start of the film) of Times Square scene. In a scene in which Tom Cruise is being wheeled to surgery on a hospital gurney, he sings part of the song \"One of Us,\" including the song's most famous line, \"What if God was one of us?\" The song can soon thereafter be heard as part of the soundtrack. This song was written by Eric Bazilian and the recording heard on the soundtrack was performed by Joan Osborn, neither of whom are Latter-day Saints as far as we know.\n\nTraining Day (2001)\n\n$76,261,036 U.S. box office.

Part of the movie takes place in Utah, where police attempt to apprehend Jay and Silent Bob, who are fugitives with a stolen orangutan.

Starring Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Anne Heche. The film's star, Dustin Hoffman, and particularly the director discuss the way that this film is a satirical criticism of television, and they discuss the tremendous influence that television (which was created by Latter-day Saint inventor Philo Farnsworth) has had on the modern world. The following is a transcript from the audio commentary from the DVD release, beginning at time code 28 minutes, 4 seconds after the start of the film until time code 31 minutes, 24 seconds:\n\nDustin Hoffman: When I read the, uh, David Mamet script I don't recall thinking this is a roman a clef on... on Clinton. It was-- It was never about Clinton. Uh, it was never the intention. It was always-- Barry-- Barry has a, uh, has a hard-on... All-- all artists, I guess, have certain agendas they wanna fulfill. And Barry's always had a desire to attack, uh, television. He's done it in earlier films of his. He's done it in Avalon. Uh, he comes from the same generation that I do. We are the first television, and we are now witnessing maybe the fourth television generation.\n\nBarry Levinson: In the second half of the Twentieth Century... um, selling has become everything. It-- We are inundated with, you know, commercials all the time. With all these things that we need. We are sold all day long, every day. Never in the history of mankind has there been such a-- such a barrage of, you know... you know, the selling of products. Ever. So if the average person watches, you know, five or six hours of television today, that means they're watching at least an hour and a half of commercials. That's an hour and a half of \"This is what you need. You need this. You need this. You need this. You need this. You oughta get this. You should get that. You should get this.\" An hour and a half a day. So, I mean, God knows what that does to us. Or whatever kinds of anxieties it creates, because all day long it's, \"Gee, I don't have that. I should get that. I don't have that.\" And now you need a little help. I need Fred Astaire to help me buy, you know, some kind of vacuum cleaner. I don't just need a vaccum cleaner, I need, you know, Fred Astaire to help me with a vacuum cleaner, and John Wayne's gonna pick out some kind of beer-- You know what I mean? And so it's there all the time. It's an extraordinary phenomenon and it's less than forty to fifty years old. So, when someone says about, you know, \"Well, don't you think you're being overly, you know, critical of-- of television.\" Because I've done several movies that deal with the issue of television and the influence on society. It's impossible to. It is-- It is-- It has played probably the biggest role in the second half of the Twentieth Century. I don't think there's anything that has come along that has affected our lives as much as television. And what does it do? How does it-- What are-- What are we now that we weren't before? How-- How's it altered our understanding, how we relate to one another, uhm, in so many ways...
