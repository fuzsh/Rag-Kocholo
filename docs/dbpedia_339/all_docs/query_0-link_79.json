        "text": "Welcome to the British Society for the Turin Shroud Archive page of this website. We are very proud to help bring this fine organization and their important Shroud work to the Internet. This page functions as a \"gateway\" and provides a Table of Contents and direct links to an archive of their Newsletters and other BSTS materials. To learn more about the Society itself, just click on the Union Jack in the upper right corner of the page. Please note that all new issues will only be available by subscription so click on the New BSTS Newsletter Website link at the top of this page and subscribe.\n\nWe wish to thank Chris Jones (BSTS Member) in England, for designing the original BSTS html pages for issues #43 through #48, Ian Wilson (former Editor of the BSTS Newsletter), in Australia, for editing all the issues up to #54, and Judith Wilson for converting issues #49 through #53 of the newsletter into the Acrobat PDF files we now use. In 2002, Mark Guscin (www.markguscin.com) became the new editor and he is located in Spain. In 2011, Stephen Jones, another BSTS member who lives in Australia, began the very major task of scanning and optical character recognition of all the earlier issues (working his way backwards from issues #42 through #1), which we completed in November 2012. Also in 2012, Yannick Clement, Canadian Shroud researcher, volunteered his services and converted the html files for Issues #43 through #48, which allowed us to add pdf versions of those issues to this page along with the original html versions. Finally, in January 2013 we added five monographs that were presented at BSTS meetings in the 1980's and 1990's. It is truly a great pleasure to work with our good friends at the BSTS in making this complete archive of their important newsletter and other valuable materials available online."
