        "text": "Introduction\n\nA March 1917 article in âMoving Picture Weeklyâ (the trade magazine published by Universal Film Manufacturing Company) introduced a young âAssistant Directorâ who was âcoming rapidly on the filmy horizons and making swift progress on the road to fame and fortune.â He was so new that little information had been printed about Jack Ford. (The young Ford used the nickname âJackâ rather than the more formal âJohnâ.) He told the writer that he was born in Portland Maine in 1895 and educated at the University of Maine. His height was 6â2â and his hair and eyes were brown. His screen career had been as an assistant to his brother, Francis Ford, since July 1914. He had been directing his own company for a short time and was currently directing a three-reel picture starring Harry Carey. The older brother âis warned to look to his laurels or the kid will catch up.â This warning was quite prescient, as the kid very quickly âcaught upâ and went by in a hurry. By 1918, as Jackâs directing career was advancing, Francis was starting on a decline toward his status in the talkies as a minor, often uncredited, character actor.\n\nJohn Ford was baptized John Martin Feeney (he also gave the alternates Sean Aloysius OâFeeney or OâFearna). He used âJack Fordâ until 1922. After settling in Hollywood, his older brother Francis put him to work as a property man, stunt rider, assistant cameraman, and grip. The aspiring filmmaker studied the techniques of the cameramen and editors, learning how to cut and edit in the camera. From 1914-1916, Jack played parts in 15 films directed by Francis and collaborated on the script (usually with Grace Cunard) for many of them.\n\nAdvanced by the studio to âassistant directorâ, Jack Ford had a busy first year. He began his career by writing, starring in, and directing a 2 reel film, The Tornado (1917). He wrote, starred in, and directed two more (1917) short films, Trail of Hate and The Scrapper. His first films with Harry Carey, The Soul Herder and Cheyenneâs Pal (both 1917), were also shorts. These short films were well received by audiences and film critics.\n\nIn 1917, Universal was advancing production from mostly short to mostly feature films (at least 5 reels). The Ford/Carey partnership proceeded to make features, putting out four in 1917, the first of which was Straight Shooting. With Carey as the star, Jack Ford directed 22 western features.\n\nTheir partnership for Universal Studios continued, mostly uninterrupted, for three years, from late 1917 through 1919. In 1920, Carey continued to make westerns for Universal Studios, but none of them were directed by Ford; Ford made his first non-westerns for Universal and signed with Fox Film Corp. In Spring 1921, Ford made three final films with Carey. By 1922, Ford was with Fox. At Fox Films, Ford made westerns, including The Iron Horse (1924), one of the best known of silent westerns. He also directed many silent comedies and dramas with contemporary settings. Carey continued with Universal through 1922, but in 1923 he was with the independent Robertson/Cole Company. Carey made westerns throughout the 1920âs, modestly budgeted films made for independent producers.\n\nSpeaking with Peter Bogdanovich in the 1960âs, Ford claimed that the only thing he always had was an eye for composition. He called Harry Carey a great actor and credited Carey with tutoring him in the early years, sort of bringing him along. He described the films with Carey as character stories rather than shoot-em-ups. Star and director made Careyâs character into a sort of a bum, a saddle tramp, instead of a great gun-fighting hero.\n\nFrancis Ford\n\nFrancis Ford (1881-1953) started in films several years before his brother came to Hollywood. In 1909 Francis began his film career as an actor for the MÃ©liÃ¨s Manufacturing Company, the American film studio of Georges and Gaston MÃ©liÃ¨s located in Fort Lee New Jersey. In 1912 he was with The Thomas H. Ince Company directing and appearing in Kay-Bee and Bison pictures. In 1914, Francis joined the Universal Film Manufacturing Co. From 1909 Francis specialized in western shorts, after 1912 collaborating with actor and writer Grace Cunard. In 1914 Francis directed Grace Cunard in Lucille Love: Girl of Mystery, a serial modeled on The Perils of Pauline. From 1916 to 1919, Frances made several serials. With Grace Cunard, he wrote many of his own films. Jack Ford arrived in 1914 and appeared in several of his brotherâs movies. Francis continued acting and directing through the twenties, directing his final film in 1929. He was a minor character actor for the remainder of his career. John Ford told Peter Bogdanovich that âFrank was a great cameraman, a really good artist, wonderful musician, a hell of a good actor, and a good director, a johnny of all trades. He just couldnât concentrate on one thing too long.â\n\nHarry Carey\n\nCarey joined the Biograph Company in 1909. Appropriately, his first film, Bill Sharkeyâs Last Game> (1909, directed by D. W. Griffith), was a western. During five years with Biograph, Carey appeared in dozens of short films, many of them directed by Griffith. He was not a major actor in the Biograph stock company, typically playing smaller roles than the more prominent actors, such as Henry B. Walthall or Robert Harron. Careyâs notable films at Biograph include: An Unseen Enemy (1912) the debut of Lillian and Dorothy Gish, The Musketeers of Pig Alley (1912), Griffithâs pioneering examination of inner city gangsters, and Olaf - An Atom (1913) a lead role for Carey.\n\nHarry Carey, 1919\n\nCarey moved to Hollywood with Biograph in 1911. His career as a western star began after he joined the Universal Film Manufacturing Company in 1915. Most of his initial films at Universal were shorts. He first played a character named Cheyenne Harry in a 1916 feature, A Knight of the Range. A pretty twenty year old, Olive Fuller Gordon, Careyâs future wife, and Hoot Gibson were his co-stars. Also in 1916, Carey starred in the first film version of Three Godfathers, directed by Edward LeSaint and based on a 1913 novel by Peter B. Kyne. The novel was adapted subsequently to several films. Carey and John Ford produced a 1919 version, Marked Men. Under the original title are a 1930 version with Charles Bickford, a 1936 version with Chester Morris, and a 1948 John Ford version with John Wayne and Harry Carey Jr. Ford dedicated the film to Carey Srâs memory.\n\nCareyâs first film with Jack Ford was a three reel short, Soul Herder (1917), Fordâs fourth directorial credit. Hoot Gibson was also in the cast. Straight Shooting, the first feature made by Ford and Carey, was followed by 21 more westerns made by the pair. In many of these films, Carey used the name âCheyenne Harryâ for his character. Although the name was the same, the character in each film was distinct. Careyâs final silent with Ford was Desperate Trails (1921). Unfortunately, most of the Ford/Carey silents are lost films. The intact survivors, including Bucking Broadway (1917) and Hell Bent (1918) feature Carey using the âCheyenne Harryâ name.\n\nWith his plain features and unadorned costumes, Carey appears the conventional movie cowboy. He is distinguished by his forceful persona, intense gaze, and individualized mannerisms.\n\nCarey left Universal in 1922, shortly after Ford moved to Fox Films. Through the 1920âs Carey continued to star in westerns, mostly low budget films made by newly formed production companies, including Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation and Hunt Stromberg Productions.\n\nRead more about Harry Carey.\n\nShort Films Directed by John \"Jack\" Ford\n\nThe Tornado\n\nReleased: March 3, 1917 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Jack Ford, Peter Gerald, Duke Worne, Elsie Thornton\n\nWriters: Grace Cunard, Francis Ford, Jack Ford\n\nStory: Lesparre and his gang rob the bank and kidnap Bess, the mayorâs daughter. Jack rides to her rescue. He fights the gang in their cabin and jumps from the cabin roof to his horse. As a climax he leaps from his horse onto a moving train. Bess is rescued, and the bankâs money returned. With the reward money offered by the mayor, Jack brings his mother over from Ireland.\n\nComments: Ford told Peter Bogdanovich that he remembered the film as âjust a bunch of stuntsâ.\n\nTrail of Hate\n\nReleased: April 28, 1917 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Jack Ford, Louise Granville, Duke Worne\n\nWriter: Jack Ford\n\nStory: Lt Jack Brown of the 67th Cavalry Regiment, risen from the ranks, is adored by his men but less popular with some of the other officers, especially Captain Dana Holden, a West Pointer. When a stage is held up, the 67th goes after the road agents. During the skirmish, the father of a young woman, Madge, is killed. Left without money or a home, Madge becomes a servant at the fort. Jack tries to help her by buying her new clothes, but a scandal results. To save her reputation, Jack marries her. After her marriage, Madge, who does not love Jack, begins to think that he married her from pity. She starts a flirtation with Holden, meeting him when Jack is away. Jack finds her with Holden, and they get into a fight. She leaves with Holden and marries him. A few years later, Jack and his troops are stationed in the Philippines. Trouble breaks out with a local group, the Moros, and Jackâs troops are sent to a post in the interior. Jack and Holden are stationed near each other. Holden leaves Madge at the post while he is scouting. Attacked by the Moros and cut off, Holden abandons his duties, and his wife, and attempts to escape to Manilla. The Moros attack and wound him. Holdenâs troopers take him back to the post. Jack and his troops save the post, including Holden and Madge, from the Moros. Jack takes her to his post. Madge is sorry that she left Jack and wants him to stay with her, but he turns away in disgust and throws her off forever.\n\nJohn Ford, 1917\n\nThe Scrapper\n\nReleased: June 9, 1917 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Jack Ford, Louise Granville, Duke Worne, Jean Hathaway\n\nWriter: Jack Ford\n\nStory: Buck Logan loves Helen Dawson, a school teacher, but she is lonely in the country and returns to the city. Buck and his fellow cowboys ride over to say goodbye. Buck proposes again, but Helen is not ready to marry him. In the city, Helen finds it difficult to find employment. Martha Mayes and her assistant, Jerry Marten, run an establishment where men can meet pretty young women. They plan to lure Helen into their dancing hall where she will attract wealthy clients. To carry out the plan, their employee, Archie, pretends to attack Helen, and Jerry protects her. Jerry walks her home. He tell Helen that his sister is giving a party and invites her. The âsisterâ is Martha who introduces Helen to Colonel Stanton, a wealthy client. Buck has also come to the affair with a girl he befriended. He recognizes a reluctant Helen paired up with the colonel. Outraged, Buck, who is always ready for a fight, demands a fight with everyone in the place His challenge is accepted by all the men and a fight commences. Buck is outnumbered, but Helen telephones for the boys, who arrive to help Buck. A gigantic fight ensues. Jerry and Archie carry Helen off, but Buck intervenes. They end up on the roof where Buck throws Archie off and downs Jerry. The hall is wrecked, but Helen is saved. After a few days of recovery, the boys escort Buck and Helen to the train. They are leaving the city and heading west.\n\nComments: Ford included plenty of action in his three starring shorts. The studio publicity proclaimed that the big fight in The Scrapper was a âscene of carnage never equaled, a fine free-for-all.â Ford reproduced the big fight scene in Bucking Broadway, a Carey feature. Carey and his cowboy friends engage with Vestor Pegg, who is planning to marry a reluctant Molly Malone, and Peggâs pals. The fight wrecks the terraced dining area of a swanky New York Hotel where the pre-wedding breakfast is being held.\n\nSoul Herder\n\nReleased: August 4, 1917 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Jean Hersholt, Fritzi Ridgeway, Hoot Gibson, Vester Pegg, Duke R. Lee\n\nWriter: George Hively\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry spends a wild Saturday night in a small town and ends up in jail. The next morning the sheriff releases Harry but keeps his gun. Harry is ordered out of town. Riding in the desert, Harry meets a man and child in a wagon. The man is the new parson of Buckhorn. Indians ride up. The parsonâs attempts to parlay with them are unsuccessful, and they shoot him. Harry, who does not have his gun, survives. He buries the parson and takes the child to the town. In town he meets the childâs aunt, Jane, who takes him for her brother-in-law. The child has become attached to him, so he stays. Days later he meets Topeka Jack and his henchman. They take him for the unwanted parson and get him into a fight. He beats up the henchmen. Jane arrives on the scene, denounces Harry as a ruffian and imposter and orders him to leave. However, the child becomes ill and calls for her new daddy. Harry comforts the child who recovers. Jane says he can stay. Chuck Rafferty, an old friend, comes to town and offers to help Harry hold a church service. For three weeks they open the church to small attendance. In the fourth week, Harry goes to the saloon and with drawn guns forces everyone to church. Harry gives a long sermon, and Chuck collects offerings at gunpoint. Topeka Jack and his henchman attempt to run Harry out of town, but he overcomes them and closes the saloon. Buckhorn is now peaceful. Harry and Jane plan a wedding.\n\nComments: This film introduces a characteristic starting point for a Ford/Carey film: Carey as a hard-drinking, rough mannered, and foot-loose rangerider who is unwelcome in a quiet town. By the conclusion this rude character has been civilized by the virtuous and strong-willed heroine.\n\nCheyenne's Pal\n\nReleased: August 16, 1917 - believed lost\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Gertrude Astor, Jim Corey, Vester Pegg, Hoot Gibson\n\nWriters: Jack Ford, Charles J. Wilson\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry is very fond of his horse, Cactus Pete. He refuses all offers for the valuable animal. Unfortunately, Harry is also fond of liquor and dance hall girls. After getting drunk and spending all his money, Harry sells his horse to a buyer from the Bristish Army who plans to ship the horse to the war zone in Europe. The next night, Harry awakens sad and lonely and afraid for the horse. Under cover of darkness, he enters the barn where the horse is stabled. He saddles and rides away into the safety of the desert.\n\nComments: The reviewer for âExhibitors Heraldâ describes this short as a âcolorful and swiftly moving little drama of the cow countryâ.\n\nFeature Films: Jack Ford, Director & Harry Carey, Actor\n\nFord described the idea for the films as character studies of western life, featuring basic emotions mixed with rugged terrain and primitive settings. Careyâs character is often named Cheyenne Harry, a simple name for a basic westerner, generally the hard riding, straight shooting type whose wardrobe was plain and unadorned as fits his salt-of-the-earth character. Although Carey often used the same name, the attributes of his character differed from film to film. Ford and Carey emphasized eye-catching photography of the western scenery. The mostly undeveloped (at the time) mountains and valleys around Los Angeles provided many strikingly scenic locations.\n\nMost of these films are five reels (about an hour), the standard length for a feature at the time. Some of the later films are six reels, and Universal advertised these longer features as specials, although in general the plots and settings do not differ significantly from the five reel features.\n\nOf the 22 feature films made by Ford and Carey, only three are known to be mostly extant and available for viewing.\n\nSince most Ford/Carey films are lost, our plot synopses are based on synopses published in contemporary trade magazines. The plot synopsis for any one film often varies between magazines, sometimes significantly. Since it seemed likely that Universal would have the greatest amount of information about their own films, most of our synopses are based on the story synopses published in Moving Picture Weekly, the magazine published by Universal Pictures to inform exhibitors about its weekly product.\n\nStraight Shooting\n\nReleased: August 27, 1917. (The film is largely extant and available for viewing.)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Molly Malone, George Berrell, Vester Pegg, Hoot Gibson, Duke R. Lee, William Gettinger\n\nWriters: John Ford, George Hively\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, wanted outlaw\n\nStory: Sweet Water Sims, Ted, his son, and Joan, his daughter, have settled on a section of open land claimed by powerful rancher, Thunder Flint. Flint fences off Simâs water hole. Thunder plans to attack all the settlers on his grazing lands. He hires gunman Cheyenne Harry to drive the Sims family off the land. Another gunman, Placer Fremont, waiting at the water hole, kills Ted when Ted comes for water. When Harry arrives he finds Sweet Water and Joan mourning over the body of Ted. Harry is so touched by their grief that he changes sides and decides to protect them. In the streets of the local town, Harry and Placer duel with rifles. Harry kills Placer and rides to the Simsâ house. He sends Joan to warn all the settlers and bring them to the house. Harry rides for his friends in outlaw valley. The settlers in the house are hard pressed by Thunderâs gunmen until Harry and his outlaw friends arrive to drive the gunmen away. With peace restored, Harry is conflicted about whether an outlaw can marry a good woman. Joan convinces him that he must stay.\n\nComments: This first Ford/Carey feature has one of the commonest plot lines in western films: the evil cattle baron attempts to throw the settlers off their land, and the outlaw hero switches sides to help the settlers. This western plot also includes the age old romantic trope of the good girl reforming the outlaw hero.\n\nAlthough Ford claimed that he and Carey wrote most of their films, a professional writer assisted with completion of the scenarios and screenplays. George Hively, a professional writer, worked on many Ford/Carey films, starting with Soul Herder, a short. In the ten years he was a screenwriter, Hively accumulated 92 credits, including a total of 10 Ford/Carey stories. In 1927 as the talkies replaced silents, Hively switched from screenwriting to film editing.\n\nHe continued as an editor until 1945, working principally at MGM. His highly successful editing career included such prestigious films as Bringing Up Baby (1938), Love Affair (1939), and Abe Lincoln in Illinois (1940). Hively was nominated for a Best Editing Academy Award for The Informer (1935), a film for which John Ford won Best Director.\n\nThe artistry associated with Fordâs westerns, strong characterizations and sweeping panoramas of the western settings, is evident in his first feature film.\n\nThe title of the picture was initially announced as âJoan of the Cattle Countryâ. This title indicates the importance of the heroineâs ability to transform the hero and also her Paul Revere-like ride to gather the settlers. A title highlighting the heroine of a western would have been highly unusual, but Joan is a very active character.\n\nRead more about Straight Shooting.\n\nSecret Man\n\nReleased: October 1, 1917 (Two reels survive)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Edythe Sterling, J. Morris Foster. Vester Pegg, Hoot Gibsen. William Getting\n\nWriters: John Ford, George Hively\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, escaped convict\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry escapes jail and boards a train. On the train, Harry sucessfully hides from the law with the help of passenger Henry Beaufort. Harry goes to work on Beaufortâs ranch. Beaufort is secretly married to Molly who lives with her brother, Bill, on the neighboring ranch. The marriage is secret because Beaufortâs wealthy uncle opposes it and would disinherit his nephew if he knew. Molly and Henryâs daughter, Elizabeth, is in the charge of the foreman of Bill and Mollyâs ranch. When the sheriff arrives looking for him, Harry runs off. During his escape he finds Elizabeth who has been injured in the crash of a runaway wagon. Harry takes the girl back to the ranch, thus giving himself up. Molly reveals that the child is hers, and the secret marriage is confessed. For his selfless act, Harry is pardoned. When the uncle dies the coupleâs troubles are cleared up.\n\nComments: Contemporary reviewer Peter Milne, of âMotion Picture Newsâ, wrote that the story was too slim for the running time and the characters were âgenerally unskillfully drawnâ. He complemented the striking views of cattle grazing on rolling plains, a western panorama that was included in many of the Ford/Carey films.\n\nMarked Man\n\nReleased: October 19, 1917 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Molly Malone, Anna Townsend, Vester Pegg, William Gettinger\n\nWriter: John Ford, story; George HIvely, scenario\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry, a wanted man who has tried to reform, is induced by a pal to participate in a stage robbery. During the robbery, Harryâs confederate kills a passenger. Harry is caught, convicted of the murder, and sentenced to be hanged. As the hanging nears, a letter from Harryâs mother announces that she is coming to visit him. The sheriff gives Harry two weeks of grace while his mother visits. As part of the charade, a friendly local rancher lends his ranch house. The rancherâs daughter, Molly, pretends that she is Harryâs wife. After the two weeks, Harryâs innocence of the murder is proven when an exonerating witness appears. Vowing to go straight, Harry asks Molly to marry him.\n\nComments: Robert McElravy, the reviewer of the âMotion Picture Worldâ found the plot improbable, but wrote that the film was made entertaining by consistent action and superior photography. He particularly noted the wild, rugged scenic effects and furious horseback riding. He also noted that the hanging scene was very realistic with the noose around Harryâs neck and âwith closeups that might well be cut as many sensitive observers do not like so much realismâ.\n\nHarry Carey in Bucking Broadway (1917)\n\nBucking Broadway\n\nReleased: December 24,1917. The film is largely extant and available for viewing.\n\nCast: Molly Malone, Vester Pegg, William Gettinger\n\nWriter: George Hively\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, cowboy\n\nStory: Harry, foreman of Ben Claytonâs ranch, loves Helen, Benâs daughter. Harry and Helen plan their marriage. Harry carves a heart and gives it to Helen as a love token. Eugene Thornton, an Eastener, visits the ranch and secretly courts Helen. She elopes with him. Harry is heartbroken but resigned. In New York, Helen discovers that Thornton is not the man he pretended to be. Thornton and his friends are dissipated and immoral. Frightened of them, Helen breaks the heart and sends a half to Harry as a sign that she needs him. Harry goes to New York and finds that the reluctant Helen is being forced to marry Thornton. Harry needs help to release her and sends for his cowboy pals who are appearing in a rodeo at Madison Square Garden. The cowboys gallop down Broadway to the hotel where the wedding ceremony is about to begin. The two groups battle throughout the restaurant area of the hotel. Harry knocks out Thornton and embraces Helen. They take the westbound train back to the ranch.\n\nComments: The film is a feature length version of The Scrapper (released June 1917), the third short of which Ford was director and star. In both films, the heroâs rescue of the innocent heroine involves a mammoth fight. The multi-tiered hotel interior in Bucking Broadway is a classy site for the big fight, groups of fighters are battling all over the dining room.\n\nThe cowboys riding to the rescue of Harry and Helen supposedly are galloping down Broadway in New York. A wide street in Los Angeles is standing in for the New York location. Despite the dangers of obstructions on the street, the eight or ten men and horses completed filming without any accidents.\n\nRead more about Bucking Broadway\n\nPhantom Riders\n\nReleased: January 28, 1918 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Molly Malone, Bill Gettinger, Vester Pegg, Buck Connor\n\nWriter: George Hively; Henry MacRae, story\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, cattleman\n\nStory: Dave Bland runs his cattle on a large tract of open government land. His control is enforced by a gang of whiteclothed, masked riders. Bland wants to possess Molly, the daughter of his subservient foreman, Pebble Grant. Cheyenne Harry drives his little herd of catltle onto the grass claimed by Bland and refuses to leave. In town, Harry disarms and slaps Bland for insulting Molly. Mollyâs father is going to meet Harry to tell him about Bland, but the masked riders intercept the foreman and hang him in vengence for changing sides. The Unknown, the masked leader of the riders, intends to kill Harry. In a bar fight, Harry routes half the drunken riders. Later, Harry is trapped at his ranch house, besieged by Bland and his masked riders. Molly rides for help and brings the rangers to save Harry.\n\nComments: Another version of the battle between a small cattleman and the âbigâ rancher over use of grasslands legally open to everybody. The âVarietyâ reviewer, Fred, highlighted the convincing battle scene and noted (facetiously) the large amount of gun powder expended.\n\nBuck Connor (aka Buck Connors), who plays Pebble Grant, had a 30 year career as a western bit player. Connors was also a writer of western short stories and screen stories. He had homes in Hollywood and Quartzsite, Arizona. In Quartzsite, Connors, well known as a venerable western character, was the namesake of the yearly âBuck Connors Western Daysâ The advertising for this event features photos of a white haired and bearded Connors from his later days in westerns.\n\nWild Women\n\nReleased: February 25, 1918 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Molly Malone, Vester Pegg\n\nWriter: Harry Carey and John Ford, story; Geroge Hively, scenario\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, cowboy\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry and the other ranchhands go to the rodeo where Harry cleans up in prizes. In the evening, the men go to a bar where they enjoy potent cocktails and Hawaiian dancers. That night the combination of cocktails and island dancing brings on exotic dreams. In their dreams, they are shanghaied and sail to a South Seas Island. The island is ruled by a Queen whose subjects are pretty native women. Harry puts down a revolution and wins the Princess. Just when Harry is about to marry the Princess, he wakes up with a hangover.\n\nComments: Ford and Carey frequently included comical incidents in their films, but Wild Women was their only film that was pure farce. The advertising promised exhibitors that the film would entertain hardened movie fans, who would forget the war while watching its 5 reels of comedy drunks and dreams of Hawaii. The âVarietyâ reviewer thought the plot was too slender to be maintained for 5 reels.\n\nThieves' Gold\n\nReleased: March 18, 1918 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Molly Malone, Vester Pegg\n\nWriter: Frederick R. Bechdolt, story: âBack to the Right Trailâ; George Hively, scenario and screenplay\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, cowboy, robber\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry becomes restive with his work on the Savage ranch. He meets Curt Simmons in a bar. Simmons, an outlaw, robs shipments along the Mexican Border. Harry decides to join Simmons in the robbery of an auto that is bearing gold for Mexican revolutionaries. Harry thinks they are in Mexico, but actually they carry out the robbery in Arizona. A posse is quickly formed to pursue Simmons and Harry. As he is escaping, Harry sees a young woman, Alice Norris, in a runaway carriage. Harry stops the carriage and rescues Alice but is caught by the sheriff and jailed. Savage obtains his release and takes him back to the ranch. Alice is staying at the ranch, and they fall in love. However, when Alice learns about his participation in the robbery, she leaves him. Harry rides off into the desert where he meets and confronts Smmons about returning the money. Harry and Simmons shoot it out, and Simmons is killed Harry has been wounded and is lying unconscious when Alice drives by and finds him. As he recuperates, they are reconciled.\n\nComments: At this time, Ford and Carey were producing a five reel film every month. They had a new story for every film; inevitably, some stories were weak. With a trivial plot line, they had to depend on lots of action and Careyâs pleasing screen personality to carry the film and satisfy its audience.\n\nâWhen the West Was Youngâ (1922) and âTales of the Old-Timersâ (1924), two volumes of factual stories recounting dramatic incidents in the lives of famous Westerners, are the best known publications of Frederick Ritchie Bechdolt (1874-1950), prolific novelist and story writer. Bechdolt published this filmâs source story, âBack to the Right Trailâ, in âPopular Magazineâ (1915).\n\nThe Scarlet Drop\n\nReleased: April 22, 1918 (30 minutes of footage survives)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Molly Malone, Vester Pegg\n\nWriter: John Ford, story, George Hively, scenario\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: âKaintuckâ Harry Ridge, outlaw rides with Quartile\n\nStory: After the attack on Fort Sumter, âKaintuckâ Harry Ridge, a poverty stricken, illiterate Kentucky mountain man, volunteers for the local militia but is refused admittance, as it is a âgentlmanâs organizationâ. Marley Calvert, scorning âKaintuckâ, calls him âWhite Trashâ. Only Molly, Calvertâs sister, has a kind word for him. Angered and vowing vengence, âKaintuckâ joins Quantrellâs raiders, a gang of maurauders. By the end of the war, âKaintuckâ is a fugitive with a price on his head. He moves westward where, a wanted man, he continues his banditry. Also moving west, Calvert and his associate, Graham Lyons, invest in a mine. Molly travels west to join her brother. âKaintuckâ, still vengeful, holds up the stage and kidnaps Molly. Having considered but decided not to harm her, âKaintuckâ treats her decently, and they become very friendly while Molly is with him. He takes Molly to the mining camp. At the camp, Graham Lyons is waiting for the arrival of Molly. As Marleyâs partner, Lyons demands that Marley give him Molly. Marley refuses and is knocked out by Lyons who attacks Molly. âKaintuckâ fights him. Lyons is overcome, but âKaintuckâ is shot. When officers come searching for the outlaw, Marley and Molly hide him in the attic. As the officers search, a drop of blood from the attic reveals his presence. They attempt to arrest him, but âKaintuckâ escapes. Mollyâs friendship has affected âKaintuckâ, and he determines to give up banditry and improve himself. Eventually, a changed man, âKaintuckâ returns to Molly.\n\nComments: After the rather conventional Thievesâ Gold, Ford and Carey wrote an atypical and more complex plot for Scarlet Drop. Initially, Carey is a mountain man rather than his usual westerner, although he seems to assume the westerner character part way through the film. That he can even consider dishonoring the heroine to gain vengence on her brother indicates the crudity and roughness of the mountain man persona. Although Carey spends much of the film seeking vengance, he and Marley are reconciled when Carey defends Molly. In a typical ending, the good woman transforms the hero from an outlaw into a steady and honest husband.\n\nHell Bent\n\nReleased: July 6, 1918 The film is largely extant and available for viewing.\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Neva Gerber, Duke R. Lee, Vester Pegg, Joe Harris\n\nWriters: John Ford, Harry Carey, Eugene B. Lewis, story\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, hard drinking, gambling cowboy\n\nStory: During a card game, several men are shot. The sheriff chases the gunman to the county line where he escapes. The gunman, a very drunk Cheyenne Harry, rides onto the town of Rawhide. The only hotel in Rawhide, part of the saloon, is full, but Harry forces Cimmaron Bill to share his bed. The drunken Cheyenne and Bill discover that they have something in common, a fondness for singing. Cheyenne and Bill unite in the singing of âSweet Genevieveâ and, by morning, they are fast friends. Cheyenne meets and visits Bess Thurston, whose brother, Jack, has been fired from his job at Wells Fargo. Bess goes to work in the dance hall where Cheyenne is the bouncer. He is disturbed by her presence in the dance hall, but protects her as much as possible. Beau Ross, leader of a hold-up gang, persuades Jack to participate in a bank robbery. Cheyenne gets to the bank first, but learning that Jack is one of he bandits. he lets Jack and Ross get away, although without the money. Ross, realizing that Cheyenne will be in his way, kidnaps Bess to force Cheyenne to come to the hideout. Cheyenne tells Bill to come after him if he is not back in six hours. Cheyenne finds the gang but is captured and tied to an untamed horse that is run off. The horse plunges off a hill slope, and Cheyenne escapes. Ross takes Bess with him into the desert. Meantime, the sheriff and his possee find the gang as the outlaws are attempting to escape in a wagon. The outlaws are killed when their racing wagon tumbles off the road and down a mountain side. Bill continues in search of Cheyenne. In the desert, Cheyenne catches up with Ross and Bess. The men shoot it out and both are wounded. Only one horse is fit to ride, and Bess takes it. She will ride back to town; Cheyenne and Ross will walk. A windstorm overtakes Cheyenne and Ross. Cheyenne covers himself, but Ross lies in the open. When Bill finds them, Cheyenne is alive, but Ross is dead. Some time later, Cheyenne dressed neatly in a suit proposes to Bess. She accepts him. In the distance, Bill is happily singing âSweet Genevieveâ.\n\nComments: This film begins with the character of Cheyenne Harry as an unrefined, hard drinking rangerider. This character is domesticated by the love of a good woman. By the conclusion Cheyenne, in order to marry Bess, has cleaned himself up, improved his wardrobe, and quit drinking. Careyâs character in several films follows a similar story arc, most notably the crude and illiterate âKaintuckâ in The Scarlet Drop that had been released several months previously.\n\nHell Bent was the first Ford/Carey films written by Eugene B. Lewis. Lewis began his career in the early silent period as a writer and editor for American Biograph and Universal Studios. He worked on seven Ford/Carey features. His final writing credit is for the Fox Studio production Cupidâs Fireman (1923) directed by William Wellman. Lewis died at the early age of 46 in 1924.\n\nRead more about Hell Bent.\n\nA Woman's Fool\n\nReleased: August 12, 1918 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Betty Schrader, Molly Malone, Vester Pegg\n\nWriters: George Hively, scenario; Owen Wister, novel: âLin McLeanâ (1898)\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Lin McLean, rancher\n\nStory: Lin McLean, the best hearted man in the west, was a perfect fool where women were concerned. In Denver, Lin meets Katie Lusk, a waitress, and falls for her. Not knowing that Katie has a husband and a child, Lin offers her a home and marries her. A year later, during a drought, Tom Lusk, Katieâs husband, who advertises himself as a rainmaker, appears and offers to make it rain for $1000.00. The rains come, and Lin has to work hard to pay him. After Lin pays, Lusk has money, and Lin is broke. Katie leaves Lin and returns to the rainmaker. Lin is shocked to learn that Katie was already married when he married her. Linâs heart hardens toward women. Several years pass, and tender-hearted Lin is already softening when he meets pretty Jessamine Buckner, the new station agent. Lin falls for Jessamine, and she likes him. However, when Jessamine learns that he is married, she gives him up. In an act of generosity, Katie sets things right by telling Jessamine the truth about her marriage to Lin.\n\nComments: The story outline as written above is based on the synopsis in the âMoving Picture Weeklyâ, the magazine published by Universal Pictures to advertise its films to exhibitors. Reading the synopses of a film in several film magazines usually offers a variation of the story in every magazine. The synopses Lin McLean in Motion Picture Weekly and Exhibitors Herald provide an extreme example of dramatically different endings of a plot. In MPW, Katie tells Jessamine the truth about her marriage to Lin, thus freeing him to marry Jessamine. In EH, Lin rejects Katie when she attempts to reenter his life and subsequently commits suicide. Since the film is believed lost, the correct storyline cannot be determined. A womanâs suicide seems an extreme and melodramatic method of freeing Carey. Unlike any other ending of a Ford/Carey film, a suicide is a somber way to end a film that apparently was intended to be primarily a comedy.\n\nThe film, set in the west, is loosely based on incidents in the Owen Wister novel. In the novel, the youthful Lin tires of the hard life of a cowboy and heads east to seek his fortune. As time passes and Lin matures, he loses many of the qualities of a Westerner without settling comfortably into the life style of an Easterner.\n\nIn the film, the âLinâ character maintains his cowboy qualities. The film portrays aspects of a rancherâs life in the West. Ford and Carey claimed credit for the first motion picture to show a chuck wagon/portable kitchen. They claimed that the make-up of the wagon was correct to the smallest detail.\n\nOwen Wister, born in Philadelphia and Harvard educated, became fascinated with the lore and landscape of the western country. His most famous work, âThe Virginianâ (1902), is credited with being the first western novel and originating the archetypal cowboy. âLin Mcleanâ (1898), his first novel, moves the action from west to east and is not specifically a western.\n\nThree Mounted Men\n\nReleased: October 7, 1918 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Neva Gerber, Joe Harris\n\nWriter: Eugene B. Lewis, story and screenplay\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, outlaw, robber\n\nStory: In a western penitentiary, the crooked son of the warden is appropriating government money with the aid of a former forger, Buck Masters, who works in the prison office. Cheyenne Harry, another convict, and Masters have been friends, but when Harry objects to Masters stealing government money, they fight. As a punishment for fighting, Harry is sentenced to solitary confinement. The wardenâs son obtains a pardon for Masters, who turns around and blackmails him. The wardenâs son then obtains a pardon for Harry on the condition that he get Masters rearrested. Upon leaving prison, Harry meets up with his brothers and they travel to the western town where Masters is living. In the town, Harry meets and falls in love with Lola, a dance hall girl and coincidentally Mastersâ sister, although Harry does not know that fact. Harry learns that Masters plans to rob a stage. Masters wants the money for his mother and sister, but Harry does not know about Mastersâ motivation. Harry informs the law about the stage holdup, and Masters is arrested. Only after the arrest does Harry learn that Masters is the brother of Lola. Harry and his brothers ride after the coach carrying Masters to jail and rescue him. They bring him back to his mother and sister. With her brother saved, Lola plans to marry Harry.\n\nComments: This film has one of the most unlikely plots of all the Ford/Carey westerns. The story seems designed to feature scenes of Harry and his brothers on horseback against a backdrop of the beautiful western scenery of the Los Angeles region. The âVarietyâ reviewer noted that the âphotography is particularly happyâ.\n\nFord and Carey often included scenes that were unusual and innovative. In this film, the response of Harryâs eyes to light after weeks in the darkness of solitary was emphasized. Harry wears specially darkened glasses as his eyes readjust to the light. Carey in the glasses is seen in a picture in the January 1919 edition of âMotion Picture Newsâ\n\nRoped\n\nReleased: January 27, 1919 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Neva Gerber, J. Farrell MacDonald\n\nWriter: Eugene B. Lewis, story and screenplay\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, millionaire ranch owner\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry, owner of Broken Bow Ranch, wants to hire a housekeeper. The ranchâs cowboys devise a practical joke and advertise in the New York papers for a wife for their boss. Aileen Judson-Brown, a society belle, is forced by her bankrupt mother to answer the ad. Aileen promises that she would consent to marry the ranchman. Harry goes to New York to meet Aileen. Her mother is shocked by the western appearance of the prospective husband, until she learns that he is a millionaire. Harry and Aileen, mutually attracted, marry. Harry is so kind and good hearted that Aileen soon loves him sincerely. They have a child. Now that Aileen has Harryâs money, her mother schemes to separate them and marry Aileen to a socialite. She tells Harry that Aileen does not want him. She takes the child and tells Harry that the child has died. She tells Aileen that Harry is tired or her. Harry plans to leave but is informed by the butler of the motherâs deceit. Harry returns to see his child and brings his cowboys with gifts. Harry and Aileen meet, and Aileen understands the love of Harry for herself and their child. They are reconciled and move to Harryâs ranch that now has its permanent housekeeper.\n\nComments: The setting changes from a western ranch to New York City where Careyâs cowboy millionaire marries a girl of New Yorkâs smart, but poor, set. The reviewer in âVarietyâ gave the film a rating of âfairâ. He wrote that the film lacked spirit for Carey and Gerber and poorly blended the West with 5th Ave. He commented that the film was a universal special only in being 6, rather than 5, reels.\n\nA Fight For Love\n\nReleased: March 24, 1919 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Neva Gerber, J. Farrell MacDonald, Joe Harris\n\nWriter: Eugene B. Lewis, story and screenplay\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, cattle rustler, range rider\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harry, wanted for cattle rustling, escapes into Canada. He drifts into an Indian camp and becomes friendly with the Chief and his daughter. Black Michael, a half-breed, sells liquor to the Indians. Michael is pursuing the Indian girl and clashes with Harry over her, Michael informs the Mounted Police that Cheyenne Harry is in the camp. Harry flees in a canoe. He makes his way to the settlement run by a local office of the Hudsonâs Bay Company. The Hudsonâs Bay factor buys whiskey from Black Michael. Harry becomes friendly with Kate, the factorâs lovely daughter. Michael tries to make love to Kate, who rejects him, and Harry runs him off. At the Indian camp, Harry and the local priest fight a white gang of whiskey runners. The Chief is killed, and Harry is accused of the murder. He flees again. At the Hudsonâs Bay settlement, Michael kidnaps Kate. Harry pursues them. At the edge of a cliff, Harry and Michael have a terrific fight. Michael plunges over the cliff. Before he dies, Michael confesses to the killing of the Chief. Harry is exonerated and united with Kate.\n\nComments: The Canadian setting provided the filmmakers with picturesque locations, such as a lake in the woods, snow scenes in mountains, and the Natives catching fish in a pool. This forested scenery was unlike the open country of the American west where Cheyenne Harry usually roamed. The reviewer in âVarietyâ complimented the gorgeous long-distance photography. Although the setting is Canada, the film was probably mostly or entirely shot in the higher altitudes of the mountains surrounding Los Angeles.\n\nFord and Carey mixed comedy, romance, and pathos with plenty of action. The action included escapes by horseback and canoe, a big fight with the whiskey runners, and the final fierce fight at the edge of a cliff. A humorous characterization was provided by the affable J. Farrell McDonald as the fighting priest. The drunken Harry and Chief beat a rhythmic serenade on whiskey barrels.\n\nThe social code of the time allowed Harry to carry on a mild flirtation with the Indian girl, but he could only unite with a white woman. A union between the white woman and the half-breed would have been unthinkable, a disgrace for her under any circumstances.\n\nBare Fists\n\nReleased: April 5, 1919 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Betty Schade, Joe Harris, Vester Pegg\n\nWriters: Eugene B. Lewis, Bernard McConville\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, range rider\n\nStory: Cheyenne Harryâs father, the town marshall, is killed trying to quell a saloon brawl. Harry promises his grieving mother that he will never carry a gun again and will use only his bare fists if he has to fight. It is difficult for Harry to keep this promise; it costs him both the respect of his friends and the fear of his enemies. His cattle are stolen, but he is able to punish the rustlers with his fists only. The leader of the rustlers and Harry are interested in the same girl. She favors Harry. To get rid of Harry, the rustlers frame him for the shooting of an unarmed man. Tried and convicted, Harry is sentenced to be hanged. He is allowed to visit his mother, but he does not tell her of his fate. His young brother, left to protect the ranch, discovers the rustlers at work. They brand him on the chest. This act is too much for Harry; he returns to the jail but immediately escapes with the sheriffâs gun. He confronts and kills the rustlers. Returned to jail, he is about to hang, when a witness comes forward and exonerates him.\n\nComments: Lawrence Reid writing in the âMotion Picture Newsâ headlines his paragraph about the film âCharacter study of primitive emotion and act of self defense.â Reid characterizes the plot as an example of simple love and devotion; a quantity of sentimental interest and pathos is attached to Harryâs mother and brother. Schade provides the usual love interest. In the end the hero must use a gun.\n\nAlthough this is Bernard McConvilleâs only credit for a Ford/Carey film, he wrote nearly 100 stories and scenarios in a 30 year career that began in 1915. During the silent era, McConville wrote stories for a variety of film genres. After 1929, his scenarios are nearly all for B-westerns.\n\nRiders of Vengeance\n\nReleased: June 9, 1919 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Seena Owen, J. Farrell MacDonald, Joe Harris, Vester Pegg\n\nWriters: John Ford and Harry Carey, story; Eugene B. Lewis, scenario\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, cattleman, outlaw\n\nStory: Cattleman Cheyenne Harry is marrying the girl of his heart. As the couple leave the church, the enemies of Harry and his family, lead by Buell, local strongman, saloon owner and cattle rustler, attack the wedding party killing the bride and Cheyenneâs parents. Harry mourns and vows vengeance. Several years pass, and Harry returns to kill the murderers. He posts their names and sets out to kill them, one by one. His attacks are temporarily put aside when he rescues a pretty young woman, the only survivor of an Apache attack on a stagecoach. The grateful girl tells him that she has come to marry Sheriff Thurman, who Harry believes, mistakenly, to be the leader of the massacre. He thinks of harming the girl in revenge on the sheriff, but is deterred by her innocence. He takes her back to town. Harry identifies Buell as the actual leader of murderers and cleverly arranges Buellâs death at the hands of his own confederates. Harryâs killings have made him a wanted outlaw pursued by Sheriff Thurman. Harry and the sheriff meet in the desert. Before the sheriff can attempt an arrest, they are attacked by Apaches. During the fight, the sheriff convinces Harry of his innocence in the wedding killings. Both men are wounded, and Harry struggles to bring the sheriff back to the Girl. The Sheriff dies after they get back to town. Eventually, Harry is exonerated. He and the Girl find love and plan to marry.\n\nComments: The reviewer in âVarietyâ describes the filmâs plot as âa regular, corking, snorting, melodramatic storyâ, âfull of action, suspense, and excellent detailâ âSeena Owen fails to make the most of her part; she is more suited to drawing room roles than to light innocence.â Owen appeared in few westerns and was better suited for contemporary roles in which her make-up and costumes were showier than would be appropriate for a demure, western school teacher. She only made one film with Carey. Patsy Smith in her âVarietyâ column, âAmong the Womenâ, described Owen as an attractive schoolmarm, appropriately in period with her velvet dress and cape. Smith appreciated the character work of an older actress, âa real, old fashioned prosperous, half-foreign country woman in voluminous brocade, lace collar, and long ear pendents, a pipe in her mouth and a heavy cane clasped in strong hands, a truthful portrayal of the type.â Characters in westerns were rarely given any notice in âAmong the Womenâ or similar columns.\n\nHarry Carey in The Outcasts of Poker Flat (1919)\n\nThe Outcasts of Poker Flats\n\nReleased: June 29. 1919 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Cullen Landis, Gloria Hope, J. Farrell MacDonald, Vester Pegg, Joe Harris\n\nWriter: H. Tipton Steck; Bret Harte, short story: âOutcasts of Poker Flatâ\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: John Oakhurst/Square Shootinâ Harry Lanyon, square gamblers\n\nStory: Thomas Lanyon watches the girl he loves with his adopted son. Their happiness is of paramount importance to him. Although she cares for Thomas, he thinks that the girl would be happier with the younger man. He feels an obligation to the boy, the son of his best friend. Thomas picks up a book, Bret Harteâs âOutcasts of Poker Flatâ. The book is about the romantic triangle of John Oakhurst and the youngsters, Sophy and Tommie. Thomasâs case is similar to that of Oakhurst, the square gambler of the Polka Saloon: Oakhurst had rescued Sophy from the lecherous Stratton and brought her to safety. Tommie, Oakhurstâs protegee, has fallen in love with her. Stratton had followed Oakhurst and Sophy and made unwelcome advances to the girl. Tommie attacks Stratton who shoots him. Sophy nurses Tommie. Oakhurst shoots Stratton. Although she loves Oakhurst, Sophy decides to marry Tommie. Oakhurst gives her up to the boy. Some time after the wedding, Sophy, Tommie and Oakhurst are caught in a fierce storm. Oakhurst sacrifices himself to save the young couple. Lanyon shuts the book. He says to himself that it was great to read, but Oakhurst was a fool, even if noble and self sacrificing. He, Thomas Lanyon, will not follow the same path. He loves the girl and will plead his own case. Thomas goes to her and finds that she was his all the time. The film ends on a clinch.\n\nComments: The story of âThe Outcasts of Poker Flatâ as portrayed in the film is greatly altered from the plot of the short story as written by Bret Harte. The only shared story points are the name of the gambler, John Oakhurst, and the snow storm that traps the characters. In the short story, four people, two prostitutes, the town drunkard, and Oakhurst, a gambler, are put out of the town of Poker Flat. An engaged couple join the four outcasts. The drunkard runs off with their mules, leaving the others trapped in the snow. The young man goes off to get help. The women die of cold and hunger. Oakhurst, despairing of escape, commits suicide. Harte describes Oakhurst as the strongest and the weakest of the outcasts of Poker Flat.\n\nThe screenwriter has rewritten the plot into two conventional love triangles with the story involving Oakhurst embedded in the main storyline. Carey plays a self sacrificing gambler and a successful lover, but neither persona is found in the original story. Careyâs characterization as a professional gambler, rather than his usual range rider, meant a change in his costume. Advertising pictures for the film show Carey in a white shirt and tie, dark suit and rakish hat, flourishing a cigar.\n\nBorn in Albany New York in 1836, Bret Harte moved to California in 1853. He wrote about the gold mining camps and the people who lived in them. Harte returned East in 1871. He lived many years in Europe. He wrote about many different places and people but his success and fame rest on his stories about gold rush California.\n\nAce of the Saddle\n\nReleased: August 18, 1919 (Believed lost)\n\nCast: Peggy Pearce, Joe Harris, Duke R Lee, Vester Pegg\n\nWriter: George Hively, Frederick J. Jackson, story\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry Henderson, cattleman\n\nStory: In Yucca County, Arizona, Sheriff Loughlin and his confederates are rustling Harryâs cattle. Harry goes to Pinkerton Co to ask the assistence of Sheriff Faulkner. He meets the sheriffâs daughter, Madeline, and falls for her. She does not like guns and convinces Harry to put his guns aside. At Harryâs ranch, Loughlin poisons the water, and his gang raids Harryâs ranch house. To avoid using his guns, Harry has purchased dynamite. When he sets it off, the gang flees in all directions. Harry and his cowboys capture two of the raiders. One of them is Loughlin. Loughlin is put on trial. During the trial, his gang incites a melee and Loughlin escapes. Loughlin wants vengeance, and his gang kidnap Madeline from her home. Harry pursues the kidnappers and rescues Madeline. Harry decides to oust the villainous sheriff of Yucca Co and nominates his foreman for sheriff. After the foreman wins, peace and law prevail in Yucca Co. Harry and Madeline marry.\n\nComments: After the complex plot and production requirements of The Outcasts of Poker Flats, Ford and Carey produced a film with a simple plot and production methods.\n\nThe Rider of the Law\n\nReleased: November 3, 1919 - believed lost\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Gloria Hope, Joe Harris, Vester Pegg, Duke R Lee\n\nWriter: G. B. Lancaster, H. Tipton Streck\n\nStory: Jim Kyneton, a member of the Mounted Police, is stationed in a mining district. He is ordered to capture the thieves who have been robbing the mines. The thieves include Nick, Jimâs foster brother, and The Kid, the brothersâ new friend, who has come west for his health. Despite his attachment to this pair, Jim arrests them along with the other thieves. In his private life, Jim has a complicated relationship with two young women. Roseen, a dance hall girl, is in love with him, but he does not return her affection. Roseen is jealous of Betty, an orphan girl who Jimâs mother has been raising. Jim is in love with Betty but hides his affection because he thinks she loves Nick. The angry Roseen releases the prisoners from jail. Jim recaptures two of them, but his brother and The Kid escape. Jim pursues them and captures The Kid. Nick, repentent and unable to face jail, rides his horse off a cliff. Jim sorrowfully returns home to tell his mother and Betty of his brotherâs death. Although Betty is sad that Nick is dead, she is not devastated. She has always loved Jim, who gains some happiness from her unexpected return of his love.\n\nComments: G. B. Lancaster was the pseudonym of Edith Joan Lyttelton, who was born in Tasmania and grew up in New Zealand. Edith Lyttelton was the most widely read New Zealand author of the first half of the 20th Century. She wrote novels and hundreds of short stories, mostly about Australia, New Zealand, or Canada. Several of her stories were adapted for films. This film, however, has an original screenplay that she wrote with H. T, Streck, her only screenplay for a Ford/Carey film.\n\nThe âVariety â reviewer wroteâ¦.âthe film hits the high spots all the way, action, mystery, love, excellent photography, capable direction. Ford overlooks few bets in handling Carey who has dignity, force and is the master of his roles.â\n\nThe reviewer also notes that the brotherâs suicide by riding his horse over a cliff thrilled the audience.\n\nA Gun Fightin' Gentleman\n\nReleased: November, 29, 1919 - three reels survive\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Kathleen OâConnor, J. Barney Sherry, Duke R Lee, Joe Harris\n\nWriter: Harry Carey, John Ford, story; Hal Hoadley, scenario\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, ranch owner\n\nStory: Systematically cheated by businessman John Merritt, the head of a big packing company, Cheyenne Harry is determined to keep his ranch against the land-grabbing Merritt. A hired assassin ambushes Harry and attempts to push him off a cliff. Harry kills the attacker in self defense. Harry is arrested but acquitted at trial. He loses his ranch to Merritt who cheats him out of his title. Angered, Harry goes to the city to settle accounts. When Harry arrives at Merrittâs home, a dinner party is in progress. Helen, Merrittâs daughter, decides to invite the uncouth westerner to the dinner as an amusement for the guests. His behavior, however, is exemplary, and she finds him interesting and good hearted. Also at the dinner is a British Earl who is courting Helen with her fatherâs approval. Back home, Harry robs Merrittâs pay-rolls to get back the value of his stolen ranch. He sends receipts to Merritt for the money. Helen and the Earl visit the ranch. The Earl hires the outlaw, Cheyenne Harry, to kidnap the girl. The Earl plans a dash to her rescue. Harry kidnaps Helen and keeps her a prisoner. His behavior is perfectly gentlemanly while she is with him. The wrongs committed against him win her sympathy and support. When a gunman attempts to take Helen, Harry saves her but is wounded. Helen nurses him. Helenâs father regrets his actions and returns Harryâs property. Helen, who has come to love Harry, refuses to return home, and they plan a wedding.\n\nComments: Despite the titleâs reference to Harry as a gunfighter, the film had less action and greater emphasis on domestic interactions than was usual for a Ford/Carey film. By this point they had developed a lot of scenarios for Carey, and new approaches were probably difficult to work up. Ford and Carey wrote the story; Harold (Hal) Hoadley wrote the scenario. Hal was the son of scenarist C, B, Hoadley who wrote the scenarios for nearly fifty shorts. Hal Hoadley wrote scenarios for only eight feature films. Both Hoadleys had ceased writing by 1921.\n\nHarry Carey in Marked Men (1919)\n\nMarked Men\n\nReleased: December 21, 1919 - believed lost\n\nCast: J.

Kyne, novel: âThree Godfathersâ\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Cheyenne Harry, outlaw, robber\n\nStory: Harry and his pals are in prison for train robbery. They break jail and ride away, carrying on a running gun battle with the prison guards. They separate and plan to meet later at a mining camp. While waiting, Harry meets and falls in love with a waitress in a dance hall. She warns him that the sheriff is suspicious. Joined by his pals, they plan a bank robbery. The girl pleads with Harry not to rob the bank, but he feels that he owes loyalty to his friends. They pull off the robbery and flee into the desert with the sheriff and his deputies in pursuit. Fleeing across the desert, the trio come upon a wrecked wagon. In the wagon, a woman has given birth to a baby girl. The dying woman requests the men to be three godfathers to the child and carry her to safety. She asks them to bring the child up to be as good as they are themselves. The trio promise to carry the baby to the nearest town. After days of suffering from little water and frequent sandstorms, two have died. Harry trudges on and reaches a town. His girl and the sheriff are waiting for him. The baby saves Harry. A bible that he has carried with the child shows the sheriff that the baby is his niece. For his selfless actions to save an innocent child, Harry is pardoned by the governor.\n\nComments: The film was released during December 1919. In his notes for exhibitors, the author of the service page in âMoving Picture Weeklyâ promotes the film is an artistic production appropriate for the Christmas season. As an example of an artistic touch, the reviewer mentions the cross shaped giant cactus before which the three godfathers swear to cherish the baby.\n\nThe story was adapted from a 1913 novel, âThree Godfathersâ by western novelist Peter B. Kyne. The novel has been adapted for the screen several times. Carey starred in a 1916 version, named 3 Godfathers, directed by Edward LeSaint. The first talkie version Hell's Heroes (1929) starred Charles Bickford, directed by William Wyler. In 1936, Chester Morris starred in 3 Godfathers, directed by Richard Boleslawski.\n\nFord told Peter Bogdanovich that Marked Men was a favorite of his early films, and he remembered it very well. They put 31/2 weeks into making it, longer than usual. He liked the story so well that he wanted to remake it. Fordâs 1948 remake, titled 3 Godfathers starred John Wayne, with Harry Carey Jr. as one of the three men. The title sequence dedicates the film âTo the memory of HARRY CAREY, Bright Star of the early western sky.â In the background a horseman, his clothes and hat the same as Carey wore, rides up a slope, stops, rises slightly in his saddle, takes off his hat and rubs his head, sits back with a hand on the horse behind the saddle, and moves around slightly.\n\nPeter B. Kyne, American novelist, published 25 novels and 1000 short stories between 1909 and 1940. His wide ranging literary interests included war stories, sea stories, westerns, hunting stories, business romances, and horse racing stories. More than 100 films have been made from his work, beginning in 1914. âThe Valley of the Giantsâ (1918), a story of the California redwoods, has also been adapted to multiple films. Silent star Wallace Reid starred in a 1919 version.\n\nFreeze Out\n\nReleased: April 9, 1921 - believed lost\n\nCast: Helen Ferguson, Joe Harris, J.

In retaliation, Denver and Headlight burn the building and give whiskey to Bobtail. Undaunted, Ohio continues building. Despite her indignation, Zoe forms a friendship with Ohio. Headlight and Denver pick a fight with Ohio who challenges them in turn. Ohio whips the gamblers, threatens to shoot them, and drives Headlight and Denver out of town. When the doors of the new building open, it proves to be a school and library. Ohio and Zoe get together.\n\nComments: McElliott, reviewer of the Moving Picture Weekly, pointed out the âhomely angularityâ of Careyâs features and the âsincere honestyâ of his behavior. âA rough diamond who has his corners polished off by a pretty, fiery and earnest maiden. She burns to reform the town and also the stranger.â\n\nThe Wallop\n\nReleased: May 9, 1921 -believed lost\n\nCast: Harry Carey, Mignonne Golden, J. Farrell MacDonald, William Gettinger. Joe Harris\n\nWriter: George C. Hull, scenario; Eugene Manlove Rhodes, story: âGirl He Left Behind Himâ\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: John Wesley Pringle, wandering range-rider\n\nStory: John Wesley Pringle, adventurer, returns after five years to reunite with Stella Vorhis, the girl he left behind. Pringle meets with Stella and accepts that she is now in love with another man, Chris Foy. Foy is the opposing candidate for sheriff against incumbent Sheriff Matt Lisner. Sheriff Lisner, determined to be reelected, intends to use the enmity between Foy and a neighboring rancher, Dick Marr, to gain the advantage. The sheriffâs men shoot Marr on his way home. The Sheriff arrests Foy for the killing and plants the gun used in the killing on him. Pringle is determined to help Foy who obviously has been framed. Pringle holds up the Sheriff and allows Foy to escape. Foy hides out. Pringle proves that the sheriffâs men shot Marr. The sheriffâs deputy arrests the sheriff for the murder of Marr. Pringle smiles as Stella rides off with Foy.\n\nComments: Mignonne Golden, playing Stella, was Careyâs sister-in-law. She appeared with him on stage in his vaudeville act. This is one of the few Ford/Carey films without a love interest. Probably, Carey did not want to be romantically involved with his sister-in-law, even if only in a movie.\n\nEugene Manlove Rhodes, American writer, lived in New Mexico during the early years of cattle ranching. Rhodes worked on a ranch and observed the ways of the cowboy. His novels and short stories, mostly westerns, depict the lives of working cowboys.\n\nDesperate Trails\n\nReleased: June 1921 - believed lost\n\nCast: Irene Rich, Barbara La Marr, George Siegmann\n\nWriter: Elliott J. Clawson; Courtney Ryley Cooper, story: âChistmas Eve at Pilot Butteâ published in âRed Book Magazineâ, January 1921\n\nCareyâs Name and Character: Bart Carson, range rider, cowboy\n\nStory; Bart Carson builds a cabin for Lady Lou, whom he loves.

To protect Lou, Bart assumes the guilt for the robbery and is sentenced to prison for 16 yrs. Word comes to the prison through underground channels that the man, Walter A. Walker, and Lady Lou are lovers. Moreover, the man is the worthless husband who has deserted Mrs Walker and their children. Angered, Bart escapes in a packing case and goes after Walker and Lou. He finds them on a train leaving the area. Bart and Walker fight, and Walker plunges to his death from a trestle. Bart escapes. On Christmas Eve with the sheriff in pursuit, he arrives at Mrs Walkerâs house. The impoverished family cannot afford Christmas presents for the children. Bart promises a present for each of them. He tells the boy to put cuffs on him. The boy goes along because he thinks that they are playacting. However, Bart intends that when the sheriff comes the boy can claim the reward. The friendly sheriff arrives; he tells Bart that Lou has confessed the robbery and the frame-up. It is indicated that a trial judge will treat Bart fairly.\n\nComments: The snow scenes with the train were shot on the scenic Southern Pacific RR tracks near the town of Truckee in the Sierra Nevada. Courtney Ryley Cooper had a varied career as a American circus performer, newspaper reporter, publicist, and a writer of over 30 novels, many short stories, magazine articles, and non-fiction works. Many of his stories concerned either the circus or urban crime. His interest in crime brought him a friendship with J. Edgar Hoover, and he published books and articles about the new Federal Bureau of Investigation. This film is based on a western Christmas story written for Red Book Magazine.\n\nFord's Actors\n\nNine actors appeared in multiple Ford/Carey films. Molly Malone and Neva Gerber played Careyâs love interest in several films. The characters played by Vester Pegg, Duke Lee, and Joe Harris varied greatly from film to film, from uprightness in one film to utter villainy in the next.\n\nNeva Gerber\n\nNeva Gerber was 21 years old in 1912 when her film career began with the Kalem Film Company. She joined the Universal Film Company in 1916 and was Careyâs costar in four films. Pleasant and attractive, her substantial presence and self assurance made her a forceful costar for Carey. In the 1920âs Gerber teamed with actor-director Ben F. Wilson to make a series of action movies, mostly serials and westerns. Gerber appeared in two talkies directed by Wilson. After his death in 1930, she left the screen.\n\nHoot Gibson\n\nHoot Gibsonâs film career began in 1910 with a few films for the Biograph Company interspersed among rodeo competitions. In 1914 he was a stuntman for the serial, The Hazards of Helen, doubling the serialâs star Helen Holmes. His stunts included fights on trains and transfers from a train to a horse. He had supporting roles in numerous western shorts, including playing the villain in Knights of the Range (1916) opposite Harry Carey. Hoot appeared in three of the 1917 westerns made by Carey and Ford: Straight Shooting, The Secret Man, and A Marked Man. Hootâs starring career at Universal Studios was launched in two films directed by Ford, Action (1921) and Sure Fire (1921). In these films, Hoot plays a wandering cowboy who rescues his co-star from outlaws. Hoot became a popular western star for Universal. Films with titles such as Ridinâ Wild (1922), Thrill Chaser (1923), Hit and Run (1924), Hurricane Kid (1925), and Galloping Fury (1927) guaranteed Hootâs fans five reels of action and fun. Hootâs easy going approach gave his films a lighthearted tone. A deft comedian, he featured as much comedy as drama.\n\nAs talkies arrived, Hoot continued as a western star, but with lower budgets from producers such as M.H. Hoffman Inc (distributed on a state rights basis by Allied Pictures Corporation) and Walker Futter Productions (Diversion Pictures). In 1935, Hoot co-starred with Harry Carey in Powdersmoke Range, advertised by RKO as the âBarnum and Bailey of Westernsâ (whatever that means). The cast list of this âall starâ (B western stars) film included Bob Steele, Guinn âBig Boyâ Williams, Tom Tyler, William Farnum, and other westerners from the silent era. Hoot made a final set of program westerns in 1944 and retired from the screen.\n\nMignonne Golden\n\nMignonne Golden had a brief screen career. She only appeared in six films, 1920-1923, all starring Harry Carey. The Wallop (1921) was directed by Ford. The other five were directed by Val Paul, three at Universal and two at Robertson-Cole. Mignonne was Careyâs sister-in-law, the sister of Olive Golden Carey. Besides supporting Carey in six films, Mignonne appeared with him in his stage act. In the 1920s, Carey made several vaudeville tours featuring Western sketches with Mignonne in support .\n\nJoseph Harris\n\nMost of Joe Harrisâs films were westerns. Harris began his screen career in 1914 and had made over 60 shorts by 1916. Harris appeared with Carey in approximately twenty films. In 1918 he played the villain in Hell Bent, the first of his seven Carey/Ford film roles. While at Universal, Harris also appeared in Ford directed films starring Frank Mayo and Hoot Gibson. In 1922 at Fox Films, he appeared in Ford directed films starring Buck Jones and Tom Mix. His final two films in 1923 starred Carey.\n\nHarris was a lifelong friend of Harry Carey. After his movie career ended, he worked for Carey and lived with the Carey family, presumably on Careyâs ranch. Carey had been dead for several years when Harris died in 1953, reportedly at the home of Harry Carey Jr.\n\nGloria Hop\n\nGloria Hope has 27 credited film appearances from 1917 to 1926. A pretty blond, her roles were frequently as the sister or the youthful love interest of the star. Beside Universal, She acted for Ince, Triangle, Paramount and Goldwyn.

In 1922, she had a featured role in the Mary Pickford vehicle Tess of the Storm Country. In 1926, Gloria married actor Lloyd Hughes and retired. The marriage lasted 32 years until Hughesâ death in 1958.\n\nDuke R. Lee\n\nDuke R. Lee was active from 1914 to 1946. A hearty-looking actor with an open, unpolished manner, Lee made a jovial and lively friend or a menacing enemy. Almost all his films were westerns. He was in many Carey films, six of them directed by Ford. He also appeared with notable silent westerners Tom Mix, Jack Hoxie, Art Accord, Hoot Gibson and Jack Holt. Lee continued into talkies, mostly in uncredited roles, in films starring Ken Maynard, Bob Custer, Tom Tyler, Hoot Gibson and Gene Autry. He was uncredited in four John Ford talkies, Judge Priest (1934), Prisoner of Shark Island (1936), Stagecoach (1939) and My Darling Clementine (1946), Leeâs final film.\n\nJ. Farrell MacDonald\n\nAfter his graduation from Yale University in 1903, J. Farrell MacDonald started his acting career on the stage and came to films after extensive theatrical experience. MacDonald was heavy set and plain featured, with a round face and nearly bald head. Despite a stern demeanor, his film characters were usually sociable and fatherly. Talkies revealed a gravely voice that lent itself to roles as policemen and clergymen.\n\nIn 1910, MacDonald started at Biograph and was an actor and director at a variety of early film studios, including Imp, Triangle, Sennett, and Pathe. He was in seven of the Ford/Carey features. He acted for Ford at Fox Studios and had prominent roles in The Iron Horse (1924) and Three Bad Men(1926), Fordâs most important silent westerns. After 1929, MacDonald made many westerns but also was frequently cast, in contemporary settings, as an Irish policeman. MacDonaldâs was in six Ford talkies, including My Darling Clementine (1946) and When Willie Comes Marching Home (1950).\n\nMolly Malone\n\nMolly Maloneâs relatively short screen career, 1916-1929, was confined to silent films. An older actress she was nearly 29 when she appeared in her first Ford/Carey film, The Soul Herder (1917). She acted in the first eight Ford/Carey features. She was Careyâs love interest in Straight Shooting. After leaving Universal, Malone was with several small film companies, including Nester and Selznick. By 1921, she was mostly down the cast list, playing character roles.\n\nVester Pegg\n\nVester Pegg was thin and somewhat sharp featured with a small dark mustache. His looks enhanced his frequent roles as devious, sulking villains. Peggâs film career began in 1912, and he had small roles in Griffithâs The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. He appeared with Carey in several shorts including the two directed by Ford, Soul Herder and Cheyenneâs Pal. He appears in many Carey/Ford features, including a prominent role in Straight Shooting where he and Carey stalk each other through the streets of a western town. In the twenties Pegg had small parts with many western stars including Jack Mower, Franklyn Farnum, Hal Taliaferro, Buck Jones and Jack Holt. By 1928 he was in uncredited roles, usually playing henchmen. He continued into talkies playing uncredited henchmen in films with stars such as Buck Jones and George OâBrien. He was in Fordâs 1930âs films Steamboat Round the Bend, Prisoner of Shark Island, and plays one of the Plummer boys who have a shootout with John Wayne in Stagecoach In the early forties he is in Roy Rogers westerns. His final film was an uncredited role in the Columbia Pictures production Best Man Wins (1948).\n\nWilliam Steele (William Gettinger)\n\nFrom the start of his film career in 1912 until his final film in 1956, William Steele appeared almost exclusively in westerns. Tall, well built, and good looking, Steele filled the background of a scene where he looked good, but was not required to act. His birth name was William Gittinger. Early in his career he used several variations on Gittenger. In his six roles in Ford/Carey westerns he is named in the cast list as William Gettinger. He assumed the screen name William Steele in 1921. During the twenties, Steele appeared with cowboy stars such as Jack Hoxie, Buck Jones, and Hoot Gibson. During the thirties, Steele appeared uncredited in many programer westerns, frequently with Buck Jones. From the late thirties, Steele began to appear, uncredited, in high budget westerns such as Destry Rides Again (1939), San Antonio (1945), and Calamity Jane (1953). He had roles in two John Ford talkies, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and The Searchers (1956). In The Searchers, Steeleâs final film. his named character, Nesby, is a member of a posse led by Ward Bond.\n\nFord's Cinematographers\n\nFilm reviewers praised the fine photography of the Ford/Carey films in almost every review. Cinematography featuring the spectacular scenery of the American West was an important component of Fordâs films from the beginning of his directorial career and greatly enhanced his films with Carey. The fine photography of the Ford/Carey films was mostly the work of two cameramen, Benjamin F. Reynolds and John W Brown.\n\nBenjamin F. Reynolds\n\nBenjamin F. Reynolds\n\nBen Reynolds was shooting newsreels for Universal Animated Weekly and was an assistant cameraman on low budget dramatic productions at the time he was assigned to shoot Fordâs first film, The Scrapper. Ford took Reynolds to shoot Soul Herder and then Straight Shooting. His skills made him a valuable member of the Ford/Carey troupe. He filmed 12 Ford/Carey features. Reynolds remained with Universal after the departures of Ford and Carey. In 1919, he photographed Erich von Stroheimâs first feature Blind Husbands and subsequently became von Stroheimâs chief cinematographer, filming all of his major productions, including Foolish Wives (1922) and Greed (1924). During the 1930âs, at Paramount, Reynolds photographed several of the studioâs Zane Gray adaptations starring Randolph Scott, directed by Henry Hathaway. He also was cameraman on two WC Fields films, Tillie and Gus (1933), and The Old Fashioned Way (1934). Ill health forced his retirement in 1935.\n\nJohn W. Brown\n\nJohn W Brown, who also went by Jack Brown, accumulated 71 credits during his short, 1915 to 1926, career as a cinematographer. He worked with Ben Reynolds on six of the early Ford/Carey films and was the principle cameraman on most of the films made in 1919. None of the Ford/Carey films he photographed are known to survive."
