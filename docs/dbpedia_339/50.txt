Where to Watch

When Europe was being overrun by Hitler's war machine, the future of the free world looked grim. Joining the fight were forces from across the ocean, as the loyal subjects of the British Colonies were called upon to aid Britain with munitions and manpower. This documentary tells the stories of those Canadians who served in the war effort and who earned the Victoria Cross, Canada's highest medal of honor. The bravery of its recipients is chronicled by personal accounts, archival film clips, photographs, and commentary by historians.
