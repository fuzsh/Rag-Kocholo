        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe UK uses sanctions to fulfil a range of purposes, including supporting foreign policy and national security objectives, as well as maintaining international peace and security, and preventing terrorism. Sanctions measures include arms embargoes, trade sanctions and other trade restrictions.\n\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) is responsible for overall UK policy on sanctions. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) implements trade sanctions and other trade restrictions and has overall responsibility for trade sanctions licensing.\n\nThe UK implements a range of UK sanctions regimes through regulations established under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (the Sanctions Act). The Sanctions Act provides the legal basis for the UK to impose, update and lift sanctions. These regimes apply to the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are compliant with the requirements of the new legislation.\n\nFor more information see the UK sanctions regimes under the Sanctions Act.\n\nYou can find out more about the UK sanctions policy after 31 December 2020.\n\nDBT’s Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU) has overall responsibility for trade sanctions licensing. Licence applications can be made through the online export licensing system SPIRE. You can provide extra information on the activities you wish to carry out in a cover letter. You should attach this and any other documentation to the application. Contact us at tradesanctions@trade.gov.uk if you have any questions on trade sanctions licensing. For example, buying petroleum products for humanitarian relief in Syria.\n\nDBT’s import licensing branch is responsible for implementing trade sanctions relating to imports.\n\nArms embargo, trade sanctions and other trade restrictions\n\nAn arms embargo is a prohibition that applies to the trade or activities related to military items. An arms embargo may be imposed by the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) or the UK.\n\nUnder the Sanctions Act, arms embargoes consist of prohibitions on export, supply or delivery, making available and transfer of military items and on the provision of technical assistance, financial services and funds, and brokering services related to military items.\n\nTrade sanctions are controls on the:\n\nimport, export, transfer, movement, making available and acquisition of goods and technology\n\nprovision and procurement of services related to goods and technology\n\nprovision and procurement of certain other non-financial services\n\ninvolvement of UK people in these activities\n\nThere may be specific exceptions under which it is possible to engage in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited. It may also be possible to get a licence that would permit you to engage in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited.\n\nTrade controls\n\nThe UK also imposes trade controls on trafficking and brokering of military goods from one overseas country to another. Trade controls apply to specific activities, including brokering, that involve certain controlled goods.\n\nGoods which are subject to trade controls are specified in category A, category B and category C, of Schedule 1 to the Export Control Order 2008, as amended.\n\nArticle 20 of the Export Control Order 2008, as amended, sets out what trade controls apply in respect of embargoed destinations. Article 20 does not apply to countries with arms embargoes made under the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018.\n\nTransit controls\n\nCertain goods transiting the UK are regarded as being exported when they leave the country and are subject to control. Article 17 of the Export Control Order 2008 includes a transit and transhipment exception, meaning that in many situations a licence is not required.\n\nThis exception does not apply to certain goods destined for countries listed below, meaning that a licence is required to transit goods through the UK or tranship them in the UK with a view to re-exportation to these countries.\n\nThe Export Control Order 2008 includes a list of the countries which are subject to transit controls for military goods, and a list of countries which are subject to transit controls for Category B goods.\n\nMilitary goods are those as listed in Schedule 2 to the Export Control Order. Category B of the controls comprises small arms and light weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), long-range missiles and man-portable air-defence systems.\n\nTransit controls also apply to Category A goods for all countries.\n\nECOWAS restrictions\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) adopted a convention on small arms and light weapons, their ammunition and other related materials, and a moratorium on the import, export and manufacture of light weapons in June 2006.\n\nThe UK will not issue an export licence for small arms and light weapons, components or ammunition unless the ECOWAS Commission has issued an exception to its moratorium.\n\nCountries subject to arms embargo, trade sanctions and other trade restrictions\n\nThis list details specific countries where arms embargo, trade sanctions and other trade restrictions have been imposed. This list does not include countries subject to only financial or other types of sanctions.\n\nList of countries:\n\nAfghanistan (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nAlbania (transit control)\n\nArgentina (trade restrictions and transit control)\n\nArmenia (arms embargo, trade controls, and transit control)\n\nAzerbaijan (arms embargo, trade controls, and transit control)\n\nBelarus (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nBenin (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nBosnia/Herzegovina (transit control)\n\nBurkina Faso (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nBurma (Myanmar) (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nBurundi (transit control)\n\nCameroon (transit control)\n\nCape Verde (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nCentral African Republic (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nChad (transit control)\n\nChina (People’s Republic other than the Special Administrative Regions) (arms embargo and transit control)\n\nColombia (transit control)\n\nCongo (Brazzaville) (transit control)\n\nCôte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nDubai (transit control)\n\nEast Timor (Timor-Leste) (transit control)\n\nEritrea (transit control)\n\nEthiopia (transit control)\n\nGambia (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nGeorgia (transit control)\n\nGhana (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nGuinea (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nGuinea-Bissau (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nHaiti (transit control)\n\nHong Kong Special Administrative Region (arms embargo and transit control)\n\nIran (relating to human rights) (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nIran (relating to nuclear weapons) (trade sanctions (including an arms embargo) and transit control)\n\nIraq (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nJamaica (transit control)\n\nKenya (transit control)\n\nKrygyzstan (transit control)\n\nLebanon (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nLiberia (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nLibya (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nMacao Special Administrative Region (transit control)\n\nMali (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nMauritania (transit control)\n\nMoldova (transit control)\n\nMontenegro (transit control)\n\nMorocco (transit control)\n\nNepal (transit control)\n\nNiger (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nNigeria (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nOman (transit control)\n\nPakistan (transit control)\n\nRussia (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nRwanda (transit control)\n\nSenegal (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nSerbia (transit control)\n\nSierra Leone (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nSomalia (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nSri Lanka (transit control)\n\nSouth Sudan (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nSudan (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nSyria (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nTaiwan (transit control)\n\nTajikistan (transit control)\n\nTanzania (transit control)\n\nTogo (ECOWAS restrictions and transit control)\n\nTrinidad & Tobago (transit control)\n\nTurkmenistan (transit control)\n\nUganda (transit control)\n\nUkraine (trade sanctions applying to the non-government controlled territory, and transit control)\n\nUzbekistan (transit control)\n\nVenezuela (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nYemen (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nZimbabwe (trade sanctions including an arms embargo, and transit control)\n\nNon country-specific export policies and restrictions\n\nYou need an export licence before you can export controlled goods, software, and technology from the UK to another country. This is described in Schedules 2 and 3 to the Export Control Order 2008, as amended.\n\nFor further information you can read about licensing procedures and other restrictions for the export of:\n\nmilitary goods, software and technology\n\ndual-use items, software and technology, goods for torture and radioactive sources\n\nRestrictions applying to terrorist organisations\n\nThe UN Security Council has imposed measures against terrorist organisations in relation to financial and visa sanctions, and arms embargoes.\n\nFor more information on these restrictions, you can read about sanctions on:\n\nISIL (Da’esh) and Al-Qaida\n\ninternational counter-terrorism sanctions\n\nOverlap between trade sanctions and strategic export controls\n\nMilitary goods and technology\n\nPlease note that the export of and other trade in military goods and technology is controlled under sanctions regulations and the Export Control Order 2008, and so you may need a licence which is valid under both pieces of legislation.\n\nThis means that all licence applications relating to military goods and technology will need to be considered against the sanctions licensing purposes, and the strategic export licensing criteria. A licence under sanctions regulations is unlikely to be granted if a licence is refused for the same activity under the Export Control Order 2008.\n\nThe way this will work in practice is that we will consider an application for a licence which relates to activities that are licensable under both the sanctions regulations and the Export Control Order 2008 as an application under both pieces of legislation.\n\nThis means that only a single licence application is required. The application will be considered against the relevant licensing criteria. If a licence is granted, it will be valid under both the Export Control Order 2008 and the sanctions regulations.\n\nBreaching trade sanctions and export controls is a criminal offence. Find information on how to report a breach of trade sanctions.\n\nOverlap between trade sanctions and financial sanctions\n\nIf you trade in goods or services, you need to consider if financial sanctions apply to you. For instance, where your licensable trade activity may also involve making funds or an economic resource available to, or for the benefit of, a designated person.\n\nThe Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) is responsible for the implementation and administration of international financial sanctions in the UK. You may need a licence from OFSI as well as from the Export Control Joint Unit.\n\nOther non-trade-related restrictions\n\nThere are various non-trade-related restrictions in force which relate to UK exports, such as immigration sanctions, financial sanctions. The FCDO is responsible for overall UK policy on international sanctions. You can find information on other types of sanctions on the UK sanctions guidance page.\n\nFurther information\n\nFor general guidance on export controls and trade sanctions, contact the Export Control Joint Unit (ECJU):\n\nEmail: exportcontrol.help@trade.gov.uk Helpline: +44 (0)20 7215 4594\n\nTo receive latest updates about arms embargoes and changes to strategic export control legislation, subscribe to the Export Control Joint Unit’s Notices to Exporters.\n\nFor general guidance on import controls and trade sanctions contact: importcontrols@trade.gov.uk\n\nFor general information on sanctions email the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s Sanctions Unit on: sanctions@fcdo.gov.uk\n\nFor information on financial sanctions, contact the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation on OFSI@hmtreasury.gov.uk or subscribe to OFSI’s e-alerts."
