        "text": "Introduction\n\nMany drivers of mortality in LMICs are time-sensitive conditions, such as sepsis, trauma, and postpartum hemorrhage, that are responsive to emergency care [1,2,3,4]. Consequently, in 2019 a World Health Assembly resolution recognized emergency care as an essential component of healthcare systems and recommended that member states comprehensively assess their prehospital and hospital-based emergency care functionality [5].\n\nEmergency medical services (EMS) are a critical but traditionally overlooked component of emergency care systems and they are necessary for the expedient transport and care of patients from the field or to higher levels of care from other facilities [1,6]. Yet, only one third of African countries have EMS [7,8]. Currently in Africa, EMS ranges from basic transport by non-medical providers to advanced services with trained paramedics, including air transport [9]. Most EMS in Africa is a pay-for-service model, with some countries having varying combinations of private, government, and charity-run ambulance systems [10,11].\n\nZimbabwean EMS was first established in 1984 with private and public ambulance systems staffed by trained professionals ranging from basic emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to paramedics [11]. Until the mid-1990s, EMS in Zimbabwe boasted well-trained providers and state of the art equipment. However, Zimbabwe has experienced economic instability over the past 20 years, leading to poverty and declining health outcomes [12,13]. As the economy declined so did the state of EMS, which was compounded by a growing population unable to pay for EMS. This increased the demand for government and/or charity-run EMS over pay-for-service models. The economic strife has also made it extremely difficult for public EMS to maintain or acquire more modern equipment, resulting in the current stagnant state of EMS and healthcare more broadly [12]. As the country works to rebuild healthcare infrastructure, it is critical to understand the current state and the future potential of Zimbabwean EMS to improve health outcomes.\n\nTo date, there has been scant literature on Zimbabwean EMS and the data has only been by self-report [11,14]. There have been no studies on the epidemiology of emergency care conditions or the specifics of EMS utilization in Zimbabwe. In this study, we begin to address this critical gap in the literature. We conducted a retrospective review of patient care reports (PCRs) to characterize the utilization of EMS and associated transport patterns in Zimbabwean EMS system. This study is important for strengthening the developing emergency care system in Zimbabwe and for providing useful insights for other LMICs.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study represents the first retrospective chart review of EMS in Zimbabwe and adds to the body of literature on the requirements of EMS in Africa. For Zimbabwe, this study can provide an initial framework for clinical, operational, and public health efforts surrounding EMS. We found that over half of EMS transports were for IFTs. This is consistent with research on similar ambulance systems in Sub-Saharan Africa or 45% IFTs in Ghana’s National ambulance system EMS assessment [14]. Strikingly, maternity-related transports accounted for slightly over half of all IFTs, which is internally consistent with the finding that the IFT patients were primarily women of child bearing age presenting with a pregnancy-related chief complaint. Prior research across LMICs has also shown that obstetrics cases often account for a large proportion of emergency care transports in developing EMS systems [18].\n\nThe high percent of maternity-related IFTs may be related to low numbers of comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) centers, where blood transfusions and surgeons are available to perform caesarean sections [19]. While LMICs have long been encouraged to promote births in CEmOC facilities, these centers may be few and their costs prohibitive [20]. A large proportion of women in LMICs rather delivers in midwife-led facilities without advanced obstetric providers or comprehensive emergency resources available [20,21]. When obstetric emergencies do arise, women from remote areas may face a lack of transport to higher levels of care from remote areas [21]. This then results in extended travel times when expediency is most needed to prevent complications to newborn (e.g., asphyxia, perinatal death) and mother (e.g., vaginal fistula, peripartum bleeding) [22]. In countries like Zimbabwe where EMS is growing, this burden can be mitigated by leveraging EMS to transfer pregnant patients between facilities as seen in our study. COHA ambulances being the only government-owned EMS in the city are the main health service transporter of patients to public hospitals. COHA ambulances will pick up patients from any location including government/private clinics or hospitals and deliver all patients to one of two public hospitals in Harare depending on proximity: Parirenyatwa or Harare Hospital. Other LMICs have shown that EMS can transport rural obstetric patients to needed emergency care in under 2 hours, an internationally recommended metric [20]. Our findings demonstrate that COHA is already an active component of the public health infrastructure for obstetric emergencies, further integration with CEmOC centers and expansion of this lifeline to more rural settings are needed.\n\nThe second equally common chief complaint in our study was trauma. Our study demonstrated that the majority of trauma-related EMS calls to COHA were for men (63%) and for the age range 15–49 years (75%). These findings are consistent with previous research on the epidemiology of trauma in LMIC [23]. LMICs account for approximately 90% of all global cases of trauma-associated deaths [24]. Globally, road traffic injuries contribute to the high rate of trauma-related morbidity and mortality in LMICs and have become a sustained development goal target [25,26]. Our study showed a predominance of trauma-related chief complaints at 28% of total chief complaints ( ). This finding suggests a major need for competent trauma specific emergency services. However, across numerous African countries, patients with emergency traumatic conditions are often limited in their ability to directly access higher level hospitals [9,10,14,27]. Similar to maternity patients, a lack of rapid transport is a critical barrier to timely trauma care, and correspondingly, to improving outcomes [24,28]. The availability of prehospital care services has been estimated to lead to a 25% mortality reduction in traumatic injured patients [29]. Further growth and strengthening of EMS in Zimbabwe could alleviate this barrier and help combat the burden experienced from injuries.\n\nThe utilization of EMS transport by COHA is similar to that reported by other EMS systems within the African region [14]. Similar to other systems, we saw that IFTs were more common than field transports and that pregnancy-related and trauma chief complaints were the most common amongst transports. We postulate that opportunities for system strengthening align with Mould-Millman et al. study in Ghana, which advocated for reliable revenue, increased public access, community integration, research, and improved quality assurance processes as a way to continue to develop EMS [27].\n\nTo strengthen EMS and respond to the growing demand for high-quality prehospital care, PCRs can provide a method for EMT assessment and quality improvement. Assessing the PCRs, we found that EMTs in COHA recorded a full set of vitals (pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and mental status) only about half the time (48%). This finding may represent that either the EMT has not assessed all of the patient’s vital signs or that they simply failed to record their findings. An emphasis on improving the EMTs use of PCRs is required, and may be strengthened by adding options to the PCR such as “unable to assess blood pressure”. Additionally, while not present in this study, metrics on call times and transport times could be added to PCRs and would provide important quality improvement targets. COHA has set a goal for increased quality in data recording and strengthening archive methods, both of which will increase the usefulness of PCRs as a backbone for quality improvement for EMS in Harare.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe largest limitation of this study was that few PCRs were available compared to the actual number of transports conducted. As noted above, even though we reviewed all available PCRs in our study period, we estimate this accounts for less than 8% of the total transports conducted during this period. Given the limited information recorded per call in the dispatch logbooks, it is unclear whether the PCRs that are archived are a random sample or may be skewed. Nevertheless, we believe this preliminary descriptive analysis of the available data remains useful and gives insights into the range of chief complaints seen, the types of transports conducted, and the EMTs use of the PCRs. COHA is currently seeking to change its archiving methods.\n\nPCR forms also introduced some limitations during formation of the data collection instrument. About 25% of the PCR were written in free text, making translation into a standardized data collection instrument difficult. However, most of the information in the free text area was recorded elsewhere on the form, minimizing the impact of this weakness. Lastly, absence of previous EMS data in the country did not allow chief complaints to be categorized based on locally contextualized evidence-based groupings, and rather we relied on categorizes outlined by regional patterns [14,30]."
