Thank you for your feedback!\n\nThank you for your feedback!\n\nAbout Creating Mailing Lists\n\nBefore you can send out invitations for your surveys, you need to create mailing lists. Mailing lists are lists of your directory contacts that you can send emails to. You can create mailing lists either through a file upload or manually.\n\nUnlike contacts in the directory, mailing lists are not visible to the entire organization. However, many of the steps described in adding contacts to mailing lists are similar to adding contacts to the directory. Every contact added to a mailing list will automatically be added to the directory.\n\nPrivate list data will only be visible within the list it was added to, and will not be visible within the directory.\n\nQtip: Instead of having to create the lists one at a time, you can also set up automatic list enrollment, which allows you to upload all contacts to your directory at once and have them automatically sort into lists, instead of creating each list one at a time.\n\nQtip: Worried about uploading the same contacts multiple times? Be sure to merge duplicates or set up directory settings to automatically merge duplicates as they’re added to the directory.\n\nWarning: XM Directory can only return 10,000 mailing lists at a time. If you have more than 10,000 mailing lists, you will experience trouble finding them within your account. If possible, avoid having more than 10,000 mailing lists.\n\nProjects That Can Use Mailing Lists\n\nQtip: The features discussed in this section are not necessarily included with every license. If you’re interested in getting access, please reach out to your Account Team.\n\nYou can use XM Directory to build mailing lists and send invitations for several types of Qualtrics projects. However, not every Qualtrics project type is compatible with XM Directory.\n\nXM Directory can be used to send the following:\n\nSurvey projects\n\nConjoint / MaxDiff\n\nCertain non-EX XM Solutions\n\nIn contrast, XM Directory cannot be used to distribute any Employee Experience (EX) projects. That means that no EX projects can be used with XM Directory, including Engagement, Pulse, 360, and more.\n\nXM Directory contact data is completely separate from the employee / participant information saved in the Employee Directory. That means that data edited in one directory will never affect the other.\n\nAvailable Fields\n\nSee available fields listed on the Adding Directory Contacts support page.\n\nPrivate List Data\n\nPrivate list data is embedded data that can be created in specific mailing lists and is only visible to users with access to the list. Benefits of private list data include controlling access to specific attributes, while also avoiding overwriting or editing directory-wide embedded data fields.\n\nPrivate list data can be enabled by Directory Admins in Directory Settings. See Editing Different Directories for instructions.\n\nQtip: Contact info and statistics in lists with private data will not be private and will be shared directory-wide.\n\nQtip: If you did not choose to make list data private when creating a list, this data will always be available directory-wide. Lists with data available directory-wide cannot be made private, and private lists can not be made available directory-wide.\n\nCreating a Mailing List\n\nNavigate to your Directories.\n\nSelect the directory where you’d like to add a list. You may have access to just 1 directory.\n\nGo to the Segments & lists tab.\n\nSelect Lists from the left.\n\nClick Create a list.\n\nName your list.\n\nQtip: List names are not compatible with some special characters (e.g., =, {}, or <>).\n\nCheck the box if you want to Make data in this list private. When selected, data in the list will only be visible to users who have access to the list.\n\nClick Confirm.\n\nOnce inside your contact list, you can choose to upload contacts through a file upload or manually.\n\nUpload a File\n\nClick Upload a File.\n\nIn Excel, create a document with the required fields and save it as a CSV or TSV. Or, click Download a sample template, fill out the appropriate columns, add any desired Embedded Data, and save the file.\n\nWhen the file is ready, click Select a file and select the file from your folder or drag your file into the window.\n\nClick Next.\n\nReview the contact import conditions. Any directory-wide rules for merging duplicate contacts will show up here. These rules are set up in directory settings, and will apply to the contacts in your file.\n\nQtip: Access to the Directory Settings tab requires the Manage Directory permission. Talk to your Brand Administrator if you’re interested in getting access to this setting. This permission is not available in XM Directory Lite.\n\nReview the fields in your file to make sure the information looks right. If a field has not been properly recognized, click on the field name to view a dropdown of options and select the correct field.\n\nQtip: If the data is not formatted correctly in the preview (e.g., bunched up instead of divided into columns), your data may not be separating (or “delimiting”) correctly. To fix this, choose a different Delimiter and/or Enclosure above the Verify Fields section.\n\nClick Upload the file to upload your contacts to the mailing list.\n\nQtip: Excel interprets non-ASCII characters (e.g., 是 or ñ) in a unique fashion that makes them difficult for Qualtrics to upload. If you are importing names with special characters, you might need to save your contact list info to a text-editor application (e.g., Text-edit for Mac, Notepad for PC) before you upload the file into Qualtrics. See the Special Character Issues on our CSV/TSV Upload Issues page for additional instructions. This page is for the Survey Platform, so be careful to navigate back to the XM Directory pages (not the Survey Platform contacts pages) when finished.\n\nCommon Error Messages\n\nFile too large: Your file size exceeds 500 MB, and/or your file has more than 750,000 contacts.\n\nSome fields in your file have too many characters; make sure that the characters in each of these fields are less than or equal to the numbers shown, and try again: Your file has a field or multiple fields that exceed the character limit. Character limits below:\n\nLanguage: 20\n\nFirst name: 100\n\nLast name: 100\n\nEmail address: 254\n\nPhone number: 20\n\nExternal reference: 100\n\nEmbedded data field: 200\n\nEmbedded data value: 1,024\n\nA header name is missing; check the headers in your file, and try again: You may have a column in your CSV file that is missing a header.\n\nThe file contains one or more rows that don’t map to headers; fix this in your file, and try again: There is a mismatch between the number of headers and the number of fields.\n\nDuplicate field: Your file has two fields with the same name. Make sure that each field is unique.\n\nManual Input\n\nSelect Manual Input.\n\nReview the contact import conditions. Any directory-wide rules for merging duplicate contacts will show up here. These rules are set up in directory settings, and will apply to the contacts you enter.\n\nQtip: Directory settings are not available in XM Directory Lite.\n\nFill out the available fields.\n\nClick the plus sign (+) to add an additional column for embedded data. Remember, these can be whatever you want.\n\nClick Next to upload your contacts.\n\nOften, you may find yourself collecting demographic or transactional data, and you’ll want to either update existing mailing list members or create new lists of new contacts based on information given in a survey response.\n\nThe XM Directory task feature, located inside the Workflows tab, can help you set up this process so that mailing lists are automatically created or updated as responses come in.\n\nFAQs\n\n'>\n\nThe XM Directory task allows you to save contact information and transactional data to your XM Directory. It also allows you to distribute a survey to individual recipients or contact lists from your XM Directory. This task is useful for sending follow-up surveys to respondents who’ve entered contact information in your survey as well as updating existing information for contacts already in your XM Directory.\n\nTarget and variance reporting can help you quantify how each level of your organization stacks up to its targets and how these targets vary in comparison to the actual KPIs. To leverage target and variance reporting, you need to:\n\nDirectory options is a dropdown menu that can be found in the upper-right corner of the Directory Contacts tab. It contains many important means of managing your directory contacts, such as the ability to export them, to set up automatic rules for list enrollment, merge duplicates, and manage embedded data.\n\nQuotas allow you to keep track of how many respondents meet a condition in your survey. You can also specify what will happen to your respondents once a quota has been met, such as ending the survey prematurely or deleting the extra responses.\n\nThe mailing list to survey synchronizer is a workflow that serves as a key component of a COVID-19 Response Solution's setup. It ensures that the data collected concerning vaccination status and symptom checks is synchronized on a daily basis, so that dashboards reflect near real-time data.\n\nUsers often wish to integrate their contact records with Qualtrics by uploading files to a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) server, or to an HTTPS file hosting service, so that Qualtrics can regularly import these records to their Qualtrics accounts. Users may wish to import these records as contacts, then schedule survey distributions for those contacts, all under the most safe and secure transfer methods."
