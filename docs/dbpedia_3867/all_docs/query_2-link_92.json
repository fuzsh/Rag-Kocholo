Amending the recently passed California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) 2018, the CPRA imposes even more stringent privacy protection obligations on organizations and greatly increases the rights of consumers. The law applies to businesses and entities located in California or anywhere serving products or services to a California resident which meet one of the following criteria: they have a gross annual revenue of over $25 million in the preceding calendar year, or buy, receive, or sell the personal information of 100,000 or more California residents, households, or devices, or derive 50% or more of their annual revenue from selling or sharing California residents' personal information. The CPRA has become effective since January 1, 2023, and enforcement will begin six months later, on July 1, 2023.\n\nResources:\n\nCPRA Overview\n\nCPPA Overview\n\nCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)\n\nEffective Date: Since January 1, 2020\n\nRegion: NA (North America)\n\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) governs companies and individuals that collect and process consumers’ personal information.

The regulation doesn’t require companies to have a physical presence in California. It applies to all for-profit entities providing their goods and services to California residents which meet threshold criteria.\n\nResources:\n\nCCPA Overview\n\nCCPA Compliance Checklist\n\nVirginia’s Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)\n\nEffective Date: January 1, 2023\n\nRegion: NA (North America)\n\nVirginia became the second state in the United States, after California, to pass a comprehensive data privacy law called Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA).

The proposed draft was to provide an extension to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Act No. XL of 2016) where a legal framework would be established to deal with any matters related to unauthorized access to users’ data. It was proposed to come into effect two years after its promulgation through a notification in the Official Gazette with at least a three-month notice before it eventually came into effect. However, owing to a change in government, there has been no update on the Bill as of 2022.\n\nVirgin Islands, British\n\nBritish Virgin Islands: Data Protection Act, 2021\n\nEffective Date: July 9, 2021\n\nRegion: LATAM (Latin America)\n\nThe Data Protection Act of 2021 came into effect within the British Virgin Islands in July 2021.

It is meant to replace the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan of 25 December 1998 No. 723-I on Advertising. The new law takes several technological advancements made into account such as mobile networks as well as placing several user consent-related obligations upon organizations processing users' data.\n\nLaw on Cybersecurity (No. RK-764)\n\nThe Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan “On Cybersecurity” No. ЗРУ-764 dated April 15, 2022, also known as the Cybersecurity Law came into effect within the country in July 2022.

In this case, the Act was vetoed and sent back to Congress for review but no further action has been taken in order to review the causes for the veto and/or make any amendments for its further approval.\n\nHence, data protection regulation in El Salvador remains disseminated in many other Acts that briefly regulate the confidentiality of a person’s information but no specific regulation is in place for personal data protection till date.\n\nPanama\n\nPanama: Executive Decree No. 285 of 28 May 2021 that regulates Law No. 81 on Personal Data Protection\n\nEffective Date: March 29, 2021\n\nRegion: LATAM (Latin America)\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Law in Panama, Law No. 81, came into full effect in March 2021 and is regulated by the Executive Decree No. 285 of 28 May 2021.
