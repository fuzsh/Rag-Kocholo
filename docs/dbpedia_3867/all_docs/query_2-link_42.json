        "text": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with the Department of State (DOS), has announced the lists of countries whose nationals are eligible to participate in the H-2A and H-2B visa programs in the next year. The notice listing the eligible countries will be published in the Federal Register on Nov. 9, 2023.\n\nEffective Nov. 9, 2023, the secretary of homeland security, with the concurrence of the secretary of state, has decided to:\n\nAdd Bolivia to the list of countries eligible to participate in the H-2A and H-2B programs.\n\nDHS maintains its authority to amend the eligible countries lists at any time through publication of a Federal Register Notice, should DHS and DOS determine that a country fails to meet the requirements for continued designation. Examples of factors that could result in the exclusion of a country or the removal of a country from the list include fraud, abuse, nonimmigrant visa overstay rates, and other forms of noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the H-2 visa programs by nationals of that country that are contrary to U.S. interest.\n\nThe H-2A and H-2B visa programs allow U.S. employers to bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary agricultural and nonagricultural jobs, respectively. Typically, USCIS approves H-2A and H-2B petitions only for nationals of countries that the secretary of homeland security has designated as eligible to participate in the programs. However, USCIS may approve H-2A and H-2B petitions, including those that were pending as of the date of publication of the Federal Register Notice, for nationals of countries not on the lists on a case-by-case basis only if doing so is determined to be in the interest of the United States.\n\nEffective Nov. 9, nationals of the following countries are eligible to receive H-2A and H-2B visas:\n\nAndorraThe Kingdom of EswatiniMadagascarSaint LuciaArgentinaFijiMaltaSan MarinoAustraliaFinlandMauritiusSerbiaAustriaFranceMexicoSingaporeBarbadosGermanyMonacoSlovakiaBelgiumGreeceMongolia*SloveniaBoliviaGrenadaMontenegroSolomon IslandsBosnia and HerzegovinaGuatemalaMozambiqueSouth AfricaBrazilHaitiNauruSouth KoreaBruneiHondurasThe NetherlandsSpainBulgariaHungaryNew ZealandSt. Vincent and the GrenadinesCanadaIcelandNicaraguaSwedenChileIrelandNorth MacedoniaSwitzerlandColombiaIsraelNorwayTaiwan***Costa RicaItalyPanamaThailandCroatiaJamaicaPapua New GuineaTimor-LesteRepublic of CyprusJapanParaguay**TurkeyCzech RepublicKiribatiPeruTuvaluDenmarkLatviaThe Philippines*UkraineDominican RepublicLiechtensteinPolandUnited KingdomEcuadorLithuaniaPortugalUruguayEl SalvadorLuxembourgRomaniaVanuatuEstonia\n\n*Mongolia and the Philippines are eligible to participate in the H-2B program but are not eligible to participate in the H-2A program.\n\n**Paraguay is eligible to participate in the H-2A program but is not eligible to participate in the H-2B program.\n\n***Regarding all references to “country” or “countries” in this document, it should be noted that the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-8, Section 4(b)(1), provides that “[w]henever the laws of the United States refer or relate to foreign countries, nations, states, governments, or similar entities, such terms shall include and such laws shall apply with respect to Taiwan.” 22 U.S.C. § 3303(b)(1). Accordingly, all references to “country” or “countries” in the regulations governing whether nationals of a country are eligible for H-2 program participation, 8 CFR 214.2(h)(5)(i)(F)(1)(i) and 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(i)(E)(1), are read to include Taiwan. This is consistent with the United States’ one-China policy, under which the United States has maintained unofficial relations with Taiwan since 1979.\n\nThis notice does not affect the status of H-2 beneficiaries who currently are in the United States unless they apply to extend their stay in H-2 status on the basis of a petition filed on or after the date of publication of the Federal Register Notice. Similarly, this notice would not affect the eligibility of an H-2 beneficiary to apply for an H-2 visa and/or seek admission to the United States based on an H-2 petition approved prior to the date of publication of the Federal Register Notice. It does apply to nonimmigrants changing status in the United States to H-2A or H-2B. Each country’s designation is valid from Nov. 9, 2023, until Nov. 8, 2024."
