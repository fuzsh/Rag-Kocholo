        "text": "Tools — Assessment Tools\n\nCountries and Regions used in the Red List\n\nIn Red List assessments, the Geographic Range is recorded using the countries of occurrence following the standard names of countries provided and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division and the country names and codes maintained by the International Organization for Standardization ISO-3166-1 country codes standard.\n\nUnless geographically very remote from each other, islands and other territories are included with the parent country. In the case of species that inhabit islands or territories significantly far from the parent country, the island or territory name is provided in parentheses; for example, \"Spain (Canary Islands)\". The naming of such islands or territories follows the second edition of the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (Brummitt et al. 2001) prepared for the Biodiversity Information Standards, also known as the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG).\n\nThe TDWG geographic system also provides a standard set of Basic Recording Units (BRU), which refer to sub-country units based on provinces or states. Although the TDWG system is now out of date for some parts of the world, as there is no suitable alternative system available, the BRU's are used to subdivide very large countries (such as Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa, the Russian Federation, the United States of America, etc.) into smaller, more conveniently sized units for recording distributions. This system has been adopted for use by The IUCN Red List, and the units if recorded appear in parentheses after the parent country. While a number of taxa on the Red List, especially plants, have their distributions recorded down to BRU level, for many taxa, however, subcountry occurrence has not been comprehensively recorded. The main use of the BRU system is to record occurrence on islands or territories far from the parent country. Hence, users should be aware that if they use sub-country units under the Land Regions filter of the Advanced Search options to undertake searches, they will invariably obtain an incomplete list of species. Each country or territory has also been assigned to a single 'Land Region' to enable users to search by larger geographic areas. View the list of Countries by Regions.\n\nGeopolitical events in recent years may have led to some inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided. For example when South Sudan split from Sudan, species occurrence in these two countries had to be reviewed and updated, but errors may have occurred in assigning species to one or both countries. Adherence to the UN and ISO systems also creates some problems, as there is often a time lag between a political change and a new ISO code being allocated to the new country.\n\nReference:\n\nBrummitt, R.K. (with assistance from Pando, F., Hollis, S., Brummitt, N.A. and others) 2001. World Geographic Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions. Plant Taxonomic Database Standards No. 2, Edition 2. International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for Plant Sciences (TDWG). Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Pittsburgh. Available at: http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109.\n\nThe two tables below show which countries or territories, following the ISO-3166 and UN list of countries, are assigned to each geographical region.\n\nTable 1 shows which countries occur within each region and Table 2 is an alphabetical list of all the countries and territories with an indication of which region they have been assigned to. No country or territory is assigned to more than one region; as a result some sub-country units are assigned to geographical regions on the basis of their political governance even though they are physically located in a very different geographic region. For example, Clipperton Island is placed under Europe because it is directly governed by France, even though it is located in the eastern Pacific Ocean, near to Mexico in the Mesoamerica Region. The delimitation of the geographical regions does not follow any particular system.\n\nNote: The designation of geographical entities on this site, and the presentation of the material, do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN or the IUCN Species Survival Commission concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.\n\nTable 1.
