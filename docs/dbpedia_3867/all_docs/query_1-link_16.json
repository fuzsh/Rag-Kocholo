The Park which is an extension of the Matetsi Safari Area was developed to be a refuge for the animals during the hunting season.\n\nThe Baboon Trees\n\nThis is a unique feature of the Park which attracts large volumes of animals. The area has natural water springs and large concentrations of animals. Sightings of up to 2000 buffalo have been reported in the area.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nThe area is virtually an undeveloped and unspoilt wilderness. Reminiscent in parts of the grass plains of East Africa, it is quite unlike any of the more familiar bush or woodlands.\n\nThe Park includes a series of pan depressions, some of which are continuously pumped from boreholes in the dry season. As a result, large concentrations of game seasonally migrate between Botswana and Zimbabwe, especially from September through to the first rains of November or December.\n\nSpecies to be seen include: lion, leopard, giraffe, zebra, gemsbok, roan, sable, tsessebe, eland and reedbuck, whilst elephant and buffalo are present in large numbers when water is scarce. White rhino are also often seen.\n\nA special species endemic to the Kazuma Depression is the oribi, a small antelope, not often seen in other parts of the country. Visitors may also occasionally see cheetah or wild dog while lions are fairly common.\n\nThe pan systems are also ideal habitat to a large variety of water birds, with a number of species including storks, crowned cranes, stilts, cormorants, ducks and kingfishers occurring throughout the area.\n\nSeasons\n\nKazuma Pan National Park is closed to the public in January and February each year due to the wet conditions over this period that make the roads impassable.\n\nFacilities\n\nCamp Sites\n\nThere are two camp sites available in the park. Only two groups of visitors are allowed to camp in the Park at any one time. The camp sites each have bush toilets, braai points and water supplies. Each camp site can comfortably take 10 persons.\n\nThese sites are located in different habitats: Insiza, which overlooks the Kazuma Depression and Kasetsheti, near some natural springs.\n\nAmenities\n\nVisitors should note that Kazuma is an extremely remote area, and adequate provisions for fuel, food supplies and other basics should be provided for.\n\nAttractions & Activities\n\nBird watching\n\nCamping\n\nGame drives\n\nWhy visit Kazuma?\n\nAn ornithologist’s paradise\n\nRemote wilderness with some of Zimbabwe’s most challenging game drive trails\n\nHow to get to Kazuma National Parks\n\nTake the Robins Camp/ Pandamatenga turn-off from the main Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road . proceed for some 25 kilometres along this gravel road to the Parks & Wildlife offices in Matetsi where visitors are required to check-in before proceeding. The journey is continued along the Pandamatenga road for a further 39 kilometres to the border post. These roads are gravel and can be rough. As access to Kazuma is along the Zimbabwe/ Botswana border road, visitors are again asked to check-in with the Zimbabwe Republic Police at Pandamatenga.
