        "text": "The farmer's mother was trapped in another house on the farm. Fearing for her life, Mr Cochrane went to her aid, firing a warning shot as he went.\n\nHe said a violent scene followed.\n\n\"These guys started firing shots at me and I fired shots back because I was outside with this huge mob of people, possibly over 100, all around me.\n\n\"This is absolutely a terrible situation and we can't carry on like this now.\"\n\n\"When the police got there, the three armed men had disappeared,\" said Jenni Williams of farmers' lobby group, Justice for Agriculture (JAG).\n\nTwo of the men were armed with semi-automatic shotguns, while a third had a rifle, she said.\n\nThe government supporters later left the farm with the Cochrane family still there, Reuters news agency reports.\n\nDefiance\n\nOne of Mr Cochrane's neighbours, Alan Parsons said the militants were led by an army major, according to the Associated Press news agency.\n\n\"It seems they are trying to provoke farmers to retaliate with weapons,\" he said.\n\nFarming leaders said that Mr Cochrane was one of the 2,900 white farmers ordered to leave their land by 9 August.\n\nSome complied but others, including Mr Cochrane, are fighting the eviction orders in the courts.\n\nThey argue that they are not legally obliged to leave their farms until their court appeals have been heard.\n\nBut some 300 have been arrested for their defiance, according to Reuters.\n\nFarmer Colin Shand, who has been writing a diary for BBC News Online, is one of those affected."
