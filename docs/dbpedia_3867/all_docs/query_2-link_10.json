        "text": "UN Sanctions\n\nThere are no UN sanctions on Zimbabwe.\n\nEU Sanctions\n\nThe EU introduced sanctions in relation to Zimbabwe in response to the escalation of violence and intimidation of political opponents and the harassment of the independent press in 2002 â€“ an embargo on arms and equipment which might be used for internal repression, travel bans, and asset freezes.\n\nThe designation criteria was expanded in 2008 in response to violence during the Zimbabwean presidential campaign. In response to the progress made in the Zimbabwean constitutional referendum in March 2013, the EU suspended the travel bans and asset freezes applying to the majority of individuals and entities on the sanctions list. An asset freeze against Zimbabwe Defence Industries remains in place.\n\nCurrent EU sanctions are contained in Council Decision 2011/101/CFSP and Council Regulation (EC) No 314/2004.\n\nUK sanctions\n\nThe UK adopted the Zimbabwe (Sanctions) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 in January 2021. They aim to encourage the Government of Zimbabwe, and any person or entity who may be involved in human rights abuses to: (i) respect democratic principles and institutions and the rule of law; (ii) refrain from actions, policies or activities which repress civil society in Zimbabwe; and (iii) comply with international human rights law and respect human rights.\n\nUS Sanctions\n\nThe US revoked its Zimbabwe sanctions regime in March 2024."
