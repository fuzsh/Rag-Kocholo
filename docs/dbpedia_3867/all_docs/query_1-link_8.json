        "text": "Gonarezhou National Park is situated in the south eastern lowveld of Zimbabwe and covers an area in excess of 5 000 square kilometres. “Gonarezhou” meaning “Place of many Elephants” is an extremely scenic Park full of rugged and beautiful landscapes.\n\nAlternative folklore suggests the are was named for the herbalists who would stock their medicines in tusks (known as gona in the Shona language).\n\nThree major rivers – The Save, Runde and Mwenezi – cut their courses through the Park, forming pools and natural oases from which hundreds of species of birds, wildlife and fish gather to feed and drink. As its name implies, Gonarezhou is famous for its elephants, and many of the largest-tusked elephants in the region maybe found within the Park.\n\nThe Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP)\n\nGonarezhou National Park is part of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park (GLTP), a massive Pan-African Park that includes South Africa’s famed Kruger National Park and Mozambique’s Gaza. This huge area is set to become one of the finest “peace parks” in the world and is dedicated to conservation, biodiversity and the economic development of the surrounding local communities. The vast and diverse nature of the mega-park will provide world-class eco-tourism to the visitor and strive to re-establish historical animal migration routes and fragile regional ecosystems.\n\nThe combined Park will include more than 500 species of birds, 147 species of mammals, at least 116 species of reptiles, 34 species of frogs and 49 species of fish.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nLion, leopard, cheetah (including the rare king cheetah), buffalo, giraffe, zebra and many species of large antelope are also present within the Park. The rare nyala and smaller suni are two of the highlights of the Park’s smaller antelopes. In addition, hundreds of species of birds may be spotted in the Park. Unique species of aquatic wildlife such as the Zambezi Shark, Freshwater Goby, Black Bream and the unique turquoise killifish can be seen within the Park’s rivers and pools.\n\nChilojo Cliffs One of the most prominent and enduring natural features of Gonarezhou National Park is the beautiful Chilojo Cliffs. These magnificent red sandstone cliffs have been formed through eons of erosion and overlook the scenic Runde River valley.SeasonsGonarezhou experiences mild, dry winters and warm, wet summers (temperatures in excess of 40 degrees Celcius can occasionally be expected). Mabalauta and Chipinda areas are open throughout the year. During the rainy season (November – April), access to certain parts of the Park is restricted and the visitor should consult with the Park’s offices before undertaking game drives.\n\nBilharzia is endermic to all lowveld rivers and visitors should take appropriate precaution. In addition, malaria can be present within the region so visitors are advised to take prophylactics before, during and after their stay in the Park.\n\nMabalauta\n\nFacilities-Lodges\n\nMabalauta was once a communal area until the 1960s when it became a game reserve. It was later declared a national park in 1975 when it became part of Gonarezhou. The name Mabalauta hails from a hardwood tree species common in the region. The Mabalauta section in the Mwenezi sub-region includes the Swimuwini rest camp, “The place of the Baobabs”. The camp is situated 8 kilometres from the warden’s office and overlooks the the Mwenezi River. There are thatched self-catering accommodation facilities at the camp.\n\nCamp Sites\n\nCamping is possible at Swimuwini at the Mabalauta Camping site which has ablution facilities.\n\nCaravan sites\n\nVisitors with caravans on tow can also camp at Swimuwini and use the same facilities for standard camp sites.\n\nPicnic Sites\n\nThere are several picnic and braai sites located in the Park.\n\nAmenities\n\nVisitors are encouraged to bring in adequate provisions from Mwenezi or from larger business centres since there are no shops in the Park.\n\nChipinda Pools\n\nFacilities\n\nThe name Chipinda is derived from the Ndau dialect meaning “enter”. There are predominantly camping facilities in this section and there are no self-catering accommodation facilities.\n\nCamp Sites\n\nChipinda PoolsThere are 9 sites at the beautiful Chipinda Pools Camp, each with basic shelter, braai area and ablution facilities.Chinguli\n\nThere are 5 camping sites in the Runde sub-region at Chinguli which also have similar facilities to those at Chipinda.\n\nUndeveloped Camping Sites\n\nCamps with minimum facilities are located at Nyahungwe, Madumbini, Bopomela, Lisoda, Gota, Chitove, Chamaluvati and Chilojo. These exclusive sites may be booked by a single party of up to 10 people and there are no attendants available. Visitors need to bring their own water. Dead wood in the vicinity may be collected for firewood.\n\nPicnic Sites\n\nThere are also several picnic and braai points in this section of the Park that include Massasanya and Machaniwa.\n\nAmenities\n\nSupplies must be obtained from Chiredzi town as there are no shops within the Park.\n\nAttractions\n\nGame viewing – best along the riverine regions and close to the many perennial pools and springs. The elephants in this Park are notoriously aggressive so visitors are encouraged to keep a safe viewing distance.\n\nFishing\n\nWalking safaris – permitted in certain areas and at the pools at Samalena Gorge (“the place of killing”) are of major interest\n\nViewing the cliffs at Chilojo, Mwatomba Pool and Makonde Pool\n\nViewing points – these can be found at Guluji and Chamuchanzi among other places\n\nNatural water pans – include the one at Chindhlambai and Tembahata, an exceptional birding place\n\nChibilila Falls – the falls are on the Runde River and are 600 metres wide and 7 meters deep\n\nDuguvi Falls – on the Pambazi River and are very attractive during the rainy season\n\nWhy visit Gonarezhou?\n\nDaytime and full moon walking trails\n\nExcellent bird watching\n\nUnique view of the sunset from the red hills\n\nPanoramic platform views\n\nNumerous viewing points from numerous pools and pans\n\nHow to get to Gonarezhou National Park\n\nVisitors may access the sections of the Gonarezhou National Park as follows:\n\nChipinda Pools (Runde and Save sub-region)\n\nFollow the main tarred road from the Chirediz turn-off to Mutare for 18 kilometres.Turn off to the south at the Chipinda Pools sign post. Follow the gravel road for approximately 34 kilometres to the entrance of the Park, about 59 kilometres from Chiredzi\n\nMabalauta (Mwenezi sub-region)\n\nTurn east off the main Masvingo – Beitbrifge road at the Mwenezi Police Station turn-off, about 20 kilometres south of Rutenga. Proceed down the the dirt road about 3 kilometres and turn left at the entrance to the Police Station – the signboard indicates Mwenezi Ranch HQ and Chikombedzi. Follow this road for about 60 kilometres to Chikombedzi Business Centre. Do not turn off this road. The road you take follows the Mwenezi River southeast from the Mwenezi Police Station to Chikombedzi (the river will not be visible from the road). The only major intersection you will encounter is 20 kilometres from the Mwenezi Police Station and is signposted. Head straight through the intersection to Chikombedzi. Turn right after entering Chikombedzi Business Centre at a 4-way intersection where a National Parks sign indicates the route to Gonarezhou, Mabalauta, Right. About 300 metres down the road another sign indicates the route – turn left. Follow this road around a small dam and DO NOT turn off it. About 6 kilometrees further you will pass Zhou School and 3 kilometres later you will come to Gonarezhou Natioonal Park boundary. The route from there to the Warden’s Office, Mabalauta is clearly signposted. The total distance from the Masvingo – Beitbridge Road to Mabalauta is 105 kilometres.\n\nMatusadona National Park is situated on the shores of Lake Kariba but was proclaimed a non-hunting area on 7 November 1958 before the dam was built.\n\nIt became a Game Reserve in 1963, and in 1975, in terms of the Parks & Wildlife Act, it became a National Park. The Park comprises some 1 400 square kilometers of diverse flora and fauna. Before the lake was built, Matusadonha was a vast, rugged wilderness with limited access.\n\nWith the lake came ecological changes. One in particular, the lakeshore contributed greatly to the increase of large mammal populations in the area, especially elephant and buffalo. The grass found on the shoreline is Panicum repens and is a rejuvenative grass – needing only fluctuating lake levels to replenish its nutrients. With this ready food source, buffalo, waterbuck, zebra, and even impala have thrived and with them the predators. Matusadonha is an Intensive Protection Zone (IPZ) and home to several relocated rhinoceros.\n\nThe Environs of Matusadona\n\nThe southern boundary of the Park is the Omay communal land and the northern boundary is the lakeshore. The eastern side of Sanyati Gorge and the middle of the Ume River provide the east and west boundaries respectively.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nMatusadonha has three distinct ecological areas. First is the lake and shoreline grassland; second, the Zambezi Valley floor, a mass of thick jesse and mopane woodland, and; third, the Escarpment area of Julbernadia and Brachystegia woodlands.\n\nThe Jesse/ Mopani area is sparsely grassed, but provides habitat for browsers, most notably the black rhino. Elephants range throughout the Park, seeking the shade of the Jesse in the heat of the day.\n\nThe Escarpment rises some 700 metres above the Valley floor and is extremely rugged. Over the years, elephant and fire depredations have caused the once substantial woodlands to dwindle, and in parts, grasslands have taken over.\n\nIt became necessary to take control measures to reduce the elephant population to a manageable size\n\n. It also became necessary to carry out early burning programmes in the upper escarpment,\n\nto prevent later, hot fires from raging through and causing serious damage to tree growth.\n\nThe effectiveness of the programmes can now be seen by the tremendous regrowth apparent in the Escarpment area.\n\nAnimal species that are found in abundance include elephant and buffalo. Other common species are those of: night ape, honey badger, civet, small spotted genet, slender mongoose, banded mongoose, spotted hyaena, wild cat, lion, leopard, yellow spotted dassie, black rhinoceros, zebra, warthog, common duiker, grysbok, klipspringer, waterbuck, bushbuck, scrub hare, porcupine, vervet monkey, chacma baboon, side-striped jackal, hippopotamus, roan antelope, kudu and bush squirrel. Some of the more elusive species include: clawless otter, white-tailed mongoose, reedbuck, sable antelope, eland, civet, rusty spotted genet, caracal and bush pig. Animals that are present but only sighted on rare occasions include wild dog, cheetah, roan and pangolin.\n\nFacilities\n\nLodges\n\nCampsites\n\nTashinga Camp\n\nThe Park has a camping site at Tashinga on the lake shore. There is an ablution block with hot and cold water, showers, toilets, wash basins and baths. Firewood and braai facilities are available. Some of the camping sites have sleeping shelters.\n\nSanyati Camp\n\nThere is a smaller camping site at Sanyati consisting of 6 sites, each with a braai stand. There is an ablution block with hot and cold water and laundry trough.\n\nChangachirere Camp\n\nChangachirere Camping Site is an exclusive camping site that caters for one party of a maximum of 10 persons. The facility has a mini-ablution block and shelter.\n\nUndeveloped Bush Camps\n\nThere are also 2 totally undeveloped bush camping sites at Jenje and Kanjedza for up to a maximum of 10 persons per camp. Visitors must be fully equipped and have a four wheel drive vehicle for this section.\n\nExclusive Campsites\n\nUme\n\nSituated close to Tashinga airstrip on the east bank of the Bumi River, 55 kilometres from Kariba by boat.\n\nMuuyu\n\nSituated at Elephant Point, 44 kilometres from Kariba by boat.\n\nMbalabala\n\nAlso situated on the Bumi River upstream around 300 metres beyond Ume Camp.\n\nOther exclusive camp sites can be found at Maronga close to the Chifudzi substation and Kautsiga sited on the escarpment which is ideal for hikers and climbers.\n\nAmenities\n\nThe closest convenience shops are found in Kariba town, therefore, visitors are advised to thoroughly pack for the trip. Petrol, diesel and oil are sometimes available at Bumi Harbour but supplies are not always reliable.\n\nAttractions & Activities\n\nUnbridled adventure in the extreme wild\n\nHiking and escarpment climbing\n\nGame viewing along the lake shoreline from the safety of houseboats\n\nFishing in the rivers and inlets\n\nBird watching in the breathtaking Sanyati Gorge\n\nGame drives\n\nBoating and canoeing safaris\n\nHow To Get To Matusadonha National Park\n\nBy Air\n\nA small, 800 metre landing strip is available at Tashinga Camp and can take small aircraft. The strip is licensed Category II.\n\nBy Boat\n\nVisitors can come in from Bumi Hills located14 kilometres from Tashinga, or 50 kilometres across the Lake from Kariba town.\n\nBy Road\n\nNormally the Park is reached via Karoi, but it can also be accessed from Victoria Falls, via Binga. If traveling from Karoi, 8 kilometres north of Karoi on the Harare-Chirundu Road turn left through the Hurungwe communal land. 115 kilometres from Karoi you cross the Sanyati River. You continue on the Binga Road for a further 62 kilometres and then turn right and continue for 82 kilometrs to Tashinga which is the headquarters of the Park. Except for a short distance of narrow tar, when one leaves the Harare-Chirundu Road, the roads are either gravel or dirt. The last 82 kilometres are rough and not suitable for saloon and low clearance vehicles. It is advisable to enquire about the condition of the road before starting your journey. Game viewing roads are closed during the rainy season.\n\nThe Rhodes Nyanga hotel has been operating since early 1900s and it consists of 24 rooms, bar, restaurant and conference facilities. Historically the hotel has the Rhodes-Nyanga museum with some of the furniture Cecil John Rhodes owned. The hotel is situated in the Nyanga National Park.\n\nProfile of the Nyanga National Park\n\nNyanga National Park is situated in one of the most scenic areas of Zimbabwe’s Eastern Highlands. Rolling green hills and perennial rivers transverse the 47 000 hectare Park. Altitudes between 1 800 and 2 593 meters provide cool weather and fresh mountain air, perfect for rest and relaxation. With its stunning mountainous views, numerous waterfalls, varied activities and unique flora and fauna, Nyanga National Park can provide the visitor with an unforgettable holiday experience.

Follow this road for 85 km to the end and turn right towards Nyanga village and then right at the main park entrance.\n\nThe Vumba Botanical Gardens and Reserve, located 32 kilometres from Mutare, are established on a portion of the farm formerly known as “Manchester”.\n\nThe nucleus of the combined area was bought by Government from Mr. F.J. Taylor in 1957 and was proclaimed a National Park in 1958. In 1960, the name of the Gardens was changed to Vumba National Park and again in 1975 to the present Vumba Botanical Garden.\n\nManchester Farm, situated in the Vumba Mountains, was initially bought in 1926 by the late Mr. F.J. Taylor, a Mutare businessman who at one time was the Mayor of Umtali (now Mutare). He developed it as a weekend proposition and his wife started a garden by removing the raw bush, but preserving the indigenous trees. In 1940, shortly before he retired from business, Mr. Taylor built a dam on the farm. Mrs. Taylor soon converted it to cover about 1.5 hectares. Friends and casual visitors enthused over the Taylor’s garden and persuaded them to open it to the public.\n\nKnown as Manchester Park then, the Gardens became a tourist attraction and were visited by many thousands during and after World War II. Today several thousand people visit the Gardens annually from every corner of the globe.\n\nOn Mrs. Taylor’s death in 1954, her husband continued maintaining the Gardens although he had been crippled with arthritis. With the passage of time, he realised that the task was beyond him and he therefore agreed to sell 201 ha of Manchester Park, the remnant of the original Manchester Farm, to the Government. Of the 201 hectares, 42 hectares have been declared a Botanical Reserve and the other 159 hectares a Botanical Garden.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nThe well-wooded Park includes 159 hectares of landscaped gardens built around perennial streams which form a small lake. Sheltered walks between indigenous fern trees lead to displays of banked hydrangeas, proteas and azaleas, begonias, lilies, aloes, fuchsias, cycads and many other species.\n\nA network of footpaths that enable visitors to explore the interior of the Botanical Reserve has been opened. The Reserve is well endowed with indigenous orchids and ferns. In the Botanical Garden there are sheltered walks between the stately indigenous tree ferns and azaleas. Strategically positioned flower beds are encountered as one leisurely takes stock of the Gardens. A superb collection of both the winter/spring and summer flowering varieties has been assembled for the visitors’ enjoyment throughout the year. To complement the annuals, an herb garden, some roses, proteas, fuchsias, cycads, tea bushes, aloes, camellia, and palm sections have been set up.\n\nThe birdlife around the Garden and in the Reserve attracts a number of visitors. Several species of birds can be recorded whilst strolling along the many footpaths. Also found in large numbers is the Samango monkey which is endemic to the Eastern Highlands.\n\nFacilities\n\nLodges\n\nThe self-catering lodges in the Garden are very popular with visitors to the area.\n\nCamp site\n\nA camp site with ablution blocks with hot and cold water systems is available in the Garden.\n\nCaravan Sites\n\nThe caravan sites with beautiful panoramic views and electric power points also have water borne sanitation.\n\nTea Room\n\nA tea room offering refreshments is found in the middle of the Gardens. The shop is open daily weather permitting. Light meals can also be provided on request including cakes and vegetarian dishes.\n\nSwimming Pool\n\nThe swimming pool is located by the camping site.\n\nAmenities\n\nAt nearby hotels, a number of activities can also be carried out. Provisions can be found from the nearby shops or hotels in the vicinity. The Leopard Rock, one of Zimbabwe’s finest hotels provides riding, golfing, tennis and other holiday activities.\n\nAttractions & Activities\n\nWalking among the lush gardens\n\nBird watching\n\nWhy Vist Vumba?\n\nEnjoying the scenic mountain surroundings\n\nA refreshing atmosphere\n\nHow to get to Vumba Botanical & Reserve\n\nThe road winds up through steep mountains, heavily clothed with Msasa trees, which present a brilliant tapestry of reds, yellows and rich olive greens in the Zimbabwean spring. The road from Mutare is tarred as far as Cloudlands, 17,7 kilometres from Mutare. At Cloudlands, you turn right on to a gravel road then travel for about 15 kilometres to the Park.\n\nLake Kariba is among the 4 largest man-made lakes in the world and the second largest in Africa. The shoreline is over 2 000 kilometres long. Kariba is home to numerous species of flora and fauna and is an exciting and unique safari destination.\n\nThe Matusadonha National Park is located on the shores of Lake Kariba and several fine lodges and resorts are located here.\n\nKariba Recreational Park is based around the Zambezi River, which was initially dammed so as to build a hydroelectricity generation utility for the benefit of both Zimbabwe and Zambia. The dam wall with 6 flood gates was built between 1955 and 1959 and is 128 metres high and 617 metres wide. The lake is 282 kilometres long at full level and 32 kilometres across at it’s widest point, 116 metres deep and covers an area of 5 180 square kilometres of what once was the Gwembe trough. The weight of the water totals 177 million tons and were all 6 flood gates opened, over 91 500 cubic metres (300 000 cubic feet) of water would surge into the river below each second! 86 men perished during construction of the dam and a church has since been constructed as a memorial to them. The dam wall was designed by Andre Coyne, a Frenchman, and built by a constructor called Impresit from Italy.\n\nThere are many stories that are put forward to explain the name Kariba. Some elders in the area note that close to the dam wall lies a rock that resembles a traditional stone trap, riva, hence Kariva, later mispronounced by the Europeans as Kariba. The other version is that the rock was named “Kariva” due to the fact that when the river flooded, the Rock trapped water thereby making it difficult for the locals who often crossed the river to return to either side of the Zambezi.\n\nOperation Noah\n\nThis is one of the great acts of mankind giving back to nature. When the 2 sluice gates that were used to dam the Zambezi River were closed, the water started rising. Within 24 hours the level had gone up by 6 metres and by September 1959 it had risen by 60 metres. Alarm bells started ringing when it was realised that the dam was creating numerous islands and even submerging some pieces of land thereby threatening the resident animal population that had largely been left behind in the Gwembe Trough even as the local tribes were being forcibly resettled.\n\nA concerted drive was made by the National Parks and Government to rescue the animals from the fast submerging islands. By the end of the operation the Zimbabwean team (then Southern Rhodesia) had rescued nearly 5 000 animals while the Zambian team (then Northern Rhodesia) had rescued about 2 000.\n\nThe operation attracted a lot of international attention and it received international publicity and significant material aid from as far afield as the USA and the UK.\n\nNyaminyami\n\nThe Nyaminyami River God is a major force in the society around the Zambezi Valley. The River God is believed to have supernatural powers. The Nyaminyami is believed to be a dragon-like amphibious being with the head of a fish and a snake’s torso. It was believed that the Nyaminyami would occasionally offer charitable appearances and pause for the local villagers to slice pieces of meat from its back before returning to the water.\n\nFolklore has it that the Nyaminyami used to live upstream with his wife but when the dam wall was constructed it separated the two. This infuriated the River God, and as he forced his way back upstream, he was responsible for the collapse of part of the dam wall that killed 86 workmen midway through the project.\n\nThe locals and tourists of Kariba look forward to September each year as the Nyaminyami Festivals are held to venerate the River God.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nAdapting to the initial flooding and annual fluctuation has caused several changes in the local animal population around the shores of the lake. The shoreline is a rich grazing area for many species, which has in turn attracted the predatory animals that hunt these species.The lake is renowned for its tigerfish but it is also home to over 40 fish species that include nkupe, chessa, bottlenose, vundu, barbell and several types of bream.\n\nSeasons\n\nThe area generally has hot summers averaging 38 degrees Celsius and an average rainfall of 660 millimetres. The winters are usually warm with an average temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.\n\nFacilities\n\nA slipway has been provided for visitors to Nyanyana to launch their boats, but when the level of the lake is very low the slipway cannot be used.\n\nLodges\n\nThe lodges at Nyanyana Camp are fully equipped self catering facilities. These lodges are situated at the mouth of the Nyanyana River on the Lake Kariba shore. During the night hippopotamus can often be heard grazing around the lodge area.\n\nCamp Sites\n\nThere are 20 camping sites available within 100 metres of the lake shore.
