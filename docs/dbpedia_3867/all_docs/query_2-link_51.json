        "text": "How to Get a Cold Call List?\n\nA cold call list is nothing more than a list of people you are going to cold call, with their contact details and extra relevant information if necessary.\n\nSome providers offer pre-made cold calling lists for sale. But if you're tired of hit-or-miss cold call lists, build custom lists through a B2B platform like Cognism Prospector. It has a global B2B database, including mobile numbers, direct dials, and email addresses.\n\nReps can run searches and filter down results depending on who you want to call (e.g., include or exclude job titles, seniority, departments, etc.). Thereâ€™s no need to worry about data compliance because Cognism B2B cold calling data is CCPA and GDPR-compliant.\n\nTake our platform for a spin and see how you can build a targeted cold-calling list in seconds. ðŸ‘‡\n\nWhat are the steps for building cold call lists?\n\nThe most effective cold call lists are full of the names of people with a problem your product can solve. These people are more likely to be receptive to what you have to say.\n\nAs a result, your list doesnâ€™t have to be long, but it has to be targeted and include good-fit prospects.\n\nDeveloping your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) is a great place to start. When you have a clear picture of the kind of person you want to target, itâ€™s much easier to go out and find them. Hereâ€™s how you develop your ICP:\n\nAnalyze your existing customer base and look for common features between your highest-spending users.\n\nLook at the industries they operate in. Consider company size, locations, job titles. If you excel at selling to one category of company, you can find others that fit into that category.\n\nTalk to your best customers about the challenges they face and how your product helps to resolve them.\n\nOnce you have a picture of your dream customer, you can start to search for others just like them in B2B databases.\n\nWhat data should a good cold call list include?\n\nHow much data will be on your cold calling list is up to you, but the minimum information you need is:\n\nName.\n\nJob Title.\n\nCompany.\n\nPhone number (cell phone numbers are better than direct dials).\n\nItâ€™s often helpful to have their email address and LinkedIn details as well to develop a winning sales cadence.\n\nThe more you know about your lead before you call them, the more likely youâ€™ll make a connection. Youâ€™ll find it easier to address what you say to the prospectâ€™s situation. You can enrich your cold calling list with additional data points, like:\n\nBuying intent signals.\n\nSales events triggers.\n\nTechnographic data.\n\nThanks to intent data, you can gauge the level of prospectâ€™s interest in what youâ€™re selling and their companyâ€™s need for it. Itâ€™s beneficial if youâ€™re running account-based marketing campaigns. Intent data providers can capture prospectsâ€™ web searches and the content they consume to indicate their level of interest in a product or service.\n\nSales triggers help you prioritize contacts on your list. For example, if the prospect has just been promoted, they may want to make a mark with a new purchase. Another useful sales trigger is if the company has just received a new round of funding; this shows that they have an influx of new budgets available and may be looking to spend."
