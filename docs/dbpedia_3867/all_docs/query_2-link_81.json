        "text": "The latest amendments to the FATF lists came into force on 28 June 2024.\n\nMonaco and Venezuela were added to the lists. Jamaica and Turkey were removed.\n\nThe high-risk third countries are:\n\nBulgaria\n\nBurkina Faso\n\nCameroon\n\nCroatia\n\nDemocratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)*\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\n\nHaiti\n\nIran*\n\nKenya\n\nMali*\n\nMonaco\n\nMozambique\n\nMyanmar*\n\nNamibia\n\nNigeria\n\nPhilippines\n\nSenegal\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Sudan*\n\nSyria* **\n\nTanzania\n\nVenezuela\n\nVietnam\n\nYemen* **\n\n*These jurisdictions are subject to financial sanctions measures, which require firms to take additional measures.\n\n**The FATF was unable to conduct an onsite visit due to security issues.\n\nFrom 22 January 2024, HM Treasury amended the definition of 'high-risk third countries. It removed Schedule 3ZA, which contained the list in the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.\n\nInstead of referring to a separate schedule, regulation 33(3)(a) now defines a high-risk third country as:\n\n\"a country named on either of the following lists published by the Financial Action Task Force as they have effect from time to time\n\nhigh-risk jurisdictions subject to a call for action\n\njurisdictions under increased monitoring\"\n\nThese lists are updated three times a year, on the final day of each FATF plenary meeting, held every February, June and October.\n\nSee the lists on the FATF website\n\nThe dates of these meetings are published several months in advance in the FATF event calendar.\n\nAll countries included in FATF's lists have significant shortcomings in their AML, counter-terrorist financing and counter-proliferation financing controls.\n\nHM Treasury also published an updated advisory notice on high-risk third countries.\n\nThe next update to the list is expected on 25 October 2024.\n\nBackground\n\nUnder the UKâ€™s AML regime (regulation 33(1)(b)), any business relationship with a person established in a high-risk third country must be subject to enhanced due diligence (EDD).\n\nUntil the end of the Brexit transition period, the list of high-risk countries was determined by the European Union (EU).\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, the UK has had its own standalone list. Since then, any amendments to the EU list do not have effect in the UK.\n\nThe UK is entitled to amend its own list of high-risk countries under section 49 of the Sanctions and Anti Money Laundering Act 2018.\n\nThe aim remains tackling strategic deficiencies in the identified countries with regards to their national AML and counter-financing of terrorism regimes.\n\nYou must apply EDD measures in any transaction or business relationship with a person established in a high-risk third country.\n\nFor more guidance on appropriate EDD measures, see our guide to customer due diligence and the anti-money laundering guidance for the legal sector.\n\nPrevious amendments\n\nView the EC's original list of high-risk third countries (July 2016)\n\nThe list was later amended in four delegate regulations:\n\nOctober 2017\n\nDecember 2017\n\nJuly 2018\n\nMay 2020\n\nSince the end of the Brexit transition period, the list has been amended in:"
