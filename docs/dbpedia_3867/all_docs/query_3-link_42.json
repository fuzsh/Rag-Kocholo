Edgar f. and sworn to before me. This 30th Day april 1913. S Louis p. Deusner. Notary Public. My commission expires feb. 24, 1914. My. Bosses die hard governor Sulzer is making a Gallant fight to Force the new York legislature to enact a direct primary Bill in compliance with the platform upon which the majority was elected. Through the Connivance Murphy and other Boss leaders the direct primary Bill was killed and with the calling a special session that Issue Between tammany and Sulzer is sharply drawn. Popular opinion is with the governor but Murphy is not responsive to Public sentiment and the Success the governor depends upon legislators who have thus far obeyed Murphy. Governor Hughes attempted to secure primary legislation and failed but his efforts advanced the movement wonderfully. Sulzer May fail but direct primaries Are coming As surely direct election senators. The Indiana legislature also refused to pass a direct primary Law but even its opponents grudgingly concede that primary Reform is merely delayed for a time. The Indiana legislature Aenied the sentiment for a Bill providing for business form government Dayton will try commission plan democratic opposition fails to Block Gem City a demand for new charter. By associated pres Dayton o., May 21.�?i\\t a special election a commission was elected to write a City charter calling for a com to Mission management form government. The fifteen chosen were chosen by a non partisan citizens committee and were opposed by to democrats. Twenty thousand votes were Cace. The citizens ticket was headed by John h. Paterson recently convicted violation the Sherman anti Trust Law and was fined $5, Khz and sentenced to a year in jail. Or. Patterson selection today was almost unanimous. The new commission will w rite a charter calling for the election five commissioners from the City at Large and these in turn will appoint an expert in City management to conduct the business the City. Only one other City in the country Sumter s. �,., has the commission form government which differs considerably from the straight commission form that has been adopted by 300 american cities. Woodrow Wilson. 5�?T.? i in cities but the business form gov 24�?.-- 6,391_____ /. A a 25____ 6,418 1 26 a. 6,381 Ern ment is not dead. On the contrary this Reform is gaining strength and the legislature two years hence will assuredly be forced to take favourable action. Obstinate and unscrupulous leaders May prevail for a time. In the end they gracefully acquiesce to reforms Are eliminated from lawmaking deliberations entirely. Contributed Gall for primaries a wasteful policy while the City is installing a filtration Plant the we Ork will be incomplete until meters Are added. To spend a Large sum Money for a filter Plant and then permit Consumers to use a Nuch Little at a Fiat rate is decidedly a Businesslike and will soon overload the Plant. There is no More reason in furnishing water at a Flat rate than electric current. If Light Consumers were using current at a Fiat rate their lights and motors a would be at work constantly and a Frant twice the size the present one would be inadequate. Logansport pumps almost As much water daily As South Bend a City nearly three times As Large. If we Art to have filtered water there should be some restraint imposed Iii its use. It is manifestly unfair for an economical consumer to Fay As much As a wasteful neighbor who uses three four times the Quantity. A privately owned water works would not provide service a Fiat rate basis.

The Progress cd the Smy to ballot movement. One the earlier articles in this series told How quickly the people caught up with Woodrow Wilson a doctrine that real democracy in America is just a question getting simple and workable instruments. Of course the really difficult task is to get this idea enacted into Laws. This phase the movement is retarded by two great obstructions cast Iron state constitutions and those politicians who Are quite contented with the present arrangements. The lightning struck first in California where the bipartisan Railroad machine had just been overthrown. In 1911 the progressive members both parties who were now in control looked around for the Best Means making the results the election 1910 permanent that is keeping the existing machine out politics and forestalling any similar organization. The leaders at once took tip the Short ballot idea and made it the first specific Plank in their platform. Governor Johnson emphasized it in his message and put his influence behind several legislative Short ballot measures. Four these were passed without great difficulty. Three these respectively removed from the ballot the state Printer the clerk the supreme court and the members the Railroad commission. This latter Board had been made elective years before so that the people could control it. Result a the commissioners were hidden away among forty to fifty other officers the ballot and for a generation devoted themselves exclusively to the neglect their duties and the drawing their salaries. The fourth these California measures gave the people Power to apply the Short ballot principle in the counties by adopting local Charters suited to their local needs. Within less than a year under this new right the county los Angeles adopted an instrument under a Titch there were Cut off at a stroke thirteen these Petty clerical offices which had been the Centre so much ill directed party activity and inefficiency. It was provided that in future they should be appointed the basis Merit and not for party service. The county supervisors were Given real control Over the machinery organization just As in the commission plan cities. Another state which has made Progress toward the Short ballot is Ohio. In preparation for the constitutional convention which met in that state last year the municipal association Cleveland prepared a most careful analysis the state government and proposed a measure which would remove from the state ticket the minor executives including the Secretary state treasurer auditor attorney general and Dairy and food commissioner. The favourable Way in which the measure was received led its friends to suppose that it would be submitted to the people along with the forty other progressive proposals. When however it was brought to a vote it was found that forty seven the one Hundred and Twenty delegates were opposed to submitting this proposition to the people. Their cry was a it will give the governor too much they were not opposed to giving exactly the tame amount Power to the irresponsible party a a Bossy who had actually made the appointments to minor state offices under the Long ballot system the defeat the measure disappointed the people and last fall All three political parties in Obi went record in favor the Short ballot in their platforms.
