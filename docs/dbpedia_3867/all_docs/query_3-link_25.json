        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nHAV is a non-enveloped, RNA-containing virus that belongs to the family Picornaviridae. It is a spherical 27-nm particle that was discovered by Feinstone in 1973[3]. The routes of infection are orofecal and percutaneous. The incubation period is about 28 d. The fecal shedding of virus is at a maximum during the late incubation period, just before or shortly after the onset of symptoms[4].\n\nAfter oral inoculation of a chimpanzee with HAV, the viral antigen was detected first in the serum on day 14, in the tonsils on day 16 and in the liver on day 21. The viremia lasts for 2 wk[5]. In human studies, HAV RNA is detected for an average of 60 d after onset of clinical symptoms[6]. Risk factors that have been associated with reported HAV infection within the United States include sexual or household contact with another person with hepatitis (25%), contact with children attending a day-care center (15%), international travel (5%) and food or water-borne outbreak (5%). However, in 50% of cases, no risk factor can be identified[7].\n\nIn Kuwait, the epidemiology of HAV in the 1980s was similar to developing countries with almost 100% of adults over the age of 20 years testing positive for anti-HAV. At that time, 90% of the screened cases with acute hepatitis A were below the age of 10 years and 70% below the age of 5 years[2]. Retrospective analysis of all charts of Kuwaiti patients presenting with acute HAV infectious between the ages of 0 and 15 years admitted to an infection disease hospital between 2000 and 2002 showed an incidence of 47 per 100 000. One third of these cases were from Jahra region, which is dominated by the Bedouin who live in large extended families. However, in 50% of these cases, there was no identified risk factor. Prolonged jaundice was found in 3% of cases and FHF in 0.4%[8].\n\nThere has been a dramatic drop in the incidence of HAV infection in children (47/100 000 vs 122/100 000) and a shift toward infection among older children (from 0-4 years to 7-12 years). Our study provides the most recent data about the prevalence of HAV in Kuwait over the last 20 years. The prevalence of HAV was 28% and one quarter of screened individuals below the age of 27 years had positive anti HAV. There were more cases in the areas dominated by Bedouin with extended families. Also, there were more cases among the group with uneducated parents, which reflects the relationship of the disease to low social background. These data show the shifting epidemiology of HAV in Kuwait toward intermediate to low endemicity, leaving 75% of the population below the age of 27 years non-immune, with a risk of exposure to HAV infection at a later age group, with increased morbidity. These changes have resulted from improvement in living standards and socio-economic progress. These data demonstrate the requirement of initiating an HAV vaccine program in Kuwait.\n\nAreas in the Middle East like Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia show a shifting pattern from high to intermediate endemicity for HAV. In Saudi Arabia, there are existing pockets of high HAV endemicity that may lead to outbreaks[9]. A study by Fathalla et al[10] showed that eastern Saudi Arabia still belongs to epidemiological pattern 1, which is characteristic of developing poor countries with low socioeconomic status and the country has a seroprevalence of 99%. The United Arab Emirates data showed that the seroprevalence of HAV was 60% and 90% for the ages of 16 and 40 years respectively which indicates a shift of HAV epidemic with infection towards an adult population[11]. In South-East Asia and China, there is shifting epidemiology of HAV from high to moderate or low endemicity. In China, this is associated with risk of outbreaks as a result of re-introduction of the virus from areas of high endemicity to low endemicity within a non-immune population[12] The incidence of HAV infection varies from high, moderate, low and very low endemicity areas. South-East Asia, India, Africa and Latin America were considered high endemic areas. The epidemiology of HAV is changing due to improvement in water supplies and sanitation conditions. Asian studies from Taiwan and India also show changing seroepidemiology of HAV infection and these countries are considering the use of HAV vaccine. The prevalence of HAV antibodies in Taiwan decreased in 1998 compared to 1992 reflecting the improvement of socioeconomic status and modernization of sanitation[13,14]. Africa is still considered as an area with high endemicity for HAV[9]. In Latin America, the highest anti-HAV seroprevalence rates were found in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. In these countries over the last 15 years, there was a shift towards medium endemicity with the peak of infection occurring in later childhood and adolescence rather than in early childhood. Contaminated water and food supply were the strongest risk factors in Latin America[15].\n\nIn European industrialized countries like Italy, there is a markedly lower prevalence of HAV infection, especially among a younger age group, due to marked improvements in socioeconomic conditions and hygienic standards. In the same region, small outbreaks of HAV infection were associated with intravenous drug abusers travelling to endemic areas, shellfish consumption and with an increasing number of family members[16].\n\nPatients with negative serology for HAV need HAV vaccine. Also, patients with chronic liver disease who are non-immune to HAV need HAV vaccine[17]. In our study, 2035 (71%) of cases were not immune to HAV, 4.8% of them had positive HBsAg serology, while 1.5% of them had positive anti-HCV serology."
