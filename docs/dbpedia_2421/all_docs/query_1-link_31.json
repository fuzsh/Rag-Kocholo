        "text": "Saint John Bosco\n\nSaint John Bosco , popularly known as Don Bosco (Italian for Father Bosco) was born at Becchi, in Piedmont, Italy on August 16, 1815. From a very young age, he had decided that he had been called to work for the poor boys of that era when Europe was under the grip of the Industrial Revolution, and many young people who came to the cities to study or in search of work fell an easy prey to the many social evils of the time.\n\nAfter being ordained a priest of the Catholic Church in 1841, Don Bosco came to the rescue of these poor boys with his novel method of educating youth through total dedication and personal involvement in their lives and problems."
