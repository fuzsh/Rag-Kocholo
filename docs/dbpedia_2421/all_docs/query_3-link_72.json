        "text": "The preliminary inventory of plants which was carried out in University of Uyo main campus using the transect method to sample the area gave rise to 7 sampling units and resulted in the collection and identification of 76 species of plants in 33 families. The most frequent plant species in the area of study were members of the family Papilionaceae (30%), followed by members of the family Euphorbiaceae (26%) and members of the family Asteraceae (23%). Species of Combretum were found in all the sampling units except Combretum racemosum which was found in only one sampling unit. The result provided a medium for grouping the plants into 5 classes’ based on their abundance. The classes were as follows: rare (17 plants), occasional (34 plants), frequent (21 plants), abundant (3 plants) and very abundant (1 plant). Generally, the vegetation in the area of study is under threat due to massive infrastructural development embarked upon by the university to enable different faculties and units...\n\nThe present study was aimed at determining the plant species richness of the Akshara Vidyalaya (AV) campus, Nellore District. For this, the species richness data was obtained by intensive surveys in the campus from 2015–2017. We recorded 247 species in 194 genera belonging to 69 families composed of 52 trees, 55 shrubs and 140 herbs, two species are parasites. Poaceae (20 genera 24 species), Fabaceae (15 genera 21 species) are the two species richness families and an inventory checklist of all the species recorded is provided. This study reveals that AV campus is diverse and rich in ornamental/alien flora.\n\nThe naturally occurring vascular flora of the main campus of Banaras Hindu University spreading over an area of 1,300 acres was analyzed. A total of 329 vascular plant species were reported in the campus of which only 5 were Pteridophytes and the remaining 324 species were Angiosperms. No natural occurrence of gymnosperms was reported from the University Campus. Angiosperms were represented by 76 families of which the Asteraceae, Poaceae and Fabaceae are the dominant families of the flora of Banaras Hindu University.\n\nThis paper deals with the present floral diversity of Jai Narain Vyas University, the New campus, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. The total area of the New campus is 263.31 hectares; 650.7 in acres and the constructed area is approximately 74,003 m2; 796,560 in sq. ft, thus a huge land is free from any kind of constriction of buildings that provide inhabit for many wild plant species. As biodiversity is the variety of life on the earth or in a particular habitat. The data conferred here are carried with botanical name, family, and some observed characters of them. Here in this paper 131 plant species are described from the respective study area. The study focussed on wild Angiosperms but a piece of additional information on cultivated and decorative plants is also given briefly. The information included in the study can be of use to many people along with the students of the university.\n\nAngiospermic flora of Ghagotia Union representing Magnoliopsida (Dicots) and Liliopsida (Monocots) have been inventoried after survey during the years of 2004 and 2005. A total of 187 species have been recorded from the area. These have been assigned to 65 families and 160 genera. Magnoliopsida is represented by 50 families, 113 genera and 133 species, whereas Liliopsida is represented by 15 families, 47 genera and 54 species. Key words: Preliminary checklist, Angiospermic flora, Ghagotia Union, Gazipur, Bangladesh DOI: 10.3329/bjpt.v13i2.586 Bangladesh J. Plant Taxon. 13(2): 155-170, 2006 (December)\n\nThis study represents comprehensive taxonomic information on current floristic composition in the semi-natural campus area of Jahangirnagar University. This study reveals that this campus area harbours a total of 917 species belonging to 574 genera and 145 families of vascular plants. 70.34% of these species are wild and the rest are cultivated/planted. 63.79% of the species are native and 36.21% are exotic to Bangladesh. Pteridophytes and Gymnosperms are represented by 22 and 12 species, respectively, whereas, Angiosperms by 883 species. Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons) and Liliopsida (monocotyledons) are composed of 618 and 265 species, respectively. The family Poaceae with 89 species is the largest, which is followed by Fabaceae with 44 species and Asteraceae with 40 species. Most of the species are herbs (56.16%) and growing in diverse habitats. All species are economically or ecologically important, but mostly as medicinal, ornamental, fodder and forage, fruit, vegetable, timber an...\n\nA taxonomic survey was performed to assess diversity of plant resources at Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University (SAU) campus, Dhaka, Bangladesh during August 2011 to October 2012. A total of 8536 (including seasonal) species were recorded in SAU. Plants were represented by trees (11.0 %), shrubs (21.6 %), herbs (61.6 %), climbers (4.0 %) and woody grasses (1.8%). The total number of plants belongs to 257 species under 215 genera and 135 families among these 126, 46, 17, 15, 29, 10 and 14 plant species were existed under 112, 34, 12, 12, 27, 7 and 11 genera also under 57, 25, 8, 9, 25, 7 and 4 family in terms of ornamental, fruit, vegetables, spices, medicinal, timber and plantation crop respectively."
