Tezpur is a tourist paradise but in last two decade higher rate of population growth, increasing rate of rural to urban migration accelerate the process of urbanization and generation of quantum of solid wastes. Generation of large quantum of wastes and inefficient management system is not only changing the urban scenario of this beautiful town but also responsible for degradation of environment and threat to public health. The present research aims to study the existing waste management system in Tezpur municipal area to face the future challenges.\n\nThe state of solid waste management in most of the urban areas of developing countries is now a major social and environmental challenge with the explosion of Population and the pace urbanization.

In India in particular, the combined influence of poverty, population growth and rapid urbanization has tended to worsen the situation. In response to the waste challenge many developed countries have embarked upon ambitious environmental reforms, recording remarkable advances in best practices and sustainable management of MSW. However, like many developing countries, India has faced many problems to manage the MSW in a sustainable manner. The study aims to carry out an analysis on the waste management practices and to develop a integrated waste management model for Tezpur municipal area and for the similar environment."
