        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the State Government would extend all necessary support if appropriate proposal in this direction is submitted to the Government.\n\nAssam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma urged the Gauhati University to lead a start-up and innovation movement in the state and assured to extend all necessary support if the appropriate proposal in this direction is submitted to the Government.\n\nThe Chief Minister said this while taking part as the chief guest at the 75th foundation day programme of the University and the inaugural function of the platinum jubilee celebrations held at BKB auditorium of the university today.\n\nSarma said, “Gauhati University is a sacred temple of higher learning. This university was born out of the committed endeavours of Assamese people in the pursuit of higher education. Even though many new institutions of higher learning have come up in the state, this university still stands tall.”\n\nSarma said that Gauhati University is the heart of educational renaissance in the North East India. Unlike other institutions of higher learning, this university has many unique features. This university came into existence as a result of the endless sacrifices and long movement of a large number of dedicated personalities. He said that the university has a remarkable history of creating rich human resources.\n\nHighlighting the history behind the establishment of Gauhati University, the Chief Minister said that the movement for the establishment of a university in Assam was started in the year 1917. This university came into existence due to sacrifices and untiring efforts of personalities like Satyanath Bora, Ghanashyam Baruah, Nabin Chandra Bordoloi, Gopinath Bordoloi, Raghunath Chaudhury, Tarun Ram Phookan, Krishna Kanta Handique, Sarat Chandra Goswami etc contributions of the people and co-operation of the state government. The University was established by the Gauhati University Act of 1947 enacted by the government headed by Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi, the first Chief Minister of Assam. Referring to the University Court meeting held for the first time on January 26, 1948 at Sudmerson Hall of Cotton College, the Chief Minister said that this day marked the beginning of a new era in the educational history of the region by becoming the first university in North East India. It is a matter of pride for all of us that Gauhati University is entering its platinum jubilee year in this 75th year of celebrating the Amrit Mahotsav of country's independence, the Chief Minister said.\n\nStating that this is the right time for the university to lead a start-up and innovation movement in the state, he said that there is never a shortage of capital in the state exchequer for innovation and innovative works.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the State Government would extend all necessary support if appropriate proposal in this direction is submitted to the Government.\n\nSarma said that the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom is a fundamental tenet of Indian civilization. Today, Indian civilization has reached a full-fledged stage of excellence through a relentless journey of knowledge and wisdom, advancing along the path shown by Takshashila and Nalanda.\n\nThe Chief Minister said that the creation of teachers or bureaucrats alone could not be the objective of the university. The purpose of education should be to change the thinking and mentality of the students.\n\nCommenting on the significance of the new education policy adopted by the country today, he said that its main objective would be achieved only if the underlying significance of the national education policy could be put into practice. The Chief Minister also said that Gauhati University should take the lead in implementing this education policy in the state.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nPorts to power, what companies facing insolvency mean for Adani Group\n\nA list of 20 large-cap stocks where you have lost money big time.\n\nAre Yamaha dealer IPO investors and Sir Isaac Newton on the same page?\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\nFour ingredients that helped Mahindra Thar leave Maruti Jimny and Jeep Wrangler behind\n\nIndian investors are diverging from those in advanced markets.
