A rare example of interdisciplinary academic association\n\nProf. Dr. Gobinda Prasad Sarma, Former Professor of English, Gauhati University\n\n(22-10-2019)\n\nI'm both honoured & delighted to be the Speaker on the occasion of the Commerce Day at Guwahati College today. Wonderful to see a packed hall with students as well as faculty members. Hope my deliberation would help students in finding interest in 'Branding', 'Marketing' and 'Communication, as when they go along learning management, commerce etc. Thanks to Dr. Pranab Sandilya, Principal of the College for his amazing hospitality along with his team. He seems to be a good leader under whom the College would reach newer heights. Gratitude & best wishes.\n\nMd. Anisul Hoque, Founder & Creative Head, Resonance Brand Communications\n\n(19-10-2019)\n\nToday was my memorable day. Visited this College and liked the atmosphere of the College with its excellent Staff and bright students. It was a wonderful time in the College.
