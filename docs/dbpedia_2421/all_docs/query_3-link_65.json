        "text": "‚ú® Nalanda University: A Lost Treasure of Bharat ‚ú¥Ô∏èIn the heart of ancient India, amidst the fertile plains of Bihar, stood Nalanda University, a beacon of knowledge and intellectual enlightenment. Founded in the 5th century CE, Nalanda flourished for over 700 years, attracting scholars and students from across the Asian continent. It was a place where diverse cultures and traditions converged, where minds collided and ideas ignited, where the pursuit of knowledge transcended borders and religions. Nalanda's reputation as a center of learning was legendary. Its vast library, housing countless manuscripts on philosophy, literature, medicine, and astronomy, was said to be the largest in the world. Its renowned scholars, versed in various fields of knowledge, attracted students from as far as China, Tibet, Korea, and Persia. The university's rigorous academic standards ensured that only the most brilliant minds were admitted, and its graduates went on to become influential figures in their respective fields. The university's curriculum was comprehensive and holistic, encompassing not only traditional academic disciplines but also the study of logic, debate, and meditation. Students were encouraged to question, to challenge, to delve into the depths of knowledge and seek their own understanding. The atmosphere was one of intellectual stimulation and open inquiry, fostering a spirit of innovation and creativity. Nalanda's impact extended far beyond the confines of its walls. Its scholars played a pivotal role in preserving and transmitting knowledge throughout the Asian world. Their writings and teachings influenced the development of philosophy, medicine, and astronomy in various cultures. Nalanda's legacy is a testament to the power of education and the transformative potential of knowledge. . . . . üìåDon't forget to follow Shantanu Priyadarshi for Regular Updates #Indian #update #history\n\nThis is Ritobroto Chanda from Kolkata. After schooling from South Point High School, with science stream, had to appear in the CBSE finals with scribe due to sudden health conditions, aspired to be an architect but as fate had it, I fell in love with Economics. I converted IIT-KGP‚Äôs B.Arch and Jadavpur University‚Äôs Civil, amongst others but due to health, decided to pursue B.Sc. Economics Hons from Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur Math which is one of the top-10 colleges of India with NAAC Grade A++. I converted various top foreign universities to pursue PG, but decided to pursue an MBA from India and with almost no preparation, cracked CAT22, went to XIMB, but dropped out within 4 months due to various reasons and currently am pursuing M.Sc. Economics form University of Calcutta, having appeared no Economics entrances. I found this treasure trove unknowingly. I am also pursuing a research assistantship under some world-renowned economists from IIM-B, Monash University- Australia, Exeter Business School -UK, ISI-Kolkata and Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Belur Math. I have observed monastic and private HEIs, consulting and research fields, economics and management students, institutes and curriculum from close and believe my story would help others in their journey. But I am not only an academic person, I have got quite a lot of achievements in my Co-curricular and extra- curriculars as well, as I believe, ‚ÄúAll work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy‚Äù. If my experience helps you, I shall be happy. https://lnkd.in/egxDmTGa\n\nThree years ago, I unexpectedly became a teacher online, connecting with students globally. Ikshu, 9 at the time, was in my first batch. Meeting Ikshu online was serendipitous. Despite an accidental double booking with another teacher, Deepa, his mother, chose me. Entering the virtual classroom, there he was‚Äîa 9-year-old with a single tuft of hair standing like a coconut tree on his head, giant glasses framing innocent eyes and sharp ears, all complemented by his genius brain. My initial impression was clear‚Äîhe was destined for greatness. Being part of his journey has been rewarding. Recently, after 5-6 years, he flew in from the US. The anticipation of finally meeting him in person was beyond words. Experiencing that moment come alive was soul-stirring. November 29th, 2023‚Äîa date etched in my heart. A day trip to Mysore with Ikshu, an unforgettable experience beyond words. While we commonly think teachers shape students, in my journey, working with kids molded me into the professional I am today. Experiencing Ikshu's journey, from our first online meeting to finally meeting in person after years, is truly heartwarming. Grateful for the profound impact of these moments. #heartwarmingmoments #TeachingConnection #SpecialMemories #professionalgrowth\n\nFrom Ashes to Glory: Nalanda University Rises Again A Legacy Reborn, a Beacon Rekindled Nalanda University: the very name evokes a sense of awe. This ancient seat of learning, a vibrant tapestry of cultures and disciplines, once stood as a testament to India's intellectual prowess. Destroyed by invaders, its loss echoed through the ages. But the embers of knowledge never truly died. #Nalanda #AncientIndia #Education #History Fast forward 77 years. A university rises from the ashes, a phoenix reclaiming its rightful place. Not out of vengeance, but out of a deep respect for our heritage. It's a reminder of the immense intellectual wealth India once possessed, a wealth that illuminated a world shrouded in darkness. #NalandaUniversity2.0 #Rebirth #Knowledge Nalanda 2.0 is not merely a reconstruction; it's a bridge connecting our glorious past to a future brimming with possibilities. It's a call to action, urging us to reclaim our place as a global center of learning. Just as Nalanda thrived alongside Takshashila, let us ensure both these ancient giants rise again, fostering knowledge and illuminating the path for generations to come. #TakshashilaUniversity #EducationForAll #FutureofIndia Let's celebrate Nalanda's resurgence, not as revenge, but as a testament to the enduring human spirit. Let the fires of knowledge burn bright once more, illuminating the world with India's rich heritage.\n\nDear Friends and research community, it's very unfortunate that few Assistant professors are following wrong practices in research publications and misusing resources of India's oldest Engineering institute for their personal and family persons even without acknowledging IIT ROORKEE. I am thankful to Retraction Watch who took my matter among international research community. Please read the article and think about following questions which assistant professor Kirtiraj Gaikwad and his wife (Mrs Suman Singh) is misleading the IIT Roorkee. Link to article: https://lnkd.in/gjHvVgYY IIT ROORKEE have been informed about this particular matter around 6 months ago and I am waiting for their response. 1. How can a assistant professor steal testing data that i have research and publish in the name of other student. (Paper Link: https://lnkd.in/gEyirBCN) 2. That other student (Ms Jain) has publish the data and the timeline suggest the work was done in just one month after joining PhD. 3. How one can do testing in past, doing time travel. (Dr Singh , w/o assistant professor Gaikwad has responded that first author (Ms Jain) of published article, is working with her since June 2022, however I have mailed the testing and analysis results in February 2022. 4. IIT Roorkee is providing world class infrastructure, but assistant professor Gaikwad has used those resources in his publication (he has accepted this also) but he doesn't acknowledged IIT ROORKEE In credit section. Also it's unfortunate that authros has acknowledged one project in which Dr Singh ,w/o assistant professor Gaikwad is PI. If these kinds of things go on and on, i dont know how many researchers work will go in vain. These kind of practice by supervisor with there student is not only defaming the IITs but also not letting researchers to work in India. No wonder why most students opt for PhD outside India. I urge the people to not neglect it and help India by taking strict actions against people like assistant professor Gaikwad. #iit #iitroorkee #phd #retractionwatch #research #postdoctoral #packaging #papertechnology #activepackaging #FFPL"
