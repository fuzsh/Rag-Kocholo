        "text": "According to police, after an argument, students started fighting with each other, resulting in at least six of them being injured. However, the injuries were minor, and the students were released from the hospital after initial treatment, police said.\n\nThe ABVP on Monday organised a debate at their “State Students Leaders Conference” at the Birinchi Kumar Barua Auditorium of Gauhati University. According to the ABVP, a group of students initially attempted to create obstacles in the debate and later they attacked the organisers.\n\nHowever, the protesting students claimed that ABVP members were making derogatory remarks and targeting some sections of society. “This is an educational institute and students’ politics has certain limits,” said a student.\n\nThe university authorities said that they will investigate the matter and actions will be taken if required.\n\nThe rules of CAA were announced by the central government on March 11 and several discussions are happening across Assam regarding the importance and impact of the law.\n\nParliament passed the law in December 2019, which paves the way for citizenship to undocumented Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Parsi, Buddhist, and Christian migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014."
