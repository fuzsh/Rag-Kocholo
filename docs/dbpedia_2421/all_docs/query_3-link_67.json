        "text": "The Assam Police have arrested nine persons, including the prime accused, in an alleged mark sheet scam involving officials of Gauhati University.\n\nThe scam came to light after Azizul Haque, an undergraduate student at the Ganesh Lal Choudhury College in western Assam’s Barpeta, was found to have possessed a forged mark sheet.\n\nThe college is affiliated with Gauhati University, for which music maestro Bhupen Hazarika had composed a song titled ‘Jilikabo Luitore Paar’, meaning the institution will make the banks of the Brahmaputra sparkle.\n\nA police official investigating the case said the arrests were made from various locations in Guwahati, Barpeta, Kalgachia, and Dhubri. Among the arrested were Krishan Krishnamurti, an employee of Gauhati University, Shivtosh Mahato, an employee of Dhubri Law College, and Aminul Islam, a librarian of a college in Dhubri.\n\nA week ago, the Postgraduate Students’ Union of Gauhati University accused the university authorities of manipulating marks on the final mark sheets of students during the re-evaluation of papers for a price.\n\n“Employees of various departments of the university are involved in it. They are increasing marks of students in exchange for cash in the name of mark sheet re-evaluation,” the union said in a statement, claiming marks were being increased for ₹16,000 per subject.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the government would get to the bottom of the scam. “Those responsible for running the computerised mark sheet system take cash and increase the marks. Even an operator can change the marks in the digital system used by Gauhati University,” he said."
