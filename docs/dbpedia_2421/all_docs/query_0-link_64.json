        "text": "Guwahati, city, western Assam state, northeastern India. It lies along the Brahmaputra River (there bridged) and is picturesquely situated with an amphitheatre of wooded hills to the south.\n\nGuwahati was the capital of the Hindu kingdom of Kamarupa (under the name of Pragjyotisa) about 400 ce. In the 17th century the town repeatedly changed hands between the Muslims and the Ahoms (a Tai-speaking people who had migrated from Yunnan province, China, and ruled much of Assam from the 13th century ce) until it became the seat of the Ahom governor of Lower Assam in 1681. In 1786 the Ahom raja made it his capital. The Myanmar (Burmese) held Guwahati from 1816 until 1826, when it became the British capital of Assam. The capital was moved 67 miles (108 km) south to Shillong in 1874.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nExplore India Quiz"
