        "text": "Guwahati, Mar 18 (PTI) Students of Gauhati University (GU) and ABVP members clashed on the varsity campus in the city’s Jalukbari area on Monday after the latter allegedly tore down anti-CAA posters, police said.\n\nThe BJP’s student wing, however, denied the accusation.\n\nSeveral students sustained injuries during the chaos, prompting top officials to swiftly respond to the scene, police added.\n\nMembers of the Post-Graduate Students Union (PGSU), GU’s elected student body, asserted that ABVP members tore down anti-CAA posters displayed at a university gate, sparking confrontations that escalated into a physical altercation.\n\nABVP, which was conducting a meeting in a hall on the university premises, refuted PGSU’s claim and alleged that its members faced anti-CAA slogans and were obstructed from entering the premises.\n\nInjured students received treatment at a nearby hospital, police said.\n\n“Our top officials promptly arrived at the scene, and the situation has now been brought under control,” they added.
