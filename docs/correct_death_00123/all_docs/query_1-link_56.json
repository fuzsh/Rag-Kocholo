        "text": "In “Jim Henson Idea Man,” Ron Howard offers a close-up look at the driven “Muppets” creator and puppeteer whose cultural and educational legacy remains enormous.\n\nHenson, 53 when he died in1990, came into documentary focus for the Oscar-winning Howard when his family opted to make their archive accessible.\n\n“They didn’t want to produce it, even though they’re a family that produces a lot of TV shows and movies,” Howard, 70, said in a Zoom interview. “I went in and immediately realized that I didn’t know much about Jim Henson, although I thought I did.”\n\nHenson met in college, married and created the Muppets with Jane Nebel. They had five children. Jane was 78 when she died in 2013.\n\n“The family was very open to talking about him as an individual, talking about their mom, talking about their upbringing,” Howard discovered.\n\n“Immediately, I felt like in addition to introducing people to stuff that you didn’t know Jim made and then celebrating the stuff that you do remember and know, there was this interesting life journey for him as an individual. But also for Jane as his spouse.”\n\nHow awkward – or isn’t it – to discuss difficult parental issues with their kids?\n\n“They’re adults. They recognize certain things about their parents and their relationship that were painful. Might still feel painful or disappointing, but they recognize that it was part of everyone’s journey. So, nothing was out of bounds.\n\n“Yes, the romance in their relationship waned and they romantically went their separate ways. They did it in an optimal way in terms of preserving the family’s sense of connection and love and minimizing acrimony and all those things.\n\n“Like a lot of things in their lives, they made great decisions about the way they comported themselves. It’s one of the reasons that as a team and individually they were both so productive.\n\n“I think Jane emerges as an individual without whom there would be no Muppets.”\n\nWhat surprised Howard most in this investigation?\n\n“I was pretty shocked to find that he didn’t grow up with puppets and love puppets. He was so inventive with them. Jim only really wanted to be on television and find some outlet for his creativity.”\n\nWhen the Muppets took off, first in commercials, then shorts, “He just recognized a window of opportunity and grabbed it. That says a lot about him. And sends a great message to all people to plan and dream but be ready to take advantage of doors as they open!\n\n“Recognize a doorway that you might not have exactly been looking for, but when it opens, you can recognize it. All that really surprised me.”\n\n“Jim Henson Idea Man” streams on Disney+ May 31"
