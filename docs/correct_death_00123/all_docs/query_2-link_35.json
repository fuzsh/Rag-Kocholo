        "text": "Kermit the Frog, Cookie Monster, and Oscar the Grouch are a few of the characters known as Muppets. Their creator was Jim Henson. He made up the word Muppets as a blend of “marionette” (a type of puppet controlled by strings) and “puppet.”\n\nJames Maury Henson was born on September 24, 1936, in Greenville, Mississippi. He created the Muppets while attending college. Most puppets of the time were made of wood. But Henson searched for material that would be easier to move and could let characters show more personality. He chose foam rubber and plastic covered with fabric.\n\nThe Muppets began appearing in brief segments on television programs in the late 1950s and 1960s. They became very popular in 1969 when they became part of the television show Sesame Street. They were featured in their own television program, The Muppet Show, from 1976 to 1981. They later appeared in The Muppet Movie (1979) and other motion pictures. Henson also worked on films that had puppets other than the Muppets. He died in New York City on May 16, 1990."
