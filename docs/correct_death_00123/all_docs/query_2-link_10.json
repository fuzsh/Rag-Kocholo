        "text": "James Maury Henson (September 24, 1936 – May 16, 1990) was an American animator, artist and puppeteer. He was best known for his work with the Muppets, which he helped to create.[1]\n\nHenson's best known puppet is Kermit the Frog. As a puppeteer, Henson performed in various television programs, such as Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, movies such as The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper. He also made puppets for projects like Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth. He died of Organ Failure in New York[source?]\n\nThe Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation continued after his death, making new series and specials. Jim Henson's Creature Shop, founded by Henson, also continues to build creatures for a large number of other movies and series (e.g. the science-fiction production Farscape, the movie adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the movie MirrorMask) and is said to be one of the most advanced and well respected creators of movie creatures.\n\nHis son Brian and daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company. His daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, plays the roles of Kermit the Frog and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson.[2]\n\nOne of Henson's last projects is a show attraction in Walt Disney World and Disneyland. It is called Muppet*Vision 3D. It opened in 1991, shortly after his death.\n\nHenson is honored both as himself and as Kermit the Frog on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Only two other people have received this honor: Mel Blanc as both himself and Bugs Bunny; and Walt Disney as both himself and Mickey Mouse.\n\nThe theater at his alma mater, Northwestern High School, in Hyattsville, MD, is named in his honor.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze and The Muppet Christmas Carol are both dedicated to him.\n\nStephen Lynch made a song titled \"Jim Henson's Dead\". He talks about many of the characters from The Muppet Show and Sesame Street.\n\nHenson is shown in The American Adventure in Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort.\n\nPhilip Roth often quotes Jim Henson in his Sabbath's Theater as the \"great regret\" for Mickey Sabbath.\n\nThe Jim Henson Museum, in his hometown of Leland, Mississippi, has an assortment of original Muppet characters, official certificates from the Mississippi Legislature honoring Henson and his characters, and a statue of Kermit in the middle of the stream behind the museum.\n\nThe 1990 television special The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson let the Muppets themselves pay tribute to Henson. The special had interviews with Steven Spielberg and others.\n\nCeltic singer, musician, and songwriter Heather Alexander wrote a song titled \"Storyteller\" in 1990. It is about his \"Storyteller\" series as well as his role as a modern storyteller.\n\nTom Smith's Henson tribute song, \"A Boy and His Frog\", won the Pegasus Award for Best Filk Song in 1991.\n\nHenson was shown in Boyz II Men's 1991 video, \"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\".\n\nEpisode 2880 of Sesame Street (which aired on November 15, 1991) was dedicated in his memory, with a memorial card following the closing credits.\n\nUniversity of Maryland, College Park has a life-size statue of Henson and Kermit the Frog.[3]\n\nKermit the Frog was named Grand Marshall of the 1996 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California.\n\nOn the evening of October 25, 2000, Comedy Central had a banner sign that said: Jim Henson [1936–1990].\n\nIn 2003, Jim Henson was honored at the yearly Norsk Høstfest in Minot, North Dakota.[4]\n\nA 3D tribute to Henson called Over Time was shown as part of the 2005 Electronic Theater at SIGGRAPH.\n\nOn September 28, 2005, the U.S. Postal Service issued a sheet of commemorative stamps honoring Henson and the Muppets.\n\nThe Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia, has more than 700 puppets made by Henson and his studio. Many of these are displayed in the museum exhibit Jim Henson: Puppeteer. In September 2008, the Center opened Jim Henson: Wonders From His Workshop, highlighting creations from Fraggle Rock, Labyrinth, and other later works.\n\nOn September 24, 2011, Henson's hometown of Leland renamed one of their bridges \"The Rainbow Connection\" to honor Henson and his work.\n\nOn his 75th birthday the Google doodle was six Muppets.[5]\n\nProgram Character(s) Sam and Friends Sam, Harry the Hipster, Kermit, Omar, Professor Madcliffe, Pierre the French Rat, Yorick, others Sesame Street Ernie, Kermit, Guy Smiley, Anything Muppets, an apple from \"Bilingual Fruit Song\", As I Was Going to St. Ives boy, Baby Monster, Bad Bart, Barry Rhymie, Beautiful Day Monster, Beginning, Ben, Big Jeffy, Billy Monster, Bip Bippadotta, Captain Vegetable, Charlie, Dan, Father, Fenwick, Flakey, The Geefle, The Genie, George Washington, Grandmother Happy, Granny Fanny Nesselrode, Harold Happy, Harvey Monster, Henry, Herman the Hoppity-Hop, Hippie, J Friend Singer, The King, King Gerry the Generous, King Peter the Persnickety, Lance, Lavender \"Fat Cat\" performer, Librarian, Little Chrissy, Lost & Found Clerk, Marvin, Maurice, Maurice, Maurice Monster, Mr. Essex, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nose, Old King Cole's Band Fat Blue fiddler & Pumpkin bass player, Pat Playjacks, Pokey, Salvador Dada, Sam, Sammy the Snake, Scudge (1969), Sherlock Hemlock, Showered Rosell, Sinister Sam, Sneaky, Spaceship Surprise Captain, Stan, Thomas Twiddlebug, Three Little Pigs, Tony, Warren Wolf, Witch, Yellow Submarine Fat Blue train engineer, Yip Yip Martians, Zizzy Zoomer The Muppet Valetine Show Wally, Kermit, Rowlf, Ernie The Muppet Show: Sex & Violence George Washington, Hudson, The Swedish Chef, Waldorf, Dr. Teeth, Kermit The Muppet Show Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, The Newsman, Link Hogthrob, Mahna Mahna, Crazy Harry, Shakey Sanchez, Balloon-Head Conductor, Beautiful Day Monster, Beaver, Black Rooster, Bobo the Bear, Brown Bear, Butch, Dancers, Doglion, The Eel, Flower-Eating Monster, Frog, Fuzz Brother, a Gills Brother, Green Heap, Green Frackle, Hillbilly Singer, Jim, Kermit the Protozoa, Lenny the Lizard, Lefty, a Muppaphone, The Newspig, Penguins, Pigs, Prairie Dogs, Robot Kermit, Rover Joe, The Scientist, Silver Beak, Slim Wilson, Wally, Wally Whoopie, Whatnots, Zeke Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas Kermit, Harrison Fox, Harvey Beaver, Howard Snake Christmas Eve on Sesame Street Kermit, Ernie The Muppet Movie Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, The Swedish Chef The Great Muppet Caper Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, The Newsman The Muppets Take Manhattan Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, The Newsman, Ernie, Baby Kermit, Baby Rowlf, Penguins Follow That Bird Kermit, Ernie The Christmas Toy Jack-in-the-Box, Kermit A Muppet Family Christmas Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, The Newsman, Guy Smiley, & a penguin The Jim Henson Hour Kermit, Dr. Teeth, Link Hogthrob, The Swedish Chef, Timecaster, Teddy Bear, Garbage Bags, Timrek the Gorf, Screaming No-Nos Sesame Street... 20 Years & Still Counting Ernie, Kermit The Muppets at Walt Disney World Kermit, Rowlf, Dr. Teeth, Waldorf, The Swedish Chef, Link Hogthrob Sing Yourself Silly!
