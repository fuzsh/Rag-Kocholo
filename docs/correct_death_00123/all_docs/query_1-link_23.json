        "text": "First look at the $30M penthouse at Robert A.M. Stern’s 30 Park Place\n\nBy Dana Schulz\n\nThe top-floor units at Robert A.M. Stern's 930-foot 30 Park Place have a way of making headlines. The 82nd floor penthouse, for instance, boasts the highest private outdoor space in the city, and the building's own developer, Larry Silverstein, recently snatched up the massive 80th floor spread for $34 million. But below these units are two duplex penthouses that span the 78th and 79th floors, notable for their double-height loggias that, as Curbed notes, have become a fixture in classic Stern buildings like 15 Central Park West and 520 Park Avenue. Curbed also got their hands on new photos of penthouse 78B, on the market for $29.5 million, which not only showcase the incredible views from the terrace, but new looks at the interiors.\n\nMore looks ahead\n\nDerek Jeter finally finds a buyer for upstate New York ‘castle’\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nFormer New York Yankee Derek Jeter has finally found a buyer for his unique compound in upstate New York. As first reported by Mansion Global, the 50,000-square-foot waterfront estate in Greenwood Lake, known as Tiedemann Castle, sold last week after several years on and off the market. Jeter purchased the property in 2003 and spent 15 years renovating the \"castle\" before listing it for $14.75 million in 2018. While the final price is not known since it hasn't closed yet, the home at 14 Lake Shore Road was most recently listed for $6.3 million.\n\nmore this way\n\nFor $28.5M, own a designer’s Victorian Gothic mansion on 13 acres overlooking the Hudson River\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nLocated in the sought-after Snedens Landing community in Palisades, New York, this 13-acre estate at 23 Ludlow Lane is asking $28,500,000. While this is undeniably an astounding ask, the Rockland County property transcends the ordinary Hudson Valley spread. Consisting of three adjoining lots being sold together for the first time since it was created in 1874, the estate, known as Niederhurst, is anchored by a stunning home on a scenic bluff overlooking the Hudson River. The eight-bedroom house has a Victorian Gothic exterior with gable and hip roofs, six-panel shutters, and an intricate pattern of polychrome brickwork.\n\nTour this amazing hudson valley property\n\n$1.8M restored Marcel Breuer house on the Hudson has kept its mid-century modern spirit intact\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nRestored with the architect's signature style in mind, the Marcel Breuer-designed Marshad House in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., was brought into modern times by owners who wanted to preserve the Bauhaus-trained architect's signature style. The pair gave the 1950 home 21st-century livability while enjoying the uniqueness of the modernist residence. Asking $1,800,000, the 2,292-square-foot, three-bedroom home at 204 Cleveland Drive is sited on three-quarters of an acre next to public woodlands, surrounded by landscaped modern gardens, walking trails, and the nearby village.\n\nmore of this icon modern home\n\nA fashion designer’s cozy converted 1920s barn in upstate NY asks $2.9M\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nA converted barn in upstate New York owned by a notable fashion designer is now on the market. Keren Craig, the co-founder of the high-end clothing brand Marchesa, has owned the property for 14 years, during which she renovated, expanded, and transformed the 100-year-old barn into a well-designed escape from city life. Located about two hours north of Manhattan in the laid-back hamlet of Accord, the home, asking $2,875,000, sits on over six acres of scenic forest.\n\ndetails this way\n\nThis $795K Hudson Valley farmhouse has clean, classic curb appeal–and a guest house in the back\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nWhile architecture trends change with the times, there's something about the simple lines and stunning surroundings of a classic upstate farmhouse that endures. This circa 1840 eyebrow colonial at 720 Center Hill Road in Copake, New York, embodies that aesthetic. Carefully considered design details make this historic property–asking $795,000–both modern and timeless. As an irresistible bonus, there's a fully outfitted–and utterly charming–guest house just out back.\n\ntake the tour\n\n19th-century townhouse in Hudson, NY has three units, retail space, and a three-bay garage for $2M\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nLocated in a prime spot in cultured, quirky, and trendy Hudson, New York, this brick Federal Style townhouse at 239 Warren Street, built circa 1820, has curb appeal galore in the form of historic charm. A lot is going on beyond the property's fetching bay windows and smart black trim; inside are three separate units on a double lot, including retail space and a garage. Behind the home is a wide backyard with idyllic planted gardens. Asking $1,995,000, the downtown townhouse is a chance to create the upstate life of your dreams, all in one place.\n\ntour this unique upstate property"
