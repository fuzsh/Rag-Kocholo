        "text": "We’re very excited to see the new Jim Henson documentary, entitled Jim Henson: Idea Man.\n\nThe genius behind The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Dark Crystal, and so much more died young, yet left such an indelible mark on popular culture, and many of the most beloved children’s characters of all time.\n\nHow incredible that some green felt, worn on a man’s hand, could create such an iconic character as Kermit the Frog?\n\nThe movie dives into the history, inspiration, and legacy of Jim Henson, whose work lives on, and continues to inspire so many.\n\nThe documentary streams on Disney+ starting today.\n\nVia Colossal:\n\n“Few artists—or animators or Hollywood stars, for that matter—can claim to have had as profound an influence on the hearts and minds of numerous generations as Jim Henson.\n\nFrom television sensations like Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and The Muppets to silver-screen cult classics like The Dark Crystal (1982) and Labyrinth (1986), Henson took the art of puppeteering to unprecedented heights and built incredible worlds for viewers to escape to.\n\nA new film by acclaimed director Ron Howard, Jim Henson: Idea Man, delves into the work and life of the visionary artist. Following his trajectory from budding puppeteer to global sensation, the documentary traces his legacy and creative process through interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, plus archival footage and glimpses behind the scenes.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nDiscover more from Moss and Fog\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nAn award winning art, design, nature and travel site, bringing you the best content from around the world.
