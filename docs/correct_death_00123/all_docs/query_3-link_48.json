        "text": "At a celebratory opening ceremony for The Jim Henson Exhibition, housed in a new gallery at Museum of the Moving Image funded by the City of New York, the First Lady of New York City Chirlane McCray, the Museum’s Executive Director Carl Goodman, Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen, and City Council Majority Leader Jimmy Van Bramer were joined by Jim Henson’s daughter Cheryl Henson, and special appearances by Abby Cadabby, Red Fraggle, and Fozzie Bear, among other guests. This major new exhibition is dedicated to the life and legacy of Jim Henson, who was a singular creative figure in the realms of television, film, and puppetry—and a New Yorker who made the city his base for family and work. The Jim Henson Exhibition opened to the public on Saturday, July 22.\n\nThe Jim Henson Exhibition features a broad range of artifacts from throughout Henson’s remarkable television and film career. It reveals how Henson and his team of builders, performers, and writers brought to life the enduringly popular worlds of “The Muppet Show,” “Sesame Street,” “Fraggle Rock,” “The Dark Crystal,” and “Labyrinth.” It also includes material from Henson’s lesser known and experimental film projects, presenting Henson as a restlessly creative performer, filmmaker, and technical innovator.\n\nAmong the more than 300 objects on view in The Jim Henson Exhibition are 47 puppets, including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Rowlf, The Swedish Chef, Statler, Waldorf, Big Bird, Elmo, Cantus Fraggle, a Skeksis, and other popular favorites. Many of the artifacts in the exhibition are drawn from the 2013 donation by Jim Henson’s family to the Museum’s collection. The exhibition also includes sketches, storyboards, scripts, and other material on loan from The Jim Henson Company Archives. Archival video and photographic material was provided by The Jim Henson Company, Sesame Workshop, and The Muppets Studio.\n\nThe Jim Henson Exhibition is organized by Barbara Miller, Curator of the Collection and Exhibitions. Wendell Walker is the Director of Production and Design.\n\nThe exhibition was organized by Museum of the Moving Image, in collaboration with the Henson family, The Jim Henson Legacy, and The Jim Henson Company, and in cooperation with Sesame Workshop and The Muppets Studio.\n\nThe exhibition is housed in a new gallery which received $4.5 million in city funding, with over $1.6 million from the city’s Executive Budget, $2 million from NYC Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, and $500,000 from Borough President Melinda Katz.\n\nAlso attending the ribbon-cutting were NYC Department of Cultural Affairs Commissioner Tom Finkelpearl; James Patchett, President of the NYC Economic Development Corp; the Museum’s Co-Chairman Ivan L. Lustig; the Museum’s Vice Chair and Secretary Warrington Hudlin; Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment First Deputy Commissioner Kai Falkenberg; NYC & Company President Fred Dixon; Debbie McClellan, Vice President, The Muppets Studio; Betsy Loredo, Executive Editor, Sesame Workshop; Karen Falk, Archives Director, The Jim Henson Company; Craig Shemin, President, and Bonnie Erickson, President Emeritus, of The Jim Henson Legacy; Brian Collins, founder and CEO of COLLINS; and many of the Museum’s staff and supporters who made the gallery and the exhibition possible.\n\n“The Jim Henson Exhibition is a beautiful homage to an artist whose influence on our children’s education and popular culture is immeasurable,” said First Lady of New York City Chirlane McCray. “With warmth, a little bit of silliness, and a whole lot of love, Henson’s characters will continue to teach and bridge cultural and education gaps for generations to come.”\n\n“I am delighted our beloved Muppets have a new home in the World’s Borough, and fittingly, at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image. I congratulate Council Member Van Bramer and Borough President Katz for their collaboration and dedication to America’s most irascible monsters—and New York families,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.\n\n“Jim Henson was a treasure whose characters continue to ignite imaginations and delight children and adults throughout the world,” said Queens Borough President Melinda Katz. “Queens is proud to permanently host the Jim Henson gallery here in ‘The World’s Borough.’ Congratulations to the Henson family, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Museum of the Moving Image for making this exhibit a reality.”\n\n“From The Muppet Show to Sesame Street, the work of Jim Henson touched the hearts of millions across our globe,” said Majority Leader Jimmy Van Bramer. “The volume and originality of Jim Henson’s work is truly astounding, and I’m proud to have secured $2 million in funding for a permanent exhibit at the Museum of the Moving Image so that hundreds of his personal artifacts including puppets, storyboards, and sketches can find a permanent home in Western Queens. For generations to come, this exhibit will tell the story of his work and inspire all who visit.”\n\n“It’s great news that the Museum of the Moving Image will have a permanent gallery dedicated to the charming, whimsical, imaginative work of Jim Henson, one of the most creative and innovative performers/developers in the history of television. From The Muppet Show to Fraggle Rock, Jim Henson’s creations have delighted and inspired us,” said U.S. Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney (NY-12). “The Muppets lived in New York and have a particularly New York ethos, which is why it is so important for them to be on display here to enthrall new generations of fans. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Mayor de Blasio and City Council Cultural Affairs Chair Jimmy Van Bramer for helping the Jim Henson collection find a permanent home at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image.”\n\n“Jim Henson’s Muppets are truly an American treasure, and it’s wonderful that one of Astoria’s many treasures—the Museum of the Moving Image—will now be home to this exhibit,” said NYS Assembly Member Aravella Simotas.\n\nA traveling version of the exhibition, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, opened on May 20 at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle, Washington."
