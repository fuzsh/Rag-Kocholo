        "text": "Animation Film\n\n‘Jim Henson: Idea Man’ Traces the Remarkable Life and Work of the Visionary Puppeteer\n\nFew artists—or animators or Hollywood stars, for that matter—can claim to have had as profound an influence on the hearts and minds of numerous generations as Jim Henson. From television sensations like Sesame Street, Fraggle Rock, and The Muppets to silver-screen cult classics like The Dark Crystal (1982) and Labyrinth (1986), Henson took the art of puppeteering to unprecedented heights and built incredible worlds for viewers to escape to.\n\nA new film by acclaimed director Ron Howard, Jim Henson: Idea Man, delves into the work and life of the visionary artist. Following his trajectory from budding puppeteer to global sensation, the documentary traces his legacy and creative process through interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, plus archival footage and glimpses behind the scenes.\n\nIdea Man zooms in on Henson’s distinctive commitment to his art, which transformed children’s television and ushered in a new era for film. In 1979, his big-screen debut, The Muppet Movie, included Henson as Kermit the Frog singing “Rainbow Connection,” which hit number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 list and was nominated for Best Original Song at the Academy Awards. He was also tapped to consult on the character Yoda for George Lucas’s iconic 1980 Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nUntil his untimely death from a viral infection in May 1990 at the age of 53, Henson was staunchly committed to his work, launching the art of the puppet into the spotlight and creating timeless memories for millions. Idea Man begins streaming on Disney+ tomorrow.\n\nDo stories and artists like this matter to you? Become a Colossal Member today and support independent arts publishing for as little as $5 per month.
