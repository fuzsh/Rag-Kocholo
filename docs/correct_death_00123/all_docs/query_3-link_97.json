        "text": "It was with no small effort that I came to the conclusion on whom/what to report on for my final project in Practical Mysticism. None of the examples given in our workbook really spoke to me as I had no personal connection to speak of. I looked at what it meant to be a mystic to me, what characteristics this would embody, how this person would function in the world and what they would leave behind. Whom had really been those things to me in my life.\n\nI had first thought of writing about a person whom I had adopted as my hero in High School, Maya Angelou. I knew so much about her life as I owned every one of her auto biographies, poetry collections, as well as ‘On The Pulse Of Morning’ which she recited for the Clinton inauguration. However, I also know that she keeps a firearm by her chair in her study which she had used to threaten an intruder while asking “Is this really what you want to be doing when you die?” While this was very B.A. and totally impressive on some level, it just didn’t feel very mystical to me.\n\nSo I went back a little further and almost instantly I knew who I had to write about. This person has had me captivated and in love with his world since I was a small child. The environment he created, while deeply rooted in imagination, was very relatable. I could easily see myself playing it out as it was happening before me. Both adults and children alike hungered for this place, as it could show us who we were and how we were meant to be. The third person perspective gave us a chance to visit OUR world as we wished it were and be the person we may have wanted to be all along without the fear that usually holds us back.\n\nMy mystic is Mr. Jim Henson. Jim was born on September 24th, 1936 in Greenville, Mississippi. His father was a researcher for the Dept. of Agriculture. They lived in Leland, MS until Jim was in the 5thgrade. His father took a job in Washington DC, so the Henson family moved to Hyattsville in Maryland where he would stay through college.\n\nGrowing up, Jim had many influences that helped guide him to be the man he grew into. His father’s career in agriculture and the rural start in his upbringing gave him a love of nature. As a child he could be found exploring nature and playing at the water’s edge of Deer Creek around his community. He collected frogs, snakes, and other critters. He fished and admired the birds native to the area.\n\nHe was raised in Christian Science, thus having a view of the world, spiritually, that was a bit more expansive than that of most children. He also had a grandmother that encouraged him to express himself creatively. Her own creative interests included painting, sewing, and quilting which he would have seen often as a child. The primary school he attended had recently implemented an arts program that he easily excelled in.\n\nIn high school he was involved in the theater program and loved to draw. He had been known to create posters for the plays, concerts, and other functions. In the theater department, he would work on the stage crew when he wasn’t acting.\n\nWhat further interested Jim as he grew up was television. He was completely fascinated with it and made it a goal in his life to get into television. He loved the medium and found its reach to the world a wonderful way to express thoughts, make impressions, and do something wonderful for others.\n\nThe summer before his senior year of high school, he made his way to the television station local to his area in Maryland and asked for a job. He was told that there were no jobs available and sent on his way. However as he was leaving, he noticed a poster advertising that they needed a puppeteer to assist a morning show. He left and built 3 puppets: A French rat named Pierre, a bug-eyed man named Sam, and a cowboy. He returned with his ensemble and asked again if he could have a job. They started him on the Junior Morning Show on WTOP/CBS, Washington, DC. And in 1955 his show Sam and Friends started airing live.\n\nThis little trio started his life into puppeteering, lasting him in various ways through college. There he studied Home Economics so he could take more art classes and learn puppet building. He also met his future wife who helped him with the puppets on the show at the television station.\n\nAfter college, still not sure he wanted to be a puppet master the rest of his life, he toured Europe where he found that there was so much more to puppets than he had ever known. Here in this land, puppeteering was an art form. He returned to the United States with a renewed confidence and direction.\n\nHis first puppets were different from the ones in use at the time. This design would later emulate the “Muppet” format. One of which was a greenish soft-bodied creature that would later morph into Kermit the Frog. This little guy and the bug eye’d gent from his television show days took to the studio and made commercials for Wilkins Coffee in Maryland. In these productions, one asked the other how he liked Wilkins Coffee. The other replies, “I’ve never had it.” So the little green guy blasts him with a cannon! Then he points the canon to the camera and says, “So what do YOU think of Wilkins Coffee?” This became so popular that Jim and his skeleton crew of close friends made hundreds of such coffee ad’s for companies across the US. The slap-stick sort of satire was certainly a theme that would be repeated throughout the Muppet evolution as well.\n\nWith the success of the coffee campaigns, other commercials including La Choy complete with the La Choy fire-breathing dragon, winning a local Emmy for Sam and Friends, multiple variety show appearances and other productions under his belt, Jim continues developing his style of puppet building that is what we know now as truly “Muppet”. In 1962 he creates Rowlf the Dog for a Purina dog food ad, who becomes a legend in his own rite through repeat engagements playing a piano on the Jimmy Dean Show.\n\nGaining notoriety with his Muppet work was one thing. He also liked simply exploring different forms of cinematography and created several pieces that were shown on NBC Experiment in Television. These decidedly UN-Muppet films were his way of expressing his thoughts on a more intellectual and adult level. The film ‘The Cube’ which appeared on NBC in 1969 has a premise that enforces to me his metaphysical background and belief system.\n\nThe movie features a man in an empty white square room and is searching for his way out. Meanwhile, other people are able to enter and exit at will, finding their way out as easily as they got in. He meets several different people who influence him along the way. He is chided, lied to, given half information, but ultimately left to his own devices to figure out how he needs to get out. The key that seems to lead him on the path out of his cube is to be true to him. Not allow outside influences affect his character or change how he presents himself to the world. He appeared to have this great revelation while talking to a psychologist, but again finds himself back in the cube.\n\nThe “lead through teaching” aspect of this film is also a theme that Jim carried into his adult life. During my research I found quote upon quote upon quote from those who had worked with him, saying that he didn’t necessarily “direct” his projects. One directly from Frank Oz saying, “Jim would never teach, he would always gently guide while we were playing.” There were many voices heard and perspectives given. He knew what he wanted and would gently guide and teach throughout productions.\n\nIn 1969, after being approached by the Children’s Television Workshop to work on Sesame Street, a pilot was made. Though Jim doesn’t take credit for Sesame Street’s creation, Jim Henson Studio’s were the driving force behind the Muppet’s in the neighborhood. By this time Frank Oz had been with the company for several years and took on many characters, as did Jim. Jim will be recognized as Kermit, Ernie, Guy Smiley, and the infamous Mahna Mahna!\n\nThis is the world where I met Jim Henson. I can clearly recall late mornings at my Grandmothers home, sitting WAY too close to the television propped up on an oversized ottoman that was conveniently situated ‘too close to the television’, watching society play out on Sesame Street. What he had given us is a direct reflection of ourselves.\n\nYou had a child in Big Bird who was only 3 years old. A really grumpy character that would steal your baseball if it landed in his yard, but would never hurt a fly in Oscar. Bert and Ernie were polar opposites, but showed us that you can be different and still love each other for who you are. Strange characters who looked different, sounded different, moved differently, communicated in different ways, all fit in for it didn’t matter that Snuffleupagus was an 8 foot tall wooly mammoth who seemed imaginary at first, as Big Bird was the only one who could see him. After a while, the grown ups started to believe in him, too, even though they hadn’t yet seen him. It would be a while still before they actually got to meet Snuffy for the first time. But Big Birds belief in him and subtle signs that they picked up on over the years convinced them that he must be real after all.\n\nThe Muppet Show was very much the same dynamic, just on an adult scale. You had characters ranging from animal, human parodies, to who-the-heck-knows-what contributing to the whole in whatever talent or method they had to offer. Even though the Hecklers would be sure to give as hard a time as they could muster, Fozzie would still tell his awful jokes and affirm that he IS a comedian. Miss Piggy knew without a second thought that she was the hottest thing out there, and Gonzo was certainly going to steal the show by blowing himself out of some sort of canon.\n\nMeanwhile, Kermit was in constant composure, always willing to lend advice, assistance, allow others to “give it a shot” or try something new and see what happened always hoping for the best. Most people who worked with Jim would say that he was very much like Kermit. The ring leader and the calm head surrounded by wild thinking creatives on his many shows and movies.\n\nHis spirituality was expressed in so much of his writing. Knowing that we all have the power of choice in our lives. To love and appreciate one another and everything around us. To forgive often. Knowing that there was a power over us and that we are here for a purpose and know that wherever we are it is perfect. He believed this so completely that he would not only be ok if someone in his company had an opportunity to advance elsewhere, he would give them his blessing and was joyous they were able to grow! He also believed that anyone could do anything and exhibited that through his own success, all the while inspiring those around him to work harder, to be more, to stretch further.\n\nHis practices did include morning meditations where he would sit in prayer. He would give thanks, declare gratitude, work on forgiveness, and make peace with anything that was troubling him. He and his wife also practiced transcendental meditation together.\n\nHe also had a fascination with paranormal studies, which, coupled with his spirituality, may have assisted him in his healthy outlook upon death itself. In a letter to his children which he wrote 5 years before his death, which started out “I feel strange writing this while I am alive, but it wouldn’t be easy after I go.”, he talked about his views on death. He said he was not afraid of death, but had “much curiosity and interest” in it, and was “waiting to say Hi” to those who went before. According to Jane, his wife, neither of them felt they knew what was in store in the afterlife, but that “he had great plans”.\n\nFurthering my endearment to him, he gave very specific instructions for his funeral. He urged no one to wear mourners Black. The Sesame Street theme song Sunny Days was played as well as a brass band that played ‘When The Saints Go Marching In’. Everyone was given butterflies on puppeteering wands to have floating above them. A quote by Jim was also given to everyone saying “Please watch out for each other and love everybody. It’s a good life, enjoy it!”\n\nThose who were close to him, brought into the Henson company by Jim and learned along his side learned more than they ever imagined. In reading personal commentary you can feel that they are talking about more than just a mere “boss” or “man”. There is a love that shines from their memories of him and a sense of gratitude that he even gave them a chance, then challenged them to be more. His love still shines through the Muppet foundations, fan clubs, performers, characters, and into every child’s living room when they click on Sesame Street on PBS. He was most definitely a man who knew who he was, how to navigate the world, or better yet, allow the flow to navigate him. He stayed true to himself at all times, loved everyone, blessed every miracle great and small, appreciated nature and all of those around him. Above all, he taught others on a large scale to do and be all of these things as well by showing them how to feel it.\n\nIt has been very hard to truly relate this in writing, and I still feel as though a mark has been missed. For I am trying to literally put a feeling in to writing. I simply FEEL with all that I am, at least per my own perspective, that the definition of mystic can be found in the human that was Jim Henson. A mystic knows their complete and perfect connection with the Divine at all times. Releases attachments and can be in a constant state of love and appreciation and in constant flow with the Universe. Knowing the power of the Universe and how to use it to impact ones own self as well as others. A mystic can know that anything and all things are possible, achievable, and that the face of God can be seen in all every day. Selflessness and the ability to nurture others, a joy in the achievements of others, joy in the smallest of things, the ability to believe in a person until they, too, believe in themselves.\n\nNot all of these attributes are textbook definitions of ‘what is mystic’, but once pulled together can’t really be ignored BUT to mean mystic. I use the term ‘feel’ many times to relate my own emotions or opinions, but also of many others whom have recorded their testimony of his influence. Above all of the rest, I feel that this is the most definitive evidence of all. He inspired people about him to FEEL. Feel about themselves, feel for others, feel for the activities that they were undertaking at the time, feel about the world, their work, their craft, their future and the future of others, the task at hand and what it meant to be doing it. He brought so many into his way of thinking and created an army of lovers. Lovers of life, art, children, creativity, play, making the world a better place.\n\nI call this Mystic. Thank you to Jim Henson."
