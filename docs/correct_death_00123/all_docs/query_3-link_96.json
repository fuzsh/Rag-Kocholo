        "text": "Today would be Jim Henson’s 82nd birthday. The beloved puppeteer changed the face of entertainment with his worldwide phenomenons like the Muppets and Sesame Street. He abounded in creativity and innovation, and was genuinely a kind and compassionate man. He once said,\n\n“I’ve never felt any sense of competition with anybody, and we’re all friends; we’re all good friends.”\n\nHollywood needs more men like Jim Henson.\n\nHe was a force for change and he spent his time time between the dash trying to make this world a better place. Although he was not a professing Christian (he grew up in the Christian Science religion but walked away from faith in his 20s), he exhibited many of the characteristics that the Bible upholds: love, encouragement, kindness, gentleness, and peace. Even his most beloved characters—Kermit the Frog, Big Bird, and Yoda—are portraits of innocence and purity from a bygone era.\n\nJim Henson was (indirectly) responsible for both of my top two favorite movies growing up: The Dark Crystal (1982) and The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). He died during production of the latter, and the film was finished in his memory. Those two movies, in a very real way, are representative of my childhood. I remember them vividly and they bring waves of nostalgia every time I see them. I have Jim Henson to thank for his wildly, weirdly, perfect imagination and sense of humor that defined me growing up. And a side note: Michael Caine plays the BEST Ebenezer Scrooge in ANY film adaptation of A Christmas Carol. No questions, no comments, no arguments. It’s the truth. When Jim Henson offered Caine the role, he replied: “I’m going to play this movie like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I will never wink, I will never do anything Muppety. I am going to play Scrooge as if it is an utterly dramatic role and there are no puppets around me.” That juxtaposition inspires me to this day.\n\nJim Henson died unexpectedly in the spring of 1990. He appeared with Kermit on the Arsenio Hall show, and afterward complained of a sore throat. He would be dead ten days later. The official cause of death was organ dysfunction resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (i.e. Group-A Strep) after 20 hours in the ICU at New York Hospital. Some believe it was Henson’s background in Christian Science that caused him to refuse medical treatment until it was too late. But Henson himself remarked during the week before his death, “I feel like this is going to go away.” His untimely departure from this life shocked the world.\n\nJim Henson’s legacy lives on in the vast contribution he made to the world of entertainment and media. It also lives on the Frizzell household as I will watch The Muppet Christmas Carol every December until I myself depart from this world.\n\nA word of wisdom: The time we have between the dash is too short. Don’t waste your life. Seek Jesus and settle the question of where you’ll spend eternity before it’s too late. Live to serve others. Be peaceful and gentle and kind."
