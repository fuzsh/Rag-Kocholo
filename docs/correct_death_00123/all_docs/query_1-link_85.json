        "text": "The handsome mid-century home once owned by Muppets creator Jim Henson has gone on sale for $1.2 million and buyers are being lured in with the idea of living next to a few A-listers.\n\nBruce Willis, Catherine Zeta Jones, Martha Stewart and Blake Lively are just a few of the celebrities who own houses near the thoroughly renovated 3,843-square-foot home that once belonged to the late, great puppeteer.\n\nBuilt in 1969, the magnificent five-bedroom and three-and-a-half bathroom abode sits on nearly two acres of woodlands.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe residence features airy interiors with floor to ceiling windows that look out to a wide deck, heated pool, and dense gardens and woods.\n\nThe home also includes a chefâ€™s kitchen, a master suite with a sunken tub and a fireplace inside.\n\nIt's the perfect spot for hosting summer parties, as it also features an outdoor fireplace on the deck.\n\nThe current owners have thoroughly renovated the home, which also boasts a generous living and dining area that is highlighted by massive stone walls.\n\nThe sophisticated residence has well-proportioned, spacious rooms that have bright natural light coming from both the windows and skylights that are located throughout the home.\n\nHenson, who was a comic, writer, producer and actor, lived in the house before his death at age 53.\n\nHe used the expansive space as a hideaway from the chaotic New York City and would take walks to relax from his often times busy schedule.\n\nThe master puppeteer also worked on Saturday Night Live and Sesame Street, but is famed for his work on the cult classic films The Dark Crystal and the Muppet movies."
