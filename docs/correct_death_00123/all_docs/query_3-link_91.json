        "text": "Kermit the Frog, American television puppet character, a featured figure among a group of highly articulated hand puppets called Muppets who were part of the long-running children’s television program Sesame Street and the prime-time comedy and variety series The Muppet Show (1976–81), as well as in numerous videos, video games, and motion pictures.\n\nStanding for Everyman, Kermit worked as a news reporter on Sesame Street, where he strove to bring a serious perspective to the farcical events taking place around him. On The Muppet Show, where he was the harried producer of a fictitious show-within-a-show, his patience and composure were constantly tested by the unfunny comedian Fozzie Bear, the clownish and unpredictable Gonzo, and, most of all, the relentlessly amorous Miss Piggy.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nThe Muppets Trivia Quiz\n\nPuppeteer Jim Henson introduced Kermit in 1955 on Sam and Friends, a local Washington, D.C., television show, but the character became famous only in 1969 after he was seen on the fledgling Sesame Street. Beneath the character’s familiar green felt was a foam-rubber hand puppet whose arms and legs were controlled by thin rods. Until his death in 1990, Henson provided the voice and the movement for Kermit. Thereafter, Kermit was voiced by Steve Whitmore."
