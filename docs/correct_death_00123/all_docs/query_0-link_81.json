        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- \"From a very early age he had the feeling that he was here for a purpose.\"\n\nThat line is from the official trailer for \"Jim Henson Idea Man.\"\n\nHenson is the creator of \"Sesame Street,\" \"The Muppets\" and so many iconic characters that have touched the lives of children (and adults) worldwide.\n\nThe film is directed by Academy Award winner Ron Howard and was done with the full participation and cooperation of the Henson family.\n\nIt uses never-before-seen personal archival photos, videos and sketches and interviews with those who knew him best to tell Henson's story.\n\nIn the trailer, actress Jennifer Connelly, who starred in Henson's 1986 film \"Labrynth,\" says \"The space he gave to an expression of imagination, I see that in everything that he did.\"\n\nHenson died in 1990 at the age of 53 but his legacy lives on.\n\nYou can see \"Jim Henson Idea Man\" when it premieres May 31 on Disney+."
