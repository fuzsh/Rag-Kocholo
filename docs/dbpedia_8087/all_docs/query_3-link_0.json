        "text": "A silvery-grey tower amongst the trees\n\nStanding in a churchyard edged with trees, this beautiful Medieval church was built largely in the fourteenth century.\n\nThe tower is of Lincolnshire limestone built in the Perpendicular style, but the rest of the church is largely built of local ironstone.\n\nThe interior was tastefully restored in the Victorian era - look for the nineteenth-century altar screen with its Crucifixion painting.\n\nFollowing funding success from the Heritage Stimulus Fund, essential work to the roof has now been completed and the church has been reopened for visitors.\n\nA maternity colony of Natterers Bats roosts in the church during the summer months, along with Brown Eared Bats that are also known to roost inside the church. The bats cause a significant ammount of mess within the church, especially during the bat breeding season."
