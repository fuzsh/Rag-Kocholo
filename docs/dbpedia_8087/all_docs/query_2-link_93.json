The derivation is from the old English pre 7th Century \"torr\" translating variously as \"a high rock, rocky peak or hill\", ultimately from the Celtic \"tor\", a prominence or mountain. The second possibility is that the name derives from the old French \"tor\", a bull, and originally given as a nickname to a strong powerfully built man. John le Tor, recorded in the 1240 \"Pipe Rolls of Oxfordshire\", derives his name from this source. The recordings from the former source include Martin de la Torre, (Devonshire, 1242) and Walter atte Torre, (Sussex, 1296). Early bearers of the name in Scotland were Matthew de Torre who witnesses a transaction in St. Andrews, (1288), and Thomas de la Tour of Ayrshire who rendered homage in 1296. The old lands of Torr in Fife were named from the Celtic element \"tor\", and some Torrs may hail from this spot. William Torr, (1808 - 1874), agriculturist, gained a reputation as a live-stock judge in England and abroad. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Robert de Torra, which was dated 1182, \"The Pipe Rolls of Cornwall\", during the reign of King Henry 11, \"The Builder of Churches\", 1154 - 1189. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to \"develop\" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling. [1] We can be even more specific. The name is found, in Lincolnshire, to have originated on the Isle of Axholme. The Isle, a high piece of land formerly surrounded by three rivers (the Don, the Trent and the Idle, and on the fourth by swampland, is a fine example of a Celtic ‘tor’. [2]\n\nMuch of the northern part of the Isle has flat topography, with rich farmland used mainly to grow wheat and sugar beet. The land is particularly fertile due to its history of annual flooding from the Trent and peat soil which was created by dense ancient woodland which covered much of the Isle. Even today, in many parts of the northern Isle, petrified wood can be found at about 6ft below ground which is a relic from this woodland, locally called \"Bog oaks\".\n\nA long-distance walking route, the \"Peatlands Way\" traverses the Isle. Etymology Axholme means \"island by Haxey\", from the town name + Old Norse holmr \"island\". The name was recorded as Hakirhomle in 1196. (The Old English suffix \"ey\" in \"Haxey\" also indicates an island).\n\nThe site for the Isle of Axholme gives us a lot of information on the Isle. At the time of enclosure of the lands in the Isle of Axholme, in the early nineteenth century, there were eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Isle consisting of : Althorpe, Belton, Crowle, Epworth, Haxey, Luddington, Owston and Wroot. During the mid-nineteenth century four of the original parishes were divided up to create four new parishes, giving us the twelve parishes we have today. The new parishes were: West Butterwick created from part of Owston. (1841) Amcotts created from part of Althorpe. (1850) Eastoft created from part of Crowle. (1855) Garthorpe created from part of Luddington. (1866) This website is based on these twelve parishes.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Read more: http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Torr#ixzz2alwamAk7\n\n↑ Wikipedia says: The name Isle is given to the area since, prior to the area being drained by the Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden, each town or village formerly lay on areas of dry, raised ground in the surrounding marshland. The River Don used to flow to the north and west (it has since been diverted), dividing the Isle from Yorkshire, the River Idleseparates the Isle from Nottinghamshire and the River Trent separates the Isle from the rest of the county. There are three small towns: Epworth – birthplace of John Wesley and his brother Charles – Crowle and Haxey. Other settlements on the Isle include Garthorpe, Luddington, Eastoft, Belton, Sandtoft – home to Europe's largest Trolleybus museum – Westwoodside, Wroot and Owston Ferry.\n\n(1) http://www.lincstothepast.com/Records/RecordDisplayTranscript.aspx?oid=515925&iid=42837\n\n(2) https://www.freereg.org.uk/search_records/58189f60e93790ec8bd4465f?search_id=5a6a76324325a6c66d6210e3&ucf=false\n\n(3) http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Torr#ixzz2alwamAk7\n\n(4) familysearch.org\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFirst-hand information as remembered by E Smith, Monday, July 14, 2014."
