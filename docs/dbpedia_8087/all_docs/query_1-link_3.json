        "text": "Garthorpe Church\n\nSt. Mary’s Church in Garthorpe is served by a small but dedicated congregation. The Church is designated as a “Festival” Church, which means that the building can be used for a variety of community purposes, as well as offering a venue for baptisms, weddings and funerals. It is also a location for special “festival” events such as harvest, carols, songs of praise, mission activities etc.\n\nWe warmly invite you to come and join us and find out more about our journey and the Christian way of life in today’s world. We welcome all, young and not so young, and at all stages of faith (including ‘not so sure’)."
