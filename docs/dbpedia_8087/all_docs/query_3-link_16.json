We have attempted to fill some gaps in the parish registers with bishop's transcripts however, some registers have been completely lost. Many small settlements are chapelries of adjacent, larger parishes, and their baptisms, marriages, and burials are not ‘lost’ but are instead recorded in the registers of the ‘mother’ church. In the lists below, every parish displays a year range fo the records available; however, gaps may appear within that year range and we cannot guarantee a record for every year.\n\nDeficient parishes are as follows:"
