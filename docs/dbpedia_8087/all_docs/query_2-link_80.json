        "text": "18 May to 29 June\n\nKaleidoscope is the collective name for a swarm of butterflies. Our butterfly themed Kaleidoscope exhibition is a showcase of all the different creative groups and communities that we work with here at 20-21.\n\nWe have included everyone: adults and children; professional artists and amateur enthusiasts; schools, community groups and other outreach workshops. We asked everyone to create their own butterfly using our special template and return them to 20-21 where they became part of a huge kaleidoscopic and colourful swarm of butterflies in the gallery.\n\nThe response has been incredible with well over 3,500 butterflies on display here in the gallery.\n\nButterflies are essential to the health of the world’s ecosystem, and provide a wide range of environmental benefits, including pollination and natural pest control. 56 species of butterfly in Britain and Ireland are under threat today from environmental change. The endangered Large Heath butterfly has made its home in the Isle of Axholme, the only part of Lincolnshire it inhabits. The shape of the Large Heath butterfly has been replicated in the templates for this exhibition, albeit at a larger size, to try to gain more public awareness of this endangered butterfly. Participants have been encouraged to think about how they can work together towards a better and healthier future.\n\nLinking in with Kaleidoscope, 20-21 Visual Arts Centre is hosting free drop-in events that are suitable for young and old. Create a butterfly mobile, learn about how to grow a butterfly friendly garden, or make a butterfly feeder. Go to our Fundays and Events page to find out more about special these events and activities.\n\nKaleidoscope was created by over 3,500 participants including:\n\n1st Frodingham Brownies\n\nAlthorpe and Keadby Primary School\n\nArtists and members of the public\n\nBaysgarth School\n\nBerkeley Primary School\n\nBottesford Infant School\n\nBowmandale Primary School\n\nBrigg Primary School\n\nBrigg Wellbeing Hub & Do Something Different\n\nBroughton Primary School\n\nCaistor CofE and Methodist Primary School\n\nCaistor Rainbows\n\nConeygarth Farm Day Nursery\n\nDramarama\n\nEpworth Primary Academy\n\nFrodingham Infant School\n\nGunness and Burringham CofE Primary School\n\nIsle of Axholme and Hatfield Chase Landscape Partnership\n\nKirton Lindsey Primary School\n\nLincoln Gardens Primary School\n\nLuddington and Garthorpe Primary School\n\nMelior Community Academy\n\nNorth Lincolnshire Museum\n\nNorth Lindsey College\n\nOld Brumby United Methodist Church Childrens Club\n\nOld Brumby United Methodist Church Ladies Group\n\nPanda Play Playgroup, Winterton\n\nScunthorpe CofE Primary School\n\nSt Mark’s Community Group\n\nSt. Augustine Webster Catholic Voluntary Academy\n\nSt. Peter and St. Paul CofE Primary School, Scunthorpe\n\nSt. Peter and St. Paul Catholic Voluntary Academy, Lincoln\n\nStarlight Arts\n\nStick and Splodge Group\n\nU3A Group, Ashby\n\nWalkeringham Primary School\n\nWinterton CofE Infants’ School\n\nWinterton Community Academy\n\nWrawby St. Mary’s CofE Primary School\n\nAnd supported by:\n\nIsle of Axholme and Hatfield Chase Landscape Partnership\n\nSt Mark’s Community Group\n\nEngineering UTC Northern Lincolnshire\n\nCharlie & Jane’s Craft Co."
