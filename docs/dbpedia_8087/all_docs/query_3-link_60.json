Members are invited to attend the monthly meetings and enter into discussion of the topics raised by speakers and other members. Members are encouraged to engage in study, individually or collectively, of their local history and to record for posterity what is discovered. This study may include oral, printed, pictorial and documentary information. We are an informal group who meet monthly to exchange information and advice, review progress and share knowledge relating to and arising from our personal research projects. Founded in 2000 the group has produced several publications and continues to build a comprehensive database of information about the history of the town, much of which is available on the website. We welcome new members and ask people who have relevant deeds and documents to deposit them for safety or at least allow copies to be made of them. Members are encouraged to make use of local sources especially those available at Uppingham Library, Rutland Museum and the Leicestershire Record Office. Members are currently working on town properties of particular personal interest, a survey of the churchyard, the Methodist Church, town shops and C18th Uppingham within the context of the production of a comprehensive history of the town. It is cooperating with the Uppingham Town Council on the Heritage Trail and other projects.\n\nHistory of Uppingham - A Principal Town of Rutland by 1800. Written by Vivian Anthony. Published September 2015 This small settlement on a plateau above the Eyebrook Valley underwent a transformation into one of the principal towns in the county of Rutland. It saw off the challenges of Ridlington and Lyddington and came to rival Oakham in size and importance. Uppingham benefited from the involvement of the De Montfort family in its planned development after the Kingâs charter for markets and fairs was acquired in 1281. It survived wave after wave of invasions and settlement. The Corieltauvi tribe got on with the Romans; and successive invaders made their way up the Welland Valley and settled around its tributaries. Over time the area known as Rutland developed its identity and eventually its special position as part of the dower granted to the Queen. In the absence of great lords to determine the way forward, various lesser gentry, yeoman farmers and tradesmen gave the lead. In times of religious conflict, with the Rector commonly an absentee, it was the churchwardens and curates who usually made the pace. Almost everyone in the community was connected in some way with the land and all were affected when enclosure and the other elements of the Agricultural Revolution came to Uppingham late in the 18th century. Occasionally social discontent spilled over and a rebellion was planned but whatever the problems posed by the poor and dispossessed Uppingham was largely a peaceful and prosperous place as reflected in the fine Georgian buildings which remain to this day.

Click here to download Professor Alan Rogers draws on his wide academic knowledge to look at this old market town, explaining why and how it started, then developed as it did and what influence events had upon the buildings, layout and townscape. Perhaps his most surprising conclusion is that it all started with a fifth century Saxon farmstead on the North South footpath close to today's Crown Inn and had little to do with the East West route between Stamford and Leicester until later. After considering what might have existed here at Domesday, Alan Rogers discusses evidence for a planned medieval town then discusses surviving Tudor, Georgian and Victorian features and the people whose influence shaped the town at each of these periods.

What were the origins of this splendid Georgian Town? Dr Vivian Anthony, the author and Chairman of the Uppingham Local History Study Group, will explain. The Book provides an illustrated story of how a small settlement on a plateau above the Eyebrook Valley underwent a transformation outgrowing other villages to become a leading market town in the county of Rutland. The township saw off the challenges of Ridlington and Lyddington and came to rival Oakham in size and importance. While Uppingham benefited from the interest and involvement of the De Montfort family in its planned development after the Kingâs charter for markets and fairs was acquired in 1281, it had had to survive the turbulent history of the region in the centuries before the Normans. The tale is told of how Uppingham and its environs survived wave after wave of invasions and settlement; how the resident Corieltauvi tribe got on with the Romans; and how successive invaders made their way up the Welland Valley and later settled around its tributaries. For centuries the fortunes of the lesser kingdoms to which Uppingham paid tribute waxed and waned but over time the area known as Rutland developed its identity and eventually its special position as part of the dower granted to the Queen. As the main settlement in the Hundred of Martinsley, Uppinghamâs story is partly about the services it offered to surrounding habitations particularly through its markets and inns. In the absence of great lords to determine the way forward, various lesser gentry, yeoman farmers and tradesmen gave the lead. The part played by churchmen, not least in times of religious conflict, makes interesting reading. With the Rector commonly an absentee, it was the churchwardens and curates who usually made the pace. The history benefits from archives rich in material from the Court Rolls of the principal manors â Rectory and Uppingham with Preston â and the notes provided by Archdeacon Irons and Canon Clowes; much has been analysed by the Uppingham Local History Study Group. The founding and development of one of the nationâs leading schools by Archdeacon Johnson is a fascinating theme, and that of his almshouses is another. All this is set firmly in the context of land ownership and farming; almost everyone in the community was connected in some way with the land and all were affected when enclosure and the other elements of the Agricultural Revolution came to Uppingham late in the 18th century. Occasionally social discontent spilled over and a rebellion was planned but whatever the problems posed by the poor and dispossessed Uppingham was largely a peaceful and prosperous place as reflected in the fine Georgian buildings which remain to this day.

One or two Directories covering Rutland were produced before 1800, but generally they become common after Pigot's Directory of 1827. Copies, but not complete runs, are held in the main reference libraries at Leicester and Northampton, at ROLLR and NRO and at the Rutland County Museum Oakham. See also Matkin's Almanack (Oakham) and Hawthorne's Almanack (Uppingham) for information about traders and shopkeepers. 11. Electoral Rolls list names of all those eligible to vote in elections including names of adult children, as well as the address or location where they lived. Libraries will have copies of current Voters Rolls. At different times the Rutland Constituency has been joined with both Stamford and with Melton. Copies of previous rolls are difficult to locate, but some at least should be found at ROLLR, and perhaps in central reference libraries at Leicester, Melton Mowbray and Stamford. The Lincolnshire Record Office should be consulted also. 12. Property Records are a fruitful source of information about people. Besides giving family links for inheritance purposes, they provide information also about people's occupations and the extent of their ownerships. See ULHSG' s companion fact sheet listing locally available sources \"Sources at the Record Office identifying ownership of properties in Uppingham\".\n\nFor much of the period covered by this Register there were two Ministers, nearly always resident in Oakham, âstationedâ, in the Oakham Circuit. The circuit also included a part of East Leicestershire. There were chapels in most Rutland villages holding several services, or classes a week. Ministers travelled the circuit (on foot in the early days) staying away from home for several days at a time. Most chapels did not have individual Registers until after the amalgamation of all branches of Methodism in 1932. All Baptisms were therefore entered in the Circuit Register. An earlier Register from 1816â1837 is available in the Record Office for Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland. The Register holds Baptism entries for the following villages: Ashwell Harringworth, Northants Ridlington Barleythorpe Knossington Rolleston Barrow Langham Sewstern Bilsden, Leics Leesthorpe, Melton Skeffington, Leics Braunston Liddington/Lyddington Somerby, Leics Burley Loddington, Leics Stoke Dry Cold Overton, Leics Loseby/Lowesby, Leics Thorpe by Water Cottesmore Lyndon Tilton on the Hill, Leics East Norton Manton Tugby, Leics Egleton Marefield, Leics Twyford, Leics Garthorpe Morcott Uppingham Glaston Newbold nr Somerby Whatborough, Tilton Gretton North Kilworth Whissendine Halstead, Leics Oakham Wing Hambleton, Lower & Nether Pickwell Withcote Preston Wymondham There are also a few other out of area addresses.

(RID) This is recommended reading for anyone exploring the origins or existence of nonconformist chapels and meeting houses in Uppingham. Most of the information below has been taken from this publication. Where records exist, most can be found in the Record Office of Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutland (ROLLR), Lincoln Archives and Northamptonshire Record Office. Some records are also held at the Rutland County Museum. âRIDâ lists six known chapels or meeting houses in Uppingham spanning the middle of the seventeenth century until the present day. Of these six, only one, the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel (now the Uppingham Methodist Church) is still in existence, although a further three existed within living memory. In chronological order of foundation, the known chapels or meeting houses of Uppingham are listed below: Baptist There is evidence of a Baptist cause in Uppingham from the middle of the seventeenth century, but the first known building was registered in 1829 and is recorded in the Religious Census of 1851. A little of the history is noted in RID, but no records are known to have survived. Congregational Church (formerly Ebenezer Chapel) This originated out of the Presbyterian cause which started in Uppingham in 1672. Various barns, cottages or rooms were registered for worship prior to the building of the chapel in 1814. This housed a large and influential congregation until the mid twentieth century when it began to decline. The church building has now been converted to dwellings, but the manse alongside is still used as Uppingham Congregational House Church. A transcript of the Baptism Register from 1785 to 1837 is available for purchase from the publications page of this website and an unpublished history of the church can be found in Rutland County Museum and at ROLLR. Uppingham Methodist Church (formerly Wesleyan Methodist Chapel) The Methodist Church has existed on the same site since 1819 and is now the only nonconformist place of worship in Uppingham. The history of the chapel has been widely researched by Margaret Stacey, and three publications are available for downloading on our publications page. Also available is the history of the Drake family of Uppingham Methodist Church; the story of the Reverend George William Clutterbuck and biographical details of the Ladies of the Uppingham Sisterhood in 1931. Extensive records are available at ROLLR including the two Oakham Circuit Baptism Registers containing Uppingham entries from 1818 to 1837. Access the 1837 to 1944 Register on our site. Other sources for Methodist research include the Dictionary of Methodism and the Methodist Collections at John Rylands Library, Manchester. Margaret Stacey can be contacted via email for more information on Uppingham Methodist Church. Protestant Dissenters âRIDâ gives details of two properties being registered as places of dissenting worship in 1777 and 1824. Other than the names on the documents nothing further is known of these causes. Bethesda Chapel This building, in Orange Street was registered for dissenting worship in 1845 and became a Strict Baptist Chapel, existing until about 1960. An unpublished history of the building can be found in Rutland County Museum and at ROLLR. Uppingham Plymouth Brethen Meeting House Plymouth Brethren met in Hopeâs Yard from 1870 until the middle of the twentieth century. Details of the building can be found in an unpublished history of Hopeâs Yard which is available in Rutland County Museum and at ROLLR. Rutland Nonconformist Chapels and Meetings by Nigel Webb provides photographs and commentary on many of the chapels. ++++ Non Conformity in Uppingham - Notes from a presentation given by Margaret Stacey\n\nThe Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul has two graveyards: the upper graveyard which surrounds the church, steeply sloping to the south, and the lower graveyard lying on the south side of South View. The town also has two cemeteries: the Lawn Cemetery which lies on the west side of London Road and dates from the 1950âs, and the Leicester Road Cemetery which lies on the northern boundary of the town on the east side of Leicester Road and dates from 2008. Uppingham Local History Studies Group (ULHSG) recorded various parts of the two graveyards between the years 2000 â 2013. The various recordings have now been brought together to provide a complete database. Tribute must be paid to the late Miss Audrey Day who collected together much of the material shortly before her sudden death in 2012. It should be noted that since the original data was collected, some of the stones have deteriorated, fallen over, or are covered in ivy so that the inscriptions are now unreadable. The group cannot claim accuracy in the transcribing, but has felt it right to make the information available at this stage. For accuracy, burials can be checked in the Burial Registers of the church which are held at the: Record Office for Leicestershire, Leicester and Rutlandor on microfiche/film at Rutland County Museum.\n\nSome of the detailed information has been obtained from websites and again, for complete accuracy the Burial Registers should be consulted. ULHSG would be pleased to hear of any corrections or additional information and may sometimes be able to give further information on persons listed. If you are searching for an ancestor and cannot find the person, remember that there have been burials recorded in this churchyard since 1571, and unrecorded burials much earlier. Many stones cannot now be read or have disappeared. We are grateful to David Morgan, descendant of the Drake family for allowing the use of his document:- The Headstones & Graves of the Drake Stonemasons & Their Families\n\nThe Upper Graveyard (Churchyard) This survey was carried out by different groups of people over several years, and for different purposes. Therefore some entries will be fuller than others. The detail is largely in its original note form. The starting point for the survey was the research needed for Uppingham in 1851 published by ULHSG in 2001 and consequently many of the notes refer to the 1851 census. NB there is a small Garden of Rest on the south side of the church containing 20th century floor tablets commemorating cremations. These have not been recorded. Similarly, funerary monuments and graves within the church will be added at a later date. How to use the Upper Graveyard database 1. Go first to the Upper Churchyard Index and search for the surname required. 2. In the far right column you will find an area number, possibly a sub area number and a grave number. 3. Go then to the Details of Upper Graveyard and find the area, then the grave which will give you any additional details known. Abbreviations used in Upper Graveyard details, most are self explanatory e.g. Jan, Feb, Mar, use of\n\nbrackets, question marks etc. 1851 usually refers to detail from 1851 census n.b. entered in 1841 census as ânot born this countyâ SV refers to a stone(s) in the Lower Graveyard South View area freebmd the freebmd website b.m.d. baptism or birth, marriage, death. Unless noted otherwise, all recorded deaths are known or assumed to have been in Uppingham IGI International Genealogical Index qtr, dist quarter and district, terms used in the General Registers of Birth, Marriage and Death If you are visiting the churchyard the Upper Graveyard Plan is an approximate finding guide. The areas equate to those in the index and in the details but it has not been possible to site graves more exactly than this. The numerical order within plots may be of help but it is largely a question of searching within the areas. +++++++ The Lower Graveyard The data here consists of one list. Any details known are recorded with the name. There is no plan available for this graveyard, but generally, older graves are at the top (South View end) and more recent burials at the bottom. +++++++ The Upper and Lower Lawn Cemeteries This consists of two plans with numbered plots and names and is self explanatory. +++++++ The Leicester Road Cemetery This consists of a plan with numbered plots and is self explanatory. This is an open cemetery and the plan is correct at 2013.\n\n?
