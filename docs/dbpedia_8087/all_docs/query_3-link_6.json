        "text": "A brass plaque, engraved with the names of the dead of Garthorpe and Fockerby in the First World War and Second World War, and which used to hang in Garthorpe Methodist Chapel until it’s closure, now hangs in St Mary the Virgin Church on Shore Rd. Garthorpe and forms the focal point for a thriving memorial service, every year in November. The names on it are traditional names, once common in Garthorpe, but are in decline, three of the five having become ‘extinct’ and the remaining two are ‘endangered’."
