        "text": "Ancient, Veteran & Notable Trees\n\nMissing help text - to be added by an administrator\n\nChurchyards are home to fantastic trees, in particular ancient and veteran trees which can be the oldest indication of a sacred space and be features of extraordinary individuality. The UK holds a globally important population of ancient and veteran yew trees of which three-quarters are found in the churchyards of England and Wales.\n\nThere are more than 1,000 ancient and veteran yews aged at least 500 years in these churchyards.\n\nTo put this in context, the only other part of western Europe with a known significant yew population is Normandy in northern France, where more than 100 ancient or veteran churchyard yews have been recorded.\n\nBurial grounds may contain veteran and ancient trees of other species such as sweet chestnut or small-leaved lime which, whilst maybe not so old as the yews, are still important for wildlife and may be home to many other species.\n\nSpecialist advice is needed when managing these wonderful trees. For more information or to seek advice please contact Caring for God’s Acre, The Ancient Yew Group and The Woodland Trust.\n\nIf you know of an ancient or veteran tree in a burial ground that is not listed here please contact Caring for God’s Acre.\n\nAll of the species listed below have been recorded in close proximity to the Festival Church . A few species which are particularly threatened and affected by disturbance may not be listed here because their exact location cannot be shared.\n\nNOTE: Be aware that this dataset is growing, and the species totals may change once the National Biodiversity Network has added further records. Species may be present but not recorded and still await discovery.\n\nCategoryTotal species recorded to date TOTAL NUMBER OF SPECIES RECORDED 0 Total number of animal species 0 Total number of plant species 0 Total number of mammal species 0 Total number of birds 0 Total number of amphibian and reptile species 0 Total number of invertebrate species 0 Total number of fungi species 0 Total number of mosses and liverworts (bryophytes) 0 Total number of ferns 0 Total number of flowering plants 0 Total number of Gymnosperm and Ginkgo 0\n\nCaring for God’s Acre is a conservation charity working to support groups and individuals to investigate, care for, and enjoy the wildlife and heritage treasures found within churchyards and other burial grounds. Look on their website for information and advice and please contact their staff directly. They can help you manage this churchyard for people and wildlife.\n\nTo learn more about all of the species recorded against this church, go to the Burial Ground Portal within the NBN Atlas. You can check the spread of records through the years, discovering what has been recorded and when, plus what discoveries might remain to be uncovered.\n\nIf any of the following species have been seen close to the Festival Church, it is important to seek advice from an expert. You will need to know if they are present now, and to follow expert recommendations when planning works. All of these species have specific legal protection as a recognition of their rarity. All of them are rare or becoming increasingly endangered, so it is important to ensure that management and other works do not adversely affect them. In addition, there may be things you can do to help these special species. N.B. Swift and House Martin do not have specific legal protection but are included, as roof repair works often impact breeding swifts and house martins which is against the law.\n\nThis is not a complete list of protected species, there are many more, but these are ones that are more likely to be found. All wild birds, their nests and eggs are also protected by law, as are all bats and veteran trees. In a few cases, species are considered particularly prone to disturbance or destruction by people, so the exact location of where they were recorded is not publicly available but can be requested. These ‘blurred’ records are included here, and the accuracy is to 1km. This means that the species has been recorded in close proximity to the Festival Church, or a maximum of 1km away from it. As these ‘blurred’ species are quite mobile, there is a strong likelihood that they can occur close to the Festival Church. To learn about these special species, use the link provided for each species in the table below\n\nOne important species which is not included here is the Peregrine Falcon. This is protected and advice should be sought if peregrines are nesting on a church or cathedral. Peregrine records are ‘blurred’ to 10km, hence the decision not to include records here. Remember too that species not seriously threatened nationally may still be at risk in your region and be sensitive to works. You should check with local experts about this. You may also need to seek advice about invasive species, such as Japanese knotweed and aquatics colonising streams or pools, which can spread in churchyards.\n\nN.B. If a species is not recorded this does not indicate absence. It is always good practice to survey.\n\nNo species data found for this record\n\nCaring for God’s Acre can help and support you in looking after the biodiversity present in this special place. If you know that any of these species occur close to the Festival Church and are not recorded here, please contact Caring for God’s Acre with details (info@cfga.org.uk).\n\nTo find out more about these and other species recorded against this Festival Church, go to the Burial Ground Portal within the NBN Atlas."
