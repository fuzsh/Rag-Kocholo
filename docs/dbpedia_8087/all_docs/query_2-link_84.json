        "text": "Luddington is one of the eight original parishes in the Isle of Axholme in the far northwest corner of Lincolnshire. Crowle parish lies 5 miles to the south-west and Scunthorpe is 10 miles south-east. The parish covers about 3,700 acres and inlcudes the township of Garthorpe.\n\nLuddington was once a river island, having the Meredyke on the south, the Trent on the east and the Don on the north and west. At the time it was the most northern parish in the Isle of Axholme. If you are planning a visit:\n\nBy automobile, take the B1392 secondary road north out of Althorpe.\n\nStop by the Village Hall, here photographed by Jon CLARK on Geo-graph, taken in October, 2005. Ask for a schedule of forth-coming events.\n\nVisit our touring page for more sources.\n\nDavid WRIGHT has a photograph of the 1939-1945 Roll of Honour on Geo-graph, taken in July, 2007.\n\nLuddington churchyard has one Commonwealth War Grave from World War II:\n\nJohn JACKLIN, lance srgt., Colstream Guards, age 31, died 6 Dec. 1944.
