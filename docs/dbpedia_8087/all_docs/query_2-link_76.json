From one or both marriages, Sir Ralph had five sons. The eldest, William, married Anne Norwich and had one daughter, Margaret. Of the sons, only John and Robert had children. Much of the family's land and property was inherited by Margaret and her descendants. (See section below). Their second son:\n\nSir Robert Woodford (b.1460) .m. Alice Gate of Burnham, Bucks.

Elizabeth may have been the daughter of either Peter or Paul Wentworth (brothers) who were imprisoned in the Tower of London due to their Puritan sympathies. One record gives Elizabeth living in 1615 because she is mentioned in her mother's will of that date.]\n\nRobert's son:\n\nRobert Woodford (d.1574) .m. Elizabeth Wymond (1515-1576).

George John Butt (1926-2018) They had one son and one daughter (Jan). Their son:\n\nStephen Butt is owner of this website.\n\nThe Dispersal from Leicestershire\n\nAfter the death of Ralph Woodforde in 1498 and the loss of much of the family's land through Margaret Woodford's marriages, the Woodford family's strength and prosperity waned. Ralph's second son, Matthew, married Lucy Brooksby and there is no evidence that he had any children. Ralph's fourth son, Robert, married Alice Gates and moved to his wife's manor of Britwell in Buckinghamshire.\n\nThe youngest son, Thomas, married Jane Neville, and is also said to have died without issue. Nichols states that of Ralph's five sons, Matthew and Thomas died without issue and only William and John had issue in Leicestershire.\n\nThe family line in Leicestershire therefore became the children of Ralph's third son, John. He was first married to Millicent Markham, who died childless, and secondly to Mary Jerningham from which marriage there were three sons and two daughters. The family moved to the area of Muston in Leicestershire where their descendants can be found today. According to Ian Payne, at least one Woodford family remained in Ashby Folville and existed from the early 16th century, later as tenants of the Babingtons at their manor of Rothley. It is likely that John, Ralph's son, was the same John Woodford who was `of Ashby' and taxed on goods worth £46 in the Lay Subsidy of 1524 and came to the Babington's manorial court at Rothley in 1526 having purchased a messuage and 20 acres of land in Barsby, begging leave to be admitted a tenant.\n\nHowever, it is important to note from Ralph's will that by the time of his death, Ralph had given lands to all three of his younger sons. E. Acheson suggests that this would indicate that each of these sons therefore possessed independent establishments.\n\nDavid Baldwin, in his research into the Hastings family in the Midlands, found references to a William Woodford who died in 1487 as a retainer of William Hastings and to a John Woodford who was a feed man of his son Edward Hastings. William Hastings retainers also include John Turvill of Thurlaston (d.1506). This William Woodford's inquisition post mortem (Calendar Henry VII, col.1.p.147) shows that he died seised of the manors of `Brantyngby, Wyfordby, Frethby, and Garthorp' worth £20 per annum on 28 July 1487. This William could be one of the sons of the John who was the son of Ralph Woodford."
