Monumental Inscriptions, Cemeteries and Graveyards of Lincolnshire

'

Image right - Middle Rasen St Peter & St Paul.

The aim of this project is to gather together information regarding cemeteries and graveyards in the county which either have available transcriptions or have been photographed and transcribed.

Please update the project by adding links to any available monumental inscriptions or pages where images of the graves/cemeteries can be seen - mostly Billion Graves or Find a Grave.

Please do not link profiles to this project - its purpose is to inform!

Those links with records have no ✘ (blank, or the number of entries in some instances).

To participate in any project

- you do need to first be a collaborator or collaborating with a collaborator- so please join the project using the request link under "actions" at the top right of the page. Visit Geni Wikitext, Unicode and images which gives a great deal of assistance.
