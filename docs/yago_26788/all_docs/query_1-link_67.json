        "text": "Marriage\n\nWeddings of imperial women recognised as political event\n\nWeddings arranged for political, social or business reasons :. Power kept within hand of limited families\n\nMarriage to Domitius Ahenobarbus\n\nAgrippina 13 y/o, Tiberius arranged for her to marry Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (good background and wealth) “…a man who was in every aspect of life utterly detestable” – Suetonius\n\nHe was well known for both violence and cruelty\n\nKept a low profile during the last years of Tiberius’ reign due to the suffering experienced by members of her family, largely at the hands of Sejanus\n\nMarriage -> Nero’s birth\n\nNero born 9 months after death of Tiberius – maybe she delayed conception until she was free from the threat of Tiberius\n\nHer first choice for her next marriage was Galba but she was unsuccessful “nobody could interest him in a second match, not even Agrippina” – Suetonius\n\nHer first marriage was to Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus in AD28.\n\nThis was arranged by Tiberius as was the standard practice in Rome.\n\nHe was consul in AD32 and was related to Augustus through his mother Antonia Major.\n\nHe died while she was in exile.\n\nHe gave her status as a married woman.\n\nHe was friendly with Tiberius and therefore she was ‘protected’ by the intrigues of Sejanus who had effectively removed her mother and 2 elder brothers.\n\nAhenobarbus was by all accounts a ‘man utterly detestable’ (Tacitus) – therefore was the marriage a ‘punishment’?\n\nIt gave her a son – Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (later called Nero) who was born 9 months after the death of Tiberius.\n\nIt protected her from Messalina (wife of Claudius) who saw her as a threat because:\n\nShe was incredibly popular\n\nShe also had a son to promote who was 4 years older than Brittanicus her own son.\n\nIt provided her with:\n\nLegitimacy as a Roman matron\n\nStability for herself and Nero (he had to grow up!)\n\nIncredible wealth as she inherited it all when he died\n\nLeadbetter argues that Crispus was the son of Livia’s confidante – a ‘keeper of secrets’ – and therefore she may have had access to some of this information about prominent Romans.\n\nQuick to take advantage of situation\n\nWithin 3 months they were married\n\nClaudius was granted a special dispensation from the senate, which legitimised his marriage\n\nEach of Claudius’ advisors supported a different woman for him to marry\n\nAgrippina was recommended by Pallas\n\nReasons why she was chosen include:\n\nShe was available\n\nShe was of the right family background\n\nShe was fertile and still young enough to have children\n\nTacitus and Suetonius claim that as his niece, Agrippina visited Claudius frequently and used seductive behaviour to gain his affection\n\n“she had a nieces privilege of kissing and caressing Claudius, and exercised it with noticeable effect on his passion” – Suetonius\n\nmarriage between an uncle and a niece was illegal -> Lucius Vitellius convinced the senate to change the law\n\n49AD – Agrippina married Claudius\n\nClaudius gained from the marriage also\n\nHe gained the important connection into the Julian family that he had not been adopted into\n\nHe would be assured that Agrippina would not be able to use her family connection to give\n\nlegitimacy to a potential rival\n\nHolland suggests Claudius’ decision “Was taken for political reasons, to shore up his unpopular regime”\n\nOn coins and cameos this union is represented as a new beginning, with Agrippina, her parents and her son prominently featured\n\nIt was her marriage to him that enabled her to realise her ultimate ambition\n\nShe married her uncle Claudius in AD49 after the execution of Messalina.\n\nDid she seduce him into marrying her? Did she have to?\n\nMost sources will say she did as they liked to believe:\n\nClaudius was stupid\n\nShe was a manipulative woman who’d do anything to gain power BUT…\n\nLeadbetter argues against this (as does Robert Graves interestingly) where he believes that Claudius had to marry her\n\nThe ‘marriage’ of Messalina to Gaius Silius (the consul-elect) was not just a personal betrayal – it was also a politically dangerous time for Claudius as Silius was young, virile, popular – all things Claudius was not.\n\nTherefore he needed to make a political marriage that would make his position as unassailable. Marriage to Agrippina II would do this.\n\nHow?\n\nShe was very popular with the army in her own right (examine later actions as evidence of this).\n\nShe brought the Julian (and Augustan) line with her, Claudius was not descended from Augustus.\n\nShe brought Nero with her – a much more suitable candidate as heir than Brittanicus.\n\nShe was too dangerous to leave for someone else to marry.\n\nIt gave her the ultimate position for a woman in Imperial Rome – the wife of an Emperor (compare this with Livia as the only other wife and mother of an Emperor).\n\nIt helped her to promote Nero’s position and claim to the principate.\n\nShe received many honours including:\n\nShe wore a military cloak at official state functions,\n\nGreeted foreign embassies in the capacity of full imperial authority\n\nFounded and had a colony named after her where she was born\n\nAppeared prominently on coinage\n\nGiven the title ‘Augusta’ – the first living woman to get this\n\nHad her dictations recorded in official government documentation.\n\nHad Nero formally adopted by Claudius and engaged to his daughter Octavia.\n\nHad Seneca recalled (became Nero’s Tutor) and made Burrus sole prefect of the Praetorian Guard.\n\nIn essence she ‘co-ruled’ Rome with Claudius.\n\nAmbitions\n\nDudley suggests Agrippina was guided by 3 main aims:\n\nTo draw political power into her own hands\n\nTo advance her son Nero to the Principate\n\nTo remove those who stood in her way\n\nReasons for these aims include:\n\nMany members of her immediate family had been imprisoned, exiled or killed\n\nAs descendant of Augustus, daughter of Germanicus, mother to the only direct male descendant of her illustrious family she may have felt entitled to her share of the power in the dynasty\n\nBaumann suggests that Agrippina’s relationship with Lepidus was Agrippina’s idea, to overthrow Gaius and install Lepidus as ‘caretaker’ until Nero was old enough to rule\n\nEncyclopedia.com!\n\nhttp://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Agrippina_Minor.aspx\n\nExcellent Summary Source\n\nFor an essay CLICK HERE\n\nAn interesting Perspective"
