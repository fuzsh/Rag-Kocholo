        "text": "Agrippina's Death Analysis\n\n79 Words | 1 Pages\n\nThe accounts of Agrippina’s death, as narrated by Tacitus and Suetonius, take on an almost farcical tone, but eventually, according to the sources, Nero successfully killed Agrippina. Before her death, Agrippina wrote an account of her life and career, becoming the first known woman author in Roman history, as she was the only woman on record to have published her memoirs.

However, like any political system, it had cracks in the intricate system which eventually led to its downfall. Fulvia, most famously known as the wife of Mark Antony, continuously challenged the republic throughout her life using her political intelligence and tenacity which curated her ruthless reputation. It is evident through Fulvia’s actions behind the scenes of her husbands’ campaigns as well as her military campaigns in which she was openly organising, that Fulvia had a significant impact on the downfall of the republic through her defiance against the senate and her role as a woman, as well as displaying the weaknesses of the senate to the public, multiple times throughout her career. Many ancient historians have commented on Fulvia, including Plutarch, Cassius Dio, and Appian, all discussing her impact on several civil wars in Rome including her war against Octavian, the Perusine war.\n\nSulla's Influence On Julius Caesar\n\n1608 Words | 7 Pages\n\nLucius Cornelius Sulla was a prominent figure in the late republic of Ancient Rome, rising to power through establishing allies and his military accomplishments.

Through his military accomplishments, he gained support from the senate and was later elected consul and then transitioned into dictatorship. He became a well-known dictator in 82 BC where he established a series of governmental reforms altering Rome’s political system.\n\nHow Did Cleopatra Influence The Roman Empire\n\n2385 Words | 10 Pages\n\nCleopatra’s Influence on the Roman Empire Cleopatra VII has become one of the most well-known ruler and Egyptian in era of the Roman Empire because of her suppose beauty, cunning personality and her influence on the Roman Republic which turned into an Empire shortly after her death. While she is not Roman citizen herself, her relations with Julius Caesar and later Mark Antony are what brought her influence of power into Roman society and expanded her own in Egypt.

In fact they had created such a lasting impression with successful ideology, that George Washington wore a toga, to demonstrate how the old Roman values still had an affect on what was then modern day America. Nearly all of George Washington's actions while leading America took into account the history of Rome.\n\nExemplarity In Roman Literature\n\n1631 Words | 7 Pages\n\nThe first stage in the formation of exempla according to Roller is the performance of an action in the presence of others, yet Augustus’ good deeds in the Res Gestae blatantly fall outside of this criterion. Rather than allow the public to directly view his actions, Augustus decided for himself which sections of his history he would reveal to Romans. Augustus’ selective whitewashing of the accomplishments that he chose to display in the Res Gestae represents the first step in his exploitation of exemplarity to exercise his concealed authority. In order to translate these deeds into exempla, Roller sets forth that the public must judge an action either good or bad in terms of a shared set of values (Roller, 216). Again, Augustus’ writing of the Res Gestae breaks from the application of this framework.\n\nWhy Did The Roman Republic Fall\n\n913 Words | 4 Pages\n\n“Why did the Roman Republic fall?” The Roman Republic did not fall simply from one cause, rather many external pressures that brought on political instability and destruction. There were multiple pressures that lead to the downfall of Rome including ambitious generals, changing politics, client armies, and a desolate Senate desperate to remain prominent. Many significant people of the time, who wrote letters and speeches on ancient Rome, help to build detailed recollections of the political warfare that took place between 78-31BC.\n\nHow Does Claudius A Devil Figure In Hamlet\n\n1487 Words | 6 Pages\n\nLame.

Her relationships with Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony permanently have impacted on Ancient Rome and Egypt. Her being with Caesar and Anthony led to deaths, Cleopatra had been part of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony deaths. He began to make unwise decisions. Cleopatra was thus heir to a line of determined women who were often the object of sincere devotion on the part of the Egyptian people of inept or discredited.\n\nPlebeian Influence On Julius Caesar\n\n598 Words | 3 Pages\n\nJulius Caesar: The Influence of The Common Person Former editor-in-chief of the international magazine, The Economist, Walter Bagehot once said, “Public opinion is a permeating influence, and it exacts obedience to itself; it requires us to drink other men’s thoughts; to speak other men’s words, to follow other men’s habits.” The plebeians throughout the play of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare were easily influenced by not only the main characters of the play but also by each other.
