        "text": "Agrippina, the Younger\n\nToday I acquired a denarius coin, issued under Nero, but also with the head of Agrippina the Younger. Probably one of the most dazzling and controversial (female) figures in Roman history, also known as the kingmaker. The family-relatives of Agrippina the Younger read like a who's who of the imperial Roman aristocracy.\n\nShe was the daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder\n\nShe was the great-granddaughter of Augustus\n\nAccording to Roman law, Tiberius was her grandfather\n\nShe was the sister of Gaius, known as Caligula\n\nEqually famous siblings were Nero Caesar and Drusus Caesar\n\nShe was the wife and perhaps poisoner of Emperor Claudius\n\nShe was Emperor Nero's supermother\n\nAgrippina the Younger did not have a good reputation even during her lifetime and in ancient obituaries. She seduced, poisoned and murdered for power. She married her uncle and is even said to have become involved with her son Nero. Even the great Roman historian Tacitus described her as \"inflamed with a complete desire for a reign of terror\". And his colleague Suetonius called her a \"domineering and domineering woman\". She has gone down in history as the emperor's murderess and the monstrous shadow of her son Nero. When he finally had her killed, contemporaries considered it a logical consequence of her family background.\n\nIulia Agrippina was born on November 6, 15 or 16 BC in Oppidum Ubiorum (today Cologne) and died on Nero's orders in Campania in 59 AD. Agrippina was the seventh of at least nine children of Germanicus Iulius Caesar and Vipsania Agrippina, also known as Agrippina the Elder. She was the great-granddaughter of Augustus and thus belonged to the closest circle of the imperial family. On Augustus' instructions, Agrippina's great-uncle Tiberius adopted her father Germanicus. Tiberius thus legally became her grandfather. Her siblings included Nero Caesar and Drusus Caesar, who were adopted by Tiberius in 20 AD as potential heirs to the throne but were executed in 30 and 33 AD respectively, the later emperor Caligula as well as Drusilla and Iulia Livilla.\n\nHer first marriage was to Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus from 28 AD, with whom she had her only son, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, the future emperor Nero, in the year AD. After her brother Caligula had her worshipped as goddesses together with her two sisters Drusilla and Iulia Livilla at the beginning of his reign, he suspected the other two sisters of having conspired against him together with their brother-in-law Marcus Aemilius Lepidus after Drusilla's death and sent Agrippina into exile on the rocky island of Pontia in 39 AD, from which she was only able to return after his murder in 41 AD. Her first husband died in 40 AD as a result of illness. After her return, she married Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus, a wealthy and influential senator, who probably died in 47 AD; according to Suetonius, he was killed by Agrippina's treachery. In 49 AD, Agrippina then married her uncle Claudius as his fourth wife, for which a law had to be changed that forbade marriage between uncle and niece. She then succeeded in strengthening her position at court and weakening that of her opponents. Claudius hoped to gain additional dynastic legitimacy through his union with Agrippina, who, unlike him, was descended from Emperor Augustus. The marriage therefore also strengthened Agrippina's influence and reputation in the public eye, which is why she was honored with statues and inscriptions.\n\nAlthough Agrippina's new position did not give her a legal or institutional position, it did give her de facto political power, which she claimed and exercised for herself. It is clear from pictorial evidence and historiography, which is predominantly hostile to her, that she did not conform to the traditional image of women. She sought to secure the succession to the throne for her son, although Claudius himself had a son, Tiberius Claudius Caesar Germanicus, also known as Britannicus, from his marriage to Valeria Messalina. In February 50 AD, Claudius adopted the 12-year-old Lucius, who now succeeded his younger stepbrother Britannicus as Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus to the throne, thus displacing him as his immediate successor and strengthening Agrippina's future bad reputation. In addition, Claudius now gave his wife the title Augusta. She was thus the first Roman emperor's wife to be awarded this title during her husband's lifetime and also had full minting rights. Agrippina could therefore be depicted on coins minted throughout the empire without naming or portraying the princeps. Her power is also reflected in the foundation of the Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium named after her in 50 AD, which elevated the settlement at her birthplace from an oppidum to a colonia civium Romanorum, whose inhabitants, initially mostly veterans, had Roman citizenship.\n\nNero was declared of age at the age of 13 and appointed senator and proconsul. In 53 AD, at the age of 16, he was married to his 13-year-old stepsister Claudia Octavia, the daughter of Claudius and Valeria Messalina. By adopting Nero, he had officially become her brother, whom she was not allowed to marry under Roman law, which is why Claudia had previously been made an Octavian pro forma by adoption. Agrippina took various steps to make her son the next ruler. She summoned Lucius Annaeus Seneca back to appoint him as his tutor. The senator and accomplice of Livilla had previously been sent into exile to Corsica by Messalina. Agrippina also set herself the goal of winning the loyalty and allegiance of the military. She appointed the soldier Afranius Burrus as commander of the Praetorian Guard and gradually replaced the old soldiers with new ones loyal to her father Germanicus. At events, she wore a chlamys and is also said to have sat next to her husband, putting her on an equal footing with him. The ancient sources paint a picture of a passive Claudius. Meanwhile, he bestowed on her the title of Augusta, which he had previously denied Messalina, and advertised coins bearing her image. Britannicus negated his adoptive brother and is said to have once called him by his birth name, Domitius. When Agrippina found out about this, she reported it to Claudius and accused Britannicus of treason. Claudius allowed her to dismiss Britannicus' tutors and hire new ones.\n\nIn late 54 AD, Britannicus was about to celebrate his 13th birthday. At this point, Claudius fell ill and died shortly afterwards on the night of October 13, 54 AD as a result of poisoning, which is why his adopted son Nero was appointed ruler of the Roman Empire at the age of 16. Rumor has it that Agrippina poisoned her husband Claudius in order to deny his biological son Britannicus the right to rule. According to Tacitus, Agrippina had her husband Claudius poisoned with the help of the poisoner Lucusta in order to help her son Nero to power.\n\nAgrippina spent a total of six years trying to secure the title of ruler for her son. Now she expected something in return, which promised a not inconsiderable share of power. After Claudius' death, she had perhaps initially hoped to seize de facto power herself, as a coin with the inscription \"Agrippina Augusta, wife of the deified Claudius, mother of Nero Caesar\" suggests. Agrippina also had herself portrayed as the goddess of fortune (Fortuna). In the early years, she still exerted a strong influence on Nero's government. From then on, she moved around Rome accompanied by two lictors and gave orders to the praetorians. At first, Nero was not bothered by the fact that his mother held so much power. Coins depicted her together with her son Nero as equals on the obverse of the coins.\n\nAnd now I would like to introduce you to my latest acquisition.\n\nThis denarius, struck early in Nero's reign, strikingly shows his mother Agrippina Junior, widow of the newly deceased and deified Claudius, as the dominant force in the imperial government. Not only is her portrait depicted on an equal basis with that of her son, her name and titles are placed on the obverse, while Nero's are relegated to the reverse. Within a few months of the regime change, Agrippina's power had been eclipsed by Nero's advisors Seneca and Burrus. For the following coin type, the titles changed places, Nero's now occupying the obverse, and the portraits became jugate, with Agrippina behind Nero. Thereafter, Agrippina was entirely excluded from the coinage.\n\nNero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, with Iulia Agrippina (the Younger); Reign: Nero; Mint: Rome; Date: c. October - December 54 AD; Nominal: Denarius; Material: Silver; Diameter: 18.4mm; Weight: 3.51g; Reference: BMC 3; Reference: Cohen 7; Reference: RIC I (second edition) Nero 2; Obverse: Bust of Nero, bare-headed, right, bust of Agrippina the Younger, draped, hair in long plait, left, facing one another; Inscription: AGRIPP AVG DIVI CL AVD NERONIS CAES MATER; Translation: Agrippina Augusta, Divi Claudii Neronis Caesares Mater; Translation: Augusta Agrippina, mother of the divine Caesar, Claudius Nero; Reverse: Legend surrounding oak-wreath enclosing EX S C; Inscription: NERONI CLAVD DIVI F CAES AVG GERM IMP TR P; Translation: Nero Claudius Divi Filius Caesar Augustus Germanicus Imperator Tribunicia Potestas; Translation: Nero Claudius, son of the divine, Caesar, Augustus, victor over the Germans, Imperator, tribunician power.\n\nAs already described, however, Agrippina quickly lost her power to Nero's court. On coins - as can be seen here - she first appeared on an equal footing, then behind Nero, before finally disappearing from the coinage altogether. The issue of the coin motifs in particular clearly shows how Nero freed himself from his mother's grip.\n\nGradually, Nero's displeasure at having to share power with his mother became unmistakable. Her influence waned at the beginning of 55 AD. Nero's love affairs were a major trigger for this. His marriage to Octavia was orchestrated by Agrippina in order to secure her son's claim to power. However, Nero was unable to accept the union and instead entered into an affair with the freed Claudia Acte. According to the historian Tacitus, she consequently ordered the praetorians to oust Nero and have him replaced by Britannicus. A few weeks later, shortly before reaching the age of 14, Britannicus was poisoned during a state banquet on Nero's orders. Officially, he succumbed to epilepsy. With the murder of his adoptive brother, Nero declared his independence from Agrippina. Her portrait on the coins now appeared behind that of her son and later disappeared completely. Nero also demonstrated his superiority by removing his mother's bodyguards, assigning her a residence outside the imperial palace and declaring her persona non grata.\n\nA few years later, he fell in love with Poppaea Sabina, eight years his senior. She was the former wife of the praetorian prefect Rufrius Crispinus, whom Agrippina had previously ousted from his leadership position, and now wanted to become his wife, which was legally forbidden for a freedwoman. Poppaea gave Nero an ultimatum: she would leave him for her former husband if he did not put a definitive stop to his mother. In the spring of 59 AD, he decided to kill his mother. After a failed attempt in Baiae, a resort in Naples, in which he tried to sink his mother in a rigged boat, he sent a troop of three soldiers who ultimately killed her. Agrippina was murdered, cremated and buried without ceremony or monument. Her servant Mnester then killed himself. The murder of Agrippina made Nero the only Roman emperor to commit matricide. The matricide was later regarded as the main motive of the conspirators who had previously attempted to overthrow Nero in 65 AD and of the rebellious legions who ousted him three years later and forced him to commit suicide.\n\nAgrippina was murdered and buried in Campania. Nero was skeptical of the reactions of the inhabitants of Campania, as some of them rushed to her after Agrippina's death, unknowingly turning against their princeps. They eventually agreed publicly to Nero's official interpretation of events - Agrippina's suicide - and thus revealed themselves as accomplices, if not to the murder, then to its aftermath. Agrippina's murder forced the inhabitants of Campania to confess their allegiance to her or to Nero, something that many contemporaries shied away from in the midst of political unrest. The same problem can be found in the archaeological memory of the region: in Puteoli, Agrippina's name was removed from a monument commemorating local games, while in Herculaneum a large group of statues depicting her name and likeness, as well as many other inscriptions in and around the Gulf of Naples, were preserved until after her death. The inhabitants of Campania thus commemorated their Augusta, but were divided on the direction of this commemoration.\n\nIt should be noted that Agrippina Minor gained access to imperial power three times in her 30 years of political existence: the first time as Caligula's sister, the second time as Claudius' wife and finally as Nero's mother. She was the only woman in Rome to publicly exercise the power of an emperor.\n\nFeel free to write your comments and show more examples of coins here."
