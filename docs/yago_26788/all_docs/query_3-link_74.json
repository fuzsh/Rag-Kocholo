(13)\n\n31 AD: Agrippina’s mother is exiled by Tiberius, her brother Nero Julius Caesar and\n\nDrusus died suspiciously (16)\n\n33 AD: Agrippina the elder died (17)\n\n37 AD: Tiberius, Emperor of Rome dies. Agrippina's brother, known as Caligula, becomes\n\nemperor. (21)\n\n37 AD: Agrippina's son Nero is born. (22)\n\n39 AD: Agrippina is exiled for being involved in a conspiracy against her brother,\n\nCaligula.\n\n40 AD: Agrippina's husband, the father of Nero, dies.\n\n41 AD: Agrippina is allowed to return to Rome.\n\n41 AD: Agrippina marries Passienus Crispus.\n\n49 AD: Agrippina poisons her second husband, Passienus Crispus.\n\n49 AD: She then marries her uncle Claudius, who is at that time the Emperor of Rome.\n\nShe induces him to adopt Nero as his son and heir in preference to his own son.\n\n54 AD: Emperor Claudius dies and is succeeded by Nero. Nero's tutors, Seneca and\n\nBurrus, become his most important advisers and major figures in the government of\n\nRome.\n\n56 AD: Agrippina is forced out of active participation in the governance of Rome. This\n\nwas brought about by Nero acting under the influence of Burrus.\n\n59 AD: Agrippina objects to the affair Nero in having an affair with a wife of a Senator.\n\nNero decides to kill her. He puts her on a boat that is designed to sink. She, however,\n\nmakes it to shore and her home.\n\n59 AD: Roman soldiers under Nero's order go there and kill her.\n\n● Background and rise to prominence\n\nFamily background and status\n\nBorn in AD\n\nNot born in Rome, was born the in the Rhine\n\nParents, Germanic and Agrippina the Elder (or I)\n\nHer parents were Rome’s power couple, glamour couple of the Roman Empire\n\nFather was down to be the next emperor – he was adopted by Tiberius and heir to the principate\n\nThrough her mother she has a direct bloodline to Augustus\n\nMost important influence in her life is her mother – they’re both extremely strong women – inherits from her mothers strength\n\nDifference between them is their attitude towards marriage – Agrippina I won’t remarry but only for love\n\nShe is one of 6 children\n\n3 brothers, 2 sisters\n\nout of the 6, 5 die not of natural causes – murder, intrigue, betrayal\n\nCaligula is one of the most famous, she is the younger sister of him\n\nPolitical and military context - Tiberius had become Princep one -year before - War against the Germans - Two mutinies - Her father was in the middle of three campaigns against the Germans\n\nIndividual Roman court. Role in the with Agrippina Relaonship Sources: What do they say?\n\nAugusta\n\nRoman statesman and military leader who became the first emperor of the Roman Empire, reigning from 27 BC until his death in AD 14\n\nWas the Great Grandfather of Agrippina\n\n- Amid this sort of conversation, the health of Augustus deteriorated. (he died before Livia) - Livia remained the one woman whom he truly loved until his death ( he loved his wife dearly)\n\nthe divine blood of Augustus****. (he was seen as a godlike figure)\n\nAugustus exiled her to the island of Pandateria, off the coast of Campania. Augustus lightened the punishment by allowing her to move to Rhegium on the mainland, but she was still in exile. (he was not violent and had a sense of justice\n\nWhen Augustus learned what was going on, he gave way to rage so violent (shows that he did get very mad)\n\nLivia\n\nAugustus’s wife\n\nWas the Great Grandmother of Agrippina\n\n- Livia had the aged Augustus firmly under control. health of Augustus Deteriorated. Some suspected his wife of foul play .., too, was flattered a great deal by the senate.. that she should be called 'parent' and 'mother’ of her country (she is a power-hungry adulteress) - he often warned Livia to remember that she was a woman and must not interfere in affairs of state. (she was meddlesome in politics and did not commit to her role as women) - They were both clever, ambitious women who won the affections of a princeps and used their position to promote their sons. (they were actually just clever women who helped their sons)\n\nGaius (Caligula)\n\nCaligula was the third Roman emperor, ruling from 37 to 41.\n\nHer brother - Gaius' accession seemed to the Roman people--one might almost say, to the whole world-like a dream come true. ( His father’s popular reputation made him revered amongst the Romans) - Gaius gave special honours to Agrippina and her sisters. The rights of the Vestal Virgins gave them legal advantages, such as exemption from the authority of a male guardian. (he was a good brother and respected women due to him giving them basically their own rights) - Gaius was elevating the women of the imperial house to show that they shared in the majesty of the principate. (he gave them their own rights and understood their meaning and shared with them his power out of his own right)\n\nGnaeus Domitius Ahenobarb us\n\nGnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus was a close relative of the five Roman Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\n\nHer husband None on sheet\n\nEarly life, ambitions and marriages\n\nFirst trauma that the family goes through – AD 19\n\nFour years of age, Family of Agrippina loses their father - Germanicus dies\n\nMother is left a widow and the six siblings are left without a father\n\nFirst of a number of traumatic events for Agrippina in this period\n\nEvents mould/shape her to who she is – they toughen her\n\nAgrippina I returning to Rome with Germanicus’ ashes\n\nFamily is now vulnerable to political enemies, intrigue, Sejanus\n\nSejanus comes onto the scene not long after the death of her father – he was power hungry\n\nThey’re vulnerable to Sejanus – not only ones at risk though\n\nHer mother convinced that Germanicus’ death is not accident and blames Tiberius\n\nTiberius exiles Agrippina I and Agrippina II was 13 years’ old\n\nHer eldest brother about 19 (Nero Caesar) was charged with treason by Sejanus\n\nNext brother Drusus Caesar was found dead in his cell\n\nLost 4 family members “She grew up in an appalling atmosphere of malevolence, suspicion and criminal evidence.”\n\nNot normal childhood – this shapes her and make her stronger and tougher, and smarter – works out how to survive\n\n14 Years Old - In AD29 she gets married to Domitius Ahenobarbus (who was in his 30s...) - Standard procedure is that the father organises the wedding but Tiberius organises it instead - This tells us that women in this period aren’t empowered, they don’t choose - Gets married 3 times – only marriage out of the three where she is lacking empowerment, the other two marriages are that they are different - Claudius’ marriage – she has a lot of power “Now the emperor ordered the marriage to be celebrated in the capital. His choice, Domitius...” – Tacitus Annals, IV. - She is going to not accept this later – she is going to push the boundaries - Domitius Ahenobarbus, He is cruel, a drunken, Come from an upper class family, The guy that has a reputation that is well known in Rome - Stories that he ran over a child in his chariot – story was that he saw the child and when he saw the child he sped up - He was sadistic - In an argument he gouged out the eye of a fellow - This marriage helps with the relationship with the senate as Ahenobarbus was related to the senate - political marriage - Tiberius knew that this guy has no ambition – never going to be a threat to Tiberius – about what he will gain and what risks he will minimize - Roman society was very male dominated – domestic violence is a speculation on what had happened behind close doors with Agrippina “Ahenobarbus, a man described by Suetonius as detestable in every aspect of his life, but who, all the same, enjoyed a distinguished lineage.” – A, Caligula\n\nDecember AD37 – Agrippina and the young Nero - Gives birth to Nero – her only child - Nero was called Nero until he was adopted – so really he is the future Nero\n\nBetter time to bear a son than when Tiberius was in reign – she’s starting to think politically – first glimpse of her starting to control events\n\nBeginning of Agrippina that is starting to scheme, plan and use her brain – consider political implications\n\nThe birth of Nero is a huge moment for her – single most important event in her life\n\nTurn out to be her own child\n\nNero becomes everything to her – he is the focus – what motivated her – defining moment for her\n\nClue we get out of Suetonius about how important Nero is to her, she visits a soothsayer (fortune teller) that says he will become emperor but she will die as a result\n\nBrother been emperor for 9 months, Caligula was having the better part of his reign and he was treating Agrippina well\n\nCaligula shows his sisters great respect – positive period for her\n\nHe was getting their names included when people swore oaths – he wanted his sister’s respects “ Gaius caused the names of his sisters to be included in all oaths, in the following terms: ‘.. fortune attend the emperor Gaius and his sisters.’” – Suetonius , Gaius, 15\n\nCaligula also had his sisters put on coins – this is archaeological evidence of this\n\nAnother example of how well things are going, allowed the sisters to come to public events – showing clearly the regard he had for them\n\nAt banquets, he sat his sisters around him\n\nCaligula in this early face was so close to his sisters and held them in such high regard, that rumours (ONLY) started that he was sleeping with them “It was habit to commit incest with each of his three sisters...” – Suetonius , Gauis, 24\n\nAt the time Nero was born, things change – she loses her sister Drusilla (only one that dies of natural causes)\n\nCaligula is very upset by his sister’s death\n\nAll happening for Agrippina at the same point – her brother has now begun to change, becoming more suspicious and unpredictable\n\nHe’s much more abusive, cruel\n\nCaligula starts to act strangely to Nero and Agrippina would have suspected that immediately – see’s Nero as a potential threat\n\nAgrippina is aware that Ahenobarbus is dying\n\nGone from where everything is positive to now negativity etc\n\nPlot with surviving sister to plot against Caligula\n\nShe is obviously doing this for Nero\n\nEach have a lover to plot – sister has an army commander, Agrippina has a senator\n\nAD38 – two strong characters and his sisters plotting against him\n\nRelationships for political purposes\n\nLepidus leading senators – Agrippina had an affair – occurs after Gaius disrespect for Senate\n\nLivilla does the same with another high ranking man – general (Gaticulus) at the Northern Frontline\n\nThis is the first time that she has directly got involved in politics – turning point\n\nDecided to join a conspiracy to overthrow her brother\n\nThe plot fails – never got a change to follow through\n\nLepidus and Gaticulus get executed\n\nGaius exiles his two sisters – irony – sending them to the same island where their mother and grandmother had been to – Pontian island\n\nHe then embarrasses his two sisters – must carry the ashes of their two lovers through the street of Rome – crime is treason\n\n“.. the trial of Amelius Lepidus to condemn them as adulteresses and privy to the conspiracies against him...” – Suetonius\n\n“He deported his sisters to the Pontian island.. was given Lepidus’ bones in an urn and forced to carry them back to the city.” – Dio Cassius\n\nThe plan for Agrippina from here – they’re supposed to die on the islands\n\nNero is separated from her – plan is forever\n\nShe was exiled, humiliated, failed, was separated from her son\n\nQuestions\n\nIn what circumstances did Gaius come to be princeps? He became Princeps after Tiberius died.\n\nHow and for what reason did Gaius re-establish his family following the death of Tiberius? Gaius immediately ordered that the bones of his mother and brothers be brought back to Rome and formally buried as well as gave his sister many extra honours and rights. This was to reestablish the prominence of his family which also elevated his status and their status above anyone else.\n\nName 3 honours that were heaped on Agrippina and her sisters. They were made honorary Vestal Virgins Given seats in the imperial enclosure at the games Put on coins\n\nWhat is Seutonius’ view of Gaius’ relationships with his sisters? It was Suetonius who first published claims that Caligula committed incest with his three sisters.\n\nWhat happened to Gaius at the end of 37AD? He fell ill and considered making Drusilla his sister his heir.\n\nWhat dangerous activities did Lepidus become involved in? The former husband of Drusilla (who died) was committing adultery with Agripinna and Lavilla\n\nWho was Gaetulicus? What happened to him? He was the legate (governor) who was executed\n\nWhat could have been Agrippina’s interest in Lepidus? He was powerful and had connections with the army and due to this Agrippina who was plotting her brother’s death was interested in him due to his power which was big enough to form a conspiracy that would have her brother killed and her sister Livilla replacing him.\n\nThe Senate had plenty of reasons to dislike Caligula. Name a few. There were rumours he had incestuous relations with his sisters\n\nHe executed the Governer and they were probably scared that they would be next. He was also accused of having an affair with his horse He gave his sisters (women) a lot of rights\n\nMarries Gaius Sallustius Passuenus Crispus, former husband of Domitia who was Agrippina’s first husbands (Ahenobarbus) sister\n\nHas a lot of good qualities – he is elderly\n\nHas a purpose to serve – he is rich – he is childless\n\nHe takes her out of Rome – they go to the east – this gets her out of Rome and Messalina’s clutches\n\nHer survival instincts are great – he as money, position\n\nAD47 – word gets out that Messalina had self-destructed\n\nAnd then Crispus dies soon after\n\nShe doesn’t need Crispus any longer, Crispus left his will to Agrippina and Nero\n\nThe money will be used to bankroll Nero’s future\n\nWants to marry Claudius\n\nShe handles this phase of her life brilliantly and side steps the dangers – she is wealthy\n\nPosition is now stronger than it has ever been “Juvenal.. that he was poisoned by Agrippina, greedy for the rich inheritance that would go to her son.” - Syme\n\n“.. it was Agrippina.. hooked him. She had a niece’s privilege of kissing and caressing Claudius, and exercised it with a noticeable effect on his passions.. wedding took place without delay...” – Suetonius\n\nNero is about 11 at this time\n\n“Messalina’s demise left the field open to Agrippina.

The majority of their basis and power was established through lineage, marriage and\n\nchildren mainly sons who could obtain various political positions. As a result, Agrippina’s legacy\n\nwas significantly influenced by her role as a woman and due to her repudiation of Rome’s\n\nreductive gender dichotomies, her legacy was immensely subverted by ancient male sources who\n\nsupported Rome’s patriarchal system.\n\nAgrippina is remembered by history today, through her direct lineage to the emperor Augustus\n\nand her father Germanicus, a revered General. The ascendance of he r brother Caligula to the\n\nposition of priceps further proliferated her reputation. Through Caligula’s reign, Agrippina’s\n\nreductive roles were initially extended through his appointing of unprecede nted positions to her\n\nand her sisters which included becoming titled honorary Vestal vir gins, given seats in the imperial\n\nenclosures at games and becoming minted into coins with Caligul a on the other side. Through\n\nthese acts, Agrippina’s identity became equated with significa nce and she became a prominent\n\nfigure in Roman life. Although free from the reductive gender dichotomies within the Roman\n\nsenate, Agrippina continuously became embroiled in accusations of sc andal associated with\n\nGaius's tyranny and subordination resulting in his exploitation of her s exuality. As a result,\n\nAgrippina and her sisters became associated with immorality as evident through interpretations\n\nfrom historians such as Suetonius who mentioned Caligula “lived in habitual incest with all his\n\nsisters,” in attempts to instigate propaganda against the family and the imperial system through\n\npainting both Caligula and his sisters in an immoral light as a result of his instability\n\nFollowing Gauis’s murder, a result of his negligence to Roman ort hodox, Agrippina's immoral\n\nimage, due to her liberation from the subordinate roles inflicted upon women, persisted as\n\nevident through the accusations of her murdering her second husband by various historical"
