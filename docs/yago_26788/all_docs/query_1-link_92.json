        "text": "Found at the west slope of the Acropolis. Her features are individualized: large, rounded eyes; thin eyebrows; and a small mouth with a fuller lower lip. Her curly hair is gathered at the back in a low bun with a few loose strands. Her sternum is rendered in a way that can be fitted in a corresponding cavity on the statue’s torso. It has been suggested that this statue was initially erected in the Odeion of Agrippa.\n\nAgrippina the Younger was Caligula's sister, Claudius's wife and mother of emperor Nero, whom she had acquired in her first marriage. She was born in AD 16 and was assassinated in AD 59 by her son’s order because he wanted to rid himself of her guardianship."
