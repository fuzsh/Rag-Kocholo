        "text": "\"Such was life for Uncle Claudius.\" ~Dovahhatty, whenever something unlucky happened to Claudius.\n\nClaudius (10 BC - 54 AD) was the fourth Roman Emperor, reigning from 41 - 54 AD. He was the husband of Messalina and Agrippina the Younger, uncle of Caligula, and father of both Nero and Britannicus.\n\nIn \"Unbiased History\"[]\n\nRome IX - Augustus[]\n\nClaudius is seen as a baby, being carried by Dovahhatty himself.\n\nRome X - The Mad Emperors[]\n\nClaudius had recently married to a woman who would later cuck him. Later, after Sejanus was denied a marriage, Claudius was pressured into marrying Sejanus' abusive relative instead. Claudius had then published histories about the Etruscans and Carthaginians, causing him to become a consul by Caligula's request, spiralling him into, as Dovah put it, \"crazy cults that cost him a fortune, all for the sake of banter.\"\n\nWhen Cassius Chaerea had Caligula murdered, the more loyal Praetorians found the cowering Claudius behind a curtain, proclaiming him as emperor. He soon had Chaerea executed, and changed his name to \"Augustus\" to emulate the original Princeps, his step-grandfather. His first decrees included exempting the ruins of Troy from taxation and (attempting to, but ultimately fail) disallowing the persecution of Jews. He also attempted to drain the Fucine Lake, only for the drainage to back up and submerge the entire effort. He had also took up the role of censor alongside Aulus Vitellius' father, Lucius, purging a few members of the Senate afterwards. He annexed the client kingdom of Thrace alongside his friend Narcissus, finally making the Mediterranean \"Mare Nostrum,\" \"Our Sea.\"\n\nThanks to Caligula beating Neptune, he managed to gain Britannia as a province, civilizing Caratacus and founding Camulodunum (modern-day Colchester) as the province's capital city. He then sent Vespasian to conquer the south-west coast, annexing it in the process.\n\nHis third wife, the adulterous Messalina, gave birth to his natural son, Britannicus, before she welcomed back Caligula's sisters, accusing Julia of adultery (ironically enough) with Seneca. After Messalina's death, he married Agrippina the Younger, reuniting the Gens Julia and Gens Claudia once more, naming Nero, then known as Lucius, as his heir, marrying him off to his daughter, but he would later regret that decision, planning to change his heirs, but he would die from poisoning before he could do so.\n\nHe would later be seen as a spirit overlooking Nero's annexation of Bosphorus.\n\nRome XIX - The Fall of Rome[]\n\nHe is seen in the ending montages alongside the rest of the post-Augustus Julio-Claudians, their relatives and wives, including Sporus, a horse, Sejanus, Boudicca and Caratacus, Paulinus, and Neptune.\n\n\"Trivia\"[]"
