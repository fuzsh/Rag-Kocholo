Agrippina the Younger was the oldest daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder and granddaughter of Antonia Minor. Despite the efforts of her mother and grandmother to raise her to be a virtuous woman, she would take more after Livia, from whom she learned all about how a Roman viper would operate in life. She would be married off to Gnaeus Domitius Ahnerobarbus with whom she would have a son, the future Emperor Nero. When Caligula was Emperor, he would have a relationship with her and his other two sisters before Julia Drusilla died and she and her other sister were found plotting against Caligula with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, forcing her into exile in the aftermath. Claudius would welcome Agrippina the Younger back to Rome and marry her after Messalina's failed coup against him. However, she would poison Claudius, hoping to rule the Empire through her son Nero, something which didn't happen with how Agrippina ended up being assassinated by Nero.
