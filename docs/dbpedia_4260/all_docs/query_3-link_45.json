        "text": "Definition: All organisms more closely related to land vertebrates than to Actinopterygii. This is a total group definition, however all known members are diagnosed by synapomorphies (of course they would be.)\n\nOnychodus - basal sarcopterygian (left) and Cheirolepis canadensis basal actinopterygian (right).\n\nSynapomorphies:\n\nThe neurocranium ossifies as two units completely separated by the ventral cranial fissure. Their contact is a mobile joint.\n\nParietal and postparietal bones in dermal skull roof meet in a dermal intracranial joint, the external manifestation of the endocranial hinge. Note: In basal sarcopterygian, the parietal roofs the sphenoid region and the postparietals, the otico-occipital region.\n\nThe presence of distinct squamosal (sq) and preopercular (pop) bones in the cheek (see Onychodus - right)\n\nPectoral fin of rhizodontid Sauripteris\n\nThe limbs articulate with the girdles by a single element, the humerus (as in Sauripteris) or femur.\n\nCosmoid scales completely lacking ganoine.\n\nSkull roof of the coelacanth Rhabdoderma\n\nActinistia and relatives: Actinistia (Devonian - Quaternary) and Onychodontiformes (Devonian) are united by an elongate postparietal.\n\nOnychodontiformes include a small number of taxa including Onychodus (above right) and Strunius. Their synapomorphy:\n\nProminent parasymphyseal tooth whorls that could be protracted when the jaw was opened, and significantly modified palatal bones to accommodate them.\n\nBut caution: A review of phylogenetic hypotheses by Ciudad Real et al., 2022 suggests that although onychodontoformes group with Actinistia, they may not be monophyletic with respect to it.\n\nLatimeria menadoensis\n\nActinistia: (Dev - Rec) Commonly called coelacanths. Represented by one living genus, Latimeria.\n\nDiscovered in 1938 by amateur ichthyologist and museum curator Marjorie Courtenay Latimer on the commercial fishing wharf of East London, South Africa. Despite great effort, another specimen was not found until 1952, off the Comoros Islands. Apparently the South African specimen had been way out of range. In the Comoros, it was known to local anglers. Recently, a second population has been found in Indonesia.\n\nRhabdoderma from Palaeos\n\nSynapomorphy:\n\nMaxilla lost.\n\nAs a result, the primary teeth of the upper jaw are palatal, rather than marginal teeth.\n\nMiguashaia\n\nAdditionally, though not exactly a synapomorphy, most actinistians have a diphycercal tail with a fleshy central lobe, although early forms, such as Miguashaia didn't conform to this pattern.\n\nAxelrodichthys from BIO 370 Vertebrate Zoology\n\nUdo Savalli, Arizona State University\n\nThe actinistian record:\n\nTrue range is Late Devonian to recent, however fossils indicate extinction in Cretaceous.\n\nTwo major periods of diversification and success:\n\nPaleozoic forms representing an initial diversity of morphologies including Miguashaia (above right), Allenypterus during the Devonian, ultimately stabilizing on the classic actinistian morphology during the Carboniferous. (E. G. Rhabdoderma). This diversity was pruned by the Permo-Triassic extinction.\n\nMesozoic radiation including ambush predator Rebellatrix (Triassic), Axelrodichthys (right), the giant Mawsonia.\n\nActinistian biology: Latimeria tells us much about the biology and ecology of ancestral sarcopterygians.\n\nIt is the only sarcopterygian to retain the bipartite neurocranium that diagnoses Sarcopterygii ancestrally. In it, muscles on the ventral side connect the two parts of the neurocranium. When they contract, the anterior section is flexed downward, inreasing the power of the animal's bite.\n\nThe actinistian lung is variously modified. In Latimeria, it contains fatty tissue. In some fossil forms, it possesses a calcified outer membrane.\n\nLatimeria is ovoviviparous: it practices internal fertilization and young are retained in the oviduct until highly developed, like in some sharks. Note, the young are nourished by yolk. There is no maternal nourishment.\n\nLepidosiren paradoxa from Wikipedia\n\nDipnomorpha: (Devonian - Quaternary) Total group containing Dipnoi (lungfish) and their fossil relatives.\n\nLiving lungfish and their adaptations: Today there are three genera of lungfish, one each for:\n\nAustralia (Neoceratodus)\n\nAfrica (Protopterus)\n\nSouth America (Lepidosiren)\n\nOf these, the Australian type is more distantly related. All lungfish are adapted to surviving in harsh ephemeral pools.\n\nAttributes of living lungfish:\n\nFrom BioLib.cz\n\nMaxillae and premaxillae lost.\n\nMouths are modified for crushing hard-shelled prey. Teeth are consolidated into stout crushing plates.\n\nHolostylic jaw suspension with palatoquadrates fused to neurocranium.\n\nBoth incurrent and excurrent nostrils open onto the palate.\n\nLong fleshy limbs.\n\nReliance on air breathing: Lungfish's lungs have convoluted infoldings to increase surface area. Branchial arches are reduced in size. In fact, the African and South American varieties require air to survive.\n\nAestivation: During periods of drought, lungfish burrow into the mud, secrete a cocoon of mucus, and enter a state of suspended animation. When their pool fills up, they awake and emerge. In fact, in the pet trade, lungfish are occasionally collected and shipped in this state - as genuine dehydrated pets. BTW, their adptations make them very hardy aquarium fish.\n\nDiabolepis speratus showing anterior and posterior nares from Palaeos\n\nAncient dipnomorphs and their fossil record:\n\nLungfish similar to modern ones appear in the Triassic (Early Mesozoic).\n\nFossil aestivation burrows are known from the Early Permian.\n\nDipterus valenciennesi after Moy-Thomas, 1971\n\nThe lungfish record goes back much farther than that, however. Paradoxically, they first turn up as a very speciose Devonian radiation of marine fish. Indeed, for much of the Devonian, lungfish are second only to placoderms as the most common group of marine fish.\n\nSkull of Dipterus in ventral and dorsal view, and schematic of dermal elements\n\nThe problem with lungfish: From a cladist's perspective, lungfish are intractible for a two reasons:\n\nIn the course of evolution, the recognizable dermal bones of their heads have fragmented into small unrecognizable units.\n\nEven the earliest lungfish have lost the separation of the two parts of the neurocranium, rendering even their status as sarcopterygians ambiguous at first.\n\nHoloptychus from Miguasha National Park\n\nDipnomorpha: For decades, their relationships with other vertebrates were controversial. The problem seems to have been solved by the examination of Porolepiformes - (E.g. Holoptychius, from Early Devonian) less derived primitive fossil sarcopterygians that share with lungfish the synapomorphies.\n\nSpongy bone in snout containing many small tubules. Paradoxically, the synapomorphy of Dipnomorpha has been lost by its living members. This tissue probably contained the nerves of a sensory organ in the snout, and the blood vessels to support them.\n\nLong slender forelimb. Characterized by a metapterygial axis that does not branch into pre and postaxial elements.\n\nTetrapodomorpha\n\nTetrapodomorpha: All organisms more closely related to land vertebrates than to lungfish. These creatures didn't actually set out to become land animals. They were perfectly happy as fish. In fact, most of the evolutionary novelties that predisposed them toward life on land were near-term adaptations to life in water or were simply accidents. But first, what were they?\n\nHoloptychus from Miguasha National Park\n\nOur starting point is the completely aquatic Holoptychius, a porolepiform dipnomorph. Fully aquatic with external incurrent and excurrent nares. From such beginnings, we witness a series of transformations that give rise to creatures with at least the latent ability to invade the land.\n\nRoster of transformations\n\nBecoming a land vertebrate is not easy and certainly not inevitable. Major adaptations are required in the following systems:\n\nRespiratory: Out of water, gills become a sure means of desiccation and must be reduced.\n\nSkeletal: On land, one must support one's weight against gravity and still be able to move. This requires:\n\nRobust paired limbs\n\nDigits\n\nVertebral ossifications and articulations\n\nA sacrum\n\nFeeding: A fish has no neck. To pick food up off the ground, the head must bend with respect to the torso.\n\nSensory: All of the senses must be retooled to function in air.\n\nOlfaction: Olfactory epithelium must be kept moist.\n\nVision: Refractive indices differ in air and water.\n\nHearing: Air is much less dense than water. Thus, old structures must be radically repurposed to concentrate sound in an impedance matching ear:\n\nLateral line sense: Useless out of water. Still, as an ancestral feature, they tend to be retained by adults that spend any significant amount of time in the water.\n\nKenichthys nares (a, d, and e) from Zhu and Ahlberg, 2004\n\nThe choana: In land vertebrates, air flows through the nares into the nasal capsule. From there, it moves through am \"internal naris\" or choana into the oral chamber. In effect, the excurrent naris of other aquatic osteichthyans has been shifted across the upper lip. Kenichthys campbelli (Early Devonian), the basal member of Tetrapodomorpha, shows this transition in progress:\n\nb, c: Youngolepis, a dipnoan with both nares external\n\na, d, e: Kenichthys, with the excurrent naris embedded in the upper lip.\n\nf, g: Eusthenopteron, a derived tetrapodomorph with external naris and internal choana.\n\nWith this system, a vertebrate could inhale air without having to gulp and swallow it. Instead, air can be drawn directly into the (closed) oral chamber (being sniffed by olfactory system on the way) then pumped into the lungs, using the expansion and contraction of the oral chamber and pharynx already used in prey capture.\n\nChoanata: The last common ancestor of Rhizodontida and land vertebrates and all descendants. Synapomorphies include:\n\nChoanae present.\n\nPaired fins with two radial elements (radius and ulna in pectoral fin, tibia and fibula in pelvic). (Note: in Kenichthys the condition is unknown. According to Jude et al. 2014, the living dipnoan Neoceratodus briefly shows this condition as an embryo, but the radials soon fuse into a single element.\n\nRhizodus by Kahless28\n\nRhizodontida: (Devonian - Carboniferous) Tetrapodomorph superlatives. Fresh water ambush predators including Rhizodus (right) which at up to 7 m may be the largest fresh water fish ever. Characterized by:\n\nBoth dorsal fins and anal fin displaced posteriorly into the \"ambush predator\" ecomorph.\n\nFins reinforced for strength with unsegmented lepidotrichia and a superficial layer of scales. Did they use their reinforced pectoral fins partially to support their weight or to push their heads above water?\n\nComplex lateral line system. (On taxon has three parallel lateral lines.)\n\nOsteolepis sp. from Carroll, 2009\n\n\"Osteolepids\" (Devonian - Permian) A speciose paraphyletic assemblage of aquatic sarcopterygians. The synapomorphies that unite them with tetrapods to the exclusion of rhizodontids are highly technical. For us, they provide a picture of aquatic choanates that are known from long and thorough study.\n\nEusthenopteron foordi\n\nTristichopteridae (Devonian) A distinctive monophyletic group. for GEOL431, their significance is mostly in their being the closest sarcopterygian group to Tetrapoda not to show any particular adaptation for life in very shallow water. Thanks to the mid-20th century work of Erik Jarvik, the tristichopterid Eusthenopteron (right) is among the best known of fossil vertebrates.\n\nSynapomorphies of Trstichopteridae include:\n\nThe presence of a postspiracular bone in the upper cheek margin.\n\nA three-lobed caudal fin and caudal skeleton reinforced by elongate neural spines dorsally and accessory epihaemal spines ventrally.\n\nAbsence of cosmine from scales.\n\nForelimb of Eusthenopteron foordi from Palaeos\n\nSynapomorphy of Tristichopteridae and Tetrapoda:\n\nA humerus with recognizable entepicondyle and ectepicondyle. (Regions for muscle insertions.)\n\nElpistostegalia\n\nPanderichthys rhombolepis from Clack, 2012\n\nThe first true indication of a tendency to place at least parts of the body out of the water occurs in Elpistostegalia (Latest Devonian - Quaternary - named for a poorly known member, Elpistostege.) The last common ancestor of Panderichthys and Tetrapoda and descendants. The first and most basal well-known member is....\n\nPanderichthys (Late Devonian) Known from the Baltic region. Up to over a meter length, it is slightly flattened with a pointed snout. Its orbits are located on the dorsal surface of the skull, as are the spiracles, as if they were meant to project above the water. The impression given is of an aquatic animal specialized for shallow water and for hunting creatures just above the water's surface. Panderichthys retains rather heavy scales.\n\nSynapomorphies of Elpistostegalia and Tetrapoda:\n\nSkull flattened with orbits and spiracles dorsal\n\nPaired frontals\n\nThe intracranial joint between parietals and postparietals sutured and immobile (even though basal forms like Panderichthy retain the sarcopterygian bipartite neurocranium. Compare with Eusthenopteron)\n\nLarge spiracles and spiracular chambers\n\nLoss of dorsal and anal fins\n\nTiktaalik roseae from Villanova University\n\nTiktaalik roseae: (Late Devonian) Described in 2006 by Daeschler et al., this creature has become the current poster-child of vertebrate evolution. It is featured in:\n\nA new popular book\n\nThe Colbert Report\n\nA Southpark episode (rather vulgar. Search for \"retard baby fish.\")\n\nIn its general profile, it's similar to Panderichthys, there are two important differences.\n\na. Eusthenopteron, b. Panderichthys, c. Tiktaalik, d. Acanthostega from Boisvert et al., 2008\n\nThe wrist. Although fin rays are still present (and digits absent), its wrist is capable of flexing. Thus, it could support at least some of its weight on its forelimbs. No indication that it ever emerged completely from the water.\n\nTiktaalik roseae from Clack, 2012\n\nThe neck: Tiktaalik lacks:\n\nopercular and subopercular. (The preopercular remains)\n\nall dermal elements of the pectoral girdle dorsal to the cleithrum.\n\nAs a result, its skull and pectoral girdle were no longer in contact, allowing the head to be flexed with respect to the torso - the beginnings of the neck.\n\nTiktaalik retained heavy scales that must have sustained considerable mechanical load. Clearly something was taking up the strain for the vertebral column, which was evidently not ossified. (!)\n\nTiktaalik's pelvis was described by Shubin et al., 2014. Although the hindlimb is unknown, the pelvis is surprisingly large and the hip socket is circular, indicating that the hindlimb was strong and had a wide range of motion. And yet, Tiktaalik lacked a sacrum.\n\nFrom this it seems that Tiktaalik could support at least a little of its weight on its paired fins. What would be the point? For an idea, we look at the head.\n\nSpiracles of a tristichopterid and a basal elpistostegalian compared from Brazeau and Ahlberg, 2006.\n\nSpiracular inspiration? The earliest elpistostegalians (including Panderichthys and Tiktaalik) display an interesting trend in the evolution of the spiracle, which is:\n\nOpen\n\nLarge\n\nPositioned on the upper surface of the skull\n\nCould they have been breathing through their spiracles? We see this today in the basal actinopterygian Polypterus.\n\nA review by Clack, 2007, maintains that this was an adaptation to air breathing, in effect, through the ears. Indeed, the ability of creatures like Tiktaalik to do \"pushups\" may have been to get the spiracles clear of the water's surface. Arguably, this was an adaptation to unusually low O2 concentrations during the Frasnian age of the Late Devonian, during which elpistostegalians radiated. Recent geochemical analyses indicate that this evolutionary pulse coincided with an interval of low O2 concentrations. This, Clack argues, stimulated the evolution of air-breathing adaptations. Naturally, creatures with the ability to elevate their heads above water to breathe, by supporting their body weight on their limbs would have the best shot at leaving the water altogether, if only for brief intervals.\n\nBut note that there is a positive-feedback effect here: Modern fish who rely on air-breathing in hypoxic water environments tend to reduce their gills in order to avoid losing oxygen from the blood through outward diffusion, making them more dependent on air-breathing. Why not quickly lose gills altogether? Because it is metabolically easier to excrete CO2 through them than through the lungs because CO2 shed into water is quickly converted to HCO3-, maintaining a strong CO2 concentration gradient ( Pelster, 2021) at the gills. As we will see, tetrapods held onto their gills for quite a while for this reason. (Witzmann, 2015)\n\nAdditional reading:"
