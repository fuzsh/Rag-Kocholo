        "text": "Classification\n\nDomain: Eukarya\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Actinopterygii\n\nOrder: Perciformes\n\nFamily: Percidae\n\nGenus: Etheostoma\n\nSpecies: Etheostoma caeruleum\n\nDomain: Eukarya\n\nEukaryotic organisms are unique when compared with the Archaea and Bacteria domains because their cells contain a nucleus that holds important genetic material. These Eukaryotic cells are membrane-bound and can create other multi-cellular organisms. In contrast, both Archaea and Bacterial organisms are prokaryotic, meaning they do not have a nucleus or any organelles bound by a membrane.\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nThe kingdom Animalia consists of organisms that mainly receive their energy from other animals by feeding on them as predators. This is opposite of most plant species because they often create their own food through photosynthesis. The cells of these animals do lack a cell wall and vary in other ways when compared to different kingdoms. Since this category is extremely broad, it is hard to distinguish with a multitude of characteristics (Encyclopedia of Life, 2011).\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nThe phylum Chordata consists of many popular vertebrates such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes. Their bodies are all bilaterally symmetrical and can be separated into head, trunk and tail. Members of the Chordata phylum also have a notochord (a cartilaginous skeletal rod), a nervous system and visceral clefts and arches (Encyclopedia of Life, 2011).\n\nClass: Actinopterygii\n\nThis class makes up half of all living vertebrates and is considered the largest and most successful group of fishes. Most of the members of this group have webs of skin to serve as their fins with bony or horny spikes as a support system. Actinopterygii are found in every aquatic habitat and often times serve as a food source for the human population (Encyclopedia of Life, 2011).\n\nOrder: Perciformes\n\nPerciformes can be considered one of the most popular vertebrate groups living in the oceans today and is the biggest order among all of the fish. They actually vary widely when it comes to things such as color, size, shape and feeding, migration and breeding behaviors. However, all Perciformes do have similar fins in addition to a unique jaw that sucks food in for nutritional purposes (Encyclopedia of Life, 2011).\n\nFamily: Percidae\n\nThe fish in this family have both soft rays and stiff spines that make up their fins. The dorsal fin of Percidae is divided into two sections and is located on the middle back; the front is spiny, whereas the rear is soft rayed. These fish can easily by distinguished between others because of its lack of an adipose fin (Inland fishes of New York, 2006).\n\nGenus: Etheostoma\n\nEtheostoma represents around one hundred species of darter fish. All of these darters are native to North America and live mainly in clear streams, towards the bottom of the water. They dart around quickly to capture their prey and eat many types of small aquatic animals. Additionally, all members of the genus Etheostoma, have two dorsal fins and are usually between five and seven centimeters (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2013).\n\nSpecies: Etheostoma caeruleum\n\nEtheostoma caeruleum, or the rainbow darter, are a species of fish that live mainly in clear-water streams. They are somewhat colorful, but reach their highest variance in color during mating season (Lyons, 1999). The rainbow darter also has six to ten stripes saddled down the side of their body with fourteen running vertically. These fish usually live up to four years and produce between three to seven eggs during one reproduction cycle (Marko and Fink)."
