        "text": "Osteichthyes and Actinopterygii\n\nOsteichthyes Introduced:\n\nDefinition: The last common ancestor of Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish).\n\nOsteichthyan Trends:\n\nOsteichthyes weren't the first vertebrates with bone, but they developed and used it in novel ways that cause their skeletons to preserve much more evolutionary information: Major trends:\n\nWidespread endochondral bone in the braincase and postcranial skeleton.\n\nEmergence of recognizable dermal elements of the head and pectoral girdle.\n\nEmergence of a tendency for superficial dermal elements to interact with deeper endochondral ones.\n\nSynapomorphies of Osteichthyes:\n\nA thorough survey goes beyond the technical limitations of this course. If you really want to know, consult the technical literature. For us, a general review must do:\n\nBone ossifies endochondrally: Many fossil vertebrates have extensive dermal bone. Osteostraci, Galeaspida, and placoderm-grade gnathostomes have in addition perichondrally ossified three-dimensional bone preformed in cartilage, however in Osteichthyes, there is extensive endochondral ossification as well, in the braincase, girdles, and vertebral elements.\n\nSensory canals in an Arthrodira and Osteichthyes\n\nSensory canals: Present in vertebrates ancestrally, but only identifiable in vertebrates with large dermal plates. In Arthrodira we see\n\nThe extension of the main lateral line onto the skull roof.\n\nSupraorbital canal\n\nInfraorbital canal\n\nIn Osteichtheys these are joined by:\n\nPreopercular canal\n\nMandibular canal\n\nOccipital commissure\n\nJugal canal (in Sarcopterygii)\n\nNeurocranium of Mimipiscis toombsi\n\nOther neurocranial synapomorphies:\n\nNeurocranium articulates with palatoquadrate via basipterygoid process (Although the stem chondrichthyan Pucapampella seems also to have had this (Maisey and Anderson 2001).)\n\nPostorbital process forms the dorsal surface of a partition called the lateral commissure. the hyomandibula articulates with its posterior surface rather than with the otic process, as in Chondrichthyes.\n\nSpiracular groove passes between lateral commissure, basipterygoid process and opening of spiracle.\n\nEndolymphatic duct does not communicate with the external environment.\n\nThe anteroventral extremity of the lateral occipital fissure widens into an unossified vestibular fontanelle adjacent to the sacculus of the inner ear.\n\nCheirolepis canadensis\n\nDermal bony plates form dermal skull roof (right), including:\n\nPaired elements:\n\nParietals (p)\n\nPostparietals (pp)\n\nSupratemporals (st)\n\nIntertemporals (it)\n\nLarge cheek plate that houses the preopercular canal. (Named the preopercular (pop) in actinopterygians, and arguably homologous to the preopercular and squamosal in sarcopterygians)\n\nMedian elements:\n\nRostral (r)\n\nPostrostral (por)\n\nTeeth are developed in the dermal bones forming the margin of the mouth (premaxilla, maxilla, dentary) as well as from bones covering the palatoquadrate and Meckel's cartilage.\n\nDermal bones enclose Meckel's cartilage. Adductor muscles insert on Meckel's cartilage through an adductor fossa.\n\nSynapomorphies of Mandibular arch:\n\nDermal bones of the jaw:\n\nAt least one infradentary beneath dentary on medial surface\n\nPrearticular medial to adductor fossa\n\nCoronoid series anterior to adductor fossa.\n\nPalate of Mimipiscis showing dermal elements.\n\nDermal bone lines the palate:\n\nVomers (v)\n\nPterygoids (pt)\n\nA lateral arcade of palatal elements\n\nHyoid and branchial arches of Mimipiscis.\n\nSynapomorphies of Hyoid arch:\n\nDermohyal - Dermal ossification of the hyomandibula:\n\nBranchiostegal rays with at least two elements modified as operculars and suboperculars (in contrast to their status in acanthodians).\n\nHyoid arch cartilages ossify as:\n\nHyomandibula (eh) (\"epihyal\" of some authors) and interhyal (ih) dorsally\n\nCeratohyal (ch) and hypohyal ventrally.\n\nSynapomorphies of branchial arch:\n\nFirst two branchial arches articulate to a single basibranchial\n\nSynapomorphies of pectoral girdle: In addition to the endochondral scapulocoracoid, there is a series of paired dermal elements that couple the pectoral girdle and skull.\n\nCleithrum (ct) (which adheres to the lateral aspect of the endochondral scapulocoracoid.)\n\nDorsal to the cleithra (in order).\n\nAnocleithra (aka postcleithra)\n\nSupracleithra\n\nPosttemporals\n\nVentral to the cleithra\n\nClavicles\n\nInterclavicle (single midline element)\n\nLepidotrichia from dkimages.com\n\nSynapomorphies of the postcranium:\n\nFins supported by lepidotrichia - dermal fin rays developed from modified rows of scales.\n\nLungs - outpouchings of the esophagus serving as an accessory breathing mechanism. (Modified in some as a \"swim-bladder\" for hydrostatic control.) Byrne et al., 2020 consider this a potential evolutionary response to high tide ranges, causing fish who become trapped in tide pools to experience selective pressure for means of coping with hypoxia. From simply swallowing air bubbles as an auxiliary oxygen source to using lungs is a short jump.\n\nWhat the first lung looked like is debated. The traditional view is that they originated as paired out pouchings of the pharynx, however Cupello et al., 2022 suggest that the original lung was unpaired, with pairing arising secondarily within Sarcopterygii.\n\nPrimary fin supports make minor contribution to median fins outside body wall.\n\nRhombic body scales with peg and socket articulation.\n\nFulcral scales support leading edges of fins.\n\nMimipiscis neurocranium\n\nNoteworthy plesiomorphies of the neurocranium: Ancestrally, the occipital, otic, and sphenoid-ethmoid regions of the braincase are imperfectly co-ossified resulting in:\n\nPersistent lateral occipital fissure (lateral cranial fissure of some authors)between otic and occipital regions.\n\nPersistent Ventral cranial fissure in floor of braincase between otic (parachordal) and sphenoid (trabecular) regions.\n\nThe post-cranial axial skeleton is simple:\n\nThe notochord is not ossified\n\nNeural arches protect the nerve cord dorsal to the notochord\n\nRibs may project from the notochord in the trunk region\n\nHaemal arches protect blood vessels ventral to the notochord\n\nSupraneurals may extend from the neural arches\n\nOccasionally, intercalary ossifications (aka \"intercalaries\" - not shown) form between neural or haemal arches.\n\nFin ray radials support the median fins.\n\nIn most Paleozoic osteichthyes, heavy body scales take up much of the mechanical load that is born by the axial skeleton in later fish.\n\nLatimeria menadoensis (Sarcopterygii) and Xyrauchen texanus (Actinopterygii)\n\nOsteichthyan Diversity\n\nTwo major living groups:\n\nActinopterygii (Devonian - Quaternary) - Living ray-finned fish and their fossil relatives.\n\nSarcopterygii (Silurian - Quaternary) - living lobe-finned fish (including tetrapods) and their fossil relatives.\n\nTheir evolution will be addressed in detail. For now, a \"quick and dirty\" guide to distinguishing their ancestral members (actual apomorphies in red.):\n\nMoythomasia nitida (Actinpoterygii) and Strunius sp. (Sarcopterygii)\n\nBody profile:\n\nActinopterygii:\n\nSingle dorsal fin\n\nTail is heterocercal. Epichordal lobe lacks fin rays. Instead, it is lined by robust fulcral scales\n\nSarcopterygii:\n\nTwo dorsal fins\n\nTail is diphycercal in the most basal forms. Even those that evolve heterocercal tails retain epichordal fin rays.\n\nXiphias gladius (Actinpoterygii) and Sauripteris taylori (Sarcopterygii)\n\nPaired limb skeleton:\n\nActinopterygii:\n\nParallel endochondral radials articulate with the endochondral scapulocoracoid\n\nSarcopterygii:\n\nPre- and postaxial elements branch from a metapterygial axis.\n\nThus, a single humerus articulates with the endochondral scapulocoracoid, followed by radius and ulna, etc.\n\nMimipiscis toombsi (Actinpoterygii) and Eusthenopteron foordi (Sarcopterygii)\n\nBraincase:\n\nActinopterygii:\n\nStrongly integrated or coossified endochondral braincase.\n\nHyomandibula articulates through a single articular surface dorsal to the jugular vein.\n\nSarcopterygii:\n\nEthmosphenoid region and otico-occipital regions completely separated by ventral cranial fissure and meet at a mobile joint.\n\nHyomandibula articulates through two articular surfaces between which the jugular vein passes.\n\nGanoid scale (Actinpoterygii) and cosmoid scale (Sarcopterygii)\n\nScales:\n\nActinopterygii: Ganoid scales\n\nScales form as concentric bony layers around a primordium, as in Acanthodii.\n\nHowever superficial layers are of dentine and deep layers of acellular bone, separated by by a vascularized layer.\n\nSuperficial surfaces of upper layers are made of thick layers of ganoine - an enamel-like substance.\n\nThese tend to be heavy and rhomboidal.\n\nSarcopterygii: Cosmoid scales\n\nTypically lack ganoine (although the most basal members have it.)\n\nThe cosmine layer is, instead, covered by a thin lamina of enamel, forming the scale surface.\n\nOsteichthyan Origins\n\nActinopterygii and Sarcopterygii are total groups that include all members on their stems. Thus, every member of Osteichthyes is, by definition, a member of Actinopterygii or Sarcopterygii. Nevertheless, we should expect to find \"stem osteichthyans\" displaying some of the osteichthyan synapomorphies. Alas, only a handful of candidates are known:\n\nDialipina markae\n\nDialipina: (Early Devonian - right) Described as a basal actinopterygian based on its possession of ganoid scales. Clement et al., 2018, however, recover it as a stem osteichthyan.\n\nTwo Late Silurian taxa known from isolated bones and scales including jaw fragments (Botella et al., 2007).\n\nAndreolepis hedei\n\nLophosteus superbus\n\nIn these, fragments of the maxilla and dentary display teeth that grade into families of dermal denticles similar to the tooth families of chondrichthyans.\n\nLigulalepis: (Clement et al., 2018) Well known from skull roof and braincase remains displaying placoderm, chondrichthyan, and osteichthyan characters.\n\nThe result is the huge concentration of synapomorphies at the Osteichthyes node. It seems probable that stem-osteichthyans have been misidentified as basal actinopterygians or sarcopterygians because:\n\nScale histology is not so straightforward:\n\nIt was only recently found that ganoine occurs in both actinopterygians and stem osteichthyans. Until the last decade, a fish with ganoid scales would have been assumed to be an actinopterygian.\n\nConversely, Meemania, a basal actinopterygian, has cosmic scales (Lu et al., 2016)\n\nPrior to the era of cladistics, \"stem-Osteichthyes\" was not part of our search-image.\n\nBut the most significant landmarks are closer to the osteichthyan node. Our most informative example:\n\nGuiyu oneiros from Wikipedia\n\nGuiyu (Right. Late Silurian Zhu et al. 2009) is:\n\nThe oldest known osteichthyan.\n\nOur closest well-known approximation of the last common ancestor of Osteichthyes.\n\nOriginally thought to be a basal sarcopterygian, Clement et al., 2018 find it to be a stem osteichthyan. It's most interesting feature, however, may be its plesiomorphies, including:\n\nStout pectoral and dorsal fin spines\n\nGanoine covering surface of dermal bones of skull\n\nDermal elements of the pelvic girdle, a feature otherwise only known in the antiarch Parayunanolepis (Zhu et al., 2012).\n\nA prerostral on the midline of the palate - an element otherwise seen only in placoderm-grade gnathostomes.\n\nGuiyu and its similar close relative Psarolepis are eugnathostomes for sure, but they remember their placoderm-grade origins.\n\nActinopterygii:\n\nCheirolepis canadensis from Wikipedia\n\nLiving actinopterygians are so highly derived that their basic synapomorphies are hard to see. These are visible, however, in fossil taxa like Cheirolepis (right) from the Devonian, the oldest well-known actinopterygian and phylogenetically the most basal. A full exploration of the synapomorphies of Actinopterygii and its constituent clades is beyond the scope of this course. The ones we do track will pertain to four major trends in actinopterygian evolution.\n\nActinopterygian evolutionary trends:\n\nKissing gourami Helostoma temminckii from FishNavy Films\n\nFrom biting to sucking:\n\nThe jaws of the ancestral actinopterygians like Moythomasia relied on the scissor-like action of the upper and lower jaws to bite and hold prey. Derived actinopterygians employ a suction feeding mechanism, in which the the mouth extends to form a tube while the pharynx is expanded, sucking prey items in. Once inside, prey is dealt with by any of a variety of jaw, tongue, or pharyngeal teeth. To achieve this, the premaxilla and maxilla have become extremely mobile. (A modest example)\n\nBasal sarcopterygian vertebral column\n\nOssifying the vertebral column:\n\nThe ancestral osteichthyan had ossified neural and haemal arches, but the notochord remained unossified.\n\nAmong both actinopterygians and sarcopterygians, the vertebral column ossifies as proper bone (in a variety of patterns), yielding vertebrae that represent a close association of:\n\nCentra\n\nNeural arches\n\nHaemal arches\n\nMaking the tail symmetrical: During actinopterygian evolution, caudal vertebrae and their associated hamael arches shorten, curl up sharply, and fuse into a small number of triangular elements that support a superficially symmetrical - looking tail termed homocercal.\n\nActinopterygian Homology Headache:\n\nNewcomers to actinopterygian paleontology confront a frustrating amount of disagreement about the names of actinopterygian dermal head skeletal elements. This is because in literature published prior to the 1990s, such elements were named based on the similarity of their topographic position on the skull to the cranial elements of sarcopterygians, including tetrapods. Thus, the paired bones between the orbits were called frontals, because they occupied the same general position as the frontals of tetrapods, even though they enclosed the pineal foramen. This results in two problems:\n\nMany actinopterygian cranial element names suggest homologies for which there is no good evidence. In these notes, I place such names in \"quotation marks.\"\n\nAt least some have sarcopterygian homologs with different names. Since the 1990s, researchers like Hans-Peter Schultze have attempted to verify the homologies of actinopterygian skull bones and adjust their names accordingly (see Schultze, 1993).\n\nBecause so much literature employs this nomenclature, you must always determine which nomenclatural system is being used.\n\nNote, also, that in derived actinopterygians, the homologies of the elements shown at right can be obscured when:\n\nNew elements such as suborbitals appear\n\nElements of known homologies fuse (E.G. the dermopterotic = supratemporal + Intertemporal) or fragment.\n\nSynapomorphies of Actinopterygii:\n\nCaCO3 otoliths: CaCO3 structures that fill the sacculus or utricle of the inner ear.\n\nMandibular sensory canal enclosed by dentary.\n\nSingle dorsal fin (right).\n\nAnterior of dorsal and anal fins reinforced by narrow parallel radials (right).\n\nCaudal radials much shorter than haemal arches.\n\nActinopterygian Diversity:\n\nGroups with living representatives include:\n\nCladistia: Includes living Polypterus and Erpetoichthys, and fossil relatives.\n\nAcipenseridae: Sturgeons\n\nPolyodontidae: paddlefish\n\nGinglymodi: Gars and fossil relatives.\n\nHalecomorphi: Bowfins and fossil relatives.\n\nTeleostei: The majority of living ray-fins, from goldfish to blue marlins.\n\nWe will address these one by one, with a selection of their fossil relatives.\n\nBasal Actinopterygii:\n\nAlthough controversial, most phylogenies agree that the Middle - Late Devonian Cheirolepididae (monogeneric for Cheirolepis) is the basal branch. There follows a speciose and morphologically disparate paraphyletic assemblage, traditionally called \"paleoniscoids.\" They represent the major diversification of actinopterygians during the Late Devonian and Carboniferous, with many members surviving well into the Mesozoic. Alas we can only touch on them.\n\nCheirolepis canadensis\n\nCheirolepididae (Middle-Late Devonian) - The most basal well-known fossil actinopterygians, and a close approximation of what we would expect from the true last common ancestor of the group.\n\nPlesiomorphies:\n\nRetains a small tuft of epichordal caudal fin rays.\n\nPelvic fins still reflect their origin as elongate postbranchial fin folds.\n\nAutapomorphy:\n\nExtremely small scales.\n\nSee Giles et al., 2015 for details.\n\nFrom this point onward, we follow the result of Giles, et al., 2017, noting its differences with older hypothesis commonly cited in technical literature.\n\n\"Paleoniscoids:\"\n\n(Devonian - Cretaceous) A host of fossil forms are closer to living \"crown Actinopterygii\" than to Cheirolepis. Traditionally termed \"Paleoniscoids\" after Paleoniscum. Their derived features include:\n\nPalatal toothplates on the vomers.\n\nbranching lepidotrichia\n\nHeterocercal caudal fin, completely lacking epichordal fin rays.\n\nMidline canal in posterior ventral braincase for the dorsal aorta. (Link to skull of Mimipiscis in palatal view.)\n\nteeth capped with acrodin, a unique enameloid tissue.\n\nParasphenoid with dorsal processes that interact with neurocranium.\n\nPropterygial canal: The propterygium - the anterior basal element of the pectoral fin houses a prominent vascular canal.\n\nAncestrally, they resemble Moythomasia (Late Devonian - right). Plesiomorphic features include:\n\nComparatively short ethmoid region\n\nThe maxilla extends far behind the orbit and the preopercular slopes anteriorly.\n\nA small number of large elements encircle the orbit.\n\nHeavy ganoid scales.\n\nStrongly heterocercal tail\n\nRedfieldius gracilis\n\nThe comparison of Moythomasia (Late Devonian) a basal member of this radiation, and Redfieldius (Triassic - right) a more derived member shows that Redfieldius displays a condition closer to that of derived actinopterygians in most of these features. See if you can spot the differences!\n\nNote that starting in the Early Carboniferous, \"paleoniscoids\" also included deep-bodied forms, and forms with special feeding adaptations. Wilson et al., 2021 suggest that the Famenian extinction event freed actinopterygians from ecological constraints enabling them to radiate into new niches, similarly to chondrichthyans at the same time.\n\nSaurichthys from Prehistoria Wikia\n\nOf special interest - Saurichthyidae (Late Permian - Middle Jurassic) Long (0.5 - 1.5 m) slender long-jawed predators superficially resembling houndfish or gars. Vaguely like a sturgeon trying to be a barracuda. Generally considered close relatives of sturgeons, but recently placed just outside of crown-group actinopterygii by Giles, et al., 2017.\n\nBody elongation: Within this group, Maxwell, et al., 2013 show a unique mode of elongation of the vertebral column. Whereas other vertebrates either:\n\nincrease the length of vertebrae\n\nincrease the overall number of myomeres\n\nMembers of Saurichthyidae manage to transpose the developmental identity of neural and haemal arches onto small intercalary elements that would typically serve as spacers between them. (Link to video. )\n\nCrown Actinopterygii:\n\nPolypterus bichir\n\nCladistia (Cretaceous - Holocene) The most basal living actinopterygians are highly specialized. Their living representatives, Polypteriformes, include the living reedfish Polypterus (CT-scans at Digimorph) and Erpetoichthys, native to the fresh waters of Africa. Although derived in many respects, including:\n\na row of small post-spiracular bones\n\na parasphenoid that extends the entire length of the braincase\n\na dorsal fin divided into a series of finlets\n\na protocercal tail\n\nThrough extensive reversals, they lack the synapomorphies of most other actinopterygians.\n\nEcologically convergent on sarcopterygian lungfish in their ability to tolerate changing conditions in ephemeral pools and streams and their need to supplement gill-derived oxygen with air. Indeed:\n\nTheir lungs show the ancestral condition retained by sarcopterygians - communicating ventrally with the esophagus, begin development as single, but become secondarily paired during development.\n\nAlthough they can remain out of water for considerable periods, they will drown if not given access to air.\n\nThey are known to breathe air through their dorsally positioned spiracles. (Could this have been a common practice among other osteichthyans with similar spiracle configurations?)\n\nPolypterus bichir after Allis, 1922.\n\nFossil cladistians: Recent discoveries pull crown-cladistians into the Cretaceous:\n\nSerenoichthys kemkemensis: (Late Cretaceous) (Dutheil, 1999) Known from two headless specimens, a small, relatively stout polypteriform.\n\nBawitius bartheli: (Late Cretaceous) (Grandstaff et al., 2012) Known from ectopterygoids (palatal bones). Extrapolating based on their size, the entire fish may have approached two meters in length.\n\nBeishanichthys brevicaudalis from Xu and Gao, 2011.\n\nNew for 2017: Giles, et al., 2017 recover the Triassic group Scanilepiformes (like Beishanichthys - right) as stem Cladistians. Previous authors had considered Cladistia basal to all actinopterygians but Cheirolepis, invoking a ghost lineage extending from the Devonian to the Cretaceous! The new result eliminates this problem and places the minimum divergence age of crown Actinopterygii in the Early Triassic.\n\nActinopteri:\n\n(Triassic - Quaternary) The last common ancestor of all living actinopterygians excluding Polypteriformes. The crown of Actinopteri includes:\n\nChondrostei: Includes living sturgeons and paddlefish, and their fossil relatives.\n\nNeopterygii: Gars, bowfins, teleosts, and their fossil relatives.\n\nSynapomorphies include:\n\nSupraorbital bones present.\n\nIntertemporal fused with supratemporal to form dermopterotic\n\nParasphenoid extends across ventral cranial fissure. (Independently derived within Cladistia.)\n\nProminent issues: Although speciose, Paleozoic actinopterygians tended to be small, and a minor component of faunas in which large placoderm-grade fish (prior to Devonian extinctions), chondrichthyans and sarcopterygians figured prominently. The actinopteran radiation, in contrast:\n\nWas a Mesozoic radiation. That event seems to have released Actinopteri from ecological constraints.\n\nIncluded large fish as well as small ones.\n\nStem Actinopteri:\n\nBirgeria stensioei from Universität Zürich\n\nBirgeriidae (Triassic) Large (1.2 m) robust pelagic predators ecologically similar to tuna or mackerels.\n\nThe crown of Actinopteri is anchored on:\n\nChondrostei: Sturgeons, paddlefish, and their fossil relatives\n\nNeopterygii: Gars, bowfins, and teleosts, and their fossil relatives.\n\nChondrostei:\n\nLiving chondrosteans:\n\nAcipenser oxyrhynchus from Wikipedia\n\nAcipenseridae (sturgeons - Cretaceous - Quaternary) Large fish of Eurasian and North American rivers and lakes, these notable as the source of caviar. Predators taking prey from the bottom. Interesting morphological features:\n\nBody scales are lost but for five rows of heavy plates.\n\nThe small jaws are hyostylic.\n\nPolyodon spathula from Wikipedia\n\nPolyodontidae (paddlefish - Cretaceous - Quaternary) Large suspension feeders of China and North American rivers and lakes. Interesting morphological features:\n\nA long paddle-shaped rostrum can be up to a third of the body length\n\nRam suspension feeders, straining food from the water by gill-rakers projecting from the branchial arches.\n\nAmong chondrosteans, sturgeons and paddlefish are sister-taxa. Their synapomorphies tend to be associated with extreme reduction of ossification:\n\nOpercular lost, leaving the subopercular to support the operculum\n\nFewer than four branchiostegal rays\n\nExtensive rostrum supported by dorsal and ventral rostral bones.\n\nVentral bones of the rostrum form a distinct keel.\n\nLiving chondrosteans significantly reduce their amount of endochondral ossification. Examining fossil chondrosteans, one sees that this is a derived feature. (Also conversantly derived in other large actinopterygian suspension-feeders.)\n\nFossil Chondrosteans:\n\nChondrosteus acipenseroides\n\nChondrosteidae (Early Jurassic) Large (0.5 - 1 m) fish broadly similar to sturgeons or paddlefish but lacking specializations such as their long rostra, but showing significant loss of ossification of the skull roof that effectively disconnects the mandibular arch from the skull roof, and modification of the mandibular arch facilitating its protrusion.\n\nChondrosteus acipenseroides\n\nTogether, sturgeons, paddlefish, and chondrosteids make up Chondrostei. Synapomorphies include:\n\nPalatoquadrates meet in an anterior symphysis. (taking the place of stabilizing articulations to the neurocranium.)\n\n\"Quadratojugal\" connects maxilla to palatoquadrate posteriorly. (Allowing the maxilLa to move with the palatoquadrate.)\n\n\"Preopercular\" reduced to a series of ossicles housing the preopercular canal\n\nA tall triangular suborbital bone makes up the anterior margin of the cheek.\n\nMandibular canal is short or absent\n\nBody scales reduced to tiny elements\n\nAdditional reading:"
