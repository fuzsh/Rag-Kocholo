        "text": "Classification\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Actinopterygii\n\nOrder: Perciformes\n\nFamily: Osphronemidae\n\nGenus: Betta\n\nSpecies: splendens\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nSpecies belonging to the kingdom Animalia are heterotrophs. Heterotroph means they do not produce their own food, leading them to find food elsewhere. Species in this kingdom are also described to be multicellular, lack a cell wall, and reproduce sexually (Woese et. al, 1990).\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nThe most notable synapomorphy seen in the phylum Chordata is the presence of a notochord. The notochord is a major structural element in these species that emerges during embryonic development that is important with structure, support, and communication (Myers, 2011). Another feature is pharyngeal slits that, in fish, later develop into gills which are used in gas exchange (Buchsbaum et. al, 1967).\n\nClass: Actinopteryygii\n\nThe class Actinopterygii, also known as the âray-finned fishâ or bony fish is described by fins that are supported by the presence of long rayed bones, hence where the name comes from. In all the different vertebrae groups, this one is one of the largest as well as one of the most diverse as there are many different body plans (Jonna, 2004).\n\nOrder: Perciformes\n\nLooking at the fish that fall under the order of Perciformes consists of most of the common fish we are familiar with today in our nearby lakes, rivers and streams. Perciformes literally means âperch-like.â Fish in this order have many characteristics such as their fins, that differ the Betta splendens from other fish. The pectoral fins of these fish are located on the sides. Also, their dorsal and anal fins are not only detached from the tail fin but also contain sharp spines that can be used as a means of self-defense for the fish (Weisz).\n\nFamily: Osphronemidae\n\nThe family Osphronemidae also known as Gourami, has one major synapomorphy that divides the fish into a much smaller group. These fish have been observed to express parental activity during reproduction. In the reproductive process, the male fish builds a bubble nest to hold the eggs. He holds domain over the nest and protects the eggs. This action differs from the other fish species that just swim over the eggs, releasing their sperm and continue on their way (Ruber et. al, 2004).\n\nGenus: Betta\n\nThe genus Betta has a very unique distinction caused by the presence of a labyrinth. This organ allows them to breath in atmospheric air. This allows these fish to live in shallow ponds, rice patties, and other low oxygenated waters. Without this, these fish would die in these habitats (Sturgeon, 2001).\n\nSpecies: splendens\n\nLastly, the species splendens are separated by their means of reproduction. Betta fish use bubble nests to host their fertilized eggs until hatching. The other forms of Betta are classified as mouth brooders. Mouth Brooders are described to have developed differently from the betta fish as they adapted to the fast paces of the stream life. This is compared to the shallow ponds and rice patties the fighting fish are accustom to (Ruber et. al, 2004).\n\nFor more information on the Betta fish's classification go to Encyclopedia of Life. This site also has direct links to other species of Betta if interested in furthering research into these other species.\n\nFigure 1. Represents the classification among different classes similar to Betta splendens. They are known as a Ray-Finned fish because their fins are supported by long-rayed bodies.\n\nFigure 2. Represents the classification among the species similar to the Betta splendens. Betta splendens put their eggs in bubble nests unlike other Betta species that mouth brood. They also have much longer fins than species closely related to them.\n\nNow let's examine the Betta fish's habitat. Click here to continue."
