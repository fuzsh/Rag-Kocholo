        "text": "Fig. 5, which can also be called from within the ORDERS table, illustrates the tree thus obtained. This �tree of fish life� combines temporal and relational information on fish groups in a manner that is readily accessible. One feature of this tree is that it allows straightforward identification of the �Sister group� of any Order, as well as defining the time since two Orders last shared an ancestor. Because cluster analysis was used to generate the tree, linkages which occur above the level of Order suggest temporal and phylogenetic relationships based on the common ancestor information. Thus, the tree also provides a hypothesis-generating platform for investigating fish relationships at or above the level of Order. Lastly, the tree, or parts thereof, can be expanded to the level of Family, Genus and Species given the input of relevant data.\n\nWith Hennig, it became possible to distinguish paraphyletic groups (containing an ancestor and only some of its descendants) from monophyletic ones (containing an ancestor and all its descendants). Hennig thus gave birth to modern systematics, where the paraphyletic groups are finally rejected. For example, the old group Pisces (�fishes�) is clearly paraphyletic as there is no character that can exclusively define fishes. There is a common fish ancestor: it is the animal that had the first cranium, between 500 and 600 million years ago. But half of the living descendants of this ancestor are not put in �fishes�. These are the tetrapods. If we decided to make fishes a monophyletic group, we would have to include tetrapods, and humans would be fishes. Another way to point out paraphyly is to stress that some members of a group are more closely related to other organisms than to members of their group. For example, actinistians (coelacanths) and dipnoans are more closely related to tetrapods than to actinopterygians. Actinopterygians, as �bony fishes� are more closely related to tetrapods than to chondrichthyans. The term �fish� therefore disappears from modern systematics and more precise terms are now available, all related to monophyletic groups. These terms are given here only for extant taxa! Craniates have the cranium. They are made of two sister-groups, the hagfishes (mixinoids) and vertebrates, which are divided into petromyzontoids (lampreys) and gnathostomes, the jawed vertebrates. In jawed vertebrates, the chondrichthyans (defined by prismatic calcified cartilage and pelvic claspers) are the sister-group of the osteichthyans (defined by a typical pattern of dermal bones: premaxillar, maxillar, frontals, parietals, etc.). Osteichthyans are divided into two sister-groups, actinopterygians (defined by the acrodine cap on teeth and other characters) and sarcopterygians (monobasal paired fins found in lobe-finned fishes and tetrapods). Sarcopterygians contain actinistians (coelacanths) and rhipidistians defined by the sinuous aortic trunk and many other characters. Rhipidistians are made of two sister-groups, dipnoans and tetrapods.\n\nThe rise of cladistics in ichthyology starting from 1967 brought tremendous and sudden advances in systematic ichthyology. In about five years, half the teleostean tree passed from a bush to a cladogram. Today, the �bush at the top� (a term due to Don Rosen and Gareth Nelson) persists, and much work remains within the terminal crown of the teleostean tree.\n\nGuillaume Lecointre"
