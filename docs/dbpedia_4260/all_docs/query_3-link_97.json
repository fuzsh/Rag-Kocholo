The Chaenobryttus have since been placed within the Lepomis (Avise 1977).\n\nThose in the Domain Eukarya are classified as organisms with a membrane-bound nucleus, or nuclei. Those in the Kingdom Animalia have characteristics of multicellularity, lack a cell wall and are heterotrophic. The Lepomis gulosus exhibits bilateral symmetry and deuterostomes in Phylum Chordata. Part of the Craniata, vertebrata in Class Actinopterygii are known as the Ray-Finned fishes. Fish in Actinopterygii exhibit the presence of a distinct head, jaw, gill covered by a bony operculum, and a lung or swim bladder (Hickman, et. al. 2011).\n\nSpecies in the Order Perciformes are bony fishes, while the being in the family Centrarchidae indicates that it is a Sunfish or Freshwater Bass. The Lepomis genus is small one with roughly 20 species in it (Nature Reserve). Lepomis are commonly known as Eared Sunfishes (EOL). Species in the Lepomis genus have lateral line scales, no teeth, and no spinous projections. The Lepomis gulosus differs from other Lepomis species in that they have dark and light lines from the eye to gill cover rather than blue or green. Their fins can also be a variety of colors (Texas Parks & Wildlife).\n\nGO BACK HOME"
