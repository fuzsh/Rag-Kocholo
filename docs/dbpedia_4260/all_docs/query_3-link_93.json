        "text": "Perciformes\n\nYellow perch (Perca flavescens)\n\nScientific classification\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Chordata\n\nClass: Actinopterygii\n\nOrder: Perciformes\n\nFamilies\n\nmany, see text\n\nPerciformes (\"perch-like\") is the most diverse order of ray-finned fish and include about forty percent of all species of bony fish, making it also the largest order of vertebrates. With over 10,000 known species, placed in about 1,500 genera and 160 families, Perciformes is the most prolific group of vertebrates in the ocean and also are dominant in many freshwater habitats. Also called Percomorphi or Acanthopteri, this taxonomic group includes the familiar perches, basses, sunfishes, bluefishes, remoras, jacks and pompanos, snappers, drums (croakers), angelfishes, cichlids, mackerels, tunas, gobies, groupers, and swordfishes.\n\nClassification of Perciformes is unsettled, with both the order and many families possible not monophyletic. Many families remain to be defined in terms of shared derived characters, and taxonomic groups recognized as subfamilies by some authorities may be raised to the family level by other authorities.\n\nPerciforms have important functions for their various ecosystems and for humans. Ecologically, they are integral to food chains and are consumed by other fishes or by birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and various invertebrates. For humans, they serve a multitude of functions. Some, such as tuna, mackerel, bass, snapper, and swordfish are of commercial importance as food; and tilapia are commonly raised in aquaculture for food. Some perciforms, such as gobies, angelfishes, and cichlids are well known as aquarium fish. Many, such as bass, sailfish, perch, sunfish, and tuna, offer recreation value as the target in sportsfishing. The diverse behaviors and forms of the many species in this order also add to the wonder of nature.\n\nOverview and description\n\nPerciformes belong to the Actinopterygii, a major taxonomic class (or subclass) of fish, known as the \"ray-finned fishes,\" within which 96 percent of all fish species are placed. In turn, the Actinopterygii is one of two taxa within the Osteichthyes, known as the bony fish, with the other taxon being the class (or subclass) Sarcopterygii or \"lobe-finned fishes.\"\n\nThe name Perciformes comes from the Greek perke, meaning \"perch,\" and the Latin forma, meaning \"shape.\" However, they are a very diverse order, including a wide range of shapes and sizes. They are the most variably sized order of vertebrates, ranging from the 7 millimeter (0.3 inch) long Schindleria brevipinguis to the 5 meter (16.5 foot) large Makaira species. They first appeared and diversified in the Late Cretaceous.\n\nPerciform fish typically have dorsal and anal fins divided into anterior spiny and posterior soft-rayed portions, which may be partially or completely separated. There are usually pelvic fins with one spine and up to five soft rays, either positioned by the throat or under the belly. Scales are usually ctenoid in form, though sometimes they are cycloid or otherwise modified. Various other, more technical characters define the group.\n\nMost members of Perciformes are marine shore fishes, and the perciforms dominate the vertebrate ocean life (Nelson 2006). Of the 10,000 perciforms, about 2,000—2,040 according to Nelson (2006)—live only in freshwater.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nClassification is unsettled. As traditionally defined, the Perciformes are almost certainly paraphyletic. Other orders that should possibly be included as suborders are the Scorpaeniformes, Tetraodontiformes, and Pleuronectiformes. Johnson and Patterson (1993) presented support that the Perciformes are considered to be a monophyletic group only if these three orders are also included. Of the presently recognized suborders, several may be paraphyletic as well.\n\nNelson (2006) recognizes 10,033 known species placed into about 1,539 genera, 160 families, and 20 suborders. Of the 160 families, 23 have a single species, and 52 families have a single genus. Over three-quarters of the species are placed into three suborders: Percoidei, Labroidei, and Gobiodei. Percoidei is the largest suborder, with about 3,176 species, 549 genera, and 79 families. About 55 percent of all species are placed into just the eight largest perciform families: Gobiidae, Cichlidae, Serranidae, Labridae, Blenniidae, Pomacentridae, Apogonidae, and Scianidae (Nelson 2006).\n\nSuborders and families\n\nThe following are grouped by suborder/superfamily, generally following Fishes of the World (Nelson 2006).\n\nSuborder Percoidei\n\nSuperfamily
