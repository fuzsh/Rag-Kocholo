        "text": "Background The Coral Triangle (CT), bounded by the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula, and New Guinea, is the epicenter of marine biodiversity. Hypotheses that explain the source of this rich biodiversity include 1) the center of origin, 2) the center of accumulation, and 3) the region of overlap. Here we contribute to the debate with a phylogeographic survey of a widely distributed reef fish, the Peacock Grouper (Cephalopholis argus; Epinephelidae) at 21 locations (N = 550) using DNA sequence data from mtDNA cytochrome b and two nuclear introns (gonadotropin-releasing hormone and S7 ribosomal protein). Results Population structure was significant (ΦST = 0.297, P F ST = 0.078, P F ST = 0.099, P French Polynesia, the central-west Pacific (Line Islands to northeastern Australia), Indo-Pacific boundary (Bali and Rowley Shoals), eastern Indian Ocean (Cocos/Keeling and Christmas Island), and western Indian Ocean (Diego Garcia, Oman, and Seychelles). A strong signal of isolation by distance was detected in both mtDNA (r = 0.749, P = 0.001) and the combined nuclear loci (r = 0.715, P mtDNA data (d = 0.008), corresponding to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with a low level of introgression observed outside a mixing zone at the Pacific-Indian boundary. Conclusions We conclude that the Indo-Pacific Barrier, operating during low sea level associated with glaciation, defines the primary phylogeographic pattern in this species. These data support a scenario of isolation on the scale of 105 year glacial cycles, followed by population expansion toward the CT, and overlap of divergent lineages at the Pacific-Indian boundary. This pattern of isolation, divergence, and subsequent overlap likely contributes to species richness at the adjacent CT and is consistent with the region of overlap hypothesis.\n\nAim There are several competing hypotheses to explain the high species richness of the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA) marine biodiversity hotspot centred within Southeast (SE) Asia. We use phylogenetic methods to provide a novel perspective on this problem using viviparous sea snakes, a group with high species richness in the IAA that is highly distinct from other taxa previously studied, both phylogenetically (Reptilia, Amniota) and biologically (e.g. viviparity and direct development). Location Indian Ocean and the West Pacific. Methods We used likelihood and Bayesian methods to reconstruct a multi-locus time-calibrated phylogeny for c. 70% of viviparous sea snake species, many sampled from multiple localities in Australasia, Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. We then compared rates and temporal concordance of inferred vicariance and dispersal events between marine basins using several approaches including new Bayesian analyses that allow for clade-specific and event-specific dispersal rates. Results Phylogenetic analyses and novel Bayesian biogeographical reconstructions indicate that viviparous sea snakes underwent rapid speciation after colonizing SE Asia c. 3 million years ago. Most of the SE Asian sea snake diversity is the result of in situ speciation, most consistent with the ‘centre of origin’ and ‘centre of refuge’ models for biodiversity hotspots. There is also speciation at the periphery, or entirely outside SE Asia; however, contrary to predictions of the ‘accumulation’ and ‘overlap’ models, these new outlying taxa do not preferentially disperse back into SE Asia. Instead, lineages are equally likely to disperse either into or away from SE Asia. Main conclusion The high diversity of sea snakes in SE Asia (and hence the IAA) is mostly explained by in situ speciation rather than accumulation or overlap. Most speciation events are contemporaneous with sea level changes that generated and dissolved barriers between marine basins during the last 2.5 million years."
