        "text": "Pisces are permanently aquatic vertebrates that has gills for respiration. They are devoid of the true spine. Fishes may be present in fresh, marine, and brackish water. The organs for locomotion in fishes are fins. However, fins are sometimes paired or unpaired. The study of fishes is ichthyology. Meanwhile, it is believed that they evolved from sea-squirt which is like a primitive fish.\n\nClassification of Pisces\n\nPisces consist of fish. The classification includes â€“\n\nKingdom- Animalia\n\nPhylum- Chordata\n\nSuper-class- Gnathostomata\n\nClass- Pisces\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThe characteristics of this class are-\n\nThey have a streamlined body.\n\nThe circulatory system is of close type.\n\nThe body has three regions- head, trunk, and tail.\n\nThe skeleton can be bony or cartilaginous.\n\nThe sexes are separate.\n\nA well-developed digestive system is present.\n\nNo extraembryonic membranes.\n\nFertilization either internal or external.\n\nThe body consists of scales, which acts as an external covering.\n\nThey can be herbivorous, carnivorous, or omnivorous.\n\nClassification of Pisces\n\nThey have divided into further three classes-\n\nPlacodermi\n\nThis class includes fishes that are extinct now. They consist of pre-historic fishes. The knowledge of these fishes is through fossils. Placoderms are the first fishes with jaws.\n\nThe characteristic of placoderms are-\n\nThey survived up to a Permian period of the Paleozoic era.\n\nThe endoskeleton is bony\n\nHeterocercal caudal fin were present in placodermi\n\nThey consist of two orders- firstly Arthrodiriformes, and secondly, Antiarchiformes.\n\nFor example- Climatius, Bothriolepis.\n\nChondrichthyes\n\nAnother name for Chondrichthyes is elasmobranch. The characteristics of class Chondrichthyes are-\n\nOperculum (covering of the gills) is absent.\n\nThey are present only in marine water.\n\nThe mouth is present on the ventral side of the body.\n\nCartilage composes the endoskeleton of the Chondrichthyes.\n\nThe skin consists of placoid scales. Placoid scales are sometimes referred to as denticles.\n\nThe caudal fin is heterocercal. Sharks possess heterocercal tails.\n\nThe air bladder is completely absent in these fishes.\n\nAmpulla of lorenzini is present.\n\nThey have an amphystylic or hyostylic jaw suspension. Further, in amphistylic jaw suspension, the upper jaw is braced against the cranium and gets its support by hyomandibular. Thus, this type of jaw suspension is present in some sharks.\n\nMales possess a pair of claspers. These claspers act as the reproductive part.\n\nThey are further divided into two subclasses- Selachi and Bradyodonti.\n\nFor example- Scoliodon, Pristis ( saw-fish), Chimaera, Stingray, etc.\n\nOsteichthyes\n\nThese are often called bony fishes. Moreover, this is the largest class of vertebrates. Moreover, it consists of about 29,000 species. They possess bony internal skeletons.\n\nThe characteristics of Osteichthyes are-\n\nThey are present in marine water, freshwater, or brackish water.\n\nThe claspers for male reproduction are absent.\n\nThe exoskeleton comprises placoid scales, ctenoid scales or, ganoid scales.\n\nThe jaw suspension of Osteichthyes is autostylic. In this type of jaw, the upper jaw is directly connected to the cranium.\n\nThe air bladder is usually present.\n\nIn addition, the covering of gills i.e. operculum is present in this class.\n\nThe Osteichthyes have three subclasses, firstly, Dipnoi, secondly, Crossopterygii, and last Actinopterygii.\n\nDipnoi consists of lungfishes, for example- South American lungfish\n\nCrossopterygii have fins in pairs that are for support in the water.\n\nFor example- Coelacanthimorpha, and Rhipidista.\n\nActinopterygii is a thin and elongated fish. Accessory respiratory organs are absent.\n\nFor example- Anglerfish, Mullet, Snakehead, Smelt, etc.\n\nRespiration\n\nRespiration in fishes occurs through gills. Gills are present on either side of the pharynx. The gaseous exchange takes place here. Oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released. For instance, sharks and lampreys have many gill openings. On the other hand, bony fishes have only one opening.\n\nMoreover, there are some fishes, which possess lungs for respiration. For example, West African lungfish, spotted lungfish, marbled lungfish.\n\nExcretion\n\nThe main excretion in fishes is urea. Therefore, they possess ureotelic excretion. However, gills can act as organs for excretion as well. The freshwater fishes excrete more water. In some of them, special organs like kidneys may be present.\n\nCirculation\n\nIn fishes, the flow of blood is in one direction only. It has a closed circulatory system. Moreover, it consists of a heart with two chambers only. The heart comprises four distinct parts- sinus venosus, the atrium, ventricle, and bulbous arteriosis. The blood is pumped from the heart to the gills. In addition, the blood gets oxygenated in the gills and then flows all over the body.\n\nDigestion\n\nFood is taken through the mouth. Breaking of food occurs in the oesophagus and digestion in the stomach. Pyloric caeca are present in some fishes. It is the finger-like pouches that secrete the digestive enzymes. Absorption of nutrients also occurs through it. The intestine is present for the absorption of nutrients.\n\nNervous System\n\nThe nervous system can be divided into two parts. Firstly the central nervous system (CNS) and secondly, the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. Also, the nervous system is the derivative of ectoderm.\n\nFurther, the peripheral nervous system connects nerves which connect the muscles and the sensory organs to CNS. The function of the nervous system is control and coordination during swimming. In some fishes like Scoliodon, there are ten cranial nerves present.\n\nSensory Organs\n\nThe sensory organs in Pisces include-\n\n1. Eyes\n\nThe eyes of fishes are adapted to see in the water. Moreover, they do not have lids in their eyes. The eye consists of many layers. They possess a spherical lens. Moreover, some fishes have the ability to see ultraviolet (UV) or polarized lights.\n\nSome fishes have primitive eyes. On the other hand, some have well-developed eyes.\n\n2. Hearing\n\nFor hearing they have, ears and lateral lines\n\nReproductive system\n\nThe sexual organs are internal. Female fish consists of ovaries and male fished testes. Moreover, the female fish produces eggs and males sperms. The eggs and sperms fuse i.e. fertilization.\n\nHowever, in most cases, they do not directly do mating. On the other hand, the female fish scatters her eggs in the water and the male ejects its sperms. Therefore, external fertilization happens.\n\nMoreover, in the fishes with internal fertilization, the eggs either hatch internally or are released before hatching.\n\nFAQs on Pisces\n\nQuestion 1- What are the characteristics of Pisces?\n\nAnswer 1- The characteristics of this class are-\n\nThey have a streamlined body.\n\nThe circulatory system is of close type.\n\nThe body has three regions- head, trunk, and tail.\n\nThe skeleton can be bony or cartilaginous.\n\nThe sexes are separate.\n\nA well-developed digestive system is present.\n\nFertilization either internal or external.\n\nThe body consists of scales, which acts as an external covering.\n\nQuestion 2- What are the three sub-classes of Pisces?\n\nAnswer 2- They have divided into three classes-\n\nPlacodermi\n\nThis class includes fishes that are extinct now. They consist of pre-historic fishes. Also, the knowledge of these fishes is through fossils. Placoderms are the first fishes with jaws. Further, heterocercal caudal fin were present in placodermi. They consist of two orders- firstly Arthrodiriformes, and secondly, Antiarchiformes.\n\nFor example- Climatius, Bothriolepis.\n\nChondrichthyes\n\nAnother name for Chondrichthyes is elasmobranch. The characteristics of class Chondrichthyes are, operculum (covering of the gills) is absent. They are present only in marine water. Moreover, the mouth is present on the ventral side of the body. Cartilage composes the endoskeleton of the Chondrichthyes.\n\nFor example- Scoliodon, Pristis (saw-fish), Chimaera\n\nOsteichthyes\n\nThese are often called bony fishes. Moreover, this is the largest class of vertebrates. It consists of about 29,000 species. They possess a bony internal skeleton. They are present in marine water, freshwater, or brackish water. For example- Mullet, Anglerfish, etc.\n\nQuestion 3- How do Pisces respire?\n\nAnswer 3- Respiration in fishes occurs through gills. Gills are present on either side of the pharynx. Moreover, there are some fishes, which possess lungs for respiration. For instance, West African lungfish, spotted lungfish, marbled lungfish."
