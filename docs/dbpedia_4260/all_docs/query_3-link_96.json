        "text": "what are the major innovations of body morphology in fishes?\n\n-the development of the operculum\n\n-continued specialisation of the mouth for feeding\n\n-the development of perctoral and PELVIC fins to support fins\n\n-the development of a swimbladder/lung\n\n-high efficieny of 02 intaketo allow for active lifestlyes\n\nwhat is the concept of neutral bouyancy and how do fish achieve this?\n\nneutral bouyancy explains how fish maintain the same density as the water around them and so can sit in water without sinking. they can acieve this through the use of swim bladders and primitive lungs\n\nwhat are the characteristics of ray-finned fishes(cl actinopterygii)?\n\n-modern bony fishes\n\n-have fins made from bones or cartilage\n\n-the tail is usually homocercal\n\n-skin has scales (mostly) and mucous glands\n\nwhat are the characteristics of lobe finned fishes (cl sacropterygii)?\n\n-diphycercal tail\n\n-thick, strong pelvic and pectoral fins\n\n-closest living relative to tetrapods\n\n-have lungs and gills\n\n-have external scales\n\nwhat is the largest and most diverse taxon?\n\nbony fishes (actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii)\n\nhow was the operculum created? i.e - from what structures was it modified into?\n\nthe operculum was made from the bony plates attached to the first gill arch\n\nwhat purpose does the swimbladder serve?\n\nit is used to help maintain bouyancy.\n\nas they go deeper into water, pressure becomes greater and they sink faster.\n\nwhat are they two methods for adjusting gas volumes in swmi bladder?\n\n-the pneumatic duct connects the swimbladder to the oesophogus and fish take gulps of air. restricts fish to shallow waters. generally used by more primative fish\n\n-gas control. blood circulated into rete (capilliaries before swim bladder). the release of lactic acid causes o2 to be released into the rete system (bohr's effect). when o2 pressure in rete exceeds that of swim bladder, o2 is diffused over. the ovalue reduces the amount of gas in swim bladder by opening onto a highly vascularised area which pulls o2 from swim bladder back into vessels\n\nwhat are the types of fin on a fish and what are their functions?\n\nthe pectoral and pelvic fins used for propolsion\n\nventral (anal) and dorsal fins used for stability and the caudal fin is used for lift and thrust.\n\nwhat are the different types of scales and what types of fish do they belong to?\n\nganoid scales (heavy, armour-like) - early ray-finned fishes\n\nctenoid and cycloid scales (light, thin and flexible) - modern ray-finned fishes\n\nwhich fish scale is thought to reduce drag?\n\nthe ctenoid scale of the modern ray-finned fishes\n\nwhat is the homocercal tail and which class of fish has this?\n\nthe homocercal tail is even lobed (top and bottom) and it belongs to cl actinptergyii (modern fishes)\n\nwhat are the characteristics of the fish class actinpterygii?\n\n-homocercal tail\n\n-bony or cartilaginous skeleton\n\n-vertebrate\n\n-skin with scales and mucous glands\n\nthe subclass chondrostei (cl actinpterygii) - what is it and what are it's characteristics?\n\npaddle fish and sawfish (primitive fishes)\n\n-ganoid scales\n\n-2 chambered heart\n\n-partially seperated venos and arterial systems\n\n-good eyesight\n\n-brain (cerebellum) controls motor coordination\n\ndescribe the reproduction of fishes\n\n-diecious\n\n-vivporous or oviporous\n\n-larval forms\n\nwhy is swimming the most efficient form of locomotion/\n\nsupported by wanter so don't need to overcome the force of gravity\n\ndescribe features present in the locomotion of fishes\n\nie. - muscle contractions, direction of tendons, pectoral, caudal and median fins,\n\n-alternate contractions on either side of body that pass from anterior to posterier\n\n-tendons run down to caudal peduncle\n\n-pectoral (manuverability) and median (stability) and caudal (thrust)"
