        "text": "Brook trout is a medium-sized freshwater fish. It is native to eastern United States and southern Canada from Newfoundland west to eastern Minnesota, south to northern New Jersey and eastern Iowa, and also south along the Appalachian Mountains to northern Georgia. It is a popular sport fish and has been stocked around the world since the 1800s. It is now widely distributed and locally established across Europe, Canada, and the United States. In Minnesota it is most common in the northeast. It is found in small, spring-fed streams that are cool, no more than 66°F; well oxygenated; and clear, mostly free of siltation.\n\nBrook trout is a medium-sized freshwater fish. It lives an average of 6 to 8 years in the wild in its native range, but has been known to survive up to 24 years in other areas. The average length at maturity is 15″ to 20″, though in Minnesota the average length is reported as just 8″ to 10″. The body is long, streamlined, and slightly compressed laterally. The mouth is large. During breeding season the male develops a hook on the lower jaw. The back is olive-green to dark brown or almost black with numerous worm-like pale spots. The sides are lighter with numerous round pale spots and smaller red spots. Each red spot has a thin bluish halo. The belly is silvery white. During spawning season the sides and fins of the male often become bright orangish-red."
