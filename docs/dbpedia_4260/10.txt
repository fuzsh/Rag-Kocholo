Actinopterygii is one of the two factions that define Osteichtyes, the other being the Sarcopterygii.[1]This faction is also known as ray-finned fishes, because their fins are supported by bone[2], instead of flesh in the Sarcopterygii.[3] It includes most of the Fish builds people can recognize, including Sturgeons, Salmon, Oarfishes, Piranhas and Bass.[4] It has 3 further subdivision, the Chondrosteans, the Holosteans and the Teleosts.[5]

History[]

Part 1:The Chondrosteans (and Palaeonisciformes)[]

Ray-finned fishes were first playable as a class in the Late Siluran, as Andreolepis[6], which belonged to a Faction called the Palaeonisciformes.[7] They specced into various playstyles, most notably the builds similar to builds like Tuna, except that they lived in freshwater. Along with them is Tarrasius, a build that borrowed the spinal column design from the tetrapods.[8] Mesozoic Chondrosteans include builds like Birgeria[9] and Sauricthys.[10] The current Chondrostean mains emerged during the Cretacous.[11] One of those builds was the Bawitius build, a build playable in the Kem Kem lobby.[12] Playable builds include the Bichirs, who are all playable in the African servers and are commonly kept as support classes[13], Sturgeons, who are the largest freshwater fish mains in the current meta[14], and the Paddlefishes, which recently lost a build in 2020.[15]

Part 2:The Holosteans[]

Holosteans are a megaFaction which first emerged in the Late Permian Expansion. While Palaeonisciformes is the original name for the megaFaction of the Chondrosteans, they first entered the meta under the name "Seminodontiformes".[16] They used to be the ones with the advantage in the Triassic and Jurassic expansions[17], of which in the latter expansion, they took their present name.[18] Their playerbase was screwed up during the Middle Jurassic by builds like Leedsichthys. Their situation got even worse in The Cretacous Expansion, with the arrival of the Tselfatiformes, Icthyodectids and the Lancetfishes. The few survivors, like Lepidotus, decide to respec into the builds we know today. Only 8 Holostean builds (Gars and Bowfin) are playable in the current meta, all in freshwater servers of North America.[19]

Part 3:The Teleosts[]

Teleosts first debutted during The Triassic Expansion under the name "Pholidophoriformes".[20] At first, they were at a disadvantage against the existing Holosteans previously mentioned.[21] That is, untill the Jurassic expansion, when they could already compete neck and neck with the better Pachycormid builds. In the Cretacous, however, they gradually began to outcompete the Holosteans with builds like Lancetfishes (mid-tier predator builds related to Pikes and Salmon)[22] and Icthyodectids (builds which are formerly related to Bonytongues, but has since been reassigned as a quasi-teleost Faction).[23] They owe their success to 1) Their special skill tree for their jaws , which grants a new ability known as [Jaw Pucker], which allows their [Swallow] move to be a temporary magnet.[24] 2)The [Genome Duplication] perk, which doubles Evolution Point gain, for a total of 8Ã—, throughout the entire meta[25], and 3) Homocercal tails, which increased their Mobility.[26] They also specced into a [Swim Bladder].[27] In the current meta, this megaFaction dominates the aquatic meta, with several builds opting to specc away from the classic Teleost plans. Electric Eels and Catfish respecced into Electro-Reception after the Neopterygii subclass lost it. Some builds, like the Clown Knifefish, decide to specc into a tail different from most Teleost builds. Some builds also have other gimmicks, like Mudskippers and Snakeheads, which copied the strategy also used by Lungfish.[28] Builds like Arapaima also appeared, speccing into armor on par with the Placoderms.[29]
