New office expansion enables Intragen to accelerate growth in professional services and customer support.

ESPOO, Finland, July 24, 2017 – Intragen Oy, a leader in professional services for Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) has recently moved into a new, larger office. This is to accommodate rapid growth and leverage the area’s diverse high-technology talent pool.

Our new office is located in Keilaranta, a concentration of technology companies located in Finland. Nearby are i.e. Microsoft, Rovio (Angry Birds) and many other well-known companies.

“With our strong growth, we needed more space and more diversity in our office space design. We also wanted to take the employees’ needs and wishes into account as much as possible. The final choice was made by our employees.

Work travel will also be easier with a new metro scheduled to be opened in Helsinki which will stop directly in our building.” says Samu Harrinvirta, country manager for Intragen, based in Helsinki.
