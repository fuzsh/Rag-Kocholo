Join Informatica and Microsoft as we team up to remove barriers to become a data driven organization.

What is the biggest challenge when building a data driven business with a modern data architecture?

When new architectures provide on-demand, unlimited capacity for all your business areas, how do you make the best use of these without jeopardizing data security and governance? How can your current data platform co-exist with the target solution?

Today, Informatica and Microsoft can provide a highly comprehensive and compelling data management offering to help customers simplify this journey. The collaboration between Microsoft and Informatica provides you with an accelerated path for their digital transformation. This enables you to truly begin integrating emerging technologies, such as AI and machine learning, into your business and helping you maximize the potential their data holds.

Join our seminar in Helsinki to learn more about how to achieve agility and scale and how to implement data discovery and accelerate migration with the support of the joint offerings from Informatica and Microsoft.
