Innofactor Campus

The Innofactor headquarters and Espoo office, Innofactor Campus, is located in Keilaranta 9 on historical property.

The premises is a unique environment with natural surroundings and a seaside sauna, partly designed by the renowned architect Aarne Ervi(1910-1977) originally as a holiday resort for Kansallis Bank's employees. As the main building, where the Campus restaurant is currently located, represented the finest Finnish design of its time, it was selected to accommodate European royalty during the 1952 Helsinki Olympics.

The main building functioned in the 1950's as the holiday resort's activity center where the bank's employees and their family members played the table game carrom among other things. Hence, the place was also called the Otaniemi casino.

The functionality, good traffic connections and location adjacent to the Aalto University are important factors.

In 1975 the Finnish government rented the property to the US delegation attending the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The property has also accommodated companies such as Danisco (former Cultor), Nokia and Tallink Silja.
