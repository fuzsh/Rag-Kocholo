Microsoft announced a â‚¬5,4 billion buyout of Nokia last fall, but the deal will not be finalized until this month, with antitrust and other administrative approvals to sell the company. However, Microsoft wants to enjoy its more than five billion Euros and thus does not want to continue supporting the Nokia brand. Nokia's name will change to Microsoft Mobile, and Nokia's mobile division will become Microsoft Mobile.

As such, Nokia can continue to appear under its original name, because Microsoft bought only the mobile division of the entire company, which will continue to focus on technology development. Microsoft announced the name change in an open letter in which it introduced Nokia under the new name for the first time. Nokia's mobile division itself, which Microsoft bought, was officially called Nokia Devices and Services. The original mobile division of Nokia, now Microsoft Mobile, will remain in Finland in the city of Espoo, but the address of the headquarters will change. Since the entire company is still in Finland, the full name is Microsoft Mobile Oy, where the abbreviation Oy stands for the trading company.
