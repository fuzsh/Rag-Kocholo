        "text": "In 2018, I blogged first time about risks related to Delegated Administrative Privileges (DAP) given to Microsoft partners. Now, in 2021, Microsoft blogged how NOBELIUM exploited DAP to compromise customers of some Microsoft partners.\n\nIn this blog, I’ll explain why DAP is so dangerous, how to exploit it, how to detect exploitation, and how to view partner related information with AADInternals v0.6.5.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to Microsoft documentation, partners has different types to choose from when working with their customers. In this blog, we are focusing on Delegated administrator partners.\n\nPartner type Description Reseller Partners that sell Microsoft products to your organization or school. Delegated administrator Partners that manage products and services for your organization or school. In Azure Active Directory (AD), the partner is a Global Administrator for your tenant. This role lets them manage services like creating user accounts, assigning and managing licenses, and password resets. Reseller & delegated administrator Partners that sell and manage Microsoft products and services to your organization or school. Partner You give your partner a user account in your tenant, and they work with other Microsoft services on your behalf. Advisor Partners can reset passwords and handle support incidents for you. Microsoft Products & Services Agreement (MPSA) partner If you’ve worked with multiple partners through the MPSA program, you can allow them to see purchases made by each other. Line-of-business (LOB) partner Partners can develop, submit, and manage LOB apps specific for your organization or school.\n\nDelegated Administrative Privileges (DAP) is a way to “outsource” administrative tasks to a Microsoft partner you trust. DAP can be included in a “contract” between a partner and a customer, which the partner offers and the customer accepts:\n\nAfter the partner’s contract offer (including DAP) is accepted by the customer, the partner has rights to administer customer’s tenant. By default, partner will have two roles: Global administrator and Helpdesk admistrator. These roles can be assigned to users of the Partner organisation in Partner’s tenant. In Partner center, these roles are called Admin agent and Heldesk agent:\n\nThe problem here is that you can’t limit partner users’ access to a certain tenant. That means that after assigning for example the Admin agent role to user of Partner tenant, that user has Global administrator access to all customers of the parter!\n\nNote: Microsoft announced in November 2021 granular delegated admin priviliges (GDAP) coming out in early 2022, which should address these issues.\n\nFrom the customer point-of-view, this is a huge problem as customers don’t have access to partner organisations. In practice, the customer doesn’t know how many Global administrators they have. For instance, in a figure above, the Customer C can have any number of Global administrators from Partner A and B tenants. This alone is violating many data-protection laws, including GDPR.\n\nSo, what’s the big deal with the DAP then? Well, instead of trying to breach multiple organisations, threat actors can focus on breaching one partner organisation. After that, threat actors has open doors to all customer tenants of the partner.\n\nAccessing partner information\n\nLet’s next see how the partner information and relationships can be viewed in Partner and Customer tenants.\n\nPartners\n\nPartners can access all partner information at the Microsoft Partner Center at https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/home\n\nPartner account identifiers\n\nPartners can manage and view their partner IDs and locations at https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/organization/identity\n\nFor the reasons unknown, this information (and all seen above) is available also for normal users, withouth admin permissions or rights to Microsoft Partner Center.\n\nNote! This behaviour has been reported to Microsoft (and later publicly shared) earlier in 2021 by another individual.\n\nThreat actors can’t use this information directly for attacks, but contains a lot of interesting intel for social engineering and phishing purposes..\n\nTo get the list of Partner locations with AADInternals:\n\nid : 9a0c7346-f305-4646-b3fb-772853f6b209 typeName : Tenant legalEntityCid : bc07db21-7a22-4fc9-9f8a-5df27532f09f MPNID : 8559543 companyName : Partner Ltd address : @{country=US; city=PARTNERVILLE; state=AT; addressLine1=666 Partner Park; addressLine2=; postalCode=1234567890} contact : @{firstName=Partner; lastName=Manager; email=pmanager@company.com; phoneNumber=+1 234567890} id : 60a0020f-bd16-4f27-a23c-104644918834 typeName : PartnerGlobal legalEntityCid : bc07db21-7a22-4fc9-9f8a-5df27532f09f MPNID : 8559542 companyName : Partner Ltd address : @{country=US; city=PARTNERVILLE; state=AT; addressLine1=666 Partner Park; addressLine2=; postalCode=1234567890} contact : @{firstName=Partner; lastName=Manager; email=pmanager@company.com; phoneNumber=+1 234567890} id : 297588a4-5c2a-430e-ae1e-b16c5d944a7d typeName : PartnerLocation name : Partner Ltd, US, PARTNERVILLE legalEntityCid : bc07db21-7a22-4fc9-9f8a-5df27532f09f MPNID : 8559543 companyName : Partner Ltd address : @{country=US; city=PARTNERVILLE; state=AT; addressLine1=666 Partner Park; addressLine2=; postalCode=1234567890} contact : @{firstName=Partner; lastName=Manager; email=pmanager@company.com; phoneNumber=+1 234567890}\n\nCustomer list\n\nThe most important information for threat actors would be to know the customers of the tenant. To view customers, the type of relationship, and links to administer their services, just browse to https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/commerce2/customers/list\n\nTo access Microsoft Partner Center, the user must have been given permissions to use it.\n\nHowever, luckily, the good old MSOnline PowerShell module have provided the same information since the beginning of times - without any admin rights or permissions to Microsoft Partner Center! This is now included also in AADInternals.\n\nTo view partner’s customers with AADInternals:\n\nCustomerName CustomerTenantId CustomerDefaultDomain ContractType ------------ ---------------- --------------------- ------------ Company dad33f16-69d1-4e32-880e-9c2d21aa3e59 company.com SupportPartnerContract Contoso 936b7883-4746-4b89-8bc4-c8128795cd7f contoso.onmicrosoft.com ResellerPartnerContract Adatum 17427dcd-8d61-4c23-9c68-d1f34975b420 adatum.com SupportPartnerContract\n\nAnd voilà, there’s the list of organisations this partner can administer!\n\nCustomers\n\nCustomer’s admins can view the list of partners and remove their admin rights at https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/partners\n\nUnfortunately, this information is not available for normal users.\n\nTo view partners with AADInternals:\n\nIdentity : b1f6d5cc-f1d3-41d9-b88c-1d177aaf171b DisplayName : Partner Ltd Email : pmanager@company.com Website : http://www.company.com Phone : +1234567890 Relationship : Indirect Reseller and Admin TypeDetail : PartnerAdmin CanDelete : False CanRemoveDap : True AllDataRetrieved : True\n\nExploiting\n\nLet’s jump to the shoes of threat actor: How can we exploit all what we have learned?\n\nFinding a partner\n\nFirst step for a threat actor is to find suitable partners to target. Microsoft has made this easy, as you can search for partners at AppSource portal.\n\nAADInternals makes this even more easy:\n\nOutput:\n\nEstimated total matches: 511 TenantId CompanyName Country Address -------- ----------- ------- ------- b3665057-2eaa-4fa7-9f45-c4a17f405fb6 Atea Finland Oy FI @{country=FI; region=Europe; city=Vantaa... cf36141c-ddd7-45a7-b073-111f66d0b30c Avanade Inc.

There are multiple techniques for this, such as phishing, brute-forcing, or on-prem attacks (Golden SAML).\n\nAt this point, any user account will do, as after getting the access, we can run AADInternals’ recon tool:\n\nOutput:\n\nTenant brand: Company Ltd Tenant name: company.onmicrosoft.com Tenant id: 6e3846ee-e8ca-4609-a3ab-f405cfbd02cd Azure AD objects: 520/500000 Domains: 6 (4 verified) Non-admin users restricted? True Users can register apps? True Directory access restricted? False Directory sync enabled? true CA policies: 8 MS Partner IDs: 8559542,8559543 MS Partner DAP enabled? True MS Partner contracts: 3 MS Partners: 1\n\nThis reveals that we have indeed accessed a partner organisation, having 3 customers. We can now list the customers:\n\nCustomerName CustomerTenantId CustomerDefaultDomain ContractType ------------ ---------------- --------------------- ------------ Company dad33f16-69d1-4e32-880e-9c2d21aa3e59 company.com SupportPartnerContract Contoso 936b7883-4746-4b89-8bc4-c8128795cd7f contoso.onmicrosoft.com ResellerPartnerContract Adatum 17427dcd-8d61-4c23-9c68-d1f34975b420 adatum.com SupportPartnerContract\n\nNext step is to list users who has Admin Agent or Helpdesk Agent roles:\n\ndisplayName userPrincipalName ----------- ----------------- Admin User admin@company.onmicrosoft.com Diego Siciliani DiegoS@contoso.com Alex Wilber AlexW@contoso.com\n\nAnd now we have found the target users!\n\nThe next step is to sign-in to the Microsoft Partner Center as the target user, or use MSOnline PowerShell module:\n\nYou can also use most of the AADInternals functions:\n\nAllowAdHocSubscriptions : true AllowEmailVerifiedUsers : true AuthorizedServiceInstances : AuthorizedServiceInstances AuthorizedServices : City : CompanyDeletionStartTime : CompanyTags : CompanyTags CompanyType : CompanyTenant CompassEnabled : Country : CountryLetterCode : US DapEnabled : DefaultUsageLocation : DirSyncAnchorAttribute : mS-DS-ConsistencyGuid DirSyncApplicationType : 1651564e-7ce4-4d99-88be-0a65050d8dc3 DirSyncClientMachineName : SERVER DirSyncClientVersion : 1.4.38.0 DirSyncServiceAccount : Sync_SERVER1_xxxxxxxxxxx@company.onmicrosoft.com DirectorySynchronizationEnabled : true DirectorySynchronizationStatus : Enabled DisplayName : Company Ltd InitialDomain : company.onmicrosoft.com LastDirSyncTime : 2020-08-03T15:29:34Z LastPasswordSyncTime : 2020-08-03T15:09:07Z MarketingNotificationEmails : MultipleDataLocationsForServicesEnabled : ObjectId : 527e940d-2526-483b-82a9-d5b6bf6cc165 PasswordSynchronizationEnabled : true PortalSettings : PortalSettings PostalCode : PreferredLanguage : en ReleaseTrack : FirstRelease ReplicationScope : NA RmsViralSignUpEnabled : true SecurityComplianceNotificationEmails : SecurityComplianceNotificationPhones : SelfServePasswordResetEnabled : true ServiceInformation : ServiceInformation ServiceInstanceInformation : ServiceInstanceInformation State : Street : SubscriptionProvisioningLimited : false TechnicalNotificationEmails : TechnicalNotificationEmails TelephoneNumber : 1324567890 UIExtensibilityUris : UsersPermissionToCreateGroupsEnabled : true UsersPermissionToCreateLOBAppsEnabled : true UsersPermissionToReadOtherUsersEnabled : true UsersPermissionToUserConsentToAppEnabled : true WhenCreated : 2019-07-14T07:03:20Z\n\nAdding a new partner to compromised organisation\n\nOne way to achieve persistent access to already compromised organisation is to add a partner tenant that is controlled by the threat actor.\n\nWith Global admin level access to compromised organisation, AADInternals can be used to easily add new partners. You just need to know any domain name or tenant id of the partner.\n\nresponseCode message ------------ ------- success\n\nCompromising new customers\n\nThe example above requires Global administrator access to customer’s tenant. But what if we don’t have the needed access? The answer is to create a link for approving the partner offer and then lure target organisation administrator to accept that.\n\nAgain, all you need to know is any domain name or tenant id of the partner.\n\nhttps://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?invType=Administration&partnerId=c7e52a77-e461-4f2e-a652-573305414be9#/BillingAccounts/partner-invitation\n\nNow the link can be sent to any target organisations 😊\n\nDetecting\n\nPartner accessing customer organisation\n\nMicrosoft Partner Center and API access\n\nIf the partner is accessing customers services from the Microsoft Partner Center, the login event will be shown in customer’s sign-ins (interactive) log:\n\nAs we can see, the user name is actually “ technician”, and the last part of IP address is redacted. When the event is expanded, we can also see the actual user name:\n\nIn partner’s tenant, we can see the same event with the same Request ID:\n\nSome events are also seen in customer’s sign-ins (non-interactive) log:\n\nPowerShell access\n\nIf the parter (or threat actor) is using MSOnline PowerShell module, sign-in events are not logged anywhere! This means that threat actor can, for instance, dump the whole content of customer’s Azure Active Directory without a fear of getting caught 🤦‍\n\nHowever, all modifications are logged normally to customer’s Audit logs:\n\nAdding new partners\n\nWhenever a new partner is added to the organisation, there will be an event in the Audit Logs:\n\nPreventing/mitigating\n\nPartner accessing customer organisation\n\nMicrosoft announced in November 2021 a new more granular DAP called GDAP, which will allow partners to have more granular and time-bound access to their customers. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) recommends partners to move using GDAP:\n\nWe highly recommend moving away from the current DAP model (which gives admin agents standing or perpetual global admin access) to a fine-grained delegated access model. The fine-grained delegated access model reduces the security risk to customers, and the impact on them as well. It also gives you control and flexibility to restrict access per customer at the workload level of your employees who are managing your customers’ services and environments.\n\nWhile GDAP will reduce risk, it doesn’t remove it completely. The only way to prevent this is to get rid off all DAP permissions - which I urge everyone to do immediately!\n\nBut what does this mean in practice? According to Microsoft documentation:\n\nYou can remove admin roles from a partner at any time. Removing the admin roles doesn’t remove the partner relationship. They can still work with you in a different capacity, such as a Reseller. If you decide that you don’t want to work with a partner anymore, contact your partner to end the relationship.\n\nThis means that you can safely remove DAP roles, it has no effect on other type of relationships. However, as pointed by Petr Vlk (@Kazzan), DAP is required by Microsoft Office 365 Lighthouse, an admin portal for Managed Service Providers (MSPs) for managing at scale multiple SMB organisations.\n\nMy standpoint is always the security of customers, which overrules the business benefits of partners. Therefore, the correct (secure) way to give partners access to your tenant is to create them accounts that you manage.\n\nCustomer’s Global administrators can remove DAP at https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/partners:\n\nTo remove DAP with AADInternals as customer’s Global administrator:\n\nresponseCode message ------------ ------- success success success\n\nAdding new partners\n\nOnly way to prevent this is to minimise the number or Global administrators, and/or allowing them to access Azure AD only from Pivileged Access Workstations (PAWs).\n\nSummary\n\nDelegated Administrative Privileges (DAP) are dangerous and out-dated way to give administrator access to your tenant for your partners or service providers.\n\nThreat actors are targeting partner organisations as compromising a single partner tenant gives them access to all partner’s customers too.\n\nI suggest all admins to remove all DAP permissions to secure their tenants. Removing DAP doesn’t remove the partner relationship, so it doesn’t affect any licensing contracts you may have. This does, however, remove all partner access via PowerShell and APIs, including Microsoft 365 Lighthouse.\n\nIf you need to give admin access to your partners, create a dedicated accounts for each partner (and user) to your tenant so that you can manage the accounts.\n\nReferences"
