        "text": "üìç This marks my last day at Cloud2 Oy I joined the bandwagon in October 2019 when all of us were happily unaware about upcoming pandemic years. Today, 4 years and 5 months later, I'm totally different professional that I was when I started. These decisions are never easy and it was not easy for me either. Having the most awesome colleagues just made it that much more difficult. But decisions have to be made. I want to (again, publicly this time) thank Henri Gr√∂nlund, Pekka Kujala, Kimmo Hassinen, Tagoror Sundstr√∂m for taking a risk on inexperienced #azure enthusiast. We made good things together; got awarded, achieved #microsoft competencies, built a Microsoft consultancy #team. And now you will continue to make good things happen; that I already know. This was a ride of a lifetime and I'm #thankful! I also want to thank Isabella Pikkarainen for being the best caretaker there is! Mikko Ilari Laakkonen for having trust in me in times where I didn't have trust in myself. Shoichi Sekine for helping me out multiple times when things got tough, and I needed the support. There's at least a battalion of #colleagues that I'd like to mention here, and you know who you are. Last, but not least, I'd like to thank Ensti Kentala for taking your time and making that call today with no rush. We had a discussion which meant a world to me and made me really feel #appreciated, like it has been for the past 4 years and 5 months. Thank you for that! ‚ù§Ô∏è Next chapter starting 19th, so I will take a breather now."
