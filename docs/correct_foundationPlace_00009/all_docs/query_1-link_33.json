As the main building, where the Campus restaurant is currently located, represented the finest Finnish design of its time, it was selected to accommodate European royalty during the 1952 Helsinki Olympics.\n\nThe main building functioned in the 1950's as the holiday resort's activity center where the bank's employees and their family members played the table game carrom among other things. Hence, the place was also called the Otaniemi casino.\n\nThe functionality, good traffic connections and location adjacent to the Aalto University are important factors.\n\nIn 1975 the Finnish government rented the property to the US delegation attending the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). The property has also accommodated companies such as Danisco (former Cultor), Nokia and Tallink Silja."
