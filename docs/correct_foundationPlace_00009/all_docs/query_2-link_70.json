        "text": "Hi @Huzaifa Saleem ,\n\nThanks for reaching out.\n\nThe error AADSTS50020: User account '{EmailHidden}' from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant usually occurs when you sign in to Azure Portal using your personal account which is not added as an external/guest user to an Azure AD/Microsoft Entra tenant.\n\nSince you are connected to the tenant as a standard user with restricted access, you cannot perform actions such as creating new users, groups, enterprise applications, and so on. To perform administrative actions, you must have administrative access to the tenant.\n\nFor this purpose, you need to create your own tenant. When you create a new tenant, you by default become the Global Administrator of the new tenant and have full access to all the options in that tenant.\n\nTo create a new tenant, open in-private/incognito browser window (just to avoid SSO), access https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ to create a free Azure account.\n\nOnce the new account is created, you should be able to see and switch to the new tenant by clicking on the settings icon as highlighted below:\n\nAlternatively, you can ask the global administrator or any existing Azure AD/Microsoft Entra tenant to invite you as a guest user as mentioned here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/external-identities/add-users-administrator#add-guest-users-to-the-directory. Once you are added to an Entra tenant and you accept the invite sent to you via email, you can use https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory URL to create your own tenant as well.\n\nNote: Since your question contains personal information, I have redacted your email address to address GDPR-related concerns.\n\nHope this will help.\n\nThanks,\n\nShweta"
