The estimate of the adjustments made for net working capital and cash earnings was slightly positive for Nokia, and we currently expect the total transaction price to be slightly higher than the earlier-announced transaction price of EUR 5.44 billion after the final adjustments are made based on the verified closing balance sheet.\n\nAdditionally, as is customary for transactions of this size, scale and complexity, Nokia and Microsoft made certain adjustments to the scope of the assets originally planned to transfer. These adjustments included Nokias manufacturing facilities in Chennai in India and Masan in the Republic of Korea not transferring to Microsoft. These adjustments have no impact on the material deal terms of the transaction and Nokia will be materially compensated for any retained liabilities.\n\nIn India, our manufacturing facility is subject to an asset freeze by the Indian tax authorities as a result of ongoing tax proceedings. Consequently, the facility remains part of Nokia following the closing of the transaction. Nokia and Microsoft have\n\n1\n\nentered into a service agreement whereby Nokia would produce mobile devices for Microsoft.\n\nIn Korea, Nokia and Microsoft agreed to exclude the Masan facility from the scope of the transaction. Nokia will now take steps to close the facility, which employs approximately 200 people.\n\nAmid the uncertainty for our employees in Chennai and because of the planned closure of our facility in Masan, Nokia plans to offer a program of support, including financial assistance which would give our employees the chance to explore opportunities outside Nokia starting from a sound financial base. The company plans to bring to Chennai and Masan elements of its Bridge program, which we have made available for employees affected by company changes in other sites.\n\nThe convertible bonds issued by Nokia to Microsoft following the announcement of the transaction have been redeemed and netted against the deal proceeds by the amount of principal and accrued interest.\n\nAs previously announced, the following Nokia leaders have stepped down from the Nokia Leadership Team and transferred to Microsoft at closing, effective April 25, 2014: Stephen Elop, Jo Harlow, Juha Putkiranta, Timo Toikkanen, and Chris Weber. Until further notice, Nokias interim governance model announced on September 3, 2013 is in place.\n\nNokia plans to cover in further detail aspects of the closing of the transaction in conjunction with its first quarter 2014 results announcement on April 29, 2014.\n\n2\n\nNow that the closing of this transaction has taken place, Nokia is arranging a Board of Directors meeting for early next week in relation to its strategy assessment which was originally disclosed on September 3, 2013.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nIt should be noted that Nokia and its business are exposed to various risks and uncertainties and certain statements herein that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding: A) purchase price adjustments related to the sale by Nokia of substantially all of Nokias Devices & Services business, including Smart Devices and Mobile Phones (referred to below as Sale of the D&S Business) pursuant to the Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 2, 2013, between Nokia and Microsoft International Holdings B.V.; B) expectations with respect to production facilities; C) expectations, plans or benefits related to or caused by the Sale of the D&S Business; D) expectations, plans or benefits related to Nokias strategies, including plans for Nokia with respect to its continuing businesses that were not be divested in connection with the Sale of the D&S Business; E) expectations, plans or benefits related to changes in leadership and operational structure; F) expectations and targets regarding our operational priorities, financial performance or position, results of operations and use of proceeds from the Sale of the D&S Business; and G) statements preceded by believe, expect, anticipate, foresee, sees, target, estimate, designed, aim, plans, intends, focus, will or similar expressions.

The holdings notified relate to EUR 1.5 billion financing in the form of three convertible bonds (Bonds) issued by Nokia and subscribed for by Microsoft on September 2013. The conversion of the Bonds would have resulted in the acquisition of Nokia shares and related voting rights. If all the Bonds had been converted into shares of Nokia this arrangement could have led to bondholders holdings in Nokia to be altogether 367 524 324 shares and voting rights, representing 8.9 % of all the shares and voting rights in Nokia as calculated based on current amount of shares added with shares from conversion of the Bonds.\n\nMicrosoft Asia Island Limited and Microsoft Mobile Oy announced that Microsoft Asia Island Limiteds holdings in Nokia shares based on the Bonds have decreased below 5% on April 24, 2014 after it assigned the Bonds to Microsoft Mobile Oy and, consequently, Microsoft Mobile Oys holdings were raised above 5%.\n\nIn accordance with our agreement with Microsoft, the Bonds were redeemed at closing of the sale of substantially all of Nokias Devices & Services business to Microsoft and the nominal value and accrued interest of the Bonds were netted against the proceeds from the sale. Consequently, Microsoft Mobile Oys holdings in Nokia decreased below 5% at closing on April 25, 2014 as the bonds were redeemed.\n\n1\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant, Nokia Corporation, has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\n\nDate: April 25, 2014\n\nNokia Corporation\n\nBy:\n\n/s/ Riikka Tieaho\n\nName:\n\nRiikka Tieaho\n\nTitle:\n\nVice President, Corporate Legal\n\n3"
