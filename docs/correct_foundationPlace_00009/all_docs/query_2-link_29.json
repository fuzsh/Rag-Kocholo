I usually get many new ideas while doing the modeling work – the possibilities with Fluidit Heat are endless.“\n\n“We were pleased with the software deployment process and how it was implemented. Everything was completed on budget and on schedule, which is not self-evident in most cases.”\n\n“We have been working with Fluidit in regards to analyzing water and wastewater networks. We are using their software and expertise on various design tasks and gaining information for operation. We want to make decisions based on knowledge, and that’s exactly what deep analysis provides us.”\n\n“Fluidit’s specialists teach our students and researchers of Water and Environmental Engineering with their modeling software to understand the operation and behavior of water and wastewater systems. Fluidit actively leads the whole water industry into more intelligent direction with their research-oriented approach.”\n\n“Fluidit Heat offers comprehensive tools and an intuitive user interface for analyzing complex district energy systems. The most remarkable strengths of the software include the calculation speed of the simulator and the broad range of easy visualization tools for simulation results.”\n\n“A great advantage is the possibility to utilize Python scripts for performing analysis comprising thousands of simulations that would otherwise require a huge amount of time and manual labor. Add the expertise of Fluidit’s team and it is guaranteed that not a single district energy system related issue will be left unsolved.”\n\n“I see many advantages in the software. For example: easy data transfer from other systems, powerful Digital Elevation Model (DEM) tools, and the in-built GIS that eliminates the need to switch between systems.”\n\n“Fluidit has showcased significant flexibility in modeling, with our own competence becoming the primary limitation rather than the software.”\n\n“In Sweco Finland, we replaced our previous hydraulic modeling software with Fluidit’s products. Our modelers are happy with these modern and comprehensive tools and Fluidit’s great software support.”\n\n“We were primarily interested in a calculation and simulation tool that works with geographic information systems (GIS), making it easy to import, manipulate, present and export maps. Fluidit ticked all the boxes. For example, we really liked the colour coding for temperature, pressure, speed and direction of matter within the network.”\n\n“Collaboration with Fluidit has been smooth and productive. HSY now has an efficient combined sewer network model for holistic network analysis and planning. We are looking forward to teaming up with Fluidit to push the model even further and continue building capacity at HSY.”\n\n“User-Friendly and feature-rich tool with integrated GIS, which is a plus. It seemed like complex networks and systems would not be a problem. The scenario tool using base- and child scenarios is very helpful.”\n\n“Whether it is about exchanging ideas or getting software support, Fluidit’s response has always been prompt and professional.”\n\n“The use of Fluidit Heat has already resulted in significant savings in investment costs. In one renovation project, we were able to determine that we could use pipes that were three dimensions smaller than we had initially planned, resulting in substantial savings in material and transportation expenses.”\n\n“The model development process was engaging. We met with Fluidit almost weekly to discuss the project and find solutions to any issues we faced. It feels like we have developed the model together.”\n\n”While we are still in the early phases of building models of our systems, we are already getting great value through understanding the impact of changes in the system, and thus making better decisions. Modeling should be an essential part of our daily operations in the future.”\n\n”I oversee models for water distribution, district heating and sewer systems, so it is a great advantage to be able to work in the same interface in different distribution systems.”\n\n“The experts at Fluidit provide excellent service and are very supportive in guiding us in the right direction. Their solutions are easy to use and offer numerous ways to analyze simulation results.”\n\n“I like how easily I can visualize the network data, GIS background layers and simulation results, and create professional graphical illustrations using Heat’s built-in tools. And better yet, I can do this with multiple scenarios to develop robust comparisons and quickly identify undersized pipelines.”"
