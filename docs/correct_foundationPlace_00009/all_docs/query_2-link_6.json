        "text": "Microsoft Corporation\n\nOne Microsoft Way\n\nRedmond, Washington 98052-6399\n\nU.S.A\n\n(206) 882-8080\n\nFax: (206) 883-8101\n\nPublic Company\n\nIncorporated: 1975 as Microsoft Inc.\n\nEmployees: 8,200\n\nSales: $2 billion\n\nStock Exchanges: Midwest OTC\n\nMicrosoft, the world’s largest designer of software languages and applications for personal computers, was started in 1975 by William Gates and Paul Allen as a vehicle for developing microcomputer operating systems—languages which control basic functions, including how data enters and leaves a computer’s memory. The name Microsoft was created from a contraction of the words “microcomputer” and “software.” Gates, then 19, and Allen, 21, were putting the finishing touches on their first language, Microsoft BASIC, designed for the first inexpensive microcomputer, the MITS Altair. Gates soon followed-up Microsoft BASIC with a disk-managing program called DiskBASIC.\n\nGates and Allen were both math and programming prodigies who had spent most of their spare time since their early teens playing with computers and writing programming codes. Gates, who was studying law at Harvard, made certain that the contract Microsoft signed with MITS allowed the hardware developer to use and market the software, but retained ownership of the language for Microsoft—a relationship between software designers and those using their products which became the model for future software licensing agreements and is still widely used.\n\nGates felt that microcomputers would eventually become immensely popular, and in hopes of Microsoft becoming the biggest supplier of software for the industry, he diligently helped convince corporations of the nascent microcomputer industry’s viability. As a result, some of Microsoft’s first orders were from Fortune 500 firms like General Electric. As his business expanded and new microprocessors entered the market, Gates began hiring other programmers to help carry the load. By the end of 1976 he had four programmers working under him and Microsoft had opened an office in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where MITS was located. Gates dropped out of Harvard to devote full attention to his company.\n\nIn 1977 the Apple II was unveiled and Radio Shack stores had begun selling Tandy computers; both Apple and Tandy bought licenses for a version of BASIC. Microsoft’s sales reached $500,000, despite the firm’s involvement in a lawsuit. When ownership of MITS changed hands in 1977, the new owners claimed that MITS owned the rights to Microsoft’s BASIC. Microsoft won the case, but the firm’s BASIC fees were held during the suit, causing temporary cash flow problems. In the meantime the Tandy and Apple machines were selling much more quickly than previous microcomputers had sold. Other manufacturers, including Atari and Commodore, entered the booming microcomputer market.\n\nTo help preserve cash flow, Microsoft released FORTRAN and COBOL programming languages in July of 1977 and June of 1978, respectively. These two languages were written for the control program for microcomputer, or CP/M operating system, one of many available in the then unstandardized microcomputer market. Fortunately for Microsoft, a number of firms, including Sirius, Zenith and Sharp, chose CP/M as the operating system for their new computers. As a result, Microsoft became the leading distributor for microcomputer languages.\n\nWhen larger firms like Texas Instruments began entering the microcomputer field, they also decided to use Microsoft’s languages. In 1978 Microsoft formed a Japanese subsidiary and began sales in Japan. By the end of the year the company had 13 employees and had racked up sales of $1 million. In January of 1979, Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington, near Seattle, where Gates and Allen had grown up.\n\nMicrocomputer technology was growing rapidly. Intel released a 16-bit chip, the 8086, in late 1978; Microsoft finished developing BASIC for the new chip the following June. The 16-bit chip could handle far more memory than the previous 8-bit chip, meaning that microcomputers could perform more sophisticated tasks. By the end of 1979 Microsoft had a contract to develop FORTRAN for the 8086 chip, and had created a retail sales division for consumers. The firm now had 25 employees and $2.5 million in sales; Microsoft BASIC had sold about 1 million copies worldwide.\n\nIn the meantime Apple II, which used a microprocessor and operating system incompatible with CP/M applications, had become the top-selling computer. Microsoft seized an opportunity by developing a card that enabled the Apple II to use CP/M and Microsoft BASIC. The SoftCard sold 25,000 copies the first year, and introduced Microsoft to the rapidly growing base of Apple customers. Application software, particularly for Apple computers, sold quickly enough that Microsoft decided to expand into the software market.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (IBM), by far the biggest computer maker in the world, noticed the rapid growth of the microcomputer market and was determined to gain entry. IBM decided to follow Apple’s strategy of encouraging other companies to develop necessary software, and eventually selected Microsoft to devise an operating language for the IBM microcomputer. On November 6, 1980, IBM and Microsoft signed a contract specifying that Microsoft would supply IBM with four languages and an operating system. The deal was a major coup for tiny Microsoft and its 25-year-old cofounder Gates.\n\nTo please the security-conscious IBM, the Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS—one of the most important products in computer history— was developed in a small windowless room. Because IBM insisted on a tight time frame, Microsoft bought an operating system from Seattle Computer Products. The system still required modifications, however, and Microsoft struggled to stay on schedule. IBM announced its microcomputer, now known as the personal computer, or PC, on August 12, 1981.\n\nMS-DOS Version 1.0 took up 12K (kilobytes) of memory, a fair-sized program at the time, but minuscule compared to software sizes just a few years later. Microsoft also released languages for the IBM computer and two applications: a typing program and a game. Because DOS was modeled after the CP/M operating system, software for CP/M computers could be quickly rewritten for DOS.\n\nFor two years after the release of the IBM personal computer MS-DOS and CP/M battled for domination of the microcomputer market. The easy adaptability of CP/M programs for DOS, coupled with IBM’s enormous prestige, helped MS-DOS gradually pull ahead. While MS-DOS sold for much less than CP/M, the final blow was probably the release of Lotus 1-2-3 in 1983, a spreadsheet program that only ran on DOS. By 1983 most large computer manufacturers, with the important exception of Apple, had decided to offer computers that were compatible with IBM standards—which meant they used MS-DOS as their operating system. Partly because IBM’s entry had changed the image of microcomputers from toy to serious business tool, the PC market was growing exponentially: in 1980, 300,000 people owned microcomputers; three years later nearly 10 times that number did. As a result of this explosive growth, 500,000 copies of MS-DOS had been sold by the end of 1983, carrying Microsoft’s annual sales to $69 million.\n\nAs soon as the massive task for IBM was completed, Microsoft focused upon application software, releasing Multiplan, an electronic spreadsheet designed to compete with VisiCalc—the best-selling software package at that time. Multiplan was introduced with the biggest advertising campaign Microsoft had used to that date, and initial reviews were encouraging. Microsoft began developing programs that could run on IBMs, Apples, and CP/M computers with a minimum of modifications. However, soon after the release of Multiplan, Lotus released the heavily advertised 1-2-3, which promptly ran away with the spreadsheet market, replacing VisiCalc as the world’s first choice in software. Lotus’s product was designed for computers with 256K of memory, while Microsoft’s program only functioned on 64K IBM machines, and therefore, had limited capabilities. Multiplan had sigificant success in Europe, though, which prompted Microsoft to establish subsidiaries in England, France, and West Germany by the end of 1983.\n\nIn July of 1981 the firm, formerly a partnership between Gates and Allen, was reorganized as a privately held corporation. In November of 1981, Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington. The following July, while Gates remained chairman and CEO, James C. Towne was named president. However, Gates dismissed him 11 months later and named Jon Shirley, a former Tandy vice-president, as Towne’s replacement. Allen had left due to health problems, and Shirley’s presence freed Gates to concentrate on long term strategies.\n\nBy the end of 1982, 50 microcomputer manufacturers were licensed to use MS-DOS, and Microsoft had 200 employees. The firm was nearly doubling in size every year, and had not yet adapted to being a large company. Gates, whose volatile temperament was well known in the computer industry, had exacerbated Microsoft’s chaos by abruptly changing product specifications and moving developers around. Shirley quickly professionalized the company’s financial management, inventory, and accounting, which had been in disarray.\n\nBack in the marketplace, word processing software was dominated by WordStar, which had sold more than 1 million copies despite requiring users to learn numerous complicated commands. Gates sensed the need for a more user-friendly word program. Microsoft Word, released in April of 1983, used a mouse to move the cursor around and choose comands and was able to display boldface, italics, and other typefaces on the computer screen. In addition, Microsoft Word was designed to work with laser printers— capable of producing near-typeset quality documents. The program, priced at $375, was cheaper than WordStar. As further persuasion for WordStar users, Microsoft Word could read WordStar files and convert them to Microsoft Word format. Microsoft pushed the new program heavily with an advertising campaign and the distribution of demonstration copies.\n\nReviews of the program were divided, with many full of praise; but some analysts claimed Microsoft Word was difficult to learn, seemingly aimed more at software engineers than consumers. WordPerfect Corporation had released a powerful but user-friendly, self-named package which indeed proved “perfect” for a market of consumers still wary of computers. Sales of Microsoft Word, hampered by WordPerfect, were mediocre in the United States, though the product did relatively well in Europe.\n\nMicrosoft had often been criticized for first releases that were too hard to learn and not quite up to speed, but Gates always pressed on, doing market research and strengthening weak points. Microsoft Word finally became popular with the release of Word 3.0 in April of 1986, which included an online tutorial. The new version became Microsoft’s best-seller, but even so, could not surpass the sales of WordPerfect.\n\nApple released the revolutionary, and immensely popular, Macintosh personal computer in January of 1984. The Macintosh, or Mac, was designed with user-friendliness as the primary consideration. In contrast to IBM PCs, which used letters and numbers to communicate, the Mac had a graphical user interface which communicated with users via small pictures, or icons; users pointed at icons with a mouse and clicked to perform tasks. Gates had talked with Apple executives during the creation of the Macintosh and was very impressed. He believed the graphical user interface was the future of computing.\n\nThe Macintosh came with its own word processing program, MacWrite. Microsoft was slated to release a version of Word for the Macintosh, but suffered repeated delays; the package was not released until January of 1985. Word for the Macintosh could read MacWrite files, but retained some problems common to DOS. By the time Word 3.0 for the Macintosh was released, two years later, Macintosh users were tired of the limitations of MacWrite, still the only word processing program for the Macintosh. Sales of Word for the Macintosh immediately took off and Microsoft was soon selling 20,000 copies each month at $395 per copy. By the time WordPerfect released a version for the Macintosh, Word had captured the Macintosh word processing market.\n\nBy this point Microsoft had annual sales of $590 million and employed 2,800 people. This meteoric growth was not simply due to the popularity of Word and DOS; rather, Microsoft had released a number of other products, including another spreadsheet program. Microsoft had reworked Multiplan, stressing quicker calculations, graphing, and the ability to link spreadsheets; the package was renamed Excel. Because Lotus 1-2-3 had become the IBM standard, Microsoft decided to switch development of the new spreadsheet to the Macintosh. Lotus was developing an integrated program for the Macintosh called Jazz that also included a spreadsheet. Gates stuck to developing an advanced spreadsheet, believing integrated programs were a compromise. Microsoft worried that Jazz might steal the Macintosh market and advertised heavily, but Jazz—slow and lacking key features—flopped. By early 1986 Excel dominated the Macintosh spreadsheet market.\n\nMicrosoft continued to derive about half its profits from sales of the Disk Operating System, but with the advent of Word and Excel, Microsoft became the biggest producer and supplier of software for the Macintosh. The prevalence of Macintosh systems—1.25 million Macintoshes had been sold by the end of 1987—convinced Microsoft that strength lay in graphical user interfaces; the firm had in fact been developing a program to convert MS-DOS computers to graphical user interfaces for several years. The challenge was made more difficult because each program designed for MS-DOS used unique commands—no one had imposed uniformity on MS-DOS the way Apple had on Macintosh developers.\n\nThe interface had to have a top layer of graphics, bring uniformity to all potentially running applications, and straighten out problems caused by various printers and monitors. Gates also wanted Macintosh-style pull-down menus and the ability to display several documents simultaneously. The conversion was a formidable project, and other companies, including IBM, were working on interface managers for DOS. In one of the earliest multi-company alliances within the computer industry, Gates met with the manufacturers of IBM-compatibles who did not want IBM to continue monopolizing the development of PC standards. He convinced many of them that the development of Microsoft’s interface, called Windows, would free them from IBM’s control of the PC environment. Compac, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Digital Equipment Corporation, and others announced their support for Windows. Microsoft also rounded up support from fellow software publishers, including rival Lotus.\n\nAs a result of this mass collusion, IBM decided to support VisiCorp’s graphic interface, known as VisiOn, which had already been released. IBM further distanced itself from Microsoft by marketing a UNIX language from another software publisher. Windows kept falling more and more behind schedule, but VisiOn also ran into trouble, as did IBM’s own program, TopView.\n\nAlready nearly a year behind, Microsoft rescheduled the release of Windows from October of 1984 to June of 1985. The delay forced other publishers to delay their Windows applications, and hurt the company’s image. Tensions built within Microsoft over the delays. Over 30 programmers, testers, and documentation writers worked frantically on Windows, some of them virtually living in the office. The first version of Windows finally hit the market in November of 1985, having taken about 110,000 programming hours to write. Sales were disappointing, however. Windows took up five floppy disks, which made the system quite slow; furthermore, very few programs could run on Windows. Potential buyers were also waiting to see if IBM’s TopView would be a better product.\n\nTo entice consumers, Microsoft opted to develop software for the interface. In addition, Microsoft convinced IBM to have Microsoft adapt Windows to the next IBM operating system, OS/2, which Microsoft was helping write.\n\nDuring 1985 the flourishing Microsoft decided to build a campus in Redmond, Washington, complete with a tree-filled park in hopes that the relaxed setting would be conducive to the exacting task of writing software codes than a traditional office complex. Microsoft began transferring operations to Redmond the next year.\n\nFollowing the genesis of Windows and Excel for the Macintosh, Gates decided to take Microsoft public. In early 1986 Microsoft was owned almost entirely by its employees, with Gates and Allen (who had founded another software company, Asymetrix) owning controlling majorities. The initial offering was about 12 percent of the company, in the form of about 2.5 million shares. The stock rose from $25.75 when introduced in March of 1986 to $84.75 in March of 1987, making Gates a billionaire at age 31.\n\nMicrosoft’s primary competitor, Lotus, had introduced 1-2-3 to Japan in late 1986; 1-2-3 rapidly eroded sales of Microsoft’s Multiplan, Excel’s predecessor. Microsoft retaliated by choosing Excel—originally earmarked for the IBM market as a challenge to Lotus 1-2-3 and already tremendously successful for Macintosh—to be the primary Windows product. Excel was introduced for $495, the same price as 1-2-3. To lure Lotus users, Microsoft not only made Excel capable of reading and writing 1-2-3 files, but also gave Excel the ability to write files for the new generation of more powerful computers using the 80286 and 80386 microprocessors. Microsoft hoped this transition to more powerful computers would help Excel crack the 1-2-3 market. Microsoft was right. The PC version of Excel received glowing reviews. Some big computer stores used Excel to help push higher-end hardware. By the first quarter of 1986, the rival companies were in a virtual tie, with Lotus earning $65.6 million in sales and Microsoft garnering $66.8 million.\n\nWindows 2.0 was released at about the same time as Excel, in November of 1987. Twice as fast as its predecessor, version 2.0 had an interface similar to the Macintosh interface. The PC version of Excel was designed to exploit Windows’s strengths, which gave Windows additional credibility and further appealed to Macintosh users. By December, Windows had sold 1 million copies, and software companies that had previously developed products only for the Macintosh began working on Windows software. Worried that Windows’s unique graphic interface was losing exclusiveness, Apple sued Microsoft for copyright infringement in March of 1988, alleging that Microsoft had copied “the look and feel” of the Macintosh. Apple also claimed that Microsoft had violated a 1985 licensing agreement between the two companies. Apple asked for Microsoft to either pay royalties or take Windows off the market.\n\nThe suit was gradually whittled down by the court, which over the course of a year removed all but 10 of the 189 items that Apple claimed were copyright violations. The court also agreed to Microsoft’s request to consider the case on a function-by-function basis, as opposed to an overall analysis of look and feel.\n\nIn the meantime, Microsoft was gradually wearing down some Lotus 1-2-3 loyalists with advertising campaigns, including one that offered 1-2-3 users Excel for $75 if they sent in their old Lotus disks. Lotus contributed to the loss of its own base by repeatedly delaying the release of 1-2-3 version 3. However, when version 3 was finally released in June of 1989, some critics judged the software better than Excel. Excel had found a niche in the IBM market, but was not as popular as 1-2-3.\n\nEven so, Microsoft’s sales reached $803.5 million for 1989, and the corporation maintained approximately 4,000 employees. Surging PC sales throughout the world were contributing to the firm’s growth, since Microsoft was making money on every operating system of all IBM-compatible computers purchased. Microsoft also had a large share of the European software market, including nearly one-third of the French market. Windows was an important factor— having sold 2 million copies by early 1989—especially because other developers had climbed on the bandwagon and released software designed to work with Windows.\n\nMicrosoft had become a huge player in the computer world, but success bred enemies. Relations between IBM and Microsoft reached the breaking point over Microsoft’s support for the Windows/DOS combination rather than the new version of OS/2 operating system favored by IBM. Microsoft poured time and money into Windows 3.0, and spent about $10 million on initial promotions. One of the selling points of OS/2 was the ability to run several applications at once; Windows 3.0 also stressed this capability, and IBM was not pleased that many users, including businesses, seemed to prefer Windows to OS/2. Apple was also displeased over this new graphic interface, and in April of 1991 broadened the pending lawsuit to include Windows 3.0.\n\nBy that point Windows 3.0 had sold more than 1 million copies, despite complaints that the system required advanced hardware to run at an acceptable speed, and contentions that Apple’s System 7 was a superior graphic interface. By late 1990 the relationship between IBM and Microsoft had greatly deteriorated, with IBM taking most of the responsibility for development of the second version of OS/2. IBM wanted Microsoft to focus on OS/2; Microsoft refused. Microsoft had initially been enthusiastic about OS/2 as a way to replace the aging DOS system, which was now on version 4. But Windows 3.0 was selling extremely well, while sales of OS/2 were lagging. The two former collaborators engaged in a price war that had Microsoft selling DOS 5.0 at deep discounts and IBM halving the price of OS/2.\n\nFinally, in a move that took the computer industry by surprise, arch-rivals IBM and Apple, whose lawsuit against Microsoft was still unsettled, announced an alliance to create a new operating system that would make computers easier to use and allow their two systems to swap information. The alliance, announced in July of 1991, was widely seen as an attempt to outflank Microsoft, whose emerging control of software and operating system standards threatened both manufacturers.\n\nMicrosoft also attempted to get into the rapidly growing desktop-publishing market by producing the software that controls laser printers, but could not crack Adobe Systems hold on the market and was forced to withdraw. Microsoft did release a layout program called Microsoft Publisher in February of 1992, though the offering encountered tough competition against established programs like Aldus PageMaker and QuarkXpress.\n\nGates pushed Microsoft to work on pen-based computers, expected by some analysts to account for a significant percentage of the computer market by the mid-1990s. Microsoft was one of the first firms to explore compact disc, read only memory (CD-ROM) technology as well. The corporation had burgeoned into network software—which allows many computers to be linked together simultaneously and has been utilized chiefly in business offices—by embarking on a venture with Ashton-Tate to market data-base file servers in 1988. Challengers in that area included Novell Inc. and Lotus. Microsoft had a hand in so many pieces of the PC pie, that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began investigating possible anti-competitive practices by the company.\n\nIn addition to completing a merger with Fox Software on June 29, 1992, Microsoft saw its management undergo several changes in the 1990s. Jon Shirley resigned after six years as president in 1990. He was replaced by Michael Hallman, who formerly headed Boeing’s computer division. However, Gates forced Hallman out after one year, and split his office between Michael Maples, Steven A. Ballmer, and Francis J. Gaudette.\n\nMicrosoft was not only the largest software firm in the early 1990s, but also the most diversified. As the computer world continued evolving rapidly, Microsoft was well positioned to maintain status as foremost software manufacturer due to constant shifts into important emerging areas like multi-media. However, the alliances against the firm were potentially daunting, particularly the Apple-IBM venture, which was geared towards developing a new operating system to challenge DOS.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nMicrosoft Press; Microsoft Europe; Microsoft de Argentina S.A.; Microsoft Pty.

The company’s core business is based on developing, manufacturing, and licensing software products, including operating systems, server applications, business and consumer applications, and software development tools, as well as Internet software, technologies, and services. Led by Bill Gates, the world’s wealthiest individual and most famous businessman, Microsoft has succeeded in placing at least one of its products on virtually every personal computer in the world, setting industry standards and defining markets in the process. The company is known as a ferocious competitor whose tactics have engendered the scrutiny of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. It has been vilified by the press, its competitors, and many computer-savvy users who view its dominant position in the industry as a stranglehold that forestalls competition, stifles innovation, and leads to inferior products; at the same time, millions of users testify to the success of the company’s products, and respondents to survey after survey name Microsoft the most admired company in the United States.\n\nOrigins of an Empire\n\nBill Gates was born in Seattle in 1955, the second of three children in a well-to-do family. His father, William H. Gates II, was a lawyer, while his mother, Mary Gates, was a teacher, a regent of the University of Washington, and member of several corporate boards. Gates was first exposed to computers at school in the late 1960s with his friend Paul Allen, the son of two Seattle librarians. By the time Gates was 14, the two friends were writing and testing computer programs for fun and profit.\n\nIn 1972 they established their first company, Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer that recorded and analyzed traffic data. Allen went on to study computer science at the University of Washington and then dropped out to work at Honeywell, while Gates enrolled at Harvard. Inspired in 1975 by an issue of Popular Electronics that showed the new Altair microcomputer kit just released by MITS Computer, Gates and Allen wrote a version of BASIC for the machine. Later that year Gates left college to work full time developing programming languages for the Altair, and he and Allen relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to be near MITS Computer, where Allen took a position as Director of Software Development. Gates and Allen named their partnership Micro-soft. Their revenues for 1975 totaled $16,000.\n\nA year later, Gates published “An Open Letter to Hobbyists” in the Altair newsletter, in which he enjoined users to avoid illegally copied software. Arguing that software piracy prevented “good software from being written,” Gates wrote prophetically, “Nothing would please me more than being able to hire ten programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software.” In November 1976 Allen left MITS to devote his full attention to Microsoft, and the company’s tradename was registered. In 1977 Apple and Radio Shack licensed Microsoft BASIC for their Apple II and Tandy computers, with the Apple license going for a flat fee of $21,000. As Apple sold a million machines complete with BASIC, Microsoft’s unit revenues dropped to two cents a copy.\n\nThat same year Microsoft released its second programming language, Microsoft FORTRAN, which was followed in 1978 by a version of COBOL. Both were written for the CP/M operating system, one of many available in the rapidly expanding but still unstandardized microcomputer market, and as CP/M was adopted by computer manufacturers including Sirius, Zenith, and Sharp, Microsoft became the leading distributor for microcomputer languages. By the end of 1978 Microsoft had 13 employees, a sales subsidiary in Japan, and $1 million in revenues. The following year Gates and Allen moved the company to Bellevue, Washington.\n\nThe Early 1980s: Associations with IBM and Apple\n\nMicrosoft’s big break came in 1980 as IBM began developing its Personal Computer, or PC. While IBM contracted Microsoft to develop languages for the PC, IBM’s first choice to provide an operating system was the leader in the field, Digital Research; however, IBM and Digital Research were unable to agree on terms, so the contract for the operating system was awarded to Microsoft. As Microsoft was under a tight deadline and did not have an operating system of its own, the company purchased the rights to one from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000. Originally dubbed Q-DOS (for “Quick and Dirty Operating System”), the product was renamed MS-DOS (for “Microsoft Disk Operating System”) and modified for IBM’s purposes. Under the terms of the agreement, Microsoft retained the right to sell the operating system to other companies and to consumers, while IBM could not. Neither company could have foreseen the value of this arrangement: as other manufacturers developed hardware compatible with the IBM PC, and as personal computing became a multibillion dollar business, the fast and powerful MS-DOS became the industry’s leading operating system, and Microsoft’s revenues skyrocketed.\n\n1980 also saw the arrival of Steve Ballmer, a close friend of Gates’s from Harvard, who was hired to organize the nontechnical side of the business. Ballmer later recalled the company’s stormy beginnings under Gates’s leadership: “Our first major row came when I insisted it was time to hire 17 people. He claimed I was trying to bankrupt him.” Conservative in his spending, Gates dictated that the company must always have enough money in the bank to operate for a year with no revenues. Nearly 20 years later that policy still stood—in 1999 Microsoft had cash reserves of more than $13 billion and no long-term debt—while Ballmer, who had by then become Microsoft president, remained Gates’s closest friend and advisor.\n\nIn 1981 the company was incorporated as Microsoft, Inc., with Gates as president and chairman and Allen as executive vice-president. The company closed the year with 128 employees and revenues of $16 million. Two years later Allen left Microsoft after being diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease. He remained on the board of directors and continued to hold more than ten percent of the company’s stock. Also in 1983 Microsoft launched a word processing program, Word 1.0, in an effort to supplant the category leader, WordStar. Simpler to use and less expensive than WordStar, Word used a mouse to move the cursor and was able to display bold and italic type on the screen. Nevertheless, some users felt that the product was too complex—designed for software engineers rather than business users—and it was quickly surpassed in the market by WordPerfect, released by the WordPefect Corporation. Word did not become a success until its greatly improved version 3.0 was released in 1986, whereupon the application became Microsoft’s best-selling product.\n\nThroughout its history, Microsoft has been known for releasing products that were initially unsuccessful but eventually grew to dominate their categories. Many reviewers have been harsh in their criticism: David Kirkpatrick, writing in Fortune, described the first release of one product as a “typically unreliable, bug-ridden Microsoft mess,” while Brent Schlender noted in the same magazine that “from its beginnings, Microsoft has been notorious for producing inelegant products that are frequently inferior and bringing them to the market way behind schedule.” These critics note that the success of Microsoft has been based not only—or even principally—on the company’s technological prowess, but also on Bill Gates’s business acumen, which combined dogged perseverance, strategic marketing, powerful alliances, and, increasingly as the years went on, highly aggressive competitive tactics.\n\nMicrosoft worked closely with Apple during the development of Apple’s Macintosh computer, which was introduced in 1984. Revolutionary in its design, the Mac featured a graphical user interface based on icons rather than the typed commands used by the IBM PC, making its programs simple to use and easy to learn, even by computer novices. Microsoft introduced Mac versions of BASIC, Word, and the spreadsheet program Multiplan, and quickly became the leading supplier of applications for the Mac. Revenues jumped from $50 million in 1983 to nearly $100 million in 1984.\n\nCompany Perspectives:\n\nAt Microsoft we believe people shape the face of computing today and tomorrow. The critical forces in the personal computing and digital technology revolutions are the developers who define the technologies and the customers who use these technologies every day. Microsoft’s commitment to making innovative software products, combined with a sincere appreciation for customer feedback, is the key to our customers’ satisfaction and the company’s long-term success. Microsoft’s long-term vision of the personal computer as a tool to empower people and organizations to great things drives its development efforts as the next era of personal computing and communications technology approaches.\n\nConvinced that the Mac’s graphical user interface represented the future of end-user applications, Gates sought to develop an interface manager to work on top of MS-DOS that would convert the operating system to a graphical model that would be user-friendly and provide a single method for interacting with the many non-standardized programs designed to run on the system. Because other companies, including IBM, were working to develop similar interface managers for MS-DOS, Gates solicited support from hardware manufacturers and software publishers who were concerned about IBM’s continued dominance of the PC market. Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Digital Equipment Corporation, and others announced their support for the project, called Microsoft Windows, while IBM, in the face of this opposition, threw its weight behind VisiOn, a similar product already being marketed by VisiCalc, while working to develop its own program, called TopView. Plagued by delays in development, the release of Windows was repeatedly rescheduled throughout 1984 and 1985, causing tensions at Microsoft and with other software publishers who were forced to delay releases of the applications they were designing for the system. Finally released in November 1985, after some 110,000 hours of frantic work by programmers, Windows faced a disappointing reception. The system was slow, few applications were available to run on it, and customers delayed purchase decisions while waiting for the introduction of TopView.\n\nIn 1985 Microsoft also introduced Excel 1.0, a Mac spreadsheet product. Based on the earlier and less successful Multiplan, Excel gradually took hold against its principal competitor, Lotus 1-2-3, and eventually came to account for more than $1 billion of Microsoft’s annual revenues. That same year Microsoft began collaborating with IBM on a next-generation operating system, called OS/2.\n\nThe Late 1980s: A Corporate Culture Emerges\n\nIn early 1986 Microsoft moved to a new 40-acre corporate campus in Redmond, Washington, near Seattle. Designed to provide a refuge free of distractions for those whose job was, in Gates’s words, to “sit and think,” the campus was nestled in a quiet woodland setting and reflected huge expenditures for tools, space, and comfort. Buildings were designed in the shape of an X to maximize light, with each programmer given a private office rather than a cubicle. The buildings featured many small, subsidized cafeterias, as well as refrigerators stocked with juice and caffeinated beverages. The self-contained, collegiate surroundings were carefully designed to promote the company’s distinctive culture, which one commentator described as a close approximation of “math camp.” Like most software companies, Microsoft had no dress code (although company lore recounts that in 1988 senior management did express a preference that employees not go barefoot indoors). Employees were hired on the basis of sheer intelligence, with the company selecting only a small fraction of applicants from the more than 100,000 resumes it received each year, and were expected to work brutal schedules to bring products to market as quickly as possible. Microsoft paid salaries that were distinctly lower than elsewhere in the industry, even to their senior executives, but compensated with generous stock options that have made thousands of Microsoft employees millionaires. At the same time, the company tried to maintain a small company mentality, in which executives traveled coach class, the necessity of additional staff positions was closely scrutinized, and other unnecessary expenditures were vigilantly avoided.\n\nIn March 1986 Microsoft went public with an initial public offering (IPO) of 2.5 million shares that raised $61 million. Within a year the stock had risen from $25 to $85, making Bill Gates a billionaire at the age of 31. The following year Microsoft released its first CD-ROM product, Microsoft Bookshelf, a collection often reference works, as well as Excel for Windows, its first application for the new operating system. Microsoft also purchased Forethought, Inc., for $12 million, thereby acquiring that company’s PowerPoint presentation graphics program, and released OS/2 in collaboration with IBM. In November 1987 Microsoft introduced Windows 2.0, a greatly improved version of the operating system, and by the end of the year Windows had sold more than one million copies. As Windows began to take hold, more software companies were convinced to develop applications for the operating system, which brought it increased usefulness and further sales momentum. In 1988 Microsoft surpassed Lotus Development Corporation as the leading software vendor, with more than $500 million in sales. The company was accused of copyright infringement by Apple, which alleged that Microsoft had copied the “look and feel” of the Macintosh, in a lawsuit that was finally dismissed after five years of litigation. In 1989 the company introduced Microsoft Office, a “suite” of programs that eventually came to dominate the market and become Microsoft’s best-selling application product. While the initial release of Office was a discount package, later versions incorporated standard, shared features and included Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and the e-mail program Mail, with the Access database management program included in the Office Professional version.\n\nBefore 1990 Microsoft was primarily a supplier to hardware manufacturers, but after 1990 the bulk of the company’s revenues came from sales to consumers. That year Microsoft became the first software company to reach $1 billion in revenues, closing the year with 5,600 employees.\n\nProduct Development in the 1990s\n\nIn 1993 Microsoft introduced Encarta, the first multimedia encyclopedia on CD-ROM, as well as the first version of Windows NT, an operating system for users on corporate networks. While the initial acceptance of Windows NT was disappointing, an upgrade shipped in September of the following year as NT 3.5 was a dramatic success: winning the PC Magazine award for technical excellence in system software and named the best operating system product of 1994, the upgrade boosted sales of NT to more than one million copies by the end of the year. Microsoft announced an agreement to purchase Intuit, the producer of the leading package of personal financial software, called Quicken; however, after the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to prevent the takeover on the basis of antitrust concerns, Microsoft withdrew its offer. Revenues for 1994 exceeded $4 billion.\n\nIn August 1995 Microsoft launched its next version of Windows, called Windows 95, which sold more than one million copies in the first four days after its release. For the rest of the decade Microsoft expanded aggressively into new businesses associated with its core franchise. Its projects included two joint ventures with the National Broadcasting Company under the name MSNBC: an interactive online news service and a cable channel broadcasting news and information 24 hours a day. The company’s Web-based services included the Microsoft Network online service, a travel agency, local events listings, car buying information, a personal financial management site, and a joint venture with First Data that allows consumers to pay their bills online. Microsoft purchased 11 percent of the cable television company Comcast for $1 billion and cut a licensing deal with the largest U.S. cable operator, TCI Communications, to put Windows into at least five million set-top boxes. The company also purchased WebTV, whose core technology allows users to surf the Internet without a PC. Microsoft’s latest generation of Windows, Windows CE, was designed to expand the franchise into computer-like devices including mobile phones, point-of-sale terminals, pocket organizers, digital televisions, digital cameras, hand-held computers, automobile multimedia systems, and pagers. By early 1999 the company had secured more than 100 licensing agreements with manufacturers of these “intelligent appliances.”\n\nLegal Challenges and Competition in the Future\n\nMicrosoft’s many critics believed that the company’s goal in this widespread expansion was to control every delivery channel of information, thereby providing the means to control the content. According to Scott McNealy of rival company Sun Microsystems, “By owning the entry points to the Internet and electronic marketplace, Microsoft has the power to exercise predatory and exclusionary control over the very means for people to access the Internet and all it represents.”\n\nThe U.S. government apparently agreed. After an intensive investigation of Microsoft’s competitive practices that had gone on for much of the decade, in 1998 the U.S. Department of Justice and a group of 20 state Attorney Generals filed two antitrust cases against Microsoft alleging violations of the Sherman Act. The government sought to prove a broad pattern of anticompetitive behavior on Microsoft’s part by demonstrating an array of claims, including the following: that Microsoft had a monopoly on the market for operating systems; that the company used that monopoly as a means of preventing other companies from selling its competitors’ products (most notably Netscape’s Internet browser); that it was illegal for Microsoft to bundle its own browser into the operating system Windows 98 as a means of precluding customers from purchasing Netscape’s product; that the company sought to divide markets with competitors; that Microsoft sought to subvert the Java programming language, developed by Sun Microsystems, which it viewed as a threat to Windows; and, finally, that Microsoft’s business practices were detrimental to consumers. The case was conducted under a flurry of media attention, with all parties agreeing that the stakes were extremely high: should Microsoft win, its brand of extremely aggressive capitalism would secure a legal blessing; should the company lose, the company could be forced to license the source code for Windows to competitors, thus destroying its monopoly, or could be broken up into smaller components, crippling its hold over the marketplace. A decision was expected in the summer of 1999.\n\nThe fear and resentment that Microsoft and its founder Gates have engendered are testament to the company’s mythic status and Gates’s role as the embodiment of the digital era. Gates’s extreme wealth (in early 1999 he was worth $50 billion) makes him the subject of constant scrutiny, while the Internet is rife with Bill Gates “hate pages,” named, for example, “The Society for the Prevention of Bill Gates Getting Everything.” Resentment and legal action notwithstanding, with more than $14 billion in sales in 1998 and $3 billion planned for R&D expenditures in 1999, Microsoft shows no signs of slowing down. The company remains a force whose products have come to seem indispensable to millions of users worldwide, and David Kirk-patrick’s 1998 Fortune article, “Microsoft: Is Your Company Its Next Meal?” is just the smallest indicator that competitors still have no room to relax.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nMicrosoft FSC Corp.; Microsoft Investments, Inc.; Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (Ireland); Microsoft Licensing, Inc.; Microsoft Puerto Rico, Inc.; The Microsoft Network L.L.C.; GraceMac Corporation; Microsoft de Argentina S.A.; Microsoft Pty.

The company's core business is based on developing, manufacturing, and licensing software products, including operating systems, server applications, business and consumer applications, and software development tools, as well as Internet software, technologies, and services. Led by Bill Gates, the world's wealthiest individual and most famous businessman, Microsoft has succeeded in placing at least one of its products on virtually every personal computer in the world, setting industry standards and defining markets in the process.\n\nOrigins of an Empire\n\nBill Gates was born in Seattle in 1955, the second of three children in a well-to-do family. His father, William H. Gates II, was a lawyer, while his mother, Mary Gates, was a teacher, a regent of the University of Washington, and member of several corporate boards. Gates was first exposed to computers at school in the late 1960s with his friend Paul Allen, the son of two Seattle librarians. By the time Gates was 14, the two friends were writing and testing computer programs for fun and profit.\n\nIn 1972 they established their first company, Traf-O-Data, which sold a rudimentary computer that recorded and analyzed traffic data. Allen went on to study computer science at the University of Washington and then dropped out to work at Honeywell, while Gates enrolled at Harvard. Inspired in 1975 by an issue of Popular Electronics that showed the new Altair microcomputer kit just released by MITS Computer, Gates and Allen wrote a version of BASIC for the machine. Later that year Gates left college to work full time developing programming languages for the Altair, and he and Allen relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to be near MITS Computer, where Allen took a position as director of software development. Gates and Allen named their partnership Micro-soft. Their revenues for 1975 totaled $16,000.\n\nA year later, Gates published \"An Open Letter to Hobbyists\" in the Altair newsletter, in which he enjoined users to avoid illegally copied software. Arguing that software piracy prevented \"good software from being written,\" Gates wrote prophetically, \"Nothing would please me more than being able to hire ten programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software.\" In November 1976 Allen left MITS to devote his full attention to Microsoft, and the company's tradename was registered. In 1977 Apple and Radio Shack licensed Microsoft BASIC for their Apple II and Tandy computers, with the Apple license going for a flat fee of $21,000. As Apple sold a million machines complete with BASIC, Microsoft's unit revenues dropped to two cents a copy.\n\nThat same year Microsoft released its second programming language, Microsoft FORTRAN, which was followed in 1978 by a version of COBOL. Both were written for the CP/M operating system, one of many available in the rapidly expanding but still unstandardized microcomputer market. As CP/M was adopted by computer manufacturers including Sirius, Zenith, and Sharp, Microsoft became the leading distributor for microcomputer languages. By the end of 1978 Microsoft had 13 employees, a sales subsidiary in Japan, and $1 million in revenues. The following year Gates and Allen moved the company to Bellevue, Washington.\n\nThe Early 1980s: Associations with IBM and Apple\n\nMicrosoft's big break came in 1980 as IBM began developing its Personal Computer, or PC. While IBM contracted Microsoft to develop languages for the PC, IBM's first choice to provide an operating system was the leader in the field, Digital Research; however, IBM and Digital Research were unable to agree on terms, so the contract for the operating system was awarded to Microsoft. As Microsoft was under a tight deadline and did not have an operating system of its own, the company purchased the rights to one from Seattle Computer Products for $75,000. Originally dubbed Q-DOS (for \"Quick and Dirty Operating System\"), the product was renamed MS-DOS (for \"Microsoft Disk Operating System\") and modified for IBM's purposes. Under the terms of the agreement, Microsoft retained the right to sell the operating system to other companies and to consumers, while IBM could not. Neither company could have foreseen the value of this arrangement: as other manufacturers developed hardware compatible with the IBM PC, and as personal computing became a multibillion-dollar business, the fast and powerful MS-DOS became the industry's leading operating system, and Microsoft's revenues skyrocketed.\n\nThe year 1980 also saw the arrival of Steve Ballmer, a close friend of Gates from Harvard, who was hired to organize the non-technical side of the business. Ballmer later recalled the company's stormy beginnings under Gates's leadership: \"Our first major row came when I insisted it was time to hire 17 people. He claimed I was trying to bankrupt him.\" Conservative in his spending, Gates dictated that the company must always have enough money in the bank to operate for a year with no revenues. Nearly 20 years later that policy still stood—in 1999 Microsoft had cash reserves of more than $13 billion and no long-term debt—while Ballmer, who had by then become Microsoft president, remained Gates's closest friend and adviser.\n\nIn 1981 the company was incorporated as Microsoft, Inc., with Gates as president and chairman and Allen as executive vice-president. The company closed the year with 128 employees and revenues of $16 million. Two years later Allen left Microsoft after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. He remained on the board of directors and continued to hold more than 10 percent of the company's stock. Also in 1983 Microsoft launched a word processing program, Word 1.0, in an effort to supplant the category leader, WordStar. Simpler to use and less expensive than WordStar, Word used a mouse to move the cursor and was able to display bold and italic type on the screen. Nevertheless, some users felt that the product was too complex—designed for software engineers rather than business users—and it was quickly surpassed in the market by WordPerfect, released by the Word-Perfect Corporation. Word did not become a success until its greatly improved version 3.0 was released in 1986, whereupon the application became Microsoft's best-selling product.\n\nThroughout its history, Microsoft has been known for releasing products that were initially unsuccessful but eventually grew to dominate their categories.

Revenues jumped from $50 million in 1983 to nearly $100 million in 1984.\n\nConvinced that the Mac's graphical user interface represented the future of end-user applications, Gates sought to develop an interface manager to work on top of MS-DOS that would convert the operating system to a graphical model that would be user-friendly and provide a single method for interacting with the many non-standardized programs designed to run on the system. Because other companies, including IBM, were working to develop similar interface managers for MS-DOS, Gates solicited support from hardware manufacturers and software publishers who were concerned about IBM's continued dominance of the PC market. Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Digital Equipment Corporation, and others announced their support for the project, called Microsoft Windows, while IBM, in the face of this opposition, threw its weight behind VisiOn, a similar product already being marketed by VisiCalc, while working to develop its own program, called TopView.

Finally released in November 1985, after some 110,000 hours of frantic work by programmers, Windows faced a disappointing reception. The system was slow, few applications were available to run on it, and customers delayed purchase decisions while waiting for the introduction of TopView.\n\nCompany Perspectives:\n\nTo enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential.\n\nIn 1985 Microsoft also introduced Excel 1.0, a Mac spreadsheet product. Based on the earlier and less successful Multiplan, Excel gradually took hold against its principal competitor, Lotus 1-2-3, and eventually came to account for more than $1 billion of Microsoft's annual revenues. That same year Microsoft began collaborating with IBM on a next-generation operating system, called OS/2.\n\nThe Late 1980s: Emergence of a Corporate Culture\n\nIn early 1986 Microsoft moved to a new 40-acre corporate campus in Redmond, Washington, near Seattle.

Hallman is promoted in Shirley's place; the company becomes the first PC software firm to surpass $1 billion of sales in a single year.\n\n1992:\n\nBill Gates is awarded the National Medal of Technology for Technological Achievement.\n\n1993:\n\nThe company introduces Windows NT.\n\n1995:\n\nBill Gates publishes his first book, The Road Ahead.\n\n1996:\n\nThe company acquires Vermeer Technologies and its software application, FrontPage.\n\n1997:\n\nThe Justice Department alleges that Microsoft violated a 1994 consent decree concerning licensing the Windows operating system to computer manufacturers.\n\n1998:\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice files two antitrust cases against Microsoft, alleging the company had violated the Sherman Act.\n\n2000:\n\nThe company acquires Visio Corporation, its largest acquisition to date.\n\n2001:\n\nMicrosoft Windows XP is released internationally.\n\n2003:\n\nMicrosoft launches Windows Server 2003.\n\nProduct Development in the 1990s\n\nIn 1993 Microsoft introduced Encarta, the first multimedia encyclopedia on CD-ROM, as well as the first version of Windows NT, an operating system for users on corporate networks. While the initial acceptance of Windows NT was disappointing, an upgrade shipped in September of the following year as NT 3.5 was a dramatic success: winning the PC Magazine award for technical excellence in system software and named the best operating system product of 1994, the upgrade boosted sales of NT to more than one million copies by the end of the year. Microsoft announced an agreement to purchase Intuit, the producer of the leading package of personal financial software, called Quicken; however, after the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to prevent the takeover on the basis of antitrust concerns, Microsoft withdrew its offer. Revenues for 1994 exceeded $4 billion.\n\nIn August 1995 Microsoft launched its next version of Windows, called Windows 95, which sold more than one million copies in the first four days after its release. For the rest of the decade Microsoft expanded aggressively into new businesses associated with its core franchise. Its projects included two joint ventures with the National Broadcasting Company under the name MSNBC: an interactive online news service and a cable channel broadcasting news and information 24 hours a day. The company's web-based services included the Microsoft Network online service, a travel agency, local events listings, car buying information, a personal financial management site, and a joint venture with First Data that allowed consumers to pay their bills online. Microsoft purchased 11 percent of the cable television company Comcast for $1 billion and cut a licensing deal with the largest U.S. cable operator, TCI Communications, to put Windows into at least five million set-top boxes. The company also purchased WebTV, whose core technology allowed users to surf the Internet without a PC. Microsoft's latest generation of Windows, Windows CE, was designed to expand the franchise into computer-like devices including mobile phones, point-of-sale terminals, pocket organizers, digital televisions, digital cameras, handheld computers, automobile multimedia systems, and pagers. By early 1999 the company had secured more than 100 licensing agreements with manufacturers of these \"intelligent appliances.\"\n\nLegal Challenges and Competition in the Future\n\nMicrosoft's many critics believed that the company's goal in this widespread expansion was to control every delivery channel of information, thereby providing the means to control the content. According to Scott McNealy of rival company Sun Microsystems, \"By owning the entry points to the Internet and electronic marketplace, Microsoft has the power to exercise predatory and exclusionary control over the very means for people to access the Internet and all it represents.\"\n\nThe U.S. government apparently agreed. After an intensive investigation of Microsoft's competitive practices that had gone on for much of the decade, in 1998 the U.S. Department of Justice and a group of 20 state attorneys general filed two antitrust cases against Microsoft alleging violations of the Sherman Act. The government sought to prove a broad pattern of anticompetitive behavior on Microsoft's part by demonstrating an array of claims, including the following: that Microsoft had a monopoly on the market for operating systems; that the company used that monopoly as a means of preventing other companies from selling its competitors' products (most notably Netscape's Internet browser); that it was illegal for Microsoft to bundle its own browser into the operating system Windows 98 as a means of precluding customers from purchasing Netscape's product; that the company sought to divide markets with competitors; that Microsoft sought to subvert the Java programming language, developed by Sun Microsystems, which it viewed as a threat to Windows; and, finally, that Microsoft's business practices were detrimental to consumers. The case was conducted under a flurry of media attention, with all parties agreeing that the stakes were extremely high: should Microsoft win, its brand of extremely aggressive capitalism would secure a legal blessing; should the company lose, the company could be forced to license the source code for Windows to competitors, thus destroying its monopoly, or could be broken up into smaller components, crippling its hold over the marketplace.\n\nThe fear and resentment that Microsoft and its founder Gates engendered were testament to the company's mythic status and Gates's role as the embodiment of the digital era. Gates's extreme wealth (in early 1999 he was worth $50 billion) made him the subject of constant scrutiny, while the Internet was rife with Bill Gates \"hate pages,\" named, for example, \"The Society for the Prevention of Bill Gates Getting Everything.\" Resentment and legal action notwithstanding, with more than $14 billion in sales in 1998, Microsoft showed no signs of slowing down.\n\nMicrosoft continued to grow rapidly, increasing its net revenue by 29 percent, to $19.7 billion, in 1999. Additionally, net income rose to $7.79 billion, a dramatic 73 percent increase over 1998. While the antitrust suit against Microsoft showed threats of a forced breakup of Microsoft, innovations in the company continued. Encarta Africana, the first complete encyclopedia of black history and culture, was launched, as well as Shop, Microsoft's first online store.\n\nUnprecedented Growth in 2000 and Beyond\n\nIn 2000 Microsoft acquired Visio Corporation, the top supplier of business diagramming and technical drawing software. The transaction, at approximately $1.3 billion, became the largest acquisition in Microsoft history. Also in 2000, Microsoft invested $135 million in the software publisher Corel. Apparently, Corel negotiated the investment, offering to drop \"certain legal actions\" it had against the company, even as it had no legal claims filed against Microsoft. Another transaction—in Microsoft's desire to expand into the television market—involved a $56 million investment in Intertainer Inc, a provider of video-on-demand service. In the same year, Microsoft increased its employee base by nearly 9,000, from 39,170 to 48,030. The total expenditures took a temporary toll on Microsoft's net income, which dropped 22 percent, to $7.35 billion, in 2001. At the same time, net revenue continued to increase, up 10 percent from 2000.\n\nThe release of Windows 2000, while causing a stir, was overshadowed by the highly anticipated debut and worldwide release of Microsoft Windows XP. So confident was Microsoft in the product, and in its ability to boost worldwide sales of computers (which had declined 11.3 percent since the September 11 attacks just a month before), they launched a $250 million ad campaign for the product. The software did not represent a brand new development, as much of the technology came from that of its predecessor, Windows 2000. But as Paul Thurrott, writer for Network Windows magazine, wrote, \"There's no doubt that we'll eventually look back on Windows XP as one of the key OS releases of all time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice ruled that they would not enforce a breakup of Microsoft. By the end of 2002, the U.S. District Court approved the settlement Microsoft reached with the Justice Department. The settlement included preventing Microsoft from benefiting from exclusive deals that could hinder competition; uniform contract terms for computer manufacturers; the required ability of customers to remove icons from certain Microsoft features; and a requirement that Microsoft release specific innovational technical information to its rivals, in order to enforce competition.\n\nMicrosoft's net revenue increased to $28.37 billion in 2002, while net income rebounded, gaining 6 percent from the previous year. In 2003, Microsoft saw an impressive 28 percent jump in net income, to reach just below $10 billion. The launching of Windows Server 2003, the largest software development project in the company's history to date, contributed to the growth. According to Microsoft, Windows Server 2003 would be a more reliable, more manageable, and more collaborative piece of software. Security would also be tighter, especially due to a newly built IIS (Internet Information Server) Web Server.\n\nBy 2004, with more than 56,000 employees and anticipated year-end revenues of up to $38 billion, Microsoft continued to hold a strong lead in the computer software industry. With an emphasis on continuous innovation—including such business products as the BizTalk Server 2004—further success seemed ensured. Still, resentment toward Microsoft was omnipresent. In April 2004, the company was fined by the European Union for abusing its monopoly on computer operating systems. The fine, at EUR 497 million ($596 million), was not likely to be the last for Microsoft.\n\nPrincipal Subsidiaries\n\nMicrosoft Asia, Ltd.

If the company were like a toy giant, it could accurately call itself \"Computers 'R Us.\" On any given day that a person anywhere in the world uses a computer, chances are almost 100 percent that a Microsoft product was employed. With such pervasiveness, profits have not only been staggeringly high but so has antagonism toward the company-much of that directed toward Bill Gates whose personal wealth stems from owning a 12 percent share of Microsoft. One measure of Microsoft's size is that the Apple Computer television ad campaign hopes to win defectors from the 95 percent of computer users who now use Microsoft operating systems.\n\nCOMPANY FINANCES\n\nAccording to the company which cites prominent analysts, Microsoft Corporation for the end of 2002 and beginning of 2003 is expected to do better than its rivals and is a relatively low-risk stock. Nonetheless, earnings by July of 2002 have sagged drastically in a slowed economy from booming profits in January 2000. At the start of 2001, Microsoft had the rare chore of telling investors it had overestimated revenue for the year. Nonetheless, Microsoft is a proven company with proven results over nearly a quarter-century. Taken as a whole, registered Microsoft products such as Windows XP, the Xbox game, and MSN Internet Access services brought in 2001 revenues of $7.7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2001. However, on May 30, 2002, newspapers announced that Microsoft's reported earnings for 2001 made the company the latest giant to be accused of \"smoothing its [earnings] results by setting aside artificially large reserves to reduce revenues with the idea of reversing that procedure to record the revenues in less profitable future periods,\" according to the Deseret News and other newspapers. Microsoft has agreed to cooperate with the SEC but still may face civil charges, according to the Deseret News, citing copyrighted information and sources claimed by the Wall Street Journal. The 2001 annual report for Microsoft noted revenue of $25.3 billion, and operating income of $11.72 billion.\n\nHISTORY\n\nMicrosoft was founded in 1975 by high school friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen. While students at Harvard, the two developed the programming language called BASIC, which was used in the first commercial microcomputer, Altair. Gates dropped out of Harvard when he was 19 years old in order to sell a variation of BASIC with his friend. After moving to Albuquerque, the two men used a hotel room to launch Microsoft, originally called Micro-soft. The company continued to grow because they adapted their BASIC program to work on other computers.\n\nIn 1980, International Business Machines (IBM) chose Microsoft Over competing Digital Research to write its operating system (software that commands a computer's standard functions) for its new personal computer (PC). Under pressure, Microsoft purchased rights to QDOS, or quick and dirty operating system, for less than $100,000 from Seattle programmer Tim Paterson. They renamed it the Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS.\n\nIBM's PC was an instant hit and became the standard for PC operating systems in the 1980s. When other personal computer companies wanted to be compatible with IBM, MS-DOS became a dominant force in the industry. Microsoft continued to grow, creating software for IBM, Apple, and Radio Shack computers. In 1982 Microsoft opened its first European offices and, in 1983 the company expanded its horizons to include West Germany, France, Australia, and Korea.\n\nMicrosoft introduced its first Windows operating system in the mid-1980s, starting an avalanche of demand for PCs in the workplace and, finally, in the home. Windows opened up the world of computers to people with little technical background and allowed the PC industry to flourish in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, Windows was the world's leading operating system.\n\nAllen left the company in 1983 due to an illness but remained on the Microsoft board. Taking the company public in 1986, Gates instantly became the personal computer industry's first billionaire, holding 45 percent of the company's shares.\n\nIn 1997 the U.S. Department of Justice threatened to charge Microsoft with unfair business practices as a result of complaints from Internet browser developers that consumers using Windows 95 and the soon-to-be-released Windows 98 would be given Internet Explorer as part of their operating system. This was expected to make it difficult for consumers to choose a Microsoft competitor for their Internet browser. The Justice Department alleged that this constituted a monopoly and alerted the company that it faced possible anti-trust charges unless it unbundled certain applications, including the browser, from its operating systems. This action postponed the release of Windows 98. In June 1998, a federal appeals court lifted the injunction, allowing the sale of Microsoft's operating systems with the browser, and Windows 98 was rolled out in July.\n\nFAST FACTS: About Microsoft Corporation\n\nOwnership: Microsoft is a publicly owned company traded on NASDAQ.\n\nTicker symbol: MSFT\n\nOfficers: William H. (Bill) Gates III, Chmn. and Chief Software Architect, 47; Steven A. Ballmer, Pres., 46\n\nEmployees: 31,746\n\nChief Competitors: Microsoft not only produces operating systems and computer application software, but also offers an online service and is partner in a cable news operation. Some primary competitors include America Online, Apple Computer, AT&T Corp., IBM, MCI, Netscape, Computer Associates, Applied Microsystems Corp., and Novell.\n\nThe government case wasn't beneficial to either the image of Microsoft or Bill Gates, especially after Gates floundered and looked uncomfortable during questioning. The government ended up settling the case against the company. The company was forced to make the Windows operating system friendlier to competitors' soft-ware so that a competing browser could be launched by the user if so desired. Microsoft barely escaped having to break the company in half literally to comply with antitrust laws, but the court did find the company in violation of antitrust laws, paving way for AOL Time Warner and its Netscape Communications Corp. to pursue a civil suit that claimed the company's so-called \"bundling\" of its Internet Explorer browser in its own Windows operating system constituted unfair competition. That 2002 suit may take some years to come to a conclusion or settlement. Microsoft also has been taken to court by Sun Microsystems, maker of the Java Platform, which contends that Microsoft committed copyright infringement and violated additional antitrust laws; these civil matters also are likely to drag through the courts for years.\n\nIn the late 1990s and 2000s, Windows NT5 (rechristened Windows 2000) became the most familiar system in the global business world. In 2001, the company released Windows XP, a product with so many bugs in its storage system and other areas that a chastened Microsoft promised future releases would be more friendly to users and more bug-free. Microsoft also helped its bottom line during the softer economy of the 2000s with the release of a video game called Xbox.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nMicrosoft's success is largely due to its founder, chairman, and CEO, William H. Gates. His goal, the company says, has been to work toward improving and advancing his software, making it affordable and easy to use, although competitors harshly criticize the Windows operating system for frustrating flaws and crashes. According to the company, its mission is to \"create software for the personal computer that empowers and enriches people in the workplace, at school and at home. Microsoft's early vision of a computer on every desk and in every home is coupled today with a strong commitment to Internet-related technologies that expand the power and reach of the PC and its users.\" In 2001, Microsoft's much ballyhooed publicity campaign took a serious public relations and credibility hit when the company was forced to admit Windows XP has serious security flaws.\n\nINFLUENCES\n\nMicrosoft's first major success—developing MSDOS—began the company's reputation as the one to beat. As a dominant power in the industry, Microsoft has been accused of, and even taken to court for, questionable practices and ruthless tactics aimed at squashing its competition. Critics, and the U.S. Department of Justice, have accused it of creating a monopoly, or an economic good controlled by a single power. In other words, with Microsoft's financial status, coupled with its ability to \"bundle\" its own products inside the Windows operating system package, many competitors felt they did not have a chance to compete on the same playing field, and the Department of Justice in 2002 got a company settlement which proved as much.\n\nCHRONOLOGY: Key Dates for Microsoft Corporation\n\n1975:\n\nMicrosoft is founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen\n\n1979:\n\nCompany headquarters move from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Bellevue, Washington\n\n1981:\n\nIBM launches its Personal Computer run by Microsoft's MS-DOS; Microsoft incorporates\n\n1985:\n\nThe first version of Windows hits the market\n\n1986:\n\nMicrosoft goes public\n\n1988:\n\nApple sues Microsoft and its Windows system for copying the look and feel of a Macintosh\n\n1995:\n\nWindows 95 is launched\n\n1997:\n\nThe Department of Justice investigates an antitrust action against Microsoft\n\n1998:\n\nWindows 98 is released after a delay because of the investigation\n\n2002:\n\nRick Belluzzo, Microsoft Corp.'s president and chief operating officer, announced he was stepping down; Sun Microsystems takes Microsoft to court for alleged infringement of Java programming language and alleged antitrust practices; AOL Time Warner also sues Microsoft over what it terms unfair monopolistic practices; The Department of Justice finds a way to settle with Microsoft in spite of press, public, and some states' opposition to the done deal; the company agreed to share Windows software code with rival companies so that competing products can compete with Microsoft even while using Microsoft's operating system; unhappy with federal settlement, nine state prosecutors vow to seek antitrust penalties against Microsoft; The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft accounting practices are under scrutiny by the SEC; the company defended its accounting practices\n\nWhat is admirable about the company is the way it has taken failure and moved on until success came. Microsoft's huge size has meant it could afford experimentation and failure. Philip Elmer-Dewitt was quoted in Time as saying, \"the company never gives up.\" The reporter cited Microsoft's chief executive officer, Steve Ballmer, as saying, \"It doesn't matter if we bang our heads and fail. We keep right on banging and banging and banging and banging.\" The mission to always be ahead or way ahead of the competition proved successful when Microsoft took over Software Arts, which created the electronic spreadsheet. This strategy rang true once again when Microsoft, after several delays, introduced Windows 95, a modern version of a 10-year-old product.\n\nOf course, along with its quest for power came times of frustration. Tough economic times even took their toll on Bill Gates' checking account. In 2000, Forbes reported Gates' personal fortune at $92.7 billion. In 2001, that total was reduced to $54.4 billion, and in 2002 to $34.5 billion, just enough to still make him the world's richest person. Much of his \"lost\" income was in stock contributed to charities that he and his wife support.\n\nInstead of being ahead of the competition in the world of the Internet, Microsoft spent time chasing Netscape, a leading power in the Internet arena. To meet this challenge, Microsoft programmers developed new products devised to entice Internet users in their direction. Microsoft released its web-browsing software, Internet Explorer, as part of Windows 95, and its upgrade with Windows 98. As a result, in 2002, the U.S. Department of Justice settled with Microsoft which had, in effect, used its monopoly power to prevent its rivals from selling its products when it made its own browser part of its operating system. The fact that Internet Explorer was offered free to purchasers of Windows products made it difficult for Netscape and other browser producers to sell their products. In 2002, AOL Time Warner elected to take Microsoft to court charging unfair competition over the browser flap. In its defense, Microsoft and gates maintained that state and federal governments have stripped Microsoft of its right to software and other intellectual properties that were the result of expensive research, development, and employee hirings.\n\nCURRENT TRENDS\n\nMicrosoft continues to try to corner every aspect of the Internet market. It has developed products to allow people to conduct business over the Internet, including Microsoft Internet Information Server, Microsoft SQL Server, and the BackOffice family of products. In June of 2002, Bill Gates announced that absolute computer security has become the next big challenge for the company, and that his goal is to make all transactions by computer \"trustworthy.\" Under the code name Palladium, named for the statue of Athena which guarded ancient Troy, Microsoft has vowed to redesign \"the architecture of PCs\" in order \"to dramatically improve our ability to control and protect personal and corporate information,\" says Newsweek magazine. In other words, not only will sender identity and cash transactions finally be made truly secure, but spam, hacker-sent viruses, and unintentional meltdowns caused by internal bugs will also be dreaded problems of the past if Bill Gates' latest ambitious goal can be met.\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nMicrosoft software is compatible with most PCS, including Intel microprocessor-based computers and Apple computers which have software for the Mac (Macintosh). Because of Department of Justice action, Microsoft in 2002 has been forced to allow rivals a more sporting competitive edge.\n\nCORPORATE CITIZENSHIP\n\nAccording to its corporate Web site, Microsoft's credo is that \"amazing things happen when people get the resources they need.\" This belief is the foundation of the company's community affairs initiative. Microsoft contributes cash and software to non-profit organizations, supports education through many programs, supports efforts to improve learning and expand diversity in higher education, supports organizations in communities where its employees live and work, supports major arts organizations, and more.\n\nIn 2001, Microsoft and Microsoft employees donated $215 million \"to help people and communities realize their potential,\" boasts the Microsoft Web site. In addition, after Bill Gates authored two books (Business@ the Speed of Thought and The Road Ahead) that were New York Times best sellers for many weeks, he donated all profits to non-profit corporations advancing computer technology in education. Bill and wife Melinda have started and maintained a $21 billion foundation to support projects related to global health and learning. The Gates family has spent $500 million to bring computer Internet capabilities to low-income communities.\n\nGLOBAL PRESENCE\n\nMicrosoft is highly dependent upon foreign markets, although its revenue base is clearly in the United States. With offices in West Germany, France, Australia, Korea, and Great Britain, Microsoft is the world's largest software manufacturer and has employees all over the world. According to Microsoft's corporate Web site, the company maintains offices in 60 countries. It would be impossible to find a country on earth that didn't have Microsoft products somewhere on its soil. Microsoft in 2001 and 2002 has lobbied Congress to cut taxes on global profits from 35 percent to 5 percent, saying that such a move would be good for the overall economy and lead to at-home investments that would jumpstart the U.S. economy.\n\nEMPLOYMENT\n\nMicrosoft employs 31,746 people worldwide. Microsoft has established many cultural groups to support its diverse workplace population, and Microsoft executives regularly speak on ways to ensure minority participation in business. These groups include: Blacks at Microsoft; Chinese at Microsoft; Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Employees at Microsoft; Microsoft Women's Group; Jews at Microsoft; Microsoft Grupo Unido IberoAmericano; and Native Americans at Microsoft. In addition, Microsoft sponsors scholarships and organized cultural activities available to all of its employees.\n\nSOURCES OF INFORMATION\n\nBibliography\n\n\"apple woos potential windows defectors.\" newhouse news service, 8 april 2002.\n\nlevy, stephen. \"the big secret.\" newsweek, 1 july 2002.\n\n\"microsoft corporation.\" hoover's online, 2 july 2002. available at http://www.hoovers.com.\n\nmicrosoft's home page, 2 july 2002. available at http://www.microsoft.com.\n\n\"microsoft is negotiating with sec, journal reports.\" the deseret news, 30 may 2002.\n\n\"microsoft, p&g seek u.s. tax break for global profits.\" bloomberg news, 9 november 2001.\n\nmoltzen, edward f. \"salary survey.\" computer reseller news, 24 june 2002.\n\n\"timeline.\" washington post online, july 2002. available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/technology/specials/microsoft/timeline.\n\nFor an annual report:\n\non the internet at: http://www.microsoft.com\n\nFor additional industry research:\n\ninvestigate companies by their standard industrial classification codes, also known as sics. microsoft's primary sics are:\n\n7372 prepackaged software\n\n7375 information retrieval services\n\n7383 news syndicates\n\nalso investigate companies by their north american industry classification system codes, also known as naics codes. microsoft's primary naics code is:\n\n511210 software publishers\n\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\nOne Microsoft Way\n\nRedmond, WA 98052-6399\n\n(42S) 882-8080\n\nwww.microsoft.com\n\nMany companies make personal computers, but just one business—Microsoft Corporation—dominates the development of the software that runs on those machines. Microsoft built its success on its operating systems, the programs that control a computer's different functions and act as the \"middlemen\" between the machine's hardware and software. From there, the company began producing its own software programs, then expanded into the Internet and other forms of communication.\n\nAlong with success, Microsoft earned a reputation for ruthlessly trying to control the computer market. The quest for domination reflected the drive of the company's cofounder and leader, Bill Gates. Intelligent and impatient, Gates's success with Microsoft made him the richest person in the world. Gates and his company, however, have drawn loud criticism for their practices and faced several lawsuits.\n\nAltair Leads the Way\n\nIn December 1974, Paul Allen and Bill Gates, two longtime friends from Seattle, Washington, read about a new computer that came in a kit, called the Altair 8800. The Altair was one of the first microcomputers—what are now called personal computers, or PCs. Gates later wrote in his 1995 book The Road Ahead, \"Paul and I didn't know exactly how [the Altair] would be used, but we were sure it would change us and the world of computing.\"\n\nAllen and Gates had already worked with BASIC, a simple programming language created in 1964. The two friends decided to create a version of BASIC that would run on the Altair, which used a new microprocessor built by Intel. (A microprocessor, or chip, is a collection of transistors and other tiny electrical parts that act as the \"brain\" of any personal computer.) Allen and Gates contacted MITS, the Albuquerque, New Mexico, company that made the Altair. They told MITS they had already developed a form of BASIC to r"
