This is not the first time this has happened request removal of edits by IP and page protection. Darkhumor224 (talk)\n\nprobably should report to Wikidata:Administrators' noticeboard though I imagine an admin will come by here eventually. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nHandled at AN. Bovlb (talk)\n\nI think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment. Bovlb (talk)\n\nItem Q14522384 (nl) need to merged with item Q2546987 (ca/de/en/es/fr/it/pt). Probably also a name (title) changed used? (From “Xorret del Catí” to “Xorret de Catí”) With kind regards, Pucky (talk) (PS, if wrong posted here, please remove it to where it belongs! I have really no idea!)\n\nIf you want to try it yourself, the gadget mentioned on Help:Merge is the way to do it. --- Jura\n\n@Jura: thanks for the links. I have succesfully done it by myself. Pucky (talk)\n\nGood to hear. Congrats! --- Jura\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: --- Jura\n\nThere's a disagreement as to whether Glasgow Subway needs one item or two. Could we get more input here please. The discussion, to date, from Request a Query is:\n\nIn other news, how exactly does Glasgow subway line (Q106328343) differ from Glasgow Subway (Q506290)? They seem to be *exactly* the same thing.\n\nAnyways, just check Q2546530#P361 and Q2546530#P81. A subway station should be part of a network on a certain subway line. It happens some subway networks can be one lined only, but network different from (P1889) line. --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\n@Bouzinac: Strongly disagree. There is a single thing, calling for a single item carrying a plurality of P31 values. The subway - Glasgow Subway (Q506290) - is the line, per its description \"underground metro line in Glasgow, Scotland\". There is no good reason to have a discrete items carring the rapid transit railway line (Q15079663) and circle route (Q145179) P31 values, when these can & should be on the Glasgow Subway (Q506290). A station can be part of (P361), and have a connecting line (P81) both pointing to the same item; this being the case, can you suggest any other reason which validates the duplicate you've created? --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nI'm sorry but they are two different concept. A subway line and a subway network. What happens if Glasgow builds a second subway line? Merkland Street subway station (Q6819640)'s part of (P361) cannot nowadays be Glasgow Subway (Q506290) but connecting line (P81)=Glasgow subway line (Q106328343) still true.\n\nAnother example in a very different field : Château Perrier (Q28003614) and Château Perrier (Q22979594). Single concepts should be having their own item. In the Glasgow case, they happen to be \"almost\" the same but not and connecting line (P81) // part of (P361) be having their correct item --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\n@Bouzinac: No. A museum and the building it is housed in are indeed distict things: the museum can be uplifted and taken to a different building. In Glasgow there is a single metro line, Glasgow subway. Call it what you like, the line, the subway, the network are the same thing. In this circustance, a single item suffices, and splitting the item serves no useful purpose. If a second line is ever built, we can revisit the question - but this is not very likely. To repeat, a \"network\" comprising a single line is the same thing as the single line. Merkland Street subway station (Q6819640) is part of (P361) and has connecting line (P81) Glasgow Subway (Q506290) --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nDisagree again, sorry. Look at the definition of rapid transit (Q5503) : it is a network and possibly can be running buses, subways, suburban trains, not only subway lines per se. --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nIs the subway as 'connecting line' the same as the subway as a rapid transit network? --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nTo me this feels a lot like the eternal debate over whether an island (Q23442) or archipelago (Q33837) needs a separate entity for the coterminous administrative territorial entity (Q56061) -- as we've been discussing most recently for the Balearic Islands. Me, I would say that a rapid transit system deserves a separate entity for its subway line, even if there's only one of them, because the properties you attach to rapid transit systems are different from those you attach to a subway line. (Systems have employees, lines have stations, etc.) —Scs (talk)\n\nAgree that they seem to be the same thing, and should be merged. If a second subway line is built then maybe it would be worth splitting, but it seems to have been over 120 years since the last one... Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nBut a counterargument would be that it seems silly to use two essentially different schemas for single-line versus multi-line rapid transit systems. I think this may add needless complexity for both the people who are inputting data, and extracting it. —Scs (talk)\n\nIn general, fewer items are better, rather than overcomplicating things. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nThing is, we may have dueling complexities here. If I had just written some code for enumerating or cross-referencing, say, a rapid transit's lines and stations, and then discovered that it didn't work in Glasgow due to someone's \"helpful optimization\" of coalescing the line and the system, I might say, \"Why did you make this so complicated?\" (Also, I'm afraid the \"keep the number of entities to a minimum\" ship has well and truly sailed...) —Scs (talk)\n\nAgreed with dueling complexities. I understand the 'minimum' ship has sailed overall for Wikidata, given ~100m items, but for individual topics it's still a good rule. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nPlease do not mix carrots and cabbages . If we wish to list (as there https://w.wiki/3GB4) which subway line(s) has subway stations in the UK (as in other countries), inside the P86, you would have a mix of \"line [x] of thisCity subway\" and \"thisCity subway\" which does not clearly help the P86 look clean. Plus... there is a project of a second Glasgow subway line...[1]Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nIf work actually starts on it, or someone writes a Wikipedia article about it, then maybe OK, but while it's still hypothetical it makes less sense. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nWikidata is a supporting tool for langwikis but has its own existence and its own needs too, per WD:N. --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nThe issue:\n\nVisit Altin_Byty as an example, here you will find that the link given in the External Links section in the format -> Altin Bytyçi – UEFA competition record. The link given shows that the page does not exist. This could probably be because UEFA changed their website layout. Now, if you visit the above page's Wikidata item page and go to Identifier section -> UEFA Player ID property value 250138550 this will take you to the correct UEFA page of the player. To solve this issue one of the approaches could be to change the formatter URL on the Wikidata property, and the URL in the enwp template as suggested by Mike_Peel.\n\nAny input for this issue is welcome!\n\nSome other pages that have the same issue: Iran Junior, Abbie Magee, Natasha Flint, Mads Bech Sørensen.--ANU Outreachy (talk)\n\n@ANU Outreachy: This doesn't seem to require any action on Wikidata (since our formatter URL works fine); the only issue is at en:Template:UEFA player. Also, the old and the new links don't have equivalent information; see en:Template talk:UEFA player#Template:UEFA player is broken for more on that. If you come up with a solution, that's the best place to continue. Vahurzpu (talk)\n\n@Vahurzpu:Yes, you are right about Wikidata needing no change. I'll continue this discussion on the page you suggested. Thanks! --ANU Outreachy (talk)\n\nI would like to show what day and even what time power is transferred in a political office. We have a place to store the value for the length of a term, I want to show the date the term starts. For some positions it begins on January 1, for some positions January 4, some begin the day of an election. I want to avoid changing the 50 entries from showing say \"start_date=1950\" to \"start_date=January 1, 1950\" and have the value stored in the entry for the position. See for instance: Mayor of Bound Brook, New Jersey (Q106370185) vs Talk:Q106370185, I tried \"start_date=January 1\" for the start date at the entry on the position, but we currently do not allow that. Any suggestions? --RAN (talk)\n\nonly thing I can think of involves editing all 50 statements. for many offices hand overs can happen on irregular dates (e.g. death/resignation) or the office can be vacant. maybe use bots/automation? BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nAt Help:Statements, I split this into\n\nHelp:Statements#Order of properties and\n\nHelp:Statements#Order of statements for a property\n\nAlso, as it was somewhat outdated, I updated and expanded it a bit. Please help by improving it further. --- Jura\n\nI need an advice regarding to capital letter in English in a ticket name. I can understand that the description can start without capital letter but in my opinion the name of a ticket should generally start with capital leter. Pleas see tomb of Shimon bar Yochai (Q5371188). I was reverted there but not sure what is the correct. Geagea (talk)\n\nI believe you're talking about labels, then the relevant guidance is in Help:Label. Our convention is that both labels and descriptions should be in \"mid-sentence case\", so (in English and many other languages) they should not start with a capital letter unless they start with a proper name. In this case, I would say that \"tomb\" is not part of a proper name, but usage seems to vary. If I'm in any doubt about the capitalization of an item label, my usual recourse is to look in Wikipedia and find mid-sentence usage. For example, en:Tomb of the Unknown Soldier uses \"Tomb\" whereas en:Tomb of Munmu of Silla uses \"tomb\". I feel that the former is capitalized because it is a title and would not work as a definite description, whereas the latter (and your example) does work as a definite description. Bovlb (talk)\n\nThank you for the answer. I understand the logic. It's makes things complicated but probably correct. If I will use the Q-number in Commons in a mid of sentence it should not be with capital letter. Geagea (talk)\n\n@Geagea: If you're using the Q template on Commons, be aware that it has a \"capitalization\" flag. If you want a Q term to be capitalized, you can use capitalization=ucfirst. Bovlb (talk)\n\nThanks, it's useful info. Geagea (talk)\n\nHow should we record the name of the craftsperson to whom a person was apprenticed? I've been using student of (P1066) with qualifier <subject has role> \"apprentice\" (see Q18756897#P1066), but that is not a valid qualifier. Should we add the qualifier, or propose a new property \"apprenticed to\"? - PKM (talk)\n\nI think \"subject has role\" has a place with this property so I added it to the allowed qualifiers. --SCIdude (talk)\n\n@SCIdude: thanks! PKM (talk)\n\nYesterday I noticed that Bouzinac is batch-copying English labels into French. Is that the proper thing to do? I argued with him that labels should either be a proper translation, or a French transliteration of the original names when necessary. I bring the issue here for better advice. —capmo (talk)\n\nDo you have sources for French translation of each subway stations (roughly ~13954 items) ? --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nSo you're saying that a wrong information is better than nothing? Sorry, I can't agree with that. —capmo (talk)\n\nCopying English don't really seem wrong, or at least no more or less wrong than an invented translation (which one, translations are multiple) or translitteration (same remark). I wouldn't copy labels but now that it's done, I wouldn't remove them either. And if you found some reliable source, then just correct the labels (that's the wiki way for decades, improve bit by bit to make things better). Chers, VIGNERON (talk)\n\n(maybe off-topic) It's not wrong but aren't there more important things to do with a bot? --SCIdude (talk)\n\nit's hard to get people to agree about what's \"important\" here and I try not to judge. though I agree copying labels seems fairly low value in general (and potentially harmful in some cases) BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nMistakes are always possible and anyone is free to correct in Wikidata . There are indeed some questions on subway stations :\n\nShould they in fact be translated in proper language ? Eg non-French labels for that République - Beaux-Arts (Q400325)\n\nFor non-latin languages (Asia, etc) subway stations, getting a translation/transliterration helps the reader get what it is about eg Seonjeongneung(Q46111) is more readable for a French than 선정릉역 in its own language. And helps correct some subways network, eg https://w.wiki/3Gbn\n\nIf no sources exists for a translation (eg any travel guide, a french written official subway website, etc), then it's better having enlabel-->frlabel than having nothing in frlabel.Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nI haven't worked it through to a detailed or formal procedure, but I wish that in many cases, and regardless of a user's language preferences, if an entity has a label in only one language, that label would be displayed. There are plenty of cases -- like, say, subway stations in Paris -- where there really is one (local) name, and it's the name anyone's going to use in any language, and seems pretty pointless to have to represent that situation explitly in the database with N identical labels tagged with N different languages. —Scs (talk)\n\nI'd just like to point out that batch copying labels appears to be the norm with respect to Asturian (@YoaR, Amasuela: (and I more than likely missed a few more people doing this) who have been doing this), and thus the discussion above applies to them as well. Mahir256 (talk)\n\nI'd like to remind one of drawback not having ownlanguage label is that phenomenon in the watchlist (see image)\n\nBouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nThe policy we follow (Asturian speakers coming from astwiki) is to use the work's label in its original language: film, song, writing, book, etc., unless that work is translated or dubbed to Asturian. In that case, Asturian title is used as label and the original language title as alias. The same applies, for example, to cities: official name unless there's a trustly reference to an Asturian name. This applies only to latin scripts. YoaR (talk)\n\nHello, I am trying to link TANF Extension Act of 2019 (Q106504757) to the English Wikipedia redirect page w:en:TANF Extension Act of 2019. However, it does not let me (and appears to be following the redirect and trying to add the target of the redirect). How is this done? Thank you! Tol | Talk | Contribs\n\n@Tol: yeah this is a known bug/limitation. the way to do this for now is to temporarily unredirect the enwiki page, link it and then re-redirect it BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nAh; thank you! Tol | Talk | Contribs\n\n@Lydia Pintscher (WMDE): It's again me. Any update on redirects? There are few threads about it a month from what I can see. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nThere was some discussion about this at Wikidata:Requests_for_deletions/Archive/2021/05/01#Q104236733. Apparently, the creator and the closing administrator think we should have items for category intersections like Category:Views from automobiles in Queens, New York City (Q104236177). Currently, there is no item for \"automobiles in Queens\".\n\nThis could mean we will have items for every category on Commons. Seems odd now that Commons moves away from categories.\n\n@Lymantria, Mike Peel:. --- Jura\n\nCorrection: I closed the request because there was a (valid) site link and apart from Jura1 as proposer there was no support for deletion for several months. If discussion is needed, here might be a better place than at RfD. Lymantria (talk)\n\nPersonally, I'd expect admins to delete or not based on WD:N. It's fairly Common that there is just a person requesting deletion and the deleting admin having to decide based on WD:N. I don't think a contributor would create an item if they assumed it didn't meet WD:N. RfD isn't a good place to discuss if WD:N should be changed (or not applied). --- Jura\n\nAbout category for the view from the item (P8933): the correct value for Q18424#P8933 would be \"Views from Queens\". Similarly, for Manhattan (Q11299), we end up having not just\n\nCategory:Views from Manhattan (Q106675198), but also:\n\nCategory:Views from automobiles in Manhattan (Q104433315)\n\nCategory:Views of the Hudson River from Manhattan (Q106341534)\n\nc:Category:Brooklyn skylines from Manhattan\n\nc:Category:Brooklyn Heights skylines from Manhattan\n\nc:Category:Long Island City skylines from Manhattan\n\netc. at Q11299#P8933 --- Jura\n\n\"we will have items for every category on Commons\" - we're getting there. After all, Commons categories are one of the biggest users of Wikidata information in the Wikimedia projects right now (that I'm aware of). There should be no problem with these items. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nExcept for that the RFC which lead to the adoption of our notability criteria concluded that such categories are not notable.--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nWhich RfC? Are you referring to one that predated the infobox? Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\nI have second thoughts, I think I wrongly read WD:N 1.4.b in connection with category for the view from the item (P8933) I will delete the items. Lymantria (talk)\n\nThanks. Category:Views from Manhattan (Q106675198) can be kept (it wasn't listed for deletion, I had made it yesterday when I noticed that we were actually missing the one we should have for P8933). --- Jura\n\nRestored. I was a bit in a hurry this morning. Lymantria (talk)\n\n@Lymantria: What the...? You could have at least pinged me. These items should be covered by 'the item is used in a Commons-related statement' unless someone removed the links. Never mind, the bot will recreate them next time it runs. Thanks. Mike Peel (talk)\n\n@Mike Peel: My apologies for being to much in a hurry to ping you. I understood this morning that you incorrectly used category for the view from the item (P8933) at Manhattan (Q11299), and that I had not taken from the discussion earlier (while I didn't read it for the first or second time). It concerns views from Manhattan (Q11299), not from vehicles to Manhattan (Q11299). Recreation of course doesn't solve that. Lymantria (talk)\n\n@Lymantria: Given that I both proposed and populated the property, and am using the info on Commons in the infoboxes (which are now broken in these categories as a result of the deletions), and have already explained why it's not incorrect usage in the (closed) deletion discussion (not perfect, true - could be improved - but not incorrect), care to reconsider again...? Mike Peel (talk)\n\nNot until the scope bounderies are clear, now there seems to be no limit. \"Views from...\" seems reasonable, I agree with Jura that \"views from ... to...\" and \"views from cars in ....\" at least need more discussion and it is quite questionable if we want all those claims in items. It is potentially endless. Lymantria (talk)\n\nA discussion like we just had in the deletion debate, which you closed as no consensus...? Mike Peel (talk)\n\nWell, that lacked participants. I think it would need a new property, wouldn't it? Lymantria (talk)\n\nWikiProject Taxonomy has more than 50 participants and couldn't be pinged. Please post on the WikiProject's talk page instead.\n\nAccording to List of properties/Top100 taxon name (P225) is used more than 3,000,000 times. --Succu (talk)\n\nCongrats! --- Jura\n\nHi everyone,\n\nThis is to announce that over the past month we started to look at ways to help us all get a better understanding of the quality of Wikidata's data in a specific area of interest. For this purpose we worked on building two tools; an Item Quality Evaluator and a Constraint Violation Checker - both of these tools are now available at:\n\nItem Quality Evaluator\n\nConstraint Violation Checker\n\nData quality on Wikidata has many aspects. The constraint violations and ORES quality scores that these tools use are two helpful indicators of certain aspects of quality that we hope will be helpful for you.\n\nAs you may know, Wikidata’s data quality is very unevenly distributed - some areas are very well maintained and others not so much. We only currently provide ORES quality scores on a global and per-Item level. This has two effects, however:\n\nEditors taking care of a specific area of Wikidata want to improve that area but currently don’t have an easy way to find the Items with the lowest quality they can focus their time on in order to raise the quality of that area.\n\nRe-user of Wikidata’s data are usually only interested in a subset of Wikidata’s Items and by extension the quality of that subset. It is currently hard for them to know what quality level they are getting for their subset of interest.\n\nTo address this issue we put together two small tools. The Item Quality Evaluator is a simple website that provides ORES quality scores for a list of Items in Wikidata. The Constraint Violation Checker is a small command-line script that retrieves the number of constraint violations and ORES scores for a list of Items for further analysis.\n\nHow does the Item Quality Evaluator tool work?\n\nYou provide it with a list of Item IDs or a SPARQL query and then it'll get the ORES score for each of them as well as the average score over all the Items you provided in a nice webpage. This way, you can more easily identify the Items in an area you are interested in that have the lowest quality and improve them.\n\nHow does the Constraint Violation Checker script work?\n\nWhen you run it, it outputs a CSV file with the number of statements, the number of constraint violations for each severity level, the number of sitelinks to all projects and to Wikipedia and the ORES score for each of those Items.\n\nWhy didn't we integrate the constraint violations data into the Item Quality Evaluator?\n\nWe want to do that in the long-term but right now it is not possible because the constraint violation data is not easily accessible and retrieving it takes several hours to run for a large list of items.\n\nPlease try these tools and let us know if you encounter any issues. If you want to provide general feedback, feel free to let us know.\n\nCheers, -Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk)\n\nI tried the Item Quality Evaluator – it’s indeed a good way to find items to work on. However, the main problem with ORES scores is that they overvalue the mere existence of descriptions. --Emu (talk)\n\nyeah I tried two items where I subjectively thought one was better than the other and found the tool disagreed basically because of the description. I added a totally uninformative description (just the name of the P31 value) and it shot up. Still a useful tool though. Wonder how it compares with just Wikidata:Recoin. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nRecoin is a completeness indicator based on similar items. It has its merits, but it has little to do with data quality, i.e. if the data provided is properly referenced (and the references match the statements they are referencing). To my knowledge, there isn’t a really useful tool that focuses on data quality in that sense yet. --Emu (talk)\n\n@Mohammed Sadat (WMDE): Took a quick look at the Item Quality Evaluator and it looks interesting. However, I would request that a unique logo/favicon be used -- distinguishable from the Wikidata project logo -- so that it's more clear this is a tool and not core functionality. William Graham (talk)\n\nThanks for that suggestion William Graham. -Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk)\n\nWas there some community request to develop the \"Item Quality Evaluator\"? In which part of the project plan were these included and how much time was spent developing these? Can you provide us with links to the relevant documentation so we can read about it? Thanks. --- Jura\n\nHello Jura! There was no direct community request per se, but we outlined that in the roadmap. We wrote in the 2021 development plan that we will be providing a tool to help assess the quality of a subset of Wikidata's Items. Please see the Roadmunk for more details. -Mohammed Sadat (WMDE) (talk)\n\nHello, what's the difference between ORES and Recoin (Q50320796) ?--Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\n@Bouzinac: Recoin checks what kind of statements similar items have and then estimates the completeness of a given item. Say an item about a philosopher doesn’t have statements that other items about philosophers typically have: That would result in a low Recoin score. It’s purely based on statements in similar items and therefore 100% deterministic, that is, humans make the rules, the computer just computes.\n\nORES uses machine learning (that is, computer magic) to automatically determine the quality of an item. It also uses statements, but also descriptions and other information. It’s not deterministic, so it’s not always clear why a certain ORES score is computed (which has positive and negative consequences).\n\nBoth Recoin and ORES try to give you a ballpark figure about data quality, but they are computed very differently and focus on different things. --Emu (talk)\n\nIt's unclear to me where the training data for ORES comes from. References seem to make little to no difference whatsoever, even though they are vital for any real use of the data.\n\nPersonally, I noticed only when I actually wanted to use some data in work projects how important references actually are. It's incredibly frustrating to have all these statements and no way to verify them. This wasn't readily apparent when I was just browsing around, before, and it seems to me that mindset may be reflected in the training data. It's frustrating to see even non-trivial data still being added without references today. I wouldn't complain if all such data were to be deleted overnight. I'd advocate for making it impossible or difficult to add more of it now, at least in volume and starting with sensitive properties. And I'd absolutely expect a tool focussing on \"quality\" to put proper referencing front and center. Karl Oblique (talk)\n\nYou may have noticed that the Discover section on the Main Page has been recently updated, featuring a new WikiProject after several years. Unfortunately this means a lot of translation work is needed based on the new English text, so feel free to contribute translations for this. --Btcprox (talk)\n\nIt's too much work to translate every time there's a change, so could you please design it to be static content? Afaz (talk)\n\nThe description for the featured WikiProject can't really be static in every language though, as far as I'm aware. Would be nice if there were some magic tool/bot that at least laid the foundations down with some machine-assisted translation or something. But I doubt completely omitting the description would be helpful here. Btcprox (talk)\n\nThanks for changing it (and announcing that it changed). I think it had been up for months till I noticed that the previous one was there. --- Jura\n\nI wonder if this is the correct practice to copy an English label to other languages ? Like in Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells are a site of murine cytomegalovirus latency and reactivation (Q37333761) Asturian and Dutch labels are copies of the English one. Following this practice we'll end up with hundreds of identical labels. Maybe translations would be better idea ? Kpjas (talk)\n\nAt least, the automatic fall-back to English can provide the same. No need to copy 30 millions paper labels to 200 languages\n\nWhat is bad, is that English translations of non-English titles are copied as well. --- Jura\n\n@Kpjas: why would this be incorrect? Think about specific edition of book, the title is the same in all languages (with latin alphabet obviously), same for most name of people. « we'll end up with hundreds of identical labels », this is already very often the case. Not efficient but is there an other way to do it? Cheers, VIGNERON (talk)\n\nWith millions of edits that are not very productive (they don't add any new information) I would consider this practice to be a waste of Wikidata's workforce time and (Quickstatements') resources. Some central (software) mechanism would be more practicable IMO. Kpjas (talk)\n\nHow bad would it be for Wikidata to have a \" special fall-back label\" field for label with precedence to English? E.g., in order of priority: current language -> fallback special label --> English . Most cases would be the same, but perhaps better models non-English works. TiagoLubiana (talk)\n\n@TiagoLubiana: such fallback could be useful but this is not solving the problem at hand here. I - repectfully but strongly - with @Kpjas: claim that « they don't add any new information », there is an information in saying \"I explicitely states that the label is the same in these languages\" and this is very different from a fallback which is more or less \"I have no idea what the label is in your language, just take this one based on a more or less accurate global rule\". For instance, think about Berlin (Q64) where the label in a lot of languages is \"Berlin\" but this is not random and you can't use a fallback (or a very cleverly tailored one). You can also think about Romeo and Juliet (Q83186) (where labels should be different, a work title is translated) and Romeo and Juliet (Q19101569) (most but not all labels should be the same, a edition title is not translated, but it could be transcripted or transliterrated). Obivously scientific papers are close the this last example. Cheers, VIGNERON (talk)\n\nI think the label of the item for the city of Berlin and the work Romeo and Julia are off topic. --- Jura\n\n@TiagoLubiana: For papers, the general fall-back should be the title. When used as a reference in an article, in most languages, I think that should be displayed anyways. The problem seems to be that some Wikipedias don't make correctly use of this and might expect the French label and display nothing if it isn't present (instead of starting out with the title and eventually falling back to English). So yes, most of the time, there is no use to copy the English translation of a Spanish paper to Dutch and Asturian. --- Jura\n\nHow to add statement for \"Area: Europe\"? Eurohunter (talk)\n\nIt seems lit refers to different areas in English and (of all languages) German. --- Jura\n\n@Jura1: I see it the same way you do. I guess the data object should be split up, right? --Gymnicus (talk)\n\nWhat do you mean? Eurohunter (talk)\n\n@Eurohunter: If you look at the German article D-A-CH and the Spanish article Europa germanoparlante (english: German-speaking Europe), than you can see that the article is about different things. In principle, one could even say that the statement D-A-CHsubclass of (P279)German-speaking Europe applies. --Gymnicus (talk)\n\nI just noticed it and I will divide it. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nIf Q1151241 is made about the word, maybe a third item about these three countries as a group should be created. --- Jura\n\nWho were her parents – The preceding unsigned comment was added by 216.56.51.66 (talk • contribs).\n\n@216.56.51.66: According to Irena Sendler (Q151932), her father was Stanisław Krzyżanowski (Q61911671). More information is available at en:Irena Sendler. Bovlb (talk)\n\nHello,\n\nI have a data-collection project underway called \"Open Editors\". It used webscraping to collect data about almost half a million researchers who are in the editorial boards of ca. 6.000 scholarly journals. I plan to scrape regularly (annually over the next few years) so that the data get updated.\n\nI would love the data to be freely available, not just with a CC0-license and a CSV-file (on GitHub), but at Wikidata, so that the data can be linked extensively.\n\nHowever, I am too new at Wikidata; I lack the knowledge on how to do proceed.\n\nThus, may I ask, what I shall I do in order to initiate a data donation? Is the dataset even suitable for such a venture?\n\nThank you!\n\nAndrepach (talk)\n\nNice. The journal link can be used as reference, as you also recorded the date when you visited it.\n\nhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Data_donation --SCIdude (talk)\n\nHi everyone,\n\nVoter turnout in prior board elections was about 10% globally. We know we can get more voters to help assess and promote the best candidates, but to do that, we need your help.\n\nWe are looking for volunteers to serve as Election Volunteers. You can read more about this role here: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_elections/2021/2021-04-29/Call_for_Board_Elections_Volunteers\n\nElection Volunteers should have a good understanding of their communities. The facilitation team sees Election Volunteers as doing the following:\n\nPromote the election in their communities’ channels\n\nOrganize discussions about the election in their communities\n\nTranslate messages for their communities\n\nDo you want to be an Election Volunteer for Wikidata or any of the Wiki projects, and connect your community with this movement effort? Check out more details about Election Volunteers and add your name next to the community you will support in this table or get in contact with a facilitator. We aim to have at least one Election Volunteer for Wiki Projects in the top 30 for eligible voters. Even better if there are two or more sharing the work.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments regarding this role please reach out to me or any of the board governance facilitators.\n\nBest,Zuz (WMF) (talk)\n\nCurrently we have 135,555,066 statements with author name string (P2093), mostly on items about scholarly papers.\n\nThe following proposals:\n\nWikidata:Property_proposal/Author_last_names\n\nWikidata:Property_proposal/Author_first_names\n\npropose to complete that with two more qualifiers/triples, each. That would be 270 million more triples on query service.\n\nWhile there may be some benefit to it, I think we should be able to come up with a better solution. --- Jura\n\nThese have been in discussion since last year, and are necessary to be able to reformat 'First Middle Last' as 'Last, First Middle' within en:Template:Cite Q at least - with the current setup it is impossible to know what is part of the first/last name and what isn't. They finally got marked as ready for creation yesterday, and now you start a discussion here??? Mike Peel (talk)\n\nI don't see the size question addressed in the discussion and it's fairly unrelated to the proposals as such. --- Jura\n\nI believe these should only be added where a bibliographic reference clearly makes the separation into first and last, which in my view is likely to be only a tiny fraction of the total. ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nWhat leads you to believe that? The problem on Wikipedia this attempts to solve isn't limited to these. Besides most author name strings are trivial to split into \"last name\" and \"first name\". Also, doesn't the source for most entries (Pubmed) split them for most names? --- Jura\n\nInstead of complaining about size of two links to existing items added, think about the size needed for the author strings. In principle they could be deleted after first/last are added, and you would gain space. --SCIdude (talk)\n\nWell, yes, but, mainly no. The size of the string stored pales into insignificance against the size of the triples created to store strings, and, moreover, the proposal is for qualifiers of the P2093 statement, which would not work very well if the P2093 statement was deleted. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nIndeed, you might want to re-read the proposal. BTW, it's two per author (P50) or author name string (P2093) statement. So the total is probably 310,000,000 triples. --- Jura\n\nSo yes, 310M new triples, adding roughly 2.4% to the number of triples in WD, which is equivalent to 2 months of normal triple growth. It's unlikely the query service will care very much from a reporting perspective. The main pain arises in the RDF serialisation; but iirc that was recently substantially improved? And otoh, we probably should be here to make WD data usable, which CiteQ does well. WD is only going to get larger and its data more Baroque. I'm not convinced the argument for restraint, in this instance, is made. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nAt the risk of being late to this discussion, I am missing some acknowledgment/reasoning for going with what seems to be a rather untypical data structure. The straightforward data model would link papers to items for authors. Any possibly needed properties for formatting their names would then be added to those items. The advantages are, obviously:\n\nName strings are only recorded once, simplifying any corrections and saving storage space and triplets otherwise wasted on redundant information\n\nItem references (integers) use less storage space than strings, further reducing storage requirements\n\nAuthor items link between that author's papers, allowing the data to be used in the way all other data is used, such as by querying etc.\n\nI get that it isn't entirely obvious how to distinguish between multiple authors with the same name, but:\n\nThe sources for the current data usually do link to author pages, either specific to a publication, at the author's institution, or at one of meta-services (researchgate etc)\n\nWhen I started in academia, it was common practice to search one's name and find some variation of name/middle initial(s)/nickname that was unique\n\nSubject matter, publication date, language, and names of collaborators could all be used to heuristically decide if two names reference the same person\n\nFor the purposes outlined above, i. e. formatting of names on citations, both extreme cases would still work flawlessly: collapsing all authors of the same name into a single item, or creating separate items for every author name on every paper.\n\nSorry of I missed a previous discussion of these issues. Karl Oblique (talk)\n\n@Karl Oblique: Yes, the general plan is to replace author name string (P2093) with author (P50) statements where possible; however this does not capture how an author's name is represented as an author of a particular work which is the question here, and why at least in some cases these qualifiers unfortunately are still needed. ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nThe main assumption seems to be that LUA on English Wikipedia can't read all the authors items correctly. Oddly, it seems to work out on ruwiki and few other wikis using the same module as ruwiki. --- Jura\n\nWhat is the statement to make for example list of tallest buildings in list of tallest buildings (Q1779466) so I can list all buildings under one statement? I have asked about it but gave wrong example so I got missed answers. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nAre Wikipedia lists copied to Wikidata? --SCIdude (talk)\n\n@SCIdude: I think no but what do you mean exactly? If data here is for use by Wikipedia I can imagine it could be used for tables across all Wikipedia versions. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nNo. If you have a Wikipedia list article, the articles listed should each have a Wikidata item with the same P31 value. So use the query to get all items. Second, your question: why not make Wikipedia lists by bot from Wikidata list? No one makes and maintains Wikidata lists, because the items will have P31/P279 and you just query for them to get a list. Finally, one could have the idea e.g. to make a Wikipedia list by using a Wikidata query, the problem is that in most cases there will be much more Wikidata items than Wikipedia articles, so most of the links in the Wikipedia list will be red. However, it is possible to show only those with article. --SCIdude (talk)\n\nAs to the original question, try:\n\nI think sometimes qualifiers for statements can be repeat as statements. For example you can use country (P17) as statement and as qualifier for other statement in one item. So sometimes I don't know if I should use something as statement or qualifier. Is it correct? Eurohunter (talk)\n\nDepends on the statement. No way you can generalize it. --SCIdude (talk)\n\n@SCIdude: So what if we have country (P17) for statement then there is statement for product certification (P1389) and country (P17) as qualifier. I know it's not the best example because in this case it can be used to distinguish product certification (P1389) between countries but for sure there are other examples where it looks like repeated and it is probably performer (P175) if we use it as qualifier for instance of (P31). Eurohunter (talk)\n\nProbably a controversial proposal but anyone have thoughts on requiring all statements added through QS/similar batch tools to have references? Looking through the recent history it's clear that these changes could all have references but the user just opted not to do it. A few examples: [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. Alternative similar ideas would be to apply this restriction only to larger batches or to make users click through a scary warning if they aren't adding references.\n\nI recognize this might sometimes produce redundant or obvious references but that is far better than having no idea if you can trust a statement and shouldn't be hard to do.\n\nBrokenSegue (talk)\n\nLabels cannot get references... So... I'd be against that idea (good faith idea, by other ways). Another problem, if you would batch copy country (P17)=France all coordinates that are obviously objects whose coords are well inside France, how would you do that if you were to require a reference? --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\ninferred from (P3452)geographic coordinate (Q104224919) ? That being said, I think that example needs references more than most of BrokenSegue's examples, because you could plausibly run into a scenario where you find out that the coordinates are wrong and you need to know whether that makes the country invalid as well.\n\nThat being said, instance of (P31) and external identifiers are often self-sourcing, unless you're doing something weird (either having some really specific non-obvious type for the item or using some sort of heuristics or cross-referencing for the identifier). In those cases, the source of the information is pretty much irrelevant, and adding references really only serves to juice the reference statistics without helping data consumers. Vahurzpu (talk)\n\nI like the idea of encouraging references in batch jobs, but I am also nervous about the strong version of this proposal. Perhaps start with properties that have a citation-needed constraint (Q54554025)[9]. I often feel that we could use better tools to validate QS batches. How about some sort of QS Lint that previews the violations that will be reported by the existing error checking? Bovlb (talk)\n\n@Bovlb: My guess is that such a linter would be much harder to implement than a blanket restriction and implementation effort is an important consideration. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nCC @Amir Sarabadani (WMDE), Lucas Werkmeister (WMDE). Bovlb (talk)\n\n@Bouzinac: Labels/descriptions are not statements (I think) so would be exempt here. And yeah your example should have a reference for sure and is a good example why we should have this rule. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\n@Vahurzpu: I think unless you are creating the item then the instance of (P31) is not self-sourcing. It's probably sourced from wikipedia or some external identifier or from the label. Even if you are creating the item it should be easy to find a source that, say, Florida Dental Association (Q5461307) is an organization (though maybe it's pointless). As for external identifiers I think you either imported from that external-DB (so just say it was stated in that DB) or you joined from one DB to another (so say its from the first DB). I would be ok exempting new item creation from this rule though. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nIt's difficult enough as it is to keep wikidata synched with article creation on language wikipedias. Adding a new hurdle for that process will not be helpful. A rule which acts as a perverse incentive - e.g. to add less than useful references merely to make progress - also not helpful. Bottom line is that unreferenced statements are what they are: unreferenced, and therefore less complete & trustworthy than well-referenced statements. Users can decide for themselves whether to use/trust unreferenced statements. References are lovely but so is the completeness of wikidata sitelinks to WPs. Why exactly should the latter suffer because of your particular interest in the former. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\n@Tagishsimon: I'm sympathetic to the concern that this would burden users but your example seems particularly non-problematic. If you are syncing wikipedia to wikidata the reference often just says \"imported from wikipedia\". It's really easy. I agree people adding bad references is a risk. But for large batch people edits should be able to succinctly express how the statements were arrived at with minimal effort. I don't see how this proposal would hurt \"completeness of wikidata sitelinks to WPs\" since sitelinks are unreferenced. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nI looked at some of the batches you mentioned above and their main source seems to be a Wikipedia import. For these, merely adding \"imported from\" can be interesting, but in general isn't much help. Also, [10] had some problems references wont solve.\n\nFor batches adding P31, not sure if references help much: if P31 needs a reference, one is probably using the wrong value or the item has some basic problems. --- Jura\n\n@Jura1: yeah the batches I picked weren't the best they were just the arbitrarily chosen recent batches that didn't have references. I could be convinced P31 doesn't need a reference but I do think \"imported from\" is much better than nothing (especially if it's paired with a date). I also would hope some bad batch jobs wouldn't be run at all because of the difficulty in making a reference. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nAny reason that this url formatter doesn't seem to be working ? Property:P9505#P1630. Jheald (talk)\n\n@Jheald: Works now. For some reason there's a delay of some number of hours before url formatters take effect in the UI. You may have to purge items that don't show the link yet. ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nI'm working on a library for parsing JSON of Wikidata Entities into a more native format in a strongly typed language (OCaml). Because this language is strongly typed, any fields that are sometimes null have to explicitly be marked as only optionally containing data; when accessing this data using my library, people will have to explicitly deal with the case that no data is present before the code will compile. I've read through the Wikibase JSON Format Documentation a number of times but I keep getting tripped up by fields being nullable that I thought weren't. For example, the property coordinate location (P625) of St John's College (Q691283) is a globe-coordinate with a null precision, but precision wasn't listed as being optional in the documentation. Is there any canonical list of fields that are nullable? I would just mark everything as being optional except that makes it really annoying to work with my library, especially considering there are many fields that are almost certainly never null (like the text field of monolingualtext). --ImpossiblyNew (talk)\n\nWikidata:Contact_the_development_team might be the better place for question about Wikibase documentation.\n\nA possible explanation for your sample [11] might be that it was added years ago and, while the format evolved, not all data on Wikidata was updated to match that. --- Jura\n\nThanks! Will do --- ImpossiblyNew (talk)\n\nIs there any way to copying references between items? Eurohunter (talk)\n\n@Eurohunter: Preferences > Gadgets > enable DuplicateReferences Vahurzpu (talk)\n\n@Vahurzpu: Yes but this tool moving reference just from one statement to another in one item and I need to copy references from one item to other items. Eurohunter (talk)\n\nI now realize that I misread your question. I don't know of tool that does this, but maybe someone else does. There's always the option of creating an item for the reference and linking it with stated in (P248), assuming that makes sense for the reference in question. Vahurzpu (talk)\n\nTo my knowledge there is no simple way, which is another glaring reason most statements aren't referenced. When a reference doesn't exist as a fully self-contained item (and I don't believe every citation warrants a dedicated item down to page number), I use MoveClaims tool (User:Matěj Suchánek/moveClaim.js) to copy a referenced statement to the target item (even if it has no relevance beyond the shared reference), then modify the statement and/or reference as needed. -Animalparty (talk)\n\nThere are many instances of ethnic group (Q41710) that are essentially combinations of two distinct places, regions or countries. For example Taiwanese Canadians (Q7676603), Hong Kong Canadian (Q5894321), Canadian Americans (Q5029681), or Scottish Americans (Q3476361). In each case people came from one place to another and their place of origin gave them (and sometimes their ancestors) a distinct ethnic identity in the new place. I would like to find a good and consistent way of indicating for these ethnic groups both the current place of residence and the place of origin. And then for example I would like to be able to use Taiwan (Q865) -> Canada (Q16) to look up Taiwanese Canadians (Q7676603). How might I be able to indicate this? I see country of origin (P495) but this doesn't seem to like being applied to an ethnic group. It may also not be flexible enough to include diaspora communities that aren't from countries (e.g. Tibetan Canadians (Q7800410) or African Americans (Q49085) where neither Tibet nor Africa are countries). Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Nate Wessel (talk)\n\nWhy exactly does country of origin (P495) \"[not] seem to like being applied to an ethnic group\"? At first blush you shouldn't be getting error messages since ethnic minority group (Q2531956) is one of the values explicitly allowed to an item with the property, and the allowed targets seem flexible enough (Tibet (Q17252) is a valid one, as is Africa (Q15)). Circeus (talk)\n\nI'm not sure. I see a warning on the country of origin (P495) statement that I added to Taiwanese Canadians (Q7676603). And also to the one I just tried adding to African Americans (Q49085). \"Entities using the country of origin property should be instances or subclasses of one of the following classes (or of one of their subclasses), but Taiwanese Canadians currently isn't: Product... \". Nate Wessel (talk)\n\nActually, I think indigenous to (P2341) may be exactly what I've been looking for. Nate Wessel (talk)\n\nI just encountered a problem at Bob Herman (Q106690802) that I've come across several times now. The individual's name is Robert Dunton Herman. We have Dunton (Q37503615) as a family name, but Dunton isn't really a given name. However, our normal way to mark middle names is to put them as a given name with qualifier series ordinal = 2. When I try to do this, it gives me a exclamation mark error, complaining that I'm using a family name as a given name. How should we resolve this? It doesn't seem right to create an entry for \"Dunton\" as a given name, since it's not. It also wouldn't be good to set given name (P735) to accept family names, though, as that would lead to a lot of errors. And entering the data as Given name = Robert, Family name = Dunton (ordinal 1), Herman (ordinal 2) wouldn't be right, either, as that'd make it seem like he has a two-word last name. {{u|Sdkb}} talk\n\nEspecially in the English naming tradition, which is widely used in places such as Ireland, Canada, Australia, and the United States, people are allowed to give almost any given name to their children they please. Later, adults are free to change their given name to almost any names they please. So if some parents gave their child the first given name \"Robert\" and second given name \"Dunton\", then both of those are first names, even though some of Robert's ancestors may have used \"Dunton\" as a family name. These exclamation point errors are constraint violations. Constraints are not right rules; they are merely hints that the value might not be correct. It is often necessary to ignore them. Jc3s5h (talk)\n\nI think you need more detail to know if its a family name or not. Does one of his parents have surname \"Dunton\"? If so, I'd say he has two family names. Ghouston (talk)\n\nAccording to Prabook, it's the maiden name of his mother, so I'd say it's a family name, like any double-barrelled surname. Ghouston (talk)\n\nThe solution was to create a QID for \"Dunton\" as a given name, even if it is unique to this person. That is how we handle someone with a given name that was a family name of a maternal ancestor. The most famous example is \"Johns Hopkins\". --RAN (talk)\n\nI recently discovered that the name 'Coenagrion exornatum' (Selys, 1872) was removed from the World Odonata List. It didn't take me very long to find out why: the name appeared not to represent an accepted species, but was a misprint for Coenagrion ecornutum (Selys, 1872). The 'name' first appeared in 1890 in the paper in which Kirby created the genus Coenagrion. After that, it started to live a life of its own, popping up in databases next to Coenagrion ecornutum as if they were both names for accepted species. At the latest in 2010 it was noted that the name was only a misprint, when Jin Whoa Yum et al. commented on the name. Here one can find a pdf of their paper, the statement is on p. 45. 'Names' of this type attract the attention of taxonomists because they lack everything an available name has: there is no nomenclatural type associated with it, there is no bibliographic reference to a protologue, and if there is one, the name can't be found there; there are no distribution data, in general there is nothing that indicates that a species with this name actually exists.\n\nI tried to get rid of this piece of disinformation in Wikimedia by asking for speedy deletion in the projects that have an article with this name, giving the arguments of course. In some cases the article was indeed deleted, but on the Polish Wikipedia, they changed the name into a redirect, as if this ghost name were a synonym. I also tried to make clear in the Wikidata item that this is not the name of an accepted species but a misprinted name. I changed the authority from (Selys, 1872) into Kirby, 1890 because that's the place where the name first popped up. And I tried to add the above mentioned pdf as a reference for all of this. That however, appeared one step too far for me.\n\nAs this is only one example of literally hundreds of thousands of cases, and I guess it's important to take appropriate action if an article or an item suggesting it is the name for an accepted taxon appears to be disinformation, I'd like some advice on how to best tackle this in Wikidata. Most important: how to give a reference to a paper or other scientific work if the author of that reference is not recognized by Wikidata, and hence the reference refused, but there is a pdf or other source available online. 77.164.133.132\n\nThis is a prime example of the schizophrenic way Wikidata approaches taxonomenclature. It would be just fine if wikidata could handle names that do not correspond to accepted taxa (not just misspellings, but also things like replaced homonyms and other objective/homotypic synonyms), but Wikidata is incapable of doing so in any meaningful way without causing a huge amount of warnings. I gave up work in that area entirely a while ago because of that. Circeus (talk)\n\nIt is not clear from what you write where your problem is. You write \"I tried to add the above mentioned pdf as a reference for all of this\": it is not forbidden to give an URL to a PDF as a reference to a statement so why did you not succeed? Also which statements did you try to add, please point us to these. --SCIdude (talk)\n\nFirst of all: thanks for answering. The most practical problem is this. In the statement 'taxon name' (it is of course not a taxon, it is a misprinted name, but more on that later), under 'reference', I tried to add a link to the pdf of the paper of Jin Whoa Yum et al. (2010), because in that paper (p. 45) that claim is made: \"Coenagrion exornatum [misprint] (Selys): Kirby, 1890: Syn. Cat. Neur.-Odon., London: 150\" (and as soon as one has that hint, one can look up Kirby's paper and compare with Selys's publication, and realize Yum et al. are right). I was unable to create that reference, probably because of my inexperience with adding references in Wikidata.\n\nThe other problem is that I have no idea how to cope with a 'taxon name' that in fact is no name at all. It should be possible to have an item for the misprinted name 'Coenagrion exornatum', but without all the claims that it is a taxon or a taxon name. The only useful knowledge about that name is that Kirby made an error when he meant to refer to Coenagrion ecornutum. Nothing more, nothing less. But because 'Coenagrion exornatum' has the form of a taxon name, it seems that there are all kinds of mechanisms that want to have it taken up as the name of (in this instance) a species. With the risk that sooner or later it pops up as a direct child of Coenagrion, as it did before; it was even often listed next to Coenagrion ecornutum as if both names represented accepted species. And then all the work that contributors (i.c. I) have done to sort this out will have been in vain. 77.164.133.132\n\nlisted historical resource (Q15203884) is heritage designation by the city of Winnipeg, Canada. Buildings added to the Winnipeg List of Historical Resources (Q106714820) up to 2014 have a classification of grade I, II, or III, which affects their level of protection, but items added since do not (or they have grade “N/A”). It is important to record this, but I’d rather not create three or four new designations to capture this, but rather keep listed status in one place and add a qualifier. Is there an existing property or qualifier suitable for this? —Michael Z.\n\nYou could qualify statements like Q7885387#Q7885387$6e117367-4e14-d5e6-a7b5-78fe4a978942 with criterion used (P1013)? --- Jura\n\nThe general criteria used to determine designations and grades are separately listed here, but the specific criteria for each designated property are not listed explicitly (maybe some can be inferred from each property’s report). So that’s not quite right, but that property led me to subject has role (P2868), which sorta kinda works if I create four items representing the “roles” Grade I, II, III, and N/A. Does this make sense?\n\nThe alternative is to add three or four subclasses (“N/A” could be added to explicitly contrast with “no data,” and the encompassing superclass ideally becomes empty).\n\nWhich approach is better? My instinct is to have a binary quality of designated or not, and add the grade as a qualifier only, but the implementation is feeling like a kludge. It would feel odd if this municipal designation were more complicated than the provincial and federal ones, but maybe it just is what it is. I guess subclasses is more natural in Wikidata and allows the most fine-grained application of data in the long run.\n\nI want to decide on this modelling before I start adding a lot of items and statements. —Michael Z.\n\nI'm not involved in heritage description so I do not understand why criterion used (P1013) with one of four items named like \"Winnipeg List of Historical Resources classification grade I\" is wrong, because it sounds fine to me. Can you please explain? --SCIdude (talk)\n\nCriteria are the standards or basis for an evaluation, and its result may be a designation (with or without a grade). This is the normal general meaning, and also used specifically by the city of Winnipeg: “Heritage Values are the architectural & historic significance of a resource and are based on the following criteria: AGE - Its importance in illustrating or interpreting the history of the city or a neighbourhood; PERSON . . . CONTEXT . . . STYLE . . . LOCATION . . . INTACTNESS.” Source(expand “learn more”). —Michael Z.\n\nIt's not very clear, your personal preference aside, why you are not following the established pattern seen, for instance, for England and Wales with Grade I listed building (Q15700818), Grade II listed building (Q15700834) &c and for Scotland, category A listed building (Q10729054), category B listed building (Q10729125) &c, all used as main heritage designation (P1435) values. This report provides counts of use. Were you to persist with using a qualifier, object has role (P3831) would be more appropriate than subject has role (P2868) IMO. criterion used (P1013) is useful when modelling the criteria used for something. Here the various grades are not in themselves a criteria, but rather the result once criteria have been applied. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nBecause I was not aware of those. Thank you. —Michael Z.\n\nWhat's the best way to add sex or gender (P21) = male (Q6581097) to the item?\n\nOnce added, we will have to set rank to deprecated, but that's another question. --- Jura\n\nShe liked to wear men's clothes but in what sense could she be regarded as \"male\"? — Martin (MSGJ · talk)\n\nI had mostly in mind facts Wikidata knows about, i.e. authorship under pseudonym. --- Jura\n\nHow long does it take for a wikidata item to be indexed by a search engine? Or is that up to the people who run the search engine? CanadianOtaku Talk Page\n\nthat is up to the search engine people. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nYou can run a test yourself, create a new QID and search in Google for it every day. Generally it takes about 30 days for new items in Wikidata to be indexed. The 30 days window gives us a chance to weed out fake entries. --RAN (talk)\n\nCurrently there is Wikidata:Property_proposal/English_Everipedia_ID open for discussion. I'm not really sure what to think of it.\n\nw:Everipedia#Content_and_users notes \"as of May 2019, most or all Everipedia articles originating as Wikipedia articles, including those never edited on Everipedia, had not had updated Wikipedia content applied since 2016\". I wonder if it's that site where I occasionally end up when looking for articles deleted from enwiki.\n\nAnyways, I think the discussion could use more input. In the meantime, samples mostly pointing to copies of Wikipedia have been removed. --- Jura\n\nI think Everipedia is a terrible idea, and no one should associate with it. -Animalparty (talk)\n\nHi, following a tense discussion with someone anti-Wikidata from enwiki, I wonder if there is possibility for an enwiki user, watching [Article X] on enwiki, to see if something has changed in its Wikidata item [on the enwiki watchlist] ?--Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nJust discovered that parameter in the langwiki watchlist filters . --Bouzinac 💬●✒️●💛\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: --- Jura\n\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-4769-4383 2401:4900:4638:BB7C:C441:26E4:B983:820B\n\nAnswered at WD:AN. Bovlb (talk)\n\nI think that this discussion is resolved and can be archived. If you disagree, don't hesitate to replace this template with your comment. Bovlb (talk)\n\nI have a question on how to link to journals with the ZDB and GND. I have Nature Methods (Q680640) which is recorded in these two datasets:\n\nhttps://zdb-katalog.de/title.xhtml?idn=026529807\n\nhttp://d-nb.info/026529807\n\nHowever I do not find a property for which identifier \"026529807\" works. Instead, there is ZDB ID (P1042) which has identifier 2163081-1 and using the formater URL creates the following link http://ld.zdb-services.de/resource/2163081-1 which redirects to https://zdb-katalog.de/title.xhtml?idn=026529807 . So it seems to me that identifier \"026529807\" is preferred across GND and ZDB but I cannot link to it from Wikidata while the ZDB ID (P1042) identifier \"2163081-1\", to which we can link, seems to be redirected to the other identifier. Can someone explain what is going on and whether one identifier should be preferred over the other? Is there a property with a formater URL which works for \"026529807\"? I am just confused here. --Hannes Röst (talk)\n\nThis seems quite mysterious. Google doesn't find anything other than this conversation linking 026529807 with an \"IDN\" identifier. Do you have any contacts at ZDB who could explain what IDN means? ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nIt’s beyond complicated. GNDs also have IDNs, which are called PPNs (Pica-​Produktions-Nummer) in other contexts. They are causing all sorts of troubles because sometimes you can only use the GND, sometimes only IDN/PPN, sometimes both and sometimes none, depending on the catalogue a library is using. I never really figured out the logic behind that, maybe @Kolja21, Wurgl, Raymond, Unukorno, Silewe: can help? --Emu (talk)\n\nLike explained here \"d-nb.info\" are links for single editions. For ID 026529807 use DNB edition ID (P1292). --Kolja21 (talk)\n\nPS: IDN = Identifikationsnummer. Explication in German. --Kolja21 (talk)\n\nIn short: If the link starts with d-nb.info/gnd/ it is a GND-Number. If there is no /gnd/ in the link, it is that IDN/PPN. Another hint: GNDs do never start with a zero. --Wurgl (talk)\n\nSo should we propose a new property for the IDN, or is it already covered somehow? ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\nIn deWP, we use the ISSN for magazines, as you can see in the Infobox of de:Nature Methods --Wurgl (talk)\n\nIt seems that the ISSN links also into the ZDB, but then what are the circumstances where we would need ZDB ID (P1042), is that if there is no ISSN? Also it seems that the ISSN search reveals two results: [12] and [13] so its unclear how to handle that, should we link both ZDB links? --Hannes Röst (talk)\n\nHello colleagues,\n\nDue to global trends about user data collection and use, the Wikimedia Foundation will be masking IPs to protect editors' privacy but would also be building tools to ensure we are able to continue fighting vandalism and other abuse in the absence of IP addresses.

I was wondering whether someone with more knowledge about Wikidata than I could update Ancient History Encyclopedia (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9000)? The publication recently rebranded to World History Encyclopedia, and all links should now point to https://www.worldhistory.org/$1 instead of https://www.ancient.eu/$1. Is it possible to change the name and URL accordingly? Thanks!\n\nshould be done. thanks for the tip. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nIs there actually a way how you can make the KrBot2 that it should please refresh the page Wikidata:Database reports/Constraint violations/P2991 again? --Gymnicus (talk)\n\nNo. KrBot2 updates are a pretty heavy operation. The bot operator processes an offline dump to update these reports every couple of days. —MisterSynergy (talk)\n\n@MisterSynergy: Interestingly, the KrBot updated the page right now. How did it come about now? --Gymnicus (talk)\n\nWell, that's unusual. Maybe you got a special treat by the operator? Usually KrBot2 makes these updates, not KrBot. —MisterSynergy (talk)\n\nI started update procedure manually. This can be done for small reports (less than ~2000 items). Direct access to Wikidata is used in this case. This makes many requests to Wikidata engine, so it can not be used in regular basis unfortunately. — Ivan A. Krestinin (talk)\n\nFor some of the constraints, there is the option to run the queries on property talk pages. This should give the same or similar results. --- Jura\n\nToday I was looking at wikidata item Mag ik dan bij jou (Q19696999). This item descibes a beautiful song of the dutch performer Claudia de Breij. It is labeled as instance of single (Q134556), in my opninion it should be labeled as musical work (Q2188189). A single is descibed as \"type of music release usually containing one or two tracks\". Musical work is described as \"musical work of art\" or \"piece of music\" My interpretation: a single is something you put on your record player. The musical work is the song itself, the creative work.\n\nWhat do you think? JohnBoers (talk)\n\nIn my experience the modelling of musical works in Wikidata is highly inconsistent/undocumented. Wikidata:WikiProject_Music lays out some intended modelling, but it isn't currently widely followed/enforced in practice. There's also some confusion I've ran into (archived discussion here) in the past around the modelling of the fundamental items, see musical work (Q2188189) vs composed musical work (Q207628). --SilentSpike (talk)\n\n@JohnBoers: You are right with your interpretation. It seems that the title may refer to both: a single (as indicated in the Dutch Wikipedia infobox) and a song (as indicated in the description). The best way would be to split the item into one item for the song (with music brainz work id) and one item for the single. You may look at Wikidata:WikiProject_Music#Composition_properties/Wikidata:WikiProject_Music#Release_properties or (for instance) Boys Don't Cry (Q1823033)/Boys Don't Cry (Q62054656) as a reference. Also pinging @Moebeus: - in case I forgot something. - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk)\n\n@JohnBoers: There should be separate item for single, song and each release version of single so German CD single etc. See Angels Ain't Listening (Q91933505), Angels Ain't Listening (Q93373704) and Angels Ain't Listening (Q96000540). Eurohunter (talk)\n\nHello!\n\nI recently noticed there are four entries for the same public library in Findlay Ohio and looked into merging them.\n\nQ69961220\n\nQ69961218\n\nQ69487490\n\nQ30289487 - Notably uses the full name instead of an abbreviation. Unsure if this should be merged with the others or not due to slight differences (I'm 99% sure that on the ground, these are one and the same, but maybe there's some library nuance I'm missing?)\n\nHowever I got an error when I tried to use the merge tool, and noticed that these items refer to themselves anyway, so I figured I would ask a more experienced user first so I didn't mess anything up.\n\nThank you for your time! Mbrickn (talk)\n\nThe labels & descriptions used for the first three were arguably suboptimal, but the P31 property specify they are, respectively, a bookmobile, a main library and a library network - all imported from the same source, the Public Libraries Survey 2017. They are not duplicates. The fourth (described variously as an archive organization / cultural instituton) might be a duplicate (of the main library or the network), but might equally be a discrete sub-entity worthy of an item. For now I've made it part of the network, which precludes it being merged. I think there's little more to do here, sadly. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\n@Mbrickn, Tagishsimon: Sadly thousands of libraries were imported from that data source without a much diligence to see if there was an existing entry in Wikidata. I've had to merge dozens of these in the past. In this case I merged Findlay-Hancock County Public Library (Q30289487) with the \"library network\", which is the top-level organization that the associated identifiers and website point to - also fixed the name to match what is on the library website. ArthurPSmith (talk)\n\n@Alicia Fagerving (WMSE): fyi --- Jura\n\nThank you for your explanation and assistance! ---Mbrickn (talk)\n\nIt seems that for ballot initiative winner (P1346) is used to indicate vote outcome. See for example https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21812812#P1346, however it seems that winner (P1346) was not designed for this and indicates the winner of a competition, an awardee etc. Is there a better property or would it make sense to extend the definition of winner (P1346) to include ballot initiatives? I think the English (winner) and German definition (Sieger) dont make a ton of sense in the context of ballot initiatives. --Hannes Röst (talk)\n\nThis might be a somewhat fussy/low-priority task, but it's always irked me a bit that we describe the cost of something as \"47 United States dollar\" or the height as \"47 foot\" or the area as \"47 acre\". We do have lexemes that seem to record the plural forms of these units, e.g. acre (L15846); would it be hard to get those connected so that plural units are displayed properly as plural? {{u|Sdkb}} talk\n\nAs far as I'm aware, in English and Dutch we do not use plural in these constructions. For other languages I do not know, but the English examples you give here are syntaxically correct to me. Edoderoo (talk)\n\nWe'd say \"the cost is 47 dollars\" or \"the campus is 48 acres\", not \"the cost is 47 dollar\" or \"the campus is 47 acre\". {{u|Sdkb}} talk\n\nThe way units are used depends on the language. For instance, \"three metres\" in German is \"drei Meter\", using the singular form. It would be a nice project to develop a tool which renders grammatically correct quantity expressions for various languages using lexemes. Toni 001 (talk)\n\nWikidata is mainly for machine. Grammar no matter. Machine read data, third party user modify format as user want. All good. -Animalparty (talk)\n\nfrwiki has a module that renders this correctly for French. --- Jura\n\nwhen i try to add commonswiki site link on Linda McCartney (Q228899), it says interwiki conflict with Category:Linda McCartney (Q8591290). earlier i raised similar question on interwiki conflicts chat. however, i request you to suggest best way to resolve this issue. Gi vi an (talk)\n\n@Gi vi an: A short answer is \"no\". We usually keep distinct items for concepts and their Wikimedia categories. Vojtěch Dostál (talk)\n\nYou can try to merge the two with the merge gadget. The resulting error message should explain it too. --- Jura\n\nHi! I am a Wikipedian and an undergrad database management student and was wondering if someone could recommend a Wikidata- or Wikipedia-related research topic I could pursue for my coursework.

Datumizer (talk)\n\nGoogle Scholar with \"Wikidata\" gives 3k hits, not enough? --SCIdude (talk)\n\nI can't find any modern discussion of the idea of importing data from dbpedia (and also yago). There's some really old and extremely old RFCs but nothing in the last few years that I can find.

Would a Bot RFP for some property be a good place to start? Are there suggestions\n\nBrokenSegue (talk)\n\nEssentially, it's data from Wikipedia and its infoboxes. dbpedia's parsing is more advanced than that of Harvesttemplates and a few other tools. Accordingly, I think similar prudence is advised. Harvesttemplates generally works well in fairly focused imports. --- Jura\n\nLogic follows another path; as the dbpedia's parcing is more advanced that of our own tools, given that it freely available we will improve our quality by making use of Dbpedia. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nTime to seriously investigate if WD or WP is more up-to-date? --SCIdude (talk)\n\nAlmost certainly WP for anything that can't be automatically kept up to date which is where we have an edge. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nYou are forgetting one major detail. DBpedia consolidates what is available in Wikipedias, Wikipedia is one project at a time. Thanks, GerardM (talk)\n\nThe data quality isn't extremely good. Might be good enough to import some data to item here that are nearly empty, but please don't import any data to mature items. Tools like https://item-quality-evaluator.toolforge.org/ and recoin can help you evaluate the quality of the item. Multichill (talk)\n\n@Multichill: do you know if there's a way to query that tool to find the low quality items? BrokenSegue (talk)\n\n@BrokenSegue: number of statements give an indication, see for example https://w.wiki/3KdQ . Not sure if and how ORES is exposed in the API otherwise what might be usable in combination with a SPARQL query. I recall having conversations about maturity of items before, but I'm not sure if we ever wrote it down. Might be useful to document with some pointers for reference for future tools and/or bots. Multichill (talk)\n\nNot sure how ORES would help you with this.\n\nI think the main problem could be instance of (P31). Wikipedia articles can have infoboxes on several aspects and they might all end up on the same dbpedia page. --- Jura\n\nThis item seems to conflate (1) lists of justices of the Supreme Court of Canada in various wikipedias; and (2) the position of justice of the Supreme Court of Canada—that is, a value of position held (P39). To de-conflate, I was thinking I'd repurpose this item to correspond solely to meaning/use (2) (to avoid having to rejigger all the items that link to it in that role) and create a new item corresponding to meaning/use (1). Does that sound reasonable, or is there something else we should do in this kind of scenario? AleatoryPonderings (talk)\n\nThat's a good plan. Lots of P39 uses of the item. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nHi, I'd like to list all given name (Q202444) starting with the letter P (Q9946) (in alphabetical order). Can someone tell me how to do this? --Bruder Vio (talk)\n\nHere's a query for items that are Q202444 (https://w.wiki/3KcM), and here's one that includes all subclasses of given name (https://w.wiki/3KcP).\n\nI hope that gives you what you were looking for. If not, you can adjust the query by going to the toolbar to the right of the results and clicking \"Edit SPARQL\".

Utfor (talk)\n\n\"removing all decriptions because of conflicts\" isn't a thing. You wasted your time. I've merged the two items; not sure what the anti-abuse issue was about. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nWhat function did you use? --- Jura\n\nWhile working on Enbridge (Q1339966), I noticed that Central Index Key (P5531) threw an error when I put in the (apparently) correct value of 895728 for this company. I suspect the error has something to do with the fact that Enbridge is a foreign private issuer according to the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (Q953944). Is there something to fix here? AleatoryPonderings (talk)\n\nSeems to require zero-padding. Bots can fix that. --- Jura\n\nIn so far as the link - https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=895728 - works, the possibility is that WD's insistence on 10 digits is incorrect? --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nPossible, but that would mean Wikipedia's description is incorrect too: see \"The numbers are ten digits in length.\" at w:Central_Index_Key.\n\nThat a partial key can be used to link one database doesn't mean it's correct.--- Jura\n\nIn so far as EDGAR specifies that the CIK: for ENBRIDGE INC is \"895728\" (expand the 'Company Information' header - https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=895728), we can conclude that w:Central_Index_Key is making it up as it's going along, and our padding is a cargo cult. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nFeel free to \"sofixit\" ;) --- Jura\n\nZero-padding fixed it. Good to know for next time. AleatoryPonderings (talk)\n\nI added an autofix at [15]. It takes a few days till a bot fixes them. --- Jura\n\nI don't know a better place to ask for, so I'm asking here: Would it be useful to check the Do not merge pages for expired DNM's (i.e. merged or deleted items) and remove those? I don't know if it is worth the time and/or storagespace to clean up expired sets. I think a bot should be able to do such task relatively quick. Q.Zanden questions?\n\nIn my opinion all do not merge pages should be deprecated in favor of different from (P1889).--GZWDer (talk)\n\nI don't really know what they are used for (beyond the bots mentioned there), but having the information (also) as statement does sound useful. --- Jura\n\nHi all\n\nI would really love a tool that worked a bit like the 'Cite' on Wikipedia, that can tell you if there's already an item for an publication with an ISBN and if not it goes to get the data to make a new one. The process of using it would be something like:\n\nUser enters an ISBN on a page and it says if there is an item on Wikidata which has this ISBN\n\nIf there is already an item which uses this ISBN the tool suggests extra statements to add that the user just clicks to add them. The tool gets the data from the same place the Cite tool on Wikipedia does.\n\nIf there isn't already an item using this ISBN, the tool prefills a form for the new item which the user click to create. It then looks for any item on Wikidata with the same name and author to find other editions and then connects them together using which ever statement is needed.\n\nIs this possible/realistic? Would be a really nice thing to have. I'm sure there could also be an option to enter multiple ISBNs but I don't know what's the best layout for that.\n\nAlso how could I propose this as a project for the Wikimedia Hackathon? I don't know if there's a category for ideas from non programmers? Should I write it up as a phabricator task and add some tags?\n\nThanks\n\n--John Cummings (talk)\n\nThere was plan to add Citoid support on Wikidata (phab:T199197), and a working version has already existed on https://test.wikidata.org/ for quite a while, but it seems the deployment was somehow stalled. --Stevenliuyi (talk)\n\nThanks Stevenliuyi, I've asked what the issue is. --John Cummings (talk)\n\nThis would be amazing. It absolutely boggles my mind that the powers-that-be of Wikdiata haven't recognized that one of the solutions to the problem of millions of unreferenced statements is making references easier to generate and add. -Animalparty (talk)\n\nGlad you like it Animalparty, if you could add your support to the phabricator task that would help.

BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nThanks. Tagging user:*Treker, who was planning to propose a property. citizenship (Q42138) may be a good model for this.\n\nFor general info, a Canadian First Nation, a First Nation band (Q2882257), is not an ethnic group or sub-group. Some have only dozens of residents. Some have multiple Indian reservation of Canada (Q155239) associated with them, and also traditional lands beyond their boundaries. Membership in a First Nation is separate from residence there: one can have either or both. Most, but not all members are registered under the Indian Act (Indian Register (Q2095049)). Inuit and Métis people do not have this arrangement. (I am no expert; just sharing the basics I’m aware of.) —Michael Z.\n\n@Mzajac: I am still planning on proposing a tribe propery (and maybe two separate properties for federally recognized tribes of the US and First Nation bands of Canada), but I want to a really good job of it and since I'm a bit sick right now I will likey wait until I have the energy in a few days. I think it's absolutely a thing that's needed for Wikidata.*Treker (talk)\n\nThank you. I don’t know much about US tribes, but it would be beneficial if a generalized property could work for membership in Indigenous groups everywhere, and perhaps specific subclasses added if and when necessary – otherwise this exercise will just be repeated again and again. Recently Canadian First Nations have been establishing that they legally exist beyond the borders of Canada.[16] There are also Indigenous peoples in hundreds of countries in Oceana, Australia and New Zealand, Lapland, Crimea, the Philippines, etc. —Michael Z.\n\nThere is some info from WikiDataCon 2019 on this, for example Smallison's talk and the subsequent [17]. I can't find the info for the user group for some reason. There are also a number of Wikiprojects that should be brought into ths convo: WikiProject Indigenous peoples of North America, Canadian Aboriginal Languages Wikipedia Coordination, Indigenous Languages and Knowledge on Wikimedia Projects Toolbox, etc. Dropping us a line at the Inari Saami or the Northern Saami wikipedia would be much appreciated so we can participate in the convo. Pinging Amqui too. -Yupik (talk)\n\nI have been excluding \"sex or gender\" from items I create for humans intentionally when I do not know the gender identity of the person. A bot by Jura has been going through and adding given names to items for people whose labels match the label for a given name. Often, these are defined as \"male given name\" or \"female given name\". While the descriptions of these names qualify them as \"usually\" meant for male or female people and seems benign enough, the statements \"subclass of\" \"given name\" \"of\" \"female human\" or \"male human\" allows the person's sex or gender to be inferred, potentially incorrectly. Once these statements have been made, another bot by Lockal comes through and adds a sex or gender statement which may or may not be accurate. Here is an example. It is likely that most of the statements both bots generate are correct (it was correct in this example). However, I also think the situation of both these bots working simultaneously is heavily biased towards cisgendered people, especially those in cultures where unisex names are commonplace. In this example, I do not know the person's gender identity and the statements the bots have made could have misgendered this person. I did some poking around on Wikidata to see if this is a major discussion somewhere and couldn't find anything besides some specific cases where people were cleaning up misgendered items. Is there a way for a conversation to be had about these gender-assumptions we're making? Or, to weigh the pros and cons of untethering given names from gender in Wikidata? I can see how, when a person's gender is known, having a given name that reflects their gender could be cool, but that is accomplished by P21 which is widely used so I don't think the benefits outweigh the harm that could be done by misgendering people on Wikidata. --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nThese edits are definitely incomplete. They should include based on heuristic (P887) inferred from person's given name (Q69652498) as a qualifier or reference in order to track provenance of these statements. Editors can then add further evidence as it might surface in any given case, e.g. self identified sex or gender, gender-specific styles (\"Mr.\"/\"Mstr.\" vs. \"Mrs.\"/\"Miss\" or whatever). The gold standard is of course self-identification of preferred gender, but realistically that's going to be exceedingly rare for pre-20th century humans, and still uncommon afterwards.\n\nWhy identify sex or gender at all if it can't be reasonably determined? --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nThat's a very reasonable question wrt. Wikidata:Living people. Inferring plausible gender from given name is far from foolproof, given that, e.g. the gender specificity of personal names can change over time and across cultures, and exceptions can always exist. For what it's worth, the main argument for recording this sex or gender (P21) data for living people at all has been that people will want it in order to compute gender representation statistics wrt. authors, researchers etc. as well as more general statistics relating to Wikidata itself, and having Wikidata try to infer the data for reusers might be better than the alternative of everyone trying to do this in different and perhaps problematic ways. It's not clear that this should override our more general policy wrt. privacy-sensitive data as it relates to present-day humans.\n\nYeah this is bad. Are either of these bot actions approved? They aren't happening on bot accounts but if they are regular batch tasks they probably need to be approved. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nI don't know anything about the bot approval process, so I don't know. I know it happens semi-regularly. How does one find out BrokenSegue? --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nwe could look through the history of bot approvals but probably best just to ping the two people and wait for feedback. If they went through the bot approval process I would've asked them to at the least provide references which would help unwind this. @Lockal: @Jura1: BrokenSegue (talk)\n\n@BrokenSegue, Clements.UWLib:, don't understand why you call gender in these items as unsourced/unknown. James Freese is linked to materials from a member of the International Botherhood of Electrical Workers and described in a various IBEW Local 46 sources as a male. James M. Smith is linked to \"James M. Smith audio recordings and papers\", where again, he is described as a male. Also I don't do any bot works with P21, this upload was targeted to specific subset. --Lockal (talk)\n\n@Lockal: The issue isn't with any particular item it's with the general approach. Also, if this wasn't an automatic action how did you generate the subset? Did you manually vet it? The line between bot and \"large batch action\" is kinda blurry and people don't seem to agree when approval is needed. Do you regularly do this? BrokenSegue (talk)\n\n@BrokenSegue, Lockal: Right, the issue isn't necessarily with an item, it's with the approach. Lockal, would you be amenable to adding references to sex or gender (P21) claims in the future, especially those using batch processes? If you're manually vetting the batches, it should be easy to do. --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nOk, I agree. I usually add references with external identifiers, if available, and vetting the batches in various ways (there were batches deduced from pronouns, deduced from birth place, because, well, it is legally impossible to get female name in Russia if you are a male). Sorry if I bothered you, I am just a part of language culture that considers gender as a \"common knowledge\" (as with P31=Q5 - just go to any external identifier and expect to see that information). For now I have no plans to deduce gender from names, but if I get some, I'll add some extra details to make statements more clear. --17:07, 14 May 2021 (UTC)\n\n@Lockal: Thank you, this seems like a good plan/resolution to me. --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nOur bot policy says: \"Add sources to any statement that is added unless it has been agreed the data is 'common knowledge' in which case the bot should state where the information has been copied from.\" I therefore do agree that the bot shouldn't add unsourced claims. I however think based on heuristic (P887) inferred from person's given name (Q69652498) is reasonable.\n\nThe motivation for listing gender is that it's required for forming grammatically correct sentences in many languages. Wikidata exists for people from different cultures and some cultures do need gender to make statements in their languages. Just because some Anglo people don't like explicit statements about gender doesn't mean we should declare those statements generally unwelcome and prefer the cultural values of that Anglo group over others. ChristianKl ❪✉❫\n\nI agree that the main issue here is the lack of references in both edit batches. I will, again point people to my proposal at Wikidata:Project_chat/Archive/2021/05#Requiring_References_in_QS. BrokenSegue (talk)\n\n@BrokenSegue: I like the idea of requiring references for a defined subset of properties when using tools like Quickstatements, but not for all statements wholesale. That would become repetitive and burdensome really quickly. As others point out, identifiers and P31 statements are self-referencing. For the purpose you were going for, are property constraints requiring references sufficient? Since the discussion you're pointing to is archived, it seems I can't comment on it directly. --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\n@ChristianKl: I see your point about languages, but I reject the notion that all people in any culture can be crammed into a binary conception of gender. And, more to the point, I don't think it's a good practice to infer someone's gender identity based on their label alone. Could this problem be solved by adding a reference requirement to sex or gender (P21)? --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nPeople are not being crammed into a binary conception of gender; WD supports a wide array of values for P21. Whereas I understand some of the concerns expressed above, I'd favour seeing an evaluation of evidence of a problem before we reach for a solution. I note that gender is not something, for most individuals, for which easy references exist, beyond 'inferred from x', and I question the utility of that sort of reference; not least it does not solve the problem, but merely requires the user to codify the basis of their P21 evaluation; which is to say, if subjects are being misgendered, then in the future they would be misgendered with a reference. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nthe value of the reference is not that it merely exists but that it tells you how it was determined. this way someone later on can decide if some means of inference is acceptable to them. in that way providing the reference actually could weaken the impact of the statement i.e. \"oh this was just guessed from their first name\" BrokenSegue (talk)\n\nI agree with what BrokenSegue says above, and also want to point out that this issue is stemming from assumptions being made about a person's gender identity based on their given name. So, while there are a wide array of options for values of P21, the only ones I've seen get assigned based on label alone, or based on nothing at all, are \"male\" or \"female\". --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\nThis has come up every once in a while in the Wikimedia LGBT+ user group, but no solution has been found because the people doing it don't seem to consider it a problem. (There are also more people than those listed above doing this.) Perhaps they can understand that this is problematic from a legal perspective: there are countries that do not consider the gender binary relevant for various reasons, including ones where gendered languages are spoken. So IMO we should not be misgendering people based on something trivial like a first name. Moreover, it should not be included as a constraint violation in properties either, since this just makes this autogendering more appealing to get rid of the constraint violations. -Yupik (talk)\n\n@Yupik: I'm glad this issue has come up somewhere, and disheartened to hear that those doing it don't consider it a problem, when people have told them \"hey, this is a problem\". I agree with you wholeheartedly that P21 should not be included as a constraint violation. I just sent an email out to the mailing list about this, and am hoping that a productive conversation can be started in whatever the appropriate channels are. Is Project Chat the ideal place to bring these concerns? Communication channels are overwhelming in number. --Crystal Clements, University of Washington Libraries (talk)\n\ntl;dr, but I'm not sure anyone has claimed that 'it' is not a problem, for any of the values of 'it' that readers hold dear. There are a range of different interests in play, such as the reasonable insistance that all gender statements are accurate / evidenced / referenced versus the reasonable wish to be able to produce by gender stats given the scale of biog items; or the reasonable wish to get things right, from the start, versus the view that with enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow and mistakes / poor assumptions will be fixed in reasonable time. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nI noticed some items that use an incorrect property for several statements. If I wanted to fix that manually, I would need to remove all the values and add them again with the correct property. This can be a lot of work for example for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (Q9694) which uses connecting line (P81) for 21 different destinations instead of scheduled service destination (P521). Is there an easier way for that like a tool that just changes the property for all statements? --PhiH (talk)\n\n@Pasleim: Data Gamer play\n\n@PhiH: Move Claims 2 is probably what you are looking for. It adds a \"move\" button to the statement and you can copy or move the statement to another item or property. You find it in this list: Wikidata:Tools/Edit_items. - Valentina.Anitnelav (talk)\n\nThanks, that makes it a little easier. Unfortunately it's not possible to move all statements at once. --PhiH (talk)\n\nPlease see Wikidata:WikiProject every politician/European Union/Q8880/positions. In the last column there is an option (see list). I have tried to do the same to Wikidata:WikiProject every politician/Cyprus/Cyprus Goverment/positions but I wasn't able. I have already created the lists. For example, Wikidata:WikiProject every politician/Cyprus/Cyprus Goverment/positions/Q65600632. Data Gamer play\n\nFirst, both tables look completely borked, printing class='wd_p2389' into columns rather than values. I think (see list) may be provided only where there is a counterpart page in the form https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_every_politician/European_Union/officeholder/Q8882 - so, for instance, there is not such a page at https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_every_politician/European_Union/officeholder/Q651703 and so the Vice-President of the European Commission (Q651703) position gets no (see list).\n\nIt doesn't seem particularly helpful to have PositionHolderHistory lists squirreled away under the EveryPolitician subfolder, in so far as the natural place for such lists is on the talk pages of the positions. Nor do I know how such pages are created. It's possible @Teester: may be able to help, having been active in this area.\n\nI presume it is the /row page which is borking the table, but I lack the fu to work out what's going wrong. --Tagishsimon (talk)\n\nThanks. I have found the problem. It must be in the form **/officeholder/Q** .Data Gamer play\n\nHi. The user Tm insits on adding name"
