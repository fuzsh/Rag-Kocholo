        "text": "Giovanni Battista Piranesi is considered one of the most famous neoclassical print makers of the 18th century in regards to architecture. Born in 1720 near Treviso Italy, his brother introduced him to latin and the ancient world which initially sparked his interest in antiquarian subject. Not too long after this he studied as an architect under his uncle, Matteo Lucchesi, who was a Venetian engineer specializing in excavation. Moving to Rome in 1740 he then learned the art of etching and engraving under Giuseppe Vasi while collaborating with pupils of the French Academy in Rome producing a series of views of Rome. From 1748-1774 Piranesi created a long series of views entitled \"Roman Antiquities of the Time of the First Republic and the First Emperors\" establishing his fame and of which this etching has come from. He became so famous for his etchings and incredible ability to restore Roman antiquities like pots and vases he was commissioned by the Pope for specific projects and was even knighted in 1764. Although an architect by trade he was not successful thankfully providing us with the best historical visual history of Rome's ruins in the 1700's.\n\nPiranesi established himself as the greatest neoclassical print maker of the 18th century and this etching is a perfect example. While the original edition was created in 1756 this was from the later \"Regia Calcografia Edition\" (Popes Edition) identified by the emboss (lower right) reading \"Regia Calcografia Di Roma\" with the the popes mitre in the center. The condition is very fine with just slight foxing around the margin and crease on the right edge along the plate mark. Bottom left corner bent but in tack very minimal; on revers inscribed \"Piranesi\" (in pencil). Plate mark is very apparent and etching comes unframed. This is one of Piranesis most beloved compositions showing the homes of the greatest Roman emperors including; Caesar, Augustus, Tiberius, and Nero. This etching is one of Piranesi's most rare and searched for works, the detail is exquisite and the overall quality of the print is stunning.\n\nLike always please feel free to contact us directly at inquire@henningfineart.com below if you have any questions."
