        "text": "GUEST: So I brought a print by I believe an artist Piranesi.\n\nThat's basically all I know about it.\n\n(chuckles) APPRAISER: And how did you happen to acquire this print?\n\nGUEST: One of my friends was getting rid of a bunch of stuff, and he had left this in his front porch, and it was about to rain, so I didn't want to get it wet.\n\nAPPRAISER: You, you...\n\nGUEST: So I took it, just home with me.\n\nAPPRAISER: You, so you saved it.\n\nGUEST: Yeah.\n\n(laughing): Yeah.\n\n(chuckles) APPRAISER: Did the friend you ha, got it from have any idea as to what it was?\n\nGUEST: No, he usually got stuff from estate sales, and he... Just, anything that he wasn't interested in, he tossed out.\n\nAPPRAISER: And when did you save it from the rain?\n\nGUEST: Um, it was about five years ago.\n\nAPPRAISER: Have you had it hanging since then, or you just...\n\nGUEST: No, we have moved quite a bit, and so it's been sitting in a cardboard box in our garage.\n\nAPPRAISER: Oh.\n\nGUEST: I always thought it was something special, but I didn't really know much about it, and I wanted to find out more about it before I got it framed.\n\nAPPRAISER: It's an etching by Giovanni Battista Piranesi, uh, who was a major Italian printmaker, the major architectural etcher of the 18th century, and actually a personal favorite of, of mine.\n\nThis print is from the, Piranesi's most famous series, the \"Views of Rome,\" or the \"Vedute di Roma,\" which was popular in his day and has been popular ever since.\n\nIt's the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome.\n\nWe call that area-- basically through here-- the Roman Forum now, and this is the arch itself.\n\nThis ground is now probably ten or 15 feet lower.\n\nGUEST: Uh-huh.\n\nAPPRAISER: Because the land kept flooding, and they never cleaned it out.\n\nSo it just was, all this junky soil was there.\n\nThey then excavated it out, and that arch is still there, and it looks a whole lot more impressive...\n\nGUEST: Yeah.\n\nAPPRAISER: ... uh, these days.\n\nThe print was first made in 1759 or 1760.\n\nThis is printed later, probably from the first Paris edition, probably was published between 1800...\n\nGUEST: Oh, wow.\n\nAPPRAISER: ...and 1807.\n\nThere's lots of different editions of the Piranesis, but in the, the first Paris edition, you're looking at somewhere in the mid- to high hundreds were, were printed.\n\nGUEST: Hm, of each, um... APPRAISER: Of each print.\n\nGUEST: Okay.\n\nAPPRAISER: And then there are hundreds of prints in this series.\n\nGUEST: How did you know it was the Paris edition?\n\nAPPRAISER: Partly it's the watermark, is one way you tell, and another way, along the bottom over here, that's his original address and the price.\n\nThey removed that in later editions.\n\nThe lack of the centerfold, because the early editions were, almost always had centerfolds...\n\nGUEST: Oh, okay.\n\nAPPRAISER: Yeah.\n\nAnd then the later editions had extra numbers put on them.\n\nCondition-wise, you got sort of a junky mat here.\n\nGUEST: Yes.\n\nAPPRAISER: (chuckling): But that's what it came with.\n\nGUEST: (chuckling): I, I haven't done anything with it.\n\nAPPRAISER: Well, just take it to a decent framer, get rid of that mat.\n\nBut otherwise, it's, it's not torn, it's not stained, it's not glued down.\n\nIt's in very nice condition for a print of, of this era.\n\nA retail value would be around $2,500 to $3,000.\n\nGUEST: Wow.\n\nAPPRAISER: So I, I'm glad you saved it from the rain.\n\nGUEST: Yes.\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nAPPRAISER: Well, it may be time to get it out of the garage.\n\n(laughs) GUEST: Yes, definitely."
