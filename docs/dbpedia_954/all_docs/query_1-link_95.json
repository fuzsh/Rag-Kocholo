        "text": "Filippo Brunelleschi (1377– 1446)\n\nThe Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral\n\nFilippo Brunelleschi was an Italian designer and a key figure in architecture recognized to be the first modern engineer, planner, and sole construction supervisor.\n\nHe was one of the founding fathers of the Renaissance.\n\nHe is generally well known for developing a technique for linear perspective in art and for building the dome of the Florence Cathedral.\n\nHeavily dependent on mirrors and geometry, to “reinforce Christian spiritual reality”, his formulation of linear perspective governed pictorial depiction of space until the late 19th century. It also had the most profound – and quite unanticipated – influence on the rise of modern science.\n\nHis accomplishments also include other architectural works, sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and ship design.\n\nHis principal surviving works are to be found in Florence, Italy; however, his two original linear perspective panels have been lost.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nKeep reading\n\nRembrandt (1606 - 1669)\n\nSelf-portrait with Beret and Turned-Up Collar - 1659\n\nRembrandt was a Dutch draughtsman, painter, and printmaker.\n\nHe is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history. Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt’s works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes as well as animal studies.\n\nHis contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres.\n\nRembrandt never went abroad, but unlike Vermeer, he was considerably influenced by the work of the Italian masters and Netherlandish artists who had studied in Italy, like Pieter Lastman, the Utrecht Caravaggists, and Flemish Baroque Peter Paul Rubens.\n\nIn his works he exhibited knowledge of classical iconography, which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt’s knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of Amsterdam’s Jewish population. Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called “one of the great prophets of civilization”.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nKeep reading\n\nPaolo Uccello (1397-1475)\n\nSaint George and the Dragon\n\nPaolo Uccello, born Paolo di Dono, was an Italian painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual perspective in art.\n\nIn his book Lives of the artist, Giorgio Vasari wrote that Uccello was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point. While his contemporaries used perspective to narrate different or succeeding stories, Uccello used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings.\n\nPaolo worked in the Late Gothic tradition, emphasizing color and pageantry rather than the classical realism that other artists were pioneering. His style is best described as idiosyncratic, and he left no school of followers.\n\nHe has had some influence on twentieth-century art and literary criticism.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nKeep reading\n\nGiotto (1266-1337)\n\n(Kiss of Judas, fresco, Scrovegni Chapel)\n\nGiotto was an Italian painter and architect from Florence during the Late Middle Ages. He worked during the Gothic/Proto-Renaissance period.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nThe top of Giotto’s art is a cycle of frescoes painted in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padova (1305)\n\nWalls of this chapel are divided into 38 paintings\n\nKnown for its famous blue color that organizes space\n\nIts “realism” is seen as a new aesthetic sensibility:\n\nGiotto individualizes each face and emphasizes each person’s personality rather than the mass effect\n\nCharacters seen from the back accentuate their integration into space\n\nAediculaes drew at an angle making it possible to dig the space and to affirm 3D\n\nGreat importance is given to the decor elements (such as rocks)\n\nKeep reading\n\nCimabue 1240 – 1302\n\nFresco in the Lower Basilica of Assisi\n\nCimabue was an Italian painter and designer of mosaics from Florence.\n\nAlthough heavily influenced by Byzantine models, Cimabue is generally regarded as one of the first great Italian painters to break from the Italo-Byzantine style.\n\nWhile medieval art then was scenes and forms that appeared relatively flat and highly stylized, Cimabue’s figures were depicted with more-advanced lifelike proportions and shading than other artists of his time.\n\nAccording to Italian painter and historian Giorgio Vasari, Cimabue was the teacher of Giotto, the first great artist of the Italian Proto-Renaissance.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nKeep reading\n\nPietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti (1280/1290-1348)\n\nAnnunciation - Ambrogio Lorenzetti - 1344\n\nA. Lorenzetti was highly influenced by both Byzantine art and classical art forms and used these to create a unique and individualistic style of painting.\n\nHis work was exceptionally original. Individuality at this time was unusual due to the influence of patronage on art. Because paintings were often commissioned, individualism in art was infrequently seen.\n\nIt is known that Lorenzetti engaged in artistic pursuits that were thought to have their origins during the Renaissance, such as experimenting with perspective and physiognomy and studying classical antiquity.\n\nAmbrogio invented checkerboard paving, giving a depth effect.\n\nThey introduced naturalism into Sienese art. In their artistry and experiments with three-dimensional and spatial arrangements, the brothers foreshadowed the art of the Renaissance.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nKeep reading\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)\n\nLeonardo di ser Piero da Vinci was an Italian polymath of the Renaissance, whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography.\n\nHe has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time.\n\nSometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.\n\nKeep reading\n\nHenry Fuseli (1741 - 1825)\n\nThor Battering the Midgard Serpent - 1790\n\nJohann Heinrich Füssli (Henry Fuseli) was a Swiss painter, draughtsman, and writer on art who spent much of his life in Britain.\n\nFuseli is famous for his paintings and drawings of nude figures caught in strained and violent poses suggestive of intense emotion.\n\nHe also had a penchant for inventing macabre fantasies, such as that in The Nightmare.\n\nAlways drawn to literary and theatrical subjects, Fuseli developed a special interest in illustrating Shakespeare.\n\nHe painted works for John Boydell’s Shakespeare Gallery, and created his own “Milton Gallery”. He held the posts of Professor of Painting and Keeper at the Royal Academy.\n\nHis style had a considerable influence on many younger British artists, including William Blake.\n\n- Wikipedia\n\nKeep reading"
