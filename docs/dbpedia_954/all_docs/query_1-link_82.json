Giovanni Battista Piranesi and Italian architectural fantasies of the XVIII century \", dedicated to the early period of creativity Piranesi. The exhibition is part of the \"Year of Italy in Russia and the Year of Russia in Italy - 2011\" which continues the tradition of partnership and cooperation in culture and art between the two countries.\n\nin the 1740s young Venetian, then almost unknown artist, once in Rome, made his first steps to stardom. In Piranesi was neither fame nor money, but that's when he created most of his fantastic compositions. These works do not become famous in his lifetime, but then strange and original work, a series of Prima Parte, Grotteschi and Carceri , have been recognized as the most paradoxical and innovative creations of his.\n\nexhibition representing some 100 drawings and engravings from the Hermitage collection is divided into two parts: the first devoted to Piranesi and presents a series of Prima Parte («Prima Parte»), Grotteschi («Grotesque\") and Carceri («Prison») in rare early states, never before in Russia, not published. They all come from the graphics became the basis of the Hermitage collection album Opere Varie in 1750, purchased by Catherine II in 1768 with the collection of Count Bruhl. Series Carceri is available in two states: an early, from the collection of Bruhl, and later, highly processed. Such a comparison is made in Russia for the first time.\n\nMany Italian artists created paintings with images of ideal architectural compositions, are often pure fantasy. In the second part of the exhibition are drawings of masters of the first half of the XVIII century that had a direct impact on Piranesi, as well as works by masters of the end of this century, inspired by his engravings. The exhibition includes works Bibiena family Galli, J. Valeriani, Pietro Gonzaga, J. Barber, J. Manokki. Many of the works published for the first time. Stylistics settechento (so called in Italian XVIII century), as well as the style of the Piranesi, can not be reduced to any one style: Baroque, barokketto, Rococo, Neo-Classicism. A special Italian genre are imaginary - an original, complex and important to understand the style of its time - just as unique as early fantasies of Roman genius, and to trace the origins as well as the effect of this paradoxical master at his age, the exhibition prints Piranesi placed in the context of this particular genre.\n\nGiovanni Battista Piranesi drawbridge.

Etching, burin, drypoint\n\nSource: hermitagemuseum.org\n\nGiovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) firmly entrenched in the history of art as an artist, which established the European art of the middle of XVIII - early XIX century. Piranesi considered a reformer in the field of taste, and one of the protagonists of neo-classicism, a kind of avant-garde of the XVIII century, so his name is associated primarily with this direction. However, little noticed in his lifetime series of etchings entitled Carceri ( «Dungeon» ) - a strange series of unexplainable frightening images of the dark - for many decades ahead of his time. Carceri has become one of the most beloved works of modernism. Not a particularly popular during the life of Piranesi and re-open romanticism, this series again and again attracted and attracts writers, architects, filmmakers, not only unusual story, but the spatial construction, reminiscent not of the actual architecture, but about surreal space of sleep, obsessions. In the novel «Confessions of an English Opium consuming» Thomas De Quincey wrote a series of so-bright Carceri Piranesi in opium vision of \"artificial paradise\" switched-on brain predictive esthete that fantasy artist began to be treated as a breakthrough in the art of the future. This novel is incredibly popular with the aesthetes in Gautier and Baudelaire created by Piranesi reputation as one of the first artists, they enter the world of the subconscious painful. In Russia, Vladimir Odoevsky writes a story «Opere del Cavaliere Giambattista Piranesi» , making it the main \"representative of the Roman neoclassicism\" in a desperate and dark romantic figure. «dungeons» Piranesi admired Victor Hugo, created under the influence of etching a series of images, in turn, influenced the symbolism of Odilon Redon, from which is a direct way to expressionism and surrealism. Under the influence of Piranesi etchings are set to «Hamlet» Shakespeare, and Beethoven's opera «Fidelio» . An essay on Piranesi wrote Aldous Huxley, Sergei Eisenstein, the darkest fantasies of Piranesi and tells Edgar Allan Poe. Nicolas de Stael, Hans Hartung and created abstract compositions dedicated Carceri . Maurits Cornelis Escher used the ideas of Piranesi for his experiments in building a spatial maze. Piranesi's etchings have been the starting point for many directors, they were used in his films, Sergei Eisenstein and Fritz Lang. His architectural ideas have inspired the architects of totalitarianism regimes, Mussolini's Italy, Stalin's Soviet Union and Hitler's Third Reich, and at the same time, it became almost the favorite architect of postmodernism. By the number of responses and quotations in the art of the XX century Piranesi among the artists of his time ranked first went into modernism.\n\nGiuseppe Valeriani\n\npalace with numerous sculptures in the niches and a fountain.
