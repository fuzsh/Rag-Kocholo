        "text": "\"I am Piranesi.\n\n\"But I knew that I did not really believe this. Piranesi is not my name. (I am almost certain that Piranesi is not my name.)\n\n\"I once asked the Other why he called me Piranesi.\n\n\"He laughed in a slightly embarrassed way. Oh, that (he said). Well, originally it was a sort of joke I suppose. I have to call you something. And it suits you. Itâ€™s a name associated with labyrinths.\" (Kindle Locations 2188-2192).\n\nAt first, Piranesi may seem to be just an invocation of a very strange other-worldly experience, the tale of a loner in an inexplicable and unending series of rooms and spaces. These rooms are filled with mysterious statues and other daunting objects, including skeletons of a number of humans to which the narrator gives identities. It's a world filled with water that rises and falls in strange tidal floods. The narrator has to find fresh water to drink, and eats broth that he makes from seaweed and mussels, but he also has vague memories of other food -- like packets of crisps. There are also birds: the narrator befriends a pair of albatross, and helps them make a nest from seaweed.\n\nAfter a while, though, there's a plot, and quietly Clarke sneaks up on you: Piranesi is a story of a mind figuring out who it is and what its nearly-forgotten past was. Piranesi is an adventure, with risks and dangers and discoveries. The narrator goes from abstract atmospheric descriptions to a suspenseful series of events. Very enjoyable to read!"
