        "text": "Hello bookdragons! I am here with my review of Piranesi by Susanna Clarke. I read this book in April, as I’ve heard so much about it. It was also recommended to me in The Book Analysts. All I knew going in was that it was strange, Piranesi lives in the House, and most people love the writing. While I wanted to kick off my Susanna Clarke backlist with her debut, I couldn’t resist letting this small, impactful book into my life.\n\nSynopsis from Goodreads\n\nPiranesi’s house is no ordinary building. Its rooms are infinite. The corridors endless. And its walls are lined with thousands upon thousands of statues, each one different from all the others. Within the labyrinth of halls an ocean is imprisoned. Waves thunder up staircases, rooms are flooded in an instant. But Piranesi is not afraid; he understands the tides as he understands the pattern of the labyrinth itself. He lives to explore the house.\n\nThere is one other person in the house. A man called The Other visits Piranesi twice a week and asks for help with research into A Great and Secret Knowledge. But as Piranesi explores, evidence emerges of another person, and a terrible truth begins to unravel, revealing a world beyond the one Piranesi has always known.\n\nThe Hype Around Piranesi\n\nI don’t know anyone who hasn’t heard of Piranesi, especially within the book community. It’s one of THE books that people recommend. In fact, this article from The Guardian delves deeper into the theme of isolation.\n\nPiranesi is a tenebrous study in solitude. It is also newly mysterious. Its narrator, though deprived of both company and reliable memories, seems curiously content with his lot. He wanders empty halls and courtyards, cataloguing in his meticulous journal entries their bewildering array of statuary. He documents with satisfaction – and with no trace of despair – how he has sustained himself with meagre catches of fish and staved off the cold by burning dried seaweed.\n\nI found out the character of Piranesi is somehow linked to the 18th Century engraver. Giovanni Battista Piranesi was an Italian architect and artist, famous for his etchings of prisons. These small details I like.\n\nMy Review of Piranesi\n\nAfter all that, I’m sorry to say that I didn’t rate this book as highly as everyone else. While it was a good book, I just found it very repetitive at times. But the premise and the idea behind it is fascinating. As a character, Piranesi is incredibly likeable. Not least because he is genuine and pure, but he talks to the birds and finds comfort in his surroundings. Although I am a fan of flowery writing, like that of Morgenstern and Taylor. but I just didn’t really gel with this.\n\nHave you read Piranesi? What did you think? Or is it on your TBR?\n\nUntil next time, please stay safe.\n\nBeth xo\n\nBeth is a one-human team trying to blog and manage freelancing works.
