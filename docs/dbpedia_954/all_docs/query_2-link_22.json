        "text": "theremin, string quartet, and video, 2007; video by Lothar Osterburg, 2007, revised 2012\n\n(excerpt) Performed by Elizabeth Brown, theremin, with the Momenta Quartet\n\nFrom Elizabeth Brown: Mirage New World 80751-2\n\nvideo (by Lothar Osterburg, 2012)\n\nElizabeth Brown, theremin, with the Momenta Quartet\n\n(note: the video begins in silence)\n\nThe revised 2012 version of the video can be seen here.\n\nduration: 14′\n\nprogram note\n\nPiranesi, the 3rd collaboration between Lothar Osterburg and Elizabeth Brown, is inspired by the dramatic, exaggerated architectural world created by Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778) in his Carceri, or imaginary prisons. One of the masterpieces of printmaking, the Carceri are notable for being issued in two states: initially in 1744 when Piranesi was 24, then again 17 years later, in a heavily worked, dramatically darker version; these two states give the viewer a unique insight into the creative mind and working process of the artist. In his homage to Piranesi, Osterburg uses stop-motion animation to capture the many stages in his own unique artistic process, from the initial conception to the completion of a photogravure, his printmaking specialty. Osterburg and Piranesi, who share an October 4th birthday, both combine a unique artistic vision with an outstanding technical expertise in etching. Brown combines string quartet, with its long history in western culture, with the wild card of the theremin!\n\nLothar Osterburg’s website:\n\nhttps://lotharosterburgphotogravure.com/\n\nFor more information on Piranesi:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Piranesi"
