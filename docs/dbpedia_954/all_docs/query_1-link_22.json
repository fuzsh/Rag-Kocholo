        "text": "Considered one of the greatest printmakers of the 18th century, Giovanni Battista Piranesi was famous for his depictions of classical Rome as a shining example of Neoclassicism. After studying in Venice, Piranesi moved to Rome where he explored his love for architectural fantasies and vestiges of ancient times. Preferring etching, he rendered detailed romanticized images of the ruins, such as aqueduct systems, temples and other structures from the Roman Empire. His success as both an artist and an antiquarian (a person who studies things of the past) was made possible by the rising popularity of the Grand Tours. During this time, many wealthy American and European patrons traveled throughout Europe and collected mementos of their educational and enlightening experiences."
