Giovanni Battista Piranesi was an Italian engraver and architect. Born in Venice in 1720, the illusionist first learned architecture from his uncle Matteo Lucchesi at the Magistrato delle Acque. After a falling out, he continued his studies with Giovanni Scalfarotto. He then devoted himself to training as a stage designer, where he came into contact with the art of illusion and perspective. This particular form of optical illusion later became a specific feature of his work.

In 1740 Piranesi, who was also called Giambattista Piranesi, traveled to Rome as a draftsman, where he began studying Roman architecture. He interned with the architects Nicola Salvi and Luigi Vanvitelli, the last representatives of the genuine Roman Baroque. In Rome he learned the basics of etching and engraving from the veduta artist Giuseppe Vasi. Piranesi was deeply impressed by Rome and the ancient ruins, so that he decided to revive that ancient Rome in his art of drawing.

In 1743 he published his first book: Prima parte di Architettura e Prospettive. These were city views, which he illustrated by means of graven image work and etchings. From 1743 to 1747, Piranesi settled in his native Venice before deciding to return to Rome - eventually running a store on the Via del Corso. About ten years later, it led him to publish the four book volumes Antichit√† romane - the foundation stone for international renown.
