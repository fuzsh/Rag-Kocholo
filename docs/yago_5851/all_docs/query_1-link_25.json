        "text": "Here you are.\n\nWell, this takes care.\n\nOf almost all my\n\nChristmas shopping.\n\nProbably think of something\n\nI forgot when I get home.\n\nWe'll be open till 9:00.\n\nThank you.\n\nHello, Twyla.\n\nOh, Nellie, merry Christmas.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nBye.\n\nOh, Miss Alma!\n\nMiss Alma, it's good to see you.\n\nWhy, Nellie. Nellie Ewell.\n\nI tried to see you, but\n\nthey said you were sick.\n\nNot sick. Just not well.\n\nMy, you are grown up, Nellie.\n\nIt's just my clothes.\n\nI pick my own clothes now.\n\nYour voice is grown up, too.\n\nThey taught me diction.\n\nI'm learning to talk like you.\n\nLong A's and everything...\n\nCan't, bath, laugh.\n\nYesterday I slipped.\n\nI said I laughed and laughed.\n\nUntil I nearly died laughing.\n\nJohnny was so amused at me.\n\nJohnny?\n\nYour next-door neighbor\n\nDr. Johnny,\n\nSomebody whose feelings\n\nyou've hurt very badly,\n\nSomebody who says you've\n\nrefused to see him.\n\nDid he say that?\n\nYes, he did.\n\nOh, but I thought he\n\ndidn't want to see me.\n\nOf course, I've seen nobody.\n\nFor the last several months.\n\nThe wind is penetrating\n\nthis afternoon.\n\nGosh. I almost forgot your\n\npresent for Christmas.\n\nOpen it. Now?\n\nPlease. So prettily wrapped.\n\nSince it was for you,\n\nI did a dainty job of it.\n\nI'll save this sprig of holly.\n\nI'll pin it on you.\n\nYes. Do.\n\nWhat an exquisite handkerchief.\n\nIt's from Maison Blanche.\n\nSmell it.\n\nSachet of roses.\n\nWell... I can't tell you how...\n\nHow touched and pleased I am.\n\nRead the card.\n\n\"Joyous Noel to Alma...\"\n\nFrom John\"?\n\nI was helping him\n\nwrap presents last night.\n\nWhen we came to yours,\n\nWe started talking about you.\n\nYou mean, he spoke well of me?\n\nWell of?\n\nWe raved, simply raved.\n\nHe told me the influence\n\nyou had on him.\n\nHe told me about you last summer.\n\nWhen he was so mixed up.\n\nAnd how you were responsible.\n\nFor his pulling himself together.\n\nAfter his father was killed.\n\nHe regards you\n\nas an angel, Miss Alma.\n\nThis is the only angel\n\nin Glorious Hill,\n\nAnd her body is stone,\n\nAnd her blood is mineral water.\n\nRun along now, Nellie,\n\nAnd deliver\n\nyour Christmas presents.\n\nWait till I've told you\n\nthe wonderfullest thing.\n\nNellie, good-bye.\n\nGood-bye, Miss Alma.\n\n[Knock on door]\n\nNo greeting?\n\nNo greeting at all?\n\nHello, Miss Alma.\n\nIt's rather late to tell\n\nyou how happy I am.\n\nAnd how proud of you, John.\n\nI feel almost as your\n\nfather might have if...\n\nAnd are you happy now, John?\n\nI've settled with life.\n\nOn fairly acceptable terms.\n\nIsn't that all a\n\nreasonable person can ask?\n\nNo.\n\nI think he can\n\nask for much more.\n\nI think he can ask\n\nfor the coming true.\n\nOf his most improbable dreams.\n\nIt's best not to ask\n\nfor too much.\n\nOh, I disagree.\n\nI say ask for all.\n\nAnd, of course,\n\nbe prepared to get nothing.\n\nYou know, I haven't been well.\n\nYour father told me.\n\nFor a while, I felt as\n\nthough I were going to die.\n\nWhen did you have that feeling?\n\nAugust, September.\n\nSoon after you left.\n\nBut now the gulf wind.\n\nHas blown that feeling away.\n\nLike a cloud of smoke.\n\nI know now that I am not dying.\n\nIt isn't going to\n\nturn out to be...\n\nQuite that simple.\n\nHave you been anxious\n\nabout your heart again?\n\nAnd now the stethoscope.\n\nWhy don't you say anything?\n\nWhat can I say, Miss Alma?\n\nOh, you've gone back.\n\nTo calling me Miss Alma again.\n\nWe never really\n\ngot past that point.\n\nYes, we did.\n\nWe were so close we\n\nalmost breathed together.\n\nDid you think that?\n\nI knew it.\n\nIs it impossible now?\n\nI don't think\n\nI know what you mean.\n\nPlease, be honest with me.\n\nI once said no.\n\nYou may remember the time,\n\nWith all that demented\n\nhowling from the cockfight,\n\nBut the girl who said no,\n\nShe doesn't exist anymore.\n\nShe died last summer,\n\nSuffocated from the smoke,\n\nSomething on fire inside of her,\n\nAnd she doesn't live now,\n\nBut she left me\n\nher ring, you see?\n\nAnd she said to me,\n\nWhen she slipped\n\nthis ring on my finger,\n\n\"Remember. I died empty-handed,\n\nSo make sure that your hands\n\nhave something in them.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"What about pride?\"\n\nAnd she said,\n\n\"Forget about pride.\n\n\"Whenever it stands.\n\nBetween you\n\nand what you must have.\"\n\nAnd I said...\n\n\"But what if he\n\ndoesn't want me?\"\n\nI don't know what she said then.\n\nI don't know whether she\n\nsaid anything at all.\n\nHer lips stopped moving.\n\nI think...\n\nshe stopped breathing.\n\nYou've won the argument.\n\nWhat argument?\n\nAbout the chart.\n\nChart.\n\nYes.\n\nIt shows we're not a\n\npackage of rose leaves.\n\nI've come around to\n\nyour way of thinking.\n\nSomething else is there,\n\nAn immaterial something,\n\nThin as smoke.\n\nIt can't be seen,\n\nIt can't be shown,\n\nBut it's there, just the same.\n\nAre you speaking of\n\na spiritual relationship?\n\nI don't want to be talked to.\n\nAs though I were some\n\nincurably sick patient.\n\nThat you have to comfort.\n\nI wasn't trying...\n\nI'm glad you've come around.\n\nTo my way of thinking,\n\nBut don't try to deceive me.\n\nI've come here to speak\n\non equal terms.\n\nIt's no longer a secret\n\nthat I love you.\n\nIt never was.\n\nI have loved you.\n\nAs long ago as our childhood,\n\nWhen I used to hear your\n\nfriends calling your name.\n\n\"Johnny, Johnny.\"\n\nOh, how it went through me.\n\nJust to hear your name called.\n\nYes...\n\nIt had begun that early,\n\nthis affliction of love,\n\nAnd it's never\n\nlet go of me since.\n\nBut kept on growing\n\nuntil at last.\n\nIt's overwhelmed\n\nand possessed me.\n\nTell me, how did I fail?\n\nWhy didn't it happen between us?\n\nHow can two people\n\ncome so close and no closer?\n\nWhenever we've gotten together,\n\nThose three or four times...\n\nAs few as that?\n\nWe seem to be trying\n\nto find something.\n\nIn each other.\n\nSomething...\n\nIt wasn't body hunger,\n\nAlthough I acted as if I thought.\n\nIt might be that one night.\n\nI know.\n\nIt wasn't the physical you.\n\nThat I really wanted.\n\nYou've told me.\n\nYou didn't have that to give.\n\nNot at that time!\n\nYou had something else to give.\n\nYou couldn't name it,\n\nAnd I couldn't recognize it.\n\nI thought it was\n\na puritanical ice.\n\nThat glittered like flame.\n\nNow I believe it was flame,\n\nMistaken for ice.\n\nI still don't understand it...\n\nBut I know it was there,\n\nJust as I know that your\n\neyes and your voice.\n\nAre the two most\n\nbeautiful things\n\nI've ever known,\n\nAnd also the warmest,\n\nAlthough they don't\n\nseem to be set.\n\nIn your body at all.\n\nYou talk as though my... my body.\n\nHad ceased to exist\n\nfor you, John,\n\nIn spite of the fact.\n\nThat you just counted my pulse.\n\nOh...\n\nThe tables have turned.\n\nYes.\n\nThe tables have turned\n\nwith a vengeance.\n\nHa ha ha!\n\nI've come around\n\nto your old way of thinking,\n\nYou, to mine,\n\nLike two people who\n\ncall on each other.\n\nOn the same day.\n\nEach finds the other gone out,\n\nAnd the door locked,\n\nAnd no one to answer the bell.\n\nI came here this afternoon.\n\nTo tell you that\n\nyour being a gentleman.\n\nIsn't important to me anymore.\n\nYou're telling me that\n\nI must remain a lady.\n\nYes...\n\nThe tables have turned\n\nwith a vengeance.\n\nThe air in here smells of ether.\n\nIt's making me dizzy.\n\nDo you remember.\n\nThose little white tablets\n\nyou once gave me?\n\nI've used them all up,\n\nAnd I would like some more."
