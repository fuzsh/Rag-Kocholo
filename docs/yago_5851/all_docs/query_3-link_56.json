        "text": "By Sr. Mary Guadalupe, C.K.\n\nSt. James School, Crete\n\nSix hundred thirteen. Growing up, I would have told you that that number would be zero. In 17 years, I’ve taught 613 children, but I never wanted to be a teacher.\n\nWhen I was initially discerning religious life, I knew that the School Sisters of Christ the King were teachers, but I still wasn’t drawn to the apostolate of teaching. I believed that God was calling me to religious life, and I wanted to be completely dedicated to Jesus and live my life for Him; I just wasn’t so sure about teaching. Growing up, I aspired to be in the Olympics some day, and maybe after that, a career in sports medicine, but not in a classroom. Now, however, I can’t imagine doing anything else.\n\nInitially, my idea of teaching and education was based solely on what I could see externally. I knew teachers did a lot of things such as planning lessons, grading papers, decorating the classroom, listening to students, talking to parents, making copies and so many other things. Most of those things did not appeal to me. However, after entering religious life and beginning to observe and assist in classrooms, my understanding began to change. While there is much necessary paperwork involved in the process of educating a child, I came to see that teaching is so much more than the external.\n\nEducation, particularly education in the Catholic tradition, is about accompanying children on the path to Heaven. It is about seeking truth together and knowing that ultimately, this Truth that we all seek is Jesus Christ. It is to teach them to seek Truth, Beauty and Goodness, to be able to live as a human fully alive in this world, but always with a view to the next. It is about being a spiritual mother, guiding them, listening to the desires of their hearts and caring for them.\n\nTeaching, especially as a religious, is about receiving what the Lord gives in prayer and deeping in relationship with Him, and then communicating that to the students so that they might also grow in relationship with Jesus, who desires their eternal happiness in Heaven with Him forever.\n\nIn an article titled, “St. Thomas Aquinas on Education and Instruction,” Leo Elders S.V.D. says “St. Thomas Aquinas has a high view of the task of teaching: he who teaches benefits many, and to teach is to render the students more perfect. Teaching others the truth is to be considered a sort of spiritual almsgiving… the relationship between a teacher and his students should be that between friends in a virtuous friendship.”\n\nAs a teacher, I have had the great privilege of walking with many students through the years. It has been a joy to see them discover truth in a particular lesson, but also through human interactions with their peers, with me, and other school staff. I have seen them grow in virtue through times of struggle and times of joy. We have challenged each other to become better Christians and to strive after greatness.\n\nOne of the greatest gifts that I have received as a religious sister who is also a teacher is that of being a spiritual mother. While I have experienced a maternal heart and love for my students, I didn’t quite know how they have experienced it until one day after school when a dialogue transpired between a couple of my students. Most of the children had already left for the day so it was just myself and two students remaining. As I was sitting at my desk, one of the students, remembering a comment I had made during a Theology of the Body lesson on chastity, blurted out, “Hey Sister, I thought that you wanted to be married.”\n\nBefore I even had time to respond, the other student replied, “She is married!” To which the first student replied, presumably remembering the four qualities of love we talked about earlier—free, total, faithful and fruitful, “Then shouldn’t it be fruitful?”\n\nAutomatically, the other student answered by saying, “It is fruitful. She has us, and I think we’re wonderful.”\n\nI had the last word and was able to say to them, “You’re right. I do have you and you are wonderful.” It was a gift from the Lord to hear reflected back the spiritual motherhood that I experienced as their teacher.\n\nWhen I entered religious life and studied to become a teacher, I had no idea what the Lord had in store for me. I am grateful for the abundant blessings that He has given me of spiritual motherhood through Catholic education and participating in the Church’s mission of forming children to be His disciples.\n\nAs another school year is nearly ready to begin, I look forward to the many ways that God is going to show me Himself through the students and their insights and to accompany them and journey with them on our path to Heaven."
