        "text": "In Bride of Frankenstein, Dr. Pretorius, played by the inimitable Ernest Thesiger, raises his glass and proposes a toast to Colin Clive’s Henry Frankenstein—“to a new world of Gods and Monsters.” I invite you to join me in exploring this world, focusing on horror films from the dawn of the Universal Monster movies in 1931 to the collapse of the studio system and the rise of the new Hollywood rebels in the late 1960’s. With this period as our focus, and occasional ventures beyond, we will explore this magnificent world of classic horror. So, I raise my glass to you and invite you to join me in the toast.\n\nBeginning with a warning from the producers stating they “feel a moral obligation” to inform the audience that the film they are about to see will “shock you as no other film ever has” and followed by one of the strongest cold opens of any horror film, Black Sunday is a feast for the senses. It is a film so clearly made by a master of the camera. Every composition is flawless, the images indelible, and the fluidity of the shots mesmerizing. It is both a throwback to the stylish look of the Universal classics and a foretaste of the terrifying feasts to come. It also introduced the world to two great horror icons, one in front of the camera and the other behind it.\n\nThe film begins in seventeenth century Moldavia at a medieval execution by the Inquisition. The narration tells us that “one day each century, it is said that Satan walks amongst us. To the God-fearing, this day is known as Black Sunday.” Accused of witchcraft, Princess Asa Vajda (Barbara Steele) is put to death as a high priestess of Satan by the Grand Inquisitor of Moldavia—her own brother. The bronze, spike lined “mask of Satan” is driven onto her face with a giant war hammer, but not before she calls down a curse upon him and all who would defy her. “My revenge will strike down you and your accursed house. And in the blood you give your son, and his son, and his son will I continue to live immortal…and I shall return to torment and destroy throughout the nights of time!”\n\nThis remarkable sequence sets the stage beautifully for the film to come. It is filled with mist, flames, black robed and hooded figures, and gnarled, black, dead trees that reach their skeletal fingers through the frame. The whole film is dominated by images like these along with gothic ruins, ancient graveyards, and cobwebbed crypts. In many ways, the story follows the basic structure of a Dracula film, but rather than the Count travelling from an Eastern European location, two doctors travel to one. Several trappings of the vampire film are also engaged including blood drinking and rejuvenation through it, a superstitious and hyper-religious peasantry, and the power of crucifixes and religious iconography to repel Asa and her undead servant Javuto (Arturo Dominici). But the matters of plot are far less important in Black Sunday than images, mood, and atmosphere.\n\nWhen young Dr. Andrej Gorobec (John Richardson) and his mentor Dr. Kruvajon (Andrea Checchi) discover Asa’s tomb, the atmosphere is palpable and evokes the dungeons that house the coffins of Dracula and his vampire brides in the opening of the 1931 film. When Dr. Kruvajon removes the mask of Satan, he finds that Asa’s body and face are still intact, though swarming with scorpions and vermin. A few droplets of Kruvajon’s blood inadvertently dripped onto Asa’s waiting body begin to revive her. The moments of Asa’s eyes reforming and her body awakening still carry an eerie power after sixty years.\n\nLater, Asa’s servant Javuto, who suffered the same fate as Asa, is called from his unconsecrated grave to do her bidding. His resurrection scene is one of the film’s most memorable moments as he pushes aside the earth that has covered him for two centuries and pulls the mask of Satan from his face before disappearing into the mist. His foreboding presence is incredibly powerful on screen. Despite his great size, he manages to take his victims by surprise, thanks to a series of secret passages in the Vajda estate, as well has his uncanny abilities for silence and stealth. In many ways, Javuto is something of a gothic prototype of the stalker killers found in so many gialli, which director Mario Bava would help invent, and slashers that were to come.\n\nPulling the strings from behind it all, Asa is the true terror of Black Sunday. With her undeniable vampiric qualities, Asa is able to coerce complete loyalty from those who fall under her spell, which they seem to do willingly. She summons Dr. Kruvajan to “look into my eyes” and though her face is filled with the holes of her spiked death mask, she is irresistible. Like Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee as Dracula before her, Steele as Asa is every bit as fearsome and alluring as either of them.\n\nEnglish actress Barbara Steele had played a few supporting parts in minor films before Black Sunday, but here she plays not just one, but two memorable leading roles. As the high Satanic priestess, she is formidable and terrifying. As Katia, the daughter of Prince Vajda (Ivo Garrani), descendent of Asa’s executioner, she is vulnerable and imbued with great sadness. Steele is absolutely captivating in both roles. She possesses a unique and mysterious beauty that she uses to great advantage in both roles. Her large, smoky eyes are at turns sinister and sad. She is particularly measured as Katia. We never quite know what she is thinking or what she may be hiding. As Asa, she passionately delivers the best kind of “scenery chewing” performance. Both are utterly memorable and both reason for the start of her career as one of the great actors of classic horror.\n\nFollowing Black Sunday, Steele would appear in a number of AIP films like The Pit and the Pendulum (1961) and Italian horror films like The Horrible Dr. Hichcock (1962-the name in the title changed as to not infringe upon the famous director) and Castle of Blood (1964). In the 1970’s, new generation horror filmmakers David Cronenberg and Joe Dante cast her in their early films Shivers (1975) and Piranha (1978) respectively. Outside of the genre, she worked with such filmmakers as Federico Fellini in 8 ½ (1963) and Louis Malle in Pretty Baby (1978). She remains one of the most memorable and iconic performers of all time, but particularly for fans of the macabre.\n\nDirector Mario Bava was already an experienced cinematographer by the time he made the leap to directing and continued to photograph his own films. His experience in that role is crucial to the success of the film and one of the reasons why Black Sunday is one of the great feature debuts of horror. Between himself and production designer Giorgio Giovannini, the film has an unmistakable and unforgettable look. Lighting is precise, compositions perfect, and camera moves have great intentionality. The camera work is sometimes elaborate, sometimes simple, but always serves the purposes of the film. Compositions draw the eye and sometimes misdirect for the sake of a scene. Bava was well aware that film is a magic trick, and he has several up his sleeve in Black Sunday.\n\nOne of my favorites is used twice in the film. At one point, Asa draws Katia to her crypt in order to steal her essence and gain eternal life. As the lifeforce drains from Katia, she appears to grow old as Asa appears to grow younger. To achieve this, Bava employs a technique that is simple but incredibly effective—and only possible in black and white. It had been used before in the 1931 version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde starring Fredric March for the early part of his transformation from the good doctor into the semi-simian Hyde. The scene is lit with two gelled lights on dimmers with old age makeup that matches the color of one of the gels applied to the actor. As the dimmer is switched from one light to the other the age makeup either appears or disappears as needed for the scene. The effect works remarkably well both in this scene and in the film’s fiery climax.\n\nBava would soon gain a reputation as one of the great directors of Italian horror. Many of his films would help shape the sub-genre known as giallo and greatly influence the slasher films of the late 70’s and 80’s. Black Sabbath (1963), Blood and Black Lace (1964), Kill, Baby…Kill! (1966), A Hatchet for the Honeymoon (1970), A Bay of Blood (1971), and many more are considered classics and among the most influential films for the horror genre ever made. His films are often more stylish than substantive but are also incredibly entertaining and groundbreaking. His contributions to the genre simply cannot be overstated. He was one of the true masters of his craft.\n\nThe influence of Black Sunday specifically was strongly felt at the time and continues to ripple out to this very day. It made a direct mark upon the Roger Corman Edgar Allan Poe films made at AIP (American International Pictures) and the Hammer films of the 1960’s, as well as the Amicus anthologies of the following decade. As previously mentioned, the character of Javuto has links to Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees. His appearances from the shadows as light slowly increases on him are very much like the famous shot in which Michael Myers appears from the darkness behind Laurie Strode before he first attacks her in Halloween (1978). Even today, the recently released Fear Street films seem to draw some influence, intentional or otherwise, from Black Sunday.\n\nIt is remarkable how well the film holds up even to this day. Though it may no longer be able to “shock us as no film ever has,” it certainly still has the ability to entice us. This is largely due to the imagination of Mario Bava and the engaging nature of Barbara Steele in the leading roles. Upon this most recent watch, I still found aspects of it quite unsettling, which is a testament to the creativity and audaciousness of the filmmakers. The reputation of Black Sunday has only grown over the past sixty years. May it continue to grow for sixty more.\n\nTwice a month Joe Lipsett will dissect a new Amityville Horror film to explore how the “franchise” has evolved in increasingly ludicrous directions. This is “The Amityville IP.”\n\nThe last couple entries in this editorial series have examined two of the three titles released by executive producer, writer, and director Nick Box released the week of April 13, 2023.\n\nAmityville Frankenstein is abysmal while Amityville Job Interview has a kernel of an interesting idea, but isn’t wholly successful. So how does Box’s third entry, Amityville Elevator, fare?\n\nWell, much like Job Interview, there’s a glimmer of promise here, but the film is let down by the usual padded runtime and lack of character and plot. It’s a fantastic premise for a short, but Elevator is a 72-minute film and so, like Amityville Frankenstein, the result is a bloated, extravagant runtime for what is little more than a bare bones film.\n\nLike Box’s two previous entries, Amityville Elevator actually debuted under the title Elevator to Insanity back in 2018. Rebranded under the Amityville moniker, the logline purports to “spoof” two recent horror trends: Elevated horror (get it?) and Amityville films.\n\nThe film has a bare bones premise: an unnamed Greek photographer (Gus Capucci) enters a non-descript elevator for a never-ending ride. Long minutes pass before the elevator pauses, admitting a woman (Bryonny) who gets off shortly afterwards. This sequence of events repeats at regular intervals, with the time between the woman’s arrival and departure slowly decreasing as the film progresses.\n\nInitially the photographer pays no mind to the ridiculously lengthy journey, but in time he tries to question his fellow rider, who either ignores him or doesn’t respond. In time he also sees a woman practicing ballet on one of the floors who, in the film’s best sequence, slowly approaches the elevator, getting closer floor by floor.\n\nAt one point, the photographer is also attacked by a woman who screams at him – this goes on for nearly six consecutive minutes.\n\nThe photographer does ultimately try to exit the elevator, though it takes nearly thirty minutes for his first attempt. In the film’s most intriguing moment, when our protagonist peers into the darkness beyond the elevator doors, he’s dazzled by a slow moving light as the lift’s distorted electronic voice offers vague self-help platitudes such as “Embrace the familiar,” “You made this choice,” “Achieve your purpose,” and “Believe in yourself.”\n\nThe fact that the film ends with the photographer finally exiting the elevator in order to take pictures of four unmoving bodies posed on tables suggests the character is trapped in some kind of punitive purgatory due to his craft.\n\nMaybe? The truth is that it’s not entirely clear.\n\nWith virtually no dialogue, no character development, and nearly sixty minutes of repetitive, identical imagery, Amityville Elevator doesn’t offer a lot to work with. And yet, if we return to the logline that this is somehow a “spoof,” a different take on the film is possible.\n\nTo be clear: calling this a spoof is an incredibly generous read, but by the end of the film, it’s not much of a stretch to read Amityville Elevator as a pointed jab at the entirety of the “franchise.”\n\nToo many of these films are hollow, thinly-plotted cash-grabs that weaponize the brand recognition of Amityville by pairing it with a buzzy, saleable conceit (werewolf, witch, clown, etc). And while several entries have played fair with audience expectations and actually, you know, made a film – more than a few creatives have simply turned on the camera, filmed an hour’s worth of content, slapped the word “Amityville” on it, and sold it to Tubi.\n\nNot unlike Ghosts of Amityville, Amityville Elevator would have made a decent short. There’s a solid high-concept premise here: man trapped in a never-ending elevator ride is forced to confront his (maybe literal) demons. But there’s absolutely no reason for the film to be longer than fifteen minutes. Seeing the photographer literally stand in the same spot and fail to engage another passenger for 40+ minutes isn’t entertainment; it’s torture.\n\nA short with tighter editing could have encouraged audiences to become eagle-eyed sleuths looking for slight deviations in the repetitious action. By the time he finally exits the elevator at minute 53, however, it’s not just the photographer who is stuck on this interminable ride; it’s the audience.\n\nAnd that may just be the point! There’s absolutely no way to recommend this experience, which practically begs to be skipped through in parts or played at high speed like pornography. But in hindsight, the ennui of revisiting the same tired experience, albeit with surface-level tweaks, is an incredibly astute encapsulation of what the Amityville “franchise” has become.\n\nThese films are now an endless, repetitive slog of sameness, broken up by intermittent screaming and monotone reminders to “accept your fate.” In this way, Amityville Elevator is an allegory for what the “franchise” has become.\n\nThe Amityville IP Awards go to…\n\nCute Ending: At film’s end, the photographer is replaced by a different male photographer, which plays into the idea that the “franchise” is simply being remade over and over again with different people.\n\nLanguage Subtitling: The only reason we know the photographer is Greek is because the subtitles read “Yelling in Greek.” It’s an odd creative choice that doesn’t advance the character or the narrative, though. It could be argued that this contributes to the language barrier between the photographer and his fellow passenger, but the woman only ever appears disinterested. Of course, we don’t know because she never speaks; his is the only dialogue in the film, apart from the elevator.\n\nCarnival of Curiousity: The dancing woman that occupies the photographer’s attention for a few floors is the closest Box comes to a creepy sequence. This passage coincidentally also occupies the shortest runtime (approximately 2.5 minutes), which means it’s brief enough for the repetition to sneak in without being overdone. It’s clear that Box has some intriguing ideas, but he needs to tighten his films up and stop padding the runtime.\n\n10 to go: We’re nearing the end! As of this publication of this editorial, there are ten Amityville films released (though at least two others are in production or set to be released before the end of the year).\n\nNext time: we’re swapping out Nick Box for action director Louis DeStefano’s take on the material with Amityville Emmanuelle (2023)."
