        "text": "William Poe of Knock and Emmanuel Poe of Solsborough, county Tipperary, were older brothers of James Poe who founded the Harley Park family. From William Poe descend the Poes of Donnybrook. The male line of this branch died out in the latter half of the 19th century. From Emmanuel Poe descend the Poes of Solsborough and Riverston. In 1806 Reverend James Hill Poe, rector of Nenagh, county Tipperary, married Frances, daughter of William Poe of Donnybrook and in 1843 their eldest son, James Jocelyn Poe, married Jane Lovett, eldest daughter and sole heiress of John Bennett of Riverston, county Tipperary. In August 1850 the Donnybrook estate of over 500 acres in the barony of Upper Ormond was advertised for sale, the estate of William Parsons Poe. At the time of Griffith's Valuation the Donnybrook estate was in the parish of Ballymackey, barony of Upper Ormond, while James J. Poe held land in the parishes of Nenagh and Uskane, barony of Lower Ormond and James and John Poe held land in a number of parishes in the barony of Owney and Arra. In November 1852 the Solsborough estate of John Poe in the baronies of Lower Ormond and Owney and Arra was advertised for sale. Messers. Abraham, Bolton (in trust), Molloy, Phillips and Tisdall were the purchasers. Lands belonging to Samuel Poe and members of the Tuthill family at Garrykennedy were sold in the Landed Estates Court in February 1869 to Mr. Hayes. In the 1870s William Thomas Poe of Currraghmore, county Tipperary and Glenbane, county Laois, third son of the Reverend James H. Poe, owned 1,054 acres in county Tipperary. His brother James J. Poe of Riverston owned 86 acres and his cousin Henry H. Poe of Solsborough owned 314 acres in the same county."
