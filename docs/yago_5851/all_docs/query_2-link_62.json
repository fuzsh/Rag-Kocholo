        "text": "BAY CITY, MI — Richard “Rick” Steele II put others first and loved his family, say those who knew him.\n\n“He was a family guy. He loved his kids for sure,” said Richard Steele, Rick’s father.\n\nRick Steele died after a long battle with melanoma on Saturday, April 4, at his home in Bay City. He was 52.\n\nThe father and son duo were best friends. They saw each other every day to run the family business, Penzien-Steele Funeral Home in Bay City, where Rick Steele was partner and vice president. The son began working alongside his father in the business at the age 12.\n\n“He was always happy”, Richard Steele remembers.\n\nRichard is grieving two losses. His wife, Barbara L. Steele died the day before his son on Sunday April 3, from dementia.\n\n“I’m kind of numb,” Richard Steele said. “It’s kind of hard to absorb it all. We knew that Rick was not going to get better. But we didn’t expect Barb to... well we knew she wasn’t going to get better from dementia, either, but we didn’t know that was going to happen now.”\n\nBarbara L. Steele was living at an assisted living home and over the last three weeks, no one could visit her because of visitor restrictions to try to curb the spread of coronavirus.\n\nBefore she died, Richard Steele got to see his wife on the last day she was alive.\n\n“She was a very kind and generous person. And happy and smiling,” Richard Steele said of his wife of 53 years.\n\nMarie Steele, Rick Steele’s wife, married her husband 22 years ago at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Disney was truly a magical place for the family, who continued to visit the theme park after the couple’s two children were born.\n\n“That was the most fun in our lives, was going there,” Marie Steele said as she spoke through tears.\n\nShe recounted her husband’s excitement for the “Pirates of the Caribbean” ride. By the second visit to Disney, Rick Steele had ridden the attraction over 20 times.\n\nThere were other family adventures that Marie Steele vividly remembers, such as setting out to visit 50 states before the kids graduated high school, but the one quality she admired most was Rick Steele’s selflessness.\n\n“He was a person that really wanted to help others,” Marie Steele said. “He didn’t want anyone to help him, but he wanted to help others all the time when his friends would call.”\n\nMichael Bacigalupo and Rick Steele met some years ago. As Rick Steele’s health declined, he would ride with Bacigalupo to Bay City Morning Rotary club meetings or wherever he needed to go.\n\nRick Steele worked as long as he could. Last summer, he became legally blind from more health complications related to his cancer.\n\n“He was a fighter,” Bacigalupo said. “The thing I admire about him was him getting up in the morning, getting in my car and, having a joke as soon as he got in the car and we would laugh all the way to wherever we were going to go.”\n\nRick Nelsen met Rick Steele decades ago as the two were both preparing to get married. Nelsen said he would miss the friendship the pair had.\n\n“I’m going to miss him not being around,” Nelsen said. “I lost my buddy. I don’t have that now.”\n\nRick Steele is survived by his wife, Marie; children Morgan and Dylan; father Richard C. Steele and brother John.\n\nA private family service will be held with the Rev. Kevin C. Jones and the Rev. Chris Garcia officiating. Burial will be at Fremont Cemetery, 1035 E. Hotchkiss Road.\n\nVisiting hours and a memorial service will be held after the COVID-19 restrictions for social gatherings are lifted.\n\nRelated news:\n\nOwner of Bay City’s Kramer’s South End Grocery dies at 89"
