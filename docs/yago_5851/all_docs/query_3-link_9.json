        "text": "James C. Poe went to be with his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, Feb. 19, 2022 in Odessa, Wash., with his wife Vivianne by his bedside. He was born in Denver, Colo. to James O. and LaVera Poe. He became a Christian in his early twenties.\n\nHe loved young people and always tried to encourage them to be the best they could be. James saw a person's highest potential even if they didn't see it themselves and treated them as such. Adventure was in his blood as he traveled to several countries and all the states except Hawaii.\n\nJames had two sons from his first marriage. In 1994 he met the love of his life Vivianne. After they married in 1995, they moved to Jerome, Ariz., where he was very involved in the community. He worked in retail and also volunteered on the Jerome fire department auxiliary along with Vivianne.\n\nHe loved God, his family and his fellow man. His love for the youth was amazing. He spent a lot of his time at junior high and high school games at Soap Lake and Odessa. He went to the football practices in Odessa, which were pretty much right outside his back door. He volunteered in the AG and FFA programs in Soap Lake and Odessa and also volunteered in those communities during events. James was a good storyteller, as all his family will attest. He also liked his quiet space where he just enjoyed being by himself to meditate. His smile was contagious, his hugs were heartwarming, he was a friend to all and he will be greatly missed.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents James O. and LaVera Poe. James is survived by his loving wife Vivianne Poe; two sons Stephen Poe and Matthew (Lisa) Poe both of Arizona, three stepsons, Earl (Jenny) Jones, Michael (Sonia) Jones and James (Kelly) Jones; three stepdaughters Cynthia (Mark) Harp, JoAnn (David) Acord all of Washington and Tamara (Jim) Flaherty of Texas; two brothers Mark (Sharron) Poe of Kansas and John Poe of Washington; two sisters Hilda (Greg) Perez of California and Naomi (Bill) Watts of Kansas; one brother-in-law Kim (Robin) Katzer of Washington; four grandchildren, 16 step-grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and five step-great-grandchildren and several nieces and nephews."
