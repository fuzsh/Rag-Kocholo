        "text": "Hello, Creeps! (If I may borrow Peter Lorre’s Creeps by Night catchphrase…) This is an old movie blog that occasionally flirts with radio. But this year I decided to do something different. Why not combine my two vintage passions into one spooktacular post?\n\nFor each day of October, I’m featuring a related pairing: a classic scary movie and an old-time radio episode. That way I can dispense Halloween horror movie recommendations and share my spooky OTR faves at the same time.\n\nEach radio-film pairing will have a theme. Many selections share source material or deploy a cherished plot trope, like evil twins or mad scientists. More creative combinations might highlight crossover stars, unusual structures, motifs, or even vaguely similar atmospheres.\n\nFor this Fear You Can Hear list, I tried to strike a balance between episodes I’ve featured before (the scariest of the scariest) and some new ones. I hope you find at least few that you’ve never listened to before.\n\nTo mix up the format, I’m adding a new radio-film paring, advent-style, day by day, until Halloween. (Don’t worry! I have my full list of 31 pairings picked out.) Pleasant dreams, hmmm?\n\n1. The Blood Is the Life\n\nNosferatu (F.W. Murnau, 1922)\n\n“Dracula” from The Mercury Theater (Aired July 11, 1938)\n\nLet’s start with 2 classic interpretations of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. An unauthorized adaptation barely saved from the flames of legally-mandated destruction, Murnau’s Nosferatu remains the scariest film version of novel—complete with plague-carrying rats, ghostly negative-footage forests, and Max Schreck as the most repellent vampire in cinema history. Orson Welles’s radio adaptation, starring himself as the Count (naturally), is enough to give you goosebumps too. The things that radio could get away describing were often far gorier and kinkier that movies could show…\n\nhttps://ia902707.us.archive.org/15/items/OrsonWelles-MercuryTheater-1938Recordings/MercuryTheater38-07-11Dracula.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can stream Nosferatu on Fandor.\n\n2. Brain Drain\n\nThe Monster (Roland West, 1925)\n\n“The Kettler Method” from Suspense (Aired September 16, 1942)\n\nMad scientists run amok in this radio-film double feature. Alternately playing the affable host and snarling like a rabid dog, Lon Chaney seems to be having a grand old time as the demented Doctor Ziska in The Monster. To the surprise of no one, the good doctor has grisly plans for any soul unfortunate enough to stumble upon his old dark sanitarium on a stormy night. From the long-running prestige radio program Suspense, “The Kettler Method” dramatizes a similar scenario of fearful experiments in a secluded asylum. Warning: If you have a doctor appointment in the near future, you might want to skip today’s pairing!\n\nhttps://ia600500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_420916_012_The_Kettler_Method_-128-44-_28076_29m51s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nThe Monster is available on DVD from Warner Archive. (Ahem, you might also be able to find it around the internet…)\n\n3. City of Frights\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera (Rupert Julian, 1925)\n\n“Ball Paris Macabre” from Lights Out (Aired March 9, 1943)\n\nParis may seem romantic, but just you try walking home after midnight! Even busy streets fall silent, as if the locals want to avoid the ghosts that rove the streets. There’s something inherently menacing about such a historically blood-soaked city. As the red-robed Phantom of the Opera declares to masked revelers, “Beneath your dancing feet are the tombs of tortured men—thus does the Red Death rebuke your merriment!” The spectacular, never-surpassed silent adaptation of Gaston Leroux’s novel is a must-watch for me each Halloween season. Lon Chaney’s face launched at least a thousand nightmares.\n\n“Paris Ball Macabre” also evokes the city’s dark, haunted ambiance with a masquerade ball. In this Lights Out ghost story, two cocky American college boys score tickets to a very strange party. The nature of the somber, oddly-dressed dancers probably won’t shock you, especially if you’ve heard of the 18th century bals des victimes. However, the dramatic irony climaxes beautifully as our clueless dudes’ annoying patter succumbs to abject terror.\n\nhttps://ia600205.us.archive.org/34/items/LightsOutoldTimeRadio/LightsOut-1943-03-09BallParisMacabre.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nWatch The Phantom of the Opera on archive.org.\n\n4. Dangerous Mesmerists\n\nThe Magician (Rex Ingram, 1926)\n\n“Narrative About Clarence” from Suspense (Aired March 16, 1944)\n\nIn Rex Ingram’s silent thriller, loosely based on the exploits of Aleister Crowley, a beautiful sculptress falls under the spell of a sinister hypnotist (Paul Wegener of The Golem). With a wild fantasy sequence of debauched pagan revels and a climactic set piece in a spooky tower fortress, this underseen gem deserves to be better known among classic horror fans. (And keep an eye out for young Michael Powell, the film’s assistant director, as a man with a balloon in the carnival sequence.)\n\nLaird Cregar plays another hypnotist with dastardly plans in Suspense’s chilling “Narrative About Clarence.” Cregar’s lulling, cultured voice has never been used to such terrifying effect. Without giving too much away, I’ll note that, whereas classic horror movies usually end with the triumph of good over evil, radio was often more pessimistic.\n\nhttps://ia800500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_440316_083_Narrative_About_Clarence_-128-44-_27815_29m34s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nThe Magician is available on DVD from Warner Archive. (You may also be able to find it around the internet.)\n\n5. Carnie Vengeance\n\nThe Unknown (Tod Browning, 1927)\n\n“The Marvelous Barastro,” from Suspense (Aired April 13, 1944)\n\nIn this radio-film paring, jealousy, passion, and false identity all intertwine in carnivalesque settings. As a teenager, Tod Browning ran away to join a circus. His life among the carnies would later infuse the films he directed and fuel his obsession with his outsiders and anomalies, both physical and psychological. With its seedy carnival milieu and freakish body horror, The Unknown is peak Browning. Lon Chaney gives one of the most intense screen performances (and that’s saying something!) as a criminal pretending to be an armless knife-thrower in a circus. What extremes will he go to in order to hide his identity from the woman he loves? Well, those extremes are pretty… extreme. Don’t say I didn’t warn you!\n\nThe horror in “The Marvelous Barastro,” based on a story by the great Ben Hecht, is subtler but no less devastating. Orson Welles brings gravitas and controlled fury to the role of a carnival magician seeking to kill the man who stole his identity for a depraved purpose.\n\nhttps://ia600500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_440413_087_The_Marvelous_Barastro_-128-44-_27997_29m46s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can stream The Unknown on FilmStruck.\n\n6. Carmilla, Revamped\n\nVampyr (Carl Theodor Dreyer, 1932)\n\n“Carmilla” from Columbia Workshop (Aired on July 28, 1940)\n\nThese two adaptations of Carmilla, J. Sheridan Le Fanu’s influential novel about a female vampire, share a melancholy, nightmarish ambiance. Dreyer’s Vampyr spins a web of dread from mists, shadows that take on a life of their own, and the tormented performance of Sybille Schmitz. Columbia Workshop’s rendition is a less ambiguous but still haunting brew of deadly nightshade, broody piano music, and the sensual malice voiced by Jeanette Nolan.\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/C%20Series/Columbia%20Workshop/Columbia%20Workshop%2040-07-28%20Carmilla.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can stream Vampyr on FilmStruck.\n\n7. Hexes from Exes\n\nWhite Zombie (Victor Halperin, 1932)\n\n“The Warning” from The Weird Circle (Aired in the 1940s)\n\nStalky rejected suitors are the all-too-plausible monsters in these fantastic stories of the walking dead. Sure, Bela Lugosi is super-creepy in White Zombie as a lecherous bokor, or zombie-making Voodoo sorcerer. But he’s tied for loathsomeness with the heroine’s “friend” who wants to turn her into a zombie rather than see her marry somebody else. “The Warning” features a similar motive for occult villainy. A spurned landowner devises an elaborate plan to lure the object of his desire towards his secluded castle, guarded by enslaved dead men.\n\n(Shoutout to Awake at Midnight for making me aware of this excellent episode from an often lackluster series.)\n\nhttps://ia800404.us.archive.org/31/items/OTRR_Weird_Circle_Singles/Weird_Circle_4x-xx-xx_ep55_The_Warning.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nWatch White Zombie here.\n\n8. Wax Murderers\n\nMystery of the Wax Museum (Michael Curtiz, 1933)\n\n“A Night in the Waxworks” from Beyond Midnight (Aired January 31, 1969)\n\nWax museums are scary. This is not up for debate. Radio and cinema have milked the motif of wax museums for all they’re worth, and here are two of the finest examples. In Mystery of the Wax Museum, a brassy lady reporter investigates the striking resemblance between figures in a new wax museum and people who’ve recently died under suspicious circumstances. While I also love the Vincent Price vehicle House of Wax, this earlier Warner Brothers version gives us Fay Wray shrieking, Glenda Farrell hunting down baddies, and a ghoulish two-color Technicolor palette of fleshy pinks, lurid corals, and sickly greens. In “A Night in the Waxworks,” a cocky reporter must steel his nerves when he bets he can spend a night among the murderers in a famous wax museum. But they’re just inanimate figures. They can’t do any harm… or can they?\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/B%20Series/Beyond%20Midnight/Beyond%20Midnight%2069-01-31%20(14)%20A%20Night%20In%20The%20Waxworks%20aka%20Waxwork.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nWatch Mystery of the Wax Museum at the Internet Archive.\n\n9. Ghosts of the Great War\n\nThe Black Cat (Edgar Ulmer, 1934)\n\n“Angel of Death” from Nightfall (Aired on February 11, 1983)\n\n“Are we not the living dead?” So speaks Karloff to Lugosi in The Black Cat, referring to their shared trauma inflicted by the horrors of World War I. This lurid revenge melodrama, with its gallery of embalmed wives, Satanic rituals, and stark Bauhaus Gothic art direction, is surely one of the darkest and most twisted movies ever produced by classic Hollywood. (It’s also my favorite film. I wrote a bit more about it here.) By contrast, “Angel of Death” is a fairly subdued episode for the no-holds-barred Canadian horror series Nightfall. Yet, it has managed on multiple occasions to send a shiver up my spine with its eerie premonitions and evocations of the Great War’s maddening carnage. After learning that her brother has been killed in action, a young girl begins to have visions of his return. Has the spirit of her brother come home? Or is she hallucinating like her long-dead mother, who insisted that the Angel of Death had taken up residence in the attic?\n\nhttps://ia802707.us.archive.org/35/items/Nightfall-cbcRadioProgram-episodesMp3Format/Nightfall_CBC_83-02-11_19_Angel_of_Death.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Black Cat to stream on Amazon.\n\n10. Boxed In\n\nThe Crime of Doctor Crespi (John H. Auer, 1935)\n\n“Final Resting Place” from Macabre (Aired in 1961)\n\nIf you suffer from severe claustrophobia, you might want to avoid tonight’s radio-film double feature. In the short and squirmy shoestring-budget thriller The Crime of Doctor Crespi, deliciously maniacal doctor Erich von Stroheim conspires to have his romantic rival buried alive. Universal horror fans will enjoy seeing Dwight “Renfield” Frye play the good guy for once. In “Final Resting Place,” a cash-strapped young bridegroom agrees to be buried alive for a lucrative carnival stunt. He’ll certainly earn his money’s worth. Both the movie and the radio episode vividly recreate the panicked, helpless perspective of a man sealed in a coffin.\n\nhttps://ia802205.us.archive.org/24/items/Macabre_35/Macabre611113-1FinalRestingPlace403.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nWatch The Crime of Doctor Crespi on YouTube.\n\n11. Peter Lorre Loses His Sh*t\n\nMad Love (Karl Freund, 1935)\n\n“The Horla” from Mystery in the Air (Aired on August 21, 1947)\n\nWhether on film or radio, classic horror offers few pleasures to equal an incandescent Peter Lorre freakout. The great actor could be lovable or despicable, funny or tragic, but I most admire the way he could fearlessly rip into a nervous breakdown. In the rampantly perverse Mad Love, gifted surgeon Lorre lusts after a Grand Guignol actress and hatches an elaborate scheme to drive her husband mad after a hand transplant. That said, her husband is Colin Clive, so he was never really too far from the edge. And it doesn’t help that hubby’s new hands came from a guillotined murderer. (Creepy side note: Clive died 2 years after Mad Love, and Lorre was one of his pallbearers.)\n\n“The Horla,” adapted from Maupassant’s hauntingly ambiguous tale, finds Lorre fretting over an invisible being that he insists is trying to dominate him, body and soul. Needless to say, both plots in today’s program conclude with our Peter erupting into spectacularly entertaining hysterics. In the radio episode, he continues his theatrics even after the end of the story, leaving the audience to wonder if the star had finally snapped!\n\nhttps://ia802708.us.archive.org/6/items/MysteryintheAir/Mita_470821_ep08The_Horla.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Mad Love to stream on YouTube.\n\n12. Watch Out for Her Claws\n\nCat People (Jacques Tourneur, 1942)\n\n“Cat Wife” from Lights Out (Aired on April 6, 1938)\n\nNote: The 1938 broadcast of “Cat Wife” was a repeat of a script that originally aired in 1936. I chose this version because Boris Karloff plays the husband.\n\nIt’s my suspicion that we can indirectly thank “Cat Wife” for the existence of Cat People—written to fit an audience-tested title that RKO provided to Val Lewton and DeWitt Bodeen. Why did such a goofy horror title test well? Possibly because “Cat Wife” had been a hit on Lights Out a few years prior. In this episode, Boris Karloff’s vituperative rebukes and heartrending lamentations add class to the gory and fundamentally silly tale of a no-good wife who transforms into a feline after her husband compares her to an alley cat. By contrast, Cat People is a noirish masterpiece of elegant psychological horror. Rather than grossing us out with gouged eyes and bloody carcasses, Tourneur and Lewton’s film scares us by invoking the primal urges that rattle the not-so-escape-proof cages of our rational minds.\n\nhttps://ia800205.us.archive.org/34/items/LightsOutoldTimeRadio/LightsOut-1938-04-06CatWifeborisKarloff.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Cat People to stream on Amazon.\n\n13. Devil’s Bargains\n\nLa Main du Diable (Maurice Tourneur, 1943)\n\n“The Fall of Gentryville” from CBS Mystery Radio Theater (Aired on March 5, 1979)\n\nNo film about selling your soul to the devil ever felt quite so damned as La Main du Diable. The story is basically a variation of Stevenson’s “The Bottle Imp.” Loser artist Roland Brissot buys a cursed hand that endows him with extraordinary talent. The catch? He has to sell it before he dies—or spend all eternity in the inferno. Made for a German-controlled company during the Vichy regime, this supernatural tragedy’s devouring guilt reflects not only the protagonist’s fictional sins, but also the real-life devil’s bargain that spawned the film. You can read the crushing dread and the self-loathing humor of the damned in Tourneur’s florid shadows and Pierre Fresnay’s wild-eyed performance.\n\nIn “The Fall of Gentryville,” puzzled reporters try to find out what happened to a little town that vanished without a trace, as if the ground swallowed it up. The only surviving resident, a traumatized young woman, unravels a horrifying tale of temptation and betrayal. This episode takes its time building atmosphere, but works up to a shocking fever pitch of visceral terror that’s all too plausible. It may be the darkest tale ever told on the long-running CBS Mystery Radio Theater series.\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/C%20Series/CBS%20Radio%20Mystery%20Theater/cbsrmt_0959_the_fall_of_gentryville.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nStream La Main du Diable on FilmStruck.\n\n14. Occult Paranoia\n\nThe Seventh Victim (Mark Robson, 1943)\n\n“The Man in Black” from The Hall of Fantasy (Aired on July 6, 1953)\n\nTonight’s film and radio program both conjure up that sense of being pursued in a nightmare, of trying to outrun a shapeshifting threat that lurks behind every corner. In Val Lewton-produced thriller The Seventh Victim, a young girl goes in search of her beautiful but troubled sister and stumbles onto a malevolent cult. “The Man in Black” comes from the typically excellent series The Hall of Fantasy, which seemed to specialize in get-under-your-skin ambiance and shocking endings. In this episode, two friends out on a nighttime walk meet a woman gibbering about a dangerous man in black. When they make the mistake of trying to solve the mystery, the pair find themselves menaced by a shadowy supernatural being.\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/H%20Series/Hall%20Of%20Fantasy/Hall%20of%20Fantasy%2053-07-06%20(33)%20The%20Man%20in%20Black.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Seventh Victim to stream on Vudu.\n\n15. Werewolf Whodunits\n\nThe Undying Monster (John Brahm, 1942)\n\n“Taboo” from Escape (Aired December 3, 1947)\n\nIn tonight’s frightful double-feature, werewolves are less tragic heroes (like poor Larry Talbot in The Wolf Man) and more mysterious, bloodthirsty killers to be unmasked. “Taboo,” a Geoffrey Household adaptation from the exciting “high adventure” series Escape, centers on a pair of hunters as they set a trap to catch the human beast responsible for a series of disappearances in the Carpathian mountains. The Undying Monster clocks in at just over an hour, yet John Brahm fills this underrated 1940s chiller with enough mist and fear and Gothic secrecy to satisfy the most diehard classic horror fans. In this odd mixture of early forensic science and supernatural terror, a detective and his comic assistant investigate the legendary werewolf of Hammond Hall after the family heir and a village girl are violently mauled.\n\nhttps://ia800606.us.archive.org/15/items/OTRR_Escape_Singles/Escape_47-12-03_-017-_Taboo.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Undying Monster on Amazon.

The Ghostess with the Mostess\n\nThe Uninvited (Lewis Allen, 1944)\n\n“The Stranger in the House” from The Mysterious Traveler (Aired on January 29, 1952)\n\nI like my ghosts malevolent (in fiction at least!), and the manipulative female specters haunting picturesque houses in tonight’s double feature certainly fit the bill. Without giving too much away, I’ll just note that endings of the two similar ghost stories differ greatly in terms of cheeriness.\n\nIn “The Stranger in the House,” a young wife suspects that her husband is falling in love with the spirit of a murderess who haunts their historic Vermont home. Can she break the spell before it’s too late? On the melancholy Cornish coast of The Uninvited, another dream house lures out-of-towners into peril and a web of deadly secrets. Lovable siblings Rod and Pamela buy the old Meredith place only to find that it’s filled with baleful cold spots and sobbing in the night. The house also calls to the daughter of its previous owner, the dreamy, sheltered Stella, who senses the spirit of her mother lingering in the house. But does the house really welcome Stella… or does it want to destroy her? And why?\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/M%20Series/Mysterious%20Traveler,%20The/Mysterious%20Traveler%201952-01-29%20Stranger%20in%20the%20House.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Uninvited on Blu-ray from Amazon.

Premature Burials\n\nIsle of the Dead (Mark Robson, 1945)\n\n“Fall of the House of Usher” from Escape (Aired on October 22, 1947)\n\nOkay, so I already did a double-feature about being buried alive. But that program (day 10) had a gritty modern flavor, whereas tonight’s radio-film pairing takes the trope back to its ghastly Gothic heyday in horror. Poe’s “Fall of the House of Usher” could’ve been written for radio, given the vividness of its language and the narrative importance of sound. Escape’s adaptation amplifies the tale’s darkest overtones, emphasizing Roderick Usher’s creepy, incestuous obsession with his sister and making her entombment seem less of an accident and more of a premeditated coverup.\n\nIn underrated Val Lewton horror Isle of the Dead, a mismatched cast of characters find themselves trapped by quarantine on a Greek island during the Balkan Wars of 1912. As a plague claims more and more lives, superstitious paranoia threatens to destroy an innocent woman accused of being a parasitic demon. Believe me, even if you think you know where this movie is going, you still have a few scares in store. And if you don’t believe me, believe Martin Scorsese, who lists Isle of the Dead as one of the scariest films ever.\n\nhttps://ia600606.us.archive.org/15/items/OTRR_Escape_Singles/Escape_47-10-22_-011-_The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can stream Isle of the Dead on FilmStruck.\n\n18. Mobius Strips\n\nDead of Night (Various directors but it’s Cavalcanti’s show, 1945)\n\n“The House in Cypress Canyon” from Suspense (Aired on December 5, 1946)\n\nDead of Night is a British anthology horror film about a group of people at a country house telling ghostly tales, varying in tone and content from the quaintly funny to the unforgettably disturbing. In “The House in Cypress Canyon,” one of Suspense’s strangest and spookiest episodes, a happy couple discover that a closet in their newly-built little house harbors an otherworldly and infectious evil.\n\nSo… what do these two have in common? Without veering into spoiler territory, let me say that both the film and the radio episode add to their uncanny impact with recursive endings. The way they loop in upon themselves proves that the mindf*ck, so beloved of modern horror and thriller movies, is by no means a new experience.\n\nhttps://ia800500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_461205_222_The_House_in_Cypress_Canyon_-128-44-_28525_30m20s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nUntil Dead of Night gets a legit U.S. DVD or Blu (not counting collector’s items that cost a a third of your paycheck), you can watch it here.\n\n19. “Sure, I’ll Marry Vincent Price. What Could Possibly Go Wrong?”\n\nDragonwyck (Joseph Mankiewicz, 1946)\n\n“Fugue in C Minor” from Suspense (Rehearsal from June 1, 1944)\n\nI truly sympathize with the heroines of these horror-infused Gothic romances. On the one hand, the man they love is probably evil. On the other hand, he’s played by Vincent Price. Marrying a moody man with a track record of mysteriously dead wives is the relationship equivalent of wandering into a graveyard at midnight in a slasher movie. However, with his Renaissance angel profile and seductively cultured bearing, Price made audiences wonder whether becoming Bluebeard’s eighth wife might not be worth the trouble.\n\nRadio suspense mastermind Lucille Fletcher penned the deliciously creepy “Fugue in C Minor” for Suspense. Impressionable Victorian maiden Ida Lupino falls (understandably) for recently widowed Vincent Price after he passionately serenades her on his pipe organ.\n\nMaybe she should’ve listened to his two children who claim that their mother is buried among the pipes of that organ. Kind of a red flag, you know? In Dragonwyck, based on the Anya Seaton novel, sparks fly when imaginative farm girl Gene Tierney travels to Price’s haunted castle on the Hudson River to serve as his daughter’s governess. How convenient that his wife happens to drop dead soon after…\n\nhttps://ia800500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_440601_094_Fugue_in_C-Minor_-128-44-_27882_29m39s_REHEARSAL.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can purchase Dragonwyck on Blu-ray from Amazon. It is also currently streaming on YouTube.\n\n20. Lucille Ball vs. Serial Killers\n\nLured (Douglas Sirk, 1947)\n\n“Dime a Dance” from Suspense (Aired on January 13, 1944)\n\nIn both “Dime a Dance” and Lured, Lucille Ball plays a wisecracking taxi dancer who decides to do some sleuthing after her gal pal ends up dead. There’s a serial killer on the loose—and if she doesn’t catch him, she might turn out to be his next victim. Now, you could argue that neither the radio episode nor the film represents true horror. They’re more typically categorized as noirish mysteries or thrillers. However, the serial killer has become such a time-tested staple of modern horror that I wanted to include “Dime a Dance” and Lured on this list and acknowledge them as 1940s forerunners of giallo and slasher flicks.\n\nGiven the limitations imposed by censorship, it’s impressive just how much perversity this double feature manages to suggest. The radio episode, based on a Cornell Woolrich story, dwells on the murderer’s twisted post-mortem ritual. Lured amps up its horror credentials with a marvelously unhinged Boris Karloff performance and allusions to Charles Baudelaire’s poems about beauty enhanced by death.\n\nhttps://ia800500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_440113_074_Dime_a_Dance_-128-44-_27707_29m27s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Lured to stream on Amazon.\n\n21. Aliens That Came in from the Cold\n\nThe Thing from Another World (Christian Nyby, 1951)\n\n“Northern Lights” from Quiet, Please (Aired on January 30, 1949)\n\nA snowbound research base. Puzzled scientists. An extraterrestrial intelligence unleashed upon mankind. Those elements link tonight’s radio-film double feature. “Northern Lights” delivers one of radio’s most far-out premises, complete with singing caterpillars, time travel, alternate dimensions, and interplanetary imperialism. Despite the outlandishness of its plot, this Quiet, Please fan favorite strikes just the right note of cosmic terror and offers quite a few shivery moments, thanks to the inspired voice work of Ernest Chappell. By contrast, creature feature The Thing from Another World tackles the threat of alien interference with a never-a-dull-moment combo of action and suspense, enhanced by the isolation of its setting. Listen, my friends… then keep watching the skies.\n\nhttps://ia600301.us.archive.org/13/items/Quiet_Please/Quiet_Please_490130_085_Northern_Lights.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Thing from Another World to stream on YouTube and elsewhere.\n\n22. Spoiled Rotten Brats\n\nThe Bad Seed (Mervyn LeRoy, 1956)\n\n“The Good Die Young” from The Mysterious Traveler (Aired on February 27, 1944)\n\nI hope you’re ready to babysit two of the nastiest young ladies in classic horror! After all, where would the genre be without evil kids, hiding diabolical schemes behind angelic faces? In both the radio episode and the film, our bratty anti-heroines exude a cloying sweetness—when they want something—that only accentuates their rottenness.\n\nSince “The Good Die Young” aired in 1944, one wonders if it might’ve influenced William Marsh to write his novel The Bad Seed, quickly adapted for Broadway and then Hollywood. However, whereas the wicked stepdaughter in “The Good Die Young” inspires only loathing and annoyance, it’s difficult (for me at least) not to admire Patty McCormack’s fierce Rhoda Penmark just a little bit, if only for her sheer nerve and determination.\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/M%20Series/Mysterious%20Traveler,%20The/Mysterious%20Traveler%2044-02-27%20(013)%20The%20Good%20Die%20Young.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Bad Seed to stream on Amazon.\n\n23. From the Ghastly Imagination of M. R. James\n\nNight of the Demon (Jacques Tourneur, 1957)\n\n“Casting the Runes” from Escape (Aired on November 19, 1947)\n\nM. R. James is my favorite horror writer. His tales blend erudition and a stodgy academic flavor with expertly-paced suspense and traumatic glimpses of gore and ghouls. (“Lost Hearts” scarred me for life when I was a kid, but that’s neither here nor there.) In “Casting the Runes,” we meet every journal editor’s worst nightmare: Mr. Karswell, a man who takes rejection so badly that he’ll go to drastic lengths to slake his thirst for revenge. And conjure up demons. And delight in toying with his victims by sending them all sorts of supernatural terrors as part of a death-day countdown.\n\nNight of the Demon takes the central premise of the short story—a vengeful occultist who kills via runic symbols on a scrap of paper—and embellishes it with all manner of eccentric and frightening detours. Tourneur’s noirish bravura style builds vague unease throughout, making us feel perpetually disoriented and uncertain. The result is a zigzagging thriller that explores the limits of reason and forces us to confront the tenebrous enormity of what we don’t know. (Just ignore the silly rubber and/or papier mâché demon.)\n\nhttps://ia600606.us.archive.org/15/items/OTRR_Escape_Singles/Escape_47-11-19_-015-_Casting_the_Runes.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Night of the Demon to stream on Amazon.\n\n24. The Witch Is Back\n\nBlack Sunday (Mario Bava, 1960)\n\n“The Vengeful Corpse” from Inner Sanctum (Aired on September 12, 1949)\n\nThe reputation of Inner Sanctum rests more on the sneering, pun-happy intros of its host Raymond than the content of its stories. The show specialized in pulpy crime yarns with high body counts. While plotlines often evoked the supernatural, they tended to pull a Scooby Doo at the last minute and unmask humans with elaborate M.O.s. But you’ll get no such cop-out ending in “The Vengeful Corpse,” the grim tale of a young woman possessed by the spirit of a long-dead witch who’s out for blood. This standout episode pulls no punches.\n\nScream queen Barbara Steele plays another persecuted witch who returns from the grave to seek revenge in Black Sunday. Mario Bava’s first credited film as director stands as one of the great masterpieces of Gothic horror.\n\nhttps://ia600705.us.archive.org/3/items/OTRR_Inner_Sanctum_Mysteries_Singles/Inner_Sanctum__49-09-12_The_Vengeful_Corpse.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Black Sunday to stream on Amazon.\n\n25. Paranormal Investigations\n\nThe Haunting (Robert Wise, 1963)\n\n“Ghost Hunt” from Suspense (Aired on June 23, 1949)\n\nOne of Suspense’s most creative and influential episodes, “Ghost Hunt” anticipates the found footage horror subgenre with some deeply disturbing found audio. A cocky radio host decides treat his listeners to a broadcast from a haunted house. The recording survives… but he’s not so lucky. An excellent example of just how terrifying potent atmosphere and spellbinding acting can be sans gore, The Haunting is arguably the greatest film about a paranormal investigation.\n\nhttps://archive.org/download/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_490623_346_Ghost_Hunt_-128-44-_27968_29m44s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy The Haunting to stream on YouTube.\n\n26. Warlocks Arise\n\nThe Haunted Palace (Roger Corman, 1963)\n\n“The Devil Doctor” from The Witch’s Tale (Aired on January 8, 1934)\n\nDon’t you just hate it when you move into a house and find out that it was once the lair of a depraved sorcerer from another century who’s been biding his time and plotting a return to prey upon the living? That relatable scenario anchors tonight’s double feature. “The Devil Doctor” is a delicious entry in radio’s first horror anthology series, The Witch’s Tale. The full-blooded Gothic language makes this episode memorable—particularly the description of the warlock’s portrait—along with a rip-roaring damsel in distress finale. In The Haunted Palace, the scariest of Corman’s Poe cycle (there’s a lot of Lovecraft at work here too), Vincent Price plays the affable heir to a castle who’s being gradually possessed by his warlock ancestor. Price relished the campy, overwrought antics of many 1960s period horror flicks, but he’s dead serious in this one, delivering one of his most spine-tingling performances.\n\nhttps://ia601509.us.archive.org/21/items/TheDevilDoctorWitchsTale/The%20Devil%20Doctor%20-%20The%20Witch%27s%20Tale.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nLet’s just say you can find The Haunted Palace online if you’re looking for it…\n\n26. Fever Dreams\n\nKill, Baby, Kill! (Mario Bava, 1966)\n\n“A Ring of Roses” from CBS Mystery Radio Theater (Aired on January 18, 1974)\n\nDon’t try too hard to decode the hallucinatory, winding plots of tonight’s radio episode and film, both of which center on little girl ghosts that bring tragedy to those who encounter them. “A Ring of Roses” is a nightmare of hazy weirdness. There’s a twisted mother daughter relationship, rambling discussions about the material causes of paranormal phenomena, a cursed ring, a horrifying reenactment of corporal punishment, and a clueless couple stumbling through it all. Clunky? Well, a little. But the uniqueness and ambiguity of the tale have haunted me ever since I first listened to it. Mario Bava’s Kill, Baby, Kill! is more of a classic ghost story. Yet, its color palette of neutrals punctuated with eerie jewel tones, convoluted spiritualism, and the comparative uselessness of our apparent hero all conspire to throw us off balance. It’s one of my top 5 favorite horror films of all time.\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/C%20Series/CBS%20Radio%20Mystery%20Theater/cbsrmt_0013_ring_a_ring_of_roses.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Kill, Baby, Kill! to stream on YouTube.\n\n28. Mummy’s Day\n\nBlood from the Mummy’s Tomb (Seth Holt, 1971)\n\n“Whence Came You?” from Quiet, Please (Aired on February 16, 1948)\n\nBewitching lady mummies lure archaeologists to their doom in tonight’s radio-film pairing. “Whence Came You?” eschews the tired tropes of a classic mummy movie (curses! extensive flashbacks! forbidden love across the centuries!) in favor of slow-burning unease that culminates in claustrophobic—and cosmic—terror. In Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb, an archaeologist discovers the tomb of a powerful priestess. Years later, his beautiful daughter falls under the influence of the mummy’s spirit and uses her powers to wreak revenge. It’s one of Hammer’s best films, boasting a high body count, a compellingly mystical ambiance, and a darkly scorchingly performance from Valerie Leon.\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/Q%20Series/Quiet%20Please/Quiet%20Please%2048-02-16%20(037)%20Whence%20Came%20You.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Blood from the Mummy’s Tomb to stream on Amazon.\n\n29. Madness or Sanity? Dreams or Reality?\n\nLet’s Scare Jessica to Death (John D. Hancock, 1971)\n\n“The Yellow Wallpaper” from Suspense (Aired on July 29, 1948)\n\nTonight’s double feature of psychological horror centers on women coping with mental illness. Are the strange things that they hear and see mere phantoms of their troubled minds… or is there really some supernatural presence at work?\n\nI think Agnes Moorehead gave her finest Suspense performance in this mesmerizing adaptation of the “The Yellow Wallpaper,” Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s tale of a woman confined by her husband for unspecified reasons. Cut off from a normal existence and patronized by her jailer-spouse, the narrator begins to detect something moving behind the ornate wallpaper of her room…\n\nAs the horror genre was poised to explore new heights of graphic imagery and gore in 1970s, Let’s Scare Jessica to Death took a different approach to wriggle under your skin. Nothing can quite match its ambiance of crisp autumnal New England creepiness wedded to strung-out bohemian disillusionment. Recently released from an asylum, Jessica settles in a house with a quaint apple orchard. She doesn’t tell her husband and their hippie friend about the beckoning apparition she sees on the property. When a mysterious drifter chick seems to bring division and all manner of spookiness, Jessica must fight for her life while struggling to hold on to her sanity.\n\nhttps://ia800500.us.archive.org/26/items/OTRR_Suspense_Singles/Suspense_480729_300_The_Yellow_Wall-paper_-128-44-_27936_29m42s.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Let’s Scare Jessica to Death to stream on Amazon.\n\n30. They’re Coming for You in the Shadows\n\nDon’t Be Afraid of the Dark (John Newland, 1973)\n\n“The Shadow People” from The Hall of Fantasy (Aired on September 5, 1952)\n\nYou might find yourself sleeping with the lights on and stockpiling candles after tonight’s double feature of things that go bump in the night. “The Shadow People” may be the most disturbing story from The Hall of Fantasy and that’s saying something. Shadows lurk in every corner of our everyday lives. Darkness is inescapable, and so are the monsters here. In this episode, a vicious horde of spectral beings set out to destroy a young woman. They can only attack in darkness. However, it may not be so easy to stay in the light.\n\nIn Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark, one of the creepiest made-for-TV movies ever, a young wife makes the fatal decision to unseal a stopped-up fireplace in her new home. Little does she know that she’s unleashed a gang of demons who want to make her one of them. Again, they can only come for her in the darkness. But night must fall…\n\nhttp://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/H%20Series/Hall%20Of%20Fantasy/Hall%20of%20Fantasy%2052-09-05%20(03)%20The%20Shadow%20People.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can buy Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark to stream on YouTube.\n\n31. Don’t Dance on a Grave\n\nThe Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980)\n\n“Poltergeist” from Lights Out (Aired on December 16, 1936)\n\nNever disrespect the dead. Especially not when a winter wind blows and you have nowhere to escape to… In “Poltergeist,” three silly coworkers on Christmas vacation unwittingly dance on a grave and summon a murderous spirit. Stephen King has discussed his fondness for horror radio while growing up, so it wouldn’t surprise me if this Arch Oboler story of desecration and snowbound terror influenced The Shining. After all, isn’t it the story of a cursed place where arrogant revelers dared to dance over an ancient burial ground—and summoned all manner of horrors? And there are certain parallels between the frozen fates of Jack Torrance and the hapless heroines of “Poltergeist.”\n\nhttps://ia600205.us.archive.org/34/items/LightsOutoldTimeRadio/LightsOut-1936-12-16Poltergeist.mp3\n\nDownload here.\n\nYou can stream The Shining on Netflix."
