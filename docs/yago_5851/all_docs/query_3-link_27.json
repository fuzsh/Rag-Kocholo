        "text": "A Meaningful Experience\n\nWe go above and beyond to provide families with more unique personalized options for celebrating and honoring a loved one's life. We listen to your family's ideas, make thoughtful educated and affordable suggestions, and carry out every possible detail to ensure your loved one receives the most fitting tribute possible. Our wonderful team of professionals are courteous and sympathetic, taking great pride in what we provide with integrity, respect, and dignity.\n\nLocal Family Owned and Operated\n\nFor decades, the Wood family, who founded and continues ownership of Walnut Lawn Funeral Home, Ltd. DeGraffenreid-Wood-Crematory today, are available daily to honorably serve families. Walnut Lawn Funeral Home is not a corporation, or firm that bought a family name with owners who do not actually reside in the community, or a family-owned facility operated like a corporation. Our family is there to personally serve your family in our ONE location – “Our Family Serving Your Family with Tender Care during Tender Moments.”\n\nThe Veterans Funeral Home\n\nWe value the service of our veterans, active-duty troops, and first responders. We have long been regarded as the veterans' funeral home due to our knowledge of burial benefits; to obtain service records (DD214); and work cooperatively with military, fire, and police honor teams. We provide specific burial and cremation funeral packages with significant discounts as our thanks for your service.\n\nOwn and Operate On-site Crematory\n\nWe own and operate our on-site crematory in our funeral home itself, DIRECTLY supervising every step of the cremation process. A comfortable viewing room is available for identification or those who wish to observe the cremation process at any step. We have a very large selection of urns, fingerprint and cremation jewelry, and keepsakes.\n\nThe Best Service and Facilities at an Affordable Cost\n\nYou will find Walnut Lawn Funeral Home to be the best full-service funeral home choice at an exceptional value. Our services and ceremonies are truly extraordinary, and we will help you have the most meaningful personalized experience possible.\n\nOur facilities are beautifully decorated and comfortable that include: Small and large chapels to accommodate any size service; onsite crematory in our facility; and a designated reception area for special catered meals. Investment has been made in the nicest hearses and family SUV.\n\nWe offer several discounted cremation and burial packages to make planning easier with no hidden fees. We offer friendly payment options for reasonable budgets, including conventional forms - cashier’s checks, credit cards, and cash; verifiable insurance assignments; crowdfunding, and loans with payment plans.\n\nWe work with ALL cemeteries. Our team is very experienced in making arrangements for services in other areas of the United States and internationally.\n\nCommunity Outreach and Support Programs\n\nOur outreach service to our families and community include several programs: Our extensive online grief library; Live Well Silver and Gold Club, with opportunities for the next chapters in someone's life, especially for those who have lost a loved one; our annual candlelight memorial service offers families in our community a way to remember their loved one as well as comforting support during the holiday time."
