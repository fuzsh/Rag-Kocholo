        "text": "Roger William Corman\n\n(April 5, 1926 – May 9, 2024)\n\nThe great producer/director/cultural icon Roger Corman has passed away at 98. It might take us months to fully comprehend what a big deal that is.\n\nAs for me, I can remember exactly when Mr. Corman became part (a big fat part) of my Movie Life.\n\nEvery summer growing up, we’d head to Strawn, Texas, and stay a few weeks with my grandparents. Being a movie-collecting family, and this being the pre-home video 1970s, we would pack a 16mm projector and a stack of prints for the trip. One particular summer, when I was 10 or 11, one of the films that made the trek (in a Chevrolet station wagon) was Roger Corman’s Pit And The Pendulum (1961). (Budd Boetticher’s Buchanan Rides Alone was there, too.)\n\nStrawn is a tiny town of about 850 people — a couple hours West of Dallas. My grandfather, AG “Flint” McCullough, was a real cowboy — he trained cutting horses. My grandmother, Zelma McCullough, worked in Strawn’s lone grocery store. They were wonderful people.\n\nSummers in Strawn get really, really hot. And sitting under the window-unit air conditioner at my grandparents’ house, watching Pit And The Pendulum projected onto the bright white living room wall, was a nice way to beat the heat.\n\nI ran that print of Pit And The Pendulum several times over those three weeks — on one of those green Bell & Howell projectors some of us remember from high school. I can still hear its clicky purr mixed with the hum of the A/C. Can recall the brownish color of the slightly-faded ‘Scope print. (No telling what it looks like now.) And can still recite a lot of its dialogue.\n\nWatching that film so many times, I started to get a sense of how movies work. The power of cutting to a closeup. How the lack of light can be more impactful than the presence of it. Just what music can do. How widescreen (Panavision, in this case) can be used to startling effect. And on and on.\n\nThis sent me digging for any Corman movie I could find, which in those days meant learning his filmography and scouring the TV Guide, hoping to happen upon something. I read Ed Naha’s book on Corman over and over.\n\nRoger Corman not only taught me about movies, he taught me to love them. I really owe him an awful lot.\n\nDirected by Robert Stevenson\n\nProduced by Robert Sparks\n\nExecutive Producer: Samuel Bischoff\n\nScreen Play by Earl Felton & Harry Essex (& Paul Jarrico)\n\nBased on a story by Jay Dratler\n\nDirector Of Photography: Harry J. Wild, ASC\n\nFilm Editors: George Shrader & Frederic Knudtson\n\nMusic by Leigh Harline\n\nCast: Jane Russell (Linda Rollins), Victor Mature (Dave Andrews), Vincent Price (Lloyd Rollins), Hoagy Carmichael (Happy), Brad Dexter (Tom Hubler), Gordon Oliver (Mr. Drucker), Jay C. Flippen (Captain Harris), Will Wright (Mike Fogarty), Bill Welsh (Mr. Martin), Ray Montgomery (Desk Clerk), Colleen Miller (Mary), Robert Wilke (Clayton), Paul Frees (DA)\n\nMiss Jennifer and I marked the anniversary of our Las Vegas nuptials by taking a look at the Warner Archive DVD of The Las Vegas Story (1952). I’m a sucker for movies shot in Las Vegas, from this one to Ocean’s 11 (1960) to The Gauntlet (1977).\n\nThe picture was originally going to be The Miami Story starring Robert Ryan. Moving the locale to Las Vegas and incorporating the casino/gambling backdrop must’ve required a huge amount of work (0r re-work) — but that kind of tampering was a fairly common occurrence at Howard Hughes’ RKO. Of course, by the time shooting started in Vegas, Ryan was out and Victor Mature and Jane Russell were in.\n\nThe Las Vegas Story was shot in the Spring of 1951, with plenty of location work around Las Vegas, the Hoover Dam, Union Station, McCarran Field, the Naval Air base and the desert outside town. The Flamingo Hotel (where Jennifer and I stayed when we got hitched) doubles as The Fabulous here, where much of the action takes place. (The Flamingo’s full name back then was The Fabulous Flamingo.) Of course, they find a way to get Jane Russell in a bathing suit by the Flamingo pool.\n\nLinda Rollins (Jane Russell) and her husband Lloyd (Vincent Price) get off the train in Las Vegas, a town where she once lived.\n\nA few things quickly become obvious: Lloyd is in financial trouble, an insurance agent (Brad Dexter) is keeping an eye on Linda’s Cartier necklace, and Linda has a real history in Vegas — much of it centered around her old flame Dave Andrews (Victor Mature), who’s now a cop. You also wonder why in the world Price and Russell are married in the first place (something Price had trouble with during shooting).\n\nLloyd thinks he’s gonna get himself out of hot water at the dice table, and Linda’s necklace is quickly hocked to Clayton (Robert J. Wilke), owner of the casino where Linda once sang (accompanied by Hoagy Carmichael).\n\nThe next morning, Price is still broke, Wilke is dead and Russell’s diamond necklace is gone.\n\nAs things play out, there are a few songs, some terrific locations (Mature’s apartment is awesome), Jane Russell in an ultra-swank shower and a terrific supporting cast: Jay C. Flippen, Will Wright, Milton Kibbee, Paul Frees and Colleen Miller in her first film.\n\nIt’s all capped off with a crazy chase involving a helicopter and a 1941 Ford De Luxe station wagon (with the wood on the side). There’ve been several such sequences over the years (Shaft’s Big Score!, for instance), but this one was the first — and it must’ve been really something back in ’52. I’m sure Howard Hughes was really stoked about it.\n\nRKO got maximum publicity out of the $150,000 Cartier diamond necklace. According to RKO’s PR folks, it had 500 diamonds, weighed 200 carats and cost the studio $100 a day to insure. It was watched over by Sheriff Glen Jones.\n\nThe world premier of The Las Vegas Story was held at the Fremont Theater (on Fremont, naturally). Almost a decade later, Ocean’s 11 would have its premier in the same spot.\n\nDuring Hollywood’s “Red Scare,” writer Paul Jarrico refused to testify before the HUAC (The House Un-American Activities Committee) gang, so Howard Hughes had Jarrico’s name dropped from the credits of The Las Vegas Story. Jarrico sued (a civil suit), but because of the morals clause in his contract, he lost. Jarrico eventually headed to Europe, and Hollywood started hiring blacklisted writers without giving them credit for their work.\n\nThe Las Vegas Story is a cool movie — a bit mystery, a bit noir. The Vegas locales are a treat — the city looks nothing like this now. It moves at a quick pace and looks terrific thanks to DP Harry J. Wild.\n\nWarner Archive’s DVD looks good. Not great, but I had no complaints with it. It’s easy to recommend a movie like this, and I wish there were a hundred more just like it.\n\nDirected by Crane Wilbur\n\nProduced by C.J. Tevlin\n\nScreen Story & Screenplay by Crane Wilbur\n\nBased on the play by Mary Roberts Rinehart & Avery Hopwood\n\nDirector Of Photography: Joseph F. Biroc, ASC\n\nFilm Editor: William Austin, ACE\n\nMusical Score by Louis Forbes\n\nCast: Vincent Price (Dr. Malcolm Wells), Agnes Moorehead (Cornelia van Gorder), Gavin Gordon (Lt. Andy Anderson), John Sutton (Warner), Lenita Lane (Lizzie Allen), Elaine Edwards (Dale Bailey), Darla Hood (Judy Hollander), John Bryant (Mark Fleming), Harvey Stephens (John Fleming)\n\nAs a monster movie-loving kid growing up in the 1970s, as Halloween approached, I’d go through the TV Guide and newspaper with a fine-tooth comb, looking for the treats that would be running on the local TV stations (and if lucky, an area theater). Then with my roster all planned out, and armed with a plastic pumpkin full of candy, I’d sit down to watch as much of it as I could take in. (Bet I wasn’t the only one doing this.)\n\nOf course, it works nothing like that now. Tons of old monster movies can be plucked out of thin air through streaming services and YouTube. But for us hardcore collector nerds, who want to own something physical, and for those of us who demand that these things look as good (or better) than they did when they came out, Halloween works a tiny bit like it did back in the day — who’s putting out what on DVD and Blu-Ray as October 31st rolls around?\n\nOne of this year’s treats is The Bat (1959), now on Blu-Ray from The Film Detective. This is actually a picture I first caught during one of those Halloween movie marathons. And if only for the simple reason that it stars Vincent Price and Agnes Moorehead, it’s wonderful.\n\nIt’s not really a horror picture, but a murder mystery complete with all the necessary ingredients — a million bucks in stolen money, a murder or two, a shadowy figure called The Bat, Vincent Price in a laboratory (studying bats, ironically) and a mystery-writer-turned-sleuth (Agnes Moorehead) trying to get the bottom of it all. This was the fourth film adaptation of Mary Roberts Rinehart’s novel, which had also been turned into a play.\n\nThe Bat comes from a real sweet spot in Vincent Price’s career, as he became a true horror icon. He’d already done The Fly and its sequel, House On Haunted Hill and The Tingler. He’d soon kick off the Corman/Poe “cycle” with House Of Usher (1960). Price is a hoot in films like this, rarely taking himself too seriously. Agnes Moorehead is always a joy to watch, and she’s terrific here.\n\nCrane Wilbur’s screenplay and direction are pretty good, keeping things moving and letting the leads do their thing. As an actor, Wilbur is known for 1914 serial The Perils Of Pauline. As a writer, he gave us some really cool stuff, pictures like He Walked By Night (1949), House Of Wax (1953), Crime Wave (1954) and The Phenix City Story (1955).\n\nOne of the film’s biggest assets is the camerawork of Joseph Biroc — whose black and white work is always incredible, in pictures ranging from Sam Fuller’s Forty Guns (1957) to William Castle’s 13 Ghosts (1960) to Robert Aldrich’s Hush… Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964, he worked with Aldrich a lot). Biroc won an Oscar for The Towering Inferno (1974).\n\nThe Film Detective has done Biroc proud with this new DVD and Blu-Ray. Working from original 35mm elements, this thing looks gorgeous. I don’t know that the sharpness and contrast could be any better, and the 1.85:1 framing is perfect. Any lines and dirt have been cleaned up without any noticeable manipulation, and the audio is as clear as a bell.\n\nAlong with the spectacular transfer of the film itself, we’re treated to plenty of extras. The booklet contains an essay, “The Case Of The Forgotten Author,” about author Mary Roberts Rinehart and her source material for The Bat. There’s a featurette from Ballyhoo, “The Case For Crane Wilbur,” covering his long, varied career. Then there are nine radio shows featuring Price. They sound terrific and they’re very, very cool. Finally, there’s a feature-length commentary by Jason A. Ney.\n\nOverall, this is a fabulous package. The movie’s a lot of fun, and it’s presented flawlessly. The extras are top-notch, with the radio shows being a real bonus. The Film Detective folks are on a real roll these days. Highly, highly recommended."
