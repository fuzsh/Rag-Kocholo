        "text": "HOME\n\nEdward and Mary Poe baptized their son, Samuel Poe, at St. Marys Church, Nottingham, England, in 1659. This could be the Samuel Poe who died in Essex (Caroline) County, Virginia in 1725. It is likely that Simon Poe, Sr (1707/8 - 1793 Chatham County, North Carolina) was Samuels son. James Poe (c1740 Caroline County, VA - 1827 Fayette County, Alabama) whose wife was named Mary (c1755 - c1790) is mentioned as a son in the will of Simon Poe, Sr. Evidence indicates that James Poe was the father of John Poe, whose wife was Sarah Threet. John and Sarah moved to Saline (Grant) County, Arkansas from Fayette County, Alabama in 1852 along with relatives and neighbors.\n\nJohn Poe (1785-1859) and Sarah Threet (1794 - 1861)\n\nWilliam Threet Poe (1817-1884), wife Sarah Reynolds (1819-1861)\n\n.\n\nWilliam Elkin Poe 1852-1929) and Sarah Elizabeth Holiman (1855-1932) daughter of Joshua Holiman (1829-1892) and Lucretia Ann Hogue (1835-1908)"
