        "text": "I was a high school (Detroit Denby) and college (UofMich) colleague of Jim's. We were deeply saddened when he died. When I taught history at a college in Delaware in the 90's, some of my students went to the wall and copied his name. We discussed his life and the impact of the war. JIm is still remembered for his love of life and how it was cut too short."
