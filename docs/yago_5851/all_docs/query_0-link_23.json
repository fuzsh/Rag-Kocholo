        "text": "Info: Steele studied art at the Chelsea Art School and in Paris at the Sorbonne.\n\nGot sick of being typecast in horror movies.\n\nWas semi-retired from acting, and soon took to producing projects.\n\nSteele served as associate producer of the 1983 TV mini-series, The Winds of War, and was a producer for its 1988 sequel, War and Remembrance, for which she shared the 1989 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special with executive producer Dan Curtis.\n\nTrivia: She was the original female lead to Elvis Presley in Flaming Star (1960). She walked off the picture after an argument with director Don Siegel.\n\nShe was reportedly the last person to be signed as a contract player by the J. Arthur Rank Organization.\n\nInvited her friend, actress Jane Wald, to the United States during the 1960s. Upon visiting the 20th Century-Fox commissary, she was discovered by an independent producer.\n\nSteele was slightly injured by Vincent Price while filming her last scene from Pit and the Pendulum (1961) when he quite aggressively grabbed her by her throat - she shrugged it off because the scene came off so real.\n\nThe role of Alice LeBlanc in They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969) was written by James Poe--her husband--specifically for her, but the part went to Susannah York instead."
