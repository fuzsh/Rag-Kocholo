        "text": "James Warren Poe, II â€œleft the islandâ€ on April 11, 2019, at the age of 23 years old.\n\nJames was born December 16, 1995, in Valparaiso, Indiana to James and Zola Poe. The family relocated to Kentucky and James attended Hopkins County Central High School.\n\nJames played baseball, basketball, and football throughout elementary, junior high, and high school. His love for sports never faded. One of his favorite things to do was watching a game with fans of opposing teams so they could â€œtrash talkâ€ each other. The one thing that stood out the most about James was his love for his family. â€œFOEâ€ (Family Over Everything) tattooed on his arm, said it all.\n\nHe is survived by his son, Rhys Houston Poe Davis; father, James Warren Poe; mother, Zola Poe; sister and brother-in-law, Shantell and Ricky Farrow; sister and brother-in-law, Leslie and Matt Scott; sister, Jamie Faith; sister and brother-in-law, Marcie and Marcus Armes; sister and brother-in-law, Jennifer and James Mullins; sister and significant other, Jackie Poe and David Briscoe; brother and significant other, Justin Poe and Emilie Ables; sister, Isabella Poe; and numerous nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins, and countless friends.\n\nServices will be held Saturday, April 20, 2019, at 12:00 pm at Mason & Sons Funeral Home located at 409 E. Noel Avenue, Madisonville KY 42431. Visitation will be from 10:00 am until service time. James will be laid to rest at Westside Odd Fellows Cemetery located at 805 W. Center Street, Madisonville KY 42431. Condolences may be left at www.masonbrothersfs.com\n\nIf you or a loved one are having thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please seek help.
