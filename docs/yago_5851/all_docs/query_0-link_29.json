        "text": "Barbara Steele (born 29 December 1937) is an English film actress known for starring in Italian gothic horror films of the 1960s. She has been referred to as the \"Queen of All Scream Queens\" and \"Britain's first lady of horror\". She played the dual role of Asa and Katia Vajda in Mario Bava's landmark film Black Sunday (1960), and starred in The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), The Horrible Dr. Hichcock (1962), The Long Hair of Death (1964), and Castle of Blood (1964).\n\nAdditionally, Steele had supporting roles in Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963), David Cronenberg's Shivers (1975), and Louis Malle's Pretty Baby (1978), and appeared on television in the 1991 TV series Dark Shadows. She won a Primetime Emmy Award for producing the American television miniseries War and Remembrance (1988–1989). Steele appeared in several films in the 2010s, including a lead role in The Butterfly Room (2012) and supporting role in Ryan Gosling's Lost River (2014).\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nSteele was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire. She studied art at the Chelsea Art School and in Paris at the Sorbonne.\n\nCareer[]\n\nDuring the 1960s, Steele starred in a string of Italian horror films, including Black Sunday (1960), The Horrible Dr. Hichcock (1962), The Ghost (1963), The Long Hair of Death (1964), Castle of Blood (1964), Terror-Creatures from the Grave and Nightmare Castle (both 1965). She also starred in Roger Corman's adaptation of The Pit and the Pendulum (1961), based on Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same title, and the British film Curse of the Crimson Altar (1968).\n\nSteele guest starred in British television shows including the spy drama, Danger Man (aka Secret Agent) starring Patrick McGoohan in 1965. She made her American television debut in 1960 as Dolores in the \"Daughter of Illusion\" episode of the ABC series, Adventures in Paradise, starring Gardner McKay. In that same year, she was replaced by Barbara Eden in the Elvis Presley film Flaming Star after a disagreement with director Don Siegel. In 1961, she appeared as Phyllis in the \"Beta Delta Gamma\" episode of CBS's Alfred Hitchcock Presents. She also had an supporting role in Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963), and in 1966 appeared in the second-season episode of NBC's I Spy, \"Bridge of Spies\".\n\nSteele returned to the horror genre in the later 1970s, appearing in three horror films: David Cronenberg's Shivers (a.k.a. They Came From Within) (1975), Piranha (1978), and The Silent Scream (1979).\n\nSteele served as associate producer of the TV miniseries, The Winds of War (1983), and was a producer for its sequel, War and Remembrance (1988), for which she shared the 1989 Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama/Comedy Special with executive producer Dan Curtis.\n\nSteele was cast as Julia Hoffman in the 1991 remake of the 1960s ABC television series Dark Shadows. In 2010, she was a guest star in the Dark Shadows audio drama, The Night Whispers.\n\nIn 2010, actor-writer Mark Gatiss interviewed Steele about her role in Black Sunday for his BBC documentary series A History of Horror. In 2012, Gatiss again interviewed Steele about her role in Shivers for his follow-up documentary, Horror Europa. In 2014, she appeared in Ryan Gosling's directorial debut, the drama-fantasy thriller film Lost River, in which she portrayed the character Belladonna in a supporting role.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nSteele was married to American screenwriter James Poe. They were married in 1969 and divorced in 1978.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1958 Bachelor of Hearts Fiona 1959 Sapphire Student The Heart of a Man Girl Scenes deleted Upstairs and Downstairs Mary 1960 Your Money or Your Wife Juliet Frost Black Sunday Asa Vajda / Katia Vajda 1961 The Pit and the Pendulum Elizabeth Barnard Medina 1962 Il capitano di ferro Floriana The Horrible Dr. Hichcock Cynthia 1963 8½ Gloria Morin The Hours of Love Leila The Ghost Margaret 1964 The Long Hair of Death Helen Karnstein / Mary Karnstein I maniaci Barbara / Signora Brugnoli A Sentimental Attempt Silvia Castle of Blood Elisabeth Blackwood White Voices Giulia 1965 I soldi Unknown Cameo Nightmare Castle Muriel and Jenny Terror-Creatures from the Grave Cleo Hauff Once Upon a Tractor Short film 1966 L'armata Brancaleone Teodora The She Beast Veronica Young Törless Bozena An Angel for Satan Harriet Montebruno / Belinda 1968 Curse of the Crimson Altar Lavinia Morley 1974 Caged Heat Superintendent McQueen 1975 Shivers Betts 1977 I Never Promised You a Rose Garden Idat Scenes deleted 1978 Pretty Baby Josephine Piranha Dr. Mengers 1979 Silent Scream Victoria Engels 2012 The Butterfly Room Ann 2014 Lost River Grandmother 2016 Le Fantôme Unknown Short film 2016 Minutes Past Midnight The Apparition of the Mill\n\nTelevision[]"
