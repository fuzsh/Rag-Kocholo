        "text": "PART ONE. 1957 -1979.\n\nA two-part Halloween Special. In which we Highlight the importance of the Gothic Italian made horrors and the influence of the Italian Horror film. From the atmospheric sets of I Vampiri, to more contemporary and bloodletting content of Profundo Rosso and more. The Shocks. The Monsters, The Brutality, and the Grotesque, and Gore all appear alongside Witches, Werewolves, Zombies, Vampires, Creepy Castles,Ghosts, Dark Dank Dungeons and Mad and Demented villains. The scary stares of Barbara Steele, the moody directorial prowess of Bava and the blood-filled, shocking stories of Argento. Plus, the all-important support of an atmospheric musical score, by the likes of Morricone, Nicolosi, Piga, Cipriani, Rustichelli, De Masi, Nicolai, Gaslini, Micalizzi, and others.\n\nMovie Music International. Presents.\n\nLE PAURE, GLI SGUARDI, LE URLA E GLI ORRORI ALL’ITALIANA.\n\nWhen looking at the horror genre as produced by Italian filmmakers, there is a veritable smorgasbord of titles that in my opinion can easily be referred to as being classic cinema, not just because they are entertaining but also because they were innovative. In the fact, that movies like this did not really exist before Italian filmmakers started to produce them.\n\nThe earliest known Italian horror movie was released in 1920, a silent film that was directed by Eugenio Testa. Mostro Di Frankenstein, is now a movie that is lost or even worse destroyed. The film had the reputation of being the first and the last horror picture produced in Italy, until 1957 when filmmaker Riccardo Freda brought I Vampiri, to cinema screens.\n\nSo in a period of over thirty-five years the Italian film industry never ventured into the realms of the Gothic horror, which was mainly due to strict censorship that was operated and enforced by the fascists who were in power and the involvement of the Catholic Church. But in the decades that followed, Italian directors and producers certainly made up for lost time; and as the decade of the 1960s dawned we saw a landside of movies that were dark, sinister, and violent, all of which radiated that unmistakable Italian flavour and class.\n\nA film I would like to include is Uncle was a Vampire (1959) not because it is a particularly good movie but because I was curious as to why Christopher Lee decided to make an appearance in it and so soon after his success as Dracula in the first Hammer films outing for the count. Uncle was a Vampire was a horror comedy, but certainly leaned more towards the comedic side of things, and being an Italian movie, it was comedy that did not translate well to non-Italian audiences. Baron Osvaldo Lambertenghi is forced to sell his ancestral castle; when it’s converted into a hotel, he stays on as a bellboy. His mysterious uncle arrives and turns out to be a vampire. When his uncle vampirizes Osvaldo, the newly converted blood-sucker races about the castle sipping from the necks of dozens of beautiful female guests. So yes, a bit of a romp, which was directed by Steno, and had a score by Maestro Armando Trovajoli, so shall we move quickly on.\n\nBefore we go any further in this article, I think we should talk about the Giallo genre of movies, because many do confuse these moody, violent, and sensual affairs with being part of the horror genre, but there is a difference. In Italian cinema, Giallo, (Italian for yellow) is a separate genre of film that has in its collective movies focused upon murder-mystery- fiction, the storylines often contain references to slashers, with a decidedly thriller led plot that is combined with psychological horror and sexploitation. But less frequently leans towards the supernatural elements of a horror picture or indeed folklore surrounding these tales.\n\nFilms within the Giallo genre often mixed the atmosphere and suspense of thriller fiction with that of horror fiction, which often includes eroticism and are very much in the same vein as the Fantastique group of movies that were produced in France. A plot for a Giallo movie will mostly feature a mysterious killer whose identity is not revealed until the film’s climax, which adds to the already tense and smouldering narrative. The genre began to appear in the late sixties, and by the seventies was a staple of Italian produced cinema, with films such as Death Walks at Midnight, Bird with The Crystal Plumage, The Bloodstained Shadow, and The Case of the Scorpions Tail coming to mind instantly. But the appetite for these movies began to decline and they fell out of favour over the next ten to fifteen years, and by the mid-nineties, we saw fewer examples. Although saying this there were a handful of movies that did appear after this and are noteworthy.\n\nGiallo films were one of the main influences for popular American slasher films such as Scream and Friday the 13th. So Italian Horror and Italian Giallo are two different cinematic animals, but sometimes it is difficult to separate them as each contain elements of each other’s make up.\n\nThe Horror picture I Vampiri, may have been released first, and should be credited for being the film that started the Italian horror ball rolling with Seddok, l’erede di Satana-Atom Age Vampire and Giorgio Ferroni’s Mill of the Stone Women both making an appearance in 1960.\n\nBut it was not until nearly three years later in the early part of the sixties, when Mario Bava’s now iconic horror picture Black Sunday or The Mask of Satan that audiences began to realise that there was a new brand of horror available, and it was this one movie in my opinion that was responsible for stirring up an interest within cinema goers all over the world.\n\nAdapted from Nikolai Gogol’s VIY, Bava’s film focuses upon the resurrection of a 17th-century witch played by Barbara Steele, in her first major role. Over two hundred years after being executed for being a witch and a vampire, Princess Asa Vajda (Steele) is resurrected when two travellers, Prof. Thomas Kruvajan and Dr. Andre Gorobec, accidentally disturb her abandoned tomb.\n\nAt the time of her execution, the princess swore vengeance against her accuser, who was her brother, and all his descendants. The newly resurrected Princess quickly brings her lover back to life and turns Kruvajan into her vampire servant.\n\nWhen she learns that the present-day Princess Katia is identical to her, she sets out to get control of the young woman possessing her body to avenge her own death. It is an interesting plot, and one that is brought to the screen wonderfully by its director. It also became the blueprint of sorts for many horror films from Italy that would follow.\n\nMario Bava was a master at his craft creating tense and ethereal moments on screen via the black and white photography he utilised in the early days, the sets and the then simple but convincing effects worked marvellously. The director employing camera shots from odd angles, with lighting and staging playing a vital role in the look of his pictures. The Italian movie Maestro was far ahead of his British and American peers who leaned towards making movies about the macabre such as Hammer films and American International, his movies having a decidedly sinister and chilling persona about them.\n\nBava could create a foreboding and fearsome atmosphere by a puff or two of mist that laid and lingered on the floor of a dark wood, he also managed to achieve results by focusing upon the way in which a simple thing such as a tree was lit, and even achieved maximum frights from a piercing stare from an actor on screen. At times dialogue not being required as all the atmospherics and moods would be achieved visually.\n\nBut let us return to 1957 and I Vampiri, which is listed as the first ”sound” Italian horror movie, this project began as a collaboration between Riccardo Freda and Mario Bava, Bava being the cinematographer on the movie originally, but it is documented that Freda walked off set just ten days into the production, and after this Bava took the direction. Because he knew the movie was in jeopardy, Bava decided to simplify the narrative and edited it all together utilising stock footage. The film was based upon the story of Elizabeth Bathory, who is known as the world-famous real-life vampire.\n\nThe main character was portrayed by Miss Italy runner-up Gianna Maria Canale who played a recluse residing in a castle and who might have been linked to a series of murders, where the victims have been drained of blood. Freda’s vision fused contemporary settings and romantic period pieces throughout, with the production making effective use of lighting which casts shadows around the set and have a part in bringing to fruition the unsettling ambience.\n\nThe grandness of Canale’s castle is photographed beautifully and is a style that would be seen in many other Italian horrors that were to follow, The Mask of Satan, for example. I would even stick my neck out here and state that the style employed on I Vampiri is a stye that was built upon and developed as the genre grew. But many are of the opinion that because Freda left the production so quickly the success of the movie was all down to Bava. It was the pre-cursor to so many horror movies that were produced in Italy, and its influences are still being felt today in contemporary motion pictures. The score for I Vampiri, is the work of composer Roman Vlad, who created a suitably dramatic but at the same time apprehensive, romantic, and even subtle score. The music did have at times a Universal horror feel and sound to it, often the composer overworking the drama within the music, via brass and percussion that were carried and underlined by sharp or swelling strings, but it remains an effective work, and was released onto CD by the Digit-movies-label as part of a two disc set, the other score in this set being Caltiki which was scored by esteemed composer Roberto Nicolosi who worked with Bava on movies such as Mask of Satan.\n\nNicolosi’s style was well suited to the atmospherics and storylines of the Italian horror genre, it was romantically slanted and contained that element of drama and underlying sense of virulence. His scores although grand were also at times experimental, containing some electronic support, which in the late 1950’s and early 1960’s was pioneering in film music However, in the main his music was classically themed very much like the works of fellow Italian Maestro’s Angelo Francesco Lavagnino and Carlo Rustichelli.\n\nRoberto Nicolosi was born In Genoa Italy on November 16th, 1914. He initially was destined to be a dentist and graduated from university with a degree in medicine. But he was also attracted to music and showed a talent for jazz, so whilst studying medicine Nicolosi also undertook a course on music composition at the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory of music in Milan, from which he gained a diploma. Nicolosi, decided to enter the dentistry profession but after a few years he began to perform jazz music and during the 1940’s he became a popular performer at first performing on piano and then conducting and arranging for radio and recordings by other artists. The musician was a talented performer and was able to play, Trumpet, Vibraphone, Double Bass and Violin. During the mid to late 1940.s he re-located to Rome where he worked in nightclubs and the theatre as well as becoming a music critic. The composers break into writing for cinema came in 1954, when he scored a documentary entitled The Sixth Continent, which was directed by Folco Quilici.\n\nIt was during this period of his career that Nicolosi moved into scoring Epic movies that were produced in Italy sword, and sandal film being the popular title .often utilised strong and vibrant string led themes, which had a connection with Hollywood Biblical epics, he would augment and punctuate these with percussive elements and at times jarring musical stabs to heighten the drama alongside romantic and lush sounding leitmotifs as in Rome against Rome and Erik the Conqueror.\n\nBecause of the lack of information about the composer during the late fifties and into the sixties, many confused him with Bruno Nicolai, thinking that Nicolosi was an alias for Nicolai, of course this was not the case. Roberto Nicolosi passed away on, April 4th, 1989, but his music continued to be utilised in movies after his death as stock or library music.\n\nHowever, the U.S. release of Mask of Satan had a score by composer Les Baxter, which is something that distributor AIP used to do with Italian and some British movies during the sixties and seventies, (Cry of the Banshee is one such example, the original score by Wilfred Josephs being replaced). Baxter re-scoring many horror films and peplums to make them “More acceptable to American audiences”? A.I.P would also re-cut the movies and dispense with scenes that they thought to be surplus to requirement, or certain scenes that they knew would not be given the go ahead by the more restricting U.S. censors.\n\nOther examples of Bava films that were re-scored include, Black Sabbath (1963) and The Evil Eye also from 1963, the latter being more of a thriller than a horror.\n\nBlack Sabbath was released in Italy as I Tre Volti Della Paura, or Three Faces of Fear, the movie was an anthology that included three tales of the macabre as introduced by Boris Karloff. Nicolosi’s score for this movie included some jazz tracks as well as the dark and dissonant horror material. For years a watered-down edited version of the movie was the only print available to British audiences, which had been mercilessly cut by American censors.\n\nIn recent years a fuller Italian edit of the film became available, in which we see the true genius of filmmaker Bava. The anthology begins with The Telephone, which up until the release of this edit was thought to be the weaker episode of the trio. But here we can fully appreciate the sharp and cutting tension that the director builds and finally unveils. The whole episode is set within a small apartment and takes place during just one evening. The occupant is a rather wild young lady a good time girl or even a lady of the night as the storyline suggests in a very subtle way. And in that evening she is intimidated by a series of anonymous telephone calls, arguably one could say that this is probably where the idea of the opening scene of Scream came from so many years later.\n\nBava, gradually shapes the storyline and builds the tension as we see the woman at first becoming annoyed at the calls, with her turning to a more troubled mood, and eventually descending into sheer panic and uncontrollable terror.\n\nAlso released in 1963 was Mario Bava’s The Whip and the Body, which starred Christopher Lee and Dahlia Lavi. The nobleman Kurt Menliff (Lee) returns to the castle where he grew up which is located at the seaside, he returns to offer his congratulations to his brother Christian Menliff on his marriage to his former lover Nevenka (Lavi). Kurt feels the hatred and the fear of his father Count Menliff and the servant Giorgia, who blames him for seducing and killing her daughter, and indifference from his cousin Katia. On the next afternoon, the sadistic Kurt meets Nevenka riding a horse alone on the beach and whips the masochistic woman and makes love with her.\n\nNevenka goes missing and has everyone out looking for her. Then Kurt is stabbed in the neck with a dagger that Giorgia’s daughter was murdered with. The family members suspect each other of carrying out the murder, while Nevenka begins to be haunted by the ghost of Kurt. Again romance, intrigue, and horror, all underlined superbly by a truly haunting and concerto like sounding score by Carlo Rustichelli, that features the beautiful Windsor Concerto. Rustichelli also adds his trademark sounding organ to create maximum chills and mystery.\n\nThe music is available on a two CD set from Digit-movies, being paired with another Rustichelli score for another Bava horror /mystery entitled Blood and Black Lace which was released in 1964.\n\nThis I think is probably more of a Giallo than a straight horror, or at least has elements of both within it. Isabella (Francesca Ungaro) a young model is brutally murdered by a mysterious masked figure at a boarding house run by Max Morlan (Cameron Mitchell) and his lover Countess Christina Como (Eva Bartok).\n\nWhen Isabella’s boyfriend is suspected of the killing, her diary, which apparently has some incriminating evidence linking her to the killer, disappears. The masked killer then goes on a killing spree murdering the models in and around the house to find the diary.\n\n1963, also saw the return of Roberto Freda to the horror genre proper with his Lo Spettro aka The Ghost. The movie starred Barbara Steele, as a woman who with her lover murders her husband a doctor. But it is not long before strange things begin to happen, and the murderous couple start to wonder if they did kill him, or if these strange occurrences are being caused by him who has come back from the dead to punish them.\n\nAn effective if not predictable tale, Steele was again superb, and supported admirably by her leading men Peter Baldwin and Elio Jotta, the score is credited to Franco Mannino who worked primarily in the world of classical music but also scored several movies from 1949 through till 1981, he also collaborated with certain composers on various films providing additional music at times. However the score was actually the work of Maestro Francesco De Masi after the director of the movie decided that Mannino’s score was not right for the movie. But De Masi was not credited on the movie, but there is a full soundtrack compact disc on Digit Movies which does give Francesco De Masi full credit.\n\nTo 1964 now and a movie that is set in the 15th-century, where in a feudal village, a woman is accused of witchcraft and put to death. Her beautiful older daughter knows the real reason for the execution lies in the lord’s sexual desire for her mother. After confronting the lord on the matter, she, too, is killed. A much younger daughter is spared and taken in by her mother’s killers. Once she is of age, as a horrible, deadly plague sweeps the land, she marries the lord’s son. Then, during a brutal thunderstorm, the older daughter mysteriously reappears and begins to avenge her mother’s death.\n\nThat is the plot for Antonio Margheriti’s Il Lunghi Capelli del Morte (The Long Hair of Death), which is a similar tale of murder and resurrection which we see in Italian horrors. The film starred Barbara Steele doing what she did best, supported by George Ardisson. Written by Margheriti with Ernesto Gastaldi under the name of Julian Berry and Tonino Valleri as Robert Bohr. The music is again the work of Carlo Rustichelli and is in my opinion one of the Maestros best for the genre, of course he worked on many films all varying genres and was one of the most prolific Italian film music composers of the twentieth century.\n\nThe music for The Long Hair of Death, has to it a rich and theme led musical identity, with the composer realising his powerful and thematic score via symphonic means, although there are at times little nuances and minimal support from electronic elements such as theremin, that adds another dimension to the work.\n\nThe soundtrack was released onto compact disc in 2008 on the Digit Movies label. It was the first time that the score had been released, and the CD soon became deleted. But I have to say that this is an entertaining soundtrack and has a life musically away from the images on screen and certainly worth seeking out.\n\nStaying in 1964 and to a familiar figure in horror movies in the form of Christopher Lee, who had found fame in England with Hammer productions such as The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958), this time Lee plays the role of Count Karnstein in the Camillo Mastrocinque directed movie La Cripta e L’incubo or The Crypt of the Vampire, in which the Count sends for a doctor to help his sick daughter Laura.\n\nHer nurse believes she is possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor, Carmilla. The film is based upon the novel Carmilla by Sheridan Le Fanu, with this being the foundation for the tale unfolding on screen. A young woman becomes intrigued by the mysterious deaths surrounding Laura after a carriage accident outside the castle forces her to stay there. The two women become close friends until Laura becomes even more obsessed and convinced the spirit of Carmilla is forcing her to kill.\n\nMusic is by Carlo Savina, and although it is a tense and apprehensive sounding soundtrack, the composer adds glimmers of themes and romantic sounding passages, along the way and includes a lush and emotive love theme, the music is fully symphonic, with Savina including harpsichord flourishes and organ to create a shadowy and spidery effect.\n\nIl Castello dei Morti Vivi/Castle of the Living Dead, was also released in 1964. It starred Christopher Lee, and was directed by Warren Kiefer and Luciano Ricci. It had the tag line He lured beautiful women to his evil castle and induced them into a state of living death until infinity! Well whatever floats your boat I suppose. Count Drago (Lee) invites entertainers to his castle, but what the people don’t know is that Drago mummifies animals and humans.\n\nAgain, filmed in black and white with definite nods to Bava, its effective and mostly entertaining. Its score was by revered composer Angelo Francesco Lavagnino which is available on the likes of Spotify.\n\nThe next movie seems to be a bit of mystery regarding when it was released, some references saying that it was in cinemas in 1962 but others giving the year of its release as 1964, I can only assume two things, the first is that it was released in Italy in 1962, but did not get a release outside of Italy until 1964, the second being that the films storyline was also the subject for a handful of other movies and this is where the confusion begins? Il Mostro Dell’Opera or L’Orgie des Vampires, is an odd little film, which begins with a theatre troupe’s young leader securing an old theatre in which to mount his new production. The theatre’s elderly caretaker, however, urges the group to leave at once. After performing a Charleston and a sexy jazz-modern dance number, the crew is startled by the applause of a tuxedo-clad man in the audience, who is the monster in the film’s title, a vampire.\n\nAfter wandering alone into the depths of the theatre, the lead dancer of the troupe Julia encounters the vampire, who bites her and takes her to his crypt, where his other brides are chained to a wall giggling and hissing at one another. After a flashback, in which we learn that Julia is the reincarnation of the vampire’s love Laura, (yes that old chestnut) who betrayed him and caused him to be damned forever, the vampire vows to kill Julia for revenge, (well can’t blame him really) but due to his eternal love for her, he decides to release her. Julia goes back to her fellow performers who have actually listened to the caretaker and are trying to flee the theatre, but as they cross the stage, the lights flicker and a jazz record begins to play, so they instead burst into a frenzied modern dance that involves messed up hair, cavorting about on the ground, and mental jazz hands.\n\nThe vampire then re-appears, but when the troupe surround him with burning torches, he dies. Yes, see what I mean it is a little odd, directed by Renato Polselli it contains a score by composer Aldo Piga, and his soundtrack although effective is a combination of jazz, 1920’s flapper dances and a weird sounding theme for the vampire, that includes theremin interludes which are at times so high pitched it is an ear drum bursting experience.\n\nThe music however can be effective, but mostly is annoying and verges upon the comical when underlining some of the films so called bizarre moments of horror.\n\nThe plot for the movie is very similar to two 1960 releases, L’ultima Preda del Vampiro or The Playgirls and the Vampire, directed by Piero Regnoli and also scored by Piga, and L’amante Del Vampiro aka-The Vampire and The Ballerina which was again scored by Piga and helmed by the director of Il Mostro Dell’Opera Renato Polselli.\n\nConfusing isn’t it, so that is one reason why there could be some misperception over the release date of Il Mostro Dell’Opera, the score for Il Mostro Dell’Opera is available on digital platforms, along with Piga’s excellent soundtrack for the 1965 horror 5 Tombe Per Un Medium, which was directed by Massimo Pupillo and stars Barbara Steele.\n\nIt’s a movie that pays homage in many ways to the style of Mario Bava, with Piga’s score coming across as a commanding and effective work acting as a powerful and foreboding support to the proceedings.\n\nThe composer penning a rather interesting but short vocal version of the theme for the soundtrack, which was performed in both Italian and English, the remainder of his score is very evocative of the style of Miklos Rozsa and probably more akin to a Hollywood soundtrack than an Italian one. The movie opens with an attorney arriving at a castle to settle the estate of its recently deceased owner. But the owner’s wife and daughter reveal that he was someone who was able to summon the souls of ancient plague victims and his spirit was roaming the castle. It is not long as you might have guessed that occupants of the castle begin to die off in suspicious and gruesome ways. It’s a film that I would recommend and please do check out the score, as it is supportive, thematic, in the movie and entertaining away from it.\n\nPiga should also be mentioned for the music he wrote for the 1962 horror Slaughter of the Vampires, which contained a particularly beautiful piano led central theme. The Curse of the Blood Ghouls as it was re-titled for distribution outside of Italy, had a romantic sounding score, which was recently released on a vinyl album, but soon sold out. It is I have to say one of the best scores for an Italian horror from the sixties and I hope that in the not-too-distant future we may see a digital release. The film was photographed in black and white, and directed by Roberto Mauri, containing many atmospheric scenes that were harrowing and violent. Set in 19th century Austria, with its story circulating around a newlywed couple in an old castle who soon become the target of a savage vampire who is hellbent on destroying both their lives but focusing more upon on the bride. So, a straightforward storyline, young happy couple move into a creepy castle and are molested by an evil vampire, sounds good to me.\n\nStaying with Aldo Piga’s scores for these vampire tales, I urge you if you can to find the movies on you tube and just listen to the opening themes for all of them, I am sure that you like I did will hear very distinct similarities between all of them, I am not saying that they are the same, as they do differ but only slightly, with the composer relying upon a romantic and opulent concerto like piano performance within all of them, which brings me to a thought of maybe these scores or at least the more thematic sections of them (i.e. the piano performances) influenced James Bernard’s music in The Kiss of The Vampire (1963)?\n\nHeading back to 1965 now when we were treated to another Barbara Steele horror Amanti D’Oltretomba, Lovers of the Underworld, Nightmare Castle, or The Faceless Monster, as it was called in various countries. As punishment for adultery a sadistic count tortures and murders his unfaithful wife (Steele) and her lover (Paul Muller).\n\nHe then orders their hearts to be removed from their bodies. Years later, the count remarries, and his new spouse starts to experience nightmares and persistent hauntings. The ghosts of the two murdered lovers return to exact their bloody revenge upon the count and his new wife and can only be stopped when their hearts are destroyed.\n\nDirected by Mario Caiano, Nightmare Castle, was filmed in black and white and boasted a score by Ennio Morricone, in which the Maestro utilised a grand church organ and voices to great effect, the central theme, which was performed by piano and strings augmented with woods, was re-arranged and used again in the movie The Rover in 1967, Morricone adapting and arranging the theme to suit that movie. The score was released onto CD in 2006 on GDM records as part of their CD club releases.\n\nAlso from 1965 was Il Boia Scarlatto/Bloody Pit of Horror, in which a writer named Rick and his publisher Daniel Parks are travelling Italy to try and find a place to shoot some photographs for Rick’s Horror photo-novel, they come across an ideal spot which is a seemingly deserted castle, they agree that this looks perfect from the outside, so Rick and Daniel, accompanied by his secretary Edith, their photographer Dermott, and his five young models decide to break in. (perfectly normal behaviour).\n\nThey soon find the castle is occupied by a former actor, Travis Anderson, who initially is annoyed with the uninvited visitors until he recognises Edith, his ex-fiancèe amongst them (that was lucky-in all the old castles in the world you choose to walk into mine). He decides to give them permission to use his castle, but warns them that the dungeons are off limits, but as we all know in any horror film when someone is told don’t go in there, what do they do? Directed by Massimo Pupillo the film was an enjoyable enough yarn and had a nice score by composer Gino Peguri, who is probably better known to collectors for his adventure film scores such as Zorro the Fox (1968)and Blackie the Pirate (1971).\n\nThe 1960’s was such a fruitful time for all genres of cinema in Italy, but horror films were becoming more and more popular as the decade moved forward, and one can clearly see that Italian films were influenced by American and British horrors but mid-sixties we could also start to see Italian trademarks and scenarios beginning to influence both Hollywood and London. Italian horrors were more atmospheric in a strong silent way, they needed no or very little dialogue to set the scene and relied more upon the visuals as in the effects and the sets and eerie, and dramatic musical support. We stay with the 1960’s because there is so much more to talk about, in the way of movies and music. What we also have to remember is that Italian cinema had re-emerged as a driving force in the world via the creation of the Spaghetti western, it was around 1964, that westerns from Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci had started to gain audience’s attention, and if you think about it, if the westerns were not as prolific and popular maybe the spaghetti horror genre would have become even more popular. But let’s focus now upon the horror films that came in 1966 and after.\n\nIn 1966 director Camillo Mastrocinque cast actress Barbara Steele in the dual role of Harriet Montebruno/Belinda in his An Angel for Satan, and by that character one just knows how this story will pan out. The film also featured Mario Brega, Anthony Steffen, and Claudio Gori. The movie is set in 19th-century Italy, a sculptor and restorer Roberto Merigi is hired by Count Montebruno to restore an ancient statue retrieved from the bottom of the lake that surrounds the village. The count explains that the statue was pushed into the lake two hundred years and there is a legend that it is cursed.\n\nWhen his niece Countess Harriet Montebruno returns to the village after fifteen years studying in London, to receive her heritage that is administrated by the Count, the sculptor notices the striking resemblance that she has to the statue, the two are immediately attracted to each other and eventually fall in love. But soon Harriet begins to behave strangely, provoking murders of superstitious locals. Another case of a figure or ancestor being resurrected in a family member. Effective enough but beginning already to become a tired norm in Italian releases, music for the movie was the work of esteemed Maestro Francesco De Masi, sadly as far as I can see there has never been a soundtrack release, but surely, it’s only a matter of time considering the number of Italian scores that are now being issued on CD and digitally. De Masi was a composer who excelled in every genre with his western scores being particularly popular amongst collectors, his style was a mix of both symphonic and at times pop orientated compositions. His score for An Angel for Satan, was a surprisingly melodic work, with the composer utilising soft strings to create a haunting and lilting central theme, on which he built the remainder of his score.\n\nMario Bava’s atmospheric horror Kill Baby Kill was also in cinemas in 1966, with the tagline “The night brings terror! Blood chilling fear”. It is a classic example of Bava’s work, with its eerie sets that are mist shrouded and dark and shadowy interiors. When a coroner Dr. Eswai (Giacamo Rossi Stuart) is called by Inspector Kruger (Piero Lulli) to a small village to perform an autopsy on a woman who has died under suspicious circumstances, the coroner decides to investigate further. Despite help from the village witch (Fabienne Dali), Kruger is mysteriously killed, and it is revealed that the dead woman, as well as other villagers, have been killed by a phantom of a young girl who, fed by the hatred of her grieving mother, Baroness Graps, exacts her revenge on the village and its inhabitants.\n\nDr. Eswai, along with Monica, a local nurse (Erika Blanc) are lured into a fateful confrontation at the Graps villa. Bava turned to composer Carlo Rustichelli to score this disturbing story, which is suitably supportive, but does include music from other Rustichelli scores or stock music.\n\nAlso, in 1966 director Damiano Damiani made The Witch, the movie starred Richard Johnson, Rossano Schiaffino and Gian Maria Volonte. Sergio (Richard Johnson) a womanizing author is lured to a mansion by an old woman under the guise of working as a librarian. Her daughter, Aura (Schiaffino) appears out of nowhere and begins to seduce him. Little does he know, Aura doesn’t actually exist. Again, an effective tale, with the added excellence and quality of Damiani behind the camera. Music was by composer Lusi Enriquez Bacalov.\n\nTo 1969 for the next movie, which is La Bambola di Satana-Doll of Satan. A couple travel to a castle for the reading of the will of the woman’s recently deceased wealthy uncle. It turns out that he left her the castle and its grounds. She is persuaded by various characters to sell it but feels that it is not the right thing to do. Strange things begin to happen, most of them directed at the young woman. Typical horror fodder in many ways, nothing particularly original, the storyline could have been taken from any early 1960’s Italian horror. Directed by Ferruccio Casapinta it has a score penned by Franco Potenza.\n\nFrom the 1960’s we now move to focus upon the 1970’s where Italian horror movies were noticeably growing ever more popular. The 1970’s heralded numerous Italian productions, some being low budget clones of already tried and tested plots, others being Italian versions of a successful film that was produced in either America or the UK as in The Exorcist (1973). The majority however were innovative and inventive and again brought to the cinema screen in a way that only Italian filmmakers, writers, cinemaphotographers and composers could achieve. Along with the British film Witchfinder General (1968), Il Trono di Fuoco/The Bloody Judge (1970) was part of a small sub-genre of films from the late 1960’s and early 1970’s that can best be described as historical horror.\n\nLike most of these Witchfinder General copies, Il Trono di Fuoco/The Bloody Judge is set around a historical character.\n\nThe film focuses upon Englishman George Jeffreys (1645-1689) who was the Baron of Wem and a particularly evil judge, who is portrayed marvellously by Christopher Lee. The central character takes great delight in sentencing people to death and dishing out cruel and spiteful maltreatment to men, women, and children alike. The movie directed by Jesus Franco, was a Spanish/Italian co-production distributed by Titanus films.\n\nThe powerful musical score by Bruno Nicolai, was released on an LP record back in 1970 on the Cinevox label, (M.D.F. 33/32), and eleven selections from the score were included on the album. The score was remastered and re-issued in 1998 onto compact disc by German label Lucertola Media (LMCD 011) and contained thirty-five tracks from the score. It is a dark and foreboding work, the composer utilising a strong symphonic style, with thundering percussion, ominous brass flourishes, and wispy and sinister sounding harpsichord performances, that perfectly underline both the chilling and virulent parts of the narrative and support the urgent and more dramatic elements of the storyline.\n\nNicolai’s sweeping love theme of sorts, Flaming Eyes, featuring throughout the score in various arrangements and guises.\n\nIt is an outstanding score for a film that generated much interest throughout Europe. Being a Jesus Franco movie, many expected the normal sickening horror and gore, with lots of stomach-churning torture scenes, combined with a copious amount of sleaze, but this addition to the Hexploitation collective of movies, is quite tepid compared to other Franco movies. Yes we do see scenes of violence mainly towards women, as the Judge carries out vicious attacks and orders young girls to be tortured in horrific ways.\n\nIf you are however a horror fan then it is an entertaining movie there is no doubt about that but is nowhere near as gut wrenching as the German made Mark of the Devil which was released in the same year. Some posters and the original LP release of the soundtrack credit Dennis Price as being in the movie, he was supposed to portray Lord Wessex, but Price decided against it and pulled out, being replaced by Leo Genn.\n\nThe movie also featured Maria Schell, Peter Martell, and Maria Rohm.\n\n1971 saw the release of Web of the Spider, directed by Antonio Margheriti, the film tells the story of a sceptical journalist Alan Foster (Anthony Franciosa) who makes a bet than he can spend one night at the supposedly haunted Blackwood Castle. But he soon learns that the rumours of ghosts at the castle are indeed true. On all soul’s eve the ghosts of the castle search for blood to tide them over for another year, whilst in the castle foster meets and fall in love with Elizabeth Blackwood (Michele Mercier).\n\nThe movie has an impressive cast that includes a great performance from Klaus Kinski as Edgar Alan Poe. It is supposedly based on Poe’s Night of the Living Dead, with a screenplay penned by Bruno Corbucci and Giovanni Grimaldi. Music was the work of Riz Ortolani. Ortolani also scored another Margheriti directed horror, La Morte Negli Occhi Del Gatto/Seven Deaths in the Cats Eyes, which was released in 1973.\n\nThe movie starred Jane Birkin, Hiram Keller, and Serge Gainsbourg. Set in a small Scottish village, where horribly murdered bodies keep turning up. Suspicion falls upon the residents of a nearby castle that is haunted by a curse involving a killer cat. With the tagline Death means NOTHING to a beast with nine lives! It is categorised as a horror /thriller, but within it I thought there were elements of both Italian horror and French Giallo making it an interesting watch (if you like that sort of thing of course). Regarding Giallo movies, it is I think true to say that it was probably during the 1970’s that Italian made horror films became more and more influenced by the yellow genre. Films in the horror genre containing more violence than before and a higher level of nudity and sexual content, plus many stories were now being set in contemporary settings and including crime within the narrative. This is why sometimes it is difficult to define which is Giallo and which is horror. Setting the stories to modern day time frame was not just something that was happening in Italy, in the United States, American International had toyed with the idea of bringing a vampire into modern day America, in the form of Count Yorga Vampire (1970) and The Return of Count Yorga (1971).\n\nHammer films in the UK too decided that it was a good idea to place Count Dracula in a 1970’s London environment, in Dracula AD 1972 (1972) and followed it up with The Satanic Rites of Dracula in 1973, sadly audiences did not have the same mind set as Hammer and these two films were a disaster compared with other entries in the Hammer Dracula cycle, but the two Count Yorga movies were a runaway success, and audiences loved them.\n\nI am hoping that thus far I have managed to steer clear of the Giallo and will continue to discuss thoroughbred horrors from Cinecitta as we move forward. The 1970’s would see the return of directors such as Mario Bava, Riccardo Freda, and Antonio Margheriti, with new talent such as Pupi Avati who’s 1976 movie La Casa Dalle Finestre Che Ridono-The House with Laughing Windows, made a great impression upon audiences and critics alike. And Francesco Barilli,s. Il Profumo Della Signora in Nero-The Perfume of the Lady in Black which was scored by Nicola Piovani also made us sit up and pay attention in 1974.\n\nRiccardo Freda, directed Estratto Dagli Archivi Segreti Della Polizia di Una Capitale Europea/Tragic Ceremony in 1972, which successfully fused horror and crime into its storyline. Four young people are enjoying the easy life, cruising on a yacht in the sun.\n\nReturning to land their car runs out of fuel and they find themselves outside a large manor belonging to Lord and Lady Alexander. Hoping to find fuel they are invited in to stay the night and shelter from a heavy storm (why do people do this we know it wont end well). The three men are put up in the servant’s quarters while the girl Jane gets a room in the house. Hearing a strange noise, she heads down stairs, (see you just cannot tell some people) finding the Alexanders performing a black mass and she is put onto the altar to become the sacrifice. Fredo was said to have not wanted to do the movie, but finished it nonetheless. The Spanish prints of the movie are shorter than the Italian versions. In Spain, portions of the scene where Jane (Camille Keaton) takes a bath are cut – in fact, all shots with nudity are edited out – and the whole explanation by actor Paul Muller at the very end of the movie is missing. Spanish prints include end title music, whereas the Italian prints have the title song performed over a black screen.\n\nMusic was by Stelvio Cipriani, the score was available on CD released by digit movies under license from CAM back in 2012 and is also now available on digital platforms.\n\nAnother release from 1972 was the excellent Gli orrori del castello di Norimberga or Baron Blood, directed by Mario Bava, the film starred Joseph Cotton and Elke Sommer. A young man, Peter, (Antonio Cantafora) returns to Austria in search of his heritage. He visits the castle of an ancestor, a sadistic Baron who was cursed to a violent death by a witch whom the Baron had burned at the stake. Peter reads aloud the incantation that causes Baron Blood to return and continue his murderous tortures.\n\nThe movie had certain affiliations to the AIP films that were based upon the tales of Edgar Alan Poe, and was in full colour, music was by Stelvio Cipriani, who penned a light almost lounge/exotica sounding theme, that included a laid-back samba tempo and chorale work that could easily be mistaken for Ennio Morricone, as in his score for Love Circle (1969) and even had a kind of Burt Bacharach vibe to it. Cipriani’s score was an effective one and became darker as the storyline opened up more and became increasingly intense and dramatic.\n\nThe music was released on a Digitmovies compact disc in 2005, paired with Ecologia Del Delitto aka-Bay of Blood and selections from Cani Arrabbiati or Rabid Dogs which were also scored by Cipriani for Mario Bava. The two-disc set was marketed as the Mario Bava Anthology Volume lll. The score for Baron Blood was also released on a two LP vinyl set in 2014 by Dagored records.\n\nLa Notte Dei Diavoli/Night of the Devils was also released in 1972 and is an adaptation of Tolstoy’s story The Wurdulak, a mentally ill patient known as Nicola (Gianni Garko) gets flashbacks to horrifying experiences that he has encountered. While driving through the country, he experiences a flashback and crashes damaging the car. He leaves the car and starts to walk looking for help but, on his way, he meets a mysterious family who live in total fear of someone or something. This evil vampiric force slowly penetrates the household and throws each of its occupants into a frenzy of absolute terror. Directed by Giorgio Ferroni, it is a movie that has its moments, the score by Giorgio Gaslini does a great job of supporting the storyline, and at times when listening it one realises maybe this is what inspired Pino Donaggio on films such as Don’t Look Now and Carrie.\n\nIt is a subtle but at the same time powerful and haunting work, the composer utilising eerie harpsichord, percussive elements, breathy woodwinds, and strings to create uneasy and sinister moods. The composer also employing solo female voice (Edda Del Orso) to fashion a beautiful theme that is heard throughout the movie with the composer arranging this for flute and strings. The score was issued on Digit movies in 2003 which was a re-mastered edition and included twenty-four tracks. A suite from the score had previously appeared on the DRG compilation The Horror Films Collection, in 1995 which was part of the labels Classic Italian Soundtracks series, the horror collection being made up of music that was originally released and owned by Cinevox records in Rome.\n\nStaying in 1972 and back to director Lucio Fulci, who selected a strong cast for his Non si Sevizia un Paperino or Don’t Torture a Duckling. Set in a Southern Italian town which is shaken to the core by a string of child murders, the police and two urban outcasts search for the culprit amid a scenario of everyone blaming each other within the superstitious community. The cast included Florinda Bolkan, Tomas Milian, and Barbara Bouchet. The score was by Riz Ortolani or should I say on this occasion Ritz Ortolani.\n\nIn 1975, Dario Argento’s Profondo Rosso or Deep Red burst into cinemas, this was a new kind of horror and one that maybe at first was rather difficult to take in, it was a blood-spattered affair, but had a good storyline, it starred British actor David Hemmings. The plot involves a psychic who can read minds and they pick up the thoughts of a murderer in the audience and soon become their next victim. An English pianist gets involved in solving the murders but finds many of his avenues of inquiry cut off by new murders, and he begins to wonder how the murderer can track his movements so closely. It’s an involved and bloody film, but an impressive one.\n\nMusic was by composer George Gaslini with additional music by Goblin as the Goblins.\n\nSette Note in Nero aka-Murder to the tune of Seven Black Notes or The Psychic which starred Jennifer O Neill and was directed by Lucio Fulci came to cinema screens in 1977. A woman who is a clairvoyant has a disturbing vision and is compelled to demolish part of a wall in her husband’s home discovering a skeleton behind it. Along with her psychiatrist, she seeks to find the truth about who the person was and who put her there.\n\nBut she begins to realise that maybe she too will meet the same fate. The effective musical score was the work of Franco Bixio, Fabrizio Frizzi, and Vince Tempera. Who collaborated to create a truly virulent, disturbing, and tantalising soundtrack.\n\nThe central core of the work being based on seven re-occurring notes, on which the composers built the rest of the score around. The score is now available on all digital platforms in a twenty-two track edition.\n\nDario Argento brought Suspiria to the big screen, in 1977 and I think it had an even greater impact than his Deep Red, from then on Italian Horror was never the same or so it seemed, the director pushed the boundaries of horror and successfully attracted the attention of audiences worldwide. Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to perfect her ballet skills. She arrives at a dance academy in the middle of a downpour and is refused admission after another woman is seen fleeing the school. She returns the next morning, and this time is let in. She learns that the young woman she saw fleeing the previous evening, has been found dead. S\n\ntrange things soon begin to occur. Suzy becomes ill and is put on a special diet; the school becomes infested with maggots and unsettling, odd sounds, and Daniel, the pianist at the school, is killed by his own dog. The young woman decides to research the building where the dance school is and finds out that it was once the home of a witch’s coven, and as she soon discovers still is. This is now a classic piece of Italian cinema, an iconic and inventive movie.\n\nThe score was by Goblin, who after this made a name for themselves worldwide with their unique brand of atmospheric music for film."
