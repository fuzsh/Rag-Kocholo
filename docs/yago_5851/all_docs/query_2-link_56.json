        "text": "The Horrible Dr. Hichcock (aka Raptus: The Secret of Dr.Hichcock/The Terror of Dr.Hichcock) (1962), Dir. Riccardo Freda (as Robert Hampton), 87/79 mins, Blu-ray\n\nThe Horrible Dr. Hichcock is an Italian Gothic horror, not a genre I’m really familiar with – I’ve naturally seen several Italian Westerns, and a few (mostly awful) gory Italian Zombie horrors; Italian Gothic though? Considering my love of all things Hammer, its perhaps odd that I never gave it a try, but I’ve always found the dubbing of Italian films distracting, and other than Sergio Leone’s films, they have seemed universally amateur in execution compared to American and English films. So this particular release was very much a blind-buy: partly it was because of the seasonal (Halloween) timing of this new Radiance edition, but also because when news broke of its impending release, some commentators rated the film very highly indeed, suggesting its obscurity was more due to other factors than its quality, appealing to my curiosity.\n\nIts probably a perfect example of how great physical media can be for film-lovers, bringing to one’s attention films that are either too old, too strange or too obscure to be accessed any other way. I’d never heard of this film six months ago, and now its one of my favourite gothic horrors. The Horrible Dr. Hichcock is a great, moody, fascinating horror film- more please!\n\nThe film opens in distinctly Hammer Horror fashion, with a dimly-lit graveyard late in the day, when a lone grave digger is knocked unconscious whilst preparing the grave for a waiting coffin. The coffin lid is forced open, revealing the body of a beautiful young woman. Gloved hands hover over and caress the corpse and the scene ends as the intruder’s body shifts over the poor woman’s body, thankfully obscuring our view from unmentionable acts….\n\nLondon, 1885: Dr. Hitchcock (Robert Flemying) has developed a radical anaesthetic that makes patients comatose enough to enable life-saving surgeries, but at home he likes to drug his willing wife Margarettha (Maria Teresa Vianello) with the same anaesthetic for sexual games in which he has total power and, er, use of her body. What his wife gets out of it is anyone’s guess, although a sequence later in which second wife Cynthia (Barbara Steele) experiences twisted visions during her own drugged state suggests… something. Clearly Hichcock and Margarettha are deviants.\n\nUnfortunately, one night Hichcock’s overconfidence and twisted desires results in him accidentally administering an overdose that kills Margarettha. While her death is presumably attributed to a sudden heart attack, wracked with guilt Hichcock leaves his home in the care of housekeeper Martha (Harriet Medin). Several years later he remarries and returns with his new wife, Cynthia (the latter much to the disapproval of Martha), and resumes his hospital work. Cynthia starts to hear and see strange things both around the house and in the grounds approaching the family crypt where Margarettha is interred. Who is the woman that Cynthia glimpses sitting with Martha in her quarters? Meanwhile Hichcock seems to be struggling with his necrophiliac urges- at one point he apparently allows a beautiful female patient to die during an operation, in order to then go to the morgue where her body waits… (only to be thwarted when he is disturbed by an intern).\n\nThe title of the film, name-dropping the great Alfred Hitchcock, no less, albeit misspelling to protect from litigation, offers a clue to the finer points of a film which honours Alfred Hitchcock through call backs to several of his films, like Vertigo, Psycho and perhaps most notably Rebecca. The story also has obvious nods to Poe, and Hammer films in general (set in late-nineteenth-century England, the credits have the Italian cast and crew names anglicised to make it seem to be a British or American film because Italian audiences preferred those horror films to their native ones).\n\nThe story about the making of this film is possibly as enjoyable as anything in the film- its one of those situations in which the making of it informs the film, and vice-versa, I guess. Part of it was to do with a bet- director Freda had a bet with a friend over a racehorse that he could shoot a film in ten days. To that end it was filmed almost entirely in an Italian villa (necessity is the mother of creation, after all, and Freda won the bet and the horse). The villa represented the mad doctor’s mansion, the villa’s tiled kitchen was turned into the hospital surgery and morgue (and, later, incredibly, transformed again, into the cemetery for the tantalising prologue). Ten pages of the script were cut (one suspects to better manage that ten-day shoot) that leaves the film with a curious sudden gap in the narrative, ensuring a twist/jump that entices as much as it befuddles – a character completely disappears from the film, and another appears as Hichcock suddenly succumbs completely to madness.\n\nActor Robert Flemying signed on for the film’s title role because he fancied the opportunity to revisit Rome and see the sights, but was then horrified upon reading the script and learning that it concerned Necrophilia. Fearing for what such a possibly scandalous film might do to his career he called his agent only to be told he’d got to do it, as he’d signed a contract- and as it turned out, the shockingly quick ten-day shoot meant he was on a plane back to England never having time for the sight-seeing anyway.\n\nFunnily enough, for all his misgivings, Flemying manages a superb performance, both dramatic and subtle, depicting a brilliant man driven by his twisted urges. For all the limitations of its ten-day shoot in a villa, the film looks absolutely gorgeous, beautifully shot with atmospheric and imaginative cinematography that leaves the film looking like a work of art rather than the cheap exploitation movie it might have done. The excellent music score assists in this no end; the film looks and sounds quite ravishing.\n\nSo for once the luxury treatment a boutique label has given to an obscure film is thoroughly deserved here- this Radiance edition presents the film restored and looking better than it ever has, in three cuts over two discs with two commentaries and a few interviews, as well as a video essay and an in-depth booklet of articles. Its a great package. I’ve sometimes been burned by blind-buys in the past (one can never be sure with a film one’s never seen) but this has been a great surprise, one of my best buys of this year, in fact, and one I’ll no doubt return to often (I’m very curious about the much-maligned American cut, I’m always fascinated by how much an alternate cut can change a film). Maybe this Italian gothic genre is one I’ll need to explore next year…"
