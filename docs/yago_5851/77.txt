biography

Born in England on December 29, 1937 (some sources cite her date of birth as 1938 and her place of birth as Ireland), actress Barbara Steele's striking, exotic visage helped make her an international horror film star in the 1960s. As a child Steele was interested in a career as an artist, but as she matured she decided to give acting a try. Steele first landed a small part in the British comedy Bachelor of Hearts (1958; with Hardy Kruger and Sylvia Syms). A few other roles followed, yet Steele found fame in the Italian-made horror classic Black Sunday (1960; with John Richardson), directed by Mario Bava. Black Sunday helped typecast her as a horror actress. More horror films followed, including Pit and the Pendulum (1961; with Vincent Price and Luana Anders), The Horrible Dr. Hichcock (1964; with Robert Flemyng), and The Crimson Cult (1970; with Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee). Aside from horror films, Steele has appeared in such diverse films as Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 (1963; with Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale), The Maniacs (1964; with Margaret Lee), Caged Heat (1974; with Juanita Brown), and Pretty Baby (1978; with Keith Carradine and Brooke Shields).

In 1969, Steele married successful screenwriter James Poe, who wrote the screenplays of such films as Summer and Smoke (1961; with Laurence Harvey and Pamela Tiffin), Lilies of the Field (1963; with Sidney Poitier), and They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969; with Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin). Following her marriage, Steele bowed out of acting for several years. During her hiatus, she gave birth to her son, Jonathan, in 1971.
