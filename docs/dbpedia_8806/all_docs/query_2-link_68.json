        "text": "There seem to be quite a few Augsburg thalers dated 1641, 1642 and 1643 originating from China and offered on Ebay. The 1641 thaler (Davenport 5039) shown here must be a forgery as it weighs only 28.023g. The weight of a thaler of this period should be around 29.2g. Indeed a Saxon money edict of 1566 established the Reichsthaler (known later as the Speciesthaler) with a fineness of 889.0 and a weight of 29.2g. For example, see the American Numismatic Society database (ANS 1905.57.240) listing a 1641 thaler which weighs 28.98g, and one of 1642 (ANS 1905.57.241) weighing 29.1g."
