        "text": "Kremnica coins from the hoards of Przemków (2002) and Głogów (2004) Seventeenth century was a time of sudden changes and bloody events in Europe. The Thirty Years' War, Kipper inflation and the state bankruptcy of 1623/4 caused the extreme economic situation which motivated to conceal resources. During tragic circumstances like war activities, epidemics and emigrations, two valuable troves of coins have been hidden in Przemków (after 1631) and Głogów (after 1656). First hoard contains two Hungarian gold coins, the second one contains eight Hungarian florins and eight Hungarian thalers. This two and seven more hoards from Silesia show how important role on monetary market in central Europe, included Silesia, Hungarian coins held.\n\nWhile digging the foundations for a house in Vinkovci in 1919, a hoard was discovered of silver coins and jewelry in a pottery vessel. Only in 1936 did the professional public hear about the find and its numismatic composition, while in 1961 certain information was provided about the jewelry it had also contained. Fate did not permit the hoard, although already damaged during its discovery, to be preserved in its entirety, as the jewelry and part of the coins disappeared in unknown circumstances, while the remaining coins were mixed in with similar coins from the same chronological period. Luckily, some notes and drawings were preserved, and hence it is possible to discuss and make conclusions about this hoard, which contained silver jewelry in addition to Croatian-Hungarian coins of the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nNUMISMATIC COLLECTION OF THE REGIONAL MUSEUM OF HISTORY STARA ZAGORA (ancient Augusta Traiana). Thracian, Macedonian, Greek, and Roman republican coins from 6th to 1st century BC by Mariana Minkova, Julia Tzvetkova and Ilya Prokopov. Volume - 297 pages; coins included - 2394. Stara Zagora’s region is of particular importance for the study of the coin circulation in Thrace in the 4th-1st century BC. There it’s been located a significant concentration of hemidrachms of Thracian Chersonese and Parion, as well as hoards of bronze coins of Philip II and Alexander III. The coins of Thracian Chersonese and Parion date back to 4th century BC. The coin hoards of Philip II and Alexander III date back within the period of the end of the 4th century BC till the first decades of the 3rd century BC – a very important period for the history of Thrace. Another important focus is: 11 drachms imitations were found in Stara Zagora’s region, probabely coins of the Bastarnae (nos. 510-520). Of great importance is the fact that three of them were discovered during archaeological excavations in the area. This type of drachms dates back to the end of the 3rd until 2nd c. BC, and more specifically, around the time of the fall of Macedonia in 168 BC. An especially important is the following problem: the researched area has the highest density of tetradrachms “rough” imitations with the name of the Thasians from the 1st century BC. Stara Zagora’s region is the meeting point of East-Celtic imitations coming from the north and the imitations of tetradrachms under the type of Thasos."
