        "text": "Timeline of Historical Milestones in The Disability Rights Movement\n\nThis timeline uses language that is historically correct, but no longer considered acceptable.\n\n1815-1817\n\nFormal Deaf Education Begins in the U.S.\n\nThomas H. Gallaudet founds the Connecticut Asylum for the Education and Instruction of Deaf and Dumb Persons in Hartford, Connecticut. It is the first permanent school for the deaf in America.*\n\n1829\n\nBraille Invents the Raised Point Alphabet\n\nLouis Braille invents the raised point alphabet that makes him a household name today. His method doesn't become well-known in the United States until more than 30 years after it is first taught at the St. Louis School for the Blind in 1860.\n\n1907\n\nEugenic Sterilization Law for People with Disabilities Enacted\n\nIndiana becomes the first state to enact a eugenic sterilization law—for \"confirmed idiots, imbeciles and rapists\"—in state institutions.* The law spreads like wildfire and is enacted in 24 other states. In 1927, compulsory sterilization is ruled constitutional.\n\n1932\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, a Person with a Disability, Elected President\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt becomes the 32nd president of the United States and is re-elected for an unprecedented four terms. In August 1921, while vacationing at Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Roosevelt contracted an illness, believed to be polio, which resulted in total and permanent paralysis from the waist down. After becoming President, he supports the founding of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now known as the March of Dimes). In recognition of his support of this organization, FDR is commemorated on the dime.\n\n1934 - 1940\n\nNational Federation of the Blind Founded\n\nAt the age of 23, Jacobus tenBroek, blind from the age of 14, joins with Dr. Newel Perry and others to form the California Council of the Blind (later renamed later the National Federation of the Blind of California). This becomes a model for the national organization he forms six years later.\n\n1935\n\nSocial Security Act Signed into Law\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act, establishing a program of permanent assistance for adults with disabilities.\n\n1939\n\nNazi Program Kills Thousands of People with Disabilities\n\nAt the onset of World War II Adolph Hitler orders widespread \"mercy killing\" of the sick and disabled.* Code-named Aktion T4, the Nazi euthanasia program is instituted to eliminate \"life unworthy of life.\" Between 75,000 to 250,000 people with intellectual or physical disabilities are systematically killed from 1939 to 1941.\n\n1950\n\nBeginning of National Barrier-Free Standards\n\nDisabled veterans and people with disabilities begin the barrier-free movement.

The Foundation exposes the abusive conditions at these facilities and becomes an impetus toward deinstitutionalization.\n\n1947\n\nNational \"Employ the Physically Handicapped Week,\" Washington, D.C.*\n\nPresidential Committee launches publicity campaigns, coordinated by state and local committees, to emphasize the competence of people with disabilities. Campaign uses movie trailers, billboards, radio and television ads to convince the public that it is good business to hire people with disabilities.\n\nParalyzed Veterans of America organization founded\n\nParalyzed Veterans of America advocates for veterans of the [United States] armed forces who have experienced spinal cord injury. The organization promotes and protects the civil rights of veterans with disabilities.\n\n1950\n\nThe ARC Champions Abilities of People with Intellectual Disabilities\n\nParents of children with intellectual disabilities found the Association for Retarded Citizens (ARC).* The association works to change public perception of intellectual disability. The organization, now renamed The Arc, continues to ensure that the estimated 7.2 million Americans with intellectual and developmental disabilities have the services and supports they need to grow, develop, and live in communities across the nation.\n\n1954\n\nBrown v Board of Education\n\nSchool segregation is abolished, and public schools are given permission to educate children with significant intellectual disabilities.\n\n1962\n\nEd Roberts Fights for Admission to University, starting the Independent Living Movement\n\nEd Roberts, a young man with polio, enrolls at the University of California, Berkeley. After his admission is rejected, he fights to get the decision overturned. His advocacy, along with that of Judy Huemann, inspires the Independent Living Movement and helps establish the first Center for Independent Living (CIL).\n\n1963 Community Mental Health Act signed into Law\n\nOn October 31, 1963, President John F. Kennedy signs into law...\n\nthe Community Mental Health Act (also known as the Mental Retardation and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963*). The Act drastically altered the delivery of mental health services and inspired a new era of optimism in mental healthcare.\n\n1964\n\nCivil Rights Bill Bypasses Persons with Disabilities\n\nThe Civil Rights Act is passed. While the Act helps end discrimination against African Americans and women in the workplace, it does not make any provision for people with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities still lack opportunities to participate in and be contributing members of society, are denied access to employment, and are discriminated against based on disability.\n\n1965\n\nMedicaid Assistance for People with Disabilities and those with Low-Income\n\nTitle XIX (19) of the Social Security Act creates a cooperative federal/state entitlement program, known as Medicaid, that pays medical costs for certain individuals with disabilities and families with low incomes.\n\n1968\n\nThe Architectural Barriers Act of 1968\n\nAct mandates the removal of what is perceived to be the most significant obstacle to employment for people with disabilities—the physical design of the buildings and facilities on the job.

The Declaration consists of a preamble, and thirteen proclamations that broadly promote the rights of those with disabilities. In 2007 the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was adopted.\n\nSocial Model of Disability replaces Medical Model\n\nThe Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation and the Disability Alliance develop fundamental principles that change the way disability is considered.* This \"social model\" rejects a medical construct of disability focusing on environmental systematic and attitudinal barriers.\n\n1976\n\nDeaf Actress cast in Sesame Street\n\nDeaf actress Linda Bove, graduate of Gallaudet College and veteran of the National Theater for the Deaf, signs a long-term contract to play Linda the librarian on public television's beloved Sesame Street.\n\n1977\n\nHalderman v. Pennhurst State School & Hospital\n\nLandmark lawsuit leads to the 1987 closure of Pennhurst, one of the largest state-run institutions for people with disabilities in Pennsylvania.\n\n1977\n\nDisability Demonstrators Occupy Federal Office of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), San Francisco, California.\n\nDemonstrators led by Judy Heumann take over the Health Education and Welfare (HEW) office in UN Plaza, San Francisco, California.

Americans with Disabilities for Accessible Transportation (ADAPT) is founded.\n\nIn Denver, Colorado, nineteen members of the Atlantis Community block buses with their wheelchairs—chanting \"We will ride!\"—to demonstrate the inaccessibility of public transportation. Protests lead to the 1983 founding of Americans with Disabilities for Accessible Public Transportation (ADAPT). For seven years ADAPT—under the leadership of Bob Kafka, Stephanie Thomas, and Mike Auberger—blocked buses in cities across the U.S. to demonstrate the need for access to public transit. After the passage of the ADA (and transit measures gained by ADAPT's hard work), ADAPT shifts its focus to attendant and community-based services, becoming American Disabled for Attendant Programs Today.\n\n1982\n\nUnited Nations Encourages Global Equality and Participation for the Disabled\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopts \"The World Program of Action Concerning the Disabled\" to encourage full participation and equality for people with disabilities around the world.\n\nSpeaking for Ourselves, Pennsylvania is founded.\n\nSelf-advocacy organization for people with disabilities emerges as a distinct voice in the Disability Rights Movement.\n\nNational Organization on Disability\n\nAlan A.
