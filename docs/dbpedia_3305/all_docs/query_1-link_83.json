        "text": "Great Depression\n\nThis event was symptomatic of a decade of economic uncertainty that was precipitated by the crash in the fall of 1929 when U.S. stock prices declined dramatically. The resulting panic devastated the fortunes of many investors and caused major declines in consumption, industrial production, and employment, which in turn affected the U.S. and world economy for the next ten years.\n\nThe U.S. stock market had expanded rapidly during the 1920s, attracting many inexperienced investors.\n\nGeorge Mehales, a Greek immigrant who owned a diner in Spartanburg, South Carolina, began investing in the stock market just before the crash. “One day,” he recalled in a Federal Writers’ Project interview:\n\n…one of my customers showed me how much money he was making in the market…It looked good to me, and I bit with what you folks call ‘hook, line and sinker.’…The first day of October in 1929 made me feel like I was rich…During the last days of October, my stocks began to drop. I was gambling on the margin. My brother called me and told me I would have to put up more cash. I went to the bank and put up all the cash I had in the bank with my brother…. I had about five thousand dollars invested. On that day of October 29, they told me I needed more cash to cover up. I couldn’t get it. I was wiped out that day…\n\n“George Mehales.” R. V. Williams, interviewer; Spartanburg, South Carolina, December 1938. American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers’ Project, 1936 to 1940. Manuscript Division.\n\nMehales had lost everything, including his restaurant, which he had to sell at a rock bottom price. “I was wiped…I considered killing myself, ’cause I had nothing left.”\n\nIn the early 1930s, the United States moved further into economic instability, with the collapse of many banks, dramatically reduced spending on consumer goods, and increasing unemployment.\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover’s response to these crises disappointed many, including WWI veterans, many of whom found themselves impoverished. They rallied in Washington in 1932, hoping that they might be able to receive their military pension funds early. When Congress rejected their appeals, some members of this so-called, “Bonus Army” reacted with frustration and violence. U.S. Army troops were called in, and the image of U.S Army soldiers confronting the veterans of the Great War in the nation’s capital and virtually running them out of town did not sit well with the public.\n\nPresident Herbert Hoover’s response to these crises disappointed many, including WWI veterans, many of whom found themselves impoverished.

U.S. Army troops were called in, and the image of U.S Army soldiers confronting the veterans of the Great War in the nation’s capital and virtually running them out of town did not sit well with the public.\n\nDepression of European Markets\n\nThe original caption for this photo, taken in Weimar Germany during the Great Depression, reads: “When night comes! The picture was taken in the municipal refuge for the homeless. View of one of the dormitories which can house up to 100 people.”\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\n\nIn the summer of 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Governor of New York, was nominated as the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party. In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt addressed the problems of the depression by telling the American people that, “I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.” In the election that took place in the fall of 1932, Roosevelt won by a landslide.\n\nThe 1932 Presidential campaign was one of the most momentous in American history.\n\nWith Republican President Herbert Hoover presiding over a nation in economic collapse, it was clear a Democrat would win the presidency in 1932. But which Democrat?\n\nBy the spring of 1932, New York Governor Franklin Delano Roosevelt emerged as the frontrunner. The popular leader of the country’s most populous state, he attracted attention by aggressively using governmental power to help alleviate the suffering of the Depression.\n\nSaddled with responsibility for the Depression, President Hoover was deeply unpopular. FDR’s advisors urged their candidate to play it safe. His running mate, John Nance Garner of Texas, told him, “All you have got to do is stay alive until election day.”\n\nBut FDR relished campaigning and wanted to show the country he was up to the job. He traveled to 41 states, making major addresses and hundreds of whistle-stop appearances. His energy, charm, and commitment to action carried him to a decisive victory.\n\nWPA Federal Theatre Playhouse\n\nBy 1939, the New Deal had run its course. In the short term, New Deal programs helped improve the lives of people suffering from the events of the depression. In the long run, New Deal programs set a precedent for the federal government to play a key role in the economic and social affairs of the nation.\n\nA Letter From A Farmer to The President\n\n“To Our Illustrious President:\n\nOur Holy Books say: A poor man is like a dead man. You came and resurrected the poor man from the dead. You came and said: ‘Wake up, forgotten man. I will give you new life. I will give you a new deal.’ Like the prophet, Nathan, who said to King David: You have so many sheep and yet you want to take the last sheep of the poor man; so you said to the rich, to the Wall St. bankers: Leave the poor man his last sheep. Let him also live. All the rich men hate you for that. They know that you brought new hope to the poor plain man. They know that never again will the old times come back. May I end respectfully that your name, our illustrious President, will live forever.”\n\nFrustration among people\n\nRoosevelt is a damn good man — you take all these young fellows and you can’t talk to them like in the old days to swing them over. Today all these kids are satisfied on WPA and the NYA. My son works there and gets 44 cents an hour. I only have one son and believe me I am glad[?] I can’t buy him the things he needs. Where would I get off if I had a large family. That’s something I don’t believe in. One or two is plenty for any family.\n\nWWII\n\nThe Atlantic Charter\n\n“The President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain common principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a better future for the world.\n\nFirst, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other;\n\nSecond, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned;\n\nThird, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them;\n\nFourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity;\n\nFifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security;\n\nSixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all the men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want;\n\nSeventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance;\n\nEighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measure which will lighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\n\nWinston S. Churchill”\n\nAnalysis\n\nThis charter is consisted of 8 articles and all of them reflected the thought of the President in that they agreed with no expansion of territory, paying respect to self-determination, mutual economic co-operation and exclusion of military power as a method.\n\nThis context can be seen as an emergence of concept for establishment of The United Nations.\n\nA day of Infamy/ Declaration of War\n\nTranscript\n\nCrimian Conference\n\nPROTOCOL OF PROCEEDINGS OF CRIMEA CONFERENCE\n\nThe Crimea Conference of the heads of the Governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which took place from Feb. 4 to 11, came to the following conclusions:\n\nI. WORLD ORGANIZATION\n\nIt was decided:\n\n1. That a United Nations conference on the proposed world organization should be summoned for Wednesday, 25 April, 1945, and should be held in the United States of America.\n\n2. The nations to be invited to this conference should be:\n\n(a) the United Nations as they existed on 8 Feb., 1945; and\n\n(b) Such of the Associated Nations as have declared war on the common enemy by 1 March, 1945. (For this purpose, by the term “Associated Nations” was meant the eight Associated Nations and Turkey.) When the conference on world organization is held, the delegates of the United Kingdom and United State of America will support a proposal to admit to original membership two Soviet Socialist Republics, i.e., the Ukraine and White Russia.\n\n3. That the United States Government, on behalf of the three powers, should consult the Government of China and the French Provisional Government in regard to decisions taken at the present conference concerning the proposed world organization.\n\n4. That the text of the invitation to be issued to all the nations which would take part in the United Nations conference should be as follows:\n\n“The Government of the United States of America, on behalf of itself and of the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialistic Republics and the Republic of China and of the Provisional Government of the French Republic invite the Government of ——– to send representatives to a conference to be held on 25 April, 1945, or soon thereafter , at San Francisco, in the United States of America, to prepare a charter for a general international organization for the maintenance of international peace and security.\n\n“The above-named Governments suggest that the conference consider as affording a basis for such a Charter the proposals for the establishment of a general international organization which were made public last October as a result of the Dumbarton Oaks conference and which have now been supplemented by the following provisions for Section C of Chapter VI:\n\nC. Voting\n\n“1. Each member of the Security Council should have one vote.\n\n“2. Decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters should be made by an affirmative vote of seven members.\n\n“3. Decisions of the Security Council on all matters should be made by an affirmative vote of seven members, including the concurring votes of the permanent members; provided that, in decisions under Chapter VIII, Section A and under the second sentence of Paragraph 1 of Chapter VIII, Section C, a party to a dispute should abstain from voting.’\n\n“Further information as to arrangements will be transmitted subsequently.\n\n“In the event that the Government of ——– desires in advance of the conference to present views or comments concerning the proposals, the Government of the United States of America will be pleased to transmit such views and comments to the other participating Governments.”\n\nII. DECLARATION OF LIBERATED EUROPE\n\nIII. DISMEMBERMENT OF GERMANY\n\nIt was agreed that Article 12 (a) of the Surrender terms for Germany should be amended to read as follows:\n\n“The United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics shall possess supreme authority with respect to Germany. In the exercise of such authority they will take such steps, including the complete dismemberment of Germany as they deem requisite for future peace and security.”\n\nThe study of the procedure of the dismemberment of Germany was referred to a committee consisting of Mr. Anthony Eden, Mr. John Winant, and Mr. Fedor T. Gusev. This body would consider the desirability of associating with it a French representative.\n\nIV. ZONE OF OCCUPATION FOR THE FRENCH AND CONTROL COUNCIL FOR GERMANY.\n\nV. REPARATION\n\nThe following protocol has been approved:\n\nProtocol\n\nOn the Talks Between the Heads of Three Governments at the Crimean Conference on the Question of the German Reparations in Kind\n\n1. Germany must pay in kind for the losses caused by her to the Allied nations in the course of the war. Reparations are to be received in the first instance by those countries which have borne the main burden of the war, have suffered the heaviest losses and have organized victory over the enemy.\n\n2. Reparation in kind is to be exacted from Germany in three following forms:\n\n3. For the working out on the above principles of a detailed plan for exaction of reparation from Germany an Allied reparation commission will be set up in Moscow. It will consist of three representatives – one from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, one from the United Kingdom and one from the United States of America.\n\n4. With regard to the fixing of the total sum of the reparation as well as the distribution of it among the countries which suffered from the German aggression, the Soviet and American delegations agreed as follows:\n\n“The Moscow reparation commission should take in its initial studies as a basis for discussion the suggestion of the Soviet Government that the total sum of the reparation in accordance with the points (a) and (b) of the Paragraph 2 should be 22 billion dollars and that 50 per cent should go to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.”\n\nThe British delegation was of the opinion that, pending consideration of the reparation question by the Moscow reparation commission, no figures of reparation should be mentioned.\n\nThe above Soviet-American proposal has been passed to the Moscow reparation commission as one of the proposals to be considered by the commission.\n\nVI. MAJOR WAR CRIMINALS\n\nThe conference agreed that the question of the major war criminals should be the subject of inquiry by the three Foreign Secretaries for report in due course after the close of the conference.\n\n[Begin second section published Feb. 13, 1945.]\n\nVII. POLAND\n\nVIII. YUGOSLAVIA\n\nIt was agreed to recommend to Marshal Tito and to Dr. Ivan Subasitch:\n\nIX. ITALO-YOGOSLAV FRONTIER – ITALO-AUSTRIAN FRONTIER\n\nNotes on these subjects were put in by the British delegation and the American and Soviet delegations agreed to consider them and give their views later.\n\nX. YUGOSLAV-BULGARIAN RELATIONS\n\nXI. SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE\n\nXII. IRAN\n\nXIII. MEETINGS OF THE THREE FOREIGN SECRETARIES\n\nXIV. THE MONTREAUX CONVENTION AND THE STRAITS\n\nIt was agreed that at the next meeting of the three Foreign Secretaries to be held in London, they should consider proposals which it was understood the Soviet Government would put forward in relation to the Montreaux Convention, and report to their Governments. The Turkish Government should be informed at the appropriate moment.\n\nThe forgoing protocol was approved and signed by the three Foreign Secretaries at the Crimean Conference Feb. 11, 1945.\n\nE. R. Stettinius Jr.\n\nM. Molotov\n\nAnthony Eden\n\nAGREEMENT REGARDING JAPAN\n\nThe leaders of the three great powers – the Soviet Union, the United States of America and Great Britain – have agreed that in two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated, the Soviet Union shall enter into war against Japan on the side of the Allies on condition that:\n\nIt is understood that the agreement concerning Outer Mongolia and the ports and railroads referred to above will require concurrence of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The President will take measures in order to maintain this concurrence on advice from Marshal Stalin.\n\nThe heads of the three great powers have agreed that these claims of the Soviet Union shall be unquestionably fulfilled after Japan has been defeated.\n\nFor its part, the Soviet Union expresses it readiness to conclude with the National Government of China a pact of friendship and alliance between the U.S.S.R. and China in order to render assistance to China with its armed forces for the purpose of liberating China from the Japanese yoke.\n\nFebruary 11, 1945.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThis statement can be useful for knowing what superpower leaders thought when WWII was about to end. Roosevelt used his power to get closer to make a global organization and realize world peace by involving Soviet into the agreement. Also, it can be seen that, at the time of the Yalta Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill thought Stalin would do what he promised while Stalin tried to make the Europe to communist’s nations, which became the beginning of the Cold War.\n\nReference\n\nAnnotated Draft of Proposed Message to Congress Requesting Declaration of War Against Japan; 12/7/1941; Franklin D.
