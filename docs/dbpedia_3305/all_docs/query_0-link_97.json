        "text": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt (January 30, 1882 - April 12, 1945), commonly known by his initials FDR, was the 32nd President of the United States who served from March 4, 1933, to his death on April 12, 1945. Franklin D. Roosevelt is best known for being the longest-serving U.S. President in history by breaking George Washington's two term tradition to ensure his country's success in World War II, because of this. Roosevelt is best remembered and universally appreciated as a successful commander-in-chief who led the United States through World War II, but he is also remembered well for his New Deal programs to challenge the Great Depression's impact on Americans, making him a hero to many of the American left-wing. Because of this, historians and scholars frequently rank Roosevelt, alongside Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, as of the top three greatest U.S. Presidents.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt is prominent for his New Deal program, a domestic package of legislation attempt to revive the United States from the Great Depression that occurred four years before Roosevelt became President in 1929, and forged a domestically progressive agenda in terms of banking, regulation, and a variety of things. Franklin D. Roosevelt led the United States through World War II, in which he was given a green light to act as Commander In Chief with the Pearl Harbor attacks made by the Japanese Empire, thus forcing the United States to enter the war, which enjoyed Churchill, not because America was invaded, but because America would have to join the British in taking down Hitler. Roosevelt was one of those fewer Presidents who died in office, only Kennedy was the last President to die in office.\n\nRoosevelt was born into wealth and privilege in Hyde Park, New York, in 1882, to James and Sara Roosevelt, he was educated at Groton and he graduated from Harvard and Columbia. Roosevelt dated and ultimately married his fifth cousin once removed and niece of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt: Eleanor Roosevelt, and had five surviving children, one died in infancy. Roosevelt was elected to the New York State Senate, he was then Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Navy, he was nominated by the U.S. Democratic Party for Vice President under James M. Cox to replace the unpopular Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, which explained the Democrats' blistering defeat in the 1920 U.S. presidential election to Warren G. Harding. Despite being struck with, what was assumed to be polio, Roosevelt held strong and continued on his political career, going on to become Governor of New York during the Great Depression. Roosevelt ran for President of the United States in 1932 against the bitterly unpopular Republican President Herbert Hoover, the man who had the unfortune to lead a country bleeding from the Great Depression. Roosevelt easily won the Presidency and badly crippled the Republican Party for decades to come, becoming known to political scientists as \"the fifth party system\", an era in U.S. politics in which the Democratic Party of Franklin D. Roosevelt had immense political influence.\n\nAs President, Roosevelt took on the Great Depression, establishing what wasn't normal at the time a greater political power of the U.S. federal government, to establish public works projects administered by newly established federal government agencies to run them, and passed a series of banking reforms to prevent another depression. Roosevelt established unemployment benefits, food stamps, social security, to support economically struggling Americans and those who are disabled and retired, and Roosevelt established big public works projects, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority, to help Americans get to work. Collectively known as \"the New Deal\" and while it cannot fight the global Great Depression, it did help Americans at a time help was badly needed. Roosevelt's next crisis: Hitler of Germany, Mussolini of Italy, and Hirohito of Japan threatened and invaded their neighbors in wars of conquest, ultimately starting World War II, which really escalated when Japan struck Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, a U.S. naval base in Hawaii (a U.S. territory then). Roosevelt took steps to respond, aligning himself with the already-embattled Churchill of Britain and Hitler's former ally Stalin of the Soviet Union. Controversially, Roosevelt's response to World War II also had a dark side: the internment of Japanese Americans on the suspicion that they might be loyal to enemy Japan. The tide of war turned on Hitler and his Axis allies, Roosevelt worked to establish a United Nations to succeed the unsuccessful League of Nations, and ensure the U.S. truly has a role and responsibility to oversee the world's problems.\n\nBecause of World War II, Roosevelt felt he had no option but to be elected President in an unusual two more terms after had previously served the last two, believing only he could lead a nation at war. The war took a heavy toll on Roosevelt, in addition to smoking and probably drinking heavily, and as the war is clearing moving in the Allies' favor against Hitler, Roosevelt died in office on April 12, 1945 at his Georgia retreat. Roosevelt was replaced by Vice President Harry S. Truman, who finished the war for Roosevelt by finishing Japan.\n\nBiography\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in Hyde Park, NY, in the Springwood estate belonging to James Roosevelt and Sara (nee Delano) Roosevelt, an only child of James and Sara, Franklin traveled with his father, but lived with his overly-loving mother. Franklin and James one time met with then President Grover Cleveland, where Cleveland told the young Franklin and he wished the boy would not be President, a wish that would not come true unfortunately for Cleveland. In 1905, Franklin married a distant blood relative, Eleanor Roosevelt, who happens to be the niece of another Roosevelt President, Theodore Roosevelt, who was also Franklin's fifth cousin, and went on to have five surviving children, only one would die in infancy. Franklin D. Roosevelt first became a State Senator for the New York State Senate, and then Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson, Vice Presidential candidate for the 1920 U.S. Presidential Election under James Cox, and then Governor of the State of New York.\n\nIn the height of Republican Party dominance by 1929, the economy crashed in 1929 under President Hoover's watch, Hoover had egg on his face when he attempted to raise tariffs to fix the economy, raised income taxes, etc, but none have worked, to be fair to Hoover, the Hoover Dam and the Empire State Building were successful projects, but Hoover got smashed in the 1930 midterm elections, Democrats finally having the House, gained seats in the Senate, and two years later, the Presidency will be next in line for takedown for the GOP. Roosevelt entered the 1932 race, successfully ran through the Democratic Party primary process, the convention, and then finally, defeated Hoover in one of the greatest landslide results in American History.\n\nWith the presidency and both chambers of Congress in his strong grasp, he enacted much of his New Deal agenda, which involved Social Security, the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority), unemployment benefits, the Civil Works Administration, the Civilian Conservation Corps, and among many others. He was reelected in such a massive landslide over his Republican challenger Alf Landon, in what was until 1984 with Reagan, the largest landslide in U.S. history. Roosevelt grew tired of the U.S. Supreme Court striking down his New Deal policies, so he proposed to pack the court with more seats to fill with New Deal friendly justices, but that proposal hits a brick wall with Congress, and the economy hits into a recession, his party lost massive seats except for congressional control in the 1938 midterm elections, Southern Democrats joined forces with Republicans to fight Roosevelt's progressive reforms, this alliance is called the conservative coalition.\n\nKnowing the drums of war is threatening America but having to deal with isolationist attitudes towards the idea of going to war, Roosevelt ran for third term, which was actually tried before by some Presidents before him, including another Roosevelt, but those pre-FDR presidents were never successful, but FDR actually won a third term in the 1940 presidential election, drumming back a Republican challenger, Wendell Wilkie. The Japanese invaded Pearl Harbor in what was then the U.S. Territory of Hawaii, that attack disintegrated America's isolationist mood and rallied around President Roosevelt for leadership, and that he provided. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan, then Germany subsequently, and America's WWII era begins. Roosevelt cruised to reelection in 1944 due to recent military successes for the U.S., prominently the D-Day invasion of Normandy. A fourth term for Roosevelt will be why term limits exist for the presidency.\n\nRoosevelt, unlike his three previous terms, could not finish his fourth term because he died on April 12, 1945, in his little white house in Warms Springs, Georgia, at age 63. Roosevelt was buried at his Springwood estate at Hyde Park, New York. Roosevelt was succeeded by his third Vice President, Harry S. Truman.\n\nToday, Roosevelt is listed on the top three greatest U.S. Presidents by historians, alongside Abraham Lincoln and George Washington. Americans with disabilities and those who retired rely on one of Roosevelt's landmark New Deal programs: Social Security, and Roosevelt being disabled himself struggled with polio, helping Americans and leading the country through tough times in a wheelchair is repeatedly note worthy and receives widespread praise and respect. Roosevelt also rebranded a beaten up Democratic Party into something new, the party of progress and an all hands on deck approach to governing to address the problems of the populace, and that has made the Democratic Party overwhelmingly successful for the rest of the mid 20th century.\n\nRole in Chawosauria\n\nU.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt wins the respect from Chawosaurians, Roosevelt is not known to Chawosaurians for his New Deal policies but he is often associated with World War II, and made Roosevelt one of Chawosauria's overwhelming WWII favorites.\n\nWorld War II is deeply pierced into the memory of Chawosauria, resulting in Roosevelt, including Stalin and Churchill, as well as Hitler, Hirohito, and Mussolini, favorite historical figures to study and write about, in terms of biographies, political ideologies, their political parties, and among other things about these men. It is Roosevelt who is the reason the U.S. Democratic Party, not the U.S. Republican Party, receives widespread attention and notice among the Chawosaurian populace, that Garfield Lucas Webster II and recently his son Sydney Lucas Webster, and other Chawosaurian Democrats including Lochlainn Wilkie MacKenzie VI, Johnathan Saint Nicholas Montgomery VII, and among others receive widespread media and public attention.\n\nGarfield Lucas Webster and Theodore McClellan, two of Chawosauria's Republican Prime Ministers, both supported Roosevelt, and occasionally voted for Roosevelt's party. Before Garfield Webster died in 1955, he thought of switching parties from Republican to Democrat, but died before he'd made that decision, thus dying a Republican.\n\nChawosauria's Supreme Leader Shang Jong Parker has sometimes been called \"Chawosauria's FDR\" for his record list of legislative accomplishments and his unifying leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic, just as President Roosevelt took on the Great Depression in the 1930s and the threat of fascism during the 1940s.\n\nSee also\n\nTBD"
