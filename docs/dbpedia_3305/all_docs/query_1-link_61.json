        "text": "Franklin D. Roosevelt and Conservation Volume One\n\nVOLUME ONE: 1911-1937\n\n128 ROOSEVELT TO NELSON C. BROWN, New York State College of Forestry, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York\n\n[WASHINGTON] March 8, 1933\n\nMY DEAR NELSON: As you know, the State College of Forestry has carried on tree plantings on the experimental acreage on my Creek Road Farm at Hyde Park for each of the last two years.1 As we are getting close to the tree-planting season again I wish you would take up with your associates the planting of an additional acreage next month.\n\nI have instructed William Plog, my mother's superintendent at Hyde Park, to have about five acres now in birch growth, cleared, and there is also other available land on the other side of the road. I am wholly willing to leave it to the College as to what type of trees to put in this year, as you will be able to continue the scheme of things started in 1931.\n\nIf you will let Mr. Plog know, at Hyde Park, if any of you want to go down ahead of time, he will meet you and you can arrange with him for such extra planting labor as will be necessary.\n\nI wish you would make a note of having a careful inspection made of the swamp area planted last year. The permanent tree crop consisted of tulip poplars and black walnuts and these were interspaced with, I think, red cedar and larch. This planting should be filled out to replace trees that have died. During the winter I had all the sprouts cut off from the stumps of the old trees that had been cut.2\n\nAlways sincerely yours,\n\n[FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT]\n\n[13:PPF 38:CT]\n\n1The Creek Road farm was about a mile and a half east of the Roosevelt house near the junction of Creek Road and State Route 9Â—G.\n\n2Brown replied March 17 and 28, 1933 (PPF 38), describing the plans for the tree planting. An article by him, \"President Has Long Practiced Forestry\" (New York Times, April 30, 1933, VIII, 1), describes generally the Roosevelt forest plantations. During the spring of 1933 some 36,000 trees were planted and in the fall Brown visited Hyde Park to make plans for the next year (Brown to Roosevelt, June 30, Sept. 23, 1933, PPF 38).\n\nIt is interesting, and typical of Roosevelt, that in the first week of his Presidency he should take time to write in some detail of his Hyde Park tree plantings. In his inaugural address of March 4, he had referred in passing to his reforestation-employment plan. Putting people to work, he said, could be \"accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources\" (Rosenman, ed., Public Papers, II, 13). On March 6 Roosevelt addressed a conference of state governors at the White House on problems requiring cooperation between the Federal and state governments. The speech as reported makes no mention of his reforestation plan but it was evidently discussed. A resolution proposed by Governor White of Ohio and approved by the conference endorsed the President's plan, \"not only as a measure for the conservation of the Nation's natural resources but also as an effective step toward the relief of unemployment.\" The governors undertook to ascertain what acreage was available for such a program (ibid., pp. 23-24).\n\n129 ROOSEVELT TO THE SECRETARIES OF WAR, INTERIOR, AGRICULTURE AND LABOR\n\nWASHINGTON, March 14, 1933\n\nMEMORANDUM . . . I am asking you to constitute yourselves an informal committee of the cabinet to coordinate the plans for the proposed civilian Conservation Corps. These plans include the necessity of checking up on all kinds of suggestions that are coming in relating to public works of various kinds. I suggest that the Secretary of the Interior act as a kind of clearing house to digest the suggestions and to discuss them with the other three members of this informal committee.1\n\n[FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT]\n\n[13:OF 268:CT]\n\n1Roosevelt described his plan for employment by means of conservation projects and other public works at a White House conference on the afternoon of March 9, 1933, attended by the Secretaries of War, Interior and Agriculture, the Budget Director, Interior Department Solicitor Edward C. Finney and Acting Judge Advocate General Kyle Rucker (aide memoire by Colonel Rucker, March 11, 1933, OF 268). According to this memorandum Roosevelt outlined a message to Congress \"to seek legislation toward the employment of 500,000 men to be engaged in various activities in the public service, and the project to be financed through a bond issue.\" Rucker and Finney were asked to draft a bill embodying his ideas and to report back at 9 o'clock that evening. This was done and after some further revision a draft was left with the President at 20:30 P. M. Rucker says that those previously mentioned were present, together with a number of House and Senate leaders.\n\nAn account by Finney states that he, in company with Rucker, drafted the bill on the basis of a one-page, unsigned memorandum that Roosevelt had brought with him to the March 9 afternoon conference (Finney to Helen L. Moore, Office of the Secretary, Interior Department, Feb. 12, 1953). Finney says: \"The J. A. G. suggested some minor changes in wording and . . . we took the draft to the White House about 9 P. M. F. D. R. was in upstairs study with Louis Howe, Sen. Joe Robinson and a Member of the House of Representatives. He read the draft and said I had failed to provide for condemnation of private property. I then dictated another section covering his suggestion. I recall Louis Howe told F. D. R. we should strike out some military term, think it was 'enlistment.'\" Finney also says that he returned Roosevelt's memorandum to him but it has not been found in the Roosevelt papers nor has search elsewhere brought it to light. A draft of the bill as it stood on March 11, with two additional sections (a waiver of compensation and a provision barring pensions), is present as an enclosure in Finney to Rucker, March 11, 1933 (OF 268).\n\nAnother account (unsigned) of the March 9 conferences is found in the Civilian Conservation Corps newspaper Happy Days of Sept. 30, 1933. Entitled, \"Drama Plays Part as Life is Breathed into the C. C. C.,\" this account agrees with Rucker's in regard to the drafting of the legislation and describes the administrative organization the President had in mind. It suggests that the only forms of public works discussed by him were reforestation, forest protection and flood control, and makes the point, perhaps worth noting, that the afternoon meeting was really not a conference: \"The new President asked few questions of the men he had called before him. He talked. He laid before them in great detail the plan which he had evolved to lend a very necessary hand of help to trees and to young men.\"\n\nApparently the memorandum here printed was suggested by Raymond Moley, to whom the Civilian Conservation Corps idea was described by Roosevelt on March 14, 1933. Moley says he made the suggestion, not only to forestall impulsive action on Roosevelt's part, \"but, at the same time, to give the Wagner-Costigan-LaFollette group, through Secretary Perkins, a legitimate chance to describe its broader recommendations\" (Moley, After Seven Years, pp. 173-174).\n\n130 PRESS CONFERENCE, Executive Offices of the White House, March 15, 1933, 10:25 A. M.\n\n[Excerpt] Q: . . . In plans for putting people to work, does that include a vast public works program?\n\nThe President: I knew you were going to ask me that question and I am not ready to answer it yet, for this reason: This is entirely off the record. There are quite a lot of other people who would like to see the bill made an all-inclusive bill; in other words, after a big public works program, after the Wagner Bill that failed in the last Session, or a modification of it along the La Follette-Costigan lines.1 I don't know yet whether the bill would be made all inclusive or whether it would be confined principally to this main thought of putting people to work on natural resources.\n\nQ. Isn't it the program of the Administration to put through that Wagner Bill for unemployment relief?2\n\nThe President: There is enough money in the R. F. C. on direct aid for municipalities to last until May, therefore it is a grave question as to whether that is the kind of emergency that ought to keep the Congress here.\n\nQ: How about Muscle Shoals, Mr. President? Would that be included in this plan, or will it be left until later on?\n\nThe President: I don't know. We are in the middle of a survey now as to where to put the men to work first.\n\nQ: How many men would be used on the forestry plan?\n\nThe President: On the National forests, the Forestry Bureau says two hundred thousand men.\n\nQ: What do you mean by the National forests? What are the National forests?\n\nThe President: You know a lot more about that than I do. There is the Shenandoah Forest, the Big Smoky; there is quite a lot of Federal land in Pennsylvania, some in New Hampshire and, of course, there is a very large acreage out west.\n\nQ: What do they do, cut down trees or plant trees?\n\nThe President: You are as bad as Mr. Hyde.3 We have to have another class here on it. The easiest way to explain it is this: Taking it all through the East where, of course, the unemployment is relatively the worst with far more people, nearly all of the so-called forest land owned by the Government is second, third or fourth growth landÂ—what we call scrub growth which has grown up on it. What does that consist of? Probably an average of four or five thousand trees to the acre little bits of trees, saplings and so forth. Proper forestation is not possible; in other words, you will never get a marketable timber growth on that kind of landÂ—plenty of cordwood and that is about all. But the timber supply, the lumber supply of the country, at the present rate of cutting we are using lumber somewhere around three to four times the rate of the annual growth. In other words, we are rapidly coming to an end of the natural lumber resources and the end is within sight and, unless something is done about it, we will become a very large lumber importing nation, the figures showing that it will be from 20 to 40 years when that will come about.\n\nNow, take this second, third, fourth growth land. Put men in there. Say there are five thousand of these saplings to the acre. Go in and cut out four thousand and leave one thousand. They go in there and take out the crooked trees, the dead trees, the bushes and stuff like that that has no value as lumber, and leave approximately one thousand trees to the acre. That means that they are sufficiently spaced to get plenty of light and air and there is not too much of a strain on the soil. Those trees then eventually will become a very valuable lumber crop.\n\nThat is the simplest way of explaining the operations so far as the trees themselves go.\n\nThen, in addition to that, one of our great difficulties all over the country is with fire, and these men will be put to work in building fire breaks. Well, a fire break is merely an operation of cutting a thirty or forty foot swath through the forest and plowing it up, raking all the leaves and everything possible away from that strip and keeping it clear.\n\nThus, from that time on, the regular forest rangers and fire protection people, in their tours, will have a great deal better chance of limiting any fire that breaks out, limiting it to a small area.\n\nQ: How long will that work keep these 200,000 men occupied? Is it a long process?\n\nThe President: I think Bob Wagner got the letter on that from the Forestry Bureau about six weeks or two months ago. It is certainly over a year and probably over a good deal longer than that.\n\n[13:PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCES:T]\n\n1On Feb. 9, 1933, Wagner (N. Y.) had introduced S. 5609 as an amendment to the 1932 Emergency Relief and Construction Act. His amendment would have removed the requirement that local public works be self-liquidating, would have lowered the interest rate, and would have enlarged the authority of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to make loans for public works. La Follette had urged a more daring, more comprehensive, attack on the joint relief-employment problem, with much greater appropriations contemplated. The La Follette-Costigan-Cutting bill, S. 1596, \"to create an administration of public works, to provide for the construction, extension, and improvement of public facilities and services, to relieve unemployment . . .,\" was introduced May 8, 1933, but was not acted upon (Cong. Rec., 72d Cong., 2d sess., 76:4, 3664, 4321; 76:5, 5525; 73d Cong., 1st sess., 77:3, 2966).\n\n2The Emergency Conservation Work Bill, approved March 31, 1933, post, 135.\n\n3Arthur M. Hyde, Secretary of Agriculture under President Hoover. See ante, 110 n.\n\n131 THE SECRETARIES OF WAR, INTERIOR, AGRICULTURE AND LABOR TO ROOSEVELT\n\n[WASHINGTON] March 15, 1933\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT: In response to your memorandum of March 14, 1933, the undersigned have considered not only the draft of the Bill with regard to the Civilian Conservation Corps, but also the whole program of relief for industrial unemployment.1 We are of the opinion that there are three items to be considered in this program:\n\n1. Federal appropriations for grants in aid to the various states for direct relief work. (The details of such a Bill are now practically agreed upon between Senators Wagner, Costigan, La Follette and Secretary Perkins.)\n\n2. A measure for a large practical, labor-producing program of public works under the control of a Board which can allocate them in such a manner as to drain the largest pools of unemployment in the country, and also arrange to taper off the public works when, and if, regular industrial employment picks up.\n\n3. A measure providing authority for the President to recruit a Civilian Conservation Corps for forestry work under the direction of the Army, Labor Department and Forestry Service. We are of the opinion that the work to be done by this Corps should be strictly limited to works which are not available as projects for public works, either by the National Government or the State governments, and that it is highly desirable that they should be specifically confined to forestry and soil erosion projects in the Bill.\n\nTo confine it to such projects specifically will overcome much of the growing alarm regarding the wisdom of this measure, and will serve to reassure those interested in the constructive permanent relief and stabilization of our population, that no enormous dislocation of population is anticipated with all of the social maladjustments which follow such a program. It will also relieve the minds of those who fear the depressing effect on the wage levels of free labor, due to the wide use of this recruited army, and also those who feel that works which should be done by contract by free labor will be progressively urged as suitable for the Conservation Corps, thus further limiting the opportunity to secure normal work and wages.\n\nWe respectfully suggest that these three measures be presented as three separate Bills, in order that the debate and discussion on them should be suitably divided and differentiated, but that they be introduced at the same time, at your request, and covered by a message from you in which you point out that this is a three-fold attack upon the suffering and distress caused by unemployment, that it is constructive, that it is generous, that it is flexible, and that prompt action upon the three Bills will really start the reconstruction period in the way in which the Democratic Party has promised, by beginning at the bottom with those who are the great wage-earning and purchasing class, and trusting that prosperity will work up through all of the groups in the country. The note of the definite intention to build up the purchasing power of the wage-earners as the true stimulant to business by making a market should also be emphasized, in our opinion.2\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[GEORGE H. DERN]\n\n[HAROLD L. ICKES]\n\n[HENRY A. WALLACE]\n\n[FRANCES PERKINS]\n\n[OF 268:CT]\n\n1This was done at a conference held on the morning of March 15 in the office of the Secretary of War (The Secret Diary of Harold L. Ickes, New York: Simon and Schuster, 1953, I, 7; hereinafter cited as Ickes' Diary).\n\n2The bill as originally drafted contemplated the employment of a civilian conservation corps in public works of all kinds: \". . . such as forestation on National and State lands, prevention of soil erosion, control of floods, river and harbor improvement, power development, reclamation, drainage, inland waterways, inter-coastal communications, roads and trails, and other public improvements . . .\" (section 2 of draft bill enclosed in Finney to Rucker, March 11, 1933, OF 268). Following the conference mentioned in the preceding note the bill was redrafted by Acting Judge Advocate General Rucker and the kind of work the proposed conservation corps could do was restricted to conservation projects such as \"forestation on the National and State lands, prevention of soil erosion, and construction, maintenance or repair of roads and trails on the public domain, the National parks, National forests, and other Government reservations (section 4 of draft bill enclosed in Rucker to Wallace, March 16, 1933, OF 268).\n\nIn discussing the proposed legislation, the newspapers stressed the assembling of the unemployed in camps at construction centers (cf. New York Times, March 11, 1933, p. 7). By March 13 the use of 200,000 men in reforestation and on projects \"such as the Tennessee basin development\" was being talked of; by March 14 the plan \"outlined by President Roosevelt prior to his inauguration\" was mentioned for the first time (ibid., March 14, 1933, p. 20; March 15, 1933, pp. 1, 3). Ickes, in his diary entry cited above, characterized the bill as one that would \"take unemployed men out of the crowded areas and put them to work in the national forests, etc.\"\n\n132 ROOSEVELT TO THE CONGRESS\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE, March 21, 1933\n\nTo THE CONGRESS: It is essential to our recovery program that measures immediately be enacted aimed at unemployment relief. A direct attack in [sic] this problem suggests three types of legislation.\n\nThe first is the enrolment of workers now by the Federal Government for such public employment as can be quickly started and will not interfere with the demand for or the proper standards of normal employment.\n\nThe second is grants to States for relief work.\n\nThe third extends to a broad public works labor creating program.\n\nWith reference to the latter I am now studying the many projects suggested and the financial questions involved. I shall make recommendations to the Congress presently.\n\nIn regard to grants to States for relief work, I advise you that the remainder of the appropriation of last year will last until May. Therefore, and because a continuance of Federal aid is still a definite necessity for many States, a further appropriation must be made before the end of this special session.\n\nI find a clear need for some simple Federal machinery to coordinate and check these grants of aid. I am, therefore, asking that you establish the office of Federal Relief Administrator, whose duty it will be to scan requests for grants and to check the efficiency and wisdom of their use.\n\nThe first of these measures which I have enumerated, however, can and should be immediately enacted. I propose to create a civilian conservation corps to be used in simple work, not interfering with normal employment, and confining itself to forestry, the prevention of soil erosion, flood control and similar projects. I call your attention to the fact that this type of work is of definite, practical value, not only through the prevention of great present financial loss, but also as a means of creating future national wealth. This is brought home by the news we are receiving today of vast damage caused by floods on the Ohio and other rivers.\n\nControl and direction of such work can be carried on by existing machinery of the departments of Labor, Agriculture, War and Interior.\n\nI estimate that 250,000 men can be given temporary employment by early summer if you give me authority to proceed within the next two weeks.\n\nI ask no new funds at this time. The use of unobligated funds, now appropriated for public works, will be sufficient for several months.\n\nThis enterprise is an established part of our national policy. It will conserve our precious natural resources. It will pay dividends to the present and future generations. It will make improvements in national and state domains which have been largely forgotten in the past few years of industrial development.\n\nMore important, however, than the material gains will be the moral and spiritual value of such work. The overwhelming majority of unemployed Americans, who are now walking the streets and receiving private or public relief, would infinitely prefer to work. We can take a vast army of these unemployed out into healthful surroundings. We can eliminate to some extent at least the threat that enforced idleness brings to spiritual and moral stability. It is not a panacea for all the unemployment but it is an essential step in this emergency. I ask its adoption.1\n\n[W. H. PRESS RELEASES:M]\n\n1This text is that of the official White House mimeographed press release; also present (Speech File) are the first and second drafts. The first draft was shortened by Roosevelt by about two hundred words and was otherwise revised by him. In the second he made four minor revisions in phrasing. Authorship of the draft is not indicated but the language suggests that it was composed by Roosevelt. A comparison of the text here printed with that sent to the Congress (microfilm in the Roosevelt Library) shows that in the latter one sentence was crossed out (at the end of the paragraph beginning, \"I ask no new funds . . .\"); this read: \"Before the close of the special session an additional appropriation will be necessary to carry the work on until the regular session. In other respects the texts are the same.\n\nIn the Senate this message was referred to the Committee on Education and Labor; in the House, to the Committee on Labor (Cong. Rec., 73d Cong., 1st sess., 77:1, 650, 659-660).\n\n133 HENRY A. WALLACE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, TO SENATOR DAVID I. WALSH OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n[WASHINGTON] Mar. 28, 1933\n\nDEAR SENATOR WALSH: The President has requested me to inform you that while he does not favor the use of any labor or men provided by Senate bill 598, as reported from your Committee1 to the Senate on March 27, for tree planting, forest improvement, or other work chiefly beneficial to the private land owner, he believes it essential to accomplish the full intent of the bill that an amendment to it be made, preferably after \"desirable\" in line 24, page 4, of the bill, as follows:\n\nProvided, That the President may in his discretion extend the provisions of this Act to lands owned by counties and municipalities and lands in private ownership, but only for the purpose of doing thereon such kinds of cooperative work as are now provided for by Acts of Congress in preventing and controlling forest fires and the attacks of forest tree pests and diseases and such work as is necessary in the public interest to control floods.\n\nThe President states that the public benefits to be derived from the cooperative work covered by the amendment in the furtherance of activities already authorized by Congress are so apparent that there can be no reasonable objection to its inclusion in the bill.2\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[HENRY A. WALLACE]\n\n[Notation: A] Noted War\n\n[13:OF 268:T:PHOTOSTAT]\n\n1Senate Committee on Education and Labor.\n\n2As introduced the bill did not provide for conservation work on county, municipal or private lands. The Forest Service had from the first urged that the bill also apply to lands other than Federal or state on the ground that Federal and state land holdings in the East were limited in extent and that it would be \"to the public interest to carry on a number of the contemplated activities on private lands for the purpose of developing and perpetuating the national timber supply and for other purposes of that general character\" (Acting Forester E. E. Carter to Tugwell, March 17, 1933, OF 268). Forester Stuart urged this before the joint committee hearings, pointing out that neglect of flood control work and disease and fire preventive measures on private lands could have serious effects on other parts of the watershed (Unemployment Relief, Joint Hearings before the Committee on Education and Labor, Senate, and the Committee on Labor, House of Representatives, 73d Cong., 1st sess., on S. 598, a Bill for the Relief of Unemployment through the Performance of Useful Public Work and for Other Purposes, March 23-24, 1933, Washington, 1933, pp. 6-7).\n\nThe committee took no action on Stuart's recommendation but the bill was amended in the Senate to permit forest fire and disease preventive measures and flood control work on county, municipal and private lands. Senator Walcott (Conn.), who introduced the amendment, made it clear that the President did not propose to use the act \"for tree planting, forest improvement, or other work chiefly beneficial to the private-land owner\" (Cong. Rec., 73d Cong., 1st sess., 77:1, 916-918).\n\n134 PRESS CONFERENCE, Executive Offices of the White House, March 29, 1933, 10:28 A. M.\n\n[Excerpt] Q: What type of organization are you going to set up to mobilize the unemployed on this forestation program?\n\nThe President: I cannot tell you anything definite yet. Probably I will have to have somebody to act as director of the whole works, but that means, of course, that he will have to work through existing Federal agencies. For instance, on the initial enrollment, it will be the Department of Labor plus Army facilities, such as trucks and things like that. Then the actual taking in of the men to camp and maintaining them at camp will be an Army feature and the actual work supervisionÂ—the supervision of the work will be either an Interior problem or an Agriculture problem, one or the other.\n\nQ: Or both.\n\nThe President: Or both.\n\nQ: Will that mean concentration camps?\n\nThe President: Do not use that word. It sounds too much like that which some of us older people remember as used in the Cuban episode of 1907 and 1908. I do not know what you could call them. They are merely way-stations to be used on the way to the camps, at which the boys will be properly treated, outfitted and given a complete medical examination. That is about all.\n\nQ: Why not call them cantonments?\n\nThe President: Well, a cantonment has a more permanent sound. I hope that we can keep them there just as short a time as possible. The Army, in talking in a preliminary way, says two weeks. I think that is much too long. I think we could keep them in camp a maximum of one week, which would be quite enough. It saves money to keep them out on the job as long as we can.\n\nQ: How soon do you think we can get them out, Mr. President?\n\nThe President: I should think we can get the first people enrolled within two weeks after the passage of the bill. That means they probably could not get to camp until three weeks. Of course, we cannot start off with 250,000 at one time. That will take quite a while.1\n\n[13:PRESIDENT'S PRESS CONFERENCES:T]\n\n1For a brief account by Roosevelt of the organization of the Civilian Conservation Corps, see note in Rosenman (ed.), Public Papers, II, 108-110. The file on the CCC in the Roosevelt Library is voluminous; with respect to its initial organization the following reports are especially important: Col. Duncan K. Major, Jr., War Department representative on the Emergency Conservation Work Advisory Board Council, to Fechner, June 30, 1933, and Fechner to Roosevelt, July 1, 1933 (OF 268). Both reports were issued as news releases on July 3, 1933.\n\n135 AN ACT FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEMPLOYMENT THROUGH THE PERFORMANCE OF USEFUL PUBLIC WORK, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES, approved March 31, 1933\n\nBe it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That for the purpose of relieving the acute condition of widespread distress and unemployment now existing in the United States, and in order to provide for the restoration of the country's depleted natural resources and the advancement of an orderly program of useful public works, the President is authorized, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe and by utilizing such existing departments or agencies as he may designate, to provide for employing citizens of the United States who are unemployed, in the construction, maintenance and carrying on of works of a public nature in connection with the forestation of lands belonging to the United States or to the several States which are suitable for timber production, the prevention of forest fires, floods and soil erosion, plant pest and disease control, the construction, maintenance or repair of paths, trails and fire lanes in the national parks and national forests, and such other work on the public domain, national and State, and Government reservations incidental to or necessary in connection with any projects of the character enumerated, as the President may determine to be desirable: Provided, That the President may in his discretion extend the provisions of this Act to lands owned by counties and municipalities and lands in private ownership, but only for the purpose of doing thereon such kinds of co-operative work as are now provided for by Acts of Congress in preventing and controlling forest fires and the attacks of forest tree pests and diseases and such work as is necessary in the public interest to control floods. The President is further authorized, by regulation, to provide for housing the persons so employed and for furnishing them with such subsistence, clothing, medical attendance and hospitalization, and cash allowance, as may be necessary, during the period they are so employed, and, in his discretion, to provide for the transportation of such persons to and from the places of employment. That in employing citizens for the purposes of this Act no discrimination shall be made on account of race, color, or creed; and no person under conviction for crime and serving sentence therefor shall be employed under the provisions of this Act. The President is further authorized to allocate funds available for the purposes of this Act, for forest research, including forest products investigations, by the Forest Products Laboratory.\n\nSec. 2. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act the President is authorized to enter into such contracts or agreements with States as may be necessary, including provisions for utilization of existing State administrative agencies, and the President, or the head of any department or agency authorized by him to construct any project or to carry on any such public works, shall be authorized to acquire real property by purchase, donation, condemnation, or otherwise, but the provisions of section 355 of the Revised Statutes shall not apply to any property so acquired.\n\nSec. 3. Insofar as applicable, the benefits of the Act entitled \"An Act to provide compensation for employees of the United States suffering injuries while in the performance of their duties, and for other purposes,\" approved September 7, 1916, as amended, shall extend to persons given employment under the provisions of this Act.\n\nSec. 4. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act, there is hereby authorized to be expended, under the direction of the President, out of any unobligated moneys heretofore appropriated for public works (except for projects on which actual construction has been commenced or may be commenced within ninety days, and except maintenance funds for river and harbor improvements already allocated), such sums as may be necessary; and an amount equal to the amount so expended is hereby authorized to be appropriated for the same purposes for which such moneys were originally appropriated.\n\nSec. 5. That the unexpended and unallotted balance of the sum of $300,000,000 made available under the terms and conditions of the Act approved July 21, 1932, entitled \"An Act to relieve destitution,\" and so forth, may be made available, or any portion thereof, to any State or Territory or States or Territories without regard to the limitation of 15 per centum or other limitations as to per centum.\n\nSec. 6. The authority of the President under this Act shall continue for the period of two years next after the date of the passage hereof and no longer.\n\nApproved, March 31st 1933.1\n\n[48 Stat. 22]\n\n1The importance of this act among the conservation measures of Roosevelt's administration, and his intimate connection with it, warrant its publication here. The original bill was introduced in the Senate on March 21, 1933, as S. 598, by Senators Robinson (Ark.) and Wagner (N. Y.), and in the House on the same date as H. R. 3905, by Representative Byrns (Tenn.) (Cong. Rec., 73d Cong., 1st sess., 77:1, 652, 701). The bill authorized the President to create a civilian conservation corps from the unemployed to be used on public works such as reforestation, prevention of soil erosion and of floods; no limitation, however, was placed on the kind of projects. An enrollment period of one year was provided for, with no discharge during this period without permission (\"except under such rules or regulations as the President may decide\"), and a $30 per month pay limit. (A copy of the bill as introduced may be found in the New York Times of March 22, 1933, p. 2, and in the hearings cited below.)\n\nThe Senate Committee on Education and Labor and the House Committee on Labor held joint hearings on the Senate bill on March 23-24, 1933. Representatives of organized labor opposed the measure as militaristic and degrading to labor, referring to the proposed use of the Army in recruiting and supervising the men, the fixed enrollment period, and the low, fixed rate of pay (Unemployment Relief, 73d Cong., 1st sess., Joint Hearings on S. 598, Washington, 1933, pp. 44-61, 63-67). (The hearings are summarized in some detail in Charles Price Harper, The Administration of the Civilian Conservation Corps, Clarksburg, W. Va., 1939.) In consequence of the opposition of labor, the Senate bill was rewritten by the Senate committee: the fixed wage and fixed term of enlistment were removed, and conditions of employment were left to the discretion of the President. (A section-by-section comparison of the second bill with the first was made by Senator Walsh in reporting the new version, Cong. Rec., 77:1, 861-872.) A report on the House bill, as amended, is printed, Unemployment Relief, 73d Cong., 1st sess., H. Rept. 13 to accompany H. R. 3905 (Washington, 1933).\n\nIn the Senate the bill was criticized for the wide and undefined powers it gave to the President, and the provision permitting the use of unobligated public works funds (section 4) aroused fears that these funds would not be reappropriated. The authorization given to the President to acquire real property in administering the act aroused fears that unwarranted additions would be made to the public domain; on the other hand, representatives of states with little available public land feared that their states would derive no benefit from the proposed reforestation work. Senate amendments included a provision to extend the act to county, municipal and private lands in furtherance of existing cooperative forest fire and flood control measures (in section 1 of the act as approved); a provision barring the acquisition of lands unless they were contiguous to existing public lands (later repealed by the House); and sections 5 and 6 in their entirety (Cong. Rec., 77:1,866-872, 929-937).\n\nIn the House the Senate bill as amended was taken up in lieu of the House bill. It was criticized as being anti-labor, deflationary and paternalistic. Its defenders argued that it was a relief, not an employment, bill, and pointed out its merits as a conservation measure: the forests to be created would be economically profitable; there was need for protection against forest fires and diseases; forests would prevent floods and erosion; and it would be possible, under the bill, to protect the new second-growth forests of the South. Of the numerous amendments offered, two were adopted: the anti-discriminatory provision in section 1, and one repealing the restriction (added by the Senate) on the President's authority to acquire real property. The Senate accepted the House changes on March 30 and the President signed the bill on March 31, 1933 (ibid., pp. 953-954, 954-995, 1012-1013, 1102).\n\nThere is in the Roosevelt Library a typed copy of the bill as rewritten by the joint committee, sent by Senator Walsh to Roosevelt with a note, March 25, 1933 (OF 268), asking if he had \"any suggestions as to modifications or changes.\" Also present is a printed copy of the bill as passed by the Senate on March 28, 1933, with the Senate amendments underscored, and bearing the notation \"From Cong Byrns 3/29Â— 1215 p.m.\"\n\n136 AN EMERGENCY CONSERVATION WORK CHART PREPARED BY ROOSEVELT, April 3, 1933\n\n[13:OF 268:AS:Photostat]1\n\n1The date of this chart is approximate. Roosevelt may have sketched it at a White House conference held on April 3, 1933, at which a plan of enlisting the unemployed and of getting them to the camps was decided upon. (It will be noted that he misspelled Fechner's name.) Those present were Horace Albright, director of the National Park Service, John D. Coffman, fire control expert for the Park Service, William G. Howard, of the New York State Conservation Department, Forester R. Y. Stuart, Assistant Forester C. M. Granger, Col. Duncan K. Major, Jr., of the War Department, and W. Frank Persons, of the Labor Department (New York Times, April 4, 1933, p. 15). By Executive Order 6101, April 5, 1933, Roosevelt appointed Robert Fechner Director of Emergency Conservation Work and established the agency's form of organization. (A four-page memorandum from Acting Judge Advocate General Rucker to the Chief of Staff, March 27, 1933, commenting on a draft executive order to carry out the law, is present, OF 268.)\n\nFechner (1876-1939), a machinist by trade, was from 1913 to 1933 executive officer of the International Association of Machinists. His appointment was intended to be an assurance to labor that it had nothing to fear from the Emergency Conservation Work Act.\n\n137 ROOSEVELT TO THE CONGRESS\n\n[THE WHITE HOUSE] April 10, 1933\n\nTO THE CONGRESS: The continued idleness of a great national investment in the Tennessee Valley leads me to ask the Congress for legislation necessary to enlist this project in the service of the people.\n\nIt is clear that the Muscle Shoals development is but a small part of the potential public usefulness of the entire Tennessee River. Such use, if envisioned in its entirety, transcends mere power development: it enters the wide fields of flood control, soil erosion, afforestation, elimination from agricultural use of marginal lands, and distribution and diversification of industry. In short, this power development of war days leads logically to national planning for a complete river watershed involving many States and the future lives and welfare of millions. It touches and gives life to all forms of human concerns.\n\nI, therefore, suggest to the Congress legislation to create a Tennessee Valley AuthorityÂ—which is a corporation clothed with the power of government but possessed of the flexibility and initiative of a private enterprise. It should be charged with the broadest duty of planning for the proper use, conservation and development of the natural resources of the Tennessee River drainage basin and its adjoining territory for the general social and economic welfare of its inhabitants the nation. This Authority should also be clothed with the necessary power to carry these plans into effect. Its duty should be the rehabilitation of the Muscle Shoals development and the coordination of it with the wider plan.\n\nMany hard lessons have taught this nation us the human waste that results from lack of planning. Here and there a few wise cities and counties have looked ahead and a few counties also have planned. But our nation has \"just grown.\" It is time to extend planning to a wider field, in this instance comprehending in one great project many States directly concerned with the basin of one of our greatest rivers.\n\nThis in a true sense is a return to the spirit and vision of the pioneer. If we are successful here we can march on, step by step, in a like development of other great natural territorial units within our borders.1\n\n[FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT]\n\n[SPEECH FILE:T]\n\n1This text is the final draft of three drafts (no copy of the message as sent to the Congress is present). All the deletions and interpolations (the latter shown by italic) are in Roosevelt's hand; with the changes indicated the text is that as read in the Congress on April 10, 1933.\n\nSenator Norris (Nebr.) had been asked by Roosevelt in a note of March 13, 1933 (OF 44), to consult with him on the Tennessee Valley development: \"We must decide very soon on procedure and if the Congress should take recess for three weeks, I think we should have the bill ready as soon as the Congress resumes. Norris, with Representative McSwain (S. C.) and Representative Hill (Ala.), met with the President on April 1 and 7 and discussed the legislation contemplated (PPF IÂ—O). After the first of these conferences Norris likened the proposed Tennessee Valley bill to the CCC bill and said that it would be \"the start of a national program . . . providing for reforestation, control of flood waters, utilization of marginal lands and development of power\" (New York Times, April 2, 1933, p. 18). Roosevelt, in a lengthy note to his Congressional message as printed in Rosenman (ed.), Public Papers, II, 122-129, linked his New York State experience in land-use planning with the Tennessee Valley project and referred to the latter as \"regional planning on a scale never attempted before.\"\n\nOn April 11 Norris introduced S. 1272, \"To improve the navigability and to provide for the flood control of the Tennessee River, to provide for reforestation and the proper use of marginal lands in the Tennessee Valley; to provide for the agricultural and industrial development of said valley; to provide for the national defense by the creation of a corporation for the operation of Government properties at and near Muscle Shoals in the State of Alabama, and for other purposes.\" Rankin (Miss.) introduced the companion bill, H. R. 4883, in the House on the same day, and McSwain (S. C.) introduced a somewhat different measure, H. R. 4859, also on the same day. On April 20, Hill (Ala.) introduced another bill, H. R. 5081 (Cong. Rec., 73d Cong., 1st sess., 77:2, 1460, 1531, 2055). The House took up the last-named bill and the act as approved May 18, 1933, was the result of conferences on the Norris and Hill bills.\n\nDuring the debate the question arose of the extent of Roosevelt's participation in the drafting of the legislation. McSwain said that the President had not drafted either of the bills but had considered only their \"general broad principles\" (ibid., 77:2, 2179). Considering the highly technical character of the legislation, it would seem that the explanation should have been unnecessary. As a matter of fact.\n\nRoosevelt did suggest that provision of the act by which the Tennessee Valley Authority was permitted to issue bonds for the construction of electric power or transmission facilities, although Norris was afraid the bonds would be unsaleable (ibid., 77:3, 2662).\n\nIn the course of the opening debate on the bill (during discussion of the imposition of limited debate) Representative Carpenter (Nebr.), a Democrat, expressed doubt that it was an Administration measure. O'Connor (N. Y.), answered by saying that he understood it was, although he did not \"speak with any personal authority\" (ibid., 77:2, 2179). This is curious in light of the message itself.\n\n138 ROBERT Y. STUART, FORESTER, FOREST SERVICE, TO HENRY A. WALLACE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE\n\n[WASHINGTON] April 18, 1933\n\nDEAR MR. SECRETARY: As a corollary to the memorandum of even date in relation to the purchase of national-forest lands with funds made available by the Act approved March 31, 1933,1 it may be well to comment on the land phase of the general forest situation as determined and understood by the Forest Service, and thus make it evident that the recommended program of forest-land acquisition is in full accord with the definitely established trends in forest economy and forest-land ownership.\n\nYour letter of March 28 to the President of the Senate, transmitting the report required by the Copeland resolution,2 stated that practically all of the major problems of American forestry center in, or have grown out of, private ownership; that first among the assured means of approaching a satisfactory solution of the forest problem are a large extension of public ownership and more intensive management on all publicly-owned lands. Such vital requirements as the protection of major watersheds, the restoration to forest cover of lands unwisely cleared for farm-crop production, the redemption of forest lands that have been depleted or denuded by destructive forms of logging, followed by fire or unchecked attacks of insects or disease will not be met by private initiative; sometimes because of sheer inertia, sometimes because of unsound tendencies towards quick exploitation, and sometimes because the costs while justified by general public benefits can not be compensated by direct financial returns to owners. Where these conditions exist, public ownership is the sole means of protecting imperative requirements of public welfare.\n\nAs a feature of the Copeland report, an analysis was made by forest types and regions of the probable extent to which private ownership could and would meet essential requirements of public interest in the management of their lands. The net conclusion was that if the economic and social values of the forest lands now privately owned are adequately to be safeguarded and conserved, public ownership of approximately 224 million acres of such lands eventually will be inevitable.\n\nThe calculation is, of course, somewhat theoretical and factors now unforeseen may modify it in some degree, but it seems clearly evident that public ownership of forest lands must in time triple or quadruple in area.\n\nIt was assumed that the States containing these lands would recognize an obligation and would have a desire to protect, manage, and administer them to the fullest degree permitted by their constitutional and financial limitation. A careful analysis of present and prospective State plans and programs indicated that the States would not be prepared to assume ownership of and adequately protect and manage more than 90,000,000 acres of this new public domain. Approximately 134 million acres thus would become an obligation upon the Federal Government; unless it were to remain subject to neglect and deterioration ultimately destructive of its major social and economic values and services.\n\nEven if subjected to heavy discounts, these determinations indicate in a striking way that the early purchase of eight million acres of land by the Federal Government would be wholly consistent with the whole trend of land economy and subject to no criticism other than on the grounds of inadequacy.3\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.

HOWE: On April 17 I mentioned to you a request made of me by Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace that I submit a plan for the use of $25,000,000 of the funds made available by the Act of March 31, 1933, \"For the relief of unemployment through the performance of useful public work, and for other purposes,\" for the purchase of forest lands and related agricultural lands.\n\nSecretary Wallace informed me that the President had expressed as his desire that there be set up from the funds above mentioned the sum of $25,000,000 for the purchase of approximately 8,000,000 acres of forest land and related agricultural land, at an average price of about $3.00 per acre.\n\nThe attached memorandum of April 18 from me to Secretary Wallace, approved by him on April 19, is accordingly submitted for the consideration of the President.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nR. Y. STUART\n\n[13:OF 268:TS]\n\n140 [Enclosure] ROBERT Y. STUART TO HENRY A. WALLACE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE\n\nWASHINGTON, April 18, 1933\n\nDEAR MR. SECRETARY: Reference is made to the President's suggestion anent the use of $25,000,000 of the funds made available by the Act approved March 31, 1933, for the purchase of forest lands and related agricultural lands at an average price of $3.00 per acre:\n\nUnder the provisions of the so-called Weeks and Clarke-McNary Laws, the Secretary of Agriculture, with the approval and concurrence of the National Forest Reservation Commission, hitherto has established 42 purchase areas, within 20 of the States east of the Great Plains, within which to acquire lands for national-forest purposes. In 31 of these units, situated in 19 of the States, there has been purchased or is in process of purchase an aggregate of 4,727,680 acres; and there has been reserved from the public domain or transferred from other departments or acquired by exchange a total of 2,503,875 acres; so that the total area under Federal control is now 7,231,555 acres. These areas are all under active field management, protection, and administration.\n\nThe remaining 11 purchase areas, including the one in Kentucky which now has no National Forests, contain no land under Federal control and are not under field protection and management, but they have been carefully examined and covered by detailed reports; and contain a great deal of land that has been examined, appraised, and optioned by the owners at prices believed to be acceptable to the National Forest Reservation Commission.\n\nWithin the 31 areas under administration, there are approximately 5,122,266 acres of private lands believed to be chiefly valuable for forest purposes and integrally related to the lands now under Federal control. In the other 11 units there are approximately 1,828,900 acres of lands of the same classes. Contiguous to the boundaries of the 42 established units are certain areas integrally related thereto which might properly and eventually should be acquired for national-forest purposes, involving 688,576 acres.\n\nThen, additionally, there are within the 42 units approximately 989,000 acres not hitherto considered for Federal purchase because they were believed to be more valuable for agriculture than for forestry. Recent economic trends have tended to reduce their value for farm-crop production and the prices at which they can be acquired by purchase. It seems safe to assume that one-third of these so-called agricultural lands could be acquired at prices which would not raise the average price of all the lands above $3.00 per acre.\n\nThe total minimum area that could be purchased within these 42 established units is therefore approximately 7,969,700 acres; comprising all of the lands now classified as chiefly valuable for forestry, and one third of the lands hitherto regarded as agricultural. The facts available are insufficient to justify specific guarantees, since the prices acceptable to the owners under present conditions have not definitely been determined. It is, however, the belief that practically all these lands could be purchased for $25,000,000.\n\nBut a factor demanding consideration is that in addition to the payments actually made for the lands, there are certain costs incident to their purchase, namely, for examinations, cruises, appraisals, negotiations, surveys, title examinations, etc. In the past these costs have averaged about 15 per centum of total expenditures, but it is believed that hereafter they can be held to 12 per centum. If $25,000,000 were the maximum available for expenditure, $3,000,000 would be necessary to cover costs of purchase, leaving $22,000,000 to pay for lands; an amount hardly sufficient to acquire all of the lands above described. The alternative would be to make an additional allotment to cover the cost of purchasing $25,000,000 worth of lands, which would be approximately $3,415,000. In view of the limit of $25,000,000 tentatively suggested by the President, the alternative is not being recommended, although it would better promote the general program.\n\nIn my judgment, such an expenditure of the available funds would be productive of the best net results, both to forestry and to the movement for unemployment relief, for the following reasons:\n\n1. The 42 units are situated in 20 different States, viz: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n2. The 42 units were selected and established because they represented the most acute need for Federal action in relation to the whole range of forest types and entire problem of watershed protection and reforestation.\n\n3. Thirty-one of the units are under active field management with resident personnel, detailed plans of management, at least partial systems of protective and administrative improvements, excellent records of ownership, etc. The other 11 are covered by preliminary plans of management, for most of them ownership records are available and in several the work of examining and appraising land was well under way when the purchase activities were suspended. In the Cumberland Unit in Kentucky, for example, 107,138 acres were examined, appraised and largely optioned but could not be acquired. In the new Mesaba Unit in Minnesota 15,724 acres covered by options were passed over.\n\n4. The agricultural lands embraced in these units largely are of submarginal character and mainly related in the same ownerships with lands chiefly valuable for forest purposes. They are the types of agricultural lands which properly can be withdrawn from farm-crop production and dedicated to timber production.\n\n5. The work of acquisition could be quickly initiated and consummated. The preliminary investigations have all been made. Much of the land has been examined and appraised. The landowners are familiar with the procedure of Federal purchase. Questions relating to titles, as affected by State laws, largely have been worked out. More than one million acres undoubtedly could be purchased during the first six months and with adequate funds available the purchase of the entire area largely could be accomplished within a couple of years, provided the owners of the lands were willing to accept fair prices. Should a tendency to ask unreasonable prices develop, the establishment of new purchase areas would create equivalent and alternative fields for purchases.\n\n6. The intermingled private lands add largely to the difficulty and cost of administering the lands now under public control, particularly in relation to the present program of unemployment relief. Each tract passed to Federal ownership would reduce costs of protection and administration and enhance the opportunity for effective employment of the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n\n7. Standards of soil and timber valuation have been worked out and established in all but a few of the units and are known to the landowners therein, so that the delays incident to the initiation of purchases in new areas would be avoided.\n\nI, therefore, submit the following recommendations for your consideration:\n\nA. That the program of forest-land purchase outlined above, or so much of it as can be accomplished with funds available, be approved as the most urgent and desirable initial action toward (1) the adequate extension of the national policy of forest-land protection and management, and (2) creating the most favorable conditions for the effective employment of the Civilian Conservation Corps authorized by the Act approved March 31, 1933, and that the Forester be authorized to carry it into execution as rapidly as practicable.\n\nB. That to carry out this program, $25,000,000 be allocated for expenditure by the Secretary of Agriculture, with the approval of the National Forest Reservation Commission, in conformity with the procedure established by the Act of March 1, 1911 (36 Stat. 961) as amended, and the long established practices developed under that act.\n\nC. That not to exceed 12 per centum of said $25,000,000 be allotted to cover the costs of land examination, cruises, appraisal, survey, title examination, and other expenses incident to purchase; that the Forester be authorized, subject to your approval, to temporarily employ such additional technical or other personnel as may be required to perform such duties as can not be performed by the regular personnel of the Forest Service, and that to facilitate such employment the usual Civil Service restrictions shall be waived with the understanding that so far as practicable selections for appointment shall be made from the Civil Service registers where available and time permits.1\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR. Y. STUART\n\nApproved: April 19, 1933.\n\nH. A. WALLACE, Secretary of Agriculture\n\n[13:OF 268:TS]\n\n1On May 12, 1933, the National Forest Reservation Commission endorsed the recommendations of this memorandum (Dern to Roosevelt, May 12, 1933, OF 268). On May 20, 1933, Roosevelt allocated (by Executive Order 6135) $20,000,000 for purchase of forest lands within the forty-two existing national forest purchase units. The complete acquisition of these units required the further purchase of 7,600,000 acres but progress toward this had stopped for lack of funds. Although a number of difficulties arose which hindered the immediate beginning of the purchase program, by the end of the summer Forester Stuart was able to say that the stimulus of the new fund was \"tremendous\": \"The incomplete condition of the purchase units was a serious obstacle to the most effective use of the Civilian Conservation Corps on the eastern national forests. But the whole outlook was changed literally overnight when the new fund was unexpectedly made available by the President\" (Report of the Forester, 1933, Washington, 1933, p. 15).\n\n141 ROOSEVELT TO SENATOR CLARENCE C. DILL OF WASHINGTON\n\n[WASHINGTON] April 20, 1933\n\nMY DEAR SENATOR DILL: I have your letter of April 17th in regard to the Columbia Basin project in which you suggest that, under the laws of the State of Washington, a power district or irrigation district could be formed and, after securing a permit from the Federal Power Commission, could build a dam and make contracts for sale of power, thus making possible an application to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for a loan as a self-liquidating project.1\n\nMay I give you what amounts to a snap judgment, because of the fact that I have not had any opportunity to make a study of the details of the Columbia Basin project?\n\nFirst, I still hold to the thought in my speech in Portland, Oregon, last autumn that the Columbia Basin development is national in its scope and should be developed after careful national planning. It affects, of course, a number of States.\n\nSecond, I see no objection to a partial development of a dam site through a State regional public body, provided three factors are presentÂ— (a) that the plans fit in with the board general plan for the development of the ValleyÂ— (b) that the works undertaken be so constructed as to enable them to be added to and not torn down when a larger development takes placeÂ— (c) that the project be self-sustaining.\n\nThird, if the plan can be worked out on a self-sustaining basis, I see no reason why it should not be financed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the same manner as they have already financed several large projects like the San Francisco Bridge and similar large undertakings.\n\nFourth, it is my thought at the present time that the features involving irrigation of new lands should be deferred until such time as existing lands suitable for agriculture have been taken up.\n\nIf the State of Washington is prepared to discuss this whole matter further, I shall be glad to have it taken up by representatives of the several Federal Departments involved. These would seem to me to be Interior, Agriculture, Labor and War Departments, and also the Federal Power Commission.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT]\n\nRT\n\n[13:OF 360:CT]\n\n1Dill also said, \"During all the investigations on this project, irrigation has been one of the prime factors considered, but we are more and more convinced that this should be built as a power project with irrigation considered as an incidental factor\" (OF 360). Although consideration of power conservation as such is outside the scope of this work, certain documents showing Roosevelt's views on regional planning have been included.\n\n142 ROOSEVELT TO LEWIS W. DOUGLAS, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF THE BUDGET\n\nWASHINGTON, April 24, 1933\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR LEWIS DOUGLAS: What do you think of this suggestion which I have had the Chief Forester explore?1\n\nMy thought is that if we have to continue the Civilian Conservation Corps for a second year, as seems likely, a land purchase for some sum, not to exceed $25,000,000, would give us plenty of land to establish the camps on.\n\nF. D. R.2\n\n[13:OF 268:T]\n\n1Above. (The title of the head of the Forest Service at this time was \"The Forester\" but he was commonly addressed as \"Chief Forester.\")\n\n2Although not signed by hand, this is the ribbon copy of the memorandum. Many of Roosevelt's brief notes to members of the White House staff and to agency officials (he called them \"chits\") were left unsigned, his typed initials taking the place of his signature. Since they were dictated by him and typed by his secretary (Marguerite LeHand, and after June, 1941, Grace Tully), they are, however, more personal in character than letters drafted by others. Virtually all of Roosevelt's brief notes of this sort, whether signed or not, may be considered to have been dictated by him.\n\n143 LEWIS W. DOUGLAS, DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF THE BUDGET, TO ROOSEVELT\n\nWASHINGTON, Apr. 26, 1933\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT: If ordinary expenditures are brought within revenues in 1934, it will be only by the narrowest margin. I see no possibility of providing for the Conservation Corps out of revenues. This being so, it seems to me that an expenditure for land ought to be avoided if possible.\n\nI observe from [t]he Forester's letter that 7,231,555 acres in the states east of the great plains are now under Federal control.1 The Forester says that these areas are all under active field management, protection, and administration, but, liberal as the Forest Service appropriations may be, it seems highly improbable that this can imply that there is no work to be done in these areas.\n\nMay I have your permission to go into the matter with the Forester, in order to determine whether presently-controlled areas do not offer a sufficiently wide scope for Conservation Corps activities?\n\nL.

PRESIDENT: This Department feels much concerned over the lack of control of the grazing of livestock on the public domain, resulting in the destruction of forage and in serious soil deterioration.\n\nA bill, H. R. 11816, jointly approved by this Department and the Department of Agriculture, passed the lower House on February 7, 1933, but failed of enactment in the Senate.1 The bill in question would give the Secretary of the Interior broad powers to limit and regulate the use of the public domain for grazing purposes with the view to preventing partial or total destruction of a natural resource which is essential for our future well being.

THOMPSON, Red Bank, New Jersey\n\n[WASHINGTON] May 1, 1933\n\nDEAR GERALDINE: I am thrilled at the thought of your place becoming the first Dutchess County Park and you are doing a splendid thing for the County in memory of Margaret.1\n\nBecause this Park may be the forerunner of other parks and, indeed, of a County Park system, I am anxious that the mistakes of Westchester County and Monroe County and Erie County should be avoided. In each of these counties the Park system became a tail of various political kites and led to all sorts of extravagances.\n\nThat is why it is terribly important not to let the control of the Park get into the hands of the Board of Supervisors or of any political group. This, however, is a difficult condition because the maintenance funds probably must come from the County authorities.\n\nThere is one possible method that would serve as assurance for non-political control for some time to come in any event. This would be the obtaining of a special Charter from the Legislature creating a non-profit corporation to receive and hold the land and maintain it for public use, under regulations to be laid down by the Trustees, who would be named in the Charter and be self-perpetuating. These Trustees could then go to the Board of Supervisors and offer to open the Park, provided the County appropriated the funds.\n\nYou could best get advice by seeing either John Mack or Henry Hackett or whoever your lawyer is in Poughkeepsie.2\n\nI do not need to tell you that I shall be delighted to talk with you about it at any time.\n\nAlways sincerely,\n\n[FRANKLIN D.

I think it very important to put some camps into the prairie states. Senators and Congressman from Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas say that in most of these States the State government has flood control or soil erosion projects already engineered and capable of being started at once.\n\nI wish you would make an effort to get some camps started on this work.\n\nWill you let me know what you can do?1\n\nF.D.R.\n\n[13:OF 268:T]\n\n1This refers to an undated letter from some of the senators and representatives of the states named (and also Ohio), asking that water conservation projects be established in their areas as a necessary preliminary to forestation programs (OF 268). Fechner replied May 6, 1933 (OF 268), that a definite plan had already been worked out for Iowa, and that as soon as the governors of the other states agreed to certain conditions he would cooperate with the state authorities in locating the work camps. The location of all work camps and the character of the work to be done on them had to be approved by Fechner and the President before the camps were set up (memoranda by Fechner, April 17 and 18, 1933, OF 268). Through Fechner and the departmental representatives Roosevelt kept in touch not only with major policy and administrative matters but also with details of camp conditions, costs, health of the men, the numbers enrolled in the various camps and personnel.\n\n147 ROOSEVELT TO REPRESENTATIVE JOSEPH W. BYRNS OF TENNESSEE\n\n[WASHINGTON] May 11, 1933\n\nMY DEAR MR. BYRNS: I have not had an opportunity to write you and your colleagues before this in regard to the reforestation of private lands.1 The point is that the Federal Government cannot properly undertake to reforest privately owned lands without some provision for getting its money back when the timber matures. If the State of Tennessee could make some arrangement to attain this end with the owners of the land, that would be a different story. I know you will see the objective. As a matter of fact, there is plenty of Federal and State owned land to keep us busy for a year or two. In the meanwhile it is worth exploring the private land problem.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[FRANKLIN D.

STUART, FORESTER, FOREST SERVICE, TO HENRY A. WALLACE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE\n\nWASHINGTON, May 12, 1933\n\nDEAR MR. SECRETARY: Attached is a copy of legislation which would carry out the recommendations of the Departmental Report on Senate Resolution 175.1\n\nTo facilitate review a summary of this proposed legislation is also attached.\n\nThe principal recommendations of the Departmental report are for a substantial increase in public ownership of forest land and for placing this land in productive condition, and these recommendations are reflected in the proposed bill. In addition, necessary provisions for strengthening cooperation with the States in order to afford a better opportunity for the practice of forestry on private lands are included, as is also some strengthening of the research which is necessary if the forestry enterprise is to succeed.\n\nThe present Administration is making a splendid contribution to the development of American forestry. The proposed legislation would follow this up, round it out, and make it a permanent contribution.\n\nThe proposed legislation would be a contribution of first magnitude toward the solution of our national problem of land use.\n\nLegislation such as that proposed would make the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt rival, if not surpass, that of Theodore Roosevelt in the furtherance of the forestry enterprise and all that this means in the future economic and social welfare of the United States. This statement is made in the fullest recognition of the place which Theodore Roosevelt holds in American history for his contribution to forestry and conservation.\n\nIt is for such reasons as these that I hope it will prove possible to obtain the President's endorsement of this legislation as a part of his emergency program.\n\nSince the provisions of the bill are in the form of authorizations, the appropriations required could follow at an appropriate time. Perhaps the only appropriation which would be necessary during the coming fiscal year would be for the acquisition of lands, because of the funds which are being made available under the Emergency Conservation Work Act.\n\nThis legislation is of such outstanding importance that I should like the opportunity to discuss it with you.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.

I beg to bring to your attention the enclosed memorandum on the application of the Industrial Recovery Act to the lumber industry. The principle proposed is to couple control of lumber production with control of forest devastation, in order to protect the public against the further needless destruction of our forests as living organisms.\n\nThe Industrial Recovery Act presents a providential means for a statesmanlike solution of this problem. But the initiative must, in my opinion, be seized by the Government rather than being left to the industry. In fact, the proposed \"code\" announced by the industry has nothing whatever to do with the conservation problem involved.\n\nI am drafting a proposed bill embodying the principles here set forth, which I should be glad to lay before you if you wish.\n\nBelieve me, with high respect, Very sincerely yours,\n\nWARD SHEPARD\n\n[13:OF IÂ—C:TS]\n\n151 [Enclosure]\n\n[May 29, 1933]\n\nEnding Forest Devastation Through Industrial Control\n\nThe Industrial Recovery Act gives a brilliant opportunity to end the regime of destructive logging that is rapidly devastating our remaining privately owned virgin forests, destroying them as productive organisms, and destroying the great industry itself whose permanence depends on making these forests permanently productive.\n\nThis opportunity, if energetically seized, will permit the greatest advance in forestry since Theodore Roosevelt's creation of the National Forest system, and will at the same time save the lumber industry from self-destruction.\n\nThere are two ways of controlling overproduction of lumber:\n\nFirst, by merely reducing the annual sawmill output of lumber.\n\nSecond, by reducing the annual cut in the forests to the amount of the annual timber growth possible under proper sustained forestry practice, and enforcing such practice as a part of control of production.\n\nThe first method would treat the remaining forests as a fixed \"wasting asset,\" comparable to oil. It would slightly reduce the annual drain on the total supply. It would not end devastation. In fact, it would merely make devastation more profitable by increasing lumber prices.\n\nThe second alternativeÂ—permanent sustained yield forestryÂ—will automatically control overproduction by limiting the annual cut to the annual growth, will entirely wipe out devastation, and is the only way to protect the public interest against the incalculable, ever-mounting losses of forest destruction.\n\nThe fundamental conservation problem involved in control of lumber production is to save the forests from clear-cutting,1 which destroys the forest itself as a productive organism. Compared with this vast objective, a mere curtailment of the drain on the stored supply of virgin timber is insignificant.\n\nThe control of lumber production, therefore, involves a fundamentally different principle from the control of oil production, and still more from the control of ordinary commodity production. But like the oil problem, the forest problem deserves separate, special treatment because of its complexity and special needs.\n\nThe vital question of strategy now confronting the Government is to couple control of lumber production with control of devastation. The decision now made on this question will determine whether the remaining virgin forests are wiped out of existence or become permanent national assets.\n\nThe lumber industry has demonstrated and admitted its incapacity to solve this problem. Only a highly intelligent, courageous act of the GovernmentÂ—striking at the very heart of the problemÂ—will save these forests for the American people.\n\nThe principles and procedure necessary to convert destructive lumbering into sustained yield forestry should be embodied in special legislation comparable to the oil bill. This bill should be framed before the lumber industry applies for licenses to operate under the Industrial Recovery Act and before its policy is frozen into a mere commodity curtailment price inflation program. The basic principle of sustained yield forestry should be announced in advance as the minimum requirement for control of lumber production. Because of the financial difficulties involved, first in the vast carrying charges on private timberlands, and, second, in converting to sustained-yield forestry, the Government must give substantial assistance (mostly indirect) to the industry, as outlined below. The solution, therefore, partakes of the nature of a bargain, a quid pro quo. This policy should be worked out in a preliminary way by conservation experts representing the public interest, and then finally developed in collaboration with the forest industries. This memorandum outlines the basic principles of such a bill.\n\nThe Basic Facts of Lumber Overproduction\n\n(1) The lumber industry owns vast timber holdings unwisely alienated by the Government under vicious land laws.\n\n(2) Interest and taxes on these holdings constitute an ever-increasing burden on the owners, forcing overproduction to liquidate stored capital and reduce charges.\n\n(3) A vast surplus sawmill capacity has been created to hasten liquidation in favorable markets.\n\nThe basic facts of forest devastation:\n\n(1) Devastation comes from clear-cutting, followed by fire, which together destroy the reproductive power of the forest.\n\n(2) Devastation can be entirely prevented by \"selective cutting,\" i. e., cutting the oldest and best trees, saving the young and middle-aged for a future cut and for reseeding the forest. (There are some exceptions to this technique.)\n\n(3) Selective logging will in general be more profitable than clear-cutting. Much of the small timber now logged is cut at a loss and reduces the profits on the best timber.\n\n(4) Through prejudice and inertia, the lumber industry has never given intelligent consideration to sustained-yield forestry, and will never do so voluntarily, with isolated exceptions.\n\n(5) Only an integral attack by the Government on the whole problem as a unit gives any hope of solution.\n\nWhy Prevent Devastation?\n\n(1) Because forest devastation is an abuse of the rights of private property, entailing fundamental, long-time social and industrial evils. It is tolerated in practically no European country; it should not be longer tolerated in America.\n\n(2) Because it will cost the people of the United States from two to three billion dollars to rehabilitate the forests already devastated.\n\n(3) Because it will cost from four to five billion dollars additional to rehabilitate the remaining virgin forests if they are allowed to be devastated.\n\n(4) Because devastation destroys not merely the forests and the vast capital invested in our wood-manufacturing and wood-using industries, but the livelihood of millions of people dependent on these industries.\n\n(5) Because devastation is destroying the artistic and human values of forests, creating desolation and ugliness, and is making the entire land progressively less fit for civilized human habitation.\n\nIs Public Regulation to Prevent Devastation Feasible?\n\nAmericans are unfamiliar with the highly successful regulation worked out by various European countries, cannot visualize its operation and are frightened by the magnitude of the job. Practically every European nation now forbids devastation. Austria, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, and some of the German states have been especially successful in this field. Forest owners at first resisted regulation. NOW they take it for granted. They place devastation in about the same class as arson. The costs of compulsory reforestation are offset by higher timber prices, higher grade timber, and lower operating costs. The author of this memorandum has, during the past year, made an intensive study of the administration of regulatory laws in Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia under the auspices of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation of Philadelphia, and will be glad to make the results available, if desired.\n\nIt is claimed that lumbermen will capture the regulatory machinery, but the same can be said of railroad, public utility, or other forms of regulation. If this claim were true, the Government should renounce every effort to regulate industry and could not possibly justify the Industrial Recovery Act. But the claim is untrue and a negation of government.\n\nThe Federal Government has constitutional power to prevent the devastation of forests needed to protect the flow of navigable streams. The states have legal authority to prevent the waste or destruction of natural resources, including forests, as confirmed by court decision and as carried out in laws, for example, to prevent the waste of oil and gas. Still more direct, the Government has the power to enforce forest management as a condition to the granting of licenses to operate under the Industrial Control bill.\n\nMain Elements of Solution\n\n(1) Organize the lumber-producing regions into districts or \"pools\" for the double purpose of controlling production and adopting sustained-yield management.\n\n(2) Bring the public forests (National and state) and the Indian Forests into these pools.\n\n(3) Create for each major forest region where control of production and sustained-yield forestry is undertaken (e. g. Pacific Northwest, Northern Rocky Mountains, etc.) an official, unsalaried Forestry Board with the double function of controlling production through allocation of cut and enforcing sustained yield management. These boards should have a permanent executive official and a staff of engineers and foresters.\n\n(4) Create, where desirable, subsidiary control boards for individual pools.\n\n(5) Require large forest owners (over 1000 acres) to associate into regional associations, and give them adequate but not majority representation on the Forestry Boards. This will give an element of self-government to regulation without surrendering public control.\n\n(6) Require owners of over 1000 acres of forest to submit forest management plans for sustained-yield production, to be approved by the Regional Forestry Board through its technical personnel.\n\n(7) Create an adequate inspection and enforcement personnel under the Regional Forestry Board to inspect methods of cutting that will insure forest reproduction, and to keep the annual timber cut within the figure allowed by sustained yield.\n\n(8) Promote mergers of smaller timber-holdings into larger units for adequate sustained yield management.\n\n(9) Establish a forest conservation tax on all forest land or on all timber cut, to meet the expenses of the Forestry Board and to improve forest fire protection and reforestation.\n\n(10) Inflict penalties on all owners within a given pool who cut timber in violation of the regulations adopted by the Forestry Boards governing allocation of production and sustained-yield management.\n\n(11) On timber tracts not susceptible of sustained-yield management (i. e., where merchantable timber will be exhausted before regrowth is large enough to cut) require proper cutting methods for reforestation under a contract with the Government to purchase the land at an impartially appraised valuation after the timber is cut. This will prevent devastation and assure public purchase at a reasonable price.\n\n(12) As an alternative to (11), provide for Governmental purchase of heavily timbered (and therefore expensive) forest lands through Forest Purchase Bonds, to be redeemed through a sinking fund created from receipts from timber as cut.\n\n(13) To aid in converting private forests to sustained-yield, provide additional public aid for protection against fire of all forests brought under management standards set up by the Forestry Boards. Provide increased aid for roads to promote sustained-yield production.\n\n(14) Sustained-yield forestry demands abolition of the straight property tax and the substitution of a yield tax, paid on timber as cut. The Forest Service has just completed a fundamental nation-wide study of the forest tax problem, and has submitted detailed recommendations. The reforms proposed must be made by the States, but the Industrial Recovery Act as applied to the lumber industry should be made the vehicle of inducing rapid State action through State compacts.\n\n(15) Provide for a thorough investigation of the large bonded indebtedness of the large timber holdings to discover if cheaper credit can be made available to offset costs of sustained-yield production and of amortization of surplus sawmill capacity. The problem is analogous to the refinancing of farm mortgages. Cheaper credit might be provided through creation of a Federal Forest Bank similar to the Federal Farm Bank. Such credit forms a means of enforcing sustained-yield forestry to guarantee amortization of loans, as demonstrated by European experience. Moreover, such a bank would divert capital from unneeded industrial expansion into forest rehabilitation. Sustained-yield forestry is the safest of all long-term investments.\n\n(16) Direct Federal regulation to prevent forest devastation can constitutionally be applied to all forests necessary to protect the flow of navigable streams.\n\nFor non-protection forests, regulatory powers should be sought through (a) Federal promotion of regional state compacts; or (b) the cession of the regulatory power by the states to the Federal Government, or (c), failing (b), direct exercise through the emergency powers conferred by the Industrial Recovery Act.\n\nWe must start from the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the Migratory Bird Treaty case: \"It is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, a power which belongs to and must somewhere reside in every civilized state, is not to be found.\"\n\nPrevention of Devastation in the Tennessee River Project\n\nThe principles outlined above apply chiefly to the remaining virgin forests of the West, the South, and the Lake States.\n\nThe second-growth forests of the East (largely in small holdings) present a different problem.\n\nAn immediate approach toward public regulation to prevent devastation of these forests is presented by the Tennessee Valley Project. The large public investment already made there and to be made in power production, stream regulation, etc., demands protection against the evils of deforestation. The Federal Government, as already pointed out, has constitutional power to regulate the exploitation of private forests needed to protect the flow of the Tennessee River and its tributaries, as well as all other navigable streams. The Government should proceed to delimit these forests into Protection Forest Zones, wherein destructive lumbering would be prevented. The Tennessee Project would be a proving ground for working out the principles of protection forests, and the results should be rapidly applied to all main forested river basins in the United States.\n\nThere is much academic debate in the United States over the exact extent to which forests influence stream-flow and erosion. Long European experience accepts an obvious fact and lays vital emphasis on preserving protection forests through special laws and elaborate administration. This practice is confirmed by much research, both in Europe and in America. The Gordian knot of fruitless controversy should be cut by action in the Tennessee Valley by recognizing that forests are important in themselves, and that the common sense of mankind has long recognized their importance in preventing erosion and silting and in regulating stream-flow.\n\nRespectfully submitted by: WARD SHEPARD, Fellow of the Carl Schurz Memorial Foundation of Philadelphia, 29 May, 1933.2\n\n[13:OF IÂ—C:T]\n\n1Words in italic, here and below, are underscored in the original.\n\n2Shepard, formerly assistant chief of research in the Forest Service, was at this time forestry investigator for the Carl Schurz Foundation.

Franklin Reed, its executive secretary, said that the plan would make effective the most important part of the society's \"Principles of Forest Policy for the United States,\" and that the full support of the trained foresters of the country could be relied upon to carry it out (Reed to Roosevelt, June 10, 1933, OF IÂ—C).

WALLACE, SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE, TO ROOSEVELT\n\nWASHINGTON, June 15, 1933\n\nDEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Mr. Ward Shepard's memorandum of May 29 has been received and considered with the Chief of the Forest Service in accordance with your suggestion.\n\nThe proposal in brief is that the public require sustained yield management and the stopping of forest devastation as a quid pro quo for the privilege of curtailing output, merging holdings, etc., and that advantage be taken of the National Industrial Recovery Bill to accomplish this purpose. Somewhat similar recommendations were made in the Departmental report on Senate Resolution 1751 and have recently been renewed by the Chief Forester.\n\nFor reasons outlined in the accompanying statement, I would like to suggest two things for your immediate consideration, with the recommendation for the approval of both:\n\n1. Approval of the principle of regulation of privately-owned forest lands in connection with the administration of the Industrial Bill and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, along lines also outlined in the accompanying statement.\n\n2. The delegation to the Secretary of Agriculture of the necessary authority to administer for the lumber and other forest industries the provisions of the Industrial Bill relating to or closely allied to the treatment of forest lands. This would necessarily involve proper correlation with the administration of other provisions of the bill and also with the pertinent provisions of the Agricultural Act.\n\nGeneral Forest Policy and Legislation\n\nYour suggestion that we should have a forest policy for private forest lands is most opportune, because in my judgment action on the regulation proposal should constitute a coordinated part of a well-rounded program.\n\nThe Department has I feel, however, anticipated this suggestion in a recent report on Senate Resolution 175 which is the most comprehensive and exhaustive survey yet made of our forest problem. The resulting National Plan outlined and covering both private and public lands serves as the basis for the attached statement. A copy of the Summary of this report is also attached,2 and a copy of the somewhat voluminous complete report was furnished to you on May 5.\n\nIn my judgment no additional legislation on the regulatory phase of the problem suggested by Mr. Shepard is required at the present time. It will be better first to try out administration under the Industrial Relief Bill and the Agricultural Act and be guided accordingly.\n\nFor the remainder of the Federal contribution to the National Plan recommended in the Senate Resolution report, including the acquisition of forest lands, putting them into production, increasing in a reasonable degree the scale of public aid and that of forest research, I should like to see general legislation as soon as you feel disposed to take it up. The splendid start already made on Federal forestry during your Administration should in my judgment be crystallized into a long-term program in legislative form. This will help to insure orderly and coordinated progress and to prevent serious setbacks at any future time. The possibilities of economic and social service in our national life are beyond comprehension. The Department is ready to submit suggestions for such legislation whenever you desire.\n\nVery respectfully submitted,\n\nH. A. WALLACE\n\n[13:OF IÂ—C:TS]\n\n1A National Plan for American Forestry (Washington, 1933).\n\n2The summary, a 150-page typescript, entitled \"A National Plan for American Forestry,\" is present.\n\n153 [Enclosure]\n\nStatement to Accompany Memorandum to the President on Regulation of Private Forest Lands\n\nMr. Ward Shepard's memorandum of May 29 has been received and considered with the Chief of the Forest Service, in accordance with your suggestion. It has also been discussed with Mr. Shepard.\n\nThe memorandum proposes that forest devastation be stopped by public control based on the pending National Industrial Recovery Act and/or a special bill dealing with the lumber industry.\n\nIt proposes that control be not limited to the restriction of lumber production but that it provide also for selective cutting of forest lands to stop forest devastation and insure sustained yield management.\n\nIt proposes this as a quid pro quo to the public for the privilege of curtailing output, merging holdings, and some forms of public aid such as loans, etc.\n\nBoth the Department and the Forest Service welcome the opportunity to consider this proposal:\n\nFirst, because of its intrinsic merit and timeliness, and\n\nSecond, because it affords the opportunity to bring to your attention a report entitled \"A National Plan for American Forestry,\" prepared by the Forest Service and submitted to the Senate by the Department in response to Senate Resolution 175.\n\nThe Department believes that the regulation of forest lands should be considered in relation to the entire national forestry problem and not as a detached move. This is attempted in the report mentioned, which outlines a national policy for both private and public forest lands.\n\nThe Main Findings in the Senate Report\n\nThe report on Senate Resolution 175, which was transmitted on March 27, is without question the most comprehensive and exhaustive survey of the forestry situation in the United States yet made.\n\nThe main findings are:\n\n1. That practically all of the major problems of American forestry center in, or have grown out of, private ownership. This finding must accordingly dominate remedial proposals.\n\n2. That one of the major problems of public ownership is that of unmanaged public lands. Both the Federal Government and the States have large unredeemed responsibilities in this respect.\n\n3. That there has been a serious lack of balance in constructive efforts to solve the forest problem as between private and public ownership and between the relatively poor and the relatively good land. This lack of balance is merely another indication of the failure of private forest ownership.\n\n4. That the forest problem ranks as one of our major national problems.\n\nShould you care to go into the basis for these findings you might find it worth while to glance over pages v to viii of the Letter of Transmittal in the attached Separate.\n\nPages 11 to 39 of the Summary of the entire report, which are also included in the attached Separate, outline our major forest problems as disclosed by the inquiry still more fully and explicitly: Those of privately-owned forest lands; of the agricultural land available for forestry; of unmanaged public lands; of balancing the national timber budget; of watershed protection; of forest recreation; of forest wild life; and of knowledge.\n\nWhy the solution of our major forest problems constitutes one "
