The Presidential Election of 1936 in the United States saw incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, win a landslide victory over Republican candidate Alf Landon. This election is notable for being one of the most lopsided in American history, with Roosevelt securing a second term in the midst of the Great Depression. His New Deal policies and popularity among working-class voters were key factors in his re-election.
