Timişoara, Romania

Our facility in Timişoara enabled us to expand our options for manufacturing plastic composite modules and thus be able to offer our customers in Europe such components in medium and small batches as well. In 2017, Swoboda Timişoara S.R.L. relocated to a new factory near Timișoara Traian Vuia International Airport, where high-precision metal-plastic components are now produced in state-of-the-art semi-automated manufacturing systems spread out over an area of around 9,000 m².

Timişoara is situated in western Romania, and its 300,000 inhabitants make it the country’s second-largest city after Bucharest. Timişoara is the capital of Timiş County and also the economic and cultural center of the Banat historical region, which today is divided among Hungary, Serbia and Romania. The city is home to numerous baroque and art nouveau buildings and houses. Located on the Bega Canal, Timişoara is a modern and multicultural city – and also the only city whose theaters (of which are three) perform plays in Romanian, German, and Hungarian. Timişoara also has a lot to offer as a university town, and its fascinating architecture has led to it being referred to as “the little Vienna” to this very day.
