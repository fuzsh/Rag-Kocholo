Conquered in 1716 by the Austrians from the Ottoman Turks, Timișoara developed in the following centuries behind the fortifications and in the urban nuclei located around them.

Former bastions and military spaces were demolished and replaced with new boulevards and neighbourhoods.[15] Timișoara was the first city in the Habsburg monarchy with street lighting (1760) and the first European city to be lit by electric street lamps in 1884.[16] It opened the first public lending library in the Habsburg monarchy and built a municipal hospital 24 years ahead of Vienna.[16] Also, it published the first German newspaper in Southeast Europe (Temeswarer Nachrichten).[16] In December 1989, Timișoara was the starting point of the Romanian Revolution.[17]
