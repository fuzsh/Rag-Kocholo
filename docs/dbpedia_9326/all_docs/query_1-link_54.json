        "text": "Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, is one of the overlooked destinations in Europe. To correct that, here are some reasons to visit Belgrade and choose it for your next city break.\n\nGuest post by Danielle Koch from The Amazing Traveler.\n\nBelgrade is one of Europe’s oldest cities, with evidence of human settlement dating back to the prehistoric Vinča culture, around 7,000 years ago. The city’s strategic location at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers made it an important military and trading post throughout history.\n\nThe Celts first established a settlement here in the 4th century BC, naming it Singidūn. Later, it became a Roman city known as Singidunum. Over the centuries, Belgrade saw many rulers and empires, including the Byzantine Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary.\n\nIn the medieval era, the city became a significant Serbian stronghold until it fell to the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. This period introduced many architectural and cultural changes, still evident in the city’s landscape. After centuries of Ottoman rule, Belgrade became the capital of Serbia in the 19th century, after the Serbian Revolution.\n\nThe 20th century was tumultuous for Belgrade, with both World Wars leaving their marks. Despite this, the city rebuilt and evolved, retaining its historical significance and cultural diversity. Today, Belgrade is Serbia’s capital and a hub of culture, history, and modern urban life, and here are the reasons why it is worth visiting.\n\nUnique Mix of Eastern and Western Cultures\n\nUnlike other European capitals, Belgrade’s unique position at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers has made it a crossroads of Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nIn Belgrade, you’ll see this mix everywhere. The architecture shows both the Ottoman influence and European styles side by side. Walking around, you’ll find old buildings and churches next to more modern ones, all telling the story of the city’s past.\n\nWhat is special about Belgrade is how the city kept its history alive while still moving forward. The Kalemegdan Fortress is a perfect example. This old fortress has seen a lot of history, and now it’s a place where people go to relax and enjoy the views of the rivers.\n\nCultural Events\n\nBelgrade in winter becomes a gathering place for young people from all over former Yugoslavia. The city hosts a variety of cultural events during this season.\n\nIn October, the Book Fair attracts readers and writers, creating a space for literary exchange. The Festival of Healthy Living and Healthy Food in November offers insights into wellness and nutrition.\n\nUlica Otvorenog Srca in January is a big, festive event that happens every New Year’s Day. It started long ago with actors serving guests in a tavern, and now it’s a big deal in the city. The celebration includes music, theater, and fun activities for everyone.\n\nIt’s held in several places across Belgrade, attracting thousands of people. There are performances by choirs, orchestras, and artists.\n\nReasons to Visit Belgrade: Nightlife\n\nJust like Berlin in 2000, Belgrade today is a major center for nightlife. Floating nightclubs on the Sava and Danube rivers are legendary among party-goers.\n\nIn Skadarlija, you can experience the traditional Serbian atmosphere with folk music in kafanas.\n\nFor techno and trance enthusiasts, Beton Hala is the place to be, hosting numerous clubs pulsating with these genres.\n\nIf live pop and rock are more your style, head over to Ada Ciganlija, where you’ll find a lively scene perfect for your music preferences.\n\nInteresting Architecture\n\nBelgrade’s architectural scene is diverse with landmarks spanning many centuries.\n\nThe Belgrade Fortress is a symbol of the city’s past. This fortress has seen many battles and changes over the centuries, and its architecture reflects that. It’s like walking through a history book!\n\nThen there’s the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world. Its grandeur and beauty are awe-inspiring.\n\nBelgrade also has its share of unique, modern buildings. The Western City Gate, known locally as Genex Tower, is one such example.\n\nDelicious Serbian Cuisine\n\nSerbian cuisine often ranks just behind the French or Italian on top food lists worldwide. It’s a blend of Mediterranean zest, with hints of Hungarian, Turkish, and Austrian influences.\n\nĆevapi, for instance, is a must-try. These small, grilled minced meat sausages, crafted from pork, beef, or lamb, are a street food favorite. They are typically served with flatbread, fresh onions, and a savory sauce, creating a simple yet unforgettable taste.\n\nAnother notable dish is Sarma, where minced meat and rice are rolled in cabbage or vine leaves and then slow-cooked, creating a comforting and flavorful meal.\n\nAffordability\n\nBelgrade is one of Europe’s most budget-friendly destinations. The cost of living and traveling in the city is relatively low compared to other European capitals. This affordability applies to various aspects, from accommodation to dining and even entertainment.\n\nAccommodation options in Belgrade cater to all budgets, with a range of hostels, budget hotels, and affordable rental apartments. Even in the city center, the prices are generally lower than in many Western European cities.\n\nWhen it comes to dining, Belgrade offers a plethora of options that won’t cost you an arm and a leg. Traditional Serbian eateries, local bakeries, and street food stalls have delicious meals at very reasonable prices.\n\nThe city is also known for its café culture, where you can enjoy a coffee or a snack without spending a lot.\n\nPublic transportation in Belgrade is efficient and cost-effective. Tickets for buses, trams, and trolleys are inexpensive, making it easy to explore the city on a budget.\n\nMoreover, many of Belgrade’s attractions, like the historic Kalemegdan Fortress, Gardoš, Ada Ciganlija, and Knez Mihailova Street, are free to visit.\n\nDay Trips From Belgrade\n\nWith its strategic location in Southeast Europe, Belgrade is an excellent starting point for exploring the region. It sits close to several other countries, so you can go on day trips from Belgrade to cities like Timisoara, Budapest, and Zagreb.\n\nTimisoara in Romania, a 3-hour drive from Belgrade, is known for its beautiful architecture and historical significance as the first European city with electric streetlights.\n\nBudapest, Hungary, reachable in about 4 hours by train or car, has stunning architecture, a rich history, and famous thermal baths.\n\nZagreb, the capital of Croatia, about 4 hours from Belgrade, is a city rich in museums, green spaces, and historic sites.\n\nThere are also appealing destinations within Serbia, like Novi Sad, known for its Petrovaradin Fortress, and the EXIT music festival, just an hour’s drive away.\n\nNovi Sad contrasts Belgrade’s energy with a more relaxed atmosphere.\n\nAnother nearby place is Topola, an hour away, famous for its wineries and the historical Oplenac complex.\n\nRiverside Charm\n\nWith its city center situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Danube and the Sava, Belgrade is unique in Europe and probably in the world.\n\nThe Belgrade Waterfront area along the Sava River is a new part of the city, combining living spaces, shops, and places to hang out. It’s filled with walkways, parks, and modern buildings, so it’s a great place for a walk, a meal, or just to see the river views.\n\nWar Island, at the joining of the Danube and Sava, is a green spot right in the middle of the city. It’s protected for its nature and birds, and what’s interesting about the island is that it is growing. It’s getting bigger and bigger every year.\n\nTaking a cruise on the Danube and Sava is a cool way to see Belgrade from a different angle. You can see both old and new parts of the city from the water, giving you a feel for why this spot by the rivers is so special.\n\nAda Ciganlija\n\nAlthough Belgrade isn’t on the coast, Ada Ciganlija, a river island turned peninsula in the Sava River, brings the beach experience right to the city’s heart. It’s one of the largest urban beaches in Europe, if not the largest.\n\nDuring the summer, Ada Ciganlija draws an incredible number of visitors – about 100,000 people daily, and the numbers can soar to over 300,000 on weekends.\n\nThe beach at Ada Ciganlija has everything you might want for a day by the water. There are beach bars where you can grab a drink, relax, and enjoy the sun.\n\nFor those looking for more active pursuits, the area is well-known for its wide range of water sports. You can try everything from swimming and rowing to more adrenaline-packed activities like water skiing.\n\nIn this area, there are also trails for walking and cycling, picnic spots, and even facilities for other sports like golf and tennis. There are also small trains that can take you around the area.\n\nWarm Hospitality\n\nAccording to a project by Harvard University called Project Implicit, Serbia is the least racist country in Europe.\n\nIn Serbia, guests are often greeted with open arms and treated like family. This hospitality is visible in everyday interactions, social gatherings, and especially in traditional settings.\n\nVisitors to Serbia frequently speak of the warmth and friendliness of the locals, who are keen to share their culture, cuisine, and stories.\n\nThis welcoming atmosphere extends beyond personal interactions. Serbia’s diverse history and cultural influences have fostered a society that’s generally tolerant and accepting of different cultures and backgrounds."
