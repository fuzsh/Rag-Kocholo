        "text": "Timișoara is the 2023 Capital of Culture, and if you travel to Romania without visiting the city in the very west of the country, you’re definitely miss an important part of the country’s culture and beauty. We show you what makes Timișoara so unique and which sights you should have seen. Outdoor fans will also get their money’s worth here.\n\nWith just over 300,000 inhabitants, Timișoara is Romania’s third largest city after Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca. With a history of nearly 1000 years, Timișoara offers the perfect mix of historical sights and modern culture. Theater performances, concerts, art exhibitions and other events take place here throughout the year. Nightlife is not neglected either, as far as the situation allows.\n\nCosmopolitanism and modernity meet a history that has grown over centuries. For example, Timișoara was the first European city and the second in the world after New York to introduce electric street lighting in 1884. Timișoara was also home to the country’s first tobacco factory and Romania’s first tramway.\n\nFrom a political point of view, the city is no less amazing – in 1989, the revolution of Romanians against the communist regime under the dictator Ceausescu began here, which eventually led to the liberation of the whole of Romania.\n\nThe Cultural Capital of Timișoara – Romania’s little Vienna\n\nIn many travel guides, Timișoara is also referred to as the little Vienna of Romania. This is not surprising, since the city belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire for a long time. A whole 15,000 historic buildings in their typical pastel colors adorn the city center. Only a few of the old buildings have already been renovated. As regrettable as this may be from the perspective of historic preservation, perhaps this is precisely why the city exudes a special charm.\n\nThe Squares of the City – Where Life Pulsates\n\nLife in Timișoara takes place primarily on the large squares and in the parks. Whether in the numerous restaurants, bars and cafes or while sitting comfortably on a park bench: here you can enjoy the flair of the city. Or you can experience how young and old meet to exchange ideas in common conversations or enjoy a delicious meal together. A few of these places deserve special mention.\n\nThe Piața Libertății (Liberty Square) is probably the most historic of the eleven squares in the city. The square and the entire city of Timișoara became world famous in 1989, when the Romanian revolution against dictator Nicolae Ceausescu began right here. Since then, the name of the city is considered a symbol of freedom. Of particular interest to tourists today are the old town hall with Baroque and Renaissance style elements and the statues.\n\nPiata Unirii (Unification Square) is the oldest square in Timișoara and the fortress core of the historic old town. The square, called Cathedral Square by locals, is surrounded by several churches and palaces from the 18th and 19th centuries. Especially in summer and on weekends, you’ll hardly find a seat in the spacious outdoor areas of the various restaurants and cafés. From here, you can perfectly take in the hustle and bustle of Piata Unirii.\n\nPiața Victoriei (Victory Square) is the city’s showcase square. Since the demolition of the fortress at the beginning of the 20th century, it has been vigorously renovated. The wide boulevard – lined with elegant Art Nouveau palaces – connects the Palace of Culture with the Romanian Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Three Hierarchs. Some of the city’s most important events and festivals take place on the Piața Victoriei.\n\nPicturesque Bridges Over the Bega\n\nThe Bega River characterizes the cityscape of Timișoara. It separates the old town core from the factory and workers’ quarter of the city. Numerous historical and picturesque bridges span the embedded course of the river.\n\nThe family park is particularly interesting for families: It is located directly on the banks of the Bega River and offers numerous recreational opportunities. But also young people and seniors enjoy the hot summer here in a shady place under one of the many trees.\n\nThe “Timisoreana” beer factory: The Pride of the Timișoarans\n\nLocals are particularly proud of their beer. The Timisoreana brewery was the first of its kind in all of Romania. Beer has been brewed here continuously since 1718. The brewery was even the first in the city to go public on the national stock exchange at the end of the 19th century.\n\nEven during communist rule, when the company was nationalized from 1948 to 1995, production continued successfully. Today, the “Fabrica de bere” is once again in private hands and more successful than ever. Visitors can taste the local beer in the pub right next door and also purchase the factory’s products right away.\n\nCheile Nerei-Beușnița National Park – Less than Two Hours from Timișoara\n\nPerfect for a hiking trip is the Cheile Nerei-Beușnița National Park. In this protected part of the Carpathians you can discover breathtakingly beautiful nature and turquoise-blue lakes and picturesque waterfalls are waiting for you.\n\nThe national park can be reached in less than two hours by car in a southeasterly direction, but there are also guided hiking tours with a pick-up service directly from Timișoara. Socolari and Potoc are perfect starting points for your hike. Not all hiking routes are marked on the official map of the national park. However, the signposting and marking of the trails is surprisingly good, so you will easily find your way.\n\nIf you’re looking for a short hike, check out Sasca Montană. Here there is an idyllic hiking trail along the river, which after a short rocky section leads to the Susara waterfall – a truly impressive route.\n\nFazit: Eine vielleicht unterschätzte Kulturhauptstadt\n\nTimișoara offers travelers many different facets. You won’t find mass tourism here – no matter what time of year it is. This makes the stay authentic and pleasant. Accommodation and public transport, as well as the cost of daily living are relatively inexpensive.\n\nA trip to Timișoara should definitely be on your bucket list."
