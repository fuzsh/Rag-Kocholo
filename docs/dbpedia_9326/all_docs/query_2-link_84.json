        "text": "About\n\nHome\n\nContact\n\nEnvironment\n\nSUSTAIN EUROPE\n\nTRAVEL\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nNovi Sad: European Capital of Culture 2022\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nIn northern Serbia, on the banks of the Danube River, sits Novi Sad. This colourful, welcoming city was ranked seventh in the European Best Destination 2016 list, as voted for by hundreds of thousands of travellers. It's easy to see why: rich with history and greenery, this charming city has something for everybody. From mountaineering to monasteries, and museums to music festivals, there's no shortage of things to see and do, no matter what time of year you visit.\n\nNovi Sad has been nicknamed the 'Serbian Athens' thanks to its rich cultural heritage, and it became the first Serbian city to be named a European Capital of Cultureâa title it had to wait a year to take on due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The title of European Capital of Culture 2022 recognises the excellence of the city's ever-expanding offering in arts, gastronomy and culture, and its sustainable tourism. It's also become popular for providing high-quality, low-cost medical care, and attracts a growing number of health tourists.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nNovi Sad: The European Capital of Culture (4 New Bridges)\n\nNovi Sad was awarded the European Capital of Culture in 2022 title, alongside the Luxembourg town of Esch-sur-Alzette and Lithuania's second-largest city, Kaunas. The European Capital of Culture title was established to emphasise the richness and diversity of European cultures, and the connections between Europe's citizens.\n\nThe proclamation ceremony was held at the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. During the ceremony, the Ambassador of the European Union to Serbia, Emanuele Giaufre, said: \"Novi Sad has always been a beacon of freedom, openness, ethnic, cultural and religious tolerance â values that are so necessary today, which all of us Europeans should nurture and maintain. With their extremely rich cultural diversity, museums and galleries, universities and institutes, large national theatre, their festivals, such as EXIT, they make the city and the whole country a cultural stronghold in Europe, encourage positive change, and nurture democratic values in society.\"\n\nNovi Sad's 'For New Bridges' slogan forms the foundation for its programmes throughout this year and beyond, representing the idea of \"building new bridges of cooperation and exchange between artists and organisations from Novi Sad and Serbia with the European cultural scene.\"\n\nThe four bridges of Rainbow, Freedom, Love, and Hope represent the values and beliefs that the city fosters and strives to share. It's a nod to the beautiful bridges that connect Novi Sad's neighbourhoods, just as the 'For New Bridges' slogan connects Novi Sad to Europe. The programme within the title year has been divided into four programme clusters (' bridges') and eight programme units (' arches'), which were presented chronologically throughout the title year. Every programme unit focuses on a certain set of European values Novi Sad wants to put in the spotlight: DoÄek, Migrations, Future of Europe, Heroines, Fortress of Peace, The Danube Sea, Kaleidoscope of Culture, and Other? Europe.\n\nFor instance, DoÄek (New Year) is already a time that demonstrates the interculturality of Novi Sad, with two different New Years: one celebrated according to the 'new' Gregorian calendar, on 31st December, and the other set to the 'old' Julian calendar, on 13th January. The DoÄek events therefore looked at dualism, tradition and contemporaneity, time and energy. There were amazing multimedia exhibitions inspired by scientists Nikola Tesla and Milutin MilankoviÄ, using contemporary light and digital forms of expression.\n\nThroughout 2022, more than 1,500 cultural events have taken place across the city. Novi Sad has also laid the groundwork for the city's cultural legacy to thrive into 2023 and beyond, including the development of cultural stations and the Creative District in Great Liman.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nCultural Stations\n\nNovi Sad's eight cultural stations are authentic, accessible spaces allowing everyone to engage in artistic and cultural content across the city, including children. They offer activities focused on the arts, education, and humanitarianism. The idea is to hasten the process of decentralisation of the cultural sector from official institutions and into the field of local self-organised civic activism. The City's Tourism Development Programme (2018-2022) prioritised the adaption of all cultural spaces for people with disabilities, not only removing physical barriers but also improving access for all visitors, regardless of their sensory or mobility limitations and needs.\n\nSvilara: The Cultural Content Factory\n\nOne of the city's oldest neighbourhoods, AlmaÅ¡, is home to the Svilara cultural station: the Cultural Content Factory. Once a silk-dyeing factory, the factory and the distinctive chimney now help to preserve Svilara's history of spawning economic and social development in AlmaÅ¡.\n\nSvilara's programme is varied, with exhibitions often rooted in history and tradition. In June, it hosted the acclaimed 'Ester â a Graphic Novel in Holocaust Education' as part of the project 'From Raid to Auschwitz: Novi Sad â the City of Remembrance'. This unique exhibition featured a collection of educational graphic novels about the lives of real, predominantly young people before, during, and after the Holocaust, together with a wealth of archival source material that inspired the novels. November saw the start of the 'The Other Side of the Image' exhibition, looking at concepts and creative processes behind the work of significant representatives of the progressive Romani culture. Projects like these are helping to increase the city's reputation as a cultural hotspot.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nNovi Sad's Liman Creative District and its Cultural Station\n\nNovi Sad's Creative District is close to the University of Novi Sad campus, on the bank of the Danube. Here, a derelict, long-disused collection of former tool-making factories covering 11,000 square metres, formerly known as the Chinese Quarter, has been transformed. Now, it's a thriving Creative District that fosters contemporary culture and creativity, while preserving its architectural and industrial heritage. Progressive ideas that arose from the area in the first decades of the last century have contributed to the sense of contemporary progressive thinking that now pervades throughout.\n\nThe District hosts diverse events such as Female Thread, an international tapestry exhibition, and Drawings Travel through Time, an exhibition of children's drawings from the Centre for Art Education of Children and Youth of Vojvodina. It's also home to many artists' studios and a variety of cultural organisations, including:\n\nthe French Institute in Serbia, housed within the old factory 'Petar DrapÅ¡in'\n\nFabrika, the Student Cultural Centre of Novi Sad. Focusing mainly on musical, artistic and cultural programmes, it was refreshed as part of the transformation and provides a flexible event space and capacity for a large number of visitors.\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, Liman Creative District was the ideal location for one of Novi Sad's new cultural stations. The Liman Cultural Station (The Centre of Youth Creativity) includes a 'one-stop' youth centre managed by and for youth organisations and young people. It's a multi-functional, well-equipped space where everyone is welcomed, and an essential space for youth workers and activists.\n\nCaravan: Culture on Wheels\n\nYes, you read that right: this cultural station is in a caravan. The caravan has become a mobile cultural station that aims to decentralise cultural events, bringing them to areas away from the city centre and instead into surrounding areas such\n\nas Sremski Karlovci.\n\nEquipped with a proper sound and lighting system, the caravan stages small plays, concerts, film screenings, workshops and discussions. It's also engineered to use solar panels as an alternative source of energy, making it more sustainable too.\n\nOther cultural stations are:\n\nEgysÃ©g: Place for Cultural Stories. Based in a former sports association hall, it's now being used for dancing, literature, workshops and education.\n\nBukovac: Cultural Oasis Within City Reach. Created in a former cultural centre, this station offers all kinds of events, and the use of large green spaces and sports courts, to citizens interested in ecology, sport and culture.\n\nMlin: Where Culture Grows. Founded in a former pasta factory, this station focuses on the programmes for children.\n\nRumenka: Tradition and Modern Creation. Sited in the heritage-rich and historic Vojvodina suburb, this station's programme responds to the exceptionally ethnically diverse local population. Focusing on cultural heritage, art and creativity.\n\nBarka: Culture on the Outskirts of the City. This cultural station is set to become the new centre of events for the city.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nSustainable Novi Sad\n\nNovi Sad is more than just a cultural capital: it's also a city striving to make not just its cultural events but its day-to-day life more sustainable.\n\nGreener Ways to Get Around the City\n\nNovi Sad is known for its cycle paths alongside the beautiful Danube, and it's also a bike-friendly city. It invests heavily in promoting cycling as a sustainable transport mode, including subsidising the purchase of bicycles, adding 30 km of new bike paths between 2012 and 2021, and reconstructing ten more. The city recognises that the increased uptake of cycling as a transport mode not only helps to improve health but also contributes to reduced pollution as people switch cars for bikes.\n\nThe City is also making its public transport more sustainable. It's purchased 10 Solaris 120-metre Urbino electric buses, along with five plug-in and three pantograph charging stations. With safety as a top priority, the air-conditioned buses have a video monitoring system, low floors, and a state-of-the-art MirrorEye system. This replaces side-view mirrors with cameras to improve visibility for the driver. Public transport is also set to get smarter with the introduction of electric wallets for passengers, digital timetable panels, and integrated monitoring for traffic lights.\n\nNovi Sad as a Smart City\n\nIn 2015, Novi Sad expressed a desire to found a Smart City programme, as other EU cities have done, using technology and digitalisation to make their cities more sustainable, inclusive, efficient and pleasant places to live. Novi Sad is one of the first two EBRD Green Cities to have smart assessments built into its Green City Action Plan (GCAP) from the start. Novi Sad is utilising digitisation to improve communication with citizens with various applications and platforms. One example is a mobile phone application developed by communications giant Ericsson within the Smart Santander project. This enables citizens to easily report utility problems and submit feedback on utility services.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nA Sustainable Stay\n\nTo enjoy a more eco-friendly and socially responsible stay in Novi Sad, our recommendations are:\n\nTravel There by Eco-Friendly Transport\n\nThe most picturesque way to travel to the city is via the Danube Cycle Path. Stretching from the Black Forest in Germany to the Black Sea in Romania, it's one of Europe's most famous cycling routes and passes through the heart of beautiful Novi Sad. If cycling isn't an option, choose the bus or train for a sustainable trip. Regular bus lines link Serbia's cities with all neighbouring Balkan countries and most Central and Western European countries, and Novi Sad is a stop on the international Vienna-Budapest-Belgrade-Istanbul route. This year, a high-speed double-decker intercity train called 'Soko' began running between Belgrade and Novi Sad, offering an even quicker and more comfortable journey.\n\nChoose Greener Accommodation\n\nMore sustainable accommodation choices include:\n\nCentar Hotel, in the city centre, scores 8.6/10 on ETIC's Ethical Hotel Standards, earning it the ETIC Gold Certification. It offers 51 very spacious rooms, breakfast, and a bar and lounge. Community involvement and fair, sustainable employment practices are key here.\n\nThe Hotel Leopold I has an ETIC Silver Certification. It's a grand baroque building in the heart of Petrovaradin Fortress. There are 59 luxurious rooms, all offering wonderful views of the Danube and the city. Its restaurant serves international dishes with a local touch, and other restaurants and bars are on the doorstep. Guests have free access to a Wellness and Fitness Centre that includes a jacuzzi area, a Finnish sauna, and a relaxation area with heated loungers.\n\nHotel Prezident has earned the ETIC Silver Certification. Close to the city centre, on the trade fair grounds, it has 46 rooms. Facilities include a fitness centre, rooftop terrace, bar/lounge, spa, a restaurant serving seasonal menus, and indoor and outdoor pools.\n\nApartment Zeravica is 200 m from the city centre and can sleep up to five people in two rooms. Breakfast with organic or local ingredients is provided, and the apartment is fitted with energy-saving lights, water flow reducers, and a rainwater recovery and reuse system.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nExplore the City's History and Culture\n\nNovi Sad's Tourism Development Programme (2018-2022) prioritised road safety and walkability. Through a combination of car-free zones, authentic architecture, events, green spaces, and an array of shopping and dining options, the city offers countless spaces for residents and tourists to wander through and enjoy.\n\nThere are plenty of guided tours available. However, if you're setting off by yourself, a great place to begin sightseeing is the largest central city square, \"Trg slobode\" (Freedom Square). This 18th century square hosts many of the city's major cultural events, and it's home to some of the city's architectural masterpieces.\n\nNovi Sad City Hall is an 1895 neo-renaissance building and a must-see for architecture buffs and Instagrammers alike. The facade features allegoric statues by a Novi Sad. Today, the building is home to the seat of the Mayor and Government Offices. Also in the square is the Name of Mary Church. This tall, neogothic building, also built in 1895, is the largest Roman Catholic church in Novi Sad, and known to locals as 'the Cathedral'. The church boasts beautiful stained-glass windows and a yellow brick facade. The 72-metre high tower, which can be spotted from a distance, will guide your way around the city centre. Hidden away down the side of the church, you'll find a square that hosts cultural events, with a sprinkling of cafÃ©s in which to take a break. While here, you won't be able to miss the prominent Svetozar MiletiÄ Monument. Svetozar Miletic was a significant Serbian politician in the 19th century, famous for fighting against Hungarian oppression. A lawyer, journalist and author, he was also mayor of Novi Sad from 1861 to 1862 and from 1867 to 1868.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nFrom Freedom Square, stroll along Zmaj Jovina Street, one of Novi Sad's oldest streets, to the Bishop's Palace. The Orthodox Bishop's Palace was first built in 1741 by Bishop Visarion Pavlovic, but was rebuilt after it was destroyed by bombing during the 1849 riots. This remarkable, peach-coloured palace features an eclectic mix of styles: romantic, secessionist, neo-gothic and byzantine, to name a few!\n\nOther architectural masterpieces across Novi Sad include the Roman Catholic Parish Office (Plebanija), built in 1808, with both baroque and classic elements. The ground floor houses church archives, as well as a ceremonial hall. The building is one of only a few to survive the 1849 riot without damage.\n\nThe Novi Sad Synagogue is one of the biggest synagogues in this part of Europe and an important historical and religious landmark. This three-nave building, built in a secession style, features a 40-metre-high central dome and an ornamented facade. In 1944, it served as an assembly place for Jews who had been arrested prior to deportation to concentration camps.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nSerbian National Theatre at Theatre Square, established in 1861 as Serbia's first professional theatre, hosts opera, ballet, and drama. As well as providing the venue for Novi Sad's Capital of Culture award ceremony, it's also hosted Sterija's Theatre Festival since 1956.\n\nThe beautiful Platoneum building is a cultural monument under state protection, which now houses a branch of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. The decorative features on the facade demonstrate the Romanticism style of architecture. Inside, marvel at the spiral staircase made of pink stone with its richly ornamented wrought iron railing.\n\nThe Banska Palace (also known as the Banovina Palace) is nicknamed the White Cruiser due to its ship-like shape. It's the most famous building designed by architect Dragisa BraÅ¡ovan, and one of Serbia's most beautiful 20th century buildings. This huge, horseshoe-shaped building, with its 42-metre-high tower, served as the seat of the Ban of the Danube Banovina (1939-1941) and the Ban's headquarters. Today it is the seat of the Provincial Government of Vojvodina, and it's worth revisiting at night, when it is spectacularly lit.\n\nThe Museum of Vojvodina is one of the biggest museums in Serbia, with nearly 500,000 original objects in its archaeology, ethnology, history and history of art collections. With an extensive collection of paintings and photographs, plus archives and a library, it's the ideal place to immerse yourself in Vojvodinian cultural heritage.\n\nNext, wander down the charming promenade of Dunavska Street, the oldest street in Novi Sad. Its beautiful, colourful buildings in the neo-baroque style are worth visiting in winter, when their bright facades are illuminated by Christmas lights. Amongst the buildings is the oldest preserved house in Novi Sad, 'Kod Belog Lava'. First mentioned in 1720 as 'the house of soap maker Stojan Maslak,' it is likely to be even older. Along Dunavska Street, you will also find shops, restaurants, cafes, cosy courtyard bars, and a park.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nDunavski (Danube) Park is a protected green space and one of the oldest parks in Novi Sad. There are hundreds of trees and plants here, including rare species. Take a walk around the lake, with its island, fountain, ducks and swans, for a moment of calm in the city. During the winter, the Park is transformed into the magical' Ice Forest', illuminated with thousands of sparkling Christmas lights. There's a skating rink, a skating track through the trees and around the lake, and booths selling local gifts, delicacies and street food.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nThe Petrovaradin Fortress\n\nThe Petrovaradin Fortress, the second-largest fortress in Europe, is nicknamed 'Gibraltar on the Danube'. Built between 1692 and 1780, it's divided into the Upper and Lower Town (Suburbium) and is home to Novi Sad's famous EXIT festival.\n\nIn the Upper Town, be sure to stop by the famous 'drunk clock' Clock Tower, where the clock hands are backward. The large hand shows the hours and the small shows the minutes. It's believed that this was to help fishermen tell the time from their boats on the Danube. The Upper Town is also home to the central building of the City Museum and Archives, which sits in the TopovnjaÄa structure. Founded in 1954, the museum consists of several departments. The Department of Archaeology focuses on prehistory, antiquity and the Middle Ages, while the Department of History has economic, social, and political history collections, and covers the history of the Fortress itself. The Department of Cultural History, including art, education and publishing exhibits, and the Department of Ethnology, focusing on craft, rural architecture, and everyday life, give you a great sense of the city's heritage and its people. There's also the Hometown Gallery, exhibiting contemporary art.\n\nDuring your visit to the Fortress, make time to visit the Planetarium, the Academy of the Arts, the Observatory and the 'Art Circle', the world's largest informal colony of artists. Marvel at ATELIER 61, an Institution for Tapestry Manufacture established in 1961, which uniquely (in Serbia) combines a workshop area, gallery, and a stunning museum collection. Immerse yourself in history and learn about the numerous legends that surround the Fortress. Visit the underground military galleries, a four-storey communication-defence system. Finally, at the foothill of the Fortress, stop at the Roman Catholic church of St. George, built in the baroque style between 1701 to 1714. Then you can take a much-needed break at one of the cafes and restaurants around the Fortress!\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nEnjoy the City's Green and Blue Spaces\n\nThe Green Spaces Development Strategy (2015-2030) prioritises protecting biodiversity, adaption to climate change, improving sustainability, and reducing emissions. Novi Sad recognises the importance of preserving green spaces and seeks to select climate change-resistant plant species, reduce herbicide and pesticide use, and raise awareness of the need for organic and bio-ecological food production. The government's guidelines are increasing green spaces across Novi Sad, with rooftop gardens, vertical greenery and more green areas around public buildings. As for outdoor activities, Novi Sad offers numerous choices throughout the year, from hiking to horseback riding, and cycling to skiing.\n\nFutoski Park is the ideal place to escape the bustle of the city. It's dog-friendly and family-friendly, featuring playgrounds and a cafe. Just a short walk from the strand beach, you can enjoy the vast green spaces of Limanski Park. Its flower displays and tree-shaded paths make it ideal for a summer stroll, and it has a skate park and street basketball courts too. On the opposite bank of the river sits Kamenica Park, Novi Sad's largest park, with its picnic spots and ponds. Once a castle garden, it's known for its interesting sculptures such as Pet Glava (Five Heads). Historians are unsure if these heads are the castle owners or have some other meaning. Between Kamenica Park and FruÅ¡ka Gora is a popular picnic area, Popovica, which is the start/finish point of the FruÅ¡ka Gora mountaineering marathon held in April.\n\nFruÅ¡ka Gora, one of Serbia's great national parks, sits just 24 km from Novi Sad between the Danube and Sava rivers. Once an island of the Pannonian Sea, this naturally beautiful and fertile green space covers 26 kmÂ². It includes forested areas, rare plants and wildlife, nature reserves, 14 lakes, and around 800 km of marked paths and mountain trails. There are also 17 Orthodox monasteries within the Park, founded between the 15th and 18th centuries.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nOutdoor adventure enthusiasts can enjoy hiking, biking or orienteering, enjoying the meadows, lakes, vineyards, orchards and forests along the way. You might spot one of the deer, boars, or other wildlife that call FruÅ¡ka Gora home. Relax for a bite to eat at one of the picturesque picnic spots such as the StraÅ¾ilovo, IriÅ¡ki venac, Hopovo, Zmajevac, or HajduÄki breg. While it's a lovely place to walk in summer, the park also looks magnificent when its colours have turned to the oranges, reds and golds of autumnâand from November, a winter wonderland awaits, with wintry trees and snow-covered monastery rooftops.\n\nThe Danube Delta is the second largest river delta in Europe, passing through or alongside 10 countries before flowing into the Black Sea. In the summer, swim in the cool water, and cycle along the beautiful bike path (part of the Danube Cycle Path) in the spring and autumn. To experience the river properly, though, spend time on it rather than just beside it. Sail, row, canoe, or water ski on the river for a different perspective on the city.\n\nThe beautiful Å trand (pronounced \"Shtrand\"), is a well-maintained beach on the riverbank that's perfect for a quick dip to cool down in the summer. There are also special nature reserves along the river, such as the ÐÐ¾viljsko-petrovaradinski marshes, where you can spot more than 45 species of birds!\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nFit in a Festival\n\nWhenever you arrive, there's always something going on in Novi Sad. Spring offers Sterija's Theatre Festival, the oldest and most renowned festival of national drama and theatre in Serbia, held annually at the end of May, and Zmaj's Games for Children. In summer, you can enjoy the Opens Youth Fair and the EXIT Festival. Originally a protest festival, EXIT has become one of Europe's top music festivals, held at the Petrovaradin Fortress every July. EXIT 2022 featured Calvin Harris, Iggy Azalea, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, and Sepultura. Autumn features the Festival of Street Musicians and Kaleidoscope of Culture. In winter, join visitors flocking to Novi Sad's Christmas Market, Christmas and New Year concerts, and the Christmas Magic Festival, which also celebrates New Year and lasts well into January. The DoÄek Festival sees in the New Year with performances and events that bring together the arts and sciences. There are also numerous music and dance festivalsâparticularly jazz festivalsâand night bazaars throughout the year.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nTry Local, Authentic Cuisine\n\nMake sure you sample a traditional Serbian delicacy such as sarma (ground pork or beef mixed with rice-rolled cabbage leaves) or gibanica (egg and cheese pie made with filo dough). In winter, warm yourself up with a bowl of paprikaÅ¡ or gulaÅ¡ soup. For a hearty meal, try jaraÄorÄeva Å¡nicla, a rolled veal or pork steak stuffed with kajmak (fluffy, unripened cheese) and then breaded and fried. Pair these dishes with one of many FruÅ¡ka Gora wines or the national drink, rakia. Rakia is the collective name for the traditional fruit brandies of the region, such as plum or pear brandy. Along the Danube, you can also find 'Äardas' fish restaurants offering local fish dishes such as fish stew, soup, catfish, carp, and fried perch.\n\nThe Novi Sad area offers some of Europe's finest wines, so ensure you take a wine-tasting tour. Just 8 km from Novi Sad is Sremski Karlovci, a small, pretty town surrounded by vineyards and wineries. Tour the vineyards, sample local wines and enjoy locally-produced ham and goat's cheese to soak it up! You should also visit the Museum of Beekeeping and Wine Cellar Zivanovic for a fascinating look at the history of beekeeping and winemaking, and a taste of the delicious honey and wine produced by the Zivanovic family. Why not stop at a SalaÅ¡ farmstead for a leisurely, traditional lunch? Savour the moment and enjoy your meal under the shade of the orchard trees, as the locals do.\n\nThe vegetarian and vegan movement hasn't gained as much traction here as it has in cities further west or north, but you will find a few meat-free and vegan restaurants, and suitable options are available in most eateries. Novi Sad's Ananda Restaurant was Serbia's first vegan restaurant, and its fresh, seasonal ingredients come from the market or the restaurateur's own land in Bukovac.\n\nIMAGE: Foundation âNovi Sad â European Capital of Cultureâ\n\nHealth, Wellness and Medical Tourism\n\nAs well as breathing in the fresh air of FruÅ¡ka Gora, prioritise your health and well-being at one of Novi Sad's spas. One is actually in FruÅ¡ka Gora, in the historic town of Vrdnik. Here you will find the Termal resort, offering five pools with thermal water: an open Olympic pool, open children's pool, and indoor recreational, children's, and therapeutic pools. There are also 96 rooms here, two restaurants and an aperitif bar. Terraces offer the ideal place to relax, and the local area offers a historic ruined fort and the natural beauty of FruÅ¡ka Gora. For those wanting to mix business and pleasure, the resort also has a business centre with a 500-seat congress hall and a meeting room for up to 25 people.\n\nIn Novi Sad itself, you can enjoy massages with chocolate, gold, or the warm, scented oil of candle at the LuxSpa to feel relaxed and refreshed. And at the Atrium Hamam & Spa, you can find hammams: Turkish public baths based on the tradition of Roman baths. A hammam is a steam bath where benches, floors, and walls are heated, the air temperature is around 50ÂºC, and the humidity is around 100%. You will leave glowing!\n\nSerbia is also a key destination for medical tourism. People can receive high-quality European standard professional medical treatment for around 10 times less than the global average price, and at five times less than the price in neighbouring countries. Clinics offer aesthetic surgery, fertility treatments, weight loss procedures, and sophisticated dental and orthodontal treatments and surgeries.\n\nIMAGE: Koen Van de moortel\n\nA City That's a Culture Capital Every Year\n\nNovi Sad is a creative, innovative city, proving that smart cities and cultural heritage are not mutually exclusive; you can have it all. Its European Capital of Culture year has spurred it on to greater heights.\n\nBut Novi Sad had a lot to offer before it won the title, and as the year ends and the title passes on to another city, it will continue to offer an amazing number of things to do and see, whatever the season. Petrovardin Fortess alone is enough to keep you occupied for days, and the rest of your week could be lost just enjoying all that the Danube River has to offer.\n\nCome for the culture, but don't forget the food and wine, the wellness centres, the history, or the beautiful natural landscapes Novi Sad has to offer. And don't be surprised if you're drawn back here because there wasn't enough time to fit in everything you wanted to the first time. This friendly, diverse city has so much to offer that we think it may need renaming. So enjoy your visit to Novi Happy!\n\nDiscover more about Novi Sad European Capital of Culture 2022 by visiting:\n\nhttps://novisad2022.rs"
