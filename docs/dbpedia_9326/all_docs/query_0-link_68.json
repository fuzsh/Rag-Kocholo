        "text": "The revolution of 1848–1849 had a significant effect on the Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy, who established their own self-governing entity, the Serbian Vojvodina, within the monarchy. These events also attracted the attention of Serbs living outside the monarchy’s borders, especially those in Montenegro and, in particular, the Metropolitan of Cetinje, Petar II Petrović Njegoš. He wanted to assist his compatriots in the monarchy, and considered this action to be only the first step, albeit a very important one, in the ultimate fight for the liberation and unification of all Serbs within two independent countries: Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nI analyze the role of Petar II Petrović Njegoš as Montenegro's vladika (the hereditary bishop-prince and ruler), as a European statesman, and as a modernizer in the nineteenth century. Although Njegoš is most known for his poetry, the most famous of which is Gorksi Vijenac (The Mountain Wreath), I examine more than his literary works by evaluating his political, social, and economic accomplishments and failures as the traditional ruler of Montenegro, a nationalist, and a diplomat. I scrutinize the successes and failures of Njegoš’s politics in two environments – that of nineteenth century Montenegro and of the European power struggle in the Balkans. Njegoš believed that in order to accomplish stability in his country, he had to establish Montenegro as a political presence in the European state-system, as well as modernize certain aspects of Montenegro’s internal political, economic, and social structures. In his foreign policy, Njegoš diplomatically maneuvered between the Russian, Austrian, and Ottoman Empires. Njegoš’s attempts to transform Montenegro from a tribal state into something that would resemble a European “nation-state” met with a mixed response from his fellow Montenegrins, although his reforms were generally approved and sometimes funded by the European Great Powers. Yearly Russian monetary assistance to Montenegro made Njegoš's internal restructuring possible. His reforms, including the opening of the first elementary school, the formation of a Senate, the creation of his uncle Petar I as a saint, and the establishment of a national treasury and system of taxation, were met with some approval and more noticeable resistance from Montenegro's tribes. Yet he paved the way for the next two generations of Montenegrin rulers to become princes and kings, enabling them to better participate in the increasingly secular world of nineteenth and twentieth century Europe. His life story, especially in regards to his time as vladika of Montenegro, provides important insight into the process of state-building in the Balkans in the nineteenth century, as well as a striking example of Balkan political, economic, and cultural interactions with Western and Central Europe.\n\nThe concept of a Serbian Vojvodina as a political and territorial unit, was present among the Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy from the end of the seventeenth century until the First World War. During the period it existed (1848-1861) or when demands for it again emerged (before 1848 and after 1861) the question of its borders arose. This became especially apparent when the people in Vojvodina voluntarily joined the Kingdom of Serbia, which subsequently became a newly formed state for Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in December 1918. When a common state was created, the issue of Vojvodina's borders centered on its northern borders, which were defended at the Paris Peace Conference according to historical and ethnic principles."
