        "text": "The history of a uniquely fascinating region, whose seat is soon to be the European Capital of Culture, as told by a team of renowned academics. \"Neumann's book has many qualities - it is beautifully presented, very wide ranging and nicely illustrated - but above all it is a reminder of what the radical right wants to destroy, and how it wants to turn a vibrant, thriving scene into a world of sameness and conformity.\" - Dan Stone, Professor of Modern History at Royal Holloway, University of London ‘For all those who (we hope) will visit Timișoara during its year as European Capital of Culture, Victor Neumann’s volume provides a welcome introduction to the city and region, of the highest scientific and intellectual quality.’ - Observator Cultural\"…an innovative, monographic illustration of the research topic through cooperation between specialists. Even those who know the history of Banat will find new perspectives.\" - Armin HeinenThe Banat is a uniquely fascinating example of a European cross-border region, incorporating parts of western Romania, northeastern Serbia and a small area of southeastern Hungary. The team of historians, headed by Professor Victor Neumann of the West University in Timisoara, who have contributed to this volume are drawn from across the three modern nations of the region. They analyse the history and culture of the Banat from the earliest times, focusing on the 300 years since it was captured from the Ottoman Turks by Prince Eugene of Savoy. Today this ethnically diverse region has a distinct character of its own, and its Romanian seat, the city of Timisoara, exudes a character quite different from Transylvania and the rest of Romania. This new English edition of the book (originally published in Romanian in 2016 under the title Istoria Banatului) has been expanded and is published to support Timisoara's designation as European Capital of Culture in 2023."
