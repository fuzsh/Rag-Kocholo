Also dubbed \"Little Vienna\", Timișoara boasts outstanding architecture, dominated by Baroque and Secession styles.

During our city tour, you will find out how the 1989 anti-communism revolution started in Timisoara, unfolded and how it spread nationally to finally overthrow Ceasescu’s dictatorial regime.

The Catholics of Banat and their priests attend services in Hungarian, German, Romanian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Czech and Slovakian. The beginning of the monastery dates back to the year of 1551, when it was established by the Franciscan monks from Bosnia. It was built between 1727 and 1826, with elements from the baroque (grotesque) style. Next, arrival in Charlottenburg—a land where Romanians, Swabians, Serbians and Hungarians lived together for centuries. The only round village in the country, Charlottenburg is a unique 18th-century village built by Swabians, German colonists coming from Baden-Wurttemberg, Lorraine and South Tyrol. The houses, stables and barns form a perfect circle, with all the houses being the same height and having the same distance between them, creating a perfect symmetry. Today, there are only a few Swabians left, but the village is an unparalleled landmark in the region. Last stop for today – to the \"Nikolaus Lenau\" puppet museum, where we will discover an ethnographic exhibition of around 56 pairs of puppets from the western Romanian region of Banat. Being also a museum dedicated to Nikolaus Lenau, an Austrian romantic poet who was born there in 1802, we will find here on display lots of books, paintings depicting the life of the poet and that of his family, as well as translations of Lenau's poems in Romanian and manuscripts that were property of Nikolaus Lenau.

In 1817, when the Banat region was celebrating the 100th anniversary of its liberation from the Ottoman Oppression, a historic moment took place in Oraviţa: the inauguration of the Old Theatre, the first theatre ever founded in the entire present-day Romanian territory. Visit the theatre and drive further to Baile Herculane. One of the best and oldest thermal resorts in the world, named the Pearl of Banat, Herculane Baths is the most important spa resort in Romania, with an age of about 2,000 years. In modern times, the spa town has been visited for its supposedly natural healing properties: hot springs with sulfur, chlorine, sodium, calcium, magnesium and other minerals. Traditional lunch on the way. Continue towards Drobeta Turnu-Severin and enjoy the gorge of Europe's second-longest river, the Danube. The river created in time a series of four steep gorges separated from each other by ravines and broad basins, known as the Iron Gate. In the 1970-ties, Yugoslavia and Romania built a massive lock and the Iron Gate Dam to help control the river's speed and make navigation safer. After constructing the hydroelectric power plant, the water level got 130 feet higher and the river flowing through the Iron Gates finally calmed. We shall visit the Iron Gates Region Museum, which currently exhibits ethnography and natural sciences sections and hosts a model of Trajan’s bridge. Free time and accommodation to 4* Continental Drobeta Turnu-Severin Hotel.\n\nIncluded meals:\n\nTraditional Lunch on the way."
