I wanted to book ahead of time at GeaTours, starting emails a month ago but it was too early. They said I should only ask just before my travel date, but of course now that I have asked they are no seats left for the 12th. All this experience is quite frustrating.\n\nDo you know another bus company ? I am having a hard time finding solutions, it is also a shame the train has never been renovated :(\n\nI have found Simplicity using omio search engine, but the cost is aberrant (105€ for 2 people)… Also no BlaBlaCar available."
