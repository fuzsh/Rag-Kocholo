        "text": "Life in Vojvodina is colorful in many ways. If you seek rich, fertile land, Vojvodina is the answer, with 84% of its territory covered by fertile soil. Vojvodina’s Deliblatska pescara (Deliblato Sands) is your destination if you are looking for a European desert. If water interests you, Vojvodina offers an abundance of rivers like the Danube, Sava, Tisa, Begej, Tamiš, Karaš, and Bosut, along with numerous lakes and canals used for agriculture and transportation.\n\nThe peaceful plains intersected with rivers and a lone mountain, a remnant of the ancient Pannonia Sea, host picturesque villages adorned with the iconography of various ethnic groups. These villages celebrate their long winemaking tradition and hold festivals dedicated to wine, sausages, bacon, pumpkin, cabbage, cakes, eggs, beans, ham, and various music genres.\n\nLiving or staying in Vojvodina means attending the EXIT Festival, enjoying performances by top jazz musicians at the Novi Sad Jazz Festival, and participating in events like the “Sterijino Pozorje” Theatre Festival, Festival of Street Musicians, NOMUS International Music Festival, and concerts of modern music.\n\nVojvodina’s beautiful landscape, mild climate, and multicultural environment, where 26 nations live and work together, make it a prime location for investment. Over the past decade, 388 foreign companies have invested over 11 billion Euros, employing over 100,000 people. Many of these companies have expanded their operations due to the region’s profitability and success.\n\nA plain with a mountain, a network of rivers, canals, and lakes, Vojvodina seamlessly blends nature and urban life, colors and cultures, knowledge and experiences, work and enjoyment.\n\nVojvodina is all that and so much more."
