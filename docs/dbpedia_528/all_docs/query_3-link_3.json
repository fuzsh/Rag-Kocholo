        "text": "Newhaven Harbour Railway Station is one of two active stations serving Newhaven in East Sussex, England, the other being Newhaven Town. A third, Newhaven Marine, is legally open, but has no service because its roof is unsafe.\n\nOpened in 1847 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway on a line engineered by Frederick Banister, trains are operated by Southern on the Seaford Branch of the East Coastway Line. Beyond the station en route to Bishopstone, the line reduces to single track to Seaford.\n\nPassengers for cross-channel ferries are advised to travel to Newhaven Town, and then use the free bus service; this has resulted in a dramatic fall in passengers at the station, leading to questions about its future.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
