I thought the only reason that the parliamentary train ran empty was because the station building and roof were unsafe? However now that they have been removed what is stopping Southern Rail from accepting passengers? The station is now fully open with no fence and anyone can just simply walk on to the platform so i can't see any reason for them not carrying passengers on the parliamentary service again?\n\n15 Feb 2019\n\n#198\n\n_toommm_\n\nEstablished Member\n\nJoined\n\n8 Jul 2017\n\nMessages\n\n5,909\n\nLocation\n\nYorkshire\n\nAny idea if trains will actually carry passengers to and from Newhaven Marine again?

Also platform 4 becomes bidirectional.\n\nNew fixed red down direction on the up line southerham Jcn side of Lewes junction.\n\nA new Mainline aspect vice shunt signal for up moves from the down line southerham side of Lewes junction.\n\nSo in theory they should be able to turn two trains together when services are diverted between Keymer Junction and Brighton.\n\nAnd that’s about it.\n\n16 Feb 2019\n\n#209\n\nA very detailed response @Sunset route\n\nSeaford's starting signal (NH42) is still the old 3 aspect type but has a new plate so I wonder if the arrangement will remain as current: showing yellow when NH102 at Bishopstone is red, or green when NH102 is cleared"
