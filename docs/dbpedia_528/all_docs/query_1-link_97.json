Newhaven rail links directly with Lewes and Brighton for onward travel where as from Peacehaven you'd need to get a bus.\n\nOn the downside the port and nearby light industry (including the incinerator) bring Newhaven down a bit.\n\nSeaford is nicer than either, though more expensive.\n\n5\n\n8\n\nOn 28 Feb 2017 at 9:25pm Old timer wrote:\n\nI would say newhaven but only just.

Large sainsburys nearby also lidl, B&Q, Halfords, Pets at Home.\n\nNice riverside walks and access to the downs. Newhaven Fort and local museum. Big Garden centre. Yes we do have an incinerator but you get used to it. Port doesn't bring newhaven down - ferry to dieppe, marina, new harbourside college, busy lifeboat station. Downside is that traffic can be crap during rush hour but this is also the same on the south coast road at peacehaven as well. Seaford nice but rapidly becoming God's waiting room...\n\n3\n\n1\n\nOn 1 Mar 2017 at 7:09am Dentonion wrote:\n\nI would say Newhaven probably easier for commuting .... or of course Denton or south heightons are really lovely villages ,and only a 20 mins walk from Newhaven\n\n8\n\n3\n\nOn 1 Mar 2017 at 11:42am Observer wrote:\n\n\"Why post this on THE LEWES forum ?\"\n\nBecause both places are in Lewes.\n\nThe District, that is.\n\nBut is this the Lewes (Town) Forum or the Lewes (District) Forum?\n\n4\n\n3\n\nOn 1 Mar 2017 at 11:46am bitofakerfuffle wrote:\n\nThanks for this - I am not familiar with Sussex really (Bexley/Kent man, originally) - could Newhaven be compared to Haywards Heath, or far more down-at-heel...\n\nOh yes, forgot to say, don't drive, so bus/train is way around.

However, it certainly has character and real people, and outside the old town centre chain stores and supermarkets that serve the District. Unlike Lewes, it has a McDonalds. It has decent communications, by Sussex standards, but not what you may be used to in Crawley or Bexley. Housing is cheaper than in other nearby towns, so lots of young people who are driven out of Brighton or Lewes. It is planned to take most of the District's development over the next 15 years and at risk of becoming the part of greater Brighton you live in if you can't afford real Brighton.\n\nPeacehaven is a cheapish Brighton suburb, planted in the 1920s by an early plotlands developer - he just sold plots of downland that no one wanted to farm for Â£10 each and you could camp on them or build a shack or a house or whatever you wanted. It's lack of planning made it one of the main examples that led to the introduction of the planning system in 1947. It features in every student planner's training manual as how not to design a new town. Built on a grid pattern, with many of the roads frustratingly stopped up. It has a sad little shopping centre out the back, but most people only see the coast road when driving through, very slowly. Don't buy too near the cliffs.\n\nOddly for one of the poorest parts of Lewes District in income terms, it votes solidly Tory/UKIP. Newhaven used to be a LibDem stronghold in the days when there were LibDems. The far wealthier residents of Lewes town vote everything but Tory.\n\n3\n\n1\n\nOn 2 Mar 2017 at 7:39pm Plumber wrote:\n\nNewhaven. It seems to be going up and has some character.\n\nPeacehaven will only get worse. Traffic is bad at rush hour, buses now have a dedicated lane, so car traffic is worse."
