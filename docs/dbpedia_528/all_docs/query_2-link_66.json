        "text": "Train operator Southern has revealed that passengers using two small, unstaffed stations in East Sussex will now be able to get train service information from electronic screens.\n\nGlynde and Southease stations are both near the county town of Lewes.\n\nSouthern has installed new digital screens at both stations, as part of its annual investment to improve journey experience at small stations.\n\nThe two stations\n\nGlynde station opened in 1846, and is 53 miles south of London Bridge.\n\nAlthough it is the nearest station to the famous opera venue at Glyndebourne, it is easier to get to the venue from Lewes station, from which a shuttle bus service runs.\n\nSouthease station serves a small village just off the C7 road from Lewes to the port town of Newhaven and is also around 53 miles from London Bridge.\n\nThe station allows access to walking routes along the River Ouse, with the South Downs Way crossing the Ouse at this location.\n\nOpened in 1906, Southease station is unstaffed and is used for over twenty thousand journeys per year.\n\nOther improvements to small Sussex stations\n\nLast year, Southern installed new screens or public announcement systems at seven small rural East Sussex stations: Newhaven Harbour, Bishopstone, Pevensey Bay, Normans Bay, Three Oaks, Doleham and Winchelsea.\n\nIt also opened a new footbridge and lifts providing step-free access at Crowborough station, also in East Sussex.\n\nThis year, the operator plans projects on its network including new accessible toilets, automatic doors and ramps, more secure cycle parking, and extra waiting shelters.\n\nSouthern's head of stations welcomes improvements\n\n“Many of these projects were suggested by passengers, local communities and station teams. They might be small schemes but they address local needs and make a big difference for many of our customers.\n\n“We're constantly working to make our train services and stations more attractive and accessible, to give our passengers a better all-round journey experience. And among our station teams, the improvements also foster pride in their workplace.”\n\nStephen MacCallaugh, Southern's Head of Stations"
