We are nine minutes from Brighton, an hour from London and 30 minutes away from an international airport.\n\nTrain\n\nYou can reach the University of Sussex directly from Brighton Station and Lewes Station. Falmer Station is directly opposite the campus. You can walk to the campus from the station through a subway under the A27. Follow signs for the University of Sussex (the University of Brighton also has a campus at Falmer).\n\nYou can get from Brighton to Falmer in nine minutes by train. Four trains an hour go to Falmer during the day. If you are travelling from London and the west, take a train to Brighton and change there for Falmer.\n\nThe journey time from London to Brighton is just under an hour. You can also change at Lewes for Falmer, if you are coming from the east.\n\nSee National Rail Enquiries for train times.\n\nCar\n\nThe University is at Falmer on the A27 between Brighton and Lewes, about four miles (six kilometres) from the centre of Brighton.\n\nFollow signs for the University of Sussex, which is on the north side of the A27. The University of Brighton also has a campus at Falmer, on the south side of the A27.\n\nIf you are coming from London and the north, take the M23/A23 road towards Brighton. Before you enter Brighton, join the A27 eastbound signposting Lewes. If you're travelling from the east or west take the A27 direct to the University.\n\nParking on campus\n\nParking on campus is limited and there is normally a daily parking charge for visitors. This does not apply for open and admissions days or any visits arranged through the Student Recruitment Services Office.\n\nThere is designated visitor parking, which is signposted on campus. Car parks are not attended and you should not leave objects of value in your vehicle.\n\nParking in Brighton\n\nThere are 600 spaces at Brighton Station, although it is normally busy on Saturdays.\n\nDetails of how to pay by phone are displayed in the car park.\n\nThe following car parks are the closest to bus stops for the number 25 bus route serving the campus:\n\nNCP\n\nThe Laines, BN1 1ND\n\nTrafalgar Street, BN1 4DY\n\nLondon Road, BN1 4GE\n\nChurchill Square, BN1 2FB\n\nYou can go to Parkopedia to find out the costs of parking in each car park, and find out more information about parking in Brighton on the Visit Brighton website.\n\nParking in Lewes\n\nThere are 272 spaces at Lewes Station.\n\nSee the Lewes District Council website or the East Sussex County Council website for more information about parking and car parks in Lewes.\n\nBus\n\nThe 23, 25, 25X, 28, 29 and 701 buses run between the centre of Brighton and the campus.\n\nThe 25 buses run from Palmeira Square in Hove, through Churchill Square and the Old Steine in Brighton, into the campus.\n\nThe 23 route runs from Brighton Marina in the east, through Hanover, into the campus.\n\nThe 28 and 29 go from Churchill Square and stop outside the University campus.\n\nThe Stagecoach 701 route runs from Eastbourne to Brighton and stops outside the University campus.\n\nSome 5B (Hollingbury) and 50 (Hollingdean) buses also run to the campus.\n\nTravel time between the campus and Brighton is about 20 minutes.
