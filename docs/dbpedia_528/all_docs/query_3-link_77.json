        "text": "London Kings Cross Trains\n\nKing's Cross railway station, also known as London King's Cross, is a passenger railway terminus in the London Borough of Camden, on the edge of Central London.\n\nKing's Cross is one of the busiest stations in the United Kingdom, and the southern terminus of the East Coast Main Line to North East England and Scotland.\n\nKing's Cross Station is a major railway and underground station in London. The station is in central London and close to Kings Cross, Regent's Park, Somers Town and Bloomsbury.\n\nKing's Cross Station is next to King's Cross St Pancras Underground Station which is on the Circle line, the Metropolitan Line, the Hammersmith & City Line and the Victoria Line.\n\nKing's Cross Station is near many tourist attractions including The British Library and Regent's Park. The station is also home to the legendary Platform 9 3/4 where the train to Hogwarts departs.\n\nSeveral London bus routes, including 30, 59, 73, 91, 205, 390 and 476 pass in front of or to the side of Kings Cross station.\n\nThe area known as Kingâs Cross got its name from a statue of King George IV erected at the crossroads of what is now Euston Road, York Way, Pentonville Road and Grays Inn Road.\n\nThe monument itself was short lived, being completed in 1836 and demolished in 1845, but the area retained the name after the London Kingâs Cross Train Station was dedicated to King George IV.\n\nPlan Your London Kings Cross Train Journey\n\nTravel by train to London can often be costly. You can however reduce the cost of your train ticket to London quite considerably by following these simple travel tips:-\n\nBook Your Kings Cross Train Tickets In Advance\n\nYou are able to book train tickets to London Kings Cross from Newhaven Harbour by as much as twelve weeks in advance.

However, you may find it a lot cheaper to buy a ticket from A to B, and another from B to C and still another from C to D for a cheaper combined train ticket price.
