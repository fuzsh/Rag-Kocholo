East Sussex at a glance\n\nEast Sussex is a county in the South East of England, which covers an area of 1,792 sq. km (692 square miles) and includes the administrative boroughs and districts of Eastbourne, Hastings, Lewes, Rother, and Wealden (Figure 2.1).\n\nThe county is located south of London with Kent to the north and east, West Sussex and the City of Brighton & Hove to the west and Surrey to the north west.\n\nKey transport network facts:\n\n3,375km of carriageway\n\n2,481km of footways and cycleways\n\n55km being segregated cycleways\n\n483 bridges\n\n2 tunnels\n\n37,500 street lights\n\n66 signal controlled junctions, 140 signal controlled crossings\n\n24.7km of guard rail\n\n40,000 safety bollards\n\n43,695 road signs\n\n2,500km of road markings\n\n28.5km of safety fences / barriers\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures\n\nPopulation\n\nBased on the Office for National Statistics (ONS) 2021 Census, the population in East Sussex is approximately 546,000, an increase of over 19,000 people (3.6%) since 2011, with population increases in every district (sources: ONS and East Sussex in Figures).\n\nFigure 2.2 shows the population distribution across East Sussex and highlights the rural nature of the region with population densities below 210 people per km2 in the majority of inland areas.\n\nThe most densely populated towns are located on the coast in Peacehaven, Seaford, Eastbourne, Bexhill-on-Sea and Hastings. However, there are also several other densely populated towns located inland, including Lewes, Hailsham, Uckfield and Crowborough. Towns also play an important role in serving their surrounding rural communities.\n\nWithin East Sussex, Wealden is the most populated district, with 160,000 residents. The area has also seen the largest increase in population with an additional 11,000 people compared to 2011 and 20,000 compared to 2001 (an increase of 7.5% and 14% respectively). Hastings has the smallest population at 91,000 and has also seen the lowest population increase with under 900 additional residents since 2011 and 6,000 since 2001 (1% and 7% respectively).\n\nFigure 2.3 shows the 2020-based, population projections from East Sussex County Council, released in April 2022 prior to the 2021 Census data becoming available. These projections forecast the East Sussex population to increase to 628,000 by 2035, an increase of 12% against the 2020 figure (and 15% against the 2021 Census).\n\nBased on these projections, all districts are expected to increase in population by 2035, with notable changes including:\n\nWealden is expected to see the greatest increase in population at 22% with an additional 43,600 people,\n\nEastbourne is expected to see the smallest increase at 4% with an additional 4,100 people,\n\nHastings is expected to have 5,000 more residents (+5.4%), Lewes 11,200 (+11%) and Rother 12,100 (+12.5%).\n\nThis population growth will create a need for more new housing, improved/accessible transport and additional employment opportunities.\n\nNote: As this projection was undertaken in April 2022, it does not include 2021 Census data that released in early 2023.\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics (P04 Census 2021: Usual resident population density, local authorities in England and Wales)\n\nDemographics\n\nEast Sussex has an ageing population with over 65s increasing from 112,000 in 2001 to 143,000 by 2021, a 27% increase. Wealden has seen the most significant increase in the number of people aged over 65, increasing from 30,000 in 2001 to 42,000 in 2021, a 43% increase (source: East Sussex in Figures).\n\nPopulation projections by local authority (2020 to 2035) Population of (geography) 2020 2025 2030 2035 Eastbourne 103,324 104,834 106,324 107,459 Hastings 92,554 93,992 96,001 97,508 Lewes 103,525 106,405 110,891 114,725 Rother 96,716 99,338 104,741 108,828 Wealden 162,733 170,973 187,294 199,148 East Sussex 558,852 575,544 605,250 627,667\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures (Population projections by age and sex (dwelling-led), 2020-2035 – districts)\n\n20 year change\n\nFigure 2.4 shows the change in population for different age groups over the two decades between the 2001 Census and 2021. Figure 2.5 shows the same over the last decade since 2011. While the trends are mixed over the last 20 years, since 2011 there has been a significant decrease of 8,000 or 5% of residents aged between 15 and 44.\n\nWhile some of this change has resulted from aging (e.g. those in the 45-64 age group in 2001 moved into the over 65s group in 2021), the number of people in East Sussex within the 25-44 age group has decreased from a high of 120,000 in 2001, to 117,000 in 2011 and then to 115,000 in 2021 (a 4.3% decrease). Only the district of Eastbourne has seen an increase in people aged between 25-44 since 2001 (23,000 compared to 24,000 in 2021).\n\n20 year population change by age (2001 and 2021) Age group Eastbourne Hastings Lewes Rother Wealden Under 15 6% -9% -4% -6% -2% 15-24 8% -1% 5% 11% 17% 25-44 4% -2% -8% -8% -7% 45-64 32% 35% 17% 15% 21% Over 65 13% 20% 27% 24% 43%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures (Population by age and sex, 2001-2021 – districts)\n\nFigure 2.5 shows that the number of children aged between 0 and 14 years in East Sussex has fallen from 87,100 in 2001 to 84,900 in 2011 and further again to 84,300 in 2021 (a 3.2% reduction). Eastbourne has gone against this trend with 15,100 under 15s in 2001, 15,600 in 2011 and 16,000 in 2021 (a 6% increase).\n\n10 year population change by age (2011 and 2021) Age group Eastbourne Hastings Lewes Rother Wealden Under 15 3% -2% -1% -4% 0% 15-24 -15% -20% -9% -7% -2% 25-44 -3% -3% -5% -1% 2% 45-64 7% 5% 1% -2% 5% Over 65 12% 19% 20% 17% +24%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures (Population by age and sex, 2001-2021 – districts)\n\nFigure 2.6 shows an expected population increase of 12% by 2035 by age group., As this projection was undertaken before its release, 2021 Census data was not taken into account.\n\nThese projections show that:\n\nThe population of those aged between 0 and 17 years of age are expected to increase by only 1% between 2020 and 2035.\n\nThose aged over 65 are projected to increase from around 146,100 in 2020 to 202,100 in 2035, an increase of 38%.\n\nWealden would see the largest increase in the number of people aged over 65, increasing from approximately 42,680 in 2020 to 62,600 in 2035, (47% increase).\n\nWealden is also expected to see the largest increase in those aged 0-17 with 13.5% increase expected by 2035, and those aged 18 to 64 (13.8% increase).\n\nThose aged 0-17 in Eastbourne are expected to decrease by 11% from approximately 19,900 to just over 17,800 by 2035.\n\nThe implications of this ageing population include ensuring there are viable alternative transport options for those who are unable to drive, and amenities such as healthcare centres, care homes and other vital services that can be accessed by a range of transport (including non-car) modes.\n\nPopulation projection by age group (2020 to 2035) Age group Eastbourne Hastings Lewes Rother Wealden 0-17 -11% -8% 1% 3% 14% 18-64 -5% -1% 3% 2% 14% Over 65 34% 37% 34% 35% 47%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures (Population by age and sex (dwelling-led), 2020-2035 – districts)\n\nEthnicity\n\nIn the 2021 Census the majority of people in East Sussex (94%) identified as white – 13% more than the average for England (Figure 2.7).

Conversely, the number of people employed in the public sector has decreased, with 3,200 fewer staff in public sector employment in 2020 compared to 2010 (Table 2.1).\n\nThe largest sectors in East Sussex in 2020 in terms of numbers employed were public administration, education and health where 60,000 people were employed (a decrease of 2,000 (-3%) compared 2015) and Wholesale and retail trade where 30,000 people were employed (a decrease of 3,000 (9%) compared to 2015) (Figure 2.9).\n\nTable 2.1 Employment by full-time and part-time employees Employment type / Year 2010 2020 Full time employees 104,000 112,000 Part time employees 64,000 65,000 Total public sector employees 37,000 (22%) 34,000 (19%) Total private sector employees 131,000 (78%) 144,000 (81%) Total employees 168,900 (100%) 178,000 (100%) Total public sector employment 37,000 (21%) 34,000 (18%) Total private sector employment 139,000 (79%) 151,000 (82%) Total employment 176,000 (100%) 184,000 (100%)\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures\n\nEmployment by Industry Industry / Geography East Sussex England Ag, fishing, mining, utilities 4% 3% Manufacturing 6% 8% Construction 7% 5% Wholesale, retail trade, motors 16% 15% Transportation and storage 3% 5% Accom and food 9% 7% Information and communication 3% 5% Financial, ins and real estate 4% 5% Prof, sci, and tech 7% 9% Admin and Support 5% 9% Public admin, education and health 32% 26% Arts, entertainment and recreation 3% 2% Other service activities 3% 2%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures\n\nArts, entertainment and recreation saw an increase in employment between 2015 and 2020, although this only amounts to an increase from 5,000 to 6,000 people (as the underlying datasets are rounded to the nearest 1,000, this could be a small change or up to a 20% increase). Construction as well as agriculture, fishing, mining and utilities also saw double-digit growth with the number of people employed in each industry increasing by 18% and 17% respectively (Figure 2.10).\n\nEastbourne, and Hastings, saw growth in agriculture, fishing, mining and utilities although the number of people employed in the sector was still low at 300 people. Lewes district saw growth in the number of people employed in arts, entertainment and recreation, increasing from 900 people to 1,250.\n\nIn terms of the location of jobs, Figure 2.12 shows the jobs density (ratio of the number of jobs in each district and borough to the resident working-age population of that area) in 2020. Both Eastbourne and Lewes district have a higher jobs density suggesting there is a higher proportion of jobs available in these districts; Wealden, Rother and Hastings have a lower proportion of jobs for every working age resident.\n\nEmployment Change by Industry (2015-2020) Industry / Geography East Sussex England Ag, fishing, mining, utilities 17% 10% Manufacturing 0% -2% Construction 18% 9% Wholesale, retail trade, motors -9% -2% Transportation and storage 0% 14% Accom and food -11% 3% Information and communication 0% 8% Financial, ins and real estate 0% 4% Prof, sci, and tech 8% 6% Admin and Support 0% -1% Public admin, education and health -3% 4% Arts, entertainment and recreation 20% -1% Other service activities 0% -6%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures\n\nThis economic disparity is reflected in the relatively poor earnings levels of the county.

After using a car or van, most trips were made on foot in East Sussex (12%), with the highest proportion of people commuting to work on foot in Hastings (16%).\n\nA higher proportion of people worked mainly from home in East Sussex (8%) than in England and Wales (5.4%) with levels highest in Wealden and Rother; only Hastings has fewer people working from home compared to England and Wales. More people work from home in East Sussex than use all forms of public transport.\n\nThe pandemic has changed travel and work patterns, however any change in long term trends will take some time to become clear. In the shorter term, working from home remains more common in many sectors where it is an option. Such uncertainty of trends will need to be factored into decisions made based on this evidence base.\n\nThe 2021 Census, whilst available, was undertaken during a period of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and at least a fifth of all residents across all five of East Sussex’s districts and boroughs worked mainly at or from home.\n\nTravel to Work Mode Share in 2011 Geography Work at Home Public Transport Car, Van, Taxi, Motorcycle Active travel Other Eastbourne 5% 12% 65% 18% 1% Hastings 6% 12% 64% 17% 1% Lewes 8% 16% 63% 13% 1% Rother 10% 9% 69% 12% 1% Wealden 10% 9% 71% 9% 0% East Sussex 8% 11% 67% 13% 1% England and Wales 6% 16% 64% 14% 1%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures\n\nExisting Public Transport Network\n\nThe public transport network in East Sussex is presented in Figure 2.14. Rail transports high volumes of travellers from the south coast to London as well as to Gatwick Airport, one of the busiest international airports in the country.\n\nStations are provided in many East Sussex towns, with settlements on the south coast also benefitting from having access to additional local stations (e.g. Hampden Park in Eastbourne). However, some large towns such as Heathfield and Hailsham do not have a station and so are more likely to be reliant on the bus service or travelling by private car.\n\nIn terms of bus routes, there are inter-urban corridors that connect major towns together alongside routes that serve urban areas and their surrounding hinterlands. Although the bus network is relatively extensive bus passenger journeys have continued to decrease over a 10 year period from 2008-09 to 2018-19 .\n\nRural bus services tend to be less frequent and or on-demand, with a number of services provided by community bus operators that have lower overheads than larger companies. Figure 2.15 shows the bus network and frequencies on a Wednesday AM peak across East Sussex with locations served and route frequencies..\n\nSome communities in East Sussex are not served by rail (e.g. Heathfield) or bus (e.g. Ripe) and these areas can be considered disconnected from other settlements by public transport. Key elements of the East Sussex public transport network include:\n\n38 national rail stations\n\n3,264 bus stops\n\n766 with shelters\n\n833 with seating\n\n1,673 with timetable information (printed)\n\n142 with real time passenger information screens\n\n510 with raised kerbs\n\nSource: Ordnance Survey\n\nSource: Bus Service Improvement Plan\n\nBus Passenger Journeys\n\nPassenger numbers in East Sussex decreased from 19 million in 2009/10 to 16 million in 2018/19 reflecting the declining national trend. Over this period many local transport authorities reduced their funding for supported bus services, with the decline in passenger numbers in East Sussex occurring earlier than the decline for other county councils in the South East (source: Bus Service Improvement Plan).\n\nFigure 2.16 shows bus patronage levels, and how the decline was slower prior to the pandemic.\n\nBus patronage decline may also be influenced by increasing fares, reduced services and unreliability of services that impact the relative attractiveness of buses compared with online shopping and home working.\n\nBus Passenger Journeys Years Passenger Journeys 2009/10 18,893,636 2010/11 20,670,896 2011/12 20,797,486 2012/13 21,301,915 2013/14 22,526,659 2014/15 21,869,810 2015/16 20,530,986 2016/17 17,125,000 2017/18 16,419,741 2018/19 16,272,866 2019/20 15,025,860 2020/21 6,155,700\n\nSource: Department for Transport\n\nRailway Station Entries and Exits\n\nThere are 38 national railway stations in East Sussex. Entries and exit figures at East Sussex stations had been increasing gradually, reaching a high of 18.4 million entry and exits in 2019-2020 (Office of Road and Rail). However, the number of entries and exits decreased to 5.6 million in 2020-21 due to the pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movements and use of services. The 2021-22 figures show that across East Sussex there is partial recovery in rail demand.\n\nKey observations from the 2019-20 peak include:\n\nEastbourne was the busiest station in the county with over 3.6 million entry and exits and 61,000 interchanges,\n\nLewes had the second highest number of entries and exits (2.6 million) and the greatest number of interchanges (508,000),\n\nHastings had 2.4 million entries and exits and 65,000 Interchanges), and\n\nBexhill and Polegate also experienced 1.5 million and 1 million entries and exits respectively.\n\nThere are 12 stations in East Sussex with entry and exit figures are below 100,000 per annum (Berwick (Sussex), Bishopstone (Sussex), Cooksbridge, Crowhurst, Doleham, Glynde, Newhaven Harbour, Normans Bay, Pevensey Bay, Southease, Three Oaks and Winchelsea).\n\nWhile largely serving rural communities, these stations provide an important function in helping passengers access goods and services, via rail, that they may not otherwise be able.\n\nStation Entries and Exits 2011-2021 -

Managing these routes will help ensure that key destinations of employment and leisure are more easily accessible by walking, cycling and horse riding.\n\nIn terms of cycle routes, NCN route 21 extends from Greenwich, out of London to Eastbourne, providing a north-south connection across East Sussex. Using the ferry link between Newhaven and Dieppe, this then provides a continued cycle connection as part of Avenue Verte to Paris.\n\nNCN route 2 extends along the south coast and connects coastal communities between Peacehaven and Camber, with continued links west to Cornwall and east to Dover.\n\nThere are also several other key cycle routes through and within East Sussex providing connections between different towns and cities. As with most such networks across the UK, further work is needed to provide continuous/segregated and well signed routes that allow people of all abilities to feel comfortable using them for leisure and commuting purposes.\n\nThe NCN routes are also supplemented by bridleways and byways open to all traffic (BOATs) which allow access for cycles. These routes can be important links in the cycle network, providing off-carriageway routes between settlements; however, they are not extensive, and the terrain and condition of such routes can vary and are not suitable for cyclists of all levels of ability.\n\nSources: East Sussex County Council (via arcgis) and Sustrans\n\nRoad Network and Condition\n\nEast Sussex has 3,375km of roads in the county (Figure 2.24) The main road network is characterised by A and B roads running north-south or east-west, and C and unclassified roads providing localised travel opportunities, and connectivity across the border into Brighton, Kent, Surrey, West Sussex and beyond.\n\nLocal highway authorities are responsible for maintaining, managing and, where necessary, improving their network which is comprised of major ‘A’ roads, as well as local classified and unclassified roads. Major ‘A’ roads in the county include the A26 linking Lewes to Tunbridge Wells via Uckfield and Crowborough; the A22 linking East Grinstead, Uckfield, Hailsham and Eastbourne, and the A259 linking Brighton, Peacehaven, Newhaven, Seaford and Eastbourne.\n\nNational Highways are responsible for the maintenance and management of the Strategic Road Network. In East Sussex, this includes the A21 (north of Hastings to north of Flimwell), the A27/A259 (Falmer to Glyne Gap and Batchelors Bump to East Guldeford) and the A26 (Beddingham to Newhaven)..\n\nFigure 2.23 shows the percentage of roads where maintenance should be considered across East Sussex. Although there was a slight increase in 2019-20, the general trend suggests that road maintenance programmes across East Sussex are working.\n\nHowever, it should also be noted that there is variation by road type and in 2019-20, there was a significantly higher proportion of unclassified roads requiring maintenance (14%) compared to principal and non-principal roads (5%). This therefore indicates that more work needs to be done to improve the condition of local roads, although this may be difficult against a backdrop of local government spending cuts.\n\nRoad Maintenance Year Unclassified Non-principal (LA maintained 'B' and 'C' roads Principal (LA maintained 'A' Roads) 2007/08 12% 15% 14% 2008/09 9% 13% 13% 2009/10 11% 10% 10% 2010/11 15% 10% 10% 2011/12 19% 13% 10% 2012/13 19% 10% 8% 2013/14 25% 9% 7% 2014/15 22% 9% 5% 2015/16 22% 6% 5% 2016/17 19% 6% 5% 2017/18 14% 7% 4% 2018/19 9% 7% 5% 2019/20 14% 5% 5%\n\nSource: Ordnance Survey\n\nPorts and airports\n\nNewhaven is a major port in East Sussex, facilitating movement of 986 tonnes of freight in 2021.27 This is lower than the 1,885 peak of the late 1980s. The port also provides an international ferry link to Dieppe in France.\n\nThe port is served by the Newhaven Harbour Railway Station.

Gatwick has a single runway but is seeking to expand with a second runway by utilising its existing standby runway on a permanent basis for the departures of smaller aircraft.\n\nOver 1,000 East Sussex residents worked at Gatwick in 2015. Wealden, Lewes, and Eastbourne are the East Sussex local authorities with the greatest share of residents directly employed at Gatwick (Figure 2.26), given their proximity and good rail links to the airport. These areas are also expected to see an increase in residents working at Gatwick should the second runway be built.\n\nFigure 2.26: Distribution of employment at Gatwick Local authority % Gatwick direct employment No. of employees 2015 No. of additional employees from 2nd runway Wealden 2.5% 525 1575 Lewes 1.8% 378 1134 Eastbourne 1% 210 630\n\nSource: East Sussex County Council (report to Cabinet)\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics (Residents employed by Industry (Air Transport), 2021 Census)\n\nTourism and culture\n\nWith a range of locally and international significant tourism destinations such as the Seven Sisters Country Park, beaches, heritage sites and coastal towns, tourism and cultural industries are an important consideration in planning the future transport provision in East Sussex.\n\nThe 2012-2023 county-wide Cultural Strategy set out three key priorities for East Sussex:\n\nCreate an environment where great cultural experiences are available to everyone to enhance their quality of life.\n\nCreate an environment which enables the cultural and creative economy to expand and enhances our ability to attract and retain other businesses.\n\nDevelop and promote well packaged cultural tourism offers which celebrate the identity of East Sussex, raise its profile and attract more visitors and businesses to the County.\n\nThe strategy noted that those who rely on public transport cannot easily access the County’s cultural offer, particularly young people.\n\nCulture East Sussex (CES) is a network of cultural organisations and individuals that is hosted by East Sussex County Council. It is part of Team East Sussex (TES), a federated board of the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP).\n\nThe priorities of CES are linked to the East Sussex Cultural Strategy (2013-23) and CES will be a key stakeholder in the development of LTP4.\n\nLocal Plans\n\nThe district and borough councils in East Sussex (which include Lewes – Eastbourne, Wealden, Rother & Hastings) are responsible for developing Local Plans in partnership with several key strategic partners, including ESCC. The plans set out the overall vision and objectives for development, including detailed planning policies, specific proposals for development and use of land (including housing and employment) and the numbers and therefore guide planning decisions.\n\nApart from the South Downs National Park Association all the district and borough councils are in the process of reviewing their local plans. Therefore, ESCC will continue to work closely with the district and borough council in the development of the transport evidence base for local plans and to ensure alignment with the East Sussex LTP4.\n\n4. Safety, health and air quality\n\nTransport has a significant impact on safety in our communities and affects the health of individuals through emissions affecting air quality.\n\nThe design of our transport network can contribute to poor health outcomes. For example, the health risks of being overweight and obese can be made worse through an absence of options to walk or cycle resulting in reduced physical activity.\n\nSimilarly, increasing physical activity through active travel has both physical and mental health benefits, including for the prevention and management of long-term conditions. This is especially true for children where incidental physical activity can be critical, but also applies to adults or all ages and abilities.\n\nPublic Health\n\nThe proportion of people in East Sussex who consider themselves to have ‘Very Good Health’ (43.8%) is less than the average across England and Wales (47.1%). However, a higher proportion of people in East Sussex have either ‘Good Health’ or ‘Fair Health’ (Figure 4.1).\n\nGeneral Health by District Geography Very good health Good health Fair health Bad health Very bad health Eastbourne 43% 35% 15% % 1% Hastings 41% 36% 16% 6% 2% Lewes 45% 36% 14% 4% 1% Rother 41% 37% 17% 5% 1% Wealden 48% 35% 13% 4% 1% East Sussex 44% 36% 15% 5% 1% England and Wales 47% 34% 13% 4% 1%\n\nSource: East Sussex in Figures\n\n1,600 people living in Hastings have ‘Very Bad Health’ (1.7%), greater than all other districts and higher than the average for England and Wales (1.3%).

The district of Wealden has the highest proportion of people who are classified as being overweight or obese at 69%.\n\nPercentage of Adults Classified As Overweight Or Obese Geography Percentage Eastbourne 61% Hastings 64% Lewes 62% Rother 67% Wealden 69% East Sussex 65% England 64%\n\nSource: Office for Health improvements and Disparities\n\nFigure 4.4 shows how obesity in children across East Sussex in 2020 was below the average for England (9.2% compared to 9.7% for Reception aged children (4 to 5 years of age)). The same applies for Year 6 students (10 to 11 years of age) with 16.5% in East Sussex compared to 20.4% in England.\n\nObesity in Reception aged children is higher in Eastbourne and Hastings with both at 10.8%, but it is lower than the England average for Year 6 students at 17.8% and 19.1% respectively.\n\nPercentage of Children Classified As Overweight Or Obese Geography Prevalence of obesity in Reception Prevalence of obesity for Year 6 children Eastbourne 11% 18% Hastings 11% 19% Lewes 8% 16% Rother 9% 16% Wealden 8% 14% East Sussex 9% 17% England and Wales 10% 20%\n\nSource: Office for Health improvements and Disparities\n\nParticipation in Walking and Cycling\n\nEncouraging greater amounts of active travel (in place of vehicle travel) can help reduce emissions of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Particulate matter (PM), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) which helps to both tackle climate change and improve air quality. Moreover, walking and cycling can contribute towards economic performance by reducing congestion , improving health & wellbeing and, in some cases, supporting local businesses through increased local spending.\n\nBased on the proportion of people walking or cycling at least three times a week, East Sussex is more active than the average across England (Figure 4.5 and Figure 4.6). Most adults (79%) in East Sussex walk continuously for at least 10 minutes at least once per month (Figure 4.5), with this figure staying more or less similar over the previous six years and is slightly above the national England average of 77%.\n\nIn 2020 the East Sussex Local Cycling & Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) set out an ambitious network of additional cycling and walking routes and measures integrated with existing cycling and walking infrastructure. This seeks to capitalise on the multiple benefits available when more residents have the choice to walk or cycle for more of their journeys.\n\n“The benefits associated with more people walking and cycling are evident. We know that it can improve our physical and mental health and wellbeing, and that it can help to reduce the number of people using vehicles, thereby reducing emissions from exhaust fumes and benefiting the environment. We must also not underestimate the importance that active travel will have in supporting the recovery of the economy. It will achieve this by improving connections for people to access education, training and employment opportunities, alongside creating a healthy more reliable workforce, with individuals benefiting from financial savings arising from not having a need for vehicular travel, as well as supporting future clean growth in housing and employment” (East Sussex Local Cycling & Walking Infrastructure Plan)\n\nProportion of People Walking Geography At least 5 times per week At least 3 times per week At least once per week At least once per month Eastbourne 37 49 73 78 Hastings 37 49 72 79 Lewes 36 49 75 81 Rother 34 44 73 79 Wealden 33 43 72 79 East Sussex 35 46 73 79 England 31 43 70 77\n\nProportion of People Cycling Geography At least 5 times per week At least 3 times per week At least once per week At least once per month Eastbourne 37 49 73 78 Hastings 37 49 72 79 Lewes 36 49 75 81 Rother 34 44 73 79 Wealden 33 43 72 79 East Sussex 35 46 73 79 England 31 43 70 77\n\nSource for proportion of people cycling and walking: Department for Transport (Tables CW0302 and CW0303)\n\nTrends show that the proportion of adults who walk at least three times per week has increased from 43% in 2016 to 46% which is above the national average (43%). Similarly, the number of adults in East Sussex who walk at least five times per week as also increased from 33% in 2016 to 35% in 2021, slightly above the national average of 31%.\n\nThe proportion of adults who cycled for any purpose in 2021 and the proportion of adults in East Sussex who say they cycle has decreased across all frequencies. Although, the number of adults in East Sussex who say they cycle at least once per month increased slightly in 2017 to 15%, the proportion of adults cycling at least once per month decreased to 10% in 2021, below the national average of 13%. Includes cycle rides of any length for leisure, or for travel. Includes some recreational types of cycling such as mountain biking, track cycling, and cyclo-cross. Excludes exercise bikes and cycling indoors.\n\nThe number of adults who say they cycled once per week has decreased from 9% in 2016 to 6% in 2021. Only 1% of adults say they cycle at least five times per week compared to 2% in 2016, below the national average of 2.1%.\n\nFigure 4.6 shows how, at a district level, Lewes has the greatest number of adults who say they cycle at least once per month (15%), but this is still below the national average. Lewes also has the greatest number of adults who say they cycle at least five times per week (2%), slightly above the national average.\n\nCollision Data\n\nRoad collision data for the period between 2015 to 2020 has been provided by the East Sussex County Council Road Safety Team (Table 4.1 and Table 4.2). The data for 2020 includes the Covid-19 restrictions on movement.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, East Sussex had on average over 1,850 casualties from 1,300 collisions, with fewer fatal collisions observed in 2019.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, there were 9,293 casualties reported from 6,657 accidents. Of these casualties, 1% were fatal, 19% serious and 80% slight.\n\nThe Road Safety Team also noted that collisions were evenly split between urban and rural areas, with cluster locations being those where a collisions involves a car. They indicated that crashes typically occur on dry road surfaces when weather conditions are fine, on the assumption of drivers taking less care and increased exposure (fewer drivers in wet and especially icy conditions). There is a trend in crashes occurring at peak times (again on account of exposure). Figure 4.7and Figure 4.8 show that that between 2015 and 2019 there was a downward trend in the numbers of road collisions before the reduction caused by the pandemic.\n\nTable 4.1: road casualties by severity 2015-2020 Year/Severity Fatal Serious Slight 2015 22 329 1,714 2016 24 358 1,500 2017 26 345 1,448 2018 21 334 1,369 2019 14 394 1,295 2020 17 278 1,036 Total 125 2,038 8,462\n\nTable 4.2: road collisions by severity 2015-2020 Year/Severity Fatal Serious Slight 2015 21 291 1,156 2016 23 313 1,038 2017 22 299 1,002 2018 21 303 936 2019 14 351 958 2020 17 245 728 Total 118 1,802 5,818\n\nIn comparison with the whole of England using Road Safety data provided by the Department for Transport, East Sussex has a higher percentage of fatal (East Sussex 2% and England 1%) and serious collisions (East Sussex 24% and England 18%) across the five years.\n\nThe number of collisions involving vulnerable road users including motorcycle users, pedestrians and cyclist also remained high (Figure 4.9). Many of the collisions involving pedestrians affected individuals younger than 15 and over the age of 46.\n\nFigure 4.10, Figure 4.11, Figure 4.12, Figure 4.13 and Figure 4.14 provide a summary of collision data provided by the ESCC Road Safety team showing trends for those involving pedestrians, cyclists, motor vehicles, older people, and children. Each show a trend of reducing slight collisions with reductions in other categories except for older people and children. Both of these groups saw an increasing trend for serious collisions between 2015 and 2019 although both saw fatal collisions fall (albeit based on small absolute numbers). Whilst data for 2020 is included, we cannot draw firm conclusions on the 2020 data set due to the affects of the pandemic on travel and traffic.\n\nAir Quality and Noise Pollution\n\nPoor air quality and high levels of noise affect in particular those most vulnerable - children and the elderly. Poor air quality and noise pollution can discourage people shifting from private cars to walking and cycling, due to a greater exposure to air pollution, in turn decreasing the overall health and quality of life for East Sussex residents (Greater London Authority).\n\nHigher levels of air pollution can be found in urban areas, particularly areas of Bexhill-on-Sea, Hastings, Newhaven, Peacehaven and Uckfield (Figure 4.15) Higher levels of NOx can also be found along major road corridors throughout East Sussex, connecting major towns together (National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory).\n\nIn the UK, local authorities are required to monitor air quality in their area to ensure levels of air pollution are minimised. If an area is not likely to achieve the national air quality objectives, measures must be put in place to improve current conditions.\n\nEast Sussex has two Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs), both within Lewes district; Lewes town centre and the A259 Newhaven ring road and town centre (Figure 4.16). Both AQMAs have been declared due high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollutants.\n\nThe Sussex Air Quality Monitoring Network provides a central source of information on air pollution issues of a defined and robust quality and can be used with confidence by members of the public, researchers and local authority officers.\n\nNoise pollution is also a key issue in areas around major highway routes and in some urban areas such as Eastbourne. It is estimated that the annual social cost of urban road noise in England is £7 to £10 billion (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).\n\nBased on the strategic noise maps produced under the Environmental Noise (England) Regulations, 2006, noise important areas are identified for roads and railways. Important areas (IAs) are hotspots where the highest 1% of noise levels occur in residential locations.\n\nFigure 4.17 shows the extent of this issue compared to major routes such as the M20 between London and Dover. Highways in East Sussex with a particular need to consider the noise from vehicles include the A21, A22, and A27, and A259 (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).\n\nSource: National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory\n\nSource: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\nSource: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\n\nCommunity and Sense of Place\n\nTransport links are fundamental to maintaining and cultivating community ties. Services and local transport infrastructure such as railway stations and bus interchanges can also act as community hubs with a strong sense of place, becoming sources of local pride.\n\nThe East Sussex County Council Plan highlights the need to put people first when providing services and encourages communities and individuals to develop and maintain community ties and support systems.\n\nPlace shaping has an important role in ensuring the physical and mental health and wellbeing of East Sussex communities. Transport policies and schemes should help to create environments which are health promoting and encourage healthy lifestyles, reducing health inequalities.\n\nPlaces should be well designed, attractive, safe and inclusive, and should improve connectivity and walkability, reduce social isolation and improve community cohesion. The highway and associated public realm can support social cohesion through avoiding barriers and severance and creating places for people to meet.\n\nAlso places should adapt to a rise of temperatures and severe weather events from climate change caused by all emissions released before net zero is achieved by 2050. For example, maintaining the provision of street trees ,which along with other urban greening measures, can provide cooling shade in hot weather, absorb carbon emissions from the atmosphere, absorb excessive rainwater as well as also benefit mental wellbeing.\n\nStage 1 – Policy Review for East Sussex’s Fourth Local Transport Plan\n\nDevelopment of East Sussex’s Fourth Local Transport Plan (LTP4) is informed by an understanding of existing legislation and policy priorities. To ensure effective alignment with current and future ambitions, a review was undertaken of the existing policy landscape, across national, regional, and local government. Policy priorities that were identified as a result of this process form the framework of the LTP. Analysis of the policy landscape led to the creation of seven key themes for the LTP, organised along three thematic areas, spanning social, economic, and environmental spheres as set out below.\n\nOur People\n\n1. Accessibility, equity, and social inclusion\n\n2. Safety, health, and air quality\n\n3. Community and sense of place\n\nOur Natural and Built Environment\n\n4. Climate change and its impacts\n\n5. Our local environment and biodiversity\n\nOur Growth\n\n6. Sustainable economic development\n\n7. Innovation through technology\n\nThe policy review process allows for a general understanding of East Sussex’s position and ambition demonstrated through the documents outlined in the summaries of reviewed national policy and strategy documents, below.\n\nThis includes the type and scale of policy ambition, existing initiatives across policy sectors and how they may interact to deliver tangible outcomes on the ground. Priorities can be identified across local, regional, and national levels, showing how patterns of ambition and commitment vary across levels of government. The summaries of reviewed national policy and strategy documents, below outlines all the national, regional and local policy documents reviewed as part of the evidence base for this LTP. Short summaries are provided for each policy document, indicating key and relevant points for East Sussex and the LTP, where appropriate.\n\nTables 1, 2 and 3 outline how each policy document integrates into the thematic structure presented above, and highlights where policy documents cover transport related themes generally as . transport can be a key enabler or barrier for addressing issues highlighted in the themes.\n\nSummaries of reviewed national policy and strategy documents\n\nDecarbonising Transport: A Better Green Britain (2021), Department for Transport\n\nRelationship: Transport – All modes\n\nSets out path to achieving a net zero transportation system in the UK, and the commitments and actions needed to get there.

The document sets out new design guidance and higher quality and safety requirements to deliver a ‘gear change’ in active travel infrastructure. Gear Change will inform the design of active travel infrastructure identified in the East Sussex Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan (LCWIP) adopted by the County Council in September 2021.\n\nThe Second Cycling and Walking Investment Strategy (CWIS2) (2021), Department for Transport Active Travel England\n\nRelationship: Transport – Active Travel\n\nCWIS2 builds upon the foundations established in CWIS (2017), updating the strategy in line with advancements in policy, as well as the socioeconomic changes brought about by the pandemic. CWIS2 sets out objectives and financial resources for the period 2021-2025. Headline objectives include increasing the number of short journeys in towns and cities done undertaken by active modes from 41% in 2018/19 to 46% in 2025, and doubling cycling activity by 2025, from a 2013 baseline.\n\nFlightpath to the Future: A Strategic Framework for the Aviation Sector (2022), Department for Transport\n\nRelationship: Transport - Aviation\n\nThis strategy aims to boost the UK’s aviation sector in light of the Covid-19 recovery and a move towards sustainable technologies. A ten-point plan underlines the Government’s commitment to growth in the sector. While East Sussex is not home to any major airports, recovery and growth at nearby Gatwick could affect traffic movements in adjacent areas of the county.\n\nBus Back Better (2021), Department for Transport\n\nRelationship: Transport - Bus\n\nThe national bus strategy sets out priorities for how this mode of transport can be used as a tool for Covid-19 recovery, implementing the Levelling Up agenda and meeting decarbonisation targets. Local authorities are required to develop Bus Service Improvement Plans (BSIP) for their areas to enable funding to be secured and the current East Sussex BSIP was approved in October 2021. East Sussex BSIP secured £41.4m of funding to deliver both improvements to infrastructure and services and will be reviewed as part of the review of East Sussex LTP, alongside inclusion in the implementation plan and identifying links with other supporting plans including the East Sussex Local Cycling & Walking Infrastructure Plan. .\n\nStrategic Business Plan (2020), National Highways\n\nRelationship: Transport - Road\n\nA document responding to the Road Investment Strategy, providing high-level direction for all parts of Highways England (now National Highways).

One of its twelve focus areas or ‘missions’ is transport infrastructure.\n\nNational Planning Policy Framework (2021), Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government\n\nRelationship: Economy and Planning\n\nThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPFPF) sets out the government’s planning policies for England and how they should be applied. Specific planning approaches are laid out across transport and related sectors, from promoting sustainable transport to making effective use of land and building a competitive economy. The NPFF NPPF must be considered when preparing any development plans.\n\nPlanning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act (1990), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Planning and Environment\n\nThe Act provides controls for the demolition, alteration or extension of buildings, objects, or structures of particular architectural or historic interest including listed buildings and conservation areas. Location of Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas are included as part of the Integrated Impact Assessment baseline and impacts on them will be considered.\n\nAncient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act (1979),HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Planning and Environment\n\nProvides protection for ‘Scheduled’ Ancient Monuments and makes provision for the investigation, preservation and recording of matters of archaeological or historical interest. The Integrated Impact Assessment identifies Monuments that are Scheduled under the Act and will consider any impacts of the Local Transport Plan on them, in addition to potential for archaeology.\n\nNature Positive 2030 (2021), Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, NatureScot, Northern Ireland Environment Agency\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nFollowing on from global commitments for nature, including to protect 30% of our land and seas by 2030; five statutory nature conservation bodies set out how the UK can achieve these commitments, ensuring nature recovery plays a critical role in achieving net zero.\n\nNet Zero Strategy: Build Back Greener (2021), HM Government\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nA long-term strategy that sets out policies and priorities for achieving a decarbonised economy by 2050. It sets out key commitments from greening the transport sector, including a zero-emission vehicle mandate to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 which will need to be considered in particular as part of our Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Strategy.\n\nUK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA3) and Transport Sector Briefing (2021), HM Government\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThe Climate Change Risk Assessment is required under the Climate Change Act and sets out risks and opportunities for the UK from climate change. For transport, there are a number of risk areas which require mitigating action going forward. These include addressing risk to infrastructure from cascading failures, risks from slope and embankment failure, high and low temperatures, high winds and lightning, as well as flooding.\n\nClean Air Strategy (2019), Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThis strategy sets out a comprehensive action plan for all parts of government and society to tackle air pollution and control major sources of air pollution. Relevant transport objectives are set out for all polluting modes.\n\nNet Zero: The UK’s contribution to stopping global warming (2019), Climate Change Committee\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nA document setting out a high-level path for achieving ‘net zero’ in the UK. Transport-related strategic priorities include switching shifting to sustainable travel, and widespread electrification across transport modes.\n\nA Green Future: 25 Year Environment Plan (2018), HM Government\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThis strategy sets out the Government’s action plan to help the natural world regain and retain good health. It aims to deliver cleaner air and water while cultivating richer wildlife habitats. The future of mobility is identified as one of the key challenges with target priorities set our decarbonisation and encouraging new technologies and modes of transport.\n\nOur Waste, Our Resources: A Strategy for England (2018), HM Government\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThis strategy sets out how Government will preserve material resources by minimising waste, promoting resource efficiency, and moving towards a circular economy in England.\n\nClean Growth Strategy (2017), HM Government\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThe Clean Growth Strategy aims to balance the UK’s economic growth with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Accelerating the shift to low carbon transport is identified as one of the key policy priority areas, with fixed targets and funding set out to carry out decarbonisation across a range of transport modes.\n\nUK Plan for Tackling Roadside Nitrogen Dioxide Concentrations (2017), Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThe effort to reduce NO2 needs to be targeted on the sources that make the biggest contribution to the problem: road vehicles contribute about 80% of NO2 pollution at the roadside and growth in the number of diesel cars has exacerbated this problem. In developing their local plans to tackle the causes of air pollution, local authorities should consider a range of options from improved technology to limiting access.\n\nThe Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThe Regulations designate and protect sites for the conservation of natural habitats, wild flora and fauna and wild birds under previous European Directives and implement aspects of the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (below). It requires several stages of assessment to be undertaken where a plan or project may affect designated sites. This document will be considered as part of the development of the Integrated Impact Assessment, which will combine several sustainability appraisal processes, so that environmental and social impacts are identified and mitigated as part of the development of the East Sussex LTP4.\n\nThe Water Environment Water Framework Directive Regulations (2017), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThese Regulations make provision for implementing water-related environmental protection and more generally water management. They include identification of river basin districts, characterisation, and classification of the status of water bodies in those districts and specifies measures that must be included in a programme of measures to protect the quality of the water. This document will be considered as part of the development of the Integrated Impact Assessment, which will combine several sustainability appraisal processes, so that environmental and social impacts are identified and mitigated as part of the development of the East Sussex LTP4.\n\nSafeguarding our Soils – A Strategy for England (2011), Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nSets a vision for managing soils sustainably and tackling degradation by 2030. Recognises the important ecosystem services soils provide and need to strengthen protection and their resilience to climate change. Key areas include better protection for agricultural soils; protecting and enhancing stores of soil carbon; building the resilience of soils to a changing climate; preventing soil pollution; effective soil protection during construction; and dealing with contaminated land.\n\nWaste Regulations for England and Wales (2011), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThese regulations set out requirements for the collection, transport, recovery, and disposal of waste. They adopt a waste hierarchy, which gives priority to preventing waste in the first place, preparing it for re-use, then recycling, recovery, and last of allfinally disposals.\n\nClimate Change Act (2008), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nSets targets for UK greenhouse gas emission reductions of at least 100% by 2050, against a 1990 baseline (this was previously 80% but was updated to a net zero target in June 2019). The Act also provides a system of carbon budgeting and the development of a National Adaptation Programme.\n\nNatural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2006), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nIncludes a list of species and types of habitats which are of principal importance for conserving biodiversity (Priority Species and Habitats).\n\nCountryside and Rights of Way Act (2000), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThe Countryside and Rights of Way Act normally gives a public right of access to land mapped as ‘open country’ or registered common land. ‘Open access land’ often includes parts of the coastal margin used to create England’s Coast Path. The development of East Sussex’s LTP4 will ensure alignment with the East Sussex Rights of Way Improvement Plan, which is currently being updated.\n\nWildlife Countryside Act (1981), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Environment\n\nThe primary legislation for protection of species and habitats in the UK. It gives protection to native species; controls release of non-native species and protects Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The development of East Sussex’s LTP4 will ensure alignment with the East Sussex Rights of Way Improvement Plan, which is currently being updated\n\nPublic Health England Strategy 2020-2025 (2020), Public Health England\n\nRelationship: Social and Health\n\nAn outline of priorities to protect people and help people live longer in good health. It sets out aims around keeping people safe, preventing poor health, narrowing the health gap, and supporting a strong economy. The East Sussex LTP4 will be underpinned by several the key priorities set out in this document alongside those similarly outlined in local public health strategies, including the East Sussex - Healthy lives, healthy people: East Sussex Health and Wellbeing Board Strategy, East Sussex Whole-System Healthy Weight Plan 2021-2026 (2021), and the East Sussex Health and Social Care Plan (2020).\n\nNHS Long Term Plan (2019), National Health Service\n\nRelationship: Social and Health\n\nThis plan constitutes a long-term strategy for the NHS, with a number of key priorities including new service models, funding settlements, care quality, workforce pressures and new technologies. It recognises the opportunities bought about by the uptake of public transport and active travel in both preventing and treating numerous illnesses and consequential positive impacts on the NHS. The decarbonisation of transport additionally constitutes an integral element of health and social care, comprising a proportion of the carbon footprint of health and social care. This has reduced 19% since 2007, but remains a challenge in delivering the Climate Change Act target of 34% by 2020 and 51% by 2025. The East Sussex LTP4 will be underpinned by several the key priorities set out in this document alongside those similarly outlined in local public health strategies, including the East Sussex - Healthy lives, healthy people: East Sussex Health and Wellbeing Board Strategy, East Sussex Whole-System Healthy Weight Plan 2021-2026 (2021), and the East Sussex Health and Social Care Plan (2020).\n\nChildhood Obesity Strategy (2016), HM Government\n\nRelationship: Social and Health\n\nThis strategy provides a plan for action in relation to the challenge of childhood obesity, of which around 1/3 of children aged 2-15 are overweight or obese. The impacts of obesity are great, particularly on the NHS, and disproportionately impacting children from low-income backgrounds. Calls for action relate to nutrition and diet, but of note include an ambition to help all children enjoy an hour of physical activity every day and improving the quality of sport and physical activity programmes for schools. It recognises the importance of walking and cycling in enabling physical exercise, particularly as a means to travel to and from school. It presents the government’s commitments to children walking and cycling, with targets to increase the number of children walking to school, alongside continued support for Bikeability cycle training. The East Sussex LTP4 will reflect a number of the calls for action especially in relation to transport, alongside the more localised strategy, the East Sussex Whole-System Healthy Weight Plan 2021-2026 (2021). This will also have an influence on the review of County’s Council Local Cycling and Walking Infrastructure Plan.\n\nEverybody Active, Every Day (2014), Public Health England\n\nRelationship: Social and Health\n\nAn evidence-based approach to support sectors to better embed physical activity into daily life, making it a normal choice within communities across England. The framework was co-produced with a variety of national and local leaders in physical activity and acts as a call for action from providers and commissioners working across most public and private sectors. Its 4 areas for action focus on changing the social norm of physical activity, improve expertise and leadership, create physical activity-friendly environments and to identify and up-scale programmes with good levels of success.\n\nPhysical Activity: Walking and Cycling – Public health guideline PH41 (2012), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\n\nRelationship: Social and Health\n\nProvides guidance on encouraging people to increase their levels of walking and cycling, for travel and recreation purposes. Recommendations cover policy and planning, local programmes alongside promotion within schools, workplaces, and the NHS. It presents a set of holistic recommendations for walking and cycling, data on the public health need and further considerations impacting levels of walking and cycling .The holistic recommendations will be reflected in the development of the East Sussex LTP4 but will also influence the review of the East Sussex LCWIP.\n\nEqualities Act (2010), HM Government Legislation\n\nRelationship: Social and Health\n\nThis Act includes a public-sector equality duty which requires public organisations and those delivering public functions to show due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination, harassment, victimisation; to advance equality of opportunity; and to foster good relations between communities. The act identifies eight protected characteristic groups (including age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation) and the Council must ensure that new policies and actions do not cause disproportionate negative impacts on any of these groups. The review of the East Sussex LTP4 will be underpinned by inclusivity, and this will be reflected through policy development and transport scheme and initiative identification and delivery. To support this an Equalities Impact Assessment will be developed and reviewed regularly. This will also influence accompanying strategies including the East Sussex LCWIP, BSIP and EV Charging Infrastructure.\n\nSummaries of reviewed regional policy and strategy documents\n\nFuture Mobility Strategy (2022), Transport for the South East\n\nRelationship: Transport – All Modes\n\nThis strategy sets out a vision for future mobility, taking a lead from the 2050 vision set out in the Transport for the South East’s Transport Strategy. It is expected that, through actions outlined in this document, the South East will have a globally leading sustainable mobility ecosystem, driving the shift the net zero. Strategic objectives are set out to meet this vision. They include the prioritisation of active modes as first choice for local journeys, the development of zero emissions mass transit, integration of passenger and freight transport networks, people-central and accessible transport, and universal digital connectivity.\n\nGatwick Surface Access Strategy (2022), Gatwick Airport\n\nRelationship: Transport – All Modes\n\nThis strategy sets out an eight-year sustainable surface access vision for Gatwick Airport Limited (GAL), setting new targets for sustainable travel mode share to the airport. These include an aim to achieve 52% public transport mode share for passenger coming to the airport by 2030, and 48% sustainable travel mode share for staff journeys. The review of the East Sussex LTP4 will reflect the need to continue to work in partnership with GAL to support sustainable travel options in accessing the airport.\n\nStrategic Investment Plan (SIP) (2023), Transport for the South East\n\nRelationship: Economy and Planning\n\nThe Strategic Investment Plan, adopted in March 2023, provides a framework for investment in strategic transport infrastructure, services, and regulatory interventions for the next thirty years. Interventions outlined throughout the plan seek to address – decarbonisation, adapting to a new post-Covid normal, levelling up left behind communities, facilitating regeneration and growth, delivering world class urban transport systems, transforming east-to-west connectivity, developing resilient radial transport corridors, and enhancing existing global gateways and freight.
