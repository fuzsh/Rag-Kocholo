        "text": "Newhaven Marine railway station was a station in Newhaven, East Sussex, England near Newhaven Harbour. It is legally open, but has been closed to passengers since August 2006 due to safety concerns. The station has been a site of fascination due to the operation of 'ghost train' services to the station which do not appear in timetables and which are inaccessible to the public but which nonetheless call at the station once a day in order to fulfill the legal obligations of an 'open' station.\n\nIn May 2018, it was revealed that the station is being considered for a legal closure as part of plans to improve freight connectivity in the area.\n\nSource\n\nSource: Wikipedia.org\n\nCopyright: Creative Commons 3.0\n\nMore information\n\nStatistics\n\n| | Public"
