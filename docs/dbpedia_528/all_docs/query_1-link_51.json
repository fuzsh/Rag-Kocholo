The town is known for being a major access point to the English Channel and the French side, thanks to ferry services which transport passengers to Dieppe in France. Newhaven was originally known as Meeching in Saxon times when a village was established about 480AD. The current ferry port began after a shingle sput blocked a river outflow at Seaford so a channel was made in the 16th century, which led to a sheltered harbour in Newhaven. The modern town today has a respectable mix of shops with residential areas mainly on the western side of the river at Mount Pleasant and Denton with newer homes built in Harbour Heights, August Fields and West Quay. Industrial sites are on the eastern side and there are three railway stations: Newhaven Harbour, Newhaven Town and Newhaven Marine (no longer used).\n\nNewhaven has two schools for secondary pupils in the town. UTC @Harbourside [UTC meaning University Technical College], which opened for teenagers aged 14 to 18 in September 2014, with a focus on science, technology and practical trades such as plumbing. Seahaven Academy is the other secondary school with some 850 pupils aged 11 to 16. Primary schools in Newhaven number four in total: Newhaven Academy, Meeching Valley, Denton Community Primary and Harbour Primary. Pupils in general are able to access some fantastic learning sites in the town, not only with Newhaven Fort present, but also the Newhaven Local & Maritime Museum, Sussex History Trail and Plant Earth Museum.\n\nNewhaven is well-known for the ferry service across the English Channel. There are other strong travel links, with the town being at the southern part of the A26, as a trunk road that goes cross country from Maidstone, before lining with the A259 coastal route, which runs from Eastbourne to Brighton. The town of Newhaven is also based within the Seaford railway line, from Seaford to Lewes, with two railway stations for convenience: Newhaven Harbour and Newhaven Town. There used to be a specific railway station for the ferry terminal, which was unused. For those who enjoy a long walk, Newhaven hosts the end of the Vanguard Way, which starts in Croydon.\n\nNewhaven’s ferry port, as noted above, is widely known to travellers seeking a reliable route to the continent. Ferries take passengers, on foot and with vehicles, to the intriguing port of Dieppe in Seine-Maritime, and if they’re fortunate to go on a saturday, there’s an opportunity to visit a wonderful fresh produce market in the French town. DFDS Seaways runs the ferry service, which can be booked online. Rail passengers go to Newhaven Town Railway Station where there’s a bus for the ferry terminal.\n\nGary the Newhaven, BN9 chimney sweep homepage"
