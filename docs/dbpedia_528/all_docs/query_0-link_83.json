        "text": "Dear Paul, Thanks for the information. I have a picture of the down boat train so I was almost certain of the code but didn't know there were possible two routes and codes. I've found photos of the signal number plates by the way, so that's on my 'to do' list as well.\n\nI did hear that there was a second box at Newhaven town. It was at the north end of the yard.\n\nAll the best.\n\nColin\n\nThere were a total of four boxes around Newhaven.\n\nStarting from the north was Newhaven Town North which was a LBSCR Type 3b design box which had 37 levers and opened in April 1917 being abolished 9th January 1934. This controlled sidings on the up and down sides. The structure was renovated and bought back into use with a new 28 lever frame now known as Newhaven Town A on 20th March 1940 and lasted until 6th March 1955. Opening hours in 1920 were 0930-1730 weekdays (which at the time included Saturday) and closed on Sunday.\n\nNext box 1021 yards southwards was Newhaven Town opened by 1872. This was replaced in 1879 by the present structure (a Saxby & Farmer type 5) initially with 24 levers. This was increased to 34 levers in 1895 and 41 levers in 1917. 1917 also saw the box renamed to Newhaven Town South from April 4th following the opening of the North box. It is situated at Newhaven Town station and controlled the level crossing and the other end of the up and down sidings. Further renaming took place in February 1940 to Newhaven Town B then in March 1955 (with closure of North box) it became Newhaven Town again. A replacement 40 lever frame was also fitted in 1953. This box remains open (signal prefix is 'CCO'). 1920 opening hours were always open.\n\nA further 663 yards to the south was Newhaven Harbour North in 1886 which was a 25 lever box (also to Saxby & Farmer type 5 design) lasting until January 10th 1920. This controlled some siding connections at the north end of Newhaven Harbour station. Opening hours in 1920 were 0600-2200 weekdays and closed on Sundays.\n\nThe main box at Newhaven Harbour was opened in 1864/65 (to Saxby & Farmer type 1b design) being renamed Newhaven Harbour South in 1886 with the opening of the North box. At the same time a replacement box (another Saxby & Farmer type 5) with 42 levers was opened. It reverted to Newhaven Harbour on closure of the North box in January 1920. Situated at the junction with the Bishopstone/ Seaford line and between the Harbour and Marine (originally known as 'Newhaven Continental') stations this box remains in use today as Newhaven Harbour with signals prefixed as 'NH'. It is situated 358 yards from Harbour North box or 1021 yards from Town South box. In 1920 the box was always open.\n\nOn the Seaford line was Bishopstone box. This was 1302 yards from Newhaven Harbour South box and had been opened by 1872. A LBSCR type 2b box was provided from 1894 fitted with an 18 lever frame to control the level crossing and the station sidings. A replacement 18 lever frame was provided in 1904. Th box was abolished on 1st August 1922 although from 1917 it had only been open as required for shunting.\n\nThe final Newhaven signalling structure to consider was not a block post- being a 18 lever ground frame controlling connections at the far end of Newhaven Marine station. Known as Newhaven Harbour South GF it was in use from 1892 until 24th August 1936. It is not known whether this GF was open or contained within a structure or whether it was only open as required or had permanent staff.\n\nThere is also another box known as Newhaven Wharf which was in use 'by 1872' until May 17th 1886. No other details are given.\n\nDetails are taken from two Signalling Record Society publications:\n\nSignal Box Register Volume 4: Southern Railway (SRS 2009)\n\nLB&SCR: Signalboxes in 1920-1922. Part 2-East of the London and Brighton Line (SRS 1995). This book (one of four parts)is a collection of signalbox diagrams taken from the J.M.Wagstaff collection and has much to interest the Southern signalling enthusiast. The diagrams featuring London Bridge and its approaches (and Brighton too) are worthy of a second closer study!\n\nThe area was also covered in one of the Track Layout Diagrams (not the Signalling Diagrams) of the Southern Railway and Southern Region by George Pryer. This series shows the development of the railway in detail (up until the mid 1970s) showing the full track layout including sidings etc although coverage of the system is limited to essentially ex-LSWR and Hampshire/Sussex areas. Off hand I am not sure which volume featured Newhaven but it is well worth getting a copy if you can manage to find one. The Southern ones are sadly long out of print and fairly elusive (much more so than the companion GWR series by RACooke which are currently being updated and reissued by Lightmoor Press) The NRM does have a complete set of them I believe.\n\nHopefully the above is of some interest and sorry to go on at length! Excellent layout by the way- oozes much Southern atmosphere. The appearance of more Southern layouts- especially electric ones is to be welcomed. I am following your topic with much interest!\n\nNewhaven North/A Signal box survived for a long time after closure (1960s?). It is pictured in the Middleton Horsted Keynes - Seaford book. Just to the right of it in the distance can be seen a building used in the Second World War for doing work on aircraft engines. The steelwork of this stood for many years afterwards (1970s?).\n\n2-BILs:\n\nThese were BUILT in batches to increase stock numbers as newly-electrified lines were finished, hence the erroneous view that they were always used on these lines.\n\nThese two articles have more:\n\nSR semi-fast units 2NOL 4LAV 2BIL and 2HAL\n\n2 BIL\n\nA few quotes from the above:\n\n\"In practice, all of these units, together with 2001-2010, became common-user across the South Western and Central divisions.\"\n\n\"The Portsmouth No.1 2Bil units differed from the Eastbourne lot in having a larger guard's van...provided by providing a coupe'(sic) compartment next to the van.\"\n\n( i.e. a compartment with a door & one window. These were very odd to be in - seats on one side facing a partition.)\n\n\"...most of the 2Bil and 2Hal units were withdrawn from passenger traffic in 1969-1971. The last in passenger traffic were 2695/98/99, withdrawn in July 1971.\"\n\nMotorail/new car flat wagons:\n\nThe earlier ones were on ex-GWR, LMS and LNER coach underframes:\n\nGWR - D1/131 1964-5, D1/088 1967\n\nLMS - D1/129 1965, D1/132 1966\n\nLNER - D1/088, D1/129 1964\n\nThe later ones were BR Mk1s:\n\nD1/131 1970-1, D1/177 1972-4, D1/189 1969-70\n\nHere are a couple of pictures (not at Newhaven):\n\nCar train\n\nCar trains at Luton\n\nMotorail Poster\n\nTimetable (Days) for Newhaven - Glasgow Motorail service, 1964; the photo isn't at Newhaven - it's somewhere in London.\n\nSome of the \"related images\" on this page are interesting e.g. BR containers:\n\nsaid to be Rotterdam, appear to be on BR Conflats.\n\nA few of the early car flats were still about in 1990, plus quite a lot of the later ones.\n\nI do vaguely remember the Simca site, but presumably the actual Motorail trains used the sidings behind Newhaven Harbour station - see below.\n\nHere, there are some photos:\n\nwww.30937.co.uk\n\nThis is a huge page (4.7MB) and takes ages to load, being a list of 10,420 photos in DATE order.\n\nIncludes various British, European (inc. Brittany Metre gauge), India and Africa (inc EAR NG) etc.\n\nNB only click once on a photo link.\n\nThe site is searchable at:\n\nSearch\n\nDon't bother looking at the FAQs page.\n\nThese are the Newhaven ones (all 1966):\n\nHigh level view - from a crane?\n\nShows a \"GONDRAND\" lorry trailer.\n\nGondrand Freres, and TOE - Transports d'ouest European(?) were perhaps the Norbert Dentressangle and Giraud of their day (well in Newhaven). They both had offices in flat-roofed buildings in Transit Road, just before it turned to join Railway Road.\n\nNewhaven Harbour\n\n- the wet one. RAF Newhaven(may have just had a number) behind the BR tug \"Meeching\" with an RAF air-sea rescue boat in the centre.\n\nSwiss lorry on ferry link span\n\nContainer moving\n\nLooking down on \"Falaise\"\n\nLooking down on \"Falaise\" - sailing\n\nContainer storage area & station\n\nShows (L to R) Bucket dredger \"Foremost Prince\"(?), containers, possibly the Motorail terminal - the LH siding has a platform and a ramp(?) - or were cars unloaded off the side at one end(?), long line of vans and the station \"buildings\" behind the up platform\n\nView from signal box - departing rear of boat train\n\nView from signal box with \"Hornby\" 20003\n\nNewhaven Town:\n\n32424 at Newhaven shed\n\nView from Town signal box\n\n- shows goods relief line and spur with shunter (behind the lower steps of footbridge).\n\nNot Newhaven at all:\n\nBridge over Llanrhystyd road at Aberystwyth\n\nCattle van, Aberystwyth Ditto, but nearby - how not to park a cattle wagon.\n\nBarry\n\nCouple of slight edits to correct typos.\n\nAt last! We seem to be back in business. Here are a couple of shots:\n\nThis first one shows the newly re-numbered 08, now 152 and not 220 any more. It is next to a few Dogfish. The one next to the loco is a 'slag-ballast' conversion, possibly later than the layout's time period, but it breaks the monotony. These Dogfish are by Cambrian, I do have a couple of Heljan ones too.\n\nThis shot shows two Dogfish in close-up, both these and the slag ballast one have the flared side chutes which ensured that their load fell past the third rail. This variation of the chutes was designed for use on the Southern Region of course. I will not swear as to the running numbers being exactly correct for each individual wagon. I'm sure that if anyone knows, it will be Karabuni!\n\nPaul Bartlett's website has been essential in getting the general 'look' correct for all my wagons.\n\nI thank all of you re. car trains by the way. I don't think I'll go down that road(!). I think the trick on a small layout is not to have any thing too big. Those trains would never fit the space that I have on the traverser, which is only 43.5 \" long, (1 x 4 CEP = 42\" - that's the limit!).\n\nI have dug out some interesting pictures of what befell two banana vans. Amazingly, both van bodies are within ten miles of my home. The fiirst one shows a van body similar to the Ratio kit. The end vent is a crude addition by the farmer, who hacked through the ends with a chainsaw. The cork insulation is also showing where the end planking is damaged. Look at the vertical planking. It's made up from different widths and looks as though the builder was running out of wide boards! You'd never get away with that on a model!!!! The yellow spot marking is just visible and very faded. This body is still in use today as a feed store in a field near the Falcondale Hotel Lampeter Ceredigion. A picture of this van was first featured in the Railway Modeller letters pages. I did not say in that letter that vans were often scrapped on site where they broke down etc. - editorial licence! There is also a BR Insulated van body in the area, still in its faded white livery. There are so many van bodies around here- they can't have all been scrapped in the locality. Nearly every farm around here has at least one grounded van body. It would make an interesting photographic field trip for somebody. This next photo is the most amazing coincidence, considering that I was already intent on building Newhaven Harbour and running banana vans on the layout at the time I found this next body! It is of the standard BR design, diagram 246 Lot3225. The running number is almost legible as B882?44 - the fourth digit being weathered away. The van is painted in the darker shade of freight brown. The original bauxite was showing through in places. This van is located on a lane near Bwlch-y-Llan Lampeter Ceredigion. It was used as a children's den - very cosy with 3\" of cork insulation! That door frame timber is made from a piece of 5\" square oak. The doors on these vans were really of heavy construction. This accounts for the extra hinges and the strengthened door frames.\n\n*I've edited the details of the Standard Banana van body number - my memory played a trick on me. The diagram and added Lot no. are now correct to Karabuni's information on this.\n\nI'm posting a few shots of the 4 CEP on its way from the station out to the area of the layout by the substation.\n\nThis first shot shows the unit leaving Platform 1 with what could be called the up boat train. From all the information that I have received, the boat trains from Newhaven Marine consisted of just the one unit in the finals days of the service. This suits me fine! In the first posting I had said that I couldn't fit in the boat trains. Well, thanks to you at RMweb - I found that I could!\n\nThe loco in the background, 73 128 has since received matt black painted cab roofs. I am gathering up the courage to do away with the high-intensity lights on the cab fronts - this will involve a bit of careful slicing, filing and re-painting. Pics to follow.\n\nThe next view shows the train in the same position but from the front, proudly displaying the correct headcode - please note! (With thanks to Oldddudders for the headcode info).\n\nThis next veiw is of the 4 CEP passing the outer home signal. This view is very reminiscient of the Ouse valley in which the real railway runs.\n\nIt's very flat and there are many culverts and drains like the one in the foreground.\n\nI have fitted this Bachmann unit with a DCC decoder. It runs fantastically well and looks exactly as it should, if not a bit clean. When the weather gets warmer, I shall be giving it a bit of weathering to tone it down. I did break off numerous parts whilst getting the body off to fit the decoder, which was unfortunate. Why the body is so securely clipped on is a mystery to me.\n\nIf only the traverser was longer I would buy another one!"
