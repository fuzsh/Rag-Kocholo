Diff)\n\nDr. Benjamin Havemann, a gastroenterologist with Austin Gastro, explains this increasingly common bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the colon (colitis), and sometimes severe diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and death if not treated quickly. C. diff has evolved and has become very hard to treat and is an infection that can easily recur. C. diff is sometimes triggered by using antibiotics which causes the loss of healthy bacteria in the digestive system, allowing the growth of this unhealthy and aggressive bacterial infection. A new and very successful treatment option for C. diff is called Fecal Microbiota Transplant, which involves the transplantation of fecal bacteria from a healthy individual into the colon of the recipient, and allows for the restoration of healthy flora through a variety of modalities. FMT has proven to be a very effective treatment option for these patients.\n\nDr. Cox at COPE in Southlake, TX Introduction\n\nMeet Dr. Cox!

ERCP is both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool that enables your physician to examine the pancreatic and bile ducts. It is diagnostic in that it allows the physician to see the narrowing caused by the tumor in the pancreas and even take a biopsy of the tumor.

Pylori infections can result in conditions such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and lymphoma of the stomach. Common symptoms range from no symptoms at all to abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, lack of appetite, or bloody/black stool. There are invasive and non-invasive ways to diagnose H. Pylori. The non-invasive ways include H. Pylori breath test, stool samples, and blood test. Another way to diagnose H. Pylori is upper endoscopy with biopsy of the stomach lining to detect this bacteria. Treatment often includes multiple antibiotics and an acid blocker, followed up with testing to ensure that the treatment has effectively killed all of the H. Pylori bacteria. Reinfection can occur, but is rare once effectively treated.\n\nDr. Robert Frachtman with Austin Gastro on Celiac Disease\n\nDr. Robert Frachtman explains what Celiac Disease is and how it differs from gluten sensitivity.

GI Alliance will be a thought leader and an advocate of progress in the gastroenterology community nationwide.” “IGG is one of the most well-respected GI organizations in the country,” said Dr. Jim Weber, CEO of GI Alliance. “We are honored to have a practice of IGG’s size and repute join GIA in our mission to build the premier national GI platform for patients seeking dependable, high-quality care.” As of the closing of the transaction, GIA has partnered with IGG’s clinical practice entity.

If the bowel prep isn’t up to par, polyps and lesions can be missed; the colonoscopy may take longer (increasing the risk of complications); or the whole process may need to be repeated or rescheduled, meaning another round of bowel prep.

The recommended age to begin screening was lowered to age 45 from age 50 because colon cancer has been occurring in younger and younger age groups. Colon cancer is one of the most preventable cancers, yet it is still 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. A colonoscopy can detect and remove colon polyps BEFORE they have time to develop into colon cancer. Colon cancer prevention starts with screening.\n\nAustin Gastro's Northwest Clinic: An Aerial View\n\nAustin Gastro's Northwest Clinic is located at 8015 Shoal Creek Boulevard in Suite 118, which is located in the back left corner of the complex.

He enjoys the variety of diseases, and the balance of treating both gastrointestinal emergencies such as GI bleeding in the hospital, as well as treating patients with chronic conditions such as eosinophillic esophagitis, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis.\n\nDr. Karthik Garapati Shares Concerns About Delaying Colonoscopies During Pandemic\n\nDr. karthik Garapati shares his concerns about people delaying their colonoscopies during the pandemic. He is concerned that many preventable cancers will have been missed, and that colon cancers will be detected at later stages, making it harder to treat. Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the United States. It is also one of the most treatable cancers when detected early. It is also one of the only cancers that is preventable. Screening colonoscopies can detect and remove pre-cancerous polyps before they have time to develop into colon cancer.\n\nDr. Parastoo Jangouk on Rectal Bleeding\n\nDr. Parastoo Jangouk of Austin Gastroenterology explains why rectal bleeding is never normal and should always be considered an “alarm symptom” requiring timely medical attention. Most of the time the causes of rectal bleeding are benign in nature, but still need to be treated by a physician, and colorectal cancer should be ruled out.\n\nDr. Shiv Desai on Doctor-Patient Communication\n\nDr. Shiv Desai has been with Austin Gastro providing great in-patient care in South Austin, and started seeing patients for outpatient care at our office on Shoal Creek Blvd. in October 2020.

Thankfully, these symptoms can be managed with regular ongoing treatment. There is no cure for IBD at this piont, but there is much research happening in this area and a cure is the goal. For now, most patients achieve and remain in remission, but ongoing professional evaluation and medical care is critical to manage any complications that may arise.\n\nDr. Adam Hafemeister on Reasons for a Conolonsopy Before Age 50\n\nDr. Adam Hafemeister of Austin Gastroenterology outlines some of the reasons why someone might need to have a colonoscopy prior to age 50, as recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology. If a person has a family history of colon cancer, or even colon polyps, screening should typically begin at age 45. Other reasons a colonoscopy might be needed is when a person is experiencing an unexplained change in bowel habits (constipation and/or diarrhea), blood in the stool or black stool, abdominal pain & bloating, unintentional weight loss.\n\nDr. Harry Thomas on the 3 Phases of a Low FODMAP Diet\n\nDr. Harry Thomas of Austin Gastroenterology explains that the goals of a Low FODMAP diet are twofold. First and foremost we want to restore a person's digestive health and improve their quality of life. But first we must understand what each person's individual food triggers are, so they can be avoided - at least for a while. There are three phases in this exercise: The Elimination Phase, The Reintroduction Phase, and the Personalization Phase. Dr. Thomas explains the process and purpose of each phase, and the benefits a person might expect if followed correctly.\n\nDr. Adam Hafemeister: Can Polyps Be Removed During a Screening Colonoscopy\n\nMany people wonder what happens if a polyp is found during their screening colonoscopy. Can it be removed right away? Would a second procedure have to be scheduled to remove it? Dr. Adam Hafemeister, with Austin Gastroenterology says yes, most of the time polyps can be removed during the initial screening colonoscopy. Only rarely, depending on the size and a few other situations, would a patient need to come back for a second colonoscopy to have the polyp removed. Remember, a colonoscopy is the only screening option that can both detect AND prevent colon cancer at the same time. Our goal is to catch & remove colon polyps before they have a chance to develop into cancer. Everyone 45+ should start a conversation with their physician about their family history of colon polyps and colon cancer to determine the age you should start screening. Most people with average risk should have their first screening at age 50.\n\nDr. Adam Hafemeister: Why Dripping Springs?\n\nDr, Adam Hafemeister, with Austin Gastroenterology, discusses what he loves about the Dripping Springs community, and why he chose to focus his practice in this area.\n\nDr. Harry Thomas Leadership in the local IBD Community\n\nDr. Harry Thomas, of Austin Gastroenterology, proudly supports the Austin IBD community in two important ways. He serves on the Leadership Board of the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation’s Central Texas Chapter, and also Chairs the Austin Mission Committee, which consists of 10 healthcare providers in Austin dedicated to increasing the integration of medical care and support services provided to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, their healthcare providers, and their caregivers. Thank you, Dr. Thomas, for all of your hard work and dedication to the IBD community!\n\nDr. Anupama Duddempudi on KVUE Discussing the Importance of Maintaining Your Gut Health\n\nWe are learning more and more each year about the critical role gut health plays in our overall health. The gut informs everything from your central nervous system, your skin, your brain and mental health. Dr. Anupama Duddempudi of Austin Gastroenterology visited KVUE News to talk about the benefits of healthy foods, probiotics and prebiotics. She also outlines certain foods that can have a damaging effect on our gut health, and how to avoid these pitfalls to maintain optimal gut health.\n\nDr. Navdeep Chehl on KXAN: Avoiding the Painful Symptoms of Heartburn\n\nDr. Navdeep Chehl of Austin Gastroenterology stopped by KXAN's Studio 512 to give us some helpful tips on how to manage all of the family, food and fun over the holidays and bypass some of the painful heartburn and indigestion that can accompany all of the fun that comes along with the holiday season. Some of the uncomfortable\"Holiday Heartburn\" symptoms include belching, chest pain, burning in the chest, nausea, and regurgitation, acid-reflux, and the feeling of food getting stuck after swallowing. Common heartburn triggers include acidic and spicy foods, citrus and tomato-based foods, fried and fatty foods, mint-flavored candy, caffeine and alcohol.... basically all of the things that make the holidays so much fun! The first thing to do to avoid holiday heartburn (or lessen the symptoms) is to enjoy all of these things in moderation, keep your body weigh in control, avoid smoking. In addition, a good strategy can be to wait a few h ours after eating to lie down to go to sleep, and sleeping on your left side has been shown to prevent reflux symptoms. Two over the counter medications, Gaviscon and Pepcid, can be taken as needed before bedtime and they really help. However, proton pump inhibitors such as Nexium, Prilosec, and Prevacid - also available over the counter - aren't really appropriate for \"as needed\" therapy. These are better suited for regular, every day use, to be effective.\n\nDr. Harry Thomas and Britney Knowlton, PA-C on KEYE At Home DNA Kits Nov 2019\n\nBritney Knowlton, a new mom and Physicians Assistant at Austin Gastroenterology, and Dr. Harry Thomas, a gastroenterologist with Austin Gastro, urge people to use caution when evaluating clinical information and interpretations from at-home DNA testing kits. Britney and her husband took these tests for fun as they began to plan to have a baby to learn more about their heritage. The portion of the test related to genetic diseases indicated that she had a high risk for Lynch Syndrome, an inherited condition that causes an increased risk for breast and colon cancer. Naturally, this caused a great deal of panic and concern for Britney and her husband. After seeing an oncologist for formal genetic testing Britney was relieved to find that she in fact does not have Lynch Syndrome. Dr. Harry Thomas explains that while these at-home DNA tests are useful for gaining insight into a person's ancestry, people should use caution when gleaning clinical information since these tests can be vulnerable to both false negatives and false positives, and that it is always best to talk with a doctor if you have concerns about your risk for genetic diseases.\n\nDr. Navdeep Chehl on KVUE Austin Discussing Holiday Heartburn\n\nDr. Navdeep Chehl of Austin Gastroenterology sat down with KVUE Austin to give us some helpful tips on how to avoid holiday heartburn.

When she was formally diagnosed, Erin's doctors told her she would probably not be able to live a full life. They warned her that becoming a mother would be unlikely and that her quality of life would be severely impaired because of our Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Erin's story is one of triumph over her diagnosis because she has realized so many of her dreams including becoming a mother, having a career, continuing her education, eating delicious healthy foods in restaurants, traveling and volunteering her time. The key to her success has been remaining steadfast with her treatment plans. She never stops taking her medications or infusion treatments, even when she's feeling great. Erin made it her mission to challenge the limitations her physicians laid out for her and worked with her doctors to find treatment plans that worked for her during various stages of her life. Erin is now in her 40s and hasn't had a single IBD flare in almost 7 years.\n\nBinh Pham Removes Colon Polyp During Fellow Gastroenterologists Screening Colonoscopy final\n\nWhen it was time for Dr. Harish Gagneja's first colonoscopy upon his 50th birthday, he called upon his friend and business partner, Dr. Binh Pham to perform his procedure. Both physicians are gastroenterologists with Austin Gastroenterology in Austin, Texas. Dr. Gagneja decided to invite cameras in to document his experience having his own colonoscopy to clear up some common misconceptions about the colonoscopy prep, the procedure itself, and the recovery afterward. During the colonoscopy, Dr. Pham shows us exactly why following the instructions of the bowel prep and having a clean colon is such an important part of the process. During the procedure, Dr. Pham detected and removed a colon polyp from Dr. Gagneja, preventing it from ever developing into colon cancer. Colon cancer is the 2nd deadliest cancer in men & women in the United States, yet 1 in 3 people are not being screened as recommended. Everyone 50+,, or with a family history of colon cancer should be screened at least every 10 years. A colonoscopy is the only screening test that can detect and remove colon cancer at the same time.\n\nDr. Harish Gagneja's Personal Colonoscopy Documentary\n\nDr. Harish Gagneja, a gastroenterologist with Austin Gastroenterology, recently turned 50 and invited the cameras in to videotape his very first colonoscopy to help clear up some of the common misconceptions people have about the prep before the procedure, the colonoscopy procedure itself, as well as the recovery after the procedure. During his colonoscopy a polyp was detected and removed, preventing it from ever developing into colon cancer. Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of deaths in men and women in the United States. Yet 1 in 3 Americans are not screened as recommended. Colon cancer has a 90% survival rate when found and treated early. Everyone 50+, and those with a family history of colon cancer, or personal history of polyps should be screened. 4 out of 5 people diagnosed with colon cancer have no family history of the disease. A colonoscopy is the only screening test that can both detect and prevent colon cancer. You will see for yourself how simple and easy this process is from prep to recovery , and how a 15 minute procedure every 5 -10 years really can save your life.\n\nDr. Binh Pham Discussing Warning Signs and Symptoms of Colon Cancer on FOX7\n\nQuite alarming statistics have recently come out that show colon cancer is being diagnosed much earlier than ever before. 1 in 5 newly diagnosed colon and rectal cancers are occurring between the ages of 20 to 54. The current guidelines recommend that people have their first screening at age 50 unless there is a family history of colon cancer, or a personal history of colon polyps. Anyone, at any age, who experience certain symptoms of colon cancer such as weight loss, anemia, blood in their stool, abdominal pain, and changes in their stool consistency should definitely talk with their doctor about their symptoms to determine if a colon screening would be a good idea. Most commonly, symptoms do not occur in the early stages of colon cancer, which is why regular screening and colon cancer awareness is so important.\n\nDr. Ken Ellis on the Growing Number of Younger Patients Being Diagnosed with Colon Cancer\n\nHistoricall"
