He loved being an only child and taking cross-country car trips in summers. He met his wife, Mary, at age 21, and knew she was the one because together they would never run out of things to talk about. He was drafted into the military while engaged to Mary. He served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam war. After being released from duty, Harry and Mary settled and raised a family with three children on Long Island. He worked at Brinkmann Instruments for thirty three years, and spent five years working for the IRS, waiting for Mary to retire from teaching.\n\nHarry had a passion for cooking, especially while listening to Simon and Garfunkel, Rolling Stones, Meatloaf, or the Eagles. He also enjoyed golfing, reading, and most especially, eating and engaging in good conversation outside on the deck. Harry and Mary moved to St. George thirteen years ago. They spent their retirement years traveling around the world, spoiling grandchildren, and participating in community activities. Harry was baptized into the LDS church on January 23 rd , 2016, and sealed to his sweetheart in the St. George temple on July 1 st , 2017.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Mary Aldrich in St. George, Utah; his children, Michael (Emma) Aldrich in Laie, Hawaii, Susan (Rogan) Ferguson in Los Angeles, California, and Laura (Nick) Theodosis in Spanish Fork, Utah; his grandchildren, Carina (Isaiah), David, Kathleen (Ephraim), Peter, Annie, Jared, James, Emma, Asa, Malcolm, Jacob, Sam, Lucy, Rosie; and his great grandchild, Diana."
