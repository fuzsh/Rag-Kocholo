        "text": "Harry R. Hughes, a Democrat whose landslide victory in the 1978 election for governor of Maryland delivered a decisive rebuke to the culture of corruption epitomized by two of his predecessors, Spiro T. Agnew and Marvin Mandel, died on Wednesday at his home in Denton, Md. He was 92.\n\nHis daughter Elizabeth Hughes said the cause was complications of pneumonia.\n\nAfter Mr. Agnew, who had resigned to become vice president, pleaded no contest to felony tax evasion in 1973, and Mr. Mandel, his successor, was convicted of racketeering in 1977 (the conviction was later overturned), Mr. Hughes promised Maryland voters an honest and understated administration. That is largely what he delivered.\n\nHe collaborated with neighboring states to protect Chesapeake Bay from pollution; raised gasoline taxes to pay for road repairs; appointed a record number of women and minorities to state posts; aggressively pursued drunken drivers; expanded the prison system; restructured formulas for financing public education and for imposing taxes to make both more equitable; and presided over the celebration of the state’s 350th anniversary.\n\nBeginning in 1971, as Maryland’s first secretary of transportation, he transformed modest Friendship Airport into Baltimore-Washington International and successfully lobbied for the Metro SubwayLink in Baltimore, which opened in 1983."
