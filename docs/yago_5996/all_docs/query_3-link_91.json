        "text": "Mabel Ruth Hughes, 98, passed away on her birthday, Sunday, April 26, 2020, at White Pine Assisted Living in White Bear Lake, MN from the effects of Alzheimer’s.\n\nThe second child of Henry and Dorothy Hanson, Mabel was born in Six Mile Grove Township, Swift County. She attended country school near their farm through 8th grade and graduated from Benson High School in 1940.\n\nMay 28, 1942, Mabel married Harry Hughes at the St. Paul Cathedral in St. Paul, MN, just prior to his deployment for service in World War II. After the war, they made their home in Benson where they raised five children and lived for over sixty years. Mabel enjoyed golfing, bowling, dancing as well as gardening, and playing bridge. She loved socializing with friends and was an active member of Our Redeemer’s Church.\n\nMabel was preceded in death by her husband Harry, parents Henry and Dorothy, brother Clarence (Kelly), and son Dennis. She is survived by her children Diane (Leon) Pearson, James (Willie), John (Cindy) Hughes, Betty (Erica); her sister Helen Trahan; her grandchildren, Nicholas, Christopher, Ryan, Eric, Kaitlin, and Christine; and great grandchildren, Connor, Cayden, Treston, Kelton, Briella, and Natalia.\n\nA celebration of Mabel’s life will be held at a later date in light of the current public health crisis. If you wish to give a memorial, choose a charity of your choice."
