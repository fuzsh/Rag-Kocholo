October 28, 1851.\n\nThe Inquirer and Commercial News (Perth, WA : 1855 - 1901) Wed 11 Jun 1879\n\nThe People's Jubilee Tea-Meeting:\n\n. . . . .\n\nTHE LATE MR. HARRY HUGHES.-Our obituary columns to-day announce the death of Mr. H. L. Hughes, at Singapore -it is mentioned in the Straits Times from the result of an accident three days before. The deceased will be remembered by old residents in Perth in connection with the Press, but more especially as the active worker in the formation of the Swan River Mechanics' Institute.\n\n. . . . .\n\nThe Herald (Fremantle, WA : 1867 - 1886) Sat 21 Jun 1879 page 3\n\nA GOOD many still resident in Perth and other parts of the colony-will recollect Harry Hughes, who for some years was connected with the local press, the \"Perth Gazette,\" we believe, and who took an active part in founding the Perth Mechanics' Institute. To those who remember him, the following testimony to his ability and worth as a journalist by the Singapore Straits Times will be read with pleasure. We have heard that beyond being recognised as a \"jolly fellow,\" Hughes was not much appreciated here, but else where he seems to have been more successful:-\"Harry Lance Hughes was a journalist who was not afraid to call things by their right names. The files of the Observer and Chronicle will be a lasting testimony to his courage and independence as a writer as well as his earnestness and sincerity of purpose. He is gone. His voice is silent. His pen is laid aside for ever. Nothing now is left but a sad and sorrowful memory. But if the memory of \"poor old Hughes\" shall awaken within the breasts of some of us a sense of our own short-comings, our dereliction of duty, our cowardice as writers for the Press and encourage us to pursue our course boldly and fearlessly as he did, then his labours during life will not have been in vain, and of him it will be truly said;-\"He being dead yet speaketh.\"\n\nThe Inquirer and Commercial News (Perth, WA : 1855 - 1901) Wed 2 Jul 1879\n\nOccasional Notes:\n\n. . . . .\n\nI have often thought of Harry Hughes, and the ups and downs which he, either purposely or by accident, mixed himself up with in the early days of this colony, but I had long thought him dead when I saw the paragraph in your obituary column about his uncoiling. Poor Harry- of herculean strength both mind and body! And what a good heart he had! Poor Hughes, I am told, fell down a flight of stairs in Singapore and fractured his skull. There, as here, he appears to have stuck to the Press, and to have been appreciated by the Singaporeans, judging from the following notice of him which I extract from the Straits Times :- I cannot omit to pay a slight tribute to the memory of one who has so recently been taken from our midst-Harry Lance Hughes. He was a journalist who was not afraid to call things by their right names. The files of the Observer and Chronicle will be a lasting testimony to his courage and independence as a writer as well as his earnestness and sincerity of purpose. He is gone. His voice is silent. His pen is laid aside for ever. Nothing now is left but a sad and sorrowful memory. But if the memory of \"poor old Hughes\" shall awaken within the breasts of some of us a sense of our own short-comings, our dereliction of duty, or cowardice as writers for the Press, and encourage us to pursue our course boldly and fearlessly as he did, then his labours during life will not have been in vain.\n\n. . . . .\n\nOther Records\n\n William Harry Lance Hughes: Obituary, 1879, Singapore.\n\n William Harry Lance Hughes: Obituary, 1879, Singapore.\n\nWilliam married Margery Marianne WILLIAMS [13237] [MRIN: 4476], daughter of Thomas WILLIAMS [2419] and Winifred CROCKER [7942], on 16 Jun 1851 in St Georges Church, Perth, Western Australia.
