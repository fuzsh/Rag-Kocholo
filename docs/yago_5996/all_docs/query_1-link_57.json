Despite heavy lobbying from detergent manufacturers and major retailers, the measure passed. He also imposed a moratorium on harvesting rockfish in Maryland waters. He later served as president of the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology, a UMD research facility in Queenstown that was named in his honor in 2006. Hughes also advocated for government funding for stem-cell research, inspired by his wife’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.
