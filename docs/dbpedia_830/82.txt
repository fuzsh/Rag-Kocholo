Our families have lived in the area for 3 generations. We met each other at school and have 3 grown-up children.

We have a keen interest in property and do both rentals and renovations. in 2014 we decided to open Wisteria Lodge through which we thoroughly enjoyed meeting all our wonderful guests.

In 2019 we also opened Hemlock Glade after fully restoring this beautiful little cottage.
