        "text": "Janet Withers passed away at her home in Sunnybrook’s Veteran’s Centre on March 2nd, 2022. Jan was truly one of a kind. Even at 99 years of age, she maintained her sharp wit, keen interest in getting to know others and love for life.\n\nJan was born in Vancouver, B.C. to Harold Darling and Ellen Alaine Darling (nee Lund) and was the second youngest of 8 children. She loved spending her summers at her family’s cottage on Gabriola Island, soaking up the sun and playing with her brothers and sisters.\n\nJan was a veteran of WWII, proudly supporting from the homefront as a supply truck driver. She not only took immense pride in her service, but also found moments of joy in meeting people from across Canada, attending dances, and even singing on stage for the rest of the troops. While serving, Jan met Army Captain Kenneth Ray Allan. They were married in 1945 and were together for seven years.\n\nYears later, while living in Toronto, she remarried to Harold Withers and the couple owned an antique store together. Harold passed away in 1974. In addition to working at the antique store, Jan ran the daily operations at a dental office and volunteered with the Red Cross.\n\nJan was always musical, whether it was playing piano, singing or soaking in all the musical performances she could. She took every opportunity she had to perform for others. She also loved gardening, putting together a beautiful array of flowers on her veranda every year at her Broadview and Danforth apartment and enjoying the gardens at Sunnybook every chance she had.\n\nKind, curious and adventurous, Jan was an independent spirit who lived life to the fullest. She will be sorely missed; her loved ones are grateful for the impact she has made on their lives and the lives of everyone she’s crossed paths with over her 99 years of life.\n\nIn memoriam donations can be made to Sunnybrook's Veteran's Centre or CNIB."
