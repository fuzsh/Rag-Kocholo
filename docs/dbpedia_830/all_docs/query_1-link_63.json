        "text": "Maia Mitchell, Belmont Cameli and Peter Stormare have joined the cast of Until Dawn, Sony’s Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions’ feature adaptation of the hit horror video game.\n\nMitchell, Cameli and Stormare join Ella Rubin, Michael Cimino, Ji-young Yoo and Odessa A’zion on the call sheet for the production, which begins shooting in mid-August.\n\nDavid F. Sandberg, who last directed Shazam! Fury of the Gods, is returning to the horror genre with the project and is reuniting with his Annabelle: Creation writer-producer Gary Dauberman on it.\n\nDauberman, who has a first-look deal with the studio, wrote the most recent draft of the script and is producing under his Coin Operated banner with Mia Maniscalco, alongside Sandberg and his Mångata partner Lotta Losten. Vertigo Entertainment’s Roy Lee and PlayStation Productions’ Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan are also producing.\n\nFirst released in 2015, Until Dawn is an interactive horror video game that follows eight friends and frenemies who are brought together at a remote mountain retreat. With live-or-die scenarios featuring a mysterious killer, cannibalistic wendigos, a cable car and a long-ago mining cave-in that reverberates into the present day, the members of the group must fight through their fear if they all hope to make it through the night in one piece.\n\nIt is unclear how the screen version will tackle the task of translating the many paths and scenarios, but the adaptation has been described as an R-rated and terrifying love letter to the horror genre, centering on an ensemble cast. Blair Butler wrote the initial script.\n\nIt is also unclear who Mitchell and Cameli are playing. However, insiders say that in a callback to the game, Stormare is reprising his role of therapist Dr. Hill.\n\n“I’ve been longing to do horror again after Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation, and this film explores the many great subgenres of horror to create the most terrifying experience possible,” said Sandberg in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “Capturing the essence of the game but with new characters, it serves as a great stand-alone introduction to the world for the newcomer as well as offers something new that the fans of the game will enjoy.”\n\nMichael Bitar is overseeing the project for Screen Gems. Charles Miller is executive producing.\n\nMitchell is best known for her long-running work on Freeform drama series The Fosters and its spinoff Good Trouble, the latter of which she also exec produced. The singer-actress had her breakthrough with Disney Channel’s Teen Beach movies and most recently wrapped production on the thriller Family Secrets alongside Eric Dane and Tyriq Withers.\n\nCameli was one of the stars of Peacock’s Saved by the Bell reboot and starred in Netflix’s YA drama Along for the Ride, which hailed from To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before screenwriter Sofia Alvarez. He will next be seen in Barry Levinson’s mob film Alto Knights, which stars Robert De Niro and which Warner Bros. will release later this year.\n\nStormare is a veteran actor with hundreds of credits to his name, although he may be best known for his chipper role in the Coen brothers’ cult classic Fargo. Highlights also include Armageddon, The Big Lebowski, Constantine, and a stint on Prison Break.\n\nMitchell is repped by WME, Anonymous Content, Myman Greenspan. Camelli is repped by Stewart Talent, Industry Entertainment, and Hansen, Jacobson."
