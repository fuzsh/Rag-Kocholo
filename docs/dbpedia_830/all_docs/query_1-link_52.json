        "text": "Share\n\nJo Ann’s Story\n\nJo Ann Withers was born Oct.31st 1939 at the home of Erma and John Withers. Her older brother, John Howard, was coming home from school and his younger brother Mac came running out to greet him yelling “Guess what ? we got a new baby sister “ !!\n\nJo Ann grew up near Fountain Hill Arkansas on a small farmstead 10 miles from town. No electricity till she was 14 years old. Water was from a hand pump from the well out in the yard. During high water season in the spring her father would row her across the “Sabin” river so she could catch the school bus. Jo Played basketball in High School. Back then the girls had 6 players on each team, 3 played defense and 3 played offense. Jo played Offense, Jo graduated in 1957 with a class of 20.\n\nJo Ann went to Arizona to live with her Aunt Chris. She worked there several years, then she moved back to Arkansas. Jo Married Larry Cockrum, this union created two children, Don Randall and Barbara Denise. Jo Ann then moved to Chicago and worked as an executive secretary for several company’s. She talked about walking to work in high heels to and from work to save 25 cents each way on the bus. In 1971 she divorced. She married Larry #2 in 1974… Please notice she left a Larry and married another Larry.\n\nGuess who never called her new spouse by the wrong name?\n\nGuess who did? It was not pleasant..\n\nHer new husband brought his son, Larry Jr into the family.\n\nThe 2 boy’s we’re the same age. Jo and I told everybody we had “his and hers” and none of Ours..\n\nWe talked about 1 of ours but these kids were crazy and we decided on a Yellow Lab puppy instead, enter Belle Star.\n\nThe family got a transfer through IBM to LaCrosse, Wisconsin in Oct 1976. Jo looked for secretarial work but all the wages were minimum wage. Jo took a job selling Parents Magazine doing cold calls. She did pretty good. Then Jo got recruited at a bratwurst stand to sell Home Interiors & Gifts by Jan Brandemuel in Haugen, Wisconsin. Jan ended up being one of Jo’s very dear friends. Jo did quite well selling Home Interiors and recruiting people to join the team.\n\nShe soon had 18 girls that were selling and doing well. She got promoted to Unit Manager. Next, she got promoted to Branch Manager and she was responsible for Approx 300 ladies. This Job had become a career and had lots of windshield time and 70 to 80 hours of work per week.\n\nIn her 25 years with Home Interiors she won numerous awards, Diamond Jewelry pieces, Fur Coats, Cruises, Silver Punch Bowl Set, She loved Home Interiors and the lady that Started the Company, Mary Crowley. Mary had started the company in her garage on a 10,000 dollar loan.\n\nThe Co. was run on Christian principles and Jo was very inspired and accepted Jesus, she had a great relationship with Jesus as a result until she took her last breath.\n\nJo was a great Decorator. We Owned 2 cabins, 1 Villa, 1 Town house, and 7 houses. Jo put cornice boards on all the window’s in the last 3 house’s we owned in Fla. I would build the board with ½ inch Plywood and ¼ inch Pine. Jo would pick the fabric to match the color of the paint in the room. She had an electric Stapler that she used to attach the batting and Fabric. I would attach the cornice to the wall over the window’s. They looked nice and we saved a lot of money doing it ourselves.\n\nJo Ann Loved Square dancing, we went for lessons. We used to go to the Wisconsin Dells many times for 2 night 3 day trips of Dancing. Lots of good friends and great times.\n\nJo also liked volleyball and she had a wicked side arm serve with her fist that the girls on the other team did not like to receive.\n\nJo Ann was also an exceptional Seamstress, she made her own wedding dress also her made of honor’s dress, her daughter’s dress, and her mother’s dresses. They were all beautiful. She also had made me a grey suit that I wore to work. On special holiday’s she would make matching outfits for the kids….we were looking sharp.\n\nJo was a good cook, and her corn bread was top notch. One of her most requested suppers by the kids was called slop. I remember her French dip sandwich, her split pea and Ham soup, brown gravy from scratch… she knew her way around the Kitchen.\n\nJo Ann had many talents but her greatest attribute was that hard work did not bother her at all. She was constantly busy doing things that were beneficial for her Family.\n\nJo was also involved in the creation of 2 new churches: Red Cedar Community Church in Rice Lake, WI, and Heritage Baptist Church in Fruitland Park, Florida.\n\nJo Ann loved cats and she saved and raised quite a few. Samantha, was her first cat rescued from a Walmart parking lot in the middle of winter in Rice Lake, WI. Guido- a barn Cat, Pandy- a tortoise shell cat, Macarina- also a tortoise shell who would sit in your lap for hours, Gypsy and Jim and Tigger. She spent many happy hours loving these cats.\n\nJo was preceded in death by John and Erma Withers (her mom and dad); her older brothers, Mac and John Howard. Jo was survived by her sister, Christeen Grey and her husband Bo; 2 nieces, Amanda and Angela; and nephew, Larry, alias Boomer.\n\nShe is missed by many still here on earth and welcomed by many in heaven. She had happy and full life and I was proud to call her my wife."
