        "text": "I\n\nHe did not wear his scarlet coat,\n\nFor blood and wine are red,\n\nAnd blood and wine were on his hands\n\nWhen they found him with the dead,\n\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\n\nAnd murdered in her bed.\n\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\n\nIn a suit of shabby grey;\n\nA cricket cap was on his head,\n\nAnd his step seemed light and gay;\n\nBut I never saw a man who looked\n\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\n\nWith such a wistful eye\n\nUpon that little tent of blue\n\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\n\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\n\nWith sails of silver by.\n\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\n\nWithin another ring,\n\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\n\nA great or little thing,\n\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n\n\"That fellow's got to swing.\"\n\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\n\nSuddenly seemed to reel,\n\nAnd the sky above my head became\n\nLike a casque of scorching steel;\n\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\n\nMy pain I could not feel.\n\nI only knew what hunted thought\n\nQuickened his step, and why\n\nHe looked upon the garish day\n\nWith such a wistful eye;\n\nThe man had killed the thing he loved\n\nAnd so he had to die.\n\nYet each man kills the thing he loves\n\nBy each let this be heard,\n\nSome do it with a bitter look,\n\nSome with a flattering word,\n\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\n\nThe brave man with a sword!\n\nSome kill their love when they are young,\n\nAnd some when they are old;\n\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\n\nSome with the hands of Gold:\n\nThe kindest use a knife, because\n\nThe dead so soon grow cold.\n\nSome love too little, some too long,\n\nSome sell, and others buy;\n\nSome do the deed with many tears,\n\nAnd some without a sigh:\n\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\n\nYet each man does not die.\n\nHe does not die a death of shame\n\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\n\nNor have a noose about his neck,\n\nNor a cloth upon his face,\n\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\n\nInto an empty place\n\nHe does not sit with silent men\n\nWho watch him night and day;\n\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\n\nAnd when he tries to pray;\n\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\n\nThe prison of its prey.\n\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\n\nDread figures throng his room,\n\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\n\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\n\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\n\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\n\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\n\nTo put on convict-clothes,\n\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes\n\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\n\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\n\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\n\nHe does not know that sickening thirst\n\nThat sands one's throat, before\n\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\n\nSlips through the padded door,\n\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\n\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\n\nHe does not bend his head to hear\n\nThe Burial Office read,\n\nNor, while the terror of his soul\n\nTells him he is not dead,\n\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\n\nInto the hideous shed.\n\nHe does not stare upon the air\n\nThrough a little roof of glass;\n\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\n\nFor his agony to pass;\n\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\n\nThe kiss of Caiaphas.\n\nII\n\nSix weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\n\nIn a suit of shabby grey:\n\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\n\nAnd his step seemed light and gay,\n\nBut I never saw a man who looked\n\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\n\nWith such a wistful eye\n\nUpon that little tent of blue\n\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\n\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\n\nIts raveled fleeces by.\n\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\n\nThose witless men who dare\n\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\n\nIn the cave of black Despair:\n\nHe only looked upon the sun,\n\nAnd drank the morning air.\n\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\n\nNor did he peek or pine,\n\nBut he drank the air as though it held\n\nSome healthful anodyne;\n\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\n\nAs though it had been wine!\n\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\n\nWho tramped the other ring,\n\nForgot if we ourselves had done\n\nA great or little thing,\n\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\n\nThe man who had to swing.\n\nAnd strange it was to see him pass\n\nWith a step so light and gay,\n\nAnd strange it was to see him look\n\nSo wistfully at the day,\n\nAnd strange it was to think that he\n\nHad such a debt to pay.\n\nFor oak and elm have pleasant leaves\n\nThat in the spring-time shoot:\n\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\n\nWith its adder-bitten root,\n\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\n\nBefore it bears its fruit!\n\nThe loftiest place is that seat of grace\n\nFor which all worldlings try:\n\nBut who would stand in hempen band\n\nUpon a scaffold high,\n\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\n\nHis last look at the sky?\n\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\n\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\n\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\n\nIs delicate and rare:\n\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\n\nTo dance upon the air!\n\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\n\nWe watched him day by day,\n\nAnd wondered if each one of us\n\nWould end the self-same way,\n\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\n\nHis sightless soul may stray.\n\nAt last the dead man walked no more\n\nAmongst the Trial Men,\n\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\n\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\n\nAnd that never would I see his face\n\nIn God's sweet world again.\n\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\n\nWe had crossed each other's way:\n\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\n\nWe had no word to say;\n\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\n\nBut in the shameful day.\n\nA prison wall was round us both,\n\nTwo outcast men were we:\n\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\n\nAnd God from out His care:\n\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\n\nHad caught us in its snare.\n\nIII\n\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\n\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\n\nSo it was there he took the air\n\nBeneath the leaden sky,\n\nAnd by each side a Warder walked,\n\nFor fear the man might die.\n\nOr else he sat with those who watched\n\nHis anguish night and day;\n\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\n\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\n\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\n\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\n\nThe Governor was strong upon\n\nThe Regulations Act:\n\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\n\nA scientific fact:\n\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called\n\nAnd left a little tract.\n\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\n\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\n\nHis soul was resolute, and held\n\nNo hiding-place for fear;\n\nHe often said that he was glad\n\nThe hangman's hands were near.\n\nBut why he said so strange a thing\n\nNo Warder dared to ask:\n\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\n\nIs given as his task,\n\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\n\nAnd make his face a mask.\n\nOr else he might be moved, and try\n\nTo comfort or console:\n\nAnd what should Human Pity do\n\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\n\nWhat word of grace in such a place\n\nCould help a brother's soul?\n\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\n\nWe trod the Fool's Parade!\n\nWe did not care: we knew we were\n\nThe Devil's Own Brigade:\n\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\n\nMake a merry masquerade.\n\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\n\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\n\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\n\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\n\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\n\nAnd clattered with the pails.\n\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\n\nWe turned the dusty drill:\n\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\n\nAnd sweated on the mill:\n\nBut in the heart of every man\n\nTerror was lying still.\n\nSo still it lay that every day\n\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\n\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\n\nThat waits for fool and knave\n\n, Till once, as we tramped in from work,\n\nWe passed an open grave.\n\nWith yawning mouth the yellow hole\n\nGaped for a living thing;\n\nThe very mud cried out for blood\n\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\n\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\n\nSome prisoner had to swing.\n\nRight in we went, with soul intent\n\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\n\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\n\nWent shuffling through the gloom\n\nAnd each man trembled as he crept\n\nInto his numbered tomb.\n\nThat night the empty corridors\n\nWere full of forms of Fear,\n\nAnd up and down the iron town\n\nStole feet we could not hear,\n\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\n\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\n\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\n\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\n\nThe watcher watched him as he slept,\n\nAnd could not understand\n\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\n\nWith a hangman close at hand?\n\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\n\nWho never yet have wept:\n\nSo we—the fool, the fraud, the knave—\n\nThat endless vigil kept,\n\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\n\nAnother's terror crept.\n\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\n\nTo feel another's guilt!\n\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\n\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\n\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\n\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\n\nThe Warders with their shoes of felt\n\nCrept by each padlocked door,\n\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\n\nGrey figures on the floor,\n\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\n\nWho never prayed before.\n\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\n\nMad mourners of a corpse!\n\nThe troubled plumes of midnight were\n\nThe plumes upon a hearse:\n\nAnd bitter wine upon a sponge\n\nWas the savior of Remorse.\n\nThe cock crew, the red cock crew,\n\nBut never came the day:\n\nAnd crooked shape of Terror crouched,\n\nIn the corners where we lay:\n\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\n\nBefore us seemed to play.\n\nThey glided past, they glided fast,\n\nLike travelers through a mist:\n\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\n\nOf delicate turn and twist,\n\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\n\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\n\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\n\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\n\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\n\nThey trod a saraband:\n\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\n\nLike the wind upon the sand!\n\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\n\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\n\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\n\nAs their grisly masque they led,\n\nAnd loud they sang, and loud they sang,\n\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\n\"Oho!\" they cried, \"The world is wide,\n\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\n\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\n\nIs a gentlemanly game,\n\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\n\nIn the secret House of Shame.\"\n\nNo things of air these antics were\n\nThat frolicked with such glee:\n\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\n\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\n\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\n\nMost terrible to see.\n\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\n\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs:\n\nWith the mincing step of demirep\n\nSome sidled up the stairs:\n\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\n\nEach helped us at our prayers.\n\nThe morning wind began to moan,\n\nBut still the night went on:\n\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\n\nCrept till each thread was spun:\n\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\n\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\n\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\n\nThe weeping prison-wall:\n\nTill like a wheel of turning-steel\n\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\n\nO moaning wind! what had we done\n\nTo have such a seneschal?\n\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars\n\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\n\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\n\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\n\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\n\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\n\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\n\nAt seven all was still,\n\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\n\nThe prison seemed to fill,\n\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\n\nHad entered in to kill.\n\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\n\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\n\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\n\nAre all the gallows' need:\n\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\n\nTo do the secret deed.\n\nWe were as men who through a fen\n\nOf filthy darkness grope:\n\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\n\nOr give our anguish scope:\n\nSomething was dead in each of us,\n\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\n\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\n\nAnd will not swerve aside:\n\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\n\nIt has a deadly stride:\n\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\n\nThe monstrous parricide!\n\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\n\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\n\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\n\nThat makes a man accursed,\n\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\n\nFor the best man and the worst.\n\nWe had no other thing to do,\n\nSave to wait for the sign to com\n\ne: So, like things of stone in a valley lone,\n\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\n\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick\n\nLike a madman on a drum!\n\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\n\nSmote on the shivering air,\n\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\n\nOf impotent despair,\n\nLike the sound that frightened marshes hear\n\nFrom a leper in his lair.\n\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\n\nIn the crystal of a dream,\n\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\n\nHooked to the blackened beam,\n\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\n\nStrangled into a scream.\n\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\n\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\n\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\n\nNone knew so well as I:\n\nFor he who lives more lives than one\n\nMore deaths than one must die.\n\nIV\n\nThere is no chapel on the day\n\nOn which they hang a man:\n\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\n\nOr his face is far too wan,\n\nOr there is that written in his eyes\n\nWhich none should look upon.\n\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\n\nAnd then they rang the bell,\n\nAnd the Warders with their jingling keys\n\nOpened each listening cell,\n\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\n\nEach from his separate Hell.\n\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\n\nBut not in wonted way,\n\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\n\nAnd that man's face was grey,\n\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\n\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw sad men who looked\n\nWith such a wistful eye\n\nUpon that little tent of blue\n\nWe prisoners called the sky,\n\nAnd at every careless cloud that passed\n\nIn happy freedom by.\n\nBut there were those amongst us all\n\nWho walked with downcast head,\n\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\n\nThey should have died instead:\n\nHe had but killed a thing that lived\n\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\n\nFor he who sins a second time\n\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\n\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud,\n\nAnd makes it bleed again,\n\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood\n\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\n\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\n\nWith crooked arrows starred,\n\nSilently we went round and round\n\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\n\nSilently we went round and round,\n\nAnd no man spoke a word.\n\nSilently we went round and round,\n\nAnd through each hollow mind\n\nThe memory of dreadful things\n\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\n\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\n\nAnd terror crept behind.\n\nThe Warders strutted up and down,\n\nAnd kept their herd of brutes,\n\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\n\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\n\nBut we knew the work they had been at\n\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\n\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\n\nThere was no grave at all:\n\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\n\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\n\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\n\nThat the man should have his pall.\n\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\n\nSuch as few men can claim:\n\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\n\nNaked for greater shame,\n\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\n\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\n\nAnd all the while the burning lime\n\nEats flesh and bone away,\n\nIt eats the brittle bone by night,\n\nAnd the soft flesh by the day,\n\nIt eats the flesh and bones by turns,\n\nBut it eats the heart alway.\n\nFor three long years they will not sow\n\nOr root or seedling there:\n\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\n\nWill sterile be and bare,\n\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\n\nWith unreproachful stare.\n\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\n\nEach simple seed they sow.\n\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\n\nIs kindlier than men know,\n\nAnd the red rose would but blow more red,\n\nThe white rose whiter blow.\n\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\n\nOut of his heart a white!\n\nFor who can say by what strange way,\n\nChrist brings his will to light,\n\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\n\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\n\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\n\nMay bloom in prison air;\n\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\n\nAre what they give us there:\n\nFor flowers have been known to heal\n\nA common man's despair.\n\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\n\nPetal by petal, fall\n\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\n\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\n\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\n\n<7nbsp; That God's Son died for all.\n\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\n\nStill hems him round and round,\n\nAnd a spirit man not walk by night\n\nThat is with fetters bound,\n\nAnd a spirit may not weep that lies\n\nIn such unholy ground,\n\nHe is at peace—this wretched man—\n\nAt peace, or will be soon:\n\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\n\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\n\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\n\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\n\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\n\nThey did not even toll\n\nA reguiem that might have brought\n\nRest to his startled soul,\n\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\n\nAnd hid him in a hole.\n\nThey stripped him of his canvas clothes,\n\nAnd gave him to the flies;\n\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat\n\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\n\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\n\nIn which their convict lies.\n\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\n\nBy his dishonored grave:\n\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\n\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\n\nBecause the man was one of those\n\nWhom Christ came down to save.\n\nYet all is well; he has but passed\n\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\n\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\n\nPity's long-broken urn,\n\nFor his mourner will be outcast men,\n\nAnd outcasts always mourn.\n\nV\n\nI know not whether Laws be right,\n\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\n\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\n\nIs that the wall is strong;\n\nAnd that each day is like a year,\n\nA year whose days are long.\n\nBut this I know, that every Law\n\nThat men have made for Man,\n\nSince first Man took his brother's life,\n\nAnd the sad world began,\n\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\n\nWith a most evil fan.\n\nThis too I know—and wise it were\n\nIf each could know the same—\n\nThat every prison that men build\n\nIs built with bricks of shame,\n\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\n\nHow men their brothers maim.\n\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\n\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\n\nAnd they do well to hide their Hell,\n\nFor in it things are done\n\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\n\nEver should look upon!\n\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds\n\nBloom well in prison-air:\n\nIt is only what is good in Man\n\nThat wastes and withers there:\n\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\n\nAnd the Warder is Despair\n\nFor they starve the little frightened child\n\nTill it weeps both night and day:\n\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\n\nAnd gibe the old and grey,\n\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\n\nAnd none a word may say.\n\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\n\nIs foul and dark latrine,\n\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\n\nChokes up each grated screen,\n\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\n\nIn Humanity's machine.\n\nThe brackish water that we drink\n\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\n\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\n\nIs full of chalk and lime,\n\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\n\nWild-eyed and cries to Time.\n\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\n\nLike asp with adder fight,\n\nWe have little care of prison fare,\n\nFor what chills and kills outright\n\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\n\nBecomes one's heart by night.\n\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\n\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\n\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\n\nEach in his separate Hell,\n\nAnd the silence is more awful far\n\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\n\nAnd never a human voice comes near\n\nTo speak a gentle word:\n\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\n\nIs pitiless and hard:\n\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\n\nWith soul and body marred.\n\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\n\nDegraded and alone:\n\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\n\nAnd some men make no moan:\n\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\n\nAnd break the heart of stone.\n\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\n\nIn prison-cell or yard,\n\nIs as that broken box that gave\n\nIts treasure to the Lord,\n\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\n\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\n\nAh! happy day they whose hearts can break\n\nAnd peace of pardon win!\n\nHow else may man make straight his plan\n\nAnd cleanse his soul from Sin?\n\nHow else but through a broken heart\n\nMay Lord Christ enter in?\n\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat.\n\nAnd the stark and staring eyes,\n\nWaits for the holy hands that took\n\nThe Thief to Paradise;\n\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\n\nThe Lord will not despise.\n\nThe man in red who reads the Law\n\nGave him three weeks of life,\n\nThree little weeks in which to heal\n\nHis soul of his soul's strife,\n\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\n\nThe hand that held the knife.\n\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\n\nThe hand that held the steel:\n\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\n\nAnd only tears can heal:\n\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\n\nBecame Christ's snow-white seal.\n\nVI\n\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\n\nThere is a pit of shame,\n\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\n\nEaten by teeth of flame,\n\nIn burning winding-sheet he lies,\n\nAnd his grave has got no name.\n\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\n\nIn silence let him lie:\n\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\n\nOr heave the windy sigh:\n\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\n\nAnd so he had to die."
