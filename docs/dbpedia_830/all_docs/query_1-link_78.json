        "text": "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to tell you in person how much your work has meant to my family. A few years ago I left an oppressive religion (Jehovah's Witnesses) because it no longer made sense to me. I really never looked back, but my wife & daughter who recently followed were often plagued by guilt. After discovering your podcast & doing a little research to confirm that you were speaking from a position of authority & honesty (I was at first delighted & then burned by Zeitgeist), I began to share points with them that helped them to understand that it is simply impossible to build a firm defensible dogma from the Bible. I could go on at this point, gushing about their joy as they began to see the Bible for what it is, allowing the chains to slip from their minds. I could also grovel in gratitude for the sleepless nights you have eliminated and the clarity of vision you have encouraged, and it would all be true. What I will do is say that whatever compensation you receive for your work, it is not enough. So please add to that the fact that you have helped three people in a very real way and for that we thank you.\n\nI have been a practicing Christian since I was about 19 years old; first within Evangelical Protestantism, which did give me a love for the Bible. Yet the more I read the Bible, the more questions I had. As I read Church history I couldn't find any of the doctrines that I had been taught, like \"the sinner's prayer.\" I began to realize such things were not only not a part of the early Church, but were not even in the Bible! Eventually I went seeking a more historical and liturgical form of Christianity, joining the Eastern Orthodox Church. Yet as the years have gone by I seem to have traded one crisis of faith with another. Over the last couple of years I slowly faded away from the zealous commitment for Church I once had and, as I've become more familiar with Church history, I have come to realize there never was \"one true Church.\" I slipped into agnosticism and began reading all of the New Atheists books and listening to their talks. I began to actually hate the Bible. The murder, the evils, and all the rest people like Dawkins harp on all the time.\n\nIt was about this time that I first encountered your work. I thought to myself, \"Oh no, not another one of these Jesus myth people!\" Yet after listening to you on that show I found that you at least knew the scholarship and history of the Bible and early Christianity, and, more importantly, you weren't making some of the outrageous claims that many of the \"atheist apologists\" make about the issue. These people seem to me no better than Christian apologists like William Lane Craig.\n\nHowever, you seemed to have a balanced opinion on the topic, and I have come to learn a great deal from your talks and from the Bible Geek program itself. While I do not adhere to the Christ myth theory myself, your balanced, historical and thought-out approach to the topic of the historical Jesus has shed new light on the subject for me.\n\nIt was around that time that I also happened across two of your works that have been illuminating for me, the first was reading a copy of The Reason Driven Life. Nearly every single page made perfect sense to me. It helped me to reflect upon where I was spiritually, and it was the first step in helping me to become comfortable with the reality that none of us \"know\" anything for certain.\n\nThe second piece of your work that had a fundamental change on me was when I listened to a talk you had given titled \"Is the Bible Mein Kampf?\" I had developed a hatred for the Bible, yet, deep down, I missed the Bible. This talk made me realize that I was totally overreacting.\n\nYour podcast and archived lectures and writings, along the Reason Driven Life have given me \"permission\" to love the Bible once again. And I do love the Bible. I find it utterly fascinating, enlightening, full of wisdom at times, and you are a big reason that I have once again began reading the Bible, studying it and learning from it. I consider myself a believer, though as I said, an agnostic believer. I respect your courage for saying what you believe even though it has cost you professionally.\n\nI have been a long time fan of yours. Coming from a fundamentalist Baptist among Baptists background, I have been wading into the waters of leaving the faith for some time. With that, you cannot know how your insight, wisdom, and experience have truly helped me in probably one of the hardest things I have ever gone through so far in my life. I was saved at 19, came up in a household of semi-charismatic/Methodist background (yes, you read that correctly) so I already had a horrible guilt-complex to carry with my new-found faith. I jumped in whole heartedly and head first, ending up in seminary at Mid America under the tutelage of Dr. Mike Spradlin, someone I still admire greatly but no longer agree with in principal. I worked on staff at Bellevue Baptist Church under Dr. Adrian Rogers, the self-avowed 3-point Calvinist and lived every jot and tittle of the faith. Until my eyes were opened. Working at the church was the best and worst thing that could have happened to me and began my slide down the mountain back to reality. So many unanswered questions that my mind could not comprehend, and my apologist background could not resolve, I began delving into the oh-so demonic comparative religion studies and I have never been the same. I am now 35, and am a mega-fan of The Bible Geek and just finished The Incredible Shrinking Son of Man  an amazing read. Anyway, thank you so much for all you do. You just cannot know how much of a blessing  your knowledge and wisdom are to those of us both fully out and those of us just beginning to get free. Again, you just cant know how much you are helping so many of us find the real truth.\n\nI got to know Bob Price around about 1982, I think. I'd heard somewhere about Crypt of Cthulhu -- he was maybe doing issue 6 at the time, as hard as that might be to imagine now -- I asked for a copy, thanked him, he wrote back, I replied. Over the next five years, the stack of letters from that sweet, busy, talented, funny man probably swelled past four inches. No one could possibly have been more engaging or more supportive. All us schmoes who were writing Bob in those days -- I'm certain that each and every one of us felt that Bob would have given us the shirt off his back. I probably would never have written a word on Clark Ashton Smith, if Bob hadn't been so encouraging. Folks, let's face facts: our little subculture suffers from more than its fair share of poseurs, swelled egos, and creeps. Bob Price stood apart from all of that. And the work he was doing stood apart, too. Right from the first, Bob made sure his magazine was a haven for Lovecraftians of all stripes, a warm and welcoming and inclusive playground of ideas and artwork, a rollicking and fun-packed message-board for our oddball little community. No viperous fannish cliques ever ruled his Editorial Board (which consisted of Bob Price, Robert Price, Robert M. Price, and the enigmatic \"RMP\"), no one was forced to toe a line; a splendid genealogical treatise on Lovecraft's Rochester ancestors would rub elbows with a bad sketch of Godzilla trashing Providence. The real watchwords were quality, creativity, playfulness. And that was enough. Enough to be remembered fondly for quite a long time, I predict. For me, and I know for many others reading this now, Bob Price succeeded in putting a very human -- and very likeable -- face on The UnNameable. Thank you, Bob.\n\nI've long suspected that Dr. Price might be sympathetic to our spiritual outlook. If nothing else, we have some common interests. He is an advocate of Nietzschean philosophy and passionate authority on H.P. Lovecraft (Google \"robert price chaosium\") as well as Biblical Higher Criticism (which is to say, he knows more about the actual origins and history of the Bible than most entire congregations of fundamentalist Christians combined). He is guided by reason, but holds a deep abiding love for myth, wonder, and the importance of creating one's own meaning amidst the cold inertia of uncaring chaos.\n\nI'm currently reading his book The Reason-Driven Life, a secular response to and rebuttal to pastor Rick Warren's The Purpose-Driven Life. Everything I've read so far only supports my theory; Dr. Price may not be into magic himself, but at the end of the day I think he's one of us, or close enough that it makes little difference.\n\nI was delighted to hear Dr. Price talk to Ipsissimus Webb. Within secularist and humanist circles there remains a lingering hostility - perhaps not unjustified, considering the circumstances - to anything resembling spirituality in contemporary society. But I think the more they are exposed to ideas found in Setian philosophy, the more they will realize that recognizing the unique gift of self-aware human intelligence for what it is need not mean a surrender to wacky faith-based beliefs, arbitrary morality or science denial. This talk will hopefully be a useful step in that direction.\n\nIm a devoted fan of your podcast and although as a layperson, a majority of your content goes well above my head, I love learning about the Bible and all of its puzzles and mysteries. I have to concede that as a self professed skeptic, I used to have a contemptuous orientation towards the Bible and I took selfish pleasure in decrying the beliefs of fundamentalists and admonishing them with ill-concealed and immoderate derision. I viewed most Christians as credulous and glib and I denounced their unwillingness or inability to critically and objectively analyze the text to manifest truth rather than simply confirm a previously held bias. I also took great pleasure in giving a laundry list of contradictions to Christians and watching them squirm and perspire while they try to explain away the obvious incompatibilities and dichotomies. Then one day I heard you say that you felt that agnostics and atheists may be impoverishing themselves of moral and intellectual enlightenment by constantly scoffing at the religious texts rather than trying to comprehend them. Your aforementioned comments and a perusal of your Reason Driven Life made me realize that one not need be a believer in metaphysics, no matter how illogical I may assert them to be, to procure insight and edification from religious texts. I also realized that by being thoroughly ignorant of the Bible yet ceaselessly condemning of it, that I was part of the same hypocrisy as all of those hapless evangelical rubes that I was so fond of admonishing.\n\nI am writing you because of the strange circle which seems to have come around in my life. I had first heard of you by means of your contribution to a Lovecraft compilation and more recently through the wonderful H.P.Podcraft podcast. Your insight and candor regarding dear old H.P. delighted me. Upon hearing you describe yourself as a Christian Atheist, I became intrigued and began investigating your host episodes on Point of Inquiry. Then, after much trepidation, tuned into The Bible Geek... and I was delighted; far more than delighted, actually, I feel like I can open my mind again to topics and interests I have shut out for several years. Thank you.\n\nNow here's the backstory: I had been an active evangelical for over twenty years in a \"progressive\" non-denominational church. In that time, I had risen into roles of teaching the bible and pastoral leadership in one of the institution's so-called \"home groups\". I had given a big chunk of my life to the church and studied quite enthusiastically. Progressing through the church's own curriculum and a few courses sponsored by an established seminary, I felt I had a pretty sophisticated apologetic. However, I believe my perspective remained just a crack wider than my fellow \"evangelists\" since I had more than a rudimental understanding of eastern religions from my formal degree in East Asian Language and Literature. Things never sat as neat and cleanly as the church leadership seemed to prescribe. And as things played out, through a convergence of personal issues and dissent in the ranks, I left the church. Then over the course of the past few years, so left my belief in a personal, capital \"G\" god, and eventually, my belief in most things metaphysical. I suppose I stand now as an agnostic with a desire to build meaning out of the tangible things in this world.\n\nI hadn't thought much about all the biblical study I had done all those years...until I listened to the Bible Geek. Perhaps I was ashamed or afraid? I don't know. I DO know, however, that the critical perspectives and scholarship you so kindly dish out are inspiring. Not in a \"ha ha, you Christian dupes\" sort of way, but in a \"there's some very interesting and useful stuff in the Bible to inform us about HUMANITY\".\n\nOn the December 11th Geek, one of the blessed disciples of Your Holiness mentioned his conversion to Jesus mythicism. Although I have no conversion story (from one religion to another, or to atheism), I do have a long and complicated conversion to Jesus mythicism, although I will condense the conversion from 50 emails to one. (One Email To Rule Them All)\n\nI approached Christianity, like its step-sister Islam, from the ultra-conservative viewpoint (since that is where I am coming from in my own emunah/faith). I did this in the interest of fairness - I felt that liberals in our society made a mockery of the New Testament just like they mocked Leviticus. I therefore held hands with the likes of Dr. James White, in not only believing Jesus was historical, but that most of the NT was true, the only false parts being any that contradict the Prophets. I was one of the numerous Jews and Muslims today that did not see the virgin birth, or even the resurrection, as indicative of divinity. I understood the Trinity -- and once again agreed with the likes of Dr. James White that the NT is full of Trinitarian verses. Here's the \"ultra\" part in conservative: I believed the Gospels were all penned before 60 CE, and the NT as a whole was no later than 70 CE. When I came across scholars bringing up \"late dates\" (such as 90 CE for Revelation), I was surprised. How could intelligent scholars believe this nonsense? Is it not obvious that the talmidim (students) of Yeshu wrote the Gospels?\n\nThen one day - while reading the Epistle of Barnabas (and previously reading all of Bart Ehrman's works), I had an epiphany. How the She'ol did this not make it into the New Testament? The next day, I tuned into Dr. White's Dividing Line, and he had mentioned abruptly that the majority of scholars do not believe the Pastorals are from Paul. I already knew this, but the way he said it made me reconsider: is it possible that Paul really did not write them? So I began research into textual criticism. I listened to lectures, read books and internet articles. Almost immediately I became an adherent of the 8-Epistle view (the true 7 + Colossians). I rejected 2 Peter as genuine, and began to question whether John Zebedee really wrote the Gospel of John. At this point I was basically a carbon copy of Bart Ehrman.\n\nI began to discuss my views with Christians online, and with some Atheists. An Atheist friend of mine mentioned Your Holiness. When he told me you were one of those DENIALISTS! I quickly ignored you and your works for about three months. Dr. White then mentioned you on the Dividing Line, and I felt it was safe to listen to you and read your works. So I did. After a total period of 2 years, I went from Ultra-Conservative to Bart Ehrman to being a DENIALIST!\n\nSo that is my story. Thank you for liberating me."
