The great oaks\n\nHave roof'd it with their arms and affluent leaves,\n\nSo that the sunbeam rifles not its fount,\n\nWhile the shade cools it. You may hear it now,\n\nA low faint murmur, as through pebbly paths,\n\nIn soft and sinuous progress it flows on,\n\nIn streams that make division as they go,\n\nStill parting, still uniting, in one song,\n\nThe sweetest mortals know, of constancy.\n\nThither, ah, thither, if thy heart be sad!--\n\nThat song will bring thee solace. Or, if hope\n\nThat may not yet find name for what it seeks,\n\nInspires thee with a dream whose essence brings\n\nFruition in its keeping,--still, the strain\n\nThat's murmur'd by yon brooklet, is the best,--\n\nHaving a voice for fancy at its birth,\n\nThat keeps it wakeful on its own sweet wings.\n\nAnd thou wilt gather, for whatever mood\n\nThat makes thee fond or thoughtful, a sweet tone\n\nBeguiling thy best sympathies, and still\n\nLeaving in thy keeping, as thou seek'st thy home,\n\nA kindlier sense of what is in thy path.\n\nPage 8\n\nBeside these banks, through the whole livelong day,\n\nEre yet I noted much the flight of time,\n\nAnd knew him but in ballad books and songs,\n\nNor cared to know him better,--I have lain,\n\nNursing delicious reveries that made\n\nAll being but a circle of bright flowers,\n\nWith love the centre, sov'ran of that realm,\n\nAnd I a happy inmate, with the rest.\n\nThere, with sweet thoughts, all liquid like the stream\n\nThat still inspired their progress, clear and bright,\n\nI lay as one who slept, through happy hours,\n\nUnvex'd by din of duty, unrebuked\n\nBy chiding counsellor to youthful cares,\n\nThat ever seeks to plant on boyish brow\n\nThe winter that has silver'd all its own.\n\nAnd thus, in long delight, with the rapt soul\n\nShaping its own elysium of the peace\n\nThat harbor'd in the solitude, the eye\n\nGrew momently familiar with sweet forms,\n\nThat offer'd to the genius of the place,\n\nMaking all consecrate to gentleness.\n\nHow came the thrush to whistle as he drank,\n\nHeeding not me, and darting through the copse,\n\nOnly to bring his loved one on his wing,\n\nTo gather like refreshment? Squirrels dropt\n\nTheir nuts adown the bankside where I lay,\n\nAnd, leaping to recover them, ere yet\n\nThey rolled into the brooklet and away,\n\nSwept over me, and with fantastic play\n\nDrew up the feathery brush above their heads,--\n\nAnd their gray orbs, with bright intelligence,\n\nCast round them, while from hand to hand they frisk'd\n\nThe prize, which none might covet but to feed\n\nSuch nimble harlequins. The dove at noon\n\nPage 9\n\nCouch'd in thick bristly covering of the pine,\n\nSought here its sweet siesta, wooing sleep,\n\nBy plaintive iteration of sad notes,\n\nThat might be still a sensible happiness:--\n\nAnd sometimes, meek intruder on my realm,\n\nThrough yonder thick emerging, half in light\n\nAnd half in shadow, stole the timid fawn,\n\nThat came down to the basin's edge to drink,\n\nNow lapping, and now turning to the bank,\n\nCropping the young blade of the coming spring\n\nAnd heedless, as I lay along unstirr'd,\n\nOf any stranger--sauntering through the shade,\n\nEven where I crouch'd,--having a quiet mood,\n\nAnd not disturbing, while beholding mine.\n\nThou smil'st; and on thy lip the speaking thought\n\nLooks still like censure--deems my hours misspent,\n\nAnd saddens into warning. A shrewd thought,\n\nI will not combat with an argument,\n\nBut leave the worldly policy to boast,\n\nThat such an errantry as this life of mine,\n\nHath found its fit sarcasm, well rebuked.\n\nAnd yet there is a something in the life\n\nThou mock'st, as idle still and profligate,\n\nSomething to life compensative, and dear\n\nTo feelings that are fashion'd not by man.\n\nAh! the delicious sadness of the hours,\n\nSpent by this brooklet--ah! the dreams they brought,\n\nOf other hopes and beings--the sweet truths,\n\nThat still subdued the heart to patientness,\n\nAnd made all flexible in the youthful will,\n\nThat else had been most passionate and rash.\n\nI know the toils that gather on my path,\n\nAnd I will grapple them with a strength that shows\n\nPage 10\n\nA love for the encounter, not the less\n\nFor hours thus wasted in the solitude,\n\nAnd fancies born of dreams--and 'twill not more\n\nImpair the resolute courage of my heart,\n\nWrestling with toil, in conflicts of the race,\n\nIf still, in pauses of the fight, I dream\n\nOf this dear idlesse,--gazing on that brook\n\nSo sweet in shade, thus singing on its way,\n\nLike some dear child, all thoughtless, as it goes\n\nFrom shadow into sunlight and is lost.\n\nSABBATH IN THE FOREST.\n\n1. FREEDOM OF THE SABBATH.\n\nLET us escape! This is our holiday--\n\nGod's day, devote to rest; and, through the wood\n\nWe'll wander, and, perchance, find heavenly food:\n\nSo, profitless, it shall not pass away.\n\n'Tis life, but with sweet difference, methinks,\n\nHere, in the forest;--from the crowd set free,\n\nThe spirit, like escaping song-bird, drinks\n\nFresh sense of music from its liberty.\n\nThoughts crowd about us with the trees--the shade\n\nHolds teachers that await us: in our ear,\n\nUnwonted, but sweet voices do we hear,\n\nThat with rare excellence of tongue persuade:\n\nThey do not chide our idlesse,--were content,\n\nIf all our walks were half so innocent. Page 11\n\nFLOWERS AND TREES.\n\nMARCH is profuse in violets--at our feet\n\nThey cluster,--not in pride, but modesty;\n\nThe damsel pauses as she passes by,\n\nPlucks them with smiles, and calls them very sweet.\n\nBut such beguile me not! The trees are mine,\n\nThese hoary-headed masters;--and I glide,\n\nHumbled, beneath their unpresuming pride,\n\nAnd wist not much what blossoms bud or shine.\n\nI better love to see you grandsire oak,\n\nOld Druid-patriarch, lone among his race,--\n\nWith blessing, out-stretch'd arms, as giving grace\n\nWhen solemn rites are said, or bread is broke:\n\nDecay is at his roots,--the storm has been\n\nAmong his limbs,--but the old top is green.\n\n3. THE SAME SUBJECT.\n\nTHE pine with its green honors; cypress gray,\n\nBedded in waters; crimsoning with bloom\n\nThe maple, that, irreverently gay,\n\nToo soon, methinks, throws off his winter gloom;\n\nThe red bud, lavish in its every spray,\n\nGlowing with promise of the exulting spring;\n\nAnd over all, the laurel, like some king,\n\nConscious of strength and stature, born for sway.\n\nI care not for their species--never look\n\nFor class or order in pedantic book,--\n\nEnough that I behold them--that they lead\n\nTo meek retreats of solitude and thought,\n\nDeclare me from the world's day-labors freed,\n\nAnd bring me tidings books have never brought. Page 12\n\n4. RELIGIOUS MUSINGS.\n\nTHE mighty and the massy of the wood\n\nCompel my worship: satisfied I lie,\n\nWith naught in sight but forest, earth, and sky,\n\nAnd give sweet sustenance to precious mood!--\n\n'Tis thus from visible but inanimate things,\n\nWe gather mortal reverence. They declare\n\nIn silence, a persuasion we must share,\n\nOf hidden sources, spiritual springs,\n\nFountains of deep intelligence, and powers,\n\nThat man himself implores not; and I grow\n\nFrom wonder into worship, as the show,\n\nMajestic, but unvoiced, through noteless hours,\n\nImposes on my soul, with musings high,\n\nThat, like Jacob's Ladder, lifts them to the sky!\n\n5. SOLACE OF THE WOODS.\n\nWOODS, waters, have a charm to soothe the ear,\n\nWhen common sounds have vex'd it. When the day\n\nGrows sultry, and the crowd is in thy way,\n\nAnd working in thy soul much coil and care--\n\nBetake thee to the forests. In the shade\n\nOf pines, and by the side of purling streams\n\nThat prattle all their secrets in their dreams,\n\nUnconscious of a listener--unafraid--\n\nThy soul shall feel their freshening, and the truth\n\nOf nature then, reviving in thy heart,\n\nShall bring thee the best feelings of thy youth,\n\nWhen in all natural joys thy joy had part,\n\nEre lucre and the narrowing toils of trade\n\nHad turn'd thee to the thing thou wast not made. Page 13\n\n6. POETRY OF THE FOREST.\n\nTHESE haunts are sacred,--for the vulgar mood\n\nLoves not seclusion. Here the very day\n\nSeems in a Sabbath dreaminess to brood:\n\nThe groves breathe slumber--the great tree-tops sway\n\nDrowsily, with the idle-going wind;\n\nAnd sweetest images before my mind\n\nPersuade me into pleasure with their play.\n\nHere, fancies of the present and the past\n\nDelight to mingle, 'till the palpable seems\n\nInseparate from the glory in my dreams,\n\nAnd golden with the halo round it cast;\n\nThus do I live with Rosalind, thus stray\n\nWith Jacques; and churning o'er some native rhyme,\n\nPersuade myself it smacks of the old time.\n\nTHE LOST PLEIAD.\n\nI.\n\nNOT in the sky,\n\nWhere it was seen\n\nSo long in eminence of light serene,--\n\nNor on the white tops of the glistering wave,\n\nNor down, in mansions of the hidden deep,\n\nThough beautiful in green\n\nAnd crystal, its great caves of mystery,--\n\nShall the bright watcher have\n\nHer place, and, as of old, high station keep! Page 14\n\nII.\n\nGone! gone!\n\nOh! never more, to cheer\n\nThe mariner, who holds his course alone\n\nOn the Atlantic, through the weary night,\n\nWhen the stars turn to watchers, and do sleep,\n\nShall it again appear,\n\nWith the sweet-loving certainty of light,\n\nDown shining on the shut eyes of the deep!\n\nIII.\n\nThe upward-looking shepherd on the hills\n\nOf Chaldea, night-returning, with his flocks,\n\nHe wonders why his beauty doth not blaze,\n\nGladding his gaze,--\n\nAnd, from his dreary watch along the rocks,\n\nGuiding him homeward o'er the perilous ways!\n\nHow stands he waiting still, in a sad maze,\n\nMuch wondering, while the drowsy silence fills\n\nThe sorrowful vault!--how lingers, in the hope that night\n\nMay yet renew the expected and sweet light,\n\nSo natural to his sight!\n\nIV.\n\nAnd lone,\n\nWhere, at the first, in smiling love she shone,\n\nBrood the once happy circle of bright stars:\n\nHow should they dream, until her fate was known,\n\nThat they were ever confiscate to death?\n\nThat dark oblivion the pure beauty mars,\n\nAnd, like the earth, its common bloom and breath,\n\nThat they should fall from high;\n\nTheir lights grow blasted by a touch, and die,--\n\nAll their concerted springs of harmony\n\nSnapt rudely, and the generous music gone! Page 15\n\nV.\n\nAh! still the strain\n\nOf wailing sweetness fills the saddening sky;\n\nThe sister stars, lamenting in their pain\n\nThat one of the selectest ones must die,--\n\nMust vanish, when most lovely, from the rest!\n\nAlas! 'tis ever thus the destiny.\n\nEven Rapture's song hath evermore a tone\n\nOf wailing, as for bliss too quickly gone.\n\nThe hope most precious is the soonest lost,\n\nThe flower most sweet is first to feel the frost.\n\nAre not all short-lived things the loveliest?\n\nAnd, like the pale star, shooting down the sky,\n\nLook they not ever brightest, as they fly\n\nFrom the lone sphere they blest!\n\nFIRST DAY OF SPRING.\n\nOH! thou bright and beautiful day,\n\nFirst bright day of the virgin spring,\n\nBringing the slumbering life into play,\n\nGiving the leaping bird his wing.\n\nThou art round me now in all thy hues,\n\nThy robe of green, and thy scented sweets,\n\nIn thy bursting buds, in thy blessing dews,\n\nIn every form that my footstep meets.\n\nI hear thy voice in the lark's clear note,\n\nIn the cricket's chirp at the evening hour;\n\nIn the zephyr's sighs that around me float,\n\nIn the breathing bud and the opening flower.\n\nPage 16\n\nI see thy forms o'er the parting earth,\n\nIn the tender shoots of the grassy blade,\n\nIn the thousand plants that spring to birth,\n\nOn the valley's side in the home of shade.\n\nI feel thy promise in all my veins,\n\nThey bound with a feeling long suppress'd,\n\nAnd, like a captive who breaks his chains,\n\nLeap the glad hopes in my heaving breast.\n\nThere are life and joy in thy coming, Spring,\n\nThou hast no tidings of gloom and death,\n\nBut buds thou shakest from every wing,\n\nAnd sweets thou breathest with every breath.\n\nBALLAD.\n\nBY the brooklet, grove and meadow,\n\nWhere together once we stray'd,\n\nDo I wander, fond as ever,\n\nHaunting still each secret shade;\n\nAnd, that thus content I wander,\n\nWhere such precious joys were mine,\n\nDo I know that thou art with me,\n\nAnd my spirit walks with thine.\n\nIn the murmur of the brooklet,\n\nStill thy well-known voice I hear,\n\nAnd the whisper in the tree-top,\n\nTells me that thy form is near;\n\nPage 17\n\nThou hast left me, at departing,\n\nAll that earth could never take,\n\nAnd, still comforted, I wander\n\nThrough these shadows for thy sake.\n\nWere I guilty of a passion\n\nWhich thy beauty could survive,\n\nStill I feel thy gentle presence\n\nMust the earthly fancy shrive;\n\nAnd, discoursing with thy spirit,\n\nOh! I feel that earth has naught\n\nTo compensate the forgetting\n\nOf the sweetness thou hast taught.\n\nSONNET.--BY THE SWANANNOA.\n\nIs it not lovely, while the day flows on\n\nLike some unnoticed water through the vale,\n\nSun-sprinkled,--and, across the fields, a gale,\n\nAusonian, murmurs out an idle tale,\n\nOf groves deserted late, but lately won?\n\nHow calm the silent mountains, that, around,\n\nBend their blue summits, as if group'd to hear\n\nSome high ambassador from foreign ground,--\n\nTo hearken, and, most probably, confound!\n\nWhile, leaping onward, with a voice of cheer,\n\nGlad as some schoolboy ever on the bound,\n\nThe lively Swanannoa sparkles near;--\n\nA flash and murmur mark him as he roves,\n\nNow foaming white o'er rocks, now glimpsing soft through groves.\n\nPage 18\n\nTO TIME.\n\nGRAY monarch of the waste of years,\n\nMine eyes have told thy steps in tears,\n\nYet yield I not to feeble fears,\n\nIn watching now thy flight:\n\nThe pangs that follow'd still thy blow\n\nHave lost their edge with frequent woe,\n\nAnd stronger must the courage grow\n\nThat's fed by constant fight.\n\nThe neck long used to weighty yoke,\n\nThe tree once shiver'd by the stroke,\n\nThe heart by frequent torture broke--\n\nThese fear no later blight.\n\nOh! mine hath been a mournful song,--\n\nMy neck hath felt the burden long,--\n\nMy tree was shiver'd,--weak and strong,\n\nBeneath the bolt went down!--\n\nThe Fate that thus took early sway,\n\nHath spared of mine but little prey,\n\nFor old and young were torn away,\n\nEre manhood's wing had flown;--\n\nI saw the noble sire, who stood\n\nMajestic, as in crowded wood,\n\nThe pine--and after him, the brood,\n\nAll perish in thy frown.\n\nSo, count my hopes--so, tell my fears,\n\nAnd ask what now this life endears,\n\nTo him who gave, with many tears,\n\nEach blossom of his love;\n\nPage 19\n\nWhose store in heaven, so precious grown,\n\nHe counts each earthly moment flown,\n\nAs loss of something from his own,\n\nIn treasures shrined above.\n\nDenied to seek--to see--his store,\n\nYet daily adding more and more,\n\nSome precious plant, that, left before,\n\nThe spoiler rends at last.\n\nNot hard the task to number now\n\nThe few that live to feel the blow;\n\nThe perish'd,--count them on my brow,\n\nWith white hairs overcast.\n\nWhite hairs--while yet each limb is strong\n\nTo help the right and crush the wrong--\n\nEre youth, in manhood's struggling throng,\n\nHad well begun his way:--\n\nThought premature, that still denied\n\nThe boy's exulting sports--the pride,\n\nThat, with the blood's unconscious tide,\n\nKnows but to shout and play;\n\nYouth, that in love's first gush was taught\n\nTo see his best affection brought\n\nTo tears, and woe, and death,--\n\nWhile yet the fire was in his eye,\n\nThat told of passion's victory,\n\nAnd, in his ear, the first sweet sigh,\n\nFrom beauty's laboring breath.\n\nAnd manhood now,--and loneliness,--\n\nWith, oh! how few to love and bless,\n\nSave those who, in their dear duresse,\n\nLook down from heaven's high towers;\n\nThe stately sire, the gentle dame,\n\nPage 20\n\nThe maid who first awoke the flame,\n\nThat gave to both a mutual claim,\n\nSoon forfeited, as ours--\n\nAnd all those dearest buds of bloom,\n\nThat simply sought on earth a tomb,\n\nFrom birth to death, with rapid doom,\n\nA bird-flight wing'd for fate:\n\nHow thick the shafts!--how sure the aim!--\n\nWhat other passion wouldst thou tame,\n\nOh! Time, within this heart of flame,\n\nElastic, not elate?\n\nIs't pride?--methinks 'tis joy to bend;--\n\nMy foe--he can no more offend;--\n\nMy friend is false;--I love my friend;--\n\nI love my foeman too!--\n\n'Tis man I love;--nor him alone,\n\nThe brute, the bird,--its joy or moan,\n\nNot heedless, to my heart hath gone--\n\nI feel with all I view.\n\nWouldst have me worthy?--make me so,\n\nBy frequent bruise and overthrow;--\n\nBut spare on other hearts the blow,\n\nSpare, from the cruel pang, the woe,\n\nMy innocent--my bright!\n\nOn me thy vengeance! 'Tis my crime\n\nThat needs the scourge, and, in my prime,\n\n'Twere fruitful of improving time,\n\nThy hands should not be light.\n\nI bend me willing to the thrall,\n\nWhate'er the doom will bear it all,--\n\nDrink of the bitter cup of gall,\n\nNor once complain of thee;\n\nPage 21\n\nWill poverty avail to chide,\n\nOr sickness bend the soul of pride,\n\nOr social scorn, still evil-eyed?--\n\nHave, then, thy will of me!\n\nBut spare the woman and the child!--\n\nLet me not see their features mild\n\nDistorted,--hear their accents wild,\n\nIn agonizing pain--\n\nToo much of this!--I thought me sure,\n\nIn frequent pang and loss before;--\n\nI still have something to endure,--\n\nAnd tremble, and--refrain!\n\nOn every shore they watch thy wing,--\n\nTo some the winter, some the spring,\n\nThou bring'st, or yet art doom'd to bring,\n\nIn rapid-rolling years:\n\nHow many seek thee, smiling now,\n\nWho soon shall look with clouded brow,\n\nHeart fill'd with bitter doubt and woe,\n\nAnd eyes with gathering tears!--\n\nBut late, they fancied,--life's parade\n\nStill moving on,--that, not a shade\n\nThou flung'st on bower and sunny glade,\n\nIn which they took delight:--\n\nSharp satirist--methinks I see\n\nThy glance in sternest mockery;--\n\nThey little think, not seeing thee,\n\nHow fatal is thy flight;--\n\nWhat feathers grow beneath thy wing,\n\nWhat darts--how poison'd--from what spring\n\nOf sorrow, and how keen the sting,--\n\nHow cureless still the blight.\n\nPage 22\n\nEnough!--the cry has had its way,\n\nAs thou hast had!--'tis not the lay\n\nOf vain complaint,--no idle play\n\nOf fancy-dreaming care:\n\nA mocking bitter like thine own,\n\nWells up from fountains, deep and lone,\n\nWhere sorrow, by sepulchral stone,\n\nSits watching thy career.\n\nThou'st mock'd my hope and dash'd my joy,\n\nWith keen rebuke and sad alloy--\n\nThe father, son--the man, the boy,\n\nAll, all! have felt the rod:--\n\nPerchance, not all thy work in vain,\n\nIn softening soul, subduing brain,\n\nIf, suffering, I submit to pain,--\n\nThat minister of God.\n\nTHE TRAVELLER'S REST.\n\nFOR hours we wander'd o'er the beaten track,\n\nA dreary stretch of sand, that, in the blaze\n\nOf noonday, seem'd to launch sharp arrows back,\n\nAs fiery as the sun's. Our weary steeds\n\nFalter'd, with drooping heads, along the plain,\n\nLooking from side to side most wistfully,\n\nFor shade and water. We could feel for them,\n\nHaving like thirst; and, in a desperate mood,\n\nGloomy with toil, and parching with the heat,\n\nI had thrown down my burden by the way,\n\nAnd slept, as man may never sleep but once,\n\nPage 23\n\nYielding without a sigh,--so utterly\n\nHad the strong will, beneath the oppressive care,\n\nFail'd of the needed energy for life,--\n\nWhen, with a smile, the traveller by my side,\n\nA veteran of the forest and true friend,\n\nWhose memory I recall with many a tear,\n\nLaid his rough hand most gently on mine own,\n\nAnd said, in accents still encouraging:--\n\n\"Faint not,--a little farther we shall rest,\n\nAnd find sufficient succor from repose,\n\nFor other travel: vigor will come back,\n\nAnd sweet forgetfulness of all annoy,\n\nWith a siesta in the noontide hour,\n\nShelter'd by ample oaks. A little while\n\nWill bring us to the sweetest spot in the woods,\n\nNamed aptly, 'Traveller's Rest.' There, we shall drink\n\nOf the pure fountain, and beneath the shade\n\nOf trees, that murmur lessons of content\n\nTo streams impatient as they glide from sight,\n\nForget the long day's weariness, o'er steppes\n\nOf burning sand, with thirst that looks in vain\n\nFor the cool brooklet. All these paths I know\n\nFrom frequent travail, when my pulse, like yours,\n\nBeat with an ardor soon discomfited,\n\nUnseason'd by endurance. Through a course\n\nOf toil, I now can think upon with smiles,\n\nWhich brought but terror when I felt it first,\n\nI grew profound in knowledge of the route,\n\nMarking each wayside rock, each hill of clay,\n\nBlazed shaft, or blighted thick, and forked tree,\n\nWith confidence familiar as you found\n\nIn bookish lore and company. Cheer up,\n\nPage 24\n\nOur pathway soon grows pleasant. We shall reach--\n\nNote well how truly were my lessons conn'd,--\n\nA little swell of earth, which, on these plains,\n\nLooks proudly like a hill. This having pass'd,\n\nThe land sinks suddenly--the groves grow thick,\n\nAnd, in the embrace of May, the giant wood\n\nPuts on new glories. Shade from these will soothe\n\nThy overwearied spirit, and anon,\n\nThe broad blaze on the trunk of a dark pine\n\nThat strides out on the highway to our right,\n\nWill guide us where, in woodland hollow, keeps\n\nOne lonely fountain; such as those of yore,\n\nThe ancient poets fabled as the home,\n\nEach of its nymph; a nymph of chastity,\n\nWhose duty yet is love. A thousand times,\n\nWhen I was near exhausted as yourself,\n\nThat gash upon the pine-tree strengthen'd me,\n\nAs showing where the waters might be found,\n\nOtherwise voiceless. Thanks to the rude man--\n\nRude in the manners of his forest life,\n\nBut frank and generous,--whose benevolent heart--\n\nGood kernel in rough outside,--counsels him,\n\nAs in the ages of the Patriarch,\n\nTo make provision for the stranger's need.\n\nHis axe, whose keen edge blazons on the tree\n\nOur pathway to the waters that refresh,\n\nWas in that office consecrate, and made\n\nHolier than knife, in hands of bearded priest,\n\nThat smote, in elder days, the innocent lamb,\n\nIn sacrifice to Heaven!\n\n\"Now, as we glide,\n\nThe forest deepens round us. The bald tracts,\n\nSterile, or glittering but with profitless sands,\n\nPage 25\n\nDepart; and through the glimmering woods behold\n\nA darker soil, that on its bosom bears\n\nA nobler harvest. Venerable oaks,\n\nWhose rings are the successive records, scored\n\nBy Time, of his dim centuries; pines that lift,\n\nAnd wave their coronets of green aloft,\n\nHighest to heaven of all the aspiring wood;\n\nAnd cedars, that with slower worship rise--\n\nLess proudly, but with better grace, and stand\n\nMore surely in their meekness;--how they crowd,\n\nAs if 'twere at our coming, on the path!--\n\nNot more majestic, not more beautiful,\n\nThe sacred shafts of Lebanon, though sung\n\nBy Princes, to the music of high harps,\n\nMidway from heaven;--for these, as they, attest\n\nHIS countenance who, to glory over all,\n\nAdds grace in the highest, and above these groves\n\nHung brooding, when, beneath the creative word,\n\nThey freshen'd into green, and towering grew,\n\nMemorials of his presence as his power!\n\n--Alas! the forward vision! a few years\n\nWill see these shafts o'erthrown. The profligate hands\n\nOf avarice and of ignorance will despoil\n\nThe woods of their old glories; and the earth,\n\nUncherish'd, will grow barren, even as the fields,\n\nVast still, and beautiful once, and rich as these,\n\nWhich, in my own loved home, half desolate,\n\nAttest the locust rule,--the waste, the shame,\n\nThe barbarous cultivation--which still robs\n\nThe earth of its warm garment and denies\n\nFit succor, which might recompense the soil,\n\nWhose inexhaustible bounty, fitly kept,\n\nWas meant to fill the granaries of man,\n\nThrough all earth's countless ages.\n\nPage 26\n\n\"How the sward\n\nThickens in matted green. Each tufted cone\n\nGleams with its own blue jewel, dropt with white,\n\nWhose delicate hues and tints significant,\n\nWake tenderness within the virgin's heart.\n\nIn love's own season. In each mystic cup\n\nShe reads sweet meaning, which commends the flower\n\nClose to her tremulous breast. Nor seems it there\n\nLess lovely than upon its natural couch,\n\nOf emerald bright,--and still its hues denote\n\nLove's generous spring-time, which, like generous youth,\n\nClouds never the dear aspect of its green,\n\nWith sickly doubts of what the autumn brings.\"\n\nBoy as I was, and speaking still through books--\n\nNot speaking from myself--I said: \"Alas!\n\nFor this love's spring-time--quite unlike the woods,\n\nIt never knows but one; and, following close,\n\nThe long, long years of autumn, with her robes\n\nOf yellow mourning, and her faded wreath\n\nOf blighted flowers, that, taken from her heart,\n\nShe flings upon the grave-heap where it rots!\"\n\n\"Ah! fie!\" was straightway the reply of him,\n\nThe old benevolent master, who had seen,\n\nThrough thousand media yet withheld from me,\n\nThe life I had but dream'd of--\"this is false!--\n\nLove hath its thousand spring-times like the flowers,\n\nIf we are dutiful to our own hearts,\n\nAnd nurse the truths of life, and not its dreams.\n\nBut not in hours like this, with such a show\n\nAround us, of earth's treasures, to despond,\n\nTo sink in weariness and to brood on death.\n\nOh! be no churl, in presence of the Queen\n\nPage 27\n\nOf this most beautiful country, to withhold\n\nThy joy,--when all her court caparison'd,\n\nComes to her coronation in such suits\n\nOf holiday glitter. It were sure a sin\n\nIn sight of Heaven, when now the humblest shrub\n\nBy the maternal bounty is set forth,\n\nAs for a bridal, with a jewell'd pomp\n\nOf flowers in blue enamel--lustrous hues\n\nBrightening upon their bosoms like sweet tints,\n\nCaught from dissolving rainbows, as the sun\n\nRends with his ruddy shafts their violet robes,--\n\nWhen gay vines stretching o'er the streamlet's breast\n\nLink the opposing pines and arch the space,\n\nBetween, with a bright canopy of charms,\n\nWhose very least attraction wears a look\n\nOf life and fragrance!--when the pathway gleams,\n\nAs spread for march of Princess of the East,\n\nWith gems of living lustre--ravishing hues\n\nOf purple, as if blood-dipp'd in the wounds\n\nOf Hyacinthus,--him Apollo loved,\n\nAnd slew though loving:--now, when over all\n\nThe viewless nymphs that tend upon the streams,\n\nAnd watch the upward growth of April flowers,\n\nWave ever, with a hand that knows not stint,\n\nYet suffers no rebuke for profligate waste,\n\nTheir aromatic censers, 'till we breathe\n\nWith difficult delight;--not now to gloom\n\nWith feeble cares and individual doubts,\n\nOf cloud to-morrow. It were churlish here,\n\nUngracious in the sovereign Beauty's sight,\n\nWho rules this realm, the dove-eyed sovran, Spring!\n\nThis hour to sympathy--to free release\n\nFrom toil, and sorrow, and doubt, and all the fears\n\nThat hang about the horizon of the heart,\n\nPage 28\n\nMaking it feel its sad mortality,\n\nEven when most sweet its joy--she hath decreed:\n\nLet us obey her, though no citizens.\n\n\"How grateful grows the shade--mix'd shade of trees,\n\nAnd clouds, that drifting o'er the sun's red path,\n\nCurtain his awful brows! Ascend yon hill,\n\nAnd we behold the valley from whose breast\n\nFlows the sweet brooklet. Yon emblazon'd pine\n\nMarks the abrupt transition to the shade,\n\nWhere, welling from the bankside, it steals forth,\n\nA voice without a form. Through grassy slopes,\n\nIt wanders on unseen, and seems no more\n\nThan their own glitter; yet, behold it now,\n\nWhere, jetting through its green spout, it bounds forth,\n\nCapricious, as if doubtful where to flow,--\n\nA pale white streak--a glimmering, as it were,\n\nCast by some trembling moonbow through the woods!\n\n\"Here let us rest. A shade like that of towers,\n\nWrought by the Moor in matchless arabesque,\n\nMakes the fantastic ceiling,--leaves and stems,\n\nHalf-form'd, yet flowery tendrils, that shoot out,\n\nEach wearing its own jewel,--that above\n\nO'erhangs; sustain'd by giants of the wood,\n\nErect and high, like warriors gray with years,\n\nWho lift their massive shields of holiest green,\n\nOn fearless arms, that still defy the sun,\n\nAnd foil his arrows. At our feet they fall,\n\nHarmless and few, and of the fresh turf make\n\nA rich mosaic. Tremblingly, they creep,\n\nHalf-hidden only, to the blushing shoots\n\nOf pinks, that never were abroad before,\n\nAnd shrink from such warm instance. Here are flowers,\n\nPage 29\n\nPied, blue, and white, with creepers that uplift\n\nTheir green heads, and survey the world around--\n\nAs modest merit, still ambitionless--\n\nOnly to crouch again; yet each sustains\n\nSome treasure, which, were earth less profligate,\n\nOr rich, were never in such keeping left.\n\nAnd here are daisies, violets that peep forth\n\nWhen winds of March are blowing, and escape\n\nTheir censure in their fondness. Thousands more,--\n\nLook where they spread around us--at our feet--\n\nNursed on the mossy trunks of massive trees,\n\nThemselves that bear no flowers--and by the stream--\n\nToo humble and too numerous to have names!\n\n\"There is no sweeter spot along the path,\n\nIn all these western forests,--sweet for shade,\n\nOr beauty, or reflection--sights and sounds--\n\nAll that can charm the wanderer, or o'ercome\n\nHis cares of travel. Here we may repose,\n\nSubdued by gentlest murmurs of the noon,\n\nNor feel its heat, nor note the flight of hours,\n\nThat never linger here. How sweetly falls\n\nThe purring prattle of the stream above,\n\nWhere, roused by petty strife with vines and flowers,\n\nIt wakes with childish anger, nor forbears\n\nComplaint, even when, beguiled by dear embrace,\n\nIt sinks to slumber in its bed below!\n\nThe red-bird's song now greets us from yon grove,\n\nWhere, starring all around with countless flowers,\n\nThick as the heavenly host, the dogwood glows,\n\nArray'd in virgin white. There, mid the frowns\n\nOf sombrous oaks, and where the cedar's glooms\n\nTell of life's evening shades, unchidden shines\n\nThe maple's silver bough, that seems to flash\n\nPage 30\n\nA sudden moonlight; while its wounded arms,\n\nStream with their own pure crimson, strangely bound\n\nWith yellow wreaths, flung o'er its summer hurts,\n\nBy the lascivious jessamine, that, in turn,\n\nCapricious, creeps to the embrace of all.\n\n\"The eye unpain'd with splendor--with unrest\n\nThat mocks the free rapidity of wings,\n\nJust taught to know their uses and go forth,\n\nSeeking range but no employment--hath no quest\n\nThat Beauty leaves unsatisfied. The lull\n\nOf drowsing sounds, from leaf, and stream, and tree\n\nPersuades each sense, and to forgetfulness\n\nBeguiles the impetuous thought. Upon the air\n\nSweetness hangs heavy, like the incense cloud\n\nO'er the high altar, when cathedral rites\n\nAre holiest, and our breathing for a while\n\nGrows half suspended. Sullen, in the sky,\n\nWith legions thick, and banners broad unfurl'd,\n\nThe summer tempest broods. Below him wheels,\n\nLike some fierce trooper of the charging host,\n\nOne fearless vulture. Earth beside us sleeps,\n\nHaving no terror; though an hour may bring\n\nA thousand fiery bolts to break her rest.\n\n\"How natural is the face of woods and vales,\n\nTrees, and the unfailing waters, spite of years,\n\nTime's changes, and the havoc made by storm!\n\nThe change is all in man. Year after year,\n\nI look for the old landmarks on my route,\n\nAnd seldom look in vain. A darker moss\n\nCoats the rough outside of the old gray rock;--\n\nSome broad arm of the oak is wrench'd away,\n\nBy storm and thunder--through the hill-side wears\n\nPage 31\n\nA deeper furrow,--and the streams descend,\n\nSometimes, in wilder torrents than before--\n\nBut still they serve as guides o'er ancient paths,\n\nFor wearied wanderers. Still do they arise,\n\nIn groups of grandeur, an old family,\n\nThese great magnificent trees, that, as I look,\n\nFill me with loftiest thoughts, such as one feels\n\nBeholding the broad wing of some strong bird,\n\nPoised on its centre, motionless in air,\n\nYet sworn its master still. Not in our life,\n\nWhose limit, still inferior, mocks our pride,\n\nReach they this glorious stature. At their feet,\n\nOur young, grown aged like ourselves, may find\n\nTheir final couches, ere one vigorous shaft\n\nYields to the stroke of time. Beneath mine eyes,\n\nAll that makes beautiful this place of peace,\n\nWears the peculiar countenance which first\n\nWon my delight and wonder as I came--\n\nThen scarcely free from boyhood,--wild as he,\n\nThe savage Muscoghee, who, in that day,\n\nWas master of these plains. His hunting range\n\nGrasp'd the great mountains of the Cherokee,\n\nThe Apalachian ridge--extended west\n\nBy Talladega's valleys--by the streams\n\nOf Tallas-hatchie--through the silent woods\n\nOf gray Emuckfau, and where, deep in shades,\n\nRise the clear brooks of Autossee that flow\n\nTo Tallapoosa;--names of infamy\n\nIn Indian chronicle! 'Twas here they fell,\n\nThe numerous youth of Muscoghee,--the strong--\n\nPatriarchs of many a tribe--dark seers renown'd,\n\nAs deeply read in savage mystery--\n\nThe Prophet Monohoee--priest as famed,\n\nAmong his tribe, as any that divined\n\nPage 32\n\nIn Askelon or Ashdod;--stricken to the earth,\n\nBody and spirit, in repeated strife,\n\nWith him, that iron-soul'd old chief, who came\n\nPlunging from Tennessee.\n\n\"Below they stretch'd,\n\nIn sovran mastery o'er the wood and stream,\n\n'Till the last waves of Choctawhatchie slept,\n\nSubsiding, in the gulf. Such was the realm\n\nThey traversed, in that season of my youth,\n\nWhen first beside this pleasant stream I sank,\n\nIn noontide slumber. What is now their realm,\n\nAnd where are now their warriors? Streams that once\n\nSoothed their exhaustion, satisfied their thirst--\n\nWoods that gave shelter--plains o'er which they sped\n\nIn mimic battle--battle-fields whereon\n\nTheir bravest chieftains perish'd--trees that bore\n\nThe fruits they loved but rear'd not;--these remain,\n\nBut yield no answer for the numerous race,--\n\nGone with the summer breezes--with the leaves\n\nOf perish'd autumn;--with the cloud that frowns\n\nThis moment in the heavens, and, ere the night,\n\nBorne forward in the grasp of chainless winds,\n\nIs speeding on to ocean.\n\n\"Wandering still--\n\nThat sterile and most melancholy life,--\n\nThey skirt the turbid streams of Arkansas,\n\nAnd hunt the buffalo to the rocky steeps\n\nOf Saladanha; and, on lonely nooks,\n\nRidge-barrens, build their little huts of clay,\n\nAs frail as their own fortunes. Dreams, perchance,\n\nRestore the land they never more shall see;\n\nOr, in meet recompense, bestow them tracts\n\nPage 33\n\nMore lovely--vast, unmeasured tracts, that lie\n\nBeyond those peaks, that, in the northern heavens,\n\nRise blue and perilous now. There, rich reserves\n\nConsole them in the future for the past;\n\nAnd, with a Christian trust, the Pagan dreams\n\nHis powerful gods will recompense his faith,\n\nBy pleasures, in degree as exquisite\n\nAs the stern suffering he hath well endured.\n\nHis forest fancy, not untaught to soar,\n\nAlready, in his vision of midnight, sees\n\nThe fertile valleys; on his sight arise\n\nHerds of the shadowy deer; and, from the copse,\n\nSlow stealing, he beholds, with eager gaze,\n\nThe spirit-hunter gliding toward his prey,\n\nIn whose lithe form, and practised art, he views\n\nHimself!--a noble image of his youth\n\nThat never more shall fail!\n\n\"We may not share\n\nHis rapture; for if thus the might of change\n\nMocks the great nation, sweeps them from the soil\n\nWhich bore, but could not keep--what is't with us,\n\nWho muse upon their fate? Darkly, erewhile,\n\nThou spok'st of death and change, and I rebuked\n\nThe mood that scorn'd the present good--still fond\n\nTo brood above the past. Yet, in my heart,\n\nGrave feelings rise to chide the undesert,\n\nThat knew not well to use the power I held,\n\nIn craving that to come. Have these short years\n\nWrought thus disastrously upon my strength,\n\nAs on the savage? What have I done to build\n\nMy better home of refuge; where the heart,\n\nBy virtue taught, by conscience made secure,\n\nMay safely find an altar, 'neath whose base\n\nPage 34\n\nThe tempest rocks in vain? The red-man's fate\n\nBelong'd to his performance. They who know\n\nHow to destroy alone, and not to raise,\n\nLeaving a ruin for a monument,\n\nMust perish as the brute. But I was taught\n\nThe nobler lesson, that, for man alone,\n\nThe maker gives the example of his power,\n\nThat he may build on him. What work of life--\n\nThe moral monument of the Christian's toil--\n\nStands, to maintain my memory after death,\n\nAmongst the following footsteps? Sadly, the ear\n\nReceives his question, who, with sadder speech,\n\nMakes his own answer. Unperforming still,\n\nHe yet hath felt the mighty change that moves,\n\nProgressive, as the march of mournful hours,\n\nStill hurrying to the tomb. 'Tis on his cheek,\n\nNo more the cheek of boyhood--in his eye,\n\nThat laughs not with its wonted merriment,\n\nAnd in his secret heart. 'Tis over all\n\nHe sees and feels--o'er all that he hath loved,\n\nAnd fain would love, and must remember still!\n\nThose gray usurpers, Death and Change, have been\n\nFamiliar in his household, and he stands,\n\nOf all that grew around his innocent hearth,\n\nAlone--the last! And this hath made him now\n\nAn exile,--better pleased with woods and streams,\n\nWild ocean, and the rocks that vex his waves,\n\nThan, sitting in the city's porch, to hear\n\nThe hurry, and the thoughtless hum of trade!\n\n\"The charm is broken and the 'Traveller's Rest!'\n\nThe sun no longer beats with noonday heat\n\nAbove the pathway, and the evening bird,\n\nShort wheeling through the air, on whirring wing,\n\nPage 35\n\nCounsels our flight with his. Another draught--\n\nAnd to these pleasant waters--to the groves\n\nThat shelter'd--to the gentle breeze that soothed,\n\nEven as a breath from heaven--to all sweet sights,\n\nMelodious sounds and murmurs, that arise\n\nTo cheer the sadden'd spirit at its need--\n\nBe thanks and blessing; gratitude o'er all,\n\nTo God in the Highest! He it is who guides\n\nThe unerring footstep--prompts the wayward heart\n\nTo kindly office--shelters from the sun--\n\nWithholds the storm,--and, with his leaves and flowers,\n\nSweet freshening streams and ministry of birds,\n\nSustains, and succors, and invigorates;--\n\nTo Him, the praise and homage--Him o'er all!\"\n\nTHE MOCK-BIRD.\n\nWHAT has winter left for thee,\n\nThat, within the ancient tree,\n\nThou dost linger, in thy gray,\n\nSober vestments, like some friar,\n\nHaunting still the old abbaye,\n\nWasted by the strife and fire?\n\nWherefore house thee thus alone,\n\nWhen the other tribes have gone?--\n\nWith them to the forest speed:\n\nLeave to human heart the grief,\n\nThat in woe and dusky weed,\n\nWhen winter twilight's cold and brief,\n\nWalks sad with hooded Thought, through perish'd wood and leaf.\n\nPage 36\n\nSure I know thee!--thou art he,\n\nThat, with reckless minstrelsy,\n\nLately sung--while all the grove,\n\nBy the spring-buds won to joy,\n\nBathed in fragrance, breathed of love--\n\nDitty of a wild annoy;\n\nMocking all with scornful strain,\n\nTill the passion grew to pain,\n\nAnd each humbler warbler fled,\n\nSilent, in his shame and fear,\n\nThou the while, with wing outspread,\n\nSweetly voiced in spite of sneer,\n\nThroned on the topmost bough, or darting wild through air.\n\nThou hast pleasures. I have seen,\n\nWhen the buxom spring was green,\n\nHow thy nest was tended--how\n\nThou didst gather straw and blade,\n\nAnd, within the ancient bough,\n\nSit, the stem and leaf to braid.--\n\nPatient was thy watch, and stern\n\nLesson might the serpent learn,--\n\nCrawling where thy young ones lie,\n\nWith his cruel, keen desire,--\n\nFrom thy eagle-raging eye,\n\nShowing all thy soul on fire,\n\nWhile talon, beak and wing declared the warrior's ire.\n\nPatient, as thy young ones grow,\n\nUse of feeble wings to show,\n\nHow, to glide from bough to bough,\n\nHow with gradual flight, to bear,\n\nPoised on spreading pinion now,\n\nThrough the yielding heart of air;\n\nPage 37\n\nAnd, when free of wing, and high,\n\nWinging, singing, through the sky,--\n\nThen, with thy triumphant strain,\n\nMatchless in unmeasured might,\n\nAs if born of madden'd brain,\n\nEcstasied with deep delight,\n\nWhirling in voice aloft, in far, capricious flight.\n\nWhy the cynic temper?--why\n\nStill that strain of mockery?\n\nArt thou truer? Dost thou sneer,\n\nAs thou haply know'st that none\n\nOf the love songs spring must hear,\n\nSpeaks fidelity but one?\n\nThou art constant--that I know--\n\nTo thy young ones,--to the foe,--\n\nTo thy mate, and to the tree,\n\nThat beside my window-sill,\n\nMany a year, has been to thee\n\nCottage-home and empire still,--\n\nThou wast the sovereign there, and ever hadst thy will.\n\nStill maintain it--thou alone,\n\nOf the birds, when summer's gone,\n\nKeep'st thy dwelling, hold'st thy place,\n\nAs if in thy breast there grew\n\nSomething, which, to human race,\n\nKept thee dedicate and true.\n\nCynical thy song, but mine\n\nMight be cynical like thine,\n\nCould I deem with thee, that all\n\nOf the vows in spring we hear,\n\nWere forgotten by the fall;--\n\nBut I shrink from doubt so drear;--\n\nI yield my heart to faith, and love when thou wouldst sneer.\n\nPage 38\n\nAUTUMN TWILIGHT.\n\nTHERE is a soft haze hanging on you hill,\n\nTinged with a purple light. How beautiful,\n\nAnd yet, how cold! 'Tis the first robe put on,\n\nWith gloomy foretaste of a gloomier hour,\n\nBy the sad Autumn. Well may she repine,--\n\nWith heavy dread of winter at her heart,\n\nAdverse to present sweetness as to hope,\n\nWhich never cheers her fortunes. She is doom'd--\n\nSurvivor of a race that left no heirs,\n\nAnd she, the mourner of the beautiful,\n\nWhose treasure, in the past to which she glides,\n\nWas but a bright decay, a perishing bloom,\n\nThe bounty of a love whose dearest gifts\n\nBest show in desolation. The sweet green,\n\nThe summer flush of love--the golden bloom\n\nThat came with flowers in April, and brought sweets\n\nWhose purity might teach a faith that life\n\nWere also in their breathing--all are gone!\n\nThe green grows pallid--the warm, virgin flush,\n\nThat was in summer's eye, and on her cheek,\n\nA glory all too precious for a dream,--\n\nToo precious far for mortal certainty--\n\nFleets all--as keen, the breezes from the hills\n\nSweep icily o'er the meadows. All the bright hues,\n\nThat graced the flowers and hemispheric crowns\n\nOf trees grown haughty in a birthday dress,\n\nSeem vanishing with the sunset. The last rays\n\nThat drink their purple brightness with their lives,\n\nFade upwards through the forest--a sad flush,\n\nThat lothly leaves the twilight, and a while\n\nLingers upon the hill-tops, as surveying\n\nPage 39\n\nThe empires that it forfeits. Now the winds,\n\nSlow rising as from caverns of the night,\n\nWith trailing robes of darkness, and broad arms,\n\nStretched out, in action suited to the dirge\n\nThat speaks the mournful ruin of their homes,\n\nWail heavily through the branches; while the leaves,\n\nSaddest of mourners! flung on summer's grave,\n\nLament her in the silence of true grief!\n\nAh! mock me not that thus I mourn with them;\n\nThe sad heart's wisdom is to weep enough!--\n\nI hear your lesson, but of what avail?\n\nSince, while it teaches worthlessness of grief,\n\nIt still acknowledges the pregnant cause\n\nThat, in the very uselessness of tears,\n\nCompels our tears most freely. You discourse,\n\nTo feeling, with a counsel that prevents\n\nAll feeling; and unless you stifle her,\n\nYou teach most idly. Never yet was grief\n\nFit moralist,--and that philosophy,\n\nWhich will not take its color from the heart\n\nIt seeks to fortify against the cloud,\n\nReaches no sacred chord of sympathy,\n\nResponsive with sweet echoes. All your laws\n\nTeach sorrow when you teach her hopelessness.\n\nTo bid the sacred current cease to flow,\n\n'Tis needful first you freeze it; and what gain,\n\nTo him with dear affections, o'er whose grave,\n\nHe still encourages dear memories,\n\nThat feeling should be made secure from hurt,\n\nBy gross and cold insensibility?\n\nForegoing nature, what do we acquire\n\nBut forfeiture? As well persuade the flower\n\nTo grow to stone, lest, rifled by the storm,\n\nIts premature bloom shall perish. If unwise\n\nPage 40\n\nTo yield to sorrow the sole sovereignty,\n\nAs little wise to substitute for this,\n\nThe apathy, that, still rejecting grief,\n\nGrows ignorant of all rapture. You declaim--\n\nWith the grave studied eloquence of books,\n\nWrit by cold monks in the ascetic cell,\n\nThat life is full of changes.--Be it so!\n\nThese changes ever are from joy to woe,\n\nAnd woe to joy again. To conquer one\n\nIs scarce to know the other. In your calm,\n\n'Tis easy to declare that things of life,\n\nBy the inevitable laws of things,\n\nAre also things of death; but not the less\n\nFind we a sacred certainty of grief,\n\nEven in this very knowledge. Death, you say,\n\nStill harvests forms that love, not less than forms\n\nThat simply live; and folly 'tis to mourn,\n\nThat the dear life whose presence was a joy\n\nAnd fragrance, that forever brought us joy,\n\nIs destined to as sure an apathy\n\nAs the poor flowers we tread on.\n\nHappy he,\n\nPerchance--and yet I think not--who can thus\n\nProse calmly over nature, and the fate\n\nOf her dear offspring in whatever fields.\n\nBut mine is not this happiness;--nor mine,\n\nThe thought that happiness may light her fire,\n\nFrom such dry chips of doctrine. The rich sap,\n\nMay from the wounded tree gush forth in tears,\n\nThe green rind feel its hurts, and something lose\n\nOf verdure in the injury which it feels.\n\nBut teach the bough, how better were it lopt,\n\nAnd flung into the fire, than suffering thus,\n\nFrom the keen hurts of the too wanton axe\n\nPage 41\n\nThe wound will heal. You point me to the scars;\n\nBut while it still hath rind for newer hurts,\n\nAnd fresh sap still to flow from other wounds,\n\nThe scars are but in proof of strength to bear,\n\nAs well as hurts to suffer. Tears, for me,\n\nBring sweet relief for what is lost or borne,\n\nAs teaching still of sensibilities\n\nFor future feeling; whether joy or woe,\n\nOr gain or loss;--and, in this consciousness,\n\nOne finds a better solace for the past,\n\nThan in that cold philosophy which stills\n\nThe too susceptible pulse, lest it should throb,\n\nSome day, with fever. Yet, that fever throb,\n\nItself, declares the warm vitality\n\nStill looking forth with hope.\n\nAnd still you chide,\n\nThat grief should waste upon inferior things,\n\nLeaves of the forest, flowers of the summer day,\n\nFruits of a season's tribute, and frail fancies\n\nBorn of the dew and sunshine, for the hour,\n\nThe sorrows that might find excuse, if given\n\nFor loss of human treasure--forms and greatness,\n\nWhich fill society with sense of virtue,\n\nAnd still commend to love that fierce ambition\n\nThat makes even love a sacrifice in turn!\n\nAlas! we know not what is worthy, what is great,\n\nAnd weep from fancy, rather than from law;\n\nAnd fancy is a law, and in our feelings\n\nHath charter'd rights, and shapes them at her pleasure,\n\nTo make us weep, if need be; tears and sorrows\n\nBeing as much her proper properties,\n\nAs sunshine and gay laughter, sport and flight.\n\nYet have I something of a plea beyond,\n\nIn the condition which has shut me out\n\nPage 42\n\nFrom much, that, in the common social life,\n\nCommends itself unto humanity,\n\nAs only worth its care. Mine was a lot\n\nPeculiar in its loneliness of aim,\n\nIf not distinction. Childhood found me first\n\nA sad bewilder'd orphan--one who stood\n\nAlone among his fellow,--and when wrong'd,\n\nKnew not the lap in which to hide his head,\n\nNor friendly ear in which to pour complaint.\n\nI had no parent's tendance. Never mine\n\nA sister's lips have hallow'd while they press'd;--\n\nNo brother call'd me his;--no natural ties\n\nEmbraced, and train'd, and cherish'd my wild youth,\n\nWhich still went erring into devious ways,\n\nSorrowing as much as sinning, in a mood\n\nThat craved love only for its guide to goodness;--\n\nAnd this alone it found not--or in vain!--\n\nAnd thus, with strong affections, still in exile,\n\nDenied where they sought favor, I have turn'd\n\nTo the inanimate, unspeaking creatures,\n\nThat grew about or wanton'd in my path--\n\nHaving no scorn or hatred in their hearts--\n\nHaving no voice of censure on their tongues--\n\nFor that most needed sympathy of nature,\n\nWhich answer'd best the hunger in my heart.\n\nThus were my footsteps won into the forest,\n\nThus did I seek these groves as if in worship,\n\nWith regular tendance, and a meek observance,\n\nThat suffer'd not the chant of winds, the sighing,\n\nThat seem'd most human, in the pine's great branches,--\n\nThe fall of leaf, the shadows of the thicket,\n\nOr flutter of the gay bird o'er the pathway,--\n\nTo 'scape me;--moralizing at each motion,\n\nSomething, that as it soothed the troubled feeling,\n\nPage 43\n\nWas surely not philosophy. My rambles\n\nStill brought me what I sought;--and these pale flowers,\n\nAnd the green leaves, now yellow, at our feet,\n\nWere something more to me than leaves and flowers.\n\nThey were my kindred. Now, that they are gone,\n\nI weep them as a loss of family,\n\nAnd tread among them with a cautious step,\n\nA sad, slow motion, and with trembling heart,\n\nAs I were reading, in some ancient church-yard,\n\nThe names of dear ones precious to my childhood.\n\nBALLAD.\n\nOH! bury him quickly, and utter no word\n\nOf the memory sadden'd by sorrow so long;\n\nBut when the cold stranger shall say that he err'd,\n\nThen tell the dark tale of his crueller wrong.\n\nWe may not approve, but when others condemn,\n\n'Twere crime that defence of his heart to forbear,\n\nAnd show that his faults were all prompted by them,--\n\nThey could goad him to danger, then fly from him then\n\nYou saw him for many long days ere he fell,\n\nIn chains and in solitude, sad but serene;\n\n'Tis grateful to know that he battled it well,\n\nWhile his spirit grew strong in the gloom of the scene.\n\nThey thought him all callous to feeling and shame,--\n\nAh! little they knew him;--the spirit he bore\n\nOnce aim'd at, and sigh'd for, as lofty a fame\n\nAs shines on the pages of history's lore.\n\nPage 44\n\nBut pile the dank sod which no stone shall adorn,\n\nNo hand ever freshen with shrub or with flower;\n\nWe bury him coldly--we leave him forlorn--\n\nAnd midnight was never more dark than this hour.\n\nIt is but a year since all proudly he stood,\n\nBrave, bright, unassuming--the sought, the preferr'd--\n\nUpheld by the strong, and beloved by the good--\n\nNow--bury him quickly, and utter no word!\n\nHAST THOU A SONG FOR A FLOWER.\n\nI.\n\nHAST thou a song for a flower,\n\nSuch as, if breathed in its ear,\n\nWould waken in beauty's own bower\n\nThe spirit most fit to be there?\n\nThen, minstrel, I challenge thy power--\n\nSuch song, if thou hast, sing it here!--\n\nHere, where the breeze o'erwearied,\n\nWith his travel o'er ocean creeps,\n\nAnd on the green leaf by her lattice,\n\nSinks languidly down and sleeps.\n\nII.\n\nFor her the sweet music thou bringest\n\nMust in a true spirit be wrought,\n\nAnd the passion of mine thou singest\n\nMust be pure as the child's first thought.\n\nIf none such within thee springest,\n\nAway, for thy presence is naught. Page 45\n\nFar better the breeze, at waking,\n\nShould tell her that hopeless I come,\n\nWith itself, to the leaf at her lattice,\n\nAnd laid me down, dreaming but dumb.\n\nENIGMA.\n\nI AM most potent of all earthly powers,\n\nSave one. I penetrate the loftiest towers,\n\nAs freely as the cottage, in all hours;\n\nI paralyze the strongest with a spell;\n\nSoothe the most suffering; shut the fatal knell\n\nFrom out the ears of misery; beguile\n\nThe saddest mourner to a hopeful smile;\n\nBring cheerful guests into the solitude,\n\nThat minister unto the sufferer's mood,\n\nSo that he straight forgets what gave him pain,\n\nAnd wins the strength and hope of youth again.\n\nNo will can combat mine, no might withstand;\n\nAnd man before me bows throughout the land,\n\nAs at a tyrant's progress; yet with joy,\n\nFor that I sway to succor, not destroy.\n\nYet, do I arm myself with terrors still,\n\nWhen they are needful. I can bring the thrill,\n\nOf fear or horror, to the guilty soul,\n\nAnd make him hear the far-off thunders roll,\n\nAs at his feet; can swift around him group,\n\nEven at a whisper, a most terrible troop\n\nOf his assailing enemies. My spell,\n\nMost strong when softest, is invincible.\n\nYou strive with me in vain. I stretch a wing,\n\nPage 46\n\nUnseen above you. In your ears I sing,\n\nIn most unnoted accents. Round your neck\n\nI weave such subtle chains as never break,\n\nSave with my satisfied purpose. Your white breast,\n\nYou do unfold me, whether as a guest,\n\nObtrusive, or implored and much caress'd.\n\nYou may not shut from me your secret thought,\n\nYour passion or your guilt. Unask'd, unsought,\n\nYou whisper to me your best hope and fear,\n\nWhat you endure of grief, what joys endear,\n\nAnd whom you love and hate. And I, who hear,\n\nStill keep your secret;--to your service bound,\n\nStill faithful, still unbidden, I am found,\n\nWhene'er the season calls me, or the place;\n\nAn angel you may hold me, or a grace;\n\nDevoted as the first, and as the last,\n\nStill blessing--though the sights I bring may blast!\n\nMy bond of service never shall be broke,\n\nTill I no more may spell, or thou invoke,\n\nThen, when perforce I leave thee, I resign\n\nThy charge to one, a kinswoman of mine,\n\nOf greater powers, but hostile still to thine.\n\nSONNET.\n\nSYMPATHY BETWEEN THE PAST AND FUTURE.\n\nWOULD we go forward boldly, and gain heart\n\nFor farther progress, we must pause a while,\n\nAnd gaze upon the path, for many a mile,\n\nWe follow'd when we first grew bold to start;--\n\nThat so much has been traversed, is a goad\n\nPage 47\n\nTo fresh endeavor; and the eye grows bright,\n\nWith expectation, as the baffled sight\n\nWould vainly compass all the o'er-trodden road;--\n\nThe pathways of the future will grow clear,\n\nWhen the first fresh beginnings of the march\n\nLie bright beneath the broad and sheltering arch;\n\nAnd, repossess'd of childhood, we are near\n\nHeaven's sources,--for the true humanity\n\nKeeps past and future still in either eye.\n\nTO THE BREEZE.\n\nAFTER A PROTRACTED CALM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.\n\nI.\n\nTHOU com'st at last! Our sorrow is at end;\n\nThou com'st, and hast our blessing, pleasant breeze.\n\nYet where hast thou been wandering, fickle friend?\n\nWhere, when the midnight gather'd to her brow\n\nHer pale and silent minister, wast thou?\n\nOn what far, sullen, solitary seas,\n\nPiping the mariner's requiem, didst thou tend\n\nThe home-returning bark,\n\nCurling the white foam o'er her plunging prow,--\n\nWhite, when the rolling waves about her all were dark?\n\nII.\n\nAh! thou didst woo her sweetly as she lay,\n\nStill idly rocking on the unconscious deep;\n\nThou sought'st her with a breath\n\nOf spicy odor from Sonora's vales; Page 48\n\nAnd, with the sweetest of imploring gales,\n\nThat seem'd like life to death,\n\nFilling her yellow sails,\n\nBeguiled her on her way.\n\nWith sudden voice, like that of mountain bird\n\nSinging, thou wok'st her from her dreary sleep,\n\nUntil her every pulse of life grew stirr'd:\n\nHer fluttering pennant was the first to fly,\n\nThen the great vans swell'd out delightedly,\n\nAnd, with the song of land he loves to hear,\n\nThou bad'st the mariner cheer!\n\nIII.\n\nOh! well thou know'st the mission that is thine,\n\nAnd, when in sluggish bonds old ocean slept,\n\nMaking of life no sign,--\n\nWhile the faint moaning o'er his breast that crept\n\nSeem'd like the breathings of eternity\n\nAbove the grave of the unburied Time,--\n\nThen didst thou clothe thyself in wings of prime,\n\nThen speed thy work of mercy.--How the tar,\n\nHis form reclined along the burning deck,\n\nStretch'd ever more his eager eye afar,\n\nStill watching for thy coming--for the speck,\n\nMarking thy shadow, from some giant steep,\n\nDown darting to the embraces of the deep!\n\nIV.\n\nLate, but not faithless to thy charge, thy flight\n\nSoon came to bless his sight.\n\nSo long a fond and watching worshipper,\n\nHe knew to hail thy coming, nor to err,\n\nNo matter what thy shape, or whence thy wing. Page 49\n\nThou wert his passion. By the dearest names\n\nHe did implore thy presence: \"My sweet breeze,\n\nWhither! oh whither!\"--I have heard him sing\n\nRudely, but with a strength that feeling tames\n\nTo fondness in rough natures--\"My delight!\n\nWhere art thou--where, oh! beauty of the seas,--\n\nMy breeze, my pleasant breeze!\"\n\nV.\n\nWere all the charms by mortal passion sung\n\nAs worthy of the tongue!\n\nAh! breath of life to nature, thou art sure\n\nThe image of that ever young and pure,\n\nSuperior spirit, which, when all was dim,\n\nEre yet creation sang her choral hymn,\n\nAnd darkness brooded o'er the stagnant deep,\n\nMoved on the waters, waking them from sleep,\n\nAnd rousing them to purposes of Him\n\nFor whom all wings have flight!\n\nBorn in the solemn night,\n\nEre skies had birth in bright,\n\nWith uncreated watchers for the sight,--\n\nThine was the music, through the firmament\n\nBy the fond nature sent,\n\nTo hail the happy birth,\n\nAnd guide to sea and earth\n\nThe glorious wing, the blessing eye of light!\n\nVI.\n\nMusic to us no less,\n\nThou com'st in our distress,\n\nTo ope the pathway, all made clear by thee,\n\nThrough the wide waste of sea! Page 50\n\nSoothing, thou bring'st to him who goes alone\n\nUnwatch'd and unremember'd o'er the wave,\n\nPerchance his grave!\n\nShould he there perish, to thy simple moan\n\nWhat hope to add, from human tenderness,\n\nOne fond imploring tone!\n\nVII.\n\nI bless thee, gentle breeze!\n\nSweet minister to many a fond desire,\n\nThou bear'st me to my sire,\n\nThou, and these rolling seas!\n\nWhat, O dear God of this great element,\n\nAre we before thee, that its breath is sent,\n\nObedient to young love and eager hope?\n\nBut that its pinion with our path is blent,\n\nWe had been doom'd, blind, weak, and dark, to grope,\n\nWhere plummet's cast is vain, and human art\n\nLacking all chart!\n\nLYRICAL BALLAD.\n\nIF the fruit of the tree was delicious,\n\nYet how keen was the bitter it brought;\n\nAs the zephyr, though sweet, is capricious,\n\nWith blight as with luxury fraught:\n\nWho roves in a garden, ungrateful\n\nFor the tendance that nourish'd its bloom?\n\nBetter fly to the wilderness hateful,\n\nWhere nothing is false but the gloom!\n\nPage 51\n\nWe are still the vain creatures of vision,\n\nWhere the eyes only torture the soul;\n\nOur worship still meets with derision,\n\nAnd we gain, but by flying the goal.\n\nHe dreams not, the victim, self-banish'd\n\nFrom the shrine which has mock'd at his prayer,\n\nThat 'tis only when pleasure has vanish'd\n\nHe safely may harbor with Care!\n\nThe doubt that still hangs o'er the dreaming,\n\nSpoils the rapture that follows its show;\n\nAs the flash of the lightning, whose gleaming\n\nReveals the deep blackness below:\n\nThe spirit of Love, thus, in flying,\n\nStill glooms the sad Being it woos,\n\nAnd finds its best solace in sighing,\n\nWith a doubt of the heart it subdues!\n\nTHE NEW MOON.\n\n\"BEND thy bow, Dian! shoot thy silver shaft\n\nThrough the dark bosom of yon murky cloud,\n\nThat, like a shroud,\n\nHangs heavy o'er the dwelling of sweet night!\"\n\nAnd the sky laugh'd,\n\nEven as I spake the words; and, in the west,\n\nThe columns of her mansion shone out bright!\n\nA glory hung above Eve's visible brow,\n\nThe maiden empress!--and she glided forth\n\nIn beauty, looking down on the tranced earth,\n\nPage 52\n\nSo fondly, that its rivulets below\n\nGush'd out to hail her, as if then first blest\n\nWith the soft motion of their voiceless birth.\n\nA sudden burst of brightness o'er me broke--\n\nThe rugged crags of the dull cloud were cleft\n\nBy her sharp arrow, and the edges left,--\n\nHow sweetly wounded!--silver'd with the stroke;\n\nThus making a fit pathway for her march\n\nThrough the blue arch!\n\nFOREST REVERIE BY STARLIGHT.\n\nTHE night has settled down. A dewy hush\n\nHangs o'er the forest, save when fitful gusts\n\nVex the tall pines with murmurs. Spring is here,\n\nWith breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,\n\nAnd voice of many minstrels. Balmy airs\n\nCreep gently to my bosom, and beguile\n\nEach feeling into freshness. I will forth,\n\nAnd gaze upon the stars--the uncounted stars--\n\nHolding high watch in heaven--still high, still bright,\n\nThough the storm gathers round the sacred hill,\n\nAnd shakes the cottage roof-tree. There they shine,\n\nIn well-remember'd youth. They bear me back,\n\nWith strange persuasiveness, to the old time\n\nAnd happy hours of boyhood. There's no change\n\nIn all their virgin glory. Clouds that roll,\n\nAnd congregate in the azure deeps of heaven,\n\nIn wild debate and darkness, pass away,\n\nLeaving them bright in the same beauty still,\n\nDefying, in the progress of the years,\n\nPage 53\n\nAll change; and rising ever from the night,\n\nIn soft and dewy splendor as at first,\n\nWhen, golden footprints of the Eternal steps,\n\nThey paved the walks of heaven, and grew to eyes\n\nBeckoning the feet of man. Ah! would his eyes\n\nBehold them, with meet yearning to pursue\n\nThe holy heights they counsel! Would his soul\n\nClaim kindred with the happy forms that now\n\nWalk by their blessed guidance--walk in heaven,\n\nIn paths of the Good Shepherd! Then were earth\n\nDeserving of their beauty: then were man,\n\nAlready following, step by step, their points\n\nTo the One Presence--at each onward step\n\nLeaving new lights that cheer his brother on,\n\nIn a like progress. Happily they shine,\n\nAs in his hours of music and of youth,\n\nWhen every breath of the fresh-coming breeze,\n\nAnd every darting vision of the cloud,\n\nGleam of the day and glimmer of the night,\n\nBrought to the craving spirit harmony,\n\nAnd bless'd each fond assurance of the hope\n\nWith sweetest confirmation. Still they shine,\n\nAnd dear the story of their early prime--\n\nAnd his--the conscious worshipper may read\n\nIn their enduring presence. Happiest tales\n\nOf innocence and joy, events and hours,\n\nThat never more return. These they record,\n\nRenew and hallow, with their own pure rays,\n\nWhen blight of age is on the frame--when grief\n\nWeighs the vex'd heart to earth--when all beside,\n\nThe father, and the mother, and the friend,\n\nSpeak in decaying syllables--dread proof\n\nOf worse decay!--and that sad chronicler,\n\nFeeble and failing in excess of years,\n\nPage 54\n\nOld Memory, tottering from his mossy cell,\n\nStops with the imperfect legend on his lips,\n\nAnd drowses into dream. No change like this\n\nFalls on their golden-eyed veracity,\n\nTakes from the silvery truths that line their lips,\n\nOr stales their lovely aspects. Well they know\n\nThe years they never feel; see, without dread,\n\nThe storm that rises and the bolt that falls,\n\nThe age that chills, the apathy that chokes,\n\nThe death that withers all that blooms below,\n\nYet smile they on as ever, sweetly bright,\n\nSerene, in their security from all\n\nThe change that troubles man!\n\nYet, hill and tree\n\nChange with the season--with the alter'd heart,\n\nAnd weak and withering muscle. Ancient groves,\n\nThat shelter'd me in childhood, have given place\n\nTo gaudy gardens; and the solemn oaks,\n\nThat heard the first prayers of my youthful heart\n\nFor greatness, and a life beyond their own--\n\nLo! in their stead, a maiden's slender hand\n\nTutors green vines, and purple buds, and flowers,\n\nAs frail as her own fancies. At each step\n\nI miss some old companion of my walks,\n\nMemorial of the happy hours of youth,\n\nWhose presence had brought back a thousand joys,\n\nAnd images that took the shape of joys--\n\nThe loveliest masquers, and all innocent--\n\nThat vanish'd with the rest. I would recall,\n\nBut vainly, each lost presence; and the sigh\n\nThat mourns the dear memorials now no more,\n\nCounsels desires that to the mortal eye\n\nCommend no mortal images. The thought\n\nPage 55\n\nGrasps vainly, right and left, whereon to hold,\n\nAnd droops, as one grown hopeless of support,\n\nThat once, with native strength for every strife,\n\nScorn'd succor from without. The earth denies\n\nHer bosom for repose--the shade is gone\n\nThat offer'd grateful shelter to the eye;\n\nAnd the dear aspects, which had each its birth\n\nTwinn'd with some proud affection,--they depart,\n\nIn mournful robes of shadow that disguise\n\nEach lineament of love.\n\nAh! not with these,\n\nThe perishing things that suffer from decay,\n\nSeek we the sweet memorials of our youth--\n\nThe youth that seem'd immortal--youth that bloom'd\n\nWith hues and hopes of heaven,--firing its heart\n\nWith aspirations for eternal life,\n\nPerpetual triumphs, and the ambitious thirst\n\nStill for new fields and empires of domain!\n\nIn tokens of the soul--that craving thirst\n\nThat earth supplies not--in the undying things,\n\nThat man can never change--that mock his fate\n\nWith never-changing sweet serenity,\n\nAssured of a security that builds\n\nUpon the steadfast rock, 'gainst which the storm\n\nBeats through successive ages, but to prove\n\nHow fast its bulwarks--how eternally\n\nSunk in the innate principle of things,\n\nIt draws, as to the inevitable heart,\n\nIts growth from all the rest!--to these we turn\n\nFor the memorials precious to our youth:--\n\nThat season when the Fancy is a god--\n\nHope a conviction--Love an instinct--Truth,\n\nThe generous friend that ever by our side,\n\nPage 56\n\nHath still the sweetest story for the ear,\n\nAnd wins us on our way!\n\nAh! stars,--though taught,\n\nThat ye too, in the inevitable doom,\n\nMust perish like the rest--grow dim and fade,\n\nHaving no eyes of beauty for the eyes\n\nThat look to ye in beauty--yet your light\n\nBrings back all boyhood's blessings! In my heart\n\nStand up the old divinities anew.\n\nI hear their well-known voices, see their eyes\n\nShining once more in mine, and straight forget\n\nThat I have wept their loss in many tears,\n\nMix'd with reproaches--bitter, sad regrets,\n\nSelf-chidings, and the memory of wrongs,\n\nEndured, inflicted, suffer'd, and avenged!\n\nAs I behold ye now, ye bring me back\n\nThe treasures of my boyhood. All is mine\n\nThat I had once surrender'd. Scarce a scene\n\nOf childish prank or merriment, but comes,\n\nWith all the freshness of the infant time,\n\nBack to my recollection. The old school,\n\nThe noisy rabble, the tumultuous cries--\n\nThe green, remember'd in the wintry day,\n\nFor the encounter of the flying ball--\n\nThe marble play, the hoop, the top, the kite,\n\nAnd, when the ambition prompted higher games,\n\nThe battle-array and conflict--friends and foes\n\nMix'd in the wild melée, with shouts of might\n\nTriumphant o'er the clamors of retreat!\n\nThese, in their regular seasons, with their deeds,\n\nTheir incidents of happiness or pain,\n\nPage 57\n\nIn the revival of old memories,\n\nYour lovely lights restore: nor these alone!\n\nThe chroniclers of riper years ye grow,\n\nAnd loftier thoughts and fancies; when my heart\n\nFirst took ye for sweet counsellors, and loved\n\nTo wander in your evening lights, and dream\n\nOf other eyes that watch'd ye from afar,\n\nAt the same hour--and of another heart\n\nThat gush'd in yearning sympathy with mine!\n\nAnd, as the years flew by--as I became\n\nWarier, yet more devoted--fix'd and strong--\n\nGrowing in the affections and the thoughts\n\nWhen growth had ceased in stature--then, when life,\n\nWing'd with impetuous passions, darted by--\n\nAnd voices grew into a spell, that hung,\n\nThrough the dim hours of night, about the heart,\n\nMaking it tremble strangely;--when dark eyes\n\nWere planets, having power upon the soul,\n\nAs fated, dimly, at nativity;--\n\nAnd older men were monitors too dull\n\nFor passionate youth,--and all our oracles\n\nWere still mysterious counsellors to love,\n\nAnd faith, and confident trust for all who brought\n\nThe meet credential of a faith like ours,\n\nGushing with sweetest overflow, and fond\n\nOf its own tears and weaknesses.--Ah! then,\n\nHow precious was your language! What dear strains\n\nOf promise ye pour'd forth,--in sounds that made\n\nThe impatient soul leap upward into flight,\n\nThe skies stoop down and yield to every wish,\n\nWhile earth, embraced by heaven, instinct with love,\n\nAnd blessing, had forgot all fears of death!\n\nPage 58\n\nThe brightness of your age, in every change,\n\nMocks that which palsies man. Dim centuries\n\nThat saw your fresh beginnings with delight,\n\nAre swallow'd in the ocean-flood of years,\n\nOr crowd with ruin the gray sands of Time,\n\nWho still, with appetite and thirst unslaked--\n\nActive but unappeased--voracious still,\n\nMust swallow what remains. Sweet images,\n\nWhose memories wake our song--whose forms abide--\n\nThe heart's ideal standards of delight--\n\nAre gone to people those dim realms of shade,\n\nWhere rules the Past--that sovereign, single-eyed,\n\nWhose back is on the sun!\n\nAh! when all these--\n\nThe joys we have recorded, and the forms\n\nWhose very names were blessings--forms of youth,\n\nOf childhood, and the hours we know not twice,\n\nWhich won us first, and carried us away\n\nTo strange conceits of coming happiness,\n\nBut to be thought on as delusions all,\n\nYet such delusions as we still must love!--\n\nWhen these have parted from us--when the sky\n\nHath lost the charm of its ethereal blue,\n\nAnd the nights lose their freshness--and the trees\n\nNo longer have a welcome shade for love--\n\nAnd the moon wanes into a paler bright,\n\nAnd all the poetry that stirr'd the leaves,\n\nAnd all the perfume that was on the flowers--\n\nMusic upon the winds--wings in the void--\n\nThe carpeted valley's wealth of green--the dew\n\nThat morning flings on the enamell'd moss--\n\nThe hill-side, the acclivity, the grove--\n\nSweeter that Solitude is sleeping there!--\n\nPage 59\n\nAre gone, as the last hope of misery:--\n\nWhen the last dream of a deluded life\n\nHath left us to awaken--not to feel\n\nThe golden morning, but the appalling night,\n\nWhen sight itself is weariness, and hope\n\nNo longer rifles from the barren path\n\nOne flower of promise!--when disease is nigh,\n\nAnd every bone is racking--and the thought\n\nIs of dry, nauseous, ineffectual drugs,\n\nWhich we must painfully swallow--but in vain--\n\nAnd not a hand is nigh to quench the thirst\n\nWith one poor cup of water,--or our prayer\n\nIs answer'd with indifferent mood, that shows\n\nThe moderate service irksome--when the eye\n\nStrains for the closing heavens, and the fair sky\n\nWhich it is losing,--and dread images,\n\nMeetly successive, of the sable pall,\n\nThe melancholy carriage, and the clod,\n\nMake us to shudder with a stifling fear;--\n\nWhen we have bade adieu to earthly things,\n\nFought through that long last struggle, still the worst,\n\nWrestling with self,--and winning that best boon,\n\nOf resignation to the sovereign will,\n\nWe may no longer baffle or delude,--\n\nAnd offer'd up our prayer of penitence,\n\nDoubtful of its acceptance, yet prepared,\n\nAs well as our condition will admit,\n\nFor the last change in an unhappy life!--\n\nOh! then methinks 'twould still rejoice mine eyes,\n\nWould they throw wide my casement, and permit\n\nA last fond gaze upon the placid sky,\n\nAnd all the heavenly watchers which have seen\n\nMy fair beginning, and my rising youth,\n\nAnd my tall manhood. Oh! dear friend that hear'st\n\nPage 60\n\nThis chant--thy office may be soon to ask,\n\nHow shall I soothe the suffering which I see?--\n\nWith what sweet service to the friend I love,\n\nBut have not power to save, prepare his couch,\n\nAnd robe him for his rest? Think of this song,\n\nAnd of thy own sweet thoughts and sympathies.\n\nGive him to see the blessed skies--the Night--\n\nHer azure garments glowing with great eyes,\n\nThat look on him with love;--and, at the hour\n\nWhich brings thee to thy parting, it will glad\n\nThy heart, in that sad struggle, to behold\n\nTheir sweet serene of smiles. 'Twill bear thee back,\n\nWith all the current of thy better thoughts,\n\nTo the pure practice of thy innocent years.--\n\nRepentant, then, of errors, evil deeds,\n\nImaginings of darkness, thou wilt weep\n\nOver thy recollections; and thy tears,\n\nThe purest tribute of thy contrite heart,\n\nWill be as a sweet prayer sent up to heaven!\n\nINSCRIPTION FOR THERMOPYLÆ.\n\nSTRANGER! thou stand'st upon Thermopylæ!\n\nThe pass that led into the heart of Greece,\n\nBut gave no passage save through greater hearts:\n\nThey keep it still.--Their graves are at thy feet.\n\nPage 61\n\nBY THE EDISTO.\n\nRIVER, that still go'st brightly,\n\nThough sweeping to the sea,\n\nAnd chantest daily, nightly,\n\nThy own dirge-melody;\n\nMethinks thy murmur strengthens\n\nThe purpose in my soul,\n\nAnd, as thy progress lengthens,\n\nI seem to see my goal.\n\nI seek, as thou, the ocean,\n\nGreat sea of human life,\n\nWon by its wild commotion,\n\nAnd striving with its strife:\n\nVainly, we fondly linger\n\nWhere green shades woo our stay;\n\nWe both obey a finger\n\nThat points us on our way.\n\nYet, downward as thou rovest,\n\nHow glad thy waters make\n\nThe green banks which thou lovest,\n\nAnd the zephyrs where they wake!\n\nThey wake among thy willows,\n\nAnd they laugh with welcome still,\n\nAs thy downward-lapsing billows\n\nLift their lilies with a thrill.\n\nThe blue-bird stoops to carol,\n\nAs thy glittering streams go by,\n\nAnd the bay-tree and the laurel\n\nBend above thee with a sigh;\n\nPage 62\n\nBut the sigh is of a pleasure\n\nThat may take no wilder voice;\n\nAnd the great pines share the treasure,\n\nAnd, to welcome thee, rejoice.\n\nIf thus my course may gladden\n\nWhile I hurry to the deep,\n\nSure my heart shall never sadden\n\nWhen 'tis swallow'd up in sleep;\n\nI, too, shall hear sweet voices,\n\nThat requite me as I run,\n\nAnd the pleasant thought rejoices,\n\nI shall only grieve when gone.\n\nTHE APPROACH OF SUMMER.\n\nNow, darting through green leaves, and bringing flowers,\n\nFresh blooming, borrow'd from a thousand bowers\n\nWhere nature fills her lap with fruits, and gleams\n\nThe carpet of the prairies, stars and streams,--\n\nComes forth, all wantoning in joyous dreams,\n\nWith eye that laughs in beauty, golden hair,\n\nCurling and floating o'er a neck as fair\n\nAs the young moon, when in the dusky vale\n\nShe lifts her virgin crescent, soft and pale,--\n\nThe flush'd and revelling Summer. At her glance\n\nSinks the old wizard, Winter, into trance;\n\nNo more the mighty potentate, who shook\n\nHis icy sceptre over field and brook,\n\nPage 63\n\nBut, tottering into apathy, that goes,\n\nSoulless and sad, to polar home of snows;\n\nThe realm usurp'd made glad in his decline,\n\nMade free to bourgeon in its flower and vine;\n\nThe steel-bound waters rescued where he lay,\n\nAnd leaping, flashing, to the smiles of day,\n\nWith all their little billows out at play;--\n\nBirds gladsome singing round the cottage tree,\n\nAnd hope and heart, for once, at liberty,\n\nMingling in joyous anthems which make air\n\nAll musical with love, that might be prayer.\n\nGive the heart freedom! Let the soul take wing\n\nWith the soft promise of the golden Spring;\n\nFrom book and study, forth;--uplift the eye\n\nTo the blue beauties in the morning sky;\n\nForget that Toil hath had his task decreed,\n\nThe daily labor, for the daily need;\n\nGive Hope new charm in respite from its chain,\n\nThought fresher impulse in unlaboring brain;\n\nNo duty rules that Drudgery shall not find\n\nSome moments grateful to the unfetter'd mind;\n\nThe heart's sweet Sabbath must not be denied,\n\nNow, when boon Nature smiles on all beside!\n\nWhere the winds play,--where great green branches wave.\n\nAnd lilies softly lapse upon the wave,--\n\nForth with the Sun, with heart that sings within,\n\nIn sense of joy that hath no taint of sin;\n\nA song of Summer born, that feels, instinct,\n\nHow near with Earth the soul of man is link'd,\n\nAnd thus through earth with heaven, that still foreshows,\n\nIn bright, sweet symbols, how the future glows,\n\nHow freshly, gladsomely, and purely Bliss\n\nMay yet, in man's true life, atone for this!\n\nPage 64\n\nSpirits of holiest gift have been at range,\n\nO'er stream and forest, to effect this change;--\n\nWhat potent spells, what breath of balm, they brought,\n\nBy which the magic of this birth was wrought;--\n\nHow did they whisper on the bankside, where\n\nLurk'd all the hooded flowers, in shame and fear;\n\nHush'd through long months of winter, while the sway\n\nOf that cold tyrant threaten'd still his prey,\n\n'Till that warm whisper to the clod which hid,\n\nBrought each sweet virgin to unclose her lid,\n\nAnd won the nun-like daisy from her cell,\n\nIn sweet obedience to the grateful spell,--\n\nBlessing the shrine that shelter'd her so well!\n\nWhat legions of bright angels, far and wide,\n\nHave sped, that earth should waken up in pride;\n\nA single breath, one short sweet night--the moon\n\nOf April only watching through its noon--\n\nAnd, with the dawn, how wondrous was the show\n\nThat hail'd the sun from thousand plains below;\n\nWith song,--though faint, how sweet!--and scents so rare,\n\nAs if the flowers were wedded to the air,\n\nThat nothing did but drink of the delight,\n\nWith wings diffused in never-resting flight,\n\nAs conscious, in the rapture of such taste,\n\nOf no fatigue, in all that world of waste.\n\nOh! with a range as wide as his, we speed\n\nTo each fair empire of the newly freed;\n\nWith hearts as free as any of the race,\n\nThat glow and gladden in the sun's embrace.\n\nHow spreads the various picture as we go!\n\nHills greenly stretch aloft, and vales below;\n\nThe mountain wears no more the brow of age,\n\nAnd nature flies her gloomy hermitage,\n\nPage 65\n\nNow desolate no longer,--to abide,\n\nWith birds and blossoms, by the brooklet's side;\n\nHow prattle the glad waters, as she brings,\n\nHer gayest buds to nurture at their springs;\n\nPleased with the song of kindred, which declares\n\nHer joy in these, and all her beauties theirs!\n\nBanks, on each side, slope down with fringe of green,\n\nTo kiss the silvery waves that sing between,\n\nSing with fit chant to the cathedral trees,\n\nThrough which, still sleepless, trolls the thoughtless breeze,\n\nWith music most like that of swarming bees!\n\nThe song is still an echo to the toil,--\n\nThe heart is tutor'd when the sinews moil;\n\nMere song were something vicious,--but the strain\n\nThat tells of solace for the limbs and brain--\n\nWhich call for respite for due service done,\n\nIn fields of meet succession with the sun,--\n\nThis brings a healthful nurture, and, if right\n\nThe duty done, we look for the delight.\n\nThe charm that still beguiles us at the close\n\nOf the day-labor, freshening its repose,\n\nIs the sweet nourishment for strength anew,\n\nThe future toil, or conquest, to pursue.\n\nThus sings the earth at seasons,--thus we hear\n\nThe bird and insect joyous far and near;\n\nA choral hymn the nation's toil preludes,\n\nAnd the glad creature frolics ere it broods.\n\nFull of a sweet and wise intelligence,\n\nNot simply fashion'd for the idiot's sense,\n\nThe voices that we hear from plain and grove,\n\nThey speak in gladness, for they breathe of love;\n\nAnd love is the great duty which implies\n\nToil for the drudge and study for the wise;\n\nPage 66\n\nBoth earnest ever in the fond pursuit,\n\nThat, in the very tillage, finds the fruit!\n\nEarth has a labor in her womb below!--\n\nThe watchful ear may catch the murmuring flow\n\nOf mingling strifes and sounds,--the strifes of toil,\n\nOf those who sing and serve, for those who moil.\n\nThe mighty mother, with mysterious art,\n\nHath fashion'd well each agent in her mart;\n\nVarious in product, as in office, still,\n\nEach, without murmur, follows at her will;\n\nNo void unfill'd beneath her searching eye,\n\nNo realm unwatch'd, of water, earth, or sky;--\n\nThere runs the lizard o'er the freshest flowers,\n\nAs death gives shadow to our sunniest hours;--\n\nThere, the gay butterfly, on varied wing,\n\nPursues the insect that it cannot sting;--\n\nThere goes the coiling serpent, with raised crest,\n\nAnd warning rattle, to his slimy nest,--\n\nVex'd by pursuit he slowly wins his way,\n\nNor seems unwilling to prolong his stay,--\n\nToo closely press'd he would not shun the strife,\n\nAnd he who takes, must battle for, his life.\n\nTurn where the dove,--meet contrast!--with his mate\n\nJust won, delighted with his new estate,\n\nLingers beside the path a fearless thing,\n\nNor claims the succor of his idle wing.\n\nNature endows him with the season's sense,\n\nWhere all is breathing hope and confidence,--\n\nAnd, heedful of her interest, man decrees\n\nHis safety from the fowler. Thus we seize\n\nOur sweetest lessons of preserving good,\n\nFrom the dumb nature and unthinking mood,--\n\nPage 67\n\nFor it were base to wrong the faith implied,\n\nWhich seeks our steps, nor hurries once aside,\n\nThough life is dearer now, so full of love,\n\nAnd fear is the first instinct of the dove!\n\nNIGHT STORM.\n\nTHIS tempest sweeps the Atlantic!--Nevasink\n\nIs howling to the Capes! Grim Hatteras cries\n\nLike thousand damned ghosts, that on the brink\n\nLift their dark hands and threat the threatening skies;\n\nSurging through foam and tempest, old Román\n\nHangs o'er the gulf, and, with his cavernous throat,\n\nPours out the torrent of his wolfish note,\n\nAnd bids the billows bear it where they can!\n\nDeep calleth unto deep, and, from the cloud,\n\nLaunches the bolt, that, bursting o'er the sea,\n\nRends for a moment the thick pitchy shroud,\n\nAnd shows the ship the shore beneath her lea:--\n\nStart not, dear wife, no dangers here betide,--\n\nAnd see, the boy still sleeping at your side!\n\n\"WELL,\" SANG A BLUE-EYED DAMSEL.\n\nI.\n\n\"WELL,\" sang a blue-eyed damsel, half hidden by a wood\n\nOf bearded oaks, that on the banks of Etiwando stood;\n\n\"Give me such days of beauty forever by these shores,\n\nSuch glimpses of this noble stream as to the sea it pours; Page 68\n\nThe palm, the pine, the song of birds, and this gay realm of flowers,\n\nThat sweetens now, with smile and scent, this ancient home of ours;\n\nAnd not your Texian world of wealth, your wild and wondrous gleams,\n\nYour giant herds, your mighty birds, your silver-bedded streams;\n\nNo, nor the glimpse of golden spoils, that tempt the eager eye,\n\nAs half display'd, in Mexique vales, with scarce a guard they lie,\n\nShall move me to repine with thoughts that pomp and wealth bedeck,\n\nNo more, with rich and jewell'd pride, our Carolina's neck.\n\nII.\n\nFor, stately in her beauty still, and stainless in her fante,\n\nShe rises like a queen of grace, while others sink in shame;\n\nThe wealth so dear in other eyes, the bribe that wins the rest,\n\nShows basely in her matron glance, moves scorn within her breast;\n\nTrue to her proud example still, her sons pursue their way,\n\nAnd wisdom gives their counsels weight, and virtue yields them sway:\n\nAh! shall her daughters heed the prize of selfish, stranger lands,\n\nNor all prefer, which she bestows, whose nobler worth commands?\n\nWhat though her sons no wealth declare when they approach to woo,\n\nYet sprung from noble stocks they come, and like their sires are true;\n\nWith one of these, but build for me my cottage on these shores,\n\nAnd all the wealth of Mexico, and Texas too, be yours.\" Page 69\n\nNATURE'S FAVORITE.\n\nSOME men are Nature's favorites; they were born\n\nBeneath the canopy of trees in May,\n\nWhen Beauty fills the sky, and from the bud\n\nBreathes the fresh odor; when the merry birds\n\nGo singing through the air, and whirls aloft,\n\nIn maddest paroxysms of delight,\n\nThe wanton mimic of a thousand tongues,\n\nPouring a torrent of impetuous song\n\nThat stuns the grove to silence. She has been\n\nThe gentle mother, leading them away\n\nFrom the immure of the unnatural town,\n\nTo the free homestead of the ancient trees;\n\nBestowing them the life that there alone\n\nMakes life a dear romance. They have gone forth\n\nAnd brought her flowers, and fill'd her lap with them;\n\nAnd she has told them, of the life of each,\n\nMost ravishing stories. Oh! how very sweet\n\nThus to be taught! No-musty books--no rules,\n\nIn dull, damp dungeons, shutting out the sky,\n\nAnd drudging the free fancy with a weight\n\nThat leaves it wingless after.--'Tis my joy\n\nThat I have thus been tutored! Nature came\n\nAnd took me for her charge when I was young,\n\nAnd brought me up herself. I was not taught\n\nVain histories of schoolmen--men of cloud\n\nAnd vapor, with philosophies of straw,\n\nThat strive in bubble-hunting.

I made it mine,--\n\nEnjoying it, the past was mine as well;--\n\nI lived the life of the world, as still the world\n\nHas render'd life to the living--yielding man\n\nExperience of his father in his own;\n\nTrod the same ground that they had travell'd o'er,\n\nThe sage and soldier of dim ages gone,\n\nIn the same company.--What did I need,\n\nWith the same feelings and affections fill'd--\n\nFor I drew milk from breasts which they had drawn--\n\nTo toil through their adventures?

how softly sleeping\n\nShadow'd by beauty she lies,\n\nDreams, as of rapture, creeping,\n\nSmile by smile, over her eyes;\n\nLips, oh! how sweetly parting,\n\nAs if the delight between,\n\nWith its own warm pulses starting,\n\nStrove to go forth and be seen.\n\nII.\n\n'Tis Love, born newly of fancy,\n\nBrushing her heart with his plume,\n\nThat wakes, with his necromancy,\n\nOn the tale-telling cheek the bloom;-- Page 75\n\nAh! long as a fancy gladden,\n\nSweet Love, the delighted heart,\n\nNor ever with passion madden,\n\nNor ever with hope depart.\n\nHAUNTED WOODS.--A FRAGMENT.\n\nTHESE woods have all been haunted, and the power\n\nOf spells still harbors in each tree and flower;\n\nThe groves still keep, and hide, a various race,\n\nWhom we should vainly labor to displace;\n\nNor were it wise, so long as we deplore\n\nThe failing virtues that we knew before;\n\nThose precious sympathies that loved to find,\n\nIn speechless nature, voices for mankind:\n\nThat still acknowledged spirits in the beam,\n\nGnomes in the mountain, undines in the stream;\n\nDryads in woods, not near so wild as these,\n\nAnd sweet, sad nymphs, that hide in ancient trees!\n\nHere, to my faith, they still abide, and crown\n\nThe dark deep groves with beauties not their own:\n\nStill, 'midst the sacred ring, in doubtful light,\n\nThe tricksy elves go dancing through the night;\n\nMeet the capricious fairies, where they glide,\n\nSparkling in moonlight, by Saluda's side,\n\nAnd, join'd in mimic battle, or in sport\n\nMore genial, find the happy night too short!\n\nThus the sad Indian, ever as he flew\n\nO'er these smooth waters in his birch canoe,\n\nBeheld afar, in light of summer eves,\n\nWild forms and faces glimmering through the leaves:\n\nPage 76\n\nBright, star-like eyes flash'd out from thickest shades,\n\nAnd, softly sudden, laugh'd ascending maids;\n\nStrange antic shapes, half mingled with the pine,\n\nShriek'd out, as baffled in some foul design;\n\nShook their fierce torches at each flitting grace,\n\nAnd stamp'd in fury o'er their trysting-place;\n\nTrampled on flowers to fairy fingers dear,\n\nAnd flouted joys they had not soul to share;--\n\nThen fled to genial swamps and thickets dark,\n\nWhere the faint glow-worm shrouds her little spark.\n\nAn envious tribe, that, ere the white man came,\n\nThe dusky savage well had learn'd to name;\n\nMischievous elves, that charm'd his sylvan bow,\n\nWarp'd the shaft, erring, sent against his foe;\n\n'Wilder'd his footsteps in the search of prey,\n\nAnd led his dog aside, the scentless way;\n\nStill, when the day was done, beside him crept,\n\nAnd fill'd his dreams with horror while he slept;\n\nNor gave him respite, till, with hallowing rite,\n\nHis priests, with incense, soothed the demon's spite!\n\nIn these the red-man's faith was no less strong\n\nThan that which Allegmania kept so long:\n\nA realm as various peopled, in his creed,\n\nAs Albion recognized, and knew indeed;\n\nWith native instincts, conscious of a tie,\n\n'Twixt earth and air, that lifts humanity,\n\nSupplying still a void between our race\n\nAnd that we dream of in the world of space;\n\nShowing faint glimpses, shapes of cloud and light,\n\nOf fancy born, yet precious to the sight,\n\nAnd still appealing, when we droop or dream,\n\nTo worlds and hopes which thus bestow their gleam;\n\nA light, though faint, to show us where to rise,\n\nAnd wings, though feeble, which may pierce the skies.\n\nPage 77\n\nAh! from these woods they do not yet depart,\n\nThey win our worship still, they soothe our heart:\n\nThe ancient fancies still as strongly glow,\n\nAnd still the antic shadows come and go;\n\nStrange aspects haunt the forests, to our eyes,\n\nAs fill'd the red-man's home with mysteries;\n\nWe hear the wild chant of the eldritch race,\n\nAnd see them flitting in their midnight chase:\n\nThey live for us as them. Our woodman sees,\n\nEven now, quaint masks that lurk behind the trees;\n\nPossess with spells that haunt him as he speeds,\n\nInspire his terrors, or arrest his deeds;\n\nUntil his soul grows full of faith, for which\n\nHis reason finds no answer and no speech:\n\nHe deems all true the red-man taught of spells,\n\nStill loathly lingers where the demon dwells,\n\nAnd still imagines that the charmed song,\n\nAmong the pines, will harbor in them long;\n\nNot simply winds, communing with the boughs,\n\nBut sounds of brooding myriads, as they drowse.\n\nTHE STATESMAN.\n\nWELL, if it be that Fortune's sun is setting,\n\nAnd friends that cheer'd thee in thy happier day\n\nTurn from thy griefs, thy glorious gifts forgetting,\n\nAnd faithless prove when faith had been thy stay:\n\nThou art thine own mind's master, though forsaken\n\nOf those who came and crouch'd while all was bright;\n\nThou bear'st a soul that storms have never shaken,\n\nAnd resolute will to tread the path of right.\n\nPage 78\n\nAnd this is still to conquer, though we perish!\n\n'Tis no defeat, when, steadfast in our hearts,\n\nWe yet, o'er all, the sacred purpose cherish,\n\nThough every hope that grew with it departs;--\n\nThe will that moves us to the strife unquailing,\n\nStill keeps the faith unchanging it believes;\n\nThough in the hope that dream'd of conquest failing,\n\nThe future still avenges and--retrieves!\n\nAnd, to thyself thus true in every fortune,\n\nThe very foes must honor who o'erthrow:\n\nCalm, steadfast, firm--oh! why shouldst thou impórtune\n\nThe fate whose seasons ever come and go?\n\nThou hast no loss in ever-losing struggle,\n\nFor that thou strivest still in Duty's cause;\n\nRejecting still the bauble and the juggle,\n\nTrue to thyself, the virtues and the laws.\n\nSLEEPING CHILD.\n\nMY little girl sleeps on my arm all night,\n\nAnd seldom stirs, save, when with playful wile,\n\nI bid her turn, and lift her lip to mine,--\n\nWhich, even as she sleeps, she does; and sometimes then,\n\nHalf muttering in her slumbers, she declares\n\nHer love for me is boundless. Then I take\n\nThe precious promise closer to my arms,\n\nAnd, by my action--for, in such a time,\n\nMy lips can find no utterance for my heart--\n\nGive her assurance meet that she is there\n\nPage 79\n\nMost treasured of my jewels. Thus, tenderly,\n\nHour after hour, with no desire of sleep,\n\nI watch above that large amount of hope,\n\nWith eyes made doubly vigilant by their tears,\n\nUntil the stars wane, and the yellow moon\n\nWalks forth into the night.\n\nTHE GRAPE-VINE SWING.\n\nLITHE and long as the serpent train,\n\nSpringing and clinging from tree to tree,\n\nNow darting upward, now down again,\n\nWith a twist and a twirl that are strange to see:\n\nNever took serpent a deadlier hold,\n\nNever the cougar a wilder spring,\n\nStrangling the oak with the boa's fold,\n\nSpanning the beech with the condor's wing.\n\nYet no foe that we fear to seek--\n\nThe boy leaps wild to thy rude embrace;\n\nThy bulging arms bear as soft a cheek\n\nAs ever on lover's breast found place:\n\nOn thy waving train is a playful hold\n\nThou shalt never to lighter grasp persuade;\n\nWhile a maiden sits in thy drooping fold,\n\nAnd swings and sings in the noonday shade!\n\nOh! giant strange of our southern woods,\n\nI dream of thee still in the well-known spot,\n\nThough our vessel strains o'er the ocean floods,\n\nAnd the northern forest behol"
