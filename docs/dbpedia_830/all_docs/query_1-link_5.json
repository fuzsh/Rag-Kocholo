        "text": "This is a list that includes a photographic gallery of some remaining historical buildings, houses, structures and monuments in Kingman, Arizona, some of which are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Also, included are images of the historic Steam Engine #3759, which was built in 1927 for the Santa Fe Railroad.\n\nBrief history\n\nThe first people to inhabit the current city of Kingman and its surrounding area were the Anasazi known as the “Ancient Ones,” and their Native American descendants, principally the Hualapai, Havasupai and Mohave tribes.\n\nThe first documented exploration of the area by Europeans was that made by the Spaniards led by Marcos de Niza. In 1539, he and his men arrived in the Kingman area in search of gold. The following year Francisco Vásquez de Coronado explored the area as well. Arizona was part of the state of Sonora, Mexico in 1822, however, the settled population by the Mexicans was small. During the California gold rush of 1849, people from the east coast of the United States and Anglo's from Europe began to travel into the area to explore and search for gold. Many of these travelers established homesteads and settled down in the area.\n\nBetween 1830 and 1860, the United States nearly doubled the amount of territory under its control. The United States fought against Mexico in what is known as the Mexican–American War. The war ended officially when the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed. It specified its major consequence, the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo México to the United States.\n\nThe relations between the new settlers and the Mohaves was a friendly one at first. The Mohaves sold the wild game and other supplies to the travelers. They also acted as guides and messengers between wagon trains. The settlers, however still feared the possibility of an attack by the local natives.\n\nBeale's Wagon Road\n\nIn 1857, President James Buchanan appointed Edward Fitzgerald Beale to survey and build a 1,000-mile wagon road from Fort Defiance, Arizona to the Colorado River, on the border between Arizona and California along the 35th parallel. The wagon trail began at Fort Smith, Arkansas and continued through the New Mexico Territory to Fort Defiance. He then continued west over what is now northern Arizona to Camp Beale Springs near the modern City of Kingman. Many settlers used the wagon trail to move to the West. There is a marker in Kingman which indicates the area of the wagon trail which became part of U.S. Route 66 and the route for the Transcontinental railroad.\n\nAtlantic & Pacific Railroad\n\nLewis Kingman, a civil engineer, who surveyed and built several thousands of miles of railroad lines. Kingman worked for the Atlantic & Pacific Railroad. In January 1880, Kingman's assignment was to survey and establish a railroad line from Flagstaff, Arizona to the Colorado River via Topock, Arizona. Kingman was in charge of the railroad contract work from Winslow to Beale Springs. In December 1881, Kingman was appointed chief engineer with a full charge of the railroad construction. Much of the length of the line which he established was parallel to Beale's Wagon Trail. The track reached the site of what is now the City of Kingman under his supervision. He chose the area as a station to house railroad construction materials.\n\nKingman City\n\nThe Kingman townsite, named for Lewis Kingman, was designated in 1882. The original Kingman townsite was within the boundaries of what are now First and Sixth, Pine and Golconda streets. Johanna Wilkinson and her sister Francis came to the Kingman territory in the early 1880s. Her brother Tobi, who was working for the railroad, told her that the railroad workers had little food, only what they could get from the land which mostly consisted of rabbits. Tobi urged Johanna to come and cook for the railroad workers because he told she would make \"good money.\" Johanna and Francis hired a teamster to haul their supplies and made the 300 plus mile trip. Once there, they set up a tent directly across from the train station Lewis Kingman had built, and cooking on an iron cast stove, fed the workers who sat on boxes and ate on boards for tables. Business thrived and Johanna and Francis added a wood floor to their restaurant. Learning that the workers were sleeping in the box cars or on the ground, they set up additional tents where they rented cots for the workers to sleep on. As Kingman developed into a mining town, Johanna married Harvey Hubbs and together they built Kingman's first hotel, the Hubbs House. The hotel caught fire nine times thanks to the miners smoking in bed. Because water had to be brought in from Peach Springs, there was no water to fight the fires. They built another Hubbs House, the first two-story building in Kingman, and then later the in partnership with Beale, the Beale Hotel which still stands. Harvey and Johanna's home was restored by the city of Kingman and is now on the National Register of Historic Places. Harvey would serve as county sheriff, county treasurer, and owned mines. He introduced Kingman to its first water system. Later, there was Mrs. Smith's lodging house and Mrs. Smith's restaurant located next to Ryan's Saloon. Kingman, which was a railroad town, prospered while many of the towns in Arizona, which were established as mining towns, went into decline after the mines were depleted.\n\nIn 1887, votes were taken to determine where the Mohave County seat was to be established and Kingman won. The county seat moved to Kingman and the courthouse offices were located in a two-story frame building, constructed by Orvin Peasley and W.H. Taggart. Kingman was officially incorporated in 1952\n\nAmong the early constructed historical properties in Kingman is the Little Red Schoolhouse which was built in 1896. Actor Andy Devine was an alumnus of the school. Also the Saint John's Methodist Episcopal Church which was built in 1917 and styled like an ancient Greek Temple. On March 29, 1939, Clark Gable and Carole Lombard were married there.\n\nSome of the structures in Kingman are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. There are other structures, which according to the \"Route 66 in Arizona Survey Report\" are eligible to be listed in National Register of Historic Places. The fact that a property is listed in the National Register of Historic Places or that it may be eligible to be listed as such, does not mean that the property is safe from being demolished by its owner. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President:\n\nRoute 66\n\nRoute 66, also known as \"The Mother Road\", received official designation in 1926, after the government enacted a plan for the national highway which would link Chicago with Los Angeles. During its heyday, Route 66 connected the main streets of rural and urban communities. The route represented an opportunity for hundreds of thousands of people who packed up their belongings with the intention of escaping from the ruining effects of the Dust Bowl in the 1930s.
