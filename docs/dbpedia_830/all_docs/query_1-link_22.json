I thank God that His Grace has reigned done on you during this extraordinarily difficult time. It's oh so easy for me to say that all things happen for a reason, but if the tables were turned, I'd find it very challenging to accept my present situation. So, it can only be by God's Grace that you move forward with such strength, Grace and dignity. I was born and raised in Whitestone, NY. I will be on The Island in September. Could I possible stop by your home and say, \"Hello?' I can only imagine how many family, friends and well-wishers want to drop in. Either way, my daily prayers will embrace you especially as you wake up every morning and prepare to start your day.

As far as insurance companies: there\\'s a special place in hell for them. About 15-20 years ago, a high up executive at Cigna resigned and then spilled the beans: it was Cigna\\'s policy to routinely deny claims, trying to discourage and exhaust the ill people and their families, causing them to give up pressing legitimate claims, or perhaps die first. What kind of mutant can do this to Ill people and their families? The bastards lost a massive class action lawsuit, ha ha. Don\\'t give up.\n\nDouglas Kelban\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nOpps...John Merritt 914 844-3203 luv.heals@verizon.net\n\nJohn Michael Joseph Merritt\n\nApril 29, 2022\n\nDear Rebecca, You are my hero. I pray and think about you and your family every day. For whatever reason, the cross you presently carry has touched my heart in a very profound way. Every morning I ask my Guardian Angel to hold your hand and help you get your day started, Yes, every morning I look at a list of men, women and children that are on my prayer list. I no longer live in Westchester County, NY, but if I did I would love to stop by just to say hello and remind you just how many lives have been touched by you. The truth is, most of this Earthly experience is a complete mystery to me. Why things happen the way they do is totally beyond my human comprehension. I pray for our brothers and sisters through out the day who live in the Ukraine. Sometimes it just hurts...I have no answers. I try to live One Day At A Time and do the best that I can. I pray for the spiritual eyes to behold the God Consciousness in every man, woman and child I see throughout the day. Faith, I\\'ve been told, is the bridge between us and our Higher Power. I suspect that I\\'m preaching to the choir and should shut up. If you ever need to chat, even at two in the morning, please call. I live in The Villages, Florida. It\\'s an over 55 community with 72,000 houses and approximately 132,000 people. I\\'ve been here 6 months and find myself growing in my love for God more and more each day..One of my favorite poems is, \\\"Desiderata\\\" by Max Ehrmann, 1921, Latin for \\\"things desired.\\\" Joke: You know you\\'re getting old when you tell your husband that you\\'re having an affair and says, \\\"So, Who\\'s catering it?\\\" :-)\n\nJohn Michael Joseph Merritt\n\nApril 26, 2022\n\nEmily Raphael's birthday gift\n\nMaxwell Schulman\n\nApril 24, 2022\n\nI\\'m sorry to hear about the nurse leaving. I wish I had some magic to alleviate your suffering. The loss of a good nurse, with the possibility of a crisis at any time must be draining, discouraging, y brutal at times in ways I can\\'t even imagine. Susan, I, and the rest of the gang are humbled and in awe of you guys. If you want company on a day you guys are going for a walk, I\\'d love to join you and get my fat butt moving. Also, if one of you needs transportation again, I\\'d be happy to help. It\\'s good to have old fart retired friends, LOL.\n\nLove to all,\n\nSusan and Doug\n\nDouglas Kelban\n\nApril 23, 2022\n\nWheelchair Sports Federation - PushHard!\n\nJohn Hamre\n\nApril 23, 2022\n\nI\n\nI’m thinking of Rebecca and the family daily.\n\nLoved seeing your beautiful home.

So I'm now matching every donation up to the total amount raised.\n\nTwo additional donations were made after I pledged my matching amount, so I matched those two donations via Facebook, and Facebook then closed my fundraiser.

You may already be aware of it, but, in case you aren\\'t, there is a foundation called, The Make a Wish Foundation, which arranges these kinds of things. You need a referral from a doctor and social worker to qualify, as I understand it. If interested, contact the foundation, or contact me, and I will see if I can get a name for you to contact directly. You can get my email address or cell phone through the Help, Hope, and Live campaign list, as I have contributed. I don\\'t think that your parents have my updated email address, and I don\\'t want to post it publicly...\n\nYou and your family are really amazing...keep on rocking!\n\nYou are in my prayers constantly...and there are more people praying for you than you are aware...Things can change in ways unpredictably for the better too...Musicians Gloria Estefan and David Broza are examples who recovered from devastating accidents and surpassed doctors\\' predictions....so stay your strong, beautiful self....\n\nI don\\'t know if you got my other messages, but I know you because I grew up next door to your father in Baldwin, and I learned of your situation this past October...I cannot recall if you knew your Grandpa Dave, but I know that you did not know Grandma Estelle...I knew her, and I see a lot of her in your face...She was so upbeat too...wonderful lady with the most bubbly, personality and warmest smile....\n\nI\\'m sending you lots of love and healing energy.\n\nLauren Friedland\n\nMarch 11, 2022\n\nSupport from the Tenenbaum Law, P.C.

It\\'s a great way to give back to all the amazing people there who\\'ve helped and supported you all. I\\'m sure, given how well you write, that you helped them greatly. It\\'s also great that you are able to grasp and enjoy some family normality. Hopefully, much more to come not just as a family, but for you and Audrey, who endured, and continue to endure, what no parents should ever have to endure, and you and Audrey have done it amazingly. That\\'s it for now.

Lots of Love Aunt Gladys & Bert\n\nGladys Aaron\n\nJuly 10, 2021\n\nI TOTALLY disagree that you don\\'t have natural ability to be a caretaker. I think Rebecca is so lucky to have you guys for parents, and the degree of her improvement speaks to that, as well as her ability to hold onto that fighting spirit and efforts. The service was wonderful. Rebecca looked beautiful and spoke WELL. Many people will be there for you when you think you can\\'t do it anymore. We love all of you.\n\nDoug Kelban and Susan Green\n\nJuly 10, 2021\n\nMay god bless you and your family !\n\nTheresa Pfeiffer\n\nJuly 10, 2021\n\nMay god watch over your beautiful family !

Our congregation at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Middle Island, NY is praying for Rebecca\n\nMrs. Jahn, POBJFK Class of 2019\n\nJune 26, 2021\n\nApropos about the small things helping us cope: a Chinese fable….\n\nA man is walking in the jungle when he hears a roar and sees a lion closing in on him. He runs in a panic until he comes to a cliff. He’s thinking he can jump and evade the lion when he looks down and sees another lion waiting for him. With no other alternative, he jumps. Halfway down, he sees a rose bush: a way to save himself. He grabs and holds onto the rose bush. He is about to think of his good fortune and escape, when he notices the rose’s roots slowly pulling free of the cliff.\n\nThe wise Chinese master asks his student “what did the man do?”\n\nThe answer: he smelled the rose.\n\nDouglas Kelban\n\nJune 26, 2021\n\nWow, a lot is going on. We’re glad Rebecca has been able to partake in activities, and is still improving in her breathing. Your updates are very meaningful and well said, and maybe writing will become a new career! You are so right about how the daily , mundane , and chores and rituals of life provide a sustaining structure in the worst of times, and you and Audrey are doing a marvelous job.\n\nLove to all.\n\nDouglas Kelban and Susan Green.\n\nJune 26, 2021\n\nWe know each day is filled with struggle as well as advances. We think of Rebecca and you every day. Rebecca and both of you are working so hard and the significant progress with the breathing demonstrates that. It seems like a great community there but we hope you will all be able to return home before too long.\n\nLove\n\nMike and Elaine Kantor\n\nMike and Elaine Kantor\n\nJune 26, 2021\n\nMarie T Madden\n\nJune 26, 2021\n\nDear Scott, Audrey, Rebecca & Erik, Once again I share that while you may not know my and I, we feel connected to each of you. We pray that everyday Rebecca continues to have improvements and progress that will bring her to major milestones in her recovery. As others have said your updates are truly appreciated as we are all so vested in Rebecca's recovery and want to hear about her days, progress and how each of you are. We care deeply over Rebecca's story as she has touched so many people's lives...whether a fellow Long Islander or someone far away, we will never stop rallying behind her.\n\nWith Love,\n\nDonna Donnelly & Family\n\nDonna Donnelly\n\nJune 25, 2021\n\nEveryday and every night I’m reading your beautiful unfolding miracle story. It’s an amazing and touching one. Rebecca is extraordinary and inspiring and you and your family are exemplary in loving her so much.\n\nIt especially resonates with me\n\nThe situation with a “ forced relocation “ that can seem endless\n\nBack 4/1/2016 I flew to NY for what I thought was a few weeks at very most. I could not have been any more wrong. The diagnosis and treatment plan made it impossible to return to Fla. It’s been over 5 yrs away from my family with no end in sight. See my book about my situation. Three Pastors and a Rabbi : Heavenly Experimental Dental Prosthetics for a Dyslexic Dwarf\n\nSold on amazon and eBay.\n\nPlease share this with Rebecca.\n\nI understand all too well the emotional aspects of sudden\n\nIndefinite forced relocation out of state for treatments. If I can be of any help to Rebecca or any of you please let me know\n\nMarsha Lampert MBA MS\n\nJune 23, 2021\n\nHi Scott,\n\nI grew up in Plainview and graduated from JFK High SchooI. It\\'s a great place to grow up, so I can understand how much you miss your home and community.

You and Audrey have risen to this challenge as parents by being there for her in every way. Scott, your updates on Rebecca\\'s progress mean a lot. Thank you for writing them!

I patiently wait every week for the next one. I have messaged you in the past (I am a complete stranger) but now I consider the Koltun family my new friends. After reading Rebeccas input on “not being all sunshine and rainbows” it stood with me all week. I pray to god for more sunshine and rainbows and I hang on to very strong faith that more is coming Rebeccas way. I wish you a Happy Father’s Day with your beautiful family. Please know you all are continuously thought about and prayed for many times each and every day. You may feel far from home and very home sick but please know LI is waiting your return. I am confident I can speak for everyone- we too cannot wait for that day to come.

You are a gifted writer. All night \\\"last night, I kept saying to myself \\\" Its not always Sunshine and Rainbows\\\". Rebecca has touched so many lives in different ways that she will never know. I know by now that she is brilliant and super strong. I dream of Rebecca becoming an author, writing her story and many other stories that come to her Brilliant mind.
