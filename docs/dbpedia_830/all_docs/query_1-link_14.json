        "text": "When was the last time you sent an appreciation message?üìù üì© Alright, mi gente, today‚Äôs the day! Take a moment to let someone know you appreciate them, care for them, love them, or that you‚Äôre thinking about them. Friends, family, coworkers, team members, your partner... anyone and everyone! Appreciation holds immense power in our lives, and it will bring joy to those who receive it. Isn‚Äôt that beautiful? Reaching out to let people know they‚Äôre in your thoughts makes them feel special and seen. And this is the essence of hospitality‚Äîmaking people feel valued,special and important‚ú®Ô∏è Remember, simple acts of kindness cost nothing. You have the power to transform lives with them. You might not be saving someone‚Äôs life, but you could make their day a little better. So, what are you waiting for? Who are you thinking about right now?

We went for cake! Our request was simple: a small cake, elegantly inscribed with our names and \"10th Happy Wedding Anniversary.\" Since the cake was small, we asked the baker to omit the word \"happy\" and write just our names and \"10th wedding anniversary\". The baker, a seasoned gentleman with a twinkle in his eye, paused. \"But ma'am,\" he said, \"the 'happy' is what makes it meaningful.\" He was right. The word \"happy\" added a symphony of joy to a relationship. So, he took his time, his brush dancing across the cake like a love poem in icing. The final product wasn't just a confection; it was a masterpiece, a testament to his artistry and, even more, his passion for his craft. It was a beautiful reminder: when we do what we love, it shows. The baker could have simply etched what we said, fulfilled the transaction, and moved on. But he didn't. He saw beyond the request, felt the weight of those ten years, and poured his heart onto a canvas of sugar and flour. No matter your field, when you approach your work with love, creativity, and a dedication to making it meaningful, the results are simply delicious. So, today, I ask you: are you pouring your heart into your work? Are you finding ways to add that dash of \"happy\" to your craft, your interactions, your contributions? Because the world needs your unique passion, your willingness to go beyond the ordinary and create something truly beautiful.\n\nIt may be a small act, but it‚Äôs important to me. Along with bringing small gifts for hotel staff- this time it was macarons- I make it a point to confirm with housekeeping how I can make their job easier when I check out- the little details that can make a difference especially when someone is having a hard day. Now, I don‚Äôt always have the time to prep the room. There are times when it‚Äôs a mad dash out the door on that final morning, but when I do have a few moments to spare, I use them to hopefully save another person time who may need those extra minutes more than I do. Is it my job to do so? Nope. It also isn‚Äôt the job of those who host birthday parties at BMK to clean everything up yet when families take the time to leave the woods or kitchen as they found it, it means a lot to me and doesn‚Äôt go unappreciated. I‚Äôm there at the end of every birthday party and I know some families need to hustle out right at the end and don‚Äôt have time to do anything but load kids up and head to their next destination. That‚Äôs why it is my job and not theirs, I want to make sure if they need to go they can without worrying about the clean up. We can‚Äôt always do the little things, but when we can, it‚Äôs worth it.. It‚Äôs walking back to the correct aisle to put back something you decided you didn‚Äôt want instead of making an employee do it. I like to leave a double bag ready to go when I am done checking out at Trader Joes to help the cashier with the next customer. Or properly stacking empty plates and dirty silverware at a restaurant to make clearing the table easier. If I see a way to lend a helping hand, I‚Äôm taking action. I have been on the receiving end of so many small and big acts of kindness that I simply cannot go through life not paying it forward to others. We never know if our small act, our small effort to lighten another‚Äôs load, may be what they need to not be crushed by the weight of their day. We don‚Äôt know another‚Äôs story, but if we find ourselves playing even the smallest role in their narrative, let‚Äôs choose to be a force of kindness.
