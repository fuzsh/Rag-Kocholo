        "text": "The oceanfront landscape really came into shape in the 1990s, with construction crews working full-time to build many high-rise hotels, resorts, motels and condo complexes near the beach.\n\nThe addition of many live entertainment theaters would have dominated the attractions news of the decade if not for an ambitious $250 million project from Burroughs & Chapin Co. ( ), an entertainment complex that would come to be known as Broadway at the Beach. Though some considered it a gamble to try and draw visitors away from the beach, the complex soon became a hub of entertainment and tourism in the area, being named \"Top Tourist Attraction\" in South Carolina at the Governor's Conference on Travel and Tourism.\n\nThough growth and modernization continued to change the look of the Myrtle Beach area, there were efforts during this era to keep the \"family-friendly\" image of Myrtle Beach, including the infamous 1993 \"thong ordinance\" which threatened fines or jail time for swimwear that exposed any portion of the buttocks.\n\n1990\n\nGolf courses including Tidewater Golf Club in Little River and Legends Golf & Resort, a multi-course resort off of U.S. 501 near Carolina Forest, open for business.\n\nWild Water & Wheels water park opens in Surfside Beach.

As the bubble burst, and recession hit, not only did many homeowners and builders get caught in tough financial situations, but plans for many new developments and attractions were scrapped.\n\nThough some projects, such as Hard Rock Park and The Market Common were completed, many of the attractions and other businesses built during the late 2000s struggled to survive under the weight of a tough economy.\n\n2000\n\nMurrells Inlet Marshwalk is built, paving way for the opening of popular restaurants such as Creek Ratz of Murrells Inlet in 2000 and Dead Dog Saloon in 2001.\n\nIn Myrtle Beach, the last NASCAR Busch Series race, The Myrtle Beach 250 ( ), is held at Myrtle Beach Speedway on June 17.\n\nBarefoot Resort simultaneously opens four championship courses designed by golf legends including Greg Norman, Davis Love III, Tom Fazio and Pete Dye.

The building was razed and rebuilt and is now 8th Avenue Tiki Bar.\n\n2005\n\nWith many of its tenants moving across town to Coastal Grand Mall, Myrtle Square Mall closes in the fall of 2005.\n\nOther closures are The Pink House, an inn, restaurant and holiday shop open since 1947, and several golf courses including Angel’s Trace Golf Links in Calabash, N.C., Burning Ridge West, Raccoon Run and Winyah Bay golf course in Georgetown.\n\nMagiQuest, an attraction which puts visitors into a fantasy-themed live action role playing game, opens at Broadway at the Beach.
