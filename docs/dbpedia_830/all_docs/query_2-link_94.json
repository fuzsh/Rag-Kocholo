        "text": "Creamed Spinach\n\nBy Jenn Segal\n\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Read my full disclosure policy.\n\nMade with frozen spinach and heavy cream, this classic creamed spinach can be made ahead and reheated in the microwave.\n\nI learned to appreciate a good creamed spinach while working at Sam & Harryâs, a fine dining steakhouse in Washington, DC that was âthe place to beâ back in the 90sâguess that dates me a bit, doesnât it? This classic steakhouse side dish of bright green spinach leaves in a rich, cheesy cream sauce might be old-school, but itâs so good that it never goes out of style. Youâll be surprised at how quick and easy it is to make. This version calls for frozen spinach and can be prepared entirely ahead of time and reheated in the microwave. Whether itâs a festive holiday or a simple family dinner, this creamed spinach fits right in. Pair it with pan-seared steaks, roast beef tenderloin with red wine sauce, roast chicken, or pan-seared salmon.\n\nâLoved thisâ¦Tastes just like a good steakhouse side.â\n\nKathryn\n\nWhat Youâll Need To Make Creamed Spinach\n\nNote that the recipe calls for thawed frozen cut leaf spinach, which is not the same as chopped spinach. If your market doesnât carry cut leaf spinach, look for frozen whole leaf spinach. (Chopped spinach will work but the texture wonât be as appealing.) If youâd like to start with fresh spinach, youâll need about 2 pounds baby spinach leaves. Steam and drain the baby spinach, then roughly chop and measure out 2 packed cups.\n\nFor the cheese, itâs important to use authentic Parmigiano Reggiano. You can always tell if itâs the real deal by looking at the rind, which is embossed with the name over and over. (If the cheese is already grated, it should be labeled âParmigiano Reggiano,â not âParmesan.â)\n\nHow To Make Creamed Spinach\n\nMelt the butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat and then add the shallots.\n\nCook the shallots, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute more. Do not brown.\n\nAdd the heavy cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg.\n\nBring to a gentle boil.\n\nCook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the cream is thick enough to coat a wooden spoon, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdd the cheese.\n\nStir until melted.\n\nAdd the spinach to the sauce.\n\nStir until evenly combined with the cream sauce.\n\nTaste and adjust seasoning if necessary. (If the spinach seems a little watery, cook over medium-low heat until any excess liquid evaporates.) Serve warm.\n\nâI made this to go along with our Christmas dinner and everyone loved it! Super delicious and easy to makeâ¦Thank you!â\n\nAmy H.\n\nYou may also like\n\nCauliflower PurÃ©e with Thyme\n\nFrench Green Beas with Shallots\n\nBroccoli PurÃ©e\n\nBrussels Sprouts Gratin"
