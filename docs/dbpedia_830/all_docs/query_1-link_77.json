        "text": "I reviewed two of Jesus Culture’s songs in the past, namely, Rooftops and You Won’t Relent, both receiving favorable scores. Since my church regularly plays Your Love Never Fails, I thought I would review it and hope others are interested.\n\nThose of you who are interested in more information about Jesus Culture may read the introduction of Rooftops. Otherwise, keep reading for my review of Your Love Never Fails.\n\nNote to new users: This is a different kind of review site! Read About the Berean Test and Evaluation Criteria prior to reading this review. I strongly encourage you to consider the potential blessings and dangers of this artist‘s theology by visiting Resources.\n\n1. What message does the song communicate?\n\n“You” has a love for me that cannot fizzle, regardless of circumstances, conditions, location, or errors. Free of fear and perplexed at the idea of navigating to the other side, I recognize that all this is for my own benefit.\n\nThough the identity of “You” is not explicitly stated, there are two things that point us believe that “You” refers to God:\n\nA single reference within the Chorus (though repeated) to His unchanging nature; and\n\nOverly Scriptural references.\n\nSide Note: To those who are sensitive to massive repetition, Bridge repeats a half dozen times in one instance and nine in another.\n\nScore: 9/10\n\n2. How much of the lyrics line up with Scripture?\n\nThe entire song is consistent with the Word of God.\n\nLyrics posted with permission.*\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nNothing can separate\n\nEven if I ran away\n\nWhile Romans 8:38-39 gives us a laundry list of things that cannot separate us from God’s love, Jesus Culture’s word “nothing” succinctly captures the idea behind these two verses.\n\nYour love never fails\n\nWhile our love is often fleeting and temporary, God’s love can never fail us because God and His ways are perfect (Leviticus 11:44-45, Leviticus 19:2, Deuteronomy 32:4, 2 Samuel 22:31, Psalm 12:6, Psalm 18:30, Psalm 19:7-11, Psalm 25:8, Psalm 92:15, Isaiah 26:7, Matthew 5:48, Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19, Romans 12:1-2, and 1 Peter 1:16). God is also love (1 John 4:8).\n\nI know I still make mistakes but\n\nAn acknowledgment of our guilt before God, consistent with Psalm 14:1-3, Psalm 53:1-3, Luke 18:19, Romans 3:10-12, and Romans 3:23.\n\nYou have new mercies for me everyday\n\nOr more specifically, in accordance with Lamentations 3:22-23, His mercies are new every morning.\n\nYour love never fails\n\nRepeats line 3.\n\n[Chorus 1]\n\nYou stay the same through the ages\n\nYour love never changes\n\nThough God does change His mind (see article on God changes His mind), God Himself, in His nature, does not change (see Numbers 23:19, Malachi 3:6, Hebrews 13:8, and James 1:17).\n\nThere may be pain in the night\n\nBut joy comes in the morning\n\nDirectly quoted from Psalms 30:5, which is part of a larger context about giving thanks to God, consistent with the demeanor and tone of this song. It draws attention to the momentary anger God had towards us overshadowed by the mercies received forever.\n\nAnd when the oceans rage\n\nI don’t have to be afraid\n\nThough Jesus Culture is not specific about what the “oceans” refer to, a common sense interpretation is a catch-all for the troubles in this life. It is because of God that we don’t have to fear our own circumstances (see Genesis 15:1, Joshua 1:9, Deuteronomy 31:6, 1 Chronicles 28:20, Psalm 23:4, Psalm 27:1, Psalm 34:4, Psalm 56:3-4, Psalm 94:19, Psalm 115:11, Psalm 118:6, Isaiah 35:4, Isaiah 41:10-13, Isaiah 43:1, Isaiah 54:4, John 14:25-27, Romans 8:15, Romans 8:38-39, 2 Timothy 1:7, Hebrews 13:5-6, 1 Peter 3:13-14, 1 Peter 5:6-7, and 1 John 4:18).\n\nBecause I know that You love me\n\nWe know God loves us for two reasons:\n\nAs mentioned earlier, God is love; and\n\nGod’s actions towards us (see Nehemiah 9:17, Psalm 17:7, Psalm 36:5-7, Psalm 63:3, Psalm 69:16, Psalm 117:2, Isaiah 54:8, John 3:16, John 13:34, John 15:13, Romans 5:6-8, Romans 8:37-39, Galatians 2:20, Ephesians 2:4-5, Ephesians 5:25, Titus 3:4, 1 John 4:8, and 1 John 4:16-19).\n\nYour love never fails\n\nRepeats Verse 1 line 3.\n\n[Verse 2]\n\nThe wind is strong and the water’s deep\n\nI’m not alone in these open seas\n\nMore oceanic language that pairs with Chorus 1 line 5. God will never leave us or forsake us (see Deuteronomy 31:6 and Hebrews 13:5).\n\n‘Cause Your love never fails\n\nRepeats Verse 1 line 3 with an added “’cause”.\n\nThe chasm is far too wide\n\nI never thought I’d reach the other side\n\nSpecifically refers to the separation between God and us. It describes God’s rescue from eternal separation into a relationship with Himself (see Genesis 15:1, Joshua 1:9, Deuteronomy 31:6, 1 Chronicles 28:20, Psalm 23:4, Psalm 27:1, Psalm 34:4, Psalm 56:3-4, Psalm 94:19, Psalm 115:11, Psalm 118:6, Isaiah 35:4, Isaiah 41:10-13, Isaiah 43:1, Isaiah 54:4, John 14:25-27, Romans 8:15, Romans 8:38-39, 2 Timothy 1:7, Hebrews 13:5-6, 1 Peter 3:13-14, 1 Peter 5:6-7, and 1 John 4:18).\n\n‘Cause Your love never fails\n\nRepeats Verse 1 line 3 with an added “’cause”.\n\n[Chorus]\n\nRepeats Chorus 1 with the exception of this line, existing in line 8: Lift up and shout, This is a direction of praise to God.\n\n[Bridge]\n\n‘Cause You make all things, work together for my good\n\nDirectly references Romans 8:28.\n\nYou make all things, work together for my good\n\n‘Cause You make all things, work together for my good\n\n‘Cause You make all things work together for my good\n\nYou make all things work together for my good\n\nYou make all things work together for my good\n\nRepeats line 1, with or without the leading “cause”.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n3. How would an outsider interpret the song?\n\nI’m not entirely sure how much an unbeliever will understand. Yes, there are a lot of Bible references throughout these lyrics; however, for someone who understands little to nothing about the Bible, I suspect that much of this song will go over their heads. This song seems to have Christians in mind, using language that is not as accessible to the uninitiated. Will they understand this to be a Christian song? Maybe with the Chorus, but it’s a crapshoot at best.\n\nMy suspicion is that it will leave their heads scratching asking themselves “what in thunder are they talking about?” Except without the mention of thunder.\n\nScore: 2/10\n\n4. What does this song glorify?\n\nThough somewhat hidden, God’s glory shines forth throughout these lyrics. Even if the “darkness cannot comprehend it” (John 1:5).\n\nScore: 9/10\n\nClosing Comments\n\nYour Love Never Fails is a mixed bag. Though highly Scriptural, its message suffers from too much repetition, with an unattainable message for unbelievers. Still, God’s glory can be found within Jesus Culture’s hit song, even if the unsaved may not get it.\n\nOverall, it’s a great song for Christ-followers, especially during worship. It’s just not for me.\n\nFinal Score: 7.5/10\n\nArtist Info\n\nTrack: Your Love Never Fails (Live) (listen to the song)\n\nArtist: Jesus Culture\n\nAlbum: Your Love Never Fails (Live)\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nRelease Year: 2010\n\nDuration: 7:57\n\nAgree? Disagree? Don’t be shy or have a cow! Calmly and politely state your case in a comment, below.\n\nUpdates:\n\n03/31/2022 – Per Artist Theology announcement, I expanded the red text to encourage others to study Jesus Culture’s theology.\n\n03/24/2021 – Updated per repetition announcement. I also increased the score for sections 1 and 4. This did not affect the overall rating."
