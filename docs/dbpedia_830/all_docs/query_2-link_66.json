        "text": "The first time Tink's name was on a lineup with Jhené Aiko, they were at Sacramento's R&B festival Sol Blume in 2022. Two years later, they're billed together again — this time, as tourmates.\n\nTink is one of four opening acts for Aiko's Magic Hour Tour, which also features Coi Leray, UMI and Kiana Ledé. As the 27-date trek begins winding down with its final stretch of shows (wrapping in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 22), Tink can't help but think about how \"full-circle\" the tour has felt.\n\n\"That was just a real manifestation,\" Tink tells GRAMMY.com, explaining that she's been \"praying\" for the opportunity since meeting Aiko at Sol Blume. \"There's so many R&B girls that could have been in this position. The fact that she brought me on this tour speaks volumes.\"\n\nHer slot on the sold-out tour signals Tink's growing appeal, and the all-female lineup is no coincidence for the singer. Tink's matter-of-fact storytelling and no-holds-barred approach is what made listeners gravitate toward her, especially women. Fans and critics alike praise Tink for her unwillingness to sugarcoat her emotions, particularly on her Thanks 4 Nothing album, and she continued it with her latest release, Winter's Diary 5, out now.\n\nA long-awaited new installment of her Winter's Diary mixtape series, the project (which, this time, is a studio album) digs deep into her ongoing journey toward self-acceptance in the face of heartbreak and betrayal. From the fed-up lyrics of \"Huh,\" to the sexually charged \"Bless Me Don't Stress Me,\" to the deeply personal \"Lows & Highs,\" Winter's Diary 5 sees Tink holding herself accountable for the failed relationships she sings so honestly about.\n\n\"The past few years have been a lot of isolation, and I've had days where I had to lock myself in my room and kind of recoup and get myself right,\" Tink says. \"This album is definitely for those moments when you have nothing to do but face your own thoughts and your reality.\"\n\nTink's music has always mirrored her own life, but the Winter's Diary narratives involve more introspection, bringing another level of rawness and vulnerability — as she said in a teaser for WD5, \"things only a diary knows.\" As a result, the Winter's Diary series has largely been the reason for Tink's cult following.\n\nTink was just 16 when she made her debut with 2012's Winter's Diary, releasing iterations 2, 3 and 4 in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In between, the Chicago native made a name for herself as a rapper in the drill scene with mixtapes Alter Ego, Blunts & Ballads and Boss Up in 2012 and 2013. Early singles like \"Finger's Up\" and \"Bad Girl\" showcased her grit, while her viral hit \"Treat Me Like Somebody\" revealed her angelic singing voice and vulnerability.\n\nThe string of acclaimed mixtapes earned a then 19-year-old Tink a deal with Timbaland's Mosley Music Group/Epic Records as well as a coveted spot in XXL's 2015 Freshman Class. That same year, her song \"Million\" (which samples Aaliyah's \"One in a Million\") whet fans' appetite for her debut album, Think Tink. The much-awaited project was slated for a July 2015 release before ultimately being shelved due to label issues.\n\nBy the end of 2017, Tink took matters into her own hands and reclaimed her narrative. She launched her own label — appropriately called Winter's Diary — in 2019 and hasn't looked back.\n\nWorking independently has brought her greater success, pointing to her resilience, work ethic and prowess as an artist who stops at nothing to get what she wants. It has also sparked quite the creative streak: in those five years, Tink has released five studio albums, one EP and a mixtape.\n\n\"I was just really trying to make up for lost time — I want to make sure that I'm keeping my name in the streets and that my fans are fed,\" Tink says. \"As an independent artist, I don't have to adhere to anyone but myself, and that's what's making [the music] feel authentic. What I'm trusting works for me, so the songs I enjoy and feel proud of, I get to push those out. That's the difference.\"\n\nNow 29, she brings a level of maturity and wisdom with Winter's Diary 5 that can only be learned through trial and error. But even after navigating toxic relationships in the Summer Walker-featuring \"Songs About U\" and acknowledging her battle scars on \"Insane,\" she ends the album with \"Pretty Girls,\" a powerful self-worth anthem that confidently reminds, \"Pretty girls don't beg/ Pretty girls bounce back/ Pretty girls don't trip/ Pretty girls run game/ Pretty girls don't slip.\"\n\nWhether or not she keeps adding to the Winter's Diary series, Tink is eager to continue growing her fan base and manifesting more big-name team-ups (she has her eye on Brent Faiyaz, SZA, and Drake next). Wherever her career goes from here, she'll always keep one thing on her mind: those who find the same solace in her music as she does.\n\n\"So many women and girls who listen to my music really need these lyrics… that's my reason and my purpose,\" Tink says. \"I know my lane is for the girls going through it. I'm telling women's stories.\"\n\nMore Rap News\n\nAug. 7, 2024 was not just another Wednesday in Las Vegas. It was Ne-Yo Day.\n\nNo, really: Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman proclaimed that Aug. 7, 2024 was officially \"Ne-Yo Day\" in the city, presenting Ne-Yo with a Key to the City during his first night of his three-show Human Love Rebellion residency at the Encore Theatre at Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nIt had already been a full-circle day for the R&B hitmaker, who grew up in Sin City and got his start in the entertainment business as an understudy in the David Cassidy-starring show \"EFX.\" As a hometown boy, Ne-Yo knew there'd be at least a few familiar faces in the crowd — and that makes his Key to the City even more special.\n\n\"I've run into a lot of girls that were not interested in me in high school and, yes, it's a totally different story now,\" Ne-Yo tells GRAMMY.com with a smile. \"There's a part of me that wants to be petty, but I can't do that. [But] when I run into those that were mean in high school, those are always fulfilling moments.\"\n\nNe-Yo's career has been full of fulfilling moments — beginning with his 2005 chart-topping smash \"So Sick,\" and followed by two No. 1 albums, 12 Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and three GRAMMY Awards. He celebrates it all with his 100-minute show, which features other favorites like \"Because of You\" and the diamond-certified Pitbull collab \"Give Me Everything.\"\n\nIn June, he began his journey as an independent artist after nearly 20 years with Motown and Def Jam Records, releasing the confessional single \"2 Million Secrets\" alongside a \"CSI\"-inspired video he directed himself. With a fresh start, Ne-Yo says he rarely feels like he's already two decades into his career.\n\n\"The only time it feels like it's been 20 years is right after a show where my back and my knees are bothering me,\" he says with a laugh. \"If you don't see the age out here, I'm feeling it on the inside!\"\n\nAhead of his Las Vegas residency, Ne-Yo sat down with GRAMMY.com to share his most memorable moments with some of his most beloved hits, from a hilarious wardrobe malfunction with \"Because of You\" to how Jay-Z helped save \"Closer.\"\n\n\"So Sick,\" 'In My Own Words' (2006)\n\nWhat instantly comes to mind with \"So Sick\" is my initial introduction to Stargate. I was at Sony Studios in New York City working with [another] group of producers. [I pass] Stargate's manager — his name is Tim, I met him before briefly. He said, \"Hey, are you busy right now? I would love you to come in for a second and meet my producers.\"\n\nSo I walk with him over to the studio — mind you, he says they do R&B, they do hip-hop, they do a little bit of everything. And Tim is Black, so I'm expecting to walk in the room and see two Black guys. I walk in the room and they are absolutely not Black. They are two tall, lanky, white guys with accents. They're from Norway. And I'm like, These guys are gonna do some R&B music for me, huh?\n\nThe very first track they played was the music that we now know as \"So Sick.\" I listened to it for like, 10 seconds, and I'm like, \"Run it back.\" So they played it again, and by the time the song finished playing the second time, the song was written. I wrote that song in maybe 3 minutes.\n\nIt was a song that needed to be written for a long time. It just hadn't found the right backing music for it yet.\n\n\"Sexy Love,\" 'In My Own Words' (2006)\n\nHere's the first time I realized that Stargate was producing around what I was writing. I wrote \"Sexy Love\" to the skeletal track they gave me, and then about a week later, I go to the studio and they're like, \"You got to hear this.\" A beat comes on, and it's vaguely what I'd recalled, but completely different. They basically changed the whole beat based around [what] I wrote. So the \"Sexy Love\" we now know, that was not the original track.\n\nI'm like, \"I don't mind, because it sounds great, but why did y'all do that?\" And they were like, \"We just felt like this direction complemented the song more.\" They're the only producers that I've ever worked with that do that.\n\nNowadays, the producer is kind of a celebrity too. Everybody has a tag, and you hear the producer's name before the song starts. You'll never hear that from Stargate. They're like, \"You're gonna listen to this song, and you're gonna love it so much that you're gonna ask who did it.\"\n\n\"Because of You,\" 'Because of You' (2007)\n\nThe part in the video where I don't have any shoes on — the performance piece — that was not by design. I don't remember who styled that video, but all the shoes they brought were too big. [They] were 11 1/2, I'm a size 10. But I couldn't do it barefoot, so I'm like, \"Alright, let's just do it.\"\n\nSo I'm dancing, and then whoop! There goes one shoe. I look at the director, and he's like, \"Just keep going!\" So I kicked the other one off, and just continued doing what I was doing.\n\nI've danced barefoot and in socks in the kitchen, you know, trying to moonwalk and all of that countless times as a kid. But I'd never done it as an adult. It was a bucket-list moment, scratched it off: performed with no shoes.\n\n\"Closer,\" 'Year of the Gentleman' (2008)\n\nI wrote it with the intent of selling it to somebody who would make more sense with that style. We stayed overseas for damn near two years, just touring around. While I was over there, I started listening to a lot of house, techno, EDM. With a lot of those songs, there might be two words in the whole song just repeated over and over. But I'm paying more attention to what the music is doing to the people that are listening… Everybody goes nuts. These people are getting this kind of response with no words!\n\nSo I'm like, imagine if somebody took that energy and wrote a song over it that actually means something — it'd be double the effect, right?\n\nMe and Stargate get in the studio. They start putting together the track, I write the song, it's done. We're listening back, and I'm like, \"Yeah, we will be able to sell this easy.\" And they're like, \"Sell it? No, no, this is yours.\" And I'm like, \"Nah, I don't think my fan base is gonna understand that.\"\n\nI let my management hear it, and they're like, \"Yeah, this is yours.\" I let Jay-Z hear it, [and he's like] \"Bro, this is the one!\" I'm like, \"What are y'all hearing? Because I don't get it.\"\n\nI did not expect the song to do well. And for the first three, four months, it didn't. Here in the States, nobody was feeling it, to the point where we walked into the label one day with the total intention of telling L.A. Reid we should switch to another single. As we're walking to L.A. Reid's office, Jay-Z stops me and goes, \"I know you about to tell him that you want to get off that record. Do not get off that record.\" And I'm like \"Bro, it's been four months!\"\n\nThat same year, we did the BET Awards. I performed \"Closer,\" and the Jabbawockeez was a part of the show. After that performance, that song took off. My manager hits me with the \"I told you so\" every single time we think of \"Closer.\"\n\n\"Miss Independent,\" 'Year of the Gentleman' (2008)\n\n\"Miss Independent\" was the first time I ever won a GRAMMY. I learned through winning a GRAMMY for that song that there are GRAMMY wins that are not televised.\n\nI'm walking the red carpet, just soaking it all in, taking pictures, doing interviews, and as I'm talking to some interviewer, this girl blows by me and goes, \"Congratulations, you just want a GRAMMY,\" and keeps walking.\n\nSo I go to my manager, I'm like, \"Yo, um, did we win?\" And he's like, \"F—, who told you?\" And I'm like, \"I don't got my speech!\" He's like, \"You don't need a speech. You won for a category that's not televised, so you're not gonna get on stage.\"\n\nIt was kind of bittersweet, because I've been dreaming of a GRAMMY since childhood. I have my acceptance speech written already. I was gonna get up on stage and thank my mom, and do the whole thing, like, \"Oh wow, this thing's heavy!\"\n\nI've won three GRAMMYs, and I've yet to walk across the GRAMMY stage and thank my mom. I might just do a Kanye. I might just walk up on stage when somebody else is accepting their GRAMMY and go, \"Hey, congratulations, but while I'm here — um, yeah, never got to do this before, so\" and just have somebody bring mine out and do it right then. I think that'd be a moment! And then I'd instantly get arrested and kicked out of the GRAMMYs and banned forever. [Laughs.]\n\n\"Give Me Everything,\" Pitbull's 'Planet Pit' (2011)\n\nWe were in the U.K., Wembley Stadium, 80,000 people, me and Pitbull [for Capital FM's Summertime Ball in 2015]. Right at the part where it says, [sings] \"Grab somebody sexy tell 'em hey,\" 80,000 people [are] jumping up and down at the same time. The whole place was shaking. It felt like electricity shooting through you, there was just so much energy coming at the stage. I literally felt sparks.\n\nPitbull felt it too. After the show, he was like, \"Yo, right at the part where we went—\" and I was like, \"YO I know right! You felt it too?\"\n\nMe and Pitbull are actually really good friends. I met him before he became Mr. Worldwide and started wearing the suits and the whole nine. We've actually done a bunch of music together that the world has never heard.\n\nPitbull is not your typical celebrity. From a guy who's having the success that he's having, you would expect an ego, a big, huge entourage, and a whole bunch of commotion around him. He doesn't club. He does the most amazing party music ever, and he doesn't go to regular clubs. Pitbull's definition of a club? He has his own island, and he'll just invite you to the island.\n\n\"2 Million Secrets\" (2024)\n\nThe song is about owning your s—. No one is perfect, no one is above making a mistake. But no one is beneath redemption, either. I absolutely made some mistakes in my previous marriage. And, you know, one thing that music has always been for me is therapy. If I have things that I couldn't say out of my mouth, I could write it in a song.\n\nIt took a little bit of growing up, maturing, for me to even write that song. For whatever reason, when you do something wrong and you know that you're wrong, my first instance was to place blame on anybody but myself. I quickly realized that that's not the way to heal, that's not the way to move on, that's not the way to receive redemption for what you have done. You have to own your mistakes… and then pray for redemption and acceptance of your apology from the people that you've wronged.\n\nWriting the song was very much therapeutic for me. I don't even call it a song. It's more of a confessional — it's me confessing to the wrongs that I did, and realizing that the best way to go about it is to get it out and then figure out how to move on. And that's exactly what me and my ex-wife have done. We moved on. We're in a great place now.\n\nMore R&B News\n\nWith massive crowds and countless critics raving about her debut album, Ravyn Lenae knew what she had to do: completely ignore all of the expectations that led to it.\n\n\"I knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go,\"she says from her home in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter building up a growing following in Chicago alongside other members of the Zero Fatigue Collective (which includes producer Monte Booker and rapper Smino), Lenae relocated to the West Coast. She made a massive mark on 2022’s Hypnos, which featured a beguiling mix of alt R&B, house and soul alongside Renae’s magnetic vocal presence.\n\nAnd rather than coast, Lenae dug deeper for the followup, Bird’s Eye (due Aug. 9). Working with frequent Kendrick Lamar collaborator and in-demand producer DJ Dahi, Bird’s Eye flutters across genres and influences — pulling from Fleetwood Mac on one track, drawing in Childish Gambino on another, and adding Jimmy Jam’s bass elsewhere. Indicative of these multifarious influences are two pre-release singles: the retro pop-leaning \"Love Me Not\" and the soulfully skipping \"Love Is Blind.\"\n\nLenae uses that shapeshifting methodology as a way to interrogate the concepts of love and relationships — never content to rest on her laurels, learning how best to grow and adapt. \"Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity,\" she says.\n\nNearing the release of Bird’s Eye, Lenae spoke with GRAMMY.com about directing the video for \"Love Me Not\" in Chicago, blending Brazilian music with Prince inflections, and how the album helped her reconnect with her father.\n\nA lot seems to have happened in the two years since 'Hypnos.' On a month-to-month, day-to-day basis, how much do you shift creatively?\n\nIt feels like night and day to me, even though it's been a really short amount of time. During this time between Hypnos and this album — the recording and creating process — a lot unlocked with me. [There was] a lot of personal growth that happened that allows me to approach music in a much freer and kind of impulsive way.\n\nWith the last album and that process, I think I did place a lot of parameters around what I had to be, what I had to sound like, what it had to feel like, who I had to connect with. And I kind of just released all of those expectations with this and made music that I wanted to hear.\n\nHow easy was it to actually release those boundaries and work more more in the moment?\n\nI knew in order for me to keep evolving as an artist and a person, there was no choice but to let those boundaries go, if I wanted to keep pursuing music in a way that felt honest. And then being able to collaborate with people such as Dahi, who has kind of mastered that in a lot of ways, and learning from him and seeing his process, seeing how easy and natural it is to just fall into what feels right…\n\nI think the longer you're in an industry or you're in something, the more rules you place on [creativity] and the more you overthink it and try to mold it in a way that doesn't feel impactful. As an artist, being around him and him encouraging that type of process, I think that was a lot of it, too.\n\nDahi's worked with some incredible artists, and clearly in a way that accentuates that artist rather than making it about DJ Dahi. That must have been so perfectly aligned with your openness, to go in and let yourself learn what you wanted to do. They always say if you know too much and plan everything out, you’ll end up stifled creatively.\n\nIt's so true. And that's why I describe it as me kind of returning back to that 12-year-old me, that 13-year-old me, before I cared about opinions, what people thought about me and what I was doing, what I was wearing I think we start off that way, and then the older we get, the more we get so self-conscious and we judge ourselves more harshly than everyone else.\n\nWhy do we do that?!\n\n[Laughs.] I think it's just human nature. And then we try to unlearn all of it.\n\nEven just in daily life, it's so hard to not think about what I could have done at any given moment. And when you’re creating music, there are 5 million ways you can create the same idea and you have to just land on that one.\n\nA hundred percent. During this process, we would have a song idea and then three different versions of that song that hit completely different feelings — maybe a more soft rock version of it, maybe a more indie version of it, maybe a more soulful version. Then it was about having to settle into what is \"the one\" and what feels the best, versus like what's going to chart or what's going to get in the club. Having to release all of that and just really lean into what feels good is what works every time.\n\nThat relates even to how the album was announced, with two tracks that almost speak in conversation with one another. Those songs balance such clever hooks with more nuanced conversation about how conflicted and complex love and relationships can be. How did you find that balance between emotional realism and such immediate music?\n\nIt was just really feeling empowered and confident in my decision making. And that's something that's developed over time, too. Really listening to my voice and what I want out of music in my career and my rollout, you know?\n\nListening to that, obviously having people around me who are like-minded in that way like my management and my team. We all kind of empowered each other to lean into those feelings. At no point in this process did anything feel forced or like I was reaching for something.\n\nThat’s so interesting. You want your team to feel supportive but you also want to feel empowered to take risks away from that support. And that reminds me of “Love Me Not,” which has some really smart risks. It's that vintage pop feeling, right down to the clap-along beats, and the vocals feel right in your ear. So when you started working on that track, for example, did you always imagine it being that nostalgia, that warmth?\n\nI thought that there was just something so cool and timeless, a classic feeling about it. And my songs are the ones where you can really pinpoint what the influences are, or when this was made, or the person behind it. Having a song like that, that really reminded me of Outkast. Like, What is this?\n\nEven before it dropped, I remember having some anxiety around maybe my fans not liking it because it feels a little different from Hypnos. I think anytime you kind of jump outside of the bubble you've kind of created, it's scary because there are people living in that bubble with you who like the temperature in there.\n\nIt’s so important to be constantly revitalized in your work. If you’re doing the same thing, even if your fans are demanding it, you’re not going to get that. And hopefully when your fans see all that you can do, they’ll follow it.\n\nYeah. And there's so much left in me to explore into and put out into the world. And look at an artist's career, someone like Tyler, the Creator: Seeing where his sound started and how he's almost trained his fans’ ears to be receptive to something new every time. They've completely grown up with him in a lot of ways and expanded their palate. Kind of forcing the hand of listeners is something that's really interesting to me. [Laughs.]\n\nI love that idea of pushing yourself and pushing your fans, but still within the realm of what's good. [Laughs] Not just experimenting for the sake of it. Speaking of growing and experimenting, I wanted to ask about the “Love Me Not” music video that you directed. It feels so well shot but still so intimate and casual.\n\nI knew with the album and how I wanted the imagery to feel, it would be very homey. Making the songs and getting to the bottom of what they meant for me was me kind of retracing my steps a little bit and really acknowledging all these moments in my life, in my childhood, that were pivotal for me and my identity, those first moments where I felt like I was getting closer to myself in a way.\n\nA lot of that started on the South side of Chicago, at my grandmother's house, in the basement. Even the cover of the album symbolizes that transition for me. That's where I dyed my hair red for the first time in the basement, in the sink, so coming back to the sink and dyeing my hair ginger on the cover was something that felt so powerful and defining for me. It just made perfect sense that we were going to go back to Chicago for the first video, in my grandmother's house, with all my family members involved. Those are my grandparents, my mom, my sisters, so that's why it feels so loose and candid. I really wanted to give people a glimpse into my life and what it felt like walking into my childhood home.\n\nGetting to see a place through someone else’s eyes is so extraordinary. It really makes the little details pop. For example, the plantains cooking on the stove at the beginning.\n\nYeah. I associate plantains with my grandparents, my family. We’re of Panamanian West Indian descent, so those smells and those sounds, I really wanted to incorporate into the video.\n\nThat really speaks to bringing some comfort along with the risk-taking, same as having your family around. The features do a great job of bolstering you, setting up that stability, particularly Ty Dolla $ign on \"Dreamgirl.\"\n\nI think we just had the idea to kind of take the song into a different world in a way. When we first started the first section of the song, I just knew there was magic there. Those Prince drums and that Brazilian guitar — why do those make sense together? It shouldn't ever make sense together. But when I heard it? Oh my god, this feels like something fresh and new, but also like I've felt this feeling before.\n\nDahi's brain is just incredible, and then even bringing in Jimmy Jam on it to do bass was a dream come true. I knew it kind of felt like it existed in that Janet stratosphere, and I thought it would be such a cool touch for him to do that personally. Dream come true on all spectrums. I love Ty Dolla $ign, obviously grew up listening to him. He's incredible and I was so honored that he wanted to do it.\n\nBesides Janet, were there any particular artists who were kind of central inspirations for this album specifically?\n\nSonically, Janet is always in the mix. With this one in particular, some Gwen Stefani, No Doubt, a little bit of Fleetwood Mac in there. I just love taking these worlds that are very different from each other and kind of mashing them and seeing what happens. It's like my favorite thing ever.\n\nYou’re trained in classical music, and it's so clear that you understand the range of emotion that you can convey. I'm just curious what happened when you went into recording — or even before that, in the writing. What was it like digging into yourself to find the narrative that matched the mashing?\n\nHonestly, I don't think there was much premeditation with the writing and what I wanted to touch on in a way. Really leaning into those impulsive initial first feelings that a song gives me is something I really valued with this album. And moving forward, that'll be my process.\n\nWhat was premeditated with the writing process with this album was, with every song, trying to really peel back those layers in my brain and those barriers lyrically. Like, What would I naturally say? Think of that and then think, Okay, how can I make this even more literal, even more personal? Even in working with my girl [songwriter] Sarah Aarons, I learned a lot from her as far as songwriting and how to really paint a picture that feels clear and concise and emotional. Not trying to find the prettiest words or the most interesting words, but really writing what feels real. And that's something that I've really, really valued and learned with this process.\n\nEven with “One Wish” with Childish Gambino, the whole album feels like this big conversation on relationships. Being more direct feels like some advice someone would get with a relationship itself, let alone writing about it. Did that process help you actually process what was happening in your life too?\n\nOh man, 100 percent. And that's why music is so beautiful to me. It's really a means of opening dialogue between me and myself, and then me and the people in my life. With a song that's so important to me like “One Wish,\" it’s not just because it's a great song, but because this has really catapulted me into this different part of my life and repairing relationships, opening up difficult conversations — like with my father in particular. Hearing such a simple song and the response I've gotten from it has only validated me much more in the fact that these real stories, real emotions are what connects.\n\nHave you played the album for your father?\n\nWe started repairing or rekindling our relationship maybe two years ago. The making of Bird’s Eye was at its peak and I felt like it was important for me to have a song on the album that addressed my relationship with him in order for me to release it and start to move on in a positive way.\n\nSo sharing the song with him, inviting him to be in the music video was huge for us. And then even after debriefing about maybe some feelings that came up when he heard certain lyrics or when he saw certain scenes in the video, it just opened up this really honest, candid dialogue between us and I couldn't be more grateful that I have this outlet.\n\nMore R&B News\n\n\"I only make records when I feel I have something to say,\" Sade Adu asserted in 2010 upon the highly anticipated release of Sade's GRAMMY-winning Soldier of Love album, which arrived after a 10-year hiatus. \"I'm not interested in releasing music just for the sake of selling something. Sade is not a brand.\"\n\nThis lifetime of dedication toward achieving musical excellence helped Sade — vocalist Adu, bassist Paul S. Denman, keyboardist Andrew Hale, and guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman — gain prominence in the mid-80s, also garnering enormous respect from fans, critics, and peers alike. Formed in 1982, the English band is one of the few acts that can still be met with a hungry audience after disappearing from the spotlight for multiple years.\n\nIn an industry where churning out a new body of work is expected every couple of years, the four meticulous members of Sade move on their own time, putting out a mere six studio albums since 1984. Every project becomes more exquisite than the last, but it all began 40 years ago with Sade's illustrious debut album, Diamond Life. Ubiquitous hits like \"Smooth Operator\" and \"Your Love Is King\" appealed to listeners young and old — offering a unique blend of R&B, jazz, soul, funk, and pop that birthed a new sound and forced the industry to take notes from the jump.\n\nAs Sade's Diamond Life celebrates a milestone anniversary, here's a look at how the album helped push R&B forward, and why it's just as relevant today.\n\nIt Helped Set Off The \"Quiet Storm\" Craze\n\nBy mid-1984, Michael Jackson, was riding high off of winning the most GRAMMYs in a single night (including Album Of The Year) for his blockbuster album Thriller, Madonna celebrated her first top 10 hit with \"Borderline,\" and Prince's Purple Rain was just days away from its theatrical release. Duran Duran, Culture Club, Billy Idol, and the Police were mainstays, while \"blue-eyed soul\" in particular had also hit an all-time high thanks to Hall and Oates, Wham, Simply Red, and others. What's more, many Black artists like Lionel Richie and Whitney Houston opted for more of a pop sound to appeal to broader audiences during MTV's golden era.\n\nDiamond Life was refreshing at the time, as it fully embraced soul and R&B. The album offered a chic sophistication amid the synth-heavy pop and rock music that ruled the charts.\n\nSingles like \"Your Love Is King\" and \"Smooth Operator\" introduced jazz elements into mainstream radio. In turn, Sade helped usher in the \"quiet storm\" genre — R&B music at its core, with strong undertones of jazz for an ultra-smooth sound. Sade and Diamond Life also laid some of the groundwork for neo-soul, which saw a surge in the '90s à la Lauryn Hill, Maxwell, and Erykah Badu.\n\nIt Made GRAMMY History\n\nIn the 65-year history of the GRAMMYs, a small number of Nigerian artists, including Burna Boy and Tems, have won a golden gramophone. In 1986, a then 27-year-old Sade Adu made history as the first-ever Nigerian-born artist to win a GRAMMY when she and her band was crowned Best New Artist at the 29th GRAMMYs. Still, Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg had to accept the award on Sade's behalf — signaling Adu's elusive nature as she rarely attends industry events or grants interviews.\n\nSince then, Sade has gone on to earn three more GRAMMYs, including Best Pop Vocal Album in 2001 for their fifth studio album, Lovers Rock. The win signified their staying power in the new millennium.\n\nIt Birthed The Band's Signature Song…\n\nWhile Diamond Life spawned timeless hits like \"Your Love Is King\" and \"Hang On to Your Love,\" \"Smooth Operator\" became the album's highest-charting single — and remains the most iconic song in their catalog. The seductive track about a cunning two-timer propelled the band into international stardom: \"Smooth Operator\" skyrocketed to No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and hit No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nEven non-Sade fans can identify \"Smooth Operator\" in an instant, from Adu's unmistakable vocals to that now-iconic instrumental saxophone solo. As of press time, it boasts over 400 million Spotify streams alone, and has remained a set list staple across every one of Sade's tours.\n\n…And It Houses Underrated Gems\n\n\"Smooth Operator\" may be Sade's commercial classic, but deep cuts like \"Frankie's First Affair,\" \"Cherry Pie,\" and \"I Will Be Your Friend\" are fan favorites that embody the band's heart and soul.\n\n\"Frankie's First Affair\" offers a surprisingly enchanting take on infidelity: \"Frankie, didn't I tell you, you've got the world in the palm of your hand/ Frankie, didn't I tell you they're running at your command.\" And, it's impossible to resist the funky groove that carries standout track \"Cherry Pie,\" which served as a catalyst for some of Sade's later, more dance-oriented hits, including \"Never As Good As the First Time\" and \"Paradise.\" Some of Sade's most poignant statements about lost love, including \"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\" from 2000's Lovers Rock, can be traced back to \"Cherry Pie.\"\n\nDiamond Life's penultimate song, \"I Will Be Your Friend,\" offers both solace and companionship — another recurring theme throughout Sade's music, from 1988's \"Keep Looking\" to 2010's \"In Another Time.\"\n\nIt Was The Best-Selling Debut Album By A British Female Singer For More Than Two Decades\n\nSade has sold tens of millions of albums worldwide, but Diamond Life remains the band's most commercially successful LP with over 7 million copies sold. Most of Sade's other platinum-selling LPs, including Diamond Life's follow-up, 1985's Promise, boast sales between four and six million copies.\n\nThe 7 million feat helped Sade set the record for best-selling debut album by a British female singer. She held the title for nearly 25 years until Leona Lewis' 2008 album Spirit, which has sold over 8 million copies globally.\n\nIt Introduced Sade Adu As A Style Icon\n\nWhen we first met Adu, her signature aesthetic consisted of a long, slicked-back ponytail, red lip, and gold hoops. Sade's impeccable style is front and center in early videos like \"When Am I Going to Make a Living,\" in which she sports an all-white ensemble paired with a pale gray, ankle-length trench coat and loafers.\n\nAdu rocked the model off-duty style long before it became a trend. Her oversized blazers, classic trousers, and head-to-toe denim looks were as effortless as they were chic and runway-ready — proving that less was more amid the decade of excess.\n\n\"It's now so acceptable to be wacky and have hair that goes in 101 directions and has several colours, and trendy, wacky clothes have become so acceptable that they're… conventional,\" Adu, who briefly worked as a fashion designer and model before pursuing music, told Rolling Stone in 1985. \"I don't like looking outrageous. I don't want to look like everybody else.\"\n\nIt Shined A Light On Larger Societal Issues\n\nWhile most of Diamond Life leans into love's ebbs and flows, a handful of tunes deal with financial strife coupled with a dose of optimism, as evidenced by \"When Am I Going to Make a Living\" and \"Sally.\" The latter song characterizes the Salvation Army as a young charitable woman: \"So put your hands together for Sally/ She's the one who cared for him/ Put your hands together for Sally/ She was there when his luck was running thin.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Adu, a then-starving artist, scribbled down portions of \"When Am I Going to Make a Living\" on the back of her cleaning ticket. The soul-stirring \"We are hungry, but we won't give in\" refrain emerges as a powerful mantra in the face of adversity and still holds relevance in 2024. Similar themes appear throughout Sade's later work, including unemployment (\"Feel No Pain\"), unwanted pregnancy (\"Tar Baby\"), survival (\"Jezebel\"), prejudice (\"Immigrant\"), and injustice (\"Slave Song\").\n\nDiamond Life closer \"Why Can't We Live Together\" is a well-done cover of Timmy Thomas' 1972 hit about the staggering Vietnam War deaths. The band wisely doesn't veer too far from the original recording, but Adu's distinctive contralto voice brings a haunting quality that's reminiscent of Billie Holiday.\n\nIt Ignited The Public's Ongoing Fascination With Sade Adu\n\nSince 1984, Sade has only released six studio albums, and a remarkable 14 years have passed since the group's last offering, 2010's Soldier of Love. Ironically, that scarcity — both in terms of music and access to the artist — has actually added to Adu's appeal. Case in point: Sade's sold-out Soldier of Love Tour grossed over $50 million in 2011, and the band still brings in close to 14 million monthly listeners on Spotify.\n\nAdu's striking beauty, mysterious persona, and knack for letting her music do all the talking has earned the admiration of her peers across genres and generations. Everyone from Beyoncé to Kanye West to Snoop Dogg have sung her praises. Drake even has two portrait-style tattoos of the singer on his torso. Prince reportedly described 1988's \"Love Is Stronger Than Pride\" as \"one of the most beautiful songs ever.\" Metalheads Chino Moreno of the Deftones and Greg Puciato of the Dillinger Escape Plan have also cited Adu as inspiration — showing that her influence runs far and wide.\n\nIn 2022, reports circulated that Sade was recording new music at Miraval Studios in France. But upon Diamond Life's 40th anniversary, \"Flower of the Universe\" and \"The Big Unknown\" from the respective soundtracks to 2018 films A Wrinkle in Time and Widows stand as Sade's latest releases.\n\nWhether fans get new music anytime soon remains to be seen, but the impressive repertoire of Adu, Denman, Hale, and Matthewman is one that aims to be truth-seeking and inspiring while exploring life's peaks and valleys. Diamond Life in particular holds up as one of the purest representations of the group's creative legacy, both commercially and musically.\n\nFrom quadruple platinum status to resonating with several generations, Diamond Life will forever stand as a remarkable debut — one that continues to influence music in a multitude of ways.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos"
