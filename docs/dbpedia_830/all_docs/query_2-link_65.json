        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nQueen Alicent has never felt more powerless than she does now, though she wears a crown and calls her husband King.\n\nWhat good is the power of a Queen unloved and always second to the ghost of a dead woman butchered in the birthing bed by the same husband that they share?\n\nHer beloved, dutiful son is left at the mercy of the Maester's needle, his blood pouring into a crimson river at her feet, and yet, her Kingly Husband spares no care for his son.\n\nFor her son.\n\nInstead, the King is lecturing the Kingsguard for failing to maintain the peace between a Prince of the Blood and two Bastards. \"How could you allow such a thing to happen? I will have answers,\" demands the King.\n\n\"Is the eye lost, Maester?\" she asks. There is blood beneath her nails, and she nimbles her lower lip as worry gnaws her heart.\n\n\"I am afraid not, Your Grace,\" the Maester, old, and she does not know if that man's loyalty to his Lords supersedes that of the loyalty all Septs owe to House Hightower, responds. \"It is already destroyed beyond any saving means and -\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" Lord Corlys bursts into the room, closely followed by his lady wife, who rushes towards her two sobbing granddaughters. They shed tears now, but there had been none for her Aemond who swallows back his sobs, unwilling to show any more weakness before Rhaenyra's allies.\n\nThe Crown Princess rushes too, inside the room, her shift barely appropriate for sleep, yet as always, the court remains blind to her impropriety. \"Luke, Jace!\" she exclaims, purple eyes wide as she takes in the sobbing bastards. Whose worst injury is a bloodied nose. \"Show me.\"\n\nAlicent purses her lips, her slim frame almost shaking in her rage as her son, injured and bloodied and clearly the one victim of savagery, is left ignored.\n\nLike always.\n\nYet, it is Alicent's duty as his mother to stand amid this Valyrian court that sees her son more tower than a dragon and demand justice.\n\n\"Who did this?\" Rhaenyra asks and damning enough, the youngest of her Brown-haired sons points at Aemond.\n\n\"They attacked me,\" her sweet Aemond protests at the accusation. Already, his fingers turned into fists because her son knows that his words, next to the King's favorite grandson, hold little weight.\n\n\"He stole Mother's dragon!\" Lady Baela screams right back. It is obvious that the eldest of the true Velaryon twins is more Daemon than her lady mother, for even as Rhaenys tries to hush her, there is false righteous anger in her protest.\n\n\"Enough,\" her kingly husband's voice is lost in the cacophony of children's voice.\n\n\"He was going to kill Jace!\"\n\n\"I didn't do anything!\" Alicent hears the sob building in her son's voice, desperate and frail, afraid as his voice is stifled by those more beloved than he will ever be.\n\n\"Silence!\" the King roars and Jace, Jace's damning whisper echoes in the hall.\n\n\"He called us bastards.\"\n\nAlicent freezes.\n\nShe distantly wonders when truth has become something to be afraid of. When has duty become so easily trappled upon when it has taken her own girlhood as blood price?\n\n\"Aemond,\" already, her second born tenses as his father, his father, turns to him. Viserys has never been one to be around his sons, preferring the natural sons of Aemma's daughter. His interest is something to be wary of, because Rhaenyra has always known how to use the dotting she benefits from into a blade against Alicent. \"I will have the truth of what happened. Now.\"\n\nTo be a Queen and a wife, Father had taught Alicent, means to bite your tongue and let your kingly husband reign as it is his right.\n\nBut to be a Mother, Alicent learned as no one stood for her precious boys, for the precious heirs Viserys had so desperately wanted, is to sometimes not be so silent.\n\n\"What else is there?\" her indignation and incredulity bleeds heavily in her voice. \"Your son has been maimed. Viciously. Her son is responsible.\"\n\n\"It was a regrettable accident-\"\n\n\"Accident?!\" Alicent grows shrill at her childhood friend. \"It was the Prince Lucerys who brought a blade to the ambush. He meant to kill my son!\" she then turns to her husband, the King, who she had never asked anything of him. \"Your son!\"\n\nRhaenyra remains undisturbed. \"It was my sons who were attacked and forced to defend themselves,\" she justifies, her chin jutted out and her bastards hiding behind her skirts. She too looks at the King, but unlike Alicent, there is no need for the Valyrian woman to beg, to ask for anything because her sire would sooner tear the Realm apart than deny her anything. \"Vile insults were levied against them.\"\n\nSomething in Alicent's chest crumbles.\n\nJustice seems to slip between her fingers, like ashes, and she swallows the shards of her broken duty to a man who will never protect his children.\n\n\"What insults?\" Viserys asks.\n\nThe Crown Princess straightens. Rhaenyra has always been a beautiful girl in their girlhood, yet now, Alicent finds the silver of her hair and the almost divine beauty of her gaze loathsome. \"The legitimacy of my sons' birth was put loudly to question. \" My sons are in line to inherit the Iron Throne, Your Grace. This is the highest of treasons. Prince Aemond must be sharply questioned so we might learn where he heard such slanders.\"\n\n\"Over an insult?!\" Alicent exclaims.\n\nAnother voice joins in, almost identical in their indignation.\n\nThe Crown searches for that voice who dares to intervene in the matters of the House of the Dragon. The crowd parts.\n\nAnd there, standing tall, is the Valyrian Household who have arrived but a Moon ago, but has already made waves into the Realm, bringing back the legacy of Old Valyria and its Magic.\n\nThough it is well past the Hour of the Wolf, they are fitted most elegantly, more so than half of the people in the Hall.\n\nAlicent notices that more guests have arrived in the Hall, too.\n\nMore people to see the King's contempt for his own son and the very thought of it burns.\n\nThe Lord Harry James Potter walks closer, escorting his lady wife till they stand close to the King. Rhaenyra's lips curve at the very sight.\n\nFor they are Valyrians, and Valyrians have always put their blood before all. Though, her Lord Father had wondered if their duty would see sense in supporting Aegon's right to the Iron Throne as custom and law dictates.\n\nAlicent does not know, and the sheer thought makes her pick at her nails till they are a mess of flesh and blood.\n\n\"Lord Potter,\" Viserys grows almost tired, as if ashamed for the scion of such a bloodline to see this. \"I am most ashamed for you to see my House in such a state. I ask that you and your household retire while the blood of the Dragon ceases this interminable infighting.\"\n\nLord Potter's eyes narrow. \"You mean you wish for us to leave so you can torture a child over a truth, right?\"\n\nThere is a pause, and then, Rhaenyra's smile dies like hundreds of others.\n\nSee this, Rhaenyra, Alicent thinks with the vicious edge of a scorned mother. See how even your precious Old Valyria will not stand for your lies.\n\nBlaise Zabini is not one who flinches at the cutthroat and vicious battles that come with titles and power.\n\nHe is a Slytherin, after all, and he is of Elara Black's court.\n\nHe has seen much, and even worse—or best, it depends on the perspective, truly—the lengths to which Elara would go to protect those she loves.\n\nThose she calls family.\n\nThose of her blood.\n\nAs such, it might come as some surprise to see her silent in front of such spectacle. Potter for one is left almost speechless and judging by the frequent glances he sneaks towards Elara, the Gryffindor must want to involve himself, unable to comprehend why their precious Elara is not putting a stop to this.\n\nWell, one cannot truly blame the Boy Who Lived. He is a Gryffindor. A Half-blood and he does not understand the apathy if loathing that most Purebloods hold for those without magic.\n\nHowever, that does not mean they are heartless, by any means.\n\nEven Theo - the Slytherin who wouldn't even blink in front of hundreds of Muggles' murders - cannot help but click his tongue in displeasure at the theatrics of a House that proclaims itself of the old blood and magic. Even Draco cannot help the clench of his jaw as a child - a child who looks almost like a Malfoy - suffers and his attackers proclaim themselves the victims and are justified in their actions.\n\nBut they are Muggles.\n\nAnd Elara has ordered them never to involve themselves with such matters for if they start involving themselves, the court will demand them to choose.\n\nBlack or Green.\n\nTradition or the King's laws.\n\nDoes it look like the Slytherins give a fuck?\n\nPardon his French.\n\nIt has been but a few days since they arrived and received by the place's monarchy, and their welcome lacks luster at best.\n\nSure, the Muggles try their best while planning a funeral, but Blaise is a Zabini, Elara is a Black and Draco is a Malfoy.\n\nThey are used to the splendor of generations of wealth. What they are not used to, however, is to have a Noble house - Merlin, royalty in this case though they are but cattle in their eyes - be so divided publicly.\n\nEven when Elara's Lord Father had been sorted into Gryffindor and started to viciously humiliate other Pureblood heirs with the cruelty known to his blood, the House of Black had never once faltered in their support of their heir once some upstarts wished for compensation.\n\nAnd Potter.\n\nDear, old Potter who manages to follow Elara into another world.\n\nWell, he is a Gryffindor at its core; he bleeds the Red and Gold, and what is more righteous than a Gryffindor next to an injustice?\n\nOh, right.\n\nElara Black in front of family betrayal. In front of flouted duty.\n\nTruly, Blaise does not understand Draco's sulking as his sister and the Golden Boy masquerade as a wedded and bedded couple. Sure, Potter has his problems, his flaws that Theo and Draco are always quick to point out.\n\nYet, it does not blur the truth: that Potter and Elara are well suited for each other, that their precious Slytherin's darling has already long since allowed the Half-blood to carve himself a place in her heart.\n\n\"Lord Potter,\" the old king mutters. His voice is frail, something almost hilarious because the old man is supposed to be a king yet he seems more like a doting grandfather unwilling to show the smallest favor to his least favorite daughter. That the Queen is his wife instead of daughter, with three children in their marriage, is something that even most Pureblood would find distasteful. \"I am most ashamed for you to see my House in such a state. I ask that you and your household retire while the blood of the Dragon ceases this interminable infighting.\"\n\nAt least, the man knows shame. Could have fooled Blaise.\n\nPotter's eyes narrow, Elara at his side, looks at him with fond, proud eyes. In the corner of his eyes, the heir of the Zabini is sure that Draco has thrown up a little in his mouth. \"You mean you wish for us to leave so you can torture a child over a truth, right?\"\n\nGo off, Potter.\n\nThe Crown Princess, who looks more like Pansy day by day though they could not be any more different as Parkinson is dark and all pug like, while the princess is all silver and aristocratic features.\n\nFunnily enough, Blaise finds the children of that same princess could look well in House Parkinson.\n\n\"A truth?\" the woman huffs. It is easy to see she is flustered. She had not expected Potter to not side with her, for the King has always moved Heaven and Earth for her. \"My Lord,\" she says, trying to be sweet, but the ire in her eyes is enough to make Elara notice. \"My sons are of Old Valyria's blood. They are heirs to the Iron Throne, and Prince Aemond's insults cannot be overlooked.\"\n\nShe would have better chances making a plea with Theo, who abhors muggles than with Potter whenever his delicate Gryffindor sensibilities are hurt.\n\n\"So, you want to have a child tortured?!\"\n\n\"Viled insults were levied against them!\"\n\n\"Yeah, I heard you the first time,\" Potter snarks. \"It doesn't sound any smarter.” Silence meets his declaration. “Princess,\" he then adds the title as if it is an afterthought. It probably is.\n\n\"Watch your tongue, boy,\" snarls the King's brother as he puts a hand to his sword. Theo shifts ever so slightly, ready to curse the Muggle at the smallest hint of Elara's will. \"Else, I'll have you fed to Caraxes and burned alive.\"\n\nOh.\n\nBad idea, Mudblood.\n\nElara responds without missing much of a beat, her tongue sharp as always. \"Watch yours, boy,\" she snaps back.\n\nThe Prince takes another step, a hand almost drawing from his sword from its sheath before Theo curses it to transform into a snake. The heir of House Nott has never taken kindly to threats, much less when it regards Elara.\n\nWhispers echo.\n\nThey always do whenever Magic is drawn, for the Muggles struggle to comprehend the might of such power. Sometimes, Blaise does pity them. For a second.\n\nPotter calls the snake to them, and the previous sword-turned snake slithers to his arm, hissing threateningly at his previous owner. Though Blaise has never been one to enjoy seeing Slytherin's noble skill in the hands of Harry freaking Potter of all people.\n\n\"You dare call me boy?!\" the prince hisses regardless, showing great disregard for his continued well-being, but alas, the Slytherin guesses that self-control and knowing when to respect your betters are skills too complex for such simple Muggles.\n\nElara sneers. \"I would call you much worse if I respected your King any less.\" Her grey eyes - proof of her lineage - sweep over the tall frame of the frothing older man as if thinking him lacking. There's a vicious curl to her lips, a glint that betrays her anger at being threatened, at Potter being treated with anything less than worship. At the very least, Blaise knows that Elara would react the same if it were Blaise who was insulted. A small consolation prize, but one must learn to adapt when in Elara Black's court - the court of the twice-damned traitor. \"Slave.\"\n\nThe crowd gasps. Murmurs, glancing between the scions of Magic and diluted blood, squibs most likely. Even the Queen falters, a delicate hand to her lips while her injured son frowns.\n\nThe Crown Princess is clenching her fists while Prince Daemon is all but snarling, willing to throw himself at Elara to tear her throat with bare teeth, though it will only get him crucioed if any Slytherin have a say in it.\n\n\"House Targaryen is of Old Valyria and a Dragon Riding House since before the Doom,\" King Viserys chokes out, looking already like half a corpse at the insult that Elara casts upon his blood. If the old man had wished for Elara and, as such, the rest of the Pureblood's favor, he should have kept his brother on a tighter leash. \"My Lady, such vile accusations -\"\n\n\"My lord husband is right,\" Elara interrupts the King as if interrupting royalty is a favorite pastime of hers. Potter preens ever so slightly at the compliment. \"You Targaryens do like to repeat yourselves.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon-\"\n\n\"You heard me, Targaryen,\" Elara sneers. She flicks her hair over her shoulder and Draco walks to her side, shoulders drawn tight and his brows creased as if he is in front of something most displeasing. His platinum hair shines in the torchlight, looking like spun white gold and sharply contrasting the common brown of the Crown Princess's children and the faded almost grey of the King. \"Our Blood is old and noble. Pure. Magical. I will not have the descendants of slaves threaten it.\"\n\nIt is as if Daemon Targaryen cannot hear her. Instead, the man is stuck on one word that makes him bare his teeth at the Slytherin court as if they are fangs. How ironic. A dog taking itself for a dragon.\n\nA muggle taking himself for someone worthy.\n\n\"You dare to call us slaves? You upstart!!\"\n\n\"Perhaps the Prince Daemon should try and read some history book,\" Theo intervenes. Ah, Theodore. Always the voice of the reason. \"If he is capable of such a simple task, that is.\" Ah, Theodore. Always a little piece of shit. Well, Blaise does not complain when it is others who suffer the brunt of his mockery, sometimes too sharp for it not to wound.\n\n\"A child is dying,\" a voice exclaims exasperately. \"Can we focus on what is important?\"\n\n\"Parce qu'insulter et rabaisser ce connard de prince n'est pas important?\" Theo blinks, not quite understanding the Gryffindor's bleeding heart as most raised within Death Eater's households tend to be. (Because insulting this jerk of a prince isn't important)\n\n\"C'est Saint Potter, tu t'attendais à quoi?\" Blaise sighs before hissing and glaring at Draco, who shoves a sharp elbow into his abdomen quite rudely. (It's Saint Potter, what were you expecting?)\n\n\"Que vous imbéciles réalisez qu'il y a du monde ici peuvent vous comprendre,\" Draco scolds as he slaps the back of their heads with a wandless spell Lady Grace has been quite fond of whenever she was to keep watch of the young pureblood heirs. (that you imbelices realise there's people here who can understand you)\n\n\"Merde Draco, pas si fort,\" Blaise hisses as he rubs the sore, now stinging spot. (Shit, Draco, not that hard)\n\n\"Ouais, sinon Blaise va perdre le peu de cervelle qui lui restait.\" Theo snorts, yelping as Elara sends all three of them a wandless, stinging hex. (Yeah, or else Blaise is going to lose his last braincell)\n\nAnother boy, silver-haired and stinking of booze, snorts a laugh, trying desperately to look as if he had not been listening and laughing, though he fails at such a task quite miserably.\n\nWell, Blaise is glad that their collective misery at playing guests with a muggle king who thinks himself wise and a princess who knows nothing of family duty is at least entertaining for some.\n\n\"Tu t'amuses bien?\" he whispers to the boy.\n\nIt is almost sad how his tired, cloud-tinted eyes brighten at the smallest acknowledgment, lapping up the small, teasing smile that Blaise shoots him with the eagerness of a starved dog.\n\nIt makes Blaise think of unpleasant things.\n\nUnpleasant memories.\n\nThe boy's answering nod is shy, if cautious.\n\nHe wears dark green, though it is not his House's colors.\n\nBlaise catches sight of an older man, wearing a dark green cloak and a copper pin depicting a hand, watches the gleam of greed spark into those cunning eyes and thinks, \"Oh, Elara is going to kill me.\"\n\nOtto Hightower, Father to a Queen and Grandfather to a future King, is not one to enjoy any of the Valyrian traditions that the reigning House holds so dear. However, it has been the Targaryens who united the realm through their dragons and as such, what is but a dutiful man to do except to bow in front of royalty?\n\nOtto is a second son.\n\nBorn to nothing if a noble name that will not do much for his children and legacy.\n\nSome second sons seek the glory of the battlefield, the celebrity of tourneys. But Otto is ill-suited for the more barbaric means of man, preferring to sharpen his mind to serve the Crown and the Realm. That is why he suits the role of Hand of the King so well. Why the reign of Viserys is known as peaceful while the man he had once known is lost to the shadows of his little Valyria.\n\nIn that regard, it is simply normal to push for Aegon, the firstborn son, to inherit the Iron Throne.\n\nIt is one thing to name a daughter heir if it means her deranged and tyrannical uncle is left disoriented. It is another to maintain her position when trueborn sons are born, and that very same daughter flounces her duty to the Realm by birthing bastards and disrespecting another powerful House.\n\nYet the King will not change the succession.\n\nAnd now, Crown Princess Rhaenyra's bastards have harmed his blood, his grandson and remain unpunished, the draw of blood passed as mere accident.\n\nIs this what Rhaenyra Targaryen's reign will be?\n\nThe beginning of ruin as bastards seek to steal trueborn children's inheritance in the same way the second Strong boy claims Driftmark as opposed to a true Velaryon?\n\nThe blindness of a woman who sees only her based-born boys and not the duty she should uphold?\n\nOtto has spared much thought about the Valyrian household since they have joined the Crown on their way to Driftmak. He has watched, whispered and bribed servants to know of those Valyrian who bring words of Magic, of another world in which Valyrians have escaped the Doom as well.\n\nHow can he bring them to Aegon's side?\n\nThe Lord Hightower knows well that Valyrians hold quite dearly their Valyrian roots. And purity, as Daemon's rants about Andal blood throughout his years have left nothing to the imagination.\n\nBut as much as Aegon is Hightower and Targaryen, Jacaerys is Strong and Targaryen, only one is born of sin while the other is born to rule.\n\nYet Lord Malfoy is quite indifferent in that regard, uninterested in the succession matters. His vassals, Lord Nott and Lord Zabini, share his stance, keeping silent about their liege lord and his lady sister.\n\nThere lays a slight, shall he say, ambivalence to which Otto is wary to thread. For a sister is a Lady of her own right, a Lady to which Lord Malfoy's vassals bow to.\n\nA sister who rises above a brother.\n\nAlicent does not see it, that much is clear. Perhaps it is because Otto has sheltered his daughter and has taught her so much of duty and knowing one's place that she forgets that not everyone has been blessed with such guidance. Not every father seeks greatness for their daughters. Not every father instills such virtue to their daughter. Otto wonders who is the Lady Elara’s father. Most certainly a dotting man of the likes of Viserys, an old frail man who has forgotten a woman's sensibilities and sought to make his daughter as happy as possible.\n\n\"So, you want to have a child tortured?!\" Lord Potter exclaims. Unlike the rest of his household, he wears his indignation and rage at seeing a Prince of Dragon blood so callously treated like a badge of honor. His eyes narrow at Princess Rhaenyra who tries to brush him off.\n\n\"Viled insults were levied against them!\"\n\nIf it were the King, such words would have been enough for the fighting to stop, to bow before a woman's whims, but Lord Potter is a Valyrian, and if Otto understands as it is his prerogative as Hand of the King, the most powerful.\n\nAs every dutiful and trueborn Lord should, the Lord Potter cares for the son who was mauled by a bastard.\n\n\"Yeah, I heard you the first time,\" the Valyrian Lord replies with the irony of a purebred noble. \"It doesn't sound any smarter.”\n\nSilence meets his declaration. “Princess,\" he then adds the title. It is obvious to Otto and all of the royal court present that the Lord Potter is not used to gifting courtesies to ones of superior or even equal standing as himself.\n\nFor any other Lord - even one of the Greater Houses - it would be treason, an execution-worthy offense. Yet for a Valyrian, dragon-speaking Lord of the Old Valyria with magic at his fingertips, not much can be said.\n\n\"Watch your tongue, boy,\" snarls Daemon as he puts a hand to his sword. \"Else, I'll have you fed to Caraxes and burned alive.\"\n\nOtto swallows back a smile.\n\nIt suits Daemon such recklessness, so sure of his royal and Valyrian blood, his patience is a thin, frail thing that will earn him nothing but disdain from the Valyrian Household.\n\nWell, the more Rhaenyra's faction seems displeasing, it only helps his blood.\n\nAnd Otto is sure that it will allow the Greens to reach new heights with such a force behind them.\n\nIf anything, it is almost a fortuitous thing for Aemond to claim Vhaegar and earn himself Lord Potter's attention.\n\nAlicent is used to linger in the shadows as the Lords decide matters of the Realm.\n\nShe is used to swallowing her words with an ease that only comes with practice.\n\nBut that is her son.\n\nHer secondborn, the sole babe that is hers and not the crowns.\n\nSomething in her chest eases at Lord Potter's fury at the cruel maiming of her precious child. How even the household of Old Valyria will not stand to see a prince of the blood treated so poorly by his own kin.\n\n\"A child is dying,\" Lord Potter exclaims with the ease of a lord who knows he will be heard, of a noble used for everyone to bow to his words. Such is the power of the Lord Harry James Potter. \"Can we focus on what is important?\"\n\nAlicent's grip tightens on her poor child, fingers hidden by the green of her night shift.\n\nPerhaps-\n\nPerhaps some justice will be served, she thinks, with the hope of a budding flower, like a starved man before a feast.\n\nBecause her kingly husband cannot ignore the demands of the Valyrian couple, not when they are of purest blood, not when they hold the gift of magic.\n\n\"It is a regrettable accident, my Lord,\" Rhaenyra tries to soothe tempers. She flashes the Lord a delicate smile, the like worthy of the Realm's Delight and many lords would have fallen over themselves at it.\n\nBut Lord Potter is a lord, true and noble, dutiful and wedded.\n\nHe does not blink but rather gives a disdainful sound that almost sounds like a scoff. \"Keep telling yourself that if it helps you sleep.\"\n\nAegon, her firstborn, her son who wasn't there to protect his younger brother, smothers a laugh.\n\nRhaenyra's cheeks bloom.\n\n\"My Lord,\" King Viserys interferes. He has never shown such strength when it came to defending her own son, but for Aemma's daughter, the crown suddenly means something to the old man she has wed for duty. \"Take care of how you're speaking, you are speaking to the Crown Princess.\"\n\n\"Crown Princess of Westeros she might be, but she is not ours, King Viserys,\" Lord Potter's lady wife argues. It is almost odd to see a woman speak in the place of her many Lords, because the Valyrian have always been a queer bloodline that cares almost not for the Andal's ways.\n\nLord Zabini nods, ever so ready to defend his lady.\n\nLord Potter rolls his eyes. his eyes to the King. \"And does the Crown Princess care that her brother has lost an eye?! Is she planning to teach her children from hurting another child?\"\n\n\"Half-brother,\" Rhaenyra objects, always quick to disavow Alicent's children from her own, always quick to remind Alicent why she wore green in the first place.\n\nAs Father has so often said, her precious sons will never be cared for by Rhaenyra, not when the Realm knows in their bones that it should be Aegon standing as heir rather than a princess with bastards as sons.\n\nLord Potter looks as if the Valyrian Princess has slapped him sharply across the face, as if he now sees Rhaenyra as Alicent has learned to see her. Disenchanted.\n\nAnd then, Lord Harry Potter - head of the Valyrian Household, Lord Husband to the Lady Elara, a precious legacy of Old Valyria nobility - turns his back on the Crown Princess of Westeros.\n\nIt is an insult.\n\nThe clear sign of him finding the woman lacking find the Heir to the Iron Throne unworthy to continue acknowledging.\n\nAlicent's lips curve into the smallest smile, though it dies easily on her lips as her sweet Aemond whimpers as the Maester continues to sew the wound.\n\n\"Elara,\" Lord Potter says. He calls his lady wife's name with the softness and love of tales. \"Can you heal him?\"\n\nSomething like hope surges into Alicent, like one of those waves that the Velaryons seem so keen to thread.\n\nLady Elara is cold, the perfect meekness of a noble lady, as she answers her husband. \"I am no healer, dearest.\"\n\n\"Then, anyone?\"\n\nThe Valyrian household looks at each other, quick and indifferent for a boy half their own.\n\nAlicent is Queen. Of noble lineage, yet she has never loathed her roots as she does now, for if she had been Valyrian, if her Aemond had not been tainted as Daemon likes to remind everyone, would something change?\n\nShe feels like she is drowning.\n\nLord Potter is no simple man. Yet the sorrow in his eyes makes him closer to men than he usually is.\n\nSweet Aemond withers next to her.\n\n\"Harry-\" Lady Elara whispers, cradling the cheek of her lord husband with a delicate hand. He takes a hold of it, nuzzles in a display of marital bliss one has never seen. \"The Muggle is not going to die, he will be fine-\"\n\n\"He's a child,\" Lord Harry interrupts, a sob strangled in his throat that makes the rest of his household avert their eyes for their lord's temporary emotional weakness is for his lady wife's eyes only. \"A child, Lara.\"\n\nLord Blaize interferes. \"Harry,\" he says with the reverence of a vassal to his lord. It must be it, for what else would that slight drawl be? \"You must see reason-\"\n\n\"A child was hurt, and his own family has denied him justice. Has denied his pain. Lara -\"\n\nLord Corlys, always quick to defend the boy who will sit on the Iron Throne with his House's name, interjects. \"Now that-\"\n\n\"I AM NOT SPEAKING TO YOU,\" Lord Harry roars at Lord Corlys, who tries to no avail to intercede in favor of his good daughter.\n\nLady Elara gently touches her lord husband's arms and his fury subsides, deflates, a flame deprived of oxygen. \"Beloved,\" she breathes, \"let this realm deal with his own matters. Won't you join me to bed, now?\"\n\nLord Harry's eyes glint in interest at her proposal but his lordly sensibilities, the duty that Alicent wishes her own lord husband sometimes remember as father of her children, stops him from doing so. \"You wouldn't have left me to suffer alone. You wouldn't have left any Slytherins to suffer alone.\"\n\nLady Elara's lips purse.\n\nPlease, Alicent prays fervently to the Mother to touch Lady Elara's heart.\n\n\"Theo,\" she finally says, turning to Lord Nott who seems quite detached with the entire situation. The lord acknowledges his lady's command and walks to stand before her, posture straight and eyes reverential.\n\n\"My lady,\" he says.\n\n\"Heal the child.\"\n\nQuite frankly, Alicent has never truly seen the Valyrian household wear the same disgust as Daemon does for all Andal-bloodied, though the hypocrisy burns when he acknowledges the bastard borns of Rhaenyra as if they are not similarly Andal tainted. But Lord Theodore's Valyrian arrogance bleeds true as his brow shifts in the wake of his lady's demand.\n\n\"He is a Muggle,\" Lord Nott highlights, something complicated playing at his features.\n\nLord Harry snarls at that. \"He's a child.\"\n\n\"A Muggle child,\" Lord Nott repeats. He then turns to his lady, and again, the idea of a Valyrian girl rising above her brother is jarring and almost frightening for the reputation that bolsters Rhaenyra's claim, though Lord Harry's previous actions will damper it if only slightly. \"Lara-\" The discourtesy does not go unnoticed as Lady Elara's lord brother bristles at his vassal's disrespect. \"Do not ask this of me. Don't ask me to help a muggle. I - I won't do it.\"\n\nAlicent nibles on her lips. Copper stains her tongue. Her fingers, a mess of torn flesh and blood. Aemond.\n\nHer poor Aemond.\n\nBecause if a lord - pureblooded, noble and a man refuses, can anything be done?\n\nNo.\n\nAlicent has learned so very early in her own girlhood.\n\n\"Theodore Nott.\" Lady Elara's voice echoes in the hall, sharp as a whip, regalness true and clear. \"I am not asking.\"\n\n\"Elara-\"\n\n\"Do not forget yourself, Nott,\" Lady Elara's chin tilts ever so slightly. Lord Harry's mouth gaps open, as if mesmerized in seeing his lady wife so sure, so powerful, so bright. \"I am Slytherin's Queen. You answer to me. You obey what I demand.\"\n\nLord Nott thins his lips into a straight line. He bows deeply. \"And I hear it, my lady.\" The Valyrian lord then approaches her sweet boy who's battered body almost trembles at the idea of a blessing, of a miracle that would save him from the damage the bastards have done.\n\nAs for Alicent, she stares unabashedly as so many Lords do at Lady Elara Black.\n\nQueen, she had called herself.\n\nQueen when she has a lord brother.\n\nQueen yet her lord husband does not command the other lords as his lady wife does, does not command his entire household as a King would.\n\nWhat-?"
