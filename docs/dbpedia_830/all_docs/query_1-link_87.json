        "text": "As we approach the two month mark since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the UK and much of the world remains on lockdown there is some positive news with this week’s announcement that the UK may have reached the peak of the Coronavirus outbreak. I’m experiencing a cautious sense of optimism and found it very interesting this week to speak to lots of clients and partners and hear their thoughts.\n\nAs millions return to work in China and many countries start to ease lockdown in phases I wanted to take a look at how our lives may have changed when we finally emerge from our homes and back into ‘real’ life.\n\nDay-to-day life – will it ever be the same?\n\nOne thing’s for sure - the longer we are ‘locked in’ the more it will affect our sense of economic confidence, our financial, investment and lifestyle decisions. From borrowing money to saving, from the holidays we take, to our homes and their locations. Do we want to live in crowded cities? Do we crave more space? Will we now be buying with space for an office/study in mind? As we refocus on what’s important to us, will we begin to grow more food than buy it as we did after the Great Depression? Will there be a boom in allotments and those seeking garden/outdoor space? Will entertainment and our social lives revolve around board games and online quizzes instead of movies and restaurants?\n\nThe way we meet and greet is bound to change. Wave goodbye to handshakes, and casual hugs and kisses. A few of our clients in the UAE report being asked to avoid nose-to-nose greetings. Expect to see more safe-distance greetings next time you have that business meeting (that some of us - yours truly included! - are craving) and an interesting thought – will this leave people less keen to engage in physical ways to show politeness or affection in the long term?\n\nPersonal space has become more important to us all. Things we took for granted pre-COVID are likely to change. The thought of getting your hair cut or sitting on a crowded plane or train feels almost unthinkable to many right now. Interestingly in Wuhan, China, some people now refuse to leave their homes and have developed signs of social anxiety and agoraphobia for obvious reasons. Part of the fallout will be a huge focus on mental health and demand for services.\n\nI find myself asking why I am writing about all of this – call it therapy!\n\nOverall, I have a feeling that people may emerge more risk-averse – certainly in the coming months - which got me wondering whether this sense of fear will restrict entrepreneurship? Will there be less start-ups? New businesses are likely to be based online, and potentially to hire and borrow less?\n\nGlobal travel\n\nAside from the effect on the hospitality sector, another preoccupation for the people I have been speaking to, has been global travel, with many stating that they plan to travel less and even restrict travel entirely until a vaccine is developed\n\n“Why would you put yourself at risk and confine yourself with hundreds of people in a small tube”?\n\nIt took 3 years for the airline industry to recover post-9/11 and two years for the 2008 global financial crisis; how long will it take to recover to early 2020 levels? 4 years? 5 years? Maybe 6? I can see it undergoing a dramatic transformation as the price for recovery.\n\nI really do think there will be a drive globally for electronic passports and IDs – or even “immunity passports” and as I mentioned last week, Emirates have already started screen passengers before boarding and I think we could start to see this globally.\n\nAirbnb could flourish as people take control of sanitising and creating their ‘own’ personal space vs having to meet/check in and relying on others to clean/sanitise.\n\nOne thing I noticed on my travels to Asia is how many people were wearing masks - I imagine due to SARS and MERS - which clearly changed their culture. I can see the mask becoming a wardrobe staple – one client based in Hong Kong recently mentioned that a friend told him that he now feels almost naked walking barefaced in public\n\nWe’ve seen ‘staycations’ gaining popularity for many years here in the UK and many popular UK resorts are likely to boom as a result – especially the high end/luxury sector as the wealthy splash their cash on local extravagances vs the annual trip to Barbados. Could we even see a resurrection of the classic road trip?!\n\nWorkplace and technology\n\nThis is where I think we’ll experience the biggest impact. Almost all clients I have spoken to have said that they have recently loved the flexibility and efficiency of working from home. Sure, we all miss the social interaction and the odd post-work pint, but the big elephant in the room:\n\nWill we still need offices as we know them, or could ‘closed plan’ see a resurgence? Could this mean the death of co-working and shared space?\n\nAlthough we’ve all no doubt had Zoom teething problems and dropouts set to a background of screaming children, technology such as instant messaging (like Slack and WhatApp) and productivity tools (such as Todoist and Monday.com) mean we can be as, if not more, productive. I’ve certainly been thinking about how many days a week I want to do the 3-hour round commute to our London office when I could be using time work more efficiently, exercise or even spend time with the family.\n\nWe’ve definitely become more comfortable with remote technology as we’ve been forced to embrace it in order to get on (even my 6-year-old son has learned to master Zoom for his weekly online Karate class). Could this be a perfect time for the rise of the robots? Maybe automated cleaning will become common very soon? I can certainly see some companies using lockdown as an excuse to replace people with some form of automation as the likes of Amazon have done recently.\n\nI do think that most businesses will rush to re-establish their values, think about efficiency, re-energise their teams and product and overall be slicker. We will emerge with less time for procrastination and bureaucracy, and more emphasis on collaboration, and work/life balance. I really think that companies that show empathy, care and humanity will be those that flourish post-COVID.\n\nSustainability and the environment\n\nMaybe it is just coincidental but as the world locks down, here in the UK we have had weeks of abnormally good weather. As many have said to me recently – its feels like the world is ‘breathing again’ and recent data shows that pollution is down over 40% in most UK cities. According to CNN, people in India are seeing the Himalayas for the first time in 30 years as a result of reduced air pollution, and it isn’t just cleaner air and skies that we are seeing. In Venice, the canals are clearer than ever before, with dolphins and jellyfish returning.\n\nI’ve noticed more vivid, bluer skies on my morning run with hardly any vapour trails in the air, and I’m sure the birdsong is louder!\n\nWe’re already thinking more about the environment and sustainability. Thousands of us are buying seed and greenhouses so we can become more self-sufficient. Could this be the way many future developments go? Both residential and hotel? Would you be more likely to buy or stay if a site was totally self-sufficient and grew its own food in its own organic garden?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how life will change?\n\nSo, as we emerge from lockdown, staring down the barrel of an economic recession or, as some predict, Great Depression v2, all we can do is look after our nearest and dearest, hope for the best and seek some positivity in the shared experience. Life certainly won’t be the same for some time to come, but we will prosper and recover. I, for one, have turned off news notifications on my phone!\n\nWe must be grateful for what we have and for all those on the front line, from NHS/healthcare workers, to teachers and postmen (and a lot more in addition), who are working so hard for us all.\n\nAs always, it would be good to hear your opinions and thoughts. Please feel free to share your comments either below of my messaging me directly.\n\nSupporting the people supporting us\n\nAt this time, there seems no bigger or tangible impact than to support those on the frontline of this global crisis and with that we have decided to donate the Foundation's efforts towards two charities - to support our #nhsheroes and #healthcareheroes global efforts towards protecting those on the frontline.\n\nIf you would like to support either of these efforts, I've included links below to their fundraising pages:\n\nDuty to Care - Providing support via online consultation to improve and sustain the mental health and wellbeing of healthcare professionals."
