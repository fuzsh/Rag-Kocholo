        "text": "Harold Wayne Knight was born on April 26, 1941, in Fresno, California to Moultry Cornelius and Alma Ruth (Brannon) Knight.\n\nHe and his family moved to Spade Mountain Community when he was just a toddler. Harold attended Rabbit Trap School until 8th grade. He told of himself being Valedictorian of his class. He then laughed and said that there were only 3 of us. One quit and the other moved. Harold graduated from Stilwell High School in 1959. Soon after, he went to work in California for Hunt’s Foods and for the next 6 years he cooked ketchup.\n\nHarold married Lillian Ruth Hamlin on November 11, 1966. They were married for 55 years with many good memories to cherish. Harold was training horses when they married. After a couple of years, he transitioned to driving a feed truck for Hudson Foods. Over the years, he worked as a shop foreman, feed dispatcher / logistics manager, and broiler supervisor. Tyson Foods bought out Hudson and Harold worked for several more years before retiring in 2003. In addition to working his full-time job, Harold raised commercial chickens, cattle, horses and two daughters, otherwise known as his fillies (Kitten and Whipper).\n\nHarold lived most of his adult life in Bunch, Oklahoma. Horses and coon hunting were his favorite hobbies. But he also enjoyed playing the guitar and singing, spending time with the guys at the hunting cabin, and fishing at the watershed lake. There was also Friday and Saturday night fun at Big Dad and Granny Knight’s (Moultry and Alma Ruth’s).\n\nHarold was generous, ready to help others, devoted to his family, and comical. He thoroughly enjoyed his grandchildren. He loved taking them for adventures over the place, fishing, and to the creek.\n\nHarold departed this life on Thursday, December 23, 2021, at Baptist Health Hospital in Ft. Smith, Arkansas with his wife and daughters by his side.\n\nHarold was preceded in death by his parents and sister, Pat Goodwin.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Lillian Knight of the home ; daughters: Meleah Withers and husband Bruce of Hillsboro, TX; Nikki Starr and husband Alan of Stilwell, OK; siblings: Leon Goodwin (brother-in-law) of Stilwell, OK; Barbara Silver and husband Dainus of Canton, GA; Jerry Knight and wife Debbie of Stilwell, OK, Gary Knight and wife LaDonna of Harrah, OK; grandchildren: Kate Withers, Audra Withers, Lydia Withers, and Stetson Starr; other family; and friends.\n\nMemorial services were held at 10 am on Tuesday, December 28, 2021 at Roberts/Reed-Culver Chapel, Stilwell, OK with Pastor Max Ford officiating."
