Sakyo Komatsu (小松 左京, Komatsu Sakyō), born Minoru Komatsu (小松 実, Komatsu Minoru) and formerly known by the pen name Minoru Mori (モリ・ミノル, Mori Minoru), was a Japanese science fiction novelist. Regarded as one of the most well-known science fiction writers in Japan, he is perhaps best recognized for the 1973 story Japan Sinks, which has inspired numerous adaptations and continuations. These include two live-action films, two television series, two radio dramas, a sequel novel co-authored by Komatsu and Koshu Tani, a Netflix animated series, and more. Several of his other stories including Virus, ESPY, Sayonara Jupiter, and Tokyo Blackout have also been adapted to film by Toho and Daiei. Komatsu passed away at age 80 due to pneumonia on July 26, 2011.
