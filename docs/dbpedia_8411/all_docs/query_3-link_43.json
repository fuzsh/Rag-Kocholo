        "text": "Check out Episode 33 of the Read Japanese Literature podcast, The End of the World—Japanese Apocalypse, part 1.\n\nIn part one of this three part episode, we’re looking at apocalyptic and dystopian fiction as genres. Their origins in Western and Central Asia. Their evolution in Western Europe. And a history of English-language apocalyptic and dystopian storytelling that will provide us with context and a basis for comparison when we turn to Japanese stories in part two.\n\n(Transcript of part 1.)\n\nCheck out Episode 34 of the Read Japanese Literature podcast, The End of the World—Japanese Apocalypse, part 2.\n\nIn part two of this three part episode, we’re looking at the apocalyptic and dystopian fiction of Japan.\n\nWe’ll begin with the evolution of the idea of “the end of the world” in Japan, especially after Japan started importing American and European science fiction. We’ll move on to Japanese apocalyptic stories, especially between 1945 and the 1970s and then during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPart two mistakenly implies Jules Verne was an Anglo-American author. He was, obviously, French.\n\n(Transcript of part 2.)\n\nCheck out Episode 35 of the Read Japanese Literature podcast, the End of the World—Japanese Apocalypse, part 3.\n\nPart three examines the two most recent “eras” of Japanese apocalyptic fiction—1995-2011 and post 3/11/2011. It also takes a close look at the work of Yoko Tawada, especially her novel The Emissary, also published under the title The Last Children of Tokyo.\n\n(Transcript of part 3.)\n\nCW: brief mentions of historical and fictional violence and rape\n\nThis episode’s artwork is adapted from a photograph by Du Truong, “The Student of Gunkanjima”. Gunkanjima, also known as Hashima Island, is an abandoned island in Nagasaki Prefecture.
