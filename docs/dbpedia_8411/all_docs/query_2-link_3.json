        "text": "Sakyo Komatsu, one of the leading science-fiction writers of Japan, whose 1973 best-selling book, “Japan Sinks,” rattled a nation that sits on one of the most earthquake-prone zones in the world, died on July 26 in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. He was 80.\n\nThe cause was pneumonia, representatives of his publication, Sakyo Komatsu Magazine, told Japanese news organizations.\n\nMr. Komatsu’s premise in “Japan Sinks” was that the tectonic plates that grind beneath the Japanese archipelago undergo a sudden colossal shift, setting off a chain reaction of volcanoes that spew torrents of lava, tsunamis that inundate cities, earthquakes that shatter the countryside and the deaths of millions of people.\n\nThe unpredictability underlying the theme was made clear this year on March 11, when Japan was struck by an earthquake and a tsunami that set off a nuclear-plant disaster. In the issue of his quarterly magazine published on July 21, Mr. Komatsu said he hoped to see how his country would evolve after the catastrophe.\n\n“I had thought I wouldn’t mind dying any day,” he wrote. “But now I’m feeling like living a little bit longer and seeing how Japan will go on hereafter.”\n\nBeyond the apocalyptic plot, the book delves into interpersonal relations, how the Japanese might cope with the end of their world and how dispersed survivors might fare in willing host countries. But there is no resolution; the story ends with boat people watching the waves swallow their homeland.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
