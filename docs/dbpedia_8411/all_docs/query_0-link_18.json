        "text": "Science-fiction writer Sakyo Komatsu rattled Japan with his 1973 book Japan Sinks. Its premise was that the tectonic plates that grind beneath the Japanese archipelago undergo a sudden colossal shift, setting off a chain reaction of volcanoes that spew torrents of lava, tsunamis that inundate cities, earthquakes that shatter the countryside and the deaths of millions of people.\n\nThe unpredictability underlying the theme was made clear this year on March 11, when Japan was struck by an earthquake and a tsunami that set off a nuclear-plant disaster. In the issue of his quarterly magazine published on July 21, Komatsu said he hoped to see how his country would evolve after the catastrophe.\n\n''I had thought I wouldn't mind dying any day,'' he wrote. ''But now I'm feeling like living a little bit longer and seeing how Japan will go on hereafter.''\n\nJapan Sinks sold more than 4 million copies in Japan, was published in the US three years later and inspired two Japanese disaster movies and a television series. A 1973 article in The New York Times said it was ''a chillingly realistic work of science fiction'' by an author ''who evidently knows his geophysics''.\n\nWith Shin'ichi Hoshi and Yasutaka Tsutsui, Komatsu was considered one of the masters of Japanese science fiction.\n\nMinoru ''Sakyo'' Komatsu was born in Osaka on January 28, 1931. He received a degree in Italian literature in 1954 from Kyoto University and later worked as a magazine editor, factory foreman and comedy scriptwriter. In 1961, he entered a science-fiction writing competition: Peace on Earth was a story in which World War II does not end in 1945 and a young man prepares to defend Japan against the Allied invasion. Komatsu received an honourable mention and 5000 yen.\n\nThe next year, he won the contest with his story Memoirs of an Eccentric Time Traveller. His first novel, The Japanese Apache, was published two years later and sold 50,000 copies.\n\nAfter the success of Japan Sinks - it was the highest-grossing movie in Japan's history - filmmakers returned to Komatsu time and again for source material. In 1984, he stepped behind the camera to direct Sayonara Jupiter. Critically panned and a box-office flop, it didn't curb Komatsu's success as a writer, or stem his imaginative flow: he wrote more than a dozen novels.\n\nKomatsu was haunted by memories from his teenage years of the devastation caused by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he told the Japanese newspaper The Daily Yomiuri in 2006."
