        "text": "Katsu Kokichi’s autobiography, “Musui’s Story,” documents the life of a samurai in Japan’s late Tokugawa period who adopted the name Musui in his retirement. Katsu is something of a black sheep within his family, being largely uneducated and deemed unfit for the bureaucratic office 's samurai of his standing were expected to hold. As such, he typifies in many ways the lower ronin, or masterless samurai, many of whom famously led roaming, directionless lives and wreaked havoc among the urban poor and merchant classes. The novel addresses the decaying power of samurai throughout the Tokugawa period and depicts their struggle to find purpose. Throughout the story, Katsu is impacted by three interconnected systems of power that impact his life\n\nThe time after the fifteen hundreds marked a time of great change in Asian countries. Places like China saw a new dynasty take control of the country. And almost every Asian civilization from India to Indonesia came in contact with people from western nations which changed the way people did business and the way Asians viewed the world. Japan, however, seemed to keep separate from the rest of Asia in the way that they were hesitant to deal with westerners. Despite their separateness, this period in time still brought an immense amount of change to Japan and its culture. The autobiography titled Musui's Story shows what life was like during Japan's time of change. When taking Musui's Story in context, one can see not\n\nThe artwork Blinded by the Light (1991) by Yasumasa Morimura is an appropriation of Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s The Blind Leading the Blind (1568) (Israel, 2005). Morimura has appropriated paintings and photographs throughout the ages, though The Blind Leading the Blind is the earliest dated work that Morimura has appropriated (Marsh, Watts, & Maylon, 1999). Morimura super-imposes a composite self-portrait on top of Bruegel’s painting, successfully changing the meaning of the piece. The different historical contexts of the two pieces in conjunction with appropriation allow the accumulation of ideas to present two separate meanings pertinent to the ideals of the times. Morimura’s simultaneous use of the historical and religious aspects of The\n\nShe earned her master of fine arts in 2005 with a focus on fiction (Yiyun). “Persimmons” is a short story told by a group of older men sitting around a tree. They are in the middle of a drought, so their crops and animals are dying, and they are left with nothing to do. They tell the story of Lao Da, the protagonist of the story. After his son was murdered, Lao Da planned revenge\n\nThe author who brought to us The Tale of Genji, a novel now regarded as the first written novel in history, left behind an arguably more treasurable artifact: a diary that opens a window into history. The Diary of Lady Murasaki by Lady Murasaki Shikibu gives the reader a glimpse of the imperial court during eleventh century Japan and presents the past in an illuminated vision. Being an attendant in the imperial court, Lady Murasaki is frequently involved with the activities of elite Japanese women. Her day-to-day interaction with the nobles and elites enhance her account with the curious perspective of an elite female. As a woman, Lady Murasaki's descriptions are oriented around clothing\n\nIn this essay, I am critiquing the article “In the name of love” by Miya Tokumitsu. I will be using style. Tokumitsu uses style to help the audience to think about how certain things mean to them and how you must find what you like to do in life. The authority is shown throughout the article by talking about how risky it is to find out what you love and to do it. I will also be using coverage. Tokumitsu shows a great use of coverage by telling in the article about doing what you love.\n\nIt is no secret that for centuries, the Japanese woman has been, to most observers, a model of elegance and graceful beauty. A picture of a kimono-clad, modest, and often silent woman has been plastered everywhere, allowing for the upmost passive subjection. If we look deeper into this image of woman, can we tell if this picture is complete? How do these women painted in representative images far in the modern world? The ideal woman in Japan is expected to be both a good wife, and a wise mother. Though these seem like reasonable expectations, there is a much deeper meaning to them that has shown signs of being outdated. During the 1800’s and 1900’s, women were subjected to society’s vision of them, and could not break free for fear of the\n\nConservation: The pōhutukawa has many threats, one of the most dangerous ones is the bushtail possum. The possum eats a lot of different plants and trees, but is favourite one is the pohutukawa. It eats mature leaves in winter, and new young leaves in spring, on mature trees, causing the tree to die. Some people who care and love the pohutukawa has set up group to control possums in the replanted areas. The group is called The Project Crimson Trust.\n\nIn the story, Zenkei Shibayama helps us understand a true love from ancient times in China. At the beginning of the story, Chokan, who lives in Koshu in Chine, has two children, but the elder children died when she was young. Therefore, he loves Sen-jo, who is the younger children and is a beautiful girl, too much. Like many people in his country, he decides to choice her lovers when she is young. Finally, he decides to choose Ochu because he is a good person. Ochu and Sen-jo had a good time together when they was young. Moreover, they think they will get marry when they grow up. Unfortunately, for some reasons, Sen-jo's father changes his decision and Sen-jo has to marry Hinryo. Sen-jo and Ochu are astonished too much about this situation.\n\nA famous Japanese writer Ihara Saikaku, born in 1642, was a son of a wealthy merchant in Osaka. He had a wife and three kids, one of which was blind and in addition to taking care of his family, he learned to write haikai poetry and comics at a young age. Since his wife died at a young age, he became adventurous as “he traveled extensively writing about the various parts of the country” (Rollins, para.4). One of his first novels is called Koshoku Ichidai Otoko in 1682, which led to Saikaku becoming the first Japanese writer able to reflect the life of the modern city Japan and how he supported equality.\n\nKomatsu Sakyo reveals his ideas on science fiction by making critical comments on the socialist trends of science fiction in the 1960s. At first, he questions whether monster should be eliminated in science fiction. Komatsu argues that monsters in SF which could evokes fear to readers should be considered as an emotional expression of views of values, life, and the universe of the times. In particular, he talks about Godzilla figure that is a “symbol of primitive horror” revived in modern era; that specifically evokes fear in relation to nuclear war; furthers he asserts that monster is an in-between being that could mediate human beings and a thing-in-itself (47). In this way, his thoughts on monster seem different that of Abe mentioned\n\nUzumaki Kushina (henceforth “Kushina-sensei” at her own insistence) was not a very good teacher. She lacked patience, she tended to forget what she had taught the lesson previous, and she often skipped over things that she thought were unimportant, only to have to explain them a few minutes later when she realized their full significance.\n\nMikoto is physically in healthy shape since he has always been in sports since he was a child up until the end of high school. Cognitively, Mikoto has improved tremendously. Despite his learning disability he was able to overcome it and do well in his writing and English classes. Mikoto has also been able to show a greater sense of understanding what is right and wrong, and what is expected of him. Mikoto has also shown to be very trust worthy and has grown as a person. Mikoto’s social-emotional development seems to be well. Mikoto is very popular and even has a girlfriend. Although Mikoto sometimes is still moody he is reminded that we are here for him if he ever wants to talk about what’s on his mind. I predicted from the beginning that although"
