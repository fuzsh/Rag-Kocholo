He has also won the 1981 Izumi Kyoka award, the 1989 Kawabata Yasunari award, and the 1992 Japan SF award. In 1997, he was decorated as a Chevalier Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.\n\nHis work is known for its dark humour and satirical content. He has often satirized Japanese taboos such as disabilities and the Tenno system, and has been victim to much criticism as a result.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1996, he went on a writing-strike to protest the excessive, self-imposed restraint of Japanese publishers.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nVoice Acting Roles\n\nSort\n\nMost Recent\n\nFavorites\n\nStart Date\n\nTitle\n\nMovie, 2006\n\nSupporting\n\n3 Favorites\n\n3\n\nIs there a casting role here that shouldn't be?
