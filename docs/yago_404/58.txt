Quentin Jerome Tarantino ( ; born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker. His films are characterized by stylized violence, extended dialogue often with profanity, and references to popular culture. During Tarantino's career, his films have garnered a cult following, as well as critical and commercial success; he has been considered "the single most influential director of his generation". He is the recipient of two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.

Tarantino began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of the neo-noir crime drama film Reservoir Dogs in 1992. His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a dark comedy crime thriller, was a major success with critics and audiences winning numerous awards, including the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or and the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. In 1996, he wrote and starred in the action-horror film From Dusk till Dawn. Tarantino's third film, the crime drama Jackie Brown (1997), paid homage to blaxploitation films.
