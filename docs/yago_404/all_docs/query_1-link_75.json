        "text": "He is often called the greatest director of his generation — most often by himself. Yet Quentin Tarantino, who’s been cawing about his unparalleled genius for well over 20 years now, has just seen his latest film, “The Hateful Eight,” snubbed by the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild.\n\nEarly screenings have left several critics unimpressed, remarking on the length — over three hours, with a 12-minute intermission — the lack of action and excessively verbose dialogue.\n\n“Excruciatingly bad” is how The Post’s Kyle Smith put it.\n\n“A three-hour Western that’s windy both inside and out,” said The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“A difficult movie by a director who’s not known for making them,” said the Onion’s A.V. Club.\n\nNo matter. Tarantino thinks it’s completely Oscar-caliber and anyone who doesn’t like it is a loser.\n\n“I think it could be my best movie,” he told GQ magazine a few weeks ago. “If not, at least in my top four.” As for the Oscars, “I think we are a contender,” he said. “We’ll see. But it is one of those weird things. Wow — have I gotten so popular that I can do weird-ass s–t like this and it actually is a commercial entity?”\n\nAnd so Quentin Tarantino, self-proclaimed savior of American cinema, begins another round of insufferable self-promotion.\n\nKing of the neg\n\nEver since Tarantino gate-crashed Hollywood in 1992 with “Reservoir Dogs,” he’s been hailed as a singular American filmmaker, a master at cracked narratives, sharp-yet-discursive dialogue and an ironic treatment of guts and gore.\n\nHis masterpiece, 1994’s “Pulp Fiction,” resurrected John Travolta’s career, turned Samuel L. Jackson into a movie star and anointed Tarantino as Gen-X’s premier filmmaker.\n\nHe was 31 years old, a former video-store clerk who’d dropped out of high school in ninth grade and never had a girlfriend till age 25. For someone raised by an adoring single mom in Torrance, Calif. — historically, one of the safest cities in America — Tarantino had an appreciation for violence that could only come from someone never really exposed to it.\n\nYet here he was, the future of American cinema.\n\nHe had also, even then, begun making enemies, personally and professionally. He was Kanye before Kanye.\n\n“I’m in with the gods, all right?” he told Larry King in 1994. “I am. I’m right up there in heaven with, you know, Zeus, God and Mohammed.”\n\nAnother self-description: “Movies are my religion, and God is my patron.”\n\nFor all the acclaim, “Pulp Fiction” was widely called out — most notably by filmmaker Spike Lee — for its liberal use of the N-word. Unbowed, Tarantino repeated the word 38 times in his next film, “Jackie Brown,” which he called an homage to ’70s blaxploitation cinema. Lee was livid.\n\n“Quentin is infatuated with that word,” Lee said. “What does he want — to be made an honorary black man?”\n\n“As a writer, I demand the right to write any character in the world that I want to write,” Tarantino replied. “And to say that I can’t do that because I’m white . . . That is racist.”\n\nLee wasn’t alone. Denzel Washington told GQ magazine that when Tarantino was working as an uncredited script doctor on the 1995 thriller “Crimson Tide,” they got into a fight over what Washington felt was racist dialogue. Washington was also incensed over Tarantino’s previous, liberal use of the N-word and ripped into him on set.\n\nTarantino asked if they could go somewhere private.\n\n“No,” Washington said. “If we’re going to discuss it, let’s discuss it now.”\n\nWashington apologized to Tarantino seven years later, which may have been a mistake — because even now, apparently no black man of stature can convince Tarantino that he’s wrong. In one of several appearances on “Charlie Rose” — interviews that drag Rose to new lows of sycophancy — Tarantino said that the “enduring quality” of his 2012 slavery Western “Django Unchained” (N-word usage: 113 times) was “true empowerment for the black male.”\n\nNemesis Spike Lee took to Twitter. “American slavery was not a Sergio Leone Western,” he wrote. “It was a Holocaust.”\n\nTarantino also did himself no favors when he derided “Selma,” last year’s critically acclaimed feature about Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1965 civil rights march.\n\nDirected by Ava DuVernay — one of the few black female directors in Hollywood — “Selma” was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Today, it has a 99% favorable rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nA far as Tarantino is concerned, however, DuVernay’s film was a glorified made-for-TV movie.\n\n“She did a really good job on ‘Selma,’ ” he told The New York Times Magazine in October. “But ‘Selma’ deserved an Emmy.”\n\nTwo days after that story ran, Tarantino tried to walk back that comment, telling Indiewire, “I haven’t seen it.”\n\nA few weeks ago, DuVernay publicly responded to Tarantino’s insults. “I was surprised by how surprised everyone was,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. “When you look at his work and his persona, there’s nothing surprising about what he said. But it didn’t bother me like so many assumed it would.”\n\nTarantino also picked on “It Follows,” the sleeper hit of the summer. It was written and directed by the young filmmaker David Robert Mitchell, who had a breakout year.\n\nIt wasn’t good enough for Tarantino, though. Mitchell, he said, “broke his mythology left, right and center . . . it’s one of those movies that’s so good, you get mad at it for not being great.”\n\nPerhaps this is why Tarantino himself doesn’t have an Oscar for Best Director or Best Picture: He has no problem cutting down other filmmakers while describing himself, over and over, as a genius without peer.\n\n‘Egotistical and fragile’\n\nA brief, if painfully homogenous, list of Tarantino’s peers: David Fincher. Steven Soderbergh. Christopher Nolan. Wes Anderson. Paul Thomas Anderson. Spike Jonze. Richard Linklater. Ang Lee. David O. Russell. The Coen brothers. Alejandro González Iñárritu.\n\nAll are critically revered and commercially successful, have highly specific visions, work fluently in various genres and do so without constantly, publicly expounding upon their genius. Yet when Tarantino’s talking , it’s easy to forget that other — let alone superior — filmmakers of his generation exist.\n\n“He’s a pretty aggressive presence,” says one entertainment writer who interviewed Tarantino for “Django Unchained.”\n\n“He seemed like one of these Hollywood-bubble types who you could just not have a normal conversation with . . . It was weird how egotistical and fragile he was.”\n\nIn 2014, Tarantino filed a lawsuit against Gawker for linking to the first draft of “The Hateful Eight.” (He soon withdrew the suit.) Enraged, Tarantino announced that he was going to punish us all by not going through with the movie.\n\n“I’ve got 20 more where that came from,” he said.\n\nLast week, he told Howard Stern that his attitude was, “I’m gonna take my blocks and go home. I’m gonna teach Hollywood a lesson and deprive you of my genius.”\n\nRecently, Tarantino sat down with New York magazine and The New York Times Magazine to promote the movie he said he’d never make. What emerged from both is a man who seems stuck in 1994: He listens to mix tapes. He is barely online. He watches television news and doesn’t stream movies. He claims to handwrite all his screenplays. He lives in a house stuffed with movie memorabilia — including huge green “Hulk” hands and a “Planet of the Apes” statue by his swimming pool — and has said his ideal woman is a Playmate who would let him watch movies all day.\n\nHe told Stern that he tapes TV shows on VHS — superior, he said, to LaserDisc and DVD. He seems unaware that documents, film and images now live forever in the cloud.\n\nView video\n\n“Tapes on VHS will be there 20 years, 30 years from now,” Tarantino said. Not that there will be many contemporary films he’ll want to watch. Over the past few months, Tarantino’s been throwing shade with all the deftness of a 13-year-old Mean Girl.\n\nOn Fincher, who most recently directed the blockbuster thriller “Gone Girl”: “Even when I don’t like his movies, I walk around thinking about them for a week or so.”\n\nHe said he liked Anderson’s “Grand Budapest Hotel” because “I wasn’t a die-hard fan before, [which] made me even more happy that I could finally embrace him.”\n\nOf Judd Apatow, who directed Amy Schumer’s summer breakout “Trainwreck”: “His audience is getting smaller and smaller, but I think he’s getting better and better.”\n\nSo far, “Trainwreck” has grossed over $110 million domestically.\n\nHe also went on to slam multiple-Academy Award winner Cate Blanchett’s filmography. “They’re all just like these arty things,” he said. “I don’t think most of them have a shelf life.”\n\nHe called the first season of HBO’s “True Detective” — the kind of critical and cultural phenomenon Tarantino hasn’t enjoyed in decades — “really boring.”\n\nTarantino loves to talk about his career as unblemished, a string of hit after hit, which he’ll keep pure by stopping at 10 feature films.\n\nHe conveniently leaves out his work on the dud anthology “Four Rooms,” his screenplay for “From Dusk till Dawn” (in which he co-starred) and his 2007 bomb “Death Proof” — which starred Russell, also in “The Hateful Eight.” Curious how that hasn’t come up.\n\nAs technically accomplished as Tarantino’s movies are, you don’t see them rerun on TV all that much. He’s a ripoff artist, stealing scenes wholesale from other movies.\n\nUma Thurman and Travolta’s famous dance in “Pulp Fiction” came right from Fellini’s “8½.”\n\nIn 2004, The Guardian ran a devastating piece citing all the obscure films Tarantino stole from in making “Kill Bill: Vol. 2.”\n\n“Tarantino’s ‘borrowing,’ ” said the paper, “has reached epic proportions.”\n\nIn 2009, the UK Independent said that Tarantino had “proved his critics right” by becoming little more than a “schlock and awe merchant,” employing mutilation, scalpings, dismemberment and anal rape as sight gags.\n\nThe New Yorker’s David Denby called 2009’s “Inglourious Basterds,” Tarantino’s reimagined Nazi thriller, “ridiculously and appallingly insensitive.”\n\nNot that he cares. Shortly after, none other than Charlie Rose read him that critique, and Tarantino brushed it aside, going on to explain why he believes in God: “The glory in what I do is the fact that it starts with a blank piece of paper,” he said.\n\n“You look at something like ‘Inglourious Basterds’ and that did — if my mother never met my father, that would not exist in any way, shape or form.”\n\nRename the Oscar ‘The Quentin’\n\n“The Hateful Eight” doesn’t open until Christmas Day, going up against the surefire mega-hit “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” Tarantino’s infamous bravado crumbled last week, when he told Stern that Disney forced Hollywood’s famed Arclight Theatre to book “Star Wars” for the full month, breaking a prior deal to run “The Hateful Eight.” He worries what it augurs for the success of his movie.\n\n“They are going out of their way to f–k me,” Tarantino said.\n\n“They didn’t need to be this vindictive. There’s a few movies coming out around the same time . . . none of us are any serious competition to ‘Star Wars.’ ”\n\nAs for the Oscars, Tarantino says he doesn’t want a Best Director Oscar anyway. He’s got two for screenwriting and wants to tie Woody Allen for three, then surpass him with at least four.\n\n“I want to have more original-screenplay Oscars than anybody who’s ever lived,” he told GQ in December. “So much, I want to have so many that — four is enough. And do it within 10 ﬁlms, all right, so that when I die, they rename the original-screenplay Oscar ‘the Quentin.’ And everybody’s down with that.”"
