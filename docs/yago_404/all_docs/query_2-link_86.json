        "text": "Django Unchained\n\nDjango is the tenth film produced by Quentin Tarantino and it is the best performer at the box office. The film starts in 1858 where a bounty hunter finds a slave named Django in order to help his search for three wanted brothers. Django agrees and the two go on an adventure. Once they get the brothers, the bounty hunter agrees to help Django get his wife back. They find themselves at a large plantation and have to fight their way out. Overall, I give Django an 9/10 because the fighting scenes are eccentric and the story is good.\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nPulp Fiction is the second movie that Quentin Tarantino produced and it is widely regarded as the best. It takes place in the 1970’s and the movie switches between many different storylines. It tells the story of two hit men, two diner robbers, a boxer, and a gangster. This may sound confusing but to put it simply, all the characters play a role in the whole thing. Just like most of Tarantino’s movies there are many flashbacks and the movie skips around in order to show how the characters got there and why they are all related. Overall I give Pulp Fiction a 8.5/10 because I enjoy how the story continuously changes. I also liked the vibe of the 70’s setting.\n\nHateful Eight\n\nThe Hateful Eight is the eleventh movie that Tarantino produced. This movie takes place in 1877 where a few bounty hunters meet and travel together in order to get to town safely. However, when they stop at a hotel on the way they find themselves in some trouble. This movie, like most Tarantino films, has lots of violence and plot twists. These characteristics mixed with the filming make the film interesting. Overall I give The Hateful Eight a 7.5/10 because it was good but not great. Although it was interesting the film lacks the flashbacks and fighting scenes that other Tarantino movies are known for.\n\nReservoir Dogs\n\nReservoir Dogs is the first movie that Quentin Tarantino produced. The basis of the movie is a jewelry heist that goes wrong when the cops show up immediately after they enter the bank. This leaves the thieves scrambling and wondering which one snitched. Throughout the movie there are lots of plot twists and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Although this was his first movie it still displays Tarantino’s film style. Overall, I give Reservoir Dogs a 8/10 since the setting is limited. I wish there was more of the bank robbery shown especially because most of the time they are in the warehouse. Another thing that I disliked is how it ended; however, I can see the purpose behind the ending.\n\nKill Bill\n\nKill Bill is the 4th movie Tarantino produced. It takes place in Japan when a bride and her family get assassinated at a wedding. However, they fail to take out the bride and she seeks revenge on the people and organization that betrayed her. This movie is also filmed like a Tarantino film where the timeline is slowly revealed with flashbacks and cutscenes in order to keep some information a mystery and keep you guessing what will happen next. Overall, I would give Kill Bill an 8/10 since the story is interesting and the fighting scenes are really long and extravagant."
