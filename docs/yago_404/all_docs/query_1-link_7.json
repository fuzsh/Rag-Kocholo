        "text": "Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed Pulp Fiction, which received the Palme d’Or at Cannes, a Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay, and seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Director, and won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay. He wrote and directed the critical and audience favorites Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown, and his screenplay True Romance was directed by Tony Scott. He also wrote and acted in the film From Dusk Till Dawn, executive produced projects including From Dusk Till Dawn, Killing Zoe, and Curdled, and starred opposite Marisa Tomei in Wait Until Dark on Broadway.\n\nPraise\n\n“Tarantino’s scripts have a way of reworking the classic genres. The plots and characters are familiar, but Tarantino’s structure and dialogue transcend any category. . . . Tarantino writes old-fashioned movie dialogue—the kind of speeches and banter and chat that actors love to say. . . . Quentin Tarantino is walking, talking proof that you can violate the rules and flourish in Hollywood.”\n\n—Lynn Hirschberg, Vanity Fair\n\n“Quentin Tarantino [is] the poet laureate of Bad Boy Chic.”\n\n—Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times"
