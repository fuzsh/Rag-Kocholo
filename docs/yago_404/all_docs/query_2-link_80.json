        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has said many times he will only make 10 films in his career. His latest release “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie is the 9th instalment to the Tarantino Ten.\n\nWhile everyone waits on the edge of their seat waiting for his 10th, and final, film here are 9 drinks to celebrate, and pair with, Tarantino’s existing 9 films:\n\n1. Reservoir Dogs\n\nThis cult film follows a band of diamond thieves whose planned heist of a jewellery store goes terribly wrong. Reservoir Dogs introduces themes such as violent crime and pop culture references which have become trademark for Tarantino. A bold and glass of red wine. The 2017 Prosperitas McLaren Vale Shiraz, suits perfectly, and bottle design reflects the colour palette of this movie effortlessly.\n\n2. Pulp Fiction\n\nArguably Tarantino’s most famous film, Pulp Fiction, was the first independent film to gross over 200 million dollars at the box office. A thick and creamy milkshake, with a cherry on top, is the perfect drink to celebrate this iconic movie which made him into a household name.\n\n3. Jackie Brown\n\nJackie Brown is the only film which Tarantino has adapted from previous work. To pay homage to the film’s source material, Elmore Leonard’s Rum Punch, the perfect drink pairing would be a rum of your choice. It could be served as a refreshing Pina Colada or just a simple Rum & Coke, you can’t go wrong either way.\n\n4. Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2\n\nEven by Quentin Tarantino’s standards, Kill Bill, became a surprise smash hit. This movie has many iconic scenes which continue to be referenced in pop culture. To complement the crazy ride of Vol. 1, a vodka cranberry fits the endless sprays of blood. Moving on to the sequel, a few glasses of a smooth high-quality tequila will make you feel lright there with Uma Thurman before the last East-meets-West sword fight.\n\n5. Death Proof\n\nOften labelled as Tarantino’s “worst film,” Death Proof pays homage to the slasher and muscle car films of the 1970s. People love to hate this film, Empire Magazine described it as “Tarantino driving wildly under the influence” but “seriously entertaining.” Enjoy watching this horror flick with a glass of the award winning Prosperitas 2018 Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon. This rich red wine will pair faultlessly with the bloody chaos of this movie.\n\n6. Inglourious Basterds\n\nInglourious Basterds (purposefully spelt wrong by Tarantino himself) tells the tale of two different plans to assassinate the political leaders of Nazi Germany. The perfect drink pairing for this movie would be a glass of scotch, celebrating one of its most famous scenes in which an undercover spy is uncovered when he orders scotch with an Americanised hand gesture.\n\n7. Django Unchained\n\nThis movie highlights one of America’s most iconic landscapes: The Wild West. However, it doesn’t lack any of Tarantino’s flare with its combination of unlikely humour, memorable characters, and lots of fake blood. Rejoice in Quentin Tarantino’s genuine love for the wild west by sipping on a glass of bourbon and enjoy this Academy Award winning movie.\n\n8. The Hateful Eight\n\nIn the dead of winter in Wyoming, The Hateful Eight, follows a bounty hunter and his prisoner as they seek refuge from a blizzard in a cabin and come across a collection of nefarious characters. Stay cool, calm and collected with an ice cold glass of beer. Tarantino, himself has been known to enjoy a few Australian beers from time to time.\n\n9. Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood"
