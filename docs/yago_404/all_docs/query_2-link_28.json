        "text": "Turns out the Hollywood Theatre doesn’t have a monopoly on Quentin Tarantino-centric events.\n\nFrom March 22 to 28, Cinemagic will present a screening series dedicated to Tarantino and his influences, showcasing not only Reservoir Dogs (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994) and Inglourious Basterds (2009), but three films that inspired them.\n\nThat includes the Hong Kong action flick City on Fire (1987), which influenced Reservoir’s Mexican standoff. It’ll be followed by Godard’s Bande à part, which informed Fiction and provided the name of Tarantino’s production company (Bande also received a memorable shoutout in Bernardo Bertolucci’s underrated The Dreamers).\n\nFinishing up the festival is Robert Aldrich’s The Dirty Dozen (1967), which provided the narrative framework for the World War II revenge saga of Basterds (though Aldrich’s film has noticeably fewer flamethrowers than Tarantino’s).\n\n2024 has already been a big year for Cinemagic. The theater has continued to cement its reputation as a hub for fans of kaiju movies, while continuing to work on a lobby expansion project."
