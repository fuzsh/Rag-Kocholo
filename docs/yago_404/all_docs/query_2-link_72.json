        "text": "I was just watching a commercial for Tony Jaa’s new film The Protector and it said Quentin Tarantino Presents: Tony Jaa in The Protector. Now about a week ago I saw a commercial for it and there was no mention of QT presenting it. Are the Weinstein’s using QTs name just to draw more people to these movies? I dont have a problem with it really, but it seems like they throw QTs name on every Asian action film that comes out these days. Weird.\n\nWell… it’s not really that weird. QT’s name has become really valuble when it comes to marketing. But yeah, I think it’s a bit annoying that they use his name for commercial purposes on a movie that he has nothing to do with in the first place.\n\n[quote=“mushroomcloud”]\n\nWell… it’s not really that weird.[/quote]\n\nSorry, I meant it was weird that his name wasnt used on the first commercial I saw. Suddenly it was added at the last minute it seems.\n\nWhat pisses me off is that as someone who works in a video store, you get people who think that Tarantino directed Hostel and such. They say things like, “well, it is Tarantino” and “Tarantino’s new film”. I find it totally fucking annoying. They must think that Tarantino is extremely prolific. Plus, no offense to the other directors, but their films tend not to be as groundbreaking or as good as Tarantino’s. That doesn’t stand for all of the ones he has presented, but for most.\n\nBut I do feel sorry for Avery with his Killing Zoe dvd case. Tarantino’s name is all over the thing. All he wants is to be his own director. It must be very annoying.\n\nit’s because the Weinstein Co is publishing it, and I guess they have a deal with QT where they can put his name on it if its an indie/asian film.\n\njust ignore that people, and watch tony jaa kick some major as in what is also called “tom jum goong” or something like that\n\n[quote=“Angel”]\n\nWhat pisses me off is that as someone who works in a video store, you get people who think that Tarantino directed Hostel and such.

Ong Bak is easily one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Someone said its as good as 80’s hk action, well I’d like the names of these films if thats so because I truly doubt that. I love the fact that they actually hit people. Thats bleeding for your art.\n\nOng Bak was great in that I, as an asian action film fan, found it thoroughly exciting and also a friend of mine, who is into martial arts, really enjoyed it too and he always gets roped into those crappy films like Pit Fighter that are just there too showcase an individual’s martial arts skills. Ong Bak managed to have gritty realistic martial arts while still being an entertaining film. Sounds easy, but nowadays it is quite rare.\n\n[quote=“Mr. Blonde’s Accomplice”]\n\nHahahahahahahaha, WOW…they must be retarded. WOW.\n\n[/quote]\n\nNot nearly as retarded as the people who think that Hero was a Quentin Tarantino film. It’s in Chinese for Christ’s sake.\n\nSomebody said that Once Upon a time in Mexico was QT to me once. I stared at them blankly and then said do you get out much?\n\nAnd I hate it when they blah blah presents blah blah. You would think the DIrector of the movie presents it right? lol\n\nQuentin Tarantino Presents Pulp Fiction\n\nQuentin Tarantino Presents Reservoir Dogs\n\nQuentin Tarantino Presents Kill Bill\n\nQuentin Tarantino Presents Jackie Brown\n\nI like that more than\n\nQuentin Tarantino Presents a movie he had nothing to do with.\n\nYeah, but most of the time Quentin has a part in getting the film here as it was and he did do some small things on Hostel. But, it still doesn’t make any real sense.\n\nThe film’s name is actually Tom Yum Goong, while The Protector was some Jackie Chan American flick from the 80’s with Danny Aielo. But Harvey hates Asians, so he hopes to ruin their films, either through crappy names or through crappy ad campaigns. In this case, he appears to have done both, since he advertised the film at the last minute.\n\n[quote=“WinslowLeach”]\n\nSorry, I meant it was weird that his name wasnt used on the first commercial I saw.

They’ve played it on SBS a couple of times. The chinese track with subtitles."
