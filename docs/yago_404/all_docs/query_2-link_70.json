        "text": "If you are a Quentin Tarantino fan, you will remember that his first ever directed film was 'Reservoir Dogs' and it was filmed completely in the greater Los Angeles area. Since then, a brilliant careeer has taken Quentin to some of the most unbelievable places to shoot. From Japanese cities for the 'Kill Bill' franchise to European settings for 'Inglorious Basterds'. The acclaimed director has also stated multiple times that he would only direct 10 films in total and then he would retire. We are now on the 10th film's production process and Tarantino wants to end with a bang in the most poetic possible manner. His previous film was a love letter to the film industry, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' was a smash hit from any angle you want to look at it.\n\nHis final film is titled 'The Movie Critic' and it will follow the life of a movie critic in the greater Los Angeles area. For Quentin Tarantino, filming his final project in that city is the only way to go for him. In a recent statement, Quentin Tarantino said the following statement about his final film's location. He said: \"I love shooting in California. I started directing movies here and it is only fitting that I shoot my final motion picture in the cinema capital of the world. There is nothing like shooting in my hometown; the crews are the best I've ever worked with, and the locations are amazing. The producers and I are thrilled to be making No. 10 in Los Angeles.\"\n\nTarantino may also have his lead to star in 'The Movie Critic'"
