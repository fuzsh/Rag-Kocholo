Their destination is a trucker bar called the Titty Twister, where all they have to do is have a few drinks and wait for the sun to come up. There's only one problem: this particular saloon is a haven for the undead. Faced with the fanged clientele, the brothers will have to team up with a faithless pastor, his innocent children, and a motley assortment of vampire hunters in order to see the morning."
