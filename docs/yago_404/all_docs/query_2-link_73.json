The film will be set in Southern California 1977.\n\nTarantino said that he read reviews of this journalist in a magazine when he was a teenager. Tarantino said that he had found the critic very rude but at the same time very funny.\n\nTarantino said that even though the critic wrote like he was 55-year-old, the guy was actually in his mid-30s and died in late 30s.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is known for his iconic films like Pulp Fiction, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill series and others.\n\nFAQs\n\nQ1. What is the age of Quentin Tarantino?\n\nA1. Quentin Tarantino is 60-year-old.\n\nQ2. How old is Quentin Tarantino during his first movie?\n\nA2. Quentin Tarantino was 28-year-old when first film Reservoir Dogs released in 1992.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nDisclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.
