Before moving to the UK, Wilde attended Syracuse University in New York State, majoring in Drama and Anthropology. She continued her education in London, studying Drama, Classical Mime, and Art History, before joining Britain’s largest classical mime troupe, SILENTS.\n\nWilde has performed in cabaret in Bangkok, Thailand; robotically danced in the Indian blockbuster, JANBAAZ; was a vicious thug in Michael Winner’s DEATH WISH 3; and played a drummer in the so-called “Holy Grail of unfinished and unreleased 80’s horror”: GRIZZLY II: THE CONCERT, which also featured then unknowns George Clooney, Laura Dern and Charlie Sheen.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Wilde danced professionally at the top nightclubs and rock venues of New York, London and Amsterdam with her group, SHOCK. SHOCK released two singles on RCA Records and supported such artists as Gary Numan, Ultravox, Depeche Mode and Adam and the Ants.\n\nWilde wrote and presented eight music and film review TV programs in the 1980s and 1990s, interviewing such pop personalities as Iggy Pop, The Sisters of Mercy, The B-52s, and Johnny Rotten, as well as actors Nicolas Cage and Hugh Grant. Wilde was also a Casting Director for the BBC’s THE BUDDHA OF SUBURBIA and for MTV’s THE REAL WORLD: LONDON.\n\nIn 2009-2015, Wilde contributed short stories to 14 horror or crime anthologies and publications.\n\nIn 2012, Comet Press published Wilde’s debut serial killer novel, THE VENUS COMPLEX.\"\n\n---------\n\nChildren of the Night: From Blu-ray.com: \"A secluded colony of child vampires come under attack from vengeful villagers in this darkly funny horror tale by Argentinean filmmaker Ivan Noel. A journalist visits a secluded orphanage where children suffer from an unknown skin disease. She soon learns that they are in fact not children, but vampires aging from 4 to 120 years old and who have been bitten at an early age and forever remain in that physical state. They are led and protected by a strange and deeply religious ex-nurse whose destiny in life is to find these 'lost souls' and raise them in her sanctuary. Through religious teachings, nocturnal rituals and the occasional visit to local towns for fresh human blood, she keeps them safe – that is until a cultish band of men from a nearby village plot to destroy the refuge. Now the children, headed by the 90-year-old grandson of Count Dracula, must defend their way of life\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nDirector's commentary\n\nMaking of featurette\n\nTrailer\"\n\nArtsploitation Films is gearing up to release Children of the Night on Blu-ray and DVD September 29th."
