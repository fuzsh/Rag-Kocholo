        "text": "In a stunning move, director Quentin Tarantino has reportedly decided not to continue with The Movie Critic, Deadine reports. Instead, Tarantino will reportedly be going back to the drawing board to decide what his final movie will be, leaving The Movie Critic alongside his numerous other ideas that never really came to fruition.\n\nThe news was subsequently corroborated by Variety. IGN has reached out to Sony Pictures as well as Tarantino's representatives for comment.\n\nDeadline reports that Tarantino abandoned the film, which was reportedly set to star Brad Pitt, after a \"change of heart.\" According to Tarantino, it was originally intended to be based on a real-life writer whose reviews were a cross between \"early Howard stern and what what Travis Bickle [Robert DeNiroâ€™s character in Taxi Driver] might be if he were a film critic.\"\n\nThe film underwent various rewrites through 2023, which reportedly delayed production. Then, suddenly, Tarantino apparently decided to pivot and move on. It's certainly not the first time that Tarantino has dropped an idea that he has touted. The various ideas floated by Tarantino over the years only to be abandoned include an R-rated Star Trek, a third Kill Bill film, and more.\n\nThere's still a chance that Tarantino will return to the concept, as he did with The Hateful Eight, but for now it seems like he's moving on to other ideas.\n\nThumbnail credit: Picture Alliance/Getty Images\n\nKat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
