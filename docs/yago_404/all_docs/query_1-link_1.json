They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nThe following article is a List of awards and nominations received by Quentin Tarantino.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is an American director, producer, and screenwriter. Over his career he has received numerous accolades including two Academy Awards, three British Academy Film Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, a Cannes Film Festival Award, four Critics' Choice Movie Awards, and two Independent Spirit Awards as well as nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award and five Grammy Awards.\n\nFor his work on the independent crime thriller Pulp Fiction (1994), Tarantino received the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or.
