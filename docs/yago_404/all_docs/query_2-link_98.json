        "text": "The theatrical release of Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” back in summer 2019 was met with strong box office numbers and critical acclaim. But for many fans, it was also a wrenching reminder that Tarantino’s time as a feature film director is almost over.\n\nThe writer-director has long maintained that he will retire from filmmaking after 10 movies. “Hollywood” marked Tarantino’s ninth feature film (that’s counting “Kill Bill Vol. 1” and “Kill Bill Vol. 2” as one movie), which means the world is only getting one more Tarantino movie before he calls it quits. During a much-buzzed about interview with GQ Australia, Tarantino reminded his fans he is extremely serious when it comes to his retirement plans.\n\n“I think when it comes to theatrical movies, I’ve come to the end of the road,” Tarantino said. “I see myself writing film books and starting to write theater, so I’ll still be creative. I just think I’ve given all I have to give to movies.”\n\nThis has resulted in one of the most pressing questions in Hollywood: What will be Quentin Tarantino’s last feature film? The answer opened the door to many enticing possibilities. And while Tarantino has confirmed his last film is called “The Movie Critic,” about a journalist for a “porno rag,” he’s also spoken about countless other projects that could’ve been the lucky last entry in his filmography. Here are 21 unmade Tarantino projects that either never got off the ground or were abandoned at some point in development.\n\n[Editor’s note: The following was published in October 2019 and has been updated multiple times since.] With editorial contribution by Marcos Franco."
