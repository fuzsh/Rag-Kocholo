        "text": "[quote]NO DIRECTORS SHOULD WORK WITH QT!!\n\nNever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever!!!\n\n[/quote]\n\nDo you fear we could see something equally brilliant as “From Dusk Till Dawn”?\n\nThere is only one actor that comes to mind who should work with Tarantino:\n\nClint Eastwood should have a part in Glorious Bastards, that would be nice. Just a bigger cameo, you know.\n\n[quote]ahh yes i forgot some\n\nactors: John Malkovich, Ed Harris(THAT IS WHO SHOULD BE IN GB for Eastwood’s part He was fantastic in The Rock) Robin Williams(such comic energy) Pierce Brosnan, Christopher Lee, Benicio Del Toro\n\nDirectors: Coen Brothers, Barry Sonnifield(God can u imagine Get Shorty 2 ÃƒÅ ÃƒÅ and Martin Scorsese\n\nA Scorsese / Tarantino film would work and damm well might surpass Citizen Kane\n\nGo Raiders[/quote]\n\nSebber: I dont hate FDTD, but I dont think its as good as True Romance, Dogs, Pulp, Jackie, and its NOT!! You must realize that! ÃƒÅ Why didnt QT direct it? BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WASNT AS GOOD AS HIS OTHER FILMS!!! I dont love any film thats directed by Robert “Mexican Michael Bay” Rodriguez, but I do love all of QTs films. Theres a difference. Wake up sonny.\n\nPulpmeister: I can understand QT working with different actors, but why would you wanna see him make a film with another director? I never want to see a joint film by QT and someone else (yeah yeah I know From Dusk Till Dawn was a collaboration, big fuckin deal). QT is a director, when he works on a film by himself, he works with all kinds of great people anyway. By saying that, your saying QT isnt good enough on his own. Thats no good. ÃƒÅ\n\nThe Citizen Kane comment: Scorsese won the Palm D’Or for Taxi Driver in 1976. Tarantino won the Palm D’or (Best Film at Cannes) in 1994 for Pulp Fiction. It was his SECOND FILM!!! For godssake Pulp Fiction IS the Citizen Kane of its time!!! It had an effect on popular culture all over the world. Not many movies can do that.\n\n[quote]ToothPicVega you talk about joint directorial films. The Coen Brothers made such great movies as Raising Arizona, Miller’s Crossing and Fargo. I am just saying there are a lot of great directors who grew up in the moviegeek generation. I would just like to see if 2 styles can blend seamlessly.\n\nOkay and as far as the Citizen Kane comment the Palm D Or is a FRENCH SNOB award. Lets see what the 2 great filmmakers can accomplish when they combine their styles\n\n[/quote]\n\nTheres a difference between QT and the Coens. QT is one guy. The Coens are BROTHERS. They work as a team. QT is his own team, he writes and directs, why would he need to work with another great director on a film? Its not necessary. I want to see a 100% QT envisioned film, not a half n halfer: QT/Scorsese film or a QT/Spike Lee film, etc. It makes no sense.\n\nThe Palm D’Or IS a French Snob award, but I was just making the point clear that QT is a director who’s been recognized for his work by a prestigious group of judges who know about film. QT doesnt need Scorsese to make a film."
