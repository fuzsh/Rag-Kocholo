        "text": "It’s a show that may actually work better for those completely unfamiliar with the 1996 film starring George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, and Salma Hayek. Comparisons to its bigger-budget, higher-profile predecessor do the show few favors and the storytelling offers no surprises for those who know the tale. And so enjoyment of it becomes a matter of execution, which is a mixed bag in episode one. Some casting choices are inspired, others awkward. Some style choices by Rodriguez simmer, others fizzle. Again, reviewing a new series based on just one episode proves difficult. Every element that could be developed in an interesting way feels balanced by a decision that seems unlikely to be corrected.\n\nIf you’ve seen the first ten minutes of the film, you know where the premiere of “From Dusk Till Dawn” will go, just with extended flashbacks and scenes of dialogue to flesh out characters and get the feature film running time to a 10-episode arc. So, yes, you won’t be surprised that you don't get to the Titty Twister (the strip club that was the central location of the film) in episode one, as the majority of the episode involves the recreation of the shoot-out that opens the film.\n\nTexas Rangers Earl McGraw (Don Johnson) and Freddie Gonzalez (Jesse Garcia) have stepped out of the clichéd cop handbook to guide the action of the premiere. Of course, McGraw is the grizzled vet who warns young family man Gonzalez that the job will pull him away from his family in ways that should deter him from even trying to have one. You half-expect McGraw to say \"I'm getting too old for this sh*t\" even if Johnson sells the cliché in a believable manner. When the crotchety old cop goes into a local liquor store in his border town, his life changes forever."
