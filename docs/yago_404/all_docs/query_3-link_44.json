As they head for Mexico, the brothers meet the Fuller family heading the same way. They take the family hostage and continue the trip in the Fullers' RV. Chaos breaks out when they stop at a bar to meet the cartel king who offered them shelter. The bar is home to vampires and becomes the scene of another fight in a reimagining of a 1996 movie by the same title, created by Robert Rodriguez, who brought that version to the big screen. This time it's for his channel, El Rey.",
