Praise

“Tarantino’s scripts have a way of reworking the classic genres. The plots and characters are familiar, but Tarantino’s structure and dialogue transcend any category. . . . Tarantino writes old-fashioned movie dialogue—the kind of speeches and banter and chat that actors love to say. . . . Quentin Tarantino is walking, talking proof that you can violate the rules and flourish in Hollywood.”

—Lynn Hirschberg, Vanity Fair

“Quentin Tarantino [is] the poet laureate of Bad Boy Chic.”

—Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times
