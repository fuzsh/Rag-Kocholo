        "text": "When I sit down to do my homeschool planning every year, one of the things I look forward to the most is choosing which picture study artists we will be studying. Sometimes I opt to go with great artists from the time period we’re studying. For instance, this year, in particular, I chose to go with famous artists from a specific era and part of the world (the Yuan Dynasty) because we’re reading about Marco Polo’s travels. And sometimes, I pick an artist who isn’t related to anything else we’re studying, but I think their work might especially resonate with my kids.\n\nI often run into the problem of not being able to narrow down my choices. I have been known to change our artist at the last second because I found a different one I thought was a better choice. I’m thankful each of my kids will have a full 12 years for picture study (36 artists in all!) and knowing all of those great works of art because there are so many from which to choose!\n\nIn the past, I’ve written about how to choose an artist for picture study, and today, I’m offering a list of picture study artists from the 19th century. These are most certainly not the only ones to explore, nor is it necessary to include every single one of them. These are, however, some of the ones I’ve enjoyed learning more about either in my college classes or later on as I have pursued more art historical knowledge on my own.\n\nI have tried to include a good range of different artists with various styles, nationalities, and perspectives; however, if you see an artist you feel should be listed here, feel free to leave a comment below!\n\nPicture Study Artists of the 1800s\n\nHokusai\n\nNationality: Japanese\n\nMovement: Edo period (Ukiyo-e)\n\nHokusai (1760-1849) was one of the leaders of the Ukiyo-e genre of art during Japan’s Edo period. Because Japan opened its ports to the western world in the 19th century, this form of art spread across the globe at this time. It became especially popular in France, where it highly influenced many of the Impressionist painters.\n\nCaspar David Friedrich\n\nNationality: German\n\nMovement: Romanticism\n\nCaspar David Friedrich (1774-1840) is the most well-known of the German Romantic painters. His pieces include contemplative scenes from nature, sometimes with figures pondering the view before them. (I also wrote about Friedrich in Volume 3, Issue 3 of Common Place Quarterly.)\n\nJ.M.W. Turner\n\nNationality: English\n\nMovement: Romanticism\n\nJ.M.W. Turner (1775-1851) is a giant in the art world, especially in England. His work influenced many changes in British art, particularly in landscape painting.\n\nJohn Constable\n\nNationality: English\n\nMovement: Romanticism\n\nJohn Constable (1776-1837) was another leader in the world of English landscape painting in the 19th century, and his paintings remain popular to this day.\n\nGeorge Catlin\n\nNationality: American\n\nMovement: Realism\n\nGeorge Catlin (1796-1872) explored the American west at a time when very few people of European descent ventured out that far. His paintings of Native Americans and western landscapes were essential in capturing a part of the history of North America.\n\nEugène Delacroix\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Romanticism\n\nEugène Delacroix (1798-1863) is credited with bringing the Romantic movement to France, and his oeuvre includes many many dramatic events throughout history.\n\nThomas Cole\n\nNationality: English (active in the United States)\n\nMovement: Hudson River School\n\nThomas Cole (1801-1848) is known as the father of the Hudson River School, a movement that elevated the art of landscape painting in America, and especially in New England.\n\nJean-François Millet\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Realism/Barbizon School\n\nJean-François Millet (1814-1875) is credited with advancing the more Realist style of the Barbizon school in France. His paintings highlighted the working life of peasants and farmers before he moved to more landscape paintings later in his career.\n\nRobert S. Duncanson\n\nNationality: American\n\nMovement: Hudson River School\n\nRobert S. Duncanson (1821-1872) was an African-American landscape painter associated with the Hudson River School, though he focused more on the Ohio River Valley.\n\nRosa Bonheur\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Realism\n\nRosa Bonheur (1822-1899) was both a painter and sculptor in France. She is most well-known for her paintings and sculptures of animals in the Realist style.\n\nEdward Mitchell Bannister\n\nNationality: Canadian (active in the United States)\n\nMovement: American Barbizon School\n\nEdward Mitchell Bannister (1828-1901) was a Black Canadian artist who was active primarily in the United States. His paintings reflect the ideas of the Barbizon school and include scenes from the lives of the working class as well as landscapes.\n\nAlbert Bierstadt\n\nNationality: American (born in Germany)\n\nMovement: Hudson River School\n\nAlbert Bierstadt‘s (1830-1902) awe-inspiring landscapes captured parts of North America in their natural and unadulterated state. His art is often associated with the wild American west of the 1800s.\n\nIvan Shishkin\n\nNationality: Russian\n\nMovement: Realism/Peredvizhniki\n\nIvan Shishkin (1832-1898) was part of the Russian Peredvizhniki (“The Wanderers”) movement of the late 19th century. Many artists in the movement painted people and scenes from everyday Russian life, but Shishkin was nicknamed the “Forest King” for his nature paintings.\n\nWinslow Homer\n\nNationality: American\n\nMovement: Realism (also associated with American Barbizon School)\n\nWinslow Homer (1836-1910) painted a wide range of subjects in the Realist style, including genre scenes, children, fishermen, and African Americans. His oeuvre also includes several representations of events during the American Civil War.\n\nPaul Cézanne\n\nNATIONALITY: French\n\nMOVEMENT: Post-Impressionism\n\nPaul Cézanne (1839-1906) is credited as the artist who led the transition from the Post-Impressionism of the late 19th century to the Cubism of the early 20th century. He painted various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and still-lifes, in his own distinct style.\n\nJosé María Velasco\n\nNationality: Mexican\n\nMovement: Realism\n\nJosé María Velasco (1840-1912) was an internationally-renowned Mexican artist who elevated the landscape painting of his country. He is often associated with Mexican nationalism and was highly influential to later Mexican artists.\n\nClaude Monet\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Impressionism\n\nClaude Monet (1840-1926) is credited with being the father of Impressionism and is probably one of the most well-known painters in art history. His broad oeuvre includes portraits, architectural studies, and genre scenes, but he is most famous for the paintings he made in his gardens and ponds in Giverny, France.\n\nEdmonia Lewis\n\nNationality: American\n\nMovement: NeoClassicism\n\nEdmonia Lewis (1844-1907) was an American woman of color who sculpted in the neoclassical style beautiful representations of poetry (including Longfellow’s Hiawatha), Biblical stories, and historical events. (I also wrote about Lewis in Volume 3, Issue 2 of Common Place Quarterly.)\n\nMary Cassatt\n\nNationality: American (active in France)\n\nMovement: Impressionism\n\nMary Cassatt (1844-1926) was an American expatriate who spent most of her life in France. Her work includes paintings, pastels, and prints, and she is most well-known for her scenes of mothers and children.\n\nIlya Repin\n\nNationality: Russian/Ukrainian\n\nMovement: Realism/Peredvizhniki\n\nIlya Repin (1844-1930) was born in the Ukrainian part of the Russian Empire in the 19th century. His Realist paintings include scenes from contemporary Russian life, historical events, and detailed and life-like portraits of well-known Russians.\n\nJohn William Waterhouse\n\nNationality: English\n\nMovement: Romanticism/Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood\n\nJohn William Waterhouse (1849-1917) was not active during the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, though his subjects and painting style would fall into the categorization. He brought to life scenes from ancient mythology and texts with beautiful detail. (His “Annunciation” is included in my Advent Art Devotions Volume IV.)\n\nVincent van Gogh\n\nNationality: Dutch\n\nMovement: Post-Impressionism\n\nVincent van Gogh (1853-1890) is another name from art history that is one of the most well-known in the world. His Post-Impressionist style is characterized by flowing lines, bright colors, and a wide variety of subjects, including landscapes, still lifes, genre scenes, and portraits. (His “The Good Samaritan (after Eugène Delacroix)” is included in my Lenten Art Devotions Volume IV.)\n\nJohn Singer Sargent\n\nNationality: American (active in England)\n\nMovement: Realism/Impressionism\n\nJohn Singer Sargent (1856-1925) was born in Italy to American parents and always considered himself American but spent little time in the United States. He is most well-known for his realistic portraits and was in high demand during his lifetime for this reason.\n\nGeorges Seurat\n\nNationality: French\n\nMovement: Post-Impressionism (Pointillism)\n\nGeorges Seurat (1859-1891) did not see art as so much of a creative endeavor, but more of a scientific one. He was fascinated by how the brain combined colors to make other colors that appeared more brilliant and used this theory in the creation of an entire sub-movement: Pointillism. His life was short, but his paintings are unique and worth studying.\n\nHenry Ossawa Tanner\n\nNationality: American (active in France)\n\nMovement: Realism\n\nHenry Ossawa Tanner (1859-1937) was an African-American artist who spent most of his later life in France. He also traveled throughout the Middle East, and his paintings reflect an authenticity that is not often seen in religious art. Many of his paintings are of stories and people from the Bible. (His “Jesus and Nicodemus” is included in my Lenten Art Devotions Volume I.)\n\nFrederic Remington\n\nNationality: American\n\nMovement: Tonalism\n\nFrederic Remington (1861-1909) is probably the artist most closely associated with the American west. His detailed paintings of cowboys and Native Americans capture a time in the history of North America that was turbulent and unpredictable, and his style reflects this."
