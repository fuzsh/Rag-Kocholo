        "text": "AMS PresidentsBrowse through the timeline of AMS presidents since 1888\n\nEarly AMS presidents had been awarded honorary PhDs, and several were born or trained outside the U.S. Some came from humble backgrounds, others from families of privilege. Some stayed at the same institution for decades; others traveled the world to do research, give talks, and represent the AMS. Most worked in academia, and a few worked in applied mathematics; some trained in well-known mathematics departments, others at small colleges. We are thankful for their service to the mathematical community."
