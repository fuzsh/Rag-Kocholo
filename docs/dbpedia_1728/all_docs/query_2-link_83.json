        "text": "Tim Simpson's Bio\n\nBorn May 6, 1956 in Atlanta, Georgia, Tim Simpson attended high school at Woodward Academy where he was the Atlanta Junior Champion, Georgia Junior Champion and Westlake National Junior Champion. While studying at the University of Georgia, he was named MVP of the Golf Team, selected for the College All-Star team, All-South Eastern Conference, and later won the Palmetto Invitational College Tournament as a freshman. As a sophomore, he was All-SEC, All-American, College All-Star and won the 1976 Southern Amateur. Turning Professional at age 20, Mr. Simpson was one of the youngest players to earn his tour card at 21 years and 2 months of age.\n\nTim Simpsonâs first professional win was in Nimes, France where he was the 1982 Cacheral World Champion. In 1985, he was bestowed with a PGA Tour Achievement Award and was the Southern Open Champion. He captured the New Orleans Championship, the Walt Disney Classic Championship and earned the PGA Tour Comeback Player of the Year in 1989, when he also became the 4th player in history to earn over one million dollars in worldwide earnings. In addition, he set the lowest 54-hole total in PGA Tour history, at 23 under par. Again in 1990, he won the Walt Disney Championship, became the first player in U.S. Open history to ever reach 9 under par and was a member of the U.S. Team in the Asahi Four Tour World Championship, all earning him the 1990 Georgia Professional Athlete of the Year.\n\nSuperstar Butch Harmon has labeled Mr. Simpson as the Greatest Ball Striker of the last 30 years and according to Jack Nicklaus and Johnny Miller, Tim Simpson is one of the greatest ball strikers in PGA Tour history. A three time Georgia Open Champion, Mr. Simpson has 66 Top Ten finishes in his PGA Tour career, thus far.\n\nTim Simpsonâs career was brought to a sudden end due to a bout with Lymeâs Disease and several neurological problems. After surviving many medical procedures, including brain surgery, he has persevered to make his return to the competitive field on the Championâs Tour in 2006.\n\nMr. Simpsonâs passion is to foster that same determination and drive in others by teaching golf skills, as well as life skills. His nonconforming, yet simple approach has brought guidance and wisdom to Amateurs and Professionals, alike. He is truly a champion of giving back to the game that has given him so much.\n\nTim Simpson is the proud father of Chris, Katie, Jessica and Calleigh and, with wife Leigh Anne, resides in Greensboro, Georgia."
