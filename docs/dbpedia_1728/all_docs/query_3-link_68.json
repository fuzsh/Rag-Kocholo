So…what about your own ancestors? Have you ever wondered what their lives were like?\n\nNow, there’s an easy way to learn about the lives of the people that came before you. With Ancestry, you can search your very own family history records—for FREE. You might find out who your ancestors were, where they lived, and what they were doing at any given age.\n\nSo, the next time you ask yourself, “how old am I?”, think about the life you’re currently living—and how different it might have been 100, 500, or even 1,000 years ago.\n\nIn the old days, people lived their lives a whole lot differently than they do today.
