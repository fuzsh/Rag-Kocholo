        "text": "Land of a Thousand Stories\n\nThe human stories in this vast land are as numerous as the variations of color found in the hills and valleys here. Whether it was the lure of mineral wealth or the resort industry that brought people here, every person who entered this valley experienced it in a different way. Exploring those differences is what makes a study of the ethnic history of Death Valley so exciting and challenging.\n\nNative Americans\n\nThe Timbisha Shoshone lived here for centuries before the first white man entered the valley. They hunted and followed seasonal migrations for harvesting of pinyon pine nuts and mesquite beans with their families. To them, the land provided everything they needed and many areas were, and are, considered to be sacred places.\n\nIn the spirit of co-managment with Tribal partners, we are currently in consultation with the Timbisha Shoshone and other Tribes to identify information and stories that are appropriate to share on this platform.\n\nBlack Forty-Niners\n\nThe party of emigrants coming into Death Valley in 1849 had an experience that would ultimately establish Death Valley’s morbid reputation. While much is known about some of the members of this group, the histories of others remain hidden. There were 3 black men in the group of '49ers who traversed Death Valley during that fateful trip. They were Negro Joe, Little West and Smith. Negro Joe was possibly the slave of Dr. Fred Carr. Little West was a slave, unknown owner, probably from Mississippi and Smith, the third man, was from Missouri. Smith traveled with a group of German immigrants for a time and then followed the Jayhawkers. His ultimate fate was unknown but it was rumored that he was killed by Indians after leaving Panamint Valley. How did Smith happen to be traveling with the ‘49ers? What were the experiences of Negro Joe and Little West here? Their stories remain an intriguing mystery.\n\nChinese Workers\n\nAs silver and borax discoveries brought people into Death Valley in the late 1800’s, another ethnic group came into the Valley. Chinese workers built Panamint City in the 1870’s, but they didn’t stay in the area. Another group of Chinese immigrants toiled in the successful mining operation at Harmony Borax Works. They made a road 160 miles long through the salt pinnacles and raked the borax off the valley floor from 1883 until 1888 when the last 20 mule teams rolled out of the valley. Then, they too disappeared, leaving only bits of broken bottles, pottery shards and remnants of porcelain in their place. What were their feelings about this place? Did they ever come back? Questions with no known answers.\n\nBasque History"
