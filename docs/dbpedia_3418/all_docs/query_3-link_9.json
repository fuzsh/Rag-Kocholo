        "text": "I approached this film with a bit of trepidation because, having watched a lot of older Hollywood films, it seemed that older man/younger woman relationships were such a non-issue to filmmakers. It was just accepted without question in so many old movies, but Middle of the Night— to my surprise— dealt with this issue very openly. The relationship of Fredric March, 56, and Kim Novak, 24, is built on obsession, adoration, and neediness, not love. I really appreciated how the film delved deeply into March’s own insecurities about old age and his fear of dying. It’s a very honest portrayal of middle age, without any of the glamour Hollywood likes to endow to their leading men. What I really loved,…\n\nPaddy Chayefsky was a genius not only at capturing the rhythm and nuance of natural dialogue but of rendering the ebb and flow of human relationships. His script here about the relationship between a 50-something garment manufacturer and his 20-something employee is quite superb. We are in the hands of a master as the love affair buds, blossoms and encounters thorns. No line of dialogue or plot development is unrooted in lived experience. Chayefsky's body of work is a long and happy marriage between the everyday and the theatrical.\n\nDelbert Mann was extremely effective in directing such character-driven pieces, as can be seen from Marty, Dear Heart, Separate Tables and The Dark at the Top of the Stairs. His choice…\n\n〝 I can't tell you how often recently I've found myself thinking about dying. \"Dying\" to you is something that happens to old relatives, but it's a very intimate business to me. I don't expect you to understand this, but in those moments when I'm suddenly impossible to live with, that's probably what's at the bottom of my bad temper.〞\n\nWow this punched me in the face, I actually don’t even know where to start with this one ?? I’m so baffled that more people haven’t picked up on this, it’s a genuine masterpiece. There are SO many older man/younger woman relationships in old-Hollywood films but the age gaps always gets brushed over; I think this might be the only…\n\nFrederic March is in the \"Middle of the Night\" in this 1959 film written by Paddy Chayefsky originally for the stage and directed by Delbert Mann. March stars with Kim Novak, Albert Dekker, Lee Grant, Joan Copeland, Martin Balsam, Glenda Farrell, and Lee Phillips - a great cast made up of some old-timers and some wonderful New York actors.\n\nMarch plays Jerry Kingsley, a 56-year-old widower who owns a successful business and at the moment lives with his overly-protective sister. We're reminded seeing this film that 56 in 1959 isn't what it is today. (In fact, March was 61).\n\nThe different men with whom Jerry does business stand around talking about their aches and pains and what it's like to…\n\nFinally! A movie about a 56 year old boss falling for his 24 year old secretary. Middle of the Night, where ya been all my life???\n\nSolid middle age meltdown update of Marty with Jews taking over for Italians. A truly fantastic Fredric March (in a vanity free performance) is a widow who falls for a 24 year old wasp-wasted divorcee played by Kim Novak.\n\nFredric March and the wonderful Martin Balsam are total mensches. March’s sister and daughter are controlling harpies with some Freudian residue right on the surface.\n\nNovak seems like a decent person but she also seems to be suffering from a nervous disorder.\n\nThis is pretty darn progressive in its treatment of usually taboo Hollywood subjects.…"
