        "text": "Book Summary\n\nBrilliant, haunting, breathtakingly suspenseful, Night Film is a superb literary thriller by the New York Times bestselling author of the blockbuster debut Special Topics in Calamity Physics.\n\nOn a damp October night, the body of young, beautiful Ashley Cordova is found in an abandoned warehouse in lower Manhattan. By all appearances her death is a suicide - but investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. Though much has been written about the dark and unsettling films of Ashley's father, Stanislas Cordova, very little is known about the man himself. As McGrath pieces together the mystery of Ashley's death, he is drawn deeper and deeper into the dark underbelly of New York City and the twisted world of Stanislas Cordova, and he begins to wonder - is he the next victim?\n\nIn this novel, the dazzlingly inventive writer Marisha Pessl offers a breathtaking mystery that will hold you in suspense until the last page is turned.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nNew York City 2:32 A.M.\n\nEveryone has a Cordova story, whether they like it or not.\n\nMaybe your next-door neighbor found one of his movies in an old box in her attic and never entered a dark room alone again.

He's a crevice, a black hole, an unspecified danger, a relentless outbreak of the unknown in our overexposed world. He's underground, looming unseen in the corners of the dark. He's down under the railway bridge in the river with all the missing evidence, and the answers that will never see the light of day.\n\nHe's a myth, a monster, a mortal man.\n\nAnd yet I can't help but believe when you need him the most, ...\n\nBookBrowse Review\n\nBookBrowse\n\nPessl’s beautiful, haunting imagery and vivid writing completely pull you in and you emerge breathless. She makes you lose sight of the trees for the forest - the eerily creepy forest. Already famous for her literary pyrotechnics with her debut, Special Topics in Calamity Physics, Pessl showcases her immense talent again...continued\n\nFull Review (740 words)\n\nThis review is available to non-members for a limited time.
