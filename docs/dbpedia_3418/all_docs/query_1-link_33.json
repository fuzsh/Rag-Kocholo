        "text": "M. Night Shyamalan‘s psychological thriller “Trap” follows parental serial killer Cooper, aka “The Butcher” (Josh Hartnett), who takes his daughter (Ariel Donoghue) to see her favorite popstar live in concert. But shortly after arriving, Cooper discovers the event is an elaborate sting operation designed to finally put “The Butcher” behind bars.\n\nIn an interview with Empire Magazine, Shyamalan described the film as if “‘Silence of the Lambs’ happened at a Taylor Swift concert.” With that logline, it seems the events of “Trap” could only take place on the big screen. However, the film is actually based on reality, inspired by one of the United States’ most successful sting operations: Operation Flagship.\n\nIn December 1985, the U.S. Marshals Service sent more than 3,000 invitations to fugitives across Washington D.C with 5,117 outstanding warrants between them. Sent under the phony banner of Flagship International Sports TV, the invitees were told their names had been selected from a clearinghouse list and that they had won free tickets to see the Washington Redskins play the Cincinnati Bengals later that month.\n\nBus transportation would be provided to a pregame party where the “winners” could collect their prize and enter drawings for Redskins season tickets and an all-expenses paid trip to Super Bowl XX.\n\nOn Dec. 15, 101 of the 3,000 invited were bussed off to the Washington Convention Center, bundled up in Redskins apparel and praying for a win during a shakey 8-6 season. More than 150 undercover officers were waiting at the venue, disguised as cheerleaders, caterers, Flagship representatives and janitorial staff. One officer even dawned a San Diego Chicken suit.\n\nArresting 101 fugitives at once was decidedly too dangerous, so upon arrival, the criminals were checked in and moved to a separate room in groups of roughly 15 people. There, they were told they would get their tickets and hear a few words from the party’s master of ceremonies, played by the chief of enforcement operations, Louie McKinney.\n\nOnce they were seated, McKinney dove into his presentation, outlining the events of the day and sharing details about Flagship’s new lineup of sports programming.\n\n“We had a prearranged signal with the Special Operations Group, which was supposed to enter the room when it heard me say ‘surprise.’ To my surprise, nothing had happened after I’d given the signal,” McKinney wrote in his 2009 memoir “One Marshal’s Badge.” “Thinking that I should repeat the cue louder, I decided to try again. ’Today really is your lucky day,’ I shouted above the conversations. ‘And I’ve got a big surprise for you!’”\n\n25 members of the SOG then flooded the room, weapons drawn. This process was repeated until all 101 fugitives were in custody, resulting in an eventual total of 144 arrests.\n\n“Trap” is now screening in theaters nationwide."
