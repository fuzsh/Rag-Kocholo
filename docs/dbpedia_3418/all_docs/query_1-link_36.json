        "text": "Vanessa Kirby, whose roles include playing the young Princess Margaret in the Netflix series, “The Crown,” is heading to Portland to star in a new movie. According to Deadline, Kirby will head the cast of “The Night Always Comes,” which is adapted from a novel by Oregon author and musician Willy Vlautin.\n\nThe director of “The Night Always Comes” will be Benjamin Caron, according to Deadline. Caron’s resume includes directing episodes of “The Crown,” the Disney Plus series “Andor,” “Sherlock,” and more.\n\nIn addition to playing Princess Margaret in the first two seasons of “The Crown,” Kirby has also appeared in “Napoleon,” “Mission Impossible - Fallout,” “Fast and Furious: Hobbs & Shaw,” and “Pieces of a Woman,” which earned her an Oscar nomination. Kirby is also set to play Sue Storm, the Marvel superhero also known as the Invisible Woman, in an upcoming new version of “The Fantastic Four.”\n\nThe screenplay for “The NIght Always Comes” is by Sarah Conradt. The novel, Vlautin’s sixth, takes place over the span of two days, and focuses on a character named Lynette, a working-class woman who is desperate to raise money.\n\nAs The Oregonian/OregonLive wrote in 2021 about the book, Lynette has “been grinding to save enough money to buy the house they’ve rented for years — a move that would provide the family with some long-needed security. Buying the family’s current house is the only way they can stay in their North Portland neighborhood, which is transforming at neck-breaking pace. But as her plan falls apart, the one thing Lynette’s worked so hard to secure — home — is threatened. Vlautin explores the idea of the American dream and the impacts of gentrification, greed, and opportunism on ordinary, working class lives. The novel is at once a page-turning thriller and an insightful morality tale that examines the devastating consequences of gentrification on the working class, especially in Portland.”\n\nAs Vlautin told The Oregonian/OregonLive, “Lynette still believes in family and community, in her home, but all the people she meets are really greedy. They’re all looking out for themselves, and in doing so are beating up this really cool woman. Lynette’s fighting for her family, but she’s also fighting for the American dream.”\n\n“The Night Always Comes” is just the latest of Vlautin’s works to be adapted to film. His first novel, “The Motel Life,” was made into a 2012 movie, with a cast including Emile Hirsch and Stephen Dorff. Vlautin’s third novel, “Lean On Pete,” was turned into a critically acclaimed 2017 movie that filmed in Oregon locations, and was directed by Andrew Haigh (”All Of Us Strangers”).\n\nAccording to Deadline, “The Night Always Comes” is scheduled to film in Portland in May.\n\n— Kristi Turnquist covers features and entertainment.
