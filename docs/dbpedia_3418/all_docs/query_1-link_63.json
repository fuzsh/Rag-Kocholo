        "text": "World War Z\n\nBy Max Brooks,\n\nFrom my list on fictional non-fiction.\n\nBy Chris Kempshall Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m a historian, and while I have a great deal of experience producing straight ‘nonfiction’ work, the idea of reading something ‘non-fictional;’ within a fictional world has always excited me because it allows many opportunities to talk about us while framing it as them. They also play into what I call the ‘Rutger Hauer Effect,’ where his character in Blade Runner mentions the wonderous things he’s seen in passing. I want to see those things too! Fictional nonfiction books provide a fantastic opportunity to tease the readers with things that their author knows and has seen but exist just beyond the reach of our own imaginations.\n\nChris' book list on fictional non-fiction\n\nWhy did Chris love this book?\n\nThis is an absolute classic of the genre. Brooks draws in various ‘accounts’ of a recent zombie outbreak and structures them as if the broad details are common knowledge to his in-universe audience.\n\nThis approach means the real-world reader is always discovering new details and nuggets of information in a way that really whets the appetite while increasing the sense of horror at the way events unfolded in a world that isn’t quite our own.\n\nBy Max Brooks,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n24 authors picked World War Z as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt began with rumours from China about another pandemic. Then the cases started to multiply and what had looked like the stirrings of a criminal underclass, even the beginning of a revolution, soon revealed itself to be much, much worse.\n\nFaced with a future of mindless man-eating horror, humanity was forced to accept the logic of world government and face events that tested our sanity and our sense of reality. Based on extensive interviews with survivors and key players in the ten-year fight against the horde, World War Z brings the finest traditions of journalism to bear on what is…\n\nPreview\n\nDracula\n\nBy Bram Stoker,\n\nFrom my list on supernatural with a sprinkling of realism.\n\nBy L.W. King Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nFrom an early age, I have been fascinated with anything supernatural and occult. My Aunt would read my palm, and then, as a teenager, I would visit clairvoyants to see what the future held for me. As I grew older, I found I had an ability, a gift of seership, and after reading many books, embarked on my pagan journey, from which I have never looked back, and am now studying Druidry,which is very much nature-based. I hope you love the books on this list as much as I do!\n\nL.W.'s book list on supernatural with a sprinkling of realism\n\nWhy did L.W. love this book?\n\nI read this book at the tender age of ten and instantly became ever so slightly obsessed with vampires; I love how the atmosphere builds slowly, sucking me to the point that I am genuinely afraid that the wolves might attack.\n\nThe description of the locations and the journal and letter writing are wonderful story breakers, and what a uniquely wonderful story it is. For me, it is a timeless masterpiece.\n\nBy Bram Stoker,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n23 authors picked Dracula as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 17.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'The very best story of diablerie which I have read for many years' Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nA masterpiece of the horror genre, Dracula also probes identity, sanity and the dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire. It begins when Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula purchase a London house, and makes horrifying discoveries in his client's castle. Soon afterwards, disturbing incidents unfold in England - an unmanned ship is wrecked; strange puncture marks appear on a young woman's neck; a lunatic asylum inmate raves about the imminent arrival of his 'Master' - and a determined group of adversaries…\n\nPreview\n\nWhite Fox\n\nBy Sara Faring,\n\nFrom my list on horror with mixed media format.\n\nBy Katya de Becerra Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an author of horror and thrillers, I have always been drawn to big mysteries, the darker the better. I blame this fascination on my love of David Lynch movies, which had originated in my early teens and persists to this day. I have also found that incorporating ‘found objects’ into mixed media narratives can help better simulate reality while also twisting it in unpredictable ways. It is no surprise that my debut What the Woods Keep is a mixed media genre-bender. While this storytelling method is not new, recent horror novels have used it in incredibly inventive and impactful ways.\n\nKatya's book list on horror with mixed media format\n\nWhy did Katya love this book?\n\nWhite Fox is another excellent example of a fictional mixed media narrative formed around a cult object of art – in this case, a film script. The author’s technique of alternating the dual narration of two sisters with excerpts from the eponymous script, White Fox, written by (and about) their missing mother, does an excellent job of mixing the real with the surreal. While the mystery at the heart of this sophomore novel is a very human one, the addition of the mysterious film script and the mythology around it bolsters a terrific atmosphere and makes for a compelling reading experience.\n\nBy Sara Faring,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked White Fox as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 15, 16, and 17.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“Eerie and sly, White Fox is a trap waiting to be sprung. I was completely enthralled.”―Rory Power, New York Times-bestselling author of Wilder Girls\n\n“A ghost story that will spook even the most hardened grown-ups.” ―Entertainment Weekly\n\nAfter their world-famous actor mother disappeared under mysterious circumstances, Manon and Thaïs left their remote Mediterranean island home―sent away by their pharma-tech tycoon father. Opposites in every way, the sisters drifted apart in their grief. Yet their mother's unfinished story still haunts them both, and they can't put to rest the possibility that she is still alive.\n\nLured home a decade later, Manon…\n\nPreview\n\nTo Break a Covenant\n\nBy Alison Ames,\n\nFrom my list on horror with mixed media format.\n\nBy Katya de Becerra Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nAs an author of horror and thrillers, I have always been drawn to big mysteries, the darker the better.

While this storytelling method is not new, recent horror novels have used it in incredibly inventive and impactful ways.\n\nKatya's book list on horror with mixed media format\n\nWhy did Katya love this book?\n\nA recent addition to the horror genre, this excellent debut novel excels in creating a surreal narrative drenched in dark atmosphere. To Break a Covenant centers around a terrifying, fractured faux-documentary about a town under control of a sinister presence. I dare you to read creepy descriptions of ‘found’ footage and not feel a chill as this mystery unfolds.\n\nBy Alison Ames,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked To Break a Covenant as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDebut voice Alison Ames delivers with a chilling, feminist thriller, perfect for fans of Wilder Girls and Sawkill Girls.\n\nMoon Basin has been haunted for as long as anyone can remember.

In particular, I was a fan of things that layered stories and linked their themes together, even if you didn’t necessarily notice initially. For example, the Alien franchise is a story of human survival, but also of corporate conspiracy. When I come across books that mix stories or add interesting structural elements, it instantly draws me in, so I set out to create exactly that with my release Ailuros. But I’m not alone in experimenting like that, so I hope you find some fun, scary releases you may not have known about in my list.\n\nMatt's book list on creepy stories told in unique ways\n\nWhy did Matt love this book?\n\nDescribed as a faux documentary in the style of The Blair Witch Project, this one is an interesting take on the horror genre. Interviews, descriptions of crime-related exhibits, and written testimonies all come together to make the book feel both investigative and more than a little fractured. It’s an uncomfortable combination that helps create a nice sense of fear for readers.\n\nBy Kate Alice Marshall,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked Rules for Vanishing as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it. This book is for kids age 12, 13, 14, and 15.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIn the faux-documentary style of The Blair Witch Project comes the campfire story of a missing girl, a vengeful ghost, and the girl who is determined to find her sister--at all costs.\n\nOnce a year, a road appears in the forest. And at the end of it, the ghost of Lucy Gallows beckons. Lucy's game isn't for the faint of heart. If you win, you escape with your life. But if you lose....\n\nSara's sister disappeared one year ago--and only Sara knows where she is. Becca went to find the ghost of Lucy Gallows and is trapped on the road…\n\nPreview\n\nHouse of Leaves\n\nBy Mark Z. Danielewski,\n\nFrom my list on dystopian and sci-fantasy novels.\n\nBy Stephen M. Sanders Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been a sci-fi/fantasy fan ever since my dad introduced me to the original Star Trek (in reruns) and The Lord of the Rings in my youth. I’ve always loved thinking about possibilities—large and small—so my work tends to think big when I write. I also write poetry, which allows me to talk about more than just the everyday or at least to find the excitement within the mundane in life. These works talk about those same “possibilities”—for better or worse, and in reading, I walk in awareness of what could be.\n\nStephen's book list on dystopian and sci-fantasy novels\n\nWhy did Stephen love this book?\n\nI love this book's weirdness! Danielewski’s paranormal (and unconventional) story permitted me to write what I wanted and forget other people’s expectations about what a novel “should” be. It freed my work to be as strange as it needed to be.\n\nBy Mark Z. Danielewski,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n22 authors picked House of Leaves as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n“A novelistic mosaic that simultaneously reads like a thriller and like a strange, dreamlike excursion into the subconscious.” —The New York Times\n\nYears ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with an odd assortment of marginalized youth -- musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers, environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies -- the book eventually made its way into the hands of older generations,…\n\nPreview\n\nJamaica Inn\n\nBy Daphne du Maurier,\n\nFrom my list on sleuths who have enough problems without a mystery to solve.\n\nBy Kat Hausler Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love to see complicated characters rising to the occasion. People in real life generally have a lot going on just handling the day-to-day, and they aren’t waiting around for adventure, romance, or mystery to find them. It feels very human to me to see characters struggling with more mundane things like social situations, worrying about their appearance, or holding down a job, rather than only focusing on the plot arc, and that’s the type of character I also focus on as a writer. My latest protagonist, Simon, definitely has enough problems without a missing-person case to solve, so he may be what got me thinking of this topic.\n\nKat's book list on sleuths who have enough problems without a mystery to solve\n\nWhy did Kat love this book?\n\nI have always loved literary thriller queen Daphne Du Maurier's complex and resilient characters, and Mary Yellan is no exception. Everything’s looking pretty miserable for her after her mother’s death forces her to give up the family farm and her hometown to live in a creepy inn with her miserable aunt and aggressive drunk of an uncle.\n\nSo I really enjoy how brave and resourceful she is in getting past violence, danger, miserable living conditions, a desolate setting, and bad taste in men to find out whether something more sinister than smuggling is going on at the empty inn.\n\nBy Daphne du Maurier,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked Jamaica Inn as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAfter the death of her mother, Mary Yellan crosses the windswept Cornish moors to Jamaica Inn, the home of her Aunt Patience. There she finds Patience a changed woman, downtrodden by her domineering, vicious husband Joss Merlyn. The inn is a front for a lawless gang of criminals, and Mary is unwillingly dragged into their dangerous world of smuggling and murder. Before long she will be forced to cross her own moral line to save herself.\n\nPreview\n\nThe Raw Shark Texts\n\nBy Steven Hall,\n\nWhy did Matt love this book?\n\nWhile more literary than horror, the concept of a man with no memories being pursued by a shark made of words has plenty of creepiness to it! Here, the author uses different typographical sizes and structures to create pictures, and these tie into the themes of the book. It’s a straightforward read with a unique edge that helps make language more visual, and that makes it thoroughly compelling.\n\nBy Steven Hall,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Raw Shark Texts as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nFirst things first, stay calm.\n\nEric Sanderson wakes up in a place he doesn't recognise, unable to remember who he is. All he has left are journal entries recalling Clio, a perfect love now gone. As he begins to piece his memories back together, Eric finds that he is being hunted by a creature that moves in language, that swims through the currents of human interaction.\n\nWith the help of his cynical cat Ian, Eric must search for the Ludovician, the force that is threatening his life, and Dr Trey Fidorus, the only man who knows the truth.\n\nPreview\n\nDark Places\n\nBy Gillian Flynn,\n\nWhy did Tyler love this book?\n\nThis is the only book that has ever made me physically sweat while reading it. I admit to being a true crime junkie, and this book scratched that itch in a huge way – despite being fiction.\n\nJumping back and forth between the day of a family’s horrific murder and present-day, where the surviving daughter is obsessively sought after by true crime enthusiasts (heyo!) and internet sleuths, this book turned a glaring spotlight on the hardships of both the economically poor, and single parenthood.\n\nTo say this book left me devastated would be an understatement. Add in a touch of the Satanic Panic of the 1980s, and this page-turner is nothing short of an absolute masterpiece of character work and cultural empathy. Not only did this book give me 759 heart attacks (the good kind), but it had me guessing up until the very last page.\n\nBy Gillian Flynn,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n7 authors picked Dark Places as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nTHE BESTSELLING PHENOMENON\n\n'Eerily macabre...

I actually read this book while laying on a hammock in my backyard. The characters are likable, the mystery is intriguing, and the love story weave in the middle is endearing. You won’t have heart palpitations reading this book, but I can assure you that weird dreams will be part of the experience.\n\nBy Peter Clines,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked 14 as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nPadlocked doors. Strange light fixtures. Mutant cockroaches. There are some odd things about Nate's new apartment.\n\nPreview"
