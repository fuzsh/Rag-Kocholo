        "meta_description": "The first significant publication of its kind, Night Fever is a lavishly illustrated compendium of artist portfolios and essays that consider the unique conditions of the nighttime world and its transgressive and transformational possibilities. The book comprises 20 photography portfolios by a diverse, international and intergenerational group of artists as well as 21 essays about films made during and about the night. Together, the films, photo portfolios and essays gathered in the volume testify to the fact that there is no single night; for each person, place or group, night's threshold, its liminal edge, is ever-changing. Artists include: David Goldbatt, Dayanita Singh, Dhruv Malhotra, Evgenia Arbugaeva, Katsumi Watanabe, Kohei Yoshiyuki, Lieko Shiga, Malick Sidibé, Martina Mullaney, Ming Smith, Mosa'ab Elshamy, Myriam Boulos, Paz Errazuriz, Rinko Kawauchi, Sanlé Sory, Sohrab Hura, Stephen Barker, Suwon Lee, Tobias Zielony, Trevor Paglen.",

        "text": "FROM THE ARTBOOK BLOG\n\nCORY REYNOLDS | DATE 6/20/2024\n\nTransgression and transformation in Shanay Jhavari's 'Night Fever'\n\nFeatured image, by Chilean photographer Paz Errázurizs La Manzana de Adán (Adams Apple) series, is from Night Fever: Film and Photography After Dark. Edited by noted Barbican curator Shanay Jhavari, this 424 paperback collects 20 photo portfolios and 21 essays about films made during and about the night. In the 1980s, Errázuriz photographed sex workers, Ela Bittencourt writes, but the women, whose trade was illegal, didnt want their images shown. She then turned to the siblings Pilar and Evelyn, and so began a four-year collaboration with trans-identifying sex workers in Santiago and the provinces. Working alone at first, she was later joined by journalist Claudia Donoso, who recorded the workers testimonies. The resulting book, Adams Apple, was censored. Today it serves as a poignant record of a trans community subjected to violence and repression, the vast majority of whom perished from AIDS. Its title references the part of the male anatomy that Errázurizs trans subjects often wished to hide. With its biblical ring, it evokes the mysteries of sex, calamity and exhilarationEdenic scenes portraying perfect bodies of uncanny beauty, tragically marked by fate. continue to blog"
