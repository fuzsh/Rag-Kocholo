        "text": "Night Film is a breathtakingly suspenseful literary thriller that makes you question how you decide what is real and what isn't from the critically acclaimed author of Special Topics in Calamity Physics\n\nOn a damp October night the body of beautiful Ashley Cordova is discovered in a Manhattan warehouse.\n\nThough her death is ruled a suicide, investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise.\n\nThe last time McGrath got too close to the Cordova dynasty, he lost his marriage and his career.\n\nThis time he could lose his mind."
