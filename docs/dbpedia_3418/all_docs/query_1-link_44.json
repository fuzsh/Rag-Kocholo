        "text": "Join us this July when the Museum’s front yard is transformed into the city’s biggest cinema during the Art Hill Film Series, a St. Louis tradition of films, food, and music. This year’s featured films are Back to the Future on July 12 and Meet Me in St. Louis on July 19. Music, food trucks, a cash bar, and more preshow festivities start at 6 pm. The featured film will be shown at 9 pm. No tickets are required for the event.\n\nIn the event of severe weather, the Museum will announce any delay or cancellation on Facebook, Instagram, and slam.org. If a film is canceled due to weather, it will not be rescheduled.\n\nMarty McFly goes back in time to the 1950s in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric friend Emmett “Doc” Brown. After accidentally preventing his future parents from falling in love, Marty make sure they still fall in love and find a way to get back to 1985 to save Brown’s life.\n\nThe 1985 film was a success both with critics and the box office, and it was followed by two sequels. Back to the Future was directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. It is rated PG.\n\nSet at the turn of the century, Meet Me in St. Louis follows the Smith family in months leading up to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The 1944 musical debuted standards like The Trolley Song, The Boy Next Door, and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\n\nThe film was nominated for four Academy Awards—Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay; Best Cinematography, Color; Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture; and Best Music, Song—and in 1994, the film was deemed “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant” by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The American Film Institute ranked the film 10th on its AFI’s Greatest Movie Musicals list. Written by Irving Brecher and Fred F. Finklehoffe and based on the novel of the same name by Sally Benson, the film was directed by Vincente Minnelli. It stars Judy Garland, Margaret O’Brien, Mary Astor, Lucille Bremer, Tom Drake, and Marjorie Main."
