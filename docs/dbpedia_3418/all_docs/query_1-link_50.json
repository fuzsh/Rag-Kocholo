        "text": "Topline\n\nThe horror-only streaming service Shudder broke its record last weekend with the release of \"Late Night With The Devil,\" a relatively low-budget horror flick that became the largest acquisition ever for both the AMC Networks-owned niche streamer and AMC+ in its opening weekend.\n\nKey Facts\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"I got a screener. It's absolutely brilliant. I couldn't take my eyes off it,\" horror author Stephen King tweeted of the film. \"Your results may vary, as they say, but I urge you to watch it when you can.\"\n\nKey Background\n\n\"Late Night with the Devil\" tells the story of a fictional syndicated talk show called \"Night Owls.\" Desperate to turn ratings around, host Jack Delroy brings to set a self-proclaimed medium, a former magician and a girl who is said to be possessed for a special Halloween broadcast. On air, the girl conjures the demon that lives inside her and \"unleashes evil into the living rooms of America,\" the film's description reads. The film is set as if the footage from the original 1977 broadcast had recently been rediscovered.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nSearch interest in the title has risen steadily over the last month, according to Google Trends, including searches around whether or not the film is based on a true story. While the movie draws inspiration from real aspects of 1970s pop culture—like the original \"Exorcist\" film and \"The Don Lane Show,\" which aired for nine seasons—it is entirely fiction.\n\nTangent\n\nCameron and Colin Cairnes, the brothers who wrote and directed the film, received some backlash after the movie was released for using art generated via artificial intelligence. The brothers issued a statement clarifying they did use AI to create three still images that were later edited and included in the film with the help of the on-set graphics and production design team. The use of AI to replace human artists, actors, musicians and more in film has been a hot-button topic for years and was a major sticking point in a months-long actors strike last year.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe Hollywood ReporterDavid Dastmalchian on How 'Late Night with the Devil' Reconnected Him with Heath Ledger's Joker VarietyAMC Networks' U.S. Ad Sales Fall 23% in Final Quarter of 2023 as Streaming Subs Inch UpForbesNetflix Breakout Hit 'Baby Reindeer' Has One Big Problem: Fans Are Obsessing Over The Real-Life Story"
