        "text": "I’ve been a fan of Matthew Quirk‘s thrillers ever since I blitzed through an ARC of his debut, The 500. I read it in a single sitting, staying up well into the wee hours of the morning — at the time, we were living in a bedsit, so I read it all sitting on the floor in our bathroom, so my partner could sleep undisturbed. Anyway, on March 23rd, Netflix are due to release the ten-episode television adaptation of The Night Agent! Somehow, I managed to either miss or forget that it was being adapted, but I am very much looking forward to seeing what they’ve come up with.\n\nOriginally published in 2019, here’s the synopsis:\n\nTo save America from a catastrophic betrayal, an FBI agent must stop a Russian mole in the White House…\n\nNo one is more surprised than FBI Agent Peter Sutherland when he’s tapped to work in the White House Situation Room. When Peter was a boy, his father was suspected of selling secrets to the Russians — a breach that cost him his career, his reputation, and eventually his life. Now Peter’s job is monitoring an emergency line for a call that has not — and might never — come.\n\nUntil tonight.\n\nAt 1:05 a.m. the phone rings. A terrified young woman named Rose tells Peter that two people have just been murdered and that the killer might still be in the house with her. One of the victims gave her this phone number with urgent instructions: “Tell them OSPREY was right. It’s happening…” The call thrusts Peter into the heart of a conspiracy years in the making, involving a Russian mole at the highest levels of the U.S. government. Anyone in the White House could be the traitor. Anyone could be corrupted. To save the nation, Peter must take the rules into his own hands, question everything, and trust no one.\n\nThe Night Agent is published in North America by William Morrow, and in the UK by Aries/Head of Zeus.\n\nQuirk’s next novel is Inside Threat, due to be published by William Morrow in North America, on June 13th. (I couldn’t find any UK publication details at the time of writing, but I imagine it’ll probably be Aries again.) Here’s the synopsis:\n\nAn attack on the White House sends the President and his top aides to take shelter in a top secret government facility buried deep underground — but they soon discover the threat is locked inside with them.\n\nAssume the worst. Code Black.\n\nThe day that every secret service agent trains for has arrived. The White House has been breached; the President forced to flee to a massive doomsday bunker outside DC to defend against whatever comes next. Only the most trusted agents and officials are allowed in with him — those dedicated to keeping the government intact at all costs.\n\nAmong these is Erik Hill, who has given his life to the Secret Service. They are his purpose and his family, and his impressive record has made him a hero among them. Despite his growing disillusionment from seeing Washington corruption up close, Erik can’t ignore years of instincts honed on the job. The government is under attack, and no one is better equipped to face down the threat than he is.\n\nThe evidence leads him to a conspiracy at the highest levels of power, with the attack orchestrated by some of the very individuals now locked in with him. As the killers strike inside the bunker, it will take everything Erik Hill has to save his people, himself, and his country.\n\nAlso on CR: Reviews of The 500, The Directive, The Night Agent, and Red Warning"
