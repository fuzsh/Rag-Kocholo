Eliza's Acting Career: Eliza Dushku was born in Boston on December 30,1980. The actress, currently eighteen, started out doing numerous productions at the Watertown Children's Theatre, a place where she sometimes still preforms by signing plays to the deaf. At the age of ten Eliza made here film debut in the movie That Night. The 1992 film gave Dushku a large role that put her in the spotlight. The following year Dushku landed a role as Pearl alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in 1993. Leonardo taught Eliza a valueable lesson. She was constantly getting badgered by students and teachers about her film making. Dicaprio changed things quite a bit for her. He taught her how to deal with bullies and other high school dangers. Dushku says she is, "..forever grateful to him."

Dushku continued to get roles, many minor, over the next few years. The last film she appeared in was Race the Sun, a 1996 film in which she plays a teen with a drinking problem. From here Eliza took her junior and senior years off of acting to bring up her grades up. And she did. Dushku has been excepted to both Boston and George Washington Universities thought she is holding off to work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Eliza lived in Watertown,Massachusetts where she graduated high school until recently. In August of 1998,Eliza finalized her deal to star on Buffy and headed out to L.A. Due to the fact that minors can only work certain hours, Eliza has been legally emancipated from her parents who are both college professors that are writing a book in Romania.

Eliza recently moved to the Los Angeles area with Nate,the oldest of her three brothers. Nate is Eliza's best friend and,as she puts it,"partner in crime." Dushku also purchased a PC in the past few months.
