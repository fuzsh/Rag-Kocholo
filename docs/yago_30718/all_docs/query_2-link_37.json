        "text": "Prince Jaime Bernardo of Bourbon-Parma, Count of Bardi (born 13 October 1972) is the second son and third child of Princess Irene of the Netherlands and Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma. He is a member of the Royal and Ducal House of Bourbon-Parma, and also an extended member of the Dutch Royal Family and a Dutch nobleman with the title Prince de Bourbon de Parme. The title \"Count of Bardi\" is not recognized within the Dutch nobility. From 2014 to 2018 he was the Dutch ambassador to the Holy See.\n\nPrince Wolfgang of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (Wolfgang Moritz; 6 November 1896 – 12 July 1989) was the designated Hereditary Prince of the monarchy of Finland (with the irredentist pretension to Estonia), and as such, already called the Crown Prince of Finland officially until 14 December 1918, and also afterwards by some monarchists. Wolfgang was born at Castle Rumpenheim, Offenbach am Main. He was the second-born of a pair of twins, the fourth child and son born to Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse (1868–1940) and Princess Margaret of Prussia (1872–1954). His maternal uncle was the German Emperor William II. Wolfgang's father Frederick Charles of Hesse was elected King of Finland on 9 October 1918, to replace his first cousin once removed, the deposed Russian emperor, Nicholas II, who was titled Grand Duke of Finland. However, Frederick Charles renounced the throne on 14 December 1918, and the title was never actually held by the family. Wolfgang would have been his father's heir as King of Finland instead of his elder twin Prince Philipp of Hesse (1896–1980), apparently because Wolfgang was with his parents in 1918 and ready to travel to Finland (where a wedding to a Finnish lady was reportedly being prepared for the coming Crown Prince). Philipp was on active service and incommunicado at the time. Wolfgang married on 17 September 1924 Princess Marie Alexandra of Baden (1902–1944), daughter of Prince Maximilian of Baden and Princess Marie Louise of Hanover; they had no children. Wolfgang adopted his nephew, Prince Karl Adolf of Hesse (born 1937), elder son of his younger brother Christoph who was killed in action in 1943. At the time of his death in Frankfurt at the age of 92, Wolfgang was the only surviving great-grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom who had been born in her lifetime. Victoria died in 1901 when Wolfgang was four years old."
