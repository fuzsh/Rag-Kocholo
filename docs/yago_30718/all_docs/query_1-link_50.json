        "text": "Monthly Archives: January 2022\n\nRoyal Chapel at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden\n\nby Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nThe Royal Palace is located in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. It is the official residence and major royal palace of the Swedish monarch although the actual residence of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia is Drottningholm Palace in Ekerö municipality on the island of Lovön in Lake Mälaren, west of Stockholm, Sweden. However, the offices of the Swedish monarch, other members of the Swedish royal family, and the Royal Court of Sweden are located at the Royal Palace.\n\nThe current palace was built on the site of the former Tre Kroner Castle (Three Crowns Castle), built in the 13th century, which was destroyed by fire in 1697. Construction began in 1697 and was completed in 1760. The Royal Palace was designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. After Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the Royal Palace was completed by Swedish architect Carl Hårleman who also designed a large part of its interior.\n\n********************\n\nThe Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, which this writer has visited, is a church of the Church of Sweden, an Evangelical Lutheran church. It is the parish church for the members of the Royal Parish which comprises the Swedish royal family, employees at the court, and their relatives. Services are held every Sunday and on holy days, and the royal family uses the church for other ceremonies.\n\nBuilt during the 18th century along with the rest of the Royal Palace, the Royal Chapel was consecrated in 1754. The ceiling paintings and decorations have the theme of the Ascension of Jesus Christ and were the collaborative work of Swedish architect Carl Hårleman, French painter Guillaume Taraval and Swedish decorative artist Johan Pasch and French sculptors Jacques Philippe Bouchardon (link in French) and Charles Guillaume Cousin (link in Swedish).\n\nThanksgiving service in 2013 marking the 40th anniversary of King Carl XVI Gustaf’s accession to the throne. There is a good view of the pulpit on the right.\n\nThe pulpit was created in the years 1748 -1751 mainly by French sculptor Jacques-Philippe Bouchardon.\n\nJacques-Philippe Bouchardon had been working on an altarpiece but he died before it was completed. His replacement Swedish sculptor Pierre Hubert L’Archevêque damaged Bouchardon’s incomplete work out of rivalry and began his own altarpiece. L’Archevêque eventually tired of working on the altarpiece and it was completed in 1779 by Johan Tobias Sergel, one of Sweden’s greatest sculptors. The magnificent altarpiece depicts Jesus Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane. Above the altar is a banner carried by two angels with the Latin words Pro Mundi Vita, “For the world to live” from the Gospel of John.\n\nThis short video of video clips from the christening of Princess Estelle, daughter of Crown Princess Victoria, provides some views of the Royal Chapel.\n\nYouTube: Christening of Princess Estelle of Sweden\n\n*********************\n\nIt can be assumed that after the completion of the Royal Palace in 1754, christenings and other religious events occurred at the Royal Chapel. It is a tradition in the Swedish royal family to attend a Te Deum at the Royal Chapel to give thanks for the birth of a new royal baby within days of the birth. Some recent Te Deums are listed below.\n\nSome royal events at the Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Sweden include:\n\nNovember 10, 1778 – Christening of the future King Gustav IV Adolf, son of King Gustav III\n\n1782 – Christening of Prince Karl Gustav, Duke of Småland, son of King Gustav III; Prince Karl Gustav died at the age of six months\n\nOctober 31, 1797 – Wedding of King Gustav IV Adolf and Princess Frederica of Baden\n\nJuly 7, 1774 – Wedding of King Karl XIII and Princess Hedwig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp\n\nMay 5, 1910 – Christening of Princess Ingrid, daughter of King Gustaf VI Adolf\n\nJune 7, 1946 – Christening of the future King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, Duke of Västerbotten\n\nDecember 7, 1972 – Funeral of Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Princess of Sweden, Duchess of Västerbotten, mother of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nJune 15, 1974 – Wedding of Princess Christina, sister of King Carl XVI Gustaf, and Tord Magnuson\n\nAugust 31, 1979 – Christening of Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, son of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nAugust 31, 1982 – Christening of Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf\n\nFebruary 24, 2012 – Te Deum for the birth of Princess Estelle, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf, daughter of Crown Princess Victoria\n\nMay 12, 2012 – Christening of Princess Estelle, Duchess of Östergötland, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf, daughter of Crown Princess Victoria\n\nJune 8, 2013 – Wedding of Princess Madeleine and Christopher O’Neill\n\nSeptember 15, 2013 – Thanksgiving service marking the 40th anniversary of King Carl XVI Gustaf’s accession to the throne\n\nMarch 2, 2014 – Te Deum for the birth of Princess Leonore, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf, daughter of Princess Madeleine\n\nJune 13, 2015 – Wedding of Prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist\n\nJune 18, 2015 – Te Deum for the birth of Prince Nicholas, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Princess Madeleine\n\nMarch 3, 2016 – Te Deum for the birth of Prince Oscar, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Crown Princess Victoria\n\nApril 22, 2016 – Te Deum for the birth of Prince Alexander, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Prince Carl Philip\n\nMay 27, 2016 – Christening of Prince Oscar, Duke of Skåne, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Crown Princess Victoria\n\nSeptember 4, 2017 – Te Deum for the birth of Prince Gabriel, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Prince Carl Philip\n\nMarch 12, 2018 – Te Deum for the birth of Princess Adrienne, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf, daughter of Princess Madeleine\n\nMarch 28, 2020 – Te Deum for the birth of Prince Julian, grandson of King Carl XVI Gustaf, son of Prince Carl Philip\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Franz de Paula Josef Johann Nepomuk Andreas was born on November 19, 1726, in Milan, Duchy of Milan, now in Italy. He was the eldest of the thirteen children and the eldest of the eight sons of Prince Emanuel of Liechtenstein (1700 – 1771) and Countess Maria Anna Antonia of Dietrichstein-Weichselstädt, Baroness of Hollenburg and Finkenstein (1706 – 1777).\n\nFranz Josef had twelve younger siblings:\n\nPrince Karl Borromeo of Liechtenstein (1730 – 1789), married Princess Maria Eleonore of Oettingen-Spielberg, had seven children\n\nPrince Philipp Josef of Liechtenstein (1731 – 1757), unmarried, died in battle\n\nPrince Emanuel Josef of Liechtenstein (1732 – 1738), died in childhood\n\nPrince Johann Josef of Liechtenstein (1734 – 1781), unmarried\n\nPrince Anton Josef of Liechtenstein (1735 – 1737), died in childhood\n\nPrince Joseph Wenzel of Liechtenstein (1736 – 1739), died in childhood\n\nPrincess Maria Amalia of Liechtenstein (1737 – 1787), married Johannes Siegmund Friedrich, 2nd Prince of Khevenhüller-Metsch, had seven children\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Liechtenstein (1738 – 1814), married Count Emanuel Philibert von Waldstein, had eleven children\n\nPrincess Franziska Xaveria of Liechtenstein (1739 – 1821), Charles-Joseph, 7th Prince of Ligne, had seven children\n\nPrincess Maria Christina of Liechtenstein (1741 – 1819), married Count Franz Ferdinand Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau, had four children\n\nPrincess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein (1741 – 1766), married Count Karl Joseph Pálffy ab Erdöd, Chancellor of Hungary, had two children\n\nPrince Josef Leopold of Liechtenstein (1743 – 1771), unmarried\n\nFranz Josef’s father was the younger brother of Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein who reigned from 1712 – 1718, was Regent from 1732 – 1745, and then reigned again from 1748 until he died in 1772. Joseph Wenzel had five children, including three sons, and all five died in early childhood. Noting that his nephew Franz Josef might be a future Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein, Joseph Wenzel took him under his wing.\n\nFrom the age of 20, Franz Josef accompanied his uncle Joseph Wenzel on military campaigns during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740 – 1748). He fought in the Battle of Piacenza where his uncle led the troops of the Holy Roman Empire to victory. Liechtenstein was a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire. The Wars of the Austrian Succession ensured that Maria Theresa, the only surviving child of Holy Roman Emperor Karl VI, would be the sovereign ruler of the Habsburg territories. However, because only males could be elected Holy Roman Emperors, Maria Theresa arranged for her husband Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine, Grand Duke of Tuscany to be elected Holy Roman Emperor. Despite the snub, Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria, and Queen of Hungary, Croatia, and Bohemia wielded the real power. Maria Theresa was the sovereign ruler of the Habsburg territories from 1740 until she died in 1780, which coincides with the years of Franz Josef’s adulthood and his reign as Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\nOn July 6, 1750, Franz Josef married Countess Leopoldine von Sternberg, the daughter of Count Franz Philipp of Sternberg and Countess Leopoldine of Starhemberg.\n\nFranz Josef and Leopoldine had eight children:\n\nPrince Josef Franz of Liechtenstein (1752 – 1754), died in childhood\n\nPrincess Leopoldina of Liechtenstein (1754 – 1823), married Karl Emanuel, Landgrave of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, had one son\n\nPrincess Maria Antonia of Liechtenstein (1756 – 1821), became a nun\n\nPrince Franz de Paula Josefof Liechtenstein (1758 – 1760), died in childhood\n\nAlois I, Prince of Liechtenstein (1759 – 1805), married Karoline von Manderscheid-Blankenheim, no children\n\nJohann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein (1760 – 1836), married Landgravine Josepha of Fürstenberg-Weitra, had fourteen children\n\nPrince Philipp Josef of Liechtenstein (1762 – 1802), unmarried\n\nPrincess Maria Josefa of Liechtenstein (1768 – 1845), married Nikolaus 7th Prince Esterházy von Galántha, had two children\n\nFranz Josef participated in a number of diplomatic missions on behalf of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1760, Franz Josef accompanied his uncle Joseph Wenzel on a trip to the Duchy of Parma, now in Italy, where they accompanied Princess Isabella of Parma to Vienna, Austria where she married Archduke Joseph of Austria, the future Holy Roman Emperor. In 1761, Franz Josef accompanied Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, brother of Holy Roman Emperor Francis Stephen, who was a Field Marsal of the Imperial Army, and Governor of the Austrian Netherlands to Mergentheim Palace, the administrative seat of the Teutonic Order, then in Bad Mergentheim, Fraconia, now in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. There Prince Charles Alexander was unanimously elected the 52nd Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.\n\nIn 1763, Franz Josef traveled to Spain during the marriage negotiations for Archduke Leopold of Austria, the future Holy Roman Emperor, to give his potential (and future) bride Infanta Maria Luisa of Spain a portrait of Archduke Leopold. In 1767, Franz Josef was made a member of the Imperial Privy Council and in 1771 he became the 802nd Commander of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In 1778, Franz Josef was appointed president of the Lower Austrian nobility assembly.\n\nWhen Franz Josef’s uncle Josef Wenzel, Prince of Liechtenstein died on February 10, 1772, with no surviving sons, he was succeeded by his nephew as Franz Josef I, Prince of Liechtenstein. Franz Josef immediately resigned from all his governmental duties of the Holy Roman Empire. Instead, he devoted himself to the administration of his estates. Franz Josef’s wealth significantly increased in 1772 when he received an inheritance from Maria Theresia, Duchess of Savoy-Carignano who had been born Princess Maria Theresia of Liechtenstein, the only surviving child of Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein. Maria Theresia’s only child predeceased her and Franz Josef was her distant, but nearest, relative.\n\nFranz Josef I, Prince of Liechtenstein, died August 18, 1781, aged 54, in Metz, France. He was buried in the Old Crypt at Chuch of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary in Vranov, Moravia, now in the Czech Republic. After Franz Josef’s death, his widow Leopoldine lived with one of her daughters in Vienna, Austria. She survived her husband by twenty-eight years, dying at the age of 75 on June 27, 1809, and was buried at St. Andrew’s Church in Vienna-Hütteldorf, Austria.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

It is the private residence of the Swedish royal family. Drottningholm Palace was designed by Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. When he died, his son Nicodemus Tessin the Younger continued his work and completed the interior designs. Construction began in 1696 and was completed in 1728. The palace grounds include a beautiful baroque garden and other gardens featuring numerous sculptures and statues, along with several fountains and water features.\n\nThe Royal Chapel, which this writer has visited, is on the northern end of Drottningholm Palace with an entrance leading directly into the palace. It is a church of the Church of Sweden, an Evangelical Lutheran Church. The building is completely round with three slightly protruding middle sections and is covered by a copper dome with windows topped by a lantern. The main entrance is located on the west side facing the gardens. The construction of the Royal Chapel was completed in 1728 and during the following years, Swedish architect Carl Hårleman oversaw the interior decoration work. The altarpiece depicting The Last Supper was done by the court painter Georg Engelhard Schröder. In 1730, the church was consecrated and it has been in continuous use since then. The altar is facing north, opposite the royal pew. The pews in the side aisles in the east-west direction were installed from 1910 – 1912.\n\nThe christening of Princess Leonore, granddaughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf, in 2014\n\nThe local Lovön Parish conducts services in the chapel on the last weekend of each month.
