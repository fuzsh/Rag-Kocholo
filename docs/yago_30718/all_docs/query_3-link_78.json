        "text": "The Amazon Throne\n\nThe Orleans-Braganza of Brazil\n\nBy Arturo Beéche\n\nDuring the XIXth century Europe exported two dynasties across the Atlantic to America. The first was established by the Portuguese royal family in Brazil during Napoleonic times; the second was established under the sponsorship of Napoleon III in Mexico. Of the two, the Mexican experiment was the most short-lived for it barely lasted four years. In contrast, the Brazilian empire lasted almost the entire century.\n\nFearing Napoleon's onslaught the Portuguese royal family left Lisbon and moved their court to Brazil, the crown's most prized possession. Dom Joao of Braganza, Regent of Portugal, packed his family and his demented mother, Queen Maria I, and headed for the sunny coasts of Brazil. As the Portuguese royal family left Lisbon, Napoleon's troops led by the anti-monarchist General Junot overran the Portuguese border. On a cold November morning in 1807, the royal exodus started its long voyage into exile. Along with the royal family came an entourage estimated to include almost fifteen thousand people. The people of Lisbon watched in dismay as their ruler abandoned the country to the fate of the invading Napoleonic legions. But he had made the decision to escape the invasion, nothing would deter Dom Joao who believed that moving to Brazil would save his family from becoming Napoleon's puppets just as some of his royal cousins throughout Europe had Dome.\n\nThe Portuguese royal contingent arrived on the coasts of Brazil on January 21, 1808. Brazilians who witnessed this most unexpected arrival went wild with ovations for the exiled royals. Two months later the royal party arrived at their final destination, the beautiful port of Rio de Janeiro. It was at Rio that Dom Joao decided to settle his court in exile, and it was from there that he vigorously rebuild the fortunes of his shattered kingdom. Dom Joao opened Brazilian ports to foreign trade and basically constituted the colony into an independent, self-reliant kingdom under the rule of the House of Braganza. In due time, Dom Joao would acquire properties in the countryside to where the royal family would retire to lead a quiet life away from the exigencies of court life.\n\nThe fall of Napoleon in 1814 restored the Portuguese royal family to their throne in Lisbon. Despite this event, Dom Joao refused to return to Europe until the political situation there settled. He was also faced with an uncertain future in Brazil if he departed. Dom Joao, who was married to Infanta Carlota Joaquina of Spain, had two sons, neither of which had reached majority in 1814. Dom Pedro, the eldest of the Braganza princes, was sixteen, his brother Dom Miguel was only twelve years old. And since Brazil had become a semi-independent political entity during Dom Joao's stay, the Prince Regent did not want to lose control over the affairs if the colony. Further pressure to return to Portugal was caused by the death of Queen Maria I in 1816. Dom Joao had acted as regent for his mother for almost two decades. Now he had finally ascended to he throne as Joao VI of Portugal, Joao I of Brazil. His coronation took place in Brazil amid pomp never before witnessed by the colonials.\n\nOnce safely enthroned Dom Joao went about sending envoys to various European courts in search for a bride for his heir. Several potential brides were inspected, yet none had the qualifications found in the Archduchess Maria-Leopoldina of Habsburg. Referred to as Leopoldina, the Austrian Archduchess was one of the daughters of Emperor Franz I and a sister of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon's second wife. For the faraway Braganzas the hand of Marie-Leopoldina was a great dynastic coup. It certainly did not matter one bit that Dom Pedro had never set eyes on his future bride and that he was more interested in chasing young Brazilian ladies than in entering a dynastic union with an Austrian Archduchess.\n\npart II\n\nLeopoldina arrived in Brazil at the end of 1817. The Braganzas waited for her with great trepidation, particularly Dom Pedro. now styled as Prince of Beira. Leopoldina must have made a good impression on her husband for several months after her arrival the Brazilian court announced her first pregnancy. Leopoldina's first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage, no doubt caused by the ravages the Brazilian climate had inflicted on her frail body. Despite this, Pedro and Leopoldina continued their efforts to provide the crown with an heir. The couple's first child, Princess Maria da Gloria of Braganza, was born in 1819. Two years later the much awaited heir arrived on March 6, 1821. The newborn Braganza was given the name of Joao.\n\nSoon after the birth of his grandson, Joao VI finally returned to Portugal. Along with him went most members of the Braganza family, Pedro remained in Brazil to act as regent for his father. Initially Joao VI was appalled at Pedro's desire to remain in Brazil, but after his son refused to back away from his decision, the king agreed to Pedro and Leopoldina remaining behind. Dom Miguel, the king's second son, did not question returning to Portugal for he never really adapted to life in Brazil. Besides it is quite possible that Miguel already foresaw his future as monarch of Portugal while his brother remained ruler of Brazil.\n\nLeopoldina's life in Brazil was to be fraught with anxieties over her future, that of her children and the decreasing attention paid her by her husband. Her first disappointment was the untimely death of little Prince Joao in 1822. The arrival of a second daughter one month after Joao's death did not improve much the parents' spirits. For Pedro an heir was a necessity since the heir presumptive to Portugal and Brazil was his increasingly troublesome brother Dom Miguel. A third daughter, Paula Mariana, was born in 1823.\n\nIn late 1822, Prince Regent Pedro of Braganza decided to stage a coup d'etat to emancipate Brazil from the Portuguese crown. Joao VI himself had recommended this course of action as a means of guaranteeing the Brazilian crown would remain under the Braganzas. During the royal family's long stay in Brazil the colony had learned how to rule itself without Lisbon's guidance. Once Napoleon's regime was ousted, Lisbon faintly tried to restore its control over Brazilian affairs. This course of action was deeply resented by the Brazilians who were deeply resentful of Portuguese involvement in the country's internal affairs. Thus to guarantee that Brazil would not be completely lost, Prince Regent Pedro gave his support to the independence movement that sealed the colony's break from Lisbon. At the age of twenty-four, the Prince Regent became Emperor Pedro I of Brazil.\n\nIn the meantime, Pedro I continued to neglect his Austrian consort. It seemed that the only reason why he spent any time with her was in an effort to produce the long-awaited heir. The couple's fourth daughter, Francisca Carolina, was born in 1824. Pedro's impatience with Leopoldina knew no bounds and he continued to spend more time away from her and in the arms of his mistresses. Leopoldina's life in Brazil had turned into a living inferno, far away from her family, ignored by her husband, the young Brazilian empress slowly fell into deep depression. In Vienna, Emperor Franz I openly referred to his Brazilian son-in-law as a scoundrel. Nonetheless, Pedro and Leopoldina continued their efforts to produce an heir. The arrival of Prince Pedro de Alcantara of Braganza in late 1825, was Leopoldina's crowning satisfaction. Exhausted by constant childbearing since her arrival in Brazil, Empress Leopoldina died practically ignored by her husband one year after the birth of the couple's only surviving son.\n\nOld King Joao VI died in early 1826. Faced with the quandary concerning the succession to his two thrones, Pedro I abdicated the Portuguese crown on his daughter Maria da Gloria. Pending her arrival in Portugal, Dom Miguel was declared Prince Regent of Portugal. Pedro also agreed to have his daughter marry her uncle Miguel upon becoming of age. Despite these future plans, Dom Miguel had other ideas in mind. It would not be long before Pedro I was faced with a rebellious brother who had tired of acting second fiddle for an absent monarch. In fact, Dom Miguel of Braganza considered himself the rightful heir to the Portuguese crown. Before Maria da Gloria's arrival, Dom Miguel staged a palace coup d'etat and declared enthroned himself as King Miguel I of Portugal. Maria da Gloria and her entourage sought refuge in London, pending a solution to Miguel's treacherous act. Three years she spent as the guest of the British monarch while Pedro I did little to strip Miguel of his illegally obtained kingly mantle. In 1829, Maria da Gloria returned to Brazil on the same ship transporting her widowed father's new bride, Princess Amelia of Leuchtenberg."
