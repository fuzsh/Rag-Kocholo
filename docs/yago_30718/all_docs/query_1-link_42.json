S.g.\n\nBRANCH – Absolutist\n\nBraganza – Herédia of Braganza\n\nDescendants of former Prince Dom Miguel, second son of King Dom João VI and Queen Dona Carlota Joaquina de Bourbon. The then Prince Dom Miguel, after the failure of the Abrilada movement on April 30, 1824, was forced by his August Father to leave the Kingdom, settling in Viena of Austria. In 1826, he agreed with his brother Dom Pedro, the consortium with his niece D. Maria II, having thus sworn the Constitutional Charter on 4 October 1826. In 1828, he returns to the Kingdom, undoing the oath, declaring himself King on June 30, 1828, provoking a civil war between his defenders and those of his niece (constitutional defenders) that would culminate in his defeat in 1834. By Decree of March 17, 1834, is deprived of the honors of Infante (Prince). In the same year, on 26 May, he is obliged, by the Évora Monte Convention, as well as by his own declaration of 29 of the same month, to leave the Kingdom, boarding Sines on the 1st of June. He and his descendants were declared unfit for the succession of the Throne by the Law of December 19, 1834 (Travassos Valdez, Almanach of Portugal, Lisbon, 1856, p. 6).\n\nSince his banishment, the usurper D. Miguel of Braganza has misused several titles belonging to the Royal House of Portugal, a practice continued by his descendants, which was abusively and unlawfully (in the light of applicable law until 5 October 1910). They used in particular the titles of Duke of Braganza, Guimarães, Viseu, etc., systematically harassing the Reigning Royal Family in Portugal until the end of the monarchy; continuing to do the same abuse during the life of El-King Dom Manuel II and Queen Dona Amelia de Orléans (in A Casa de Bragança – História e Polémica, Portugália Editora, Lisboa, 1940, pp. 93, 103, 104, 108, 170, e 171).\n\nAfter the death of El-King Dom Manuel II in 1932, without descendents, D. Duarte Nuno de Bragança (1907-1976), the usurper’s grandson, was arbitrarily and absurdly appointed by an Assembly of integralist monarchists of the movements of the time, namely the Junta Central do Integralismo Lusitano – assigned to the miguelist faction, as Successor to the Throne of Portugal (in Documentos da Aclamação d’El-Rei D. Duarte II, União Monárquica, Lisboa, 1933, p. 35). This farce, of no legal value whatsoever (in light of the Law of the Succession of the Crown of the Portuguese Monarchy), was a cunning device with the appearance of supposed normality, used by the abslutist / Integralists, to deceive the constitutional monarchs, and thus try to legitimize the old ambitions of the absolutists.\n\nNevertheless, it was not until 1942 that there was a greater consensus, when through the marriage he made to her relative of the Imperial House of Brazil – Princess Dona Maria Francisca of Orléans and Braganza (1914-1968), it united by blood ties, the absolutists and constitutionalists, and under the auspices of Salazar and his regimen, the Estado Novo, widespread support, culminating on May 17, 1950 with the repeal by the National Assembly of the Banning Act of 1834, allowing the entry of descendants of former Prince D. Miguel de Bragança into Portugal.\n\nYears later, this apparent consensus would be undone by their eldest son – D. Duarte Pio of Braganza for his marriage in 1995 to D. Isabel Curvelo de Herédia, a descendant of Francisco de Herédia, one of the main implicated in the regicide of El-Rei Dom Carlos I and the Royal Prince Dom Luis Filipe on February 1, 1908 (see Jorge de Morais “Regicídio a contagem decrescente 100 anos [1908-2008]”, pp.127-129,130-132,160,161). This monstrous crime contributed decisively to the fall of the monarchy and the establishment of the republic (October 5, 1910) .As King Dom Pedro V had already mentioned about the miguelist claims: – There is a bloody history, which is not forgotten; there is an obstinacy that does not fall! ” (Cartas de D. Pedro V aos seus Contemporâneos, p. 238).\n\nBRANCH – Constitutional\n\nDUKES OF LOULÉ\n\nBraganza – Mendóça Rolim de Moura Barreto – Folque de Mendóça\n\nFolque of Braganza and Bourbon of Mendóça\n\nThe House of the Dukes of Loulé is descendent from the Mendóça Family, one of the Grandee of Spain, both for antiquity and nobility, as well as for the fruitful offspring with which it has expanded into various branches throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Descending from D. Iñigo Lopes, 6th Sovereign Lord of Biscay (1025-1076), being entwined by marriage through the centuries with the Royal Houses of Portugal, Castile, León, Navarre and Aragon; and also with the major Families of these Kingdoms, so that you will not find today in the whole peninsula Great House or peer of the Old Nobility, with which it is not related. The Dukes of Loule are the Dynastic line of the Portuguese Royal House, and they have among others, the titles of Duke of Loule (1862), Marquis of Loule (1799), Count of Vale de Reis (1628), Lord of Azambuja (1200), Montargil (13th century), and Póvoa e Meadas (1482); Alcaide-mor (like Mayor) of the Villages of Azambuja (12th Century), Moura (1640), Loulé and Albufeira (17th Century); They are Representative of the house of Duke of Terceira (1832) and of the House of Counts of Rio Grande (1678); The Duke of Loulé are th Head of Name and Arms of Portuguese Mendóças, Barretos, Rolins (Azambujas) and Mouras.\n\nFrom 1827, with the wedding of Nuno de Mendóça, 2nd Marquis of Loulé (latter 1st Duke of Loulé), heir and successor of this House, with H.R.H. Princess Dona Ana de Jesus Maria de Bragança and Bourbon (1806 – 1857), Infanta of Portugal, youngest daughter of King Dom João VI (1767-1826) and Queen Dona Carlota Joaquina de Borbón (Princess of Spain), the House of the Dukes of Loule as Dynastic Line of the Royal House of Portugal, becomes the first line of succession of the Crown of Portugal, after the Portuguese descendants of Queen Dona Maria II. Thus the members of this House came to be in a position equivalent to that in France (since the XV century) is called Prince du Sang (Prince of the Blood. (in Luiz de Mello Vaz de São Payo, “A Linha de Sucessão”, Revista Raízes & Memórias, nº 9, Associação Portuguesa de Genealogia, Lisboa, 1993, págs. 15 a 21).\n\nThis marriage was carried out as prescribed by the old Kingdom laws and the Constitutional Charter for Princess marriages, that is, with prior royal authorization and with a Portuguese. It should be noted that the Marquês de Loulé, besides being Great of the Kingdom, was by the four sides, several times descended from the Royal House of Portugal, and through his grandfather the 3rd Duke of Cadaval, was in the 18th place of the Crown of Portugal Succession Line.\n\nAssim, a Sereníssima Senhora Infanta Dona Ana de Jesus Maria, continuou com todos os direitos que lhe cabiam por nascimento na Sucessão da Coroa Portuguesa, transmitindo à sua descendência os mesmos direitos dinásticos à Coroa de Portugal. A partir de então a Casa dos Duques de Loulé como Ramo Dinástico da Casa Real, ocupa a primeira linha na Sucessão da Coroa. Em 1932, depois da morte d’El-Rei Dom Manuel II, a Herdeira da Casa Loulé, passa a deter a legitimidade de jure na Sucessão da Coroa de Portugal e na Sereníssima Casa de Bragança\n\nThus, H.R.H Princess Dona Ana de Jesus Maria, maintained all the rights that she had by birth in the Succession of the Portuguese Crown, transmitting to her descendants the same dynastic rights to the Crown of Portugal. From then on, the House of the Dukes of Loule as the Dynastic Branch of the Royal House, occupies the first line in the Crown Succession. In 1932, after the death of King Manuel II, the heiress of Casa Loulé came to have de jure legitimacy in the Succession of the Crown of Portugal and to the House of Braganza (see Casas Reais Europeias – Portugal, Coleção Flash!, SocTip, Lisboa, 2004, pp. 11 e 38).\n\nH.R.H. Princess Dona Ana de Jesus Maria de Braganza and Bourbon (1806-1857), Infanta of Portugal, Marchioness of de Loulé, Countess of Barcelos, Grand Cross of the Order of Our Lady of Vila Viçosa, Lady of the Order of Santa Isabel , and of the Order of the Noble Ladies of Maria Luisa (Spain), etc., Married, in the Chapel of the Royal Palace of Queluz, in December 5, 1827, with Lord Nuno José Severo de Mendóça Rolim de Moura Barreto (1804-1875) , 1st Duke of Loulé (1862), 2nd Marquess of Loulé, 9th Count of Vale de Reis, 24th Lorf of Azambuja, 14th Lord of the Majorat of Quarteira, 12th Lord of Póvoa e Meadas, Representative of the House of Dukes of Terceira (1832) with honors from Royal Relative (1838), Representative of the House of theCounts of Rio Grande, etc .; Gentleman of the King’s House and Crown Equerry of King Dom João VI (and of King Dom Pedro V and Dom Luis I), Hereditary Peer of Realm (1826), President of the Kingdom’s Peer Chamber, President of the Council of Ministers (now Prime Minister) , Member of the Council of State, Division General, Cross of the Orders of the Tower and Sword, Commander of the Order of Christ, Cross of various foreign orders, etc., son of the 1st Marquess of Loulé.
