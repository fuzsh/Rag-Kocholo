        "text": "Princess Maria Elisabeth of Orléans-Bragança [Bavaria] (1914-2011)\n\nI am sorry to learn of the death at 96 of Princess Maria Elisabeth of Orléans-Braganza (née Bavaria), widow of Dom Pedro Henrique of Orléans-Braganza (1909-1981) and granddaughter of King Ludwig III of Bavaria (1845-1921), though even sorrier that Brazil and Bavaria remain occupied by republics. Princess Maria Elisabeth, whose son Dom Luiz is considered by most monarchists to be the current head of the Imperial House of Brazil, was the last member of the House of Wittelsbach to have been born when that ancient dynasty still reigned in Bavaria. She was born on September 9, 1914, at Nymphenburg Castle to Prince Franz of Bavaria and Princess Isabelle (née Croÿ) of Bavaria, married Dom Pedro Henrique there on August 19, 1937 (8 sons, 2 daughters), and died on May 13, 2011 in Rio de Janeiro. Requiescat in pace."
