        "text": "compiled by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2022\n\nCrown Princess Victoria of Sweden has had COVID-19 twice\n\nDuring the 14th century, the bubonic plague, also known as the Black Death, the Pestilence, and the Plague, is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe’s population.

Just as epidemics of smallpox and the plague in the past knew no class boundaries, the same holds true for COVID-19. Except for two deaths of minor royals from the African Kingdom of Eswatini, we are unaware of any royal deaths from COVID-19.\n\nRead more at Unofficial Royalty: Royal Deaths and Illnesses\n\nThis does not purport to be a complete list and will be updated as needed.\n\nCurrent Monarchies\n\nKingdom of Belgium\n\nPrincess Claire, wife of Prince Laurent: May 2020\n\nPrince Joachim, son of Princess Astrid: May 2020\n\nAn unidentified member of the Belgian royal family: September 2021\n\nPrincess Delphine, daughter of King Albert II: October 2021\n\nPrince Laurent, son of King Albert II: November 2021\n\nKingdom of Denmark\n\nPrince Christian, son of Crown Prince Frederik: December 2020\n\nCrown Princess Mary, wife of Crown Prince Frederik: December 2021\n\nQueen Margrethe II: February 2022, September 2022\n\nPrincess Benedikte, sister of Queen Margrethe II: February 2022\n\nKingdom of Eswatini (formerly Swaziland)\n\nPrince Tshekedi Dlamini, grandson of King Sobhuza II: died August 2020\n\nPrincess Ngabisa Dlamini, granddaughter of King Sobhuza II: died August 2020\n\nKing Mswati III: January 2021\n\nState of Japan\n\nPrincess Yoko, daughter of the late Prince Tomohito: February 2022\n\nPrincess Mikasa, widow of the late Prince Mikasa, son of Emperor Taishō: July 2022\n\nPrincess Tsuguko, daughter of the late Prince Takamado: July 2022\n\nPrincess Akiko, daughter of the late Prince Tomohito: July 2022\n\nPrincess Hisako, widow of Prince Takamado: November 2022\n\nCrown Prince Kiko, wife of Crown Prince Akishino: July 2023\n\nPrincess Kako, daughter of Crown Prince Akishino: September 2023\n\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan\n\nCrown Prince Hussein, son of King Abdullah II: September 2021\n\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg\n\nGrand Duke Henri: January 2022\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Theresa: May 2023\n\nHereditary Grand Duke Guillaume, son of Grand Duke Henri: January 2022\n\nPrincipality of Monaco\n\nPrince Albert II: March 2020, April 2022, January 2023\n\nJazmin Grace Grimaldi, illegitimate daughter of Prince Albert II: July 2020\n\nKingdom of Morocco\n\nKing Mohammed VI: June 2022\n\nPrince Moulay Rachid, brother of King Mohammed VI: October 2022\n\nKingdom of the Netherlands\n\nCountess Eloise of Orange-Nassau, daughter of Prince Constantijn: 2020\n\nPrincess Beatrix (formerly Queen Beatrix): December 2021\n\nKingdom of Norway\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra, daughter of Crown Prince Haakon: August 2021\n\nLeah Behn, daughter of Princess Märtha Louise: January 2022\n\nKing Harald V: March 2022\n\nCrown Prince Haakon, son of King Harald V: June 2022\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit, wife of Crown Prince Haakon: August 2022, December 2023\n\nState of Qatar\n\nFormer Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani: April 2020\n\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\nPrince Waleed bin Sadr Al Saud: September 2020\n\nAbout 150 members of the Saudi royal family had COVID-19 during April 2020.
