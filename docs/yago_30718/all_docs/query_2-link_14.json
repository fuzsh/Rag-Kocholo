        "text": "This article explores the complexities surrounding the dynastic succession of the former Brazilian Empire (1822-1889). The question of who would have inherited the throne if the monarchy had continued remains a topic of interest and debate. The article answers the question who can be considered the legitimate heir to this historical lineage. It uses the former legislation of the Empire as a guideline.\n\n“Discovery of Brazil”\n\nUniquely, the Portuguese Empire holds the distinction of being the first global empire in history. Established during a period of exploration, it stretched across continents, encompassing territories in South America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. From the trade routes of Asia to the coasts of South America, the Portuguese influence left an undeniable mark on the world stage. Spanning nearly five centuries, the empire outlasted its European counterparts – the Spanish, British, and French empires. This period of dominance allowed for the establishment of trade networks, cultural exchange, and the dissemination of the Portuguese language and customs in diverse regions across the globe.\n\nThe term “discovery of Brazil” (Portuguese: descobrimento do Brasil) traditionally refers to the first arrival of European explorers on the land that is now Brazil. However, the term “discovery” itself is problematic. This narrative implies that the land was previously empty or uninhabited, ignoring the existence and rich history of indigenous populations who had been living in Brazil for millennia. This perspective may be said to reflect a Eurocentric viewpoint that prioritizes European historical records, overlooking the pre-existing cultural and societal context.\n\nBefore European contact, Brazil’s landscape was home to a vibrant tapestry of indigenous peoples. These diverse communities, estimated at around 2.000 nations and tribes, practiced a variety of lifestyles, including semi-nomadism and settled communities. Their livelihoods were primarily sustained through hunting, fishing, gathering, agriculture, and arboriculture (tree cultivation). Unfortunately, the arrival of Europeans in the 16th century marked a turning point for these indigenous populations. The introduction of European diseases, against which the Indians had no immunity, had a devastating impact. Coupled with enslavement, genocide, and the disruption of their traditional way of life, these factors resulted in a drastic decline in the indigenous population.\n\nBy 2000, the estimated pre-Columbus population of millions plummeted to just around 300.000, regrouping into roughly 200 tribes. This represents a loss of over 90% of the indigenous population within a few centuries. While some indigenous communities were assimilated into the broader Brazilian population, the majority faced marginalization and loss of their cultural heritage. The arrival of Europeans in Brazil has left a lasting legacy of devastation and displacement for the country’s indigenous population (see: Livi-Bacci, M. [2006]. The Depopulation of Hispanic America after the Conquest. Population and Development Review, 32(2), 199–232).\n\nColonisation\n\nThe discovery of Brazil commonly refers to the sighting on 22 April 1500 by a Portuguese fleet under the command of Pedro Álvares Cabral (c. 1467 or 1468 – c. 1520) of the coast near Monte Pascoal. Cabral was a Portuguese nobleman, military commander, navigator, and explorer who led the first known expedition to have touched four continents: Europe, Africa, America, and Asia. The land was then named Ilha de Vera Cruz (“Island of the True Cross”) but quickly renamed Terra de Santa Cruz (“Land of the Holy Cross”). In a final change to the name of the new lands, the colonizers decided to name it Brazil due to the great availability of Brazilwood in the region. Cabral’s voyage was part of Portugal’s broader period of exploration, often referred to as the “Portuguese Discoveries.”\n\nWhile the term “discovery of Brazil” typically references Cabral’s voyage, it also includes the earlier arrival of Vicente Yáñez Pinzón (c. 1462 – after 1514). Pinzón was a Spanish navigator and explorer, and the youngest of the Pinzón brothers. Along with his older brother, Martín Alonso Pinzón (c. 1441 – c. 1493), who captained the Pinta, he sailed with Christopher Columbus on the first voyage to the New World, in 1492, as captain of the Niña. Pinzón reached Cape Santo Agostinho in present-day Pernambuco on 26 January 1500. This marks the first confirmed European landing in Brazil.\n\nIn the early 16th century, Portugal employed a unique system to colonize Brazil. “Terra de Santa Cruz”, was divided into administrative zones known as Captaincies. Each Captaincy was a hereditary fiefdom granted to a Portuguese nobleman, who held the title of Captain-General. These individuals wielded significant governing power within their domain. This “captaincy system” was not new. Portugal had used it successfully on Atlantic islands like Madeira and the Azores. The idea was to incentivize colonization by offering Portuguese nobility land grants and governing privileges in exchange for developing the territory. Eventually, most Captaincies failed due to a lack of resources from the noblemen (donees) and minimal support from the Portuguese crown. Four captaincies never even got off the ground, with the donees failing to take control. Another four were quickly overwhelmed by indigenous resistance. By 1549, only a handful survived: São Vicente, Pernambuco, Ilhéus, and Porto Seguro.\n\nWhen the Portuguese Inquisition officially began in the year 1536, Brazil inhabited only the extreme margins of the Portuguese Empire and therefore was of little concern to the Inquisitors in Lisbon. Royal authority only became permanently established in 1549 when Tomé de Sousa (1503–1579) became the first governor-general of Brazil until 1553. The establishment of ecclesiastical authority over Brazil occurred about the same time through the padroado real (royal patronage). The Order of Christ (whose grand master was the king himself) and the Mesa da Consciência e Ordens administered the royal patronage in the colony. The Church in Brazil remained directly subordinate to the archbishopric of Funchal on Madeira until the first diocese was established in Bahia in 1551. Throughout the entire colonial period, Bahia (since 1676) remained the only archbishopric in Brazil. Eventually, six bishoprics were established (see: Wadsworth, James E. In the Name of the Inquisition: The Portuguese Inquisition and Delegated Authority in Colonial Pernambuco, Brazil. The Americas, vol. 61, 2004, p. 19-52. Project MUSE).\n\nDutch Brazil\n\nFrom 1630 onwards, the Dutch Republic conquered a significant portion of settled areas in Brazil, establishing their capital in Recife. The Dutch West India Company took control under Governor John Maurice of Nassau, called “the Brazilian” for his fruitful period as governor of Dutch Brazil. The Dutch attempted to bolster the colony’s image by inviting artists and scientists. This period of Dutch influence was short-lived.\n\nA turning point arrived in February 1649 with the Portuguese victory at the Second Battle of Guararapes, the decisive battle in a conflict called the Insurrection of Pernambuco, between Dutch and Portuguese forces at Jaboatão dos Guararapes in Pernambuco. This significant defeat pushed the Dutch towards surrender, which they formalized in a provisional pact on 26 January 1654. However, the Dutch Republic soon made demands for the return of their captured territory, leading to a lengthy period of negotiation. Ultimately, through the Treaty of The Hague signed in 1661, New Holland (the Dutch-controlled territory) was officially ceded back to Portugal.\n\nAlthough the Dutch presence in Brazil was temporary, its impact was substantial. The conflict between the two European powers disrupted Brazil’s sugar production, impacting its position as a leading exporter of the commodity. Additionally, competition from Dutch planters in the Caribbean further exacerbated the decline of the Brazilian sugar industry. The war between Spain and the Netherlands, common trends in economic cycles, and cultural developments all played a role (Edel, M. (1969). The Brazilian Sugar Cycle of the Seventeenth Century and the Rise of West Indian Competition. Caribbean Studies, 9(1), 24–44). While the Dutch occupation of Brazil was relatively brief, it left a lasting mark on the country’s history, contributing to the decline of its crucial sugar industry and shaping its colonial landscape.\n\nState of Brazil\n\nThe state was created on 13 June 1621 by Philip II of Portugal. It divided Portuguese America into two administrative units, with the capital of the State of Brazil located in São Salvador and the capital of the State of Maranhão located in São Luís. The State of Brazil became a Viceroyalty in January 1763, when the capital of the State of Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro (Klooster W. Brazil, Portugal, and Africa. In: The Cambridge History of the Age of Atlantic Revolutions. The Cambridge History of the Age of the Atlantic Revolutions. Cambridge University Press; 2023:427-588).\n\nKingdom of Brazil\n\nThe history of Brazil is marked by a brief yet significant period of autonomy known as the Kingdom of Brazil. It was formed in 1815, following the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil during the Napoleonic invasions of Portugal, and it continued to exist for about one year after the court’s return to Europe.\n\nOn 27-29 November 1807, just days before Napoleonic forces invaded Portugal on 1 December 1807 (largely to tighten the European blockade of Great Britain), Queen Maria I of Portugal, Prince Regent John, the Braganza royal family, and other court officials, totalling nearly 10.000 people, transferred from Lisbon to Brazil. They arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 7 March 1808.\n\nNapoleon’s defeat in 1815 sparked discussions about the future of the Portuguese monarchy. While the Prince Regent, enjoying life in Rio de Janeiro’s more welcoming political climate, resisted returning to Lisbon, tensions grew. Politicians in Portugal wanted the court’s return and wanted the status of Brazil to officially be reduced to a “Principality of Brazil”, clinging to the traditional view of Brazil as a mere colony unfit to be the seat of power. However, Brazilian elites harboured opposing aspirations. Leading courtiers desired an elevation in status, seeking recognition as equals within Portugal. Nationalists, on the other hand, saw the move as a symbolic step towards independence; a sign that Brazil was no longer simply an appendage to Portugal’s interests.\n\nThe Kingdom of Brazil was created on 16 December 1815 by a law issued by Prince Regent John of Portugal, Prince of Brazil, Duke of Braganza, in the name of his mother, Queen Maria I of Portugal, as part of the larger United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, a single state consisting of three kingdoms.\n\nThe Portuguese crown remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820 (Portuguese: Revolução Liberal) led to the return of John VI to Portugal on 26 April 1821. The revolution initiated a constitutional period in which the 1822 Constitution was ratified and implemented. Just before he departed from Brazil to Portugal, King John VI appointed his firstborn son and heir, Prince Pedro of Braganza, the Prince Royal of the United Kingdom, by a decree issued on 22 April 1821 as Prince Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil. The decree delegated powers to discharge the general government and the entire administration of the Kingdom of Brazil. In 1822, Pedro I, son of John VI, declared the Kingdom of Brazil independent from Portugal. He was then acclaimed as the first emperor of Brazil in October of that same year.\n\nEmpire of Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian Empire, unlike many of its Hispanic-American counterparts, was marked by relative stability, economic growth, and guaranteed civil liberties – albeit with limitations. While freedom of speech and some civil rights existed, women and enslaved people faced significant restrictions. The latter were viewed not as citizens, but as property.\n\nThe Empire had parliament elected through a process considered relatively democratic for the time. However, this system also led to political conflicts between Emperor Pedro I and parliament concerning the monarch’s role in government.\n\nDespite these internal struggles, the Empire achieved several noteworthy successes. Under Pedro II, the economy flourished, attracting European immigrants like Protestants and Jews, while Brazil remained predominantly Catholic. The nation emerged as an international power, securing victories in the Platine War, the Uruguayan War, and the Paraguayan War. Additionally, slavery, initially widespread, was gradually restricted by successive legislation, culminating in its complete abolishment in 1888. Brazilian art, literature, and theater thrived during this period, exhibiting European influences while simultaneously forging a distinct national identity.\n\nHowever, the path to success was not without its challenges. The early years were marked by instability and regional civil wars due to internal power struggles. The Cisplatine War resulted in the secession of the Cisplatina province, later to become Uruguay. Moreover, the lack of a clear heir after Pedro II contributed to a decline in public support for the monarchy.\n\nDespite its achievements, the Empire ultimately collapsed in a bloodless coup d’état in 1889. This sudden end can be attributed to several factors, including Emperor Pedro II’s disinterest in securing the monarchy’s future beyond his lifetime, the ruling class’s aversion to a female monarch (Pedro II’s daughter, Isabel), and the absence of a viable successor to lead the Empire after Pedro II.\n\nSuccession\n\nToday, the family continues to pursue its dynastic and cultural heritage. Claimants to the defunct throne originate from Emperor Pedro II, with two branches of the House of Orléans-Braganza vying for leadership: the Petrópolis Line and the Vassouras Line.\n\nGenealogy\n\nI. Dom Pedro I of Brazil (1798-1834); reigned 1822–1831; was also King of Portugal in 1826, as Pedro IV.\n\nThe first decades of independence were difficult though not as chaotic as in Latin America’s Spanish-speaking republics. Brazil underwent a series of regional revolts, some of which resulted in thousands of deaths, but the national economy remained strong and the central government largely intact. The emperor was impulsive, however, and made generally despotic and arbitrary decisions. In 1823 he dissolved the constituent assembly, which he regarded as unruly and radical, and sent Andrada e Silva and his two brothers into exile. However, the emperor and his Council of State subsequently wrote a constitution that was liberal and advanced for its time, although it strengthened the hand of emperor. The municipal councils debated and approved the document; Pedro promulgated it in 1824, and it proved versatile enough to last throughout the imperial period. The constitution helped centralize the government by granting the emperor power to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies, select members of the Senate, and appoint and dismiss ministers of state. Pedro I’s popularity declined thereafter because he lost Brazil’s Cisplatine province (now the republic of Uruguay) following a costly war with Argentina (1825–28), appointed few mazombos (Brazilian Creoles) to high office, overly preoccupied himself with Portuguese affairs, failed to get along with the legislature, and signed treaties with Great Britain that kept import duties low and exacted a promise to abolish the slave trade. As a result, Pedro formally abdicated on April 7, 1831, in favour of his five-year-old son, Dom Pedro de Alcântara (later Pedro II).\n\nSource: Britannica\n\nII. Dom Pedro II of Brazil (1825-1891); regency 1831–1840; reigned personally 1840–1889.\n\nBrazil had progressed considerably under Pedro II’s wise guidance. Its population grew from 4,000,000 to 14,000,000, its public revenues increased 14-fold, the value of its exports rose 10-fold, and the nation’s newly constructed railroads extended more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km). Immigration also increased, with more than 100,000 entering Brazil in 1889 alone. Yet people were generally dissatisfied.\n\nMany historians have ascribed the fall of the monarchy to a restive military, a brooding landed aristocracy, and a resentful clergy. Indeed, those three powerful groups were increasingly critical of the emperor. Perhaps more pertinent, however, was the stress placed on the traditional social structure in the late 19th century, owing to a widening gulf between the elites in the neo-feudal countryside and the more progressive urban residents and coffee planters. Members of the urban middle class, the military, and the coffee planters believed that the monarchy represented the past and was too closely tied to the landed elite. They reasoned that a republic better suited the goals of Brazil’s emerging capitalist system, which increasingly was based on coffee and industrial production. A civil-military conspiracy formed, and military officers carried out a coup on November 15, 1889. Pedro II abdicated and went into exile in Europe. The abolition of slavery in 1888 and the overthrow of the monarchy in 1889 terminated the two major institutions that had shaped Brazil’s past; in so doing they initiated a period of social, economic, and political change that accelerated modernization. Accordingly, the period between 1888 and 1922 has been described as the emergence of a “new Brazil.”\n\nSource: Britanica.com\n\nIII. Isabel of Brazil (1846-1921). Princess Imperial and former regent of Brazil during the absence of her father. She was the elder daughter of Pedro II. Dona Isabel, also known as “the Redemptress,” was a significant figure in Brazilian history. Born in 1846, she became the heir presumptive to the throne of the Brazilian Empire after the deaths of her two brothers. Isabel married Gaston, Count of Eu, in an arranged marriage and had three sons with him. During her father’s absences abroad, she served as regent, presiding over the Empire in his stead. However, her most significant act came during her third regency in 1888. Isabel actively championed the abolition of slavery in Brazil and ultimately signed the Lei Áurea (Golden Law), officially emancipating all enslaved people in the country. While this act was widely popular among the general public, it generated significant opposition from powerful landowners who relied on slave labor. Despite her popularity as The Redemptress, Isabel faced criticism for her gender, strong Catholic faith, and marriage to a foreigner. These factors, coupled with the economic anxieties of some over the abolition of slavery, contributed to the downfall of the monarchy. In 1889, a military coup d’état, headed by a dictator, deposed her father and the entire imperial family, forcing Isabel and her family into exile in France, where she lived the remaining 30 years of her life.\n\nIVa. (Petrópolis line) Prince Pedro de Alcântara of Orléans-Braganza, Prince of Grão Pará (1875 – 1940), was the first-born son of Dona Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, and Prince Gaston of Orléans, Count of Eu. As his grandfather ruled, he was second in line to become emperor. However, this changed dramatically in 1889 when a coup d’état ended the Brazilian monarchy. Dom Pedro de Alcântara, then just 14, went into exile in Europe with his mother, and grew up largely in France, at a family apartment in Boulogne-sur-Seine, and at his father’s castle, the Château d’Eu in Normandy. In 1908, Dom Pedro de Alcântara, heir to the Brazilian throne, found himself in a difficult situation. He wished to marry Countess Elisabeth Dobržensky de Dobrženicz. Although she was a member of the Bohemian higher nobility, she was not of royal birth. While the Brazilian constitution allowed such a marriage, tradition held strong. Dom Pedro’s mother, the head of the Imperial Family, disapproved and withheld her blessing unless he gave up his claim to the throne. Faced with a choice between love and duty, Dom Pedro chose love. On October 30, 1908, at the age of 33, he renounced his succession rights, paving the way for his marriage, on 14 November 1908 at Versailles.\n\nPrince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza (1913-2007) was born into exile, a consequence of the 1889 coup that ended the Brazilian Empire. His father, once heir presumptive, renounced his claim in 1908, but Pedro Gastão never accepted this decision. He actively pursued his claim to the throne for over 60 years, following his father’s death in 1940. Prince Pedro Gastão died in the early hours of 27 December 2007, at the age of 94, and was buried the following day, in the chapel of Villamanrique de la Condesa. He received a State funeral in the presence of Spanish royalty. In 1909, the members of the elder branch of the Imperial Family (the Orléans and Bragança) signed an agreement with the Head of Royal Family of France, at that time the Duke of Orléans (1869-1926), called the “family pact”. By this agreement, all of the members were incorporated in the French line of succession, being properly styled Royal Highness. Therefore, from that agreement, the titles of the members of the Imperial Family of Brazil changed as follows: (i) Prince Pedro Gastão (Head of the Dynasty and Prince of Brazil); Prince Pedro Carlos (Imperial Prince) and Prince Pedro Thiago of Orleans and Bragança (Prince of Grand-Pará), Imperial and Royal Highness; (ii) other princes of the eldest branch, princes of Orléans and Bragança styled Royal Highness; (iii) members of the junior branch hold the title Prince of Saxe-Coburgo Bragança with the style Highness (Royalty Digest, Quarterly 3, 2006, p. 40).\n\nPrince Pedro Carlos of Orléans-Braganza (1945 -), eldest son of Dom Pedro Gastão. Dom Pedro Carlos, a retired forest engineer, dedicates his time to two distinct but intertwined passions: preserving the historical and cultural heritage of the Brazilian monarchy and managing the Petrópolis Real Estate Company, a family-owned venture he helms alongside his siblings. As the owner of the Palace of Grão-Pará, he holds the distinction of being the last royal descendant residing in a former royal palace on the entire American continent. This residence serves as a tangible link to the past while highlighting Pedro Carlos’ personal commitment to the preservation of his family’s legacy. While Pedro Carlos does not actively pursue a formal restoration of the monarchy, he remains deeply connected to its past and dedicated to ensuring its cultural and historical memory is preserved. Heir: Prince Pedro Tiago (1979-).\n\nIVb (Vassouras line) Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza (1878–1920). In 1908, after his elder brother relinquished his claim to the throne, Dom Luís became heir apparent to his mother, Princess Isabel, actively working with Brazilian monarchists in their unsuccessful attempts to restore the monarchy. During World War I, he served as an officer in the British Armed Forces, seeing combat in Flanders. However, he contracted a severe form of rheumatism that ultimately led to his death at the age of 42. His commitment to the Allied cause earned him decorations from Belgium, France, and Great Britain.\n\nPedro Henrique of Orléans-Braganza (1909–1981); grandson of Princess Isabel, son and heir of her second son, Prince Luís of Orléans-Braganza (1878–1920). Upon the death of his father in 1920, Dom Pedro Henrique became claimant to the title of Prince Imperial, but on 14 November 1921, Princess Isabel died at the Castle d’Eu. Therefore, at the age of 12, Dom Pedro Henrique became the head of the Vassouras line of the imperial family.\n\nLuiz of Orléans-Braganza (1938-2022); claimant 1981–2022; the eldest son of Prince Pedro Henrique. At his death, President Jair Bolsonaro decreed official mourning throughout the country (source: EuropeanConservative). Dom Luiz was succeeded as the Head of the Vassouras line by his brother, Prince Bertrand (see below).\n\nBertrand of Orléans-Braganza (1941-) claimant 2022–present, third son of Prince Pedro Henrique. Heir: Prince Antônio of Orléans-Braganza (born in 1950).\n\nLegitimate heir\n\nThe root of the split between the two branches is a 1908 declaration by Prince Pedro de Alcântara of Orléans-Braganza (1875-1940):\n\nI, Prince Pedro de Alcântara Luiz Filipe Maria Gastão Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga of Orleans-Braganza, having maturely reflected, have resolved to renounce the right that, by the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, promulgated on 25 March 1824, accords to me the Crown of that nation. I declare, therefore, that by my free and spontaneous will I hereby renounce, in my own name, as well as for any and all of my descendants, to all and any rights that the aforesaid Constitution confers upon us to the Brazilian Crown and Throne, which shall pass to the lines which follow mine, conforming to the order of succession as established by article 117. Before God I promise, for myself and my descendants, to hold to the present declaration. Cannes 30 October 1908 signed: Pedro de Alcântara of Orleans-Braganza\n\nMontjouvent, P. de (1998). Le comte de Paris et sa Descendance. Charenton: Éditions du Chaney. p. 97.\n\nI agree with the expert opinions of jurists like Professor Francisco Morato and Paulo Napoleão Nogueira da Silva, that the declaration does not have legal effect (Bodstein, A.B. The Imperial Family of Brazil. In: Royalty Digest Quarterly, no. 3 -2006; Parecer sobre a Renúncia do Príncipe Dom Pedro d’Alcântara); simply because Dom Pedro waived “rights” (his “rights” to the defunct throne of Brazil) which do not exist in law. A discussion about the so-called de jure situation is meaningless because Brazilian law does not attribute any meaning (value or worthlessness) to such transfer. As an alternative, a cultural-historical approach serves as a neutral framework to determine the heir to the Imperial House. Historically, the Constitution of 1824 was the guideline that applied in this matter and therefore serves as a solid foundation for this approach.\n\nThe 1908 declaration certainly is significant because it was an attempt to transfer the headship of the Imperial House to another branch of the family. However, despite its significance, it cannot be said the declaration provides enough substance to transfer the headship of the Imperial House to a younger branch of the family because the declaration was a clear breach of art. 115 of the Constitution of 1824, which states that the former palaces and lands of Pedro I follow his successor.\n\nArt. 115. The palaces and national lands now belonging to Sr. D. Pedro I, shall always belong to his successors; and the nation will care for the acquisitions and constructions that may be thought appropriate for the dignity and recreation of the Emperor and his family.\n\nPolitical Constitution of the Empire of Brazil (Portuguese: Constituição Política do Império do Brasil) commonly referred to as the Constitution of 1824. Brazil’s first constitution, issued on 25 March 1824 subsequently amended with the enactment of the Additional Act of 1834, and the Law of Interpretation of 1840, and revoked on 24 February 1891.\n\nDom Pedro Carlos owns the Grão-Pará Palace and the D. Isabel Palace, both in Petrópolis, which were returned to his grandfather, Dom Pedro de Alcântara, by the republican government. In line with former art. 115, he therefore is the de facto successor to the historical and cultural heritage of the former Imperial House.\n\nApart from the transfer by the government of the House’s cultural-historical heritage to Dom Pedro Carlos, superfluously it should be noted that the 1908 declaration was in conflict with the succession rules, as art. 117 stipulates succession via primogeniture:\n\nArt. 117. His legitimate offspring shall succeed to the throne according to the regular order of primogeniture and representation, preferring always the anterior line to the posterior lines; in the same line the nearer degree to the more remote ones; in the same degree the male sex to the female; in the same sex the older to the younger person.\n\nPolitical Constitution of the Empire of Brazil (Portuguese: Constituição Política do Império do Brasil) commonly referred to as the Constitution of 1824. Brazil’s first constitution, issued on 25 March 1824 subsequently amended with the enactment of the Additional Act of 1834, and the Law of Interpretation of 1840, and revoked on 24 February 1891.\n\nEthical perspective\n\nApart from the aforementioned cultural-historical perspective, there is also a serious ethical aspect to be considered. The declaration was made under psychological pressure: Dom Pedro’s mother refused her blessing to the marriage if he would not renunciate (see: letter from Dona Isabel of 9 November 1908 [Castle of Eu] to her monarchist followers). It caused Dom Pedro to commit an act that he would otherwise not commit.\n\nFurthermore, there are strong reasons to conclude Dom Bertrand would have been disqualified on moral grounds under Art. 126 of the Political Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, which governed the imperial succession. Dom Bertrand is known as a religious fanatic who is against the demarcation of indigenous territory in Brazil. He is also a climate change denialist and has published a book entitled “Psicose Ambientalista” (“Environmentalist Psychosis”), denouncing what he calls the hoaxes created by radical environmentalists and by eco-terrorists (source: BBC News Brasil in São Paulo, 4 April 2019. João Fellet, Monarchists occupy positions in Brasília and rehabilitate ultraconservative Catholic group). Dom Bertand’s views are so offensive, out of touch, and immoral that he is unfit to lead the Imperial House of Brazil. In the days of the empire, a special provision was in place in such circumstances, disqualifying the position of the emperor, which – from an ethical point of view – should analogously be applied to the claims of Dom Bertrand:\n\nArt. 126. If the Emperor, from physical or moral cause, evidently recognized by the plurality of each of the chambers of the Assembly, should become unfit to govern, the Imperial Prince, if he be more than eighteen years of age, shall govern in his stead as regent.\n\nPolitical Constitution of the Empire of Brazil (Portuguese: Constituição Política do Império do Brasil) commonly referred to as the Constitution of 1824. Brazil’s first constitution, issued on 25 March 1824 subsequently amended with the enactment of the Additional Act of 1834, and the Law of Interpretation of 1840, and revoked on 24 February 1891.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn tradition with the legal structure of the former empire, the only legitimate heir to the dynastic rights of the Imperial Family of Brazil is Dom Pedro Carlos, Prince of Brazil, Prince of Grão-Pará, born on 31 October 1945. Dom Bertrand’s claims conflict with this legal structure in various ways and should be rejected.\n\nLiterature\n\nPaulo Napoleão Nogueira da Silva, “Parecer sobre a renúncia do príncipe Dom Pedro de Alcântara” in Monarquia: verdades e monteras , São Paulo, Edições GRD, 1994, p. 337-369.\n\nArtidoro Xavier Pinheiro, Organização das Ordens Honoríficas do Império do Brasil – São.

Manuel, left a remarkable account of the first Mass ever offered in the land known today as Brazil. Fr. Henrique de Coimbra, who had arrived with Portuguese explorers, celebrated this Mass on 26 April 1500. Below is a translation of the main parts of the account. The original Portuguese can be read here:\n\nOne of them saw some white rosary beads; he waved to be given them, took great delight in them, and threw them around his neck. Then he took them off and wrapped them around his arm and waved to the earth and back to the beads and the Captain’s necklace, as if saying they would give gold for it. (…)\n\nWhen we got off the barge, the Captain said that we should go straight to the Cross, which was leaning against a tree by the river, to be erected tomorrow, which is Friday, and that we should all get down on our knees and kiss it so that they would see how much we respected it. And so we did. The ten or twelve who were there waved to the Cross, and they all went right away to kiss it. They seem to me to be people of such innocence that, if a man understood them and they understood us, they would immediately be Christians, because they, it seems, have no belief, nor do they understand any belief. (…)\n\nWhile they were doing it, he and all of us went down to the Cross below the river, where it was. From there, we brought it with those religious and priests in front of us, singing, in procession-like fashion. Some of them were already there, seventy or eighty; and when they saw us coming, some came under it to help us. We crossed the river, along the beach, and put the Cross where it was to stay, which would be the work of two crossbow shots. A hundred and fifty or more came along.\n\nOnce the Cross was erected, with the arms and motto of Your Highness were nailed to it, they set up an altar near it. There the friar Father Henry said Mass, which was sung and officiated by the aforementioned. There were fifty or sixty of them with us, all sitting on their knees, just like us.\n\nAnd when it came to the Gospel and we all stood up, with raised hands, they then stood up with us and raised their hands, and stayed like that, until it was finished; and then they sat down again like us. And when they lifted up God [the elevation of the Mass?] and we knelt down, they all stood like this, as we stood with our hands raised, and in such a quiet way, that, I certify to Your Highness, it made us very devout. They stayed like that with us until communion was over, after which those religious and priests and the Captain received communion with some of us others.\n\nSome of them, because the sun was intense, when we were receiving communion, got up, and others stood and stayed. One of them, a man of about fifty or fifty-five, stayed with those who stayed. This man, as we were thus gathered together, gathered those who remained, and called for others. And walking thus among them speaking, he waved his finger toward the altar and then pointed his finger toward heaven, as if to say something good to them; and we took the meaning of it.\n\nWhen the Mass was over, the priest took off his vestments and stayed at the altar, sitting on a chair. There he preached to us from the Gospel and the Apostles, whose day it is today, treating, at the end of the preaching, of this your so holy and virtuous continuance, which increased our devotion.\n\nThose who were at the preaching stood like us, looking at him. And he called for some to come there. Some came and some went. And when the preaching was over, as Nicolau Coelho had brought many pewter crosses with crucifixes, which he had left from his other visit, they decided that each one should wear his own around his neck. Father Henry sat down at the foot of the Cross, and there he fastened crosses on the people, one by one, tied by a thread around the neck, first making them kiss the cross.”\n\nPeter Kwasniewski, Account of the First Mass in Brazil in the year 1500 in: New Liturgical Movement. 9 August 2021."
