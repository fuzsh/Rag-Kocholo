He reigned for 59 years and 8 months, only one year less than Pedro II, his great-grandfather to whom he is often compared.\n\nPedro III ascended the throne at age 12 in 1921 and was aided in his early years by a group called \"the Second Regency\" until he turned 18 in 1927, another parallel to Pedro II's life.

They had twelve children:"
