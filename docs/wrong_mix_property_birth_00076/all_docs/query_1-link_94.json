        "text": "This collection contains thirteen letters written by the Duke of Wellington to Miss A.M. (Anna Maria) Jenkins, a 19th century evangelist. Two other letters are from Ms. Sophy Mistes to Miss A.M. Jenkins also. Accompanying some of the letters are envelopes with wax seals; also included in the collection are a miniature photo of the Duke and a paper Mariner's Compass.\n\nArthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was a very famous military and political figure in the 19th century. He gained notoriety for defeating Napoleon Bonaparte at Waterloo as well as through his post as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. The Duke of Wellington had an extensive military career in which he fought in many battles; furthermore, he served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for two terms. The Duke became involved with Miss Anna Maria Jenkins, a young female evangelist, for several years - the progression of their relationship is reflected in the Duke's letters to Miss Jenkins. The two corresponded from 1833 until the Duke's death in 1852."
