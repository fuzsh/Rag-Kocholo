        "text": "The First West India Company can also be considered to some extent the less studied sister cooperation of the East India Company, her Pacific counterpart that was founded in 1602 to unify trade and thus obtain the commercial monopoly in Asia. This same mission relied on the WIC in 1621, experimenting with remarkable highs and lows. My objective is to study these first +/- 50 years, until the bankruptcy of 1674, approaching them from the following previously devised questions: 1) How did the Habsburg Dynasty affect the development of Dutch commerce? What do we see in the Atlantic world after the creation of the Dutch West India Company? 2) How the United Provinces developed and what framework gave birth to the creation of this new company. 3) What were the prime differences between the North and the South Atlantic, and how did the loss of Dutch Brazil influence the Caribbean.\n\nThe seventeenth century was the Golden Age of the Netherlands, or the Republic of the (Seven) United Provinces as it was then called. The Dutch were on the cutting edge of academia, art, science, engineering and defence and were well-known for their world-wide trading in the Levant, the Baltic, Africa, Asia (known as the East Indies), the Caribbean and the Americas (together known as the West Indies). One of the most remarkable of organisations created in the United Provinces was the Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC), the Dutch East India Company. It created a territorial legacy in Asia that would last until the middle of the twentieth century, a hundred and fifty years after its disappearance, and has become one of the symbols of Dutch entrepreneurial spirit and empire. This essay will analyse the creation, overseas evolution and the decline of the VOC as well as explain its territorial legacy to the Netherlands."
