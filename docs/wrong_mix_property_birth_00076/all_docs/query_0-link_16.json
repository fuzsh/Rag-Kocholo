Also in the cast was Frank Wyatt (1852-1926), whom she married at the fashionable St Georgeâs, Hanover Square in 1886. (Wyatt is best known as the creator of the role of the Duke of Plaza-Toro in the Gilbert & Sullivan opera The Gondoliers.) They built the Trafalgar Square Theatre, the first theatre on St Martinâs Lane, London, in 1892, renaming it the Duke of Yorkâs three years later.

In 1789 he was given Fr300,000 to create a maritime library, for which he bought books and instruments in England and France. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in London in 1793 and eventually decided to settle in England, marrying an Englishwoman in 1799 and resigning his naval commission in 1800. His published works, funded by the Admiralty, Trinity House and the East India Company, had a profound effect on maritime navigation. In 1814 the Board of Longitude awarded him Â£1,200 for his longitude tables. Suffering from a debilitating illness, exacerbated by his exersions, and according to one account having discovered a serious error in one of his tables, he hanged himself at his house in Brighton1.
