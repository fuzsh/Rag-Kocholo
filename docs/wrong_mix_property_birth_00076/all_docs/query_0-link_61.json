We visited the house the other day, and can now give the rate payers a little information of which almost all, we believe, are ignorant. We have found that since the first of January last the following articles of clothing have been made in the workhouse, viz:-\n\nWomen’s Petticoats………………..524\n\nWomen’s Gowns……………………299\n\nWomen’s Chemises………………..827\n\nWomen’s Caps……………………..551\n\nGirls’ Frocks…………………………398\n\nGirls’ Chemises…………………….. 803\n\nGirls’ Petticoats………………………265\n\nMen’s Trousers……………………… 27\n\nMen’s Shirts…………………………..340\n\nBoys’ Suits…………………………….107\n\nBoys’ Shirts……………………………256\n\nBesides these many more articles of clothing are in course of being made, and a large quantity of material is in course of delivery which has been a long time ordered. Two hundred pairs of blankets, two hundred rugs, and one hundred and fifty bed-ticks have also been purchased since the first of January. One hundred stones of wool are contracted for, and in a day or two four or five hundred wheels will be at work spinning this and flax. Two hundred wheels and six looms are ready to commence work; so that in a short time it is expected, the greater portion of clothing required can be manufactured in the house from the raw material. These facts speak for themselves and form an indisputable proof of the very effective exertions of the present board of guardians under the difficulties against which they had to contend.\n\nFrom Tipperary Free Press; The Tralee Guardians have applied to the Poor Law Commissioners for 10,000l. to pay off the creditors of that union, by whom they complain of being insulted and threatened.\n\nThe magistrates of Tralee have taken informations of Thomas Cantillon against his nephew of the same name, for robbing him of £120 on his sick bed; after Cantillon, who then believed he was dying, had given Father M’Carthy £100, to say masses for him.\n\nFrom Limerick Chronicle;\n\nOn Wednesday a meeting of the medical practitioners of the county of Clare was held at the board room of the County Infirmary, Ennis, at which Dr. O’Brien, County Surgeon, presided. A petition to Parliament was adopted by the meeting, praying for more satisfactory legislation for their more efficient supervision. It was recommended that Hospitals and Dispensaries should not be made dependent for their support upon voluntary subscriptions.\n\nhttp://www.irelandoldnews.com/Mayo/1850/MAR.html\n\nBALLINA CHRONICLE\n\nWednesday, March 13, 1850\n\nAt Limerick Market last week 292 load of potatoes, selling at 6d. to 7d. per stone, and the largest supply of any week this year. – Half the quantity was bought up for spring sowing.\n\nPOTATO PLANTING\n\nThe preparations which are making in every part of this portion of the province are on a scale far more extensive than on any former year within our recollection. Cattle are sold and even several articles of household furniture and wearing apparel at tremendous sacrifice by the poor landholders to purchase seed potatoes. The chief cause of this is obvious, and it affords a practical proof of the ruinous policy of Free Trade in this country. The small farmers, who allowed themselves to be led into the conviction that “Protection,” was a curse by those who hated the aristocracy and exulted in anything that might injure the landed proprietors are now sadly convinced that the export trade of Ireland is ruined – that there is no longer a market for any description of grain. The potato always found a ready market at home and remunerated the grower, so much so that £5 or £6 was willingly given for what was called con-acre. Potatoes are even now fetching a higher price though they are by no means scarce and have to compete with Indian meal.\n\n(Break)\n\nMr. Denis Brennan’s proposal to transmit to Canada 150 paupers from Cork, finding provisions, &c. according to the passengers act, for adults, £3 5s. each; under 14 years of age, £1 12s., and infants free, has been accepted by the Cork guardians.\n\nDr. Petrie has presented to the Royal Irish Academy the crooked head of the “bachal” or pastoral staff of St. Feeben, who died in 664.5 according to annals of Clonmacnoise; also the crozier or staff of St. Brerach, founder of the seven Churches of Termonbarry, Roscommon.\n\nThere was no breach of the peace or disturbance in any part of Ulster on St. Patrick’s day.\n\nIn March, 1849, there were 14,367 persons receiving in door and outdoor relief in the Limerick Union, at a weekly expenditure of £698, and in March, 1850, the number is reducted to 7,700, at a cost of £380 weekly including hospital attendance, &c. This is an agreeable contract.\n\nEmigration is amazingly on the increase, not, however, so much to Canada as to the United States, and the train from Limerick to Dublin is daily crowded with intending emigrants, mostly all agricultural, and who embark for their destination at Liverpool. The banks in Limerick are hourly paying out money upon the orders remitted by the friends of those people in America, who emigrated the last and preceding years. There are nine vessels at the quays taking passengers- three for New York and six for Quebec.\n\nBAD COMPANY! – John Fogarty was hanged last August at the county gaol for the murder of his neighbour, Daniel Dillon, in Cappamore, at the instigation of Dillon’s wife, also executed at the same time. Now it is a remarkable illustration of the old adage, that Mathew and William Gavan, brothers, and very young men, under sentence this assizes for the murder of John Ryan, also at Cappamore, were next door neighbours of that same John Fogarty, who died an ignominious death on the scaffold last year–Limerick Chronicle.\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL\n\nGalway, Monday, March 8, 1824\n\nIn 1487, a dreadful war was carried on in Ulster, between the Chieftain\n\nO’Neal and the neighbouring Chieftain Tyrconnell. This war had nothing more\n\nconsiderable for its immediate cause, than the pride of O’Neal who demanded that\n\nhis enemy should recognize his authority, by paying tribute. The laconic style\n\nin which it was made and rejected would not have disgraced a nobler contest:-\n\n“Send me tribute, or else-”\n\nwas the message of O’Neal. To which was returned, with the same princely\n\nbrevity,\n\n“I owe you none, and if-”\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL\n\nGalway, Thursday, March 11, 1824\n\nMarriage; In Limerick, Mr. William Joynt, to Arabella, daughter of the late Doctor\n\nLane.\n\nMAGDALEN ASYLUM\n\nWe feel gratified in announcing to the public of Galway the grant of 100l.\n\nBritish, made by the benevolent London Tavern Committee, to be applied for the\n\nMagdalen Asylum. This grant was made on the application of the Rev. Peter Daly;\n\nbut we are desired to say, and we do so with pleasure, that it was chiefly\n\neffected through the humane and earnest exertions and representations of William\n\nH. Hyatt, Esq. the late Agent of the Committee to this Country.\n\nSERMON ON ST. PATRICK’S DAY\n\nWe understand the Rev. Joseph Kirwan is to preach the Panegyric, in the\n\nParochial Chapel of St. Nicholas, on the above most interesting occasion. It is\n\nin vain to say that this is an exhausted subject. The longer we live, and the\n\nmore anniversaries we behold, the more pregnant do we find them with matters of\n\nimportance.\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL\n\nGalway, Monday, March 15, 1824\n\nPROVINCIAL NEWS (From the Limerick Chronicle)\n\nThe only case of importance in the Criminal Court was the trial of a man of\n\nthe name of Rickards, who was tried for administering the oaths of a Ribbonman,\n\nand convicted on the clearest testimony. The Secrets of the Society were, upon\n\nthe trial, fully disclosed, and their objects exhibited to public view, which\n\nwere to effect a separation between this Country and Great Britain, and a\n\ngeneral assassination of the Protestants of Ireland.\n\nThe Chief Justice, when passing sentence (which was transportation for\n\nlife) delivered a most beautiful and impressive exhortation to the prisoner.- He\n\nreverted to the scenes of bloodshed in the year 1798, the effects of which he\n\nsaid, left many a woman a widow, and many a child as an orphan.- He pointed out\n\nthe madness of the attempt to separate the countries that were held together by\n\nfirm and constitutional ties, and which were governed by the best laws which any\n\nnation upon the earth was blessed with. Laws, as he said, that the prisoner\n\nhimself was then enjoying the benefits of, for until a very few years ago, had\n\nhe been convicted of the same crime, that offense which was now only accompanied\n\nwith transportation, would have been stoned for at the gallows.\n\nHIGH SHERIFFS-1824\n\n[From the Dublin Gazette of Saturday] Dublin, Castle, March 5, 1824.\n\nKERRY…….Richard M’Gillycuddy, of Whitefield, Esq.\n\nLIMERICK……….Joseph Gubbins, of Kilrush, Esq.\n\nOne of the alleged murderers of the late Major Going will be tried at the\n\npresent Assizes of Limerick.- His name is Bridgman.\n\nhttp://www.irelandoldnews.com/Galway/1824/MAR.html\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL\n\nGalway, Thursday, March 18, 1824\n\nST. PATRICK’S DAY\n\n[From the Irishman]\n\nWe do not believe the memory of our Patron Saint was ever more honoured in\n\nthe town of Belfast than it was on Wednesday last. Parties of 12,20,30 and 40\n\nmet to celebrate the christian labours of our Irish Saint. A large and highly\n\nrespectable party, containing about 40 persons, dined at Falloon’s Tavern, in\n\nSugar-house entry. The chair was filled on this occasion by James M’Clean, Esq.-\n\nVice President, John Lawless, Esq. It was a night of harmony, good humour, and\n\ngood sense; all appeared anxious to please and be pleased. Some excellent Songs\n\nwere spirited among the speeches, which were delivered, and the talents of our\n\nBelfast Harper, (the first, by far, in Ireland,) crowned the feast. The dinner\n\nwas admirably served up by Mrs., Falloon. The following toasts were given\n\nalternately by the President and Vice-President:-\n\n“The Memory of St. Patrick.”\n\n“The King-may the unequalled hospitality be enjoyed in Ireland encouraged\n\nhis Majesty to revisit her shores.”\n\n“The People-the only legitimate source of Royal authority.”\n\n“Civil and Religious Freedom to all men of all climes and denominations.”\n\n“The British Constitution, and a speedy reform of the abuses which now\n\nobscure its beauty.”\n\n“May the spirit of liberality which characterises the present Ministers of\n\nthe British Empire, with regard to Commerce, Trade and Manufactures, soon infuse\n\nitself into their Political & Religious opinions.”\n\n“The Friends of Freedom in Spain-may they soon resume the station they\n\ndeserve in their native land.”\n\n“The People of Greece-may their great name be once more restored to the\n\nworld they have so long illuminated.”\n\n“The Belfast Academical Institution, the offspring of public spirit, and\n\nmay its Proprietors never forget the duty they owe to the object for which it\n\nwas founded.”\n\n“The United States of America-the unanswerable proof to mankind that their\n\npeace and happiness are ever best secured by the participation of equal rights\n\nand privileges.”\n\n“The Institutions of Belfast-may they ever be as they now are, directed and\n\ncontrolled by the voice of the people.”\n\n“The Reformers of England and Scotland, and may their ranks be shortly\n\nenforced by the accession of Ireland.”\n\n“The Memory of William Drennan-the unbending and eloquent advocate of the\n\nRights of Man.”\n\n“The Marquis of Donegall, and the Nobility of Ireland, who make their native\n\nland their constant abode.”\n\n“The Memory of John Hancock-the refuge of the oppressed, no matter what\n\ntheir Country or their Religion.”\n\n“A Free Press- the poor man’s protection-the Tyrant’s terror.”\n\n“The Memory of Charles James Fox, the wisest and most benevolent Statesman\n\nEngland ever boasted of.”\n\n“The President of the United States, James Monroe-may the Country over\n\nwhich he presides for ever be the terror of the Tyrants of Europe.”\n\n“The memories of Grattan, and Curran, and Ponsonby, the eloquent and\n\nuncorrupted advocaters of Ireland’s Freedom.”\n\n“Charles Sugrue, Esq., and the Chamber of Commerce of Cork.”\n\n“The Independent Citizens of Galway.”\n\n“Doctor Tennent.”\n\n“The Stewards who regulated the present celebration of St. Patrick.”\n\nAll the corn tillage in the South of Ireland looks remarkably well.\n\nTwo steam boats are now in forwardness to ply between Limerick and Dublin,\n\nby Canal and from thence to Liverpool. The proprietors will engage to deliver\n\ngoods, during summer in three days at Liverpool, and in winter, in four days\n\nfrom Dublin harbour.\n\nSteam trading vessels are about to be established between Dublin and\n\nGlasgow.\n\nThe Supberb steam packet is daily expected to ply from Cork to Lisbon and\n\nNaples; the fare twenty guineas to Lisbon and thirty-five guineas to Naples.\n\nA small vessel, between forty and fifty tons burthen, was seen to go down\n\nnear Blackwater, in the gale on Thursday morning. The violence of the gale was\n\nextreme, and no assistance could possibly be afforded. Unfortunately all the\n\npersons on board perished. Another vessel about the same size was seen in\n\ndistress the same morning off the Saltees, and it is supposed met the same\n\nfate.– Waterford Mail.\n\nLIBERALITY\n\nIt gives us pleasure to hear that Robert French, Esq. of Monivea Castle,\n\nour present High Sheriff for the County, has been kind enough to give a LEASE\n\nFOR EVER, of an Acre of Land to a Parish in his neighbourhood, as a site for a\n\nRoman Catholic Chapel about to be erected on it; and has also subscribed\n\nhandsomely towards the Funds of a School established on a liberal principle,\n\nunder the conduct of the Parish Priest and principal Parishioners.\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL\n\nGalway, Monday, March 22, 1824\n\nMEATH ASSIZES\n\nTRIAL OF A POLICEMAN FOR MURDER\n\nOn the third day of the Assizes of Trim, Geo.

Baron\n\nM’Clelland, b some gentlemen of the Grand Jury, respecting procession of\n\nRibbonmen, at Toome & Cushendall, on Patrick’s day. In consequence of this, the\n\nLearned Judge addressed the Grand Jury, and portrayed, in very impressive\n\nlanguage, the evils resulting from party spirit and party processions. In the\n\ncourse of his observations he remarked that on this subject he did not speak\n\ntheoretically, but from long experience in his judicial capacity. The mischiefs\n\nresulting from these processions, as evinced in other counties where he had gone\n\ncircuit, are recorded (said the Baron) in characters of blood\n\nRIBBONMEN-PROCESSIONS\n\n[From the Belfast News-Letter]\n\nIn our last number we gave a sthort account of a procession of Ribbonmen,\n\nwhich took place at Toome, on the 17th inst. (St. Patrick’s Day.) We have now to\n\nadd, that in various other places there were processions of a similar nature at\n\nthe same time. A correspondent informs us, that during the night of the 16th,\n\nand morning of the 17th, a body of Ribbonmen kept sounding horns through the\n\nstreets of Downpatrick. In the morning about 200 of them assembled on the\n\nCourse, about a mile from that town, into which they marched about 11 o’clock to\n\nthe music of fifes.\n\nJAMES KELLY,\n\nLand Surveyor,\n\nImpressed with a deep sense of gratitude for the Patronage he experienced\n\nin the County of Galway since he came there to reside in 1815, and offered\n\nhimself to the notice of the Nobility and Gentry of that County-From the general\n\nsatisfaction he has had the good fortune to give,\n\nwitness opened several letters; in one he\n\nfound 5l. in another 10l. in another 3l. in another 2l. in another 1l; Donnelly\n\ngot one-half the money, by agreement; recollects one letter directed to Robert\n\nMarshall, Ayr, which contained a 20l. Scotch Note, and a 1l. 1s.

MONSTROUS CASE OF MURDER.\n\nHonora Concannon was given in charge, on three indictments, for the murder of Wm. Higgins, at Corofin, on the 19th of April last – first,\n\n(Break)\n\nCross-examined by Counsellor Freeman.\n\nI am a poor woman, and live in a small mud cabin; there is but one room in my house, and another in Honor Concannon’s house, with a high cable between them; the door of Concannon’s house was broken, and my own was not firm; Darby, Pat, Michael, and James Connell, two children, and Kitty Kinnealy, slept at my place the night the murder was committed; we did not hear the least noise during the night, though the door was broken, and we were so convenient. Higgins, the deceased, was a beggar going about the country.\n\nSTATE OF THE COUNTRY\n\nExtract of a Letter from Enniskillen, dated Aug. 2\n\n“On the evening of last Sunday se’nnight, several Catholic young men were returning from the Chapel of Kennawley to the town of Enniskillen. A party of Orangemen, apprised of the circumstances of its being a patron-day in that parish, way-laid the Catholics on their return, near to a place called Ballihaleck, in this county. They commenced their attack by throwing stones at the Catholics from behind a hedge. A young man of the name of Constantine Martin, without the slightest colour of provocation, a tenant of the Earl of Belmore’s, had his skull fractured –\n\n(Break)\n\nThe Chief Baron read the part of the Act of Parliament to the Jurors, which inflicts a penalty of £500 on any Roman Catholic Priest, marrying a Protestant; and in the event of being unable to pay the sum, to be confined to the gaol. The Jury brought in, after a consultation of about an hour, a verdict of Guilty.\n\nNOVEL CASE.\n\nTerence O’Loughlin was indicted for the murder of Mrs. Ellen Stackpoole, at Moymore, on the 26th of March last, he, the said Terence O’Loughlin, illegally threatening and demanding money from her, and so affrighting her, as to cause her death.\n\nCounsellor Wolfe thought the novelty of the present charge demanded from him some remarks. He then stated the case. The deceased Mrs. Stacpoole was a peculiarly nervous lady, and in great fear of fever. He was instructed that the prisoner being aware of this, took advantage of the absence of her husband and servants to rush into her presence, and demanded money, telling her that the clothes he wore were taken from a house infected with fever;\n\n(Break)\n\nThe evidence was then gone through, and fully supported the statement of the Learned Gentleman. The Jury took about half an hour to consult, when they brought in a verdict of Manslaughter. – To be imprisoned six months.\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL Galway, Monday, August 9, 1824\n\nLIMERICK, AUG 4 – On Friday night, two men were deliberately beaten in the neighbourhood of Askeaton, by a party of disguised villains; and the reason assigned was, for working on the new line of road, according to Mr. Griffith’s plan, and contrary to the wishes of the people. It appears that Mr. Griffith insists on having the work performed by task, in gangs of 12 each, while the labourers require to be paid by the day.\n\nA most barbarous outrage was committed on the mountains of Ballygerine, about two miles from Killaloe, on Saturday night last. Some person most cruelly tortured two cows, the property of William Smith, by forcing sticks into their bodies, in consequence of which they died in the greatest agony on Sunday night.\n\nAt the fair of O’Brien’s Bridge, on the 26th ult. a man in the employ of John Massy, Esq., was dreadfully beaten, and his skull fractured. He died on Sunday last.\n\nOn Saturday last, Mrs. Hare, widow of Major Hare, who was murdered at Mount Henry, in the county Limerick, arrived in that city from Plymouth, to attend the trial of the person in custody for the foul act. On Monday she had an interview with them in the gaol, when she identified one of them as being concerned; her feelings were much agitated on the occasion; and since the murder she has been in extreme grief.\n\nSunday last, Mr. Griffith laid the foundation stone of the new bridge, over the river Feale, which is to be called Wellesley Bridge, in commemoration of the Viceroyship of his present Excellency, to whom the public are solely indebted for so many important works now going on in that hitherto neglected part of the Country. The three first stones that were laid weighed over seven tons. A quantity of whisky was poured on them when they were put down.\n\nThe public will be gratified to learn, that the line of Road between Limerick and Tralee, part of which was executed at the private expense of Mr. Rice, of Mount Trenchard, is nearly complete, and that a Mail Coach will be started in August, to run between Limerick and Tralee.- Mr. Rice will be repaid his expenses by the Grand Jury. It is curious to remark, that Mr. Rice excepted a piece of road for 200l. for which a sum of 2,000l. was demanded for by contract.\n\nhttp://www.irelandoldnews.com/Galway/1824/AUG.html\n\nTHE CONNAUGHT JOURNAL-Galway, Thursday, August 12, 1824\n\nEXECUTION OF SIX MEN FOR MURDER\n\nMrs. Louisa Hare was sworn, and examined by Mr. Plunkett\n\nThis lady is widow to the late lamented Major Hare; she was clad in deep mourning; and her appearance from the recollections it gave rise to, excited universal sympathy in Court; she recollected the attack made on house on the night of the 31st of January, 1822;\n\n(Break)\n\nMonday, at an early hour, the avenues leading to the County Gaol were crowded with an immense multitude, assembled to behold the execution of Greene and the two Minnanes, for the murder of Major Hare; and of Dawley and the two Flinns, for that of John Hartnet, driver to the Hon. Col. Fitzgibbons estates near Abbeyfeale.\n\nPrecisely at 20 minutes after one, a party of the 3d Dragoon Guards, and as small party of Infantry, arrived at the gaol, and shortly after those for the murder of Major Hare walked out of their cells, attended each by two Clergymen. When first they came in sight of the fatal scaffolds, they knelt down and appeared very much absorbed with their devotions. James Minnane walked first and was followed by Greene; the last who came up was Patrick Minane, whose conduct and appearance indicated much fortitude and resignation. They were all dressed in white baize, and the Clergymen who attended them were in their full robes.- When the executioner made his appearance in order to adjust the ropes, &c., a murmur of disapprobation ran throughout the entire multitude.- After they had remained some time on the scaffold at their devotions, in which the voice of Patrick Minnane was audible to all around, from the clearness and distinctness, with which he answered the Clergymen, they kissed each other and bade the Clergymen and the person around them farewell. Pat Minnane, whose demeanor throughout the entire awful scene was that of a person of courage and piety deserving of a different fate, then addressed the crowd in nearly the following words: “My friends, we entrust you to implore that the mercy of God for us, through the merits of his blessed Son and of the Virgin Mary, that he may pardon us our sins and offences and that he may have mercy on our souls. Our advice to you is, to shun all bad advice, to avoid evil company, and not to frequent public-houses, except on necessary occasions- avoid trivial occurrences, which will come, by repetition, to weightier offences. Had we all the devotion and christianity which was recommended to us by our Clergymen, we would not arrive at this fate – had we attended to the directions of our Catholic Clergy, there would have been no occasion for this scaffold and that fatal stake, or for those ropes and the multitude before us- had we abided by their directions at the holy altar, it is evident that this would not be our fatal end- on the other hand, it is not informations, nor indictments, nor capiases, that will be the means of pacifying the county Limerick, but the advice and exhortations of the Clergy. Oh! my friends, avoid whiskey-drinking, and cursing, and swearing – have nothing to do with combinations- be constant in attending the holy Mass- abide by what your Clergy say, and God will assist you all, and may he have mercy on your souls.” These words he spoke in a clear, strong, and audible tone of voice, which was heard by the crowd at the foot of the scaffold, on whom, it is to be hoped, that these few sensible remarks form one of themselves, in his final moments, will make a lasting impression. At the conclusion of these sentences, they knelt on the scaffold, and remained in that attitude praying for a few minutes. As the hangman put the rope round the neck of James Minnane, a strong flash of read appeased on his demeanor, while on Patrick, who was next to him, and stood in the centre, it did not make the least visible change.; Green was too great a distance from us, to observe what effect it had upon him. The executioner had descended the scaffold, and the clergymen were about to retire, when Pat Minnane remarked, that from the looseness of the tying round his arms, he feared that he was too much at liberty, and desired to have himself more tightly pinioned, which was accordingly done, and after the most solemn and awful silence for about a minute, the fatal drop fell, and this world closed on the eyes of the unfortunate men for ever. They died without a struggle, except for a very short while a slight convulsive shivering was observable throughout Green’s entire frame. After hanging the usual times, their bodies were taken down and removed to a back yard of the gaol.\n\nThe fatal trap was again adjusted, and the ropes arranged, when Murtogh and Daniel Flinn, and Dawley their servant, attended by the same Clergymen, and attired in the same manner as the three former, ascended the scaffold where having remained as short while attending to their devotion, Daniel Flinn, who spoke in Irish, requested the prayers of the people, and declared that he was not present at the murder, but knew before hand of its committal. The other two acknowledged their guilt, and begged of all to pray to God to pardon them. In a minute or two after the ropes being adjusted, the drop again fell, and this world and all its vanities disappeared for ever from their sight. Daniel Flinn died without much pain – but the struggles of Murtogh lasted for a very long while- he continued to thump his breast incessantly for more than four minutes, and kicked very much- altogether he appeared to have died with a great deal of pain. Their bodies having hung the required time, were taken down, and the whole six were removed that evening to the County Hospital, where they were dissected and anatomised.

Mr. Mahony, one of the curates of Tralee, had succeeded in bringing him to a sense of his enormity, and of the awful change he was about to enter into; he evinced a good deal of firmness and acknowledged the justice of his sentence, and forgave his prosecutors.- He was escorted in a chaise to the place of execution by the horse and foot police, and two companies of infantry. This execution took place in a field near the Cross of Sinnagh, nine miles distant from Killarney, and very near the scene where the unfortunate Mr. Brerton was found murdered. In consequence of the novelty of an execution in that part of the country, as well as the extensive acquaintance which Cotter had in the place, immense crowds were attracted to the spot, but notwithstanding the arrangements were gone through without the slightest interruption.- The cavalcade arrived at the spot about two o’clock on Monday. Much time was consumed in erecting the gallows, during which interval he remained in the chaise deeply engaged in prayer. After a lapse of three quarters of an hour, the necessary preparations being complete, he descended from the chaise, and walked from thence to the foot of the gallows where he knelt, and having said a few prayers he was about to mount the scaffold when it was discovered that his arms were not properly tied, in humanity to the unfortunate man, the defect was remedied, and he pointed to the executioner in which way to adjust the cord. On reaching the drop, and kneeling, he asked leave to address the assemblage and spoke as follows:\n\n“I beg leave to say a few words- I acknowledge the justice of my sentence; I forgive my prosecutors and my enemies and this man here (meaning the executioner) I call upon those assembled to abstain from nightly meetings; it was by attending at these that I am brought to this fate, and if others follow my example they will come to a like end. I beg the prayers of those present and may the Lord have mercy upon me!”\n\nHaving stood up, the rope was finally adjusted, the drop fell, and in a few moments lie had left him, without even a struggle, on his fall there was no exclamation of horror, and the immense multitude fell simultaneously upon their knees, and offered up their prayers to the throne of God, for mercy upon the misguided man.\n\nKERRY ASSIZES\n\nTRALEE, AUGUST 10 – The Hon. Mr. Justice JEBB and the Hon. Mr. Justice VANDELEUR arrived here this day, from Limerick.\n\nDenis Sullivan stood charged with having administered an unlawful oath to James Barrett, and with an assault on the person of Thomas Doherty and James Barrett- committed on the 7th April at Duree, in this County.\n\nJames Barrett swore, that as he and Doherty were on the 7th of April, proceeding to the home of Mr. M’Sweeny, to serve a process, they were met by the prisoner, and a number of other men; they took a number of papers from them by force; tore the seal from some of them, and forced them back on the witness; they then beat him very severely, and pursued him with a branding iron for some distance, when he fell from loss of blood. On coming up they made him go on his knees; gave him a book, and made him swear, never to go to that place again, to which witness replied, “I’ll engage – I won’t” – they also swore him not to have any more to do with respect to the legal proceedings against Mr. M’Sweeny, and that he would not prosecute any of those present- during all this and while they were beating witness, Sullivan was within 40 or 50 yards of the men, who occasionally carried to him (he being the only one amongst them who could read) the papers of which they had deprived witness; there were others amongst the men, whose names he knows; saw John Curran amongst them, who has a right to know better than witness himself who it was that beat him.\n\nThomas Doherty corroborated in part the testimony of the last witness, stating that he saw the prisoner collar Barrett; on being asked whether the beating he got might not prevent his swearing with such accuracy, he replied that if the Counsel himself got such a beating, he would not be able to swear with great accuracy. This witness left the table, saying that he would not answer all their question, for there were too many of them at him.\n\nJohn Curran swore that he was present during the assault; is of opinion that Barrett & Doherty got enough of it; saw no paper taken from Barrett.\n\nDaniel Sullivan stated that on the Monday in question, he went to Mr. M’Sweeny’s – the men were not beat at all, as he was in the house with Sullivan all the time.\n\nMr. M’Gillicuddy deposed to the general good character of the prisoner, who was found guilty of the assault and riot, and acquitted on the charge of administering the oath; he was sentenced to twelve months hard labour.\n\nCONVICTION OF CAPTAIN COTTER FOR THE MURDER OF MR. BRERETON\n\nOn Friday, the 12th, Timothy Cotter was put to the bar, charged with the murder of William Brerton, committed at Shannagh, in this county, on the 24th January, 1824.\n\nThe circumstances proved were most barbarous. The deceased, in company with his man, had undertaken to convey the Mail from Killarney to Millstreet, on the 24th January, 1824, the coach having been stopped the preceding night, by the insurgents. At Carriganimi, four miles from Killarney, they were met by a number of people armed with scythes, pitchforks, and other weapons, who immediately assailed them, dragging Bryan M’Guire, Mr. Brereton’s servant, off his horse, and makign a furious attack upon Brereton himself, who had resolution enough, being mounted on a spirited horse, to drive through an immense crowd of the assailants who surrounded him on all sides. He had partly succeeded, when a stroke of a scythe was made at his horse, which almost cut off the hind quarter of the animal – the horse, urged by the impetus, still advanced for about ten yards, when he fell. Brereton was surrounded and inhumanely butchered. When he was found, one arm was cut off, and the entire body was literally covered with wounds. Bryan M’Guire, Dennis Sullivan, (an approver), and a policeman, were examined on the part of the Crown; Mr. John Kelly, of the police establishment, was also examined, when the circumstances of guilt were clearly proved against the prisoner, who produced one witness, who was wholly insufficient to invalidate the other testimony.\n\nMr. Justice Jebb charged the Jury; and Counsellor Walshe, long before the verdict was announced, charitably returned the unhappy man his fee. He seemed to receive it as an earnest of his approaching fate, and though apparently removed during the entire trial, shook his head with melancholy significance upon receiving the money.\n\nThe Jury did not remain long in deliberation, but gave in the expected verdict of “guilty;” and the usual question being put to the prisoner, if he had any thing to say in arrest of the sentence of death, he answered that he would leave it all to God. The Judge then addressed him, in a most impressive and solemn manner, exhorting him to seek mercy from that God, who had never denied it; who would not deny it to him though he (the prisoner) had refused it in the unhappy man who had fallen an innocent and harmless victim to his cruelty and barbarity. His Lordship dwelt with much eloquence upon the atrocity of the crime; the cowardly spirit which could prompt the commission of such a horrid act; and the extreme clearness of the violence upon which the prisoner was found guilty. He then passed upon him the awful sentence of the law, during the entire of which the prisoner behaved with such resolution and composure as to excite the wonder of the entire Court.\n\nPERJURY\n\nThe next was a trial which awakened the deepest interest; the Court was crowded to excess; a profound silence resigned throughout; when Edward Orpen, Esq, late of Island Lodge, in this County, was put to the bar, charged with most willful and corrupt perjury. The indictment, which was very long, was formally read through; it contained several counts, upon each of which the prisoner was accused of the above crime, committed with the intention of defrauding J. Hurley, Esq. of the benefit of a mortgage on the property of J. Russell, to the evil example of all others, and contrary to the King’s peace, his Crown & dignity.\n\nThis was a case, arising out of a trial of two issues, from the Court of Exchequer, which was disposed of before Mr. Serjeant Lefroy, at the last Assizes for this County.\n\nMany witnesses were examined upon the trial of Mr. Orpen, and after an able charge from Judge Jebb, the Jury having retired for about half an hour, returned with a verdict of Guilty.\n\nHis Lordship then addressed the prisoner, and having, in the course of a severe reproof, dwelt with much eloquence and force upon the unexampled enormity of his crime, sentenced him to transportation for seven years.\n\nIt was near 10 o’clock at night when this trial was over and the following morning was appointed for the trial of Mr. Rice O’Connor, the Agent for the former prosecution, and a party in the cause, charged with further indictment, with a conspiracy against Mr. John Hurley, and a subordination of perjury. This prosecution however id not go on, it was put off by affidavit from the prisoner, stating that he had not sufficient notice of the indictment, and that he would be prepared by the next Assizes. To this measure Mr. Hurley readily consented, stating, through his Counsel, that they were most anxious to allow him every opportunity of preparation, and hoping that he would be able to acquit himself of the charge- He also consented to admit him to bail on his own recognizance.\n\n(Break)\n\nAt the funeral of the murderers of the much lamented Major Hare, which took place on Thursday, there were more than 7000 persons assembled through which, on his way from this city to Killarney, the Right Hon.

CALCUTTA, December 12. A sensation has been created in Roman Catholic circles in India by the decision of the Father-General at the Society of Jesus not to permit bather Gille, of St. Xavier’s, Calcutta, one of the best-known Roman Catholics, and editor of the Catholic Herald of India, to return to this country. One result of the decision will be the demise or the suppression of the ‘Catholic Herald,’ in which Father Gille persistently advocated the greater Indiaisation of the Roman Catholic Church, and thus so greatly annoyed some of the foreign missions in Southern India that they sought the intervention of Rome. Father Gille says that he believes that the time will come when Catholic India will raise her own clergy.\n\nEAST MEETS WEST\n\nNew Zealand Herald, Volume LXXII, Issue 22142, 22 June 1935\n\nINDIAN PRIEST IN LONDON The jolliest priest in the world was in London last month.

He has merry dark eyes and a neatly trimmed black beard. He explained his inordinately long name. ” Sardar is a title conferred upon me by the King for supplying men and money during the war,” he said. ” Khan Bahadur is a title given me by the British Government, and Dastur is my religious title. It means archbishop or high priest. Nesherwan, my first name, means immortal, and Kaikebad was an ancient Persian king.” The Sardar has 40 dioceses under his jurisdiction.\n\nHe said: ” People think we worship the sun, fire and water, and the moon. That is not strictly correct. We worship an unknown invisible God who created these, and therefore we regard them as sacred symbols.” He is keenly interested in the Boy Scout and Girl Guide movements in India, and his pride is his garden at Poona.\n\nREY.
