See also lives by Gordon Corrigan and Andrew Roberts.\n\n[ top ]\n\nCommentary\n\nRobert Lee Wolff, ed., [John Banim,] The Denounced by the OHara Family, 3 vols. [facsimile edn.] (NY: Garland 1978), ded. Wellington; consists of two novels, The Last Baron of Crana, and The Conformists [pl. sic], the latter set near Coleraine and featuring a fanatically anti-Catholic bishop in the historical person of Anthony Dopping, Bishop of Meath (1643-1697) as an example of savage prejudice of Protestant Ulstermen [Wolff]. The novel bears an epigraph from Moore, - bright oer the flood/Of her tears and her blood,/Let the rainbow of hope be Wellingtons name. The dedication reads, Addressed to His Grace Arthur, duke of Wellington, these tales most gratefully, and most respectfully, are enscribed. The Preface of three pages speaks briefly of the commencement of writing and the old laws ... at that time debated which had since became unexpectedly decided (p.[v]), and defends the author against continuing prejudices and opening wounds afresh, possibly language used by Wellington. In his introduction, Wolff refers to the dedication in the light of the fact that Wellington was castigated in The Anglo-Irish of the XIXth Century. The implication is that the dedication must be ironically intended, even that The Denounced is none other than Wellington himself. Vide the lines He Said that he was not Our Brother, occasioned by a ferocious attack provoked by some utterance of Wellington about Ireland, according to McCarthy (ed., Irish Literature, 1904; cited supra). And note also the occasion when Wellington attacked the Catholic mayor of Kilkenny, as reported in Cabinet [?], who may have been Michael Banim.\n\nQueen Victoria on the death of Wellington: We were startled this morning at seven oclock by a letter from Colonel Phipps enclosing a telegraphic dispatch with the report, from the sixth edition of the Sun, of the Duke of Wellingtons death the day before yesterday, which report however, we did not at all believe. Would to God that we had been right, and that this day had not been cruelly saddened in the afternoon. Then Mackenzie returned bringing letters [one] contained the confirmation that Englands, or rather Britains pride, her glory, her hero, the greatest man she ever had produced, was no more! Sad day! Great and irreparable loss! (Queen Victoria's diary, Thursday, September 16, 1852; rep. in British and Irish Women's Letters and Diaries, ed. Melissa Hardy, et al., Alexandria, VA: Alexander Street Press & Stevenage (UK) 2012 - online; accessed 25.09.2012.)\n\nTimes Literary Supplement (17 July 1992), review of The Iron Duke: A Military Biography of Wellington, a work concentrating on his achievements in logistics, manpower and money, in the Napoleonic War, which absorbed 60 to 90 percent of government revenue, and involved the loss of 3,217 ships, 223 wrecked or foundered; also mentions Elizabeth Longfords biography, Norman Gash, ed., Studies in the Military and Political Career of the First Duke of Wellington, and a more recondite article on Wellington as a horseman for the Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, by G. Tylden.\n\nVincent Cheng, White horse, dark horse: Joyces allhorse of another color, [Chap. 9] in Joyce, Race and Empire (Cambridge UP 1995), espec. p.263ff., which incls. paintings of Wellington and his horse Copenhagen by B. R. Hayden. Cheng argues somewhat tendentiously that surely Joyce [...] knew that Copenhagen was not white, and treats suggests that Joyce was engaging in a Freudian slip or rather Wakean pun that turns on the whiteness of King Billys mount. (Op. cit., p.268.)\n\nScott Hughes Myerly, British Military Spectacle from the Napoleonic Wars Through the Crimea (Harvard UP 1996): Command and Design [Chap. 2]: Even the Duke of Wellington suffered indignity and potentially serious injury as a result of George IVs and Victorias passion for the martial image. As the realms first soldier, the duke often had to wear the uniform of the units he was connected with and the military offices he held. When wearing the nearly two-foot-high regulation First Life Guards bearskin cap with its enormous swan feather while attending a review in 1829, he was literally blown off his horse by a gust of wind in front of tens of thousands of spectators and soldiers. The incident aroused considerable ridicule in print and caricatures, and had the undesirable political effect of giving a good fillip to the strong feelings of hostility towards the duke at a time of political crisis. While attending the queen on the royal navy ship St. Vincent in 1842, when he was seventy-three, he wrote: The queen had repeatedly insisted upon my wearing my hat, a large cocked hat with [a] feather, and I had besides my sword. But the weapon got tangled in the rungs of the steep ships ladder while he was climbing down, and I was obliged to be nearly doubl in order to avoid touching the top deck with my hat. Though he was unhurt, the duke wrote that the queen forced me to wear my hat on Tuesday, [the next day] she repeatedly warned me not to fall again. (p.39.) Note also that George IVs brother and successor William IV told Wellington that he [William] had saved the day at Salamanca by bringing up some cavalry when things were looking very bad indeed. (Idem., p.31.)\n\n[ top ]\n\nQuotations\n\nAllhorse: Wellington is accredited with the possibly apocryphal remark that a man may be born in a stable without being a horse - a remark variously quoted as: a horse is not an ass because he is born in an asss stable. (For the latter, see Charles Lysaght, ed., Great Irish Lives [Times Books], HarperCollins 2008, Introduction, p.xvi.) See also under James Joyce in Notes, infra [viz., \"stableborn\" in Finnegans Wake.]\n\nWhosehorse? Legend ascribes to Wellington the famous remark about not being a horse because one is born in a stable - by analogy with his English nationality and his Irish birth - but it was Daniel OConnell who memorialised it in his statement during the Irish State Trials of 1844 in saying, The poor of Duke, what shall I say of him, to be sure he was born in Ireland, but being born in a stable does not make him a horse. ( Shaws Authenticated Report of the Irish State Trials (1844) [Information supplied by Carmel McCaffrey on Irish Diaspora E-List, 01.10.2014.]\n\nRonan McGreevy, Wellington won Battle of Waterloo 200 years ago - but Irish rejected his legacy, in The Irish Times (18 June 2015). Available at The Irish Times - online; accessed 08.12.2017.\n\nHorse-frighteners?: When notified of homosexual high-jinks in the stables, Wellington reputedly replied, I don't care what they do as long as it doesnt frighten the horses.\n\nUngovernable Ireland: If you glance at the history of Ireland during the last ten years, you will find that agitation really means something short of rebellion; that, and no other, is the exact meaning of the word. It is to place the country in that state in which its government is utterly impracticable, except by means of an overawing military force. (House of Lords, May 1829; quoted in R. Barry OBrien, A Hundred Years of Irish History (Isbister 1902, Note VIII, p.156.\n\n[ top ]\n\nReferences\n\nRichard Ryan, Biographia Hibernica, Irish Worthies (1821), Vol. II, p.422, Garnet Mornington, Earl of Wellington.\n\nAnne Crookshank, Irish Portraits Exhibition (Ulster Mus. 1965), lists port. by John Lucas in the National Portrait Collection (London).\n\nHyland Books (Cat. 224) lists Letters of the Duke of Wellington to Miss J., 1834-1851 (1st edn. 1889); F.

This occurrence occasioned a serious and protracted enquiry in the ensuing session of the Imperial Parliament.\n\nMarquess [sic] of Wellesley, older br. of Duke of Wellington, served as diplomat and later Lord Lieutenant in Ireland, where he advocated Catholic Emancipation, and angered George IV, but also attracted the antagonism of the Orange Order whose members threw bottles at him in 1822; resigned from Viceregal office when his br. Arthur became Prime Minister in 1828. (See Vincent Cheng, Joyce, Race and Empire, Cambridge UP 1995, p.272.\n\nG. B. Shaw remarked on the untheatrical Wellington in his Preface to John Bulls Other Island.\n\nTrim, Co. Meath: The Wellington Monument [var. Column] was erected Trim, Co. Meath, in 1819; a Wellington Court Hotel stands on the Dublin road. William Bulfin makes mention of the monument to Duke of Wellington at Trim, Co. Meath, erected by gentry of Co. Meath.
