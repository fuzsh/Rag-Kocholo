        "text": "Early life\n\nArthur Wellesley (1769-1852) was born in Dublin in 1769 to an aristocratic Anglo-Irish family. In 1781, aged 12, he was sent to school at Eton. But his father’s death that same year threw the family into financial turmoil.\n\nArthur’s mother withdrew him from Eton to be schooled in Belgium and France. She saw such little promise in her son that she felt the military was the best career choice for him. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787.\n\nIndia\n\nArthur first saw action during the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars (1793-1802). In the Netherlands, he learnt valuable lessons on leadership, organisation and tactics.\n\nIn 1796, he sailed to India, where his brother Richard had been appointed Governor-General. Now a colonel, Arthur was appointed chief advisor to the Nizam of Hyderabad's army. He then led the 33rd Regiment at Malavelly and Seringapatam in 1799.\n\nAlthough later derided as a ‘sepoy general’ by Napoleon, Wellesley learnt a lot in India that would prove vital in his Peninsular War campaigns. This included the importance of discipline, diplomacy with allies, intelligence gathering, manoeuvring, secure supply lines and naval support.\n\nArthur was promoted to major-general in 1802 during the 2nd Maratha War (1803-05). At Assaye on 23 September 1803, he won his first major victory. He later regarded this as the best battle he ever fought. Victories at Argaum and Gawlighur followed.\n\nArthur returned to England in 1806, where he embarked on a political career as a Tory member of parliament for Rye. He continued his political career before serving at Copenhagen in 1807.\n\nThe Peninsula\n\nIn 1808, Wellesley was made lieutenant-general and sent to Portugal, where he defeated the French at Roliça and Vimeiro. During the latter engagement, he checked the French columns with the reverse slope defence, a tactic that became his trademark.\n\nFollowing the controversial Convention of Cintra (1809), he was recalled to Britain to face a court of enquiry. He was cleared of any wrongdoing and returned to the Peninsula, where he secured Oporto and drove the French from Portugal.\n\nHe pursued the enemy into Spain, winning a narrow victory at Talavera (1809), for which he was raised to the peerage. But, following the arrival of French reinforcements, he fell back into Portugal.\n\nIn 1810, the newly styled Viscount Wellington slowed the French advance at Buçaco, before halting them at the Lines of Torres Vedras. The French withdrew to Spain in March 1811.\n\nWellington then moved on Almeida. He defeated the French at Fuentes de Onoro in May. In January 1812, he took Ciudad Rodrigo - for which he received an earldom - and assaulted Badajoz in April.\n\nOn 22 July 1812, he won a great victory at Salamanca​​​​. This battle proved Wellington had the ability to manoeuvre and attack in the open field, and established his reputation as an offensive general. However, his subsequent failure to take Burgos (September-October 1812) forced the British to retreat once more to Portugal."
