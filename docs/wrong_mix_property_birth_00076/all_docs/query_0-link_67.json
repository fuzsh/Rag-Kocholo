He had a limited but significant connection with early cinema: he played in King John (1899), starring Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and directed by William K L Dickson (who defined 35mm film when working for Edison) and Walter Pfeffer Dando for British Mutoscope and Biograph Company—almost certainly the first ever film of a Shakespeare play (albeit only two minutes long). He made only one more film, for Hepworth in 1913. In 1918 he wrote a book, Problems of the Actor, which is still available1.

According to Williamson's son Alan, Chart was a PE instructor at an army reserve post near Brighton. (Could that be Preston Barracks?) In his book The Romance of the Movies (London: Heinemann, 1937), Leslie Wood proposes that Chart was a minor heartthrob and could have been the first actor to be of greater interest to the audience than the films he was in; Alan Williamson said he was popular with audiences. Penny postcard portraits of Chart were sold at shows of his films—an unusual, even unprecedented promotional move. It appears that after his brief film career he ran the Sea Serpent PH in Gloucester Road, Brighton.

He remained in that region until his retirement in 1852. He donated an obelisk and fountain in Victoria Gardens to the town in 1871.
