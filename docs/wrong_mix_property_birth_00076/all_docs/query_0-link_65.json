Robert Irwin, Richard Davis, and William Tracey, were by the Jury found Guilty of Capital Offences, and receiv'd Sentence of Death accordingly Richard Davis and William Tracey, of St. Paul's Covent-Garden William Tracey about 50 Years of Age, of honest Parents, but had no Education at School. When he was a Boy of seven or eight Years of Age, as he said, he was with his Father in the Seige of Londonderry, where he continu'd till the City was reliev'd. His Father was Poor and did not put him to any Trade; when of Age, he serv'd as a Soldier for several Years in Ireland, Flanders and Spain. Afterwards being weary of the Army, he came to London, married a Wife and kept House in and about Hedge-lane, for Twentyfive Years past, and said he serv'd sometimes as Watchman, and that he was well known in the Parish, and several People in the Neighbourhood could testify, that he carried himself well, kept a good House and was of a good Character. He kept a Fruit-stand, and sometimes drove a Barrow about the Streets, and his Wife and he liv'd well and bred up a good Family of Children, by following that Business. He let out his House to such Lodgers as he could get, and said, he never knew any of them Dishonest, but those who were taken up on this Occasion, in company of one of whom he died. He reflected bitterly (and I believe unjustly) on a certain Gentleman. He confess'd that he had been a great Swearer and Drinker, and very cruel and barbarous in abusing his Wife, whom he call'd his Poor Woman, in a loving Way. He profess'd himself Penitent, but was grosly Ignorant in Religion. At First he gave out, that he was of our Communion; but the Day before he died, he own'd himself of another.... Tracey said, he believ'd in Christ, repented of his Sins, and died in Peace with all the World\n\nRobert Irwin, 57 Years of Age, of honest creditable Parents, in the County of Fermenagh, had good Education his Father rais'd a Troop of Horse, and join'd the brave Iniskilling Men, and was one of those Officers, who march'd to the Relief of London-Derry: At this Time Robert was about 17 Years of Age, and attended his Father in the Expedition, and was One of them, who, in Company with his Father, defended the City, till King William sent them seasonable Relief, when they were reduc'd to the greatest Extremity; and at last, the Enemy fearing the King's Arrival in that Kingdom, were oblig'd to raise the Seige\n\nhttp://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=OA17310924n45-1&div=OA17310924#highlight\n\n21 October 1731 Will\n\nJames Tracy, Ballyneal Londonderry\n\n8 Jul 1732 and 31 Jan 1743 Memorial No: 78669\n\n1st Deed Sir Thomas Webster and John Rawlinson, Esq to William Tracy, gent, of Ballyneilmore [Ballyneill More], parish Artrea, co Londonderry\n\n2nd Deed William Tracy, gent, of Ballyneilmore, parish Artrea, co Londonderry to Robert Johnson of Little Bridge, co Londonderry\n\n6 Sep 1737 & 19 Jun 1738 Deed Pool\n\nWilliam Tracy of Ballyneill, Londonderry gent son and heir conveyed by James Tracy of Ballyneill, Londonderry lands which had previously been demised to John Graves of Castledawson, Co.

John Tracy, rector of Kilcronaghan, was bred to the medical profession...\n\nJohn Wesley Etheridge (1858) The life of the rev. Adam Clarke\n\n He went and settled in an obscure village called Moybeg, township of Cootinaglugg, in the parish of Kilchronaghan, in the barony of Loughinshallin, in the county of Londonderry. In this obscure district, the names of which almost bid defiance to enunciation, his second son Adam, the subject of this Memoir, was born, either in the year 1760 or 1762, most probably the former, but neither the year nor the month can be ascertained. He was baptized in the parish church by his uncle, the Rev. John Tracy, the Rector, who had married his mother's sister (MacLeans of Mull Scotland). On application to the late worthy incumbent, the Rev. Mr. Bryan, to obtain a copy of the baptismal register, the following answer has been obtained:  The archives of the church have been carefully searched, but no register during Mr. Tracy's incumbency has been found; none having been kept during that period; or if kept, since irrecoverably lost.\n\nAs Mr. Tracy died sometime between 1760 and 1762, and Adam Clarke was baptized by him, he must have been born within that period.\n\nIt may not be improper to say a few words here of his brother, who was born about three years before him. He was called Tracy, at the instance of his uncle the Rev. J. Tracy, already mentioned; who, having no child, promised to be at the expence of his education, &c. Such promises are rarely fulfilled ; but this pledge would probably have been redeemed, had Mr. Tracy lived, for he had already taken the child to his own house, but dying shortly after, the young lad, already spoiled by indulgence, was restored to his parents \n\nAn Account of the Infancy, Religious, and Literary Life of Adam Clarke ...: by Adam Clarke, Richard Smith, Joseph Butterworth Bulmer Clarke.

The senior members of the community in Desertmartin, where he first officiated, and many more of the people of Derry, where he ministered afterwards for about eighteen years, will hear of the event with feelings of unfeigned respect for his memory. Born in the year 1826 in Lower Badony, he became an ecclesiastical student of the Brow of the Hill Seminanry, under the presidency of Father Patrick Campbell. He passed thence with credit to the college of Maynooth. Having served in Desertmartin as curate for some years, the late reverend prelate Dr. Kelly brought him to the City of Derry, where he officiated for about eighteen years. He then appointed him to the important charge of Dungiven parish about the year 1876. After the death of Father Daniel Magee (who, with Rev. William M'Laughlin, was his colleague in the ministry in Derry City), he succeeded him as Master of Conference of the county Derry Deanery. Under his pastorate in Dungiven, which extended over thirteen years, the new church of St. Patrick was erected cl;ose to the town on the noble site procured by his predecessor, Very Rev. Father Dan Mooney, and of this undoubtedly fine building Father Tracey was justly proud, being heard now and then to put forward its claim to be the second best Catholic Church in this diocese of Derry.

Bernard Tracy, Of Pollokshaws.\n\nOn Friday the Catholics of Pollokshaws, Thornliebank, Cathcart, and Crossmyloof met in the school-room attached to the church, and presented their pastor, the Rev. Bernard Tracy, with a gold chalice, a handsome suit of vestments, and a purse of fifty sovereigns.\n\nThe chair was occupied by the Rev. Thomas Keane, Barrhead, besides whom we observed on the platform the Rev. Messrs. M'IsTainara, Cronin, Tracy, Duffy, &c.; Dr. George Smith, Messrs. MAleer, Connolly, Houston, and Montague.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN, on rising to introduce the business of the evening, expressed his gratification at the excellent assembly before him. He believed it was no exaggeration to say that the improvements in Pollokshaws were at least equal to those of any other place in Scotland, hence the desire of those present to mark their sense of these by presenting their pastor with a testimonial, or rather testimonials, as a proof of their esteem and regard for him. He then called on the secretary to read the address.\n\nThe address was printed on pink satin. The vestments and chalice are chaste works of art and design.\n\nAfter the presentation, the Rev. Bernard Tracy rose to reply, and was warmly applauded be all present. He referred to that part of the address which spoke of his labours among them. He acknowledged there was some selfishness in his desire to build the new church. No one suffered more than he did, even after having built a gallery and removed the vestry of the old church, in which they then were gathered. He asked advice, and being urged by the necessities of his congregation commenced to build. True, he might have been satisfied and contented with four bare walls, like the old place, fit enough for a Scottish congregation. But, travelling through France, he saw a venerable church with a motto on it, which he always endeavoured to fulfil\" Let there be nothing trivial in the service of God.\" The church they had erected would speak and preach to generations yet unborn.\n\nAfter some further remarks, the rev. gentleman referred to the good dispositions of many of the parochial boardsespecially the City Boardwho kindly allowed Catholic children to be boarded with Catholic families, and, in fact, preferred them for this class of children. The speaker paid a high, and, we believe, a well-deserved compliment, to the Inspector of the City Board.\n\nThe proceedings of the evening were enlivened by some excellent singing by the popular favourites, Miss Johnstone, Mr. Thompson, and others.Glasgow Free Press.\n\n1st April 1893 The Tablet\n\nGlasgow Clerical Appointments.The following appointments have been made : The Rev.
