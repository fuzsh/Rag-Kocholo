        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Mill Theatre was built during the building of the Dundrum Town Centre in order to facilitate both local and national groups wishing to perform in the area.\n\nDescription\n\nAt entrance level there is an information desk with the theatre itself being housed on the 2 floors below. One level down is the entrance to the main auditorium. This auditorium has seating for 207 people when using the provided seating. The seating can also be pushed back (via a mechanical system) to provide practise or performance space. On the lower floor is a bar and a studio space. This space can be provided separately to the main auditorium for the performance of smaller, more intimate shows. This can seat about 40 people. The theatre has wheel chair access to all floors via a lift from the ground level.\n\nThe theatre is run by Stephen Faloon. Tech manager is Barry Donaldson. Aoife O'Toole is box office manager. Lizz Kinch is Marketing manager and Ed O'Neill is administrator\n\ntage\n\nIn addition to the performance spaces there are also a number of dressing rooms and other back stage areas. There is one wing on stage left with only a small amount of walking space provided on stage right. However there is a cross over allowing access to both sides. The stage entrance is from the underground carpark and therefore there are restrictions on the size and dimensions of the vehicles that gain access to this door.\n\nThere is also a studio space for smaller performances which seats 40 people\n\nee also"
