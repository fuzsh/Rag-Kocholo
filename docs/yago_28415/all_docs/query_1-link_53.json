        "text": "Ferdinand VII of Spain (14 October 1784 – 29 September 1833) was twice King of Spain: in 1808 and again from 1813 to his death. He was also the husband of Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies.\n\nIn 1808, Ferdinand was overthrown when Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain and appointing his own brother, Joseph, as King.[1] However, by 1814, British, Spanish and Portuguese forces managed to remove the French from Spain, restoring Ferdinand to the throne. After becoming King again, Ferdinand reconstituted the Spanish Inquisition, which had been abolished by Joseph.[2]\n\nIn 1820, Ferdinand was ousted by a military uprising, starting a period during which a liberal government ruled Spain known as the Trienio Liberal. However, this period ended in 1823 when French King Louis XVIII ordered the army to intervene and reinstate Ferdinand's absolute power.[3]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nAssassin's Creed (film) (mentioned in promotional material only)"
