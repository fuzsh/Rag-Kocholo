National discontent with a feeble government produced a revolution in 1805. In October 1807, Ferdinand was arrested for his complicity in the Conspiracy of the Escorial in which liberal reformers aimed at securing the help of the emperor Napoleon. When the conspiracy was discovered, Ferdinand betrayed his associates and grovelled to his parents.\n\nWhen his father's abdication was extorted by a popular riot at Aranjuez in March 1808, he ascended the throne but turned again to Napoleon, in the hope that the emperor would support him. He was in his turn forced to make an abdication and imprisoned in France for almost seven years at the Chateau of Valençay in the town of Valençay.\n\nIn March 1814 the Allies returned him to Madrid. The Spanish people, blaming the liberal, enlightened policies of the Francophiles (afrancesados) for incurring the Napoleonic occupation and the Peninsular War, at first welcomed Fernando. Ferdinand soon found that while Spain was fighting for independence in his name and while in his name juntas had governed in Spanish America, a new world had been born of foreign invasion and domestic revolution. Spain was no longer an absolute monarchy under the liberal Constitution of 1812. Ferdinand, in being restored to the throne, guaranteed the liberals that he would govern on the basis of the existing constitution, but, encouraged by conservatives backed by the Church hierarchy, he rejected the constitution within weeks (May 4) and arrested the liberal leaders (May 10), justifying his actions as rejecting a constitution made by the Cortes in his absence and without his consent. Thus he had come back to assert the Bourbon doctrine that the sovereign authority resided in his person only.\n\nMeanwhile, the South American Wars of Independence were under way, though many of the republican rebels would quarrel among themselves and Royalist sentiment was strong in many areas. In the case of the forces led by Bolívar himself, his first permanent victory did not occur until 1817. The Manila galleons and tax revenues from the Spanish Empire were interrupted, and Spain was all but bankrupt.\n\nFerdinand's restored autocracy was guided by a small camarilla of his favourites. He changed his ministers every few months, whimsical and ferocious by turns. The other autocratic powers of the Quintuple Alliance, though forced to support him as the representative of legitimacy in Spain, watched his proceedings with disgust and alarm. \"The King\", wrote Friedrich von Gentz to the hospodar Caradja on December 1, 1814, \"himself enters the houses of his first ministers, arrests them, and hands them over to their cruel enemies\"; and again, on January 14, 1815, \"The king has so debased himself that he has become no more than the leading police agent and gaoler of his country.\"\n\nAs the Spanish king he was the head of the Spanish Order of the Golden Fleece and in this capacity he made the Duke of Wellington the first Protestant member of the order.\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here.\n\nPrincess Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily (14 December 1784, Caserta Palace, Caserta, Italy - 21 May 1806, Aranjuez Palace, Aranjuez, Spain), Princess of Asturias, the youngest daughter of King Ferdinand IV of Naples and Sicily and Marie Caroline of Austria. She was named after her mother's favorite sister, Marie Antoinette, Queen of France. Maria Antonia was a sweet, delicate and intelligent girl, having by the age of seventeen learned several languages.\n\nIn a series of dynastic alliances, Maria Antonia became engaged to Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias (who later became King Ferdinand VII of Spain), while her eldest brother, Francis, became engaged to Ferdinand's sister Infanta Maria Isabella of Spain. On 4 October 1802, Maria Antonia married Ferdinand in Barcelona, Spain. However, her letters to her mother showed her deep disillusionment with her husband, who was ugly and bad-mannered. Her mother, Queen Marie Caroline, wrote the following lines on the subject to one of her friends:\n\nThe Prince of Asturias has an ugly face, a tubby figure, round knees and legs, a piping delicate voice, and is utterly stupid. Though he is physically amorous, they are not yet husband and wife after sleeping together a week. He is disagreeable, dull, as lazy as his sister, and he never leaves his wife a single moment. He has no education, an unpleasant continuous giggle; and their existence is cramped, without comforts or amenities, and subjected to scandalous espionage. Poor Antoinette sends letters that make me weep. She writes: \"Mother, you have been deceived. For you are too good a mother to have sacrificed me like this if you had known.\" She says again: \"I shall not live, but I wish to behave well and deserve eternal life.\"\n\n​\n\nIn addition, the princess failed in provided the expected heir to the throne: her two pregnancies, in 1804 and 1805, ended in miscarriages. Maria Antonia's mother-in-law, the infamous Queen Marie Louise, who hated her as well as her mother Marie Caroline, frequently wrote slanderous letters to her favorite, Manuel Godoy, who was the Spanish prime minister at the time, where she described Maria Antonia as \"the spittle of her mother, a venomous viper, an animal filled with gall and poison instead of blood, a half-dead frog and a diabolical snake.\" To top it all, Queen Marie Louise began to subject Maria Antonia's books and clothes to scrutiny and once, in order to frighten the young princess, she took her down to the dark royal vault in El Escorial so she could contemplate the place where she would be laid to rest one day.\n\nIn\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here."
