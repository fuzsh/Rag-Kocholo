        "text": "Ferdinand VII was a King of Spain who reigned twice, once in 1808 for a brief period and again from 1813 till his death. The royalists who supported him referred to him as 'el Deseado' or 'the Desired,' whereas the liberals who wanted freedom from absolute monarchy called him 'el Rey Felón' or the 'Felon King'. After Napoleon took over, he retaliated and implemented policies that divided Spain into two significant factions with his armies on one side and the dissidents on the other. After he returned to power, he established absolute monarchy with the sole authority residing on the crown. His dismissal of the constitution resulted in several uprisings and revolts spearheaded by Col. Rafael del Riego. Eventually, a Liberal Triennium was agreed upon where the liberals would rule for three years. After the Congress of Verona, France invaded Spain, which ultimately led to his restoration as a king again. Ferdinand reigned until his death and subdued any dissent showed by his opposition, banned the printing of liberal manuscripts, and ordered arrests of several dissenters. Spain was virtually bankrupt as its economy suffered significant losses due to the volatile political climate, and after his death, civil war erupted in Spain.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nSpanish Celebrities Born In October\n\nAlso Known As: Ferdinand VII, The Desired, The Felon King\n\nDied At Age: 48\n\nFamily:\n\nSpouse/Ex-: Maria Christina of the Two Siciliesm (1829), Maria Isabel of Braganzam (1816–1818), Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxonym (1819–1829), Princess Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicil (1802–1806)\n\nfather: Charles IV of Spain\n\nmother: Maria Luisa of Parma\n\nsiblings: Carlos Clemente; Infante of Spain, Carlos Domingo; Infante of Spain, Carlos Francisco de Paula; Infante of Spain, Carlota Joaquina of Spain, Felipe Francisco de Paula; Infante of Spain, Felipe Maria; Infante of Spain, Infanta María Amalia of Spain, Infante Carlos; Count of Molina, Infante Francisco de Paula of Spain, María Isabella of Spain, Maria Luisa, Maria Luisa; Duchess of Lucca, Maria Teresa of Spain\n\nchildren: Infanta Luisa Fernanda; Duchess of Montpensier, Infanta María Isabel Luisa of Spain, Isabella II of Spain, Maria Isabel de Borbón; Infanta de Espa, unnamed daughter de Borbón\n\nBorn Country: Spain\n\nDied on: September 29, 1833\n\nplace of death: Madrid, Spain\n\nFounder/Co-Founder: Museo Nacional Del Prado\n\nMore Facts\n\nawards: Knights of the Order of the Holy Spirit\n\nKnight in the order of Saint-Michel\n\nKnight of the Order of the Golden Fleece\n\nOrder of St. Andrew"
