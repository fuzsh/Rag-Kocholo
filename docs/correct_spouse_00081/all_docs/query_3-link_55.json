        "text": "Is Tony Parker ready to wed again? Maybe, according to Twitter. During a live chat on the social media site on Wednesday, June 26, the 31-year-old basketball player hinted that he and girlfriend Axelle Francine may have gotten engaged.\n\nResponding to a fan's question about his favorite thing to do to unwind after a game, Parker tweeted, \"Spend time with my fiance [sic]. #TissotTimeOut.\" (Tissot is a Swiss watchmaker; Parker is one of the brand's ambassadors, along with NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, and was doing the Q&A in connection with the company.)\n\nIf the athlete is indeed engaged, his upcoming trip down the aisle would be his second. He was previously wed to actress Eva Longoria; the couple filed for divorce in November 2010 after three years of marriage and finalized their split a few months later in January 2011.\n\nSpeaking to Us Weekly about his two-year relationship with Francine in February, Parker said he wasn't yet thinking about tying the knot again. \"I just got out of [a marriage], so no,\" he said of his plans. \"Not right now.\""
