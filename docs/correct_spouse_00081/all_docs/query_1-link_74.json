        "text": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- \"Desperate Housewives\" star Eva Longoria's divorce from NBA star Tony Parker was finalized by a Texas court, according to her publicist.\n\nAnderson Group Public Relations issued a short statement confirming the divorce Monday.\n\nThe couple filed for divorce in November after reports surfaced that she found evidence he was cheating with the wife of a fellow San Antonio Spurs player. She filed in Los Angeles and he filed in Bexar County, Texas.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that after seven years together, Eva and I have decided to divorce,\" Parker said in a statement at the time. \"We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness.\"\n\nLongoria issued a similarly worded statement a day later."
