        "text": "Despite denying divorce allegations on Tuesday, Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria Parker has filed for legal separation from her husband, NBA player Tony Parker, according to People magazine. TMZ initially reported on Tuesday that the San Antonio Spurs star filed papers in Texas after three years of marriage, but Longoria actually filed documents in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday morning, citing “irreconcilable differences,” according to People magazine. The couple signed a prenuptial agreement a month before their wedding three years ago and then updated it two years later. According to the divorce papers, Longoria is seeking spousal support from Parker, who allegedly admitted to inappropriately text messaging a mutual female friend of the couple for nearly a year, Us Weekly exclusively revealed."
