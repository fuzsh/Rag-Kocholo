        "text": "The initial reaction of Eva Longoria, upon her engagement? Shock.\n\n“I was heading home from a long day on the (Desperate Housewives) set,” the actress told People magazine. He had been playing in Utah, so I was just shocked to see him in L.A. I thought it was so weird, sort of, ‘Why are you here? What’s going on? Oh my God! It’s happening!’ “\n\nAnd then it happened: at Longoria’s home in the early-morning hours, surrounded by rose petals and candles, Tony Parker fell to one knee ï¿½” “I’m a traditional guy,” he says ï¿½” and, having already told both of their families, popped the question.\n\nEva said she “cried [her] eyes out” and was especially impressed by how nervous Parker was.\n\nThe NBA player, meanwhile, was probably just thankful Mario Lopez wasn’t in his lady’s bed.\n\nBeverly Hills jewelry designer Jean Dousset, a friend of the couple, designed Longoria’s five-carat-plus emerald-cut diamond ring with Parker. It boasts 247 accenting diamonds. That’s almost as many diamonds as hot guys Jordana Brewster has dated.\n\nNaturally, it didn’t take the actress long to start spreading the news among her Wisteria Lane neighbors."
