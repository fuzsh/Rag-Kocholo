        "text": "Mark Travis John Sanchez (born November 11, 1986) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at the University of Southern California (USC), and was drafted by the New York Jets in the first round (fifth overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. A backup quarterback during his first three years at USC, Sanchez rose to prominence in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback John David Booty; he also became popular within the community due to his Mexican-American heritage. He was named the starter in 2008, and led USC to a 12â€“1 record and won the Rose Bowl against Penn State. Although USC coach Pete Carroll and many scouts considered him too inexperienced, Sanchez entered the 2009 NFL Draft and was selected by the Jets in the first round. Despite a subpar first season, Sanchez led the Jets to the AFC Championship Game, a losing effort to the Indianapolis Colts, becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first playoff game and the second to win two playoff games. In his second season, Sanchez again led the Jets to the AFC Championship Game, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers; he joined Ben Roethlisberger as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the conference championship in their first two seasons in the league. The next two seasons would be a regression for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs, and he was eventually replaced towards the end of the 2012 season by Greg McElroy. Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury during the preseason in 2013; he was released after the season concluded and was subsequently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles. When Eagles starter Nick Foles went down with an injury, Sanchez started the second half of the season and set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating. Following his time with the Eagles, he served a backup for the Dallas Cowboys, Chicago Bears, and Washington Redskins before retiring after the 2018 season.\n\nTony Parker, best known for his prolific career in professional basketball, was born William Anthony Parker Jr. on May 17, 1982, in Bruges, Belgium. The son of a professional basketball player and a Dutch model, Parker spent his early years in Europe before moving to the United States to pursue his own career in sports. He demonstrated an innate talent for the game from an early age, honing his skills in France's INSEP academy and making his professional debut with Paris Basket Racing when he was just 17. Parker's exceptional talent caught the attention of NBA scouts, leading to his selection by the San Antonio Spurs as the 28th pick in the 2001 NBA draft. Playing point guard, Parker quickly established himself as one of the league's premier players. His swift and strategic playing style earned him several accolades, including four NBA championships (2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014) and the prestigious NBA Finals MVP award in 2007. He also represented France in international competitions, contributing significantly to the team's gold medal win at the 2013 EuroBasket tournament. Off the court, Parker has cultivated a diverse range of interests. Passionate about hip-hop music since his youth, he released a French-language rap album titled TP in 2007. He also ventured into entrepreneurship, investing in France's ASVEL Basketball Club and later serving as its president. In addition, Parker shows a deep commitment to philanthropy through his self-named foundation, which supports various charitable causes."
