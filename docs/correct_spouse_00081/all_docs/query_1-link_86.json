Even if this is a wee bit tacky and they could have held out for more money/ a more classy mag.\n\nWe couldn't be closer to heaven? How about when the gay scandal erupts in 3 months or less?\n\nI give their marriage 6 months and thats it\n\nAgreed. And then it's pass the popcorn time, ha.\n\nThe man's wearing a fucking cravat. If that doesn't spell gay, I don't know what does.\n\n. . . wtf?\n\nHe's French, not gay. Both know how to dress.\n\nshe's totally standing on a box in that picture.\n\nlmao i know huh\n\nshe looks like a mouse.\n\nsomeone go get a mouse trap!\n\nAgreed. Her face is very rodent-like. I think it's the teeth and the eyes...\n\ni just wanted to comment and say your icon is awesome\n\nDon't care for her, but she looked pretty. He always looks a bit \"special\" to me.\n\nlmfao yes he does.\n\nHow did she get so much publicity for her wedding? She's on a show that hasn't been remotely good since the first season. I don't know how she created such a media storm over it.\n\nShe's been a media sweetheart since the beginning though. Who cares if she's got a good show or not.\n\nthey might as well not even have him in the photo\n\nhahaha exactly\n\nlol seriously\n\nI wonder if they're into CDD\n\nTheir marriage will last longer ~*\n\nhttp://www.christiandomesticdiscipline.com/\n\nlulz\n\nhahahah\n\nOh, for fuck's sake. I think my sister and her hub are secretly into that shit!\n\nahahaha whatever floats ur boat, bb\n\nI am very interesting in hearing what lead you to this conclusion.\n\nRe: although... - tourbillonbleu Expand\n\nRe: although... - damnediam Expand\n\nRe: although... - damnediam Expand\n\nboring\n\nis it sad that i want their marriage to fail?\n\nthey're making such a fucking deal out of it.\n\nnobody cares!\n\nthere is this girl looking at perez hilton's site and really getting into it. I wanna be all \"bb, don't go there, he is evil\" but she don't look friendly.\n\nThere is also a white trash guy outside winking at me despite his crackwhore being next to him. This is unrelated though.\n\nStart winking at the crackwhore.\n\nlol\n\ni dare you to be like \"oh no they didnt is so much better\" or slide her hte addy be like \"get a clue\"\n\nRe: so as I sit in a coffeshop wasting time - ecctv Expand\n\nRe: so as I sit in a coffeshop wasting time - tourbillonbleu Expand\n\nRe: so as I sit in a coffeshop wasting time - damnediam Expand\n\nJust really casually be like \"Oh, is that Perez Hilton?
