        "text": "Tony Parker is heading to divorce court with Eva Longoria -- but he's coping with it on the basketball court.\n\nThe NBA star opened up about the dissolution of his marriage, talking about the difficulty and how he's moving on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The most important thing is to stay strong mentally, even if these are very difficult times,\" Parker told France's Le Parisien newspaper (via People). \"I've taken refuge in basketball because that's what I've done best since my youth.\"\n\nIt's not just shooting the ball that gets him through -- he relies on the \"support of [my] teammates, coaches and San Antonio,\" along with, \"my family. My whole family has been around me through this.\"\n\nParker and Longoria split amidst rumors that he cheated -- or at least had an inappropriate relationship -- with Erin Barry, the now ex-wife of his former teammate, Brent Barry, though Erin Barry denies it.\n\nPerhaps basketball really is helping him -- Parker is putting up his best stat line in three years, and is leading the San Antonio Spurs to the best record in basketball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Longoria, it looks like she may be rebounding, so to speak, with Penelope Cruz's brother Eduardo."
