        "text": "NEW YORK - Tony Parker says he's not a double dribbler. The San Antonio Spurs star and his wife, Eva Longoria, issued a statement Wednesday night defending their marriage against claims by a French model that she had an affair with Parker in September.\n\n\"I love my wife,\" Parker, 25, said in the statement from Longoria's spokeswoman, Liza Anderson. \"She's the best thing in my life, and I have never been happier.\"\n\n\"Tony has been nothing short of the perfect husband,\" said the 32-year-old actress, who stars on ABC's \"Desperate Housewives.\"\n\nAlexandra Paressant made the allegations in an interview with celebrity gossip Web site X17.\n\nAnderson said in a separate statement Wednesday the claims were \"completely, 100 percent false and untrue. All high-profile couples fall victim to these sorts of things in the course of their relationships.\"\n\nParker and Longoria were married in a civil ceremony July 6 in Paris. The next day, a priest married them in a church across from the Louvre Museum, followed by an exclusive bash at a storied French chateau."
