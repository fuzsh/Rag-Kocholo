IN THIS ISSUE: EVA LONGORIA'S NEW ROMANCE WITH PENÉLOPE CRUZ'S BROTHER\n\n\"The most important thing is to stay strong mentally, even if these are very difficult times,\" Tony told France's Le Parisien newspaper (via Huffington Post). \"I've taken refuge in basketball because that's what I've done best since my youth.\"\n\nAnd he's looking to his friends and family to help him.\n\nTony says he relies on \"support of my teammates, coaches and San Antonio,\" along with \"my family. My whole family has been around me through this.\"\n\nOK! GALLERY: EVA LONGORIA STEPS OUT ON THE TOWN\n\nWhile Tony is focusing on his basketball, Eva, as OK! first reported, has been enjoying a new romance with Penélope Cruz's brother, Eduardo Cruz.\n\nTony and Eva decided to call it quits while reports surfaced that Tony alleged cheated on Eva with Erin Barry, his former teammate, Brent Barry's wife."
