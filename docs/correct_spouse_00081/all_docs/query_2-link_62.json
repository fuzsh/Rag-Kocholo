        "text": "Eva Longoria and Tony Parker are still talking to each other, but the conversations have taken an ugly turn, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned.\n\nParker has avoided saying anything negative publicly about his estranged wife, but privately there have been heated conversations, a source close to the situation told RadarOnline.com.\n\nThe NBA star is unhappy that Eva asked for spousal support in her divorce papers and angry that she told the world he cheated and exchanged inappropriate texts with a teammate's wife.\n\nLongoria wanted to portray herself as the wronged party in the marriage the source said. \"That's why she revealed that she found Tony texting with another woman and that's how the cheating issue suddenly was in play.\"\n\nTony was sexting with Erin Barry, the wife of his ex teammate Brent Barry.\n\nAs RadarOnline.com revealed exclusively, Tony left open an electronic program where her information was secretly stored and Eva found it.\n\n\"Eva went to her good friend Mario Lopez from 'Extra' and told him about Tony's indiscretions and Tony was angry and hurt,\" the source said. \"He confronted her about it and she tried to make an excuse but really what could she say? She wants to be seen as the victim here and she's throwing dirt on Tony.\"\n\nParker was advised to file his own divorce papers in Texas and he did so late last week. Now a fight over the venue of the divorce is looming and millions of dollars could be up for grab."
