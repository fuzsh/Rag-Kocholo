        "text": "A shocker hit the Internet early this afternoon. News reports are speculating that San Antonio Spurs all-star Tony Parker and wife Eva Longoria are calling it quits.\n\nThe rumor first surfaced on TMZ.com, claiming that Parker filed for divorced yesterday (Nov. 14) in Texas. However, Eva’s representative is denying all of the talk, explaining that Eva’s hubby doesn’t even have a divorce lawyer.\n\nUPDATE via POP EATER:\n\nTMZ quickly corrected themselves, admitting that they received some bad information from two clerks at the Bexar County Courthouse in Texas, who claimed the case was filed and sealed by a family law judge.\n\n“But Eva’s rep tells us Tony did not file and does not even have a divorce lawyer,” the site now says. “Another clerk at the courthouse now tells us she’s in charge of sealed cases and says no such case has crossed her desk.”\n\nDespite the denial, a source told PEOPLE that the Longoria was “totally and completely blindsided” by reports appearing this week of infidelity by her NBA star husband. The source adds that the ‘Desperate Housewives’ star plans to file divorce papers on Wednesday.\n\n—Niki McGloster\n\nRELATED:"
