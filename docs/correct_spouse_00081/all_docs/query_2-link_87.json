With rumors circulating that Tony cheated on Eva with Erin Barry, the estranged wife of his San Antonio Spurs teammate Brent Barry, Parker’s PR team adamantly denies their relationship was ever physical. Sources connected with Tony claim he only had a “sexting relationship” with Erin. A source told Radaronline.com: “Look, any wife is going to be upset with what Tony did, but he swears the relationship with Erin stopped there and they never had sex.” Brent Barry has filed for divorce, according to Radar.\n\nOriginally Published: November 19, 2010 at 12:00 a.m."
