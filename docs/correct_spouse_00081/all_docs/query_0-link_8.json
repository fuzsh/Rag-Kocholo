Longoria told Redbook in 2016:\n\nThere was never any resentment, because I saw how hard my mother worked and all she did for my sister [with special needs], and I wanted to do whatever I could to help. We all did.[7]\n\nShe was raised Roman Catholic.[8] She did not speak Spanish growing up, and did not learn the language until 2009.[9] While in high school, she worked at a Wendy's restaurant part-time for three years to help earn money for her quinceañera.[10][7] Longoria previously told the press how her years in fast food as a teen shaped her work ethic, saying \"I couldn't wait to get to work and make my own money.\" Longoria earned her Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology at Texas A&M University-Kingsville.[11][12] At that time (1998), she also won the title of Miss Corpus Christi USA.[13] After completing college, she entered a talent contest that led her to Los Angeles; and shortly thereafter, was spotted and signed by a theatrical agent.[14] While auditioning for roles, she worked as a headhunter for four years.[15] Longoria has publicly credited Jennifer Lopez as being an inspiration to her early in her career. \"Jennifer broke down so many doors so that we could walk through them,\" she told the magazine People. \"And she kicked them down.

She accompanied a border patrol in Arizona and has immersed herself in the issues to understand the Mexican and the U.S. points of view.[102] She has described Arizona's SB 1070 immigration law as unconstitutional.[103]\n\nIn 2012, Longoria was one of seven Californians named to the post of co-chair of Barack Obama's reelection campaign.[104] On September 6, she spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention where she endorsed President Obama's reelection.[105] In May 2014, she initiated the Latino Victory Project to raise funds for candidates and efforts to get out the vote.[106] An executive producer of the documentaries The Harvest and Food Chains, she is a supporter of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.[107]\n\nIn 2014, Longoria endorsed Marianne Williamson for California's 33rd congressional district.[108] In 2018, Longoria endorsed Beto O'Rourke for Senate against Senator Ted Cruz,[109] as well as Collin Allred for Texas's 32nd congressional district against then-incumbent Rep.

On November 30, 2006, they became engaged,[116] and married in a civil service on July 6, 2007 at a Paris city hall. They had a Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois Church in Paris on July 7, 2007.[117] On November 17, 2010, Longoria filed for divorce from Parker in Los Angeles, citing \"irreconcilable differences\".[118] In the divorce petition, she requested that her family name be restored, and sought spousal support from Parker.[119] The couple had a prenuptial agreement signed in June 2007, a month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009.[120]\n\nLongoria told her friend Mario Lopez that she had discovered hundreds of text messages from another woman on her husband's phone.[121] Extra identified the other woman as Erin Barry, then-wife of Brent Barry, Parker's former teammate, and revealed that the Barrys were also divorcing.[122] In light of her divorce, Longoria canceled her scheduled appearance at the 2010 American Music Awards.[121] On November 19, 2010, Parker filed for divorce from Longoria in Bexar County, Texas,[123] on the grounds of \"discord or conflict of personalities\", establishing a legal battle over where the case would be heard. Unlike Longoria's divorce petition, Parker's did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties would \"enter into an agreement for the division of their estate\".[124] The divorce was finalized in Texas on January 28, 2011, the same day Longoria's lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition. Longoria later said, \"I didn't realize it at the time with Tony, but I had become my own version of a desperate housewife.\"[125]\n\nOn December 13, 2015, Longoria reported her engagement to Mexican businessman José Antonio \"Pepe\" Bastón Patiño,[126] then the president of Televisa, the largest media company in Latin America.[127][128] They met on a blind date arranged by a mutual friend in Mexico City; at the time, Bastón did not know who Longoria was, and initially declined the invitation to meet her because of his busy schedule.[129] They were married in Mexico on May 21, 2016.[130][131]\n\nOn December 19, 2017, it was reported that Longoria was pregnant with her first child.[132] She gave birth to a son in 2018.[133][134][135]\n\nAccording to research done in 2010 by Harvard professor and Faces of America host Henry Louis Gates Jr., Longoria's oldest identifiable Spanish immigrant ancestor is her ninth great-grandfather, Lorenzo Suárez de Longoria (b. Oviedo, 1592), who was a colonist of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (modern-day Mexico) in 1603. His family was based in a small village called Llongoria, Belmonte de Miranda, Asturias, Spain. Longoria is the Castillanized form of this Asturian-language surname.\n\nIn 1767, her seventh great-grandfather received almost 4,000 acres (16 km2) of land along the Rio Grande in a land grant from King Charles III of Spain. The family retained this land for more than a century. After the US-Mexican border was moved southwards in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War, the land ended up on the American side of the border. Her family had to deal with the influx of United States settlers following the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War.[136]\n\nAccording to DNA testing, Longoria's overall genetic ancestry is 70% European, 27% Indigenous American, and 3% African.[137] A computer analysis of the DNA results of Gates's dozen guests showed that Longoria has the same genetic haplogroup as cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who is of Chinese heritage.[137] As women have two X chromosomes and no Y chromosome, Longoria did not inherit her father's Y-DNA, but she did inherit her mother's mitochondrial DNA (genetic information passed from mother to child). Longoria's mtDNA belongs to the Haplogroup A2, making her a direct descendant of a Native American woman, a Mayan from the territory of Mexico long before it was Mexico. Her ancestors include many other Maya on both sides of her family.[138][139]\n\nLongoria identifies as a \"Texican\"—a Mexican-American Texan.[138]\n\nMain article: Eva Longoria filmography\n\nLongoria has over 60 credits to her name within film and television.\n\nAward Year Category Work Result Ref.
