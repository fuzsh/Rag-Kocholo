        "text": "Fans expect to see this glamorous People's Choice winner at a Hollywood premiere or playing the spoiled Gabrielle on Desperate Housewives. But what about in the kitchen? Turns out, the\n\nTexas-born actress loves to cook at home with her husband, Tony Parker, the San Antonio Spurs basketball star. She also co-owns Beso, Latin-style steakhouses in L.A. and Las Vegas, where the menu includes tortilla soup made from her own recipe.\n\nWhat's the idea behind Beso?\n\nIt's an extension of my own kitchen. I like to include my recipes, whether for an appetizer, a soup, or a main course. I think passing down\n\nrecipes is a great family tradition; so is spending time with family and friends around a good meal. By opening the restaurants, I'm able to share those traditions with so many others.\n\nCan you describe the focus of Beso's cuisine?\n\nWe like to bring the best of many countries to one dinner table. Beso Vegas has some amazing new entrées, but we're really known for our steaks and the different ways we prepare them.\n\nWhat food reminds you of home?\n\nGuacamole! Growing up, we had avocado trees, so we always had fresh, organic avocados. We also had a lemon tree. Lemon is the secret ingredient in good guacamole. People always use lime, and it alters the taste dramatically.\n\nAny favorite foods from your childhood?\n\nFrijoles were a staple side dish for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My mom would cook a pot of beans that lasted a week. We'd refry them, puree them, eat them as a meal. To this day, I love beans for breakfast.\n\nYou've traveled a lot. Where's the best food?\n\nAll of France; there isn't one particular spot. I can have a great meal at a fancy restaurant or go to a street vendor who makes crepes and have an equally great experience. In France, it's all about the enjoyment of food, not the maintenance of eating.\n\nWhere was your most memorable meal?\n\nIn Tuscany. Tony and I jumped into a restaurant to avoid the rain and ended up eating one of the best meals of my life. I was vegan at the time and had a serving of white beans that felt like an entire meal. I still\n\nsearch the world to replicate it.\n\nIs there a favorite recipe you make at home?\n\nMy chicken tortilla soup. Everyone thinks this recipe was a family tradition, but to tell the truth, I found it in an old cookbook and have altered it over the years. We never had it growing up, and my mom\n\nmakes me show her how to make it for my dad.\n\nDo you have any favorite comfort foods?\n\nFideo [thin noodles]. I call it Mexican pasta. It's a great alternative to Spanish rice and mixes well with refried beans. It's easy to make, but it tastes like it took hours.\n\nWhat would people be surprised to find in your kitchen?\n\nA wooden rolling pin. I use it to make fresh flour tortillas.\n\nOkay, last question—guilty pleasure?\n\nFried chicken. I know. But it's so good!"
