        "text": "Eva Longoria thought she would be married when she and rest of her \"Desperate Housewifes\" stars leave Wisteria Lane later this year.\n\nBut three years after her marriage to Spurs' star Tony Parker, the 37-year-old actress filed for divorce, citing \"irreconcilable differences\".\n\n\"I think I handled it as gracefully as I could,\" Longoria said in an interview Thursday with Katie Couric on \"Good Morning America\". \"And it was painful. But life goes on, and I always said I hold on to love and not the loss.\"\n\nLongoria also said she wasn't pleased with the relentless tabloid scrutiny surrounding the breakup.\n\n\"I think the press wanted me to hate him and wanted to villanize him. And I don't. And I didn't.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Longoria is reportedly now dating a Los Angeles Dodgers' star.\n\nLongoria was spotted at a Dodgers exhibition game earlier this week, and according to a former Major League general manager who now works for ESPN, Longoria left the stadium with Dodgers all-star Matt Kemp.\n\nESPN analyst Jim Bowden reported seeing Longoria and Kemp leave together and tweeted, \"LA Times headline, \"Dodgers win 4-1, but Matt Kemp is struggling\" moments later he leaves park w/ Eva Longoria..Struggling? oh at the plate!\" @JimBowdenESPNxm.\n\nLarry Brown Sports reported Longoria recently confirmed she and Eduardo Cruz broke up last month.\n\nKemp dated pop singer Rihanna from December 2009 to November 2010."
