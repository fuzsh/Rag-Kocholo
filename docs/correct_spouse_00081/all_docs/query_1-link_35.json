        "text": "Coachella 2024 is coming to an end, and former NBA star Tony Parker seems to have made the most of it. While the Frenchman hasn’t had the most success in his personal life, things seem to be getting better now. The 41-year-old shared a series of Instagram stories from the Festival. However, the one that may have piqued everyone’s interest could easily be Parker’s photo with his seemingly new love interest.\n\nOne of the IG stories by the ex-San Antonio Spurs star featured his photo with actor/model Agathe Teyssier. “It took 41 years but it was worth it… @agatheteyssier”, read the caption to his IG story. His other IG stories of the music festival included Parker enjoying the music night, celebrating Sofia Lefebvre’s birthday, who seems to be one of his friends, and enjoying the fireworks.\n\nHowever, the story involving Parker and Teyssier is one that may cause actual fireworks in media headlines. As per reports, Parker was dating French tennis player Alize Lim somewhere around 2021 but they parted ways at the beginning of this year. It seems the 4x NBA champion has found what he has been looking for for 41 years in Agathe.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHowever, this is not the first time Tony Parker has found the love of his life in his 41-year lifespan. In fact, it seems to have happened quite a few times for him. Prior to dating Alize Lim, Parker had been married and divorced twice.\n\nWhy did Tony Parker’s marriage fall apart?\n\nThe ex-Spurs star’s first wife was Eva Longoria, whom he got married to back in 2007. However, Eva filed for a divorce just after three years of marriage. While the divorce petition mentioned the reason for divorce to be ‘irreconcilable differences’, Eva later alleged Tony had been unfaithful. Parker had stated that the divorce was difficult for him and took an emotional toll on him.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“It’s true, it was a difficult and painful experience in my life,” he stated during The Conversation on Canal a few years ago. However, he moved on to a new chapter of his life with his marriage to French journalist Axelle Francine. But even this relationship ran its course after 6 years."
