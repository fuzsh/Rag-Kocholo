        "text": "A new documentary The Final Shot, which focuses on French-American basketball player Tony Parker, just dropped on Netflix. The synopsis reads: \"This film examines the background and career of Tony Parker, whose determination led him to become arguably the greatest French basketball player.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough The Final Shot, which includes interviews with basketball greats including Kobe Bryant and David Robinson, is mainly about Parker's career, it also offers glimpses into his personal life. As you may remember, Parker was married to Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria from 2007 to 2011. According to People, Parker and Longoria first met in November 2004 but didn't officially confirm their relationship until August 2005. After a brief split in September 2006, the couple announced their engagement in November. They tied the knot in July 2007 in Paris.\n\nParker and Longoria made it official in a small civil ceremony with about 40 family members and friends, and the following day they held a lavish wedding at Eglise Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois (via USA Today). The star-studded guest list included Victoria Beckham, Felicity Huffman, William H. Macy, Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and a number of Parker's San Antonio Spurs teammates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThree years later after their Paris wedding, Eva Longoria filed for divorce in November 2010, as reported by ESPN. She cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the reason for the split. Almost immediately, rumors that Paker had been unfaithful to Longoria began to circulate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the time, People reported that Longoria told her friend Mario Lopez that she found hundreds of text messages on her husband's phone, which were allegedly from Erin Barry, the wife of one of Parker's teammates. \"She is devastated, she wants us all to know that,\" Lopez said at the time. \"But she's strong.\" Parker admitted to \"sexting\" with Barry, but denied having a physical relationship with her (via TMZ). Parker and Longoria's divorce was finalized in January 2011. In 2015, Parker told Hello! Magazine that going through a divorce in the public eye was a \"difficult and painful experience.\"\n\nHowever, both Parker and Longoria have moved on and found happiness with new partners. Parker married French journalist Axelle Francine in 2014 and the couple shares two sons. In 2016, Longoria also tied the knot again, this time with businessman José Bastón. The couple has one son, Santiago.\n\nAdvertisement"
