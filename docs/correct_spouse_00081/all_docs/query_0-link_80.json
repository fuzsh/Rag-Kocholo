The pair were seen kissing and cuddling before Tony took off for a sail in a power boat around the bay. Eva, who wore a flowing navy blue dress, kissed Tony several times while holding his face in her hands before, he set off. The actress then watched from the stern of the yacht as he sailed off into the distance.
