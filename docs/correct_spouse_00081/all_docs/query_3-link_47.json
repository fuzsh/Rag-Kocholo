        "text": "Five years after her divorce from NBA player Tony Parker, Eva Longoria is happily engaged to businessman José \"Pepe\" Bastón. But in a new interview with People, the 40-year-old actress says she was just as happy those years she spent single.\n\n\"Some people said, 'Oh. You don't want to be alone.' And I said, 'I'm not alone! I'm with myself. And myself is fabulous,'\" the former \"Desperate Housewives\" actress told People in their latest issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLongoria even joined her friends on a couples trip to Europe as the sole single person.\n\n\"People went, 'Aw. Did you feel weird?' And I said, 'No! I had so much fun! These are my best friends,' \" she told the mag. \"It's not like you change because you became a single person. It's not like you become an alien.\"\n\nLongoria -- who was married to Parker for three years before splitting in 2010 -- was romantically linked to a few people following the divorce, including Penélope Cruz's brother Eduardo and entrepreneur Ernesto Arguello. But waiting to get truly serious with someone paid off for the TV star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I learned to be content on my own,\" Longoria told People. \"I think I needed that to be ready for what I have with Pepe.\"\n\nLongoria and Baston -- the president of Latin American media company Televisa -- began dating in 2013. Earlier this month, the actress announced her engagement on Instagram, with a sweet photo of her and Baston sharing a kiss in Dubai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Ummmm so this happened....#Engaged #Dubai #Happiness,\" the \"Telenovela\" star captioned the pic.\n\nIn an interview with Parade magazine last year, Longoria gushed about her future hubby.\n\n\"You know, in general, I'm attracted to humor and intellect in a man,\" she said. When asked whether Baston, 47, possessed those traits, she replied, \"Sure. Let me tell you, I'm very lucky in my life.\""
