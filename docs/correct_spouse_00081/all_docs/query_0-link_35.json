        "text": "When it comes to the question of spousal support, Eva Longoria has drawn the line in the sand--or rather, checked the box.\n\nThe \"Desperate Housewives\" star, 35, filed for divorce from her husband of three years, San Antonio Spurs player Tony Parker, 28, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" In the papers she filed in Los Angeles Superior Court Wednesday, Longoria marked the box indicating that she wants to receive spousal support from Parker--but not pay any to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven that Parker has a multi-million-dollar NBA contract, and lucrative sponsorships with athletic companies, her request may well be granted (Longoria also asked that both parties cover their own legal fees).\n\nThe couple, who married in 2007, have been together for 7 years and have no kids--which can often be a factor in spousal support decisions."
