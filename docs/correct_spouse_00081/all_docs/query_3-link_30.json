        "text": "Eva Longoria and Tony Parker’s relationship may have ended more than five years ago, but their divorce seems to still be fresh in the NBA star’s mind.\n\nIn an interview with French television show Conversation Secrète, the San Antonio Spurs point guard opened up about his four-year marriage to Longoria, admitting that walking away from the relationship was difficult.\n\n“It’s not easy to leave a relationship, because when I get involved in something, I want to do it well,” he said, as translated by ContactMusic.com.\n\nLongoria, 40, and Parker, 33, married in 2007 after more than two years of dating. Longoria filed for divorce in California in 2010 citing irreconcilable differences, while Parker filed his own divorce proceedings in Texas.\n\nAt the time, she revealed to “Extra” host Mario Lopez that she has found hundreds of text messages from another woman on Parker's cellphone.\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in early 2011. Both stars have since moved on with their personal lives.\n\nLongoria is dating Mexican media mogul José Bastón while Parker married French journalist Axelle Francine last year. They have a son together.\n\nIn the Conversation Secrète interview, Parker said having his personal life exposed to the Hollywood spotlight was difficult for him.\n\n“The exposure, I could not control,” he admitted. “This is the world we live in today – everything is on the Internet and social network sites. I never paid attention to what people said. Hollywood is another world, on another level.”"
