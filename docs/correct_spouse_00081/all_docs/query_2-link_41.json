        "text": "Congratulations to Tony Parker and his wife Axelle Francine. The couple have welcomed their second son, a baby boy. The French basketball star announced the news on Twitter, also choosing to reveal his newborn's name.\n\n\"My son Liam and his mommy are doing well, so glad to be a daddy for the second time,\" he wrote.\n\nTony, 34, and his journalist wife Axelle married in August 2014 in San Antonio, Texas. The newlyweds had welcomed their first child, a son Josh, three months earlier.\n\nTony Parker and Axelle Francine have named their second son Liam\n\nFans are hoping that the sportsman will post a photo of his baby boy soon; he regularly shares snaps of his elder son Josh on Instagram.\n\nTony was previously married to former Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria from 2007 to 2011. In November 2011 the actress filed divorce papers citing \"irreconcilable differences\". Soon after, infidelity rumours circulated, with reports that Tony had been unfaithful.\n\nThe actress, 40, reportedly confided to friend Mario Lopez – host of TV show Extra – that she found \"hundreds of texts\" from another woman on her husband's phone.\n\nThe couple already have a two-year-old son Josh\n\nSpeaking about his divorce during The Conversation on Canal +, Tony recalled how the split had left him heartbroken.\n\n\"It's true, it was a difficult and painful experience in my life,\" he said. \"It's not easy to leave a relationship, because when I get involved in something, I want to do well.\n\n\"The exposure, I could not control. This is the world we live in today; everything is on the Internet and on social network sites. I never paid attention to what people said. Hollywood is another world, on another level.\"\n\nTony and Eva Longoria were married for three years\n\nWhile Tony has been building a new life with his wife Axelle, Eva has also moved on. The Latina beauty recently married businessman Pepe Baston in the couple's native Mexico, in a wedding exclusively covered by HELLO! magazine.\n\nEva called on her best friend Victoria Beckham to design a grand total of three wedding dresses for her May lakeside wedding."
