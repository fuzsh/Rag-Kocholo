        "text": "PARIS (AP) - The mayor of Paris pronounced them husband and wife, but Tony Parker and Eva Longoria aren't finished tying the knot.\n\nOn Saturday, the NBA champion and star of \"Desperate Housewives\" are exchanging vows in a cathedral dating to the 12th century and throwing an exclusive, star-studded bash in a storied French chateau.\n\nThe two married in a civil ceremony in Paris on Friday, before a modest crowd of about 40 guests, including French soccer player Thierry Henry and some of Parker's teammates from the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nParker, a 25-year-old who was born in Belgium and grew up in France, asked Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe to officiate. Parker's friends translated when Delanoe gave a speech calling the basketball star a model in the fight against racism.\n\n\"I married a friend to the woman he loves. It was touching, moving, very warm and at the same time very relaxed,\" Delanoe said on RTL radio Saturday.\n\nAnd romantic, he added: \"They kiss all the time.\"\n\nHe praised Longoria's choice of dresses and designer - she wore a pink Chanel mini dress on her way into the town hall, but changed into a white dress in the district mayor's office. French law requires a civil ceremony even when couples marry in a church.\n\nSaturday's events were likely to be much more elaborate - and much more strictly guarded.\n\nPolice cordons circled the cathedral where the couple was to wed in a religious ceremony, across from the Louvre Museum in central Paris. Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois, which once served French royals, was closed to visitors throughout the gray, drizzly day.\n\nThe couple and their entourage have given very few details about the nuptials, but media reports said they were to follow the religious service with a bash at Vaux-le-Vicomte, a 17th century chateau 34 miles southeast of Paris.\n\nRumored guests include Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, movie stars Catherine Zeta-Jones and husband Michael Douglas, and Longoria's \"Desperate Housewives\" co-stars.\n\nLe Parisien daily reported that fellow \"housewives\" Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman and Nicolette Sheridan arrived Friday at Paris' Bourget airport in a private jet. Marcia Cross, who stars in the series as persnickety Bree and recently gave birth to twins, is not expected to attend the wedding."
