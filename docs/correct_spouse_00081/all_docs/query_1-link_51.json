        "text": "Eva Longoria proved that she is still friendly toward her ex-husband's professional basketball team despite a sportscaster's sharp Twitter comment from a television personality.\n\nThe \"Desperate Housewives\" star was married to San Antonio Spurs player Tony Parker from 2007-2011, but the pair split after the athlete's infidelity.\n\nEven after admitting her struggle to cope with the divorce, Longoria always maintained her support for the Spurs- and Thursday's game was no exception.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\n\"Go Spurs Go! I say Spurs in 5,\" the actress posted to Twitter during last night's game between the Spurs and the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nIn response to her post, sportscaster Dick Vitale directed a tweet to Longoria, reading, \"your ex is AWESOME BABY-Mr Clutch!\"\n\nThe famed basketball sportscaster's comment made waves with Longoria's fans, with many expressing anger.\n\n\"That's a bit uncomfortable,\" wrote Chip.\n\nBrian posted, \"Eva Longoria, much respect after that tweet.\"\n\n\"Dick is his name, cheating is Tony's game. Eva Longoria is above both,\" defended Twitter user Spencer.\n\nOther Twitter users thought Vitale's tweet was humorous.\n\n\"Tweet of the night,\" wrote Delrico.\n\n\"Classic! Dick V you are a funny man for this one,\" Nolan added.\n\nMeanwhile, Longoria recently recalled the dark period she endured following her divorce two years ago. Overcome with sadness at the time, the star recounted that her health rapidly declined.\n\n\"I was not eating. I was depressed. I was sad. My diet was coffee,\" the 38-year-old actress told Dr. Mehmet Oz on \"The Dr. Oz Show.\"\n\n\"I didn't know I was depressed,\" Longoria added of the hardship. \"I mean, I knew it was a sad moment in my life, but I wouldn't categorize myself as depressed.\"\n\nFinally, Longoria's lack of energy led her to seek a health professional.\n\n\"I went to the doctor to get some blood tests because I said something's wrong,\" Longoria continued. \"And I was just depleted of every vitamin. He said it's as if somebody took a straw and sucked everything out of your body.\"\n\nBack to a healthy weight, Longoria has also returned to the dating scene following her divorce. The actress was linked to Mark Sanchez earlier this year, but is now believed to be dating her \"Ready For Love\" co-star Ernesto Arguello."
