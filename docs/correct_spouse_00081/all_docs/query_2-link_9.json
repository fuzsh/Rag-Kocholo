The couple deny the allegations.

Hundreds of fans gather outside, but their view of the glitterati in attendance is blocked by 10-foot-high wooden panels erected in front of the church.\n\nSeptember 2007: Parker and Longoria are among the chosen few named People magazine's best-dressed couples.\n\nDecember 2007: Parker denies the published claims by a French model that she had an affair with him.
