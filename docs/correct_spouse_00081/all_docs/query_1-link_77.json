        "text": "Eva Longoria is opening up about her divorce from basketball player Tony Parker in the April issue of Allure magazine.\n\nThe \"Desperate Housewives\" star says talking about the breakup from the San Antonio Spurs player makes her \"want to cry\" but she's trying to make the transition \"as gracefully as possible\" and \"without any drama.\"\n\nLongoria turned 36 on Tuesday. She filed for divorce from Parker last November, citing irreconcilable differences. The two were married in July 2007.\n\nShe's now having to \"find new patterns\" in life because she's used to spending her free time watching Parker play.\n\nLongoria also credits the women in her life with getting her through difficult times. She says she \"collects people\" in her life, particularly \"amazing, smart, interesting women.\"\n\nFrom People Magazine:\n\nPeople magazine reported last week that Eva Longoria was seen kissing her new boyfriend Eduardo Cruz during a late lunch at the Chateau Marmont. \"They were kissing for a long time,\" an onlooker said. \"They didn't care that other people were watching them. Eva looked very happy and in love.\"\n\nIt appears that Eva Longoria may be moving on and her ex-husband seems unfazed by it. When asked about the possible relationship between Longoria and Pen√©lope Cruz's brother, Eduardo Cruz, Parker said, \"She can do whatever she wants.\""
