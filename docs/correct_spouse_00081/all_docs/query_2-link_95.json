        "text": "Eva Longoria has opened up about how she felt finding out that her husband Tony Parker had cheated on her. The “Desperate Housewives” actress admits that she did initially question herself upon discovering that Parker had exchanged hundreds of text messages with another woman.\n\n“It wasn’t about who he chose. I mean, I had moments of, ‘Am I not sexy enough? Am I not pretty enough? Am I not smart enough?'” Longoria said during an appearance on the Demi Moore-produced Lifetime series, “The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet,” last night. “But in so many of those questions, I immediately stopped and said, ‘No, don’t start doing that.’ Because you can get stuck in that cycle.”\n\nEVA LONGORIA REFLECTS ON THE END OF ‘DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES’\n\nWhile reports have said Erin Barry, the wife of former NBA player Brent Barry, is the woman who came between Longoria and her husband, both Barry and Parker have denied an affair. Longoria didn’t name names in her interview, but she did say that it took her some time to realize that Parker’s actions were “definitely not about me.”\n\n“Society usually thinks there’s something wrong with the woman. ‘Oh, he cheated on her, so she must not have been sexually satisfying him. She must have been a ball and chain!'” says Longoria. “Why did he have to have a reason to cheat that had do with me? … I am so secure in who I am. I really am! And I’m not conceited. I just think, ‘Wow, okay, that’s the life you want to live.'”\n\nLongoria said that it was hard to confront Parker about his actions while remaining non-judgmental, but that it was important for her to do so.\n\n“Even having the conversation, I really wanted to provide a pillow for him to say and express ‘the why.’ Because I really wanted to know why,” Longoria said. “[I said], ‘I’m not going to judge you. I’m not going to be mad in this moment. I’ll be mad later.’ People say, ‘What grace!’ And it wasn’t that. I really wanted to know, and if you genuinely want to get something out of somebody, you have to not judge.”\n\nWhile Longoria was kind to her ex-husband in the interview, she did get in one good verbal swipe. When asked the best advice she’d ever gotten, Longoria joked, “Don’t marry that basketball player.”"
