        "text": "Tony Parker announced Monday that he and wife Axelle Francine are calling it quits after six years of marriage.\n\n“After nine years together, during which we shared a lot of happiness, and raised two wonderful children, Axelle and I have decided to end our union,” Parker said in a social media statement.\n\n“This separation will be guided by complete mutual respect and the preservation of well-being of our two sons. We’ve decided to make this public now, in order to avoid any rumors or speculation; no further comments will be made at this time in order to respect our privacy,” he continued.\n\nParker, who played 17 seasons with the San Antonio Spurs, met French journalist Francine in 2011, tying the knot three years later. They share two sons, Josh and Liam, born in 2014 and 2016, respectively.\n\nPrior to his romance with Francine, Parker married “Desperate Housewives” alum Eva Longoria in 2007."
