        "text": "Three years after a storybook wedding in a European castle, Eva Longoria filed for divorce yesterday from basketball star Tony Parker.\n\nThe “Desperate Housewives” star’s papers were filed in Los Angeles Superior Court just one day after her rep denied that Parker had done the same in a Texas court.\n\nLongoria is seeking spousal support from Parker, but the documents say each will pay their own legal fees, according to TMZ.\n\nThe petition says their date of separation is still to be determined.\n\nLongoria and Parker signed a prenup on June 21, 2007, and it was amended in June 2009, TMZ reports.\n\nRyan Reynolds has been named “sexiest man alive” by People magazine.\n\nRyan is already riding high. The 34-year-old actor, who’s married to actress Scarlett Johansson, is about to star on-screen as the Green Lantern.\n\nThe Canadian native told People: “The sexiest thing about Canadians is that there’s an inherent ability to be self-deprecating. That has served me well in my career and personal life.”\n\nOther men who’ve had the title include Mel Gibson, John F. Kennedy Jr., Harrison Ford and Richard Gere. George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp have won it twice.\n\nLindsay Lohan‘s parents need to hammer out a truce if her recovery is to progress, sources tell RadaronlineOnline.\n\nAnd while Michael and Dina have battled publicly and privately for years, Lindsay’s treatment team hopes to get them in the same room for some much-needed family counseling, the website reports.\n\nLindsay, 24, is reportedly working on some “very intense issues regarding her family, specifically, Michael and Dina’s contentious relationship.\n\nHer stay in rehab will continue into January.\n\n— lsmith@denverpost.com\n\nMore celebrity headlines"
