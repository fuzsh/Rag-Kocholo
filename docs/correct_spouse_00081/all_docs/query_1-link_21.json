        "text": "\"Desperate Housewives\" star Eva Longoria and basketball player Tony Parker are engaged, her rep confirmed Thursday.\n\n\"I am thrilled to announce that Eva Longoria and Tony Parker, who have been dating steadily for two years, are officially engaged,\" Longoria's rep, Liza Anderson, said in a statement given to the The ShowBuzz. \"Tony flew into Los Angeles last night after his game and surprised Eva at her home as she got off work. The proposal was romantic and perfect.\"\n\n\"The couple plans to wed in France in the summer of 2007 in what they describe as a 'big, happy ceremony with lots of family and friends,'\" Anderson's statement said.\n\nLongoria, 31, was married to actor Tyler Christopher from 2002 to 2004.\n\nIn an interview with Ryan Seacrest in October, Longoria said that her relationship with Parker was not over despite reports to the contrary.\n\nShe told E! News that she was flying to Paris to be with Parker, 24, who was overseas participating in exhibition games.\n\nLongoria also nixed rumors that she and \"Dancing With The Stars\" contestant Mario Lopez were an item. The actress could be seen on camera cheering Lopez and partner Karina after an energetic paso doble performance."
