        "text": "According to the National Enquirer, the latest bombshell in the “Desperate Housewives” star’s nasty divorce battle has Tony Parker wondering if Eva Longoria Parker carried on an affair with bicycling champ Lance Armstrong.\n\nThe couple’s storybook marriage exploded recently when Eva, 35, found sexually explicit text messages that Parker, 28, had exchanged with Erin Barry, the wife of his former San Antonio Spurs teammate Brent Barry.\n\nBut Tony has now turned the tables on Eva and believes that she may have cheated on him, too.\n\n“They’re both trying to put on this public front that they still love and care for each other, but behind the scenes it’s a battle of cheating accusations, finger-pointing and blame.”\n\nBut Eva had numerous other relationships that made Tony jealous. The “other men” in her life are said to have included Justin Timberlake, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jamie Foxx. But it was Eva’s close ties with fellow Texan and Tour de France champ Lance Armstrong that reportedly sent Parker’s suspicions into overdrive.\n\nSources also revealed that he was jealous of his wife’s close platonic friendship with Mario Lopez.\n\nAlthough they had a prenuptial agreement, Eva is seeking alimony."
