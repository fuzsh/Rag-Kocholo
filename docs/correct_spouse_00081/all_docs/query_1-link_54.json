The couple’s divorce became final just a few months ago, and Eva says she’s never been happier. “Being a woman, I realized you cannot identify yourself through a man or through your marriage,” she told Ellen DeGeneres. “I think it’s our nature to be socially constructed that way. To just be inferior or subservient and you don’t have to be. You can be yourself and really hold your own by yourself no matter what partnership you’re in. I’m in a happy place. . . . Everyone keeps saying, ‘You’ve never looked better.’ I think divorce agrees with me!”\n\nOriginally Published: September 18, 2011 at 12:00 a.m."
