        "text": "NEW YORK (CBS) Tony Parker filed his own divorce papers in Texas on Friday, just two days after his wife of three years, actress Eva Longoria, did the same in California.\n\nPICTURES: Celebrity Splits\n\nPICTURES: Their Wedding Preparations\n\nPICTURES: The Wedding\n\nIn the petition, Parker, 28, cites \"discord or conflict of personalities\" as the reason for the split, TMZ reports.\n\nThe NBA star's counter-filing is reportedly a \"standard procedure,\" a source close to the matter told People.\n\n\"This was not meant to escalate things,\" the source said. \"He filed his own papers to protect his rights during the proceeding. They are still committed to working this out together amicably.\"\n\nHis action comes after reports that Longoria, 35, found hundreds of text messages to Parker's phone from another woman who is now speculated to be Erin Barry, the wife of Parker's former San Antonio Spurs teammate, Brent Barry.\n\nLast Wednesday, the \"Desperate Housewives\" actress filed for divorce in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nShe broke her silence the same day about the matter, but did not speak about her husband's reported indiscretions.\n\n\"It is with great sadness that after 7 years together, Tony and I have decided to divorce,\" she wrote on her Twitter account. \"We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness.\"\n\nThe two became engaged in 2006 and wed at a chateau in France on July 7, 2007."
