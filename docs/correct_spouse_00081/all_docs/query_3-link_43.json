        "text": "Eva Longoria may have given us her best turkey cooking tips in October, but now it's her husband Tony Parker, whose goose is cooked. After reportedly finding out that her husband of three years had been exchanging hundreds of texts with his teammate's wife over the course of a year, Longoria filed for divorce.\n\nFind out how to beat divorce and keep lasting love >>\n\nThere's an unspoken rule, backed up by a recent Facebook relationship status study, that you can't break up with your significant other between Thanksgiving and New Year's, so maybe it's good that Eva found out about Tony's alleged affair in time. Though it will mean her Thanksgiving is not going to be the big gathering that she proudly hosts single-handedly every year:\n\nLove Lessons Ripped from the Headlines: What You Can Learn from Hollywood's Happiest Marriages and Messiest Relationships >>\n\n\"My worst habit in the kitchen is not allowing anybody to help me. I like to cook by myself. Tony calls me 'the crazy woman' at Thanksgiving. He says, 'Don't get near her; she's in her crazy mode. I always host Thanksgiving at our house. We typically have about 20 to 25 people, family and friends, including all of the \"homeless\" basketball players on Tony's team who live too far away to go home for the holiday.\"\n\nIt sounds like a lot of NBA players will be out of luck on the 25th.\n\nWhat do you think of Eva and Tony's split?\n\nMore on Relationships and Divorce:\n\nWhen Divorce is Happily Ever After\n\nWhat a Friend's Divorce Means for Your Marriage"
