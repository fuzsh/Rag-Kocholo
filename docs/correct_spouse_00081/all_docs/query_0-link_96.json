        "text": "I'm just so sad for her! She seems to be a loyal and really nice person and you easily could tell that she loved him very, very much but enough is enough.\n\nShe cheated in her first marriage to the soap opera actor. And Tony was involved in a serious longterm relationship when he met Eva so she knew he was a cheater since he cheated with her on the longterm girlfriend. AND she was also dating a singer when she met Tony and cheated on him with Tony!\n\nShe has also mentioned in interviews that she is an 'overlapper', in that she overlaps her relationships by not dumping one boyfriend yet dating another.\n\nAlso I don't think they were together for 7 years. She was still dating a singer (the guy she cheated on with Tony) in March '05 because there's pictures of them making out at her 30th birthday party.\n\nInteresting that she is asking for money. I wonder if the prenup states she gets money if he cheated. I am really surprised. I thought she would cheat first.\n\nif he cheated she should get all the money she can get from him\n\nShe cheated in her first marriage to the soap opera actor.

Maybe she promised exclusive coverage of her 'divorce' to some magazine? If that's the case, it just goes to show what a famewhore she really is. Sad.\n\nIAmLordZen my understanding my be wrong, but I thought that her team denied that Tony had filed divorce papers and that's it - because she was the one who filed them. Once it's clear that she's the one who did the filing and his cheating comes out (as it already has), then it'll paint him in the worse light, and she'll come out looking better - if it all goes to plan, that is.\n\nHere's the woman Tony allegedly cheated with (via TMZ)\n\nAnd I can't believe Eva had the gall to deny the report earlier when it was true anyway.

Sad.\n\nI have heard she is giving all her exclusives to her friend Mario Lopez who works for Extra. I think she is also tight w/ Billy Bush.\n\nI keep hearing she found hundreds of texts. Doesn't he know how to delete a text? Why keep so much incriminating evidence?\n\nI have heard she is giving all her exclusives to her friend Mario Lopez who works for Extra.

Nowadays if you're stupid enough to leave msgs and not delete them then you shouldn't even be having an affair or thinking about cheating."
