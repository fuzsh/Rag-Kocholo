From the Express-News: “His general statement on his divorce: ‘It’s a difficult time for me and Eva. We have a joint statement and everything else is our private life.’ On allegations that he was involved with the wife of a former teammate: ‘That’s my private life.’ On whether it will affect his play on the court and his teammates: ‘I’m having great support from my teammates and my coaches. I’m focused 100 percent on the Spurs and trying to win basketball games.'”"
