Her name: Erin Barry, and she's the wife of Brent Barry, a former teammate of Parker's on the San Antonio Spurs. And guess what: The Barrys, just like the Parkers, are divorcing.\n\nBrent Barry's dad Rick Barry tells TMZ, \"I feel horrible for my son. I'm in shock. I knew [Erin] was movingout of the house soon and SHE was the one that filed for divorce. Thisis the straw that broke the camel's back.\"\n\nBut was Erin -- a striking brunette, like Longoria -- moved to call it quits because of her alleged relationship with Parker? A source tells People.com that they indeed sent texts back and forth, but the exchange was purely flirtatious -- not physical.\n\nThe old-school WireImage photo above hails from 2003, back when Erin was a butterscotch blonde; while she kept a low national public profile prior to this Desperate Housewivesesque scandal, she previously played the role of dutiful, hands-on NBA wife and mother, hosting charity events and getting super-involved with politics and philanthropy in San Antonio.\n\nIn a 2006 interview with the magazine San Antonio Woman, she said she loved being married to Brent, her high-school sweetheart.\n\n\"We get the biggest kick out of each other; I just enjoy his company,\"she gushed. \"After all these years, he's my best friend. I want to bewith him all the time. People always talk about how hard marriage is,and I'm asking myself, 'Is it me? Is there something I'm not doingright?' Because for me, being married to Brent isn't hard at all!\""
