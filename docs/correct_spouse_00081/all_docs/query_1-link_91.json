        "text": "Eva Longoria and Jose \"Pepe\" Bastón have spent six years together, creating wonderful memories along the way.\n\nThe actress and her businessman husband met 10 years ago through mutual friends. Although they tried to keep their relationship a secret at first, their joy and excitement eventually led to going public.\n\nFlashing forward, the pair got married in December of 2015 and later became parents to Santiago on June 19, 2018. Of course, it's the little details in between that make their love story so sweet - scroll through to get them all!\n\nEva Longoria was one of the special guests on the 2009 Mexican Teletón. The Desperate Housewives star was happy to be part of an event supporting such a good cause.\n\nIt was her first appearance on Televisa, a Mexican TV channel where none-other-than José Bastón worked as an executive. However, at the time they didn't do more than greet each other warmly.\n\nIn 2013, they were again introduced, this time by a mutual friend. The stars aligned as they were both single and the chemistry was instantaneous.\n\nFor several months, they tried to keep their relationship a secret from news outlets, but eventually couldn't contain themselves. In November of that same year, their romance became official when they were spotted holding hands on the red carpet at an event in Mexico City.\n\nEva Longoria’s first husband was actor Tyler Christopher, who she married in 2002 in Las Vegas. They divorced two years later. In 2007, she got married for the second time to basketball player Tony Parker, but divorced three years later due to Parker’s infidelity. The star was also involved with Eduardo Cruz, brother of actress Penelope Cruz. José Bastón had also previously been married for 10 years.\n\nOn July 19, 2018, Eva Longoria’s first child (José Bastón’s fourth) Santiago Enrique (who has made som cameos in this photo gallery already) was born. We were thrilled to have the star share the first picture of her baby with us! Since then, legions of fans have been following Santiago as he grows up, enjoying funny little anecdotes about him from his momma."
