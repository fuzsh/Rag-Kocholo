        "text": "French basketball star Tony Parker only flirted with another woman in text messages and nothing more, reports said on Thursday after his wife Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria filed for divorce.\n\nThe actress decided to divorce Parker after finding the text exchanges with the wife of one of his San Antonio Spurs teammates, Brent Barry, People magazine and the TMZ website said.\n\n\"They knew each other, sent each other messages,\" a source close to Parker told People referring to Erin Barry, adding: \"It was flirtatious, but he never did anything with her.\"\n\nThe TMZ celebrity website also reported that Parker denies having had sex with his ex-teammate's wife.\n\nLongoria, 35, who married Parker in a lavish French chateau ceremony in 2007, confirmed she had filed for divorce on Wednesday, saying on her Twitter feed: \"We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness.\"\n\nCourt papers filed at Los Angeles Superior Court showed that Longoria - who has reportedly cancelled all upcoming appearances - cited \"irreconcilable differences\" for the split.\n\nBut a television presenter who is a close friend of the actress said Longoria told her she had found hundreds of texts on his mobile phone from Erin Barry.\n\nMario Lopez of the celebrity news show Extra said she had also discovered that Parker had cheated on her earlier in their marriage, and stayed in contact with the woman via the Facebook social networking site.\n\nLongoria and Parker, 28, who is one of the top European players in the National Basketball Association, signed a prenuptial agreement a month before their wedding, updated two years later, according to People.\n\nBrent Barry's father Rick meanwhile told TMZ that his son was divorcing.\n\n\"I feel horrible for my son. I'm in shock. I knew [Erin] was moving out of the house soon and she was the one that filed for divorce. This is the straw that broke the camel's back,\" the NBA Hall of Famer said.\n\nParker was asked about the split on Wednesday evening, when he spoke briefly to a clutch of reporters outside the Spurs' locker room before the team's NBA contest against Chicago.\n\nIt was flirtatious, but he never did anything with her"
