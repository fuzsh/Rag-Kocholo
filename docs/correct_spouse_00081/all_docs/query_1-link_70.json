        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Eva Longoria filed court papers Wednesday to divorce basketball star Tony Parker, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nLongoria, a star of TV’s “Desperate Housewives,” and Parker, an NBA All-Star with the San Antonio Spurs, were married July 7, 2007. They have no children together.\n\nIn the filing, Longoria requested that her name be restored to Eva Jacqueline Longoria. She had taken Parker’s name when they married.\n\nThe filing also stated the couple had a prenuptial agreement but no details were provided.\n\nLongoria asked the court to require each side pay its own attorney fees. She also wants to receive spousal support from Parker but not pay any to him.\n\nLongoria’s spokeswoman, Liza Anderson, said the actress had no comment. Parker wasn’t immediately available for comment.\n\nLongoria, 35, did not indicate in the court filings when the couple broke up.\n\nParker, 28, signed a multiyear extension with the Spurs two weeks ago. At the time, the point guard from France insisted he and Longoria wanted to remain in San Antonio.\n\nThe former couple each posted a statement on their Twitter accounts addressing the divorce. “We love each other deeply and pray for each other’s happiness,” the posting said."
