        "text": "[daylifegallery id=\"1290119511897\" height=\"375\" width=\"500\"]\n\nBy now everyone knows that actress Eva Longoria has filed for a divorce from NBA star Tony Parker, accusing him of cheating. With former San Antonio Spurs teammate Brent Barry's estranged wife, Erin, no less.\n\nABC’s Desperate Housewives star apparently found hundreds of text messages that were going on for the past year between Parker and the soon-to-be-ex Mrs. Barry.\n\n\"There was texting that went on for a while and probably crossed the line,\" one source told The New York Post, noting that \"there's no physical relationship.\"\n\nThe concept of emotional infidelity vs. something along of the lines of Tiger Woods' affairs might just matter when it comes to property settlement and division of assets.\n\nAs part of the divorce filing in L.A. County Superior Court, Longoria is \"reportedly is looking for spousal support despite being one of the highest-paid actresses on television,\" as my Forbes colleague Kurt Badenhausen notes in \"Tony Vs. Eva: Who Makes More?\".\n\nShe ranked No. 92 in this year's Forbes Celebrity 100 list while he will earn $13.5 million this season. Last month Parker signed a four-year contract extension that pays $50 million.\n\nThere's a pre-nup to this three year marriage. But whether or not it will matter in this post-Woods universe is something to consider. Elin Nordegren netted a whopping $750 million plus the kids and a mansion or three. But she wasn't a working woman like Longoria.\n\nThe question at hand is: Will the Housewife keep the literal and figurative house? Should she?\n\nIt will be a contest of lawyers--and wills. After all, it's not easy locating another 133-square-foot master closet like the one Longoria keeps in the couple's LA home profiled in InStyle as \"full of gorgeous gowns, shoes, shirts—and a coveted Hermes hot-pink crocodile Birkin bag.\"\n\nThe Parker-Longoria split brings to mind some of the other celebrity divorces of 2010, and who got what in real estate and more:\n\nCharlie Sheen and Brooke Mueller\n\nMueller gets primary physical custody of their two sons and, according to documents shared by TMZ.com, \"under no circumstances shall the child support paid by Charlie for Bob and Max be less than the child support paid by Charlie to Denise Richards for Sam and Lola.\" That would be about $55K monthly. The actress also received a marital parting gift of $757,689.70. As for Charlie, in addition to his $5.6 million watch collection, he gets the house. But he has to buy his ex out of her share to the tune of around $1 million.\n\nTiger Woods and Elin Nordegren\n\nShe gets the kids, $750 million and the couple's home in Windemere, Fla. (the scene of his infamous car crash), another nearby house and the properties in her native Sweden. Tiger gets the Jupiter Island, Fla., house, under construction and worth a reported $80 million, along with their Los Angeles apartment.\n\nSandra Bullock and Jesse James\n\nThe Southern California home they shared together was put on the market for just under $6 million. No word on who put the house up or who got the money, but Bullock was the one who moved out in March. The following month, moving vans were spotted outside her \"ridiculously gorgeous\" $2.25 million Victorian house in New Orleans, where she moved with her infant son, Louis, who she's nicknamed her \"little Cajun cookie.\" It has five bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, a sweeping staircase, ballroom and carved marble mantels.\n\nCheryl and Ashley Cole\n\nWhen British singer Cheryl Cole first filed for divorce against husband Ashley, a professional footballer who plays for Chelsea and the England national team, she said she wouldn't give up the house: Hurtmore House in Surrey, which the couple purchased for £3.5 million in 2008. In the end, he gets the mansion while she will live in their North London apartment. The houses were the last of their assets to be divided after they previously battled over the custody of their two dogs.\n\nAl and Tipper Gore\n\nShe got the Montecito, Calif., home the two bought this year amid speculation that it was purchased with \"a view to [the] Gore's forthcoming split.\" The $8,875,000 gem is situated on 1.5 acres with five bedrooms, nine bathrooms, six fireplaces, terraces, a wine cellar and spa in more than 6,500 square feet with Pacific Ocean views."
