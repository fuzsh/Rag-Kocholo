        "text": "Last Updated on November 18, 2010 by Paulette Brown-Hinds\n\n(Reuters) – “Desperate Housewives” star Eva Longoria filed for divorce on Wednesday to end her three-year marriage to basketball player Tony Parker, following revelations of his text messaging with another woman.\n\nLongoria, 35, filed divorce papers in Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences.\n\n“It is with great sadness that after 7 years together, Tony and I have decided to divorce,” Longoria said in a statement posted on her official Facebook page. “We love each other deeply and pray for each other’s happiness.”\n\nHer spokeswoman had no further comment beyond the posting.\n\nCelebrity TV show Extra said its host Mario Lopez had spoken to Longoria, and she told Lopez she had found 100s of text messages from another woman on Parker’s phone. She also told Lopez that Parker had cheated on her before.\n\n“She is devastated, she wants us all to know that,” Lopez said in a statement. “But she’s strong.”\n\nLongoria and Parker, 27, who plays for the San Antonio Spurs, dated for years before being married in a lavish ceremony at a French chateau in 2007.\n\nTheir wedding was picture perfect, and they seemed to be living a happily married life — she, the Hollywood star and he, the handsome athlete. They have no children.\n\nThe marriage was Parker’s first and Longoria’s second. Her marriage to “General Hospital” TV actor Tyler Christopher ended in 2004 after two years.\n\n(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)"
