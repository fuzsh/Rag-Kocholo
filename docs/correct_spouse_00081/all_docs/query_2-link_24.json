        "text": "Eva Longoria says she would consider having a child out of wedlock with NBA star-boyfriend Tony Parker — but he wouldn't.\n\n\"I would,\" the 31-year-old \"Desperate Housewives\" actress says in an interview in Allure magazine's April issue, on newsstands Tuesday. \"But Tony won't. ... He's only been with one other person in his life.\"\n\nLongoria says it was \"lust at first sight\" when she met Parker, 23, a point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, in the Spurs' locker room after a game last year.\n\n\"He's very sweet,\" she says of her French-born boyfriend. \"I'm the experienced one. I'm the teacher, especially about love. He's always telling me he's never met anyone who loves the way I do — wholly and freely and unconditionally.\"\n\nShe also clears up speculation that they will soon walk down the aisle: \"No, no, no. But we know exactly what we want in our future.\"\n\n\"Our children will speak French,\" she adds.\n\nParker appreciates her \"plucky\" attitude, Longoria tells the magazine.\n\n\"Since I grew up in Texas, I'm like the people he's gotten used to around San Antonio instead of being a Hollywood actress who's selfish and arrogant and full of herself ... and screamy,\" she says.\n\nLongoria stars opposite Michael Douglas, Kiefer Sutherland and Kim Basinger in the thriller \"The Sentinel,\" set for release next month."
