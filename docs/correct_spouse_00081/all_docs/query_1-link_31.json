        "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) - Less than four years after a storybook wedding in Paris, Eva Longoria filed court papers Wednesday to divorce basketball star Tony Parker, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nParker, a three-time NBA All-Star with the San Antonio Spurs, made no hint as to what caused the split between him and the star of TV's \"Desperate Housewives\" during a brief meeting with a throng of reporters outside his team's locker room about an hour before a game.\n\n\"It's a difficult time right now for me and Eva,\" Parker said. \"We got a joint statement and everything else is our private life.\"\n\nAsked about speculation that Parker might have been involved with the wife of a former Spurs teammate, Parker replied: \"That's my private life.\"\n\nParker spoke to the media for less than a minute before a team official ended the interview.\n\nLongoria and Parker were married in a civil ceremony in France on July 6, 2007. The next day, a priest married them in a church across from the Louvre Museum, followed by an exclusive bash at a storied French chateau.\n\nAs a member of the Spurs, Parker has won three NBA championships in recent years. Longoria often had a courtside seat at his games.\n\nEach posted a statement on their Twitter accounts addressing the divorce. \"We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness,\" it said.\n\nThey have no children together. Longoria has one previous marriage.\n\nIn her legal filing, she requested that her name be restored to Eva Jacqueline Longoria. She had taken Parker's name when they married.\n\nThe filing also stated the couple had a prenuptial agreement but no details were provided.\n\nLongoria asked the court to require each side pay its own attorney fees. She also wants to receive spousal support from Parker but not pay any to him.\n\nLongoria's spokeswoman, Liza Anderson, said the actress had no further comment.\n\nLongoria, 35, did not indicate in the court filings when the couple broke up.\n\nParker, 28, signed a multiyear extension with the Spurs two weeks ago. At the time, the French point guard insisted that he and Longoria wanted to remain in San Antonio.\n\n\"I've gotten great support from my teammates and my coaches,\" Parker said. \"And I'll focus 100 percent on the Spurs and try to win basketball games.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Paul J.
