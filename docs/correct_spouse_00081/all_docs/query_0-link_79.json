        "text": "First she did. Then she didn’t. And somewhere in there, someone said he did.\n\nFinally, Eva Longoria filed court papers Wednesday to divorce her basketball star husband, Tony Parker, citing irreconcilable differences, a day after her publicist shot down multiple divorce rumors.\n\nLongoria, 35, a star of TV’s “Desperate Housewives,” and Parker, an All-Star with the San Antonio Spurs, were married July 7, 2007. They have no children together.\n\nThe filing stated the couple had a prenuptial agreement, but no details were provided.\n\n“Extra” confirmed the actress found hundreds of text messages from another woman on 28-year-old Parker’s phone, who turned out to be the wife of one of the NBA player’s teammates.\n\nSports Illustrated’s Bryan Graham reported it was the wife of former Spur and De La Salle High School star Brent Barry.\n\nWe’re pretty sure that, according to the law, Barry now gets a crack at Longoria.\n\n“Eva wants everyone to know, she’s devastated by the rumors of Tony’s infidelity. She loved her husband and is heartbroken about their split,” good friend Mario Lopez said. “But she’s strong.”\n\nWait “… how did Mario Lopez get involved here? Was the gym closed or something?\n\nLongoria and Parker each posted a statement on their Twitter accounts: “We love each other deeply and pray for each other’s happiness.”\n\nSure they do. Wait until the lawyers get to work.\n\nREYNOLDS IS GOOD-LOOKING OR SOMETHING: Because waking up beside Scarlett Johansson each day isn’t enough, Ryan Reynolds is now People magazine’s “sexiest man alive.”\n\nAllow us pause, yet again, to marvel at this travesty, wrapped in a mockery, surrounded by a sham. Again, no one from People Central made the list.\n\nWe hope to do better in the next Mr. Universe competition, or maybe win a Tony award or something.\n\nReynolds, 34, soon will star on-screen as the Green Lantern. The Canadian native told People: “The sexiest thing about Canadians is that there’s an inherent ability to be self-deprecating. That has served me well in my career and personal life.”\n\nOh, shut up and go watch your wife take a shower.\n\nIt’s the 25th anniversary of People’s first sexiest man — Mel Gibson. Others given the title include John F. Kennedy Jr., Harrison Ford, George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp.\n\nSOMEONE HAS ISSUES: A rural Wisconsin man blasted his television set with a shotgun after watching Bristol Palin’s “Dancing with the Stars” routine Monday night, saying he was fed up with politics and that Palin wasn’t a very good dancer, according to court documents.\n\nWell, that doesn’t sound so unreasonable.\n\nOh, wait. Then Steven Cowan, 67, of the town of Vermont, about 15 miles west of Madison, had to go ruin the moment and point the gun at his wife, 66-year-old Janice Cowan, which sounds extremely unreasonable. She escaped and called police, authorities said.\n\nA SWAT team surrounded the couple’s farmhouse, and officers were able to talk Cowan out Tuesday morning after an all-night standoff, likely by promising to vote for Jennifer Grey next week.\n\nCowan was charged Tuesday with second-degree reckless endangerment.\n\nHe apparently was upset that a political figure’s daughter was dancing on TV, even though he felt she had no talent.\n\nWell, if that were a good reason to shoot TVs, there’d be a serious television shortage in the United States.\n\nThe Internet has been abuzz about how Bristol Palin has made the show’s final three, despite her low scores from judges, with many suggesting her mother’s supporters are voting for her in blocs.\n\nSpeaking of Sarah Palin, her 16-year-old daughter, Willow, sparked Internet controversy when she used a homophobic slur to attack someone on Facebook who had criticized the TV show “Sarah Palin’s Alaska.”"
