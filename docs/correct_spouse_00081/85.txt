Eva Longoria ex-husband, NBA star Tony Parker, is expecting a child with his new fiancée, he announced on Twitter.

The former “Desperate Housewives” actress split from the athlete in 2010 after three years of marriage amid rumors he had cheated.

Parker is now preparing to marry Axelle Francine, who he proposed to earlier this year, and now the couple has revealed they are expecting a son.

“Hey just wanted to say that I’m very happy today…me and my future Wife going to have a Baby Boy!!!!,” Parker tweeted.

The news comes after Longoria was reportedly spotted kissing her ex, Eduardo Cruz. Posting a link to the claim on Twitter, she added: “Sorry this is just not true.”
