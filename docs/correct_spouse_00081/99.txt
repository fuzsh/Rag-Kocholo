Eva Longoria and Tony Parker

Another couple who had an entire foot between them was Desperate Housewives actress Eva Longoria and her ex-husband Tony Parker.

Being a basketball player being 6ft 2Â” was advantageous for Parker, however Eva who is just 5ft 2Â” looked tiny beside him.

The couple filed for divorce in January last year after seven years together amid rumours Parker had been unfaithful, but, Eva has since found love again with Penelope CruzÂ’s brother, Eduardo.
