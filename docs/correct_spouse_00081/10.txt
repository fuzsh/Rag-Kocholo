Eva Longoria's ex-husband Tony Parker remarried on Saturday.

San Antonio Spurs basketball player Tony Parker tied the knot with his French journalist fiancée Axelle Francine at an intimate ceremony in San Antonio, Texas.

The couple - who began dating in 2011 - began their weekend wedding celebrations with a pre-wedding reception at the Cowboy Dancehall in San Antonio on Thursday where they were joined by close family and friends with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and cocktails.

Speaking about the reception, a Dancehall employee told PEOPLE.com: ''It was just a little gathering. He wanted to show them a Texas country good time.''

Tony and Axelle - who welcomed their first child, Josh, into the world in April this year - are now believed to be on honeymoon.

As well as marrying his beautiful fiancée, the 32-year-old French sportsman is also celebrating signing a three-year contract extension with NBL team the San Antonio Spurs worth a reputed $43 million.

Tony and Eva married in July 2007 but split in 2010 following allegations he had cheated on the actress with Erin Barry, the then-wife of basketball star Brent Barry, Tony's former teammate.

Their divorce was finalized in January 2011.
