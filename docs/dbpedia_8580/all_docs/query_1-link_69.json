        "text": "A first version of this text was published in French as a theoretical introduction to vol.1 of Pop Culture in the Arabia Peninsula in Arabian Humanities 14. This English-language version was updated and revised by Laure Assaf for this issue.\n\n1“How does one define 'pop culture' in the Arabian Peninsula? How does it relate to mass consumption, public media, censorship, religious expressions, and traditional popular cultures? Who produces and consumes it, and under what conditions? What kind of entertainment does it create? How does it fit into political contexts marked by autocratic power, repression, censorship, and the mobilization of culture for political purposes? Should it be read as the mass-produced expression of dominant cultures, or can it be a challenge to the hegemony of these dominant cultures? Does it enable the control of representations and individuals or, on the contrary, does it allow for their emancipation and empowerment?”\n\n5The early 2000s, however, marked a qualitative and quantitative shift, notably through the heavy investment of the Gulf states in the cultural sector. This move came earlier for some and later for others: while Kuwait had historically been the cultural center of the Peninsula, it is only in the recent years and the nomination of Mohammed Bin Salman as Crown Prince that the Saudi state fully embraced culture as an instrument of soft power. With the help of considerable capital and heavy investment in education and multimedia platforms, cultural productions are not only showcased for local consumption but also exported throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Works of literary fiction, poetry, theater, music, cinema, television programs and fine arts, from high-end productions to commercial pop culture, thus shape a Khaleeji identity in contemporary Arabic culture.\n\n6Although the conference panels addressed all aspects of this cultural production, the articles presented here focus more specifically on popular or even marginal productions: ones that showcase both the cultural hybridity of the Arabian Peninsula, and its emerging centrality.\n\n7Popular media productions can say a lot about societies of the Arabian Peninsula, how they translate apprehensions and bring forward certain types of discourses, negotiating their relationship to national narratives. Pop culture sometimes escapes the extreme surveillance to which cultural productions are subjected in the region, though in varying degrees depending on the states concerned. In fact, productions circulated online are generally subject to closer supervision than that imposed on literature. The latter, because of its elitist character, its small readership and also the legitimacy of the actors in its field, can allow itself more deviations from national norms and discourses.\n\n10Yet the existence of a peninsular “pop culture” object is obvious to anyone living in the region. For several decades, the Arabian Peninsula has become both a distributor and a producer of mass images, sounds, texts, and performances. It is home to a vibrant pop culture that uses formal and informal channels, analogue and digital media, and that targets a very wide audience in the Arabic-speaking area. TV series, web series, Twitter controversies, internet memes, comics, songs, pulp fiction, advertisements, all are disseminated and discussed, sometimes across regional borders.\n\n12This contemporary media culture has even managed to make itself accessible to Western audiences, from the successful translation of Rajā' al-Ṣāniʿ’s Banāt al-Riyāḍ (2005) into French and English, the first inclusion in an Arabic novel of the internet dimension of interpersonal relationships, to the international distribution of the films Wadjda (2012) and The Perfect Candidate / Al-murashshaḥa al-mithāliyya (2019), written and directed by Hayfaa al-Mansour. These relative commercial successes – in the sense that the international distribution of a Saudi film is a breakthrough – may prompt a debate on the specificity of cultural products intended for export, which often revolve around themes of female agency that are sure to strike a chord with an audience eager for “unveiling”, according to the established cliché. But the distribution of these cultural products also reveals that their producers and sponsors have initially considered the hypothesis of their reception outside the Arab world, and therefore of the globalized cultural codes of reception that this implies. This only confirms the ambition of the richest countries of the Gulf to use the “soft” power that is linked to popular culture to modify their image, as shown in the conclusion of Frédéric Lagrange’s article in this issue. This is done in a more controlled and clever way in this third decade of the twenty-first century than had been done earlier, at the time of the national “product placement” of Abu Dhabi that was Sex and The City 2 in 2010…\n\n13On a pan-Arab level, we know that Egyptian plays and films, their recurring stock characters (the teasing almah, the bawwāb, the Ṣaʿīdī, etc.), or the icons of the Levantine song, are all reference points in the “culture of everyday life” shared by (almost) everyone. But on a peninsular regional level, there is also a quantity of musical or audiovisual productions, cultural objects, gestures, clothing styles, common figures of the everyday postmodern urban space (or of the desert as a nexus of identity, as it is conceived in many national narratives around the region), which constitute a common thesaurus of cultural references.\n\n16But beyond language, what makes pop culture possible at the national or regional level is the existence of a “network of referentiality” shared by a majority and in which the complicity of belonging to a group is revealed, since, as Richard Mèmeteau suggests,\n\n19 Mèmeteau, 2014, p. 7.\n\n“All mass culture must present to the masses the massive and renewed history of their own convergence. Pop serves to make an indefinite people experience its own power of aggregation.”\n\n17And indeed, just as there are probably not many Arabic speakers raised in the Arab world who would not identify “metʿawweda, dayman” as a line from ʿᾹdil Imām in the Egyptian comedy Shāhid mā shāfsh ḥāga (1976), few citizens of the Gulf would not identify “minu yāyna hal ḥazza” (who’s coming to see us at this hour?), said with a nasal, dragging ending, or “Jāsim bāg il-shirka yubba” (Jassem stole the company, Daddy) as the perennial clichés of Made in Kuwait TV soap operas, to the point of becoming a source of internet memes, or “ay ay ay... hāḏā llī ʿaṭūna yāh fil-madrasa” (I... I... I... what they taught us at school) as the hilarious repartee of actress Intiṣār al-Sharrāḥ unable to speak English in the Kuwaiti hit comedy Bye Bye London (1982).\n\n18Kuwaiti comic theatre or soap opera (featuring Bahraini, Omani, Emirati, Saudi actors and actresses...), Saudi TV drama, Emirati song, Nabaṭī poetry and its “popified” version in the TV show Shāʿir al-Milyūn are, among a thousand others, shared references from Muscat to Taiz and Kuwait-City to Jeddah. Who in the region did not discover with amazement, and then listen to, the hits of Firqat Miami, the first (Kuwaiti) boy band founded in the early 1990s? Who has not heard and empathized with, in anticipation of the regional weekend, the hit Halā bil-khamīs (Long Live Thursday, 2016) by the Syrian resident in Saudi Arabia, Maʿan Barghūth, and used the phrase themselves? And is it not known throughout the region that nsīr al-barr is the weekend rallying cry to go camping in the desert?\n\n24In fact, the angle most commonly taken by social scientists to deal with popular cultures in the region is that of nation branding and nation building, that of the collection of heritage and the creation, under state leadership, of a national culture based on a selection of cultural facts that are certainly real but essentially linked to Arabness, Islam and Bedouinism, and which are based on identity markers. As Hélène Thiollet points out:\n\n31 Thiollet, 2016.\n\n“The Gulf States initiated a response strategy in the 1990s in the form of defending Khalījī identity as well as certain local characteristics (political, cultural, linguistic and social) presented as traditions and elements of heritage (turāth). This ideological and political attempt was clearly aimed at widening the disparities between nationals and foreigners and was practised in several areas (culture, education, labour and migration policy), in order to build the nation on the basis of an ‘invented tradition’.”\n\n25The exploration of this collection and of the subsequent invention of tradition in the Gulf monarchies was the subject of the pioneering work, Popular Culture and Political Identity in the Arab Gulf States (2008). Its editors noted that:\n\n32 Alsharekh and Springborg, 2008.\n\n“An interesting, possibly unique, feature of Gulf culture is its ability to synthesize traditional and modern forms within the Gulf vernacular and then to project them into the Arab world beyond, by means of the vast media resources based in the Gulf.”\n\n26But at the same time, Alsharekh & Springborg question the power of resistance of this “stylistic dialect” used by local cultural productions in the face of global norms, eroding what might remain of traditional beliefs and ways of life.\n\n31Each era, however, has its own media of choice: the most nearly subversive material is no longer broadcast on satellite channels but on the internet – and since very recently, is getting new exposure and global distribution via the Netflix platform, whose Made in Arabia programme offering has markedly expanded, and is now offering programmes initially intended for the net, such as Takkī (2012) or Masāmīr.\n\n32States in the region are well aware of the challenge posed by cultural productions that do not originate from elite high culture and the need to control it. Authoritarian regimes are now seeking to appropriate pop culture, from cinema to music and from electronic music festivals to influencers operating on social networks. This appropriation goes hand in hand with the control and repression of popular cultural productions whose claims do not fit in squarely with national narratives.\n\n33Saudi stand-up comedian Fahad al-Butairi, creator of Lā yikthar, was, on the one hand, the husband of feminist activist Loujain al-Hathloul, imprisoned in Saudi Arabia from May 2018 to February 2021, and himself disappeared from the artistic and media since his wife’s arrest in March 2018; on the other hand, he is one of the main actors in the tragicomic road movie From A to B / Min Alif li-Bā' (2013), an Emirati production (which nevertheless has no Emirati characters) that offers a bittersweet reflection on the echo of the Arab revolutions for Arab residents leaving the cozy comfort and certainties of Abu Dhabi (A) to travel to Beirut (B).\n\n36The fact remains that this vision of the artist as spokesperson for the group is a little hasty in ignoring the arbitrariness of power, which is quick to crack down even on those who seem to be moving in the favored social direction but are acting without its authorization.\n\n37The need for rigorous analysis is therefore more pressing. In particular there is an urgent need to examine the relationship between mainstream pop culture, the niche subcultures that may be tacked on to it or that remain on its margins, the traditional popular cultures it is constantly borrowing from and referring to, the high culture with which it is in dialogue, and the protest counterculture in the region.\n\n***\n\n38The first volume on pop culture in the Arabian Peninsula noted, as one of the particularities of peninsular pop, its remarkable multilingualism, which is expressed not only through the permanent code-switching it maintains with English, but also with the various Arabic dialects used in the region, whether indigenous or that of immigrants, as well as the languages of non-Arabic speaking residents, particularly those of the Indian subcontinent. This reflection of the diversity of the inhabitants, discernible in all the audio-visual productions of the region, questions the paradigm of culture as a tool for differentiating and separating the local and the non-native: language is a permanent testimony of a hybrid reality.\n\n39The six articles that make up this second volume all address this hybridity in depth. Through the case of TV series, sartorial practices, social media pages, influencers, pop stars, and wedding singers, the complex demographic make-up and multilingual reality of Arabian Peninsula societies appear particularly salient. It is perhaps not surprising that, within a conference dedicated, in part, to the exploration of state-produced cultural centralities, popular cultural productions are shown to constitute, by contrast, the place where mixed and complex identities are being expressed, and where monolithic narratives are challenged – though they can also be affirmed and reinforced.\n\n40Clio Chaveneau traces the new centrality of the Khaleej among pan-Arab artistic and social media productions, by examining the artworks posted over a year on the @arabic.pop.art Instagram account. The trajectory of the popular page itself reflects a common path among artists: it was started in 2014 by a Syrian citizen living in Saudi Arabia, who has since moved to Norway. Chaveneau shows how Khaleejiness is increasingly indexed among the pop artworks published on the page. By referencing everyday items and figures, pop art supposes spectators who are familiar with the cultural context in which these items are situated; therefore, the growing representation of the Gulf among pop artworks implies that clothing styles, architectural patterns and landmarks, or consumer goods from the region are now recognized by a large viewership around the Arab world. Symmetrically, Chaveneau notes how, when presented in the context of a broader Arab world, representations of the Gulf/Khaleej tend to fall back on national narratives that associate the Peninsula with the Bedouin heritage and the standardized national dress.\n\n41The field of music reflects this emerging centrality, while making the internal diversity of peninsular societies particularly salient. Coline Houssais rightfully underlines the historical “intersection of race and musical performance in the Arabian Peninsula”, with the Sumr, i.e. populations of sub-Saharan African origins, making up the majority of the traditional performers. She contends that this association between Sumr artists and musical entertainment showcases a “visible invisibility”: while Gulf citizens of sub-Saharan origins are erased from official narratives – along with much of the history of slavery in the Peninsula – they also increasingly embody cultural heritage through music. This new visibility of Sumr performers, if it has provided an entry into the pop musical scene, still confines them to the margins of the industry.\n\n42It is this pop music industry and its female stars which feature at the center of Richard Nedjat Haiem’s article. Analyzing the language(s) used by some of the most famous contemporary Arab pop singers – Assala, Balqees, but also Hind al-Bahrainiyya or Ahlam –, he shows how they reflect a linguistic hybridity that is characteristic of the urban landscapes of the Gulf metropolises. This cosmopolitanism is reflected both in the careers and lives of transnational artists, who foreground a diversity of belongings (rather than the identification to a particular nation); as well as in song lyrics, which increasingly mix various dialects or use a standardized form of Gulf Arabic, erasing idiomatic expressions and overly local markers so it can be understood around the region and beyond (the “white dialect”).\n\n43By contrast, the Khaleeji influencers studied by Corinne Stokes do not seek to erase linguistic variations or quid pro quos; on the contrary, these constitute some of the main comedic devices at the heart of their Instagram skits and elicit numerous comments from their audiences. These skits use language, dress, and social etiquette to play on the boundaries between the groups that compose Khaleeji societies, and on the assumptions often made about belonging or unbelonging on their basis. They mobilize young people’s ability to code-switch as a way to call out and unsettle these assumptions, showing how appearances – especially in the Gulf – are not always what they seem: a foreign-looking youth can turn out to perfectly master one of the dialects from the Arabian Peninsula and, conversely, a seemingly “typical” Khaleeji can reveal, when he speaks, a Khodmouni (Iranian) origin or an “American vibe.” The success of these skits, in turn, relies on the ability of their audience to recognize and understand the languages they mobilize and the various ethnic origins they connote; thus pointing to a shared knowledge of this diversity which goes far beyond what is portrayed in official discourses.\n\n44Frédéric Lagrange’s article sheds light on a specific figure of alterity within Gulf societies: the “trans-peninsular figure of the South Asian barber, car mechanic, baqāla owner, or, for its female counterpart, the Indian nanny or bishkāra.” Tracing the different representations of the South Asian other in cultural productions, and their evolution through time, he first demonstrates how the longstanding connections between India and the Gulf create a “close otherness” – one that is intertwined with familiarity, and portrays the South Asian worker a familiar presence, both through historical ties and through contemporary cultural flows, particularly visible in the Gulf’s fascination for Bollywood. These representations demarcate South Asian characters from other migrant groups – notably Europeans and North Americans, rarely if ever a part of these cultural productions. At the same time, familiar otherness is still otherness: Lagrange examines notably how language, and in particular the use of South Asian Pidgin Arabic, is mobilized to keep these characters at a distance from the Gulf “self.” In turn, South Asian characters become a touchstone through which the modernity and tolerance of this self is being showcased and tested."
