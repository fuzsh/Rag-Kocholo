C\n\nThe great-grandmother and lingua franca of all programming languages, C was first released in 1972. (Yes, that’s 50+ years ago!)\n\nDuring the past decades, C has become one of the most widely used programming languages ever to exist.\n\nC is used for creating a variety of programs for computers, such as operating systems, for example.\n\nIf you are new to programming, C is not going to be the easiest programming language to learn. The syntax is somewhat complex and cryptic, and it takes some time to get familiar with.\n\nBut once you get past that, learning the language is rather straightforward.\n\nAlso, what’s great about learning C is that when you master it, it’s much easier to learn your next programming language.\n\nBecause C has been around forever, it’s had a strong influence on some other programming languages, too. You can find similarities in C# and C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python, for instance.\n\nWhat is C used for?\n\nOperating systems and system tools\n\nGame development\n\nAdvanced computation and graphics\n\nCompilers\n\nEnterprise software\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in C?\n\n#include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf(\"Hello World!\"); }\n\nShould you learn C?\n\nC isn’t the most popular or trendy programming language to learn.\n\nHowever, it’s still an in-demand skill with a longer history than most programming languages have.\n\nLearning C will give you a good overview of the evolution of programming during the past 50 years.\n\nYou’ll find plenty of developers who used C even before the Internet came to exist.\n\nOne major downside of C is that it’s somewhat difficult to learn for beginners.\n\nThus, if you’re looking for the easiest first programming language to learn, I recommend a more high-level language like Python\n\nHigh-level programming languages are easier to “read”. That means you can focus on learning the fundamentals of programming instead of spending too much time understanding how a single programming language works.\n\nWhere can you start learning the C programming language?\n\nC Programming For Beginners – Master the C Language on Udemy\n\nLearn C – Free Interactive C Tutorial\n\nLearn C on Codecademy\n\nC Tutorial on W3Schools\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n2. C#\n\nOriginally developed by Microsoft to run on their .NET framework, C# (pronounced “C-sharp”) is based on C and C++.\n\nC# was originally designed to be easy to learn and use.\n\nC# a high-level language, meaning that it reads a bit like English.\n\nOn top of that, it abstracts away a lot of those complex tasks needed to make sure the computer can read and process your code.\n\nHowever, C# is not as high-level as Python, for example. Thus, Python is even easier for beginners than C#.\n\nWhat is C# used for?\n\nGame development (Unity)\n\nDesktop applications (Microsoft, Windows)\n\nWeb services\n\nWeb applications\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in C#?\n\nusing System; class App { static void Main() { Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\"); } }\n\nShould you learn C#?\n\nC# is the main programming language for developing software and programs for Microsoft.\n\nIf you’re interested in building applications for the Microsoft platform, C# is the perfect choice for you.\n\nAnother popular application for C# is game development. If you want to work in the gaming industry, C# is an excellent choice.\n\nIt’s the recommended language for building games on the Unity game engine, for example.\n\nWhere can you start learning the C# programming language?\n\nLearn C# on Codecademy\n\nC# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding on Udemy\n\nLearn C# on Microsoft .NET\n\nC# Tutorial For Beginners – Learn C# Basics in 1 Hour on YouTube\n\nComplete C# Unity Game Developer 2D on Udemy\n\nC# Tutorial on W3Schools\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n3. C++\n\nC++ is based on C, the indisputable dinosaur of programming languages still in use.\n\nC++ a powerful, high-performance language, but it’s rather lower-level.\n\nLow-level programming languages use a lower degree of abstraction, so they are more difficult to “read” than high-level languages.\n\nLearning a low-level language means you will spend more on understanding how the language works per se.\n\nTherefore, you can dedicate less time to learning how computer programming works and what it’s all about.\n\nIf you’re coding an application from scratch with C++, you need to write a lot of code.\n\nThat said, C++ projects are often more difficult to maintain and manage.\n\nOn the other hand, C++ is very scalable and efficient. Heaps of resource-intensive programs often use C++, like some of the most stunning 3D games out there.\n\nWhat is C++ is used for?\n\nDesktop applications and software\n\nMobile apps\n\nGame engines and games\n\nWeb applications\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in C++?\n\n#include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << \"Hello World!\" << std::endl; }\n\nShould you learn C++?\n\nIf you’re interested in learning C++, remember that it’s a very complex language to learn.\n\nTry to find an experienced mentor to guide and support you along the way.\n\nIf you want to take on big projects and have a lot of control of how the programs execute, C++ is most likely a good choice.\n\nLearning the basics of C helps you pick up C++ faster. That’s somewhat of a prerequisite for learning C++ anyways.\n\nOnce you master C++, learning other programming languages will be much easier.\n\nWhere can you start learning the C++ programming language?\n\nFree C++ Tutorial for Complete Beginners on Udemy\n\nLearn C++ Free Tutorial\n\nLearn C++ on Codecademy\n\nC++ Tutorial for Beginners – Full Course on YouTube\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n4. CSS\n\nCSS or Cascading Style Sheets is the language web designers and web developers use to create the look and design of a website.\n\nWhereas HTML creates the structure and contents for a website, like paragraphs, headings, and images, CSS takes those elements and makes them look pretty.\n\nIf you’re interested in building websites, you must learn CSS at some point. Luckily, CSS is easy and quick to learn. It’s also one of the most motivational languages for beginners, because you see the output from your code instantly.\n\nHowever, even though you can learn the basics of CSS in just a few days, it can take years to master the more advanced tricks with confidence.\n\nOf course, CSS is just a style sheet language and not a “proper” programming language.\n\nBut since every website out there uses CSS, it has earned a spot on this list.\n\nHere are a couple of helpful CSS guides for you:\n\nBook Review: HTML and CSS – Design and Build Websites\n\nRecommended HTML and CSS courses for beginners\n\nFAQ: How to Become a Web Developer?\n\nWhat is CSS used for?\n\nStyling web page structure, layout, and content (by selecting HTML elements and applying style rules to them)\n\nShould you learn CSS?\n\nIf you want to build websites, you must learn CSS.\n\nTogether with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is one of the most fundamental front-end skills you must master as a web developer or web designer.\n\nAlso, if you want to make money already while you learn coding, the fastest and easiest way to get your first mini jobs is to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nYou can start earning money in a matter of weeks with small gigs on freelancing websites like Upwork.\n\nAt the same time, you can gradually build yourself a nice web developer portfolio to get bigger jobs step-by-step.\n\nOnce you feel confident enough, you can start applying for your first entry-level front-end developer jobs.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n5. Golang\n\nGo (or Golang) is an open-source programming language originally developed in 2009 by a team at Google. They wanted to eliminate all the faults and problems they had with other programming languages while keeping all the best features they liked.\n\nTherefore, Go is relatively easy and quick to learn, and you can pick up the basics even with very little prior experience with coding and programming.\n\nGo has a simple and intuitive syntax compared to many other popular programming languages. Also, it’s easy and efficient to use thanks to its cross-platform support.\n\nWhat is Golang used for?\n\nServer-side programming\n\nGame development\n\nCloud services\n\nDistributed networks\n\nIoT\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in Golang?\n\nFirst, you’ll write your program:\n\npackage main import \"fmt\" func main() { fmt.Println(\"Hello World!\") }\n\nThen, you can run your code, which will output “Hello World!”:\n\n$ go run .\n\nShould you learn Golang?\n\nGolang was originally developed by Google to solve Google-sized scaling problems. Therefore, it’s become popular with other companies facing massive scaling challenges, too.\n\nWith a relatively simple syntax and beginner-friendly learning curve, Go has become one of the most popular back-end programming languages out there.\n\nSumming it up: Golang has promising job prospects. Thus, if you want to work in big tech and perhaps land a job at Google, Golang is definitely worth learning.\n\nWhere can you start learning Golang?\n\nGo: The Complete Developer’s Guide (Golang) on Udemy\n\nGetting Started With Go on Coursera\n\nGet Started: The Go Programming Language\n\nLearn Go Programming by Building 11 Projects – Full Course by freeCodeCamp\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n6. HTML\n\nHyperText Markup Language or HTML is used to creating structured content for all websites on the WWW.\n\nInstead of a programming language, HTML is a markup language.\n\nYou can use HTML to create the structure and the content for a web page, such as:\n\nNavigation menus\n\nSidebars\n\nFooter areas\n\nHeadings and paragraphs\n\nLists\n\nEmbedded images and other media\n\nand more\n\nEverything you see on a website is thanks to HTML. The text you are reading right now is an HTML paragraph element.\n\nFor a kick-start into learning HTML, make sure to grab your free HTML cheat sheet below:\n\nWhat is HTML used for?\n\nBuilding the structure web page: sections, rows, columns\n\nCreating individual content elements: paragraphs, headings, lists, embedded images, etc.\n\nShould you learn HTML?\n\nYes!\n\nHTML is very easy to learn, and it’s the foundation of every website and web app you’ve ever used.\n\nYou can learn the basics of HTML over a weekend and start practising your web development skills right away.\n\nFor the best resources for learning HTML, head over to my recommended online courses for learning HTML for beginners.\n\nIf you’re like me and you prefer learning from a book, check out my book review on HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett.\n\nAlso, when you start learning HTML, be prepared to learn CSS and JavaScript, too. These three languages form the basic building blocks of the Web.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n7. Java\n\nJava is one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world.\n\nYou can use Java for a variety of different projects, from coding Android smartphone apps to building complex desktop applications.\n\nAt the time of updating this article, Java holds the 3rd place in the TIOBE Index that ranks programming languages based on how often people search for them on the most common search engines.\n\nThe fundamentals of Java actually stem from C++, but Java is a bit easier to learn and use, especially for beginners.\n\nFor instance, one of the fundamental ideas the developers of Java had was to create a programming language that would allow their code to run on two devices that were nothing alike. That’s where the slogan of Java comes from: “write once, run anywhere“.\n\nThat said, Java is popular across all platforms, operating systems, and devices. This versatility and flexibility make Java one of the most in-demand and highest paying programming languages worldwide.\n\nRead next: What Is the Java Programming Language (And How to Learn It Fast)\n\nWhat is Java used for?\n\nMobile development (Android)\n\nDesktop software (cross-platform)\n\nGame development\n\nBig data technology\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in Java?\n\nclass Main { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello World!\"); } }\n\nShould you learn Java?\n\nIf you’re not sure yet what it is that you want to accomplish with coding, Java could be a good option thanks to its versatility.\n\nAll in all, Java is a great asset to have when you start applying for your first developer jobs.\n\nHowever, you can also find other programming languages that are more beginner-friendly and require less code to create an entire app from scratch. You could try Python or Ruby, for example.\n\nJava is also the most useful programming language for Android mobile development.\n\nIf you wish to become a full-time Android developer, check out these top mobile development courses for Android on Udemy.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n8. JavaScript\n\nNot to be confused with Java, JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.\n\nIt breathes life into websites, making them more interactive, interesting to use, and user-friendly.\n\nAlmost every website on the WWW uses JavaScript.\n\nJavaScript is one of the most popular web development languages and among the most powerful programming languages out there.\n\nTherefore, the JavaScript programming language is a sought-after skill on the job market.\n\nDifferent frameworks and libraries, such as AngularJS and jQuery or React, make using JavaScript for front-end development even more efficient and interesting.\n\nJavaScript is a client-side language itself, meaning that the code is executed on the user’s browser.\n\nHowever, with technologies such as Node.js, it can also be used as a server-side language. This makes JavaScript even more powerful through the additional versatility, ultimately making it a full-stack language.\n\nIf you are new to coding, check out the best way to learn JavaScript (with no experience).\n\nWhat is JavaScript used for?\n\nFront-end web development\n\nBack-end web development (Node.js)\n\nMobile apps with React Native\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in JavaScript?\n\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\n\nShould you learn JavaScript?\n\nIf you want to become a front-end web developer, you have to learn JavaScript at some point. You simply can’t build a full-scale website without it.\n\nPair JavaScript with HTML and CSS and you’ve got a complete portfolio of skills to get your first front-end developer job.\n\nAlso, JavaScript is one of the most popular and best programming languages for web development at the moment.\n\nHence, you won’t have any trouble finding a job once you master JavaScript. Its popularity just seems to grow with new front-end frameworks appearing out of thin air on a regular basis.\n\nIf you’re not sure where to start learning, check out these top JavaScript courses on Udemy.\n\nOnce you feel comfortable with the syntax, you can start building your first Javascript projects for your portfolio website.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n9. Objective-C\n\nObjecive-C is the primary language by Apple for developing programs for Mac OS X and iOS.\n\nFirst developed in the ’80s, Objective-C has since gained momentum along with the growing popularity of iOS.\n\nObjective-C is a powerful and flexible programming language based on the C language. However, it’s not the easiest programming language to learn for beginners.\n\nEven though Objective-C is the most useful programming language for Apple devices, the general trend in app development for Apple’s devices is going in the direction of Swift.\n\nWe’ll see what happens with Objective-C in the future, but for now its still a valuable and necessary programming language to learn for iOS development.\n\nWhat is Objective-C used for?\n\nMobile development (iOS)\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in Objective-C?\n\n#import <Foundation/Foundation.h> int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) { @mylak { NSLog(@\"Hello World!\"); } return 0; }\n\nShould you learn Objective-C?\n\nIf you want to create apps for the App Store, Objective-C is a necessary skill you need to learn.\n\nWhen you start learning Objective-C, be prepared to learn Swift, too. The combination of these two programming languages will give you solid skill set for iOS development for a long time.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n10. Perl\n\nPerl is a high-level scripting language that first appeared in 1987 and has since developed into a small family of two separate languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6.\n\nWhat Perl was originally meant for was text processing and manipulation, but it has since found further applications ranging from web development to system administration.\n\nPerl evolved throughout the years into a powerful tool that can be used on pretty much any operating system on the planet. Therefore, it’s sometimes referred to as the “Swiss army knife” of computer languages, too.\n\nPerl takes its best features from other programming languages such as C, for instance. It’s comparable to PHP or Python to a certain extent, too.\n\nHowever, in contrast to Python, Perl usually offers multiple solutions to a single problem. In this way it’s similar to Ruby, where there’s no one single best way to solve a specific problem.\n\nIf you’re a beginner programmer, keep in mind that Perl comes with a few somewhat daunting features like any other programming language.\n\nFor example, it’s famous for the overflowing use of confusing symbols in its syntax. So, the code might look a bit overwhelming for a beginner at first glance.\n\nWhat is Perl used for?\n\nNetwork programming\n\nGUI development\n\nWeb development\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in Perl?\n\nprint \"Hello World!\\n\";\n\nShould you learn Perl?\n\nPerl is a powerful and versatile programming language. Once you get the hang of it, it’s not that difficult to learn.\n\nHowever, if you want to get a developer job in the future, make sure your potential employers actually use Perl.\n\nSince it’s not the most popular programming language out there, you could run into problems trying to find a company you’d like to work for as a Perl developer.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n11. PHP\n\nPHP is a scripting language running on the server side to create web pages written in HTML.\n\nIt’s a relatively easy language to use for new developers, making it one of the most popular programming languages out there. In fact, 80% of the top 10 million websites currently use PHP.\n\nInterestingly enough, PHP was never really intended to become a programming language. It was originally created to be a toolset to help its creator, Rasmus Lerdorf, maintain his Personal Home Page (PHP).\n\nThat aside, PHP has since become one of the most popular scripting languages on the Web.\n\nBeing a server-side language just like Python or Perl are, PHP can do things such as creating login pages, photo galleries, discussion forums, and much more.\n\nWebsites employing PHP include some lovely treats we all are familiar with, like WordPress, Facebook, and Tumblr.\n\nRead also: Recommended PHP Courses for Beginners\n\nWhat is PHP used for?\n\nBack-end web development\n\nWordPress development\n\nHow do you code “Hello World!” in PHP?\n\n<?php echo \"Hello World!\"; ?>\n\nShould you learn PHP?\n\nSince PHP is easy to get started with, it’s a great choice for a beginner programmer.\n\nAdditionally, PHP is the most useful programming language for WordPress development.\n\nIf you’re planning to become a freelance web developer, PHP is a safe choice: WordPress and other content management systems often use PHP.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best beginner-level PHP course to start learning, check out these top PHP Courses on Udemy.\n\n☝️ back to top ☝️\n\n12.
