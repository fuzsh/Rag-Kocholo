For example on Windows: set FREI0R_PATH=C:\\effects\\\n\nRun ffmpeg: ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf \"frei0r=gyroflow:C_DRIVE_SEP_projects_DIR_SEP_my_project.gyroflow|0.5|n|0.001\" result.mp4\n\nParameters are: project_file_path|smoothness|stabilization_overview|timestamp_scale.\n\nBecause ffmpeg can't accept : or / in parameters, plugin will replace _DRIVE_SEP_ with :\\ and _DIR_SEP_ with /, so you can use parameter: E_DRIVE_SEP_some_folder_DIR_SEP_my_project.gyroflow for E:\\some_folder\\my_project.gyroflow\n\nBuilding from source\n\nGet latest stable Rust language from: https://rustup.rs/\n\nClone the repo: git clone https://github.com/gyroflow/gyroflow-frei0r.git\n\nBuild the binary: cargo build --release\n\nResulting file will be in target/release/ directory\n\nLicensed under either of Apache License, Version 2.0 or MIT license at your option.\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this crate by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions."
