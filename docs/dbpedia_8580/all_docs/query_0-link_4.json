        "text": "Last Updated on July 10, 2021\n\nFreeJ is a vision mixer: an instrument for realtime video manipulation used in the fields of dance teather, veejaying, medical visualisation and TV.\n\nIt features realtime rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering directly on the screen (through dynamically loadable plugins).\n\nFreeJ treats every video source as a layer, making it possible to dynamically apply a chain of filters, loadable as effect plugins and easily customizable. Layers are planned for rendering of analog video input, digital movie files (avi/mpeg), image bitmaps, sound scopes, texts and eventually more.\n\nFreeJ can be controlled locally or remotely, and from multiple places at the same time, using its ascii console interface; operations can be scripted in Javascript and triggered live via keyboard, mouse, MIDI controllers, Joysticks, OSC clients, Wiimotes and more devices.\n\nFreeJ is written with efficiency in mind, benefits of a realtime object oriented architecture that makes efficient use of multithreading (in which the layers run in parallel), also taking advantage of multiple CPUs and cluster systems.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nMix multiple video layers – each layer can be video taken from different sources: movie files, webcams, tv cards, images, rendered text, flash animations and more.\n\nStream online video – produces an Ogg/Theora/Vorbis stream for broadcast on Icecast servers, mixing all the video and grabbing the audio from soundcard.\n\nVeeJay over Ethernet.\n\nLive compositing of multiple webcams, TV signals, movie files, images, TXT files, particle generators and more..\n\nCan be remotely controlled (VJoE).\n\nCan be scripted in procedural object oriented language.\n\nCan playback flash vectorial animations.\n\nNo frame drop when looping movie clips.\n\nEmacs/Vi style console with hotkeys (S-Lang).\n\nAccepts asynchronous controllers at the same time (Midi, joystick and more coming..).\n\nVery efficient video engine with multithreaded layers.\n\nWebsite: github.com/jaromil/FreeJ\n\nSupport:\n\nDeveloper: Denis Rojo, Silvano Galliani, Christoph Rudorff, and many contributors\n\nLicense: GNU GPL v3\n\nFreeJ is written in C and C++.
