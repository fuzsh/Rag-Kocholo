(sort of works with lcd jal example) Tue Apr 2 20:47:56 CEST 2002 1) gdb -- use 'set args -n -blah' for args to debug Wed Apr 3 12:47:58 CEST 2002 1) The packed attribute specifies that a variable or structure field should have the smallest possible alignment---one byte for a variable, and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the aligned attribute. Here is a structure in which the field x is packed, so that it immediately follows a: struct foo { char a; int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed)); }; Thu Apr 4 16:24:55 CEST 2002 1) emacs -nw = open in xterm but not windowy version 2) leaving ap0202 till monday (problems with xp, short single cell of one instruction and maybe reboot problems). fixed bitshift stupid. 3) work on scanner for j. chip GI1904 (m105/gs105 drivers -- both for old kernels and so don't compile). no other info. inside scanner is another undefined mustek chip 4) started work on video sampler based round libbgrab. (grab thread for speed). tested for speed with frame calculation (pref in asm). implemented held 4 sec sequence and lock/unlock . array of pointers to locked/unlocked and diff buffers (after malloc) ---> lots of vgagl stuff gl_line and gl_fillbox (got as far as basic interface) Fri Apr 5 12:48:22 CEST 2002 1) for asm routines -> DWORD aligned means that padding is added to make the byte-length of each row be zero mod-4 (i.e., evenly divisible by 4). 2) to do for vidyo sampler -> one sequence frame eff, seq effs. FRAME effects: mirroring / zoom / pixel [transform.c in freej] / fract / reframe [pos] use simura.c in freej for mirroring also transform is main thing q of needing to convert from rgb565 (16 bit) to rgb32 (32 bit) which most these routines use but should only have to for palette operations [note conversion routines in effectv palette.c if needed] asm ? SEQ effects: direction / speed / fract MIX : straight / cut / mask / diff 3) transform stuff now running to do zoom / pixel and multiply to do: mirroring and maybe use transform for fractal repos is done straight from grabbed buffer (??) transform uses tables ? of only having one transform table for both layers or one per layer (when switch params need to free and reinit); -- or use set of tables. also repos on layers [need to re-organise] also q effect per layer = switchable only or assignable per frame with parameters ? Tue Apr 9 20:45:45 CEST 2002 1) ported suitable frame and sequence effects but issues of speed and memory now working with seqa and seqb (currently just output of seqa) -- to do is mix effects and mixdown buffer + clean up for speed and stop glitches/blackouts with some effect changes 2) use array of pointers to mix effects (even if return just one or other bffr pointr) .. also do lock/unlock for second layer Wed Apr 10 20:11:22 CEST 2002 1) issues/problems with ap0202: a) speed (primarily display q -- if could map mem space directly to sdl every total execution cycle rather than redraw pixels and whole screen for each cell instruction + IP stuff) --> would involve rewrite of locking/sems and also use of sdl surface stuff ... STILL RESEARCH? (got rid of semaphores also) b) how garbage collection works DONE c) todo: cellular communication d) if do modulus instruction set for each instruction then all instructions are valid ??? test either way really q of speed and of cell length e) reading not-own-cell memory (need copy-from-other-cell-function) (new cpofn) DONE f) taking approach of starting with one big cell than going thru it instruction at time is problematic -- original idea of identifying cells then parsing each cellspace is better.. how these big ideas could be done without total rewrite of code could be done just with new cellinit routine. (again multiple cells is speed issue) DONE g) also issue with split -- of reproducing cells and cell collective memory ??? of instructions considered as instructions Thu Apr 11 13:09:29 CEST 2002 1) addressed cpofn -- now works 2) testing memcpy direct to screen -- try flip? -- also need to mark so updates screen each total vm cycle (but now using SDL_HWSURFACE so no need to update screen(?) -- test out palette stuff example: /* Create a display surface with a grayscale palette */ SDL_Surface *screen; SDL_Color colors[256]; int i; . . . /* Fill colors with color information */ for(i=0;i<256;i++){ colors[i].r=i; colors[i].g=i; colors[i].b=i; } /* Create display */ screen=SDL_SetVideoMode(640, 480, 8, SDL_HWPALETTE); if(!screen){ printf(\"Couldn't set video mode: %s\\n\", SDL_GetError()); exit(-1); } /* Set palette */ SDL_SetColors(screen, colors, 0, 256); works for green-screen [also note for vidyo sampler maybe port to sdl for speed?] 3) mrgfn changed to either/or merge back or forwards 4) TODO: channel SDL output -- sep from viewer // works on x with depth 8 and on concole q to quit. 5) TODO: polling on channels Wed Apr 17 19:17:35 BST 2002 1) MIDI stuff to use with ap0202 seems simple enough -- sends SEQ_MIDIPUTC then byte eg: while (1) { read(seqfd, &inpacket, sizeof(inpacket)); // print the MIDI byte if this input packet contains one if (inpacket[0] == SEQ_MIDIPUTC) { printf(\"received MIDI byte: %d\\n\", inpacket[1]); } } [ unsigned char inpacket[4]} #define MIDI_DEVICE \"/dev/sequencer\" int main(void) { unsigned char inpacket[4]; // first open the sequencer device for reading. int seqfd = open(MIDI_DEVICE, O_RDONLY); Thu Apr 18 15:48:19 BST 2002 1) started work agenn on ap0202 -- fixed segfault and float point nonsense 2) tho SDL fullscreen doesn't work on this machine (try non full -- also problems on console tho have libSVGA) runs ok on m15 -- FIX THIS 3) also not running garbage collector as was leaking memory -- TO FIX. 4) shld change so split is cell wall DONE Sun Apr 21 15:04:15 BST 2002 1) filesystem access does seem to hang 2) need to fix so runs without reboot (q of operations on xp itself -- also %isetsz experiments) 3) MIDI -> /dev/sequencer -- midi packet 4 bytes -- [0] is event [1] is midi byte command is 8 bit / data is 7 bit a 144 (+channel) - note on command b key number -data c velocity -data then follows op of noteon - key number again and then zero to signal end of note. don't know about how timing is done 4) ap202: fixed garbage collection i think so does not leak (recursive problem) // using no % on instruction set // back to artm's display Mon Apr 22 15:28:02 BST 2002 1) back to % (whoo) isetsz. more work on gc done. some expts with what to favour. 2) TODO - midi input channel // channel polling maybe Mon Apr 29 10:52:33 BST 2002 PROJECT STATUS /DEVELOPMENT ETC. 1) AP01: changes made: control.c -- can change data sources for entire system. need real-time control TODO: a) PIC video convertors b) laser output // realtime linux c) neural net sampler d) video mixer --> new machine -- 512MB/ extra bttv card // think about fast drives? // --> current status: needs test extra card// see tech.html = think of porting to SDL. think structure is pretty much there e) EEG --> uclinux --> [use parport nibble also instead of card input] have 8 bits on uC f) audio sampler --> test. added record and replay matrix + bcast data inputs 2) AP02: a) fix filesystem code/ test network code over distances b) running without reboot -- see notes from tierra etc c) channel polling [possible to implement channels as seperate threads reading into buffers -- flag also for changing input so fastest possible throughput] d) next step -- python/lisp nodal structure (mebbe glued to c code here) e) cell communication? 3) MISC: a) paint machine b) easy setup of cluster -- see debian automated setup + scyld/mulinux/clusterNFS ... also trim kernels on cluster c) check out plan9 os (+vmware) // also look at gstreamer d) server/firewall/adsl setup --> new small hub e) wireless setup f) ascii vid conf --> to test g) HAND SCANNER ??s Fri May 3 18:29:37 BST 2002 1) in new test1may dir --> now single byte instructions (except set) + re-written some of reparse code -- seems give more variety 2) garbage collection deals with stupid length cells -- could simply just reparse whole memory each time [but need keep cell registers etc. some way of working with cell identity] Mon May 6 12:35:13 BST 2002 1) finally gcollect working (using g_list_insert) -- used in both old + new (test1may) versions -- seems keep diversity. 2) possibly irradiate memory --> bitflip x bytes every y executions 3) tested videomixer app (installed bttv card from m5 in m15 -- swap m5s for other card) -- image flicker + low frame rate -- get nvidia card + extra 256MB ram perhaps Sat May 11 16:18:02 BST 2002 1) fixed ap0202 serious bug in kill code (both versions) -- now improved garbage collection. still variation qs (radiate//templates/threading??) Sun May 12 14:36:55 BST 2002 1) ogg encoding for raw sound files (from ap0202): oggenc -r -C 1 -B 8 -q 5 -R 8000 tst 2) started looking at steppers and laser printer motor for laser display: laser prnter: ta7295p 3 phase dc -- can only think of feeding it pwm from a pic to see if that works steppers 8 wire universal -- can be configured as either uni or bipolar for display control wld be good to use pic (16f877) to handle timing and control. Mon May 13 16:18:36 BST 2002 1) fixed sdl-channel colours and box .. minor changes filesystem code -- seems run ok on one machine hangs on other. can now start from -f 2) output to xterm console (without screwing own console): xterm -e sh -c \"~/ap0202v2/test1may/cells -m 10000 -f -o /dev/tty -s > /dev/null\" [note: xterm -fg green -bg black] 3) using festival and /dev/speech for output of ap0202 --> a) run festival server (in ~/vox/festival/bin) b) use perl script (speechd.pl) in ~/vox to start daemon c) -o /dev/speech Fri May 17 23:51:00 BST 2002 1) playing with 9600 -- compiles with SDL (SDL library must be with executable) using MPW (build, whereis, files -- commands in mpw shell) 2) using find: find / \\( -path '/proc' -prune -o -size +4000k -ls \\) > err2 ::pipes to err2 all files bigger than 4000k and ls'ed (except those in proc) find / \\( -path '/proc' -prune -o -size +4000k -exec du -h {} \\; \\) > err2 :: executes du-h on files as above Sun May 19 01:10:47 BST 2002 1) work on PIC16F877 project with jonnie: -(notes: use /usr/bin/gpasm to assemble) -- in skin dir test2.asm/hex is rc2/ccp1 pwm with changing duty cycles to give 2 tones // also change period but must be shorter than duty cycle todo on pic before go to switzerland: 1) as pre-test for data use adc to change frequency 2) check out data sheets and possibilities for monday -- order (ST or infineon?) 3) battery and 10mH coil -- RS 228-343 Sun May 19 15:57:42 BST 2002 1) works well with ADC code (test3.asm/hex) Mon May 20 21:52:25 BST 2002 1) autogen for cvs gstreamer needs latest libtool and automake Tue May 21 14:30:14 BST 2002 1) PCB software to make pcbs needs tex .... Tue Jun 4 23:35:16 BST 2002 1) re-install woody on laptop ... re-compile kernel for debian: (make menuconfig // make-kpkg clean // make-kpkg -rev Custom.N kernel_image --initrd // dpkg --install /usr/src/kernel-image-VVV_Custom.N.deb ) 2) ap0202: -f fileystem hangs from root ... TO FIX [ shared memory seems limited for non-root user on suse box] todo list for ap0202 to check ... + vector stuff wld be nice + with drawing robot TODO:-> threading, filesystem, test network, mapfile code Wed Jun 5 21:33:23 BST 2002 1) ap0202: fixed -f hanging shmem seems ok for user started on threading but slow to fill first bit Thu Jun 6 12:54:15 BST 2002 1) fixed most of debian woody problems. wireless card was not loading orinoco_cs as couldn't find in pcmcia -- so load by hand then restart pcmcia try adding to /etc/modules --> this seems to work ok ... 2) ap0202: threading doesn't keep up with data input -- but works ok with large buffer - done sound in/out theraded todo: filesystem in + net in/out only DONE** -> needs more thoro testing and also can't start with any but pure filesystem code done: -l vector sdl output done: -t sniffer (eth0 root only) -- threaded 3) pd: note: standalone programs \"pd-send\" and \"pd-receive\" are provided that can send mesages to Pd or receive messages from Pd via the netsend~ and netreceive~ objects. This should allow you to interface a wide variety of other programs with Pd either on the same machine or over the network. Also you should be able to hack the code into your own programs to make them interoperate with Pd and/or each other. The underlying protocol is called FUDI. --> see u_pdsend and u_pdreceive in src ... 4) used autoexpect to make an expect script to ftp up this tech.html .. expect script.exp Fri Jun 7 13:20:14 BST 2002 1) ap0202: a) added activity poll in read function for all (vm2.c) b) TODO: need better start routine to fill [now can fill from straight file ... (and video still) + -f also DONE c) improved filesysthred code d) need to look over instruction set again // see below e) DONE mapfile adding code [cgi-bin/pl2.pl] and pl3.pl download page .. TODO message log thing .. really want to wait for adsl server for ap0202 before release. f) QUESTIONS -->1) ricop fnction > ri->cop%isetz // ri->cop&(isetsz-1) or 0 if greater than isetsz & is best solution as retains bitshifts etc. 2) template instructions (nop1, nop2 patterns) for se3fn, setfn, ldtfn (is jmp) and jiz 3) from tierra: jmp and jmpb(ack) to templates adr - address of nearest template into ax [our registers are: xp/wp/rp/gp/mp] ax wld be gp adrb/adrf - search bac/forward for template call (push IP onto the stack, jump to template) STACK? 4) question of use of gp to access registers - instructions which use gp as register register = btr/btlfn (bitshift) decfn setfn (alredy hav se3fn so why not all) putfn --> implement above as ops on 0->4 =12 additonal ops jizfn (should just use gp) 5) question of lively -- analyze 6) note: [minitierra] (http://www.csu.edu.au/ci/vol04/eff-tierra/node2.html) Tierran organisms live in the memory of a virtual computer called the soup. Tierra, as implemented, allows for an arbitrary soup size, specified as SoupSize. As the soup is defined with periodic boundary conditions, this implies that every memory operation must be performed modulo SoupSize, which is typically an expensive operation. By restricting SoupSize to a power of two, it is possible to replace the modulo function by a bit-masking operation, which can be done simply by altering the definition of the ad macro as follows: #define ad(A) (A&(SoupSize-1)) /* #define ad(A) ((A) >=0 ? ((A)%SoupSize) \\ : ((SoupSize-(-(A)%SoupSize))%SoupSize)) */ 2) IR drawing bot [for ap0202 to produce drawings] --> /home/marty/cluster/m7/root/infra is code to use .. needs bounded area for IR to reflect to it .. should work then. charging .. also re-design perhaps for smoothness (v jerky) 3) emacs bookmarks C-x r m blah - sets bkmark to point C-x r b blah - opens bkmark C-x r l - lists M-x bookmark-save M-x bookmark-load (just using default files) Sat Jun 8 12:09:18 BST 2002 1) see http://openil.sourceforge.net/about.php (deVIL) for reading image file formats and maybe libsndfile as same for sound? (or use sdl-image library and sdl_sound [http://icculus.org/SDL_sound/] FOR TRANSLATORS (more relevant to data mirroring stuff) Mon Jun 10 12:56:46 BST 2002 1) ap0202 todo +: see above // check out SDL blits // web data (random Ips port 80 ???) // loop thru file (over and over) -loop FILE 2) adsl running (port forwarding accessible from outside on external ip -- artificial.f... // sort new server in DMZ 3) silly zip --> zip im.zip images/* Tue Jun 11 11:21:21 BST 2002 1) ap0202 todo: pl3.pl should PREPEND ip address to mapfile DONE a) ... also want ascii render of run on browser -- code to write web page on server (to build) simple enough (open file .. write stuff // close file) DONE --> writes to buffer which then opens/writes appropriate file (new.html) [reads head and tail for html) doesn't wrap tho (could do this) note: out=open(\"new.html\", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR); b) problems: net stuff problems cellsend / recv to check out also thred bit is bit weak (no intrdcounters etc to sort) also if use -f -w does not write file tho still does do sayfn ..??? --> is problem with dirpath changed by -f filesystem stuff /// solved temp with hardcode /home/newlife/head etc.. 2) update page -- pictures outdated etc. 3) installing debian on server to be : sort dual p100s / memory ? [also memory for 233mmx machine for neural net audio use] Wed Jun 12 19:40:06 BST 2002 1) ap0202: how to solve problem with dirpath except by hardcoding ? fixed thredded net i think 2) woody on server to be. recompile for SMP -- 2 P120s [ note server conifg for dbn: * Configuration files can be found in /etc/apache. * The DocumentRoot, which is the directory under which all your HTML files should exist, is set to /var/www. * CGI scripts are looked for in /usr/lib/cgi-bin, which is where Debian packages will place their scripts. * Log files are placed in /var/log/apache, and will be rotated daily. The frequency of rotation can be easily changed by editing /etc/apache/cron.conf. * The default directory index is index.html, meaning that requests for a directory /foo/bar/ will give the contents of the file /var/www/foo/bar/index.html if it exists (assuming that /var/www is your DocumentRoot). * User directories are enabled, and user documents will be looked for in the public_html directory of the users' homes. These dirs should be under /home, and users will not be able to symlink to files they don't own. ] Thu Jun 13 14:30:53 BST 2002 1) rdev - query/set image root device, swap device, RAM disk size, or video mode use: rdev image 2) fixed -w writing privs -> S_IROTH | S_IRGRP Sat Jun 15 17:26:30 BST 2002 1) agenn possibles for easier install -- could use mulinux mini-distro [create addon -- see documentation in prog/mu when mount -o loop USR in doc/help] but is libc5 allover.. 2) nonsdl version of ap0202.01 [for snd/speech etc. use] Mon Jun 17 00:07:11 BST 2002 1) upgrade debian:- change /etc/apt/sources.list stable --> testing/unstable apt-get update apt-get dist-upgrade 2) changes for rsh no passwd root login: passwd -d root comment out: securetty line in /etc/pam.d/login and rlogin rhosts line in /etc/pam.d/rsh 3) trying to use pack0.2 on artificial and m15: art: not run X m15: no colours on display [fb ?

The following lines need to be added to the \"Device\" section: Option \"ConnectedMonitor\" \"TV\" Option \"TVStandard\" \"PAL-G\" (other options PAL-B,D,G,H,I(supposed be UK) 2) fixed /root/svga/cur to translate 8->16bit audio and back 3) for m15 s-video: option \"TVOutFormat\" \"SVIDEO\" xset s off Sun Nov 17 19:51:31 GMT 2002 1) more ipaq stuff: use:: pppd call PocketPC (refers to /etc/ppp/peers) to get ppp connection over serial Mon Dec 2 21:54:45 GMT 2002 1) upgraded opie and familiar to unstable ;;;; some work with wireless on laptop and ipaq ( http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Orinoco.html ) changes to /etc/pcmcia/config (make sure is orinoco_cs is bound) /etc/pcmcia/wireless and /etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts as important mode: managed (AP) or Ad-Hoc downloaded ext2 modules for 2gb pcmcia drive use recent stuff (+to do):: a) look at MobileMesh (also AODV adhoc on demand distance vector) and meshAP b) micz machine (art-bag,org) // own software using shared memory and ap is on 1010 (tatt.tar.gz) c) flite - festival lite for ipaq (+mbrola different voices) d) some changes to cur (uploaded? version in /root/AP/svga i think) so some operations either on completely mixed buffer or just first buffer e) will soon collect all ap03 nodal notes to start work there (in terms of ap02 fix up laser and new stuff for neusynth + get rid of all broadcast code + think about 3d stuff on m15 (also freeze issue there)) f) re-make of wall thing using large solenoid g) laser blanking Fri Dec 6 02:08:15 GMT 2002 1) more wireless stuff on ipaq: using discoverer ... sets lucent card into rf monitor mode use: iwpriv eth0 monitor 0 (for off) 1 =on also use tcpdump and kismet (need options) once monitor mode is set by discoverer or iwpriv Mon Dec 9 17:42:00 GMT 2002 1) doing nodal notes .. going through older notes ref to ap stuff still to do: a) speed increases (assess % stuff) b) recording cells->hard drive and recall c) activity poll? d) frozen cellspace computation (new space frozen till all cells finished) e) successful cells (TTL>INIT_TTL) written/appended to disk file and used to fill killed cell space 2) also new stuff for vapp/ap02:: a) data interpreted as surface or whatever which can then be used by textures etc. options: toggle// interpretation of buffer data = application of buffer data to 3d interpretation b) multiple data sources (-x [number]) from ap02 c) text of instructions available - shared full cell-space also as buffer d) should be able change order of operations: chunksize=sequence//interpretation/effect/3d interpretation [also maybe chains of each operation level] e) release version with command-line ap on/off shared mem option (+ options for other data sources such as network and 2nd v4l card f) merge latest ap02 stuff and versions (use command-line options for liveap(mapfile) stuff) -- also differences in shared memory versions ... g) clean up mirror/translator stuff 3) before next perf: new stuff above//why m15 crashes nvidia?/newsynth/ get rid of bcast code (and ditch scanner machine) so that rotation/vidswitch and laser machines run ap02 straight (or could run from one machine with multiplexing/pic controllers -> pic controller given instructions) Tue Dec 10 22:44:08 GMT 2002 1) setting up wireless access point on IBM 755CD 486 laptop with woody debian and 3c589d pcmcia network card had problems with \"failed to read MAC address\" on ELSA Airlancer MC-11 card and same problem with orinoco silver card : solved with:: in /etc/pcmcia/config.opts commented out: include port 0x100-0x4ff and used: exclude irq 3 as well as others also some messing with dhcp to start on boot with eth0 (look at /etc/default/dhcp) + /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 [wired card NOT wireless] -j MASQUERADE then /etc/init.d/iptables save active and echo \"1\" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward was put in /etc/init.d/rc.local and then do: chmod 775 /etc/init.d/rc.local update-rc.d rc.local start 99 2 3 4 5 for runlevels and 99 as when should start (at end of process) should also make sure /etc/pcmcia/network stuff and wireless stuff set up correctly in /etc/pcmcia/network.opts use *,1,*,*) address for card eth1 and *,0,*,*) for eth0 Wed Dec 11 16:22:58 GMT 2002 1) maybe rather than recoding much of vapp and ap // coalesce ap options and move towards generic data app with chunksizing/matrices [also notion of 3d matrix over time for ap cellspace and any data - 2d->3rd time or 3d->4th flattened] generic data app: have GUI front-end (as in cur) sending UDP/TCP messages to generic data app (same functionality of both cur and vapp in terms of buffering/mix/matrix-filter operations ... but q of interpretation layer for audio data) how is patchable or can change flow/order of operations without necessarily max approach 2) granular cellular data connection for each ap cell 3) PIC16F877 multiplexing for vidswitch(slow- simple), laser(continuous data stream), rotational(instructions) - could multiplex across 8bit+3or2bits to signal switch/rot and laser. laser control could be on interrupt (F877 - 8bits input// 3 sets 8 bit out (use less for viswitch to allow channel selection but q. is rotation needs 24 bits ... solution. another PIC ?) 4) for ap03 what would differences be of monolithic networked app and thin I/O layer to which mobile (say python) viral apps can rgeister and attach to having been sent over network (python apps sent to machine/layer can then be re-coded and interpreted on the fly) ???? 5) glVertex3f and glTexCoord2f Thu Dec 12 16:57:32 GMT 2002 1) for generic data app (vapp+cur) change m15 ap code so /dev/video access is from data app rather than ap15 :started work on ~/gdapp:: input [key] [value] [space] + data matrix as in cur (see notes) 2) emacs indentation (for C) C x h to select whole as region C M \\ to indent 3) problem is dealing with 4xbuffer parameters -- too much stuff Fri Dec 13 17:45:27 GMT 2002 1) changed ipcop dynamic dns to deal with dyndns-custom editted /var/ipcop/ddns/config still to test Sun Dec 15 22:05:02 GMT 2002 1) doing more work on gdapp - but problems and questions of approach ... as sound/video data different to use in terms of upshift/downshift 8->16 bits and also time differences. so always need to tag as sound buffers for all data ... 2) in ~/gdapp/new re-working ap so can have 2 shared memory channels (sound and video) -x -x (also 5th shared memory ID is whole cellspace) ... to do on ap: (note that cell-size must be > SHRDSIZE(65000 256*256)) a) put back in working -v code // options for liveap problem is broken tail code in this version so no ./vcells functionality hmm... b) other issue is -f not working again with this ap15 code (could be sdl issue) - prob best merge latest ap0202 code -> new and then do -x -x alterations... c) should be able to re-boot ap from shared memory once that's started (use shared memory reboot) Tue Dec 17 00:14:35 GMT 2002 1) progressing with gdapp (on m15 now):: qs: a) effects parameters where ?? (ON GRID --> change ** effp1[x]->) b) that data buffers are converted to RGB565 (rather than for audio ??) c) got as far as basic audio/interface + weights d) upshift audio to 256x256 size buffer /then back down for output is OK e) seems solid enough so far Tue Dec 17 17:06:18 GMT 2002 a) also should have parameters for mix (ie. value how much to mix) b) all stuff (except 3d and extra mixes + some parameters + save weights and file options) in there -- now make it work ??? c) fix sdl colour and opengl colour rgb565 and 32bit stuff ??? d) also fix chunking so is proper Thu Dec 19 00:01:10 GMT 2002 gdapp: a) fixed RGB565->GL texture use GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT_5_6_5 b) fixed chunking -- tested with video only c) fixed rgb2grey d) fixed pound sign + keys in interface - other issue is entering say 10 gives 1 .FIXED - simple bug of >48 ascii code e) fixed mixto using | f) TODO: hookup laptop(wireless) to test full thing so far // why drops out of interface or main without error Fri Dec 20 01:25:02 GMT 2002 gdapp: a) interface fixed on laptop (vesa in libvga.conf) +fixes to sliders b) extra params in interface for reset data (inc. mutate cellular auto) + weights save and recall savw and recw c) fixes to main: data buffers/rgb2grey/ some speedups .etc d) fft and tempo in effects // also q of mixto buffers (? how many?) e) # on laptop keyboard layed out differently f) could use asm copies for speed also (main speed issue is fft) g) fixed effects list h) fixed in ap shared memory write hangs i) need deal with:: 3d interp/weights resets/data resets/more mixes/ ap -f option hang ideas for 3d interp: a) surface and rotation/position b) map to other buffer as heights c) 3d interp: surface/quadratic/triangles/particles/whatever .. chaining? + using fz/cz data for slicing over time (see book) Fri Dec 27 23:27:56 GMT 2002 1) gdapp:: a) fixes to ca problems b) tested and fixed all resets and save keys/weights (but no feedback to interface) -- use * to recall weights c) idea for 3d interp using buffer x and z slice as heightmap d) difficult key interface Tue Dec 31 18:27:14 GMT 2002 1) gdapp:: TODO: a) should probably convert all to 24bit (8bits x3 rgb) from rgb565 to ease most routines (+ do assembly routines for all common functions) ::MAYBE NOT b) break down FFT routines to allow insertion of effects (+sonogram + neural net) into fft data c) modularise d) fixes to overloaded keyboard (switch 1-4 buffer keyboard use -- so not all simultaneous - highlight ) e) saved patches need to show up on interface -- improve communication between GUI and app f) move towards nodal approach thru modularity (look at GNode) - also think about interpreter for commands - create modules for layers (is inout/is process/is output/is interpreter)???? g) old stuff: mixes/fix ap02/3d interp ... basic implementation (with stuff above for speed and useability) frozen then try re-construct with new modular approach (-> input/output/process nodes -also maybe mobile data/executable nodes (see nodalnotes should be there really - nodes as a language -data/software language re-combinable .. also further work on event structure as opposed to a flat data structure - event structure of points in flat data -- constellation of such points to work with all this soon) Sat Jan 4 23:29:40 GMT 2003 1) loaded up gentoo 1.4rc2 some notes (after the fact) a) problems using GRP stuff: have to do: mount -o bind /mnt/cdrom /mnt/gentoo/cdrom so can use cdrom mountpoint in chroot /mnt/gentoo -- not in documentation b) had to symlink some ebuilds for gnome GRP stuff as can't find ebuilds c) made silly mistake when re-compiling kernel (for some reason had problems with nvidia geforce2 card and framebuffer) ... kept on re-compiling and cp to boot but had mounted hda1/boot before hda3/root onto /mnt/gentoo so no change to real /boot 2) lisp in emacs: M-x emacs-lisp-mode M- Read a single Lisp expression in the minibuffer, evaluate it, and print the value in the echo area (eval-expression). C-x C-e Evaluate the Lisp expression before point, and print the value in the echo area (eval-last-sexp). C-M-x Evaluate the defun containing or after point, and print the value in the echo area (eval-defun). M-x eval-region Evaluate all the Lisp expressions in the region. M-x eval-current-buffer Evaluate all the Lisp expressions in the buffer. Tue Jan 7 01:12:39 GMT 2003 1) more work on gdapp done:: (also swapped colour camera into film transfer thing) a) reduced some memcpys b) fixed some transform stuff c) fixed interp layer for small sizes [q now with all small sizes is v flat style] d) messed with gl stuff and first 3d thing in effects layer e) tried mmx stuff with limited success (tho mmxcopy is ok blits are blank ??) f) extra mixes added Thu Jan 9 00:24:42 GMT 2003 1) gdapp:: a) v slow particle thing .. could be texture re-loading? FIXED b) so added particle + heightmap thing c) colour issues with 2nd buffer ap buffers ?? 2) wierd tabs in emacs ?? > use C-q TAB ?? Tue Jan 14 01:23:51 GMT 2003 1) gdapp:: a) lots of fixes/speed ... %where 256 replaced with &255 b) broken down into source files more c) 3d layering done d) stuff such as return values->GUI // toggle framed or not copy (fc[x]) and steps for data (dcounts[x] to fix) to add to interface.c (+ditch default values there) e) final TODO before +assembly +modularise +python interp (with command//var value) = FFT as data source + x ->nn also as data source f) looking at pdp and pdip - useful stuff there is tracking (use as data source) (but funky pdp install as requires older mesa which then screws up gl stuff on m15 ?? OK now with cvs stuff/ maybe is pdip issue?) Tue Jan 14 21:20:52 GMT 2003 1) gdapp:: a) fixed some bugs (interface->server) b) changes to GUI - split keyboard (QWER to select), new fields for fft,nn as data sources and dco and nnc as datastep and nn connection + also roundcopy toggle c) now only nn and fft to sort (nn accepts input given nnconc and output to datasource) fft - array of freq/magn setpped thru ??? Fri Jan 17 00:40:33 GMT 2003 1) fixed liveap/in gdapp directory for -f /xx option (uncommented out sdl stuff) clean and fix up mirror code maybe with no differentiation audio/video ??? 2) yesterday fixes for pall to flashserver pd stuff -- sigpipe handling for closed connections + some other fixes 3) TODO: GUI and step data tests DONE Tue Jan 21 15:07:11 GMT 2003 1) gdapp (yesterday):: a) all mixes (except one) now MMX + other speedups (tables) could do backcopy/roundcopy as MMX ?? b) changes complete copy to copy cells of image (parameter?) c) playing with convolution tables but enabling these slows down whole thing too much (btw. worth remembering in tv out mode geforce2 only gives 800x600 max res so need note in XF86Config) Wed Jan 22 22:51:19 GMT 2003 1) looking at bison (yacc) and flex (lex) ... begin understand how use these and work out data structures etc. for new work. look also at python->c stuff (embedding an interpreter) (embedding interpreter (embed py in c) would mean also extending py with c) 2) brief film-machine (fm) notes: film-machine (fm01) :: fm transposes non-metaphoric systems and grammar theory (of computer languages, abstraction and data containers) to the realm of expanded cinema. the base proposal concerns the development of a language, data structures, and suitable filesystem for the automated production and grammatical expression of endless cinema. a relational, nodal language of connection will be formulated to descend through levels of scene, shot and frame (stored and to be shot). visual and syntactical analysis software will form a large part of the fm engine. however, fm is not totally automated and in parallel with apOS forms a mechanism of personal insertion into systematics. a filesystem will be devised to deal with such fragments in terms of these markers (as language and as data), allowing rapid self-programmed, structural retrieval and re-assembly of material. fm is not conceived as an engine for the manipulation of generic clips (an expanding database of all possible scenes categorised according to a huge number of elements and relations) but is rather an enmeshing within script, a writing of script-now already filmed; a script written and to come via this now-empty machinery. fm is a large-scale project which builds on previous ap research and process to push the envelope of what can be achieved in terms of computer languages and data visualisation; re-thinking hard-wired notions of input and output. Wed Jan 29 01:25:54 GMT 2003 1) more work on gdapp and ap (up against limits of what can do with gdapp in current not-so-modular state) DONE: a) activity polling down with ap so can start up from shared memory (waits for activity before fills cell space) .. but maybe shared write is a bit amiss b) got rid of sound-sized buffer multiplying stuff c) different options for roundcopy & different data sources for cells but should map cellular automata here also (but these are shorts and only calculated if buffer demands - maybe wipe these out of sources for buffers and use here TODO) DONE so (but need put mapping into interface and also test some of this more thoroughly) -- to proceed further with cellular model when re-wrk gdapp d) TODO: lose cx,cy etc from data mappings (and sort cells z zz issues -> used in 3d stuff) DONE somewhat Thu Jan 30 21:23:05 GMT 2003 1) more emacs -- run shell on region: (eg. wc) M-| :contents of region as input for a shell command (also Ctrl-u M-! to insert shell comm into buffer) Tue Feb 4 22:14:21 GMT 2003 1) some strangeness with orinoco/buffalo cards/firmware and tools stuff .. all seems ok with cards as distributed amongst 2 laptops and ipaq (tho tecra 550cdt still has problems maybe due to mismatch wireless tools and patched kernel modules ??) Sat Feb 8 02:10:09 GMT 2003 1) re-installed IPAQ with X/matchbox replacing OPIE (for pd stuff now up and running fine) : using 0.6.1 familiar (failed to boot with 2.18.01 / had to flash with 2.18.54 despite some documentation saying ok with .01) then re-installed 0.6.1 and lots of new packages (dillo to test also) wireless up and running with buffalo but lots of work with kismet (see: http://grox.net/misc/ipaq/kismet/ ) modified scripts to suit quirks of own wireless set up (in this case need to do ifconfig eth0 up to get kismet to work / also set mode from ad-hoc to managed) seems work out start and stop scripts (but still with tecra issue with IBSS/ad-hoc not able to be set to any) wavemon also wierd on ipaq (to test: segfaults) Mon Feb 10 22:03:07 GMT 2003 seem to have lost stuff from 14 jan -> now (was here / now not ??) found now in /tmp/ange-ftp inserted above-| mostly related to gdapp and ipaq IPAQ: now using X and matchbox rather than opie .. using scripts to start/stop kismet scanner) ... some issues on laptops with orinoco cards not working until set essid (with iwconfig) note: in familiar documentation says is ok use older bootloader with: bootstrap-v061-01.jffs2 but must use: bootldr-2.18.54.bin GDAPP/AP: 1) ap (on m15/in gdapp tar.gz) now polls for activity during read and also at start (ie. will wait for activity on start with ./cells -m100000 -x -x uses second -x shared video output as source with gdapp) TODAY:: 2) lots more fixes etc. to gdapp as stands // + some stuff to do ... sources for small blocks 3) TODO: some convolution blurry stuff would be nice Sun Feb 16 01:04:55 GMT 2003 1) GDAPP/AP: a) done sources on interface for blocks x,y // xx,yy // z,zz b) done conv on interface for convolutions (various) c) tested with controlbox (needed to change some cflags so inline asm would function properly + also some tweaking of values: HOW and *0.1 in weightings) but seems to function nicely enough (with new-ish battery also) d) other minor fixes but still some edges in gl stuff ????

TO REPLACE (inc TV OUT) 2) getting to grips with dv stuff (is not IIDC uncompressed camera input but rather Dv compressed) NOTES:: a) key modules are dv1394 [frame-oriented and completely encapsulates the handling of DV over 1394. Prior to dv1394, video1394 has been used in conjunction with user space application code from Kino, libdv/dvconnect, and Cinelerra. It proved to be too difficult to get reliable results across a range of devices using that approach, and thus dv1394 was implemented. With dv1394 one can read and write dv1394 devices exactly as if they are raw DV files. However, for more robust operation and status feedback, it supports IOCTL, polling, and mmap-ed buffers. Finally, dv1394 support simulatenous operations limited by the number of DMA contexts on your host adapter.] --is used in latest dvgrab 1.2 and video1394 which seems more for IIDC input and DV output (investigate further) b) key libraries are: libraw1394 (raw capture) and libdv (de-compression) c) key apps are: dvgrab, playdv in libdv and ...> d) dvgrab raw format (as played by playdv) is 28M for 8secs (2GB max addressable= total of 9.5 minutes) e) investigating possibilities of dv and vloopback (see capture and effectv stuff - tho can't get capture to function prpoperly -- gone-- -- through callbacks etc) Mon Jun 9 21:44:11 BST 2003 1) checking out lisp stuff on druh machine - cmucl and sbcl installed and can run via emacs using ilisp (but not much progress with cliki as can't get past proxying/running lisp stuff for Araneida (this seems load up ok in sbcl but can't interpret necessary after-stuff to create include file for apache) Tue Jun 10 14:10:34 BST 2003 1) finally running with proxying and araneida: a) fresh apache install compiled for all proxy stuff but don't think that was problem: just careless syntax // is now:: ProxyVia On ProxyPass /nyett/ http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ProxyPassReverse /nyett/ http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ErrorLog /var/log/apache/proxyerror b) run M-x ilisp-mode then load up and run araneida/cliki with: (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op \"araneida\") then ilisp-eval-buffer on lisp stuff which fires up handlers (in testar.lisp) then sample code to eval for html: (define-patterns example-patterns (((page :any) :rewrite (html (head (title \"Araneida: \" ?title)) (body ?body))) ((h1 :any) :rewrite (p ((font :size \"+2\" :color \"green\") ?*))) ((red :any) :rewrite ((font :color red) ?*)) ((p :any) :preserve))) (define-page ((merge-url *araneida-url* \"/rewritten\") :patterns example-patterns :changed-time (get-universal-time)) '(page (title \"foo\") (body (h1 \"title\") (p \"hello \" (red \"red\") \" world\")))) (from daniel barlow examples) 2) just get cliki running now:: runs now using test function in handler.lisp (run as (in-package :cliki) (test) ) had make changes (from daniel barlow): (install-handler *root-handler* *cliki-instance* \"http://fm01.druh.co.uk/cliki/\" nil) (+ further tweaks to apache -- is running as latest apache2 but should-- change this: DONE ) Wed Jun 11 15:39:26 BST 2003 1) sound input on RME 96/24 card using rmedigi96control app works fine (tho. needed alsa's libasound2-dev) 2) cliki all running after further tweaks to url back to DV stuff: libdv-0.99/playdv/playdv testnew001.dv --disable-audio -V2 changed capture_0.2.0/capture.c (now in subdir capture_0.2.0/ca..) as would just hang changed handler stuff to if (length >16) and now works (16 is funny packet -> see comments in dvgrab to explain this) capture uses raw ieee // dvgrab uses LIBDV_DV1394 3) tearing/flicker -

but that's not too bad) some changes to ap code (but springs/speed of hd coils is problem maybe - also poor DAC and latching maybe -> could try with soundcard) // or rather uses system on/off blanking with one HD bit and spinning/scanning motor Tue Sep 2 21:33:15 BST 2003 1) fixed sound on tecra 550cdt - was using oss ad1848 but was giving overruns so compiled snd-cs4232 driver under alsa - ran alsaconf and now works fine (tho mixer is strange) 2) installing gentoo 1.4 on ibm t20 - so far so good with soundcard cs46xx and eepro100 + vga=773 in grub.conf 3) note: cvs -d:ext:artpara@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/fm01 co gdapp Fri Sep 5 17:34:30 2003 1) further t20 notes : a) problems with orinoco card after 2 or 3 inserts getfirsttuple business (tried ignore_css to no avail -also re-emerged pcmcia_cs) -(NOT ?) FIXED - lost pcmcia from kernel, re-emerged pcmcia-cs then HAD TO put i82365, and ds into modules autoload stuff ; and also copied /etc/init.d/net.eth0 to net.eth1 but still does tuple business and now -> orinoco_lock() called with hw_unavailable - seems to be working now - excluded irq3 but think may be something else b) kismet doesn't want to write dump file so need to start without dump option (-n) -FIXED - added %h to logfile options in kismet.conf c) clisp refused to compile ??? use clisp-2.30.ebuild rather than r1 d) note cvs add -kb for binaryfile e) strangeness with aclocal - runs 1.4 or 1.7 for some reason f) use etcat -u package to see what use tags can be used g) note acpi in kernel over-rides apm so lose the acpi here h) using mplayer for dvd: mplayer -dvd 1 -dvd-device /dev/cdroms/cdrom0 i) fm01 and gdapp on t20: -a) ./configure prefix=/usr -b) compiled python2.3 from source with --enable_shared --prefix=/usr -c) SDl_console newer version so had change console.h (#include ) 2) started using calendar on emacs on t20 -> M x calendar i d - insert entry for date over i b - after select block for block of dates m - show diary entries d - show entry for current date s - show all diary entries q - exit C-x < - scroll left C-x > - right space -

try patches to gqcam). 2) DVD playing jerky under mplayer - tried hdparm -c1 -d1 -u1 /dev/hdc fine for ogle but can't get x11 to run xv module (loads ok but xvinfo reports no devices -> tried new savage driver, tried re-compile earlier X but failed on sis stuff ... now xvideo is working with binary 4.1.0 X Tue Oct 7 15:04:37 BST 2003 preparing stuff for weimar and norway -> on m15 currently 1) using two USB CPIA webcams simultaneously hangs machine (most of the time) - managed work it once with various echo usb_alt_setting: 3 (or 1) > /proc/cpia/video0 and need to run xawtv for changes such as toplight to effect it but does not seem stable solution ... will have to replace webcam on film thing with bttv/composite combination (or get proper microscope/composite) film thing still wierd - need better solution Fri Oct 10 23:46:07 BST 2003 1) usual debian woes on mini machine: a) compiling kernel needs ncurses, initrd-tools and few other things + really need to enable all options to get initrd functioning b) needed to wrap inline assembly in \"...;\" for each line for some reason - is gcc 3.3 not liking multi-line string literals c) to test: composite out and usb webcamming - use latest cpia for this d) composite out working with driver from: http://www.blackfiveservices.co.uk/EPIATVOut.shtml Wed Oct 15 21:40:03 BST 2003 1) thinking about way of triggering low frequency oscillators (or rather what good osc circuit is) for Ultrasound Sat Oct 25 21:49:26 BST 2003 1) trying to do streaming video over wireless - issues with mpeg4ip started using ffserver -> latest cvs gives green images (avi seems best) but older tar.gz release works (is q slow to buffer tho and have sizes wrong - to adjust) Thu Oct 30 13:51:23 EST 2003 1) mini-itx box is fussy about mouse (?) - need swcursor type stuff 2) latest pidip seems incompatible with pdp (xshm stuff) Sun Nov 9 19:49:34 GMT 2003 1) piping added between ap (on laptop under oldlap/AP/liveap - is -c option eg ./cells -m10000 -v -c (to test video) then start gdapp (uploaded to cvs + ftp pix) - works just with this input now - (not green but colours) completed during piksel should also use with pdp/pidip piping from ap02 Thu Nov 13 22:52:14 GMT 2003 1) re-visiting morphix/trom script - must remember to make base morphix file and then mainmod then make iso (also remove -nobak option from mkisofs commands so keeps ~ used in pd examples) - changed motd (should change splashscreen also) - added ksimet, pd. asciicam (now fixed) and changed some names of stuff + latest ap with sniff etc. -> still doesn't work tho. -> needs to be re-done from scratch i think Wed Dec 3 10:27:33 GMT 2003 1) few notes - installed NetBSD on IBM Z50 without problems (128 MB flash is q small tho - base and etc only) + can't seem to work out power management stuff 2) main PC (dual P3) freezing maybe once a day - using range of tests - lm_sensors under gentoo: - sensors_detect, /etc/init.d/lm blah start and then sensors (reported low core voltage so increased 0.2 in bios but now it does seem to get hot (over 60) when using burnP6 (burnMMX also - part of cpuburn tools). others: stress for all stressing and badblocks - memtest86 revealed faulty memory swapped in from other machine - will see what happens -> now running 2.6.0-test9 with no problems - even testing stress with mplayer fast forwarding thru avi runs without problems Fri Dec 5 22:47:55 GMT 2003 1) mirroring code for webpage creation/ap on ap02serv 2) changed much filesystem code - ap on laptop but also tar.gz on site - segfaults tho if deals with 44100 in translation/channels - kindof fixd so runs fine now - few other problems but ok (will not mirror to shared file anyways - to fix) Fri Dec 12 19:43:42 GMT 2003 1) fixed webpage mirroring code +sharedmem mirrorcode + filesystem issues should run ok now (still occassional segfaults v hard to track down) NOTE: IBM T20 - v noisy audio out from headphone sockets ONLY when connected to power supply ???? Sat Apr 3 22:32:48 2004 1) tho most tech notes now on fm01 site v good to put generic stuff here - such as over past few days here at CLUI: a) failed to get openGL/DRI running on Sony VAIO 502 which uses Rage 3D Mobility P/R - both using gentoo xfree-drm package (which gives kernel exception) or retinalburn DRI stuff (which hangs) - tried many things such as no FB, options in xfree86config and ACPI in kernel but no luck so using gdapp with simple screen (recoded some of reducer function as video 255x255) b) started playing with Magellan Meridien GPS unit - using gpsdrive and gpsd (set baud rate on GPS to 4800 and using /dev/ttyS0) also tested gpsman -all work fine if started with unit up and running on gpsdrive - use x to add waypoints also gps tool in gps3d package with viz - howto mentions trackfiles : If you want to capture RAW NMEA gps output to build your own track files, you can use something along the lines of: ./gps | grep -i '$GP' which doesn't seem to do much example output of ./gps : 34.026 -118.395 00029 21h 49m 54.42s 05 (Latitude Longitude Altitude UTC NumberOfSatellitesUsedForFix) c) trying to remember profiling tool used for gdapp - think was gprof which needs to be compiled with -gp in think d) automake/autoconf stuff screwed up for gdapp TO FIX Tue Oct 5 10:15:47 BST 2004 1) again most tech stuff is now elsewhere but report on getting Telefonica's supplied Zyxel (model ?) wireless ADSL modem/router to work may be useful: all documentation shows Windows only setup tool. can however be configured by plugging supplied cable into console socket on router and serial port of laptop. then run minicom with Bps/Par/Bits:9600 8N1 boot up router and you will have access to setup screen. for own purposes following settings for modem (internet access) menu: PPOE, multiplex as LLC, QoS as CBR and NAT as SUA only (not full featured) alternatively: use browser pointing to 192.168.1.1 user: admin pass: 1234 2) some annoying stuff in installing pango (or anything relying on fontconfig) under gentoo - emerge pango, starts to build then : /usr/lib/libfontconfig.so: undefined reference to `FT_Get_PS_Font_Info' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Stream_GetShort' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Stream_ExitFrame' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Stream_GetLong' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Stream_Seek' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Get_Next_Char' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Stream_EnterFrame' /usr/lib/libfontconfig.so: undefined reference to `FT_Get_BDF_Property' /var/tmp/portage/pango-1.4.1/work/pango-1.4.1/pango/.libs/libpangoft2-1.0.so: undefined reference to `FT_Get_First_Char' tried re-install freetype, fontconfig, xfree (falls over on fontconfig) solved by removing all traces of freetype and then installing very latest freetype, and fontconfig fontconfig-2.2 freetype-2.1.9 next step is get gtk building - done Tue Oct 12 17:52:07 2004 1) to get raw 44100, signed linear audio from divx for use by new cur file read buffer (buffer 6): mplayer file.avi -dumpsound -dumpfile file.mp3 mpg123 -m -s -v file.mp3 > raw sox -t .raw -w -c1 -s -r48000 raw -c1 -s -r44100 -w -t .raw output Mon Oct 18 12:15:33 2004 1) on remote machine reboot failed with: init: timeout opening/writing control channel /dev/initctl solved with reboot -f Mon Nov 1 17:11:38 2004 1) at piksel04 - usual tech things a) new version of liveap. on lap. /home/newlife/liveap-ppsndcard # ./cells -m10000 -f / -e 100 with -e as using parallel port soundcard and parameter value as step so can slow down frequency - as yet untested though should do so -works fine b) looking into possibility of combining 74HC14/74HC240 nv net things with parallel port based soundcard - to be breadboarded c) some lisp stuff - put here as cliki down - under sbcl for setq to work (outside context eg. as global var): eg: (proclaim '(special *procs* *proc* *cont*)) (setq *cont* #'identity) [but in PG On Lisp example *cont* is not a special variable - but sbcl says is unbound - only if is compiled and not evaluated ???????] d) new lunchbox work - testlinux2 to transfer to lunchboxes and is kind of untested. writes audio from mic to named pipe which can be netcat to pd patch. Mon Feb 28 14:04:30 2005 1) need do more with netcat and further automate pd patch as to mixing: a) boxes start: first: cat /root/snd | netcat -l -p portno /then/ testlinux2 b) nc IP port > test (all fifos as in script) c) pd started with new pd patch: pd -lib ext13/piperead~ -open lunch4-auto.pd 2) notes for RME Multiface - works fine with jack and pd but not alsa and pd. more notes to follow basic use for pd: run: a) hdsploader (after cold boot with card+multiface all in and on) and hdspmixer (tho how routing relates to jack is tricky one - but does do volumes) b) jackd -d alsa -d hw:2 c) qjackctl for patching d) pd -jack -inchannels 12 -outchannels 12 -r 48000 (and use dac~ object with channels specified) create sample test hdsp patch (freqmod2) DONE shell: ------------------------------------------------------------- #!/bin/bash /usr/bin/hdspmixer & sleep 1 /usr/bin/jackd -d alsa -d hw:2 & sleep 4 /usr/bin/pd -jack -inchannels 12 -outchannels 12 -open /usr/lib/pd/doc/3.audio.examples/A07.frequency.mod2.pd -r 48000 & sleep 1 /usr/bin/qjackctl & -------------------------------------------------------------- code also from hdsptester.c what we want-> how HDSP matrix thing for cur will work - we want 8/10 outputs so can do gains on these on hardware mixer buffers routed thru matrix to say 3 or 4 outs and other inputs routed with volumes changed or: 8 outs from 8 ins + 2 output buffers on line ins left/right + all ins can route to 2 capture buffers -> cur2-sdl-rme: a) sine wave frequency as data src +8 channels ap data srcDONE + pipe data src b) alsify + 2 in/out buffers -> line out RME + data src assign input -> buffersDONE c) 8 channels volume : init somehow + like: from hdspmixer HDSPMixerWindow.cxx snd_ctl_elem_value_set_integer(ctl, 0, in); snd_ctl_elem_value_set_integer(ctl, 1, out); snd_ctl_elem_value_set_integer(ctl, 2, value); where route in->out and max value is 65535 or in jack code: hdsp_set_mixer_gain(jack_hardware_t *hw, int input_channel, int output_channel, int gain) or is q of init code really DONE see code d) extra ap data sources DONE e) fixed huge number bugs (esp with pre_playbuffer) which should be back-ported using gdb: up and down for stack frames info locals for variables using electric fence for memory allocation problems: -lefence in makefile, run code in gdb will segfault on any allocation/overewrite problem f) now is interrupt-driven and threaded g) added micro function for granular synthesis 3) diy 4 channel soundcard - uses resistor DACs and four 74ls373 latches. code as follows now in ap-multiplex version: for (multi=0;multi<4;multi++){ pc->wrcounter++; if (pc->wrcounter>PPSIZE) pc->wrcounter=0; //enable high outb(mul[multi],0x37A); if (pc->writebuf[pc->wrcounter]>128) outb(255,0x378); else outb(0,0x378); //possible delay? usleep(1000); outb(0^0x0b,0x37A); } 4) lisp stuff can live here: setup of cmucl on current laptop - fedora core with apt + planet ccrma: asdf is automatically loaded by cmucl so (for say cl-sdl): (push #P\"/path/to/uffi/\" asdf:*central-registry*) (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'uffi) Tue Mar 15 16:12:28 2005 1) to re-encode vcd to avi: mencoder vcd://0 -oac lavc -ovc lavc -aspect 4:3 -o output.avi 2) findings with planet ccrma/ own kernels: 2.6.9 own - no realtime patching. xruns and clicks under rme-pd-jack test script as above 2.6.10rdt - hdsploader loads automatically. all realtime patches. clicks and xruns as above but not so bad 2.6.10-2.1.11 - hdsploader as above. best performance with no clicks/xruns 3) where in kernel is segfault signalled? - signalled by CPU -> kernel 4) done backport of fixed cur-rme code to ordinary sndcard TO TEST TESTED/COMPLETED see code TO TEST ALSO latest adds to rme multiface version Wed Mar 16 18:19:23 2005 1) working on crash issues/questions and perhaps towards promiscuous OS / promiscuous GNU/Linux project which features: a) no access control b) promiscuous net I/O and attachment to all I/O as data code/sources for flat code/data memory (again question is of a VM model for this or just rebuild/patch kernel and overlay apps c) executes any code/data d) nor protected mode (but priveleged kernel avoids system crash?) thus research which includes following urls: http://www.linux-mag.com/1999-07/kernel_04.html http://www.phrack.org/show.php?p=61&a=7 http://www.cs.umb.edu/cs444/classnotes23.html http://lists.rlug.org/pipermail/rlug/2004-March/002729.html segfault: occurs when an invalid page table entry is encountered by the MMU - a hardware trap (like an interrupt see arch/i386/kernel/traps.c) which causes kernel to jump to page fault handler (arch/i386/mm/fault.c) - if caused by virtual memory ref to a bad address page fault handler will kill process note we're just in userspace as in kernel space is all physical memory (oops in this case) relevant function is do_page_fault what happens if we ignore page fault? 1) if re-executes faulty instruction = infinite loop 2) if skip instruction what is destination register of the load? other notes on vm : process makes reference to place in virtual memory space not yet existing in physical memory virtual addresses are converted to physical addresses by processor based on information held in tables maintained by OS (how this works) if page table entry (PTE) is invalid -> page fault flags in PTE contains valid and invalid flag access control is also in page table - fields in PTE are processor dependent (ie. if accesses/writes/tries execute memory it shouldn't) Linux has 4 level hierarchical page table thing VMA - virtual memory area descriptor is a high level desciption of region of process's page table - see exploit as above see also: mm/ pageattr.c fault.c init.c pagetable.c 2) other areas of current research: a) building beam-based audio hardware - patch and re-patch using clothes-pegs/foil/wire between say 24 NV and NU neurons (based on 74HC14) + throw in 4 DACs (as used before - resistor ladder) + 74HC240 and diodes with 1M pots as connectors also (in peg wiring) +where to put diodes IN4148 type also all ordered but may need 0.01 uf for NV/NU CONSTRUCTED - images here b) simulation in software as above: look at: http://www.piclist.com/techref/net/infi/home/http/~wtnewton/otherwld/selfwire.html c) back to neural networks in software with emphasis on ART (Adaptive Resonance Theory) : port of neuralsynth (Hopfield) nn audio -> sdl DONE - re-acquaint functions and parameter and possibly as data/process in cur : ART used for nn audio - categorising d) linking and indexing within emacs for larger texts - also maybe use of remembrance agent : we can use bookmarks for text(p106 o'reilly) or etags(p272) for code (need run etags *.[ch] first) and possibly some functionality in slime which is already there for index/cross-ref but what really want is linking system see also: hyperbole: http://directory.fsf.org/hyperbole.html thing-mode: http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/software/thing/thing-mode.html Thu Mar 17 19:54:25 2005 1) emacs work as outlined above: **bookmarks: set: C-x r m get: C-x r b list: C-x r l **slime: see also M-x describe-mode M-. - jumps to definition of symbols at point m-, - jump back also cross-referencing: C-c C-w c - who calls function C-c C-w r - who references global var **other emacs/slime notes: slime-hyperspec-lookup - browser changed to w3 and w3 installed from cvs but doesn't work (displays nothing) in my emacs version which has url stuff installed maybe try w3m seems to work ok **slime further: M-( :inserts both the open and the closing parenthesis and then leaves the cursor between the two After filling in the LISP form"
