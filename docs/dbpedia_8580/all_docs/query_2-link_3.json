        "text": "C is a procedural programming language with a static system that has the functionality of structured programming, recursion, and lexical variable scoping. C was created with constructs that transfer well to common hardware instructions. It has a long history of use in programs that were previously written in assembly language.Â\n\nC programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation in the process of learning any other programming language. Operating systems and diverse application software for computer architectures ranging from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems are examples of such applications.\n\nWhat is the C Language?\n\nThe C language is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It provides a straightforward, consistent, powerful interface for programming systems. That's why the C language is widely used for developing system software, application software, and embedded systems.\n\nThe C programming language has been highly influential, and many other languages have been derived from it. For example, C++ and Java are two popular modern dialects of C.\n\nAnd C is an excellent choice for system programming, for example, developing operating systems, compilers, and network drivers. Despite its popularity, C is not without its criticisms. Some have argued that its syntax could be more complex and easier to learn, while others have noted its lack of standardization as a significant issue. Nevertheless, C remains a widely used and influential language and will probably continue for many years.\n\nHistory of C language\n\nThe C programming language was created at Bell Laboratories in the early 1970s, mainly by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. For the UNIX operating system, which at the time required applications to be written in assembly language, programmers needed a more user-friendly set of instructions. Assembly programmes, which communicate directly with a computer's hardware, are lengthy and complex to debug, and adding new functionality requires a lot of time and effort.\n\nThompson's first high-level language was namedÂ B after the BCPL system programming language on which it was built. Thompson rewrote B to better match the demands of the modern time, better system hardware after Bell Labs purchased a Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) UNIX system model PDP-11. As a result C, the B's successor, was created. By 1973, C had matured to the point that it could be used to rewrite the UNIX operating system.\n\nOther programmers needed documentation that detailed how to use C before it could be utilized effectively outside of Bell Labs. In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's book \"The C Programming Language,\" sometimes known as K&R or the \"White Book\" by C enthusiasts, became the canonical source for C programming. The second edition of K&R, first published in 1988, is still commonly accessible as of this writing. Based on the book, the first, pre-standard version of C is known as K&R C.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, C developers sought to build standards for the language in order to prevent others from developing their own dialects. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard X3.159-1989 became the official U.S. standard for C in 1989. In 1990, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard. These standards, as well as their later updates, are referenced in C versions after K&R. (C89, C90 and C99).\n\nThe 1980s saw a surge in operating system development, with C and its use in UNIX being only such instances. Despite its advancements over its predecessors, C was still difficult to use for creating larger software programmes. As computers got more powerful, there was a growing demand for a more user-friendly programming environment. This desire pushed programmers to use C to create their own compilers and, as a result, new programming languages. These new languages may make it easier to code complex operations with many moving elements. For example, object-oriented programming, a programming method that maximizes a programmer's ability to reuse code, was eased by languages like C++ and Java, both of which were derived from C.\n\nBenefits of C Language Over Other Programming Languages\n\nC is a powerful programming language that offers several benefits over other languages.Â\n\nC is a universal language that can be used for various applications.Â\n\nC is a very efficient language that can write code that is both fast and reliable.Â\n\nC is a portable language, meaning that code written in C can be easily compiled and run on various platforms.Â\n\nC is a well-established language with a large and active community of developers constantly working on improving and creating new tools and libraries.\n\nKey Features of C Programming Language\n\nC is a general-purpose computer programming language for system administration, network programming, and embedded software.Â\n\nIt has several features that make it desirable for these applications:Â\n\nC program syntax is easy to learn and read; this makes debugging code more accessible and faster.\n\nC programs are relatively short compared to other languages, which reduces the time needed to complete them.\n\nC is a powerful programming language that enables developers to create sophisticated software systems.Â\n\nThe language is fast, efficient, and easy to learn, making it a popular choice for many applications.Â\n\nC is also portable, meaning that programs written in C can be easily ported to other platforms.\n\nC has been around for many years (it was first released in 1979), so many libraries and tools are available that facilitate its use.\n\nC Basic Commands\n\nLetâs write a simple C program using above operators to print hello world:-\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main (void)\n\n{\n\nÂ Â Â Â printf(\"\\n Hello World \\n\");\n\nÂ Â Â Â return 0;\n\n}\n\nExplanation of above code:\n\nAs it can be easily seen, the programme starts with a #. Any line in the C programming language that begins with a # is handled with by the preprocessor at the first stage of the program's execution, the first thing that happens during compilation of this programme is that the line beginning with # is replaced by whatever is in the stdio.h header file.\n\nThe following line is 'int main (void)'. This is the start of a function called main, which returns an integer (int) value and takes no arguments (void). It's important to note that every C programme we'll see contains one or more functions. The 'Main' function is where the program's execution begins once it has been run. While all other functions are called from within main or other functions (allowing us to customize the order in which they are called), main is called first from within the system.\n\nAfter that, you'll notice a curly bracket ({). This essentially determines a function's initial scope. Usually, near the end, you'll notice a reverse curly bracket (}), which indicates the function's end of scope. All of the instructions contained within these brackets are handled as a portion of the function's body.\n\nIn the body of the main function, there are two lines of code. 'printf(\"\\n Hello World \\n\"); . Printf is a function in the system library that outputs formatted strings to STDOUT.It prints anything anyone type inside double quotes (\" \") except escape sequences (such as '\\n', which is converted to a newline). 'return 0' is the second line of the body. It essentially signals the end of the main function and returns '0' to the function that was called main.\n\nUltimately, we may expect this code to produce 'Hello World' as its output.\n\nUse of C and Key Applications\n\nC is one of the oldest and most fundamental programming languages, and it is extensively used all over the world. C is a fast, portable language with a large library. It is a middle-level language with the advantages of both low-level and high-level languages. And it's disheartening to learn that C programming is becoming less popular by the day. C has left an indelible mark on practically every field and is widely used for application development and system development.\n\nSome applications of the C programming language include:\n\nOperating System\n\nThe C programming language was created with the intention of writing UNIX operating systems. Furthermore, the execution time of programmes written in C is comparable to that of assembly language, making C the most important component in the development of multiple operating systems. It was used to write the Unix kernel, Microsoft Windows utilities and operating system apps, and a large portion of the Android operating system.\n\n3D Movies\n\nApplications written in C and C++ are commonly used to make 3D videos, because they handle a large quantity of data and do many computations per second, these apps must be extremely efficient and quick. The less time it takes for designers and animators to create movie shots, the more money the corporation saves.\n\nIntermediate Language\n\nC is occasionally used by implementations of other languages as an intermediate language. This method can be used for portability or convenience, as it eliminates the need for machine-specific code generators by using C as an intermediate language. C includes certain characteristics that aid compilation of generated code, such as line-number preprocessor directives and optional unnecessary commas at the end of initializer lists. However, some of C's flaws have encouraged the creation of additional C-based languages, such as, that are expressly designed for usage as intermediate languages.\n\nPlay Important Role in Development of New Programming Language\n\nThe program written in C is easy and quick to execute. As a consequence, the C programming language has resulted in the creation of many other languages. C++ (also known as C with classes), C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Verilog, D, Limbo, and the Unix C shell are examples of these languages. Every language employs the C programming language to varying degrees. Python, for example, uses C to provide standard libraries, whereas C++, PHP, and Perl need C for their syntaxes and control architectures.\n\nEmbedded Systems\n\nThe C programming language is the recommended language for creating embedded system drivers and applications. The availability of machine-level hardware APIs, as well as the presence of C compilers, dynamic memory allocation, and deterministic resource consumption, make this language the most popular.\n\nHow is the World Powered by C?\n\nIn today's world, almost everything is powered by computers. Computers are integral to our lives, from the smallest electronic devices to the largest supercomputers. And while there are many types of computers, they all share one thing in common: they're powered by the C programming language.\n\nC is a versatile language that can create all sorts of applications. It's used to write the operating system for many of the world's most popular computers and the software that runs on them. It's also used to create the websites and apps we use daily.\n\nBut C isn't just used for computers, it's also used to control the devices that we use in our everyday lives, from cell phones to microwaves. It's estimated that over 90% of the world's electronic devices are powered by C.\n\nSo next time you're using your computer, or even just flipping a switch, remember that you're using the power of C.\n\nReason Behind Popularity of C\n\nFor various types of tasks, there are many programming languages that allow developers to be more productive than with C. Higher-level languages have significantly larger built-in libraries that make working with JSON, XML, UI, web pages, client requests, database connections, media bias, and other things much easier.\n\nRegardless, there are many grounds to anticipate that C programming will continue to be popular for a long time.\n\nPortability and Efficiency\n\nC is an assembly language that may be used anywhere. It's as near to the machine as possible while being virtually compatible with existing processor designs. AndÂ practically every technology, there is at least one C compiler. Nowadays, because new compilers generate highly optimized binaries, improving their output using hand-written assembly is difficult.\n\nMemory Manipulation\n\nC's ability to access arbitrary memory addresses and perform pointer arithmetic is a key feature that makes it ideal for system programming (operating systems and embedded systems).\n\nComputer systems and microcontrollers map their peripherals and I/O pins into memory locations at the hardware/software boundary. To communicate with the outside world, system applications must read and write to those particular memory regions. As a result, the ability of C to manipulate independent memory addresses is critical for system programming.\n\nResources Are Used in a Definite Way\n\nGarbage collection, or even dynamic allocation for certain embedded systems, is a common language feature that system programming cannot rely on. Embedded apps have a certain amount of time and memory. They're frequently used in real-time systems in which a non-deterministic garbage collector call isn't an option. If dynamic allocation is not possible due to a paucity of memory, it is critical to have additional memory management mechanisms in place, such as the ability to place data in custom addresses using C pointers. Languages that rely significantly on dynamic allocation and trash collection would be unsuitable for resource-constrained environments.\n\nWhy Learn C Language?\n\nThere are a plethora of programming languages to choose from, ranging from the incredibly high level (such as Visual Basic) to the low level power of assembly, and a wide range of specialized possibilities in between (Perl, Ruby, and Python are good choices for many tasks). Java has also become a popular programming language for certain tasks, in part due to its extensive API and in part due to the virtual machine's security features.\n\nNonetheless, there are some compelling reasons to master C programming. First, it's been used by programmers for 30 years, and there is a wealth of source code. This means there's a lot to learn and a lot to put into practice. Furthermore, many of the language's problems have been clarified and it's well-understood among programmers, and there are numerous tutorials accessible.\n\nC has become something of a programming universal language as a result of its antiquity and employment as the language of system programming for Unix. C is a fantastic language for describing common programming concepts in a form that most people can understand. Furthermore, many of the principles used in C, such as argc and argv for command line parameters, loop constructions, and variable types, will appear in many other languages we learn, allowing us to communicate with others even if they don't know C in a way that is understandable to both of us.\n\nTo add on to that, C is in close proximity to the machine. When you're dealing with pointers, bytes, and individual bits, optimization techniques become a lot more intuitive. Understanding exactly how things work below the hood is also useful; it helps a lot when something you're attempting to perform in a higher-level language seems to take a long time or doesn't function at all. You also have a better understanding of advanced issues, such as how connectivity works. It will be a little bit easier with a higher-level programming language, but it will be more difficult to comprehend what's going on, and when things stop working, it's much preferable to know exactly what's going on so you can repair it.\n\nC has 32 keywords, a variety of data types, and a set of system utilizing functions that make programming simple.\n\nAnother property of 'C' programming is its ability to self-extend. Various functions from a library are included in a 'C' programme. We have the option of adding our own features and functions to the library. In our application, we can access and use these functions whenever we want. This capability makes working with sophisticated code much easier.\n\nThere are a number of compilers on the market that may be used to run programmes written in this language.\n\nHow C Programming Language Works?\n\nC is a compiled programming language. This mean that we'll have to convert our source files (human-readable text files) into object files (machine-readable text files forÂ microcontrollers, computers, and laptops).\n\nEditing\n\nWriting/editing source code is the initial stage in constructing an application in C. The source code is a text file that contains all of the instructions that must be executed by the machine (understandable by humans).\n\nWe can use either a plain text editor (like Notepad) or the IDE's built-in editor. The source code must follow the syntax of the C programming language. After the source file is complete, save it as a *.c file.\n\nWe'll need a compiler to compile our source code. We'll need to install a C compiler on our PC and run it manually from the command prompt if we utilize a simple text editor for our source code. An easier method is to utilize an IDE (which should have a compiler) and simply press a menu button to start it.\n\nA preliminary processing phase of the source file is included in the compilation task. A preprocessor is called by the compiler to perform the preprocessing. The preprocessor searches the source code for lines that begin with the # (hash) character.Â\n\nIncluding functions declared externally from our source code is one of the compiler's directives. The preprocessor removes all compiler directives from the original code, but it keeps track of which extra files are required later in the process. A temporary file will be created at the end of the preprocessing, which will be hidden from the user.\n\nThe compiler starts after the preparation is finished. Our source file is converted into an object file by the compiler. The object file, also known as machine code, can be interpreted by the computer's or microcontroller's Central Processing Unit.\n\nThe object file is complete, however, some undefined references are missing. These undefined references are code fragments that must be fetched from a separate location. The printf() function is the undefined reference in our scenario. We know where to acquire the code for this function because the compiler directive (#includestdio.h>) mentioned it.\n\nstdio.h is a header file (extension *.h) that contains the declaration of our printf() function, among other things. We describe where to get the definition of the printf() function by including the header file.\n\nLinking\n\nAt this point, we must gather all of the files required by our application. For the external functions, we'll need the object files as well as the static library files. The external functions utilized in our source file are defined in the static library files (*.lib). The machine code for the printf() function will be stored in the static library file in our scenario.\n\nA linker is the one who does the linking. It will examine all of the object files for undefined references and replace them with the machine code from the library files. We'll have an executable file (*.exe for Windows applications, *.hex for microcontrollers) at the end of the linking procedure.\n\nLoading\n\nThe programme file must then be loaded into the computer's memory before it can be executed. A loader is in charge of this. The loader is usually included in the executable file by the linker. When we launch the executable, it activates the loader, which loads the programme into memory and starts the operation.\n\nFuture of C Programming Language\n\nThere is no doubt that the C programming language is here to stay, and it has been around for decades and is still widely used in various applications. While other languages have come and gone, C has remained a popular choice for many developers.\n\nOne reason for C's continued popularity is its versatility, and it can be used for a wide range of tasks, from low-level system programming to high-level application development. C is a relatively easy language to learn, making it a good choice for beginners.\n\nDespite its popularity, there is no guarantee that C will be around forever. Languages come and go, and new technologies always have the potential to replace existing ones. However, C will probably remain a popular language for many years.\n\nCareer Path in C Programming\n\nC programming is a versatile language used for various applications. As a result, no specific career path is associated with C programming.Â\n\nHowever, many C programming careers involve software engineering because C programming is often used for developing system software, applications, and drivers.Â\n\nAnd C programming also can be used for creating embedded systems and firmware.Â\n\nTherefore, careers that involve working with C programming can be found in various industries, from software development to hardware engineering. So, with skill and experience in hand, you cannot limit what you can achieve!\n\nHow to Learn C Programming?\n\nIf you want to learn C programming, there are a few things you should keep in mind.Â\n\nFirst, finding a good resource to teach you the language basics is essential. Once you have a solid foundation, you can start practicing by writing small programs.\n\nTaking part in online forums or communities dedicated to C programming is also helpful, as you can learn from others struggling with the language.Â\n\nFinally, don't be afraid to ask for help when you get stuck; many people will help beginners to learn C programming.\n\nChoose The Right Software Development Program\n\nThis table compares various courses offered by Simplilearn, based on several key features and details.
