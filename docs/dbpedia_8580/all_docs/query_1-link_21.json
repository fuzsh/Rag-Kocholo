While sociological studies argue that Gulf states have defined a national narrative centered on a purely Arab-Islamic identity excluding the Persian, African and South Asian heritage, the way in which cultural productions of the region address the citizen vs. non-citizen divide, the local vs. foreign hierarchy and implicitly question the construction of identity and the position of foreigners in the region is more nuanced. National identity and otherness are more perceived as a continuum than air-tight categories. These “mixed signals” sent by Gulf region cultural productions are analyzed here through their portrayal of the historical relationships between the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent and the way language reflects porosity.

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2My will to work on this instantly identifiable and common figure stemmed from a dissatisfaction with what I perceive as a relative blind spot in the current cultural anthropology of the region: the way the noncitizen subaltern other is portrayed in Gulf cultural productions, and more precisely, the Hindī male or female.\n\n3 Potter 2014, p. 8.\n\n“The result of state-sponsored history, as presented in school textbooks and tourism brochures, as well as museum exhibits, is a skewed portrayal of the pre-oil Gulf, with a loss of the diversity and ambiguity that characterized it. Thus the Bedouin heritage is emphasized to the exclusion of other elements. For example, in the Dubai Museum, mannequins depicting shopkeepers in the suq are clearly Arab, whereas we know from eyewitnesses that in the 1950s in Dubai and Abu Dhabi they were mainly Indians and Persians. Museum exhibits and displays in most Gulf cities feature images of distinctly non-African individuals performing tasks that historically were performed by Africans.”\n\n4In a later stage, Neha Vora and Natalie Koch challenged the kafāla/ethnocracy angle in the study of Gulf societies and advocated the need to:\n\n4 Vora & Koch 2015, pp. 540-552.\n\n“move beyond the rigidity of exclusion-centred narratives about the Gulf and instead consider the various ways that Gulf nationalisms themselves hail the non-citizen presences, and how non-citizens participate in discourses and practices of nationalism […] in ways that cannot be reduced to nationality, class, race or religion.”\n\n9I will argue that cultural productions from the Gulf region do not necessarily conceive national identity and otherness as air-tight categories but as a continuum: there can be middle terms between the self and the other in cultural productions. I must, however, insist that the corpora analyzed here are all fictitious representations of reality. This paper does not aim at presenting a mitigated vision of the experience of subalternity lived on a daily basis by South Asians of various social backgrounds in the Gulf region. Rather, it aims at pinpointing the contradictions and ambiguities between the way South Asians are perceived and represented, and the conscience that Arab citizens of the Gulf region have of South Asians’ actual minoritized position in Gulf societies. Representation and reality entertain complex relationships, the study of which can benefit cultural anthropology. This article argues that the Hindī, an emic category lumping together Indians, Pakistani, Bengalis and Sri Lankans, non-Muslims as well as Muslims, is an example of “close otherness” in Gulf fiction representation, illustrating a median stance between the polar point of alienness and that of kindred.\n\n13 ibid. p. 84.\n\n“Arab or not, Persian or not, a lingering truth defines our transnational Arab Gulf community: neither on this shore nor on the other fronting shore are we completely indigenous. We are in fact the ‘Gulf’, simultaneously separating the two shores and linking them through invisible threads of history and culture.”\n\n13The messages and signs conveyed by cultural productions are certainly mixed and ambiguous: the South Asian character in films, TV dramas and internet memes can be an amusing harmless fellow or a menacing ill-tempered bachelor spitting out abuse in his faulty pidgin Arabic, flaunting his kafīl’s threats of canceling his visa, or dismissing complaints and objections with a harsh ma fi gerger ziyāda (“No need for chit chat”). But this threatening foreigner is also paradoxically recognized as “one of us,” from local pioneer television dramas to recent Ramadan fiction and internet skits.\n\n14These “mixed signals” sent by the Gulf region’s cultural productions will be analyzed through three lenses: the first part of this paper will examine how historical relationships between the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent are pictured in cultural productions, between fears of a “great replacement” expressed ever since the mid-twentieth century, and a will to reconnect with the past that may include the desire to honor a debt vis-à-vis Indian culture and paying a tribute to a beloved legacy through the topos of “Gulfic indophilia.” The second part of this paper will deal with language. It will first examine the use of “survival Hindi/Urdu,” expected to be mastered by Gulf nationals in fiction, and its significance as a common feature of the Khaleeji identity. It will subsequently analyze the ambiguous habit in Gulf fiction of using a type of pidgin Arabic attributed to South Asian speakers. Whereas such a pidgin exists and is documented by sociolinguists, it becomes a convenient fictitious tool to characterize South Asians, far exceeding its natural domains of use. The last section of this paper will address the tightrope walked by many productions, between the need felt by contemporary authors to “discipline the Khaleeji self” and root out racism and abuse toward South Asians, and the temptation of “disciplining the other” so as to render him suitable for the type of modernity Gulf states and societies aspire to.\n\n15A note on this paper’s methodology is required at this point: unlike Nadeen Dakkak’s cautious choice of dealing with a particular and coherent type of cultural production, i.e., comedic video skits on the internet, the documents examined here pertain to extremely different genres, from literature and nabaṭī poetry to TV serials, cartoons, songs and internet comedy. This drift netting technique is not intended to be exhaustive, and it has both its perks and disadvantages: a large array of artistic and/or commercial expressions can be observed and allowed to present a nuanced and at times contradictory survey of representations, for reality is contradictory and paradoxical. But these productions do not have comparable legitimacies, nor the same distribution in the cultural and media spheres, nor the same relationship with the state; some can be more or less independent, or can be directly or indirectly sponsored by the state, and therefore espouse or partly mirror its long-term goals in terms of identity building.\n\n1. Reconnecting with the past: the debt and the legacy\n\nToday, though lots of pushy guys\n\nThe sale of fish monopolize\n\nIndian types, not Arab men\n\nSalim, Sayf won’t come again\n\nMuslim’s gone, his family too\n\n‘Ubayd, Rashoud, The whole damn crew\n\nI no more see a friendly soul\n\nWho’ll sell me fish that’s fresh and whole\n\nBangladeshis everywhere\n\nI’m furious, I want to swear.\n\n“Hindi/Urdu and, to a lesser extent, Punjabi and some South Indian languages have always been widely understood by sections of the population in all the Gulf States. Trade links with India have been strong for centuries if not millennia, and for a hundred years, until 1947, the whole area was governed by British India from Bombay. The doctors, nurses, minor civil servants, engineers, and teachers who came to the area from India to build its infrastructure also incidentally made Indian languages more widely understood. Gulf Arabs working in certain trades, such as jewelry making, have long been familiar with these languages because India is a main source of gold and precious gems, and many local businesses employed Indian craftsmen. Before the advent of modern education in the Gulf, it was normal for the comfortably well off to send their children to India to be educated, and until the 1970s, many Gulf residents would routinely go to India for the medical treatment until then unavailable in the Gulf […] As a consequence of these various types of long-standing contact, the Gulf Arabic dialects are permeated with Indian borrowings, especially in employment-related vocabulary and terms for domestic equipment, clothing, and cooking.”\n\n20Until today, jūtī for shoes, sīda for straight ahead, ṣālūna for stew, alū for potato, etc. are still commonly used, although some words might be generational: alū vs baṭāṭā (potato) for instance.\n\n21In order to analyze cultural productions dealing with the Indian subcontinent and with South Asian characters, I suggest that three points should be taken into account:\n\n22(a) The relationship with India that cultural productions reflect — in particular but not exclusively with a mythified version of Mumbai — needs to be distinguished from that with the South Asian worker, male or female. In other words, India as a space is one thing, al-Hunūd as a generic label is another.\n\n24On the one hand, one finds the South Indian character as an Ibn al-ḥāra/Ibn al-frīj (son of the neighborhood) character; on the other hand, the sheer number of foreign workers is constructed by some cultural productions as a direct threat to the type of identity put forward by the Grand National Narrative spun by Gulf monarchies.\n\nCelebrating the Arab Bombay\n\n29However, in the thirtieth and final episode, when all the subplots involving greedy merchants and gold smuggling are resolved, Najlāʾ ultimately marries Ḥusayn in Kuwait City, where the whole family has returned. At this stage, our girl is naturally donning the beautiful darrāʿa that she wouldn’t consider at the beginning of the story, and the qawwālī singer of her aborted wedding night in Episode 4 has been replaced with traditional ṭaggāgāt (traditional female singers of the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq) and naʿʿāshāt, i.e., women waving their long hair in front of their face in the iconic Khaleeji way.\n\n31Whereas Kuwaiti households in the show are reenacted to appear ocre and dusty and suggest deprivation, Mumbai households are colorful, luxurious palaces: Abd al-Wahhāb’s flowery interior garden even features a live peacock. Parallel to showing Mumbai as a cosmopolitan space, the show also paints it as an orientalist dream; the failed wedding party’s rites in Episode 4 might owe as much to Bollywood as to historical research on how families of Arab descent in late colonial India actually performed weddings. But beyond this interesting instance of “Oriental Orientalism,” Mumbai interiors of the 1940s also prophesize what Kuwaiti villas will look like years later, when the sons and daughters of the homeland will have learned enough abroad to aptly use the rent provided by oil to develop their country. It is remarkable that at the same time that the Kuwaiti TV drama industry celebrated the days when Gulf people found wealth and modernity in India, it also remembered when the first delegations of female students were sent to Cairo in the mid-1950s and Beirut in the mid-1960s to pursue higher education, before the foundation of Kuwait University in 1966: Dufʿat al-Qāhira (The Cairo Class, 2019) and Dufʿat Bayrūt (The Beirut Class, 2020) were huge Ramadan TV successes and appear to be settling a debt, through popular fiction, to the foreign roots of Khaleeji modernity (India, Egypt, the Levant) at a time when racism can be rampant in the region.\n\nIbn al-Frīj al-Hindī\n\n— We consider ourselves of this country\n\n— So are you!\n\n35At a later stage, the Indian warns the hero :\n\n36 Around 21’30”\n\n— We Indians have seen what these Portuguese do wherever they go. They show no mercy for young or old, and they have weapons we do not have. They will not quit the war path until they control every trade route between their country and India, and they care nothing for those in the middle. Look at their ship: can a small city like Khorfakkan stop an army like this?\n\n36Since the whole cast of the film is Emirati, including the Portuguese warriors, the fact that no South Asian actor is used for this short role is only moderately meaningful; it is arguably easier to find a South Asian supporting cast than Portuguese-speaking actors in contemporary Sharjah or Dubai, but the highly unusual points in this dialogue are (1) the implicit recognition of a Gulf identity encompassing the Indian element (a wealthy merchant, however, not a laborer) and (2) the shared destiny and the complicit understanding between peoples subjected to European imperialism or colonization that unites the two shores of the Gulf of Oman. Whether the Emir of Sharjah or the Syrian screenwriter chose to insert this short scene, it nevertheless reveals Sharjah's own specific tune in its relationship with the postcolonial West.\n\n2. From the Bollywood Fascination to Slapstick Pidgin Wala: the issue of language\n\n“The movie theater used to show many Indian and Egyptian movies, especially those with a Bedouin plot. A lot of young men were mesmerized by Indian films, and they learned Urdu by means of watching these movies. Indian actors became famous, and the youth would imitate their hairstyles and their dress. This cinema and the films they were showing contributed to educate the younger generations, to grant them access to art and culture. They understood a lot of what was happening in the Indian society or in the Egyptian society. It taught them history […] This cinema remained open until the early 1970s, when it was torn down and replaced by a new building.”\n\ntaʿālū semʿū intu same ikhwān\n\nhāzā dunyā kullu nafar lāzem fī nūʾān [nūʿān]\n\nfī nafar zēn, fī nafar mū zēn\n\nkhudū minni hāzī naṣīḥa\n\nla la la la la la la\n\n(sung imitating raga repertoire ascending and descending trill)\n\nCome here, you are like brothers\n\nin this world, there are two types of people\n\ngood guys and bad guys\n\ntake from me this advice, no no no no no...\n\n42The skit ends with the dead hero rising from his pool of blood upon hearing that market inspectors are coming to check papers. Except for the narrator, all the protagonists are illegal workers afraid to be sent back to India. Aḥmad Sharīf obviously walks a thin line between homage, mockery and cultural appropriation. Bahrainis are clearly a dominant group appropriating cultural elements from the dominated South Asian one, and the action takes place in a social milieu constructed as subaltern and servicing the locals (i.e., Arab citizens): car washers. The dominant group’s power is reaffirmed in the final twist with the Indians fleeing from the police. And yet, however ambiguous, the show is intended to be a tribute to popular Bollywood movies that this whole generation of comedians have watched in their teens. Humor and political correctness are uneasy bedfellows. On the one hand, migrants are reduced to an unruly workforce, and on the other, the culture they represent is one of the mainstays of the regional imaginary.\n\n43Fig. 6\n\nSouth Asian Pidgin Arabic as fictional convention\n\n46Originally, SAPA is thus explained by linguist Clive Holes:\n\n49 There are numerous references in the field of sociolinguistics on SAPA, among which: Smart 1990, H (...)\n\n“The presence of many immigrant laborers from the Indian subcontinent who work in an Arabic-speaking environment but know little or no Arabic has led to the formation of an Arabic pidgin in some of the Gulf States […]. This pidgin is typically used in market transactions, work environments, and other limited speech contexts […] and is remarkably uniform. Like all pidgins, it exhibits a total loss of inflectional morphology and a drastic reshaping of syntactic structures through the grammaticalization of lexemes. A non-Arabic (Hindi/Urdu) set of syntactic templates and word order seems to underlie it, with ‘frozen’ verbal, nominal, demonstrative, copular, and negative Arabic elements being slotted in.”\n\n47I might add that in spite of being indeed quite uniform, there are some nuances dictated by common adjectives or modifiers in a given region: a “very bad man” such as in the Bahraini show cited supra would be nafar marra mu kwayyes in Saudi Arabia vs. nafar wayed mu zēn in Kuwait; but this pidgin is however instantly recognizable as such in the whole Peninsular region.\n\nḤamīd : (Emirati Arabic) I am Ḥamīd Adidas\n\nNiʿmāt : (Egyptian Arabic) Are you here for medical care or tourism or business ?\n\nShalabī : (EgA) Wait, don’t tell me… Tourism for sure.\n\nḤamīd : (EmA) No I came with my uncle, we have things to do.\n\nShalabī : (EgA) Certainly treatment or commerce…\n\nḤamīd : (EmA) No, you’ve seen my uncle, he just stepped out of the hotel.\n\nShalabī : (EgA) Your uncle is the one that was with Mukhtār, right ?\n\nḤamīd : (EmA) No idea… Oh, right, Mukhtār. Where did they go ?\n\nShalabī : (EgA) I don’t know. What do you want to eat, Sir ? Hamara bas seb kaj !\n\nḤamīd : (EmA) Who’s an ass, here ? (ḥimār/hamāra)\n\nNiʿmāt: (EgA) It means we have everything here, but he’s saying it in Hindi. You know, five years ago we just came here as tourists, but thank God we succeeded and now we have this business and a home and everything…\n\nMuftāḥ : (EmA) I’ve been waiting for you for ages, where have you been since this\n\nmorning, you haven’t opened your shop!\n\nShalabī : (EgA) We were finalizing the paperwork for my wife Niʿmāt, she wants to open a salon here.\n\nMuftāḥ : Really?\n\nNiʿmāt : (EgA) Yes Mr Muftāḥ, I will open a Beauty Center [in English] here. Bhot ajahi\n\nMuftāḥ : (EmA) You’re still... [speaking Hindi to me]\n\nNiʿmāt : (EgA) Why Sir, I speak Hindi fluently, look : “ham temsé piyar kertahé”\n\nMuftāḥ : (EmA) Shalabī, hold your wife, what’s that she’s telling me “piyar kertahé”?\n\nShalabī : [EgA) Woman, this is something you tell to no one but me ! That’s sweet talk, pay attention!\n\nNiʿmāt : (EgA) I just wanted to show him my talents…\n\n[ہم تم سے پیار کرتا ہے] (instead of more correct form [میں تم سے پیار کرتا ہوں].\n\n53It seems that Ṭalāl Maḥmūd’s bet on the audience’s proficiency in Hindi worked: the playwright confirmed to me that the Emirati audience did understand those basic sentences, and that his point was to use common idioms that every Khaleeji (supposedly) knows. The audience, he added, particularly laughed at Egyptians speaking Hindi/Urdu. There might be a generational factor to take into account, though; one Emirati informant reported to me a conversation she had with her grandmother, when she marveled at the fact she could speak “Indian”: titkallimūn ingilīzī, naḥin nitkallim hindī, said the old lady (You guys speak English, we speak Hindi).\n\n“Arabic Foreigner Talk is further analysed [here] from the perspective of the linguistic strategies deployed by Arabs to exert power over the migrants: self-facilitating, excluding, and mocking strategies. However, from a tool of communication and/or exclusion, the pidgin is also becoming one of transgression used by both Arabs and the migrants to oppose their respective hegemonic cultures – that of the masters for the migrants, that of religion for the Arabs”\n\n3. Disciplining Oneself / Disciplining the Other\n\n57Many Gulf region pop culture productions are acutely aware of the foreign workforce’s harsh living conditions, and of a xenophobic trend in society, and aim at unrooting it, using either humor or drama.\n\nSatirizing xenophobia\n\n— [to his guest] Intellectual ! Reactionary ! Chauvinist [shūfīnī] !\n\n— What’s wrong with me [shū fīnī]?\n\n— Clean this, Indian guy [bū hannūd]. I’m better than you, look at me. I came here with my money, I am Saudi, do you wanna pick a fight you Yemeni?\n\n— Indian, Indian…\n\n— You Indian. Where Residence permit you [in SAPA]?\n\n— You born after 9 month me born 9 month, you Saudi me Pakistani, no problem. You are rude\n\n— Dirty Indian\n\n— We are sorry that you cannot stay with us any longer...\n\n— What happened to you? When you arrived here, you were so strong!\n\n61Significantly, Arwā and Laṭīfa will replace Arjūn with a robot. I would suggest that Arjūn’s oversized figure also alludes allegorically both to India’s size as a nation and to the South Asian workforce in the region, and the way Gulf societies manage through the kafāla system, to rein it in and absorb its menace.\n\nكلو نفرات لازم يسمع كلام حقنا / انا شيل كل شي فوق\n\nنفر سعودي زيادة عباطة / فكر انا خوف\n\nكل حاجة انت سوي انا شوف / أنا مافي خوف من كفيل\n\nمين سوي كل حاجة في سعودية / مين سوي بنا تحتية\n\nمين شغل 100 100 / مين سوي كباري مين سوي مجاري؟\n\nمين شيل زُبالة ؟ / مين شغل بِقالة ؟\n\nكلو سعودي ناسي / مين شغل تكاسي؟\n\nأنا مافي خوف كفيل\n\nEverybody he need listen us / me bring everything up\n\nSaudi man very stupid / Think me afraid?\n\nEverything you doing me see / Me not afraid kafeel\n\nWho do everything in Saudi? / Who do infrastructure?\n\nWho work perfect / Who do bridge, who do sewage?\n\nWho carry garbage?

But to what extent is satire effective? The question remains open, when a quick reading of YouTube comments by viewers merely reveals a series of laughing emojis...\n\n— In good Arabic, if you keep on going like that, there will not remain in this frīj but Raju, Babu and Shankar.\n\nBringing the lights of female empowerment\n\n69In attorney Ḥasan’s (Manṣūr al-Fīlī) household, Fāṭima, his wife, tries to convince the Indian family of their beloved cook, Asha, to let her take a culinary course in Dubai, but with little success: they don’t seem convinced by the virtues of female autonomy that she advocates for. Ultimately, Asha’s brother and father will trespass on Ḥasan’s villa, where Asha sought refuge, with the intent of killing her. Fāṭima feels threatened and shoots them. Arrested and trialed (on the very next day, as unlikely as it may seem), the prosecutor rejects her claim of self-defense and accuses her of having such a strong feeling of entitlement that she would kill those people who did not share her views on what her employee should do with her life. Her attorney/husband defends her by arguing, in his closing statement, that Fāṭima has always considered the maid as her own daughter and that females are raised in this household to take their own decisions, whether regarding career or marriage. The Arab patriarch, in this scene, clearly renounces and disclaims patriarchy itself.\n\n70Parallel to the “White Savior” discourse so common in Western cinema, we find here an instance of “Emirati Savior” syndrome. Emirati society portrays itself as helping its former reference of civilization, worldliness and openness, India, now pictured as less advanced in this topical marker of progress that is women’s empowerment. This empowerment is, however, linked to class: whereas Ḥasan’s daughter Faraḥ, played by Fāṭima al-Ṭā’ī, is a successful lawyer who studied in the USA and opens her own practice against her father’s initial advice, the housemaid in this indophiliac family will simply take cooking lessons in Dubai. Class relationships remain unquestioned.\n\nSamīra al-Wahībī as a Khaleeji-Indian bridge\n\n73“My relationship with Hindi is related to the fact that my mother is Indian. My brothers and I are very proud of her, and she was the one who agreed or refused to let me impersonate Indian characters on screen. When I embodied Carona in [the Kuwaiti soap] Iqbāl yawma aqbalat, it was after her agreement, although all my brothers were against it. My mother, may her soul rest in peace, was a cultured woman. She told me: ‘Your brothers are not artists; they cannot understand this role. I know that my daughter can do what no other can.’”\n\nحصة: قوة عينج، قليلة الحيا\n\nإقبال : حصة! انتي شلون تمدين ايدينج عليها؟ أحنا من أُمّتىَ كان الطق اسلوبنا؟\n\nبنت إقبال: [ساخرة] إي صح…\n\nإقبال : ما أعتقد إن كَرونا تستاهل الطق. ما وصلت مرحلة من الوقاحة إن احنا نمدّ إيدينّا عليها\n\nحصة: شنو ما تستاهل؟ لا تشيخينها علينا ترى اقصاها خدامة\n\nإقبال: بسكم عنصرية! بسكم عنصرية خلاص! ما اختارت هذي المره اتّغرب ولا انتو تعبتوا علشان تلقون اللي يخدمكم؟ بعدين هذي أرزاق قسمها رب العالمين علينّا\n\nحصة: يمه هذي خدّامة يعني ياية هني علشان راحتنا ! رديها ديرتها وانا اييبلج الف وحده احسن منها.\n\nإقبال: سكتَي ! باچر تشوفين عيالچ ينذلّون عشان لقمة عيشهم سكتَي أحسن لچ! بعدين هذي أحسن منكم مليون مرة، أحسن منكم بأخلاقها…\n\nḤiṣṣa: How insolent!

Don’t make her feel superior to us, she can’t rise up to being more than a mere servant\n\nIqbal: Enough racism, she hasn’t chosen to emigrate, and did you ever work so that you would get someone to serve you?

Tomorrow you’ll see your own children forced to humiliate themselves for bread, just shut up! She’s worth a million of you, she has true morals!\n\n76The main character of this fiction is the wannabe writer Asmā’, who is estranged from her family and reconnects with the other black sheep of her clan, her half-brother Khālid. His mother Madhuri, although having become a Kuwaiti national, still (improbably) speaks heavily accented pidgin Arabic. She embarrasses her son when she insists on wearing a sari in the street under her ʿabāya, or at the ‘iyāda (medical center) where she picks a fight when she is (understandably) mistaken for a foreign resident by a cocky Egyptian doctor. The latter addresses her in pidgin Arabic and wants her to follow an administrative procedure that citizens are exempted from. She then insists she is a Kuwaiti, in her strong foreign accent.\n\n77Although Asmā’, a misfit, welcomes Khālid’s mother with open arms and encourages her half-brother to embrace his dual heritage, she is brought to breaking point when Umm Khālid/Madhuri reveals to her that she was tortured by her husband, Asmā’s father, and that she was forbidden to be seen with him. Asmāʾ calls Madhuri a liar and refuses to believe that her own father was responsible for such barbaric mistreatment. When Madhuri asks her stepdaughter to say her name, Asmāʾ can only mutter “Umm Khālid”, refusing to utter the Indian name. When forced to pronounce “Madhuri” and asked what it means (pretty girl), Asmāʾ resorts to misplaced irony and retorts: “Maybe this name can be found in Mukhtār al-Ṣiḥāḥ or al-Muʿjam al-Wasīṭ” — an English equivalent of answering “Perhaps this name is found in Merriam-Webster’s or in the Concise Oxford?”. But Madhuri forces Asmāʾ to see by herself the remaining traces of burns she endured at the hands of the revered paternal figure. All will be pardoned at the end of the musalsal when, in the final episode, Khālid marries a Kuwaiti girl who is not ashamed of the boy’s dual descent, and Madhuri appears in a traditional Indian costume at her son’s wedding. Mother India and her Kuwaiti son are therefore reconciled beyond former grievances when everyone embraces their multiple origins. The show boldly suggests that this might be a possible template for contemporary Gulf societies.\n\n“My father was an orphan who worked in maritime trade between Oman and India. It was at that time a source of pride, my father told me, for a man to marry an Indian. My father went to the local mosque, and the imam mentioned that in this district of Hyderabad, all inhabitants were Indians of Yemenite descent, originally from Hadramawt. He found him a girl aged fourteen, and they got married. My mother’s name is ʿAlyāʾ al-Sayyid ʿAbdallāh Bāḥamīd al-Ḥaḍramī. She had Indian nationality and mixed with girls of all religions and origins, Christians and Hindus, but at home they kept Arab habits […] When we had guests, we all spoke Arabic, but when we were alone, I called her “Baji.” This word means “elder sister” and this is what we would hear on vacation in India when her siblings referred to her. […] I was wary of playing the part of an Indian, would I be able to express myself as easily as in Arabic? And there was the criticism, it went as far as people telling me ‘Gabīlish! ʿēb!’ [Think of your tribe! Shame on you!], you are Omani, how can you play the part of a maid?’ But at the end of the day, we’re all humans.”\n\n79An Omani actress whose mother was an Indian of supposedly Arab origin has thus become Khaleeji drama’s favorite “Indian face” and a mouthpiece for positive inclusion of South Asians, although she insists in her own narrative on her Ḥaḍramī and tribal descent. Al-Wahībī’s career and roles interrogate Arabness and identity in the region, and deconstruct the mythical ethnic purity of modern nation-states.\n\nConclusion\n\n80Through comedy as well as melodrama, the Gulf region’s particular relationship with India and with South Asians is constantly replayed and reexamined. It is only one in a nexus of identitarian interrogations linked to class, race, identity and ethnicity. But what makes it particular, in comparison with Africa and Iran – two other sources of cultural, commercial and ethnic inputs – is that the Indian subcontinent has a dual image and referentiality for the Arabian Peninsula. On the one hand, India (understood as encompassing all the regions of the British Raj and not simply the post-1947 nation-state) is the old commercial partner and a revered cultural reference, both of refined taste, sublime architecture, beloved foods and pop culture entertainment; it is also the place where one used to be cured before hospitals were built in the Gulf, then it was the country that doctors came from; it is the land of wonders and riches, with the local Muslim community being an efficient interface between Arabness and Indianness; it is the nation of skilled engineers who participated in the building of the new nations on this side of the Arabian Sea. This prestigious aspect of the subcontinent explains the constant homage that Gulf cultural productions pay to this component of the region’s identity. Language is also a binding element: in addition to Indian languages’ influence on local dialects, if South Asian Pidgin Arabic can rightly be analyzed as a tool of domination and sometimes mockery, it is also a common denominator of the Arabian Peninsula’s relationship with Arabic and a bridge between linguistic communities.\n\n81But on the other hand, the subcontinent is the region from which the cheap labor that populates the Peninsula originates, and even forms the main bulk of the population in its eastern coastal states. Khaleeji cultural productions therefore balance between a call to discipline the self by recognizing social and cultural debt, embracing diversity and recusing racism, and between the need to discipline this close other, perpetuating the image of the “dangerous classes” and unruly males that constitute a danger for the local helpless females and for the modern states’ newly constructed Arab identity. The “Khaleeji man’s burden” or rather “Khaleeji woman’s burden” is now the enlightenment of individuals coming from societies that some cultural productions (more or less sponsored by the state) paint as overly patriarchal and traditional, by showing the “correct” way of reconciling universal values of female empowerment with local identity and Islamic values. But one is left to wonder to what extent the occasional representation of the working-class Other as backward and reluctant to embrace the shining promises of globalized post-modernity is not a metaphor for the dark part of the Khaleeji self.\n\nCoda\n\n83Finally, the family's Pakistani driver, for whom Sameer has tried to intercede in order to have his real name restored and his passport given to him (he bears the same name as the family’s son's, and therefore had to be renamed), accepts his condition as a subordinate without flinching, and his character remains without consistency nor personality. He and Sameer do not partake in the same universe and literally have nothing to say to each other: class precedes race. This is why a well-educated and promising British-Pakistani husband is certainly a better choice than a wife-beater, admits the mother at the end of the concluding episode. Incidentally, the scriptwriter explains that she had initially envisaged Razān’s fiancé as a white Englishman, before changing her mind to make the character a British-Pakistani, believing that this would be less offensive to the audience. The character's religion is obviously the first reason: Sameer is a Muslim. We don't see him practicing at all during the show, though. But after a century of Wahhabi proselytizing to the Muslim world and explaining that Islam is not simply a matter of belonging to a community, but an orthopraxy, Saudi cultural productions (or at least those recent ones that promote a liberal discourse) now take the opposite stand: it is here suggested that in order to be integrated in Saudi society, all that is needed is to wear the Muslim label from birth. But yet another reason may be suggested for the (relatively) greater acceptability of this union: the liminality of the hindī character, half insider and half outsider."
