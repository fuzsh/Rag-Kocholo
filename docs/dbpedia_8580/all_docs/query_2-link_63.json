        "text": "SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME (SSI) LIVING ARRANGEMENTS\n\nWHY IS MY LIVING ARRANGEMENT IMPORTANT?\n\nYour living arrangement is another factor used to determine how much Supplemental Security Income (SSI) you can get.\n\nThis means your SSI benefits may vary depending on where you live:\n\nin your own place such as a house, apartment, or mobile home; or\n\nin someone else's household; or\n\nin a group care or board and care facility; or\n\nin an institution such as a hospital or a nursing home.\n\nWe may reduce your SSI benefits because of your living arrangements when you:\n\nLive in another person's house, apartment, or mobile home, and you pay less than your fair share of your food or housing costs.\n\nLive in your own house, apartment, or mobile home, and someone else pays for all or part of your food, rent, mortgage, or other things like electricity and heating fuel.\n\nAre in a hospital or nursing home for the whole month and Medicaid pays for over one-half of the cost of your care.\n\nAre a minor child in a hospital or nursing home for the whole month and private insurance and/or Medicaid together pay over one-half of the cost of your care.\n\nAre in a public or private medical treatment facility and Medicaid is paying for more than half of the cost of your care. If you are in the facility for the whole month, your SSI benefit is limited to $30 (plus any supplementary State payment). We may lower the benefit if you have other income.\n\nWHAT IF YOU ARE HOMELESS?\n\nWe figure your benefit amount the same as we do for a person who lives in their own house, apartment, or mobile home.\n\nCAN YOU RECEIVE SSI BENEFITS WHILE LIVING IN A PUBLIC SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS?\n\nYes. You can receive up to the maximum SSI benefit payable in your State while living in a public shelter for up to 6 months out of any 9 month period.\n\nWHERE WILL YOU GET YOUR SSI BENEFITS IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS?\n\nYou don't need an address to get SSI benefits. We will make arrangements to pay you.\n\nWHAT IS IN-KIND SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE?\n\nIn-kind support and maintenance is food, shelter, or both that somebody else provides for you. We count in-kind support and maintenance as income when we figure the amount of your SSI. For example, if someone helps pay for your rent, mortgage, food, or utilities, we reduce the amount of your SSI. Receiving in-kind support and maintenance can reduce your monthly SSI payments as much as $334.33, depending on the value of the help you receive.\n\nWe do not count in-kind support and maintenance if you:\n\nlive alone and pay for your own food and shelter;\n\nlive only with your spouse and minor children and nobody outside the household pays for your food and shelter; or\n\nlive with other people and pay your share of the food and shelter expenses.\n\nHOW DOES MY LIVING ARRANGEMENT AFFECT MY SSI BENEFIT AMOUNT?\n\nYour living arrangement is where you live, if you live alone or with someone else, or if you live in an institution, such as a nursing home. Your living arrangement also depends on who pays for your food and shelter. Whether you live alone or with someone else, we need to know who pays for your food, shelter, and utilities. Here are some examples of common living arrangement situations.\n\nEXAMPLE A: If you live alone in an apartment\n\nSuppose you live alone and your only income is SSI. Your sibling pays your rent of $800. We count this payment as in-kind support and maintenance. Although the rent is $800, we limit how much of the $800 we count by using a presumed maximum value (PMV) rule. The PMV is equal to 1/3 of the Federal benefit rate plus $20. Here are the steps we use to figure the SSI benefit amount:\n\n1. The SSI Federal Benefit Rate is $943.00.\n\n2. One-third of the SSI Federal Benefit Rate of $943.00 is $314.33.\n\n3. $314.33 (1/3 of the Federal Benefit Rate)\n\n+$20.00 (from the PMV rule)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=$334.33 (the PMV of in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n4. $334.33 (the PMV of in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n-20.00 (general income exclusion)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $314.33 (the amount of the reduction due to in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n5. $943.00 (Federal Benefit Rate)\n\n-$314.33 (reduction due to in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $628.67 (your SSI benefit amount)\n\nEXAMPLE B: If you live alone in a home that you own\n\nSuppose you live alone in a home that you own and your only income is SSI. Your adult child pays your electric bill of $100, your phone bill of $50 per month, and your cable television bill of $75 per month. We do not count the payment of the phone bill or the cable television bill as in-kind support and maintenance so these payments do not affect your SSI benefits. However, we count payment of the $100 electric bill as in-kind support and maintenance. Because SSI is your only income, we apply the $20 general exclusion to the $100 electric bill payment. This leaves $80 as countable in-kind support and maintenance. We determine your SSI benefit amount as follows:\n\n$943.00 (the SSI Federal Benefit Rate)\n\n$100.00 (in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n-$20.00 (general exclusion)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $80.00 (the reduction due to in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n$943.00 (SSI Federal Benefit Rate)\n\n-$80.00 (the reduction due to in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $863.00 (your SSI benefit amount)\n\nEXAMPLE C: If you live in another personâ€™s household and share expenses.\n\nSuppose you live with your sibling, and 2 other adults in a home that your sibling is buying and your only income is SSI. There are 4 people in the household. The mortgage payment is $700. The average monthly bills are $200 for electricity, $100 for water and sewer, and $600 for food. The total monthly expenses are $1600. Because there are 4 people in the household, your share of the expenses is $400 per month.\n\nIf you pay your full share of $400 for the household expenses there would be no reduction of your benefit and you would get the full $943 in your SSI check.\n\nIf you pay less than $400, then you would be receiving in-kind support and maintenance. We would apply the one-third reduction rule and the $943 would be reduced by $314.33, so your SSI payment would be $628.67.\n\nEXAMPLE D: If you live in a house rent-free\n\nSuppose you live in a house owned by your sibling who allows you to live there rent-free. You receive $300 per month in Social Security benefits. You pay all the utilities and buy all the food. We determine that the house would rent for $900 per month if your sibling rented it on the open market. The rent-free house is counted as in-kind support and maintenance. Although the value of the rent-free house is $900 per month, we count $324.66 as in-kind support and maintenance. We would determine your SSI benefit as follows:\n\n$943.00 (SSI Federal benefit rate)\n\n$300.00 (Social Security benefits)\n\n- $20.00 (general exclusion)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $280.00 (countable Social Security benefits)\n\n$943.00 (SSI Federal benefit rate)\n\n-$280.00 (countable Social Security benefits)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $663.00 (sub-total)\n\n$663.00 (sub-total)\n\n-$334.33 (the reduction due to in-kind support and maintenance)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n= $328.67 (your SSI benefit amount)\n\nBack Top Next"
