        "text": "Easily contribute a wide range of assets\n\nGiving non-cash assets is often more tax-advantageous than giving via cash or credit cards, but it can be difficult for many charities to accept these charitable contributions. Contributing assets other than cash is simple with a Giving Account. In some cases, it’s possible to transfer stock directly from your brokerage account with the click of a button. See what you can donate.\n\nAssets generally accepted include:\n\nRestricted stock\n\nPublicly traded securities or mutual fund shares\n\nPrivate equity and hedge fund interests\n\nCertain complex assets, such as privately held C corp and S corp shares\n\nCash equivalents, such as checks, wire transfers, or cash positions from a brokerage account\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies\n\nInvest your donation for tax-free growth\n\nOnce you have funded your donor-advised fund, you may recommend an investment strategy for your account—potentially growing your account and providing you with more dollars to grant to charity. Many sponsoring organizations also have programs allowing you to nominate your financial advisor to manage the investment of your charitable funds.\n\nHow much does a donor-advised fund cost?\n\nThe Fidelity Charitable Giving Account has no minimum initial contribution requirement and one of the lowest annual fees of any donor-advised fund. Total fees for a Giving Account typically amount to about 1% of the balance. That's generally less than the operating costs associated with a private foundation or the fees for donating with a credit card.\n\nMaximize the potential tax benefits\n\nAs soon as you make a charitable contribution, you are eligible for an immediate tax deduction, just as you would be by donating to another public charity, like your local homeless shelter or food pantry. But some donations could make you eligible for additional benefits.\n\nCash donationsIf you donate cash, via check or wire transfer, you're generally eligible for an income tax deduction of up to 60% of your adjusted gross income.\n\nDonations of long-term appreciated assetsDonating long-term appreciated securities directly to charity—instead of liquidating the asset and donating the proceeds—can help maximize both your tax benefit and the overall amount you have to grant to charity. These donations provide two tax benefits:\n\nBecome eligible for an income tax deduction of the full fair-market value of the asset, up to 30% of your adjusted gross income\n\nPotentially eliminate and maximize capital gains tax on long-term appreciated assets, as long as they’ve been held for more than a year\n\nSimplify recordkeeping and organization\n\nWith a donor-advised fund, you don’t have to keep track of every gift acknowledgment from every charity you support—just the receipts from your DAF contributions. When you’re ready to support your favorite charity, you can simply log in to your account and recommend a grant to any IRS-qualified public charity.\n\nWith a donor-advised fund, you generally can:\n\nSupport IRS-qualified public charities with grant recommendations from the donor-advised fund. The public charity sponsoring your account will conduct due diligence to ensure the funds granted go to an IRS-qualified public charity and are used for charitable purposes.\n\nChoose whether to recommend anonymous grants to charities or to provide grant acknowledgment contact information with your grant recommendations. While donors choose to provide information about themselves on more than 90% of grants recommended through Fidelity Charitable, donor-advised funds offer the option of anonymous granting for those who wish to recommend grants privately.\n\nSpecify a specific use, campaign, or purpose for your grant recommendation. While you cannot fulfill legally binding pledges with a donor-advised fund, you can attach a special purpose to your grants, which the sponsoring organization will relay to the charity. Similarly, you may make grant recommendations “in honor of” or “in memory of” a loved one.\n\nWith a donor-advised fund, you generally cannot:\n\nSupport organizations other than IRS-qualified, 501(c)(3) organizations, such as political groups or crowdfunding campaigns. Private foundations are also ineligible to receive donor-advised fund grants.\n\nRecommend grants that may provide a personal benefit—such as school tuition for a grandchild or tickets to a charity event that you will attend. Because you would receive something of personal value from these grants, they are not eligible, just like they would not be eligible for a tax deduction. Donor-advised fund dollars are to be used strictly for charitable purposes, such as general scholarship programs at your alma mater or contributions to your local church, synagogue, or mosque.\n\nMake a Qualified Charitable Distribution from your IRA. Qualified Charitable Distributions also cannot be made to private foundations, split-interest charitable trusts, or supporting organizations."
