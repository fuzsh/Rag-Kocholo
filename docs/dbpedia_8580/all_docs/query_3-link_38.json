        "text": "In this era of technology, interest in software development as a skill has steadily grown. It helps businesses implement their plans and ensure their operation process goes smoothly. As a result, people now take courses to learn common software development knowledge so they can code programs themselves. Undoubtedly, the first choice these budding developers have to make would be choosing between many programming languages to start out with.\n\nLet’s begin by answering this crucial question:\n\nWhat are Programming Languages?\n\nYou can easily come across products of programming languages in your daily life. Desktop applications, websites, mobile apps, pop-up advertisements, or even this article you are reading! Software “magicians” create everything mentioned above through “spellbooks” called programming languages.\n\nSimply put, programming languages for software development are artificial languages used in communicating between humans and machines, particularly computers. Programmers (developers) often use them to perform tasks by writing commands and instructions for computers to execute and provide outputs based on the written input. You can find various software development languages, but usually, they are divided into three major types: machine language, assembly language, and high-level language.\n\nBest Programming Languages for Software Development 2023\n\nIt’s essential to pick the right one to learn while working with a programming language for your tasks. But there are plenty of them, and you have a hard time deciding? Worry not, because here are the 10 best programming languages for software development that we recommend checking:\n\n1. Python\n\nPython is a well-known object-oriented, high-level programming language. It was designed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Developers love working with Python for its user-friendly and efficient functions, such as No competition step, fast debugging, portability, etc.\n\nIt is often used for:\n\nWebsites and software development.\n\nSystem scripting.\n\nDatabase systems.\n\nComplex mathematics.\n\nSoftware prototyping.\n\nAnd much more!\n\nSome Pros and Cons:\n\n2. C#\n\nC# (C-Sharp) is an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and released in 2002. Its latest version was recently introduced in November 2022. It runs on the .Net Framework – a software development framework for creating and operating applications on Windows. C#’s applications can be found in almost everything you can think of online, including:\n\nWeb/Mobile/Desktop applications.\n\nGames.\n\nVR.\n\nDatabase systems.\n\nWeb services/sites.\n\nAs popular as it is, C# carries its own set of pros and cons:\n\n3. C++\n\nC++ (C-plus-plus) is a cross-platform language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup and was first introduced in 1985 as an extension of C language. This language allows users to create high-performance applications with high control over system resources and memory. It is still widely used by software developers and is suitable for various applications:\n\nBrowser/Operating systems/Application development\n\nVideo game programming\n\nSoftware engineering\n\nGUI-based applications (Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign/etc.)\n\nDatabase systems\n\nand many more.\n\nBeing one of the earliest programming languages, it is inevitable that C++ has stronger and weaker aspects to it, as shown in the following graph:\n\n4. JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is another cross-platform, object-oriented language created by Brendan Eich in 1995. It is a lightweight, imperative and declarative type of programming language, with low CPU usage, minimalist syntax, and easy implementation. In addition, JavaScript comes compiled and interpreted, which makes it convenient for developers.\n\nJavaScript is often used for, but not limited to:\n\nWeb/Server/Mobile applications.\n\nWeb development.\n\nGames.\n\nMachine learning.\n\nAs with everything else, JavaScript also has two sides to it:\n\n5. TypeScript\n\nTypeScript is a powerful syntactic superset of JavaScript, which adds optional static typing to the language. It was first introduced in 2010 by Microsoft and is developed for large applications and transpilers of JavaScript from both sides – clients and servers. TypeScript enables users to cite the types of data being passed down within the code and report errors when the classes aren’t correct, which JavaScript does not support.\n\nTypeScript is suitable for everything that JavaScript supports, but in much bigger scales, such as:\n\nEnterprise-level applications.\n\nWeb/Server/Mobile applications.\n\nGames.\n\nMachine learning.\n\nHere are some pros and cons for you to check out:\n\n6. SQL\n\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is an ANSI/ISO (American National Standard Institute/International Organization for Standardization) standard language for database-related activities. Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce are two IBM researchers who invented SQL and introduced it to the public in 1974.\n\nIt allows users to access and manipulate the database, commonly found in all applications. You can also embed SQL within other programming languages to build high-performance data processing applications.\n\nSQL is used best for data-based activities, which includes:\n\nCreating new databases.\n\nAnalyzing data.\n\nAltering data.\n\nRetrieving data.\n\nManipulating existing data sets (Insert, Delete, Update,…).\n\nHere are some pros and cons of SQL:\n\n7. PowerShell\n\nPowerShell is an open-source, object-oriented language developed by Microsoft in 2006 based on the .NET framework. It is a cross-platform automation engine, scripting language, and configuration management framework that maintains support from Microsoft and the open-source IT community. PowerShell is powerful when it comes to cyber security, becoming the most useful programming language for the cyber security of Windows operating systems.\n\nPowerShell is often used for:\n\nAutomate the systems management.\n\nManage almost any technology (Azure, Exchange, SQL, AWS, Google Cloud,etc.)\n\nManagement framework.\n\nThe following graph contains some advantages and disadvantages of using PowerShell:\n\n8. Swift\n\nSwift is a high-level, compiled programming language that was first introduced in 2014 by Apple. Its functions can be listed as follows: Multi-paradigm, general-purpose, open source, native error handling, and many more. It’s intended to replace C-based language, but now developers often use it for developing OS (such as iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, iOS, etc.). In addition, as the language is open-source, everyone can easily access its code.\n\nSwift is frequently used for development in the Apple ecosystem:\n\nIPhone and iPad application development\n\nMacOS desktop application development\n\nApple Watch/TV development\n\nWindows operating system development\n\nWeb services/applications\n\nAnd much, much more.\n\nHere are some pros and cons of Swift that you might be interested in:\n\n9. HTML/CSS\n\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are two languages that are often combined for web development. While HTML forms the page’s structure, CSS provides the visual web layout. In 1993, the first version of HTML was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee. And three years later, CSS was initially released by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), becoming the presentation of documents coming from markup languages like HTML.\n\nHTML is used for describing the structure of Web pages, allowing users to publish online documents, retrieve online information, make orders, and do many activities we usually do online nowadays.\n\nCSS is used to describe the presentation of web pages (Colours, layouts, fonts, etc.), allowing developers to design and adapt their sites to different types of devices (TVs, mobile phones, tablets, printers, etc.)\n\nCombined, these two languages are powerful but not without their own shortcomings.\n\n10. Go\n\nGo (or Golang) is an open-source, compiled programming language that Google initially introduced in 2009. Developers immediately fell in love with the language due to its simplicity, efficiency, readability, and multi-tasking function. In addition, it is a cross-platform (mainly desktop) language, making it easier for developers to perform tasks as they can choose to work with already-familiar platforms. Moreover, programmers can also work anywhere, at any time, with anyone as Golang can appear on mobile devices as well.\n\nGo is often used to in:\n\nWeb application development.\n\nDistributed network services.\n\nCloud-native development.\n\nMedia platforms.\n\nAnd many more.\n\nAs it is a fairly new language, Go has some drawbacks to its strengths, being:\n\nAfter seeing all the types of programming languages for software development, people often ask: “What is the easiest coding language?”, and there is no certain answer to it. It depends on each individual’s needs for learning.\n\nTo be honest, earning a programming language is undoubtedly quite challenging because of its differences from human language. However, it’s still the most basic requirement if you want to dedicate yourself to the software development industry. And to choose the most useful coding language to your liking, you will have to consider all the options before settling down with one.\n\nWhy Should You Consider Programming Languages?\n\nIn the software development segment, there are different types of categories that require distinct programs, and programming languages. These can be specifically listed as: Websites, Backend/Frontend, Compilers, Operating systems, Video games, Desktop/Mobile applications, and so on. As different programming functions are required, you will have to learn different types of programming languages depending on what areas you follow.\n\nBefore choosing a language to learn, you should set up your target with these questions in mind:\n\nWhat are your needs?;\n\nHow are you gonna learn it?\n\nWhy is this language suitable for your needs?\n\nWhen are you gonna follow it?\n\nWe can narrow down some suitable languages for different branches of software developments for you:\n\nIf you are interested in developing websites, you could consider trying the following languages:\n\nHTML\n\nJavaScript\n\nPHP\n\nPython\n\nDo you want to go for database development? Try:\n\nSQL\n\nMySQL\n\nDBASE\n\nFoxPro\n\nIf developing mobile applications is your interest, maybe take a look at the following:\n\nC\n\nC#\n\nC++\n\nSwift\n\nJava\n\nIs game development your dream job? You can experience the following:\n\nC\n\nC#\n\nC++\n\nJava\n\nIf you intend to learn programming languages for software development, we recommend choosing the most suitable one for your needs rather than following what people use the most. As a result, you can save time, money, and effort in learning programming languages. Eventually, it will bring you more benefits than you expect.\n\nHowever, if you want to experience all programming languages for software development, go for it. It may take time and lots of effort, but gradually you will find the most suitable coding tools you feel comfortable working with.\n\nRikkeisoft – An Alternative for Software Development\n\nIf you have decided that you would forgo the process of learning how to code altogether yet still want a complete software product, you can think of outsourcing the development to a reliable service provider like Rikkeisoft.\n\nFounded in 2012, Rikkeisoft is a Vietnamese IT service provider with complete software development packages in any programming language you can think of.
