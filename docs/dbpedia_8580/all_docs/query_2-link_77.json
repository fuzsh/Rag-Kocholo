        "text": "After downloading the MPC Application from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, eligible travelers will be prompted to create a profile with their passport or LPR card information. Upon arrival at eligible Preclearance locations users must select their mode of entry in the application as \"Preclearance\" before selecting their departing Preclearance Port of Entry. If a traveler is not using preclearance, upon landing in the United States, travelers will select \"U.S. airport\" as their mode of entry and then select their arrival airport or seaport and terminal. Travelers will then take a self-photo and answer a series of CBP inspection-related questions. Once the traveler submits their transaction through the app, travelers will then bring their physical passport to a CBP officer to finalize their inspection for entry into the United States.\n\nCellular or Wi-Fi connectivity is required to send information, but travelers may complete profile(s) without being connected to the internet.\n\nCBP uses the Mobile Passport Control (MPC) application to streamline the processing of eligible travelers entering the United States. Eligible travelers with a smartphone or tablet may voluntarily download the Mobile Passport Control (MPC)-enabled mobile application (app) from a mobile application store (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play Store).\n\nThe MPC mobile app, is available to U.S. citizens, U.S. lawful permanent residents, Canadian B1/B2 citizen visitors and returning Visa Waiver Program travelers with approved ESTA. MPC is currently available at the following 52 sites, including 34 U.S. International Airports, 14 Preclearance locations, and 4 seaports of entry:\n\nAbu Dhabi Zayed International Airport (AUH)\n\nAtlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL)\n\nAruba Queen Beatrix International Airport (AUA)\n\nBermuda L.F. Wade International Airport (BDA)\n\nBaltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)\n\nBoston Logan International Airport (BOS)\n\nCalgary International Airport (YYC)\n\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT)\n\nChicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD)\n\nDallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)\n\nDenver International Airport (DEN)\n\nDetroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW)\n\nDulles International Airport (IAD)\n\nDublin Airport (DUB)\n\nEdmonton International Airport (YEG)\n\nFort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL)\n\nHalifax Stanfield International Airport (YHZ)\n\nHonolulu Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL)\n\nHouston George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)\n\nHouston William P. Hobby International Airport (HOU)\n\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)\n\nKansas City International Airport (MCI)\n\nLas Vegas Harry Ried International Airport (LAS)\n\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX)\n\nMiami International Airport (MIA)\n\nMiami Seaport (MSE)\n\nMinneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (MSP)\n\nMontreal Trudeau International Airport (YUL)\n\nNassau Lynden Pindling International Airport (NAS)\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (EWR)\n\nOakland International Airport (OAK)\n\nOrlando International Airport (MCO)\n\nOttawa International Airport (YOW)\n\nPalm Beach Seaport (WPB)\n\nPhiladelphia International Airport (PHL)\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)\n\nPittsburgh International Airport (PIT)\n\nPort Everglades Seaport (PEV)\n\nPortland International Airport (PDX)\n\nSacramento International Airport (SMF)\n\nSalt Lake City International Airport (SLC)\n\nSan Diego International Airport (SAN)\n\nSan Francisco International Airport (SFO)\n\nSan Jose International Airport (SJC)\n\nSan Juan Airport (SJU)\n\nSan Juan Seaport (SAJ)\n\nSeattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA)\n\nShannon Airport (SNN)\n\nTampa International Airport (TPA)\n\nToronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ)\n\nVancouver International Airport (YVR)\n\nWinnipeg James A Richardson International Airport (YWG)\n\nYes, the traveler’s document information and answers to CBP inspection-related questions are submitted directly to CBP via secure encryption protocols. The information you enter on the authorized applications are securely transmitted to CBP which sends a response to the apps, generating the electronic receipt you may display when entering the MPC queue. The authorized apps provide the option to store your profile on your smartphone or tablet for future travel or deleting it after your trip. Please note that the photo taken on the application will need to be updated periodically. CBP recommends travelers review the application’s privacy policy prior to download and use. Only information entered after the traveler acknowledges CBP’s notices (i.e., CBP’s mobile privacy policy, Section 311 of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, Disclaimer Statement and the Paperwork Reduction Act Notice) is required to be compliant with CBP’s MPC business requirements.\n\nTravelers will not be able to use MPC if their flight is diverted to a U.S. airport that does not utilize MPC processing. Upon arrival at the diverted airport, travelers will follow standard processing procedures. If you were processed by a CBP officer in Preclearance, you would land as a domestic passenger and can proceed to your destination or connecting flight."
