        "text": "Meghan M.\n\nRPR, KANSAS CSR\n\nI received a job offer with the firm I interned with immediately!\n\nI was a senior in high school when I first heard about the wonderful profession of Court Reporting. That’s part of what I love about it. There are people who don’t even know it exists! I chose the CRAH online training rather than a brick-and-mortar school, and I am SO glad I did. First off, I am completely debt free! There is one price, and that is it. They even provide their incredibly helpful Support Department FOR LIFE! The Support Department doesn’t just answer your question; they give you a lengthy response that explains why something is a certain way, and they really make sure you understand it. Also, this is a need-to-know program. What I mean by that is, you don’t have to take any other classes that don’t pertain to Court Reporting (or whichever career you choose). They provide everything you require in training to become a professional Court Reporter, or Captioner, or CART Provider. It was the perfect fit for me. I am a no-nonsense, get straight to the point type of person. 🙂\n\nI’m going to be honest here; this was not an easy journey by any means, but it was a VERY REWARDING journey. Support develops a VERY structured Speed Building Practice Regimen for you based upon the number of hours you tell them you can practice most days, but it is up to YOU how much you really practice. You can take it anywhere and take as much time as you need to finish. This training takes a great deal of discipline, extreme determination, and the will to get back up again after falling down. (These are valuable life lessons that I only learned while taking this program!)\n\nThere were days that I wanted to quit, and days that I thought there was no way I was ever going to finish. But there were also always days where I’d pass a speed level that I’d been trying to pass and days where my writing was very clean, and I could feel myself progressing! All I can say is NEVER GIVE UP. Practice when you don’t want to practice. Practice while everyone else is on a break. It is worth it!\n\nToday, I am a professional Court Reporter at 22 years old. After I finished this program, CRAH contacted a court reporting firm and set up my internship, wrote a letter of recommendation for me to receive a two-year Temporary Work Permit, and I received a job offer with the firm I interned with immediately!\n\nLinda and the CRAH Support Department continue to help me prepare to pass the next certification exam. They truly care about you and want you to become a successful reporter, captioner, or CART provider, and THAT is what makes this program so very valuable!\n\nRemember: The good things in life only come after long, hard work.\n\nMeghan M., RPR, Kansas CSR\n\nCamille J.\n\nCOURT REPORTER\n\nCRAH supported and guided me all the way. I didn't have to pay any EXTRA money for interning in all three areas.\n\nI'm so excited for this opportunity to share my experience with CRAH. Originally, I chose CRAH because of the flexibility it provided while I worked a full-time job. I was ultimately able to finish in a reasonable amount of time. This has been an unbelievable journey. I will say that CRAH has truly been my backbone throughout this whole process. Honestly, I've never been a part of a school so dedicated to YOUR success. CRAH has gone above and beyond what you would expect from ANY court reporting school or program.\n\nI began with CART and performed an onsite as well as a remote internship, with training for the ultimate goal of Captioning. It was a wonderful, eye-opening opportunity. Then I set my sights on actual Court Reporting. CRAH scheduled an internship for me, and, ultimately, a job was offered with the same firm I interned with. Before I knew it, I had interned in all three of the careers.\n\nCRAH supported and guided me all the way. I didn't have to pay any EXTRA money for interning in all three areas. I just expressed my goals to CRAH, and they were on board. They were my biggest fan throughout this whole process. I am truly grateful to CRAH for all their encouragement and support through the tough times and the thoughtfulness of saying congratulations or job well done through the good times (passing a speed test or performing an internship).\n\nIf you are reading these testimonials and wondering if this is the right approach for your court reporting/captioning/CART providing career, I would say to you, this has been the best experience I could have had in learning something that will benefit me for the rest of my life. In addition to all the great learning materials and the ease of learning online, the support you receive is excellent. This has been one of the best investments I have made for myself and wouldn't change the decision for the world. Thank you, Court Reporting and Captioning at Home, for everything!!\n\nCamille J.\n\nFreelance Court Reporter\n\nKaren F.\n\nCAPTIONER, CART PROVIDER, REALTIME WRITER\n\nI will be stadium captioning the Super Bowl!\n\n\"I was honored when I was asked to caption Superbowl 50 at Levis Stadium!\n\nWords cannot describe the excitement and proud feelings rushing through my mind and body as I prepare for this day!\n\nLearning how to \"script\" has saved me in preparing to write the most exciting assignment ever!!\n\nWith over 70,000 Superbowl fans using their smartphones/wifi on Gameday, you can guarantee that I will be prepared!!\"\n\nI am captioning the San Francisco 49ers games again and have a contract with the brand new Levis Stadium! So I now caption all events at Levis Stadium. It’s exciting! They have put my captions on all 2700 TV screens! I really do enjoy captioning the games and events. It’s really fun!\n\nI’m ready … every Sunday as I prepare to write the next professional football game! When I was training with Court Reporting and Captioning at Home, I never dreamed that one day I would be spending my Sundays captioning an NFL game!\n\nWhile I’ve REALLY enjoyed my career as a CART provider, writing for hearing impaired students in colleges, I wanted to branch out into captioning, too. I enjoy every assignment. I don’t consider what I do “work.” I LOVE my two careers!\n\nDuring my training with CRAH, I worked full time and had two small children. You HAVE to make the time to practice. But if I could do this, you can, too.\n\nThere are SO many employment opportunities as a realtime writer, and my training with Court Reporting and Captioning at Home and their wonderful Support Department made it all possible. Realtime writing keeps us in demand!\n\nI have to say that as a professional, reaching out and asking for help, looking for resources, is a must if you want to advance in the career of your dreams. Like anything else, you have to expect hard work to get great results.\n\nJust remember … It is never too late to train for your dream career, one tailored to your personality and skills. Believe in your dreams. They are ready and waiting to come true, but you have to take the first step and get started.\n\nAll my best, Karen\n\nJessica S.\n\nCART CAPTIONER\n\nIf I can do this, SO CAN YOU! I would highly recommend CRAH!\n\nAlthough I had some prior training with a traditional school quite a few years back, they, unfortunately, closed before I could finish, leaving me feeling pretty devastated. When I began with CRAH, I decided to start over from the beginning with Theory to ensure I could be an excellent realtime writer. The CRAH Theory is an excellent realtime theory! One of the professional CART captioners who assessed my writing said my writing and translation were phenomenal for a novice! So I knew my theory was excellent!\n\nHaving attended the actual school before CRAH, I’ll admit I was a little skeptical. I wasn’t sure if I would have the drive or the discipline to be at home practicing diligently like I knew I would need to in order to finish my program. However, with the CRAH Support Team, you never feel alone.\n\nI am beyond grateful, too, that I was able to obtain financing for CRAH through their partnership with The Auburn University (Yes, you read that right.), and I think it’s amazing that I now have a Certificate of Completion from a major university!\n\nThrough lots of hard work and perseverance, I passed my 225 QA! Let me tell you, there is nothing quite like the feeling of knowing that YOU accomplished this, and no one else. The Support Team at CRAH is incredible. Everything was always placed on my student platform when it was required, including tests! Support was always cheering me on, which helped me some days more than they realize, I am sure. And there is one thing I can say for sure, the structured Speed Building Practice Regimen was responsible for helping me build my speed so quickly.\n\nCRAH is above and beyond what you could ever expect of any school and provides unbelievably excellent Support and the best words of encouragement when you need them the most. Their wisdom, experience, and Support always left me feeling reassured. When I decided to train for CART captioning, CRAH scheduled both a remote CART internship as well as an onsite CART internship at a nearby university! I am still blown away by that and forever grateful to CRAH for allowing me to have that experience. Because of CRAH’s job placement assistance, I am now employed with an amazing group of people who I know will help me become the CART captioner I know I can be.\n\nI think the greatest thing I can reflect on now that I have completed my CART training is that CRAH is not just an online training program, they are a family. CRAH is a tremendous group of talented people who have the experience to help you in the best ways possible. I can honestly say I feel I am a part of the CRAH family. And I know that my relationship with CRAH doesn’t end with the completion of my training! They will always be available to answer any questions I may have and help guide me in any way they can as I navigate my way through my new career!\n\nWith all of that said, I know that if I can do this, SO CAN YOU! I would highly recommend CRAH!\n\nJessica S.\n\nAnna H.\n\nCART PROVIDER\n\nBecause of CRAH I'm a CART Provider and I love it!\n\nI am very happy to have found the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home program. I started out as an online court reporting student at another school, but made the switch to Court Reporting and Captioning at Home after some extensive research into traditional and online court reporting programs. I want to share with you some of the benefits that I have found with this wonderful program.\n\nOne, as a mother of two young boys that I also homeschool, flexibility was key for me. CRAH provided that flexibility that I absolutely needed. I was not worried about having to meet the hourly requirements per week like at other online court reporting schools. I could put in more hours a week or less hours depending on my schedule.\n\nTwo, the affordability of the program was enticing. I was spending about 3K per semester at my other online court reporting program basically teaching myself anyway. Sure, there were lessons to practice and teachers to ask questions, BUT THEY WERE NOTHING LIKE WHAT I GET AT CRAH… which brings me to my next benefit of CRAH… SUPPORT!\n\nThe support that I received from Court Reporting and Captioning at Home is second to none! It is NOTHING like what I found at my other online school. The support team is so helpful and knowledgeable, and they have encouraged me every step of the journey. I have e‑mailed them questions MANY times, and I was never left waiting or wondering when, or if, I’d even get an answer or response. You will ALWAYS want to keep in touch with this amazing support team that is available to you and FOR you!\n\nIf you have found yourself in that same position, then you are probably fed up like I once was. CRAH’s program and Support team may be just what you’re looking for and need. CRAH, as well as any other program or theory, is not a magic pill. This skill takes nothing less than hard work, determination, and focus. But when you use correctly all the tools that the CRAH program provides you, especially the Speed Building Practice Regimen, and stick with it, you will find the program as a wonderful compass and guide that can help lead you into the career of your dreams. Because of the CRAH training program and Linda’s help, I am now working professionally as a CART Provider, and I LOVE IT!!!! It is really a dream come true for me! I am having so much fun . I’m so blessed to have found a career I LOVE!\n\nAnna H. UPDATE FROM ANNA!\n\nI wanted to share something that has made me so happy.\n\nI am CARTing an EXTREMELY difficult class this semester. This class is a KILLER, because the professor talks a mile a minute. He discussed cellular biology in less than 5 minutes, because he was rushing to get it all in before class ended. So you can imagine how FAST that was. Anyway, at the end of class, I had the student say this!\n\n\"Your captions are awesome! Thank you.\" Put me on Cloud 9!!! I am SOOOO happy!!!! This really helped me!! 🙂\n\nKristina C.\n\nCART CAPTIONER\n\nThe best part is, when you finish, they find you a job!\n\nI have wanted to be a court reporter since I was in my 20’s but never had the good fortune to live anywhere near a school that offered the program (no internet back then!). Life went on, and 30 years later, I was just looking up online court reporting schools, contemplating just going for it, when I came across Court Reporting and Captioning at Home and thought it looked perfect! The brick and mortar schools were far too expensive to take that chance.\n\nThe Court Reporting and Captioning at Home online program worked perfectly for me! As an “older student,” your brain may not absorb the information quite as quickly as a younger student, but it definitely is possible, and I’M LIVING PROOF!\n\nI loved the CRAH program as you do it at your own pace. Support is available to you whenever you need it, and they are EXTREMELY helpful! The best part is, when you finish, they find you a job! AND THEY REALLY DO! Linda herself worked very hard at getting me internships and employment.\n\nI started off wanting to be a court reporter, but after interning for a few firms and in court a few times, I decided this was not the type of work I really wanted to do. So, I asked Linda to prepare me for CART providing, and she sent me the CRAH CART Providing training materials, and I trained for CART. She then developed a remote (from my home) internship with a wonderful former student of hers who now owns her own CART business, and she has helped me tremendously in the field and even employed me for classes with her school! I am currently providing remote CART services twice a week with this college, which is preparing me to go out on my own and solicit work with schools close to me, or even schools who would prefer remote captioners. So, my experience with CRAH was and is a very positive experience! I highly recommend this program to anyone looking to get into this wonderful field!\n\nAmy\n\nRPR, MISSISSIPPI CSR, FIRM OWNER\n\nI passed the Mississippi CSR Exam!!! Court Reporting and Captioning at Home developed a speed building practice regimen for me just based on passing the Mississippi CSR Certification Exam, and it worked!\n\nThe Court Reporting and Captioning at Home Program was the best decision I could have made for my future! I had the experience of going to a court reporting school, so I can actually compare the difference between the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home home study program and attending a traditional court reporting school. I would recommend the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home online program to anybody interested in court reporting, broadcast captioning, and CART Providing.\n\nFirst of all, Linda’s real time theory is super easy to learn. It is amazing how simplified she has made learning something that could be extremely difficult. I was able to finish her lesson plan in two months’ time and then start my speed building.\n\nHer court reporting speed building platform does have difficult material, but with the real time theory that her court reporting program teaches, it only took me 9 months to pass two of her 225 wpm tests for testimony, as well as the 180 lit and 200 JC.\n\nThe court reporting support staff was always there for me with a quickly returned email. Due to her wonderful court reporting training program and her assistance in placement, I am now working in Mississippi for an amazing court reporting firm and have more work than I can handle. I am able to hook up real time during an assignment, and because of her theory, I have the confidence to set this up and allow the attorneys to view my realtime writing if they like. I am so grateful for Linda developing the Court Reporting at Home program and would choose her court reporting program over any court reporting school or court reporting school online program again if I had it to do over!!\n\nThanks so very, very much, Linda.\n\n-Amy K.\n\nBarb M.\n\nCART Captioner, Canada\n\nNow I’m employed as a CART Captioner!\n\nMy name is Barbara, and I want to say “Thank You” from the bottom of my heart to Linda Bland and the entire staff at Court Reporting and Captioning at Home. I’m sure they had no idea what they were getting themselves into when I made the decision to train with this incredible program! I am a single mother of a son and daughter who are now adults, and now my family has extended to include my daughter-in-law. Also, I’m a proud grandmother of three little boys. Additionally, I own and operate a cattle ranch in southern Alberta, Canada.\n\nSpecial thanks go to the incredible Support Department for setting up a time-management regimen that allowed me to work through the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home program consistently day by day, as well as the endless time and support they provided me from start to finish. I think we all invested a lot of time in me given my occupation! And everyone was always patient, caring, professional and informative. There were times when they had to pick me up, brush me off, and give me another push in the right direction. Their support was amazing. They never allowed me to quit!\n\nThey committed to get me through this program, and I, in turn, committed to do everything they advised. I had to be very disciplined and consistent, and now I’m so grateful I followed Court Reporting and Captioning at Home’s instructions. They definitely understood me as an individual. Their very structured Speed Building Practice Regimen absolutely was responsible for helping me build my speed. When I was closer to being ready to caption, Linda and her staff provided me with an internship from my home in Canada, and I also chose to perform an additional onsite internship in southern California for a week. They provided me with job placement, and now I’m employed as a CART Captioner for deaf or hearing impaired college students. I have recently started to work remotely from home, and I’m getting such great experience as an Independent Contractor. I love my job! It also allows me to continue with my ranching which is also a huge part of our life.\n\nThank you, again, Court Reporting and Captioning at Home. I know I was a challenge for you, and I couldn’t be more thrilled with my choice to train with you that has allowed me to reach my ultimate goal.\n\nBarbara M., CART Captioner\n\nKeema K.\n\nREPORTER SUPERIOR COURT VIRGIN ISLANDS\n\nThe support is absolutely the best!\n\nDreams do come true, even if they take decades. Twenty-four years ago, I pursued the traditional two-year school setting to become a court reporter. At first, I was impressed with the glamour and importance of the field. After I completed my 225 WPM; however, I just did not follow through with my internship. Since that time, I found my niche in the fashion industry and have been self-employed all these years in the retail clothing industry.\n\nA few years ago, there was an opportunity here on St. Croix Virgin Islands, where I was born and raised, for me to make some additional income in a field that I had trained in so many years ago. So I started seeking some information on the web and ran into www.courtreportingathome.com. I read every testimonial and information offered on this website. I was impressed and encouraged with what I found and made the decision to allow Linda and her team to help me rebuild my speed as well as update my theory to a realtime writing theory. This was one of the greatest decisions ever; it was money well spent!\n\nBecause of my hectic schedule, it took me a little longer than expected, but nonetheless, I persevered. The support team here is absolutely the best. They provided great feedback and on time responses. They were so supportive and encouraging through my journey. And boy, what a journey it was. It took me a while to stay focused, because being a single mom, raising two teenaged boys, running a business, and becoming newly engaged was at times very distracting. I was determined and relentlessly trained to complete the program. Thus, once I made up my mind, set some deadlines, and worked with the support staff at www.courtreportingathome.com, I completed the program.\n\nCourt Reporting and Captioning at Home scheduled an internship for me with a local court reporter. Upon completion of my internship, I obtained my dream job in the court system. I was interviewed and hired at the Superior Court in our Territory! I am now preparing to take the RPR examinations and hope to pass them on my first attempt. I’m still in contact with Linda and her staff to help me through this process. To anyone trying to make up their mind about this wonderful program, I say this is the way to go; I say to you, look no further. I just want to say thank you, to you, Linda, and your staff, for your willingness to see me through this.\n\nIt was an unbelievable pleasure going through this program with your support. I’m glad I made the right choice. You are testimony to the words of Albert Pike: “What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.”\n\nEvelyn Z.\n\nCaptioner and CA. CSR\n\nCRAH let me fulfill my dream to become a Closed Captioner!\n\nMy 36-year career as a Court Reporter began at the age of 19 in my home state of California. My dream was to work in court; however, my school administrator informed me no one would hire me for a court position straight out of school with no experience. He meant no harm, but I wouldn’t let anyone discourage me. I believe in asking for what I want. So with no experience at the age of 20 I was hired as a court official in Superior Court in Northern California.\n\nFast forward to 2014. It’s time for a change. But what happened to the fearless young adult who had turned into a self-doubting, middle-aged woman. Can I re-invent myself? Can I change my writing after 36 years? Can I become a Broadcast Captioner?\n\nAfter researching courses on the Internet, I decided “The Court Reporting and Captioning At Home” Captioning course would be my best choice. After speaking with Linda Bland and without hesitation, I ordered the course. This course gave me the necessary tools to successfully transition to Broadcast Captioning. I will admit I had my moments of frustration because change can be difficult, but anything worth having is worth fighting for. Once again, I was determined to fulfill my dream.\n\nUpon completing the CRAH Captioning course I submitted my first and only resume` by e-mail to a company which was my top choice for employment. To my surprise, I received an immediate response, and I was offered a position over the phone. No more fighting traffic, no more driving in storms, no more transcript deadlines. My official work attire is yoga pants and t-shirts. I almost can’t believe this is happening. I took a leap of faith. I began the CRAH Captioning course in March and by December, I have a full-time job. I have to pinch myself! Yes, I made it! You can, too.\n\nA year from now we’re all going to be another year older. If not now, when? To quote Amelia Earhart, “The most difficult thing is the decision to act. The rest is merely tenacity.”\n\nMy only regret is that I didn’t do this 10 years ago.\n\nWant to stay relevant? Want to stay young? Never Stop Learning! This evening I captioned the President’s State of the Union Address for a New York television station. This is very exciting for me! I couldn’t have done it without the CRAH course.\n\nEvelyn Z.\n\nFlorida\n\nJodie S.\n\nRPR, Australia\n\nThe support department was truly amazing. Any questions I had were always replied to so quickly.\n\nI just wanted to say a huge “Thank you” to Court Reporting and Captioning at Home for your wonderful program. Before I started, I had emailed them with a number of questions about the program and whether they thought it would work for me. My main concern was my location across the other side of the world in Australia. However, this was not a problem, and they were able to quickly answer all my questions. Even the logistics of getting the machine and program shipped to me was no hassle at all – It only took a few days to arrive. - I was so excited to open it up and get started. As soon as I saw all the materials I had been sent, I felt sure I was going to be able to complete this program at home with support from Court Reporting and Captioning at Home along the way.\n\nThe theory component is divided into 20 chapters of clear and easy to understand material. The diagrams and explanations included were helpful, and I LOVED the little words of encouragement scattered throughout the theory too! The online video instructions for the course were great, too. It really made it feel like I was in a classroom learning this.\n\nI was undertaking this training at the same time as raising two young children, so I wasn’t able to dedicate myself to it full time. Even so, I was still able to get through the theory component quite quickly and onto the speed building. The speed building component was also set out and organized so well. I received my personalized Speed Building Practice Regimen and followed it exactly. I knew how and what I should be practicing to develop my speed, so my time was always focused and not wasted trying to determine what I should practice.\n\nThe support department was truly amazing. Any questions I had were always replied to so quickly. Even the time difference between Australia and the US was never an issue. I always received replies promptly, even on weekends and holidays. It really was a huge help to know that someone was always available to answer any questions as soon as possible.\n\nAnother huge plus with the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home program is that it provides academics training and materials needed to pass the RPR or State exams. To achieve my RPR certification was always a goal of mine. The academics material CRAH provided, along with the mock exams, prepared me perfectly for the written knowledge component of the RPR, and I passed it on the FIRST attempt. With all the help, support, and practice material provided by Court Reporting and Captioning at Home, I can now say I am officially an RPR, and it’s all thanks to the wonderful team at Court Reporting and Captioning at Home! Becoming a stenographer can be a bit of a lonely journey (especially training on the other side of the world), but I always felt like I had a team of supporters available to me at any time for questions or encouragement. I honestly can’t recommend Court Reporting and Captioning at Home highly enough. I have loved every minute of it. Thank you so much for your fantastic program.\n\nPriscella D.\n\nCART Provider\n\nI can push through, and I can SUCCEED!\n\nI had taken Court Reporting at a traditional court reporting school in my early 20’s and always regretted not finishing, when I found myself at home with two little ones. I knew that this was the time I needed to prepare myself and find something I enjoyed doing to be able to contribute once my kids were in school. My sister actually found Court Reporting and Captioning at Home online and told me about it. I bought the court reporting program and began, but it has not been an easy road for me. School was never ‘my thing.’ I wanted to quit. I know for a while I did not study the way the Speed Building Practice Regimen was laid out. I would get stuck in just writing and not editing. I wanted to be able to put what I learned to use, but not under the stress of trying to juggle home and work and being absent from my kids or missing out on their school programs, etc. And I certainly didn’t want a 9-5 job!\n\nI spoke to Linda about this, and she told me about CART Providing and asked if I would be interested. I really couldn’t believe what I was hearing! Could I really start working from home and make a decent income? I really didn’t believe it was possible, but I was all ears. After Court Reporting and Captioning at Home prepared me for CART Providing and scheduled a remote CART Providing internship for me, I was employed by a University. It has been great!! I am so glad I didn’t quit. Every day I am learning more and becoming a better writer through this experience, and it is a great stepping stone for the future. For now, this is where I want to be.\n\nI am extremely grateful for Linda, the staff, and my Support people who were always there for me. When I wanted to quit, Linda put me back on track and encouraged me to stick with it. Thank you for believing in me and helping me to believe in myself! Perseverance has taught me a lot about myself. It has taught me that I CAN do the challenging things! I can push through, and I can SUCCEED!\n\nMarcie Culliton\n\nCaptioner\n\nCRAH made my dream to caption come true!\n\nI have always wanted to see myself writing in realtime, but my old theory was full of conflicts. I thought it would be impossible to change my style of writing. Thirty years later, searching for court reporting schools through the internet, I found Court Reporting and Captioning at Home. I decided to start completely from scratch, as if I had never experienced steno before, and learned Linda Bland’s Realtime Reporting and Captioning theory. It was so organized and super easy to learn. At first I thought my brain and fingers might not incorporate the new concepts and would revert back to my old style of writing, but I was wrong. The first time I saw my writing in realtime, I actually had tears in my eyes. Writing in realtime is amazing! I learned realtime so much faster, because I made the switch from my old theory, when I first learned to become a court reporter, which was full of conflicts, to the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home theory. It was the best decision I made to achieve my dream to be a caption provider.\n\nCRAH provided me with endless practice dictation, and with practice and wonderful support and encouragement from the Court Reporting at Home Support Department, I am writing realtime conflict-free! I also have found the asterisk is my friend, and I use it often to stay conflict-freeJ If a grandmother of a two-year-old can modify her theory, I truly believe CRAH’s theory can make any old-time steno writer into a realtime writer. Give it a whirl. You’ll be glad you did!\n\nAs for me now, I am doing exactly what I prayed for 14 years ago. I was sitting at a QWERTY keyboard typing telephone conversations for the deaf and hard of hearing at 80 w.p.m., and I said to God, “This would be so much easier if I was writing these conversations on a steno machine. Would you make it happen for me someday?” And here I am today writing business calls, personal calls, and even conference calls for the deaf and hard of hearing using my steno machine! I always tell God that I can do nothing without Him; but with God, I can do anything – even realtime J\n\nMarcie, Telephone Captioner\n\nLisa T\n\nCART Provider\n\nCRAH helped me every step of the way!\n\nThere is not enough space in this testimonial section to fully encapsulate my experience with the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home program.\n\nPerhaps I should start with some adjectives: FANTASTIC! FUN! SUPPORTIVE! ASTOUNDING! And not to sound too over-kill or like a worn out infomercial, I cannot speak highly enough about Linda Bland’s CRAH program.\n\nFirst, the theory is easier and more comprehensive than any brick and mortar court reporting school out there. I know this, because I attended a traditional court reporting school many years ago. I was unable to complete my schooling, but always wanted to finish. Like many, I found Linda’s court reporting and captioning program while doing a Google search. And believe me, I looked into all sorts of online and brick and mortar court reporting programs. After a long conversation with Linda, I was sold! For a fraction of the price of other court reporting programs, I was excited to begin my theory again. I finished theory in short order. The supportive staff helped me every step of the way and never made me feel silly for all of my questions. Linda’s and the staff’s support are truly endless, and their patience is unbelievable.\n\nOne of the many things that is so very special and unique about Linda Bland is that she will truly never, ever, never give up on you. I went through many highs and lows, and she was there for me through thick and thin. I truly love it. It is a dream come true! I cannot articulate how grateful I am to Linda and her staff for this experience. It has been life-changing.\n\nIf you are considering a career in court reporting, broadcast (closed) captioning or CART, look no further. You have found Court Reporting and Captioning at Home.\n\nYou will not regret your decision!\n\nLisa T.\n\nThere is not enough space in this testimonial section to fully encapsulate my experience with the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home program.\n\nPerhaps I should start with some adjectives: FANTASTIC!

I knew then and there I wanted to be a court reporter as I watched her leave the office….and it was only 1:30!!! I still had 4 1/2 more hours to go.\n\nI remember typing in “Court Reporting” on my computer and came across the Court Reporting and Captioning at Home online program and couldn’t believe how reasonably priced it was. I purchased it, and a few months later, I started it right away, practicing as much as I could. Unfortunately, being newly divorced and having two little girls, I kept putting my practicing on the back burner. Truth is, I became depressed, and I couldn’t even begin thinking about starting a career when I needed to start my life again!!\n\nOne morning, I knew it was now or never. The difference was, this time I was determined. Nothing was stopping me this time. I MADE THE TIME to practice every morning and every night!! I FINALLY COMPLETED, and it was time for me to start taking depositions. I contacted a few agencies and met some different people in the industry and got out there to start work!\n\nI recently contacted Linda Bland to tell her of the news, and she was so excited to hear from me!!! It made me feel incredible, and I owe it all to her and her wonderfully structured court reporting and captioning program! As long as I gave whatever amount of time I could, even 30 minutes, I realized it was better than nothing. Some days I was able to practice 5 hours and other days only 30 minutes. I would watch TV and take my writer out and practice!!! I did whatever I could to get my practicing in!\n\nTake it from me. It’s never too late to start this wonderful career!! I get to meet great people and make fantastic money at the same time! Do whatever it takes…PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!! Never give up, because the more you can put into your training, the more rewarding it will be in the end when you can look back and say, “I did it”!!!! The possibilities are endless!!!\n\nThis has been the best court reporting program that I’ve ever come across.\n\nJosephine L."
