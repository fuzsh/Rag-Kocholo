        "text": "R programming is one of the most requested skills by employers in the data science industry. If youâre considering learning the R language, youâll be happy to know that itâs available to the public for free under the Free Software Foundationâs GNU General Public License.\n\nSome consider R to be more challenging to learn than other programming languages, but those with a statistical background may find it to be easier. You can learn more about the R programming language, what itâs used for, and how to learn it in the following article.Â\n\nR programming language overview\n\nR is a free, open-source programming language, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it. It was initially written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (also known as R&R) of the University of Aucklandâs Statistics Department. However, the statistical programming language we know today as R is a collaborative effort made up of many global contributions and managed by the R Core Team.Â\n\nR programming language features and environment\n\nR is an implementation of the programming language S. Similarly, it allows users to implement new functionalities by defining new functions. It also has integration capabilities with C and C++. Other notable features of R include:\n\nWide range of libraries\n\nLarge and active community of users\n\nOptimal data storage and handling\n\nSuite of data analysis tools and operators\n\nPackages to develop neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI)\n\nConditionals, loops, input and output facilities, and user-defined iterative functions\n\nPlatform-independent and capable of running on all operating systems (Windows, Mac, UNIX, Linux)\n\nWhat is R programming used for?\n\nMost commonly, the R language is used for data analysis and statistical computing. Itâs also an effective tool for machine learning algorithms. R is especially relevant for data science professionals due to its data cleaning, importing, and visualization capabilities. You can use it to create graphics such as charts and use statistical techniques like data reduction, classification, and clustering.Â\n\nR programming examples\n\nOne of the most notable features of R is its versatility. Here are a few examples of industries that use it:\n\nSocial media companies. Social media platforms collect massive amounts of data every day. Many of the actions you take online are tracked, stored, and used by analysts to target advertising. R is often used by companies to parse, analyze, and visualize these insights.Â\n\nHealth care. The R programming language is used in epidemiology to track and predict the spread of disease. Itâs also employed in drug discovery to analyze the data collected during pre-clinical trials.Â\n\nFinancial technology (FinTech). R is one of the most popular programming languages in the financial services industry. Itâs used for credit scoring, risk management, and statistical analyses for investment predictions.Â\n\nPros and cons of R programming\n\nWhat is the best way to learn R programming?\n\nThere are a couple different ways to learn to program in R. You might determine which one is right for you by considering your learning preferences, budget, and time constraints. Those who prefer more hands-on guidance may benefit from enrolling in an online program, whereas learners who enjoy independent study may not require as much instruction. Below, you can browse recommendations for online courses, certificate programs, Guided Projects, and community resources for independent learning.Â\n\nOnline courses\n\nGoogle Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This beginner-level, flexible, online program focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization with R, SQL, and Tableau. In just six months, you can have a shareable certificate for your resume and a foundational knowledge of Rstudio, R programming, and R markdown.Â\n\nIBM Data Analytics with Excel and R Professional Certificate This beginner-level program can be completed in just three months. Itâs designed to guide learners through the processes of programming, data analysis, preparation, and predictive modeling using R, Rstudio, and Jupyter. By the end, youâll earn an employer-recognized certificate from IBM.Â\n\nData Analysis with R Specialization. This beginner-friendly online course is meant to help learners master data analysis with R. Covered concepts include statistical testing and inference, linear modeling, and utilization of regression models to analyze relationships between variables. Itâs flexible, offered by Duke University, and can be completed in four months.Â\n\nSelf-teaching resources\n\nThe R Journal. This peer-reviewed scientific journal published by the R Foundation is open-access. You can read various topics of interest relevant to both R developers and users.Â\n\nRstudio books. You can browse a list of free online books about R here.Â\n\nsatRdays. These not-for-profit global conferences are held on Saturdays and orchestrated by local communities. They are free or cheap, and focus on R and its applications.Â\n\nR-Ladies. R-Ladies is an organization promoting gender diversity in the R community, from package developers, to conference speakers, to educators.Â\n\nKeep learning about R programming with CourseraÂ"
