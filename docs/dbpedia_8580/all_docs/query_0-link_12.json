The popular MPV, xine and VLC media players use it as their main, built-in decoding engine that enables playback of many audio and video formats on all supported platforms. It is also used by the ffdshow tryouts decoder as its primary decoding library. libavcodec is also used in video editing and transcoding applications like Avidemux, MEncoder or Kdenlive for both decoding and encoding.\n\nlibavcodec contains decoder and sometimes encoder implementations of several proprietary formats, including ones for which no public specification has been released. As such, a significant reverse engineering effort is part of libavcodec development. Having such codecs available within the standard libavcodec framework gives a number of benefits over using the original codecs, most notably increased portability, and in some cases also better performance, since libavcodec contains a standard library of highly optimized implementations of common building blocks, such as DCT and color space conversion. However, while libavcodec does strive to achieve decoding that is bit-exact to their official format implementations, occasional bugs and missing features in such re-implementations can sometimes introduce playback compatibility problems for certain files.\n\nImplemented video codecs\n\n[edit]\n\nlibavcodec includes video decoders and/or encoders for the following formats, this list is not exhaustive:[6]\n\nImplemented audio codecs\n\n[edit]\n\nlibavcodec includes decoders and encoders for the following formats:[6]\n\n8SVX (decoding only)\n\nAAC\n\nAC-3\n\nAMR (decoding only)\n\nAMR-WB (decoding only)\n\nApple Lossless\n\nATRAC1, ATRAC3, ATRAC3plus and ATRAC9 (decoding only)\n\nCodec 2\n\nCook Codec (decoding only)\n\nDTS (encoder is highly experimental)\n\nEA ADPCM (decoding only)\n\nE-AC-3\n\nEVRC (decoding only)\n\nFLAC\n\nG.711 (μ-law and A-law)\n\nG.722\n\nG.723.1\n\nG.726\n\nG.729 (decoding only)\n\nGSM 06.10 (native decoder, encoding through libgsm)\n\nIntel Music Coder and Indeo Audio Coder (decoding only)\n\nMeridian Lossless Packing / Dolby TrueHD\n\nMonkey's Audio (decoding only)\n\nMP1 (decoding only)\n\nMP2\n\nMP3 (native decoder, encoding through LAME)\n\nNellymoser Asao Codec in Flash\n\nOpus (native encoder and decoder, encoding through libopus)\n\nQCELP (decoding only)\n\nQDM2 (decoding only)\n\nRealAudio 1.0\n\nRealAudio 2.0 (decoding only)\n\nShorten (decoding only)\n\nTruespeech (decoding only)\n\nTTA\n\nTwinVQ (decoding only)\n\nVorbis\n\nWAV\n\nWavPack\n\nWindows Media Audio 1 and 2\n\nWindows Media Audio 9 Lossless (decoding only)\n\nWindows Media Audio 9 Professional (decoding only)\n\nWindows Media Audio Voice (decoding only)\n\nLegal aspects\n\n[edit]\n\nLibavcodec contains more than 100 codecs,[8] most of which do not just store uncompressed data. Most codecs that compress information could be claimed by patent holders.[9] Such claims may be enforceable in countries like the United States which have implemented software patents, but are considered unenforceable or void in countries that have not implemented software patents.\n\nFurthermore, many of these codecs are only released under terms that forbid reverse engineering, even for purposes of interoperability. These terms of use are forbidden in certain countries. For example, some European Union nations have not implemented software patents and have laws expressly allowing reverse engineering for purposes of interoperability.[10]\n\nLibraries that depend on libavcodec\n\n[edit]\n\nlibavformat (part of FFmpeg)\n\nlibgegl (optional part of GEGL)\n\nlibgimp (part of GIMP)\n\nlibmpcodecs (part of MPlayer)\n\nlibmpdemux (part of MPlayer)\n\nApplications using libavcodec\n\n[edit]\n\nMain category: Software that uses FFmpeg\n\nVideo players\n\n[edit]\n\nFFplay\n\nMPlayer\n\nmpv\n\nMPC-HC and MPC-BE\n\nVLC\n\nxine\n\nAudio players\n\n[edit]\n\nAudacious (Uses in audacious-plugins's ffaudio)\n\nRockbox (Includes only FLAC code)\n\nXMMS2\n\nMultimedia players\n\n[edit]\n\nGnash\n\nMoonlight\n\nswfdec\n\nVideo editors\n\n[edit]\n\nAvidemux\n\nCinelerra\n\nKdenlive\n\nKino\n\nAudio editors\n\n[edit]\n\nAudacity (since 1.3.6)\n\nSoX (optional)\n\nVideo converters\n\n[edit]\n\navconv\n\nFFmpeg\n\nHandBrake\n\nMEncoder\n\nSUPER\n\nVideo libraries\n\n[edit]\n\nGPAC[11]\n\nMedia Lovin' Toolkit\n\nOptical disc authoring\n\n[edit]\n\nK3b\n\nGraphics libraries\n\n[edit]\n\nGEGL\n\nImageMagick\n\n3D graphics editors\n\n[edit]\n\nBlender[12]\n\nVoIP\n\n[edit]\n\nEkiga\n\nQuteCom\n\nLinphone\n\nMultimedia streaming server\n\n[edit]\n\nFFserver\n\nVLC media player\n\nMultimedia frameworks\n\n[edit]\n\nffdshow (wraps libavcodec as a DirectShow filter and adds postprocessing to improve image quality; once installed, it is automatically used by all Windows DirectShow video players, such as Windows Media Player, Media Player Classic, Winamp etc. It also wraps libavcodec as a Video for Windows filter; the framework used by most video editing software.)\n\nLAV Filters\n\nGStreamer via the GStreamer FFmpeg plugin\n\nPerian\n\nBellagio OpenMAX Integration Layer – open-source OpenMAX IL API implementation\n\nComputer vision libraries\n\n[edit]\n\nOpenCV[13]\n\nBrowser\n\n[edit]\n\nGoogle Chrome[14]\n\nMozilla Firefox[15]\n\nMedia center\n\n[edit]\n\nMythTV\n\nPlex\n\nKodi (formerly XBMC)\n\nScreen capture\n\n[edit]\n\nxvidcap[16]\n\nDevice utilities\n\n[edit]\n\nBitPim – utilities for CDMA phones\n\nCCTV\n\n[edit]\n\nZoneMinder – video camera security suite\n\nMotion – video camera security/monitoring program\n\nGames\n\n[edit]\n\nPerformous – music game including singing, band and dance.\n\nStepMania\n\nUltrastar\n\nosu!\n\nOthers\n\n[edit]\n\nCorePlayer\n\nFreeJ\n\nIngex Studio – used by BBC\n\nPulseAudio – includes only resamplers code[17]\n\nSteam digital distribution service"
