        "text": "If youâre a beginner programmer, you might be wondering how to choose a programming language. With so many languages out there, it can be difficult to decide which one is right for you. Weâll discuss the most popular programming languages in 2024, what benefits they offer, and where to start.Â\n\nThis article will discuss the most popular programming languages in 2024 and what benefits they offer. We will also give some tips on how to choose the right language for your needs. So whether youâre a beginner or an experienced programmer, read on to find out which language you should learn first!\n\nWhat Is a Programming Language?\n\nHow to decide which programming language to learn\n\nWhat Are the Most Popular Programming Languages in 2024?\n\nTop Programming Languages for Web Development\n\n#1 â JavaScript\n\nThe Best Programming Language to Learn First\n\nWhatâs the Best Way to Get Started with JavaScript?\n\nGet Started with Coding\n\nWhat Is a Programming Language?\n\nA programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement logic flows and algorithms.\n\nLevels of programming languages\n\nProgramming languages can be categorized by level. These levels relate to the level of abstraction from the machine code that runs on a computer.\n\nLow-level programming language\n\nHigh-level programming language\n\nLow-level languages\n\nA low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computerâs instruction set architecture. Low-level languages are typically used to write system software, such as operating systems and device drivers, or to access hardware devices.\n\nExamples of low-level programming languages include machine code and assembly language.\n\nMachine code is a low-level language. It is the only language that can be directly executed by the computer.\n\nAssembly language is a low-level language. It is a human-readable form of machine code that can be more easily written and understood by programmers.\n\nHowever, it is difficult for humans to read and write machine code. As a result, higher level programming languages were developed that allow humans to write code that is easier for them to read and understand.\n\nHigh-level languages\n\nA high-level language is a programming language that provides abstraction from a computerâs instruction set architecture. High-level languages are typically used to write application software, such as web applications and programs.\n\nExamples of high-level programming languages include JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java.\n\nWhile high-level languages are easier for humans to read and write, they must be translated into machine code before they can be executed by a computer. This translation is typically done by a compiler or an interpreter.\n\nCompilers: A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level language into machine code. The machine code can be directly executed by the computer.\n\nInterpreters: An interpreter is a program that translates and executes source code written in a high-level language. The machine code is not directly executed by the computer.\n\nTypes of programming languages\n\nThere are many different types of programming languages. Some languages are designed for specific purposes, while others are more general-purpose.\n\nExamples of specific-purpose programming languages include:\n\nSQL: SQL is a language used for managing data in databases.\n\nHTML: HTML is a markup language used for creating web pages.\n\nCSS: CSS is a style sheet language used to describe a web pageâs presentation.\n\nExamples of general-purpose programming languages include:\n\nC++: C++ can be used for a variety of purposes, such as system software, application software, and games.\n\nJava: Java is a language that can be used for web applications, mobile applications, and big data.\n\nPython: Python is a versatile language that can be used for things such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development.\n\nWhat is a programming paradigm?\n\nA programming paradigm is a way of thinking about programming. It is a conceptual model that dictates how we should write our code.\n\nThere are many different types of programming languages. Some are more versatile than others and can be used for a variety of purposes. Others are more specialized and are designed for specific tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to learning a programming language, there are different types of programming paradigms that can be followed. These include:\n\nLogic programming\n\nObject-oriented programming Language\n\nScripting programming languages\n\nFunctional programming languages\n\nProcedural programming languages\n\nEach type of paradigm has its own set of benefits and drawbacks. For instance, logic programming is great for solving complex problems, but can be difficult to read and understand. On the other hand, object-oriented programming languages are much easier to read and write, but may not be as powerful when it comes to solving complex problems.\n\nWhile there are many different programming paradigms, most programming languages can be classified as either imperative or declarative.\n\nImperative programming languages are based on the concept of commands. Commands are instructions that tell the computer what to do.\n\nDeclarative programming languages are based on the concept of expressions. Expressions are statements that describe what should be done, but they donât specify how it should be done.\n\nObject-oriented programming\n\nObject-oriented programming is a paradigm that is based on the concept of objects and their interactions. Objects are self-contained units that have data and behavior.\n\nObject-oriented programming languages include C++, Java, and Python.\n\nScripting programming languages\n\nScripting programming languages are high-level languages that are designed for automating tasks. They are typically used to write small programs or scripts.\n\nScripting programming languages include Perl, PHP, and Python.\n\nFunctional programming languages\n\nFunctional programming is a paradigm that is based on the evaluation of functions. Functions are self-contained units of code that take input and produce output.\n\nFunctional programming languages include Haskell and Lisp. JavaScript can also be used as a functional programming language.\n\nProcedural programming languages\n\nProcedural programming focuses on the step-by-step execution of a set of instructions (procedures). Procedures are self-contained units of code that carry out a specific task.\n\nProcedural programming languages include C and Pascal.\n\nLogic programming\n\nLogic programming is a type of programming language that is based on formal logic. It is typically used for artificial intelligence applications.\n\nPrograms written in a logic programming language are sets of logical statements. These statements can be used to deduce new facts or solve problems.\n\nLogic programming languages include Prolog and LISP.\n\nIf you are not sure what type of programming you want to do, you should consider learning a scripting language. Scripting languages like JavaScript are typically easy to learn and can be used for a wide range of tasks.\n\nHow to decide which programming language to learn\n\nTo decide which programming language you want to learn first, you need to think about why you want to learn to program in the first place. Programming is so ubiquitous now that you can use your coding skills in web development, machine learning, game development, automation, and even art.Â\n\nFollow this process to decide which programming language to learn first.Â\n\nStart by answering why you want to learn to code\n\nAre you learning for your career, to build your startup idea, to solve a problem at work, or just for fun? This is the most important step as learning is a big commitment and itâs always good to know why youâre doing it.Â\n\nFind which programming languages are in that path or field\n\nWeb developers mainly use JavaScript, Data Scientists use Python, Game Developers use Unity and C++. If itâs a problem or application youâre building for yourself, then look into the popular technologies that are in that area. Knowing this also helps narrow down which languages are available to consider â thereâs not many front end developers coding with Haskell.\n\nAcknowledge how much time you have and be realistic\n\nThis is one of the most important and often overlooked steps. Committing to a large task with only a few hours to spare each week leads to people giving up on their goals.\n\nA rule of thumb is that your first programming language will take between 3 to 6 months to get to an intermediate skill level. Languages like Python and JavaScript have a shorter learning curve, whereas languages like C++ and Java can be more time consuming.Â\n\nSome of us have more time than others, and if you are very time poor, you might want to look at different ways to achieve your outcome. For example, if your end goal is to run your own simple website, instead of learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you could look at alternative approaches like building it with a no-code website builder, find a programmer friend who can help, or hiring a freelancer instead.\n\nIt is also important to consider any deadlines you have and whether you have time to learn.Â\n\nDonât stressÂ\n\nLearning your first language is more about developing your thinking processes rather than the code itself. Many languages have different ways to say the same thing, which means once you know how functions and loops work, then youâll be able to learn how to write it in many languages much faster than you did the first time.Â\n\nWhat Are the Most Popular Programming Languages in 2023?\n\nAccording to the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, the most popular programming technologies amongst professional devlopers are:\n\nJavaScript\n\nHTML and CSS\n\nSQL\n\nPython\n\nTypeScript\n\nBash/Shell\n\nJava\n\nC#\n\nC++\n\nPHP\n\nC\n\nGo\n\nPowerShell\n\nRust\n\nKotlin\n\nRuby\n\nDart\n\nLua\n\nSwift\n\nAssembly\n\nEach of these languages has different benefits that make them well-suited for different purposes. To choose the right language for your needs, you should consider what you want to use the language for.\n\nIf youâre interested in web development, then JavaScript or PHP might be a good choice. Python might be a good choice if youâre interested in data science or machine learning. If youâre interested in game development, then C++ might be the one for you. And if youâre looking for a versatile language that can be used for a variety of applications, then C# is worth a look.\n\nNo matter what your goals are, thereâs a language out there thatâs perfect for you. So donât be afraid to experiment and find the one that fits your needs.\n\nTop Programming Languages for Web Development\n\nNow that weâve gone over the different types of programming languages, letâs take a look at some specific languages.\n\nWeb development is one of the most popular types of programming. If youâre a developer in 2024, chances are high that youâre a web developer.\n\nThere are a number of different languages that are commonly used for web development. In 2024, we think itâs smart to pick a first language that you can put to use in the browser, and our recommendations are informed by this philosophy.\n\nJavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world for web development, and itâs one of the easiest to learn. Itâs also one of the few languages that can be used on both the front-end and back-end of web development. Popular frameworks like React, Vue and Node.js are written in JavaScript and itâs safe to assume that if you want to be a web developer, you will need to use JavaScript eventually.Â\n\nIf you already know that you want your focus to be web development in 2024, JavaScript should be your first language.\n\nPros of JavaScript\n\nItâs popular, so there are a lot of resources and community support.\n\nItâs easy to learn for beginners.\n\nIt can be used on both the front-end and back-end of web development.\n\nItâs perfect for someone who wants to be a front end developer as popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte use JavaScript.Â\n\nCons of JavaScript\n\nItâs not always easy to debug code because itâs not a compiled language, and as it doesnât have strict types, errors such as type errors and undefined variables can be tricky to spot (TypeScript addresses these concerns by offering strict types)\n\nThe syntax can be confusing to interpret at first (compared to languages like Python that are designed to look more like natural languages).\n\nPython\n\nPython is another language thatâs used for web development and itâs a heavyweight like JavaScript in terms of popularity. In fact, it is the most widely used programming language in the world. Itâs a versatile scripting language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from web development, automating tasks, and machine learning.Â\n\nDespite its popularity, Python is not as prevalent as JavaScript in the web development scene. Your web browser cannot run Python code like it can with JavaScript. PyScript is trying to change that, but for now if you want to build a front end web application or website, you may have to stick to JavaScript.Â\n\nPython is an extremely powerful language for creating APIs, backend services, data engineering and other aspects of web development. We still highly recommend this as a programming language for anyone to learn.Â\n\nPython is a great language to learn if youâre interested in pursuing a career in web development or data science.\n\nPros of Python:\n\nIt has a clear and concise syntax.\n\nItâs easy to learn for beginners.\n\nIt has a wide range of applications.\n\nCons of Python:\n\nItâs not as fast as some other languages.\n\nIt has a limited number of web development frameworks.\n\nWhere to start:Â\n\nThe Python team has compiled a great list of Python learning resources with many free options.Â\n\nStart your Journey on SitePoint with Python Apprentice, Journeyman and Master.Â\n\nPHP\n\nPHP is a popular scripting language that is used for web development.
