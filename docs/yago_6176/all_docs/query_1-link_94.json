        "text": "Dudley Moore's ex-wife Nicole Rothschild has been told to stay away from his funeral.\n\nAnd even their son Nicholas, now seven, has been told he will not be welcome at Tuesday's service.\n\nDudley and Nicole fought a bitter custody battle over Nicholas when they split in 1997 - the year the comic was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy.\n\nIn court, she claimed the star flittered away thousands of pounds on prostitutes and drugs every month.\n\nTheir marriage ­ Dudley's fourth ­ was always turbulent, and the 5ft 2in star was once arrested for allegedly abusing her.\n\nAfter their divorce Dudley had little contact with Nicole, now 37.\n\nHis funeral is being arranged by Rena Fruchter, who nursed him through his illness at her home in New Jersey, until his death from pneumonia on Wednesday.\n\nThe Sun newspaper quotes a source saying: \"Dudley's friends believe it would be wrong for Nicole to be at the funeral.\n\n\"She had no relationship with Dudley when he died. Rena feels it wouldn't be right for Nicole and Nicholas to be there.\"\n\nDudley leaves another son, Patrick, from his second wife, actress Tuesday Weld.\n\nObituary/biography\n\nImage is from the cover of Dudley Moore: The Authorised Biography\n\nPublished: 30 Mar 2002"
