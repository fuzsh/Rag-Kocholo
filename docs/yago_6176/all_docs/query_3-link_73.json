Patrick lives in New York with his mother, Moore's ex-wife Tuesday Weld, while Moore stays on the opposite coast where he has a three-year relationship with 6-foot Susan Anton.\n\n'I'm not a great father,' Moore told Glamour magazine in an article to hit the stands Jan. 18, 'but I have a wonderful relationship with my son even though I don't see him much.' Moore added, 'When he gets older we will become more like pals. I find it difficult to relate to him as a child ... I'm not fascinated by tiny children. I'm fascinated by someone I can talk to.'"
