        "text": "Tuesday Weld, born as Susan Ker Weld, had one of the most difficult childhoods. Her story seems like a tragic one, despite not being recognized as so in Hollywood. In fact, it is not given much thought, such as stories of actresses like Judy Garland. Either way, the pressure that was put on her as a child affected her acting career since she turned down several movies that would have made her even more popular.\n\nBeing an actress meant that she was exposed to a lot of pressure from the industry. However, the pressure seemed to double for her because her mother, Yosene Balfour Ker, pushed her to do so much than she should have. She had to start working very early in life, and it seemed as though she had no choice in the decisions.\n\nTuesday Weld profile summary\n\nReal name: Susan Ker Weld\n\nNickname: Tuesday Weld\n\nDate of birth: 27.08.1943\n\nAge: 76 years\n\nPlace of birth: New York City, New York, USA\n\nNationality: American\n\nZodiac sign: Virgo\n\nProfession: Actress, former model, and singer\n\nTuesday Weld age and early life\n\nHow old is Tuesday Weld? Having been born on 27.08.1943, the actress is currently 76 years old. She is one of the many actresses that got into showbiz at an early age. She had to suffer the pressure of the industry, making her turn to illegal essences at an early age. While her story is not considered tragic, as many other actors' stories have, she still knows what it means to be one carrying a lot on her shoulders.\n\nHer father, Lathrop Motley Weld, passed on when she was just 4 years old. While it is true that she would have had an easy time growing up if her mother had chosen to give her kids up to her husband's parents, she could not do it. The demand never to see her kids again refrained her from making such a decision. Her mother was an orphan from London. She moved to America, where she met Tuesday's privileged father. When he died, she had no choice but to push her daughter into modeling as a way of supporting her family. Tuesday Weld hot body made it possible for her to find success in this field quickly.\n\nShe quickly became a successful child model and went on to pose for advertisements and mail-order catalogs. Due to her work and the burden of responsibility that started too early, she was estranged from her mother, Yosene, and her two elder siblings. She was forced to be the teen girl that got into adulthood before she was ready.\n\nActing career\n\nHaving been forced to move into the modeling industry, Weld's mother did not stop at that. By the time she turned 12 years old, Weld debuted on her acting career. She was given a role in Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s movie The Wrong Man. Unfortunately for her, the pressure of the limelight was already overwhelming her. By the time she was 9 years old, she already suffered from a nervous breakdown. By the time she was 12 years old, she was already addicted to alcohol. In fact, she is believed to have attempted taking her life.\n\nThe pressure of having to take care of her mother and family was too much on her. Her mother seemed to push her too hard, even though she loved her so much. It appears as though a lot about her career got to her. Later in life, she turned down a lot of roles in movies that were to make it huge. She seemed to avoid such potential big hits for the mere reason that they would be popular.\n\nWhat she suffered as a kid may have contributed to her choices as an adult actress. She only accepted roles in movies that were not a big deal. Furthermore, her roles were not very significant. A good example would be the role she played in Falling Down. She acted as a nagging wife with neurotic tendencies. She would disturb her husband with a lot of needless concerns. In fact, her role would be removed, and no one would notice the difference.\n\nHer film debut was in 1956. She starred in a low-budget exploitation movie titled Rock Rock Rock! In fact, she became well-known for it. It is this same movie that pushed and convinced her about acting as a full-time career. Afterward, she appeared on TV in New York. It was later that she decided to go to Hollywood in 1958. From then, she appeared as part of the cast of Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys! in 1958. It became her first breakthrough and was important in catapulting her career.\n\nOver time, she became one of Hollywood's teen queens. She played mainly precocious roles. She also led a wild private life that added to the entertainment of her fans. She was favored by critics who acknowledged her talent and directors who approved of her professionalism. By the time it was the late 1960s, she was able to outgrow her child/teenage image and find more demanding roles. She had been known for her sweet-16 roles for about 16 years.\n\nHowever, Tuesday Weld did not achieve first-magnitude stardom as many people would have expected. It may have had something to do with luck, but her selection of jobs could have contributed to this. She is said to have turned down Bonnie and Clyde in 1967, True Grit in 1969, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice in 1969. It has been described as her independence-loving mind, which made her shrink back from the restraints of superstardom instinctively.\n\nDespite shying away from great hits, she kept on performing well in films that did not receive much flair or success. From the mid-'70s onwards, she focused on made-for-TV movies. This may have been considered ironic considering the fact that she was once Hollywood's sweetheart. Her role in Once Upon a Time in America in 1984, and the most successful film, Falling Down in 1993 made her a big darling on the big screen.\n\nTuesday Weld movies\n\nActress Tuesday Weld is a brilliant actress.
