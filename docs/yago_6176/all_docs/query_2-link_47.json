        "text": "Yellow and black flowers arranged in the shape of a keyboard were among the tributes - a reference to Moore's love of playing the piano and his great musical talent.\n\nThe actor revealed his illness to the public in 1999, following claims his slurred speech and impaired work were connected to drug use.\n\nHe said: \"I am trapped in this body and there is nothing I can do about it.\"\n\nMoore, a father-of-two, had four turbulent marriages - all of which ended in divorce.\n\n'Lovely man'\n\nFollowing his death friends and colleagues remembered Moore fondly.\n\nChat show host Michael Parkinson remembered the comedian as \"a superb musician, a bloody good comedian and a lovely man\".\n\nLiza Minnelli, Moore's co-star in the hit movie Arthur, said: \"He was a wonderful man. He was funny and dear and supportive and hilarious and he was one of my heroes.\"\n\nJazz singer Dame Cleo Laine, who knew the comedian, actor and musician for almost 40 years, said: \"In lots of ways it's a release for him. He had to be fed and washed and looked after like a baby.\""
