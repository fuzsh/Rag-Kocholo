Dudley Moore's ex-wife Nicole Rothschild has been told to stay away from his funeral.

And even their son Nicholas, now seven, has been told he will not be welcome at Tuesday's service.

Dudley and Nicole fought a bitter custody battle over Nicholas when they split in 1997 - the year the comic was diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy.

In court, she claimed the star flittered away thousands of pounds on prostitutes and drugs every month.

Their marriage ­ Dudley's fourth ­ was always turbulent, and the 5ft 2in star was once arrested for allegedly abusing her.

After their divorce Dudley had little contact with Nicole, now 37.

His funeral is being arranged by Rena Fruchter, who nursed him through his illness at her home in New Jersey, until his death from pneumonia on Wednesday.

The Sun newspaper quotes a source saying: "Dudley's friends believe it would be wrong for Nicole to be at the funeral.

"She had no relationship with Dudley when he died. Rena feels it wouldn't be right for Nicole and Nicholas to be there."

Dudley leaves another son, Patrick, from his second wife, actress Tuesday Weld.
