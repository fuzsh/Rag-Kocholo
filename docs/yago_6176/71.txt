Entertainer Dudley Moore’s wife filed for divorce Thursday after nearly 2 1/2 years of marriage, court documents showed.

The Superior Court divorce suit filed by actress-model Brogan Lane Moore said the couple separated July 15. They had no children.

The couple was married Feb. 21, 1988, in a 10-minute ceremony at the Little Church of the West at the Hacienda Hotel-Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

Lane, at the time of the marriage, listed her age on Nevada marriage documents as 32. Moore is 55.

When they were married, Moore said he selected the Las Vegas wedding chapel at the suggestion of his friend and “Arthur” co-star Liza Minnelli, whose mother Judy Garland was once married at the chapel.

Arriving first for the ceremony, Moore, who stands 5-feet-2, played classical music on the chapel organ until his bride, arrived.

The petition for divorce cited irreconcilable differences, and asked that property rights be determined by the court. Brogan Moore said in the court papers that she was “unaware of the exact nature, extent or value” of the couple’s property or debts.

Moore was previously married to actresses Suzy Kendall and Tuesday Weld.
