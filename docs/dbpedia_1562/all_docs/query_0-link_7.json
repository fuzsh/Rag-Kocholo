I can even say that I am not comfortable with such work. With the help of the instructions, I succeeded, the participants got the survey. I was very happy that 1KA is available and that it is so easy to use that even people with less knowledge and experience can make the basic surveys.\"\n\nŽiva Novak Antolič, Medical Trainers, FIC, PRIZMA Project\n\n\"Very easy to use even for first time users.\"\n\nA.D., Wcycle Institute\n\n\"Simple and transparent to use, I was also able to easily edit it.\"\n\nU.Č., Faculty of Applied Social Studies, Nova Gorica\n\nMay 2021\n\n\"Easy navigation, everything is straightforward.\"\n\nTseko Mofokeng\n\n\"A fast and efficient way of creating a survey and obtaining, collecting, and analyzing data.\"\n\nN.K., Kindergarten Studenci Maribor\n\n\"1KA is the perfect tool for creating a business survey.

However, if you have problems making the survey, you can turn to several help manuals provided by 1KA. If I have to make a survey in the future, I will most likely use the 1KA survey tool again.

S., Gymnasium Ptuj\n\nFebruary 2021\n\n\"I was looking for a free online survey site that allows me to use a particular type of visual analog scale for it to be used by the students I supervise. This site is not only the single one I have found that does that for free, it does a lot of things brilliantly. It does offer an incredible number of configuration options for each form, down to the slightest detail. Yet it is very intuitive and extremely easy to use: though I only watched the very short youtube explanatory video on how to get started, I was able to configure everything the way I wanted for my surveys, which include many different form (question) types. It has a great visual rendering and reliable online presence. All in all, I do recommend this survey site over the ones we usually make use of. To be totally honest, I only used the free features and they do allow for a lot of things already. I have also perused through the paid features and they seem even better. Given the price of the paid options packages, they are, in my opinion, totally worth it (I will use them myself when needed.\"\n\nSerban C.

I use it both privately (in my own research) and for business (mostly with user satisfaction evaluations). It is simple, functional, with excellent customer support, and also in Slovene, which represents an important advantage over other, foreign providers. I recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable tool to conduct online research, without unnecessary complications.\"\n\ndr. Jana Nadoh Bergoč, Perspektiva Business Incubator\n\nJanuary 2021\n\n\"I used the 1KA to create a survey for a project at my university. I went in with no prior knowledge on how to use 1KA tool, and I managed to figure everything out very quickly because of the simplicity of the interface and the logic behind the tools. The questions I had during the use were listed in Q&A. I found it very useful that you can restrict the range and the type of answers in preventing invalid input.
