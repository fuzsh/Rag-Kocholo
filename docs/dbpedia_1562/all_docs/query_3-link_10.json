territory to the tides of history. It has always been a place of transition, a borderland and a crossroads, but also a bridge between different cultures, people, nations and states. Although small in size – the modern Slovene state measures just 20,000 km2 – four major European geographical regions meet in its territory: the Alps, which cover the north-west, the Pannonian Plain, also known as the Great Hungarian Plain, to the east, the Dinaric Alps, known also by the ancient toponym of the Karst (Kras), which covers the southern part of Slovene territory, and the Mediterranean, which, as the Adriatic, makes its most northerly encroachment into continental central Europe in the Gulf of Trieste. The geography of Slovene territory has also made it a European transport hub. According to geographers, along the entire stretch of the Mediterranean basin from southern France to Istanbul, the most convenient, shortest and easiest route across the imposing ring of mountains, from the Alps and Dinarics to the Balkan Mountains that hem it in to the north, passes through Slovene territory. This is where the Pannonian Plain reaches its closest point to the Mediterranean, and the highest Karst passes between Ljubljana and Trieste lie no higher than 600 m above sea level for a radius of 30 km in the Postojna or Adriatic Gate, also known as the Italo-Illyrian Gate. All traffic heading towards Italy and the Mediterranean from the western Balkans, Pannonian Plain, eastern Alps and the Czech territories passes through Slovene territory. Two historical witnesses to the geopolitical importance of Slovene territory are the Amber Road, which linked the Baltic coast to the northern Adriatic, and the legend of the Argonauts, in which Jason’s band of sailors travel along the Danube, Sava and Ljubljanica rivers to Nauportus (Vrhnika), where they dismantle their ship and carry it over the Karst to the Adriatic Sea, before sailing back to Greece. The convenient Karst passes reach towards Italy along the 40-km Vipava valley, which stretches from the Soča (It. Isonzo) river into the mountainous continental interior, opening a path towards rich northern Italy for those arriving from the east. At the end of the eighth century, Paul the Deacon, historian of the Lombards, wrote that all Italy is “surrounded by the waves of the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas, but to the west and north it is so closed in by the Alps that there is no entrance to it, save via narrow passes and over the lofty summits of the mountains. Yet from the eastern side, where it is joined to Pannonia, it has an approach that lies open, broad and quite level.” The Romans were well aware of the strategic importance of this territory to the defence of Italy’s most vulnerable border, through which numerous tribes, peoples and armies entered the Italian 7\n\npeninsula throughout history, and they built a special defensive system, the claustra Alpium Iuliarum, creating a network of important roads spreading out from Aquileia towards the central Danube region, Pannonia, and western Illyricum. Slovene territory is not just the meeting point of geographic elements, but also a point at which different cultures have overlapped: horse people from the eastern Steppes and barbarians from the west, north and east of Europe; Slavs, Germans, Romans and Finno-Ugric Hungarians; the western European Empire and Byzantium from the east. It has long been a place of immigrant mobility and indigenous tenacity. This great diversity has left its mark on this small territory, and has been preserved as part of the region’s rich history and tradition. This is the invaluable heritage of the Slovene territory, which should be recognised, cared for, and preserved for future generations. The history of a territory and its inhabitants – and this applies very much to this work – cannot simply be reduced to the history of one nation, particularly if, like the vast majority of European nations, it only coalesced as a political nation in the nineteenth century. Of course, this is by no means a uniquely Slovene problem. Elsewhere in Europe, historians talk of countries and nations in periods when neither had yet come into being. When the French talk of their first dynasty, they are likely to be thinking of the Frankish Merovingians. Equally, German and Austrian works on their own lands in the Early Middle Ages are often anachronistic, creating an image of something that never existed politically. So, just as it would be out of place to speak of Ljudevit Posavski (Louis, prince of Lower Pannonia) as a Croat prince, it would also be misleading to refer to Carantanian prince Borut as a Slovene prince and Carantania as the first Slovene state. At that time, the inhabitants of part of the later Slovene ethnic territory were only identified as Carantanians, or at best as Slavs. Slovenia and Slovenes have not always existed and using these two terms to describe the Early Middle Ages is an attempt to exploit the past to benefit current interests and ideas. One such idea is the assertion found in all the Slovene history textbooks that Slovenes settled in an area stretching north to the Danube, and that a process of Germanisation led to them losing two-thirds of their national territory. Yet this approach always neglects to provide any grounds for the claim that the Slavs living along the Danube in the Early Middle Ages were Slovenes. A history of the Slovenes therefore only relates to recent centuries, but that does not mean that Slovene history, understood as the history of the land where present-day Slovenia is located and its people, is any the less for this distinction, only that it has been more accurately defined. To discuss only the history of Slovenes or the history of the Slovene nation – as the titles of previous histories have implied, though fortunately their content has been broader – 8\n\nstrictly understood would mean nothing less than renouncing part of the Slovenes’ own history. It would mean, for example, disregarding the noble dynasties from elsewhere that made the territory their homeland, and who did so much for its progress and prosperity. It would mean ignoring the many western European monks who culturally and spiritually enriched the region and whose codices Slovenes are today so proud of. It would also mean renouncing the celebrated polymath, Johann Wiechard Valvasor, an Italian by origin, and discounting an important section of the burgher class and culture, as well as all those who lived here but who were not linguistically or ethnically defined as Slovenes. There is no reason for renouncing or disregarding this heritage, so the best approach may well be to present things as they were, and to give them their correct names.\n\nFROM PREHISTORIC CULTURE TO CIVILISATION The prehistoric period in Slovene territory is characterised by a wealth of archaeological culture and social manifestations. This is due to the variety of geographical and landscape types in the lands between the Alps and the Adriatic Sea, and between the Pannonian Plain and Venetia. These differences were particularly noticeable in the most ancient eras, when people were so much more dependent on their natural environment. The archaeological material bears witness to the fact that the majority of known cultures occupying this territory until the Early Iron Age (around the eighth century BC), when the first clear elements of material and spiritual culture are found, were on the periphery of most migratory and cultural centres in the Danube and Adriatic regions. The incorporation of present Slovene territory into the Roman world was a historical turning point, comparable to its inclusion in Carolingian western Europe almost a millennium later. Slovene territory became part of the then civilised world, incorporated into a state with developed and regulated public life and a state apparatus. The Roman Empire, which later provided the model and political programme for numerous medieval kings and emperors, was very much a supra-regional political formation, into which local identities were subsumed. The earliest signs of human activity in Slovene territory, the two stone tools from the Jama v Lozi site near Orehek, reach back around 250,000 years, the Lower Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age), although one can only begin to speak of Ice Age human culture and settlement in the Middle Palaeolithic, when Neanderthals moved across Europe. Evidence of the presence of this ‘Mousterian culture’ has been discovered in over 15 sites in present-day Slovenia. The remains of a human who lived at that time were discovered near Krapina, in the Croatian region of Zagorje. The Postojna and Pivka Karst and the Soča (Isonzo) river basin, with its 9\n\nmany caves (the most archaeologically important being Betalov Spodmol and Divje Babe, source of the oldest musical instrument ever found, a 40,000-year-old flute) was the first part of the region that was significantly settled by prehistoric humans. Settlement was even more intense in the Upper Palaeolithic. Modern humans came to the fore, completely displacing Neanderthals. The temperate climate in a warm interglacial period lasting over 10,000 years saw them settle Alpine highlands that had previously been icebound and inaccessible to the animals they pursued for food. Evidence for this was found at the most important site from this period in present-day Slovenia, the Potočka Zijalka cave on Olševa, a mountain in the eastern Savinja Alps, 1,700 m above sea level. The cave has lent its name to the entire Upper Palaeolithic culture in the eastern Alps, which is known as ‘Olševien’. The site has been dated to between 45,000 and 32,000 BC. Excavations found numerous stone tools and over 100 bone artefacts, mainly pointed, with a bone needle and simple flute among the most significant finds. Bone tools appearing alongside stone tools indicate that the society was undergoing major changes in its economics and its life. Humans did not just pursue wild animals but became hunters; the needle indicates mastery of sewing (clothing, coverings, bags), which also significantly improved life. The flutes and simple, ornamental carving in numerous bones represent the first signs of human art found in Slovene territory. The last glacial period, the most severe of all, brought the flowering of the Olševien culture to an end. After the Mesolithic or Middle Stone Age period, for which sites are low in number and poorly researched, indicating significant gaps and a decline in the material and spiritual culture in prehistoric development in Slovene lands, a significant transformation occurred in the Neolithic or New Stone Age, which is dated between the fifth and second millennia BC. While in Palaeolithic times humans lived exclusively from hunting and gathering, in the Neolithic growing crops and rearing domesticated animals came to the fore. At that time, people used grinding techniques to achieve a highly-finished stone, which remained the main source of tools for chopping and cutting. They also invented pottery, simple methods for making fire and boring stone, looms for weaving fibres, and the bow and arrow. The economic change that enabled people to stop continually following their prey and to create settlements also led to major changes in the social structure. Demographic growth occurred, and new divisions of labour, and the first forms of social stratification, probably began to appear. The start of husbandry and agriculture in the Neolithic laid the long-term foundations for human development, and the subsequent complex forms of human society. The major centre of Neolithic development in Slovene territory was the Triestine Karst. The archaeological material, mainly from cave sites, represents three separate and 10\n\nsuccessive Neolithic cultures from the Mediterranean region, known as the ‘Impresso’, ‘Danilo’ and ‘Hvar’ cultures. Neolithic remains from present-day central and eastern Slovenia present a significant contrast to the Karstic world: settlements, largely on the plain, were connected to the ‘Lengyel’ culture of the central Danube region. Most Neolithic sites in continental Slovenia are from the Late Neolithic, such as the settlement at Rifnik above Šentjur by Celje, which was inhabited almost continually until the Early Middle Ages. The Resnikov Prekop settlement near Ig, which dated back to this time, was a forebear of the specific pile-dwelling culture of the Ljubljana Barje marshlands, which reached its peak in the Copper Age (Aeneolithic). The group of over 15 pile-dwelling settlements on the Ljubljana marshlands is of note because of its complexity and rich material culture, and is one of the most interesting Copper Age sites in this part of Europe. The building of durable pile dwellings tied humans to a specific area, to which they also adapted their economy. Pollen analysis indicates the existence of tilled land, pastures and meadows on the edge of the marshlands. Livestock were an important part of the marsh-dwellers’ economy, with hunting and fishing also playing a major role. The first metal to be used in Slovene territory appeared at this time: copper. Copper tools, which the marsh-dwellers produced themselves and which originally copied their stone precursors, soon became far more diverse, improving the quality of timber production, as is seen in the later pile dwellings. Ceramic production was also high quality, finding expression in votive statuettes. The schematic, flat-bodied female idols have a distinctive ‘violin-box’ form, an emphasis in great contrast with the previous conception of the female figure, which also reflected a change in spiritual content. Evidence of social changes can also be observed. The previous social and clan connections grew weaker in a pile-dwelling culture where each family had its own house, with closer blood ties and nuclear family loyalty being strengthened. This more fractured lifestyle, with separate buildings for individual community cells, led to the introduction of new, previously unknown norms of behaviour to inter-family and community relations. With the exception of the Late Bronze Age and the so-called Urnfield culture, in terms of settlement the Bronze Age, which covers the second millennium BC, is a less important period in the history of the Slovene territory. It could also be seen as a time of stagnation, with reduced settlement leading to demographic decline. The disappearance of ceramic ornaments from the records at this time also indicates a possible spiritual crisis. Of course, this was also the period in which bronze, an alloy of copper and tin that is much more useful than copper due to its hardness, arrived in Slovene territory. The new material saw the introduction of new 11\n\nforms – broad axes, swords and daggers – that could never have been made from stone. People could shape bronze to form weapons deliberately designed to kill their animal prey and human rivals. Taken together with arrows, belt buckles and fasteners, these new products support the idea that horsemen were already taking their place in military formations. The concept of warriors as a new social stratum can be traced back to the Copper Age, when the first clear distinctions between weapons and tools appeared. The fear of enemies with new and more potent weapons forced groups to build fortified shelters and dwellings. These fears were behind the kaštel culture (kašteli (from Lat. castellum) were small settlements, fortified to some degree, and also protected by their location) on the Karst plateau and in Istria, and the high-altitude settlements in the centre and east of present-day Slovenia during the Middle Bronze Age. The fortified kašteli created an inhabited landscape still recognisable in Istria today, and high-altitude settlements – often in the same locations – were the typical form of settlement in Slovene territory in Late Antiquity. The Late Bronze Age, from the thirteenth to eighth century BC, is characterised by the Urnfield culture, named after the custom of cremating the dead and burying them in urns in fields. The cremation of the dead constitutes a significant difference from the previous custom of skeletal remains under barrows, which can only be a response to the significant social, spiritual and cultural changes that people of that time were going through. Cremation, in which the body loses its material essence, renders people of different status equal after death, and suggests a higher value being placed on the soul than the body. The addition of grave gifts indicates a belief in the immortality of the deceased’s soul. Funeral rituals in the Urnfield culture must be understood as a response to fundamental changes in the social and cultural basis of society. The great changes relating to the appearance of the supra-regional Urnfield culture (which covered large areas of Europe) can at least in part be explained by the arrival of new tribes, and new ethnic identities acting as the bearers of new material and spiritual culture. In Slovene territory, they were largely linked to the (proto-) Illyrians and Veneti, but it is not possible to provide a clear ethnic definition of the Urnfield culture. The bearers of this culture mastered a technique to forge sheet bronze. This allowed them to make objects that casting could not produce. Defensive military equipment, such as breastplates, shields and helmets, the concepts for which came from the Aegean, were the direct result of new knowledge and a means of demonstrating prestige and social status. The production of bronze products was on a mass scale at this time, as evidenced by depot sites such as the Mušja Jama cave near Škocijan (which probably had a cultish significance) with over 200 spear points, 20 axes, 12 swords, at least 6 helmets, knives, sickles and pieces of bronze sheet, all of which 12\n\ntypify the earlier period of Urnfield culture in Slovene territory. Ceramic production was also on a much larger scale and of better quality than in the Early and Middle Bronze Age. The number of archaeological sites from the period reflects the increased settlement and gradual expansion of cultivated land (cultural landscapes) due to crops and domestic animals. By the subsequent period, the Early Iron Age, this increase had already formed, in some parts of present-day Slovenia, the pattern of settlement and cultivation that the Slavs were to inherit on their arrival in the region. The Early Iron Age (or Halstatt period) lasted from the eighth to the fourth century BC in Slovene territory, which is somewhat longer than in the rest of central Europe. The start of this period represents a major cut-off point in European prehistory, linked to the incursion of Thraco-Cimmerians into the Pannonian Plain. This led to the rise of a new metal, iron, brought from Asia Minor and accepted into the ‘Halstatt’ culture in central Europe, in which Slovene territory held a special place. The archaeological map of Halstatt sites indicates that the centre of settlement moved during that period from the two main river valley systems, the Sava and Drava and their tributaries, to the pre-Alpine highlands. The number of inhabitants increased with the arrival of new settlers, and settlement types also underwent a change. The high-altitude forts became more established, some of which, such as Stična, can already be described as ‘proto-urban’ agglomerations, which played the role of political, craft and trading centres. The forts were home to larger communities. Society at the height (sixth and fifth centuries BC) of the Halstatt period in Slovene territory, defined as a ‘prince-led’ society or culture, was characterised by a pyramid social structure with a princely (warrior) aristocracy at the head and a series of clients at lower levels. A new grave ritual appeared. The main feature of this was skeletal burial in family barrows, though this is neither general nor uniform throughout the Slovene territory. In the Soča (Isonzo) river basin, non-tumulus burials of cremated ashes in urns predominated. The social changes largely depended on the influx of iron, mastering the technology to work it to make tools, weapons and jewellery. In contrast to bronze, iron ore did not need to be imported, but was accessible from daily excavations, which enabled the development of domestic metallurgy. Related craft skills were particularly pronounced in Slovene territory, for example in the production of metal vessels, among which situlae are significant due to the figurative decorations they frequently feature. Situla art is characteristic of the Halstatt culture in Slovene territory. In the classic and most developed form, represented in famous situla from Vače (a place in the centre of present-day Slovenia), reached the Halstatt culture its highest artistic expression. Defensive weapons also display a characteristic form: breastplates, shields and particularly helmets, which were produced in 13\n\nvaried, clearly chronologically-defined forms; significant amounts of horse tack were received from Thraco-Cimmerian and later Scythian circles. These briefly described characteristics sketch out the core features of Halstatt culture in Slovene territory, yet if looked at in greater detail, they hide significant differences within their features, particularly regarding the burial method. Halstatt culture in the wider Slovene territory can be divided into six regional groups: Dolenjska (Lower Carniola), Notranjska (Inner Carniola), Štajerska (Styria), Koroška (Carinthia), Istria and the Sveta Lucija (St. Lucia, present-day Most na Soči) group. The Dolenjska group, the most densely settled, is the most visible and most typically representative of the southeast Halstatt culture. The question of the ethnic affiliation of the bearers of Halstatt culture on Slovenian lands is complex and remains largely open. The numerous new forts that appeared at the start of the Halstatt period were planned on a large scale – as seen at Stična in Dolenjska – which indicates a strong influx of a new population that was culturally varied. The Dolenjska Halstatt group was Illyrian, a definition based on a connection with Glasinac and the associated cultural group in the central Balkan region, although the Balkan region was by no means culturally uniform in terms of the settlement of Illyrian tribes, and there were large differences between central and western parts. The west of present-day Slovenia was more closely connected with the latter. The close links with the northern Italian area (Este) means that one can also speak of a Veneti component in the ethnic makeup of the St. Lucija (Most na Soči) group; other Slovene Halstatt groups are ethnically more difficult to identify. Without doubt, the Slovene territory reached the peak of its prehistoric development in the Early Iron Age, when otherwise rare and original features of material and spiritual culture were to be found in the region. Archaeologically, the Late Iron Age is largely associated with the Celtic culture known as ‘La Tene’, which lasted for the final three centuries BC in Slovene territory and marked the transition from prehistory to the historical period. This period produces the first written sources, literary and epigraphic, to throw significant light on the historical picture, and the first known ‘state’ formation of tribes in the eastern Alpine region. Judging by literary sources, the area was subject to the wide Celtic migration that took place from the fourth century BC, which extended well into the south of the Balkan peninsula, and even into Asia Minor. The best known of the numerous Celtic tribes in the Alpine-Danube region was the Norici. They established the first organised state in the eastern Alpine region in the last third of the second century BC, the Norican kingdom (Regnum Noricum), which consisted of a number of tribes including the Taurisci, Latobici and Ambisontes, who inhabited present-day Slovene territory. The question of whether the Norican kingdom was created by a union of 14\n\nequal tribes under their own princes or kings, whose names appear on coins, or whether the Norici and their king held hegemony over the other tribes in the region remains unanswered. The kingdom’s capital was perhaps a settlement excavated at Magdalensberg near Zollfeld in Carinthia. This was the first acknowledgement, later confirmed on many occasions, of the importance of the central Carinthian space for various politically organised states in the eastern Alpine region – from the Roman province of Noricum to the Slavic principality of Carantania and the Duchy of Carinthia. Celeia (Celje) was another centre of the kingdom of Noricum and in the first century BC home to a mint for silver Noric coins. The Romans established good economic and political relations with the Celtic tribes of the Norican kingdom very early on. It is likely that Rome offered Noricum the status of public hospitality (hospitium publicum) as early as 170 BC. Noric steel (ferrum Noricum) from the region was highly prized throughout Italy, and was generally controlled by traders from Aquileia. The Romans founded this important trading centre in present-day northeastern Italy in 181 BC, in response to an unsuccessful attempt in 186 BC by one of the Celtic tribes to occupy the territory later known as Friuli, which the Romans considered as falling within their own sphere of interest: this was, approximately, to define Italy’s political border to the east from that time onward. However, Slovene territory in the Late Iron Age was not completely occupied by Celts. The Taurisci and somewhat later the Latobici had an impact on the former Halstatt cultural centres of Dolenjska, Štajerska and Koroška (the settlement area of the Latobici is particularly well documented in the names of two Roman settlements: Municipium Flavium Latobicorum Neviodunum (Drnovo pri Krškem) and Praetorium Latobicorum (Trebnje) in northeastern Dolenjska), but not those in Notranjska, the Soča river basin, and Bela Krajina. Archaeological material and written sources indicate that these were home to the Japodi and Carni tribes. Excavations at Stična have shown that a large indigenous population of Illyrians remained in Dolenjska. Roman encroachment into the territory of the Celtic and Illyrian tribes started in the second century BC. Soon after the founding of Aquileia, the Romans expanded their influence to Istria and its inhabitants, the Histri. The First Pannonian War took place in the 150s BC, and the Second Pannonian War in 119 BC. In 129 BC the Taurisci were defeated, in 115 BC the Carni, but in 113 BC the Roman army was defeated in battle near the as-yet-unlocated Noreia by the Germanic tribes, the Cimbri and Teutons, who had invaded the eastern Alpine Noric lands. The main phase of incorporating the eastern Alpine and northwestern Balkan region into the Roman state followed in the final decades BC, when, from 35 to 33 BC, Rome 15\n\nsubjugated the Delmatae, Pannonii and Japodi, extending its border far to the east. The area up to the central Danube region was only fully incorporated into the Roman state after the Pannonian War, between 16 and 9 BC, and after the Pannonian-Delmatae revolt had been put down in 6 to 9 AD, when Istria was incorporated into Italy. The eastern Alpine Norican kingdom, the last major organised Celtic polity in continental Europe, was incorporated into the Empire without war around 10 BC, probably in part due to the friendly relations between Rome and the Norici. Three honorific inscriptions dated to that time have been found at Magdalensberg, in which eight Noric tribes pay homage to the ruling Augustan dynasty. The border of the Roman Empire had now moved from the edge of present-day Italy to the Danube. A similar expansion was to take place in the area eight centuries later, when Charlemagne defeated the Avars to significantly expand the southeastern borders of the Carolingian state.\n\nSLOVENIA ROMANA The Roman conquests that brought the independence of local tribes to an end were soon followed by administrative organisation of the region into provinces, incorporating it into the Roman state and legal order. The west of Slovenia, to Ad Pirum (Hrušica), was already fully considered part of Italy by the Augustine era (Regio X – Venetia et Histria). In around 10 AD, the province of Pannonia was created, the western parts of which reached to modern-day Posavje, along the Sava river. The eastern Alps, from the Danube in the north to the Savinja river basin (Celeia) in the south, was not incorporated into the Empire as a province Noricum until after the reign of Emperor Claudius, in the middle of the first century CE. With the exception of Pannonia, which was divided at the start of the second century, during the reign of Trajan, into westerly Pannonia Superior, and easterly Pannonia Inferior, these provinces remained unchanged until the middle of the second century. At that time, incursions by the Quadi and Marcomanni, which in 166 reached as far as Aquileia, led to the Italian border being moved eastward from Emona (Ljubljana) – to Atrans (Trojane). The last major reorganisation of provinces in the region was carried out by Diocletian at the end of the third century. Noricum was divided by the main Alpine ridge into a northerly part (Noricum Ripense), which covered the area along the Danube, and a southerly part (Noricum Mediterraneum). The latter included the modern-day Slovene region of Štajerska, comprising the areas centred on ancient Celeia (Celje) and Poetovio (Ptuj). Pannonia Superior, which included the southeasterly part of today’s Slovene territory, was divided into the northerly Pannonia Prima and southerly Pannonia Savia, which had its capital in Siscia (Sisak). This 16\n\nincluded the modern-day region of Dolenjska. Urban settlements known as civitates formed the internal structure of the provinces. In contrast to later towns founded in the Middle Ages, the surrounding area (ager) also came under their jurisdiction. For example, the ager of Tergeste included the entire Karst region up to Nanos and Javorniki, while the ager of Celeia covered approximately the entire Savinja valley and Kozjansko region, i.e. the area from Trojane to Sotla. Large farming compounds, known as villae rusticae, were developed in the hinterlands of such towns. Over 150 have been identified on Slovene territory. In areas where continuity from the Roman period to the Early Middle Ages prevailed, such as Poreč and Pula in the peninsula of Istria, traces of the cadastral division into agri have been preserved to the present day. The first Roman city founded on the territory of modern Slovenia was Emona (Ljubljana). It held the rights of a Roman colonia, and by 14 or 15 AD had already expanded beyond its city walls. The first colonists of Emona came primarily from cities in the Po valley and from Aquileia, accompanied by some veterans of the XV Legion. Around the middle of the first century CE, five Norican settlements – Aguntum (near Lienz), Iuvavum (Salzburg), Teurnia (near Spittal), Virunum (at Zollfeld) and Celeia – were granted the status of municipium, granting their inhabitants additional rights. Exceptional examples of provincial monumental art have been discovered at Šempeter, in a necropolis for the aristocracy and wealthy citizens of nearby Celeia. The same status was extended between 70 and 80 AD to Neviodunum (Drnovo) in Dolenjska region, which in the fourth century became a major river port and horse-changing station. The town of Poetovio developed from a settlement surrounding a legionary camp, and was awarded the rights of a colony by Emperor Trajan at the end of the first century. At the crossroads of the major routes that crossed the territory, and the location of the stone bridge over the Drava river, Poetovio, which developed into medieval Ptuj, was the most important urban settlement in Slovene territory for the first millennium and beyond. Poetovio was also home to the first organised Christian community, a diocese, in today’s Slovene territory. Towards the end of the third century, during the pre-Constantine period before the granting of religious freedom, the bishop and martyr Victorinus of Poetovio (d. 304) lived here. His ecclesiastical writings make him the first known literary author from any of the Danubian provinces. The ecclesiastical organisation of dioceses reflected the administrative structure of the Roman provinces, with individual towns (civitates) being made the sees of bishops. There is evidence of a bishop of Emona from the second half of the fourth century, a bishop of Teurnia is mentioned in the fifth century, while bishops are recorded for Aguntum, Virunum and Celeia in the sixth. Around 530, the bishop of Celeia was Gaudentius, 17\n\nnow known for the exceptional verse of his epitaph at the church of St. Paul near Prebold. In 599, a Christian community with a bishop is mentioned in Koper (Insula Capritana) in Istria, where there were already another five dioceses: Pola, Cissa, Pedena, Parentium and Tergeste. Numerous Christian monuments from Late Antiquity have been preserved in modern-day Slovenia, such as examples of ecclesiastical architecture (churches, baptisteries), Christian inscriptions, liturgical artefacts and everyday objects featuring Christian symbols, testament to the powerful impact of the new faith. It was also in this region, between Ajdovščina and Vipava in the Vipava valley, that Emperor Theodosius, a Christian, defeated his pagan rival Eugenius in the Battle of the Frigidus river in 394. The Christian victory was ascribed to the miraculous occurrence of a fierce tempest. Ancient writers and, following their example, medieval writers recognised the battle as a turning point in world history – the final victory of Christianity over paganism. The church in Aquileia was the seat of metropolitan authority over the dioceses mentioned above, and probably existed as a diocese from the middle of the third century – in contrast to legends that assert that the first bishop of Aquileia was St. Hermagoras, a disciple of Mark the Evangelist, who was martyred around 70 AD. Aquileia achieved metropolitan status in the middle of the fifth century. The title of patriarch for Aquileian metropolitan bishops is attested from 558/560, while more detailed information on the dioceses included in the metropolitan province dates back only to the late sixth century. For example, according to the bishops’ signatures in an ecclesiastical assembly in Grado, traditionally dated to 579, five dioceses in Istria, nine in Venetia and three in Noricum Mediterraneum came under the jurisdiction of the Aquileian metropolitan, as well as one each in Pannonia Prima and Raetia Secunda. The drastic deterioration in conditions in the fifth and sixth centuries, as barbarian peoples, such as the Goths and Lombards, started to attack and take control of the eastern borders and even the interior of the Empire, saw the Roman state begin to decline (the Vita Sancti Severini, written by Eugippius at the beginning of the sixth century is an excellent source addressing this process in the area of Noricum Ripense). Cities and other lowland settlements on the main traffic routes regressed and collapsed, and some researchers suggest that dioceses moved their sees to newly fortified settlements on higher ground, drawing back from the major traffic routes to less accessible locations (refuges). It is so suggested that the bishop of Celeia retreated to the fortified settlement of Ajdovski Gradec, above Vranje. These fortified hilltop settlements are the most common form of settlement from Late Antiquity found on modern-day Slovene territory, and archaeological excavations have uncovered numerous Christian churches, often more than one in a single settlement. Nevertheless, the 18\n\nmigration of the Slavs into the eastern Alps at the end of the sixth century led to the complete collapse of ecclesiastical organisation in the former provinces of Noricum and Pannonia. Roman colonisation, and the related Romanisation of indigenous populations, who participated in Roman society with varying degrees of involvement and success, was initially related to military settlements and camps. In Emona, for example, the indigenous population were almost completely driven out, while in Celeia, Virunum and Teurnia, even the leading roles were predominantly filled by indigenous inhabitants. At the start of the first century, two Roman legions were stationed in modern-day Slovenia – Legio VIII Augusta, which had its winter camp in Poetovio, and Legio XV Appolinaris, which was stationed near modern-day Ljubljana before being transferred to Carnuntum (Petronell) on the Danube, east of Vienna. Poetovio remained a legionary camp throughout the first century. It was there, in 69 AD (by which time the Legio XIII Gemina were at the camp) that Vespasian was declared emperor. The incursions of the Marcomanni and Quadi led to the creation of a camp for Legio II Italicae in Ločica, near Šempeter in the Savinja valley, but the legion was quickly transferred to Lauriacum (Lorch) on the Danube. As early as the third century, a new defence system was starting to appear on the passes of the Karst. Works included blocking valleys and constructing signal towers and fortifications, to protect Italy from the east. The defences stretched from Tarsatica on the Kvarner Gulf in the south to the valley of the Gail river in modern-day Austria to the north. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, the fourth-century officer and historian, it was known as the claustra Alpium Iuliarum. The defences were part of the larger system for Italy that ran from Liguria all the way to the Kvarner Gulf (tractus Italiae circa Alpes); the local operational command was probably located in Castra (Ajdovščina) and Ad Pirum (Hrušica). After the fourth century, the defences were only used occasionally, in individual sections. The logistical requirements of the army meant that Roman occupation of the region was soon followed by a road system that expressed the geopolitical importance of the wider Slovene space. The starting point for this system was Aquileia; from there, the roads spread throughout the Danube, Drava and Sava river basins. The via Iulia Augusta went north from Aquileia to the Norican Alpine area. One branch of the road led through Aguntum to the upper valley of the Drava river and on towards Raetia, while another followed the Val Canale towards Virunum (at Zollfeld), the old Norican capital, before continuing to Lauriacum (Lorch), the capital of Noricum Ripense. Two roads led south towards Istria from Aquileia: the via Flavia, which passed through Tergeste (Trieste) to Pula, and another that led straight to Tarsatica (Trsat) and onward via Senia (Senj) to the main centre of Pannonia Savia, Siscia 19\n\n(Sisak). The main route across Slovene territory, the via Gemina, led east from Aquileia towards Ad Pirum, Emona, Celeia and Poetovio, connecting the eastern Po valley and Italian Adriatic to the central Danube river basin. From Poetovio, home to the main customs treasury for all Illyricum (publicum portorium Illyrici), one branch of the road led to northern Pannonia and Carnuntum on the Danube, while another led towards the capital of Pannonia Secunda, Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica). There was a further road leading from Emona via Neviodunum and Siscia along the Sava to Sirmium, with a road branching north to Virunum somewhere between Emona and Celeia. The barbarians heading into Italy in the fifth and sixth centuries also travelled along the main Emona-Aquileia road, finding plunder or a new home along its course. At the end of the fourth century, the Roman defence system along the Danube collapsed and the Visigoths, who had settled on lands within the Empire after their victory over Emperor Valens in the Battle of Adrianople in 378, were followed by other tribes such as the Huns, Suebi, Ostrogoths and Lombards, who steadily built up pressure on the northerly and easterly flanks. In 379 these events had already spilled over onto present-day Slovene territory, when the Visigoths sacked Poetovio and Stridon, the birthplace of St. Jerome, which lay somewhere along the border between Pannonia and Dalmatia (perhaps even in the Kvarner Gulf area). The Visigoths were also the first barbarian people to sack Rome; they broke into Italy in 409/410, along the route that Attila would follow in 452, when the Huns sacked and burned Aquileia, as well as towns and fortresses in present day Slovenia. At the end of the 480s, Theoderic the Great reached an agreement with the emperor in Constantinople to act as allies (foederati) of the Eastern Roman Empire, enabling him to lead the Ostrogoths into Italy. In the Battle of the Isonzo (the Soča river), in 489, Theoderic defeated Odoacer, who had deposed the last Western Roman emperor in 476. By 493, Theoderic had conquered Italy, which the Romanised Ostrogoths would rule for another half century. By 536, Noricum, Pannonia and Dalmatia all came within the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy. Theoderic’s administrator for Noricum Mediterraneum was, in all probability that Ursus v(ir) s(pectabils), who donated a notable mosaic with Christian symbolism in the ‘funeral’ church of the newer Norican capital of Teurnia. The Langobardi or Lombards entered Italy almost exactly 80 years after the Visigoths. They arrived just after Easter in 568, the last time that a wave of soldiers would migrate from a Pannonian homeland, taking their wives and children, equipment and animals on carts, on horses and on foot. The Lombards arrived in the present-day Lower Austria, south of the Danube, at the start of the sixth century. In 547/48, Emperor Justinian I made a treaty with 20\n\nthem, conceding “the Norican city and the Pannonian fortresses”, i.e. the former Gothic Pannonia and the part of Noricum south of the Drava, over which the Roman (Byzantine) emperor still had power. With the exception of the “Norican city” – which some historians understand as the urban area of Poetovio, others as Celeia – Noricum had then been ruled for over a decade by the Franks, who had also taken Venetia around 545. Lombard settlement then spread to upper Sava valley, as testified by a graveyard discovered in Kranj, where the older graves are Ostrogothic and the newer Lombard. The treaty of 547/48 had made the Lombards imperial foederati, and their advance into the area south of the Danube was initially aimed against the Franks. In 567 King Alboin – who would later lead his people into Italy – and his Lombards destroyed the Gepids, who then ruled over Sirmium, largely because he had allied himself with the Avars, who had recently moved into the lower Danube area. Yet these new allies and neighbours would soon also represent a new enemy for the Lombards. The following year, the Lombards left Pannonia to the Avars, perhaps even by treaty. Soon, Slavic people joined the Avars in migrating to Pannonia. The migration of Lombards from Pannonia to Italy, which may have been encouraged by the embittered Byzantine general Narses, had two long-term consequences: first, the political unity of Italy came to an end for many centuries, and second, the Avars’ hegemony finally separated Pannonia, including most Slovene territory, from the Roman ecumene.\n\nTHE SETTLEMENT OF THE SLAVS The settlement of Slavic people – one cannot speak of Slovenes until well after the Early Middle Ages – in the eastern Alps and the basins of the eastern Alpine rivers culminated in the final decades of the sixth century, although the process had started before that and would only end at the beginning of the ninth century. As indicated by some Slovene dialectal reflexes, preserved to this day in the Gailtal dialect in Carinthia, and place and river names in present-day Austria south of the Danube, the first Slavic thrust into the eastern Alpine space came from the north, from the area of the western Slavic language group. The first wave seems to have turned south around 550, leaving present-day Moravia and crossing the Danube between Traun to the west and Vienna to the east, encompassing first the territory of Upper and Lower Austria, then gradually spreading into the interior along the Alpine river valleys up to the Karavanke mountain range, and then along the Drava river to the southeast. It seems that the diocese in Poetovio (Ptuj) collapsed before 577, during the waves of Slavic migration. A second wave of Slavic migration to the eastern Alps from the southeast came somewhat later and was very closely linked to the Avars. This nomadic people from the Steppes had 21\n\ntaken control of the Pannonian Plain after the Lombards moved into Italy in 568, and had then attacked the Byzantine state across the Danube and Sava rivers. In 582 they captured Sirmium, the former capital of Illyricum, and also started to move towards the northwest, accompanied by Slavs. The Slavic-Avar advance led to the collapse of ancient structures, including the ecclesiastical organisation. Based on the synodal records from the metropolitan church of Aquileia, which describe the fall of the ancient dioceses in this area (Emona, Celeia, Poetovio, Aguntum, Teurnia, Virunum, and Scarabantia), it may be possible to trace the stages of the Slavic-Avar advance into the eastern Alps. By 588, the upper Sava valley had fallen into their hands, and by 591 they had taken the upper Drava valley, where in the following years, skirmishes with northern neighbours, the Bavarians, began around present-day Lienz. In 592, the Bavarians were successful, but then, in 595, they were heavily defeated in a battle decided by the Avar leader (khagan) with his cavalry. These battles, which flared up once more around 626, led to the development and consolidation of a border area that divided the eastern Alpine area for centuries: a Frank-dominated western half separated from an Avar and Slavic east and southeast. To the south, along the Soča (Isonzo) river and in Istria, which then reached to the Nanos massif and to Snežnik mountain, the border was established somewhat later. Following battles with the Friulian Lombards at the start of the eight century, the Slavs occupied the hilly land to the west of the Soča, up to the edge of the Friulian plain. This ethnic boundary has lasted, with minor changes, for over 1,200 years, up until the present day. The advancing Slavs moved into Istria from the northeast, via the Postojna Gate. First, until around 600, they settled the lands up to the peninsula’s natural threshold to the south of the Trieste-Rijeka road, where the Karst plain falls sharply down to the hinterland of Trieste and Buzet. At the end of the eighth century, for reasons of recruitment and economic need, the local Frankish authority organised the resettlement of Slavs from the continental part of Istria into the unpopulated urban territories in the peninsula’s interior, to counter the influx of armed Avar groups. It is not possible to reliably determine the number of Slavs that settled in the eastern Alpine and pre-Alpine areas. A population figure of 20,000 for the area of modern-day Slovenia, which covers 20,000 km2 – acquired by taking the oldest statistical source for Slovene territory, the first urbarial record for the Freising Škofja Loka seigneury from 1160 and working backwards and generalising for the whole area – seems small but acceptable. It should be pointed out that the population density was certainly higher in some areas, such as the Klagenfurt Basin in Carinthia and around Kranj in Carniola, but settlement of an area that was far more forested than today would have been very uneven. 22\n\nBy the time the Slavs had settled the former provinces of Noricum and Pannonia, Roman citizenship had already disappeared from the area. It did survive for considerable time, despite the major upheavals of the fifth century, as long as the area was still administered as part of Italy. This era came to an end in western Noricum (where the death in 532 of the deacon Nonnosus, who had worked around Teurnia, was still dated by reference to the Roman consuls), with the Frankish occupation of 536/537. The eastern Norican and western Pannonian areas, which in 548 were ceded to the Lombards by the eastern Roman Emperor Justinian, were separated from the Roman ecumene by the Lombard migration to Italy in 568, and the establishment of the new Avar dominion in the central Danube area. This does not mean that the new arrivals did not assume the heritage of antiquity, at least in part. Older conceptions of the indigenous population completely abandoning the region or being forced out by the Slavs have long since been superseded. Numerous place names relating to the name Vlah, which the Slavs gave to the ‘Romans’ (e.g. Laško), as well as some fortified hilltop settlements – a typical form of settlement in this area in Late Antiquity – such as Rifnik, south of Šentjur by Celje, which were settled continuously until the seventh century, indicate the contact and cohabitation of the indigenous inhabitants with the Slavs. The Slavs also assumed numerous ancient place and river names, as well as some components of their everyday economic life, particularly Alpine dairy-farming. The further west one travels, towards Friuli and Italy, the more traces one finds of such contact. Even though the area newly settled by the Slavs had been cultivated since antiquity, there were many changes in its structure at this time. The most evident was the collapse of ancient urban centres. The province, which had previously been centred on its towns, now became completely rural in character. In the early medieval period, illiteracy replaced the ancient literacy of the area. The codified legal order and the state it supported was replaced by new legal forms. A different social structure grew up alongside a new form of arable farming. The ecclesiastical organisation of dioceses collapsed completely, but the Christian cult did not, with the indigenous ‘Roman’ population managing to preserve it, at least in some locations, such as Spittal an der Drau in Carinthia. There, the diocesan church of Teurnia was destroyed around 600, but the preservation of the gravestone of Deacon Nonnosus from 532 mentioned above in a monastical church from the end of the eighth century in Molzbichl indicates the continuity of the cult well beyond the initial period of Slavic settlement. The Carantanian mission of the eighth century would later explicitly associate itself with this core of local Christian tradition.\n\n23\n\nNEW IDENTITIES By the end of the sixth century, today’s eastern Tyrol and Carinthia were already known as the ‘land of the Slavs’ (Sclaborum provincia), while the presence of an Avar khagan indicates that this mountainous Alpine world was included in the Avar dominions, the centre of which lay between the Danube and the Tisza river in Pannonia. The Avars first appeared in Europe around 560, on the borders of the Byzantine state along the lower Danube. In 567, they joined forces with the Lombards to destroy the Gepids. The subsequent Avar settlement of Pannonia, (from where the Lombards migrated into Italy in 568) reached its peak in 582 with the capture of the ancient capital of Illyricum, Sirmium. In a wider sense, the Avar name included everybody living under the authority of the khagan. The Avar name was used for a supra-regional political community that was rather unstable and subject to continual changes, which was characteristic of all the nomadic horse people from the Eurasian Steppes. The Avars formed a polyethnic alliance, which was always open to incoming groups, and in addition to the other peoples (gentes) of the Pannonian basin, the alliance also encompassed Gepids, Bulgars, Kutrigurs, and above all, Slavs. The Slavs settled across a large area of the Avar political entity, stretching from the Sudetes in the north to the lower Danube to the south. They were subordinate to their Avar masters, paying tribute and providing military service. Yet the attitudes and relations of the horse-bound Avar warriors to the various Slavic groups differed according to the time and geographical circumstances. Avar supremacy over the Slavs at the heart of the khaganate based around the lower Danube and Tisza river in Pannonia was undoubtedly more keenly felt than on the periphery, in the hilly and heavily forested eastern Alpine and northwest Balkan areas, which were less suitable for the life of nomadic horse people. In Slovene historiography, one finds the relationship described thus: “Nothing justifies the thinking that Carantanians all had their own Avar master. Months could pass without seeing an Avar-nomad, and in more remote places perhaps even a year. Yet if a band stopped in their village, the situation was completely lawless, as described so movingly by Fredegar and Nestor, and as even the mighty Goths experienced under the Huns.” Traces of the Avar presence in Carantania may be preserved in the place names of Faning and Fohnsdorf (Slovene: Baniče and Banja Vas) deriving from the word ban (from the Avar bajan). The Avar rule described above lasted until the mid-620s, when two not entirely unconnected events – the start of Slavic resistance to Avar supremacy under Samo in 623 and the failed Avar siege of Constantinople in 626 – ushered in major changes in the region. Before 626, barbarian peoples had already reached the walls of the great city on the 24\n\nBosphorus, but the Avars’ was the first genuine attempt to conquer Constantinople, in alliance with the Persians and with their subjugate Slavic warriors. The failure of this siege proved a disaster for the Danubian khaganate, almost precipitating its complete collapse. The defeated Avars, torn by internal disputes because of the greatly weakened khagan, effectively fell out of sight for several decades for Byzantine writers, who were becoming more concerned with decisive clashes with the Persians and soon after that with Arabs. The catastrophe of 626 also gave considerable succour to the position of Slavs who joined the uprisings under Samo. According to the Fredegar Chronicle, which does not seem entirely reliable in terms of chronology, Samo joined the Slav revolt in the territory of today’s Czech Republic and Slovakia in 623, which would mean that the breakaway of the Avar khaganate’s western flank began before the great crisis of 626. Samo, a Frank by birth and probably a weapons trader, exploited the opportunity to take the fight to the Avars and become ruler (king, until his death in 658) of a central European union, the first Slavic polity known to history. Its centre was north of the Danube, but it included the area of the Eastern Alps later known as Carantania. In 630, the Frankish king, Dagobert I, organised an unsuccessful attempt to destroy Samo’s realm, uniting Frankish and Alamannian warriors with Lombards, who could only have acted against their Alpine Slav neighbours. Around 623 to 626, the Friulian Lombards had already wrested control of “the district of the Slavs, called Zellia” in Val Canale. This was the first time that Slavic lands were brought into dependence on Friuli, and the Slavs there were to pay tribute to the Lombard duke in Cividale del Friuli until around 740. Probably not without reason, the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum (The Conversion of the Bavarians and Carantanians) – a text dating back to 870 in Salzburg and the most important historical source for the eastern-Alpine and Pannonian region in the eight and ninth centuries – also links Samo with the very earliest Carantanian history. At that time, the Alpine Slavs, called also Vinedi, who were part of Samo’s political union, also had their own prince known as Vallucus, who ruled the border area known as the ‘March of the Wends’ (Marca Vinedorum). This name, attributed by a contemporary Frankish chronicler, bears indirect witness to the fact that the Slavic eastern Alpine area between the Bavarians and Lombards was the border region of something greater, i.e. Samo’s political community. Prince Vallucus and his Slavs were joined around 631/632 by a group of Bulgars led by Alzeco (Alciocus). He was one of a group of Bulgar pretenders who had wanted to exploit the crisis in the Avar khaganate that followed the catastrophe of 626 by taking control. However, the group suffered a defeat and fled from Pannonia with 9,000 men, together with women and children, to the Bavarians who, after an initial welcome, murdered several 25\n\nthousand of them on the orders of the Frankish king Dagobert I – an early Bavarian precursor of the Saint Bartholomew massacre. Only Alzeco’s group escaped, and fleeing once more were received by Vallucus. Alzeco’s Bulgars remained with the Alpine Slavs for around thirty years, a generation, in the nascent Carantania, before migrating after 662 to Benevento, in Lombard Italy. After Samo’s death in 658 the Avars renewed their supremacy of most of Slavic central Europe, but not over the Carantanian Slavs, who as the Alzeco episode indicates, were independent of all their neighbours: the Bavarians and Franks; and the Lombards and Avars. Only eight decades later, in around 740, did Avar pressure grow so much that the Carantanians, under their prince, Borut, were forced to recognise Bavarian overlordship in return for their aid against their eastern neighbours. The Avars also restated their supremacy south of the Karavanke mountains after the middle of the seventh century – if indeed it had ever been broken – and the khaganate once more stretched to the borders of Friuli in Italy. Around 664, at the behest of the Lombard king Grimoald, the Avars attacked Friuli and defeated and killed the usurping duke of Friuli, Lupus, probably near Ajdovščina, at the Hubelj river (fluvius Frigidus) in the Vipava valley, approximately where Emperor Theodosius (a Christian) had defeated Eugenius, his pagan rival, in 394. Paul the Deacon, a Lombard by birth from Cividale, who wrote of these events at the end of the eighth century, also reports that Arnefrit, son of the defeated usurper, fled in fear of Grimoald “to the tribe of Slavs in Carnuntum, which is erroneously called Carantanum” (ad Sclavorum gentem in Carnuntum, quod corrupte vocitant Carantanum). Although the term Carantanum does not belong to the time that Paul was describing, but to the end of the eighth century, when he wrote his History of the Lombards, this is the oldest undisputed reference to the name. The educated Friulian historian – like many writers of the time – maintained ethnographical traditions and described new facts in ancient terms. He therefore explains Carantanum as a popular, erroneous, rendering of the ancient name Carnuntum, (an ancient fortress east of Vienna on the Danube, known today as Petronell), which actually had no connection with Carantania. Paul’s report clearly shows that the Carantanians’ tribal name – probably first mentioned by an anonymous cosmographer from Ravenna as Carontani – was derived from the local or regional name for the area in which they lived. The name was originally connected with the area around Zollfeld (Carentana) and Ulrichsberg (Mons Carentanus), where the civitas Carantana (Karnburg) and ecclesia sanctae Mariae ed Carantanam (Maria Saal) stood. The name came to refer to the entire area ruled by the prince from Karnburg. The name is not only pre-Slavic, but also of pre-Roman origin; 26\n\netymologically the name Carantanians probably means ‘people from Caranta’. The root Karis typical of the wider Alpine-Adriatic area, and is also found in names such as Carnia and its derivative Carniola, as well as the name Karst.\n\nCARANTANIA The basic unit of political, social and legal life, as conceived in the Early Middle Ages, was the tribe, also referred to as ‘people’ (gens, rod’, ethnos). A tribe was by no means a simple structure, but in fact a very complex formation. Over the past decades, extensive and detailed research into Germanic, Slavic and steppe-nomadic ethnogenesis clearly indicates that the peoples of the Early Middle Ages were not communities of shared origin, but polyethnic communities identified not by the same blood, but by shared “nuclei of tradition” and customs that these heterogeneous groups participated in, and recognised as their own. The tribe of the Carantanians was a polyethnic unit too. Without doubt they were a Slavic tribe – which means that their nucleus of tradition within this polyethnic union was defined as Slavic. The contemporaries of the Carantanians also saw them as Slavs; for example, the unknown author of the Conversio wrote of “Slavs, called Carantanians” (Sclavi qui dicuntur Quarantani), who comprised two Slavic groups which, at the end of the sixth century, migrated to the eastern Alps from the north and south, as well as Croats and Dulebs and indigenous ‘Romans’, evidence for which is found in numerous place names. Nor should the possibility be rejected that there were also small numbers of Avars, Bulgars and Germanic people among them. The principality of the Carantanians was the oldest early medieval tribal polity formed in the eastern Alpine region. However, the Carantanians cannot simply be equated with the Slavs who settled in the eastern Alps at the end of the sixth century. At that time, today’s east Tyrol and Carinthia were generally referred to as ‘Sclaborum Provincia’, the land of the Slavs. In the second quarter of the seventh century, the ‘Marca Vinedorum’, the March of the Wends or Slavs, under its prince, Vallucus, represented a more developed level of political organisation. A clearer indication of a specific ethnic identity and political organisation is given by the geographical term that Paul the Deacon used in 664, Carantanum, where a specific Slavic tribe lived (gens Sclavorum). In any case, the Carantanian ethnogenesis came to an end before the middle of the eighth century, and probably around 700; in approximately 740, the Carantanians passed into history in dramatic circumstances with decisive impact on the future. At that time their prince was Borut and the Carantanians were seriously threatened by 27\n\nthe Avars, and were in need of assistance. Turning to the Lombards in Friuli was not a genuine option as the Slavs in Val Canale, where Friulian and Carantanian territory met, had recently ended over a century of paying a tribute to Ratchis, the duke of Friuli. Just before that, perhaps due to a perceived threat from the Slavs, the bishop of the exposed town of Iulium Carnicum (Zuglio in Carnia) had withdrawn to Cividale. Another indication of this general deterioration in Lombard-Slavic relations was the military incursion of Ratchis, between 737 and 744, into the “Slavic homeland of Carniola” (Carniola Patria Sclavorum), which then was within the Avar khaganate. Finding himself in a difficult position, Borut turned to the Bavarians and their duke, Odilo, for aid. The Slavs’ position was weakened by only a decade having passed since (in around 730) the Carantanians, described as “wild pagans”, had destroyed Maximilian’s monastic cell in Bavarian Bischofshofen, in the Salzach river valley. Nevertheless, the Bavarians responded to the call and, together with the Carantanians, defeated the Avars, though at the price of forcing the Carantanians to submit to the lordship of (Frankish) kings. Carantanian loyalty was guaranteed by hostages, including Borut’s son Cacatius (Gorazd) and his nephew Hotimir, who were taken to Bavaria and raised in the Christian faith. These fateful events took place before 743, as by then Carantanian warriors were already marching in the Bavarian army against the Franks. In 749, after the death of Borut, the Bavarians acquiesced, having sought Frankish permission, to Carantanian requests for Gorazd to be sent home and made their prince. But three years later Gorazd died and was succeeded by his cousin, Hotimir. He was accompanied to Carantania by the first Salzburg priest to come to the territory, who was particularly close to Hotimir by virtue of being the nephew of Hotimir’s godfather. Pope Zachary had already confirmed Carantania’s ecclesiastical subordination to Salzburg, and its related right to missions, during the time of Prince Borut, and perhaps even before 743. Yet the mission only really began during Prince Hotimir’s time, and as with previous events, the mission to Christianise the Carantanians was inextricably linked to the political situation. Close cooperation between a prince and the people close to him responsible for the mission was essential for success. Hotimir committed himself to participating at a mass in Salzburg every year “and there he accepted the doctrine and Christian duty.” The bishop of Salzburg at that time was the erudite Irishman Virgilius (746/47 or 749 to 784). Hotimir turned to him personally, requesting that he come on a missionary to Carantania, but, instead, he sent the regional bishop, Modestus, as his envoy (episcopus missus). A large number of churches were consecrated in Carantania during the Salzburg mission, which lasted towards the end of the eighth century, although only three churches consecrated by Modestus can be specifically 28\n\nnamed. All three were linked to established centres and the traditions of ancient Noricum. The church dedicated to Mary at Maria Saal was near the ancient capital of Noricum, Virunum, and, together with the castle Karnburg standing opposite it, was the political and religious centre of the Carantanians. Popular tradition states that Modestus’ grave lies here. Another church lay in the ager of the more recent Norican capital, Teurnia, near Spittal an der Drau, perhaps in Molzbichl or its surroundings. The third church, ad Undrimas, was consecrated near the upper Mura river, in the surroundings of Judenburg, where a Roman continuity is also attested. Modestus remained in Carantania until his death in 763. Yet his death unleashed the first reaction from Carantanians opposed to the Christian faith and the prince so closely associated with it. This may also have been a response to the contemporaneous revolt and rejection of fealty by the young duke of Bavaria, Tassilo III, against the Frankish king, Pippin. In 765, the revolt rose once more, but again Hotimir quickly crushed it. His death in 769, which may have been connected to a change in the princely dynasty, led to the third and most violent revolt, and for many years to come there were no longer any priests in Carantania. It was only by the direct military intervention of the Bavarian Duke Tassilo III, in 772, that the Carantanian rebels were crushed and the previous order restored. This was an event with repercussions far beyond the local region, and contemporaries compared Tassilo’s victory to Charlemagne’s destruction of the Irminsul, the Saxon sanctuary. However, Tassilo had initially intended to resolve matters peacefully. To that end, in 769, he established a monastery in Innichen at the source of the Drava, on the border with Carantania. The monastery had the expressly missionary purpose, “that the faithless Slavs be brought to the path of truth.” Co-operation in the Christianisation of the Carantanians has sometimes erroneously been attributed to a monastery in Kremsmünster, between Traun and Enns in today’s Upper Austria, which was founded in 777 by Tassilo III, and the founding charter of which includes the first written mention of the Slavic term jopan (župan). However, the recent archaeological discovery of the oldest Carinthian monastery at Molzbichl, near Spittal, needs to be ranked alongside Innichen, where there are good grounds for dating its founding to the time after Tassilo’s victory over the Carantanians in 772. The extremely rare dedication to St. Tiburtius, shared with a monastery in Pfaffmünster (near Straubing in the Bavarian diocese of Regensburg) where a group of Irish monks operated, probably also indicates the identity of the monks who came to Carantania. An Irish name Dublittir (Dupliterus) also had a priest operating as a missionary in Carantania around 775, without even giving particular emphasis to the Irish origin of Virgilius (Fergil), the bishop of Salzburg. The personal names of missionaries reported in the Conversio Bagoariorum et 29\n\nCarantanorum, a source that, despite its pro-Salzburg bias, offers us priceless information from earliest Carantanian history, also reveal the important role played in the Carantanian mission by ‘Romans’ from the Salzburg area. The victory by Tassilo III in 772 brought the longstanding political crisis in Carantania to an end. Carantania’s new prince was Valtunc, now even more closely linked to Bavaria, and was probably chosen in a similar manner to Borut’s successors. The links with Salzburg were re-established, and by the time of Virgilius’ death, in 784, six groups of missionaries had come to Carantania. Virgilius’ successor, Arno, initially continued the same policy. One of the missionaries to Carantania at that time was a priest called Ingo, who for a long time was taken to be a legendary prince of Carantania. Another figure increasingly seen as having been a historical person is Domicianus who, according to legends that arose around the start of the fourteenth century, was the Carantanian prince who converted his people to Christianity and founded a church in Millstatt. Arno’s policy changed after his elevation to archbishop in 798, and in 799, together with Gerold, prefect and brother-in-law of Charlemagne and the most powerful man in Bavaria, he appointed a regional bishop, Theoderic, to hold office in “Sclavinia”. This restored the institution of regional bishop to Carantania, to which Virgilius had appointed Modestus, and which was maintained until the mid-tenth century, with an interruption in the third quarter of the ninth century. The institution also served as a model to Gebhard, the archbishop of Salzburg, in the founding of the first Carinthian diocese, in Gurk, in 1072. Salzburg’s role in the Christianisation of the Carantanians was decisive, but not unique. The pro-Salzburg source, the Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum suppressed the role of other ecclesiastical centres, such as Aquileia, Regensburg and Freising, in this undertaking. Freising in particular was closely linked to Carantania in the eighth and ninth centuries. The Freising mission, which was characterised by an expansion down the Drava river into Upper Carinthia, where the diocese already had an estate near the former city of Teurnia in the ninth century, took Innichen as its starting point. As early as 822, a Carantanian Bavarian by the name of Matheri bequeathed his lands between Trixen and Griffen to the monastery in Innichen. The first mention of the Freising church of Sts. Primus and Felician at Maria Wörth, near the lake of Wörthersee, dates from the ninth century. And finally, the most convincing arguments suggest that Freising’s upper Carinthian properties were also the place where, around the turn of the millennium, three short but truly invaluable religious texts were written, the texts now known as the Freising Manuscripts (Slov. Brižinski spomeniki). The missionaries undoubtedly propagated the new faith in the vernacular, so a Slavic 30\n\nChristian terminology began to develop among the Carantanians, the first Slavic people to be Christianised from the west. This also led to the development of a ‘cultural language’, which was of global and inter-tribal character because of the widespread missionary work. A trace of the cultural traditions from the very earliest Christianity among Slovenes was preserved in a number of religious formulas that were transmitted orally from generation to generation and only written down in the late Middle Ages. The Lord’s Prayer formula recorded in the second half of the fourteenth century in the Rateče manuscript (also known as the Klagenfurt manuscript), and in the Stara Gora manuscript at the end of the fifteenth century, therefore goes back to the very earliest period of the mission, perhaps as early as the end of the eighth century, and certainly to the ninth century. The prayer adveniat regnum tuum (your kingdom come), which is written in both the medieval manuscripts in the form pridi bogastvo tvoje (literally: your riches come) could only have been formulated before the language of the Alpine Slavs included the word kraljestvo (kingdom). The word kralj, meaning king, is derived from the personal name of Charlemagne (Carolus, Karl, Karel). Without doubt, the Freising Manuscripts are the most important evidence of the Slavic mission. These are three preserved Slavic texts (referred to below as FM I, FM II, FMS III) written in Carolingian minuscule in a single Latin codex, and today kept in Munich. They are the oldest Slavic texts in the Latin alphabet and were a component part of a pontificale, the liturgical book used by a bishop at mass. FM I was probably written over the period 972– 1022/39, while FMS II and FM III, which were produced by a different hand, have been dated to after 977, in the time of Bishop Abraham (died 994), who acquired estates for the Freising church in Carinthia and the large Škofja Loka seigneury in Carniola. The place in which the manuscripts were written has not been identified, but the main candidates are upper Carinthia and Freising itself. Modern linguists sometime refer to the language of the manuscripts as Old Slovene, while contemporary writers referred only to the Slavic language (lingua Sclavanisca). In terms of content, FM I and FM III are general confessional formulas, while FM II is a rhetorically complex sermon on sin and a call to repentance and confession. The form of the manuscripts known today is the product of dictation or copying, while the originals of the texts go back at least to the middle of the ninth century. However, the various theories or hypotheses on the origin and sources of these manuscripts differ significantly. This is primarily because there exist similar texts in the Old Church Slavonic tradition of Constantine and Methodius, and because they also link the Friesing texts to older Old High German Bavarian confessional formulas. The perception exists that at times in the history of these Slavic texts, the national origin of researchers has been projected onto the documents in 31\n\ndeciding between Carantanian-Pannonian, Pannonian-Moravian, Moravian-Slovakian or Croatian territory as the probable place of origin. Although it cannot be explicitly proven, there are good reasons for assuming that the texts grew out of the Carantanian mission and the Christian tradition of the region, which Slavic immigrants also took with them to the Pannonian realm of Kocel. Like Carantania, this also fell under Salzburg’s ecclesiastical sway, and the brother saints Constantine and Methodius also worked there for some time. However, regardless of all the hypotheses about the texts, the indisputable fact remains that the preserved version was only used among the predecessor of Slovenes, and represent their learnéd culture at the turn of the millenium. One cannot conceive of the ethnic identities expressed in the name of a tribe existing without some constitutional forms and legal norms, however rudimentary those may have been. As with other early medieval tribes, Slavs lived according to their own tribal law. In contrast to the written and codified laws of their western, Germanic neighbours, the law of Slavic tribes were retained unwritten in the form of customs. ‘Tribal rites’ (ritus gentis), ‘laws and customs’ (leges et consuetudines) or ‘Slavic rites’ are terms from ninth-century sources for the law under which the Slavic ethnic principalities lived. With a few exceptions, evidence of this tribal law has not survived to the present day. Political changes related to Frankish expansion led more and more to the exercising of new legal norms, in additional to tribal law. The middle of the eighth century saw a great change in the life of the Carantanians, with the arrival under Frankish overlordship and the start of the mission, which undoubtedly led to reorganisation of the tribe. The administrative reform that covered the southeast of the Frankish sphere of influence in the third decade of the ninth century was to have even more profound consequences. At that point, tribal rule was replaced by the administration of a count. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the eleventh century, in the notice marking the founding of the convent St. Georgen am Längsee in Carinthia, there is still a distinction made between witnesses dealt with according to Bavarian tribal law, who were symbolically “pulled by their ears” (testes tracti per auers), and witnesses subject to Slavic tribal law (Sclauenicę institutionis testes). The Slavic tribal law mentioned here is a relic of the former tribal constitution of Carantania. By the very beginning of the eighth century at the latest, Carantanian society was organised under the lordship of a prince. In terms of their position, tribal prince of this kind, which Frankish sources generally refer to as dux gentis, was king (rex gentis). This is supported by the Slavic word knjaz (knez in Slovene), which refers to a Slavic tribal prince of the Early Middle Ages, and which derives from the Germanic *kuningaz, meaning a tribal 32\n\nking who ruled over a “small area”. Eight princes of the Carantanians from the second half of the eighth century and first third of the ninth century are known to us by name. At that time, Carantania was already subject to the Franks or Bavarians as a tributary or client principality, one of many that lined the eastern Frankish border. Internally, the principality retained its tribal constitution, one of the clearest examples of which was the oldest part of the installation ceremony of the prince of Carantania. It was the Carantanians (or the class responsible for political decisions, populi) themselves, albeit with the permission of their Frankish king, who made Gorazd and then Hotimir their prince. The first three Carantanian princes known by name were related, and princely authority was therefore, with respect to the (at least formal) elections, hereditary within a ruling dynasty. The Carantanian prince was installed in all his dignity with a ceremony that involved him being placed on the Prince’s Stone, which once stood in the military camp at Karnburg. The Prince’s Stone – actually the base of an ionic column turned upside down – is today displayed in the Klagenfurt, and is the oldest preserved symbol of power in the entire eastern Alpine region. It was therefore at a very early stage (the mid-eighth century) that the Carantanians established a constitutional model, combining their tribal customs with the authority of the Frankish king, which would become widespread in the ninth century among Slavic tribes along the eastern and southern Frankish border. In addition to the prince and his dynasty, there was another high-ranking social class, the nobility. Informations dating from a somewhat later period, in sources from Salzburg, Freising and Brixen, are particularly informative and specific about the Carantanian and wider Alpine Slavic area. These sources indicate the existence of Slavic nobility before the end of the eighth century, and provide significant evidence of its survival into the Frankish period. For example, in 830, a certain Baaz from Slavic Carantania (de genere Carontania Sclavaniorum) bequeathed properties he had held in Bavaria to the church of Freising. There are many reasons to support the idea that Baaz was the descendant of one of the ‘noble’ hostages who had accompanied the son and nephew of the Carantania prince to Bavaria in 743. This and other similar examples – e.g. the marriage around 860 of a Carantania Slav with the Greek name Georgius, which was probably acquired at baptism, into the noble line of Witigowo, a count in Carantania – indicate that groups existed within the Slavic community that were considered by neighbouring nobility to be of sufficient standing for acceptance into their ranks and even their families. To apply a modern term, one could say that even in the Early Middle Ages, the nobility, and particularly the high nobility, were international, just as in later times. A specific, very sensitive, and as yet unresolved, issue within the social history of the 33\n\nAlpine Slavs is presented by the group known as kosezi. The group was a specifically Alpine Slav feature, as the places in which they lived, or the settlements with names relating to them, are found between the upper Enns river to the north and the Kolpa river to the south, i.e. within the area of Alpine Slavic colonisation. They appear relatively late in written sources, with the oldest mention (Koséntzes) dating from the mid-tenth century. According to Croat tradition, recorded in De Administrando Imperio, the work of the Byzantine Emperor Constantinus Porphyrogenetus, Koséntzes was the name of the one of the brothers who led the Croats to the hinterland of the Dalmatian cities. The Germans called this social class Edlinger (noble people), while Aquileian writers, connecting themselves to the Lombard tradition in Friuli, referred to them with the term arimanni, which the Lombards used to describe a special military class. Both terms indicate that it was some form of privileged social group. However, the evidence available that can be followed in sources from the Central Middle Ages onwards suggests that the group’s social status continually declined. In documents from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the kosezi are still equal to the ministerial class, but by the Late Middle Ages they were merely peasants with some special privileges. The peasant charged with installing the duke of Carinthia in the Late Middle Ages, was a kosez. At the same time, there is no doubt that the kosezi class goes back to the Early Middle Ages. The origin of the kosezi name – on which there are many theories – is not Slavic, despite their being an Alpine Slav phenomenon. It is not possible to determine whether it was just the name that was imported into the eastern Alpine area, or also the group that bore it. The name precludes a Germanic etymology, nor can kosez be a new formation derived from Edlinger. The kosezi therefore already existed when the Bavarians took them to be nobles, during their first contacts with the Alpine Slavs. Furthermore, the ceremony in which a kosez peasant on the Prince’s Throne symbolically handed over power in the Duchy of Carinthia to a new duke dressed in peasant clothing – therefore symbolically the same as him – could only have its origin in pre-feudal times. The direct contact between the kosezi and the Carantanian princ or/and later Carinthian duke, and their connection with military services, makes the theory that they were a form of military retinue for the Carantanian prince very attractive, and quite acceptable. Of course, many other possible explanations exist.\n\nCARNIOLA The polyethnic, but predominantly Slavic, principality of the Carantanians was not the only tribal union to form in the Early Middle Ages within the Slavic settled area in the eastern 34\n\nAlps. Its borders very approximately reached the border of the province of Noricum Mediterraneum from Late Antiquity. This means that almost all the Slavic-settled area of modern Slovenia – with the exception of the Slovene Drava valley, the most open route to the principality, which in all probability fell at least partially within the Carantanian sphere – remained outside the borders of Carantania. This was particularly the case for the Sava valley, which was separated from the Carantanians by the Karavanke mountains. Only during the time of the Ottonian dynasty, in the second half of the tenth century, when one can no longer talk of Carantania but rather of Carinthia as a duchy within a German state, was the geographical barrier overcome politically when the Carniolan margrave became subject to the authority of the Bavarian or Carinthian duke. The Slovene Sava valley as an area was known in the Early Middle Ages by the name Carniola. The name, derived from the territorial name Carnia, means nothing more than Little Carnia. The ancient homeland of the Carnians, patria Carnium, lay on the other side of the continental watershed, in the mountainous world north of the Friulian plain. It is no coincidence, then, that a Friulian Lombard, Paul the Deacon (writing at the end of the eighth century but describing events around 740), was the first to use the term Carniola, derived from Friulian geographical terminology, to describe the Slavic land (patria Sclavorum) to the east of Friuli. The tribal name Carniolans (Carniolenses) derives from the territorial name, and its only recorded use is in 820 in the Royal Frankish Annals (Annales Regni Francorum). All Early Medieval sources – though few in number – that mention Carniola and the Carniolans, clearly distinguish between two separate Slavic communities, north and south of the Karavanke mountains. The mention of the Carniolans in the Annals of 820 was not a passing reference, but a detailed picture of the great process of social and ethnic stratification developing in the former Avar territory. Individual Slavic peoples were starting to form during this period among most of the Slavs in the former Avaria – as attested by the appearance of new Slavic tribal names (Czechs, Moravians, Guduscans, Timocians, Abodrites, Croats) around the borders of the former khaganate – and similarly, judging by the name Carniolenses, a separate Slavic tribe began to form in the upper Sava valley by the end of the eighth century at the latest, taking its name, like the Carantanians, from the area in which it lived. “Carniola, land of Slavs,” where the Carniolans lived, very probably had a tribal constitution. And because the term dux is associated with patria and gens, the enigmatic figure of Slav Vojnomir (Wonomyrus Sclavus) from the Royal Frankish Annals of 795 can perhaps be linked to this picture of a tribal principality of Carniolans, as their dux gentis, though the explanation could be quite different. 35\n\nThe principality of the Carniolans was a further Slavic tribal territory in the eastern Alpine area, alongside that of Carantania. As the direct eastern neighbour of Friuli during the Frankish-Avar wars, Carniola recognised Frankish overlordship, perhaps as early as 791, and certainly by 795–796. Later developments indicate that it retained its tribal constitution, and was included in a new, expanded March of Friuli.\n\nFRANKISH EXP"
