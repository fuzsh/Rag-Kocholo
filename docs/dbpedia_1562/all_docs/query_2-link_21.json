        "text": "John Kucaba, 81, of Phillips passed away at Marshfield Medical Center in Marshfield, WI 54555 on Thursday, August 1, 2024. He was born to Henry and Antonia (Perger) on April 6, 1943, in Phillips, WI.\n\nHe worked at Marquip for a few years before going back to his dream of carpentry. He built many homes over the years. He truly enjoyed being a carpenter and took great pride in his work. When he was not working, he loved to hunt with his family, play baseball, camp, golf. He lived in Arizona in the winter months and came home to Northern Wisconsin in the summer. His family will fondly remember him as a devoted husband, wonderful father, and mentor.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife of 60 years, Helynn; children, Kraig and Karri; brother, Ron; sister, Joann Plein, Lynda Janos, and Bonnie (Ken) Schlote; and many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, and brother-in-law, Bob Plein.\n\nPer his wishes there will not be a formal service. Heindl-Nimsgern Funeral Home is assisting the family."
