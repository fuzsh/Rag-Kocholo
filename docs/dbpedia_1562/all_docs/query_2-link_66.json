        "text": "December 30, 2022 was my last working day at Silverchain Group in the position of Infrastructure and Cloud Lead. I’ve had an immensely enjoyable three years working with an incredibly talented group of people who never lose sight of the mission in building, delivering, supporting and maintaining technology services to the front-line care providers who in turn are delivering Best Care to over 100,000 clients across many parts of Australia. Thank you to my team, colleagues and friends at Silverchain - I take with me many happy memories and friends for life. This week I was warmly welcomed into the Security and Risk Management team at WA Health, Health Support Services (WA health system) as I commenced my role as Manager Security, Training and Engagement. I look forward to meeting and working with my colleagues in HSS and the broader WA Health network.\n\nSharing with you an observation and a concern as an IT Security practitioner. I received a competition promotion from Western Australia Department of Transport to win an iPad Air. Yes, I'd like to win an iPad Air so I looked at the competition registration page and the Terms and Conditions. To enter the competition you need to complete an entry form that requires full name (first and last), date of birth, email address, and phone number. Hmm, that seems like a lot of personally identifiable information when the Department of Transport already has all these details. Why not use another criteria, such as a vehicle registration. But the next bit is what really surprised me; the survey form is hosted by surveymonkey. So... the WA Government Department of Transport are using a US based survey service to collect PII? This is not mentioned in the Terms and Conditions. The closest they go is Privacy (point 12) \"The following personal information of people who opt into this competition ...(insert your PII)... will be used for the purpose of conducting the competition.\" Surely there are Australian (or even WA) based providers of equivalent services, or DoT or DGov could have hosted within their own digital platforms. As a courtesy I emailed WA DoT and the WA Office of Digital Government 10 days ago to alert them to this issue; so far I have not heard back from either. I encourage you to advise your family and friends against entering this competition as there is almost no control over what surveymonkey could do with your PII and imagine if there was a data breach. Dear Government departments, please think about how you obtain, manage, use, and secure our information. ref: https://lnkd.in/eAfPbDb8 @TransportWAgov, @DGov_WA #cybersecurity #PII #infosecurity #notmyPII"
