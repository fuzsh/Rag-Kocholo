        "text": "Slovenian footballer\n\nDenis Perger (born 10 June 1993) is a Slovenian professional footballer who plays as a defender for SV Wildon.\n\nClub career\n\n[edit]\n\nPerger began his career with the youth setup of NK Drava Ptuj, his hometown club. In January 2010, Perger was signed to a youth contract by Parma of Italy's Serie A but was released only six months later.[1] Perger then re-signed for Ptuj before signing for FC Koper of the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the top level of football in the country. In total, Perger appeared in three league matches with Ptuj and 24 league matches for Koper.\n\nIn July during the Summer 2013 transfer window, Perger was signed by SC Freiburg of Germany's Bundesliga until 30 June 2014 and immediately loaned to SV Wehen Wiesbaden of the 3. Liga for the 2013–14 3. Liga season so that Perger could get playing time at a high level.[2] At Wiesbaden, Perger was assigned the number 13 and it was expected that he would fill the roster spots left empty by injuries to defenders Daniel Döringer and Maximilian Ahlschwede.[3]\n\nPerger returned to SC Freiburg from his loan in May 2014 after making 13 first team appearances for Wiesbaden.[4]\n\nInternational career\n\n[edit]\n\nPerger represented Slovenia at all youth levels from under-15 to under-21. He made his debut for the under-21 team on 6 February 2013 in a friendly against Portugal.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
