        "text": "Marie Helene Laeser, age 102, of Monroe, our beloved Mother, Nana, and Aunt entered eternal peace with her Savior in her heavenly home on Friday, July 5, 2024 at the New Glarus Home. She was born the daughter of Ernst and Maria (Mueller) Ammon Sr, born April 1, 1922 in Hohenalsdorf, Brandenburg, Germany. Before she was one year old, she moved back to her father’s hometown of Herzogenbuchsee, Canton Bern, Switzerland with her parents. She immigrated to America in 1929, arriving in Winslow, IL with her family and later moved to Green County. She worked as a bookkeeper at Monroe Lumber Company before uniting in marriage to Frederick Frank Laeser on February 8, 1948 at St. John’s United Church of Christ in Monroe.\n\nThey made cheese in Forreston, IL before moving to the Maple Grove cheese factory near Juda, WI. They moved to Monroe in 1957, living on the corner of 14th St. and 20th Ave for over 60 years. It was known as the house with red geraniums and a green metal roof and shutters. She was told the airline pilots knew they were over Monroe by the green roof. She raised her children while working from home and later worked at Etter’s and Bruni Miller as a drapery consultant. After retiring, she started her own drapery business making draperies well into her mid-eighties.\n\nWhen you asked her about her favorite book she would say, “The Bible.” And when asked about her favorite movie, she would say, “The Sound of Music.” That is because it reminded her of Switzerland. She returned to Switzerland and Germany in 1989 and again in 1994 visiting her cousins. Unfortunately, she was not able to visit her birthplace.\n\nHer favorite holidays were Christmas and Easter which she enjoyed celebrating with her family and friends. She enjoyed cooking and was known for her German Potato Salad and Bratzeli cookies.\n\nWhen she turned 100, she celebrated with a party meeting and greeting family, relatives and friends. Then, when she turned 101, she received her German birth certificate and said, “I need to celebrate by starting to count this as my 1st birthday!”\n\nMarie was a member of St. John’s UCC and taught Sunday School for many years and served on the Church Council. She was instrumental in re-establishing St. John’s German Christmas Communion Service by asking Rev. Koehler if he would be willing to do this for the Swiss/German community. She possessed a deep faith in God. She was also a member of the Turner Hall New Swiss and served on their Board and volunteered her time.\n\nMarie was the loving mother of five wonderful children and their spouses, Joan Laeser, Frederick “Fritz” Laeser Jr., Ernest “Ernie” (Cathie) Laeser, Anita (Scott) Sponholz, and Heidi (Roger) Masarik.\n\nShe wanted them to know the most important things in life are: love, kindness, respect & drive.\n\nShe is further survived by 9 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren, 1 great-great-grandchild and 8 nieces & nephews.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Frederick “Fritz” Laeser Sr; her parents; a sister, Rosa Ammon; brother, Ernest Ammon and his wife, Alice Custer Ammon; niece, Jeanne Ammon; grandson, Jason Laeser; great-grandson, Kylon Benson; and her in-laws, Edward & Lois Laeser, Marian & Jim Petersen, Francis Segner & Ken Segner.\n\nFuneral Services will be held at St. John’s United Church of Christ on Monday, July 15, 2024 at 11:00 AM with Reverend Christina Schoenwetter officiating. Burial will follow at Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nVisitation will be held at the church from 10:00 AM until the time of service. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be sent in Marie’s name to St. John’s UCC, Turner Hall-NWSC, the New Glarus Home or Agrace HospiceCare.\n\nTo all who had a part in Marie’s care over the past several years, we thank you for your patience, kindness and good care. She impacted the lives of many and will be greatly missed. The world was a better place because she was in it.\n\nThank you to Shriner Hager Gohlke Funeral Home in assisting the family; the staff & volunteers at St. Clare Friedensheim & New Glarus Home; the church ladies from Zwingli UCC, St. John’s UCC, Ministers & friends that came to visit her.\n\nLove and hugs to all! – Marie"
