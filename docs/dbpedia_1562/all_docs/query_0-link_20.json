        "text": "In his 1882 unpublished essay <Die Eigenthümlichkeiten der magyarischen Volksmusik>, Franjo Ksaver Kuhač (1834–1911) used and explained the term <musicology>. Since the <Vierteljahrsschrift für Musikwissenschaft>, with Adler's definition of the term, had appeared three years later, in 1885, he assumed--and he died with this conviction--that he was the first to have coined the term. It is to Kuhač’s credit that he defined musicology with thinking independently about the discipline of music scholarship at the same time that Spitta, Chrysander, and Adler were considering the scope of the discipline. Comparative musicology was, for Kuhač, a discipline which had the task of investigating the dominant stylistic characteristics of the music of any given nation. Kuhač saw the point of the discipline to be that of establishing the laws of any national music, which could then be used as the basis for a national style in art music. His far-reaching goal was to create an awareness of Croatian national music and to establish its place in the context of Central European culture. From this starting point, he developed a program for a survey of the national music of South Slavs based on his systematization of comparative musicology (<Versuch einer Musikgeschichte der Südslaven>, 1875). On a large scale, the elements of the discipline as he saw it, comprise the collecting of traditional songs and dances; the analysis of their melodies, rhythms, and forms; their philological analysis (since--as he pointed out--the language and music of every nation constitute an organic union); and, finally, their comparison with musical traditions of the neighboring regions. The auxiliary sciences for this analysis are organology, paleography, histories of literature and liturgy, acoustics, historiography (including biographies of composers, musicians, and music scholars, and histories of music associations, institutes, and performing arts organizations), and oral history concerning music. In musicological literature, Kuhač is most famous for his collection <Južno-slovjenske narodne popievke> (South-Slav folk songs, 1878–81), but in an effort to produce a universal survey of music culture among the South Slavs his interests were unlimited, embracing ancient music notation, organology, music histories of Central European nations, music terminology, linguistics, and acoustics.\n\nIn 19th-century biographical writing subjectivity was supposed to be eliminated since the narrative was not seen as an interpretation but rather as reconstruction of the subject’s life. In such circumstances images of objects associated with the composer and environment that surrounded him could be seen ambiguous and interpreted in many different ways. Influenced by the study of physiognomy, portrait was perceived as a verifiable appearance of the sitter and as such the central visual supplement to biographical narrative, in some cases used even as a replacement for it. The method of using musician’s portraits for creating historical canon is demonstrated on the example of the first pictorial history of music, Gustav Kanth’s <Bilder-Atlas zur Musikgeschichte von Bach bis Strauss> (Berlin, 1912). Influenced by the Romantic idea about the composer/genius considered to be the creator independent from outside influences, on some 250 pages Kanth reproduced about one thousand illustrations, largely portraits of composers and their handwriting. Here, portrait is the composer, facsimile of his handwriting is his musical work, the two together constituting the fundamental elements of visual narrative presenting history without interpretation. The opposite approach was implemented in Otto Erich Deutch's <Franz Schubert: Sein Leben in Bildern> (München/Leipzig, 1913), which is the first attempt to fully present biography of a composer with images. O.E.D. contextualized Schubert the best he could, showing besides his portraits all he was able to find that had been related to Schubert and could document his biography.\n\nWith the advancement of printing techniques toward the end of the 19th century, illustrations in books became more affordable and reproduced in a better quality. This evolution led in the early 20th century to the publication of surveys of music history in pictures, among which a special place have the two general histories of music: Gustav Kanth’s <Bilder-Atlas zur Musikgeschichte von Bach bis Strauss> (Berlin, 1911) and Georg Kinsky’s <Geschichte der Musik in Bildern> (Leipzig, 1929). A study of their discourses on one hand documents the initial attempts to use visual material in presentation of music history, and on the other eloquently demonstrates how German musicology constructed the historical canon which had a critical influence at the time. Kanth’s <Bilder-Atlas> assumed that <Musikgeschichte> is exclusively a German matter and he placed all other European composers under the heading \"Das Ausland\". Kinsky did include pictures of non-Western musical instruments, but eight plates (out of 352) represent only a passing remark within his discourse. Kinsky viewed German music as the central point of his narrative, and a variety of foreign musicians are all presented under the heading \"Deutschland\". In his visual museum Kanth made an extensive use of portraits of composers and facsimiles of their handwriting, leaving all other visual sources to the minimum. Such an approach was not satisfactory to Kinsky and he expended the presented material to images of instruments, theater sets, music notations, and various forms of music making. Such different approaches demonstrate how at the time of the Great European War occurred a certain turn in understanding of pictorial sources documenting music history. Kanth might have been still influenced by theories about the relationship between physical appearance of the person and his/her spiritual qualities, and in his narrative was focusing on appearances of composers. His approach was still looking backward to the 18th-c. tradition of collecting portraits (C.P.E. Bach, Padre Martini, E.L. Gerber) and the view that portraits are the main visual aid for understanding traits of music history. Kinsky on the other hand (similarly like Otto Erich Deutsch in his Schubert iconography, 1913) was on the forefront of introducing a much broader concept in which all visual sources are equally relevant.\n\nA bibliography listing, in chronological order by date of first appearance, all music periodicals issued in Croatia, plus one Croatian-language periodical published outside Croatia. Provided for each periodical are: (1) the title(s) in the original language and in English translation; (2) the number in Imogen Fellinger's <Verzeichnis der Musikzeitschriften des 19. Jahrhunderts>, or the International Standard Serial Number; (3) information about the time-span of the periodical's publication and the number of volumes issued; (4) the frequency and total number of issues published; (5) the publisher; (6) the editor(s); (7) an indication of whether the periodical included musical supplements; (8) the shelf number in the Nacionalna i Sveučilišna Knijžnica (NSK) in Zagreb and the Narodna in Univerzitetna Knijžnica (NUK) in Ljubljana; (9) the editorial address for current issues; (10) the language of the text, if not Croatian; and (11) a commentary on the contents.\n\nThis collective monograph, titled Kosta P. Manojlović and the Idea of Slavic and Balkan Cultural Unificaton (1918–1941), is the result of research by fourteen scholars from Russia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Portugal, Great Britain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia, which were partly presented at an international conference organized by the Muzikološki institut SANU [Institute of Musicology SASA] in November 2016. Kosta P. Manojlović (1890–1946) is one of the most important Serbian musicians and musical intellectuals of the interwar period. His musical activities were diverse and fuitful. As a composer, he was a proponent of the “national style”, which was primarily reflected in choral music. In this domain he left pieces of lasting value, such as Sever duva [The North Wind blows] for the mixed choir. His melographic and ethnomusicological work dedicated to Serbian musical folklore is of great significance. He was a pioneer of Serbian musical historiography and a proliferous critic who collaborated with numerous journals and dailies from Yugoslavia and abroad."
