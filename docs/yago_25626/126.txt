FILM SERIES

JACQUES DOILLON: L’EMOTION (Tuesday) A two-month series of Tuesday screenings devoted to the work of Mr. Doillon  one of the most creative members of the generation of French filmmakers that emerged in the aftermath of the New Wave  begins with a double bill. Anne Brochet and Françoise Dumas’s 1998 documentary, “Jacques Doillon: Words and Emotion,” is paired with Mr. Doillon’s 1985 “Family Life,” a vivid, messy account of a father (Sami Frey) and his attempts to repair his relationship with his 10-year-old daughter (Mara Goyet) from his first marriage. At 12:30, 4 and 7:30 p.m., French Institute/Alliance Française, Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-6100, fiaf.org, $10. (Dave Kehr)

‘FTA’ (Monday) Jane Fonda will be present for a discussion after this rare screening of Francine Parker’s 1972 documentary, which follows Ms. Fonda, Donald Sutherland, Holly Near and other performers on a sort of alternative-U.S.O. tour of military bases in the United States and around the Pacific rim. The title stands either for “Free the Army” or a saltier expression, depending on the context. At 7 p.m., IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com; $15. (Kehr)

GREAT FILMS OF 1939 (Sunday) As part of Symphony Space’s cultural survey, “The 1939 Project,” a series of films drawn from that banner year in movie history begins with Ernst Lubitsch’s political comedy “Ninotchka” (at 2 and 7 p.m.) and the social documentary “The City” (at 4:30 p.m.), directed by Ralph Steiner and Willard Van Dyke. Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $11. (Kehr)

ANGELA RICCI LUCCHI AND YERVANT GIANIKIAN, A RETROSPECTIVE (Monday and Wednesday) Based in Turin, Italy, Ms. Lucchi and Mr. Gianikian have been creating stunning and often disturbing montage films based on “found” newsreel, travelogue and medical footage. They include subjects like the wages of colonialism; the aftermath of war; the essence of fascist ideology; and the various pseudo-sciences human beings have invented to enslave themselves. The filmmakers will be present for Monday’s 7 p.m. screening of their recent “Ghiro ghiro tondo,” which explores the war-torn terrain of the Dolomite region in northeast Italy through images of broken toys. They will also attend Wednesday’s 8 p.m. presentation of the early (1981) “Karagoez: Catalogue 9.5,” which samples and reassembles a collection of 9.5-millimeter show-at-home movies assembled between 1900 and 1928. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. (Kehr)

MOVIES

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

‘AUSTRALIA’ (PG-13, 2:35) Baz Luhrmann’s creation story about modern Australia is a pastiche of genres and references wrapped up into one horse-galloping, cattle-stampeding, camera-swooping, music-swelling widescreen package. Hugh Jackman gives the film oomph; a wonderfully expressive Nicole Kidman gives it a performance. (Manohla Dargis)

‘BEDTIME STORIES’ (PG, 1:38) “I don’t believe in happy endings,” says Skeeter (Adam Sandler), a resentful hotel handyman, to his young niece and nephew. Luckily his director, Adam Shankman, loves them, dragging Skeeter and the rest of the cast through a variety of threadbare fantasies  an Old West showdown, a medieval joust  that fail to juice a movie soured by uninspired writing and an enervated star. And if there were an Oscar for miscasting, Guy Pearce’s atrocious turn as the hotel’s pompous manager would be a lock. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

‘BRIDE WARS’ (PG, 1:34) Die, Bridezilla, die! (Dargis)

★ ‘CADILLAC RECORDS’ (R, 1:48) This rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues serves as a group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists, including Muddy Waters (the impressive Jeffrey Wright), Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles). This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that’s just fine. (A. O. Scott)

‘CALIFORNIA DREAMIN’ ’ (No rating, 2:35, in Romanian, English, Spanish and Italian) When the Romanian director Cristian Nemescu died in 2006 at 27, he left behind a handful of brilliant shorts and this feature, which won a prize in Cannes the next year. Longer than it might have been had he lived to trim it, the movie is an incisive satire of cultural collision. In 1999 a company of American soldiers (led by Armand Assante) is stranded in a Romanian backwater on its way to Kosovo, and the men’s sojourn is marked by sex, violence, chaos, absurdity and a queasy sense of the pleasures and catastrophes of an American-dominated global order. (Scott)

‘CHANDNI CHOWK TO CHINA’ (PG-13, 2:20, in Hindi, Cantonese and Mandarin) The immensely popular Akshay Kumar stars in this genial mash-up of Bollywood and kung fu. Too frantic at the beginning, “Chandni” settles down to become an enjoyable if slight Saturday matinee picture. It was financed and distributed by Warner Brothers, a first for Bollywood. (Rachel Saltz)

‘CHE’ (R, 4:17, in Spanish and English) Nearly four and a half hours long and spanning more than a decade, “Che” surely deserves the overworked, frequently misapplied label of epic. But it’s a narrow epic, and while Benicio Del Toro, in the title role, offers a performance that’s technically flawless, the movie is politically naïve and dramatically inert. (Scott)

‘THE CLASS’ (No rating, 2:08, in French, with English subtitles) An artful, intelligent, heartfelt fiction film from the director Laurent Cantet about modern French identity and the attempt to transform young students of all sizes, shapes and colors into citizens through talk, talk, talk. (Dargis)

‘CRIPS AND BLOODS: MADE IN AMERICA’ (No rating, 1:45) The director Stacy Peralta tracks the history of violent Los Angeles gangs with heart in his well-intended documentary, but not enough intellectual skepticism. (Dargis)

‘THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON’ (PG-13, 2:47) A hothouse blossom of romance, intrigue and breathtaking digital effects from David Fincher (“Zodiac,” “Fight Club”). Brad Pitt stars as a man who ages backward, but it is Cate Blanchett who provides the film’s delicate, graceful emotional center of gravity. (Scott)

‘DOUBT’ (PG-13, 1:44) Adapted by John Patrick Shanley from his stage play, this drama about a Roman Catholic priest suspected of child molestation stars a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman as the accused and an energetic, often wackily comic Meryl Streep as his accuser. (Dargis)

‘FROST/NIXON’ (R, 2:02) It’s twinkle (Michael Sheen) versus glower (Frank Langella) in Ron Howard’s amusing, facile edition of the Peter Morgan theatrical smackdown. (Dargis)

‘FROZEN RIVER’ (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt’s powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. (Stephen Holden)

★ ‘GRAN TORINO’ (R, 1:56) Once again Clint Eastwood shows everyone how it’s done, with a sleek muscle car of a movie set in that industrial graveyard called Detroit about a racist who befriends a besieged Hmong family next door. (Dargis)

★ ‘HAPPY-GO-LUCKY’ (R, 1:58) Happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and for the bopping bloom at the center of Mike Leigh’s generous, expansive new film  a gurgling stream of giggles, laughs and words played by a glorious Sally Hawkins  it’s also a question of faith. (Dargis)

‘HOTEL FOR DOGS’ (PG, 1:40) Children and dogs: those two magic words distill the appeal of this cuter-than-cute, sweeter-than-sweet family film about animal-loving kids who embark on a crusade to rescue all the stray pooches in a fictional city. (Holden)

‘INKHEART’ (PG, 1:43) A movie about books coming to life that never manages to do so itself. (Scott)

‘JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY’ (No rating, 1:40, in Danish) As this twisty Danish thriller zigzags between austere realism and surreal gore, you have the not unpleasant sense of being taken for a ride. It may not go anywhere in particular, but it is as exciting as a trip through a well-equipped, scary fun house. (Holden)

‘LAST CHANCE HARVEY’ (PG, 1:38) Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson don’t make a lot of sense as a screen couple, but there’s something irresistible about watching two people fall in love, even in contrived, sniffle- and sometimes gag-inducing films like this one. (Dargis)

★ ‘LET THE RIGHT ONE IN’ (No rating, 1:54, in Swedish) A charming and chilling Swedish love story directed by Tomas Alfredson about a lonely boy and the girl next door who may just happen to be a vampire. (Dargis)

★ ‘MAN ON WIRE’ (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit’s 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh’s beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)

‘MARLEY AND ME’ (PG, 2:05) The bland, obsequious screen adaptation of John Grogan’s best-selling 2005 memoir of his up-and-down relationship with an unruly Labrador retriever has a surefire tear-jerker ending. But the bond between human and pet and what they can learn from each other remains unexplored. (Holden)

★ ‘MILK’ (R, 2:08) Gus Van Sant’s film about Harvey Milk (1930-78), the San Francisco City supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the country, is less a standard biopic than a sharp, lyrical history lesson, touching not only on a crucial decade in the gay-rights movement but also on the rough and tumble of big-city politics and the tricky ways of love. Sean Penn outdoes himself as Milk, balancing his intense conviction with an unusual and welcome playfulness. The large supporting cast is also excellent, and includes James Franco as Milk’s lover and campaign manager, Scott Smith, and Josh Brolin as Dan White, Milk’s colleague on the Board of Supervisors and also his murderer. (Scott)

★ ‘MOSCOW, BELGIUM’ (No rating, 1:42, in Flemish) You may have observed the characters’ banal situations in countless other movies, not to mention in your own life, but it is unusual to find them explored with such matter-of-fact truthfulness. (Holden)

‘MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D’ (R, 1:41) Adding an extra dimension to the fondly remembered 1981 Canadian slasher about a rogue slayer in a small mining town, “My Bloody Valentine 3D” blends cutting-edge technology and old-school prosthetics to produce gore you can believe in. And if the gas-masked villain is less than terrifying, his pursuit of a naked young woman (Betsy Rue) is inspired. If there were an award for acting full-frontally while wearing sky-high stilettos, Ms. Rue would surely teeter away with it. (Catsoulis)

‘NOT EASILY BROKEN’ (PG-13, 1:39) Directed by Bill Duke and based on a novel by the megachurch minister T. D. Jakes, this story of a marriage under stress is hokey and sometimes clumsy, but anchored in an earnest engagement with the lives of its characters, who have the good fortune of being portrayed by a fine cast. (Scott)

‘NOTORIOUS’ (R, 2:02) The legend of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper who was murdered in 1997, is given the full epic-melodrama-biopic treatment in this uneven, rarely dull film, among whose producers are Smalls’s mother, Violetta Wallace, and his friend and mentor Sean Combs. Those two important figures are played by Angela Bassett and Derek Luke, while Smalls is impersonated by Jamal Woolard, whose faithful mimicry compensates for some of his limitations as an actor. (Scott)

★ ‘OF TIME AND THE CITY’ (No rating, 1:14) Terrence Davies’s first documentary is a lyrical, barbed reminiscence of postwar Liverpool, in which the nostalgic charm of archival footage flickers in tense counterpoint with Mr. Davies’s rueful, barbed narration. (Scott)

‘PAUL BLART: MALL COP’ (PG, 1:30) Fat people are funny. Fat people who run into things are funnier. Fat people who run into things and have humiliating working-class jobs? Stop, you’re killing me! (Nathan Lee)

★ ‘RACHEL GETTING MARRIED’ (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel’s wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you’ll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)

‘THE READER’ (R, 2:03) You have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and also asks us to pity a death camp guard. Kate Winslet plays the guard; Stephen Daldry directs. (Dargis)

‘REVOLUTIONARY ROAD’ (R, 1:59) Sam Mendes directs Kate Winslet and a fine Leonardo DiCaprio in a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage in the mid-1950s. (Dargis)

‘SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE’ (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (“Trainspotting”) about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)

★ ‘SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK’ (R, 2:04) To say that Charlie Kaufman’s feature debut is one of the best films of the year or even the one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it in right now. (In other words: Go!) (Dargis)

★ ‘TELL NO ONE’ (No rating, 2:05, in French) In the shortcut language of a movie pitch, Guillaume Canet’s delicious contemporary thriller is “Vertigo” meets “The Fugitive” by way of “The Big Sleep.” This French adaptation of Harlan Coben’s 2001 best seller (same name) is the kind of conspiracy-minded mystery almost no one seems capable of creating anymore, except David Lynch in his surreal way. Beautifully written and acted, it is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost. (Holden)

‘TROUBLE THE WATER’ (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about that natural and unnatural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis)
