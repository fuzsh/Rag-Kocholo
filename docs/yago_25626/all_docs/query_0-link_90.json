        "text": "Navy Seals\n\nCharlie Sheen, Michael Biehn, and Joanne Whalley-Kilmer in a beefcake thriller about the clandestine operations of the navy commando unit called the SEALs. It is also, says the publicity with an apparently straight face, “the story of courageous young men who conquer challenging, death-defying obstacles to help America take charge of its destiny.” Thanks a […]\n\nPoitin\n\nDesigned as a deliberate attack on Hollywood’s image of Ireland, Bob Quinn’s Gaelic-language feature (the first) stars Cyril Cusack as a backwoods moonshiner (“poitin” is the name of the brew) who is double-crossed by two of his salesmen and sets out for revenge. Chicago premiere (1978).\n\nIf I Were King\n\nPreston Sturges wrote the script for this 1938 costume drama chronicling the exploits of vagabond poet Francois Villon in 15th-century Paris, and its wisecracking dialogue, targeting spoiled courtiers and rascally commoners alike, provides most of the film’s brio. Ronald Colman, looking a bit long in the tooth for his role, plays the rabble-rousing Villon, who’s […]\n\nChildren of the Revolution\n\nFor a notion of how cockeyed the cold war and its aftermath look to an Australian, this bubbly comedy, written and directed by newcomer Peter Duncan, is a good place to start. Judy Davis plays a fervent Australian communist who writes passionate letters to Stalin in the early 50s, is invited to the Soviet Union […]\n\nA Bag of Marbles\n\n1975\n\nGoing By\n\nThe road movie is a favored genre among Iranian filmmakers, and this fitfully engaging debut feature by Iraj Karimi follows the passengers in four different cars as they head north from Tehran to the Caspian Sea. Angst is the prevalent mood among these mostly well-off urbanites, whose existential ramblings and faintly Western sentiments are punctuated […]\n\nPort of Call\n\nAn early Ingmar Bergman feature (1948) about a troubled young woman (Nine-Christine Jonsson) and her relationship with a seaman (Bengt Eklund), generally considered minor. With Berta Hall, Erik Hell, and Mimi Nelson.\n\nRambo: First Blood Part II\n\nCamp director George Pan Cosmatos (The Cassandra Crossing, Escape to Athena) may have seemed an odd choice to film this sequel to Ted Kotcheff’s First Blood, but the producers clearly wanted someone who could zoom into the cliche heart of every scene: the picture seems deliberately trite, blunt, and manipulative, as if the producers didn’t […]\n\nShining Through\n\nMelanie Griffith plays a half-Jewish secretary in Queens in 1940, working for a lawyer (Michael Douglas) who turns out to be doing secret work for the OSS. She gets romantically involved with him and winds up in Germany working undercover inside the home of a high-ranking Nazi official. Adapted by director David Seltzer (Lucas, Punchline) […]\n\nWall\n\nShot on video and transferred to 35-millimeter, this 2004 documentary by Simone Bitton is a leisurely study of the Israeli security wall now under construction. The film unfolds mostly in extended long shots of the landscape, with commentary from Jews and Palestinians, most of them standing offscreen out of concern for their safety. Intercut with […]\n\nThatched Memories\n\nSet in a Chinese village shortly before the firestorm of the Cultural Revolution, this memory film by Geng Xu focuses on a grade school largely untainted by Maoist zeal and more concerned with solid education and extracurricular competitions. Its narrator, the puckish Sang sang, lives in the school compound with his doting mother and his […]\n\nFun Down There\n\nA bored young gay man leaves upstate New York for Manhattan’s East Village, where he encounters sex, friendship, and street smarts. Roger Stigliano directed.\n\nJerusalem, the Holy City, Part II\n\nA video examining the history of Jerusalem from the time of King David to the present, including an on-location with Elie Wiesel.\n\nMy American Girls: A Dominican Story\n\nThis 2000 video documentary by Aaron Matthews profiles the Ortizes, a family of immigrants in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. The parents toil as hospital custodians, the eldest daughter studies at Columbia University, and the youngest daughter is friendly and socially active. Matthews needn’t have cornered them in the middle of a family crisis, but he seems […]\n\nClive of India\n\nRonald Colman stars as Robert Clive, the military and political adventurer who brought British rule to India, in this 1935 feature directed by Richard Boleslawski. With Loretta Young, Cesar Romero, Colin Clive, Leo G. Carroll, and Don Ameche. 90 min.\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nA four-part documentary made for public television.\n\nAmerican Avant-garde of the Sixties\n\nA program of four key works by four major experimental filmmakers: Kenneth Anger’s Scorpio Rising (1963), Paul Sharit’s T.O.U.C.H.-\n\nWhen Nature Calls\n\nThe trailers released by Troma Entertainment are often funnier than the movies themselves: they’re not burdened by the niceties of plot or character development, and they can shoehorn in more pop-culture references. This anthology film, frankly modeled after Kentucky Fried Movie, begins with several hilarious coming attractions, including a dead-on Scorsese spoof titled Raging Bullshit. […]\n\nRemember the Titans\n\nSet in the early 1970s, before all men became brothers, this self-congratulatory saga of a Virginia town facing integration on the gridiron is said to be based on actual events. It might be fun to guess what they were. Did the square-jawed white coach obliged to subordinate himself to a black interloper actually have a […]\n\nGodzilla vs. the Smog Monster\n\nThe giant lizard turns eco-hero, battling a monster created from industrial waste. Yoshimitu Banno directed this 1971 Japanese film, also known as Godzilla vs. Hedora. 87 min.\n\nWhat Did You Do in the War, Daddy?\n\nA service comedy by Blake Edwards, who has made some of the best (The Perfect Furlough, Operation Petticoat). The scene is an Italian village in the waning months of World War II, where Dick Shawn and James Coburn are trying to have a good time in spite of periodic interruptions by the Nazis. Edwards has […]\n\nConcerto for the Right Hand\n\nWorking almost entirely without dialogue, Michael Bartlett’s first feature, made in West Berlin, sounds like a very strange black comedy indeed. A park cleaner adopts a department store mannequin as his sole companion, but loses the mannequin’s right arm. A boutique owner who used to play concert piano finds it and uses it to replace […]\n\nSecurity Unlimited\n\nMichael Hui directs and stars with his brothers Ricky and Sam in a typically broad and frenetic but hilarious Hong Kong farce about the misadventures of three security guards. The plot is rather episodic, but some of the pieces—such as a bank robbery and an attempt to burglarize an exhibition of Chinese antiquities—are classics of […]\n\nSpike and Mike’s Sick & Twisted Festival of Animation 2000\n\nTwenty-one animated shorts. Some of the animators include David Lipson, Roy T. Wood, Bill Plympton, Greg Kovacs, Thomas Kung, Jonas Odell (from Sweden), and Konstantin Bronzit (from Russia).\n\n101 Classic Commercials\n\nCompila-"
