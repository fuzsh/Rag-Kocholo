        "text": "Born in Paris in 1944, Jacques Doillon was part of a movement, the Second New Wave in France along with Philippe Garrel, Maurice Pialat, Jean Eustache and Andrè Tèchinè. Doillon like Garrel has often uses minimal narrative situations based on domestic issues (relationships, drug or alcohol abuse), starring sometimes himself and members of his family. The distribution of Doillon’s films don’t often travel to many countries apart from France. Not surprisingly his films are underseen and little written about. With his double header in 1979 The Hussy and The Crying Woman there are tight bound settings; houses in provincial France (the bare essentials) with few characters, most of them eccentric loners battling arrogant counterparts (The Crying Woman). In the case of The Hussy we see Doillon’s fascination with child characters, children are given as much freedom as possible as actors. Other examples include A Bag of Marbles, La vie de famille, The 15 Year Old Girl, Le petit criminel, Le jeune Werther, Ponette, Petits Freres and Un Enfant de toi.\n\nWithin the mix of Doillon’s characters is a desire for these fantasy three-way relationships; (The Crying Woman and The Three-Way Wedding), at times theatrical in terms of acting and storytelling whereby Doillon finds the essence of the said films as a whole, through intimate investigations of the characters played by actors Doillon knows well. We trust in him to bring us that sense of cinema; faces through a reflecting window in The Crying Woman, the intimate camera placements in Le petit criminel. His young actors perhaps see him as an uncle type (or natural father in the cases of Lola and Lou Doillon) who nurtures their talent, they trust him and feel safe in this environment. Doillon trusts them to carry to the weight of a said film through with a command, body language and anxiety ridden gesture.\n\nPonette is Doillon’s most internationally acclaimed film. It concerns a four year old who lost her mother and believes she has resurrected. Michael Dwyer for The Irish Times gave no insight into the film, choosing to be more interested with the child psychologist Doillon had on the set for guidance. Dwyer’s lack of insight is a shame as this was a rare opportunity for the Irish public to hear of Jacques Doillon and his films. Giving the film a service seems to be beyond Dwyer as he wrestles with his own moral judgement over whether the film should actually have been made. The serious-minded but achingly slow-moving’ film Dwyer experienced makes sense if you’ve seen Doillon’s films; its pacing, its hazy autumn look, the lack of close-ups, Doillon’s ‘kids as kids’ approach which Kent Jones describes so well. The world as kids see it is Doillon’s major achievement. 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol’s remarkable performance won her the Volpi Cup (Best Actress) at the 1996 Venice Film Festival, that’s how astonishing she was and how it was received at the time. Joanna Di Matti (Senses of Cinema argues ‘In Ponette, the camera is tethered so intimately to the four-year-old girl that when adults enter the frame, they tend to upset the delicate emotional ecosystem Doillon has established.’ The world through Ponette’s eyes, her friends and family with their contradictory information, it’s a view of the world as it is with the sense of divine wonder at the film’s conclusion.\n\nPetits frèrès is set in the Paris projects like La haine, it concerns the simple story of a girl who wants to find her dog who has been taken by a gang of kids. The summer light, the poverty and boredom of these kids with little prospects on the outskirts of society, the boys try to impress girls with holding a gun sideways like Pacino. Tony McKibbin (2012) argues ‘Children, or more specifically often teenagers in Doillon, are observed in their specifics, in their concerns, rather than ours, ours as paying viewers demanding certain narrative actions’. Emotional strain and rupture much like Le petit criminel which concerns a young teenager who practically apologises for having to rob a pharmacy and whose situation gets more intense, it all revolves around simple things; getting to meet his sister for the first time in another town (Montpeller) and getting his name changed to his father’s. His motives are sound, but his means test the authorities and himself, much like a young Dardenne character. The idle camera watching the dramatic events; as dramatic turns to melodramatic the jazz score is relevantly silent, our three characters pushed to their limits, a close-up is always one of sorrowful desperation. Richard Anconina’s detective’s practical manner, caring nature, sunlight through his car aligning shadow on his face. The day to day pressures of being a cop particularity in Doillon’s world of the immediate irrational scenario. Gèrald Thomassin’s Marc our protagonist trapped behind glass in the car calling the shots for the first half of the film. In the second half Nathanael Hood (Mubi) notes ‘Marc always seems to be in the periphery of shots, a hazy blur in the background or a white dot on the edge of the frame.’ After they have left the car in the last third, Doillon’s focuses on Thomassin’s in close-ups as Marc tries to refine and give himself a new self-definition. Clotilde Coureau’s Nathalie is real outsider of the story disconnected from the environment of Sète where the film begins. Her actions are also the melodramatic turning point, she is most emotional as she tries to connect with her brother for the first time. All of the characters are very caring amidst such threat of violence. The final shot, a dissolving reflection through what looks like a window is white, a fading glimpse of hope.\n\nDoillon’s films often show humanity in small moments; a girl crying over having a robbed a young couple, kids staging a mock wedding (Petits frèrès). Sami Frey’s character in La vie de famille is quite overbearing, he is a womanizer who spends the weekend with his daughter who criticises him whilst trying to understand him. The scenes of them in the car with the rural landscape is given care and precision, Frey’s character depends on himself, his family on him, quite a lot to ask of a man who would probably struggle to look in a mirror. He lasts a mere few seconds when put face to face with his video camera (he is a filmmaker).\n\nLe jeune Werther, Doillon’s best film concerns a group of teenage friends dealing with a friend’s suicide. Paris has seldom looked so deserted as the teenagers walk through it pondering their lost friend. The intimate camera placements; the kids in mid-shot, ‘teachers don’t know anything’ one of them says. The kids philosophising recalls Eric Rohmer. Dan Sallitt (Mubi) argues ‘Rohmer may seem similar at first glance, but I think he’s really completely different. All that dialogue in Doillon’s film is crucial: it bears all the film’s feeling. With Rohmer, the effect is more indirect. What the characters say in a Rohmer film isn’t really the film: the film doesn’t emerge until the idea-world that the characters construct is juxtaposed with the too too solid reality of Rohmer’s spaces, of the soundtrack, of the documentary he’s always making about the world around his people.’ The alienation of life for these youngsters, who unlike those in Petits frères have potential based on their middle-class background, though pressures of life catch up with you wherever you are in the world. The question of potential of course is more a question of class in certain aspects like society’s view, assumptions are made to be broken. Within the analysisng of the cause of their friend Guillaume’s death comes obsession with a girl who Guillaume liked. She is followed, who sent you she asks ‘a ghost’ is the reply. It becomes an investigation out of Jean-Pierre Melville in precision or even Tsai ming-liang is the quiet scenes of the stalking. There’s a POV of the girl’s neck, an unusually intimate moment. Are you part of a gang she asks. As if she assumes Guillaume’s death must be related to a youth violent lifestyle. Di Mattia (Senses of Cinema) notes ‘Young Werther’s action is reduced primarily to what is happening between Ismael and his friends, rendered with such vivid intensity that it becomes, convincingly, an entire microcosm of life itself.’\n\nIn Le jeune Werther Doillon uses no background chatter as the streets are fairly empty, the birds sing, the world is open and wide like the beautiful old Parisian school these kids go to, it’s a safe place. Doillon like in all his movies gives time; the funeral, city and playground discussions and mournful thoughts by a graveside. A house party brings about a realisation in the protagonist Ismaël (Ismaël Jolè-Mènèbhi), a realisation to move on but never forget how awful but also how eye-opening it was to be a teenager. Doillon as Sallitt (Mubi) argues is in all of his characters, they exist to question the nature of how we live and think and feel amidst often erratic and sombre circumstances.\n\n___________________________\n\n© Peter Larkin"
