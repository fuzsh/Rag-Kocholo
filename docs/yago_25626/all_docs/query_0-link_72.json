        "text": "I'm very lucky that I come from a very, very beautiful family [Doillon is the daughter of Jane Birkin and sister of Charlotte Gainsbourg]. Everyone was so beautiful, stylish and serious in our house when I was growing up. I was the funny one - I wore skirts in crazy colours, petticoats, silly hats and scarves. I'd dress up in weird shoes and my dad's jacket to make them laugh. Humour like this is where English and French style differs, I think. In England you laugh at yourselves, in France we laugh at others. I still keep a sense of humour about my style even now. I had a laughing fit when I was modelling on the Missoni catwalk - it all felt so surreal and ridiculous - and I had to be helped off.\n\nI am working on a film in America at the moment and I love New York style. This is a place where anything goes, and no one cares or judges. I go out in my enormous hat, dressed as a boy, with a fake moustache and people say, 'What a lovely moustache!' My style has changed since I was younger. I was kind of ashamed of my bourgeois family as a teenager, I guess - I had dreadlocks, shopped in thrift stores and pretended I had no money. At that time, I would have spat on a girl who was buying Yves Saint Laurent. I always laugh today thinking if I ran into my younger self, she would slap me. Wearing designer clothes was like selling my soul to the devil.\n\nI still keep some rebellion in the way I dress now - I always start the day dancing to rock'n'roll. One of my fashion mottos is: 'It's better not to look your best so that people can imagine that the best is really much better.' I like contrasts. I wear elaborately dressed hair with a bare face or full make-up with messy, unkempt hair. My mother taught me to wash my hair as little as possible, and to rinse it with Coke before a shoot for a sexy, tousled look.\n\nI shop at flea markets and don't choose clothes based on labels. For ready-to-wear, I do like Ann Demeulemeester, Maison Martin Margiela and Tsumori Chisato, and Christian Lacroix, Jean Paul Gaultier and John Galliano for haute-couture. But I try to give my clothes broader meaning and associations beyond fashion. I remember buying a Jean Paul Gaultier cardigan because it reminded me of L'Absinthe by Degas, or I'll get inspired by a Schiele image and put on thigh-high green socks and no one will get it.\n\nMy style has a lot of cultural references, and so does my collection for Lee Cooper. The autumn/winter collection is based on The Kid, the 1921 Charlie Chaplin movie. There are high waists and tight shoulders, with either fairly short or extremely long sleeves. I like highlighting what I find sensual in a woman - the wrists, shoulder blades, the hips - and I love creating my perfect pair of jeans. They were the first jeans brand to have the guts to be fun, which was what drew me to them. I have a history with Lee Cooper too. My mum did some ultra-sexy ads for them in the Seventies and Serge was a fan as well. I have been looking on YouTube at their old ads, they're extremely funny. I remember the Jean-Paul Goude ones particularly - he was also responsible for Grace Jones's look in the Eighties and did all her videos.\n\nI have many heroes when it comes to style. I love Jeanne Moreau in Jules et Jim, Audrey Hepburn wearing simple leggings and ballerina flats, young Brigitte Bardot on her Vespa, Kate Moss's iconic simplicity... Growing up, though, my hero was my grandmother. Her name was Judy Campbell. She was an actress and Noel Coward's muse. She always had an 'emergency kit' to hand: a handbag containing lipstick and a bottle of Chanel No 5.\n\nMy mother and I have a typical mother-daughter relationship about clothes. I used to dress up a lot to go against her easy-going look but recently I borrowed her Yves Saint Laurent blouse. Charlotte, my sister, is obsessed with fashion. She has a more conventionally chic style than me. The next generation of my family are stylish too. My six-year-old son is my real style icon. He likes to have fun with fashion, especially wearing his dad's clothes.\n\nWhen I was growing up, I had women who were quite masculine in their style, and some quite feminine men in Serge and my father, Jacques Doillon. I hate short hair on men - the 'real' man is something I don't know. My dad was always playing with hairbands, making rings, while the women were wearing jeans, white T-shirts and Converse. That was the uniform at home.\n\nMaybe this is why I love jeans. I treasure my first pair from the Seventies: they originally belonged to my mother and have massive bell-bottoms. Jeans also feature in my first fashion memory. As a child, I used to hide under the table with my dog while my mother welcomed the bohemia from Paris for dinner. From this vantage point, I saw only the legs of the guests - all wearing jeans. It's an image that has stayed with me to this day."
