Among the many films about the Titanic, it has long been regarded as the high point by Titanic historians and survivors alike for its accuracy, despite its modest production values when compared with the 1997 Oscar-winning film Titanic, Nightwatching (2007) – Canada, I heard a lecture of the film's director Peter Greenaway at the Haifa Film Festival, Nine to Five/9 to 5 (1980) - US, Ninotchka (1939) – US, Greta Garbo is charming in this comedy and for the first time she does not play like a diva, Nobody Knows (2004) – Japan, No Country for Old Men (2007) – US, No Man's Land (2001) – Bosnia and Herzegovina, Norma Rae (1979) – US, North by Northwest (1959) - US, Notorious (1946) - US, Notre-Dame de Paris/The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1956) – France, (1939) - US, Novecento/Twentieh Century (1976) – Italy, Novia que te vea (1994) – Mexico in Ladino and Spanish about Sephardic Jews, I was thrilled to read a book and watch a film in my mother tongue Ladino, Nowhere in Africa/Nirgendwo in Afrika (2001) – Germany, Nuit et brouillard/Night and Fog (1955) - France, one of the best films on the Holocaust, I have included in my list many such films.\n\nO – O Brother Where Art Thou?

(1968) – UK, Once (2006) – Ireland, Once upon a time in America (1984) - US, Once Upon a Time in Anatolia (2011) – Turkey, once not so far ago, we used to \"denigrate\" Turkish films as telenovela films, ridiculous, with an idiotic plot, and second rate acting, and many Israeli, Arabic, and Indian films were not much better, but recently Turkish films have become in many cases masterpieces, with the best directors, scriptwriters, actors, and actresses, I am always supportive of such renaissance, that has happened also to Israeli films, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) - US, One Two Three (1961) – US, On ne badine pas avec l'amour (1978) – France, On the Town (1949) – US, On the Waterfront (1954) - US, Orfeu Negro/Black Orpheus (1959) – Brazil, an excellent film, poetic, nostalgic, sad, and beautiful, Orpheus Descending (1990) – US, Othello (1952) – Italy, Other People's Money (1991) - US, The Others (2001) – Spain, Otto e Mezzo – 8½ (1963) - Italy, modern film at its best, the modern film-makers I like most are Fellini, Antonioni, Bergman, Allen, and of course the Nouvelle Vague film-makers, Outsourced (2006) - US, it was included in one of my courses.\n\nP – Paint Your Wagon (1969) – US, I enjoyed especailly the acting of Lee Marvin in this film and in Cat Ballou, which was a surprise for me as Marvin was perceived priorly only as a serious actor, and he proved in these musicals that he is multi-talented, The Pajama Game (1957) – US, Doris Day in the list of the best film? Many veinschmeckers would pity my poor taste, but I always liked Doris Day, and films like The Pajama Game were a solace and a filmotherapy when I was in a pessimistic mood, Paris Texas (1984) - Germany, Partie de campagne (1936) - France, A Passage to India (1984) – UK, The Passenger (1975) –Italy, Paths of Glory (1957) – US, The Pawnbroker (1964) – US, Pelle the Conqueror (1987) – Denmark, Pepe le Moko (1937) – France, Persona (1966) - Sweden, Phaedra (1962) – France, The Phantom of the Opera (1925) – US, The Philadelphia Story (1940) - US, The Pianist (2002) – Poland, The Piano (1993) – New Zealand, Pillow Talk (1959) – US, The Pirates of Penzance (1983) – UK, A Place in the Sun (1951) - US, Plein Soleil/Purple Noon (1960) – France, The Policeman (1971) - Israel, one of the best Israeli films ever made, as Ephraim Kishon was a humorist genius in all what he made – films, plays, satires, books.

With two excellent actresses – Penelope Cruz and Carmen Maura. Drawing inspiration from the Italian neorealism of the late 1940s to early 1950s and the work of pioneering directors such as Federico Fellini, Luchino Visconti, and Pier Paolo Pasolini, Volver addresses themes like sexual abuse, loneliness and death, mixing the genres of farce, tragedy, melodrama, and magic realism, Voyage of the Damned (1976) – UK, Vu du pont/A View from the Bridge (1962) – France,\n\nW – Wadjda (2012) – Saudi Arabia in Arabic, an excellent film indeed, very interesting and moving, Walk on Water/Lalekhet al hamayim (2004) – Israel, Wall-E (2008) – US, Wall Street (1987) - US, one of the best films that I have ever seen first of all because the excellent actor Michael Douglas – Gordon Gekko, who has become the ultimate capitalist maximizing profits to the delight of Milton Friedman and ruinging the lives of all the others, as in the neoliberal regimes that I oppose so much. This was the backbone of my courses on business ethics as it gives in a nutshell most of the dilemmas of business, War and Peace (1956) – US, War and Remembrance (1988) – US, this film and The Winds of War are the best films that I have ever seen on the inter-world wars and the second world war, a very long saga, but interesting and thrilling from the beginning to the end, The War of the Worlds (1953) – US, Washington Square (1997) – US, Water (2005) – India, The Weeping Meadow (2004) – Greece, West Side Story (1961) - US, in the same decade I saw this excellent film and saw the musical on Broadway in June 1968, the first musical that I have seen in the US, Whale Rider (2002) – New Zealand, When Father Was Away On Business (1985) – Serbia, When Harry Met Sally… (1989) – US, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

An American science fiction thriller film directed by Rob Bowman.\n\nY - Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) - US, an American biographical musical film about George M. Cohan, known as \"The Man Who Owned Broadway\". He is considered the father of American musical comedy. James Cagney, one of my favorite actors, was a fitting choice for the role of Cohan since, like Cohan, he was an Irish-American who had been a song-and-dance man early in his career. His unique style of half-singing and half-reciting the songs, reflected the style that Cohan himself used, Y tu mama tambien/And Your Mother Too (2001) – Mexico.\n\nZ - Z (1969) - Algeria, Costa Gavras is one of my favorite directors, and this film is one of his best, I had the privilege of hearing his lecture at the Haifa Film Festival, Zelary (2003) – Czech, Zero de conduite/Zero for Conduct (1933) – France, Ziegfeld Follies (1946) – US, Zorba the Greek (1964) – UK, one of the best films I have ever seen, directed by Cypriot Michael Cacoyannis and starring Anthony Quinn, one of my favorite actors, as the title character. It is based on the novel Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, which I am still reading in Greek. The supporting cast includes Alan Bates, Lila Kedrova, Irene Papas and Sotiris Moustakas. And in the \"waiting list\" after we closed the polls we can find excellent films as The Five Pennies…\n\nThe best films in Cory's list of films amount to 830, out of which 360 are the best of the best films, 5 times better than the 72 \"virgins\" offered to the terrorists, which proves that you don't have to go to heaven in order to get your rewards on a virtuous life – you can watch 360 films which are la crème de la crème of the film industry in all countries and you get paradise on earth. All the films have links to entries in Wikipedia, IMDb, and other sites, as well as the directors, scriptwriters, actors and actresses.\n\nWhat do we have in Cory's List? Silent films and talkies, black and white and color films, widescreen and 3-D films, short films and very long films, films from all over the world, but mainly from the leading countries in quality films – US, France, UK, Italy, Sweden, Japan… More than half of the films were produced more than 50 years ago or are based on books written and works composed more than 50 years ago, which shows either that the best films are the oldies until the end of the sixties (as in songs, literature, classical music…), or that I prefer the films that I have seen in my youth until the age of 25, which probably had a stronger impact on my life. My lists are the most cosmopolitan lists of films, as truly I am interested in films from a wide variety of countries, which I see in festivals and in Israel that is more open to cosmopolitan films, literature, and music – because the Jews came from more than a hundred countries in the diaspora and we are probably the most multi-cultural country in the world. Most of the films in my lists are quality films, but there is also a high proportion of \"lesser quality\" films, which were chosen because of the impact they had on my life, and because I enjoyed them very much. The reader may notice an \"optical\" error – that the American films are much more predominant than all the other films. We have to analyze it in view of the fact that almost all the films produced in India, China, Israel, Egypt, or Russia are films about those countries only and not films about other countries, while many American films are films dealing with other countries, as the US film industry is Universal (also MGM, RKO…), and deal with other countries as The African Queen, The Life of Emile Zola, Bel Ami, Titanic, Anna Karenina, Arch of Triumph, Hans Christian Andersen, Les Miserables, Schindler's List, Rhinoceros, Exodus, To Be or Not To Be, The Diary of Anne Frank, Doctor Zhivago, Don Quixote, Gigi, The Great Dictator, Julius Caesar, Stalag 17, For Whom The Bell Tolls, An Enemy of the People, The Three Musketeers, Frida, Fanny, Irma la douce, Island in the Sun, The Sheik, The Shop Around the Corner, etc.\n\nThe films from the US amount to 379 or 46% of the total number of films in my list - 830. This percentage may seem very high but as stipulated before many of those films are truly cosmopolitan, about many other countries, as the American film industry – the largest in the world, at least in quality, is the most predominant film industry in the world. I lived most of my life in Israel, except 9 years in Egypt in my childhood, 1 year in France at Insead, and on the aggregate a few years in business, study and pleasure trips all over the world, some of the trips for one or two months. In Israel we are exposed mainly to American films, although in comparison to France, Italy or Russia, we see much more foreign films than local films in those countries, because there are many local quality films there, as compared to relatively very few Israeli films, that have become quality films only in the last decade or two. Nevertheless, in comparison to all the other lists that I have seen on the Internet, my list is the more cosmopolitan as the other lists comprise in many cases at least three quarter American films or even 100%, and in my list the American films amount to less than half. In the second place we find in my list 120 films from France, or 14% of the total number of films. This large number is objective and subjective as well – objective as I and many specialists believe that the French film industry is the best in the world, and the American percentage is much higher only because the American film industry is much larger than the French one. Subjective as I like much more French films, I was almost never disappointed by the quality of a French film, French is my mother tongue, most of the films that I have seen in my childhood in Egypt were French, and most of my business, pleasures and study trips were in Paris, where I saw many excellent French films.\n\nThe British films amount to 86 or 10% of the total number of films. The British film industry is an excellent film industry, and I think that proportionately to the total number of films produced in the country there are more excellent British films and French films than American films. The British films are also relatively more cosmopolitan and many of them deal on topics which are not British. The Italian number of films amount to 61 or 7% to the total number of films. Many Italian films are quality films, among the best in the world, and in general I can say that the best directors, scriptwriters, actors and actresses are mostly American, French, British, and Italian. This does not mean that there are not excellent film-makers in other countries as Ingmar Bergman in Sweden or Akira Kurosawa in Japan, but those are only a few in comparison to the Americans, British, French and Italians. The total percentage of those four countries in my list amounts to 77%, more than three quarters. Still, my list is more cosmopolitan than most of the other lists, as the films from the other 43 countries (in total we have 47 countries in my list), amount to almost a quarter of the total number of films. Actually, the number of countries in my list could have been much more than 50 if I had included the excellent films that I have seen at the Haifa Film Festival and elsewhere from Georgia, Chile, Peru, Thailand, Iceland, Bulgaria, Morocco, Lebanon, etc., but I had to stop somewhere the list, otherwise I would have reached easily more than 1,000 excellent films that I have seen, and indeed there are more than a thousand if we add the list of the films with business ethics content and the list of 1955-1961.\n\nThe second tier of films in my list include 9 countries with 6 to 20 films – 1% to 2% each from the total, namely – Germany – 20 (2%), Spain – 18, Israel – 15, Sweden – 14, Russia – 11, Canada – 9 (1%), Japan – 8, Denmark – 6, Poland – 6. Altogether 13% of the total. This data is somewhat subjective, and I confess – I am not a professional critic/reviewer of films, I have not seen many excellent Japanese or Russian films that were not shown in Israel, and I also don't remember very well the names of Japanese or Russian films. I have no doubt that those film industries as well as most of the other industries in this segment (Sweden with Ingmar Bergman, Poland with Kieslowski, Germany with Wim Wenders, and Spain with Almodovar) are perceived by many critics as better than the Israeli film industry, yet I have included relatively more excellent Israeli films, because I live in Israel, and I enjoy much seeing Israeli films, even if sometimes they are not the best, as I have stated above that many films in my list are not quality films but films that I have enjoyed more than the others. In Israel we see relatively less films from those countries, I see them mainly in the Film Festivals, and I am aware that I have not seen most of the best ones, at least if I compare my list to the lists on the Internet. So, 13 countries have about 90% of the total number of films, and 34 countries have only 10%.\n\nIn the third tier of countries we find films with 3-5 films, about 0.5% of the total films each: Australia – 5, Romania – 5, India – 5, Ireland – 5, China – 4, Mexico – 4, Austria – 4, Greece – 3, Argentina – 3, New Zealand – 3, South Korea – 3, Iran – 3. I am quite sure that here also there are hundreds of excellent films that I was not exposed to, mainly from India, China, South Korea and Argentina, but as I included in my list only films that I have seen they were not included. Finally, the countries with 1-2 films: Egypt, Portugal, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Turkey, Serbia, Hungary, Brazil – 2 films each. Ukraine, Slovakia, Armenia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Senegal, Belgium, Ethiopia, Norway, Finland, South Africa, Algeria, Bosnia, Afghanistan – 1 film each. And I am aware that most of the countries deserve much more, but I have not seen enough quality films from there, and even so I have much more countries in my list than others. Nevertheless, as I want to be fair to the film industries from countries other than the leading ones in my list – US, France, UK, Italy – I bring here links to Internet Lists of their best films:\n\n1.
