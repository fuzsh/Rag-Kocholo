        "text": "ENTRIES IN PART 3:\n\nWILLIAM EDWARDS\n\nLONG TIME FILM FANATIC, SYDNEY\n\nUne vie (A Woman’s Life, Stephane Brize, 2016)\n\nManchester by the Sea (Kenneth Lonergan, 2016)\n\nJackie (Pablo Larrain, 2016)\n\nO.J.: Made in America (Ezra Edelman, 2016)\n\nCall Me By Your Name (Luca Guadagnino, 2017)\n\nFashionista (Simon Rumley, 2016)\n\nThe Square (Ruben Ostlund, 2017)\n\nBlade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)\n\nNelyubov (Loveless, Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2017)\n\nFrantz (Francois Ozon, 2016)\n\nWhat a dismal year for international cinema. Most of my selections are spillovers from 2016 and to be honest the bottom 5 would be lucky to make my top ten in most years.\n\nJEREMY ELPHICK\n\nMANAGING EDITOR OF 4:3\n\nFavourite films of 2017, in no particular order\n\nMilla (Valérie Massadian, 2017)\n\nOurobouros (Basma Alsharif, 2017)\n\nCocote (Nelson Carlo De Los Santos Arias, 2017)\n\nMeteorlar (Gürcan Keltek, 2017)\n\nGood Luck (Ben Russell, 2017)\n\nQing ting zhi yan (Dragonfly Eyes, Xu Bing, 2017)\n\nMon Rot Fai (Railway Sleepers, Sompot Chidgasornpongse, 2017)\n\nLe fort des fous (Narimane Mari, 2017)\n\n24 Frames (Abbas Kiarostami, 2017)\n\nGood Time (Ben and Joshua Safdie, 2017)\n\nChauka Tell Us The Time (Behrouz Boochani, Arash Sarvestani, 2017)\n\nSpecial mentions\n\nI was lucky enough to see Der Traumhafte Weg (The Dreamed Path, Angela Schanelec, 2016) and Dao Khanong (By the Time It Gets Dark, Anocha Suwichakorngpong, 2016) again this year, in cinemas in Melbourne and Sydney respectively. The two would top my list for 2016 if I were to write it today, and the experience of seeing them again in a cinema cemented that – which I think is a testament to the space, and the value of films that reveal more lasting complexities with repeated viewings.\n\nJOHN K. EMELIANOFF\n\nMILITARY TECHNICAL CONSULTANT, SCREENPLAY ADVISOR, EDITOR, USA\n\nPerhaps the most surreally serene scene in cinema this year can be found in James Gray’s The Lost City of Z (2016), in which an explorer bumbling through an inhospitable jungle somehow encounters an opera. What a microcosm for the good cinephile’s experience in 2017 — amidst a struggle to keep away the viruses carried by powerful liars and to dodge the slings & arrows brandished by savages, occasionally we go to the theatre and encounter something sublime, something numinous that reminds us why life is maybe worth sharing with our fellow humans.\n\nMy thirteen favorite new releases arranged in three themed categories and approximate order of impact and enjoyment:\n\nFemmes Vitales\n\nAll This Panic (Jenny Gage, 2016)\n\nAround the 18 minute mark of this unprecedentedly intimate yet expansive documentary, a teen girl expresses her lustful feelings for some dude who has rejected her advances. Her tears contain more heartrending force than anything I saw all year that wasn’t the news.\n\nA Quiet Passion (Terence Davies, 2016)\n\nEmily Dickinson once wrote, “My worthiness is all my doubt, / His merit all my fear, / Contrasting which, my qualities / Do lowlier appear,” and now I am convinced she would have fit right in with the girls from All This Panic.\n\nWonder Woman (Patty Jenkins, 2017)\n\nThe scene in which Diana realizes how far she can jump and climbs a wall — smashing a new path upward for herself to reach & become the God Killer (big budget female filmmaker allegory alert!) — reminded me of that moment in The Incredibles (Brad Bird, 2004) when Dash realizes he is running on water. The shock of overachievement, of having outdone oneself, is the essence of happiness, and the smiles on their faces say it all. A superhero’s reach should exceed her grasp, or what’s a sense of wonder for?\n\nJia nian hua (Angels Wear White, Vivian Qu, 2017)\n\nI thought of this movie again when I saw Saturday Night Live’s powerlessness anthem “Welcome To Hell.”\n\nThe Nightmares\n\nmother! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017)\n\nOr, Requiem For A Baby. How can a film so polished, purposeful, and precise evoke the sensation of calamitous moshing at a filthy punk rock concert? Aronofsky, whose work often resembles the output of an architect or mathematician as much as that of a storyteller, loves his audience enough to challenge us; too many of us reject his efforts.\n\nDunkirk (Christopher Nolan, 2017)\n\nCinema as perpetual crescendo, the half of an hourglass that never fills and yet always overflows.\n\nSnow Steam Iron (Zack Snyder, 2017)\n\nWere I a billionaire, I would give the most underappreciated American filmmaker alive half my checking account and ask him to please make, say, five original feature films for my personal viewing pleasure. This Vero short proves he is capable of making dozens of new original masterpieces.\n\nGood Time (Benny and Josh Safdie, 2017)\n\nThe grimy, thrilling new version of Of Mice And Men that no one wanted and no viewer will forget.\n\nHappy Death Day (Christopher Landon, 2017)\n\nThe grimy, thrilling new version of Groundhog Day that no one wanted and this viewer, at least, will not forget. Jason Blum’s production company has always been good at piquing my interest with snazzy trailers and then disappointing me with the actual movie; this (along with Split) is the rare Blumhouse feature that lives up to the vibe of its hilarious preview.\n\nThe Genre Delights\n\nSherlock (Rachel Talalay, Nick Hurran, Benjamin Caron)\n\nThese three mystery features (The Six Thatchers, The Lying Detective, and The Final Problem) happened to air on television, which is fortunate for me as I mash my dvr remote’s ‘rewind’ and ‘play/pause’ buttons down to a nub in an effort to fully understand all the brilliant twists and revelations.\n\nCuplicated (Craig Healy, 2017)\n\nComedians in comedies getting comedy.\n\nKimi no na wa (Your Name, Makoto Shinkai, 2016)\n\nI choose to believe that when the boy gropes himself in the girl’s body, he is merely innocently attempting to secure his most vital organ as he remembers a passage from Laurence Sterne’s A Sentimental Journey — “When the heart flies out before the understanding, it saves the judgment a world of pains.”\n\nBoyka: Undisputed (Todor Chapkanov, 2017)\n\nScott Adkins kicking people is poetry in motion.\n\nKAYA ERDINÇ\n\nPRACTITIONER OF CINESTHETICS AND FILM THINKER\n\nHand Film (Yvonne Rainer, 1966)\n\nLove Sounds (Masha Tupitsyn, 2014)\n\nLove Objects (Tom Chomont, 1971) Paddington 2 (Paul King, 2017) Appearances (Barbara Meter, 2000) A Touch (Barbara Meter, 2008)\n\nRooksporen (Traces of Smoke, Frans van de Staak, 1992)\n\nSepio (Frans van de Staak, 1996)\n\nCertain Women (Kelly Reichardt, 2016)\n\nLe Camion (The Lorry, Marguerite Duras, 1977)\n\nL’homme atlantique (Marguerite Duras, 1981)\n\nAgatha et les lectures illimitées (Agatha and the Limitless Readings, Marguerite Duras, 1981)\n\nLes Enfants (The Children, Marguerite Duras, 1985)\n\nCézanne (Danièle Huillet, Jean-Marie Straub, 1990)\n\nHeis (chroniques) (Anaïs Volpé, 2016)\n\nVisages, Villages (Faces, Places, Agnès Varda and JR, 2017)\n\nGraffiti Bridge (Prince, 1990)\n\nDisappear One (Silvia Maglioni, Graeme Thomson, 2015)\n\nDie Macht der Gefühle (The Power of Emotion, Alexander Kluge, 1983)\n\nBless Their Little Hearts (Billy Woodberry, 1984)\n\nProduction Stills (Morgan Fisher, 1970)\n\nEadweard Muybridge, Zoopraxographer (Thom Andersen, Fay Andersen, Morgan Fischer, 1975)\n\nWhat Did You Eat Today?

There is so much amazing work now being created and shared free online, much of it is personal filmmaking; in fact there is a blossoming of personal no-budget visual art online and the really exciting thing is that, thankfully, it has very little in common with mainstream Hollywood product, about which I have little to no interest.\n\nI am sure I am not alone in that I spend far more time watching abstract films and short experimental videos than I do watching feature films; in part because I make experimental films, and in part because, to my mind, the most risk-taking visual artists don’t necessarily work in feature films; but instead work in video art and experimental filmmaking and newly emerging filmic art forms, such as gifs. Much new media is available free online on virtual platforms from the personal websites of visual artists to a plethora of sites (such as Vimeo) that offer online viewing communities for lovers of art films, new digital media, and experimental filmmaking.\n\nMARK FREEMAN\n\nEDITOR AT SENSES OF CINEMA, ACADEMIC AT SWINBURNE UNIVERSITY, CO-HOST OF THE SENSES OF CINEMA PODCAST\n\nThis year has involved such a juggling of tasks: there has been my work in the School of Film and Television at Swinburne, one of the editors at Senses, a semi-regular radio gig and now heading the new Senses of Cinema podcast. So there’s been a lot of film happening in my life – but it doesn’t always mean I get to actually watch things in the cinema. I look with envy at some of the entries we have here: people who have managed to get to film festivals and retrospectives across the world. My list necessarily has to be a bit more constrained – there are so many things I just haven’t got to as yet. So with those qualifiers – here’s the best that I saw in 2017 in a fairly arbitrary order.\n\n1. Call Me By Your Name (Luca Guadagnino, 2017)\n\nI haven’t been a huge fan of his previous work, and I have to confess I wasn’t really convinced by the first half of the film, until the second half kicked in and it all slotted perfectly into place. That first half is completely setting up the emotional framework for the story, it’s like a soft acoustic version of the emotions that are being played upon here. And then in the second half it’s as if they plugged in the amps and everything is amplified – loud, desperate, overwhelming. And I’m also pleased The Psychedelic Furs finally got the recognition they deserve.\n\n2. Visages, Villages (Faces, Places, Agnès Varda and JR, 2017)\n\nIs it weird that I wept when she recreates the scene from Bande à part (Jean-Luc Godard, 1964) flying through the Louvre in a wheelchair, ecstatically identifying the grand masters that hang on the walls? JR’s joyous leaps and Godardian affect behind her are the perfect accoutrement to her vitality and her own history.\n\n3. Dunkirk (Christopher Nolan, 2017)\n\nNolan’s films can sometimes be incredibly overstuffed – they can become noodly and distracted, while at the same time serving up big epic blockbuster spectacle. Dunkirk hits a perfect middle ground: there’s smart, efficient character development, but a narrative that is focused and not overlong. I thought his juggling of timeframes in this was masterful: he really is a great combination of a broad appeal, popular cinema focused on spectacle, and intelligent integration of temporal/spatial play that keeps the spectator questioning, anticipating and hypothesising.\n\n4. Personal Shopper (Olivier Assayas, 2016)\n\nI would like to go on record that I have been a fan of KStew AND RPatz since I listened to their DVD commentary of Catherine Hardwicke’s actually pretty decent film Twilight (2008). They both demonstrated a self-awareness, and a charming good humour in the face of a film marketing tsunami that was really admirable. So the fact that Stewart has found herself making such interesting films as Personal Shopper seems only fair considering what she had to endure in the past. As a study of bereavement, this film – despite its ghostly narrative framework – gets the experience spot on.\n\n5. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2017)\n\nLanthimos loves playing with ideas of emotional connection and emotional demonstration. And while his approach is to strip away emotion and present a largely affectless society (a style that Colin Farrell mines perfectly), he also identifies the right time to start to shift that style – and it means that when emotions actually register with the characters, it hits us as spectators like a freight train. Creepy, hilarious, moving. Not experiences we normally have at the same time – but this and Jordan Peele’s Get Out (2017) did exactly that.\n\n6. Nocturama (Bertrand Bonello, 2016)\n\nYoung radicals fighting against the ills of society hang out and try on all the very trappings of the world they want to destroy. It’s perfect thematically, but it was Bonello’s use of space and sound that really won me over in this film.\n\n7. Okja (Bong Joon-ho, 2017)\n\nTonally this is completely nuts – in fact a couple of films that I loved were like that this year. And I’m still unsure whether Jake Gyllenhaal’s work in this is a hilarious work of genius or the dumbest pile of look-at-me garbage I’ve ever seen. But what does work is that pig, and that kid, and those incredible action scenes, and its very careful skewering of both sides of the meat debate. Screw those wankers who want to bitch about Netflix. If it gets me films like Okja really promptly so I can join in the conversation, then I’m all for it. Theatrical release is of course preferable, but if a service democratises access to new and interesting cinema, and doesn’t require me to fly to France and book an expensive hotel room and wrangle an exclusive pass to a movie, then I approve.\n\n8. 20th Century Women (Mike Mills, 2016)\n\nI’m not sure what will happen to Mike Mills’ career now that he’s run out of parents to plunder, but I am glad this sits Annette Bening smack bang in the middle of this film where she can be reliably amazing.\n\n9. Thor: Ragnorok (Taika Waititi, 2017)\n\nThe superhero film is basically a dead, bankrupt genre at this point, but how terrific that this film, along with James Mangold’s Logan (2017) both found something new to say with a clapped out, horrifyingly codified genre. Waititi’s sense of humour breaks the ‘if it’s minute 27 it’s time for banter’ approach for traditional superhero films. And normally by the end of these things I’m in an explosion coma – for this, I was actually – almost for the first time ever – actually invested. Only Waititi seems to get that these films are supposed to be goofy and ridiculous. Loved it to bits.\n\n10. mother! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017)\n\nI loved how much people hated this, and I loved how much people loved it. I think it’s a sign of something truly exciting in cinema. There’s no question the film’s hold on all its allegories gets pretty wobbly, but the fact that every single person came out with their own take on this film is the very reason why films are exciting. No other film this year made me appreciate the power of film to mobilise people. mother! was a sign that Aronofsky was a misogynist but in other eyes a critic of misogyny. Its parable of the bible was so thumpingly obvious – unless you read it in a completely different way and didn’t see any of the religious elements in the film because you focused on global warming instead. If this movie was Babe the Pig, I just want to say “That’ll do.”\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nColossal (Nacho Vigalondo, 2016)\n\nNelyubov (Loveless, Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2017)\n\nFive Came Back (Laurent Bouzereau, 2017)\n\nLogan (James Mangold, 2017)\n\nGet Out (Jordan Peele, 2017)\n\nI Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore (Macon Blair, 2017)\n\nHUGO GAMARRA E.\n\nWRITER, TEACHER, DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL IN PARAGUAY\n\nMy best cinema experience in 2017 consists of films seen in large screens in my home country Paraguay and in Argentina, where I visit many times a year.\n\nTrue film-events and the best festival only releases in Paraguay A Quiet Passion (Terence Davies, 2016) Love & Friendship (Whit Stillman, 2016) 45 Years (Andrew Haigh, 2015) Marquis de Wavrin, du manoir à la jungle (Grace Winter & Luc Plantier, 2017) Fai Bei Sogni (Sweet Dreams, Marco Bellocchio, 2016) Fukushima, mon amour (Doris Dörrie, 2016) La puerta abierta (The Open Door, Marina Seresesky, 2016) Le fils de Jean (A Kid, Philippe Lioret, 2016) Le nouveau (The New Kid, Rudi Rosenberg, 2015)\n\nMy favorite new films released commercially in Paraguay Arrival (Denis Villeneuve, 2016) Sully (Clint Eastwood, 2016)\n\nMy favorite new films seen in Argentina, mostly at Pantalla Pinamar, Buenos Aires International Film Festival and Mar del Plata International Film Festival Toni Erdmann (Maren Ade, 2016) Elle (Paul Verhoeven, 2016) El invierno (The Winter, Emiliano Torres, 2016) Bacalaureat (Graduation, Cristian Mungiu, 2016) Sing Street (John Carney, 2016) The Carer (János Edelényi, 2016) Ucitelka (The Teacher, Jan Hrebejk, 2016) Jamais de la vie (The Night Watchman, Pierre Jolivet, 2016) I, Daniel Blake (Ken Loach, 2016) Personal Shopper (Olivier Assayas, 2016) Umi yori mo Mada Fukaku (After the Storm, Koreeda Hirokazu, 2016) Busanhaeng (Train to Busan, Yeon Sang-ho, 2016) L’avenir (Things to Come, Mia Hansen-Løve, 2016) Wajib (Annemarie Jacir, 2017) Chaco (Danièle Incalcaterra& Fausta Quattrini, 2017) Una mujer fantástica (A Fantastic Woman, Sebastián Lelio, 2017) La familia (Gustavo Rondón, 2017) Last Flag Flying (Richard Linklater, 2017) Lucky (John Carroll Lynch, 2017) Taeksi Woonjunsa (A Taxi Driver, Jang Hun, 2017) Good Time (Benny Safdie & Josh Safdie, 2017)\n\nGuilty Pleasures A Streetcat Named Bob (Roger Spottiswoode, 2016) Thelma (Joachim Trier, 2017) Brawl in Cell Block 99 (S.

Zama (Lucrecia Martel, 2017)\n\nLucrecia Martel’s long awaited cinematic return is a feast for the senses and brings a fresh perspective to the colonial life. Packed with delightful references to cinematic and literary characters ranging Godot to Kurtz to Aguirre and even the legendary Gabbar Singh. This is filmmaking of the highest order!\n\n2. Lerd (A Man of Integrity, Mohammad Rasoulof, 2017)\n\nRasoulof cleverly uses a single man’s struggles to depict larger issues around corruption and politics in society. The film is set in Iran but the story is universal.\n\n3. Western (Valeska Grisebach, 2017)\n\nA smart variation of a traditional Western film genre and illustrates the east as the promised land for riches instead. The guns may be absent but horses and masculinity aren’t.\n\n4. Life and Nothing More (Antonio Méndez Esparza, 2017)\n\nA remarkable and urgent film that gets at the core problems regarding racism in America. By using a single incident around a playground, the film shows the cycle of fear that leads to a violent reaction and subsequent excessive force by law officials.\n\n5. Cocote (Nelson Carlo de Los Santos Arias, 2017)\n\nA creative blend of fiction and documentary which effortlessly mixes different film stocks (colour, black and white) and contains different camera styles, including an immersive 360-degree pan. The end result is a scrumptious film that hails the arrival of an exciting new voice in international cinema!\n\n6. Krotkaya (A Gentle Creature, Sergei Loznitsa, 2017)\n\nLoznitsa brings a sharp documentary eye in depicting the prison system in Russian society while layering the work with Kafkaesque notes, satire and even opera.\n\n7. Tesnota (Closeness, Kantemir Balagov, 2017)\n\nBased on a true story, Balagov nicely uses a 4:3 aspect ratio to box the screen in thereby showing the closeness and tension among different ethnicities in the Caucasus city of Nalchik.\n\n8. L’amant d’un jour (Lover for a Day, Philippe Garrel, 2017)\n\nA lovely mix of French New Wave and contemporary sensibilities.\n\n9. Toivon tuolla puolen (The Other Side of Hope, Aki Kaurismäki, 2017)\n\nA timely film about finding compassion and hope in a hostile world.\n\n10. A Fábrica de Nada (The Nothing Factory, Pedro Pinho, 2017)\n\nStarts off as an absurd comedy, shifts gears to become a documentary and ends as a musical. The documentary portion of the film is brimming with ideas where the film looks at the end of capitalism and shutting down of factories across Europe. The film poses relevant questions about what work means in modern society.\n\nHonourable mentions (alphabetical order)\n\nAqerat (Edmund Yeo, 2017)\n\nNewton (Amit Masurkar, 2017)\n\nTeströl és lélekröl (On Body and Soul, Ildikó Enyedi, 2017)\n\nVisages, Villages (Faces Places, JR, Agnès Varda, 2017)\n\nWajib (Annemarie Jacir, 2017)\n\nSTEPHEN GAUNSON\n\nSENIOR LECTURER, SCHOOL OF MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION, RMIT UNIVERSITY\n\nJackie (Pablo Larraín, 2016) My Cousin Rachel (Roger Michell, 2017) A Quiet Passion (Terence Davies, 2017) Dunkirk (Christopher Nolan, 2017) Long Strange Trip (Amir Bar-Lev, 2017) Happy End (Michael Haneke, 2017) I Am Not Your Negro (Raoul Peck, 2017) Twin Peaks: The Return (David Lynch, 2017)\n\nFLORA GEORGIOU\n\nFREELANCE WRITER AND FILMMAKER\n\nMy Top Ten Films for 2017\n\nI Am Not A Witch (Rungano Nyoni, 2017)\n\nI Am Not A Witch is the debut feature by Zambian born Rungano Nyoni. It is an independent British film in English and French. Nyoni explores a modern tale torn between the modern world and tribal superstitions. It is a frightening unraveling of female passivity and innocence in a modern era set in a small Zambian community where colonial and western indoctrination creates confusion and uncertainty. I Am Not A Witch is a harrowing story, yet the magical realism via cinematography is allegorically impressionistic while the dooming consequences of Shula (Margaret Mulubwa) are devastating as it reflects a country caught in a social flux.\n\nLerd (A Man of Integrity, Mohammad Rasoulof, 2017)\n\nA Man of Integrity is a double -edged sword as it exemplifies Mohammad Rasoulof’s right to express the dire situation he finds himself as a leading trail blazing director in his native land. His sixth feature film was shot clandestinely in the north of Iran. He has been on bail since 2010 and has recently had his passport confiscated and is now forbidden to leave the country. A Man of Integrity won the Un Certain Regard at Cannes this year for best film; a tense drama that explores the fight of one man’s right to live freely from the constraints of corruption and injustice. A man and his family moved to escape the malevolence of the bigger cities only to confront similar authoritarian corruption. A brave and confronting film that underhandedly exposes the hidden evils of a corrupt corporation and suppressing the voices of the smaller players.\n\nGood Time (Ben and Josh Safdie, 2017)\n\nGood Time boasts energy and frenzied action in a sequential mayhem of events, yet is more than just your average heist film. It travels through the New York cityscape with a fluid and zesty edge bound in a stereotypical yet cutting edge narrative that erupts on to the screen with a dynamic punch. Despite the disclaiming of provoking racial signifiers and within musical and pop cultural references, it does not deserve a revocation of its artistic license and freedom. Good Time does have a catastrophic outcome and reflects a verite style of action that gives the film freedom and energy.\n\n20th Century Women (Mike Mills, 2017) 20th Century Women received an Australian release earlier this year. It caught my attention when l viewed it on a domestic flight from San Francisco to New York. Set in 1979, it is an era when feminism was coming into fruition and these women and their offspring were struggling with identity and reality. Dorothea Fields played by Annette Bening gives a powerful and understated performance as the lead. Mike Mills has shed light on a unique time in history with a fine use of drama and comedy to explore these nuanced characters and an innovative narrative use of historical montage. It was a ground -breaking film for me as it delved into uncharted territory both visually and thematically.\n\nJawbone (Thomas Q. Napper, 2017)\n\nJawbone screened at the Melbourne British Film Festival in 2017. It’s a gritty and hard- edged portrayal of Johnny Harris (Jimmy McCabe) who has hit rock bottom yet finds refuge in his own childhood boxing club. Thomas Q. Napper draws a fine line between sports and drama delving into the bleakness and destitute life of Johnny, overshadowed by the seedy underbelly of the boxing circuit . Johnny despite the odds and his lack of dignity still manages to muster a fight that can save his life. It is the unique fusion of the pugilist’s lack of faith yet instinctive survival instincts that give this film its distinctive yet idiosyncratic flavour.\n\nWind River (Taylor Sheridan, 2017)\n\nWind River is a disturbing tale that transcends the police procedural offering a sensitive but harsh tale of the sheer brutality and violence of the hidden class; North American Indian women. Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) is an animal tracker on a reservation in snowy Wyoming who accidentally stumbles onto a female dead body. Taylor Sheridan has managed to bring forth the need for justice and truth for the oppressed women of this region. It exemplifies the need to act. It is a poignant yet poetic film that states the truth.\n\nLong Strange Trip (Amir Bar-Lev,2017)\n\nLong Strange Trip is an epic four-hour rockumentary, exploring the thirty- year odyssey of the great pioneering rock band The Grateful Dead. It delves into the bands evolving presence as first to be seen, unseen footage unravels and demystifies an innovative and eclectic band who based themselves in the San Francisco Bay Area. A story that needed to be told and the passion and zest of director Amir Bar-Lev is to be heralded. He is relentless in contextualising The Grateful Dead as a radically eclectic band during the counter culture movement in the mid sixties.\n\nLucky (John Carroll Lynch,2017)\n\nLucky is a humble and quirky gem of a film. It reflects a genuine rawness and provides a moving swansong performance by Harry Dean Stanton. A small town caught between a siesta and retro remoteness. This debut film by Lynch sees him lurking on the edge of warped character development but stays on the linear as he offers the audience a genuine filmic impression on ageing and the fear of loneliness.\n\nApril’s Daughter (Michel Franco, 2017)\n\nApril’s Daughter is the first of the first to delve into the malfunctions of a dysfunctional family. Brazenly confronting entwined in an unconventional fictional story, it offers a breakdown of family values and questions the morality of these institutions.\n\nJIM GEROW\n\nCINEPHILE FROM NEW YORK\n\nNew Releases\n\n1.

HIS LATEST FEATURE BAD BLOOD WAS RELEASED IN AUSTRALIA AND THE USA IN OCTOBER 2017\n\nTop 10 (Eligibility: 2017 festival films in theatrical, festival, premiere DVD or VOD or streaming first release in the USA, Canada, Australia or New Zealand) listed alphabetically by title:\n\nBaby Driver (Edgar Wright, 2017)\n\nPart Walter Hill, part Quentin Tarantino, part Michael Mann, this story of the against the odds romance of Ansel Elgort and Lily James is embedded with one of the best soundtracks of the year.\n\nBankoko Naktys (Bangkok Nites, Katsuya Tomita, 2016)\n\nAn impressive Japanese themed Thailand set melange of big city prostitution and upcountry dreams, ghosts and death overlay an unorthodox love story.\n\nBlade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)\n\nSurprisingly respectful of the 1982 film by Ridley Scott, Villeneuve’s sequel covers another quest for explanation of the differences between humans and machines – a teasing blend of sci-fi noir and philosophy.\n\nDetroit (Kathryn Bigelow, 2017)\n\nBigelow gives us a tough and suspense filled tale set during the Detroit riots of 1967. Sentiment free and brutal in its depiction of racism and prejudice, it’s classic Hollywood cinema.\n\nGrave (Raw Julia Ducournau, 2016)\n\nFrench horror continues to push content boundaries. Ducournau’s cannibal tale is a wild blend of body extremities; political parable; magical gore and a Cronenbergian coming of age story.\n\nI Tonya (Craig Gillespie, 2017)\n\nDriven by a frenetic and feisty performance by Margot Robbie, Gillespie presents an ambiguous story from multiple faux documentary “interviews” and recreations.\n\nMugen no jûnin (Blade Of The Immortal, Takashi Miike, 2017)\n\nAn extraordinary and visceral saga (particularly in 3D) of an immortal Samurai’s determination to redeem himself by protecting a young girl. Miike’s 100th film full of humour, grand guignol and spectacle.\n\nVoyage à travers le cinéma français (My Journey Through French Cinema, Bertrand Tavenier, 2016)\n\nTavernier covers 30 years of French cinema (from the 40’s to the 70’s) particularly emphasising films by Melville Godard, Renoir, Duvivier and Sautet as well as actors like Jean Gabin and jazz composers like Miles Davies. 5 hours 15 minutes and it’s still not enough.\n\nPhantom Thread (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2017)\n\nPart Hitchcock (Vertigo, Rebecca), part Polanski (Cul De Sac), part Losey (The Servant), this strange love story features multiple twists and a great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nWind River (Taylor Sheridan, 2017)\n\nA fascinating crime drama set on a Wyoming Reservation tracking an investigation into the death of a young Indian woman.

Binisaya has been struggling for years to attain a kind of legitimacy in the eyes of the local population, and this year’s edition made great strides in that direction.\n\nSecond, Salamindanaw Asian Film Festival in General Santos City, Mindanao, Philippines, was easily one of the most impressive festival efforts of filmmaker, writer and curator Teng Mangansakan II. While the 2016 edition was impressively able to bring in guests like Chris Fujiwara for a young critics writing workshop, the 2017 edition had to contend with the newly implemented martial law in Mindanao. The political situation kept many investors and possible guests from attending, and yet the festival was easily one of the most inspiring and creative cultural event that was at once multidisciplinary while at the same time maintaining a fidelity to an expanded concept of cinema.\n\nREECE GRATTON\n\nSTUDENT OF CINEMA AND LANDSCAPE, AVID LIST MAKER\n\nTop Ten, No Order\n\nAbacus: Small Enough to Jail (Steve James, 2016)\n\nThe Illinois Parables (Deborah Stratman, 2016)\n\nLogan Lucky (Steven Soderbergh, 2017)\n\nLoveless (Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2017)\n\nMarlina Si Pembunuh Dalam Empat Babak (Marlina the Murderer in Four Acts, Mouly Surya, 2017)\n\nNathan for You: Finding Frances (Nathan Fielder, 2017)\n\nOklahoma City (Barak Goodman, 2017)\n\nThe Prison in Twelve Landscapes (Ben Story, 2016)\n\nRat Film (Theo Anthony, 2016)\n\nWestern (Valeska Grisebach, 2017)\n\nJAIME GRIJALBA\n\nFILM CRITIC (KINOSCOPE, EL AGENTE CINE), FILMMAKER (‘AMPLIACIÓN’ AT TAO FILMS) AND FESTIVAL PROGRAMMER (VALDIVIA FILM FESTIVAL) IN CHILE.\n\nThis year has been full of surprises, but at the same time it feels like the stagnation of an overall sense of ‘not really making it’. It might feel personal, but at times it feels as if cinema isn’t worth it, that it doesn’t matter how much time I spend developing projects, reading criticism, writing it, making some experiments shooting, seeing films… I won’t ever be “good” at it. Only watching these films (and some others, it’s been a good year, contrary to what other people are saying), have I felt that this year wasn’t a wash in terms of this communication system and how it pertains to my life. These are the movies that I’ve enjoyed the most in a year that, from the outside, most could tell was successful for me (Locarno Critics Academy, programming gig at FicValdivia), but for me it was a demonstration that I gotta “get good”.\n\nLa Telenovela Errante (The Wandering Soap Opera, Raúl Ruiz, Valeria Sarmiento, 2017)\n\n2.

Bamui haebyun-eoseo honja (On the Beach at Night Alone, Hong Sang-soo, 2017)\n\nA combination of miserly Australian distribution schedules and not enough time at MIFF (there’s never enough time) meant that I missed some of 2017’s most acclaimed films – Call Me by Your Name, Lady Bird and Zama, among many others. But there was still much to cherish from these past twelve months in cinemas: the claustrophobic realism of Sieranevada; all of the things that went right that shouldn’t have in La La Land; Hermia & Helena’s love of language and multiple exposure; the authentically grim depiction of teenage alpha life in Beach Rats; and Hong Sang-soo dropping in another delightful it-was-all-a-dream moment in On the Beach at Night Alone. But who knew that it would be Michael Haneke’s umpteenth riff on the banal evil of the bourgeoisie – this time played as unabashed comedy – that would most warm this cinephile’s cold heart? Perhaps we all need something to laugh at.\n\nBest repertory screenings\n\n1. Catherine de Heilbronn (Éric Rohmer, 1980) Melbourne Cinematheque\n\n2. Perceval le Gallois (Perceval, Éric Rohmer, 1978) Melbourne Cinematheque\n\n3. La dentelliére (The Lacemaker, Claude Goretta, 1977) Melbourne Cinematheque\n\n4. Posetitel muzeya (Visitor of a Museum, Konstantin Lopushanskiy, 1989) The Astor\n\nMelbourne Cinematheque had another excellent year, with two standout seasons: “Double Agent: The Period Films of Éric Rohmer” and “Playing with Contradiction: The Indomitable Isabelle Huppert”. While – like (I guess) many Rohmer fans – I tend to find myself most at home in his beach houses and Parisian apartment blocks, I was drawn to this presentation of his lesser-known historical films for two reasons: one was the pure joy of being able to enjoy his greatest work, Perceval, on the big screen; the other was the opportunity to finally be introduced to his feature-length television play Catherine de Heilbronn, a production that, in its grey set design and even starker minimalism, in many ways felt like the former film’s shadowy companion piece.\n\nIt was also exciting to see a series of screenings dedicated to the career of one of my favourite actors, Isabelle Huppert, the highlight of which was The Lacemaker, one of her earliest (and most emotionally impacting) lead roles. Huppert was also the focus of an excellent audiovisual talk at ACMI by Adrian Martin and Cristina Álvarez López in November, ‘I Furrow My Own Film: Isabelle Huppert as Screen Actor’ – an insightful analysis into this singular actor’s masterful use of gesture and body movement, and a useful rejoinder to those of us who still find it difficult to let go of our attachment to auteur theory.\n\nElsewhere, the Astor’s screening of Visitor of a Museum was a testing experience – two reels were water damaged, leading to rhythmic, near-unbearable distortions of sound and image, a further obstacle for what was already brave programming – but the film itself was a revelation: a narrative (like so many dreams) of post-apocalyptic landscapes and delayed gratification.\n\nBest DVD releases\n\n1. Metropolis: 90th Anniversary Edition (Eureka! Masters of Cinema)\n\n2. Celine and Julie Go Boating (BFI)\n\n3. Story of Sin (Arrow)\n\n4. Eight Films by Jean Rouch (Icarus Films)\n\n5. Stalker (Criterion Collection)\n\n6. A Page of Madness / Portrait of a Young Man (Flicker Alley)\n\nIt was hard to decide which of 2017’s excellent slate of DVD and Blu-ray releases was the most notable: Arrow continued their splendid Walerian Borowczyk project with a gorgeous presentation of one of his strongest films, Story of Sin, throwing in several of his Polish shorts and a range of other special features for good measure; Criterion gave us the definitive Stalker; Icarus Films compiled most of Jean Rouch’s key works in an indispensable box set; Flicker Alley quietly gave Teinosuke Kinugasa’s A Page of Madness, perhaps the greatest of all early Japanese films, its first ever home-video release; while Adrian Martin’s engaging and informative commentary made the Blu-ray release of my most-cherished film, Celine and Julie Go Boating, a must-have. But it was Eureka!’s 90th anniversary edition of Fritz Lang’s Metropolis, bringing together several versions of the film across three discs – including that most guilt-inducing of pleasures, Giorgio Moroder’s banging 1984 cut set to a playlist of ever-more-questionable pop tunes – along with numerous special features, that I was most thrilled to receive in the post.\n\nLEE HILL\n\nAUTHOR OF A GRAND GUY: THE ART AND LIFE OF TERRY SOUTHERN AND A REGULAR CONTRIBUTOR TO SCREENWORDS.\n\nBests\n\nTwin Peaks: The Return (Showtime, David Lynch, 2017)\n\nJackie (Pablo Larrain, 2016)\n\n20th Century Women (Mike Mills, 2016)\n\nThe Lost City of Z (James Gray, 2016)\n\nAcqua e Zucchero: Carlo Di Palma, i colori della vita (Water and Sugar: Carlo Di Palma, The Color of Life, Fariborz Kamkari, 2016)\n\nColumbus (Kogonada, 2017)\n\nUna Especie de Familia (A Sort of Family, Diego Lerman, 2017)\n\nJusqu’à la Garde (Custody, Xavier Legrand, 2017)\n\nBlade Runner: 2049 (Denis Villeneuve, 2017)\n\nGet Out (Jordan Peele, 2017)\n\nHappy End (Michael Haneke, 2017)\n\nThe Killing of a Sacred Deer (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2017)\n\nTV as Cinema\n\nThe Deuce (HBO, David Simon, 2017)\n\nThe Handmaid’s Tale (Hulu, Bruce Miller, 2017)\n\nThe Wizard of Lies (HBO, Barry Levinson, 2017)\n\nRunners-Up, Honourable Mentions and Not So Guilty Pleasures\n\nNeruda (Pablo Larrain, 2016)\n\nLas Hijas de Abril (April’s Daughter, Michel Franco, 2017)\n\nWonder Wheel (Woody Allen, 2017)\n\nYou Were Not Here (Lynne Ramsay)\n\nBeast (Michael Pearce, 2017)\n\nFilmworker (Tony Zierra, 2017)\n\nCall Me by Your Name (Luca Guadagnino, 2017)\n\nHow to Talk to Girls at Parties (John Cameron Mitchell, 2017)\n\nFar Side of Paradise\n\nRules Don’t Apply (Warren Beatty, 2016)\n\nSong to Song (Terrence Malick, 2017)\n\nmother!

While we understandably seek peace, love and understanding in the real world, we come to art for a complex of reasons which we may only recognize years after the fact. What year is this indeed. Or to put it another way, I don’t own a lot of Pat Boone albums, do you?\n\nPHIL HOBBINS-WHITE\n\nFILM STUDIES LECTURER, BASED IN CAMBRIDGE, UK.\n\nIt’s been a strange year for cinema, hasn’t it? On one level we’ve witnessed unchartered successes for non-white, heterosexual, and male filmmakers and narratives: Jordan Peele’s allegorical horror film (of sorts) Get Out and Barry Jenkins’ moving and urgent drama Moonlight perhaps getting the most attention of the releases from African-American filmmakers in 2017, with Fences and Mudbound also garnering praise as well. It has also been a standout year for LGBT cinema, with a number of titles breaking into the mainstream cinemagoing public’s conscientious: the aforementioned Moonlight being a strong example, but also Beach Rats, God’s Own Country and Luca Guadagnino’s Call Me By Your Name continuing their festival successes into their general theatrical releases.\n\nOn another level, however, following the allegations surrounding previouslyrespected film icons Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey, the film industry has shown that for all the progress the industry has been making in recent years in terms of opportunities and funding for under-represented groups – albeit slow and belated progress – there is clearly a lot more that needs to be addressed so that allegations such as those levelled at Weinstein, Spacey and any others are completely eradicated permanently.\n\nThe criteria I have used for eligibility is simple: I have only considered films which were released in the UK – the country I have spent the majority of the past 12 months – in 2017. This, then, has excluded a number of releases by some of my favourite filmmakers which I am very much anticipating the release of in the early parts of next year, of which were in fact released in the UK in the final months and I have not been able to enjoy them as yet. Such films include Faces Places, Zama, Happy End, Let The Sun Shine In, and the aforementioned Call Me By Your Name and God’s Own Country.\n\nAs well as these films, I would also like to give a special mention to a handful of other releases which, owing to my desire to keep my list to 10 titles, did not quite make the cut. Whilst writing this I cannot quite believe that the French cannibal film Raw did not feature higher, nor Kenneth Lonergan’s deeply moving Manchester By The Sea and the award-laden Toni Erdmann. Other special mentions must also be given to Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Killing of a Sacred Deer (a film I much preferred to his previous, and equally-divisive output), David Lowery’s thoughtful and bravely-constructed A Ghost Story, and finally – perhaps disagreeably so to some of its admirers – Jordan Peele’s Get Out, which I felt was an entertaining yet inferior social commentary to similar of the past such as The Wicker Man, Funny Games and Kill List.\n\nMy top 10 films of 2017\n\nmother! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017)\n\nJackie (Pablo Larrain, 2016)\n\nThe Florida Project (Sean Baker, 2017)\n\nMoonlight (Barry Jenkins, 2016)\n\nDunkirk (Christopher Nolan, 2017)\n\nElle (Paul Verhoeven, 2016)\n\nForushande (The Salesman, Asghar Farhadi, 2016)\n\nThe Lego Batman Movie (Chris McKay, 2017)\n\nGood Time (Benny and Josh Safdie, 2017)\n\nThe Red Turtle (Michael Dudok de Wit, 2016)\n\nJYTTE HOLMQVIST\n\nPASSIONATE ABOUT MOVIES FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD AND AN AVID FILM FESTIVAL GOER\n\n1. Call Me by Your Name (Luca Guadagnino, 2017)\n\nCall Me by Your Name reads like a visual poem about love between two men partly not expecting to find themselves in this situation. With the story narrated against the backdrop of a Tuscan summer landscape, the scenery and the story develop in perfect harmony and the viewer is presented a timely tale about love, real heartache, and learning how to deal with loss.\n\n2. Wonder Woman (Patty Jenkins, 2017)\n\nReleased in a tumultuous year with regard to women’s plights and rights and where the “me too”movement grew increasingly strong, Jenkin’s movie offers a timely contribution to narratives portraying women as all the more able and independent. Perfectly portraying women as a gender to be reckoned with, the story presents us with a Wonder Woman (played by Gal Gadot) who leaves her safe mythological environment behind and enters a world of human chaos and war, where her rescuing abilities and good heart are sorely needed.\n\n3. Professor Marston and the Wonder Women (Angela Robinson, 2017)\n\nPossible to analytically compare with Jenkin’s grand epic, fellow female filmmaker Angela Robinson’s narrative tells the story behind Wonder Woman as a cartoon character and becomes a refreshing and bold story of polyamorous love between the visual and narrative creator of Wonder Woman and his two leading ladies (his wife, and his open-minded female student).\n\n4. Fortunata (Lucky, Sergio Castellito, 2017)\n\nYet another story in which the leading lady comes forth as a force to be reckoned with, Jasmine Trinca in Fortunata is resilient yet downtrodden and while having to face marital abuse and a marriage falling apart she falls in love and lust with another man and is also able to strengthen the much tested bond between her and her daughter in a film set against the backdrop of a dusty and hot Roman suburb.\n\n5. Murder on the Orient Express (Kenneth Branagh, 2017)\n\nKenneth Branagh has done it again! Murder on the Orient Express is a captivating and thrilling film with a different twist and which offers a different take on Agatha Christie’s original, written, story. Perfectly narrated, with stunning scenery, and excellent performances by the group of main, all very well-known and celebrated main actors. A film not to be missed!\n\n6. The Beguiled (Sofia Coppola, 2017)\n\nThe Beguiled, starring Nicole Kidman and Colin Farrell in the lead roles, beguiles us with its rendition of collective female strength and wit and its tale about the collective against the individual. Developed against a stunning rural landscape, the movie contains a number of unexpected twist and turns and reads like a strangely beautiful thriller.\n\n7. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (Yorgos Lanthimos, 2017)\n\nYet again starring Kidman and Farrell in the lead roles, The Killing of a Sacred Deer is a partly twisted tale about revenge partly gone wrong. It makes for uneasy watching and the film has various elements in common with The Lobster (by the same director, 2015). The film is different and refreshing, and creepingly discomforting to watch.\n\n8. mother! (Darren Aronofsky, 2017)\n\nStarring the filmmaker’s then girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role and multi award-winning Javier Bardem as her male counterpart, mother! draws us into a vortex of deceit and false perceptions, and although Aronofsky seems to be borrowing elements from, e.g., Polanski’s Rosemary’s Baby, he still manages to deliver a movie that has the audience at the edge of their seats from beginning to end.\n\n9. Franz (François Ozon, 2017)\n\nBeautifully narrated in monochrome colour tones, Franz captivates with its poetic pace, its sweet and partly impossible lovestory between a man and a woman and its parallel story of love between two men where the survivor becomes obsessed with the other man fallen in war to such an extent that he builds a narrative about them despite their very brief yet emotional encounter.\n\n10. Tulip Fever (Justin Chadwick, August, 2017)\n\nIndie romance Tulip Fever stars Swedish actress Alicia Vikander in the lead female role and in its portrayal of bargaining and speculating hype and power on the tulip market where the flower has become seen as a commodity, the picture of 17th century Amsterdam comes alive and with that we get a historical insight into an important period in history. The not always convincing love story is, in my view, secondary to the grander narrative of importance from a historical and cultural perspective.\n\nPETER HOURIGAN\n\nLONG-TIME MELBOURNE CINEPHILE, AND TEACHER.\n\n2017 doesn’t seem to loom as a vintage year. Of my year’s best, I only saw four in commercial cinemas – and then on limited art house seasons. But wonderful, innovative films are still being made. You just had to look a bit harder to find them. Looking at my list, I note that four are by women – and I was not setting out to apply any reverse discrimination. This is something to be celebrated. All that is needed is for their films to receive better distribution. But with the evolution of streaming, downloads, long-form formats and more, perhaps the term “access” is going to be more relevant for all film makers.\n\nIn Commercial Cinemas\n\nRéparer les vivants (Heal the Living, Katell Quillévéré, 2016)\n\nPerhaps my top film of the year – poetic, humane, intelligently structured (even improving on its source novel), and philosophically and morally thought provoking.\n\nI Am Not Your Negro (Raoul Peck 2017)\n\nWith so many documentaries on so many worthy subjects, this stood out, not least for the imaginativeness of its approach.\n\nMoonlight (Barry Jenkins, 2016)\n\nLabels like Gay, African-American, Coming-of-Age, Rites of Passage are just too inadequate to grasp the richness and warmth of this film.\n\nLes innocents (The Innocents, Anne Fontaine, 2016)\n\nAn awful story made with concern and compassion, and great cinematic control.\n\nCinema Ritrovato, Bologna\n\nWest Indies (Med Hondo 1979)\n\nHondo was my discovery of the year at Cinema Ritrovato. This film is dazzlingly colourful, inventively cinematic, and passionately opinionated and anti-colonialist.\n\nMelbourne International Film Festival\n\nPowidoki (Afterimage, Andrzej Wajda, 2016)\n\nWajda’s last film is in one way a summing up of a rich career, but so much more as it touches on creativity, state attempts to control art, and personal integrity.\n\nTeströl és lélekröl (On Body and Soul, Ildikó Enyedi, 2017)\n\nInterest and warmth in her characters shines through this imaginatively structured and filmed Hungarian film.\n\nUcitelka (The Teacher, Jan Hrebejk, 2016)\n\nMarvellously melodramatic, with a superbly manipulative protagonist, it becomes more than just a story from Czechoslovakia’s Communist era.\n\nColo (Terese Villaverde, 2017)\n\nA quiet, thoughtfully composed work about a family under stress. Not a unique family, either – it could be anyone’s.\n\nUna mujer fantástica (A Fantastic Woman, Sebastián Lelio, 2017)\n\nAt last, transgender stories are being tackled without sensationalism, just trust and love for the main characters. This has a forceful and moving performance (Daniela Vega) at its heart.\n\nVisages, Villages (Faces, Places, Agnès Varda and JR, 2017)\n\nAnything from Varda especially in her late 80s is to be celebrated – even if not her best it’s so much richer than much else.\n\nMarjorie Prime (Michael Almereyda, 2017)\n\nAlmereyda deserves to be better known (including his several Shakespeare films.) This is so adventurous in such a restrained, warm way.\n\nOutside the Categories\n\nGerman Concentration Camp Factual Survey (Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein 1941)\n\nThe ‘official’ list of directors is possibly misleading, given the film’s history.
