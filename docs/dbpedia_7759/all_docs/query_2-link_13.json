        "text": "This chapter presents narrative time, point of view, and narrative structure as the theoretical framework for analyzing the change of narrative modes in Chinese fiction, and limits the research scope to the works translated or created by the New Fiction novelists and May Fourth writers between 1989 and 1927. Based on the descriptive data, it is found that, starting from 1902, Chinese fiction had begun to show an apparent deviation from traditional fiction in terms of narrative modes. More specifically, narrative time was the first to change and point of view comprised the largest range of change. The roles played by different techniques in changing the narrative modes are also different: the flashback technique in narrative time helps to break the traditional linear narrative, the limited narration the omniscient point of view, and characterization in breaking through the plot-centered narrative structure. The research argues that both the introduction of Western fiction during this period and fiction’s absorbing of literary nutrients from the other traditional literary genres when it shifted from the peripheral to the central position in Chinese literary system both contribute to the change of narrative modes in Chinese fiction. The impact from the Western fiction and the influence of the tradition literature is discussed respectively in Part I (Chaps. 2–4) and Part II (Chaps. 5–7)."
