        "text": "Novel series by Xu Lei who is better known by his pen-name Nan Pai San Shu\n\nFor the literary adaptations with the same Chinese title, see The Lost Tomb and Time Raiders.\n\nDaomu Biji (simplified Chinese: 盗墓笔记; traditional Chinese: 盜墓筆記; pinyin: Dàomù bǐjì) variously translated as Grave Robbers' Chronicles,[nb 1] Grave Robbery Note[nb 2] and The Lost Tomb,[nb 3] is a novel series about the grave-robbing adventures of Wu Xie, a young man hailing from a family that had been tomb-raiders for centuries. The series was written by Xu Lei (Chinese: 徐磊), better known by his pen-name Nan Pai San Shu (南派三叔). It was first serialized online at Qidian China (simplified Chinese: 起点中文网; traditional Chinese: 起點中文網; lit. 'Starting Point Chinese Net'), a Chinese website for publishing, writing and reading novels, as a fanwork of Ghost Blows Out the Light originally. Written over a span of five years and published as nine separate novels, it is one of the most popular novel series in China from 2007 with several million fans and over 20 million copies sold.[1] The author has also written two sequels, Zang Hai Hua (Chinese: 藏海花), Sha Hai (Chinese: 沙海), which continued the leading character's story, neither of which were finished at the time of the author's announcement to retire from writing on March 22, 2013.[2] The author returned to writing in 2019 with another unfinished sequel, Reboot: Thunder at the Distant Sea (Chinese: 重启之极海听雷).\n\nAlong with Ghost Blows Out the Light, Daomu has contributed greatly to creating a craze and subsequent market in the Greater China area for novels focusing on grave-robbing that also deal with the supernatural.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nFifty years ago, a group of Changsha grave robbers dug out manuscripts of the location of treasures from Warring states, but an encounter with an undead rendered almost the whole group dead. In the present, the young grandchild of the sole survivor, Wu Xie, discovers a secret within his grandfather's notes. Together with his third uncle, Wu Sanxing, and a few other experienced tomb robbers, to search for the treasure. But what no one expected to find the intriguing mysteries that accompanied their tomb robbing adventure - just who was the owner of that tomb? Will they be able to find the real coffin? And just where will these puzzle lead the group?[3]\n\nEmbarking on eight-volume's worth of adventures, as Wu Xie slowly unravels millennium-old mysteries, he sees the deterioration of his naïve world as he discovers the people around him are not what they seem and that he could trust no one in this tomb robbing world of deceit and lies.\n\nMain characters\n\n[edit]\n\nWu Xie (Chinese: 吴邪): The point-of-view character and primary protagonist. He is from the Hangzhou Wu family, one of the Changsha Old Nine, a group of families who have been grave-robbing for centuries. At the beginning of the first book he joins his uncle Wu Sanxing to experience grave-robbing for the first time, setting off the series of events to come in later books. His name is a homophone with \"innocent\" (无邪, also pronounced \"Wu Xie\"), indicating his gullible nature.\n\nZhang Qiling (Chinese: 张起灵): A man with a mysterious past whose story leads the last few volumes of the chronicles. He is often hired as an assistant to many grave-robbing endeavors and is highly competent at it; very little is known about him, even his real name. He is from the true branch of the Zhang family, one of the Changsha Old Nine. Like all true branch Zhang family members, he has a Qilin tattoo spanning his left shoulder, his blood is noted to ward off evil, and his index and middle finger are noticeably longer than his other fingers.\n\n\"Fatty\" Wang (Chinese: 王胖子): Nicknamed \"Gold Getting Xiao Wei\", he is a northern grave-robber (as opposed to Wu Xie, from the south) and teams up with both Wu Xie and Zhang Qiling throughout the books; together they are referred to as the \"Iron Triangle.\"\n\nWu Sanxing (Chinese: 吴三省): Wu Xie's third uncle. An experienced grave-robber with a few well-kept secrets.\n\nPan Zi (Chinese: 潘子): Sanxing's right-hand man, who had served in the Sino-Vietnamese War prior to becoming a grave-robber.\n\nA'ning (Chinese: 阿宁): A grave-robber and the first major female introduced in the series, her motives are unclear but she seems to be working against the protagonists. She has ties to Henry Cox, the antagonist of the Changsha Old Nine.\n\nYun Cai: A Yao girl who helps Fat Wang and Wu Xie during their adventures in Yunnan.\n\nHei Yanjing(Chinese: 黑眼镜): A mercenary with a mysterious past and is thought to be as competent as Zhang Qiling. He takes every opportunity to make money and is noted to be very expensive. Like Zhang Qiling, very little is known about his past; his real name is said to be very ugly. He has ties to the Qi family of the Changsha Old Nine. He becomes Wu Xie's mentor in Tomb of the Sea. His eyes are special in that the darker an area is, the better he can see. His name literally means \"Black Glasses\". Because of his eyes, he is often called \"Black Blind(Chinese: 黑瞎子)\".\n\nXie Yuchen(Chinese: 解雨臣): The current head of the Xie family, one of the Changsha Old Nine. A childhood friend of Wu Xie, he is adept in martial arts, Chinese opera, and various other skills. He is noted to be very wealthy, enough to afford Hei Yanjing multiple times, and is the successor and student of Er Yue Hong, previous Hong family head of the Changsha Old Nine. Because of his \"pretty-boy\" looks and his tendency to wear pink, he is often called \"Xiao Hua(Chinese: 小花)\", literally meaning \"Little Flower\".\n\nAdaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2011, a serialized manhua, drawn by Dongdong and Yuelu, was published.
