        "text": "A disaster-stricken area in southwest China welcomed a rescue medical team and volunteers, with actress Qin Fei accompanying the team. Everyone said that Qin Fei's volunteering was merely for show, but Qin Fei was earnestly committed and even risked her life to save others in a critical moment. During their time together day and night, the team leader of the medical team, Xing Zhi Zhi, saw the resilience and kindness in Qin Fei's heart, deepening their mutual understanding. Qin Fei also discovered that many years ago, the young doctor who saved her life and reignited her hope during a dance competition accident was Xing Zhi Zhi. Their fate was already intertwined long ago. (Source: Chinese = Baidu || Translation = NAY at MyDramaList) ~~ Adapted from the novel \"Ni De Huang Yan Ye Dong Ting\" (你的谎言也动听) by Er Yue Sheng (二月生).
