Their leader is the mysterious, but fearless Zhang Qi Shan. His origins may be a mystery but his brilliance, bravery, and power are there for the world to see. When a mysterious train comes to town absent a driver but full of dead bodies, it's clear something bad is coming to Chang Sha. Deserate to stay ahead of the Japanese and the traitors who help them, while trying to defend both his nation's history and its future, Zhang Qi Shan is in for the ride of his life. Joining him are his two closest friends and fellow members of the Nine Families - Er Ye (an opera singer and heir to a famed tomb-building family) and Ba Ye (a fortune teller with a knack for understanding the hearts of both the living and the dead, but also a nose for getting into trouble with a capital \"T\"). It's a story that will lead them through underground tombs, plauge-infested villages, prison camps, spooky marshes, and more. Can Zhang Qi Shan and his friends overcome the obstacles that face them above and below ground while still keeping the people they love safe at home?\n\nMy Thoughts"
