        "text": "One of the young couples that exemplified the “perfect match” marriage in Qing history, Sun Xingyan 孫星衍 and Wang Caiwei 王采薇 left behind personal records that give us a glimpse into the intimate world they created, from intellectually stimulating post-marriage courtship, to mourning and pledge of fidelity when Wang Caiwei died. Analyzing this record in the contexts of the Qing literati glorification of “perfect match” marriage and the couple's familial and social lives, this article pieces together a personal story about youthful passion and love and considers questions about the shapes of emotion and marital companionship and the ways the young couple navigated emotional and social complexities in their pursuit of an ideal companionship.\n\n1 A growing body of scholarship has contributed to this understanding. Dorothy Ko's 1994 study of the seventeenth-century women's culture in Jiangnan, for example, provides the first in-depth look into the “companionate marriage” between intellectually compatible couples. Ko, Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth-Century China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994). More recently, using the elegiac biographies men wrote of their late wives, Martin Huang has explored the intimate voices of bereaved husbands as well as the male construction of womanhood and male self-representation. Huang, Intimate Memory: Gender and Mourning in Late Imperial China (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2018). In Arranged Companions, I examine the origins of the idea of marital companionship in Chinese history and shows how it became widely embraced by the educated during the early and High Qing. See Weijing Lu, Arranged Companions: Marriage and Intimacy in Qing China (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2021). Other studies have explored various aspects of marital relationships in the late imperial period. See, for example, Theiss, Janet, “Love in a Confucian Climate: The Perils of Intimacy in Eighteenth-Century China,” Nan Nü: Men, Women and Gender in China 11.2 (2009), 197–233CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Xiaorong Li, “Singing in Dis/Harmony in Times of Chaos: Xu Can's Poetic Exchange with Her Husband Chen Zhilin during the Ming-Qing Transition,” Jindai Zhongguo funüshi yanjiu, no. 19 (2011), 215–54; Xu, Sufeng, “Domesticating Romantic Love during the High Qing Classical Revival: The Poetic Exchanges between Wang Zhaoyuan (1763–1851) and Her Husband Hao Yixing (1757–1829),” Nan Nü: Men, Women and Gender in China 15.2 (2013), 219–64CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Barr, Allan H., “Marriage and Mourning in Early-Qing Tributes of Wives,” Nan Nü: Men, Women and Gender in China 15.1 (2013), 137–78CrossRefGoogle Scholar; Weijing Lu, “Writing Love: The Heming Ji by Wang Zhaoyuan and Hao Yixing,” in Gender and Chinese History: Transformative Encounters, edited by Beverly Bossler (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2015), 83–109.\n\n4 Scholars have termed this type of marriage “companionate marriage,” a concept adopted from Western scholarship in which it was defined by such qualities at “affection, equality, and mutuality” and romantic love was regarded as the “necessary condition for marriage.” Despite some shared features, the Chinese notion of “jia ou” differed from companionate marriage in important ways. For example, the husband and wife relationship in China was hierarchal rather than equal and romantic love was not a “necessary foundation for marriage.” See Lu, Arranged Companions, 12–13. It must be noted that this type of marriage was not universally practiced. Marital companionship was nurtured and exhibited in different ways even among the well-educated. See Barr, “Marriage and Mourning”; Lu, Arranged Companions, 74.\n\n6 Jiang Qingbo's study of the prominent families in Southern Jiangsu, of which Changzhou was a center, provides a detailed account of the region's cultural achievement, including producing many of the Qing's best known female poets, and the unique socio-economic conditions that propelled this success. Jiang Qingbo 江庆柏, Ming Qing Su'nan wangzu wenhua yanjiu 明清苏南望族文化研究 (Nanjing: Nanjing shifan daxue, 1999). The generations of women from the Zhang family, chronicled by Susan Mann, offer an example of the talent this locality nurtured. See Susan Mann, The Talented women of the Zhang Family (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007).\n\n10 Poetry was a standard component of the civil examinations in the Tang and Song periods, but it was removed from the exams from the early Ming onward. Emperor Qianlong restored a poetry question in 1756 to “make examinations more difficult for the increasing numbers of classically literate candidates.” Benjamin A. Elman, Civil Examinations and Meritocracy in Late Imperial China (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2013), 8. Even with this policy change, poetry was not key to examinations success, and as Elman points out, “examination policy never hindered the popularity of poetry and literary flair among literati groups, which demonstrates the cultural limits of the classical curriculum in influencing intellectual life.” Ibid. 3.\n\n51 The circumstance of this event was unclear, but the poem's title, “On the fourth of the ninth month, having stopped the boat on the Yangzi River near Zhenjiang, I walked under the moon with my wife,” suggest this was far from Changzhou or Jurong. A long trip away from home like this was rare for a woman of her background, but it makes perfect sense if it was a visit between the two families. The Yangzi River was a common route for travel between the two places.\n\n74 Confucian classics stipulate that a son mourned the death of a mother for one year, but if his father had already died when his mother died, then he would mourn her for “three years.” This rule was abandoned under the Ming founding emperor, who thought it treated mothers unfairly, and for the rest of the Ming and Qing dynasties, mourning a mother for “three years” as one would a father was the standard practice."
