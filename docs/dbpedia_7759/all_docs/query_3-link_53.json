        "text": "Side Story: A Question\n\n- Paralogue Eight of the main novel. Chronologically before Side Story: Fate.\n\n“Why do you still seek me out?” The scissors in Er Yue Hong’s hands stilled as he spoke. The red bamboo he was trimming had already begun to take on a semblance of its final shape; the shoots that’d been growing every which way had been already pruned away. Come summer, they’d be easily transferred to the large planters to be placed in the main hall, a companion in colour to the green of the outer baskets.\n\n“Master is still so devoted to such elegant things.” Chen Pi A’Si stood with his hands clasped behind his back, a distance away. He lingered just outside the doorstep of the main hall, not setting foot inside.\n\n“An elegant thing is still a thing, and in attending to this thing, time can pass a little faster,” Er Yue Hong said. “Even if I explained, you wouldn’t understand.”\n\nHe put his scissors aside and sighed, wiping away the sweat on his hands with his handkerchief.\n\n“The disciple truly does not understand, and it seems like the master no longer wants to teach,” Chen Pi A’Si said.\n\n“I’ve already said that you are no longer my disciple. Stop calling me Master this, Master that. I’ve heard enough of the things you’ve done outside in the world, and want even less to have anything to do with you.” Er Yue Hong did not look up at him. He merely took a sip of his tea. “Go. You won’t live lacking for anything, and there is nothing more for you here.“\n\nChen Pi A’Si laughed.\n\n“Everything your disciple has done has been taught by Master, yet Master wishes to shed all responsibility with just a few words? Even though that’s what you say, you likely still think that it’s not possible.”\n\n“You and I are not the same.” Er Yue Hong glanced at him. His appearance, compared to when he’d still been a student of his, was much sharper. He wore a silk jacket, and the ratty cloth bag of slingshot pellets that had once hung at his waist was now replaced by one of mink fur. “For every thing you do, there must be some consequence. As you use what I’ve taught you to perform your misdeeds, I remain here, only to plant some flowers, to write some calligraphy. Whatever happens outside has nothing to do with me.“\n\n“True. Master has always been someone who can shut the door and live out his life,” Chen Pi A’Si said. “But there’s something you never considered. You can shut the door and pretend to ignore everything. But people will still come and bother you. Right now, with the world in upheaval as it is, do you really think these four walls can protect Master’s world of peace?”\n\nEr Yue Hong sighed. He understood what Chen Pi A’Si meant. All he’d wished for was to live out his life with Yatou in peace, yet no matter how much he wished to live on his little piece of land, the storm outside of these walls raged so great that it seemed as if it would soon sweep away everyone in the country.\n\nOnce, he’d truly thought of himself as great—great enough to fall so deeply in love, to be stubborn, to do anything he wished, to be anything he wanted. He could face the world with any look he so desired.\n\nAnd yet, he’d been wrong.\n\n“You know everything?” Er Yue Hong asked.\n\n“Everyone in the business knows about Master’s wife. Even though your disciple has not been working in Changsha for some time, I still have my sources here.“\n\n“If you know, you know. There is nothing you can do.”\n\n“This time, I’ve come only to ask Master one question. Once I have my answer, I’ll go.” Chen Pi A’Si’s eyes grew keen.\n\nEr Yue Hong sighed deeply. Even though he hadn’t meant to pay him any mind, he paused, and decided to listen to his disciples question. Perhaps it was because they’d touched upon the matter dearest to his heart. Even so, he had a feeling he would regret it.\n\n“Then ask.“\n\n“Is it true you agreed to his Eminence’s request?” Chen Pi A’Si asked.\n\nEr Yue Hong stared at him at length before he finally nodded.\n\n“Then, you’re sure that you won’t do any more for Master’s wife?” Chen Pi A’Si asked.\n\n“What more can I do for her?” Er Yue Hong said. “There’s nothing I can do. There’s nothing anyone can do.”\n\nChen Pi A’Si shook his head. “I think that as long as one wishes to do something, they can find something to do.“\n\nEr Yue Hong closed his eyes as he sank down into the woven chair. He knew what every word of what Chen Pi A’Si was saying meant, yet he didn’t want to think of it, he didn’t want to remember.\n\nBy the time he’d opened his eyes again, Chen Pi A’Si was no longer there. A bamboo basket had been left on the doorstep. Inside, were several plump crabs and a bundle of incense.\n\nYatou’s favourite had always been crab. It wasn’t the season for crab, yet these crabs were as fresh as they could be, and looked plump and full of meat.\n\nThey must have been brought from the south.\n\nSeven years ago, Chen Pi A’Si had been chased from his master’s door. At that time, Er Yue Hong had told him he was never to set foot inside this door ever again.\n\nToday, he’d brought with him crab from afar and stood on the doorstep. Never once setting foot inside."
