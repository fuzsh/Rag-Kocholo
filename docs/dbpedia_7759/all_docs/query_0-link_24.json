Beckham\n\nNarrator: Christa Lewis\n\nFormat: Unabridged\n\nLength: 13 hrs and 20 mins\n\nLanguage: English\n\nRelease date: 01-24-18\n\nPublisher: Tantor Audio\n\nGenres: Fiction, Historical\n\nPublisher's Summary:\n\nIn the South Carolina Hills, along the Savannah River Watershed, in the fall of 1829, 14-year-old, three-quarter Cherokee Sahani, whose Christian name is Charity, sets out on a journey with her 83-year-old maternal white grandfather to Fort Charlotte for what she thinks is a trip to trade the pelts he has accumulated in order to replenish their supplies. However, Charity soon discovers that her grandfather's objective in making this trip is to get her married off and settled somewhere.\n\nSince her beloved grandmother's passing several months earlier, her grandfather has worried about what would become of Charity should he, too, pass away. And, given his advanced age, he somehow senses that time is near; he does not want to die and leave young Charity alone and desolate. He and his wife reared Charity after her mother and father both died in a yellow fever epidemic when she was three years old.\n\nAs they travel to Fort Charlotte, her grandfather tells her that before going to Fort Charlotte they will be making an overnight stop at his friend's house. And, that a year or so earlier, he and his long-time friend, Eli Gulledge, talked about what would happen to Charity should both he and his wife pass away and have arranged for Charity and Eli's son Henry to meet before that time comes to see if they will take a liking to one another.\n\nWhen Charity, who has never met Eli or his family, hears that, she threatens to act rude in order to make them not like her so that she can go back home with him, but her grandfather tells her that she cannot go back home with him and assures her that if young Henry doesn't take a liking to her, he is sure that some young buck down in Fort Charlotte will be looking for a wife.\n\nFaced with the stark realization that her life is changing and she has no control of that change, many thoughts run through young Charity's mind - she even contemplates running away, but doesn't want to leave her grandfather alone.\n\nWhen her grandfather suddenly passes away that night at Eli's house, that threat never comes to fruition. Young Charity is forced to abide by her grandfather's wishes and stay there with Eli's family....\n\nContains mature themes.\n\nListen to this audiobook in full for free on http://hotaudiobook.com\n\nTitle: Cowboys Come Home\n\nAuthor: Monte Dutton\n\nNarrator: Kenyon Strecker\n\nFormat: Unabridged\n\nLength: 9 hrs and 11 mins\n\nLanguage: English\n\nRelease date: 12-22-17\n\nPublisher: Hudson Montgomery Dutton\n\nGenres: Fiction, Historical\n\nPublisher's Summary:\n\nEnnis Middlebrooks and Harry Byerly are warriors, and the time for fighting is past. Theyre cowboys, and when they get back home to Texas, the time for cowboys is passing, too.\n\nMonte Duttons fifth novel, Cowboys Come Home, begins on the island of Peleliu, where the two privates somehow manage to save themselves when cut off from their fellow Marines by the Japanese. Ennis and Harry come home to a heroes' welcome, but life gets complicated after that.\n\nThe Middlebrooks ranch, east of Janus, near the Oklahoma border, is run-down, and Ennis's father is dying. Harry moves in, Mama Middlebrooks moves out, and Ennis takes a job as a deputy sheriff under a wise but aging lawman, Judson Lawson. His little sister, Becky, is wild beyond her years and takes an immediate shine to Harry, who is haunted by the war and prone to violence.\n\nThe closing of an Army base, Camp Ammons, is causing the town to die. The county loses nearly 40,000 infantry trainees and gains nearly 60,000 acres. The ranchers it displaced are either long gone or too poor to purchase their land back. Men with political clout and money move in like vultures. Money buys influence and, with it, elections. Ennis Middlebrooks goes from sheriff-in-waiting to disgraced lawman. He and his old Marine pal, Harry Byerly, decide to do something about it.\n\nListen to this audiobook in full for free on http://hotaudiobook.com\n\nTitle: A Legacy of Secrets\n\nSubtitle: Irish Family Saga, Book 4\n\nAuthor: Jean Reinhardt\n\nNarrator: Michael Healy\n\nFormat: Unabridged\n\nLength: 4 hrs and 3 mins\n\nLanguage: English\n\nRelease date: 09-26-17\n\nPublisher: Tantor Audio\n\nGenres: Fiction, Historical\n\nPublisher's Summary:\n\nAs the past catches up with Catherine, one of her sisters becomes a thorn in her side.
