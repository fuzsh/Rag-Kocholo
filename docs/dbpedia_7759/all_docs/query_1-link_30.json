        "text": "The Columbia History of Chinese Literature, edited by Victor H. Mair. New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. Pp. xx + 1342. $78 (hardbound). It is difficult enough to write the history of a national literature where this history is relatively short, as in Russian or American literature. The problem becomes exponentially larger with a national literature that spans three millennia, and, measured by sheer volume of text, might well be larger than all other national literatures combined. Yet writing a history of Chinese literature is not impossible. Over the last century, a number of efforts have been made in various languages: many in Chinese, a good number in Japanese, and about twenty in European languages, including a few in English (none of which are mentioned in the book under review). Writing yet another history of Chinese literature has to take this fact into account because each new such history is built-not always consciously-on previous efforts. To a greater extent than is sometimes acknowledged, our own limitations are inherited. In some particular instances we might be successful in transcending this heritage; but for the larger part, we remain confined to it. Each new history of literature inevitably joins the process of canonizing, anthologizing, and tradition-making that is, to no small extent, the very subject under study. Thus, the conventional version of Chinese literary history that matches particular genres with particular dynasties-Han fu ,i, Tang shi * , Song ci *I-J, Yuan quiP , Ming-Qing xiaoshuo KAV /J\\TR-is the direct result of such history-cum-canonization. This scheme simultaneously mirrors and confirms the prevalent research interests in Chinese literature, perpetuating the limitations of past inquiry as expectations for future work. Once accepted in a scholarly community, the reproduction of the conventional version reigns as a matter of convenience for all. As the editor of The Columbia History of Chinese Literature (hereafter: CHCL), Victor H. Mair submits that his volume transcends such limitations. In his own characteristic words, offered in the \"Prolegomenon\" (pp. xi-xiii) and \"Preface\" (xv-xviii), he declares that his history includes \"the latest findings of critical scholarship\" (p. xii). It is a work where \"the history of Chinese literature is seen through entirely new prisms that transcend both time and genre\" (p. xii). It is a volume packed \"with as much basic information as possible\" (p.xv) and built upon \"rigorous marshalling of evidence\" (p. xvi). It is also a history that \"touches on such matters as the fuzzy interface between ?Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 26 (2004)\n\nHow could modern “literature” emerge in China? And what was its relation to the imperial ways of conceptualizing writing? This essay argues that modern “literature” was just one strategy among others of reconceptualizing the use of writing in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century China. First, the author shows that the ancient “study of wen” or wenxue—the word later used to translate “literature” in modern Chinese—has been seen by a Jesuit in the seventeenth century as an equivalent of rhetoric, and that this premodern discipline, at least in that period, resembled more the “study of wen” than the modern, post-eighteenth century “literature”: the object of rhetoric, like the object of the “study of wen,” was an “ornamented” form of writing that could be found in both “literary” and “non-literary” genres, and it was associated to both courtly and administrative uses of writing. Second, the author explains in more detail the ornamental and trans-generic features of the imperial wen. By following a number of texts from medieval times to the nineteenth century, he argues that the association between wen, literati sociability, and court and administrative practices, recurrently shaped discussions on text composition in imperial history until the late Qing (1644-1912). Third, and last, he deals with two strategies of reconceptualization of writing at the time when court society and imperial institutions were losing their central position as sources of authority for late Qing literati. The author argues that modern “literature” was just one strategy among others of reconciling the old wen with the demands of the modern concept of “nation”—a strategy that, in some respects, would be unable to expunge wen of the hierarchical inspiration it inherited from the ancient social order. By exposing different ways of conceptualizing aesthetic experience with writing, and by claiming that “literature” was only one conceptual strategy among others, this part of the essay contributes to an understanding of “literature” not as the necessary result of “modernization” or as a trans-historical institution, but as a contingency, as something that was not inevitable in modern Chinese history.\n\nScope of the Course: This course is an analysis of the changing literary and cultural patterns in modern and contemporary China. By engaging in close analyses of fiction, poetry, drama and literary thought from the late Qing period to the present, we will trace the changes that have occurred in China beginning in the late 19 th century, throughout the 20 th century and into the 21 st century. The course sheds light on various transforming phases in which the influx of Western thought merges with persisting classical Chinese aesthetics to mold the form and content of modern Chinese literature, especially in fiction and poetry. The class will cover the socialist process in China since 1949 by focusing on key cultural-political movements, leading to the emergence of dissident writers. Simultaneously, the class will impose a genuine emphasis on the continuity of diverging literary practices in Taiwan where modernism is conspicuously and actively attended. We will also explore the unique situation of Hong Kong literature\n\n​ The article aims to rethink the pluralistic intellectual currents and social changes of the last centuries in China: how literati reacted to the historical changes, the economic developments, the collapse of the hierarchical order, and the social mobility from the end of the Ming to the middle of the Qing dynasty. Urbanisation, the great silver inflow, the acceleration of trade, and social mobility raised new challenges to the orthodox view of the world and to Neo-Confucian norms. These new attitudes of the Chinese literati – which can be inferred both from literary and philosophical works – uncover new attitudes in the mental structure of the intellectual strata of the time. In the history of ideas we notice a progressive detachment from the orthodox view of the conflictual relationship between principle and desires, especially in the ambit of the Taizhou school. The elaboration of a new anthropological mindset aimed at the rehabilitation of passions and desires culminated with Li Zhi. This trend went on in the Qing period, from Wang Fuzhi to Dai Zhen. Also in literature such trend, the so-called 'cult of ​ qing​ ', can be found with the moral justification of emotion-desire (establishing emotion as a genuine and active source of virtue), and with the vitalistic identification of emotions as the source of life and reproduction. Another indication of the change of mentality is the challenge of common and accepted truisms through the praise of 'folly' in real life situations and literary works: to be 'crazy' and 'foolish' becomes a sign of distinction among certain intellectual circles, in contrast with the pedant orthodox scholars and officials and the vulgar ​ nouveaux riches​. The unconventional character of the anti-hero Baoyu is emblematic, with his aversion for any kind of official ceremony and convention, his abnormal sensibility and impractical and naïve mentality, and his consciousness of being different from others. The crisis of the established ladder of values can be seen in the exaltation of 'amoral' wisdom and in the presentation of various dimensions of love, from the idealistic sentiment of 'the talented student and the beautiful girl' to the metaphysical passion that overcomes death, and to the minimalist concept of ​ '​ love is like food​ ' in a ​ carpe diem perspective​. ​ And finally another challenge is exemplified by Yuan Mei's reflections on the concept of Heavenly Mandate, retribution, human responsibility, and historical constructions by resorting to 'abnormal' phenomena to uncover the absurdity of reality and unconscious imagery. His questions testify the polyphonic debates of the late imperial China, besides established conventions and Neo-Confucian orthodoxy. KEY WORDS : Literati, modernisation, desires and principles, Li Zhi, cult of qing, foolishness, Yuan Mei, retribution, human responsibility\n\nThis paper presents an analysis of the interaction between classical Chinese poetry and its Russian translation during the long 20th century through the manifold ways in which translational representations participate in relentless reinterpretation, rethinking, and re-signification. This historical instantiation of the eternal tension between \"domesticating\" and \"foreignising\" translations allows a closer look at the strategies exploited by the majority of their Russian creators. Poet-translators of the Belle Époque set the tone for producing \"readable\" translations oriented towards the regnant literary and cultural norms of their target audience. Presenting a part of the significant avant-garde trend of reinterpreting the cryptic \"East\", their taste for using Chinese imagery and poetic principles as a manifestation of cultural transfer was reinforced by translations of Chinese literature by Russian Sinologists published most actively during the 1940s-1960s. Their task was formulated as a cultural objective of producing a familiarised, \"fluent\" text based upon \"the translator's invisibility\". Their versions were addressed to a reader who acted within the framework of the national/cultural tradition, and who was forced to reckon with this tradition. Then the pendulum swung the other way, producing highly de-familiarised translations of traditional Chinese poetry by contemporary Russian poets within a more nuanced approach that still awaits interpretation."
