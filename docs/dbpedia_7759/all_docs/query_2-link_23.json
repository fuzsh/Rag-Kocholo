        "text": "Although Xu Xu's (1908–1980) writing has garnered increasing attention in scholarly criticism and literary histories, his insightful novella Jingshenbing huanzhe de beige (Elegy for a Psychotic, 1943) has not attracted the same attention as his other writing. Elegy is a rare example of a literary engagement with psychological theories and clinical approaches. Central to the novel is the triangular relationship between a psychiatric assistant, a patient, and the patient's live-in nurse, framed from beginning to end by the mentoring of the assistant by a famous French psychiatrist. This narrative setup creates a dynamic that captures the representation of abnormal psychology and the reception of psychological idea. This paper argues that the narrative format and the psycho-ethical engagement of Elegy offer a rare cross-cultural examination of psychological ideas and psychotherapy in literary representation. As a coming of age story that takes place in 1930s Paris rather than in China and draws on Xu Xu's neo-Romanticism, it points to a universally shared trauma derived from social repression and high idealism. In addition, it is a rare piece of writing that draws extensively on the nexus between medicine and literature and thus offers an interesting contribution to the field of Medical Humanities.\n\nThis study explores literary representations of ghosts and the spectral in Mainland Chinese fiction from the Republican period (1912-1949) to the present. The first two chapters trace the politicization of Chinese ghost culture and literature within intellectual debates and fictional writings from the early 20 th century. I argue that ghosts and narratives of haunting provided writers with a powerful metaphor and script to reflect on and negotiate a modernization project caught between the rejection and the strategic appropriation of China's cultural history. Reading ghosts as a fictional space, which challenges normative hierarchies between the past and the present, China and the West, chapter three discusses the phantom romance plot in late Republican Shanghai fiction and the representation of female phantoms as gendered reflections of, and on, Shanghai's commodity culture, cosmopolitanism, and the changing real and symbolic roles of women. Chapter four focuses on the conjunction of Chinese ghost culture and classism in Mao-era literary production and analyzes the socialist adaptation of the anomaly account collection in “Stories About Not Being Afraid of Ghosts” (1961). Lastly, chapter five discusses two urban ghost novels from the post-Tiananmen period (1989-) which reimagine older models of cosmography to reflect on critical issues in China today, such as heritage destruction, migration and air pollution.\n\nThe relationship between popular culture and East Asian identity is now an established field of enquiry, with the products of Japan's mass media industries—television series, pop stars, and manga—still providing much of the fuel for debate. This paper, however, moves away from the dominant notion of “culture as industry,” and explores animated personal responses to the fiction of Japanese writer Murakami Haruki in Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan through art house cinema, popular fiction, and online creative communities. The vogue for Murakami has swept across the region in recent years, and for many of those inspired by his work, it is Murakami's role as a conduit to cosmopolitan cultural citizenship that is so alluring. Yet rather than crude imitation, the filmmakers, writers, and Internet fans analyzed here misappropriate the “Murakami mood” in different ways, and in the process, they reveal the diverse meanings that attach to cosmopolitanism across contemporary East Asia.\n\nTa-wei Chi Modern Chinese Literature and Culture, vol. 17, no. 2, pp. 167-201 This article focuses on desire in pedagogical situations as represented in early-twentieth-century Chinese fiction. Since male-female desire is more readily identifiable, this article centers on the less often discussed same-sex desire in literature. The texts under discussion, published from the 1910s to the 1930s, are Xu Zhenya’s novel Jade Pear Spirit (Yuli hun, 1912), Yu Dafu’s short story “Misty Nights” (Mangmang ye, 1922), Ye Dingluo’s story “Boyfriends” (Nanyou; ca. 1920s), Zhang Ziping’s novella Flying Catkin (Feixu; 1926), Rou Shi’s novella February (Eryue; 1929), and Shen Congwen’s story “Tiger Cub” (Huchu; 1931). These works are populated with characters that are concerned with various acts of enlightenment, ranging from literacy training to sexual initiation. Same-sex desire is useful to a number of narratives on pedagogy. In some texts, same-sex desire is eroticized as a eviation from the heterosexual norm so that it accentuates the unusual nature of the pedagogy in question. Such pedagogy appears too modern or too Western to Chinese, as it is portrayed to be associated with the seemingly outlandish same-sex desire. In other texts, however, same-sex desire is desexualized so as to protect the pedagogical relationship from a negative taint. In this way, it functions as a buffer for those who seek to repress desire in pedagogical situations. While the sexualized representations of same-sex desire and the asexual ones are diametrically opposed to each other, both camps of representations illustrate how pedagogy appeared ambivalent to the Chinese at that time."
