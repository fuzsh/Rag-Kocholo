        "text": "What are Regent University's average SAT scores and GPA? In this guide, we'll discuss what scores are needed for you to get admitted into Regent University. You'll also get to calculate your own chances with our admissions calculator.\n\nLocation: Virginia Beach, VA\n\nRegent University Admissions Statistics\n\nThere are three critical numbers when considering your admissions chances: SAT scores, GPA, and acceptance rate. All these combine to tell you what you scores are required to get into Regent University.\n\nAverage SAT: 1140\n\nThe average SAT score composite at Regent University is a 1140.\n\nRegent University SAT Score Analysis\n\nThe 25th percentile New SAT score is 1050, and the 75th percentile SAT score is 1230.\n\nIn other words, a 1050 places you below average, while a 1230 will move you up to above average. There's no absolute SAT requirement at Regent University, but they really want to see at least a 1050 to have a chance at being considered.\n\nHere's the breakdown of SAT scores by section:\n\nSectionAverage25th Percentile75th Percentile Math544490600 Reading + Writing597540650 Composite114010501230\n\nAverage GPA: 3.54\n\nThe average GPA at Regent University is 3.54. This makes Regent University Strongly Competitive for GPAs.\n\n(Most schools use a weighted GPA out of 4.0, though some report an unweighted GPA.\n\nWith a GPA of 3.54, Regent University requires you to be around average in your high school class. You'll need a mix of A's and B's, and very few C's. If you took some AP or IB classes, this will help boost your weighted GPA and show your ability to take college classes.\n\nIf you're a junior or senior, your GPA is hard to change from this point on. If your GPA is at or below the school average of 3.54, you'll need a higher SAT score to compensate and show that you're prepared to take on college academics. This will help you compete effectively with other applicants.\n\nAdmissions Rate: 32.3%\n\nThe acceptance rate at Regent University is 32.3%. In other words, of 100 students who apply, 32 are admitted.\n\nThis means the school is quite selective. If you have strong academic scores, you have a great shot at getting in.\n\nFinal Admissions Verdict\n\nBecause this school is quite selective, strong academic scores are critical to improving your chances of admission. If you're able to score a 1230 SAT or above, you'll have a very strong chance at getting in. But if you get a 1050 SAT or below, it'll be a steep uphill battle for you to get admitted.\n\nAdmissions Calculator\n\nOther Schools For You\n\nIf you're interested in Regent University, you'll probably be interested in these schools as well.
