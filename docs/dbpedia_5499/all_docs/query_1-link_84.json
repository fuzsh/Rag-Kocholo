        "text": "<p>Regent’s is a private university, and there are very few of those in the UK. Not only is it much more expensive (though I don’t know the price for internationals), it is virtually unknown.\n\nPeople who attend seem to like it, based on Regent’s social media sites, but that’s it. You can search TSR (CC’s UK equivalent) and you’ll barely find anything. That should already be a warning sign. That, and the fact that you don’t even need to apply through UCAS.\n\nKCL, on the other hand, is a Russel Group university and is very well-regarded.</p>\n\n<p>That and the fact that Regent’s is not even listed on <em>any</em> of the university rankings. Seriously, it would be like Cornell and a small private college that takes everybody who graduates from high school. </p>"
