        "text": "Information Sessions\n\nIdeal for students first figuring out how to get into Nursing, and required as part of a major change into Pre-Nursing. Information sessions will cover information about our pre-licensure programs including Pre-Professional Nursing major, an undergraduate major that prepares students for professional admission to our Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) or Master's Entry to the Profession of Nursing (MEPN) programs. This session is intended for students who are exploring nursing options and have not completed their prerequisite courses for professional admission to our BSN or MEPN program.\n\nTuesday, August 13, 2024 2:00pm-4:00pm\n\nTuesday, September 10, 2024 2:00pm-4:00p\n\nTuesday, October 8 2:00pm-4:00pm\n\nTuesday, November 12, 2024 2:00pm-4:00pm\n\nTuesday, December 10, 2024 2:00pm-4:00pm\n\nTuesday, January 14, 2025 2:00pm-4:00pm\n\nTuesday, February 11, 2025 2:00pm-4:00pm\n\nBSN Direct Admissions Pathway - Information Sessions\n\nJoin us to learn about our new Bachelor of Nursing in Nursing Direct Admit (BSN-DA) program at the University of Arizona College of Nursing. During this virtual session, we will cover important details about the program, including admission criteria and the application process.\n\nApplication Academies\n\nIdeal for students who are ready to apply and want more information on statistics, details on the application process, or a final check in before submitting their application for the professional BSN or MEPN program. Applicants are encouraged to have poked around in the application prior, but we will do an overview of the application as well. Attendance is not required for program admission, and attendance has no impact on an applicant's admission status. We offer this only to be helpful.\n\nIf the form does not appear above, please click here to complete your registration.\n\nAdvising Sessions\n\nThe College of Nursing offers appointments with Admissions Advisors and Academic Advisors. Current and prospective students can schedule an appointment with an advisor.\n\nNote: Attending an Information Session is required prior to scheduling an appointment with an Academic Advisor. An academic advising appointment will entail the student and advisor working together to go over any specific questions and/or creating a personalized plan for nursing. Students are expected to have a basic understanding of the requirements for nursing and program options to make the most of an academic advising appointment.\n\nTours\n\nAre you going to be in the Tucson or Gilbert area soon?
