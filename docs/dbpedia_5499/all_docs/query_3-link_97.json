Let’s work together to create a healthier campus through a connected system of care.\n\nDoes Your School Have TimelyCare?\n\nAccess Care Now!\n\nCreate a Healthier Campus Through a Connected System of Care\n\nWhole Student Health\n\nFrom mental health to medical care, TimelyCare provides the virtual care students need.\n\nDiverse Provider Network\n\nTimelyCare’s culturally responsive provider network reflects the diversity of your campus community.\n\nA Team-Based Approach\n\nTimelyCare uses care coordination and virtual health to complement your existing campus healthcare resources.\n\nComplete Clinical Care\n\nCombine health and well-being on a single virtual platform through phone, video, or video chat.\n\nBuilt for Digital Natives\n\nEmpower students to create their own path to care while emphasizing agency, speed, and personal choice.\n\nExpert Guidance and Support\n\nOur higher education experts will help launch your program and drive student engagement.\n\nHigher Education Trusts TimelyCare\n\nAs demand for support continues to grow, how can your campus resources keep up?\n\nIn our work with millions of students at more than 350 colleges and universities across the country, our team applies that experience to develop a truly complete virtual health and well-being solution that complements your campus resources with:\n\n24/7 Support\n\n50-State Coverage\n\nDiverse Care Providers\n\nEquitable Access\n\nContinuity of Care\n\nLMS + EHR Integrations\n\nPrevious\n\nNext\n\nReady to Expand Access to Care?\n\nMental Health Outcomes Reveal Impact\n\nAt TimelyCare, our mission is to foster student success and improve the health and well-being of campus communities. A key to fulfilling this mission is helping students get better, faster – especially those with severe depression and anxiety symptoms.\n\nTimelyCare users who entered care with severe symptoms on the PHQ-9 or GAD-7 achieved, on average, clinically significant change by their third scheduled counseling or psychiatry visit. Additionally, those who entered care with clinical symptoms on the PHQ-9 or GAD-7, on average, dropped a severity ranking (e.g., moderate to mild) by their third scheduled counseling or psychiatry visit.\n\n77%\n\nof students who sought help through TimelyCare reported mental health improvements\n\n85%\n\nof community college students say they are more likely to remain in classes, improve their grades, and graduate – or all of the above – after using TimelyCare\n\n9 out of 10\n\nstudents said they would recommend TimelyCare's services\n\n4.95/5 stars\n\nrating for TimelyCare's national network of care providers\n\nOur Commitment to Inclusion\n\nCombatting the Campus Mental Health Crisis\n\nAs the campus mental health crisis continues, the need to ensure equitable, on-demand access to care has never been more important. You’ve likely added counselors or expanded resources in some way, but what happens when offices are closed or resources are unavailable? Vulnerable students can end up suffering in silence.\n\nTimelyCare’s diverse care provider network empowers students with confidential, one-on-one support from health care experts who are empathetic to their needs.\n\n4 out of 5\n\ncollege students say campuses face a full-blown mental health crisis\n\n55%\n\nof students who considered dropping out in 2022 cited emotional stress as the reason they considered leaving – more than any other reason\n\n32%\n\nof non-completers cited mental health issues as a contributing factor for leaving college, 14% said it was the primary reason\n\n2 in 3\n\nstudents say mental health resources make them more likely to graduate\n\n92%\n\nof Gen Z said that care provided via telehealth was the same or better compared to in-office visits.\n\n#1\n\nAccess to virtual counseling and mental health support through a teletherapy or virtual care app is the number one resource students wished their schools offered.\n\nFeatured In\n\nPrevious\n\nNext"
