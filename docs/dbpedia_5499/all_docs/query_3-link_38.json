        "text": "Online Undergraduate and Graduate Business Degrees Available\n\nRegent University appears in our ranking of the Top 15 Doctorate in Leadership Online Programs.\n\nRegent University offers nearly 130 graduate and undergraduate degree programs. The school is nationally recognized as one of the best online universities in the country, providing flexibility as well as exceptional quality. The school’s online degrees are offered by Regent’s seven graduate schools and the College of Arts & Sciences.\n\nSpecifically, the programs in the School of Business & Leadership provide opportunities for professional growth as well as the ability for students to build a life of purpose that is grounded in Christian principles. Pursuing an online business degree from Regent will give students the expertise they need to excel professionally, personally, and spiritually. Students can choose from business degrees in law, communication, church leadership, design management, business analytics, and organizational leadership. In addition, Regent offers a popular Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree that is available online and on-campus.\n\nThe MBA degree is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) and was ranked the fourth best online MBA program in the state by U.S. News & World Report in 2018. The 42-credit program equips students for new entrepreneurial adventures, career advancement, consulting, and more. Students will learn how to build analytical competencies to successfully navigate and interpret the ever-changing marketplace, gain strategic leadership skills that they may apply to a number of organizational settings, and hone their business skills with a service-first approach.\n\nThe program is taught from a Christian perspective and offers numerous concentrations so that students may customize their degree to align with their career goals. Available concentrations include not-for-profit management, marketing, leadership, innovation management, human resource management, healthcare management, general management, finance and investing, entrepreneurship, economics, and accounting.\n\nRegent University also ranks #1 among the best online bachelor’s programs in Virginia and 15th among the best online bachelor’s programs for veterans according to U.S. News & World Report in 2016. In addition to an online graduate degree in business, Regent offers an online undergraduate degree in business as well as programs in management and leadership, marketing, human resource management, Christian leadership and management, accounting, and leadership studies. Students may also choose to pursue one of two combination degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Business and a Master of Business Administration or a Bachelor of Arts in Leadership Studies and a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership.\n\nAbout Regent University\n\nLocated in Virginia Beach, Virginia, Regent University is a private Christian research university that was founded in 1977 by Pat Robertson as Christian Broadcasting Network. In 1990, the school changed its name to Regent University. Although Regent operated a satellite campus in Alexandria, Virginia, it sold this campus in 2008. The school offers both distance education programs as well as traditional on-campus degrees. Through its eight academic schools, Regent provides doctoral, master’s, bachelor’s, and associate degrees in more than 70 courses of study. Notable alumni include contemporary Christian musician Jason Upton, actor Tony Hale, screenwriter Cheryl McKay, 1999 Miss America Nicole Johnson, and former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.\n\nRegent University Accreditation Details\n\nRegent University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In addition, its School of Business and Leadership is accredited by both the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) as well as the American Society of Estate Liquidators (ASEL). Accreditation not only allows schools to receive federal funding and accept transfer credits from other accredited institutions, but it also serves to inform students and the public that the school is committed to high-quality education. During the peer-review accreditation process, a number of factors are evaluated, including the quality of the programs, student learning outcomes, teaching methods, and student satisfaction.\n\nRegent University Application Requirements\n\nAdmission requirements for the bachelor’s degree in business vary depending on the individual students. For online students and/or adult learners over the age of 24, students must complete an online application and submit unofficial high school and previous college transcripts. Applicants are also required to complete an admissions questionnaire that addresses the applicant’s academic history and reasons for attending Regent.\n\nStudents who wish to pursue an online graduate degree in business must hold a bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited institution. The application process requires students to complete an online application, submit unofficial college transcripts, and send a professional curriculum vitae or resume that includes service activities, leadership positions, and employment history. Students must also complete an admissions questionnaire regarding their interests and professional goals and pay a $50 application fee. Students who wish to waive this fee may do so by attending a School of Business & Leadership online or on-campus information session to discover financial aid resources and streamline the application process. An admissions interview may also be required, and Regent will contact each student independently to determine whether they must appear.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\n\nOnline students pursuing an undergraduate degree in business from the College of Arts & Sciences will pay $395 per credit hour if they are taking an average of 12 credit hours per semester, which is considered full-time status. Part-time students taking an average of six credit hours per semester will pay $425 per credit hour. Students pursuing an online graduate degree in business administration can expect to pay $650 per credit hour. Regent charges the same graduate tuition for both in-state and out-of-state students, which makes the cost of the 42-credit program $27,300. Other fees and expenses include a $100 enrollment deposit, a $550 university services fee for online students, and fees for an orientation test, a program assessment test, and a library course."
