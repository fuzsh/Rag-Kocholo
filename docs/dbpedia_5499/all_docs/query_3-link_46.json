        "text": "In 2022, Regent University's tuition was $18,080 a year.\n\nTuition was the same price in 2023 compare to the year before. On average, college tuition rises about 3% year.\n\nRemember, the total cost of tuition isn't the final cost for attending college. Many students owe much less than the total tuition after grants, scholarships, and tuition discounts kick in. Additionally, student loans can make the amount you do have to pay out of pocket feel more doable until you're done with college.\n\nRegent University meets 42% of the demonstrated financial need for undergraduates. The average financial aid package for a full-time, first-year student at Regent University is around $14,483 a year.\n\nStudents in the class of 2023 who had taken out student loans graduated with an average of $33,695 of debt.\n\nDoes Regent University Offer In-State and Out-of-State Tuition?\n\nRegent University is a private institution, which means it has the same tuition for students from Virginia as it does for residents from other states.\n\nPublic colleges and universities receive funding from the state government. These institutions offer a lower cost of attendance for students who are residents of that state.\n\nChoosing a college where you qualify for in-state status can cut the cost of college tuition. Don't forget to check your state's rules for in-state tuition. Every state has its own rules about what makes someone eligible for in-state tuition. The most common requirement is that students must have lived in the state for a full year before starting school. There may be additional requirements as well, depending on the state you and your parents currently reside in.\n\nExplore other Virginia colleges\n\nRegent University International Student Tuition\n\nTuition at Regent University is the same for all students.\n\nStudents from outside of the U.S. usually do not qualify for for loans or grants from the U.S. government, but should research private or Regent University-specific aid and scholarships. International students who demonstrate financial need may qualify for the following types of financial support at Regent University:\n\n•On-campus jobs •Regent University-specific scholarships\n\nInternational students without financial need may be eligible for merit-based institutional scholarships and athletic awards.\n\nRegent University Room, Board, Fees, and More\n\nIn addition to the cost of tuition, there are other costs associated with college, like room and board, facility fees, and books and supplies. Let's take a look at what impacts these costs, and what to expect at Regent University.\n\nHouse and Food Costs at Regent University\n\nHousing and campus dining at Regent University costs $9,952 a year. This number covers the cost of living in dorms or other on-campus housing, plus a dining plan that enables you to eat in the Regent University's on-campus cafeterias and dining facilities. Students who live off campus but still want to use the dining facilities can opt-in for a meal plan. The cost of board-only is $7,296.\n\nBoard costs vary based on on the number of meals you intend to eat on-campus\n\nCost of Books at Regent University\n\nFirst-year students are sometimes surprised by how much books and supplies cost–and not in a good way. The real cost of books and supplies depends on the courses you take and the textbooks, computer programs, or other materials are required.. To save money, many students choose to use books from the library or buy books from students who have already taken the course.\n\nAnnual Fees\n\nThe majority of colleges charge some yearly fees to offsets cost associated with maintaining facilties, like the computer labs and libraries, athletic facilities, and more.\n\nKeep in mind, there could also be other costs associated with participating in special activities, like joining a fraternity or sorority, or participating in sports or other extracurriculars. Most colleges have resources so that those who may struggle to participate because of cost can find ways to lower or eliminate these costs.\n\nThe Cost of Transportation at Regent University\n\nThe total cost of getting around in college depends on a few key factors. Will you take a subway, car or an airplane to get to school? Is on-campus parking free, or will you need to budget for parking? Is the campus walkable? Do you plan to bring a car or will you need to use busses, subways, or other modes of transportation? All of these questions can drastically impact your estimated cost of transportation. Keeping in mind, first-year students are allowed to park a car on campus.\n\nThe location of a college or university can also have a big effect on transportation costs. Small, rural schools may be easier to get around, but the cost of getting to campus may be higher. On the other hand getting around in a city is usually costly, but there may be more trains, busses or affordable flights to actually get to school. Regent Universityis in a suburb in Virginia, near Hampton Roads.\n\nOther Costs\n\nWhen budgeting for college, be sure to leave some room in your budget for personal expenses, like going out to eat or see shows, furnishing your living space, and things like haircuts, clothes and, yes, even toilet paper and shampoo.\n\nTotal Tuition and Expenses at Regent University\n\nNow, let’s go over all of the costs we've covered, to get a better estimate of how much students can expect to shell out for Regent University.\n\nHow Much Does Regent University Cost?\n\nWhat will the cost of attending Regent University be? Here is a breakdown of tuition and expenses.\n\n2023 Total Tuition and Expenses Tuition $18,080 Room and Board $9,952 Board Only $7,296 Other expenses $1,696\n\nThe total estimated cost will vary depending on whether you are going to live on-campus or off-campus.\n\nTotal Estimated Costs On-Campus $31,328 Off-Campus $28,672\n\nThe breakdowns above provide a good estimate of the total cost of attendance before financial aid and scholarships. Tuition and fees may vary depending on program, course level, location, and more.\n\nRegent University’s tuition and fees change based on: •Course load for both full and part-time students\n\nRegent University Financial Aid\n\nIn 2023, 1,575 of the 4,552 undergrads enrolled received financial aid. Regent University meets 42% of the demonstrated financial need for undergraduates.\n\nThe average financial aid package for a full-time, first-year student is around $14,483 a year. Around 67% of Regent University undergrads take out student loans to cover any remaining costs. Regent University graduates who have student loans graduate with an average of $33,695 of student loan debt.\n\nThe average debt for each loan type varies.\n\nAverage Debt By Loan Type Federal Loans $31,486 Private Loans $14,033\n\nMost Common Loans for Regent University Students Federal Loans 66% Private loans 13%\n\nMost students take out institutional or government loans, because they tend to have lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options than private loans. Loans from the federal government can be subsidized or unsubsidized. Subsidized loans do not accrue interest during school, while unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest at the time the loan is issued. If students do no qualify for enough federal loans to cover the cost of tuition, some take out private loans. Parents can also take out ParentPLUS loans, which are government loans for parents who are helping their children pay for college.\n\nThe Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) helps colleges determine how much financial need students and their familes have, so they can offer a financial aid package that meets, or come close to meeting, their need. For more information on Regent University financial aid, keep reading, or visit their financial aid website.\n\nScholarships at Regent University\n\nSome students may receive grants and scholarships to help pay for college. Unlike loans, scholarships and grants do not have to be paid back.\n\nIn 2023, Regent University awarded 1,070 need-based scholarships to students, giving away total of $25.7 million to help students with financial need cover the cost of school. An additional $11.9 million in merit-based scholarship money was awarded to students without demonstrated financial need.\n\nRegent University Net Cost\n\nThe net price of college is the actual cost of attending a school for one year. Net cost is calculated by subtracting any scholarships, grants or other aid that does not need to be paid back from the total cost. Student loans are not part of the calculation, because they need to be repaid.\n\nNow that we have a sense of the total estimated costs for Regent University students, we can subtract the average financial aid package to find the estimated net cost. Net cost can vary depending on a students’ need and the financial aid award received.\n\nWhen considering whether a school fits your budget, it is important to consider the estimated net cost, not just the sticker price of tuition. Often, schools with the highest tuition also offer the most generous aid packages, so estimate your net cost before eliminating a school because it does fit your budget.\n\nThe average amount of financial aid received by a full-time first year student with demonstrated need at Regent University was $14,483 in 2023. By substracting the average financial aid package from the estimated costs, we get a number that may make the cost of Regent University seem more manageable.\n\nEstimated Net Cost for Full-Time Students On-Campus $16,845 Off-Campus $14,189\n\nWhat will attending Regent University really cost you? The answer depends on several factors.\n\nAs of 2011, colleges are required to have a net price calculator on their website to help prospective students and their families get a better idea of the actual cost of attending that school, based on their financial situation. You can find the Regent University's net cost calculator on their website.\n\nRegent University Tuition Payment Plans\n\nSome students choose to use payment plans to make the cost of tuition fit more comfortably in their budget.\n\nRegent University does not have guaranteed tuition.\n\nRegent University offers an Installment Payment Plan, which allows students to pay tuition in a series of smaller chunks instead of one lump sum.\n\nRegent University Tuition Waivers\n\nSchools sometimes offer tuition waivers to certain groups, to offset the cost of attending. Some schools offer tuition waivers for faculty, staff, and their families , underrepresented students, or military students. Even if you qualify for a waiver, other expenses and fees are the responsibility of the student.\n\nRegent University has some full or partial tuition waivers available for: - X - Employees or Children of Employees\n\nCheck the financial aid website for more information on payment plans and tuition waivers.\n\nRegent University's Endowment\n\nAn endowment is the total value of a school's investments, donations, and assets. Endowment is not necessarily an indicator of the quality of a school, but it can give you a sense of how much money a college can afford to invest in expanding programs, improving facilities, and supporting students.\n\nRegent University's endowment was valued at $61.3 million in 2023, compared to a national average of $905 million.
