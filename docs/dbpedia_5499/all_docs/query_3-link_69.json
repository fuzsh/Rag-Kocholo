        "text": "The Institution Code to have your scores sent to Regent College is 9738. Please note that we do not currently offer any English language instruction.\n\nOur admissions policies\n\nWe encourage men and women of any race, colour, national or ethnic origin, and denomination to apply for our programs. We also welcome students with disabilitiesâ€”our campus is fully accessible to students in wheelchairs. We then select from a variety of factors in addition to strong academic performance, such as employment history, voluntary activities, and creative pursuits.\n\nThe normal prerequisite for study is an accredited bachelor's degree. We are aware, however, that some students may not have a bachelor's degree, yet have the interest and ability to study at the graduate level. If this is the case, we encourage you to apply as a mature student.\n\nIf you're unsure about applying for a program, but want to start off by taking some courses, you can do so as an unclassified student.\n\nWhat type of applicant are you?\n\nOur application form asks you to specify what type of applicant you are. This chart will help you figure this out.\n\nType of applicant Program applying for Credential Other requirements Application Regular Student GradDipCS\n\nMA in Christian Studies\n\nMA in Theo.

We assess the applications according to the availability of space and the relative merits of each case.\n\n** This is a temporary designation only. As an unclassified student, once you complete 12 credits of courses, you must apply for admission to a Regent program if you wish to take more courses. Note that students admitted to a program are given priority in classes where space is limited. If you're coming from outside of Canada as an Unclassified Student, and you plan to study for less than six months, you may not require a study permit. Contact the Assistant Dean of Students for details.\n\nCategories of admission\n\nIf you are admitted to Regent College, you will be admitted under one of the following three categories:\n\nUnconditional Admission: All requirements have been met.\n\nConditional Admission: Under special circumstances, you may be admitted while certain official documents are still outstanding. The outstanding documents must be sent to us as soon as possible. Once we receive the outstanding documents and evaluate them to be satisfactory, we change your conditional admission to unconditional admission. If we do not receive the outstanding documents within one year of your start term, we will place a hold on your account and you will not be able to register for any courses. Please note that we do not grant conditional admission for outstanding English language requirements or, in some cases, incomplete transcripts.\n\nProbationary Admission: Under exceptional circumstances, you may be granted probationary admission despite an academic record below normal entrance requirements. If you are admitted in this category, you can register for a maximum of 9 credits in your first term, and must take the non-credit Academic Writing course (GENR 311). We will remove your probationary status on the condition that you earn the minimum entrance grade point average requirement in your first 9 credits. If you do not earn the required grades, we will withdraw the probationary admission. Please note that we do not grant probationary admission to students coming from outside of North America.\n\nIf you are admitted unconditionally to a diploma or a degree program, you will be expected to maintain the minimum grade point average requirement for your program.\n\nIf you fall below the minimum, you will be notified that you have been put on academic probation for the following term. If you fall substantially below the minimum, you may be dismissed from the College without probation. For further information, please see the graduation requirements and probation policy section of the Academic Catalogue."
