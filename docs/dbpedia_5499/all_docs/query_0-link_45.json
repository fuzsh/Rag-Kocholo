As I reflect on my own law school journey, I wish I had stumbled upon this comprehensive guide earlier. It's an 86-page treasure trove of wisdom, specifically designed to help law students navigate their academic path with finesse. I know firsthand the challenges that come with this journey, which is why I'm excited to share this resource with all of you. Let's invest in ourselves and each other for a successful and fulfilling legal education. Here's to acing our law school journeys!

It seemed relatively straight forward back then, and turns out it actually is. There's one set of rules to know. Need to figure out procedure? Find the relevant rule; check district and judge's rules for quirks; verify with case law to figure out weird situations; rinse and repeat. Enter New York state practice. It was a good day when I finally felt comfortable enough with the quirks of the CPLR and county-specific rules. That knowledge provides a real home-field advantage. Getting there wasn't easy, and mistakes were my wingmen, especially as a very young lawyer. I mean, did a Queens County clerk mark my motion to admit an out-of-state colleague pro hac vice in Queens County off-calendar because the return time on my notice of motion was off by A HALF HOUR since a particular judge preferred slightly later calendar calls on Fridays? Yes! But the point is I learned a lesson that day, and I'm still definitely not salty about that one. Now in Florida, I've had to learn more procedural quirks and lingo. I'm not a young lawyer anymore, so the learning curve has been much smoother. But, there have been a few days that made me feel like a rookie again. It's been fun, however, getting to appreciate the differences. No such thing as a motion for summary judgment in lieu of complaint here? Got it. I choose my own hearing date? Awesome. It also really helps to know wise local practitioners that are lifesavers for my most basic questions. As for the pic, I wish I could say he was starting his legal education early, but in reality, he was just making fun of dad! üìöüèõÔ∏èü§™ #LegalLife #FromNYtoFL #LearningCurve #lawpractice #civilprocedure"
