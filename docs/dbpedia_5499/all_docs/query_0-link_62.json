        "text": "UTD will pay the Student Health Insurance Plan student premium for the months they are an eligible RA / TA / GA at .5 FTE and have worked at least one day of the month. Students lose eligibility for funded SHIP when they are not actively working in an eligible RA / TA / GA position including when on leave of absence, short work break, change to a non-eligible position, have any gap in eligible employment or falling below .5 FTE. If you lose eligibility, your funded insurance coverage will end on the last day of the month you were actively working, and we will email you possible options to continue your Student Health Insurance Plan when your status changes in job data.\n\nSHIP is a student benefit and your eligibility to continue coverage is dependent on your student status at the time you lose coverage. Your domestic or international visa status, how many credit hours you are registered in on census day for that term, and when you lose coverage will determine if you qualify to enroll in Student Health Insurance through Academic HealthPlans directly when you lose eligibility for funded SHIP. Information on your enrollment options will be sent to you at the time your department updates your assignment in job data.\n\nInternational students (F-1, F-2, J-1, or J-2 visa) losing coverage in the middle of a term they are registered students will be enrolled in SHIP by the Bursar Office as required by UT System for the months no longer eligible for funded SHIP. The premium cost for the months you are not working as an eligible employee will be added to your Bursar student account as a partial term insurance charge. The RA/TA SHIP Team will email you when the charge is reflected on your student account. The student must contact Academic HealthPlans to continue dependent enrollment in coverage within 31 days from enrollment in partial term insurance. For insurance purposes, term dates are 8/1-12/31 (Fall), 1/1-5/31 (Spring), and 6/1-7/31 (Summer).\n\nInternational students continuing at UTD who lose funded SHIP coverage in May who are not registering for courses or internship for the summer term can enroll in SHIP coverage directly through the Academic HealthPlans website for summer (6/1-7/31) if they choose and will pay Academic HealthPlans directly. The “International Students Not Enrolled in Summer Courses” link on the Academic HealthPlans enrollment page will be available during the SHIP summer enrollment period along with deadlines to do so.\n\nDomestic students losing coverage in the middle of a term may enroll in SHIP for the remainder of the term via qualified event (QE) if they meet student eligibility requirements on census day of that term. The deadline to enroll via qualified event is 30 days from the date your funded coverage ended.\n\nThose no longer meeting student eligibility requirements may enroll in 3 months of continuation coverage if they were enrolled in SHIP coverage for at least the last four months prior to enrolling in continuation coverage. The deadline to enroll in continuation coverage is 31 days from the date your funded coverage ended.\n\nNote: SHIP is a student benefit, not an employee benefit, therefore not included in COBRA coverage offered when you leave UTD employment.\n\nFunded Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) coverage will be effective retroactively to the first day of the month hired for all eligible student employees. Funded coverage ends the last day of the month you were actively working in an eligible RA /TA / GA position. (See Loss of Eligibility section) The SHIP policy year for UT Dallas is 8/1-7/31. Your Academic HealthPlans and BCBSTX account may show coverage through the end of the plan year on 7/31, but that date will change if you are no longer eligible for funded SHIP.\n\nCoverage Start Date: Eligible RA / TA / GA will have coverage retroactive to the 1st day of the month in which they are hired. Example: An Eligible RA / TA / GA hired to start working on 9/15 will have SHIP coverage retroactive to 09/01. Eligible student employees will be able to submit claims to the carrier retroactively after their hire date and have been enrolled in SHIP after their department has submitted an ePAR and their assignment is reflected in job data. Academic HealthPlans will email registration and waiver information on or after your hire date.\n\nCoverage End Date: Eligible student employees will lose funded coverage at the end of the month were actively working. Example: Students who are terminated in December will have SHIP coverage paid by UT Dallas through December 31st. Students on short work break during summer who last worked in May would have funded SHIP insurance through May 31st. (See the Loss of Coverage section)\n\nContinuous Coverage: Eligible student employees enrolled in SHIP who are actively working through summer into the new policy year will be automatically enrolled in SHIP again effective 8/1. No action is required of the student to continue SHIP, but dependents must be reenrolled during SHIP annual open enrollment to continue SHIP coverage after 7/31. (See Annual Dependent Enrollment and Annual SHIP Waiver Period Sections)\n\nNote: International students (F1, F2, J1, J2 visa) will be responsible for SHIP insurance premiums the months they were ineligible for funded SHIP coverage during the same term. Example: If hired in September, the international student would be charged for the August SHIP premium on their Bursar student account. If the eligible position ends in November, the international student would be charged for the December SHIP premium on their Bursar student account. Those international students not working in an eligible position during the summer term who do not enroll in classes or internship may enroll themselves in SHIP if they choose through the Academic HealthPlans website under the “International Students Not Enrolled in Summer Courses” option.\n\nEligible students employees will have 31 days of their hire date to request to decline / waive out of the funded Student Health Insurance Plan. International students must have insurance which meets UT System requirements effective the first day of the month they are hired to waive SHIP.\n\nAll waiver requests must be submitted through Academic HealthPlans via the “RA/TA Part-Time Employee” waiver link sent by Academic HealthPlans in your RA / TA / GA waiver registration email after we have enrolled you. An approved RA / TA / GA waiver is effective through 7/31 while continuously working in an eligible position. If you become ineligible and are rehired with a gap in employment and want SHIP at that time, you may email rataship@utdallas.edu to request the RA/TA waiver to be cancelled for the remainder of the plan year.\n\nYou MUST request to waive free SHIP if you choose to enroll in and pay for employee UT Select medical coverage during your UT Benefits Enrollment for employees. See the HR Benefits webpage for Graduate Student Employee Insurance & Benefits for more information on the employee side of benefits or contact HR Benefits at benefits@utdallas.edu. UTD does not allow for enrollment in both the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) medical coverage and the employee UT Select medical insurance plan coverage. If you choose UT Select medical insurance during your employee benefit enrollment, you must complete the “RA/TA Part-Time Employees Waiver” on the Academic HealthPlans website within 31 days of your hire date. International students whose hire date is after the first of the month who choose to enroll in and pay for UT Select medical insurance during their UT Benefits enrollment for employees in lieu of free SHIP coverage will be charged for one month of Student Health Insurance on their Bursar student account and will need to purchase Academic Emergency Services (AES) insurance through Academic HealthPlans as UT Select medical does not meet UT System requirements for emergency services. Please contact rataship@utdallas.edu before your enrollment deadline if choosing to enroll in and pay for UT Select medical insurance so we can help you with your SHIP waiver process. (UT Select medical insurance is separate from the dental and the vision offered on the UT Benefits website. Enrolling in dental or vision does not affect your enrollment in SHIP.) SHIP is a student benefit. Questions on enrollment of any employee benefits on the UT Benefit website should be directed to HR Benefits at benefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nNote: If an international student has an approved term-based student insurance waiver, they will be required to submit an additional waiver form to waive SHIP insurance as a RA / TA / GA by their deadline or they will remain enrolled in SHIP as an RA / TA / GA. Eligible international student employees (F1, F2, J1, or J2 visa) who had already been enrolled in and charged the required term-based SHIP insurance on their Bursar student account will have that term-based insurance cancelled and the charge waived. No action is required by the student to waive term insurance. International students will be responsible for a partial term insurance charge if hired after the first month the term insurance was effective or lose eligibility for funded SHIP before the end of the term.\n\nThe annual Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) waiver period for eligible RA / TA / GA will be held 8/1 – 8/31 for changes effective 8/1. The RA/TA SHIP Team will send out information regarding the annual waiver period each July before the waiver period begins. Academic HealthPlans will send out waiver information to those eligible to waive at the time late in the evening of 8/1 after you are active in the waiver system. The deadline to waive SHIP for the new plan year is 8/31. Those not completing the waiver request and all waiver requirements by 8/31 will remain enrolled in SHIP coverage effective 8/1 until they are no longer eligible for funded SHIP. The RA/TA SHIP waiver will stay in effect through 7/31 or until you lose eligibility to be enrolled in funded SHIP as an RA / TA / GA.\n\nDomestic students may waive SHIP for the new plan year effective 8/1 by submitting the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver on Academic HealthPlans waiver page during the annual RA/TA waiver period from 8/1 -8/31. Academic HealthPlans will email the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver link late in the evening of 8/1 after you are active in the waiver system. The annual SHIP waiver deadline is 8/31. If you have alternative insurance and decide to keep SHIP, you may want to contact your insurance carrier and ask how they would coordinate benefits between the two policies before the waiver deadline.\n\nDomestic students enrolling in UT Select medical insurance during annual UT Benefits Enrollment for employees (7/15 – 7/31) MUST waive SHIP as UTD does not allow for dual enrollment in both. SHIP is student health insurance, so you will not see it listed on the UT Benefits website. Academic HealthPlans will email the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver link late in the evening of 8/1 after you are active in the waiver system. The annual SHIP waiver deadline is 8/31. If you enrolled in UT Select medical insurance during annual UT Benefit Enrollment for employees (7/15 – 7/31), please submit the SHIP waiver as early as possible in August and contact benefits@utdallas.edu and rataship@utdallas.edu so we may coordinate your August medical insurance enrollment and funded SHIP waiver requirement. UT Select medical insurance is employee insurance and you will be responsible for the employee portion of the medical insurance premium. The UT Select medical premium is not free will be deducted from your paycheck. Questions regarding UT Select should be directed to benefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nDomestic students wishing to keep SHIP enrollment effective 8/1 who were previously enrolled in employee UT Select Medical insurance and decline it during the Annual UT Benefits Enrollment for employees (7/15-7/31) should contact benefits@utdallas.edu and rataship@utdallas.edu as soon as possible before 8/31 so we can coordinate your medical insurance enrollment for August.\n\nInternational students (F1, F2, J1, J2 visa) who have other alternative insurance effective 8/1 that meets UT System requirements may waive SHIP as a RA / TA / GA for the new plan year effective 8/1 by submitting the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver form on Academic HealthPlans waiver page during the annual RA/TA waiver period from 8/1 -8/31. Academic HealthPlans will email the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver link late in the evening of 8/1 after you are active in the waiver system. The annual RA/TA SHIP waiver deadline is 8/31. Waiver requirements must be met before the RA/TA SHIP waiver deadline of 8/31 or you will remain enrolled in SHIP until you are no longer eligible for funded SHIP. UT Select medical insurance is separate from the dental and the vision offered on the UT Benefits website. Enrolling in dental or vision on the UT Benefits website does not affect your enrollment in SHIP. You only need to waive SHIP as a RA / TA / GA if you enroll in UT Select medical insurance.\n\nInternational students (F1, F2, J1, J2 visa) who choose to enroll in UT Select medical insurance during the Annual UT Benefits Enrollment for employees (7/15-7/31) in lieu of keeping their free SHIP coverage MUST waive the free SHIP coverage as an RA / TA / GA for the plan year starting 8/1 using the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver form on Academic HealthPlans waiver page during the annual RA/TA waiver period from 8/1 -8/31. International students enrolling in UT Select medical insurance during annual UT Benefits enrollment for employees will be enrolled in and charged for one month of Student Health Insurance on their Bursar student account for the month of August ($287.00). You will then be required to submit the August SHIP coverage documentation which rataship@utdallas.edu can provide to you. You must also submit the UT Benefits summary page showing the UT Select medical insurance effective date of coverage. After you have submitted the “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” waiver including all required documentation, Academic HealthPlans will email you a link to purchase Academic Emergency Services (AES) insurance as it will be required to waive SHIP as UT Select medical insurance does not offer the minimum AES coverage required by UT System for international students.\n\nPlease contact rataship@utdallas.edu before 7/31 if choosing to enroll in and pay for UT Select medical insurance instead of keeping your funded SHIP enrollment so we can help you with your SHIP waiver process. The “RA/TA Part -Time Employees” SHIP waiver must be approved by Academic HealthPlans by 8/31. UT Select medical insurance is separate from the dental and the vision offered on the UT Benefits website. Enrolling in dental or vision on the UT Benefits website does not affect your enrollment in SHIP. You only need to waive SHIP as a RA / TA / GA if you enroll in UT Select medical insurance.\n\nUT Select medical insurance is employee insurance and you will be responsible for the medical insurance premium which will be deducted monthly from your paycheck. Questions on enrollment of any employee benefits on the UT Benefit website should be directed to HR Benefits at benefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nEligible RA / TA / GA student employees will still have the option to choose their medical insurance plan.\n\nPlease keep in mind you are in a hybrid role due to your student status and benefits eligible employee status. This means you are eligible for two different categories of benefits: Student Benefits, and Employee Benefits. SHIP is the student medical insurance benefit. For more information regarding Employee Benefits, please refer to Office of Human Resources website hr.utdallas.edu/employees/benefits/insurance/graduate-students or contact Benefits at benefits@utdallas.edu. Eligible RA / TA / GA may remain enrolled under SHIP coverage or waive it and enroll themselves in UT Select medical insurance but can’t be enrolled in both. Either SHIP must be waived, or UT Select health insurance on the employee side must be declined. (See the Waiving SHIP for New Hires and the Annual SHIP Waiver Period sections)\n\nIf an eligible student employee decides to keep the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) student benefit, there is no medical premium to be paid for the student while eligible. On the employee side, they then have the option within 31 days from gaining SHIP to be eligible to enroll in Premium Sharing Credit when declining UT Select employee medical insurance and apply it toward dental, vision, and AD&D through My UTD Benefits. For more information and instructions on how to enroll in Premium Sharing Credit, please see the Graduate Student Employee Insurance & Benefits webpage. Questions regarding Premium Sharing Credit and enrollment into benefits other than SHIP should be directed to benefits@utdallas.edu.\n\nIf the RA / TA / GA elects UT Select medical insurance during their UT Benefit enrollment period on the employee side, they will be responsible for the employee portion of the medical insurance premium. The approximate amount is $390.12 * per month.\n\nWhen choosing to enroll in UT Select medical insurance instead of keeping SHIP, the student employee MUST also waive the RA / TA / GA SHIP insurance using the waiver form link provided by Academic HealthPlans in the registration email sent to you. UTD does not allow for enrollment in both the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) medical coverage and the employee UT Select medical insurance plan coverage. If you choose UT Select medical insurance during your employee benefit enrollment, you must complete the “RA/TA Part-Time Employees Waiver” request on the Academic HealthPlans waiver page within 31 days of your hire date. (See the Waiving SHIP for New Hires and the Annual SHIP Waiver Period sections)\n\nInternational students whose hire date is after the first of the month who choose to enroll in and pay for UT Select medical insurance in lieu of free SHIP coverage will be charged for one month of Student Health Insurance on their Bursar student account and will need to purchase Academic Emergency Services (AES) insurance through Academic HealthPlans. Please contact rataship@utdallas.edu if choosing to enroll in and pay for UT Select medical insurance so we can help you with your SHIP waiver process. (UT Select medical insurance is separate from the dental and the vision offered on the UT Benefits website. Enrolling in dental or vison does not affect your enrollment in SHIP.) SHIP is a student benefit. Questions on enrollment of any employee benefits on the UT Benefit website should be directed to HR Benefits at benefits@utdallas.edu.\n\n*Based on 2024-2025 plan year.\n\nNote: Dental and vision insurance offered on the Academic HealthPlans website are not included in the funded SHIP program and is not an option to select through Academic HealthPlans as part of the funded SHIP insurance program. Please refer to options of enrolling in Premium Sharing Credit on the HR Benefits webpage for Graduate Student Employee Insurance & Benefits. HR Benefits may also be contacted at benefits@utdallas.edu to help with employee benefit enrollment."
