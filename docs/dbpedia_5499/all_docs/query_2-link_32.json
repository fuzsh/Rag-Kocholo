The staff is professional and genuinely approachable, making the transition into this academic environment smooth and reassuring.\n\nThe prompt and clear communication from the academic advisors has been outstanding. They have patiently addressed all my queries, providing detailed guidance on course selection, registration processes, and educational resources. This proactive support is precious for new students navigating the complexities of higher education.\n\nAll is aligning so that I can enter the Communications PhD program at Regent. Thus far, they have been willing to make sure that I have all of the information that I need to excel and succeed. If I must speak on something that is not enlightening, I would say that I am waiting on one of my transcripts and funding to be fully accepted into the program of 5 years."
