        "text": "Regent University can be found in Virginia Beach, VA, a nonprofit private college which focuses on only a select few programs offered. Around 11,000 students are enrolled at Regent University.\n\nMany of the students admitted to this school got an SAT score within the range of 990 - 1220, or got accepted with an ACT composite score between 19 - 25. We were able to estimate the Regent University average GPA (2.98 - 3.33) of admitted students by applying sampled GPA data on over 150 schools. Regent University accepts roughly 90% of students applying per year. Of those that are accepted, about 19% registered for enrollment. Using acceptance rate data from previous years, we can project that the Regent University acceptance rate in 2021 is going to be around 77%. You can get more information from the admissions office website at .regent.edu."
