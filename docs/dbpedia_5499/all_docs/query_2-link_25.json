        "text": "HISTORY\n\nDr. M.G. “Pat” Robertson founder and president of the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN), had an inspired vision of establishing a graduate-level institution that would train mature men and women for the challenge of representing Christ in their professions. In 1977, the vision materialized when CBN University was incorporated as a nonprofit educational institution in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In the fall of 1978, students began classes in modest, rented facilities.\n\nBy October 1989, CBN University had grown from a School of Communication & the Arts to seven professional schools with nearly 800 students. On January 1, 1990, in recognition of this growth, the board of trustees voted to change the name of CBN University to Regent University. A “regent” is one who represents a king in his absence. For Regent University, a regent is one who represents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of the life he or she may be called to serve Him.\n\nToday, more than 10,000 students earn associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees at the school’s campus in Virginia Beach, Virginia, or via online learning. Our student body represents 52 countries; and over 34,000 alumni are making an impact in all sectors around the world.\n\nOur academic programs are as rigorous as they are rewarding. Regent student teams regularly win national competitions in their fields of study, and our alumni have been honored for professional achievements in their disciplines.\n\nLikewise, Regent campus buildings, designed within an architectural master plan, reflect a commitment to our nation’s colonial heritage but are also equipped with the latest educational technologies.\n\nCertainly, the distinct mission of Regent has drawn students, administrators, and distinguished faculty and guest lecturers from around the world to contribute to its fulfillment. Regent employs 144 full-time and some 700 adjunct faculty, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft, a Distinguished Professor of Law and Government and Admiral Vern Clark (ret.), former Chief of Naval Operations, a Distinguished Professor of Leadership and Government. Review Regent University Facts for a closer look at the accomplishments and prominence Regent University shares with schools many times its age.\n\nBeyond milestone events, dates, or facts and figures, Regent’s mission to combine Christianity and world-class education has kept the university on course. True to its well-established roots, Regent remains a premier educational institution dedicated to combining quality education with biblical teachings. The dramatic changes that have taken place are the result of divine inspiration and unwavering dedication to the mission as reflected in our motto Christian Leadership to Change the World.\n\nSCHOOLS at REGENT UNIVERSITY\n\nAllied Health\n\nCollege of Arts & Sciences\n\nCollege of Health & Behavioral Sciences\n\nBusiness & Leadership\n\nCommunication & the Arts\n\nDivinity\n\nEducation\n\nGovernment\n\nHonors College\n\nLaw\n\nNursing\n\nPsychology & Counseling\n\nSTUDENT PROFILE\n\nAverage age: 38\n\nFull-time undergraduate students: 28\n\nPart-time undergraduate students: 37\n\nAll undergraduate students: 32\n\nFull-time graduate students: 39\n\nPart-time graduate students: 44\n\nAll graduate students: 42\n\nEnrollment status\n\n46% Full-time students, 54% Part-time students\n\nGender\n\n64% Female, 36% Male enrollment\n\nStudent body\n\n2% Foreign/International\n\n30% African-American or Black\n\n1% American Indian or Alaska Native\n\n2% Asian/Pacific Islander\n\n10% Hispanic\n\n42% White/Caucasian American\n\n3% Two or more races\n\n10% Unknown/Unreported\n\nApproximately 800 students live on campus.\n\nFACULTY\n\n144 full-time faculty\n\nApproximately 700 individuals serve as adjunct faculty members throughout the academic year\n\nALUMNI"
