        "meta_description": "Regent University, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is a private Christian university. In terms of student population, Regent has an enrollment of around 4,500 undergraduate students. Regent's size offers a relatively small and tight-knit community, which can be appealing to students who prefer closer connections with peers and faculty.\r\n\r\nDiversity at Regent is steadily improving. According to the most recent data available, the racial/ethnic breakdown of undergraduate students is as follows: 48% White, 25% Black or African American, 11% Hispanic or Latino, 2% Asian, and the remaining percentage is comprised of students from other races or with multiple racial backgrounds. International students also contribute to the cultural diversity at Regent.\r\n\r\nWhile these statistics provide a quick overview of Regent's demographics, it's important to remember that the campus atmosphere and overall sense of community are also significant factors. To get a feel for the environment on campus, I recommend visiting the university, reaching out to current students or alumni, and exploring online forums and social media pages dedicated to the Regent University community. This way, you can gain a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the school's culture and determine if it's a good fit for you.",
