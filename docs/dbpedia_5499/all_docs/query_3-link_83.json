The Educational Facilities Revenue Bonds, Series 2006 were issued through the Virginia College Building Authority. The outlook is stable.RATINGS RATIONALEThe rating upgrade to Ba2 from Ba3 incorporates Regent's continued positive operating performance, with no reliance on endowment for the third consecutive year, in addition to the January 2021 pay off of its $33.5 million operating line of credit that reduced debt by nearly 30%, eliminated line of credit renewal risk, and released cash and investment collateral. Ongoing momentum with positive operating cash flow margins will contribute to growth in cash and investments, adding longer term financial cushion. The fiscal 2020 operating cash flow margin of 14.7% covered debt service by 3.5x. Fiscal 2021 operations are on track for similar performance despite impacts from the coronavirus pandemic due primarily to conservative revenue assumptions. With a largely online student body - 83% of its 10,490 headcount enrollment - Regent has already invested in online delivery modalities and, further, has more modest exposure to auxiliary enterprises (average 6% over fiscal 2016-20), which have been a source of revenue disruption at many universities.The Ba2 rating further acknowledges the university's high reliance on student charges and moderate liquidity. Regent's primarily online student market remains very vulnerable to the rising number of online competitors. Further, while there was a release of investments collateralizing the line of credit, pro forma spendable cash and investments to debt and operations remain modest at 0.5x and 0.3x, respectively, with 131 days cash on hand. Fair strategic positioning reflects Regent's competitive operating environment, limited donor support, and the consideration of key person risk under our governance taxonomy; however, senior leadership team changes over the last three years that have stewarded positive operations following over a decade of shortfalls indicate improved governance and will build credibility if sustained.RATING OUTLOOKThe stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Regent will sustain its fiscal discipline, with positive cash flow adding to financial reserves. The outlook also incorporates Moody's expectations that management will continue to control expenses, with little to no use of endowment or additional debt, while implementing its strategic plan to grow enrollment.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATING- Demonstrated ability to sustain to operating revenue growth and strong operating performance- Ongoing gains in total cash and investments including unrestricted liquidityFACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING- Return to weak operating performance- Reduction of liquidity relative to debt and operations- Evidence of building student market pressures, reflected in declining enrollment or net tuition revenueLEGAL SECURITYThe Series 2006 revenue bonds have a secured interest in Unrestricted University Revenues. The Loan Agreement incorporates limits on additional parity indebtedness. Under these limits pro forma debt should be less than total cash and investments and less than 2.0x expendable financial resources. There is a cash funded debt service reserve fund.PROFILERegent University is a private university founded in 1978 by Pat Robertson. Regent offers associates, bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees, including a law school, at its campus in Virginia Beach and online. The university generated operating revenue of $126 million in fiscal 2020 and enrolled over 10,490 students on a headcount basis and 7,907 full-time equivalent (FTE) students in fall 2020.METHODOLOGYThe principal methodology used in this rating was Higher Education published in May 2019 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1175020.
