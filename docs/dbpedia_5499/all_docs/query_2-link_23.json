        "text": "Overview of Regent University (RU)\n\nFrom inception, the universityâ€™s primary focus has been on transforming the world. To achieve this, Regent University consistently delivers excellent graduate and undergraduate programs, both online and on campus. It strives to prepare Christian leaders for lives of significant purpose and service. The institution serves as a center of Christian thought and action to provide excellent education through a biblical perspective and global context.\n\nThe total student population is 10,300+. Of those, approximately 4,500 are pursuing undergraduate degrees. The university also employs 133 full-time and 51 part-time faculty members, all of whom are responsible for instructional pursuits. The resulting student-to-faculty ratio is 21:1, which is slightly higher than the national average. As a result, students may find it a little more difficult to interact with professors one-on-one.\n\nRU Tuition Cost & Financial Aid\n\nBest Value Schools ranked Regent University #1 for best value college in Virginia in 2021. Lending Tree also identified the school as the #1 most affordable college in the state that same year. In fact, according to US News & World Report in 2020, the institution has an annual tuition that is nearly $20,000 less than that of other private schools.\n\nThe actual cost of earning an education at Regent University will depend on the number of course credits taken and the type of degree sought. As a private institution, however, studentsâ€™ residency status does not impact tuition rates.\n\nFor most programs, the on-campus tuition block rate per semester is $9,040 for 12 to 18 credit hours. Those taking under 12 credits will be charged $603 per hour, with an average tuition of $7,236 per semester. Online rates are different. Part-time students taking between three and 11 credit hours per semester are charged $450 per credit hour. Full-time students enrolled in 12 or more credit hours, on the other hand, will owe only $395 per credit hour.\n\nGraduate students are also charged differently. The standard tuition cost per credit hour is $695 for masterâ€™s degree programs and $1,020 for doctorate degree programs. Notably, some areas of study cost more than others. Those enrolled in communication and arts, for example, are expected to pay $920 per semester hour instead. Conversely, students studying divinity pay only $515 per credit hour. As a result, all incoming students should pay very close attention to the tuition rates assigned their specific degree.\n\nIn addition to tuition, Regent University also charges a service fee each semester. This fee is $650 for online students and $800 for on-campus students. It is intended to cover the cost of various resources, support, advising, ministry, and services. For on-campus students, it also covers counseling, security, student activities, parking, and health center access.\n\nStudents must also anticipate the cost of books and supplies, as well as transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses. Those living off campus with family may be able to save significantly on room and board. Regent University does, however, offer student housing. Rates range from $4,233 to $5,843 per semester.\n\nTo help students reach their goals, the institution has a financial aid team available to design packages to suit most situations. Regent University offers federal, state, private, and school-funded scholarship, as well as access to various government grants and loans. In fact, over $22 million in institutional scholarship and aid were awarded during the 2021-2022 academic year alone. All incoming students are encouraged to complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to help determine need. During the 2020-2021 academic year, 100% of students entering postsecondary education for the first time at the university received some form of financial assistance. Many were awarded grants and scholarships, with only 51% of students still requiring loans.\n\nAverage net price 2020-2021 Net Price $16,579 Average Total Aid $13,174 Students Receiving Financial Aid 100% Room & Board $7,004\n\nAcademics\n\nRegent University offers associate, bachelorâ€™s, masterâ€™s, and doctoral degrees from a Christian perspective. The institution is proud to offer a broad selection of degrees and certificates, which opportunities to chisel programs further by selecting concentrations. All programs are resigned to cultivate greater knowledge and strengths.\n\nStudents can choose from over 150 areas of study in the following fields:\n\nArts and Communication\n\nBusiness and Leadership\n\nDivinity and Theology\n\nEducation\n\nLaw\n\nGeneral Studies\n\nGovernment, and History\n\nNursing and Healthcare\n\nPsychology and Counseling\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering, and Math\n\nThe university also offers online degree programs at the associate, bachelorâ€™s, masterâ€™s, and doctoral levels. Online certificate programs are also available. Notably, US News & World Report ranked Regent University #1 for the best online bachelorâ€™s programs in Virginia in 2022, for the tenth year in a row.\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Regent University had a first-year undergraduate retention rate of 74% for full-time students and 30% for part-time students in fall 2020. This is above the national average of 68% and indicates that most students enrolled at the university full-time were pleased enough with their academic and extracurricular experiences to return for a second year.\n\nGraduation rates for Regent University were slightly lower. Of full-time, first-time students who began their studies in 2015, 62% graduated within 150% of normal time. The preferred graduation timeframe is four years, but only 43% of the students included in the study completed all requirements within this time. However, the transfer-out rate was also 21%, which may indicate that those students were prepared by their education here for a program that was only available elsewhere. If most of those 21% of students graduate, the true graduation rate could be as high as 75-80%.\n\nRegent University is regionally accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), which is recognized by the United States Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. The institution is authorized to award baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Additionally, the institution has many programmatic accreditations."
