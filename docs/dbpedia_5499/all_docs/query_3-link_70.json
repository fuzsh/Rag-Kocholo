Regent Law is dedicated to helping students on their path to success by providing two LSAT Workshops to teach participants how to effectively answer the three types of multiple-choice questions typically featured on the LSAT.

It is important to note that all applications must be received by July 31 to be considered, as applications submitted after this date will only be accepted.\n\nEarly Commitment Program\n\nRegent Law's Early Commitment Program (ECP) is an attractive opportunity for applicants to receive exclusive benefits such as enhanced scholarship opportunities, priority consideration for Faculty Scholar Fellowships, and a $500 tuition scholarship for the first year of law school. This program requires applicants to make a binding decision to commit to enrolling at Regent Law by March 1 if admitted. Once accepted into the program, applicants must withdraw all other law school applications and may not initiate any more applications to other law schools.\n\nThis binding commitment assures applicants that they will receive priority admissions consideration from Regent Law and the opportunity to take advantage of exclusive scholarship benefits. Additionally, applicants who meet the ECP deadlines will be able to complete the admissions process and secure their place at Regent Law several months before the start of classes.\n\nRegent Law's Early Commitment Program provides applicants with a unique opportunity to make a binding commitment for admission, receive enhanced scholarship benefits, gain priority consideration for Faculty Scholar Fellowships, and take advantage of other exclusive benefits.

This fee can be paid via check or money order and should be payable to the university. All payments should be emailed to Regent University, Enrollment Support Services, 1000 Regent University Drive, Virginia Beach, VA 23464.\n\nPlease note that the fee is nonrefundable and will not be returned should your application for admission be denied or withdrawn. The university must also receive the payment before processing your application for admission.\n\nTranscripts\n\nTo ensure that your academic record is accurately reflected in your application, you must submit all official transcripts from each institution you have attended to the Law School Admission Council (LSAC). Suppose you have been accepted into Regent Law before you have completed your undergraduate degree. In that case, it is essential that an official transcript, which has been marked as posted, is sent to the Law School before your enrollment. This will ensure that your academic record is correctly reflected in your application.\n\nLSAC provides a convenient online service that allows you to quickly request and submit transcripts from any institution you have attended. This service is available for both domestic and international institutions. Once you have requested the transcripts from your school, they will be sent directly to LSAC for processing and routing to Regent Law School. It is essential to remember that it may take several weeks for a transcript request to be processed and delivered, so please plan accordingly.\n\nLSAT Scores\n\nProspective law school students must take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and sign up for the Credential Assembly Service (CAS). The LSAT is conducted multiple times during the year, and more information on the upcoming test dates can be found on the LSAC website. It is recommended that applicants attempt the LSAT several months before enrolling in a law school.\n\nAn applicantâ€™s score on the LSAT is an essential factor that the admissions committee considers when evaluating their application. The highest score among the tests taken by an applicant will be given more weight, but all of the scores are taken into account while making a decision. Applicants who score below 154 may be advised to retake the LSAT.\n\nLetters of Recommendation\n\nApplicants must submit at least one academic recommendation, even if the degree was obtained online. However, a general recommendation can be submitted for those who have been out of school for five or more years. In addition, Regent also encourages applicants to provide a spiritual recommendation from a pastor or other spiritual leader to provide insights into the applicant's faith. Furthermore, a general recommendation from an employer of the applicant may also be submitted. It is recommended that up to four letters of recommendation be sent to LSAC using their LOR service.\n\nFinally, applicants are required to provide a personal statement which must be between 500 and 1000 words in length. This essay will give the admissions committee a better understanding of the applicant's passion and motivation for studying law and their commitment to receiving a legal education that integrates Christian principles and ethics. This statement should also provide knowledge of any special skills or abilities developed through employment experiences.\n\nOverall, these recommendations and personal statements will allow the admissions committee to understand better the applicant and their motivations for pursuing a legal education.\n\nCost of Attendance\n\nTotal Cost of Attendance 2022-23 Full-time J.D.
