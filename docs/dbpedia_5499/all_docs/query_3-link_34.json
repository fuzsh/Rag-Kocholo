        "text": "Pretty amazing that the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) tentatively gave the 'green light' for institutions to begin offering/exploring 3-year undergraduate degree programs. We've spent years lamenting the resistance to innovation (real or perceived) from accrediting agencies. But there are two things to consider: 1) Accrediting agencies are mainly staffed by volunteers from higher education institutions, and 2) Behind every organization, there exists a decision-maker. Finding who that person is and what influences their decision is the key. This could be the beginning of a massive reimagining of higher education. However, the culture of higher education is a powerful force, and the enemy is often within.\n\nUnpopular opinion: elite higher education is not broken. In fact, it's the envy of the world. The resignation of Harvard's President Claudine Gay is a terrible foreshadowing of trouble in 2024 for American higher education. The catalogue of alleged woes is long. Why are so few speaking aloud some undeniable facts about American universities? American universities remain a beacon of excellence when it comes to research, knowledge, and discovery. Students from around the world seek to study at American universities. And when they earn their degrees, they often seek to stay in the U.S. because of the opportunities afforded here. Many believe the main function of a university is education of undergraduates. And this is why so many are obsessed with rising tuition costs and the rules of admission to selective colleges. But an equally if not more important function is research productivity. American research universities provide global public goods, are the source of scientific and technological breakthroughs, and create economic growth and opportunity. Name a place in the world that would not wish for a Harvard, Stanford, Yale, MIT, Berkeley, or Michigan in its backyard. American higher education needs better defenders.\n\nYale University Reinstates Standardized Testing Requirement: A New Chapter in College Admissions In a move that marks a significant shift in the landscape of higher education admissions, Yale University has announced the reinstatement of a standardized testing requirement for all first-year undergraduate applicants, starting with the fall 2025 admissions cycle. This decision introduces a renewed focus on standardized assessments, offering applicants the flexibility to submit scores from one of four testing options: the ACT, Advanced Placement (AP) exams, the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, or the SAT. Yale's approach to admissions has always been characterized by its holistic review process, a tradition that will continue as the university integrates these testing requirements. The institution has clarified that it harbors no preference for one test over another, ensuring that students from diverse educational backgrounds can choose the testing format that best aligns with their strengths and academic experiences. This strategic pivot is underpinned by Yale's commitment to fostering an inclusive and diverse student body. Recent research has suggested that the absence of standardized testing requirements could inadvertently marginalize students from lower-income households, first-generation college aspirants, and those hailing from rural areas. By reintroducing these assessments into the admissions equation, Yale aims to level the playing field, providing an additional metric to identify and support talented students from all walks of life. Furthermore, Yale's own investigations have reinforced the value of standardized tests as a predictive tool for academic success. According to the university's data, test scores have emerged as the most reliable indicator of a student's potential academic performance at Yale, even when adjusting for variables such as family income and demographic factors. This insight underscores the role standardized tests can play in enhancing the predictive accuracy of the admissions process, ultimately benefiting both the institution and its students. Yale's decision arrives amidst a broader debate on the role of standardized testing in college admissions. While some colleges and universities have embraced a test-optional policy, Yale's move signals a reevaluation of the merits of standardized assessments in achieving a diverse and academically robust student cohort. As the higher education community continues to navigate these complex considerations, Yale's policy shift is poised to spark further discussion on the best practices for identifying and nurturing talent across the socioeconomic spectrum. #YaleUniversity #HigherEducation #StandardizedTesting #CollegeAdmissions #ACT #SAT #AP #IB #DiversityInEducation #EducationalEquity #AdmissionsPolicy #futureofeducation"
