You will complete your application online, and you can stop, save and return at a later time to finish it, if needed. To begin, simply click on the “Apply Now” button, visit the Apply Now page, or call us at 800.373.5504.\n\nWhen are online applications due?\n\nNew sessions start every eight weeks.

Request information to learn more about your program.\n\nFind out more about the admissions process.\n\nWhat are Regent University’s online classes like?\n\nRegent University’s online classes blend the convenience of pursuing your degree where you are, at your own pace, and the experience of being mentored by world-class faculty.\n\n“They have been there for me,” said Kandi Puder, a graduate of the online RN to B.S. in Nursing program, of the faculty. They acted not only as professors but also as counselors and prayer partners.\n\nYou can access classes through Canvas in Regent’s online portal. Canvas allows you access your course syllabus, answer discussions, upload assignments and view grades. In many respects, it’s similar to an on-campus course, but you decide when to log on and complete homework, quizzes, and more.\n\nLearn more about what to expect in an online classroom.\n\nHow do I attend class online?\n\nOnline courses are available through Canvas, Regent’s web-based classroom. Students access Canvas by logging into the MyRegent portal, then view course material, answer discussion posts and submit assignments. Regent’s undergraduate courses don’t require students to be online on specific days or at specific hours, but Canvas gives you the opportunity to log on at a predetermined hour and connect with your professor and classmates in real time.\n\nCan I take classes both online and on campus in Virginia Beach?\n\nFor undergraduate courses, often you can register for both online and on-campus courses. We encourage you to choose whatever format works best for you and your schedule. Do keep in mind that the tuition rate varies by program mode, and financial aid may vary as well. Our online programs provide flexible degrees for adult students who are working, but if you are available to take courses on campus, you are welcome to do that as well.\n\nGraduate programs may only be available on campus or online, so you will need to check with your advisor regarding options for both. Degrees classified as hybrids allow you to combine online courses with on-campus courses—including residencies. Again, check with your advisor for details."
