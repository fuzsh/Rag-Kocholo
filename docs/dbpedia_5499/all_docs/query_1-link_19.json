The 25th percentile LSAT is 152 and the 75th percentile LSAT is 160.\n\nThe median GPA is 3.68. The 25th percentile GPA is 3.4 and the 75th percentile GPA is 3.88.\n\nAt Regent University School of Law, eternal principles of truth and justice inform the teaching, studying, and practice of law. Regent Law offers a rigorous, comprehensive, and skills-intensive legal education founded upon a biblical worldview—recognizing that the legal profession is a calling to serve.\n\nProviding Christ-centered academic excellence since its beginning, Regent Law trains practice-ready, purpose-driven servant leaders. “Grounded in the best of the old and the new, we lay a foundation of first principles of law, the Western Legal and Common Law traditions, and American Constitutionalism, while equipping students with the contemporary knowledge base and practical skills necessary to thrive in any law-related discipline,” explains Michael Hernandez, Regent Law dean.\n\nRegent Law’s highly credentialed and experienced faculty includes graduates of Harvard, Duke, the University of Chicago, the University of Virginia, and Georgetown law schools. According to Dean Hernandez, “What truly sets them apart is their commitment, as Christian legal scholars, to integrate faith thoroughly in and outside the classroom and mentor the next generation of lawyers.” Distinguished faculty include former United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and American Center for Law and Justice Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow.\n\nWhile affirming the faith of individual students, the school embraces a biblical worldview, encouraging students to see law as a calling, not merely a job. This worldview provides a platform for developing the highest ethical standards in its students and makes Regent a diverse and supportive academic community.\n\nAlthough Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, just minutes from the Atlantic Ocean and only three-and-a-half hours from Washington, DC, the university maintains a national and global focus. Regent alumni practice law in 49 states and over 20 nations, serving as distinguished lawyers, judges, professors, government leaders, and public interest advocates. Additionally, Regent’s Center for Global Justice, Human Rights, and the Rule of Law gives students the opportunity to partner with other legal initiatives around the world and gain firsthand experience working on human rights issues."
