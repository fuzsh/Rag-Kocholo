        "text": "We are excited that Regent University is on your radar. Choosing a college is a major life decision, and you are wise to consider many factors as you narrow your options and commit to a school. What’s a great way to start? Compare the benefits and consider what matters most to you.\n\nLet’s explore the top 5 reasons to attend Regent University:\n\nAccreditation & High-Quality Academics\n\nFlexible & Customizable Degree Programs\n\nEnriched On-Campus Life\n\nExceptional Value & Affordable Choices\n\nFaith Integration & Spiritual Growth\n\n1. Accreditation & High-Quality Academics\n\nDid you know accreditation is the mark of academic excellence? Regent University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.* Accreditation raises the bar for the quality of instruction, financial aid, academic scholarship, fiscal responsibility, and credit transfer made available to students.\n\nRanked among top national universities (U.S. News & World Report), Regent is one of only 23 universities nationally “A” rated for comprehensive liberal arts curriculum (American Council of Trustees and Alumni). Being recognized among top colleges underscores our deep commitment to academic excellence and superior student outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, Regent’s online programs have been recognized as the best in the nation and in Virginia. In 2020, Study.com ranked Regent the #1 Best Accredited Online School, and for nine consecutive years, U.S. News & World Report has ranked Regent the #1 Best Online Bachelor’s Program in Virginia.\n\n2. Flexible & Customizable Degree Programs\n\nYou’ll enjoy Regent’s flexible and customizable degrees. Regent offers associate, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in more than 150 areas of study, including business, communication and the arts, cybersecurity and technology, divinity, education, government, law, leadership, nursing, healthcare, and psychology and counseling.\n\nRegent’s fully-accredited, top-quality academics are conveniently available online or on campus in Virginia Beach, VA. We also offer eight-week course sessions with up to eight starts per year, providing you with flexibility.\n\nDeciding between an online or on-campus degree program is something else to consider. You will find many of our programs offer courses both online and on campus, enabling you to create a hybrid plan that’s not just convenient and flexible but enables you to enjoy both the online and on-campus experience.\n\nWhether you study online or on campus, you can receive excellent academics in a supportive environment.\n\nOur online programs provide a greater way for you to balance the demands of daily life while pursuing the credentials you need—without sacrificing quality. Plus, you can enjoy online activities and events that keep you connected to the Regent community. Thanks to today’s seamless technological opportunities, even on campus students sometimes choose to connect virtually with fellow students and professors, too.\n\n3. Enriched On-Campus Experience\n\nOur on-campus experience does offer more student life engagement opportunities with 230+ annual campus events, weekly chapels, 57 student organizations, and Regent Royals athletic program (11 NCCAA division teams and intramural club sports). Our stunning 70-acre campus is recognized worldwide for its Georgian-style architecture. As a bonus, students love our surrounding coastal community with resort beaches and a lively metropolitan area with thriving restaurants, retail, entertainment, attractions, historical sites, parks, trails, and more. It’s no wonder so many students from all over the world call Virginia Beach home!\n\nPlus, on-campus safety is a top priority here and something we are recognized for: Regent is the #1 Safest College in Virginia (YourLocalSecurity.com, 2021). Our security resources provide around-the-clock patrols for residence halls and campus buildings 365 days a year.\n\nWhether you choose an online or on-campus format at Regent, we encourage you to check out our campus. Schedule your campus visit at regent.edu/visit, or take a virtual tour of our beautiful campus at regent.edu/virtualtour.\n\n4. Exceptional Value & Affordable Choices\n\nOn average, Regent’s annual tuition is nearly $20,000 less than other private institutions. Regent is also the #1 most affordable private college in Virginia (Student Loan Hero, 2021). Through scholarships and financial aid, we are making college more affordable. Eighty-six percent of our students receive financial aid. Last year alone, students received nearly $24 million in institutional scholarships and aid.\n\nWith value-added benefits like flexible tuition payment options, generous acceptance of transfer credits, and financial aid experts ready to help you gain maximum assistance, you’ll quickly realize that a Regent education is attainable.\n\nRegent offers a solid return on your investment. When you’re ready, we can help you find a financial aid package that fits your needs. Want to project your costs before moving forward? Use our Regent Net Price Calculator at regent.edu/npc.\n\n5. Faith Integration & Spiritual Growth Coaching\n\nDid you know Regent is one of the fastest-growing Christian universities in the nation? Our students enjoy all the benefits of learning at a top-ranked national university, with Christ-centered curriculum and a biblical worldview.\n\nAt Regent, you can enjoy studies anchored in Scripture with real-world applications. Our world-class faculty will challenge you to advance your skills and strengthen your faith.\n\nLearning happens outside the classroom, too, and this includes opportunities for spiritual growth. Regent students, professors and staff come alongside each other, supporting, encouraging, and challenging personal growth in your relationship with God.\n\nYou’ll also discover a diverse community of people from many denominations, cultures, backgrounds, and callings here, all with an intentional focus on our shared Christ-centered values. That’s what makes us strong as we strive toward excellence in our studies, work and service to others.\n\nWith weekly campus-wide chapel services, student-led UnChapel, mission trip opportunities, and Campus Ministries outreach and support, you can expand your spiritual life, experience personal growth, and foster deep connections.\n\nBoth online and on campus, you will find many ways to participate in the spiritual community at Regent. We invite you to experience the presence of God with Regent as you dive in fully to worship, pray, study, serve, and connect.\n\nAre You Ready to Experience the Regent Difference?\n\nSince 1978, Regent has prepared generations of Christian leaders—over 30,000 alumni—to excel with purpose and make a positive difference in the world. Whether you already know what career you want to pursue or are still undecided, we can guide you.\n\nLet Regent help you explore your interests and choose a degree program that will equip you to stand out in some of the most in-demand fields today.
