My first mentor took time out of her incredible schedule and prepared meaningful times together with each meeting. I learned what was possible for my future, which was pivotal for me. My second mentor provided insight and guidance for my career. The mentors in the program are awesome. Life is busy and there is no perfect time, but the investment you make during the EMP will be well worth it.”\n\nLinda Santiago-King, MBA, 2024 Mentee"
