        "text": "For the past ten years, we have had a class in Regent University School of Law University Law School first-year curriculum. Virginia Office of the Attorney General Jason Miyares visited the last two years, and many speakers ranging from practicing attorneys to those familiar with the real consequences (to body, mind, and soul) of those who fail to develop a moral compass. Yes, we teach the truth about the Model Rules. They are the bare minimum to avoid punishment. The \"secret\" we seek to expose is that if one does not develop a compass and commit to one's values, practicing law will lead to a series of questions--with many not seeming \"big\"--but on which it's easy to compromise one's values. The process begins with compromising/reintegrating (unconsciously) into a new, lesser self. It happens so subtly that the resulting moral drift is imperceptible until, seven, eight, or ten years later, the lawyer realizes he or she does not like oneself. I used to think stress was the reason for the legal profession leading all professions in substance abuse, depression/anxiety, divorce, and suicide. I now believe the answer is in the moral drift described above. To prepare students in a way in which they avoid that trap, we not only have students read and write reflections on how they can see multiple interests in tension in the scenarios of actual cases and questions lawyers face. Our Center for Professional Formation: https://lnkd.in/eXivBhKR (https://lnkd.in/ebKVQqrv) is also pivotal in building on the first-year course. Students prepare a Discernment Plan where the student answers questions and reflects on the student's gifts and challenges. In the Plan, the student then--keeping in mind their gifts--considers where they can serve others in the law. We provide a Faculty Mentor and, if the student wants, an Alumni Mentor. I'm very proud of this year's class. Their Discernment Plans grasped better than any I can recall what we're trying to do. They know that the Plans are living documents. The Faculty Mentor is also the student's Advisor, with whom they meet every semester to schedule classes. The Mentor/Advisor discusses progress in the students' discernment of where they are most likely to serve others through law. We believe that, in so doing, they will find purpose. The rest will take care of itself. Diana McBride Bloomquist was the first Regent Student to post her experience in forming a professional identity in her first year read her post at https://lnkd.in/eS76wcgU. Thanks to Diana and, as I said, all the first-years who took seriously this important process.\n\nToday, my students take their first-ever law school exam. I wanted to leave them with a quote that my professor gave us when I took this same class almost ten years ago, and just wanted to share the post I wrote for them: Today as you gear up to take your first law school final, I want to take a moment to recognize the journey you've embarked upon over the last 11 weeks. Law school is not just an academic pursuit; it's a transformational experience that challenges your intellect, shapes your character, and hones in on your ability to advocate and reason. You've spent countless hours reading case law, submitting thought-provoking discussions and assignments, and appropriated your time and energy while juggling full-time jobs, families and other obligations. Now, you face the culmination of your hard work this semester: your first law school final exam. This is more than just a test; it's a milestone. It's natural to feel a mix of excitement and anxiety (lots and lots of anxiety!), but remember, this exam is an opportunity to showcase your understanding and your growth. Each question you encounter is a stepping stone, not just towards your grade, but towards becoming the kind of lawyer you aspire to be. Remember, the practice of law is not just about knowing the answers but about asking the right questions and rigorously challenging the status quo. Your exam is a simulated environment for you to begin mastering these skills. Trust your training and the hard work you've put in over the course of this class. As you prepare, take confidence in the knowledge that you are not alone. You are part of the incredible Lincoln Law School community that believes in your potential and ability to succeed. Your professors, your peers, and the countless legal professionals who have started where you are now (including myself, almost a decade ago)‚Äîwe all support your success. So take a deep breath, trust in the preparation you have done, and step into your exam with determination and courage. This is your moment to shine, to prove to yourself what you are capable of. Remember what Teddy Roosevelt said about the man in the arena: \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena...\" As law students, you are stepping into the arena, not as spectators, but as participants who dare greatly. Good luck, and see you on the other side!\n\n#1 - My time at law school. Law schools don‚Äôt teach you law. üìö This is a cardinal truth often imparted to 4th and 5th-year law students and early graduates, whether they are entering corporate law firms, litigation, or most other legal professions. This sentiment holds a considerable measure of weight. Consider the vast number of statutes, legislations, notifications, gazettes, and delegated legislations, each a complex entity on its own. In law school, you're introduced to perhaps 50-60 subjects, making it virtually impossible to learn all laws in the truest sense. But the statement that \"you don't learn the law at law school\" carries a deeper implication. It suggests that the law in action, or justice in action, and the operation of our legal systems and institutions are so intertwined and complex that one cannot fully grasp them from the outside. One must become deeply integrated into the fabric of the legal world, whether it's going to court, mastering the soft skills required to talk to a client, handling difficult court registry tasks, or correcting defects on a Supreme Court special leave petition. üèõÔ∏è However, this raises a critical question: If we acknowledge that law school doesn't truly teach us law, and that law is learned through an intimate interaction with legal institutions and systems, why then does legal education and pedagogy fail to bridge the gap between learning and doing? ü§î But what I am curious to really understand is that if on one hand we have the certainty that law school doesn't teach you law, and on the other hand we have the certainty that the law is in some sense learned only when you intimately interact with legal institutions and systems, then how come in legal education, legal pedagogy, the fact that there exists a bridge between learning and doing is not met? Why is it that law schools focus two semesters on teaching students contract law, spend almost another two semesters teaching students corporate law and so many other subjects, but do not imbibe into students that how can you make contracting simpler? How can you make notarization simpler? How can it be easier to get bail? How can it be easier to file a consumer complaint which doesn't involve sitting for hours in some dilapidated state or district consumer forum? What I am trying to say is that is there today a need to critically examine legal syllabi, legal pedagogy, and understand that what a law school education ostensibly is supposed to give us, be that reflexivity, the power of critical thinking, and the power to just solve problems, is perhaps not something which forms the heart of the learnings with which a law student exits a law school. So, what does law school really teach us? Thoughts and comments? üí≠üë©üéìüë®üéì #LawSchool #LegalEducation #CriticalThinking #LawInPractice\n\nHey fellow law students! Let's face it: law school can be overwhelming. Between classes, readings, assignments, and extracurriculars, it's easy to feel like you're drowning in a sea of cases and statutes. But fear not! With a few simple habits, you can become a disciplined law student and stay on top of your game.I will be sharing some tips which has helped me navigate law school. Here are my top tips which I apply: 1. *Create a schedule and stick to it*: Plan out your day, week, and month. Set aside dedicated time for studying, reviewing, and relaxing or other extra curricular activities Use a planner,app, or any medium that works for you. I personally use an app and I also set alarms to remind me of my schedule. 2. *Prioritize your tasks*: Time is vital to us students,Focus on the most important tasks first, like completing assignments,group reading and preparing for classes, all non -academic activities should come after the above has been done. 3. *Use active learning techniques*: Don't just read passively! Engage with the material by summarizing it in your own words, creating concept maps, or make Abbreviations.Engage in group study to expand your knowledge and gain different perspectives.Discuss and debate with your peers to deepen your understanding. 4. *Review/Revise regularly*: Set aside time each week to review what you've learned. This helps solidify information in your long-term memory and makes it easier to recall. 5. *Take breaks and practice self-care*: It's essential to rest and recharge despite the stress of law school,Schedule time for exercise, or activities that bring you joy.personally I love to hang out with friends or watch movies ü§≠ 6. *Stay organized*: Keep your notes, materials, and digital files organized. This saves time and reduces stress. 7. *Seek help when needed*: Don't be afraid to ask your classmates, mentors, seniors or lecturer for help .Initially I used to be scared to approach my lecturers to ask questions because I found them intimidating üòÇ However I learnt to be bold and ask questions when I didn't understand . Remember the saying \" A closed mouth is a closed destiny\" 8. *Stay motivated*: Remind yourself why you wanted to become a lawyer in the first place. Celebrate your progress and accomplishments along the way.Stay focused, stay motivated, and crush your law school goals! Did you find this helpful? Comment below ---üå∏ü§ç I'm Favour Okeoghene Sajini,a penultimate law Student with passion for advocacy,IP, arbitration and human Rights, I hope to connect with other like minded people who will help me achieve my dream of becoming a high flyer in the legal field-üå∏ü§ç\n\nWe need to change the way we advise law students. When I first considered going to law school and was networking with working attorneys to get their thoughts, I was usually met with a sarcastic, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go.‚Äù And while I understand now (perhaps) where their jadedness comes from, to this day it still frustrates me. Additionally, throughout law school, I received a lot of the same advice over and over: get good grades, get on law review, do moot court and mock trial, get involved, network etc. I got the good grades and wrote-on to law review. I had no interest in moot court and mock trial so therefore did not do those. I got involved in my own personal ways and made networking a priority. And yet, I still graduated without a full-time traditional associate job lined up. So, am I failure? No - but it‚Äôs easy to think that when yet another rejection letter hits my inbox. The issue I have with a lot of the formulaic advice law students receive, and the tone with which it is often delivered, is the fact that it‚Äôs really geared towards that archaic ‚Äòideal‚Äô law student. The one who is top of their class, involved in every extracurricular, interning at top law firms and so on. But that is usually a very small number of law students nationwide. The rest of us go without checking all those boxes but maybe check 2-3. And somehow along the way in our education system, we‚Äôve convinced our students that only being above average is acceptable. Yet, average is average for a reason. Average is in fact: good. To be clear, I'm not saying we shouldn't encourage students to reach for the highest rung of the ladder. But there's a big difference between 'working hard' and 'be the best.' The former can be applied to anyone; the latter to only a few. Then we wonder why law students are so depressed and anxious when we‚Äôre telling them to fit themselves into a mold that only a minority of them will actually fit. We wonder why years later, lawyers end up unhappy and burned out - because they were chasing the ideals that other people told them to. And those people were likely told by people before them. But I guess this is what we get for aiding and abetting an antiquated and formulaic system. My hope? That when law students come to us we start with: ‚Äúhow are you? Mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually?‚Äù And then follow that up with: ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your why? what do you value most in your life?‚Äù Only from there, after gaining this critical insight to each student‚Äôs personality and background, should we be giving advice. And I would venture to say this should be applied to all types of students, not just those in law school. But that‚Äôs just me. #lawstudents #lawyers #school #graduatestudents #undergraduatestudents\n\nUnderstanding Crazy According to the fictional Professor Kingsfield in the movie ‚ÄúThe Paper Chase,‚Äù law students ‚Äúcome in ‚Ä¶ (to law school) ‚Ä¶ with a skull full of mush and ‚Ä¶ leave thinking like a lawyer.‚Äù I have often wondered whether I would have been better off keeping my mushy mind so that I could think like a normal person, but that is a question for another day. Although law schools teach students to understand and apply legal principles, there is plenty of stuff that they never mention, including the importance of having a rudimentary understanding of psychology. To give you an example, many years ago I sought assistance from a psychologist to help me deal with my domestic reorganization. After speaking to me for a few minutes he decided that it was vital that he administer some tests to see if I was crazy. Upon reviewing the results, he told me that although I had scored within the normal range in every category, when it came to paranoia there was not much daylight between me and nuts. That was a valuable insight. After that, when my head started spinning with fear that I had made a mistake and was going to get sued, I would remind myself that was just my paranoia speaking and calm down. Students arrive at law school from diverse backgrounds. These differences extend to psychological make-up, cultural background, and socio-economic status. Some arrive fresh from studying day and night for many years, having sacrificed other forms of personal development. Others enter the profession having had prior careers. Some have had extensive business backgrounds and others have had none. Everyone is different, but we all need to understand ourselves, and others. Practicing law is a high-stakes game in which lawyers win in negotiations, mediations, arbitrations, and litigation by skilfully interacting with their own clients, each other, mediators, arbitrators, and judges. One lawyer may know the law better than the other lawyer, or have better technical skills, and those factors may impact the results obtained for the client. However, it is frequently the lawyer‚Äôs ability to communicate effectively that makes the difference, and that depends on their ability to understand other people. In my case, I learned that my tendency toward paranoia was a good thing to the extent that it made me careful about the risks in any situation, but a bad thing in that it made me nervous and too quick to react. Someone knowing that about me could use it to their advantage. On the flip side of the coin, I eventually learned how important it is to know as much as possible about what makes the other side and their lawyer tick. Figuring out where they were coming from helped me do a better job for my client. Neither law school nor the Law Society is going to teach you this stuff. Think about investing your own time and money to learn it. This article was originally published by Law360 Canada, part of LexisNexis Canada Inc. #lawyers #lawstudents #psychology\n\nStudents of the Nigerian Law School, I think you should read this. As you prepare to begin your Court and Law Firm Externship next week, these are 5 things I expect you to keep in mind and practice. 1. Have a study timetable: This is very important. I do not think you can successfully study during externship without a study timetable. Take your time to carefully curate a working timetable. Do not stuff so many activities in one day. I read two topics in a day. Some of my friends did one topic per day. Reading 4,5,6 topics may not be very effective. This is because you are not reading a novel. You are studying and this requires concentration and effort. 2. This may sound different from what you have heard before but during your court externship especially, pay attention during trials, judgement deliveries, arraignment, when motions are moved etc. Apart from the fact that you would jump right into practice after you are called, these are useful for your Civil and Criminal Litigation Exams! As I wrote my exams, scenarios from my court externship played in my head. 3. Do not see your court and law office externship as a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. It is not a break. You are still in Law School. It is useful to have that at the back of your mind. 4. The first few weeks of the externship would make you feel like you cannot do this. You would be tired from locating your court, waking up early only to return late etc. You may not even be able to study for the first few days, but trust me, it is temporary. You will adjust soon, I promise you. This externship trains your mind and body. Discipline is part of the package üòÉ. You will get used to it. 5. Effort matters. Try to follow your study table strictly but in case you get too tired to do so, do not pack up everything all together. Do not quit easily. Ensure that you show up everyday for your studies. If you cannot study, just read through. If you cannot read, practice your drafts. If you are too weak to practice drafts, recite the RPC. Just DO something everyday even if you are tired. Bonus Point- call your friends from Law school every now and then. Ask them random questions, let them ask you random questions too. I used to do this over Google Meet app and 5 of us in my study group made First Class. Discussing with them challenges you to do better. Effort is contagious. You can do this. I am rooting and praying for you. Cheers!\n\nCALIFORNIA BAR EXAM: PART I At this time of year, when the California bar results come in, I often reflect upon my own experiences, back in 2005. This is less about the exam itself, and more about what it isn't, and what's missing from the overall equation. Law schools are designed more to get you to pass the bar than to actually practice law. It is in the best interests of law schools to get you through that step, as it deeply affects the schools' reputation, enrollment, and bottom line. So in one regard, law schools fail their students insofar as providing an academic approach to test prep, rather than preparation to perform the basic functions lawyers must on a day-to-day basis. We are taught in law school not to be conclusory, but to be analytical. Don't get me wrong; that absolutely has value. We MUST be analytical, methodical, diligent, comprehensive. But clients don't want 10 hours of legal research and 5 hours of writing a law review article to get to the \"yes\" or \"no\" answer they asked us for! Sometimes, yes, we can't get there without the deep dive; but sometimes, we know perfectly well what 'the' answer is. Law schools often have 'practicum' classes; I would argue these should be more common and more diversified, with a focus to providing EACH student a practicum course each year (if not each semester). The bar exam doesn't test your lawyering as much as it tests your memorization, ability to 'issue spot,' and ability to synthesize. But your clients aren't a burned out reader on the BART. They are not interested in the fine points (okay, some have been, but pretty unusual!), they want solutions. That doesn't mean skipping steps, but they generally don't want you to show your work. In that regard, I feel like most law schools are missing the right kind of practicums; how to communicate and engage with clients, and how to manage your (and your associates') time. Mock trials and mock negotiations are all well and good, but they miss the true social skills required of a really good lawyer; making the client feel respected, informed and comfortable. That in you, they have made the right choice, and by doing so are getting the best results. And that you're not gouging them, so they don't have to come to you for a write-down because your associate billed 10 hours for a job you could have done in 1. Yes, I know how firms make money, but it doesn't mean it's a good thing, especially where first years are billed at $650/hour. Not sure what these courses would look like, but it would certainly be doing students, firms and most particularly clients a big favor. Law firms could also do a lot more to 'apprentice' their associates into these skills. More on bar exam experiences to come...and more pointedly so. Hope y'all passed!\n\nThis weekend Paige Mueller, Edmond Lo, Jonathan Li, Daniel Sze and Daniel Lee, JD had dim sum lunch with a group of law students from Peter A. Allard School of Law at UBC who are first generation law students. We shared practical tips on the study of law and what to expect in each stage of our legal careers, including topics on mental health and the legal profession. Our five tips are as follows: 1. Start preparing for the On-Campus Interviews (‚ÄúOCI‚Äù) early in the summer and attend firm tours to learn about each law firm. The law school‚Äôs career centre can help review your draft application forms. Federation of Asian Canadian Lawyers BC will also offer mock interviews this year to prepare law students for the OCIs. 2. Ask yourself why you want to become a lawyer. This question is important because this will determine where you want to article to improve your chances in practicing in your preferred area of law. Further, you will need to answer this question during the OIC. As such, you should practice answering this question and learn how to tell effective stories. If you tell a good story, then the interviewer will ask follow up questions. Good storytelling takes more than having a script. Instead, you need to speak slowly, clearly, and sometimes pause. Pauses help an audience digest important points. Passion for the story should be communicated through rhythm and changes in intonation. 3. Each large firm in Vancouver recruits a small number of summer students each year. As such, not everyone will be offered a position to summer and/or article at a large law firm. This does not mean you cannot later join a large law firm. If you want to join as a lateral, then you will need to develop an area of specialty, such as in litigation or corporate and commercial law, from a reputable law firm. 4. For the interviews, it is important for you to be yourself. The firm is interviewing you to determine whether you are the right fit for the firm. You are also assessing whether the firm is a right fit for yourself. 5. Your legal career will be a long journey and in each stage of your life you need to re-assess your priorities and determine what you want. You will have a stronger support network from colleagues if you are active in the legal community. For example, by being involved in Canadian Bar Association, BC Branch, Law Society of British Columbia, and/or Federation of Asian Canadian Lawyers BC. There are other organizations that you can be active in. The above is not a complete list. Thank you Yiwei Wu for organizing this event. It was fun meeting everyone and it was great to meet a group that is very passionate in joining the legal profession. #lawstudents #mentorship #firstgenerationlawyer\n\n*The 5 biggest law school personal statement mistakes - and how to avoid them* In my experience helping more than 1,000 law school applicants prepare their personal statement, I‚Äôve seen my fair share of mistakes. In fact, I tell each new student I work with NOT to worry about making errors at first, because I‚Äôm 99% certain I‚Äôve seen it before ‚Äì and we can always fix it. One of the earliest mistakes students make is overthinking their law school personal statement. When we first start working together, I find many students have too many ideas and struggle to pinpoint just one. How can you narrow down the best one? Sometimes, it helps to get an outside point of view. Even if we haven‚Äôt met before, I‚Äôve helped many students focus on the subject that matters most to them. Here‚Äôs why that matters: the topic that means the most to you will also work best to get the attention of admission officers. Take my former student Brittany, for example -- Brittany chose to identify a background, identity, interest, or talent that was so meaningful to her, that her application would seem incomplete without it. Brittany knew she wanted to write about her experience with the violin. The problem was, she had 11 years‚Äô worth of experiences to choose from on her r√©sum√©! It was difficult to focus on one meaningful instance in particular. After working together, we were able to identify one key turning point that helped her become the person she is today. The end result was a well-written and moving law school personal statement. Does this sound like you? Do you have a general idea for a topic, but still don‚Äôt know where to start? If so, send me a message and let‚Äôs bounce some ideas around. I‚Äôd love to help. Because the #1 BIGGEST mistake I see students make is trying to squeeze too many ideas into one law school personal statement. Here are some other ‚Äúdon‚Äôts‚Äù to avoid: 2. Talking about how you want to go to a school because it has a great reputation. Many students want to go to a top school, be successful in their careers, and make lots of money. I‚Äôm sorry to tell you this, but no one cares. Well, that‚Äôs not 100% true. Law school admissions officers do indeed care that their school is great, but they already know this. Set yourself apart by expressing your desire to take classes in subjects that interest you. If you‚Äôre not sure what you want to study, make it clear that you want to expose yourself to a wide range of ideas. And by all means, DON‚ÄôT do this: ‚ÄúX Law School is well-renowned, and many famous people like _____, ____, and ____ graduated from there. With a law degree from X Law School, I‚Äôll be sure to be a success in life and make my friends and family proud.‚Äù 3. Using ‚Äúcute‚Äù techniques to stand out. Don‚Äôt be gimmicky! Sometimes, you‚Äôll hear stories of super-creative approaches that worked. When they do, people take it as proof that the creative approach is a great idea. Here‚Äôs the risk: Some law school admission officers are old-school,"
