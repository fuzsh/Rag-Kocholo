        "text": "General Equivalency Diploma (GED) applicants are welcome to enroll at Iowa State University. The specific GED score requirements for admission depend upon when the GED test was taken.\n\nGED taken prior to 2014\n\nApplicants who have achieved an overall average score at the 50th percentile or higher with no score lower than the 45th percentile will be offered admission. Applicants are also required to achieve GED sub-test scores at the 75th percentile for subject areas in which they did not satisfy the Minimum High School Course Requirements for Admission.\n\nGED taken in 2014 or later\n\nApplicants who have achieved a score of 170 or higher on each of the four content areas (Reasoning Through Language Arts, Mathematical Reasoning, Science, and Social Studies) will be offered admission.\n\nThe state of Iowa uses the HiSET (in place of the GED) as the assessment for persons who wish to earn their high school equivalency diploma. The HiSET is composed of five sub-tests listed below, each of which are scored from 1-20 with a score of 8 considered \"passing\" and a score of 15 considered \"college ready\". The total HiSET score ranges from 1-100.\n\nHiSET sub-tests:\n\nLanguage Arts – Reading\n\nLanguage Arts – Writing\n\nMathematics\n\nSocial Studies\n\nScience\n\nFirst-year applicants who achieve a minimum sum score of 75 on the HiSET and a minimum score of 15 on each of the five sub-tests will automatically be offered admission. Applicants who do not meet these minimum requirements will be considered on an individual basis.\n\nEach year, Iowa State welcomes first-year applicants who have been educated at home.\n\nIn addition to submitting the first-year application for admission, home schooled students must also submit the following items:\n\nHome school transcript.\n\nHigh school transcript if any courses have been taken through the local high school.\n\nCollege transcript(s) if any college coursework has been attempted.\n\nApplicants may choose whether they wish to submit ACT or SAT scores. Those who wish to have their ACT or SAT scores considered must have their scores sent to Iowa State directly from the testing agency.\n\nGPA policy for home school students\n\nWhen calculating a home school applicant's high school GPA for admission, only those grades which have been assigned by an independent entity (e.g., the local high school, a college, or an accredited online curriculum) are factored into the cumulative GPA. Home school applicants must have earned independently assigned grades in at least 12 semester credits of college-level coursework or at least 5 Carnegie units of high school-level coursework (or a combination of both) before their independently assigned grades can be used to establish their high school GPA.\n\nHome school applicants who have not earned enough independently assigned grades to have an established high school GPA will be considered for admission on an individual basis. This will include a holistic evaluation of the student’s entire academic record, including ACT/SAT test scores, high school core classes, and coursework taken through high school and local colleges and universities."
