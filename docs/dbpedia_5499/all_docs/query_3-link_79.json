        "text": "Lia Haskins, ’22, will graduate from Emory & Henry College with a Bachelor’s degree in French, Political Science and History on May 7. She will also be graduating with the National Collegiate Honors Council diploma for her successful honors thesis defense and she has earned the Global Seal of Biliteracy certification of functional fluency in French.\n\nHaskins, a Danville, Va. native, will continue her education at Regent University School of Law following graduation this spring. She is a member of Phi Eta Sigma, Phi Delta Pi, and Phi Sigma Alpha honors societies, the Honors Program, the Calliopean Literary Society and the Housing and Residence Life Staff as a Community Advisor. “E&H has shaped me into the person that I am today,” Haskins said. “The opportunities that I have had working in Housing and Residence Life, being a work-study, going abroad to France and working on an honors thesis have prepared me to do anything. Working with professors who really care about your success has also been a huge factor in having these opportunities and my success in them.”"
