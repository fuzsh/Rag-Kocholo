This RAI calculator works with SAT scores taken after February 2016. If you took the SAT prior to February 2016, please convert your score to the new SAT scoring system before calculating your RAI using this tool. This calculator will convert your SAT score to an ACT equivalent according to the following table (updated 7/11/2018):\n\nSAT Score\n\n( Total )\n\nACT Equivalent\n\n( Composite )\n\n1570 - 1600\n\n36\n\n1530 - 1560\n\n35\n\n1490 - 1520\n\n34\n\n1450 - 1480\n\n33\n\n1420 - 1440\n\n32\n\n1390 - 1410\n\n31\n\n1360 - 1380\n\n30\n\n1330 - 1350\n\n29\n\n1300 - 1320\n\n28\n\n1260 - 1290\n\n27\n\n1230 - 1250\n\n26\n\n1200 - 1220\n\n25\n\n1160 - 1190\n\n24\n\n1130 - 1150\n\n23\n\n1100 - 1120\n\n22\n\n1060 - 1090\n\n21\n\n1030 - 1050\n\n20\n\n990 - 1020\n\n19\n\n960 - 980\n\n18\n\n920 - 950\n\n17\n\n880 - 910\n\n16\n\n830 - 870\n\n15\n\n780 - 820\n\n14\n\n730 - 770\n\n13\n\n690 - 720\n\n12\n\n650 - 680\n\n11\n\n620 - 640 10 590 - 610 9\n\nBack to Calculator Back to Top\n\nGrade-point average: Enter your high school grade-point average and scale.\n\nIf your school provides more than one GPA (e.g.weighted GPA and non-weighted GPA), use the best GPA.\n\nNumber of completed core courses: Enter the number of full-year courses that you've taken or plan to take in English, mathematics, natural science, social science, and world languages. (A one-semester course counts as 0.5.) While additional courses in areas such as the fine arts and technology will help round out your high school experience and prepare you for future careers, they are not part of the core courses used to calculate your admission index.\n\nWorking with your high school guidance counselor, consult the following document to determine what courses count in the Regent Admission Index calculation:\n\nAcceptable courses for Regent Admission Index (PDF)\n\nBack to Calculator Back to Top\n\nWhat Does This Index Mean?\n\nThe Regent Admission Index combines factors that strongly predict success at regent universities: ACT or SAT test score, high school cumulative grade-point average, and the number of completed high school core courses.\n\nIowa high school graduates must achieve a Regent Admission Index (RAI) score of at least 245 and take the minimum number of required high school courses to qualify for automatic admission as freshmen to Iowa State University, the University of Northern Iowa, and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Iowa. Students who achieve a score less than 245 will be considered for admission on an individual basis.\n\nBack to Calculator Back to Top\n\nIf You Are Not an Iowa High School Student\n\nIf you are interested in applying to an Iowa Regent University, but you are not an Iowa high school student (e.g., you are a nonresident, transfer, or returning student), visit any of the university web sites below to learn about admission requirements.\n\nUniversity of Iowa (opens new window)\n\nIowa State University (opens new window)\n\nUniversity of Northern Iowa (opens new window)\n\nBack to Calculator Back to Top\n\nIf Your Index Score is Below 245\n\nStudents who don't achieve a Regent Admission Index score of 245, but who otherwise demonstrate potential and commitment to succeed at a Regent University, may be offered admission after an individual review of their application.\n\nBack to Calculator Back to Top\n\nHigh School Course Requirements\n\nIn addition to meeting the Regent Admission Index requirement, students must complete the minimum number of high school courses specified below for the institution to which they're applying.\n\nSubject Area Iowa State University University of Iowa University of Northern Iowa English/Language Arts 4 years emphasizing writing, speaking, and reading, as well as an understanding and appreciation of literature. 4 years, with an emphasis on the analysis and interpretation of literature, composition and speech. 4 years, including one year of composition; may also include one year of speech, communication, or journalism.
