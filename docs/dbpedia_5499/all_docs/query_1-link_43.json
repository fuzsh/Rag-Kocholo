Other sources of grant aid are excluded. Aid awarded anytime during the full aid year is included.\n\nAverage net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance. Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.\n\n$15,267\n\nCalculate your net cost\n\nAverage Net Price By Family Income\n\nIncome\n\nAverage Amount\n\n< $30k\n\n$18,242\n\n$30k - $48k\n\n$16,139\n\n$48k - $75k\n\n$17,248\n\n$75k - $110k\n\n$19,100\n\n$110k+\n\n$18,471\n\nTuition\n\nIn-State Tuition In-state tuition is the tuition charged by institutions to those students who meet the state's or institution's residency requirements.

However, as stated before, it all depends on how much effort you are willing to put into your education. It also can depend a great deal on your professor. I've found in my experience, though, that the professors here at Regent will either teach the bare minimum or go above and beyond. I've had several professors already who have invested in me and my passions in a way that I will always remember. These professors are, fortunately, the rule rather than the exception at Regent.\n\nLauren from Senoia, GA\n\nIt won't break the pocketbook like some of the other schools out there - I mean, it's not cheap like the state schools, but it's most definitely good for a private school! I don't mind sharing personal information, so my tuition and housing costs for this coming semester (Fall 2011) came up to approximately $10,000, including all the small fees associated with colleges. Regent does have scholarships to help you in this department - you can find them by clicking on the Financial Aid link located on the drop-down menu on their site. You can also always consult a Financial Aid Adviser if you feel like you need further help.\n\nEmily from Mechanicsville, VA\n\nRegent University is less expensive than many Christian college's. Make sure to fill out FAFSA and take advantage of scholarship opportunities.\n\nAustin\n\nIt is more expensive than a state college as it is a private institution. Since I am also in a separate state and I work to pay for college I am well aware of the great difference in expense. Thankfully, they can reduce some of the tuition based on academic merit. The quality of the education, in my opinion, is well worth it!\n\nKristen A. from Florida\n\nRegent is a private university so it is a bit more expensive than other schools. Fortunately financial aid and scholarships are readily available. The financial aid counselors are more than willing to help you find ways to afford Regent.\n\nLeila from Virginia Beach, VA\n\nIn my opinion, Regent is expensive but this is expected of college/university in general and private schools specifically. I've saved some money by being a commuter and I'm thankful for the financial aid. My AP Gov teacher said that college was a time to learn and grow in a setting of diverse people coming together to share ideas and at this university, despite a large number of similarities (like large numbers of Pentecostal/charismatic and politically conservative), there is a healthy diversity and an environment that inspires growth and learning.With my experience at the school so far, the environment Regent fosters for that university ideal has made the money has been worth it.\n\nDavid from Virginia Beach, VA\n\nAlthough Regent is a private university, the education and experience is worth the cost of attending. The faculty and students come from a variety of backgrounds and global locations which adds depth, interaction, and understanding of other cultures.\n\nCatherine from Virginia Beach, VA\n\nCompared with many Virginia schools, it is rather affordable (as far college goes).\n\nBrenden from Vienna, VA\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nNewport News, VA\n\nFairfax, VA\n\nHampton, VA\n\nHarrisonburg, VA\n\nLynchburg, VA\n\nNorfolk, VA\n\nNorfolk, VA\n\nRadford, VA\n\nRichmond, VA\n\nCharlottesville, VA\n\nVirginia Beach, VA\n\nNew York, NY\n\nSee All"
