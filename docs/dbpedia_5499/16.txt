Regent University, located in Virginia Beach, Virginia, is a private Christian university. In terms of student population, Regent has an enrollment of around 4,500 undergraduate students. Regent's size offers a relatively small and tight-knit community, which can be appealing to students who prefer closer connections with peers and faculty.

Diversity at Regent is steadily improving. According to the most recent data available, the racial/ethnic breakdown of undergraduate students is as follows: 48% White, 25% Black or African American, 11% Hispanic or Latino, 2% Asian, and the remaining percentage is comprised of students from other races or with multiple racial backgrounds. International students also contribute to the cultural diversity at Regent.

While these statistics provide a quick overview of Regent's demographics, it's important to remember that the campus atmosphere and overall sense of community are also significant factors. To get a feel for the environment on campus, I recommend visiting the university, reaching out to current students or alumni, and exploring online forums and social media pages dedicated to the Regent University community. This way, you can gain a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the school's culture and determine if it's a good fit for you.
