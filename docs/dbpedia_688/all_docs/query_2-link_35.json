A total of 74 potential isolates with probiotic properties were isolated from Oecophylla smaragdina, an edible insect used by local tribes as a nutritious medicinal food source out of which, the most potential probiotic candidate was identified as Bacillus sp. PD6 by 16S rRNA sequencing. Cell surface trait analysis shows hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation percentage of 46.2 ± 0.32% and 61.41 ± 0.28% respectively. The cell free extract (CFE) of the isolate shows the presence of essential amino acids viz, lysine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, and threonine indicating its nutritional value. It survives significantly at pH range from 1 to 10 and capable of hydrolyzing bile salt. The CFE shows antagonistic effect against B. cereus ATCC 11778, E. coli ATCC 25922 and L. monocytogenes ATCC BAA751. FTIR spectra of bacterial exo-polysaccharide shows the presence of νC=C–H stretch, νN–H stretch, νC–H stretch, νC–H bending and νC=O stretch bonds. It was found to be non-cytotoxic against primary mouse liver cell line and sheep erythrocytes and also, sensitive against wide range of broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics making it recommendable for human consumption.\n\nKeywords: Edible insect, Oecophylla smaragdina, Probiotic, Cytotoxicity assay, Antagonistic effect, Bacillus sp. PD6\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll over the world, especially among ethnic tribes, edible insects are used as a cheap source of protein and wellness food [1]. North Eastern India, the ethereal universe of extraordinary floral and faunal endemism, is a part of Eastern Himalayan Biodiversity hotspot, one of the three biodiversity hotspots in India. In the state of Assam, a part of North Eastern India lays the cradle of numerous economically important flora and fauna, particularly micro flora and fauna, most of which are yet to be explored [2]. The indigenous populations of Assam have long since been consuming various arthropods as a source of nutrition. Of these, Oecophylla smaragdina (local name-Amroli porua) is considered a local delicacy and consumed either raw or in cooked form and is a good source of edible protein, essential amino acids, antioxidants and minerals [3, 4]. Insects could provide these essential fatty acids to areas with lower access to food sources like fish, as a part of local diet [5]. Many people around the world consume insects as a part of their local food culture, mainly because of the palatability of the insects. Insects are a healthy food source of fatty acids, proteins, vitamins and mineral content. Essential fatty acids are important in development of children and infants [1]. However, the benefits of consuming insects as a food source are largely unknown to general public, as there is almost minimal scientific exploration that determines the utility of the traditional consumption of insects [3, 4, 6].\n\nProbiotic definition, according to World Health Organization (WHO) is “live micro-organisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” [5]. The European parliament and the council of the European Union have encouraged the development of alternative products to replace antibiotics as feed supplements for growth promotions [5, 7]. An effective and safe alternative to antibiotic implementation is the use of probiotics, which protects the individual from pathogens by enhancing the microbial balance in the gastro intestinal tract to exclude potentially harmful bacteria [8].\n\nHowever, the characterization of probiotic microorganism from O. smaragdina has not been reported before. Taking into consideration that characterization of probiotic microbes from edible insects has not been adequately studied and also that North East India is a treasure trove of such traditional knowledge, the current study was undertaken for the very first time.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nChemicals and Reagents\n\nChemicals and consumables were procured from Merck India Pvt. Ltd. and all microbiological media used in this study were purchased from Hi Media India Pvt. Ltd.\n\nCollection of Samples\n\nOecophylla smaragdina samples were collected during summer from 20 different areas of Assam and samples were kept in − 20 °C for future use. The taxonomic identification of the collected insect samples was done in consultation with the Entomologists of the Department of Life Sciences, Dibrugarh University. Detailed geographical distributions of the sample collection sites are shown in Table .\n\nTable 1\n\nSample IDCollection siteGeographical position of sample collection siteLongitudeLatitude1Tinsukia95°22′E27°30′N2Dibrugarh94°54′E27°29′N3Sivasagar94°13′E26°59′N4Jorhat94°13′E26°45′N5Golaghat93°58′E26°31′N6Nagaon92°41′E26°21′N7Morigaon92°21′E26°15′N8Guwahati91°44′E26°8′N9Nalbari91°32′E26°36′N10Barpeta91°00′E26°32′N11Silapathar94°76′E26°60′N12Dhakuakhana94°45′E27°31′N13Tezpur92°79′E25°65′N14Rowta92°22′E26°71′N15Karbi Anglong91°26′E26°25′N16Jorabat91°86′E26°89′N17Dispur91°78′E26°14′N18Bezera91°77′E26°34′N19Baihata charali91°71′E26°34′N20Sipajhar91°89′E26°40′N\n\nIsolation and Screening of Probiotic Bacteria\n\nAugmentation of samples were done by grounding 5 g of each sample into paste followed by inoculation in 100 ml of MRS (Man Rogosa Sharpe) broth maintained at pH-3 followed by incubation at 37 °C and 135 rpm for 48 h. Two fold dilutions of the augmented samples were placed on MRS agar followed by incubation. Only the Gram positive and catalase negative isolates were allowed to be screened on Bile salt agar [9, 10].\n\nSafety Assessment in Terms of Antibiotic Sensitivity Assay\n\nAntibiotic sensitivity of the bacterial isolates was tested against commercially available antibiotic discs with defined concentration as per CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, USA) standards [11]. Isolates with sensitivity against maximum number of antibiotics were screened for further studies.\n\nEvaluation of Antagonistic Effect of the Most Potential Isolates\n\nThe antimicrobial assay of the most potential isolates were carried out by agar well diffusion method by loading the cell free extract of the isolates against six pathogens viz., B. cereus (ATCC 11778), B. subtilis (ATCC 6051), E. coli (ATTC 25922), L. monocytogenes (ATCCBAA-751), S. aureus (MTCC 9542), and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Serovar Typhimurium (ATCC 49416). The most potential isolates were screened on the basis of the diameter of zone of inhibitions obtained after incubation.\n\nIn-Vitro Determination of Cell Surface Traits of the Isolate\n\nHydrophobicity Assay\n\nHydrophobicity of the bacterial isolate was assessed by the test microbial adhesion to hydrocarbon (MATH) as described by Del Re et al., 2000 [12]. Overnight bacterial broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellet was re-suspended in 3 ml of 0.1 M KNO3 solution and the absorbance (A0) was measured at 600 nm.1 ml of toluene was added to the cell pellet in order to form a two phase system and incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by vortex for 2 min and again incubated for 30 min at room temperature until the water and toluene gets separated. Absorbance (A1) of the aqueous phase was taken at 600 nm. Cell surface hydrophobicity was determined by the following formula [12]:\n\nH=1-A1/A0×100\n\nwhere A0 = OD of the aqueous phase at 600 nm before incubation, A1 = OD of the aqueous phase at 600 nm after incubation.\n\nAuto-Aggregation Assay\n\nAuto-aggregation capabilities of the most potent isolates were carried out by the method of Del Re et al. [12]. The bacterial culture was harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C the pellet was washed twice with PBS and again re-suspended in PBS and adjusted the bacterial population to 108 cfu/ml. 3 ml of the bacterial suspension was vortex for 10 s and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Absorbance of the supernatant before incubation (A0h) and after 2 h of incubation (A2h) at room temperature was measured at 600 nm and calculated the auto–aggregation using following formula using following formula:\n\nAuto-aggregation%=1-A2h/A0h×100\n\nLysozyme Susceptibility Test\n\nTolerance to lysozyme was assessed by spread plating the isolate on nutrient agar plates supplemented with lysozyme (400 µg/ml of molten nutrient agar just before casting), taking lysozyme free plates as control [13]. Luxuriant growth of the isolate just after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C indicates lysozyme tolerance of the isolate.\n\nSafety Assessment in Terms of Haemolysis Assay\n\nHemolytic activity of the most potential isolate was performed using 5% (w/v) of defibrinated sheep blood (E & O Laboratories Ltd., New Delhi) in Blood Agar Base No 2 taking Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 9542) as control [14].\n\nCytotoxicity Assay\n\nOn Primary Liver Cell Line of Mouse (Mus musculus)\n\nCytotoxicity assay of the cell free extract of the potential isolate was done by MTT method against primary culture of liver cells (hepatocytes) of Mus musculus (albino mouse) maintained and locally bred in the institutional animal house facility. Only one such animal was sacrificed with essential ethical clearance for the experiment. Hepatic cells population was adjusted to 2x106 cells/mL in Dulbecco’s Modified Essential Media (DMEM) using a haemocytometer. 100μL of hepatic cells containing media were loaded into wells of a microtitre plate followed by addition of 100 μL cell free extract (CFE) of different dilutions (crude CFE, 1:1, 1:2,…1:7 in PBS) in each well except in the control well. Viability of the cells was observed after overnight incubation (36.5 °C, with 95% humidified air: 5% CO2 incubator) in terms of absorbance measured at 600 nm using PBS as blank.Viability of the cells was also determined by transferring 50 µL of hepatic cell suspension mixed in equal volume of trypan blue stain to a haemocytometer. The number of cells per mL and viable cell percentage was calculated using the following formula [15]:\n\nTotalcells/mL=Total cells counted×Dilution FactorNo. of squares in haemocytometer×10000cells\n\n%viabilityofcells=LiveCellCountTotalCellCount×100\n\nOn Sheep Erythrocytes\n\nThe cytotoxicity assay at different concentration of CEF was further examined by detecting the haemolysis of sheep blood collected from the jugular vein [15]. Briefly, 3 mL of freshly obtained sheep blood was placed in heparinized tubes to avoid coagulation, gently mixed and poured into a sterile 15 mL Falcon tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The supernatant was poured off and RBCs were washed three times with 5 mL chilled sterile PBS solution adjusted to pH 7.4. The washed RBCs were suspended in 20 mL chilled PBS. The RBC count was maintained to 7 × 108 cells/mL PBS for each assay. Different dilutions (1:1, 1:2…1:6) of cell free extract in PBS (total volume 20 μL) were taken in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and then 180 μL of blood cell suspension was added. The samples were incubated for 35 min at 37 °C. After incubation and agitation for 10 min, the tubes were placed on ice for 5 min and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. After centrifugation, 100 μL of supernatant was taken and diluted with 900 μL chilled PBS. 200 μL from each tube was transferred to 96 well plates. For each assay, 0.1% Triton X-100 was taken as a positive control and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as a negative control. The absorbance of each tube was recorded at 600 nm.\n\nBiochemical Characterization and Molecular Identification of the Isolate\n\nGelatin hydrolysis, Indole, methyl red, Voges Prokauer test, citrate utilization, nitrate utilization, oxidase, starch hydrolysis, Urease, and sugar fermentation (Arbinose, Fructose, Galactose, Glucose, Lactose, Maltose, Mannitol, Sucrose, Xylose) test were performed by standard method [16]. Grams staining and endospore staining were also performed for phenotypic identification of the isolate.\n\nThe most potential probiotic isolate was finally identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing by outsourcing the isolate to Pentavalent Bio Sciences Ltd., Bangalore and the consensus sequence hence generated was aligned by using multiple alignment software program ClustalW™ [17]. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6 software by Neighbour-Joining method with 1000 bootstrap value forcing E. coli NBR 3972 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"AB680194.1\",\"term_id\":\"359802835\",\"term_text\":\"AB680194.1\"}}AB680194.1) as out group.\n\nExtraction and Characterization of Bacterial Exo-Polysaccharide (EPS)\n\nBacterial EPS was extracted by cold acetone precipitation method followed by the evaporation of the solvent by freeze drying [18]. The bacterial EPS characterized by FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) along with a standard dextran sulfate (DS) using Perkin-Elmer FTIR instrument by mixing the EPS with 99 parts of dried potassium bromide (KBr) and IR spectra was measured in the frequency range of 400 and 4000 cm−1 (Nanda et al., 2014).Estimation of carbohydrate in the EPS was estimated by Anthrone method [19].\n\nEstimation of Protein and Essential Amino Acids in the Bacterial Cell Free Extract\n\nProtein present in the cell free extract of the sample was estimated by Lowry’s method [18]. Bacterial isolate was allowed to grown in Minimal broth (composition (g/l): Dextrose-1.0, K2HPO4-7, KH2PO4-2.0, Na3C6H5O7-0.5, MgSO4-0.1, (NH4)2SO4-1.0, pH-7.0 ± 0.2). Presence of essential amino acids in the CFE was estimated by paper chromatography [19].\n\nGrowth Profiling at Different pH\n\nThe most potential probiotic strain was inoculated at Luria–Bertani broth, maintained in a pH range of 1–10 in different test tubes. The growth was monitored at 1 h intervals at 600 nm against suitable blank and the viability of the cells was confirmed by streaking on MRS agar plates followed by incubation.\n\nOverall flowchart of the study is shown in Fig. .\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nAll experiments were performed in triplicates and the results were expressed in terms of mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA was applied to the results. Differences in means were considered to be significant for p values < 0.05. A Student’s t test was used for statistical comparisons of two means and was done by Graph pad™ online tool (http://www.graphpad.com).\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nIsolation and Screening of Potential Probiotic Microorganisms\n\nA total of 74 different types of bacterial colonies on the basis of their colony morphology were obtained after initial screening of all the isolates on MRS agar, maintained at pH 3, whereas fungal colonies and yeast-like colonies were not obtained. Out of these, 11 colonies were found to be Gram positive and catalase negative in nature and only six of these isolates could hydrolyze the bile salt agar. Antibiotic susceptibility test result shows that the isolate F6 has susceptibility against maximum number of antibiotics viz., Ampicillin, Amikacin, Ceftriaxone, Ceftazidime, Ciproflaxacin, Chloramphenicol, Erythromycin, Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Penicillin, Streptomycin and Vanacomycin as shown in Table . The isolates fulfilling all the basic criteria to be considered as a potential probiotic candidate is represented by a Venn diagram within the overall flowchart of the study (Fig. ).\n\nTable 2\n\nSl. no.AntibioticAbbreviationConcentrationResistant (R)/sensitive (S)Zone of inhibition (mm)1AmpicillinAMP1010 mcg/discsS8 ± 22AmikacinAK3030 mcg/discS17 ± 33CeftriaxoneCTR3030 mcg/discsR–4CeftazidimeCAZ3030 mcg/discsR–5CiprofloxacinCF3030 mcg/discsS25 ± 36ChloramphenicolC3030 mcg/discsS24 ± 27ClindamycinCD22 mcg/discR–8ErythromycinE1515 mcg/discS10 ± 29GentamicinGEN1010 mcg/discS9 ± 210KanamycinK3030 mcg/discS15 ± 311PenicillinP22 unit/discS15 ± 212StreptomycineHLS300300 mcg/discS18 ± 313VanacomycinVA3030 mcg/discS17 ± 3\n\nFurther, the cell free extract of the isolate F6 shows antimicrobial activity against B. cereus, E. coli and L. monocytogenes. The zone of inhibitions created by the CFE of the isolate is shown in Table .\n\nTable 3\n\nSl.

In-vitro cell surface trait analysis of the isolate shows 46.2 ± 0.32% hydrophobicity and 61.41 ± 0.28% auto-aggregation property. Moreover, it shows resistance against lysozymal degradation.\n\nSafety Assessment\n\nAs a part of safety assessment, the isolate shows no hemolysis on blood agar as well as no cytotoxicity by the cell free extract (CFE) of the isolate on sheep erythrocytes (Fig. ). Also, the crude CFE of isolate F6 shows no cytotoxicity on primary mouse liver cell lines (Fig. ).\n\nIdentification of the Most Potential Isolate\n\nThe isolate F6 was initially identified on the basis of staining and biochemical tests which show it as Gram positive rod shaped bacteria, capable of forming endospores. It gives positive results for MR-VP, citrate utilization, starch hydrolysis, urease production and gelatin hydrolysis test whereas negative for catalase and Indole test (Table ). It also ferments glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, lactose, and sucrose (Table ). 16S rRNA sequencing of the most potential isolate F6 confirms it as a novel strain of Bacillus sp. PD6 with 88% sequence similarity with 10 most closely related Bacillus sp. (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MF362957\",\"term_id\":\"1379031642\",\"term_text\":\"MF362957\"}}MF362957) (Fig. ).\n\nTable 4\n\nSl.

PD6 from an edible insect Oecophylla smaragdina of North East, India, was carried out for the very first time [20]. Microorganisms to be applied as probiotic must overcome the uncongenial conditions of human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and subsequently colonize the intestinal tract. Therefore, the pH of gastric juice is the main factor that determines the survival of bacteria that pass from the stomach to the intestine. In this study, the potential bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. PD6 (GenBank accession no. {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"MF362957\",\"term_id\":\"1379031642\",\"term_text\":\"MF362957\"}}MF362957) shows significant growth in a pH range of 1–10 indicating its potentiality to survive in GI tract of host [21]. Bile plays a fundamental role in specific and non-specific defense mechanisms in gut [21, 22]. The isolates F6 which was later identified as Bacillus sp. PD6 was capable of hydrolyzing bile esculine agar (4% bile) whereas in human body the relevant physiological concentrations of human bile ranges from 0.3 to 0.5% only [23].\n\nA key property of probiotic strain is that they should not carry any transmissible antibiotic-resistant genes [23]. Results from this study shows that potential probiotic candidate is susceptible to eight antibiotics to the entire broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics tested (Table ). On the other hand the novel isolate Bacillus sp. PD6 exhibits antagonistic activity against both gram positive (B. cereus ATCC 11778 and L. monocytogenes ATCC BAA751) and negative pathogen (E. coli ATCC 25922).\n\nIt is universally recognized that probiotics must be able to colonize the digestive tract to adhere and colonize the intestine apart from being resistant to GI condition which is considered as a crucial factor for the selection of new probiotics [24–26]. The studied bacterial isolate shows concurrent or even higher percentages of hydrophobicity (46.2 ± 0.32%) and auto-aggregation (61.41 ± 0.28%) compared to other reported probiotic isolates (Table ) [10, 27, 28]. The comparison table shows S. succinus with highest value of hydrophobicity (69.11%) but shows poor antimicrobial potential as compared to the current isolate Bacillus sp. PD6. The hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties are a result from proteins and exo-polysaccharides on the bacterial cell surface and the CFE of the isolate shows the presence of 1.9 ± 0.22 mg/mL of protein along with five essential amino acids advocate its nutraceutical importance also [25]. Presence of sugar moiety in the bacterial EPS was evaluated by Anthrone method and FTIR spectra also confirms the presence of νC=C–H stretch, νN–H stretch, νC–H stretch, νC–H bending and νC=O stretch functional groups which correlates with the findings of other researchers [18]. It may also be noted that EPS is one of the key factors that helps in cell adhesion with host intestinal lining and FTIR analysis attributes important data for chemical characterization of EPS produced by the bacterial cells [29].\n\nTable 5\n\nSl No.Name of the bacteriaIsolation sourceIn-vitro cell surface propertyAntimicrobial assayLists of essential amino acids released by the isolate(s)ReferencesHydrophobicity (%)Autoaggregation (%)Test microbesZone of inhibition (mm)1 B. subtilis Gut of fish (Labeo rohita)–– A. hydrophila\n\nA. sulmoniaidia\n\nV. harveyi\n\nV. alginolyticus >5 mm\n\n>2 mm\n\n>2 mm\n\n––[33]2 S. succinus Faeces of various human group69.11– E. coli\n\nSalmonella sp.\n\nEnterococcus sp.\n\nKlebsiella sp.\n\nS. aureus –\n\n4 ± 0.7\n\n–\n\n–\n\n5 ± 0.6–[34]3 E. fecium 30.12– E. coli\n\nSalmonella sp.\n\nEnterococcus sp.\n\nKlebsiella sp.\n\nS. aureus 5 ± 0.6\n\n10 ± 1.2\n\n12 ± 0.9\n\n–\n\n4 ± 0.2–[34]4 L. plantarum Fermented foods & beverages35.7415.45/3 h S. aureus,\n\nB. cereus,\n\nS. dysenteriae >5 mm\n\n>5 mm\n\n>5 mm–[10]5 L. mesenteroides\n\nL. plantarum Kimchi,traditional fermented food–\n\n––\n\n––\n\n––\n\n––\n\n–[35]6Bacillus sp. strain MKSK-E1Korean\n\ntraditional soy sauce25.7 ± 10.089.6 ± 2.0 S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, S. sonnei, S. flexneri, Pseudo. fluorescens, and K. pneumoniae ––[35]7 L. plantarum\n\nL. plantarum\n\nFructobacillus fructosus Opuntia ficus-indica fruits10.2 ± 0.5\n\n3.5 ± 0.3\n\n64.3 ± 3.71.5 ± 0.1\n\n9.9 ± 0.3\n\n25.1 ± 2.1Bacillus sp.4.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0–\n\n–\n\n–[36]8Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii ATCC 6633Purchased from\n\nthe Iranian Organizations for Science and Technology\n\n(Tehran, Iran)–– C. perfringens ––[37]9 Bacillus subtilis Cheonggukjang (Sobean fermented food)–49.18 ± 0.99–––[38]10Bacillus velezensis strain JWFish––A. hydrophila, Aeromonas salmonicida, Lactococcus garvieae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus––[39]11Bacillus sp.

On the other hand, non cytotoxicity is one of the most important criteria to be considered as a potential probiotic candidate [31, 32]. The potential isolate Bacillus sp. PD6 shows no haemolysis on blood agar and further different dilutions of the CFE of the isolate shows significant level of survival as compared to positive control which represents 100% haemolysis and negative control with 100% survival of sheep erythrocytes. Further, the crude CFE itself shows 80.15 ± 1.02% viability in primary mouse liver cell line makes it suitable to be considered as potential probiotic candidate.\n\nIn conclusion, the probiotic characterization of edible insect Oecophylla smaragdina was carried out for the very first time. The novel isolate Bacillus sp. PD6 found to be fulfilled all the basic characteristics to be considered as a potential probiotic with the ability to produce exo-polysaccharides. Moreover, the cell free extract of the isolate was found to be non-cytotoxic against primary mouse liver cell line and sheep erythrocytes makes it safe and suitable for further commercial exploitation.\n\nCompliance with Ethical Standards\n\nConflict of interest\n\nAll authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
