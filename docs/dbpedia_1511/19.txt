Biography

Hon. Nathaniel Gorham served with American Founding Fathers during the American Revolution.

Nathaniel Gorham is a DAR Patriot Ancestor, A046242.

Nathaniel Gorham is Notable.

Signer of the Constitution,[1] Fourteenth President of the Continental Congress[2]

Nathaniel Gorham was the eldest son of Captain Nathaniel Gorham[3] and Mary (Soley) Gorham of Charlestown, Massachusetts.[4] He was born on 27 May 1738.[5]

Born into a family of modest means and reputation, Nathaniel's formal education was minimal.[6] At the age of fifteen, he was apprenticed to Nathaniel Coffin, a New London, Connecticut, merchant.[3] Here, he attained the skills and knowledge that equipped him for success in the competitive world of commerce. In 1759, he established his own mercantile firm in Charlestown, and quickly became successful financially and socially.[6]

In 1763, he married Rebecca Call and they settled in Charlestown, Massachusetts.[3] Their children were:

Nathaniel, b. 25 Oct 1763[7]

Rebecca, b. 20 Mar 1765[8]

Mary, b. 7 Dec 1767[9]

Elizabeth, b. 21 Jul 1769[10]

Ann (1771-1830), m. ___ Brooks[11]

John, b. 1772[11]

Benjamin (1775-1885)[12]

Stephen (1776-1849)[11]

Lydia (1779-1856), m. ___ Phillips[13]

Nathaniel's initial entry into politics was a modest appointment as a notary.[6] In 1774, he was chosen as a Representative from Charlestown to the General Court. As trouble with England became inevitable, he aligned with the Patriots. In 1775, Nathaniel was named as one of a committee appointed by Congress to see after the welfare of the inhabitants of Charlestown.[14] But when Boston was beseiged, Charlestown suffered the same fate; Nathaniel was stripped of his property and forced to seek asylum in Lunenburgh with his wife and small children.[3]

As the War of Independence progressed, Nathaniel remained actively involved in the establishment of a provincial government, support of the war effort, and eventual framing of the Constitution:[6]

1775 - Continued as member of Massachusetts provincial legislature

1778 - Appointed to the Board of War

1779-1780 - Served as delegate to state Constitutional Convention (that wrote the Massachusetts state constitution of 1780)

1780's - Served in both houses of the state legislature

1785 - Chosen Speaker of the House[3]

1782, 1783, 1785-1787 - Served as a member of the Confederation Congress

1786 - Chosen as President of Confederation Congress

1787 - Chairman of the Committee of the Whole

1787 - Member of the Committee of Detail (which drafted the Constitution)

1788 - Member of the Governor's Council[15]

In 1785, despite the lack of a formal education, he became a judge of the Middlesex County court of common pleas and served until his death in 1796.[6]

As a framer of the Constitution, he advocated a central government strong enough to support commercial endeavors, long terms for the president and senators, broad powers for Congress, executive appointment of judges, and a military controlled by the central government.[15]

In his last years, he and a business partner undertook a speculative investment in western New York land. Unfortunately, the venture failed, leaving him heavily in debt.[6][15]

Nathaniel Gorham passed away on 11 Jun 1796 at Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts.[16] He was buried at Phipps Street Burying Ground, Charleston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts.[17]
