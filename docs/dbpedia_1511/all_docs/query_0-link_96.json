Write 1-3 paragraphs in which you describe the key events leading up to Independence. As examples, include each of these events in chronological order. Include the reasons that each of these is important, that is, how each event contributed to Independence and why it matters. Remember to include a knock-out topic sentence and a strong summative conclusion. Consider creating an illustrated timeline, newspaper, or dramatic presentation based on these documents. You might incorporate music of the era and additional resources.\n\nYour Response\n\nDocument\n\nEngrossed Declaration of Independence\n\n7/4/1776 - 8/2/1776\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence in which the American colonies set forth a list of grievances against the British Crown and declared they were breaking from British rule to form free and independent states.\n\nThe Continental Congress had, on June 10, appointed a committee of five to draft a statement of independence for the colonies. The committee included Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman, with the actual writing delegated to Jefferson.\n\nJefferson drafted the statement between June 11 and 28, submitted drafts to Adams and Franklin who made some changes, and then presented the draft to the Continental Congress following the July 2nd adoption of the independence section of the Lee Resolution. The congressional revision process took all of July 3rd and most of July 4th. Finally, in the afternoon of July 4th, the Declaration was adopted.\n\nOn July 19, Congress resolved that the Declaration passed on the 4th be fairly \"engrossed\" on parchment with a new title, \"the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of America,\" and signed by every member of Congress. (Engrossing is the process of copying an official document in a large hand. The engrosser of the Declaration was probably Timothy Matlock, an assistant to Charles Thomson, secretary to the Congress.)\n\nAlthough it bears the date \"July 4, 1776,\" the engrossed Declaration was signed on August 2, by members of the Continental Congress who were present that day and later by other members of Congress. John Hancock, the President of the Congress, signed the engrossed copy with a bold signature. The other delegates, following custom, signed beginning at the right with the signatures arranged by states from northernmost New Hampshire to southernmost Georgia. Although all delegates were not present on August 2nd, 56 delegates eventually signed the document. Late signers were Elbridge Gerry, Oliver Wolcott, Lewis Morris, Thomas McKean, and Matthew Thornton, who was unable to place his signature with the other New Hampshire delegates due to a lack of space. Some delegates, including Robert R. Livingston of New York, a member of the drafting committee, never signed the Declaration.\n\nThe King of England considered members of the Second Continental Congress to be rebels and traitors. Affixing one's name to this document meant pledging your life, fortune and your sacred honor to the cause of freedom. While none of the signers of the Declaration of Independence was actually put to death for this act, many suffered consequences during the course of the Revolution. Fifteen of the signers had their homes destroyed; others were punished indirectly, through their wives and children. By the end of the Revolutionary War, more than one-half of the signers suffered physical harm, imprisonment, property destruction, or other penalties for their acts.\n\nThis document was featured in “On the Other Side” in the October 2004 National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS) publication Social Education.\n\nTranscript\n\nIN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.\n\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,\n\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.\n\nThe 56 signatures on the Declaration appear in the positions indicated:\n\nColumn 1\n\nGeorgia:\n\nButton Gwinnett\n\nLyman Hall\n\nGeorge Walton\n\nColumn 2\n\nNorth Carolina:\n\nWilliam Hooper\n\nJoseph Hewes\n\nJohn Penn\n\nSouth Carolina:\n\nEdward Rutledge\n\nThomas Heyward, Jr.\n\nThomas Lynch, Jr.\n\nArthur Middleton\n\nColumn 3\n\nMassachusetts:\n\nJohn Hancock\n\nMaryland:\n\nSamuel Chase\n\nWilliam Paca\n\nThomas Stone\n\nCharles Carroll of Carrollton\n\nVirginia:\n\nGeorge Wythe\n\nRichard Henry Lee\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nBenjamin Harrison\n\nThomas Nelson, Jr.\n\nFrancis Lightfoot Lee\n\nCarter Braxton\n\nColumn 4\n\nPennsylvania:\n\nRobert Morris\n\nBenjamin Rush\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\nJohn Morton\n\nGeorge Clymer\n\nJames Smith\n\nGeorge Taylor\n\nJames Wilson\n\nGeorge Ross\n\nDelaware:\n\nCaesar Rodney\n\nGeorge Read\n\nThomas McKean\n\nColumn 5\n\nNew York:\n\nWilliam Floyd\n\nPhilip Livingston\n\nFrancis Lewis\n\nLewis Morris\n\nNew Jersey:\n\nRichard Stockton\n\nJohn Witherspoon\n\nFrancis Hopkinson\n\nJohn Hart\n\nAbraham Clark\n\nColumn 6\n\nNew Hampshire:\n\nJosiah Bartlett\n\nWilliam Whipple\n\nMassachusetts:\n\nSamuel Adams\n\nJohn Adams\n\nRobert Treat Paine\n\nElbridge Gerry\n\nRhode Island:\n\nStephen Hopkins\n\nWilliam Ellery\n\nConnecticut:\n\nRoger Sherman\n\nSamuel Huntington\n\nWilliam Williams\n\nOliver Wolcott\n\nNew Hampshire:\n\nMatthew Thornton\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of the Continental and Confederation Congresses and the Constitutional Convention.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 1419123\n\nFull Citation: Engrossed Declaration of Independence; 7/4/1776 - 8/2/1776; Miscellaneous Papers of the Continental Congress, 1774 - 1789; Records of the Continental and Confederation Congresses and the Constitutional Convention, ; National Archives Building, Washington, DC.

After fighting broke out in Massachusetts in the spring of 1775, the King declared the colonists \"in a state of open and avowed rebellion.\" For the first time, many colonists began to seriously consider cutting ties with Britain.\n\nThe colonists elected delegates to attend a Continental Congress that eventually became the governing body of the union during the Revolution. Its second meeting convened in Philadelphia in 1775. The delegates to Congress adopted strict rules of secrecy to protect the cause of American liberty and their own lives. In less than a year, most of the delegates abandoned hope of reconciliation with Britain.\n\nOn June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution \"that these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states,\" acting under the instruction of the Virginia Convention. The Lee Resolution contained three parts: a declaration of independence, a call to form foreign alliances, and \"a plan for confederation.\"\n\nOn June 11, 1776, the Congress appointed three concurrent committees in response to the Lee Resolution: one to draft a declaration of independence, a second to draw up a plan \"for forming foreign alliances,\" and a third to \"prepare and digest the form of a confederation.\"\n\nBecause many members of the Congress believed the actions Lee proposed to be premature or wanted instructions from their colonies before voting, approval was deferred until July 2. On that date, Congress adopted the first part (the declaration).\n\nThe document seen here shows the vote on the resolution — the affirmative votes of 12 colonies are listed at the right. New York cast no vote until the newly elected New York Convention upheld the Declaration of Independence on July 9, 1776.\n\nThe plan for making treaties was not approved until September of 1776; the plan of confederation was delayed until November of 1777.\n\nTranscript\n\nThe Com. of the Whole Congress to whom was referred the resolution and [illegible] the Declaration respecting independence.\n\n17\n\nResolved That these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independence states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown and that all political connection between them and the state of great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.\n\nJuly 2, 1776\n\nNo. 5 } Report of the resolution for independency agreed to July 2, 1776\n\n[to the right of the just above section, written sideways from the right side of the paper are the following, fin this order, followed by a black line:]\n\nA N\n\nNHS ________\n\nMas. ________\n\nRo Isl. ________\n\nConnect. ________\n\nNJersey ________\n\nPennsy. ________\n\nDelaware ________\n\nVirginia ________\n\nN Caro ________\n\nS Carol ________\n\nGeorgia ________\n\nMaryland ________\n\n[At the bottom right corner of page, written sideways from top to bottom is:]\n\n90\n\n81\n\n96\n\n96\n\n-------\n\n383\n\n64\n\nThis primary source comes from the Records of the Continental and Confederation Congresses and the Constitutional Convention.\n\nNational Archives Identifier: 301685\n\nFull Citation: Adoption of the Resolution Calling for Independence from England; 7/2/1776; Reports on Administrative Affairs of the Congress; Papers of the Continental Congress, 1774 - 1789; Records of the Continental and Confederation Congresses and the Constitutional Convention, ; National Archives Building, Washington, DC.

John Parker gave this account of the battle of Lexington, Massachusetts. After confronting the British Regulars, Parker ordered his men “to disperse and not to fire.” Suddenly a shot rang out, fired by an unknown person; the British reacted by firing, killing eight of Parker’s men. This deposition, which was delivered to the Massachusetts Assembly and later forwarded to the Continental Congress, presents the American perception of the battle.\n\nThis and other documents about the battles at Lexington and Concord are included in the Massachusetts State Papers from 1775 - 1787, in the Papers of the Continental Congress.\n\nTranscript\n\nNo 4.
