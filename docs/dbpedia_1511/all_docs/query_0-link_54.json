        "text": "Grandfield, Sheila Ryan, of West Roxbury, died at home on January 3, 2023, with her family near. Sheila was born in Boston on November 16, 1950, to the late John W. and Gertrude M. Ryan. Raised in Chestnut Hill, she graduated from Newton Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in 1968, Manhattanville College in 1972, and Suffolk Law School in 1976. She married her former spouse, Robert E. Grandfield, III, in 1977, with whom she had three children: Robert E. Grandfield, IV, of West Roxbury; Sarah Grandfield (Nathaniel Adams), also of West Roxbury; and Jennifer Grandfield (Pouya Shahbodaghi), of Dorchester.\n\nSheila spent 40 years working in the field of real estate law, including more than 20 years as a Title Examiner at the Land Court until her retirement in 2017. She was liked and highly regarded by the countless judges, attorneys and others with whom she worked throughout her career.\n\nAfter being diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer in 2018, Sheila refused to let even a second go to waste. She took many trips with her children and grandchildren, visited Yellowstone National Park with friends of 60 years, toured the Galapagos Islands with her sisters, and spent Augusts on Prince Edward Island with assorted Ryans, handily winning the ladies’ division of the Rollo Bay Invitational Golf Tournament each year. Only a few weeks ago, she sailed down the Danube River with her daughter Jenny. A natural athlete, she was a lifelong tennis player and took up golf in her 50s, continuing to improve her score even while undergoing difficult cancer treatments. But her greatest joy was spending time with her large extended family, which she miraculously did once again just this past Christmas Eve, and she especially delighted in any activity involving her beloved grandchildren: Carys and Jack Grandfield, and Anne and Rose Adams. She found grandmotherhood to be the best part of life.\n\nIn addition to her children and grandchildren, Sheila is survived by eight siblings: Mary Gay Tobin (John), of Charlestown; Kathleen Murphy (John), of Cotuit; Moira Dougherty (the late Kevin), of Manchester-by-the-Sea; John Ryan (Kate), also of Manchester-by-the-Sea; Polly Ryan, of Boston and Cuenca, Ecuador; Peter Ryan (Frances), of Gorham, Maine; Stephen Ryan (Kate), of Weymouth; and Joseph Ryan (Kathy), of Attleboro; as well as 16 nieces and nephews, and many cousins and friends who were with her through good times and bad. She was predeceased by her parents, by her brothers Larry (2020) and Kevin (1955), and by her dear friend Regina Ford Novek (2011), without whose mention no biography of Sheila is complete.\n\nSheila will be remembered for her many wonderful qualities, notably her keen wit, exceptional common sense, and supreme devotion to her family. She had a unique ability to see and share the humor in everyday life, and her bravery and resolve were an inspiration to everyone who was fortunate enough to know her. She is loved, and will be missed, beyond measure. Donations in her memory can be made to the Susan F. Smith Center for Women’s Cancers, Ovarian Cancer Program, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 450 Brookline Avenue, Boston, MA 02215. https://www.dana-farber.org/susan-f-smith-center-for-womens-cancers\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated in St. Ignatius of Loyola Church, 28 Commonwealth Ave. Chestnut Hill on Tuesday January 10, at 10:00 am. Relatives and friends are invited to attend. Visiting hours in The Robert J. Lawler & Crosby Funeral Home, 1803 Centre St. West Roxbury on Monday January 9, from 3:00 to 7:00 pm. Interment Holyhood Cemetery, Brookline."
