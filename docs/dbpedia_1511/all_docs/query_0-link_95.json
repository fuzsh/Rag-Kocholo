A church was built in 1848 at Haverhill and Hampshire Streets, called Haverhill Street Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1868, prayer meetings held in South Lawrence in conjuction with the City Missionary Society resulted in the formation of Parker Street Methodist Episcopal Church. In the 1870’s, a mission was begun on Bodwell Street, which became the Bodwell Street Methodist Episcopal Church in 1879 (the name changed to St. Mark’s in 1890). In 1892, Haverhill Street became First Methodist Episcopal Church.

The church was organized in 1870, meeting on Blanchard Street until the sanctuary was constructed on Parker Street in 1873. The church was situated in South Lawrence and because of the City Missionary connection, became part of the New England rather than New Hampshire Conference, which administered the rest of the churches in Lawrence. In 1951, a Massachusetts Council of Churches study recommended closing or merging the church, and discussions began about merging with Central Methodist Church, a successor to Haverhill Street, but it took some time to arrange the merger since it involved two conferences. The last service at Parker Street was held January 2, 1955.\n\n1929-1955.\n\nMembership Records: 1930-1943.\n\nBaptisms: 1930-1943\n\nMembership: 1887-1943\n\nProbationers: 1929-1941\n\nOfficial Board records: 1934-1954.\n\nQuarterly Conference reports, 1947-1955.\n\nEnvelope of papers:\n\nParker Street Methodist Church, study by Massachusetts Council of Churches, 1951.\n\nProposals for contemplated merger and minutes of special board meeting, 1954.\n\nList of members received into First Methodist (North Andover), 1954.\n\nPapers on the church closing and property matters, 1955\n\nBulletin of Central Methodist (March 5, 1955) with list of members received from Parker Street\n\nChurch directories (1932, 1935), several newspaper clippings, and list of pastors through 1920.\n\nLawrence.
