        "text": "Description\n\nNathaniel Gorham was a delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress from 1772-1773 and 1785-1787. He frequently served as chairman of the Committee of the Whole and was a signatory on the U.S. Constitution. Nathaniel served as president of the Congress of the Confederation for six months. Before politics, Nathaniel Gorham was a successful merchant. In 1788-1790 Nathaniel became involved in a land speculation deal using Native American lands. His overindulgence in speculation got him into deep financial trouble. Nathaniel suffered from apoplexy and died a poor man.\n\nThe Confederation Congress, 1781-1789\n\nIn 1781, the Articles of Confederation established the United States as a collection of 13 sovereign states and served as the countryâ€™s first constitution. It was in force from 1781 until 1789 when the current Constitution went into effect. The Articles of Confederation established a league of friendship for the independent states and consisted of a legislative body with no executive or judicial branch. Every state had one vote in the Confederation Congress. In 1787, the Constitutional Convention assembled to redesign the government creating the U.S. Constitution which was ratified in 1789 and is in effect today.\n\nThe biographical History Mugs were created to teach and inspire individuals to learn about our diverse and interesting history. The biographies were researched and written by history enthusiast, Robert Compton. He colorized most of the historic photos and images used on the mugs, which were originally black and white or sepia-tone. The images and biographies are imprinted on mugs at his studio in rural Vermont."
