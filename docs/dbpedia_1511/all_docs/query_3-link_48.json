        "text": "Just wondering who you think would make a good first President of The U.S.? I think Benjamin Franklin could've been successfull as President. I mean, he had an impressive resume of accomplishments as it was. A scientist, an inventor, a founding father. This man was a \"Jack of All Trades\".\n\nIf Benedict Arnold didn't betray his country, I can also seem him as a future president(maybe even the first).\n\nWho do you think could've fullfilled the role of George Washington?\n\nBenjamin Franklin is in extremely poor health by the time the Constitution is written up, to the point that he dies less than three years after the ratification of the Constitution. He is senile and would not even live out a fourth of his term.\n\nJefferson is a possibility but I am hesitant to say he is a realistic choice given his political leanings. He is a member of the Anti-Federalists at this point, a group that staunchly opposes the Constitution. He didn't even receive an electoral vote in the original 1789 election.\n\nHancock's health is on a rapid decline by the time the Constitution is ratified and everyone knows it. He was unable to participate in the Constitutional Congress and was forced to resign as Governor of Massachusetts in 1785 because of it. The presidency would condemn him to an early grave. He's also got no interest in the Presidency.\n\nEveryone hates Burr, to the point where Washington refused his application for brigader-general.\n\nAdams is a good possibility, although he is likely to be a divisive figure. The presidency likely becomes politicized long before OTL with him at the helm.\n\n/Jefferson is a possibility but I am hesitant to say he is a realistic choice given his political leanings.

Hamilton could be a strong choice, likable and one of Washington's trusted advisers, along with being one of the founders of the Federalist and strongest supporter of the Constitution. Though age (being young) may play more a part in him not getting it as anything else.\n\nAdams is a good possibility, although he is likely to be a divisive figure. The presidency likely becomes politicized long before OTL with him at the helm.\n\nAdams I think is the best choice overall, Adams seems to have gotten a lot of flack due to some of the policies that Congress pushed that he kinda went along with (such as the Aliens and Sedition Act). Though that seems more along his character, go with the flow till push comes to shove then take a strong stance.\n\nJohn Jay is another possible choice\n\nAdams I think is the best choice overall, Adams seems to have gotten a lot of flack due to some of the policies that Congress pushed that he kinda went along with (such as the Aliens and Sedition Act).

He has quite a bit of political experience, having served as Governor of New York and Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Jay's popularity might be undermined by his vocal opposition to slavery, but there aren't a whole lot of other options. The unfortunate side effect is that we don't get his work with the Supreme Court. The branch is probably weaker as a whole.\n\nJohn Adams as President and John Jay as Vice President in 1789 seems like a good choice."
