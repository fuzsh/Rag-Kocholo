        "text": "After meeting for two months, the Constitutional Convention submitted this document to the Committee of Detail on July 24, 1787. The Committee of Detail consisted of five delegatesâ€”John Rutledge of South Carolina, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, Edmund Randolph of Virginia, Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, and Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut. This document, written by Wilson, lists the resolutions that had already been accepted by the convention. The convention recessed for 10 days while the Committee of Detail reviewed the document."
