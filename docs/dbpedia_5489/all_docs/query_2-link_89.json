        "text": "Whitworth University offers a variety of unique and inviting residence halls. Students are required to live on campus for the first two years after their high school graduation, so read up to learn which hall will best fit you and your living style!\n\nGeared toward first-years: Baldwin-Jenkins and The Village\n\nThe two exclusively or primarily first-year student housing options are Baldwin-Jenkins and The Village. They are for anyone who wants to meet and live with others who are also just starting at Whitworth.\n\nBaldwin-Jenkins: Baldwin-Jenkins (known as BJ) is a traditional, corridor-style co-ed residence hall that always has something fun going on from an all-night sleepovers to exciting nightly PrimeTimes. This lively and energetic residence hall is a good choice for those wanting to meet other first-year students in a fun environment.\n\nThe Village: This residence hall has three buildings with single-occupancy rooms. While some upper-division students live in The Village, it is primarily for first-year students who want to be in a small, tightknit community.\n\nBrother and sister buildings with rich traditions: Ballard and McMillan\n\nWhitworth has two single-gender residence halls in cozy, historic buildings. Ballard is for women and McMillan is for men, and the two buildings have some of the strongest communities on campus. Both buildings have four floors with shared halls. The buildings are often combined for events and are fondly called BMac. Events include weekly ones such as Milk and Cookies and annual events such as Ballard Tea and the McMillan Talent Show.\n\nOpen to all: Duvall, Arend and Oliver\n\nDuvall, Arend and Oliver residence halls are co-ed and house all class levels.\n\nDuvall: The second newest residence hall and also one of the most popular is Duvall. This castle-like building – it has a pseudo-drawbridge at its entrance! – is a good choice for anyone who wants to live in pod-style housing. There are living rooms in each pod and on every floor, making it easy to build community and make friends throughout the residence hall.\n\nArend: This residence hall is located in a great, central spot near the Hixson Union Building, library and many of the academic buildings. Arend has three corridor-style floors, with one reserved for students in the honors program. Also, it has a strong community, with each floor having its own personality and name.\n\nOliver: This is Whitworth’s newest residence hall, and it is also one of the most popular. It is fondly called the Ski Lodge because of its beautiful glass windows and plentiful wood accents all around the building. It has four corridor-style floors. Each floor has a lounge, and there are two kitchens, one on both the first and third floors. Some of the benefits of Oliver are that the rooms are big with air conditioning, the bathrooms have heated floors, and the building is located near the Back 40, Whitworth’s undeveloped forest area.\n\nWorth the wait: Boppell, Stewart and the Neighborhoods\n\nThe final three housing options, Boppell and Stewart halls and the Whitworth Neighborhoods, are only available to upper-division students.\n\nBoppell: One of the three newest residence halls, this apartment-style hall is a good choice if you want to gain some independence and start cooking on your own while still living on campus. Every apartment has two bedrooms with a living room, kitchenette (mini fridge, microwave, sink), bathroom and storage closet. Boppell does have a quieter, more independent community, but you still can get to know other residents living near you.\n\nStewart: Stewart is a pod-style residence hall with two rooms sharing a bathroom and a living room. It has a relaxed and calm environment.\n\nThe Neighborhoods: The Whitworth Neighborhoods program is a unique option that enables students to live in a Whitworth-owned house within walking distance to the heart of campus. Whitworth currently has 25 houses, and they are grouped in five communities. Every Neighborhoods house hosts an event each semester to help foster community. One of the communities is the Emmaus Houses, part of Whitworth’s Christian living-learning program.\n\nYou can learn more about the residence halls and take a virtual tour on Whitworth’s residence halls webpage.\n\nWant the best chance of getting into your top choice hall as an incoming Whitworth student? Make sure to pay your enrollment deposit as soon as you’re ready to gain priority consideration in housing registration.\n\nWritten by Denali Herrick ’24\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
