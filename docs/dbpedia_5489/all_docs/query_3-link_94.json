options. Before you take out student loans, explore scholarship and grant programs. Here are other resources to consider:\n\nAverage dorm cost\n\nDo hospitals help pay for nursing school?\n\nSchools offering tuition breaks for law enforcement\n\nDoes the military pay for college?\n\nIf you do need to borrow money for school, make sure you borrow responsibly. Brief yourself on the average student debt burden, and research student loan repayment plans sooner rather than later.\n\nGiving yourself a head start on your student loan payoff strategy may not seem necessary now, but in a few years’ time, you—and your bank account—will be glad you did.\n\nData sources"
