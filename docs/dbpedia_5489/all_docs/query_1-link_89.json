        "text": "As stated in my tips for prospective students section, I actually attended a different university for five weeks before coming to Whitworth. The level of rigor at Whitworth blows the other school I attended out of the water. That being said, the rigor at Whitworth is a good thing! The classes are in-depth and the professors are super knowledgeable; students are challenged to think critically and have intellectual discussions. Everyone - professors and students - is committed to learning on such a high level. The academic culture here values hard work, discussion, asking questions, and critical thinking like no other institution I know. Whitworth is a wonderful place to be for anyone who loves to learn because the classes and professors are focused on growth and learning, not passing exams. The professors also almost always ask to be called by their first names and often invite students into their homes for dinner or game nights, which is both an advantage of our small college and immensely helpful in developing positive faculty-student relationships. Our small class sizes also foster this idea, creating a rigorous and challenging (but valuable) academic environment.\n\nIn every single class I took, save one or two, I was required to write and to write well. I was writing several one to two page papers per week and was usually required to write at least two to three research papers per semester. It seems daunting and challenging, and it was. However, the feedback my professors provided and the ability it gave me to articulate clearly and write well is something I will never regret.\n\nEach class was difficult, no matter if it was a freshman class or senior-level class. The professors will not let you off the hook for sloppy work, procrastinating, or not using your God-given abilities, but they WILL help you every step of the way and are available CONSTANTLY for help and support.\n\nADDITIONALLY, unlike most colleges that have their graduate students teach freshmen-level courses, ZERO classes at Whitworth are taught in that manner; they are all taught by professionals in the particular field being studied."
