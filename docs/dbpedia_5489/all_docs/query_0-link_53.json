        "text": "What the World Needs Now\n\nA Whitworth Liberal Arts Education\n\nIn today's challenging economy, many liberal arts institutions are shifting away from the humanities and are tailoring their curricula toward industry-specific skill sets. Yet Whitworth is actively deepening its commitment to providing students an education grounded in the liberal arts and sciences.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause a Whitworth education of mind and heart, grounded in the liberal arts and sciences, provides students the best preparation for career – and life – success.\n\nAt Whitworth, students learn how to think, not what to think. They aren't merely trained, they are educated. They don't just acquire knowledge, they become equipped to flourish and adapt in their professions, as informed citizens, and as fully engaged human beings.\n\nSo What, Exactly, Are the Liberal Arts?\n\nThe liberal arts are rooted in a broad study of the humanities: math, psychology, science, literature, languages, philosophy and history.\n\nThe liberal arts reach across traditional academic boundaries, connecting and integrating multiple disciplines and schools of thought through interdisciplinary courses, faculty/student research projects, majors and programs.\n\nAt Whitworth, biochemistry and ethics go hand-in-hand. So do sociology and theology, and business and politics. And why not? They do in our workplaces and in our world, where fields of knowledge overlap and merge, problems are dynamic and complex, and their solutions require broad, deep and innovative thinking.\n\nThrough interdisciplinary courses, collaborative research projects, and experiential learning, Whitworth students push beyond their intellectual comfort zones to explore the interconnectedness of ideas and make new discoveries where disciplines intersect.\n\nStudents gain applied skills to succeed in their chosen professions, and they develop transferable skills that equip them to adapt to the 21st century's swift pace of progress and change.\n\nDiversity Is a Key Part of the Liberal Arts\n\nDiversity is inherent in a Whitworth liberal arts education. When people across racial, ethnic, gender, socio-economic, religious and other expressions of human difference engage with each other effectively and constructively, we begin to more clearly see varying dimensions of humanity and better understand multiple points of view.\n\nWhitworth's commitment to diversity stems from our Christ-centered heritage, which compels us to love justice and to treat each individual equally, with respect and compassion, as we educate the next generation of critical thinkers, discerning moral agents and responsible democratic citizens.\n\nWhitworth Prepares Students to Excel and Adapt\n\nA Whitworth liberal arts education equips students with the applied skills essential to excelling in their chosen professions, but students also acquire transferable skills that are crucial to adapting to the 21st century's unprecedented pace of progress and change.\n\nWhat can Whitworth students do with their liberal arts education? Anything they choose.\n\nWhitworth Students Gain Essential Applied Skills\n\nBeing a liberal arts university doesn't mean we overlook teaching the technical skills today's jobs require. Au contraire.\n\nAt Whitworth, caring, dedicated faculty at the top of their professions teach and mentor students, who master their fields of study and gain essential, applied skills to succeed in their chosen professions, from accounting, teaching, and graphic design, to athletic training, directing church worship, and computer programming.\n\nWe believe the best learning occurs within the context of relationship. Whitworth's 10-to-1 student/faculty ratio means that:\n\nStudents know – and are known by – their professors\n\nMore students conduct meaningful research with their professors and benefit from faculty mentoring\n\nSmall classes ensure that Ph.D. faculty – not graduate students – engage students in inquiry-based, experiential learning\n\nWhitworth has an excellent track record for placing students in successful careers and selective graduate schools such as Harvard University Law School, University of Washington School of Medicine, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton Theological Seminary and Stanford University.\n\nWhitworth Students Develop Crucial Transferable Skills\n\nGiven the 21st century's increasing complexity and pace of change, students are best equipped for success by not only mastering skills in a specific field, but also by developing broad skills that prepare them to be adaptable agents of change, not victims of change.\n\nThrough interdisciplinary study and research, engaging a wide range of diverse voices, perspectives and ideas, and participating in abundant experiential learning opportunities, Whitworth students learn to:\n\nAnalyze complex issues from a variety of perspectives\n\nThink critically and independently\n\nSynthesize diverse ideas and information\n\nAsk questions that yield original insights\n\nConduct research and produce creative solutions to new problems\n\nLead, collaborate and negotiate\n\nCommunicate clearly and compellingly\n\nWhitworth Graduates Stand Out\n\nWhitworth graduates stand out – and excel – in today's competitive job market because they:\n\nPossess strong industry-specific skills and transferable skills\n\nAre adaptable to and can lead fast-paced change\n\nPossess focus and perseverance to complete long-term projects\n\nPossess grit and ingenuity to solve complex problems\n\nAre confident and articulate writers and speakers, and understanding listeners\n\nHold a global perspective\n\nAre equipped to make sound, ethical decisions\n\nAre critical, flexible and creative thinkers\n\nCan collaborate across cultures and differences\n\nAre resourceful and self-motivated\n\nPossess curiosity and value lifelong learning\n\nAre informed and effective citizens of the world\n\nClassroom Study + Experiential Learning = Career Success\n\nExperiential learning is hallmark of a liberal arts education. Through boundless opportunities to participate in internships/practicums, collaborative research, study abroad programs, service-learning and student leadership, Whitworth students integrate and apply their classroom knowledge, and hone their skills in real-world professional and intercultural settings.\n\nInternships/Practicums\n\nThere's no substitute for experience. Gaining professional experience before entering the workforce is now a requirement for many employers. And since companies aren't investing as much in training these days, they are more likely to hire college graduates – Whitworth graduates – who can hit the ground running.\n\nInternships/practicums are critical for career success, because they:\n\nAllow students to apply what they've learned in classes to real-world, on-the-job experiences\n\nClarify students' career goals\n\nPrepare students for today's job market\n\nProvide networking opportunities\n\nCan lead to job offers from the host company\n\nWhitworth Career Services connects students with hundreds of internship and practicum opportunities locally, regionally and nationally, in a broad spectrum of fields.\n\nCollaborative Research\n\nThroughout the academic year, Whitworth professors engage students fully in the important work of discovering and disseminating new knowledge. During the summer, students participate in paid appointments as research assistants at Whitworth, and in notable research internships in the U.S. (which often provide a stipend, room and board). Year-round, students take advantage of opportunities to submit their work for peer review at regional and national conferences and to publish their work in notable journals.\n\nThrough collaborative research, students build valuable portfolios that demonstrate their knowledge and skills, and their aptitude for conducting original research. These portfolios give students a strong edge in being successful candidates for competitive graduate programs and industry careers.\n\nStudy Abroad\n\nWe live in an increasingly interdependent world, a world in which Whitworth students must be able to navigate diverse cultures, economies, political systems, religions and languages with skill and understanding. Through study abroad, Whitworth students gain invaluable cross-cultural experiences that challenge them personally and academically while they earn credit toward their degree.\n\nWhitworth's commitment to student participation in study abroad has earned the university a national reputation as an innovator in study-abroad programs. Of our 2023 graduates, 60 percent chose to participate in one or more off-campus programs during their college years.\n\nStudents can choose from study programs in 60+ countries. The Whitworth Office of International Education offers more than 20 faculty-led programs over Jan Term, May Term or a full semester. These courses allow students to travel and study in their areas of interest and specialty, under the direction of Whitworth professors.\n\nStudents also enjoy plentiful opportunities for independent study at one of our 150 partner universities in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia or the Americas.\n\nIn 2013, the Institute of International Education named Whitworth the No. 1 master's-level university in the Pacific Northwest for study-abroad participation.\n\nThrough engaging with different cultures, Whitworth students:\n\nGain empathy for others and a deeper understanding of the world\n\nReassess their assumptions, value systems and vocational commitments\n\nFurther their academic studies and earn credits toward their degree\n\nBecome better prepared to live, work, serve and lead in today's global society\n\nService-Learning\n\nNinety-eight percent of the Whitworth student body engages in community service, with service-learning opportunities incorporated into every academic department. Whitworth's Dornsife Center for Community Engagement connects students with hundreds of nonprofit organizations in the Spokane area.\n\nStudents evaluate and interpret their experiences through journaling, blogging and faculty-led group discussions. Dedicated time for reflection allows students to integrate their service experiences with their academic coursework and leads them to make new connections and gain new insights.\n\nIntegrating classroom learning with \"real-world\" experience allows students to:\n\nDevelop professional skills and discern vocational interests\n\nExplore career options and make professional networking contacts\n\nStrengthen their critical-thinking and communication skills\n\nAcquire an ethic of service and civic responsibility\n\nIncrease their awareness of societal issues as they relate to academic areas of interest\n\nGain a broader perspective and increased understanding of diverse communities\n\nBecome the next generation of leaders and social innovators who create positive change in the world\n\nStudent Leadership\n\nWhitworth's student-leadership program offers students opportunities to get involved on campus and develop leadership, service and communication skills.\n\nWithin residence halls, students serve as resident assistants, cultural-diversity advocates and campus ministry coordinators. Through the Associated Students of Whitworth University (ASWU), students serve as executive officers, senators and hall representatives, program coordinators, club officers and student media.\n\nThe Sciences at Whitworth: A Liberal Arts Advantage\n\nUnlike large research universities, liberal arts colleges and universities set a higher percentage of undergraduate students on the path toward scientific achievement.\n\nRecent National Science Foundation data show that students who earn bachelor's degrees at liberal arts colleges and universities are more than twice as likely to earn doctorates in science and engineering than those who earn bachelor's degrees at Ph.D.-granting research universities.\n\nAs a liberal arts university, Whitworth produces a greater number of scientists because we:\n\nInvolve more undergraduate students in professional research than is the norm at large research institutions\n\nHire and reward faculty for teaching and mentoring excellence\n\nEnsure small classes where Ph.D.-level faculty engage students in interdisciplinary, hands-on training and research\n\nEquip students with the broad knowledge base, communication skills and multicultural literacy needed to succeed in today's rapidly evolving science and healthcare professions\n\nThe Benefits of Faculty/Student Research\n\nDuring the academic year and through the Whitworth Summer Scholars Program, science majors collaborate with faculty on leading-edge research using state-of-the-art equipment. Recent research projects include:\n\nSpacecraft propulsion\n\nBiomedical optics\n\nComputational physics\n\nSoftware applications for autism screening\n\nTreatments for celiac disease\n\nRevising sleep models\n\nEnzymes, memory function and Alzheimer's treatments\n\nStudents also have opportunities to present their original, faculty-guided research for peer review at local, regional and national conferences, and to publish their work in academic journals.\n\nThese advantages enable Whitworth science majors to...\n\nLand competitive summer research internships:\n\n• NASA Ames Research Center • Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory • Stanford Research Institute • NASA Space Academy • California Institute of Technology • General Atomics • Microsoft • NASA Los Alamos National Lab • NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory • Stanford Linear Accelerator Center\n\n(Summer research internships are most often funded by grants or fellowships that provide a stipend, plus room and board.)\n\nWin national scholarships:\n\n• Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship • Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Graduate Scholarship • American Indian Science and Engineering Society Scholarship • National Science Foundation Scholarship\n\nEarn full-tuition fellowships to top schools:\n\n• Notre Dame University • Massachusetts Institute of Technology • Carnegie Mellon University • Columbia University • Cornell University • Princeton • Stanford • Harvard\n\nLead successful careers:\n\n• Aerospace and mechanical engineering • software and information technology • pharmaceuticals • environmental science • medicine • dentistry • physical therapy • veterinary medicine • nuclear science • electrical engineering • government agencies • teaching, industrial laboratories • aerospace industries • utilities and energy agencies • civil and structural engineering • medical labs • business • law • nursing …and many more\n\nConnecting Mind & Heart\n\nHere at Whitworth, even our mission is interdisciplinary: We embrace and integrate ideals that other colleges and universities – and the world – often dismiss as being at odds with each other:\n\nSharp minds and engaged hearts\n\nCuriosity and conviction\n\nGrace and truth\n\nFaith and reason\n\nResponsibility and compassion\n\nBoth inside and outside the classroom, Whitworth students:\n\nEncounter differing perspectives and are encouraged to question important issues\n\nLearn to not settle for easy answers, to engage in civil discourse about divisive topics, and to analyze complex problems with intellectual rigor\n\nAre challenged to explore and develop connections between their faith, worldview convictions, academic studies and vocational discernment\n\nWhitworth's shared liberal arts curriculum expresses the values of Whitworth's General Education Rationale by bringing together a traditional liberal arts education, steady engagement with contemporary culture and ideas, and a vigorous exploration of faith and worldview, with a special emphasis on investigating Christian belief.\n\nIn Whitworth's Core Worldview Program, students:\n\nExplore the external forces that have shaped their worldviews\n\nExpose their most deeply held beliefs to scrutiny by others and themselves\n\nApply their worldview convictions to contemporary society's most pressing ethical issues\n\nWhitworth students graduate with a desire to meet the world's deep needs with intellectual vigor, moral courage and compassion. They are prepared to excel in influence industries and professions that will test their mettle, and to live out their vocations by connecting their deepest convictions to their work and to other major life decisions.\n\nA Whitworth Degree Is a Sound Investment\n\nAccording to The Council of Independent Colleges, of which Whitworth is a member, private schools, unlike state institutions, are more likely to enroll and graduate low-income and first-generation college students and students of color.\n\nAnd more students at schools such as Whitworth graduate on time and have lower levels of debt than students at public institutions:\n\nSince most Whitworth students graduate sooner than their peers at public and private institutions, they have fewer years of paying tuition, an earlier start at earning a salary, and more years in their lifetimes to earn an income.\n\nWhitworth is widely regarded as one of the best higher-education values in the Western United States:\n\nWhitworth was ranked No. 3 in U.S. News & World Report's 2024 rankings of the best regional university values in the West. The Princeton Review also named Whitworth one of the \"Best in the West\" on the 2024 Best Colleges list.\n\nWhitworth is a recipient of the 2020 Higher Education Excellence in Diversity (HEED) Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine, the oldest and largest diversity-focused publication in higher education. This national honor recognizes U.S. colleges and universities that demonstrate an outstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion."
