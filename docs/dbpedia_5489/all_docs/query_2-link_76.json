        "text": "Complete your undergraduate degree at Whitworth while earning your J.D.\n\nGonzaga University School of Law and Whitworth University’s joint program provides students who have not yet completed a bachelor's degree the ability to apply to and graduate from law school a year sooner.\n\nHow it works\n\nGonzaga University Law considers applications for admission to its full-time J.D. program from any Whitworth student, regardless of major, who is eligible to apply.\n\nApplication for the program begins with a meeting with the Whitworth University pre-law advisor designated by the dean of college of arts and sciences provost. This meeting should occur at the earliest opportunity.\n\nAt the time of application students will need to have earned at least 96 credits from Whitworth. The upper division credit requirement (36 total) will be fulfilled by transferring credit from Gonzaga Law school to Whitworth.\n\nRequirements\n\nStudents must apply for admission to Gonzaga University Law’s full-time, regular J.D. program. We must receive all required application materials no later than March 15 of the calendar year in which you hope to matriculate at Gonzaga University Law. See full timeline and required materials below.\n\nTo receive preference for admission or scholarships, students should have a cumulative grade point average of 3.30 or higher at Whitworth. Once admitted to the J.D. program, we strongly encourage students maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.30 before enrollment. A drop in an admitted student's cumulative GPA below 3.30 during such period may result in rescinding our decision to admit the student.\n\nAdditionally, preferred students should achieve a score at or above the twenty-fifth percentile of LSAT scores for matriculants at Gonzaga University Law for the previous admission year. Please contact our admissions office to find out what the twenty-fifth percentile LSAT score was.\n\nTypical Application Process\n\nJune - July prior to start of junior year:\n\nAssess the academic performance to date to ensure that the 3.30 GPA requirement has been met and 50% of required baccalaureate credits have been earned;\n\nPrepare for the LSAT\n\nOctober - December of junior year:\n\nConsult with advisor to plan course selection for spring semester of junior year to ensure that all requirements for the baccalaureate degree, other than courses to be taken in the first year of law school, will be fulfilled;\n\nTake October or December administration of the LSAT\n\nNovember - January of junior year:\n\nReceive LSAT score and determine if eligible to submit application\n\nSubmit transcripts, including fall semester junior year grades, to CAS\n\nSubmit application materials to Gonzaga University Law, including:\n\no Application form;\n\no CAS report (includes undergraduate transcript and LSAT scores)\n\no Two letters of recommendation;\n\no Resume\n\no Personal statement;\n\no Letter of eligibility for 3+ 3 Program from faculty advisors\n\nJanuary - March of junior year:\n\nRequest interview after application materials have been submitted.\n\nTake February LSAT if necessary.\n\nTuition and Financial Aid\n\nWhitworth students who apply for admission to, or matriculate in, the program can apply for any and all applicable scholarships and other financial aid at Gonzaga University Law on the same terms as any other students. Total scholarships awarded, including external scholarships, may not exceed Gonzaga University Law's tuition cost. Financial aid from Whitworth will not transfer to Gonzaga."
