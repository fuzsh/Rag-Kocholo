        "text": "Students who haven't received their high school diploma, or taken any college courses since receiving their high school diploma, should submit the first-year application. Whitworth University seeks well-rounded, academically qualified students who are equipped to succeed in our challenging and supportive environment. It's free to apply to Whitworth. Student with transcripts from an accredited high school or college courses (i.e. Running Start) have the option not to submit test scores with their application. Student who have only attended non-accredited homeschool programs or who received competency-based grades with no cumulative GPA are required to submit a test scores.\n\nApplication deadlines:\n\nNov. 15 (Early Action I)\n\nJan. 15 (Early Action II)\n\nMarch 1 (Regular Admission)\n\nStudents who have taken college courses after receiving their high school/secondary school diploma should submit the transfer application. Our transfer students come from two-year colleges, other private liberal arts colleges and larger public universities. But from the moment you arrive on campus you are a part of the Whitworth community, and we value your unique perspective and contributions to the classroom and to campus life.\n\nFall semester application deadlines:\n\nJan. 15 (Early Action I)\n\nMarch 1 (Early Action II)\n\nJuly 1 (Regular Admissions)\n\nSpring semester application deadline:\n\nDec. 1\n\nI attended Whitworth blindly. I had this special tug in my heart that at the time I did not know what it was. Maybe it was the trees, maybe it was the squirrels, but I later learned it was God pulling me to a place filled with people who know and love him as well. He led me 3,000 miles away from Hawaii to come to Whitworth, which I later found out has one of the top education programs in Washington."
