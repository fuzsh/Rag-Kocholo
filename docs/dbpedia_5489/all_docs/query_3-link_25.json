        "text": "2020 - 2021 Costs Between $22,021 and $62,890\n\nFeeling a little stressed about paying $62,890 to attend Whitworth University each year? This number can be deceiving, and for many, the net price you pay will be less.\n\nWhile there is no tuition reduction for Washington students, 98.1% of freshmen receive some form of financial aid, with the average amount totaling $32,340. Students from low-income families receive an average of $40,869 in aid during their first year.\n\nProjected Costs Between $96,470 and $395,098 For a Four Year Degree. Between $46,988 and $190,337 For a Two Year Degree.\n\nLooking at the total projected cost of a college education over the course of two / four (or more) years can feel a little overwhelming. However, doing so will help better prepare you for the financial commitment you are making.\n\nThe overall cost for on-campus students to attend Whitworth in 2020 - 2021 was $62,890. To calculate future costs, we looked at the prior five years of data and determined that this cost increased an average of 3.7% each year. If this trend continues, we expect the full cost for incoming freshmen to be $67,656 during their first year. By their senior year, that cost will be approximately $75,491 for a bachelor degree candidate ($70,173 for an associate degree candidate) for a total of $286,103 over the course of four years ($137,829 over the course of two years). These numbers do not take into consideration financial aid, which reduces this overall cost by varying amounts per student.\n\nRemember, the full costs quoted above are not what most students will pay, and the net price varies quite a bit based on individual circumstances."
