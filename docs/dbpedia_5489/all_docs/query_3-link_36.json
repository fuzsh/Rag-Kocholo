University Scholarships are based on a holistic review of students' academic profile, personal background and other factors.\n\nAn estimated net price to attend Whitworth after accounting for scholarships and grants.\n\nAn estimated net price to attend Whitworth after accounting for all sources of financial aid.\n\nPart 1 will collect some basic information about the student.\n\nPart 2 will collect an Expected Family Contribution (either from the FAFSA or the Federal Student Aid Estimator found here: https://studentaid.gov/aid-estimator).\n\nWe hope that you find this calculator helpful in understanding the resources available to attend Whitworth.\n\n* I acknowledge that the estimate provided using this calculator does not represent a final determination, or actual offer of financial assistance, or a final net price.
