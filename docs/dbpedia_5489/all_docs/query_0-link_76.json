Recognized as one of the top regional colleges and universities in the West, Whitworth University has an enrollment of 3,000 students and offers 60 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. In recent years, Whitworth has enjoyed record levels of student enrollment and retention, the strongest financial position in the university's history, and increased external visibility.\n\nWhitworth University's 200-acre campus of red-brick buildings and tall pines offers a beautiful, inviting and secure learning environment. More than $100 million in campus improvements have been made in recent years, including an expanded dining hall, a rec center, a science hall, a center for the visual arts, three residence halls and an intramural sports field.\n\nIn all of its endeavors, Whitworth seeks to advance its founder's mission of equipping students to \"honor God, follow Christ and serve humanity.\""
