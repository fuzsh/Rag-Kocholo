Other sources of grant aid are excluded. Aid awarded anytime during the full aid year is included.\n\nAverage net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance. Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.\n\n$25,785\n\nCalculate your net cost\n\nAverage Net Price By Family Income\n\nIncome\n\nAverage Amount\n\n< $30k\n\n$19,853\n\n$30k - $48k\n\n$18,833\n\n$48k - $75k\n\n$25,528\n\n$75k - $110k\n\n$30,131\n\n$110k+\n\n$34,762\n\nTuition\n\nIn-State Tuition In-state tuition is the tuition charged by institutions to those students who meet the state's or institution's residency requirements.

Being a private college, the tuition is higher, but the education to be received is worth it.\n\nJD from Livingston, MT\n\nWhitworth is very expensive. Although they do offer scholarships, the cost to attend the university is significant. I do believe that it is a wonderful institution, but I'm not sure if the cost is necessary--I feel like it puts a burden on many students.\n\nJenna from Grand Junction, CO\n\nWhitworth is expensive - there's no doubt about it. They offer nice academic scholarships though, but honestly, Whitworth is so special that it makes the price tag worth it. The people here create a truly unique, loving, accepting, kind community, and the rigor makes Whitworth a great choice academically. We have tons of intramurals, clubs, and opportunities to serve the community, and there is always something going on, whether it's games in the dorms, movies at the rec center, or cookies at the President's house. I would not want to complete my undergraduate degree anywhere else.\n\nRylee from Spokane, WA\n\nIt is expensive to attend, HOWEVER, Whitworth has consistently ranked among the top 100 universities in the country to offer financial aid to its students. The average financial aid package is close to $25,000 with many students receiving free tuition.\n\nJoshua from Mission, TX\n\nyes, whitworth is expensive, but it is worth every penny! (plus there is lots of financial aid available.) the tuition gets you a quality undergrad education that prepares you very well for either the workforce or grad school and life in general. the overall experience of whitworth is also very welcoming and positive and prospective students should consider the spiritual growth that they will undoubtedly experience while here also.\n\nKatelyn from Union, OR\n\nwhitworth is a private university, but the price is worth the academic merit.\n\nHailey from Greenacres, WA\n\nFrom personal communication and relationships with professors, to cozy residence halls and a close knit community of students, Whitworth University is well worth its expensive price-tag.\n\nAnya from Medford, OR\n\nYes, this is an expensive private university, but I believe the school has so many advantages that make it a great value. Out of all the schools I applied too, Whitworth granted me the largest scholarship of $11,000 per year for four years. A few things that makes this school worth the price is that the class sizes are usually less than 20, the professors actually care about you as a whole person, are willing to help you one on one, and are understanding when you have a crisis. Not to mention there is so much openness between students and staff who want to investigate the spiritual side of the world. No matter what religion (or non-religion), students with various worldviews are encouraged to tackle big questions and present as well as develop their personal worldview while at Whitworth. This dimension is of Whitworth, combining mind and heart, is a unique aspect of the university. It truly feels like home.\n\nEmily from Woodinville, WA\n\nDon't let the initial cost of Whitworth deter you from wanting to go. The financial aid here at Whitworth is some of the best around. It is a private college so the tuition is pretty high, but the financial aid office makes it reasonable for just about anyone to go. The education you receive is well worth the cost too.\n\nTaylor from Rathdrum, ID\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nSalem, OR\n\nEllensburg, WA\n\nCheney, WA\n\nSpokane, WA\n\nTacoma, WA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nPullman, WA\n\nSeattle, WA\n\nBellingham, WA\n\nStanford, CA\n\nPortland, OR\n\nSee All"
