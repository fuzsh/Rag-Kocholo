For the 2024-2025 academic year, here's a general estimate: \r\n\r\n- Tuition: \r\nWhitworth University's tuition for full-time undergraduate students is approximately $51,500 per year. \r\n\r\n- Room and Board: \r\nThe cost for room and board greatly depends on the options you choose, but you can expect it to be around $14,300. The university offers a variety of housing options from traditional dormitories to townhouse-style apartments, and multiple meal plan options. \r\n\r\n- Other fees: \r\nColleges often have a few miscellaneous expenses to keep in mind. Whitworth University lists general fees at around $1,380 annually. \r\n\r\nThose are the main, direct costs: tuition, room, board, and other fees add up to roughly $67,200 per year. But don't forget to account for other personal expenses, like books, supplies, transportation, personal items, etc., which can add another few thousand dollars each year. \r\n\r\nIt's worthwhile to remember that these are sticker prices and there are many financial aid opportunities available, including scholarships, grants, work-study and loans, that can help to reduce these costs significantly. Use the university’s net price calculator to get a better estimate of what you might actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
