        "text": "Whitworth College is an independent institution located in a residential area of Spokane, Washington. The 200-acre (80-hectare) campus features redbrick buildings among wooded grounds. Pioneer Presbyterian preacher George Frederic Whitworth founded an academy in 1883 that developed into a college in 1890 and was named in his honor. The college remains affiliated with the Presbyterian church. Enrollment consists of roughly 1,500 undergraduates and 300 graduate students, many of whom come from outside of the state of Washington. Women outnumber men. Students are required to live in campus housing through their sophomore year.\n\nThe college operates on a 4-1-4 calendar, which means two full semesters of four months each and a one-month term in between for concentrated study. Many students use the January Term to go abroad on faculty-led tours. About 80 percent of Whitworth’s full-time faculty hold doctorates. Disciplines offered at the undergraduate level include liberal arts and sciences, business, art, music, communications, computer science, education, international studies, nursing, peace studies, religion, and sports medicine. A five-year engineering program is conducted in conjunction with various other institutions. Master’s degrees are available in education, international management, and nursing.\n\nExtracurricular activities at Whitworth include musical and theatrical groups, religious organizations, Habitat for Humanity, an international club, and intramural sports. Varsity sports teams compete in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. Twice a week the entire college community gathers to hear a speaker give a talk on a thought-provoking subject. School colors are black and red.\n\nCritically reviewed by A. Steven Graff"
