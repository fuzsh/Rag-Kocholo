        "text": "Main information:\n\nLinderhof Palace\n\nThe origin of Linderhof\n\nDreams and realities\n\nLudwig II, who was crowned king in 1864, began his building activities in 1867/68 by redesigning his rooms in the Munich Residenz and laying the foundation stone of Neuschwanstein Castle.\n\nIn 1868 he was already making his first plans for Linderhof. However, neither the palace modelled on Versailles that was to be sited on the floor of the valley nor the large Byzantine palace envisaged by Ludwig II were ever built. Instead, the new building developed around the forester's house belonging to his father Maximilian II, which was located in the open space in front of the present palace and was used by the king when crown prince on hunting expeditions with his father. Linderhof Palace, the eventual result of a long period of building and rebuilding, is the only large palace King Ludwig II lived to see completed.\n\nFrom forester's house to Royal Lodge\n\nIn 1869 Ludwig II had the forester's house rebuilt and appointed as the \"Royal Lodge\" (building phase 1).\n\nThe addition of wooden extensions\n\nIn 1870, under the supervision of the court building director Georg Dollmann, a wing with a single axis was added (building phase 2). While this extension was still being completed, the original plans for the building were substantially revised.\n\nFrom spring 1871 a second wing was built to match the first extension, with a bedroom forming the connection between the two wings (building phase 3). A wooden staircase on the west side provided access to the u-shaped complex built around an open courtyard.\n\nThe Royal Lodge thus became superfluous; the initial retention of this building indicates the king's emotional attachment to it.\n\nThe complex thus created forms the core of the palace. Its upper floor was a wooden post and beam construction clad with boards, while the lower floor was plastered; because of the wooden structures it was known as the \"Alpine Hut Building\". Its simple exterior, however, gave no hint of the splendour inside.\n\nStone cladding\n\nAn overall architectural solution was however necessary to unite the results of the piecemeal construction process. In February 1873, King Ludwig II approved a plan which established the final design of the palace.\n\nFirst the wooden construction was clad with solid stone and covered with a cross-shaped complex of new roofs (building phase 4). This section of the building formed the core of the new palace, but it still had no interior staircase.\n\nCompletion of the entrance tract\n\nOn 20 January 1874 the king gave permission for the \"Royal Lodge\" to be moved to its present location, around 200 metres away, and the new south tract was built in its place (building phase 5).\n\nIt was only now that the exterior of the palace acquired its final form, and the vestibule and staircase were incorporated in the interior. By 1876 work on the interior of the south tract was also complete.\n\nCreation of the landscape park\n\nThe transformation of the \"Alpine Hut Building\" into the \"Royal Villa\" had marked consequences for its surroundings. In 1874 the final plans for the park were submitted by court garden director Carl Joseph von Effner.\n\nEnlargement of the bedroom"
