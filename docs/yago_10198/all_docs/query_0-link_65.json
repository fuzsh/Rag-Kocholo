The sudden death of his older brother in 1795 brought him the headship of a collateral ducal branch of the Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld family; and soon afterwards he found himself first in line to succeed the childless Carl-Theodor, Kurfürst of Pfalz and Bavaria (1724-99). Under the watchful eye of his able minister, Maximilian Graf von Montgelas (1759-1838), Maximilian was able to initiate and implement a number of important political, economic, social, educational, religious, and welfare reforms, and steer his country through the turbulent era of Napoleonic wars, preserving the integrity of Bavaria’s territorial gains as well as his royal status of a king, to which he was raised by the French Emperor in 1806.”\n\nTherefore, the emphasis in Wintehalter’s lithographic portrait is not so much on Maximilian I Joseph’s royal status and accident of birth, but on his civic virtues and his role as the premier civil servant of the constitutional monarchy.\n\n© Eugene Barilo von Reisberg, 2013.\n\nPortrait of Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria (1756-1825), after Joseph Karl Stieler (1781-1858) [Part I]\n\nWhile in Munich, I was also able to augment my research on Winterhalter’s lithographic portraits after Joseph Karl Stieler (1781-1858), beginning with the portrait of Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria (1781-1858) (see cat. no. 25).\n\nAs I am stating in my forthcoming PhD dissertation on the artist, Winterhalter’s lithographs after Stieler “are the very first recorded and extant examples of royal portraits in Winterhalter’s oeuvre”. All of Winterhalter’s lithographic portraits after Stieler are re-imagined as “half-length ovals, recreating the feel and style of intimate rococo miniatures, visually and psychologically endearing the subjects to the beholder.”\n\nI always found this portrait of Maximilian I Joseph to be one of the most sympathetic renderings of the aged Bavarian monarch. As I write, “the king’s garments consist of a simple shirt and cravat, a vest, and a jacket, the top buttons of which are undone, struggling to contain the king’s expanding frame. No crown burdens his brow, and the humble row of military and honorary badges on his lapel is the only status signifier of the monarch.”\n\nThe original portrait remains untraced, and it is most likely that Winterhalter’s lithograph represents an amalgamation of several portraits of the Bavarian monarch by Joseph Stieler.\n\n© Eugene Barilo von Reisberg, 2013.\n\nPortrait of Wilhelm Urban (1795-1833), 1829 [Part II]\n\nWinterhalter depicts Wilhelm Urban wearing a plaid scarf, which looks rather Scottish. The reasons for this might be found in the sitter’s biography.\n\nWilhelm Urban (Munich 6.01.1795 – Munich 28.02.1833), Bavarian actor and playwright, was considered to be one of the finest performers to grace the stage of the Munich’s Hoftheater. He debuted around 1812 at the Bamberg Theatre, but returned the following year to Munich to perform at the Isartortheater. His debut as Fridolin, in an eponymous play by Holbein, at the Munich Hoftheater the same year landed him a contract with the court troupe, with which he would remain for the next twenty years. He was described by his contemporaries as being small of stature, but having the ability to charm everyone with his good looks, dark eyes, and melodic voice.\n\nUrban favoured plays by the great masters, delivered both tragic and comedic roles with a great aplomb, and his performances were distinguished by the serious approach of his acting methodology, depth of emotional feeling, and great conviction in the overall delivery of his lines. His greatest acting roles were in the plays of Goethe and Shakespeare, and his appearances on the stages of Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, and Vienna extended his fame beyond Bavarian borders. Urban also tried his hand in writing and poetry, as well as stage direction.\n\nUrban died after a long illness at the age of 38, survived by his widow and eight children.\n\nEvery biographer, and every contemporary, mentions without fail that his performance in the title of role of Shakespeare’s Hamlet, and his delivery of the celebrated soliloquy “Sein oder Nichtsein” remained unequalled on the Munich stage. It is therefore possible that the ‘Scottish touch’ in Winterhalter’s portrait of Wilhelm Urban refers to the celebrated ‘Scottish Play’ in which Urban so universally excelled.\n\nhttp://www.sgsm.eu/\n\n© Eugene Barilo von Reisberg, 2013.\n\nPortrait of Franz Oliver Graf von Jenison zu Walworth (1787-1867) [Part III]\n\nThe biographical research on the sitter tells us that Franz Oliver Graf von Jenison zu Walworth (Heidelberg 9.06.1787 – Florence 20.05.1867), a scion of a British aristocratic family and son of Franz v. J.-W., Chamberlain at the Court of Darmstadt, was born 9.06.1787 in Heidelberg, where his grandfather settled after emigrating from England in 1775. He began his diplomatic career at the age of 23 as a secretary with the Bavarian Legation in Berlin. In 1811 he was dispatched to St Petersburg, to Paris in 1813, and London in 1814. In 1816 he was appointed to Naples, where he remained until 1821. In 1824 he was appointed Bavarian ambassador to the Netherlands, but in 1826 he decided to temporarily retire from diplomatic service, to which he returned in 1833 serving as ambassador to London until 1835. Same year he was sent to the court of King Otto of Greece in Athens, but later that year reappointed as ambassador to Paris. In 1839 he was appointed to the embassy in St Petersburg, and in 1842 to Vienna. He finally retired from the diplomatic service in 1847, and spent last years of his life in Italy, dying in Florence on 20 May 1867.\n\nAs per my previous entry, von Jenison zu Walworth’s dates as Bavarian Ambassador to Paris correspond with the date the portrait was painted (1837), although it remains uncertain whether the portrait was commissioned by the ambassador from Winterhalter or painted on the artist’s own volition for a possible showing at the Salon.\n\nThe portrait most likely remained in von Jenison zu Walworth’s collection, and upon his death donated to the Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen (Inv. WAF 1196). Today it is at the Neue Pinakothek, where it is can be seen in the context of works by other notable German artists who were active in Bavaria in the first half of the nineteenth century.\n\nhttp://www.pinakothek.de/neue-pinakothek\n\n© Eugene Barilo von Reisberg, 2013."
