        "text": "Royal couples of the past are rarely known to have shown great love and devotion to each other, but this was not the case for Princess Maria Anna of Savoy, consort of the unfortunate emperor of Austria, Ferdinand I.\n\nMaria Anna and her twin sister Maria Teresa were born on 19 September 1803 in Palazzo Colonna in Rome, to HRM King Vittorio Emanuele I of Piedmont-Sardinia and his consort Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este. The two sisters had the honor of being baptized by His Holiness Pope Pius VII, during the period when the Savoy royals had been forced out of Turin by the French and spent most of their time in Sardinia or in the parts of Italy that weren’t under French control.\n\nMaria Anna was set to marry the heir of the Habsburg throne at the age of 27, Ferdinand. However, he was not the ideal spouse the princess dreamed of: he was epileptic, suffered of hydrocephalus and had a series of mental disorders. Nevertheless, the two married by proxy in Turin on February 12, 1831 and subsequently met in person to get married on February 27 in Vienna.\n\nWhen the Princess first met her future husband, she couldn’t look at him without crying. It was just a first impression, of course, she didn’t know him at all, but he certainly wasn’t remotely similar to the strong and handsome prince young girls dreamt of marrying. All the same, Maria Anna had been raised with a strong sense of duty and took her marriage vows seriously.\n\nFerdinand was unable to consume the marriage due to his frequent seizures. The couple therefore never had children. Ferdinand, however, loved his wife as best he could and Princess Maria Anna was totally devoted to her husband from day one.\n\nOn March 2, 1835 Ferdinand succeeded to the throne as emperor Ferdinand I of Austria and Maria Anna became empress of Austria. On September 12 of the following year, she became Queen of Bohemia and was crowned in Prague. The emperor needed constant help with all his duties and the empress was always at his side. She was refined, devoted and faithful and the emperor held her in high esteem.\n\nIt soon became clear that, even doing his best and greatly supported, the Austrian Empire was facing challenges beyond the capabilities of a man afflicted by many physical and mental problems. The dramatic evidence of these difficulties came to light with the Revolution of 1848.\n\nRebellions spread throughout the Habsburg domains, including violence and riots in Vienna. It was clear to everyone what had to be done – Emperor Ferdinand I had to abdicate. He did so on December 2, 1848, reading his act of abdication with difficulty and passing the crown to his nephew, Emperor Franz Joseph. Empress Maria Anna, who kept her title, kissed her nephew and then accompanied her husband to mass, after which they packed up and retired to private life.\n\nFerdinand and Maria Anna spent the rest of their lives together, living a quiet and peaceful life. Freed from his imperial duties, the former emperor was able to spend his time in his two favorite activities: eating and praying. Obviously, Maria Anna played the role of nurse rather than conventional wife, for the most part. She did so with respect and with touching sincerity and devotion. She was tireless in caring and worrying after her sick husband. Many looked at her with sympathy or even pity, but those who knew the couple best looked at her with the greatest admiration for the loving care she had for her husband. During the winter they lived at Prague Castle and in the summer they moved to Reichstadt or Ploskovice (in present-day Czech Republic).\n\nThe former emperor died in 1875, mourned by his devoted wife who had served him with so much love and fidelity. On May 4, 1884 Maria Anna passed away in Prague and was buried next to her husband in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.\n\nLooking at her portraits, don’t they seem to shine with her tenderness and delicacy?"
