        "text": "Habsburg Branches\n\nIt seems to me that the House of Habsburg went over into the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in the 18th century. But where does that leave the descendants of the original House of Habsburg? (originaly it was thought there were none left)\n\nThere are a few impoverished royal descendants around, I believe in Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Spain. Are they answerable to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine or are they regarded as an independent house? And how are, or should they, be recognized by other royal houses and countries.\n\nI am specifically looking into the history of Juan de Austria (Habsburg) 1547-1578 who himself had offspring in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. One of which recognized and another from a silent marriage.\n\nThis is a real from pauper to prince story. Jerome/Juan de Austria had a childhood in which he was probably unaware of his father and heritage. However, as a young man he was called to his father and to court. Initially he was assigned a position as any other illegitimate, at the back of the line (literally). Over the next few years his acceptance into court and the royal family grew and in the end he was addressed as prince by the court. The issue here is that his father or brother never punt anything on paper (as far as I am aware).\n\nI believe some of these descendants are looking at reclaiming and recognition of their titles. But claim them from who? From the Spanish crown, the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, the country they are living in/are national of, or???\n\nI understand this is an effort to gain recognition of their heritage and titles, but not to re-establish the original house. Thus how do I/we look at this situation? If they are recognized by a country or another royal house, would this not be a recognition and re-establishment of the original house? And where would this leave the House of Habsburg-Lorraine?\n\nHi,\n\nEveryone says that the original Habsburgs have died out. However, I have found descendents of Charles V through his son Juan of Austria.\n\nJerome or Juan of Austria was born as an illegitimate son. However, he was later accepted at court and more importantly acknowledged by Charles V as his son. Which is the equivalent of today's legal acknowledgement procedures which ties a child to the family of the father. Juan of Austria was addressed as Don (Sir) but he later strived to be recognized as Prince. Only after becoming general and admiral with some important victories for the crown did he gain the respect he so yearned for. However, his father died and Fillip II was less likely to recognize his half brother. There are a few historical records where indeed Juan of Austria is addressed as Prince. However, it seems that today it is most common to refer to him as Don Juan de Austria.\n\nOf course, the crown of Spain passed through Fillip II etc. With the death of Charles II in 1700 the Spanish line was said to be extinct. In 1780 the Austrian branch ended with the death of Empress Maria Theresa. Who ensured continuation of the Habsburg name by linking it to her husbands offspring, thus the house of Habsburg-Lorraine was born.\n\nHowever, it can be argued that the original Habsburgs never totally died out. Charles the V is said to have had a few illegitimate children, and Juan de Austria as well. Juan of Austria is said to have had one marriage with a Dutch lady just before his death.\n\nFrom all those illegitimate offspring I do not know of any which have been acknowledged like Juan. There may well be more of them. In addition,... there is of course some ambiguity when it comes to his title. However, the romantic that I am, and seen the acknowledgement by Charles V, I would say that yes he and his offspring are princes and princesses.\n\nThus the house of Habsburg is not dead.\n\nI have found the lineage of Juan and the Dutch lady. However, I would be very interested if anyone has any more information on the other illegitimate children of Juan and Charles V? Were any of them acknowledged like Juan? I believe Margaret of Parma was acknowledged as well.\n\nDoes anyone have or know where to find information on these illegitimate children their lineage/genealogy?\n\nThanks\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hi Kataryn,\n\nI learned that last year they found documents regarding his marriage and offspring. I do understand that this was a marriage without the (apparent knowledge and) consent of Fillip II, head of the house. So not sure how this affect things on the legality of the marriage. Although, I ask myself when the Catholic priest performed the marriage it must surely be respected by everyone at the time!?\n\nSomeone in this forum and on some history websites refer to him being illegitimate. This term reflects legitimacy and law. The term/word came into existence around the same time as Juan. But I am sure that at the time the term Bastard was more used with respect to Juan. As to legitimacy and law, well Charles V did receive him at court and recognised him as his son. After Charles V death, Fillip II did accept his half brother in the family. I did not find anything on succession law of the time. I am not sure, but I believe the head of the house his word was the law and that was the extent of it. Anyone have any links/resources on (Spanish) Habsburg succession law of 1547-1578?\n\nComparing with English history I found this:\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\"By Roger Powell, MA & Peter Beauclerk Dewar\n\nSince 1066 when William the Conqueror (alias William the Bastard) took the throne, English and Scottish kings have sired at least 150 children out of wedlock. Many were acknowledged at court and founded dynasties of their own – several of today’s dukedoms are descended from them. Others were only acknowledged begrudgingly.\"[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\nIndeed, during his life, Juan was suggested the crown of Greece, Tunis and some other regions. Including a suggested marriage to the crown of England. But Fillip II as head of the house never acted on any of these suggestions and Juan died before he could reach his goals of being a monarch in his own right.\n\nSo, in that sense he was no Dynast, nor Crown Prince. But, although forgotten in time, he and his offspring are of royal blood and direct descendants of Charles V. Due to his recognition I do think he can be regarded as a dynast Prince. If Juan hadn't died just after his marriage, and if his son wasn't kept secret due to the Dutch revolt and Fillip II being suspected of fratricide history may have looked quite differently.\n\nBut those are big ifs, and realistically, yes his line has been living in obscurity. But I still feel that this line has more justification to call themselves (original) Habsburgs, rather than those of Habsburg-Lorraine, who often ignore and drop the Lorraine part from their name.\n\nThus, I wonder if there are other cases like this? And with or without recognition, I would like to know if there are more direct descendants of Charles V? Anyone know?\n\nPepin\n\n[/FONT]\n\nIt seems to me that the House of Habsburg went over into the House of Habsburg-Lorraine in the 18th century. But where does that leave the descendants of the original House of Habsburg? (originaly it was thought there were none left)\n\nThere are a few impoverished royal descendants around, I believe in Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, and Spain. Are they answerable to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine or are they regarded as an independent house? And how are, or should they, be recognized by other royal houses and countries.\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa, her sister Archduchess Maria Anna and their first cousins Electress Maria Josepha of Saxony and were the last dynasts of the Habsburgs. When MT married Franz Stephan of Lorraine, they had permission to rename their house/descendants into Habsburg-Lorraine (from the Pope, if I'm not mistaken). MT carried on the Habsburg line as her sister Maria Anna (who married the younger brother of Franz Stephan) and her only child both died during and/or soon after childbirth. Their 2 cousins married into other houses and were not allowed to carry on Habsburg line, although they (and their husbands) both fought for the crown lands of Austria.\n\nI'm not sure whom you're referring to as the other line(s)/impoverished royal descendants of this house. The only line that is ever recognized from the 18th century onwards are those descended from MT in the male line and formed different branches: the main branch, Austria-Tuscany, Austria-Este, Austria-Hungary, and Austria-Teschen.\n\nIf the Head of House then (Philip II of Spanish Habsburgs) did not give his consent to the marriage of his half brother Juan, then Juan's descendants have an even weaker claims on anything (other than those given to him by his father or half- brother). Indeed, The Spanish succession at that time recognize females as successors to the throne, there was no need to recognize him or his descendants as dynasts (even though Juan's father recognized him as a son). I'm not sure if this existed at that particular time but the Austrian line could succeed the Spanish line and vice versa.\n\nOn any claims on the Habsburg-derived wealth, I believe there is not much to be claimed, if any, from the Spanish Bourbons (main line in Spain today), who do not own very considerable (private) properties now. The cadet branches (Two Sicilies & Parma) of the Spanish Bourbons seem better off as far as I know.....According to royal historian Arturo Beeche, Duke Robert I of Parma remained very wealthy despite being deprived of his duchy: \"Not only did he receive a considerable amount of lands and palaces from his Parmesan inheritance, but he also received a fantastic endowment (both financial and territorial) from his uncle the Comte de Chambord, which included large properties in France and the Austrian empire.The confiscation of the Chambord estate was a huge mess. Eventually the French government had to compensate the Bourbon-Parma family\".\n\nSo, Bourbon-Parma is wealthy on their own even after losing their duchy because of their inheritance from their Farnese and Bourbon/Chombard lines, not because of Spain although they received titles and appanages from it. Note that Duke Ferdinand I of Parma (also Infante of Spain) pleaded with his son Louis (during the exchange of Parma/Tuscany/Louisiana in 1801) to remember that Parma (from Louis' Farnese great-grandmother) was the family's only real assets. Similarly, the Bourbon-Two Sicilies branch of the Spanish Bourbons was also considerably endowed from their Farnese inheritance.\n\nAs for the surviving Austrian line of the Habsburgs, I read sometime back that they are trying to get properties and money from the Republic of Austria, those that originated from the fantastic trust fund left by Franz Stephan (from his own private fortune as he was a very talented businessman) for family members who may need it. I also read that they were able to get back some properties in a few of their other heredity lands under the Austrian crown.\n\nSo, using all these facts on the private wealth of the existing Spanish Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs, what can the Juan's descendants claim from these houses now?\n\nI do know of an expert on the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs (especially 16th-18th centuries) and their various succession laws although he belongs to another royalty forum. I could ask him if you can send him a message or what. Just send me a PM about it. He can answer your queries much better!"
