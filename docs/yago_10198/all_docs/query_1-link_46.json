        "text": "Princess Anita von Hohenberg to christen Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection’s third Super Ship in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on 26 March.\n\nHailing from one of Europe’s oldest sovereign families, Princess Anita von Hohenberg is a direct descendant of the ship’s namesake, Maria Theresa, the Archduchess of Austria and Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. Maria Theresa reigned from 1740 to 1780 and was the only female ruler of the Hasburg Empire. The princess is also the great-granddaughter of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie von Hohenberg.\n\n“It’s a great honour for me to represent the Habsburg family in Amsterdam and to christen Uniworld’s new Super Ship, S.S. Maria Theresa, in honour of the great Maria Theresa,” said Princess Anita von Hohenberg. “My family and I are also very thankful to welcome so many people from all over the world to the Artstetten Castle. We have had so many amicable encounters with Uniworld guests during our hosted receptions. It’s a great pleasure to get to know them and share more about Austria and European history and life in the European Union today.”\n\nFor the past three decades, the princess has served as the managing director and owner of the Artstetten Castle and Estate in Lower Austria, the former summer residence of the imperial family. Open to the public, the castle serves as the final resting place of the princess’s great grandparents Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Este and his wife Duchess Sophie von Hohenberg, whose assassination in 1914 set off a chain of events that led to World War I.\n\nEach year, hundreds of Uniworld guests visit the castle and crypt and attend an exclusive private champagne reception with Princess Anita von Hohenberg.\n\n“We are absolutely ecstatic to have Princess Anita von Hohenberg as the godmother of our newest Super Ship, S.S. Maria Theresa,” said Guy Young, president of Uniworld. “There is no one more deserving of this honour than the direct descendent of Maria Theresa herself, who ruled for 40 years over an extraordinary and far-reaching empire.”\n\nS.S. Maria Theresa will cruise the Danube River through the heart of Maria Theresa’s former empire on Uniworld’s European Jewels voyage from Budapest to Amsterdam. She will also serve the line’s popular Tulips & Windmills, European Holiday Markets, and Grand Christmas & New Year’s Cruise itineraries."
