        "text": "Ludwig III (Ludwig Luitpold Josef Maria Aloys Alfried; January 7, 1845 – October 18, 1921) was the last king of Bavaria, reigning from 1913 to 1918.\n\nLudwig was born in Munich, the eldest son of Prince Luitpold of Bavaria and his wife, Archduchess Augusta of Austria (daughter of Grand Duke Leopold II of Tuscany and Princess Maria Anna of Saxony). He was a descendant of both King Louis XIV of France and Navarre and King William I “the Conqueror” of England. King Ludwig III was named after his grandfather, King Ludwig I of Bavaria. Because his mother was raised in Florence, Archduchess Augusta always spoke in Italian to Leopold and his three siblings.\n\nLudwig III, King of Bavaria\n\nIn June 1867, Ludwig visited Vienna to attend the funeral of his cousin, Archduchess Mathilde of Austria (daughter of his father’s sister Princess Hildegarde of Bavaria, the seventh child and fourth daughter of Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen). While there, Ludwig met Mathilde’s eighteen-year-old step-cousin Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este, the only daughter of the late Archduke Ferdinand Karl Viktor of Austria-Este (1821–1849) and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1831–1903).\n\nMaria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nThe couple had fallen in love during this visit and their decision to marry initially angered Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria-Hungry who had wished for her to marry Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Once permission to wed was obtained Ludwig married Maria Theresa on February 20, 1868, at St. Augustine’s Church in Vienna.\n\nMaria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este\n\nThe couple shared common descent from Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria (daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Karl VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel). Leopold III and Maria Theresa had thirteen children. The family mostly lived on their farms at Leutstetten south of Munich, where Maria Theresa cultivated rose gardens.\n\nSuccession\n\nTo begin the story of how Ludwig became the King of Bavaria we must begin with the deposition and death of his kinsman, King Ludwig II of Bavaria. Ludwig II was heavily in debt due to his extravagant spending on the construction of two lavish palaces, Linderhof and Herrenchiemsee, along with the resplendent Neuschwanstein Castle.\n\nLudwig II, King of Bavaria\n\nLudwig was also a devoted patron of the composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig spent all his royal revenues (although not state funds as is commonly thought) on these projects, borrowed extensively, and defied all attempts by his ministers to restrain him. This extravagance was used against him to declare him insane, an accusation which has since come under scrutiny.\n\nFeeling harassed and irritated by his ministers, Ludwig considered dismissing the entire cabinet and replacing them with fresh faces. The cabinet decided to act first. Seeking a cause to depose Ludwig by constitutional means, the rebelling ministers decided on the rationale that he was mentally ill, and unable to rule. They asked Ludwig’s uncle, Prince Luitpold, to step into the royal vacancy once Ludwig was deposed. Luitpold agreed, on condition the conspirators produced reliable proof that the king was in fact helplessly insane.\n\nA team of doctors had Ludwig had and his only brother and successor, Prince Otto, declared insane, providing a convenient basis for the claim of hereditary insanity. At 4 a.m. on June 10, 1886, a government commission including Drs Holnstein and Gudden arrived at Neuschwanstein to deliver the document of deposition to the king formally and to place him in custody. That same day, the Government under Minister-President Johann von Lutz publicly proclaimed Luitpold as Prince Regent.\n\nOn the afternoon of June 23, 1886, Dr. Gudden accompanied Ludwig on a stroll in the grounds of Berg Castle. They were escorted by two attendants. The two men were last seen at about 6:30 PM; they were due back at 8 PM but never returned. After searches were made for more than two hours by the entire castle staff in a gale with heavy rain, at 10:30 PM that night, the bodies of both the King and von Gudden were found, head and shoulders above the shallow water near the shore. (I will be doing a blog entry on the mysterious death of Ludwig II in the near future).\n\nThe King was succeeded by his brother Otto, but since Otto was considered incapacitated by mental illness due to a diagnosis by Dr. Gudden, the king’s uncle Luitpold remained regent. Luitpold maintained the regency until his own death in 1912 at the age of 91. He was succeeded as regent by his eldest son, Ludwig.\n\nKing of Bavaria\n\nAlmost immediately after becoming Regent, certain elements in the press and other groups in society called for Ludwig to take the throne himself. The Bavarian Legislature was not, however, currently in session, and did not meet until September 29, 1913. On November 4, 1913, the Legislature amended the constitution of Bavaria to include a clause specifying that if a regency for reasons of incapacity had lasted for ten years with no prospect of the king ever being able to reign, the regent could proclaim the end of the regency and assume the crown himself, with such action to be ratified by the Legislature.\n\nThe amendment received broad party support in the Lower Chamber where it was carried by a vote of 122 in favour, and 27 against. In the Senate there were only six votes against the amendment. The next day, November 5, 1913, Ludwig proclaimed the end of the regency, deposed his cousin and proclaimed his own reign as Ludwig III. The Legislature duly ratified this action, and Ludwig took his oath on November 8.\n\nMore on Ludwig III of Bavaria this Thursday."
