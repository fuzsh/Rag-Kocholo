        "text": "What would happen if King Felipe IV of Spain died in 1656, before the birth of his son Philip Prospero\n\nAny reason you chose 1656 specifically? If you want Maria Teresa as queen, any time between Baltasar Carlos' death in October1646 and the beginning of 1657 would do.\n\nWho would she marry?\n\nSince, I can only ASSUME you're trying to avoid a match between Maria Teresa and her uncle (which would be likely in 1648 - Felipe IV/Maria Anna's match was agreed in 1647; or in 1650-1651) as well as Ferdinand IV (the oft-touted but unwanted bridegroom (least from the Spanish POV) who died in July 1654.\n\nThis leaves the window of 1654-1656 open. During which the options are slim (parentheses are objections):\n\nHabsburgs:\n\nLeopold of Austria (fourteen years old and heir to his father after his brother's death).\n\nLeopold Wilhelm of Austria, Governor of the Spanish Netherlands from 1647-1656 (Ferdinand III's brother; and ordained as a cleric in 1625).\n\nSigmund Franz of Tyrol (younger son, only appointed a priest, never ordained)\n\nKarl Joseph of Austria (over a decade younger than MT)\n\nNon-Habsburgs:\n\nLouis XIV of France (top of Felipe's list of potential bridegrooms since 1648, but regarding a match, as unlikely as Leopold I and that's BEFORE we get into the Franco-Spanish War going on in 1656)\n\nPhilippe de France (heir presumptive to the throne of France until Louis has a son. Makes life awkward)\n\nCharles II of England (landless king. OTL Felipe offered Maria Teresa to try and sway Charles from a match with Portugal; Charles replied only if Felipe could match the dowry).\n\nThen we get to non-Habsburg, non-royal matches:\n\nFerdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria or his brother\n\nFerdinand Philippe of Lorraine - landless, in Spanish service and skilled militarily IIRC.\n\nCosimo III de Medici - four years younger\n\nCarlo Emanuele II of Savoy - has his own claim to the Spanish throne\n\nA Farnese - only pro-Spanish Italian ducal family with a glut of second sons\n\nEste (too pro-French as a general rule)\n\nGonzaga (already betrothed to Isabella of Austria as part of the whole end to the war of Mantovan Succession)\n\n@Vitruvius @Valena @isabella @VVD0D95 @Kurt_Steiner\n\nNo way in the hell Maria Theresa will marry Louis XIV (or Philippe d’Orleans) here (and considering the remaining candidates I think who Louis will marry Henrietta of England).\n\nI think the most likely husband for Maria Theresa here will be Sigismund Franz of Austria, followed by Leopold Wilhelm. Karl Josef is way too young and Leopold is already heir of Austria so a wedding to Maria Theresa is impossible unless his father do not decide to send Leopold in Spain (with the agreement who if Maria Theresa will die early childless, Leopold will remarry to Margarita or inherit Spain in his own right) and name Karl Josef as his heir in Austria.\n\nIn the very unlikely case in which Maria Theresa will NOT marry an Habsburg the less improbable match is probably Ferdinand Philippe of Lorraine, with Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy and Ranuccio and Alessandro Farnese having some chances (the latter two are interesting only if Spain want recover Portugal as they have a better claim on Portugal than the Braganzas). The others will NOT be taken in consideration at all\n\nHow do we feel about a Virgin Queen? Her sister Margarita Teresa is born in 1651 so alive in 1656 she is still packed off to Austria to marry Leopold. Maria Teresa reigns well by herself with no French entanglements. Next Queen is Antonia in 1683. She’s 14. Who does she marry?\n\nI don’t think there’s any reason for Maria Theresa not to marry if she becomes queen, especially when there are a number of Habsburg candidates for her hand. The French are out of the question as soon as her father dies so no worries about that. I have to agree with @isabella that Sigismund Francis seems the most likely, though I also like the idea of a surviving Karl Josef becoming Emperor while Leopold marries MT. I do agree though that Margaret Theresa will likely end up as Holy Roman Empress, married to either Leopold or Karl Josef."
