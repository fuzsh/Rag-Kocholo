        "text": "Archduchess Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este (December 14, 1787 – April 7, 1816), also known as Maria Ludovika of Modena, was Empress of Austria as the third wife of Emperor Franz I from their marriage on January 6, 1808 until her death in 1816.\n\nEarly life\n\nArchduchess Maria Ludovika was born in Monza on December 14, 1787, the daughter of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este (1754–1806) and his wife, Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d’Este (1750–1829). She was a member of the House of Austria-Este, a branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.\n\nHer father, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este, was a son of Holy Roman Emperor Franz I and Maria Theresa of Austria Queen of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, Archduchess of Austria. He was the founder of the House of Austria-Este and Governor of the Duchy of Milan between 1765 and 1796. He was also designated as the heir to the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, but he never reigned, owing to the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nArchduchess Maria Ludovika and her family fled from Italy to Austria when Northern Italy was conquered by Napoleon in 1796. This caused her hostility for Napoleon. In Austria, the Emperor fell in love with her during his visits to her mother. Maria Ludovika was educated by the Countess Almesloë, whom was sent by Maria Ludovika’s grandmother Maria Theresa.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn January 6, 1808 she married her first cousin Franz I, Emperor of Austria, King of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia.They had no children. She is not to be confused with Archduchess Marie-Louise of Austria, Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, (1791 – 1847) the eldest child of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. Archduchess Marie-Louise was Napoleon’s second wife and as such Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on April 1, 1810 until his abdication on April 6, 1814.\n\nEmpress Maria Ludovika, as leader of the war party in Austria, was a great enemy of the French Emperor Napoleon I of France and therefore also in opposition to the Austrian foreign minister Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich.\n\nThe French had protested against the marriage because of her political views. She had considerable influence on her husband, and her talent at ruling marvelled many officials, including the Prussian minister who considered her the ruling genius at court.\n\nAs Empress, Maria Ludovika was also immensely popular with her subjects who hailed her a second Maria Theresa. Together with her brother-in-law Archduke Johann, she made the war effort popular.\n\nDuring her coronation in Pressburg, she impressed the Hungarians so much that they declared large financial and military support for the monarchy if needed. But the Emperor hesitated and Archduke Charles, who had extensive control over military matters, advised caution. Only the effects of the Spanish revolt in 1808 allowed the war party to prevail.\n\nMetternich showed her private correspondence with her relatives to her husband, the Emperor Franz I, in the hope that it would discredit her. She was conservative in her views, suspicious of peasant revolts, but also patriotic towards her adopted land, and genuinely disturbed by atrocities that Napoleon’s armies created in Spain.\n\nThe Empress supported the war against Napoleonic France in 1808. From this year, her health deteriorated. She was opposed to the marriage between Napoleon and her step-daughter Archduchess Marie Louise in 1809. In 1812, she was a reluctant guest at the assembly of German monarchs gathered by Napoleon to celebrate his war against Russia.\n\nDeath\n\nShe was the hostess of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. When Napoleon was finally defeated she traveled at the end of the year in 1815 to her home country, North Italy, but died of tuberculosis in Verona on April 7, 1816. She was only 28 years old. She is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna."
