        "text": "Since 2004 the Sisi Museum has been housed in the Stephan apartments, so named after Archduke Stephan Viktor. Here numerous personal items that once belonged to Elisabeth are used to help illustrate the true personality of the frequently misunderstood Empress. The sensitively designed exhibits, created by renowned set designer Prof. Rolf Langenfass, are inspired by the monarch's poetry.\n\nThe Hofburg was the residence of the Habsburgs for over 600 years and thus the centre of the Holy Roman Empire. Apart from its function as the seat of government and administrative centre, the Hofburg was also the winter residence of the imperial family. From the 18th century onwards the court spent the summer at Schönbrunn Palace.\n\nDeath\n\nThe tour though the Sisi museum starts with Elisabeths tragic death.\n\nThe Sisi Myth\n\nElisabeth has gone down in history as an empress of eternal youthfulness and beauty. For more than three decades she was regarded as the most beautiful queen in Europe.\n\nGirlhood\n\nThe tour through the Sisi museum gives an insight into the empresses life, from her birth on Christmas Eve in 1837, her childhood in Bavaria, to her engagement with Franz Joseph in 1853.\n\nAt Court\n\nFrom the start, Elisabeth rejected this life, criticising the structures of the court and refusing to accept the justification for the rigid etiquette that prevailed there.\n\nFlight\n\nHaving put immense pressure on the emperor during the negotiations with Hungary for the Compromise, Elisabeth was forbidden by her husband to interfere in politics ever again.\n\nAssassination\n\n\"Now it has happened just as she always wished: quickly, painlessly without medical consultations, without long, anxious days of worry for her loved ones.\"\n\nEmperor's Staircase\n\nThe entrance to the Sisi Museum and the Imperial Apartments.\n\nTrabant Guards Room\n\nComing from the Emperor’s Staircase the visitor entered this room in which the Trabanten lifeguards kept watch night and day.\n\nAudience Waiting Room\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph gave general audiences twice a week, at which any of the subjects of his empire could attend to present a matter of their concern to the emperor.\n\nAudience Chamber\n\nOver the course of his long reign, Franz Joseph gave audiences to around 260,000 individuals.\n\nConference Room\n\nThis room was used for the ministerial conferences which were always chaired by the emperor. It could also be entered from the room occupied by the duty aide-de-camp, who announced the presence of the ministers to the emperor.\n\nStudy\n\n‘As soon as the children were capable of eating on their own they were allowed to lunch with him in his study – often as many as eight at a time.’\n\nBedroom\n\nWhen the imperial couple moved into separate bedrooms, Franz Joseph had a portable brown-painted iron bedstead set up in this room, an arrangement he also used at Schönbrunn, Budapest, Laxenburg, Bad Ischl and Gödöllö.\n\nLarge Salon\n\n\"… he [i.e. Franz Joseph] liked dallying in these small drawing rooms when he was visited by his family, his brother, his grandchildren, nephews etc. There in their company he would take a cup of tea at the twilight hour, chatting with them, and above all, enquiring after their wishes…\"\n\nSmall Salon\n\nThe Small Salon served as a smoking room and is today a memorial room to Emperor Maximilian of Mexico.\n\nLiving Room & Bedroom\n\nOriginally this room was the bedroom of the imperial couple. In 1870 Franz Joseph moved into a separate bedroom in the Imperial Chancellery Wing.\n\nDressing & Exercise Room\n\nThe Dressing Room/Exercise Room was where Elisabeth spent most of her time. This was where her day began, in the winter at six o’clock in the morning, starting with her daily hair-dressing ritual.\n\nLavatory and Bathroom\n\nFacing the Amalia Wing courtyard, behind the Dressing Room, are the empress’s Lavatory and Bathroom, which were refurbished in 1876 during Elisabeth’s occupancy.\n\nBerglroom\n\nThis rooms are painted with trompe l’oeil landscape murals commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa and executed by Johann Wenzel Bergl.\n\nLarge Salon of Empress Elisabeth\n\nThis room was used by Elisabeth as a reception room. When the empress was resident at the Hofburg, the imperial couple occasionally took breakfast together in this room.\n\nSmall Salon of Empress Elisabeth\n\nDuring Elisabeth’s time this room was used as an additional reception room.\n\nLarge Anteroom\n\nOriginally Empress Elisabeth’s apartments were accessed via the Eagle Stairs, which connected the Leopoldine Wing and the Amalia Wing. When the Leopoldine Wing was converted into the offices of the Federal President in 1946 access to the Imperial Apartments was blocked up.\n\nAlexander Apartments & Red Salon\n\nThe Alexander Apartments were used by Empress Elisabeth for dinners and receptions.\n\nDining Room\n\nOnce a week on Sunday the imperial family foregathered at a family dinner, which every Habsburg currently in Vienna was obliged to attend."
