However, for all my research, I have not been able to get very far due to the question of his marriage. In OTL both King James and...\n\nPC/WI: Charles V marries Claude of France?\n\nApparently, at around 1504 AD, it was planned for the Duchess of Brittany, Claude of France, eldest daughter of Louis XII of France and Anne of Brittany, to marry the future Holy Roman Emperor, Charles of Habsburg.
