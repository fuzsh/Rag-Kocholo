Maria Theresa Archduchess of Austria-Este was born in 1849 as the only child to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este (1821-1849) and his wife Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria (1831-1903). She had been predestined by her paternal uncle Francis V, Duke of Modena (1819-1875), to marry Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany. Instead she married in 1868 Prince Ludwig of Bavaria whom she had met and fallen in love with at the burial of her friend Archduchess Mathilde of Austria the year before. When Francis V died, leaving no surviving issue, Maria Theresa became a Jacobite pretender to the thrones of England and Scotland and was recognised as Mary IV (by those who do not count Mary Stuart, Mary III).

The marriage was a happy one, resulting in thirteen children. The couple and their extended family lived a relatively humble existence, mainly on their farming estate at Leustetten until 1912. After the death of the Prince Regent Luitpold of Bavaria, the de facto ruler of Bavaria, Ludwig succeeded his father, deposing King Otto of Bavaria - his cousin - who had occupied the throne, in name only for twenty-seven years, in 1913 and proclaiming himself King Ludwig III. By then Maria Theresa was 64 years old when she ascended the throne and the first catholic queen ever of the Kingdom of Bavaria.
