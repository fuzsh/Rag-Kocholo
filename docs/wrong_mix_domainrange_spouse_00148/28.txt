Following all the drama with Amber Heard, many have wanted her replaced in Aquaman 2 by Emilia Clarke.

And now, an image of Clarke in the role has surfaced.

Scroll on to see it for yourself!

Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the last few months, you’ll know that Depp recently won the highly publicized domestic abuse trial against his ex-girlfriend, Amber Heard.

But it doesn’t seem like the trials are over entirely.

advertisement

Back then, Depp released a statement saying the jury had given him his life back.

Heard can’t exactly say the same.

advertisement

At first, this coupling seemed to be at the start of a promising relationship.

After meeting on the set of The Rum Diary in 2011, the actor started dating Texan actress and model, Amber Heard, shortly after calling it quits with his long-term partner, Vanessa Paradis.

advertisement

They announced their engagement in 2014…

And, not ones to waste any time, they hastily tied the knot just one year later in February 2015.

advertisement

However, it was here when things started to go a little ship-shaped.

Their honeymoon period was rather short-lived as, just months after their marriage, Depp reportedly suffered a hand injury as a result of “smashing bottles and windows” during a heated argument with his wife.

advertisement

For the next year, various reports of abuse between the pair continued to surface…

So it came as no shock when Heard filed for divorce in March 2016, just fifteen months after the couple had initially exchanged their “I do”s.

advertisement

At first, the divorce seemed unsuspicious…

Many news outlets reported that Heard had cited “irreconcilable differences” while filing the divorce petition.

advertisement

But, only a few months into their separation…

Heard filed a restraining order against Depp, claiming that he had previously assaulted her.

advertisement

It was a big allegation to make…

So people were confused when Heard retracted her allegations just one day before the hearing was due to be held.

advertisement

But this didn’t stop the world from turning against Depp.

Heard had alleged that the actor had hit her on several occasions, and even provided video footage of him flinging a glass of wine across the room in a fit of rage.

advertisement

And, in 2018, the actress penned an article for The Washington Post where she opened up about her experience with domestic abuse and violence.

Though she didn’t explicitly name Depp in her op-ed, she did allude to the time period when, “two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.”

advertisement

There was an outpour of support for Heard…

Who was even made the American Civil Liberties Union’s “Ambassador for Women’s Issues.”

advertisement

And, despite profusely denying all the allegations against him…

Depp found his career taking a hit as a result of the ongoing scandal.

advertisement

Fewer and fewer directors were hiring Depp for roles…

And his appearance in J.K Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts sequel, The Crimes of Grindelwald, was heavily criticized.

advertisement

And, in 2018, he was dropped from his iconic role as Captain Jack Sparrow.

In a career-shattering announcement just 4 days after Heard’s damning article, Disney announced that the actor would no longer be a part of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.

advertisement

But then, there was a sudden change in events.

Depp filed a $50-million defamation case against Heard and presented evidence that he was the one on the receiving end of the abuse, not the other way around.

advertisement

Shockingly, the actor alleged that he was the victim all along.

Depp’s defamation lawsuit read: “The op-ed [Heard’s article] depended on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.”

advertisement

The lawsuit also stated that all of Heard’s claims were “categorically and demonstrably false”…

And listed down incidents of Heard’s alleged abuse since the start of their marriage, including punching and kicking, as well as staging her attacks.

advertisement

The allegations are difficult to read.

“She hit, punched, and kicked me. She also repeatedly and frequently threw objects into my body and head, including heavy bottles, soda cans, burning candles, television remote controls, and paint thinner cans, which severely injured me.” His lawsuit read.

advertisement

And, to tarnish the actress’ reputation and credibility even further…

Audio obtained by the Daily Mail was released that heard her admitting to attacking Depp.

advertisement

The case was grueling…

Depp then went to court for his libel case against The Sun newspaper – whom he is suing over a 2018 article in which he was described as a “wife-beater.”

advertisement

The pair were in court as part of the 3-week long trial.

While in court, both parties played pretty dirty, revealing compromising photographs of each other which have blown everything out of the water, yet again. And of course with the evidence came more allegations.

advertisement

Despite this, Depp lost the case, which was a massive loss, and terrible for the actor’s name…

So he decided to try once more to clear his name.

advertisement

Depp and his legal team were determined to prove that the pictures Heard shared in the case were forged…

To make it look like he was repeatedly abusing her, when in fact, according to Depp it was the other way around.

advertisement

As per Page Six, lawyers working on the case claim that Heard altered photos making her appear to have 2 black eyes…

Alleging she was attacked by him in 2015.

advertisement

Depp’s lawyer, Benjamin Chew claimed: “Ms. Heard’s counsel has repeatedly used these phony photographs at deposition.”

He also shared that he believes the LA Police Department “disavowed the photographs” that were previously given to the court and “did not depict what they saw.”

advertisement

Chew revealed that the LAPD “found no injury upon Ms. Heard and no disruption to the penthouses” upon inspection…

“Ms. Heard and her friends then fabricated photos that she used to obtain an ex parte TRO [temporary restraining order] and a $7 million divorce settlement which Ms. Heard falsely testified in London she gave to the ACLU and, more scandalously, to the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles; sick children with cancer,” he added.

advertisement

Chew concluded that someone “ doctored those photographs.”

“So, Ms. Heard or someone on her behalf doctored those photographs three years later. When that came up in her testimony in London, Ms. Heard falsely denied it. In short, Your Honour, without forensic imaging Mr Neumeister cannot properly assess or verify Ms. Heard’s data,” Chew added.

advertisement

Depp set up a lawsuit against Heard for defamation, claiming that his reputation has been tarnished because of the things she had said during their battle.

And Heard decided to countersue him, which is why so many big names have been dragged into the case, such as Kate Moss, Paul Bettany, and Elon Musk.

advertisement

Depp took to the stand on April 19, where he discussed standing up for his children and denied striking Heard in any way.

And people rallied in support of the actor.

advertisement

Depp took to the stand at Fairfax County courthouse where he described Heard’s claims as “heinous and disturbing,” LADbible reports.

He said that her allegations were “criminal acts against me that were not based in any species of truth.”

advertisement

Depp went on to deny striking Heard and any woman in his life.

“Never did I myself reach the point of striking Miss Heard in anyway, nor have I ever struck any woman in my life,” he told the court. “Since I knew there was no truth to it whatsoever, I felt it my responsibility to stand up, not only for myself in that instance, but stand up for my children.”

advertisement

Depp then further detailed the effect that the allegations had on his children.

“I thought it was diabolical that my children would have to go to school and have their friends or people in the school approach them with the infamous People Magazine cover with Miss Heard with a dark bruise on her face,” he said.

advertisement

Describing himself as a “very private person,” the actor said that for him “to come up here and sit before you all and spill the truth is quite exposing, and it’s unfortunate that it’s not only exposing for myself, it’s exposing for my family, it’s exposing for Miss Heard, it never had to go in this direction.”

He also added that his goal is “the truth” and that he isn’t embarrassed because “I know I’m doing the right thing.”

advertisement

Depp returned to the stand where he revealed more about his time spent with his ex-wife, Amber Heard.

There have been admissions about his severed finger, audio recordings of fights, and text messages revealing horrific desires.

advertisement

Depp took to the stand for his final testimony on Tuesday 26, and he got a lot of support online.

Fans were vocal in backing Depp for being wholeheartedly himself, which is something many felt was Heard’s downfall.

advertisement

Heard then took to the stand once more, where she brought up how the trial with Depp has affected not only her career but her mental health too.

She claimed she’s been “harassed, humiliated, threatened every single day” since the defamation trial began.

“People want to kill me and they tell me so every day,” Heard said.

advertisement

Depp’s lawyer, Camile Vasquez, then spoke of Heard’s alleged lies during the cross-examination, getting into a heated crossfire with her.

And in the final few days, before the trial came to an end, Heard’s lawyers also went to the extremes, trying to prove that Depp is a violent man.

advertisement

After the world heard the final arguments from both sides, the jury was in charge of weighing up the truth.

And they finally made their decision.

advertisement

After weeks of evidence, the jury decided that Depp won the defamation case.

Depp was awarded $10 million in compensatory damages, as well as $5 million in punitive damages, according to BBC News.

advertisement

This was obviously a huge blow to Heard.

Who still believes she should have won the trial.

advertisement

Amber Heard immediately spoke out.

Sitting down for an exclusive interview with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News, the star spoke out for the first time against the trial verdict.

advertisement

Heard passionately stated that the involvement of social media throughout the trial was ‘not fair’.

“Even somebody who is sure I’m deserving of all this hate and vitriol, even if you think that I’m lying, you still couldn’t tell me — look me in the eye and tell me — that you think on social media there’s been a fair representation,” Heard said during the interview, as per TODAY. “You cannot tell me that you think that this has been fair.”

advertisement

When asked about the jury not believing her testimony and the evidence provided, Heard let out her confusion, but also gave surprising empathy for the jury.

“I don’t blame them. I understand. I actually understand. He’s a beloved character, and people feel they know him,” Heard continued. “He’s a fantastic actor.”

advertisement

But, the jury isn’t the only people she’s mentioned in her interview because she quickly came under fire for slamming those who testified for Depp.

Talking of the people who testified for Depp, she said that they were “randos.”

advertisement

Many people took to social media almost immediately after…

“Amber Heard calling witnesses including Kate Moss randos is the funniest and most offensive sh*t I saw today. You are not helping yourself here,” one person said.

advertisement

“‘How could they make a judgment?’ That is what they were there for amber? Do you not know how that works?” somebody else questioned sarcastically.

“Amber Heard: ‘I heard that JD pushed Kate Moss down the stairs’ Kate Moss: ‘That never happened’ Amber Heard: ‘what’s with all these randos? Why’d she testify?'” somebody else joked.

advertisement

In the interview, Heard talked about the fact the jury didn’t believe her…

In a preview of the interview, NBC News‘ Guthrie said: “The jury looked at the evidence you presented, they listened to your testimony and they did not believe you. They thought you were lying.”

advertisement

Heard made it clear in her response that she thinks Depp’s acting was the reason she lost…

Heard said of the jurors: “How could they make a judgment? How could they not come to that conclusion? They had sat in those seats and heard over three weeks of nonstop, relentless testimony from paid employees and towards the end of trial, randos, as I say.”

advertisement

Savannah also brought up the First Amendment, a right Heard believes she lost as a result of the verdict.

“Here’s the thing about the First Amendment: The First Amendment protects free speech. It doesn’t protect lies that amount to defamation, and that was the issue in the case,” Savannah told Heard.

advertisement

“And that’s all I spoke. And I spoke it to power,” Heard replied.

“And I paid the price.”

advertisement

In the first half of the interview, Heard stated that “To my dying day (I) will stand by every word of my testimony.”

Speaking to Heard, Savannah brought up some of the audio recordings used against her in the trial, “I am looking at a transcript that says — he says, ‘You start physical fights,’ And you say, ‘I did start a physical fight. I can’t promise you I won’t get physical again,’” Savannah said, adding: “This is in black and white. I understand context. But you’re testifying, and you’re telling me today, ‘I never started a physical fight,’ and here you are on tape saying you did.”

advertisement

Amber replied: “As I testified on the stand about this, is that when your life is at risk, not only will you take the blame for things that you shouldn’t take the blame for.

“But when you’re in an abusive dynamic, psychologically, emotionally and physically, you don’t have the resources that, say, you or I do, with the luxury of saying, ‘Hey, this is black and white,’” she replied.

advertisement

“Because it’s anything but when you’re living in it.”

Savannah then said: “You’re testifying and you’re telling me today, ‘I never started a physical fight,’ and here you are on tape saying you did.”

advertisement

Heard replies, telling her that “20-second clips or the transcripts of them are not representative of the two or three hours [they] are an excerpt from.”

Her comments have been met with backlash, and that’s exactly what she’s worried about when it comes to speaking out.

advertisement

Savannah asked Heard if she was “nervous, as we are here today, about what you can say?”

Heard replied: “Of course, I took for granted, what I assumed was my right to speak.”

Savannah then asked if she was worried Depp would sue her again for speaking with her.

advertisement

Responding to Savannah, Heard said: “No matter what I say, or how I say it – every step that I take will present another opportunity for this sort of silencing, which is what, I guess, a defamation lawsuit is meant to do.”

She added that the defamation lawsuit is meant to “take your voice.”

advertisement

Savannah then asked her: “There’s a text message where Johnny promises total global humiliation for you. Do you feel like that came true?”

“I know he promised it, I testified to this,” Heard said. “I’m not a good victim, I get it. I’m not a likable victim, I’m not a perfect victim, but when I testified I asked the jury to just see me as human and hear his own words, which is a promise to do this. It feels as though he has.”

advertisement

In one text dated 16 December 2015, Heard wrote to who she claims was her therapist: “Johnny did a number on me tonight. I’m safe and with my support tonight but I need some real help. Can I come tomorrow. I called earlier because I thought I had a concussion and didn’t know if I should have called police. But I have a nurse close to me.”

advertisement

In another message, which was reportedly sent to Heard’s father, she wrote:

“I keep not fighting back. He literally kicked me and called me a ***** in front of everyone on the plane. It’s humiliating.”

advertisement

Many followers of the trial and subsequent fallout are continuing to claim that it’s time for Amber Heard to just admit defeat.

Since the full interview has come out, Depp’s reps released a statement about her comments.

advertisement

It reads: “It’s unfortunate that while Johnny is looking to move forward with his life, the defendant and her team are back to repeating, reimagining, and re-litigating matters that have already been decided by the Court and a verdict that was unanimously and unequivocally decided by a jury in Johnny’s favor.”

However, it seems Heard’s reps have seen this message and shared a response.

advertisement

They apparently want Depp to give an interview too.

And even suggested he sit down with Savannah “for an hour.”

advertisement

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Heard’s reps then responded to the statement, saying:

“If Mr. Depp or his team have a problem with this, we recommend that Johnny himself sit down with Savannah Guthrie for an hour and answer all her questions.”

advertisement

Since then, Heard has been thrust back into the spotlight, with numerous articles emerging claiming she wants a re-trial.

Documents, which were filed in Virginia on Friday 8 July, claim that the wrong person served on the jury at the recent defamation trial.

advertisement

They claim that the 52-year-old was on the jury for the entirety of the court case and are asking for the verdict to be rendered invalid as a result of this.

The document reads: “Based on newly discovered facts and information that Juror No. 15 was not the individual summoned for jury duty on April 11, 2022, and therefore was not part of the jury panel and could not have properly served on the jury at this trial. Therefore, a mistrial should be declared and a new trial ordered.

“In this case, the Jury Panel List included an individual named [redacted] with a listed Date of Birth of [redacted], 1945 residing in [redacted], Virginia.”

advertisement

“This means the individual would have been 77 years old at the time of trial… The 52-year-old sitting on the jury for six weeks was never summoned for jury duty on April 11 and did not appear in the list as required.”

As a result of this, Heard’s team is hoping for the trial to be rendered invalid so that another trial will take place.

advertisement

However, the judge has since confirmed there will be no re-trial and that Heard will have to pay Depp the agreed $8M in damages.

But her insurance company has recently revealed that they will likely not be paying the damages entirely.

advertisement

The latest news however is that the case between Depp and Heard does not seem to be over.

The court ruled that Depp must pay Heard $2 million in damages after a counterclaim brought by Heard against one of Depp’s lawyers was also upheld.

advertisement

Depp’s team is now chasing an appeal themselves, disputing the $2 million dollars he has been ordered to pay Heard.

They filed the claim, which reads: “Plaintiff and counterclaim-defendant John C Depp II, by counsel, hereby appeals to the court of appeals of Virginia from all adverse rulings and from the final judgment order of this circuit court entered on June 24, 2022.”

Will it ever end?

advertisement

Probably not, as Johnny Depp’s lawyer has now opened up like never before…

Talking about why Depp filed an appeal against his ex-wife Amber Heard’s own appeal…

advertisement

In other news, a source close to Depp, revealed to PEOPLE that the appeal was an ‘overwhelmingly positive verdict” for the Pirates of the Caribbean actor…

They also told the media outlet that both parties should “move on with their lives and heal.”

And that’s not all, the insider revealed some juicy details about how Depp’s legal team will definitely not back out if Heard decides to target the actor again.

advertisement

“But if Ms. Heard is determined to pursue further litigation by appealing the verdict, Mr. Depp is filing a concurrent appeal to ensure that the full record and all relevant legal issues are considered by the Court of Appeal,” concluded the source.

And well, Camille Vasquez hasn’t backed out from opening up about heard’s second appeal…

advertisement

In the conversation with Gayle King, aired on CBS Mornings, Vasquez said Heard’s appeal “was expected” from Depp’s legal team…

As the Aquaman actress “indicated” she had lost the trial she was going to appeal.

advertisement

King then asked Vasquez if she and her legal team “had a plan of strategy” the lawyer said:

“Absolutely.”

advertisement

“Mr. Depp ended up filing his own appeal so that the court could have the full record.”

“And [Heard] insists on continuing to litigate this matter, and we have to protect our client’s interest,” she said.

But that’s not all, as the lawyer expressed the fact that “both parties should now move on…”

advertisement

“We just are hopeful that the court will uphold the verdict, which we think was the right verdict, and allow both parties to move on,” revealed Vasquez.

She was then asked if Heard hadn’t appealed they would have, the smart lawyer quickly replied and said: “Yes. That’s a very fair statement.”

While Vasquez noted that their appeal in retaliation was the “standard legal procedure,” the lawyer also stated firmly that the case was ‘never about the money” for the actor.

advertisement

“This was never about the money for Mr. Depp.”

“But in order to protect his interests, as his representative, we have to respond to the appeal with his own appeal,” said the attorney.

advertisement

Since then, things have gotten even worse for Heard, as she’s had to sell her Yucca Valley home in the California desert.

Cashing it in for $1.05 million.

advertisement

TMZ revealed the news, and although it’s not known for sure why she sold the home…

Some have speculated that it’s to help pay the damages she owes.

advertisement

Heard previously claimed that she is unable to pay the $8.35 million.

So this could be the reason she’s moving.

advertisement

And to top it all off, Heard has now claimed that Depp’s “defamatory statements” about her caused her to lose millions.

As per Variety, the amount Heard has lost due to Depp’s “defamatory statements against her” varies from around “$47-50 million.”

advertisement

Reports, which were not allowed to be used in court, have come to this conclusion because Heard’s career was on the rise.

Entertainment industry consultant Kathryn Arnold said as per the New York Post: “It was that moment where not only was she a good actor, but she was now world-renowned because she was in the most successful film … for DC Comics.”

advertisement

“It was just this extraordinary moment for her, for her career to take off.”

She was also allegedly entitled to “tens of millions of dollars” from Depp for his role in Pirates of the Caribbean during their divorce, but she turned the money away.

advertisement

As well as her money woes, the recently unsealed court documents have brought important information about the case to light too.

It seems that according to Jennifer Howell, the boss, and friend of Whitney Heard, Heard’s sister admitted to her slicing Depp’s finger.

advertisement

Speaking with Vasquez at the time, Howell said: “I was sitting exactly where I’m sitting right now because I’m sitting at my desk in the office. So I was sitting right here on my computer, working, in my zone, responding, doing whatever I was doing.

“And right over there, there were two black-and-white chairs at the time with a table in between it. Whitney was sitting in one of the black-and-white chairs.

“There’s a door that goes out right over there as well, and she just screamed, ‘She’s done it now. She’s cut off his God damn finger,’ and made this huge proclamation. And I pushed my chair back. I was like, ‘What?'”

advertisement

She added: “And she goes, ‘She cut off his finger. She cut off his finger.’ And then she bolted out the door and was like, ‘I got to call somebody. I got to call somebody.’

“And she went out the door and she called someone. I don’t know who she called. That’s what was said.”

Heard still denies this.

advertisement

However, within the court documents, Heard’s legal team has shared something pretty personal about Depp…

Claiming his apparent erectile dysfunction could be the reason he was abusive to Heard.

advertisement

“Though Mr. Depp would rather not disclose his erectile dysfunction condition, such condition absolutely is relevant to s*xual violence, including Mr. Depp’s anger and use of a bottle to r*pe Amber Heard,” the documents said.

They added that his problem made it “more probable” for him to become “angry or agitated” and as a result “resort to a bottle.”

And now, Depp is in the news again…

advertisement

As the actor has reportedly signed a new deal with Dior…

This comes after the court win when Depp’s original Dior ad started getting prime-time placement on FOX.

advertisement

Depp first signed a deal with Dior back in 2015…

He became the face of the cologne Sauvage however the commercial stopped airing on TV after Amber first made her allegations against the actor.

advertisement

According to TMZ, Depp “did a photo shoot with photographer Greg before and after the Paris show.”

If reports are believed to be true, the photoshoot will be used in a new Dior advertising campaign.

advertisement

It seems the actor’s upping his career game by bagging years with the designer brand.

Dior’s head photographer Greg Williams even “attended one of Johnny and Jeff Beck’s rock concerts” in Paris as a “show of support for Johnny.”

And there’s more…

advertisement

As sources close to the deal told TMZ that “Johnny signed back with Dior to be the face of their Sauvage men’s scent” and the money’s good as well…

The multi-year deal is worth a whooping “7-figures” and the brand is “betting big” on Depp with this new contract.

Well, we are very happy for Depp!

A new image has been released which shows Depp in regal attire, with a black blindfold on and a white hat with hair sticking out from the top.

He will be playing the role of the controversial King Louis XV in the upcoming French period drama, Jeanne Du Barry.

advertisement

The movie is produced by Why Not Productions and directed by french filmmaker Maïwenn.

Why Not Productions has also confirmed that the shoot began on July 26 for 11 weeks, with locations including Versailles and other chateaux in the Paris region.

advertisement

Jeanne Du Barry is expected to hit our screens in 2023.

But now it seems the actor has another interesting venture in the pipeline as he will be directing his first movie in twenty-five years…

advertisement

Based on Dennis McIntyre’s play Modigliani the screen adaptation will be by Jerzy and Mary Kromolowski and will take place in 1916 Paris.

The plot revolves around an Italian-born painter and sculptor Amedeo Modigliani.

advertisement

According to Variety, Modigliani “long considered by himself a critical and commercial failure, navigates a turbulent and eventful 48 hours that will become a turning point in his life, ultimately solidifying his reputation as an artistic legend.”

Depp even went on to explain what the project is all about…

advertisement

“The saga of Mr. Modigliani’s life is one that I’m incredibly honored and truly humbled, to bring to the screen.

“It was a life of great hardship, but eventual triumph — a universally human story all viewers can identify with,” Depp said in a statement recently.

advertisement

The film also marks another collaboration between Al Pacino and Barry Navidi, who have worked together over the years on The Merchant Of Venice (2004), Wilde Salomé (2011), and Salomé (2013).

Navidi revealed that this project is close to Pacino’s heart…

advertisement

“This project has been very close to Al’s heart. Al introduced me to the play, Modigliani, many years ago and I instantly fell in love with it,” Navidi said.

He even said it is a dream to work with Depp…

advertisement

“This is a slice of Modi’s life and not a bio. It’s been a dream of mine to work with Johnny again — he’s a true artist with an amazing vision to bring this great story to the screen,” Navidi added.

But Depp will return behind the camera for a biographical drama Modigliani.

advertisement

While Al Pacino is producing the film along with Barry Navidi, IN.2, the European arm of production company Infinitum Nihil, is backing the film.

And now it looks like the actor has something else in the works…

advertisement

After winning 5 MTV Movie Awards over the years, which included Best Male Performance, Best Villain, Global Superstar, and the Generation Award in 2012…

It seems Depp is set to surprise his fans once again as he is reportedly going to make a planned surprise appearance at the upcoming MTV Video Music Awards.

advertisement

Sources told TMZ that Depp has been in talks with the show’s producers for a while now…

The sources also said Depp would dress up as the network’s famous Moonman, recently dubbed the ‘Moonperson’.

advertisement

And at the VMAs, Depp certainly made an appearance…

But not in the flesh…

advertisement

During the awards show, the cameras panned up to show the Moonman floating in the sky.

Depp’s face was projected on the Moonman’s face to make it look like he was floating above all the celebrities.

advertisement

But some viewers were not happy about it and took to social media to slam Depp…

“Man f*** MTV for giving Johnny Depp a platform,” wrote one Twitter user.

advertisement

“MTV is so disgusting for this Johnny Depp s***,” added another.

And among the haters was Amber Heard’s sister, Whitney.

advertisement

Whitney posted a screenshot of MTV’s award show logo…

But, in front of the iconic logo, she placed the letter ‘D’, alluding to domestic violence.

advertisement

And she wrote:

“MTV YOU’RE DISGUSTING AND CLEARLY DESPERATE! I REALLY HOPE THAT NONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THIS CALL HAVE DAUGHTERS… #DVMAS #ISTANDWITHAMBERHEARD.”

advertisement

And, now, rumors have surfaced about Heard’s fate in Aquaman 2.

Some fans reported that, when they looked up the cast of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom on Google, Clarke’s name appears alongside Jason Momoa and other confirmed stars of the film.

advertisement

Of course, this could just be an error…

But people seem very excited about the prospect of Clarke replacing Heard in the movie.

advertisement

So much so that they’ve begun creating fanart!

Take a look at the first image here.

What do you think?
