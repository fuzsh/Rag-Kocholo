My first move to North Carolina was at 18 years old to attend Davidson College, and my family has since relocated to Charlotte. After living in San Francisco for the last 5 years, I am happy to call Charlotte home again. I have spent my career in undergraduate admission at Davidson College, Stanford University, and UC Berkeley. Providence Day is my first independent school home! I am excited to help PD students find their best fit colleges where they will grow and thrive as young adults.\n\nMiddle School Strings, Performing Arts\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nAdrian Gordon is an internationally performed composer and seasoned music educator. He is the author of the book Note to Self; A Music Director’s Guide for Transitioning to a New School and Building a Thriving Music Program. Adrian wrote Note to Self because though his undergraduate and graduate programs were musically and pedagogically extensive, he never felt as though they touched on those hard-to-navigate areas of transitioning between jobs. Note to Self was written as a bridge for music educators who find themselves in similar situations.\n\nAdrian currently serves as the Director of Orchestras at PD. He believes in the power of music education in a child’s life, and understands the necessity of having passionate, confident, and supported music teachers at the helm, promoting great musical experiences for students.\n\nIn addition to teaching, Mr. Gordon is an in-demand conductor and clinician. He is also a composer with Alfred Music as well as the founder of Leap Year Music Publishing, which publishes string music for elementary, middle, and high school ensembles. His compositions appear on the Florida, Texas, Maryland, and Georgia Orchestra Association Music Performance Assessment Lists. His compositions are distributed through JW Pepper and have been performed throughout the world. He takes pride in creating music that is fun and pedagogically sound at all levels.\n\nAdrian received his B.A. in music from the University of Miami, and his master’s degree in music education at Florida International University. Born and raised in Miami, Florida, he currently resides in Charlotte with his wife Kelly and their two sons.

I love teaching at PDS. It is a rewarding experience to work with such passionate teachers, enthusiastic students, and loving parents. I enjoy getting students excited about learning.

My first teaching job was in Mobile, Alabama, and I have taught at Holy Trinity School and Charlotte Christian School here in Charlotte. In 2005, I was thrilled to accept a position at Providence Day School as a Middle School English teacher. As a Providence Day alum, I have had the opportunity to watch this school grow and change for the past 40 years. One aspect that has remained at the core of PDS is the family atmosphere and the sense of community. I am proud that my husband and I both found our calling here and that my daughters have the opportunity to experience the love and spirit of this place.\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nAs an alum (class of '92), parent of two PDS students (Connor, class of ‘22 and Audrey, class ‘25) and teacher, I am proud to be a Providence Day Charger!

I look forward to an exciting year of learning, playing and growing together in TK!\n\nUpper School Science Teacher\n\n9 Years of Service\n\nI left academic research to teach science to high school students and have never looked back. The joy of watching students discover, learn and grow is among the best experiences of my life. In addition to teaching, I love writing, editing and martial arts.\n\nUpper School Biology & Chemistry Teacher\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nI like to say that I make plans for my life and then I \"fall into\" things that work out way better for me than what I had planned. My career has been no different. In college, I majored in Zoology, Pre-Med, expecting to go to medical school and become a psychiatrist. After deciding to take a year off to work before going to medical school, I fell in love with biomedical research and decided to get a Ph.D. instead. After graduation, my career took me to teaching at a community college and then science writing and editing. I finally got back in the classroom in 2020, this time at PD. I love getting to know the students and trying to incite in them a love of science or at least help them not hate it. My connections with students and getting to know who they are what really interests them are my favorite two things about teaching.\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nAlthough I'm originally from Connecticut and New Jersey, my husband and I moved to Charlotte in 2006 and have made NC our home. We have two daughters, who came to PD in 2019 at the same time I started teaching here. I have worked with a variety of ages, in a range of settings, including preschool, public and private elementary school, and at Belmont Abbey College.

He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger.\"-Confucius\n\nAs a child I grew up in a military family and found myself moving routinely. I grew to love exploring new locations and learning the history and culture of each place I lived. This caused me to pursue a career in teaching History. I received my MA in Secondary Education and my undergraduate degree in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences from James Madison University. I joined Providence Day School last year after teaching in Charlotte and Virginia where I taught World History, A.P. U.S. History, and Sociology. I love the welcoming culture of Providence Day School and enjoy the enthusiasm and curiosity of the students!\n\nWhen I am not teaching I spend my time with my husband, chasing our 10yr old twins and 4yr old daughter around, traveling as much as possible, and enjoying time at the beach.\n\nExtended Day Teacher\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nExtended Day Teacher\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nMiddle School Science Teacher\n\n15 Years of Service\n\nMiddle School Science Teacher\n\n15 Years of Service\n\nThe Middle School science lab is an exciting place; and the enthusiasm and energy levels can be hard to contain!

In my classroom, the two go hand in hand. Seeing the smiles on my students’ faces when they are actively engaged in learning warms my heart. Prior to teaching at PDS, I taught primary grades for 5 years in public school. I have enjoyed teaching in multiple grade levels since I joined Providence Day in 2002, including kindergarten, first grade, and third grade.\n\nNot only do I wear the teacher hat at PDS, but I’m also a mom. My daughters started here in TK and are now in Upper School. Watching them progress through PDS has been such a blessing. As a faculty member, I know that they are in the best hands, learning from my colleagues.\n\nLower School Writing Resource Instructor\n\n50 Years of Service\n\nAnita McLeod started her career at Providence Day School teaching different courses in the English Department in Upper School. She is Chairman of the English Department and was Senior Class Advisor. Later, she began developing Writers Workshop for Lower School teachers and students, where her current position is Writing Resource Instructor.\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n16 Years of Service\n\nI love children and their joyful spirit, so it is no surprise that I fell in love with teaching. The enthusiastic curiosity and excitement they exhibit is inspiring and rewarding. When I began working at Providence Day School, I quickly realized what a wonderful place I had joined. Working with first graders is full of new and fun experiences. The children bring so much joy, and I am grateful to be part of the Providence Day School community.

Once that trust is there, the students can feel safe enough to take academic risks. If at the end of the day, each student feels successful and if at the end of the year, their passion for learning has grown just a bit - that is the definition of a good teacher to me.\n\nUpper School Mathematics Teacher\n\n1 Year of Service\n\nBeing born and raised in Charlotte and attending Charlotte Catholic High School, I have always admired the students and faculty that make the PDS family. I received my B.S. in Mathematics Education from Auburn University and began my teaching career at Ardrey Kell High School.

During that time, I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to conduct field research in Nepal and participate in an archeological dig in the mountains of North Carolina. Upon graduation, I decided that my next adventure would be to teach math in Charlotte. After teaching at a local high school for one year, I joined the PDS community in 2004 where I have taught math in the middle school ever since. My interests involve reading, weight lifting, social justice, and personal finance. Most importantly, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two sons.\n\nMiddle and Upper School Science Teacher\n\n14 Years of Service\n\nI believe that technology is the cultural touchstone of our generation; therefore, it is exciting to be teaching in a school that actively supports the use of technology in the classroom. I’ve been teaching for over 20 years and amazed at how quickly the technology used in classroom has evolved. I can still remember ditto machines and when the term carbon copy meant an actual blue colored carbon copy. I’d like to believe that as technology, I have evolved as an educator. Having been fortunate to teach in schools located in Central America, the Northeast, and Southeast regions afforded me opportunities to build upon my repertoire of teaching strategies and keep pace with trending pedagogies. My professional growth continues at Providence Day School.\n\nExtended Day\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nExtended Day\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nMiddle School Clubhouse\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nMiddle School Clubhouse\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nUpper School Theatre Director\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nI am honored to serve Providence Day School as the Upper School Theatre Director. Prior to this position, I served as the Lower School Theatre Director for six years, in an after-school capacity. I have a B.F.A in Theatre from Auburn University and a M.F.A. from the University of Southern Mississippi. I taught in Charlotte Mecklenburg schools for 17 years. I own a small business called CreativeKids, which is a large vendor at Providence Day in Summer Programs. I have two amazing children, Harper 12 and Miles 9, who are the center of my universe. When I'm not in the classroom or at rehearsal, I love being outdoors, taking a yoga class, going to live arts events, and spending time with friends and family.\n\nUpper School Mathematics Teacher\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nUpper School Mathematics Teacher\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nFacilities\n\n16 Years of Service\n\nFacilities\n\n16 Years of Service\n\nExtended Day Teacher\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nI joined extended day second semester last school year, because I graduated from PD a semester early. It was weird coming back from winter break as an employee, and even weirder to wave to my friends while I walked through the halls with my students. However, this job is the perfect fit, because I get to do what I love while studying at UNC Charlotte to get my teaching license.\n\nI’ve wanted to be a teacher ever since I was a little kid, because it seemed like a fun job. As I grew older and gained experience, I’ve seen how big of an impact I have on every student I come into contact with. I’m often the first person they run to when they’re feeling upset, lonely, or just need a break. And It warms my heart to see them go from crying to laughing in a matter of minutes after hanging out with me for a little bit.\n\nI’m excited for the next few years, as I continue to make connections with all of my students!\n\nHuman Resources Generalist\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nAssistant Director of Admissions\n\n21 Years of Service\n\nAssistant Director of Admissions\n\n21 Years of Service\n\nTo learn more about the Admissions team, click here: https://www.providenceday.org/admissions\n\nAthletics Trainer\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nAthletics Trainer\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nLower School Teacher, TK and K Learning Loft Facilitator\n\n8 Years of Service\n\nI attended Providence Day from TK through 12th grade, and I am beyond excited to be reunited with my PDS family as the TK and K Learning Loft Facilitator.

In 2006, I came to Providence Day, and after some time off spent at home with my children, I'm happy to be back in the classroom where I can share my love of problem-solving, proof-writing, and logical thinking with my students. Outside the classroom, I appreciate spending time with my family, enjoying local foods (especially from my own garden), experimenting with fermentation, and reading. I've discovered some of my favorite books through student recommendations, so let me know if you've read any good books lately!\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n14 Years of Service\n\nIn my early twenties after a backpacking trip through Western Europe, I realized the memories I made were more enduring than the souvenirs I excitedly purchased. The desire to make great memories for myself and my family has inspired me to do rather than to collect, and to learn from my experiences regardless of whether they are exhilarating or heartbreaking. I take my greatest pleasure in quality time spent with my favorite children and adults. It also helps me to remember that connections and relationships are as important as facts and figures.\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n15 Years of Service\n\nUpper School Mathematics Teacher\n\n7 Years of Service\n\nI am thrilled to be teaching at PD! I've enjoyed working in the math department as well as with the SOS clubs throughout the Upper School. I have two wonderful children who attend PD - Andrew (middle school) and Abby (lower school).\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy watching the San Diego Chargers football team (I refuse to acknowledge them as the LA Chargers) and the Mets baseball team. I travel as much as I can with my two children in tow, mostly to the mountains for hiking, and I love to be involved with service projects. As a hockey family, many of my weekends are spent in a cold rink somewhere.\n\nAssistant Athletic Director & Head Football Coach\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nCoach Grier enters his fourth season at Providence Day after leading the Chargers to back-to-back NCISAA Division 1 State Championships in 2021 and 2022.\n\nCoach Grier’s overall record is 115-22 in 12 seasons with six state championships, one state runner up, and three state semi-final appearances. He began his career at Davidson Day, where he started the program from scratch and went 64-9 with four state titles in six years. Grier then took over at Oceanside Collegiate Academy in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, where he served as head coach and athletic director. Prior to his arrival at Oceanside, the Landsharks had never won a game. In 3 years, Grier led Oceanside to a 27-7 record, a regional championship, two playoff berths and an appearance in the Lower State Championship Game (state semi-finals). Grier took over the PD program in the spring of 2020 and led the Chargers to a 4-2 mark, the Big South Conference Championship and an appearance in the state-semi-finals in the Covid-shortened season. That was the first time PD had ever beaten each of its three Charlotte rivals in the same regular season. In 2021, the Chargers again swept its local conference rivals in winning their second straight Big South title, earned the #1 seed in the Division 1 playoffs and finished the season with their first state championship since 2011. In 2002, the Chargers again won the state championship, became nationally ranked for the first time in school history, and finished first in the Charlotte Observer Sweet 16.\n\nGrier’s ability to develop student-athletes is best reflected in nearly 90 of his players moving on to play at the collegiate level including several in the SEC, ACC, Big 12, Ivy League, and Service Academies (Army and Navy). Grier specializes in teaching quarterbacks (QB). His son Will played QB for his first Davidson Day teams where he was the two-time N.C. Gatorade Player of the Year, a three-time all-american and the national high school player of the year. Will had an outstanding college career at Florida and West Virginia, where he finished fourth in the Heisman voting before being drafted in the third round by the Carolina Panthers. Currently, Will plays for the Dallas Cowboys. Another of Grier’s QBs was Sam Hartman, who owns the record for most touchdown passes in ACC history. His current QB, Jadyn Davis, is the 2022 N.C. Gatorade Player of the Year, N.C. Mr. Football and the N.C. Preps State Player of the Year. In his 12 years as a head coach, each of his starting QBs has been named All-Conference, All-State and/or All-American, and each has gone on to play college football (Florida/West Virginia, Furman, Wake Forest, Drake, South Carolina, and East Carolina).\n\nGrier graduated from Charlotte Latin and then played quarterback at both University of Richmond and East Carolina where he learned under some of the best football minds in the game including Kevin Gilbride, Mark Richt, and Steve Logan. While starting a family in Charlotte and working in business, he earned his MBA from Queens University. He started coaching as a passion hobby in the 90s at numerous camps and as an assistant coach at Western Guilford High School, Charlotte Latin, and SouthLake Christian before taking on his first head coaching position at Davidson Day in 2010. It wasn’t until Grier took the job at Oceanside that he became a full-time coach. He has served in numerous all-star games including assistant coach in the 2015 Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas, head coach of the 2016 Adidas Freshman All-American Bowl in Naples, F.L., head coach in the 2017 Army All-American Bowl, and head coach of the 2022 Carolina Bowl.\n\nCoach Grier is a Charlotte native. He has been married to his wife Nila for 14 years and is the father of four sons, Will (27), Nash (25), Hayes (22), and Hank (3).\n\nUpper School English Teacher\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nUpper School English Teacher\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nUpper School Counselor\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nClaire Bell is one of the Upper School Counselors at Providence Day School. Claire is a National Certified Counselor, and she is licensed in North Carolina as a Professional School Counselor. With professional experience in leadership development and school counseling, Claire is passionate about supporting students as they navigate high school. Outside of school, Claire enjoys spending time with her husband, David, her daughter, Bennett, her son, Charlie, and two hound mixes, Princeton and Beale. In addition to spending time with family and friends, Claire gets very excited about hot sauce, online shopping, chips and dip, and, obviously, counseling students!\n\nHead of School Administrative Assistant\n\n14 Years of Service\n\nHead of School Administrative Assistant\n\n14 Years of Service\n\nStudent Billing, Financial Aid, and Accounting Director\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nUpper School English Teacher\n\n23.5 Years of Service\n\nI have been attacked by an owl on four occasions, while running, in two different Charlotte neighborhoods, over an eight-year span. I believe they were not the same owl.\n\nBizarre owl behavior notwithstanding, I run to stay in shape. Although I listen to a lot of music—mainly Bach’s sacred choral works—I don’t wear ear buds while I run. I just let my mind roam. On my weekend pre-dawn 10-milers, I might be revisiting moments from favorite novels—Mark Helperin’s A Soldier of the Great War, Patrick O’Brian’s Aubrey-Maturin series, anything by Walker Percy. I might silently recite a favorite memorized poem by Hopkins or Larkin. I’ll anticipate watching my favorite sport, soccer, on TV when I get home.\n\nSoccer was rarely mentioned in my North Carolina small town when I grew up in the 1970s and ‘80s. I knew nothing about the game—beyond the obvious—when I went to college at Chapel Hill. This ignorance continued at Florida State, where I did a master’s degree in English (writing a thesis on Milton’s Paradise Lost), and at the U. of Kansas, where I studied the history of the language and wrote a Ph.D. dissertation on risible distortions of the historical record in certain plays by Shakespeare and some of his contemporaries.\n\nMy son, a Providence Day alumnus, plays soccer at Centre College in Kentucky, where he majors in physics yet also reads novels. (N.b. to parents: his favorite subjects at PD were all humanities. His Spanish proficiency earned him an annual scholarship at Centre. So his talent for and dedication toward calculus and physics in college took us by surprise.) My wife is a swimmer, a gardener, a licensed psychologist. She and I have lived in Charlotte’s Plaza Midwood neighborhood since 1998, also the year I accepted a teaching position at PD. Starting in 2005, we’ve continued to be active members of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church.\n\nIn addition to teaching writing and literary appreciation via analysis, I chaired the English department from 2005-22. I ran Charger House, where students, colleagues, and I provided meals and shelter on campus for up to twelve homeless women, every winter between 2009-20. And for many years I also advised the editors and staff of our award-winning Upper School literary magazine, Pendragon. I was named Upper School Teacher of the Year in 2014. The courses I most frequently teach include AP English Literature, English II, Creative Writing, Shakespeare, and Writing Seminar.\n\nMiddle School English Teacher\n\n15 Years of Service\n\nI remember sitting in my own 8th grade English class long ago working on my first significant writing assignment. At that moment, I decided that teaching would be my life-long career. Now in my 25th year of teaching, I remain passionate about teaching this level. It's the energy, the vulnerability, the joy, and the tears. Middle school classrooms are part chaos and laughter, and for this level, I find that learning requires interaction, flexibility, patience, and balance. You could not pay me to move to a different career.I have a Master's Degree from Northern Arizona University and a bachelor's degree in secondary education from Arizona State University.\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n5 Years of Service\n\nI am so excited to be starting my sixth year as an assistant teacher in Lower School. I am originally from Morganton, NC, and studied speech pathology at Appalachian State University (Go Mountaineers!). For the last eleven years, I’ve worked as a pediatric speech language pathologist here in Charlotte. I have a love for children and helping them learn in their own unique ways. In my free time, you can find me spending time with my family and friends, being outside, or scheming up a new design project at my house.\n\nMiddle School Librarian\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nMiddle School Librarian\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nI love spending my days as the Middle School Librarian at Providence Day School!\n\nI'm originally from Rock Hill, SC, and I've also lived in Elkhart, IN, Asheville, NC, and Boone, NC. I graduated from Appalachian State in 2008, and I love to visit the mountains in Boone and Asheville when I get the chance. I recently completed my Masters in Library and Information Science via the University of Alabama.\n\nIn my free time I like to read, draw, play music, and spend time with my family.\n\nUpper School Mathematics Teacher & Freshman Class Dean\n\n9 Years of Service\n\nAfter graduating from Providence Day School myself in 2006, I attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. There, I earned a B.A. in English and Economics with a minor in Mathematics and became a die-hard Tar Heel fan! I then began my teaching career in Memphis, Tennessee where I taught high school math through the Teach for America program. At Providence Day, I have taught courses ranging from Algebra II to AP Calculus AB. I love math and it is my goal each year to inspire all of my students to love it as well. Outside of the classroom, I am the senior class dean and I advise the Big Brother Big Sister Club. I have a master’s degree in Secondary Mathematics at UNCC. When I am not at school, you can often find me spending time with my husband Corey, and daughters Eleanor and Amelia, running, practicing aerial silks, reading, or spending time outside!\n\nFootball Coach & Upper School Study Hall\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nFootball Coach & Upper School Study Hall\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nUpper School Mathematics Teacher\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nI have taken a long, strange journey to teaching math at Providence Day, but I believe the things I have done have led me right to where I belong. After growing up in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, I attended the University of Missouri (MIZ - ZOU!) and earned a Bachelor's of Journalism. I took a job at ESPN in the Statistics and Analytics Department, where a love of numbers came rushing back to me. I decided to move to Chicago, where I still wrote for the Chicago Tribune, but started coaching high school sports (baseball and basketball) while pursuing a Master's in Education at DePaul University. Upon graduating in 2012, I accepted a job at Providence Day and haven't looked back. Here at PD, I teach Algebra I, Accelerated Algebra II and SAT Prep. Outside of the classroom, I am the Associate Head Coach of the varsity baseball team, advise the Charger Asset Management Board and run No Shave November. Outside of school, I love traveling to see friends and family all over the country, running to stay in shape, playing golf and lounging at the house with my wife, dog and baby girl.\n\nFacilities\n\n5 Years of Service\n\nPayroll and Benefits Administrator\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nPayroll and Benefits Administrator\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nFacilities, Campus Events\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nFacilities, Campus Events\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nMiddle School English Teacher\n\nMiddle School EIB Coordinator\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nTeaching was not my first career choice. After graduating from Syracuse University with an MA in International Relations, I had hopes of being in the Foreign Service, but I wound up working as a travel representative in Cancún, Mexico, and eventually after a stint at Sears Roebuck decided to become a teacher, following in the footsteps of my mother, aunt, and three uncles. I began my teaching career in Chicago Public Schools, and later at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Francis Parker and Catherine Cook Schools in Chicago, before coming to Providence Day.\n\nI have a passion for teaching and particularly history. In my spare time I enjoy cooking and working on my family tree. In addition, I love spending time with my spouse, family and friends, traveling, and watching my beloved White Sox.

Providence Day School has shaped and molded me into the person I am today. I'm what we call, a \"lifer,\" here at school. I grew up living and breathing PDS and I still believe that this school represents the best in education and my extended family. Finding my passion for learning here at school, extended into college in Atlanta, graduate school in Washington, DC, and living overseas in Australia. When not in the halls of PD, you can find me with my own kiddos, Addison (19), Noah (17) and Austen (15). I strongly believe that we are always learning regardless of our age and I believe that we should always always choose kindness.\n\nLower School Administrative Assistant\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nLower School Administrative Assistant\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nFacilities\n\n8 Years of Service\n\nFacilities\n\n8 Years of Service\n\nMiddle and Upper School Science Teacher\n\n30 Years of Service\n\nMr. Burgess started teaching at PDS in 1992 after six years in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System.

Eventually attending Duke University, where I majored in music and theater arts with a strategic framework in service learning, I have come to be a passionate advocate for leveraging the benefits of the arts in all learning spaces for children.\n\nI am so happy to be back at Providence Day in the third grade, where we use songs, movement, games, tons of rich texts and literature, and our active imaginations to bring student discoveries to life, all the whilst using our artistic toolbox to regulate our emotions, express ourselves in healthy ways as we build new friendships, and find mindful moments during a busy academic year. PDS is family, and I am honored to have been a part of it for so long and to have new members of my classroom family each year! Go Chargers!\n\nMiddle School Mathematics Teacher\n\n.5 Years of Service\n\nAfter graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Education from UNC Chapel Hill, I moved to Charlotte to begin my teaching career in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools. Charlotte has since become home and I am now entering my 8th year teaching middle school math. I love being part of a school community and working with middle school students.\n\nWhen I am not in the classroom, I enjoy traveling, trying new restaurants, cheering on the Tar Heels and Panthers, and hanging out with my dog, Tucker. I am so excited to be a part of the Providence Day community!\n\nFacilities\n\nFacilities\n\nDirector of Lower School Learning Initiatives\n\n20 Years of Service\n\nMy name is Elisa Clark and I grew up in Winston-Salem, NC. I graduated from Meredith College in Raleigh, NC with a BS in Early Childhood Development and a K-6 teaching certificate. After college, I taught 2nd grade, 1st grade, and Kindergarten in High Point, NC. In 1997, I moved to Charlotte with my husband, Gray. I found Providence Day School in 1998 and have been working here in many different capacities ever since. During my time at PDS, I have had the privilege of working in Summer Programs, Extended Day, Admissions, Kindergarten, and First Grade.\n\nMy husband, Gray, and I have two daughters, Cathryn and Elisabeth, who bring much joy into our lives. We also have “two four-legged boys,” Alvin and Theodore, who complete our family. Outside of school, my family enjoys trips to Sunset Beach with my extended family.

Before I began teaching, I worked in the outdoor industry, serving as the Admissions Director for Moondance Adventures and spending my previous summers at Camp Merrie-Woode. I believe deeply in the power of experiential education and hope to elevate these opportunities with my students as much as I can. When I'm not at school you can find me outside running with my dog, sitting on my back porch with a cup of coffee, or spending time with my family.\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nI am happy to be a part of the Providence Day family and feel blessed to work at such a wonderful place. I started here as a parent. Both of my children have attended Providence Day, one of which graduated in 2013. I was a substitute teacher for several years and when an opening became available in kindergarten I knew it would be the perfect fit. I have a Bachelors degree in Early Childhood Education (K-6) from UNCC. My favorite part of being an assistant is getting to know each and every child in my class and learning how to make their day the best it can be. I learn their interests, what makes them happy and more importantly what makes them sad and anxious. I want every day to be as productive and happy as possible, and I work hard to assure this is possible for each child. Outside of school I enjoy gardening, walking my dog, reading and trying new recipes.\n\nTeaching Assistant\n\n2 Years of Service\n\nUpper School History Teacher\n\n7 Years of Service\n\nUpper School History Teacher\n\n7 Years of Service\n\nHello!

Fluency in French and Spanish and a hearty knowledge of German and Latin has opened many doors for me in my career and in my life. I credit my multilingual grandparents for introducing me to languages at a young age and for always encouraging my language learning. The very first trip I took abroad was with my grandmother who brought me to her hometown of St. Junien, France to relive our family history and to absorb the French culture and language. It was an experience that changed my life and sparked my love of languages. Each day, I love coming to work to model my enthusiasm and passion for languages with my students. My classroom is my stage and is a warm, inviting, and fun place to be. It is important for me to not only teach the aspects of languages, but to infuse life skills and personal growth into my lessons. I pride myself on creating a community atmosphere in my classroom. Also, student travel is key for me as a teacher, as well as for the students, so I continue to lead student trips to experience real life language learning with my students on location around the world. It is extremely rewarding to watch them piece together concepts that we had learned in the classroom as they put them into practice in another culture. It was an honor to watch my own son grow up at Providence Day and to see him flourish as an individual and a language student. I am grateful for the many professional development opportunities, resources, and freedom to be creative and inspiring to my students here at Providence Day. I look forward to many more years of generating excitement and enthusiasm for languages and travel with my students. Long live languages!

I have considerable experience teaching students of various age groups and levels internationally in both the UK and the USA, more precisely in North Carolina where I was a middle school teacher, and in Hilton Head, South Carolina, where I taught high school students. The reason I am attracted to America goes beyond curriculum. I greatly admire the country's creative innovation, culture, ideals, and history; so much so that I was eager to return to the USA in 2014 to learn more about the country's rich diversity, taste new experiences, and become more immersed in America’s unique culture. Outside of school, I enjoy reading Agatha Christie's novels, cultural and music festivals, as well as discovering other countries.

I found this at Providence Day as they too embrace this vision! One of my goals as a teacher is to instill a passion for lifelong learning in my students. Hopefully, something we talk about in the classroom will ignite a spark in them! I also think it is extremely important to develop a strong rapport with my students. We work hard in our class to develop a strong community and safe work environment. I am blessed to be the mom of two boys. My family enjoys watching collegiate sports of all kinds, especially football in the fall. As a graduate of the University of Tennessee, I am a huge Tennessee Volunteer fan! I also enjoy reading, cooking, and spending time on the lake and at the beach.\n\nLower School Chinese Teacher\n\n11 Years of Service\n\nMy name is Hsiu-Chen Chen. I have gone by Nina Chen since I moved to the States. I hold a master's degree in Education. I started teaching in elementary school right after graduating from the teacher college in Taiwan. I taught the Chinese language Immersion school at CMS prior to joining PDS. My two boys also attend PDS. This is my 11th year at PDS. I love the work environment at PDS and my kids also like the school. PDS is like another big family to us. I enjoy practicing yoga and walking during my leisure time.\n\nUpper School English Teacher\n\n22 Years of Service\n\nIt started with a goat. Every afternoon the summer I was nine, Sunshine and I meandered around the scruffy grounds of Camp Anawana, exploring nature, observing laughter, taking in the day. And folks baaahh-ed when we moseyed by. By the time I entered Cornell, I believed myself to be the incarnation of Walt Whitman—“I am…a cosmos, of Manhattan the son”—which somehow translated into roaming around campus each afternoon during “frolic time,” rooooaaaaring gleefully at folks, bathing occasionally, and attempting to convince my peers of the positive aspects of the word “smelly.” With Levis rolled up to my knees and days of grime stewing, I found my calling: to irrigate Africa—yes, the entire continent. Though when that calling failed after taking a geology class for eight hours a day over the entire summer—I ended up attempting to bury rock outcrops so that there would be less to study—I stumbled upon what has ended up being my intellectual whey powder: the humanities. From gulping down everything from the paintings of Gericault and Delacroix to the words of Dickinson and Balsac (I know, funny), I became a lover of nineteenth century culture. I felt moved by the humanity I witnessed—by the inner-connectedness we all share. After spending some six months backpacking through Europe after university, a quest both to visit the works that moved me in my art history classes and to unearth my vocational calling, I decided to become a teacher. And I’ve been lucky to find a husband—Steven--who’s okay with me getting lost in the garden for hours upon hours each week-end, who shares my beliefs in social justice, who condemns my Fresca addiction, and who tolerates my playful antics. (For the past two days, I’ve been on a kick to send Shaving Cream—our Old English Sheepdog—to the Sylvan Learning Center so that he can improve his reading skills.) Yup, he’s one patient man. It has been years since I’ve been called Uncle Walt. But much of his spirit still guides me. Each day, I find myself roaming here nor there, attempting to connect with those around me through silliness and laughter and happy noises—the roooooaaarrr most recently has morphed to an OWWWWWWWWW. I know, ridiculous. For the past twenty years, through teaching art history, writing, literature, and social justice, I’ve encouraged students to find their voices, to see the world through different lenses, to explore our shared humanness. I continue to revel in the world around me. I thank the stars that I have such wonderful students who inspire me. And I look forward to finding something beautiful about each day.\n\nSchool Nurse\n\n1 Year of Service\n\nI was born in New Jersey after my parents immigrated from Norway. We moved to Charlotte when I was in high school and graduated from Providence Day (a long time ago). I went to Appalachian State followed by Mercy School of Nursing. I was a Labor and Delivery Nurse for 16 years at Atrium Health before joining One Day Surgery for 4 years. I am so happy to be back at Providence Day School. It is truly is a full circle moment for me. I am married and have three boys.

I have a passion for helping athletes get back on the field and making sure they are safe and supported while participating in sports.\n\nI love the high school age students and am looking forward to building new and lasting relationships in this community. When I'm not at work I am hanging out with my two dogs, traveling to new places, doing DIY projects around the house, or spending time with friends and family.\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nGrowing up I always knew that I wanted to be a teacher! After receiving my BA in Elementary Education from Clemson University, I began my work with young children and have been at it for over 20 years.I also received my Master of Science in Religious Studies from Fordham University in 2007. I am blessed to be a teacher at Providence Day School and excited to be a part of helping fifth grade students fulfill their potential and grow as a person and a student.

My first sense of identity was pieced together from the amalgamation of conversations about military, medical, agricultural, athletic, economic, and artistic pursuits, which still anchor my sense of self. Academically, I've earned degrees from the University of Georgia (BA and MA) and the University of South Carolina (PhD). Despite the joy I found while teaching in college classrooms for over a decade, I found my true calling in helping TK-12 students become more fulfilling versions of themselves via literature, social entrepreneurship, and innovation. I am elated to continue my journey of self improvement at PD and hope I can help my colleagues and students do the same.

No matter what you are good at: dancing, singing, painting, designing, organizing, building.. there is a place for you in the theatre. It is a joy for me to help students discover where their talents lie and how they can effectively use those talents to contribute to the art of mounting a production. I became active in theatre in college and I have been teaching, directing, or performing in some capacity ever since. I earned an MFA in 2003 and I have enjoyed working in a variety of capacities and venues including outdoor dramas, educational tours, dinner theatre, and children's theatre. My daughter Monica is a Middle School student at PDS and part of the joy of my day is traveling to and from school with her, or seeing her on campus. I love to travel, crochet, decorate cakes, and bake with my daughter. I like to read and I love my pets. I am a West Virginia girl, so I feel most at home when I am close to the mountains. I am happy to be in Charlotte doing what I love each day for Providence Day School!\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n22 Years of Service\n\nI love teaching at Providence Day School! It truly is my \"home away from home.\" After moving to Charlotte in 2000, I joined the 4th grade team and met my wife, a 2nd grade teacher and PD alumna. 14 years later, I am thrilled that both of our children are now Chargers! As an educator, Providence Day is the most amazing place to work! Being a part of an all inclusive campus, I am constantly interacting with former students in the halls. It is such an unique and rewarding experience to watch them grow up right before my eyes! One of my favorite days of the school year is Commencement, when I have the privilege of seeing them begin their adult lives. When I'm not teaching in the classroom, I'm coaching on the lacrosse field. I always joke that I'm usually either wearing a tie or a whistle. I direct several area youth lacrosse organizations and leagues including the summer camps at Providence Day School. My love of lacrosse began as a child growing up in Syracuse, NY, and I'm thrilled to help spread the excitement of lacrosse down here in the south!\n\nAssociate Director, Office of Equity, Inclusion, & Belonging\n\n2 Years of Service\n\nI am a New York native (the Bronx originally and later Upstate.)

I hail from a family of educators as my mother served as a community college administrator and my father served as a college professor. My family is from Nevis. A small island in the Caribbean where Alexander Hamilton was born. I have dual citizenship--the United States and St. Kitts & Nevis. Prior to joining the PD community, I worked in admissions and student affairs at the collegiate level as well as on a 2020 Presidential Campaign. I have lived in several cities in New York and Indiana as well as Boston and Las Vegas. I moved to Charlotte for my role at Providence Day School and I am grateful to be a part of this lovely community and to call this wonderful city home, now! I enjoy international travel, getting creative in the kitchen, nature walks, true crime docuseries and podcasts, spending time with family and friends (especially with my nephews, nieces and twin toddler Goddaughters) and taking care of my plants.\n\nExtended Day Teacher\n\n23 Years of Service\n\nI currently work at Extended Day with 3-5 graders afterschool. I am known as “The Queen of Fun!\"\n\nI love playing games with the kids and getting to know them and having fun whether we’re playing a game of kickball or four square or a game of Blokus!! I learned a new card game this summer and can’t wait to teach them that too!!!\n\nDuring the summers you’ll find me at PDS summer camps where I have 4 different camps like Minute to Win It, Game\n\nDuring the day before I come to Extended Day I’m very busy with my cookie business, Jolly Elf Holiday Cookies. My twin sister and I work together and bake at night and in the mornings. That’s a passion of mine too and if you’ve never had our cookies, you need to!!! They are truly heavenly!!!! We specialize in sugar cookies but our nuggets and chocolate chip are very popular too!!!!\n\nIn my spare time, I love to cook and travel and visit my 2 grandchildren and spend time with my 3 children. My youngest is a senior this year and plays football.\n\nLower School Librarian\n\n15 Years of Service\n\nBorrowing from Jorge Loius Borges on his \"heaven is a kind of library\" quote, I would have to say that working in a library at PDS is definitely one of those \"kinds\". Our physical building and number of resources are absolutely enviable. That I get to work here and bring books to kids (easier than bringing that horse to water for sure!) is just icing on the heavenly chocolate pudding. I started working in libraries in high school and college and decided to just keep going and get my Master's in Library Science too. I love reading, I love all varieties of kids and I love bringing stories to life. At home, I love reading, I love my family, I love my absurd number of pets and I love being outside with nature and inside with my crafts.\n\nLower School Physical Education & Extended Day Teaching Assistant\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nLower School and Extended Day Teaching Assistant\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nMiddle and Upper School World Language Teacher\n\n20 Years of Service\n\nAfter graduating from Davidson College in 1989, I've taught in New York, Virginia, Mexico, Vermont, and sometimes it's hard to believe we've been at PD since 2003! Shea and I married in 2000, and our daughters are proud lifers! We're ready for the next phase as Libby starts the 10th grade and Sophie heads off to Furman. Outside of the classroom, I love to sing and play music with the PDaddies.\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n26 Years of Service\n\nComing from a family of educators, teaching has always been very important to me. My love of learning and desire for helping others, led me to pursue a career as a teacher. I am a graduate of UNC Charlotte with a BA in Elementary Education. I love working with my students and finding creative ways to engage and spark their desire to learn. I joined the faculty at Providence Day School in 1997 and I have been teaching in Second Grade for 26 years. I feel honored to work at a school where there is a total commitment to educational excellence and character development for all students. Prior to my teaching career, I traveled as a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines. During that time, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit many interesting and amazing places around the world.\n\nI earned my Global Educator’s diploma at PDS and traveled with World View to Senegal, West Africa and chaperoned a student trip to South Africa. My family and I absolutely have enjoyed being a part of the PDS community. My daughter Jenny graduated from PDS (’08) and middle son, Sydney (’09). My youngest son, Wesley attended PDS from TK to MS and graduated from Providence HS (’14). We have a lovable and frisky cat named JoJo, who loves to climb and take naps. When I am not teaching in my classroom, you can probably find me on the tennis courts. I enjoy participating in USTA leagues and being the captain of many teams in the Charlotte area.\n\n“The world is the true classroom. The most rewarding and important type of learning is through experience, seeing something with our own eyes.” – author unknown.\n\nLibrarian Circulation Assistant\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nLibrarian Circulation Assistant\n\n4 Years of Service\n\nAssociate Head of School for Institutional Advancement\n\n11 Years of Service\n\nAssociate Head of School for Institutional Advancement\n\n11 Years of Service\n\nTo learn more about Jeff Appel, click here: https://www.providenceday.org/about/school-leadership\n\nLower School Physical Education Teacher\n\n16 Years of Service\n\nThis is my 10th full year teaching and coaching at Providence Day. After graduating from Middlebury College in 1983 I was a player/lacrosse coach in Perth, Australia and then an assistant lacrosse coach at Denison University. After two years as a graduate assistant lacrosse coach at the Univ. of Massachusetts I was named the head lacrosse and assistant soccer coach at the Univ. of Vermont for 11 years. Previous to coming to Charlotte I spent seven years as a middle school P.E. teacher, soccer and golf coach at Bosque School in Albuquerque, NM.\n\nUpper School History & Social Studies Teacher\n\n9 Years of Service\n\nAfter nearly twelve years of teaching at the college level, I made the transition to teach fulltime at Providence Day School beginning in 2013. Every day at PDS reaffirms my decision to work with our Upper School students and the entire PDS Community. On any given day at PDS I can find myself discussing the merits of the Progressive reformers, facilitating a simulation on the Federal Election Commission, assisting with a student designed community-wide voter registration drive, being recruited to assist a student in his elaborate plan to ask a classmate to Homecoming, supporting a student-led initiative to eliminate food deserts, working out (poorly) with the girls Lacrosse team, moderating a practice round with the Academic World Quest team, arguing with my advisees over who would win in a fight: Superman or the Hulk, and all of this before noon! I am excited to find a school that welcomes innovation, creativity, and embraces the “mindful student” as well as the “busy-minded” student! I am among the future rock stars of industries not yet invented! I am seeing history happen every day at PDS and it excites this historian right here!\n\nUpper School History & Social Studies Teacher\n\n9 Years of Service\n\nI am privileged to teach AP Human Geography.

I cannot wait to work with this dynamic group of young people. I also am the proud parent of three beautiful daughters. My children have taught me tremendous amounts about joy, laughter, patience, flexibility, and of course humility. Although having three children can be very hectic, I believe it makes me the educator that I am today. It is such an honor not only to help students grow intellectually, but also as individuals. Our students at Providence Day are kind, funny, helpful, hard working, and incredibly intelligent. It is my gift to not only teach, but also learn from each of them. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my children, serving at my church, and participating in Crossfit.\n\nUpper School Science Teacher\n\n7 Years of Service\n\nMy goal is to inspire in students a passion for physics and lifelong learning.\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n1 Year of Service\n\nMiddle School World Language Teacher\n\nMiddle School EIB Coordinator\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nAssociate Director of Admissions\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nAssociate Director of Admissions\n\n3 Years of Service\n\nTo learn more about the Admissions team, click here: https://www.providenceday.org/admissions\n\nTeaching and spending time in school is a family tradition and the school campus always feels like home to me.

I moved to Charlotte after graduate school and I absolutely love it here. I met my husband, Andy in the Queen City. We have three children, Lia, Jake, and Sydney who are all Chargers. I knew at a young age that I wanted to be a teacher and work in the field of education. Over the last twenty years I have been a special education teacher, a school psychologist, a school counselor, and a college professor. I love school and learning! I was thrilled to join the Providence Day Community in 2016. Providence Day is the most welcoming and caring school community that I have been a part of! I look forward to coming to Lower School every day and working with our fantastic teachers, students, and parents!\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n6 Years of Service\n\nLower School Counselor\n\n2 Years of Service\n\nJenny is one of the Lower School Counselors at Providence Day School.

In my free time, I enjoy doing puzzles, reading and traveling.\n\nLower School Teacher\n\n5 Years of Service\n\nI’m originally from Dayton, Ohio and attended The Ohio State University for college. I taught first grade in Ohio for a few years before moving to Charlotte. I taught several years in public school in Charlotte before taking some time off to stay home with my 2 sons. When they were both in school I knew it was time to go back and pursue my passion for teaching. I spent a few more years in public school before I made the switch over to Providence Day. I feel so lucky to have found such an amazing place to continue teaching.\n\nUpper School Science Department Chair & Teacher\n\n10 Years of Service\n\nI joined the Providence Day School faculty in 2012. Prior to moving to Charlotte with my wife and two daughters, I taught at Collegiate School in Richmond, Virginia for 11 years.

Following high school, I attended the University of Notre Dame, where I graduated with a degree in psychology in 2002. After college, I resided in Iowa City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, where I worked in various non-profit organizations as a counselor for at-risk adolescents before settling in Charlotte in 2006.\n\nI believe that psychology is a wonderful subject for young people to study. It is applicable to so many areas of daily life, and it provides a venue for discussion about what it means to be human, just as high school students are moving through a particularly formative period of their development.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, woodworking, gardening, and watching far more television than is good for me. I am also a loyal Chicago Cubs fan who after the World Series win spends most of his time shuffling about looking for purpose in life.\n\nUpper School History & Social Studies Teacher\n\n13 Years of Service\n\nPeople often describe the Providence Day community as a 'family'. It is a school that is full of wonderful people who care deeply about all of those around them. This statement takes on further meaning for me. Providence Day was my home for most of the most formative years of my life. As both the son of a faculty member (first grade teacher Joanne Compton) and a 'Lifer', I was more or less raised here. I started here in TK and graduated from PD in 2004, and I can attribute many of my interests today to my time at Providence Day as a student. I did my undergraduate work in History at Wake Forest University, then continued my education at Wake and earned my MAEd in Secondary Social Studies Education. In addition to my love of history, I was also able to pursue my passion for running as I had the opportunity to run track and cross country at Wake Forest. I graduated from the Masters program in the summer of 2009 and moved back to Charlotte to begin my teaching career. I started off teaching Civics, Comparative Government, and History of the 1960s, but have since transitioned into a more Global role as I continue to teach Global Civics and Comparative Government, but have also added Global Studies: East and Southeast Asia and Global Studies: Middle East and North Africa to my repertoire. In addition to teaching, I have served as the Chair of the Honor Council since the Fall of 2023 after serving as a Faculty member from 2010-2023. In the fall I work with the varsity cross-country team along with my former coach Ben Hovis, and in the spring I work with the middle school boys track team along with my former coach Bill Gallagher. I have earned my Global Educator's Certificate. This has allowed me to pursue my love of traveling. In the past few years I have traveled to China, Cambodia, and Germany through PDS. When I'm not at school, you can most often find me on the trails or on the roads continuing my love of running. My wife and I welcomed our son Oliver in the fall of 2022! I also love to travel, read, and spend time with friends. Providence Day helped me to become the individual that I am today, and I am honored to be back here as an educator.\n\nUpper School Physical Education Teacher, Trainer and Science Teacher\n\n31 Years of Service\n\nI have been working at Providence Day since 1991 as a teacher and athletic trainer.

I began my career as a Teach For America corps member, and TFA's mission still sticks with me: I believe that all children deserve an excellent education. One reason I love teaching at Providence Day is because we are actively connected to the needs of our Charlotte community. Outside the English Department, I am the Freshman & Sophomore Grade Level Dean, and I serve on the Honor Council. I feel lucky to do two of my favorite things at my job: teach English and serve a city that has given me so much. When I am not at PD, you can find me spending time with my husband Jason and our two children, likely on a local greenway or hiking trail.\n\nUpper School Performing Arts Teacher\n\n7 Years of Service\n\nJordan is a North Carolina native actor who has worked professionally, acting and designing, in the theatre throughout the country.

It is a goal for me to help steer them to develop the skills and knowledge basis to become mature, informed, and active members of society. I have been at PD since the fall of 2007, where I have taught a variety of science courses. I am thrilled that I can share this wonderful school with my family and have my children attend the Lower and Middle school each day. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, gardening, organically growing crops, spending quality time with my family, and of course a good movie in the evening to unwind from the busy day.\n\nHead Girls' Varsity Basketball Coach, Middle and Upper School Physical Education Teacher\n\n15 Years of Service\n\nJosh Springer, native of Appleton, WI, was named Head Varsity Girls Basketball Coach at Providence Day School on July 4th, 2007.

Go Badgers and Packers!\n\nLower School, Middle School and Upper School Student Services Director\n\n26 Years of Service\n\nLooking back at my childhood, there is no surprise that I became a teacher. I was the oldest of seven, and the only girl. Since my mother had her hands full working a full-time job, I became the conductor of our family orchestra making sure daily tasks were completed at the right time and in the right way. To this day, my brothers still tell stories of their big sister organizing the household and helping them manage their daily activities. Of course there are also stories of when I chased them out the front door with a broom because they were being less than cooperative, but no one should believe everything they hear! My brother, Jack was born with Down’s Syndrome. Jack taught me about patience and that learning new skills can take lots of practice. Growing up with Jack led me to majoring in special education. Being a special education major gave me endless opportunities for learning and practicing methodology for teaching “all kinds of minds.” Teaching gave me great joy and permitted me to see the world through the creative eyes of children. Teaching also gave me opportunities to celebrate accomplishments with my students, accomplishments that often times were the result of lots of practice and consistent hard work. Teaching at Providence Day has provided me with endless opportunities to grow as a teacher, parent, and colleague. I have been able to pursue my passion for lifelong learning. One of my personal goals is to give back to Providence Day what my children’s teachers gave to them; a deep sense of community and countless tools for lifelong learning. My husband and I will be eternally grateful for the care and dedication our children received at Providence Day. “Paying It Forward” has never been so much fun! THANK YOU, Providence Day!\n\nLower School Teaching Assistant\n\n5 Years of Service\n\nI\"m a midwest girl who grew up in the Northwest suburbs of Chicago and in the City after graduating from the University of Dayton, Ohio.

I have been part of the PDS family since my oldest daughter started TK in 2007, followed by her sister who started Kindergarten in 2010.

I received my undergraduate degree in business administration from East Carolina University. After working in banking for several years I decided my passion was teaching. I earned my Master's degree in Elementary Education from University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I taught K-2 in the Charlotte Mecklenburg School system for years before staying home to raise a family. As an empty nester I decided it was time to return to the classroom. I spent two years as a teaching assistant at CMS schools. My daughter was a \"lifer\" at Providence Day so coming to work in the lower school feels like coming home. When not at work I enjoy spending time with family and friends, walking my dogs, working out, reading and traveling.\n\nMiddle School Learning Specialist\n\n9 Years of Service\n\nMiddle School Learning Specialist\n\n9 Years of Service\n\n2 Years of Service\n\nTeaching Assistant\n\nDirector of Advancement Services\n\n11 Years of Service\n\nDirector of Advancement Services\n\n11 Years of Service\n\nTo learn more about the Institutional Advancement team, click here: https://www.providenceday.org/philanthropy/meet-the-team\n\nDirector of E-Sports\n\nFirst Year at Providence Day\n\nI grew up in Chester, S.C. before attending Clemson University.
