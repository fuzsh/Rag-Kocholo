        "text": "Kevin Spacey appears to have emerged from his legal troubles unscathed. He’s been found not guilty in two separate cases, but nobody wants to hire him in Hollywood. His name has been tarnished.\n\nHis latest project, a vocal performance in the film “Control,” had a last-minute cancellation at London’s Prince Charles Cinema after the event’s team realized that — shock —Kevin Spacey was in the movie.\n\nSpacey showed up yesterday at an event targeting “cancel culture,” and he got a rapturous welcome. The actor performed a short scene from William Shakespeare’s “Timon of Athens,” which resulted in a 40-second standing ovation afterwards.\n\nThe Spectator associate editor Douglas Murray invited Spacey and had this to say in his intro:\n\n“In an era of cancellation and defenestration we sometimes forget that we cannot go on like this and that we have been here before. We know this because our greatest writers and artists have addressed this question in their own times.”\n\nSpacey is 64-years-old. Maybe he’s guilty of some of the charges that were thrown against him, or maybe he’s not, it’s really hard to tell as sexual assault cases are sometimes very difficult to prove.\n\nI still enjoy a lot of Spacey’s work. He was once, before being embroiled in these controversies, known as one of the great living actors. His career highlights include marquee roles in “American Beauty”, “The Usual Suspects”, “Se7en”, “Glengary Glen Ross”, “L.A. Confidential” and “The Negotiator”.\n\nNow he’s starring in these micro-budget indies such as “Peter Five Eight” and “Control.” I doubt there’s currently a path for him to make a comeback in Hollywood."
