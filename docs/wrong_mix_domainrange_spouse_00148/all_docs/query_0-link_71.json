        "text": "I would like to thank all my friends and colleagues who have reached out during this difficult time. It is all still too overwhelming, but I promise to get back to you when able. Those who know me, know that I will do anything for my family and that I am not one to ask for help. But my boys come first and as such must ask for help, when help is needed. I am reaching out to you today with a humble request with Natasha's memorial fund. The fund was not created by me. The fund has been created to honor her life and legacy, my beloved wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, educator, and valued member of the wrestling community. The contributions will be used to support my two young children, Stacey and Nasa, in their future education and athletic pursuits and create a legacy in her name for other wrestlers to chase their dreams. Whether or not you are able to contribute, thank you for your kindness, empathy, and consideration. https://lnkd.in/gMez8dH7 Tod"
