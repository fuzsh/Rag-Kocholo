        "text": "The third programme of words and music scripted and adapted from letters and diaries by Lucy Parham chronicles the romantic life of one the greatest and most popular composers for solo piano – Frédéric Chopin. The narrative follows his turbulent relationship with the controversial literary figure George Sand, their time together in Majorca, his fragile health and his ultimate demise in poverty in Paris at the age of 39. The readings are interspersed with some of his most loved and poignant compositions.\n\nNocturne received its London première in the London Pianoforte Series at the Wigmore Hall in July 2010 – the 200th anniversary of Chopin’s birth, with Dame Harriet Walter and Samuel West.\n\nRecent and future performances include the Wigmore Hall, Cadogan Hall, Chopin Festival in Mallorca, Kings Place, Chopin Society London, British Library, St John’s Smith Square, Algarve Concert Series, Salisbury Playhouse, Richmond Theatre London, Hastings International Piano Festival, Rose Theatre Kingston, Shanklin Theatre, White Rock Theatre, Chipping Campden Festival, Cambridge International Festival, St.George’s Bristol, Hertford Theatre, Yeovil Octagon Theatre, Malvern Theatre, Chichester Festival Theatre, Winchester Festival, Almeida Theatre, Perth Festival, Bury St. Edmunds Festival, St George’s Hall Bradford, St Paul’s Knightsbridge, Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Harrogate International Festival, Sheffield International Concert Series, Middle Temple Recital Series and the Petworth Festival.\n\nNarrators include Juliet Stevenson, Alex Jennings, Dame Harriet Walter, Samuel West, Henry Goodman, Guy Paul, Emily Bruni, Guy Henry, Madeleine Potter, Patricia Hodge, Lloyd Owen, Robert Glenister, Niamh Cusack, Emilia Fox, Michael Maloney, Greg Wise, Rosamund Pike, Anna Chancellor, Roger Allam, Miranda Richardson and Rula Lenska.\n\nThe CD of Nocturne is now available on the Deux-Elles label with narrators Harriet Walter and Samuel West."
