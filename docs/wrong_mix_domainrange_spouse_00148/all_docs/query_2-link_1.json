        "text": "Emilia Fox says she took a huge risk by allowing herself to fall in love again - but she's never been happier than she is with beau Jonathan Stadlen.\n\nThe Silent Witness actress, 47, says her TV producer boyfriend 'makes her heart dance' after she let down her defences to get into a new relationship.\n\nEmilia opened up about her relationship to Good Housekeeping magazine as she posed for the March cover.\n\nShe told the publication - celebrating its 100th anniversary this year: \"It makes my heart dance thinking about what attracted me to him.\n\n\"We’ve met at a time in our lives when we’ve both had relationships, we both have children and we’ve both been on our own and, as a result, we’re able to communicate freely, openly and honestly about everything.\n\n\"I’ve not had communications like that in any romantic relationship, ever.\"\n\nEmilia, who was previously married to actor Jared Harris, added: \"Falling in love again – that’s a big risk.\n\n\"You have to be prepared to put all your cards on the table, to leave your past in the past and look forward to the future together – and to be vulnerable with that.\n\n\"I think that’s quite a brave thing to do.\"\n\nEmilia also shared how getting older had changed the way she thought about things.\n\nShe said: \"In my 30s, I was dealing with lots of change in my personal life; it felt like being on a rollercoaster. In your 20s, you can pursue your career; then suddenly, in your 30s, your body clock is ticking.\n\n\"You’re trying to form the relationships that you think might last for ever and, when they don’t, you have to work out how you feel about that and what you do. Thankfully, my 40s have been much calmer – and happier, too.\"\n\n* The full interview is in the March 2022 issue of Good Housekeeping, which is on sale from January 27."
