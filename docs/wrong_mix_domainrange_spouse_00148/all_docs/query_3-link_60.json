        "text": "Perhaps you’ve heard me complain (of course you have) about the current state of pay-TV. In my day (cue the cliched old-person talk), watching television cost you nothing. Sure, there were only twelve channels (fourteen, if you could convince your little brother to maneuver the antenna back and forth while you tried to watch Shock Theatre on Channel 44). And sure, water-cooler conversation centered around the age-old question: Addams Family or Munsters? And yet, buried under a plethora of hayseed comedies, there was always something good and/or fun to watch. And it was all free; all you had to do was watch the commercials and buy the Corn Flakes.\n\nFull confession: after writing this paragraph, I went on to write several more about the cost of modern television. I have to say they were very funny. But then, when I got to the part where I mentioned Peacock TV, I went back to my review of Poker Face and discovered that had I laid down this very same rant seven months ago! And so, gentleman that I am, I am editing out the rest of my complaining (which was extremely funny!!) and getting down to business.\n\nI have subscribed to a new streaming service.\n\nFor this I can blame Kemper Donovan or Caroline Crampton, who have both advertised Britbox on their respective, excellent podcasts. But let’s face it: weren’t Britbox and I were always going to be a match made in heaven? Britbox is a classic mystery lover’s delight, and while it provides me with a library for all those Poirots and Marples and other Christie shows, there are dozens and dozens of programmes (see? I’m adjusting my spelling!!) that I have never seen and can finally catch up on.\n\nWith a special promotion, I got a year of Britbox for just under $80. (The deal lasts through January.) And so I have decided to live with the service for a year and see how I do. That means that you, my friends, will be going on this viewing journey with me! So strap in!\n\nAt first glance, the number of shows that appear here is daunting. I scrolled and scrolled to figure out which mystery I should watch first. The solution (which may seem mysterious to you) is that I ended up binge-watching a game show called Would I Lie to You? It is absolutely hilarious and perfect for viewing on these gray, rainy days that have besieged us this week.\n\nNext, I thought I would figure out whether Father Brown is as disappointing as all my British friends say it is. But I got distracted by the spin-off, Sister Boniface Mysteries, which somebody said was better. I found it . . . okay. The characters are appealing, but the mysteries make Midsomer Murders look hard-hitting. And I fell asleep during the second episode. I also learned something valuable from the good Sister: it seems that I need to watch some of these shows with the subtitles on. (Frankly, I often wish I could have subtitles when I meet with my Book Club. These people all talk in British!!!)\n\nBut enough with all the hors d’oeuvres! It’s time for something substantial, something meaningful, something . . . Christie! After all, today is the 48th anniversary of our favorite author’s death, and homage must be paid. And so last night, I decided to watch Why Didn’t They Ask Evans.\n\nHere’s where I make some fellow Christie fans angry: I’m not particularly fond of this novel. I’m never particularly happy when Christie eschews puzzle for a sort of twee thriller vibe. Oh, she loved her bright young things! The 20’s are loaded with them: there’s Tommy and Tuppence, of course, but there’s also Anne Beddingfeld and Harry Lucas (The Man in the Brown Suit), and “Bundle” Brent and Bill Eversleigh (The Secret of Chimneys and The Seven Dials Mystery). Why Didn’t They Ask Evans? is the last, and probably the best, of these light-hearted thrillers, but despite the likability of Bobby Jones and Frankie Derwent, it all seemed so silly to me. But then, to my discredit, I’ve never been a P.G. Wodehouse sort of guy. There was a TV adaptation that came out in 1980, starring Francesca Annis and James Warwick, who had previously made a splash as (a far too glamorous) Tommy and Tuppence. I own this film, but despite their chemistry and the presence of Sir John Guilgud, Eric Porter and even Joan Hickson (!), I found the whole affair a trifle slow-going.\n\nAnyway, the new adaptation of Why Didn’t They Ask Evans? came out all the way back in 2022. I figured that it would eventually appear on public TV in the USA, but it turns out that this was a Britbox exclusive, and the only way I could watch it was to subscribe. The adaptation comes from the mind of none other than actor/comedian/writer Hugh Laurie, and it was well-received enough that future adaptations were okayed. Through circumstances that might appear in a Christie thriller and therefore cannot be divulged, I managed to watch the follow-up, Murder Is Easy, before this one and managed to enjoy much of it. The question of the moment is how would I feel about an adaptation of a Christie novel I like half as much as the novel upon which a problematic but still enjoyable adaptation was made?\n\nAnd the answer is . . . this is how it’s done, folks.\n\nFrom the opening shots swirling around the village of Marchbolt and the adjoining cliffside golf links, you know you’re in the right place. Laurie’s screenplay is so fresh and witty that the characters come to life on the screen. It’s like he has this total respect for Christie’s plot, character and words but knows exactly how it must be adapted for modern audiences.\n\nAnd so we are immediately introduced to Bobby Jones (Will Poulter, displaying none of the smarmy smugness that always accompanied James Warwick in his Christie performances) playing golf with his friend, Dr. Thomas. Bobby is the vicar’s son, newly released from the Navy and about to partner with his mate, ex-sailor “Badger” Beadon, on a garage in London. The men’s golf game is interrupted by the sound of a scream, and when they investigate, they see the body of a man lying on the shore after apparently having fallen from the cliffs.\n\nIn the series, Dr. Thomas, also a veteran, has a wooden leg and must therefore go for help while Bobby clambers down the cliffs to see to the man. Miraculously, he is still alive – at least long enough to off the titular dying message before succumbing to his wounds.\n\nEven the Christies I don’t love have great hooks, and this one is beautifully filmed. Laurie plunges Bobby into the mystery just as in the book, but then he pulls back and lets us get to know the Vicar (Alistair Petrie, so good in Sex Education) and introduces us to Lady Frances “Frankie” Derwent (brilliantly played by Lucy Boynton), Bobby’s old childhood . . . friend? crush?, who clearly is crushing on the strapping Mr. Jones.\n\nSomehow, the “twee”-ness of the novel has been undercut here, by Laurie’s sparkling dialogue and excellent direction, by the gorgeous cinematography (by John de Borman and Mika Orasmaa) and by the art design. I have to say that after watching the depiction of Marchbolt that it’s harder to like the Wychwood-Under-Ashe presented in Murder Is Easy. It’s like between 1934 (when Evans is set) and 1954 (the updated time period of Easy), someone took a giant pencil and erased all the charm and texture of an English village. The three-part drama is very stylish and yet never leans into the overly stylized rendition of Christie’s fiction that turned me off to all those Annis/Warwick adaptations. Does the plot seem to come out of an old Wilkie Collins novel? Sure – but here it is grounded in realism in the way it is filmed and acted, and it works. It also zips along – funny how Murder Is Easy was told in only two installments and yet feels longer and slower.\n\nThere are changes from the novel – I don’t remember a certain friend of Bobby’s dying in the book, and the method of Bobby’s poisoning is rendered more dramatic by the carnival setting. There is also some reference to class, as there was in Murder Is Easy, but it revolves quite naturally around the relationship between the patrician Frankie and the steady middle-class Bobby. I found some of what Easy was exploring to be fascinating, but other parts, like the awful scene with the cleaning women, hit us over the head in an awfully clumsy way.\n\nThere’s nothing clumsy here: all is grace and suspense and humor. None other than Emma Thompson and Jim Broadbent appear in delightful cameos as Frankie’s parents, and Laurie even reserves a strategic part for himself in the final chapter. He’s great in the part, but mostly we owe him mightily for his direction and for a screenplay that, while it cannot avoid the essential lunacy of Christie’s plot (just where do you think Evans has been all this time???), it embraces that craziness and makes it real. Well, real enough.\n\nAs a devout Agathologist who had declared himself averse to the purist take on Christie adaptations, I intend to embrace as much as possible the varied approaches future producers and writers may take to Christie’s work. Still, I can’t help but hope that at least some of these people take a page from Hugh Laurie’s approach, for this is one adaptation that really got it right! Score one for Britbox: as the year continues, look for me to highlight other programs that strike my fancy. Let’s see if 2024 ends with me re-upping or cancelling my subscription."
