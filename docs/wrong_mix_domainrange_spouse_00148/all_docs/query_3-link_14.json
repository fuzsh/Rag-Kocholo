        "text": "Jack The Ripper is one of the most notorious serial killers in history, but more than 130 years after his crimes, his identity has remained a mystery.\n\nHowever, thanks to the breakthroughs in technology since he first prowled the streets of London, that might finally be about to change.\n\nAnd, after we’ve all shown how much we live for true crime shows – thanks to Making A Murderer, Dirty John and the Serial podcast – his crimes is being re-examined in new documentary, Jack The Ripper: The Case Reopened.\n\nWhat is Jack The Ripper: The Case Reopened?\n\nA new three-part documentary series is hoping to re-examine the infamous Jack The Ripper murders, which took part in 1888, using science and new technology to make a breakthrough in the case and get to the bottom of the murders.\n\nEmilia Fox has been joined by Professor David Wilson and a string of forensic experts to delve back into the files, taking another look over the crime scene photographs and analysing the murder using modern day techniques.\n\nSpeaking about the show, BBC Commissioning Editor Craig Hunter said: ‘Jack the Ripper is synonymous with murder and intrigue – even if you don’t know all the details, you will have heard of the case.\n\n‘It is remarkable to think that today’s scientific techniques can be used to help try and tackle unanswered questions which are more than a century old.’\n\nWhat are the Jack The Ripper murders?\n\nJack The Ripper was an unidentified serial killer who roamed around London between August and November, 1888.\n\nHe is thought to have killed give poor, working-class women around Whitechapel during this. Several police officers got involved in a huge manhunt around the area, but he was never caught.\n\nEarlier this month, scientists appeared to make a breakthrough, claiming Polish barber Aaron Kosminski was behind the series of brutal killings after fresh DNA tests were undertaken on blood and semen found on victim Catherine Eddowes’ shawl.\n\nWhen is Jack The Ripper: The Case Reopened on?\n\nJack The Ripper: The Case Reopened begins on Thursday, 28 March, at 9pm, on BBC One, and will air for three weeks.\n\nWho is presenting?\n\nSilent Witness star Emilia Fox is at the helm of the documentary, taking her interest in true crime to the next level, and she was there for the discovery of Kosminski’s DNA.\n\nSpeaking about the series, she previously told TV Times: ‘It was satisfying – I think we all enjoy solving mysteries.\n\n‘It also felt like it was absolutely the right conclusion to come to given all the evidence we’d examined during the course of the programme.\n\n‘He wasn’t some legendary, celebrity serial killer. He was a man who had mental health issues, who did brutal things to vulnerable women.\n\n‘I find it comforting that today he’d have been caught be police very quickly.’\n\nJack The Ripper: The Case Reopened airs Thursday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE : Kylie Jenner’s ex-BFF Jordyn Woods gets building own empire as she launches lashes at Superdrug"
