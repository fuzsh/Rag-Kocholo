        "text": "Tony Blackburn has picked up a special honour at The Radio Academy Awards, marking his 50 years on the airwaves.\n\nIt is the second time the DJ has received the academy's Gold Award - having originally been honoured on his silver anniversary in 1989.\n\n\"It's very kind of you,\" said the 71-year-old. \"I want to thank the medical team that keep me going.\"\n\nBBC Radio 2 won Station of the Year, while LBC's phone-ins with Nick Clegg and Boris Johnson got a special award.\n\nAsk Boris and Call Clegg have consistently made headlines, as listeners question London's Mayor and the Deputy Prime Minister on their policies and current events.\n\nMr Johnson dedicated the prize to the programme's production team, without whom, he said, he was just \"an overweight Belgian tourist\" on the Alpine slopes of live radio.\n\nHe also thanked \"the people of London, who have listened in their dozens.\"\n\nIt was one of three awards for commercial broadcaster LBC, which went national last year.\n\nHowever, the BBC dominated the ceremony, formerly known as the Sony Awards, topping 22 of the ceremony's 34 categories.\n\nBBC Radio 4 won more top prizes than any other station, with gold awards for best music documentary (Strange Fruit), best drama (The Morpeth Carol) and best comedy (The Secret World).\n\nWinifred Robinson's moving, illuminating interview with the father of murdered toddler Jamie Bulger was named interview of the year.\n\nAnd John Sergeant handed the best news programme prize to Radio 4's PM.\n\nAsked by host Chris Evans to explain why Jeremy Paxman had quit Newsnight, the former political correspondent replied: \"He wants to be a ballroom dancer\".\n\nCommercial station Absolute got four awards, including best speech programme for Frank Skinner's weekly show.\n\n\"This is like The Hungry Caterpillar winning the Booker Prize,\" said the comedian.\n\nRadio 1 took three awards, including best entertainment show for drivetime host Greg James, and best documentary for Tempted by Teacher, an investigation of student-teacher relationships.\n\nEvening show DJ Zane Lowe, meanwhile, was named music broadcaster of the year for the fifth time.\n\n\"Thanks to the academy for recognising that I love music,\" said the New Zealander, whose bizarre interview with Kanye West went viral last year.\n\n\"That's all I'm here to do - to put music and audiences together.\"\n\nBlackburn's career has been full of high-profile presenting jobs, including being the first DJ to broadcast on Radio 1 when it launched in September 1967 - a station where he spent 17 years.\n\nHe then presented BBC London's weekday mid-morning show before becoming one of the launch presenters on Capital Gold.\n\nSince 2010 he has hosted Radio 2's Pick of the Pops, and he also currently presents shows on BBC London 94.9, BBC Radio Berkshire, the Magic network, BBC3CR and KMFM.\n\nHe was presented with his Gold Award by Graham Norton, whose own Radio show precedes Pick of the Pops on Saturday mornings.\n\n\"My greatest pleasure at Radio 2 is every Saturday morning when Tony comes into our studio,\" said Norton.\n\n\"He bounces in and I go, 'how are you Tony?'\n\n\"And he replies: 'Still not arrested!'\"\n\nIn his speech, Blackburn thanked his many employers over the years, and made special mention of Radio Caroline founder Ronan O'Rahilly.\n\n\"I've never heard anyone say thanks to Ronan,\" he said, \"but he's the man who started it all.\n\n\"I'm very grateful to Radio Caroline. They brought about the radio we have now, and without them I certainly wouldn't be here... So they've got a lot to answer for.\"\n\nBlackburn went on to say he had recently considered retiring live on air, in the style of US chat show host David Letterman.\n\n\"I got my family together last week, and I said it's probably time I spent more time with you at home.\n\n\"And they all said to me, 'we'd rather you didn't.' So I've decided to go on for another 50 years.\""
