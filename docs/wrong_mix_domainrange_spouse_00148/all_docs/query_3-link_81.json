        "text": "Joining Harris—who plays the conniving Le Vicomte de Valmont—in the tale of lust, love and intrigue in 18th-century France will be Polly Walker as La Marquise de Merteuil; Emilia Fox as Madame de Tourvel; Jeremy Edwards as Azolan; Dilys Laye as Madame de Rosemonde; Olivia Llewellyn as Cécile Volanges; Sean Oliver as Major Domo; Laurence Penry-Jones as Danceny; Sarah Woodward as Madame de Volanges. Les Liaisons Dangereuses, which Hampton adapted from the novel by Choderlos de Laclos, is directed by Tim Fywell. The set design will be by Robert Innes-Hopkins.\n\nThe original Liasons—in which the Marquise bets her former lover, the womanizing, game-playing Valmont, that he can't seduce the pure and moral Madame de Tourvel—originally starred Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan. They repeated their performances on Broadway in 1987.\n\nA 1988 movie starred John Malkovich, Glenn Close and Michelle Pfieffer."
