        "text": "Brenda Joyce Hackley Lockhart, 73, of Bentonville, passed away on Wednesday, July 24th, 2024.\n\nBrenda was born on February 11, 1951, in Amissville, Virginia, the daughter of the late Edward Roger Hackley and Carol Frances Williams Hackley. Her husband, Miller Jackson “Jack” Lockhart, preceded her in death.\n\nShe graduated from Rappahannock County High School and served over 30 years as a Procurement Officer at Rappahannock Rapidan Community Services Board, where she made the most wonderful lifelong friends who continued to gather as the “lunch ladies” well after their retirement. Brenda also ran the Massanutten Canoe Company with her family in Bentonville for 35 years, and she made wonderful memories with the campers who returned every summer for decades to visit the beautiful Stinson farm on the Shenandoah River. She was a lifelong member of Amissville United Methodist Church. Brenda had the heart of a true “giver” and would always look for ways to show someone kindness and generosity by giving acquaintances, friends, and loved ones small and thoughtful gifts throughout the year. She loved to gather her family and friends for meals and would always plan the next gathering of her loved ones around a table.\n\nBrenda is survived by her loving children H. Anthony Clark (Jeanian) of Bentonville, Angela Robinson (M.W.) of Front Royal, Thomas Lockhart of Bentonville, and Teresa Lamb (Bobby) of Front Royal, grandchildren Zane Clark, Jaclyn Clark, and Braden Robinson, sister Edie Fishback, lifelong best friend Jody Wingfield, and companion and caregiver Bonita Rose.\n\nZane Clark, David Durrer, Austin Durrer, Braden Robinson, Larry Mathews, Jr., and Zipper Snipes will be pallbearers. Honorary pallbearers will be Larry Mathews Sr., Darryll Mathews, Allen Mathews, and Bubba Hitt.\n\nThe Reverend Frank Fishback will officiate a funeral service at Maddox Funeral Home in Front Royal on July 30, 2024, at 2 p.m. The family will receive friends at noon, before the start of the service.
