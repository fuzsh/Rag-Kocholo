        "text": "Although Jared Harris looks and sounds like his father, Richard Harris, you suspect he would rather he didn’t. It can’t be easy following in those footsteps, which may be why Jared considered careers in teaching and law before enrolling at Duke University in America to study drama. “Here in England my becoming an actor was considered unimaginative,” he says. “Over there they took the view: ‘Hell, let’s see.’”\n\nThey were right to take that view, because Harris has had a successful film and television career in his own right, playing opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, Robert Downey Jnr in Sherlock, and, most notably, Jon Hamm in Mad Men, the award-winning television drama set in a Sixties New York advertising agency.\n\nIn terms of his personality Harris seems to have been rather successful in not being his father. When I meet him in a London hotel — he lives in LA but is here to finish work on his new film The Quiet Ones — he doesn’t pick fights, get drunk, show off or, as Richard Harris notoriously did in an interview with Lynn Barber, spend the whole time playing pocket billiards.\n\nJared Harris, who is 52, has a gap between his front teeth, an eyebrow that arches when he is emphasising a point, and a patchy beard, which, with its reddish hue, speaks of his Irish ancestry. He seems gathered, calm and, perhaps like Lane Pryce, the mild-mannered accountant he played in Mad Men, imbued with a certain pathos.\n\nWould it, I ask, be fair to say that having an incautious father has made him cautious? “I think before I leap, sure. I would sit and watch what Dad’s relationship was to the acting profession, and to fame, and I must have made some decision about it, about what I wanted instead. It annoys me at times, I have to say, because there are cards he had which I’ve wished I had.”\n\nSuch as? “As an actor, he had a powerful presence and he controlled every environment he was in, whereas my personality is more about slipping in and checking things out. Lots of times we would be out at a restaurant and he would start telling a story and notice that the people at the next table were listening in so he would…” Jared pushes back his chair and turns it to face an imaginary audience. “He’d do this, shift his position to include them. By the end of the story the whole restaurant would be listening and laughing, and on more than one occasion they applauded.”\n\nHis love for his father, who died in 2002, is obvious and he tells me he still thinks about him every day. But what, I ask, can it have been like growing up with Richard Harris around? His father was, after all, as well known for his hell-raising as he was for his films. “We [Jared has two brothers] were at boarding school [Downside] eight months of the year and when we had our time with Dad he was completely focused on us. There were no wild parties when we were with him in the holidays. We would travel and have a lot of fun. Whatever he got up to when we weren’t around we didn’t know about, we only heard about it when we were older. Now I run in to people who want to share their stories about him and I f---ing love the stories!”\n\nAh yes, the stories. After his drunken rampages through Soho with Peter O’Toole and Richard Burton, Richard Harris often ended up spending the night in a cell. At closing time once he boarded a train at King’s Cross, because they were still allowed to serve drinks on it, and ended up in Leeds, whereupon he put a brick through someone’s window and demanded a bed for the night.\n\n“I met Peter O’Toole for the first time at Dad’s memorial service,” Jared says, “because my Dad didn’t hang around with people like that when we were around. We didn’t grow up with Richard Burton coming around to tea.” Perhaps having his father’s fame to deal with was enough for any child, especially when he turned up at school. All Jared’s classmates would stare. “Dad would never arrive on the correct visiting day, but that didn’t stop him demanding to take us out. He was a rule breaker, and nothing is more attractive to someone stuck at boarding school.”\n\nHis father may have been fun to be around most of the time, but he was also prone to black moods and violent eruptions. Has he inherited that fiery temper? “I don’t think so, but other people might say I did.”\n\nEver get into fights? He shakes his head. Not like his father then, who seemed to positively enjoy fighting. A nod this time. “He enjoyed conflict and argument, in fact his mind was at its clearest when he was in an argument.”\n\nHe tells me about the last fight he saw his father get into. “He was 70 and he was outside the Coach and Horses not far from here having a Guinness and an Irish girl came up to him and started having a go, something about how Dad hadn’t ‘given back’ to Limerick. ‘I really am a very forgiving man,’ he said to her. ‘I can forgive ignorance, and I can even forgive rudeness, but I can’t forgive ugliness and you are the ugliest woman I have ever seen, now f--- off.’”\n\nShe went inside and came back out with her boyfriend, a strapping young man, who challenged him to a fight. “As Dad was standing up he sucker-punched the boyfriend and knocked him out. Then the woman started running around shouting ‘Dickie Harris has killed my boyfriend!’ and Dad took his Guinness and chucked it into the young man’s face. When he came round he said: ‘He’s not dead.’”\n\nDid his father’s alcoholism make him nervous about the effects of drinking? “I enjoy a drink and I probably enjoyed it too much when I was younger and was better able to take it and recover. Now I don’t enjoy that feeling of being crappy for two days after. What little I saw of Dad drinking it looked like fun. I know that’s not the right thing to say. I remember on one trip to Dublin the journey took three times as long as it should have because we kept stopping off at pubs. I was over there for a meeting and he came along for the ride. That night there were 15 people back at the hotel, people he had picked up in his travelling circus. A one-day trip turned into four. We kept booking flights back and missing them.”\n\nOn the subject of actors and self-destructive behaviour, we talk about the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, whom Jared once worked with. Does he think Hoffman was like that anyway, or was it the pressures of film stardom that drove him to drugs? “Up to a point. One of the reasons why good actors are good is that they have poor impulse control. If you put them in front of a camera they respond as if it was actually happening, in real time, rather than doing it after several takes. I think he was like that. But self-destruction isn’t unique to actors, is it?”\n\nThe profession is known for making people feel insecure, though. When his character was killed off in Mad Men, did it feel like a little death? “When Matt [the creator] told me, I was upset, really upset. When I got home my girlfriend at the time, now my wife, could see something was up. But we were sworn to secrecy. I thought: this is silly, I can’t keep it a secret from her for the next seven months until the episode comes out. So I told her and we had a little wake for Lane at that point, the two of us.”\n\nBut it must have been quite liberating to move on from Mad Men, which sticks so tightly to the script actors aren’t even allowed to change “is not” to “isn’t”. “The flip side of that approach is that you don’t have to worry about whether your script makes sense or not. It’s incredibly well thought out.” He leans forward. “Look, I miss Mad Men, but I can’t complain because I got a lot of public awareness from it and it led on to film offers such as Sherlock.”\n\nHe plays the lead in his new movie, which is a horror film in the tradition of The Others and The Ring. I ask him why audiences enjoy being frightened. “I’m not sure. Masochism maybe. Titillation. But I don’t understand the appeal of violence porn.”\n\nDoes he enjoy watching himself on the big screen? “Not at all. I keep hearing a viciously self-critical voice in my head saying: ‘You could have done that better.’” Sounds pretty angsty. He got married a few months ago to Allegra Riggio, a lighting designer and television host – has he warned her about the angst and insecurity that goes with being an actor? “I think the biggest angst you have as an actor is fear of unemployment. Unemployment is hell.”\n\nHow did they meet? “At the Comedy Store in LA, a mutual friend was doing a comedy show and sent out an email saying ‘come and support me’. We had a good chat but nothing significant happened. She was at the tail end of a relationship and I was going through a horrendous divorce. Neither of us were looking for somebody. And it was seven months later that we reconnected and went out on a date.”\n\nThe horrendous divorce was from the actress Emilia Fox, star of Silent Witness. She comes from an acting dynasty too; did they compare notes on what that was like? “No, no.” It didn’t come up? “I think it was something we had in common and it created some level of understanding, maybe. But we didn’t discuss it.” Is he still in touch with her? He shakes his head and mouths the word: “No.”\n\nI suppose one advantage of coming from an acting dynasty is that you are not daunted by the prospect of dealing with mercurial film stars. After growing up around Richard Harris, working with Day-Lewis must have seemed like a breeze. “I felt very comfortable with him. I’d read a lot about his ‘method’ and chose to view it as a challenge. He demanded you be on your toes the entire time you were on set together. With him it’s an extended improvisation. He’s in the character all the time. I saw him walking across this muddy track to the field where we were shooting, with that odd gait, and I thought: F---ing hell, that is Lincoln.”\n\nWas he allowed to speak in his English accent around Day-Lewis? “No. Everyone had to speak in an American accent around him. Actually there was a moment where he asked me about Mad Men, because he was a fan of the show, and he obviously wasn’t still in 19th-century character at that point.”\n\nThere was another tricky actor in his life when he was growing up, Rex Harrison, whom his mother, the socialite Elizabeth Rees-Williams, married after she divorced Richard Harris. How did they compare as father figures? “Very different people. Rex lived an outwardly much grander life than my father. He would go off on yachts. Hire helicopters and so on. But he didn’t really like kids.”\n\nHarrison was his model for Pryce, he says. “Lane had moved from England to America where he thought people wouldn’t judge him. Rex was born in Liverpool and went to grammar school, but then he became the epitome of an English upper-class gentleman. It was all a pretence.”\n\nTellingly, Jared says that what he liked about America when he first moved there was not being asked which school he went to. “No matter what you do in life the English will judge you on what school you went to. They’ll never let you forget it.” Nor will they let you forget who your father is. He doesn’t say this out loud, but I can tell from the arched eyebrow he is directing at me that this is what he is thinking."
