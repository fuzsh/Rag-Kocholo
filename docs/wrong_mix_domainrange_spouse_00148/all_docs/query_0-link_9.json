Rock it, Tom!\n\nDa, da, da, da, da, da, da!\n\nVO: ..and one big challenge - who can seek out and buy the best antiques at the very best prices...\n\nI knew it wouldn't be easy!\n\nVO: ..and auction for a big profit further down the road?\n\nPotential for disaster.\n\nVO: Who will spot the good investments?\n\nWho will listen to advice?\n\nWhat you've just come out with there, I cannot believe that!\n\nVO: And who will be the first to say \"Don't you know who I am?!\"\n\nVO: Time to put your pedal to the metal - this is Celebrity Antiques Road Trip!\n\nYeah!\n\nVO: Getting to the bottom of things on this big antiques case, we have two of the sexiest lab geeks going.\n\nCo-stars in one of Britain's best crime dramas, Silent Witness, it's Emilia Fox and Tom Ward.\n\nEMILIA: My plan is to push you out of the way.\n\nTOM: I have no idea what makes...\n\nI wouldn't know a good antique if it leapt up and slapped me in the face.\n\nEMILIA: Well, it's definitely not gonna do that.\n\nIt might do.\n\nIt might be one of those novelty jack-in-the-boxes.\n\nVO: Hailing from a dynasty of thespians, Emilia is an award winning actress, best known for her role as Dr Nikki Alexander in Silent Witness.\n\nNothing gets past this smart cookie.\n\nIt panics me that you're going to be looking on the bottom of sort of jugs, and going \"Oh, yes, that's...Diddlee-Diddleywood\", whereas I will literally find something that I like, which will be worthless.\n\nWell, it's clever of you to remember that I like looking at jugs, but... (EMILIA LAUGHS) VO: Tom has played Dr Harry Cunningham, a forensic pathologist, in crime drama Silent Witness for the last 10 years, opposite our Emilia.\n\nTOM: I will try and be very, very clever about some sort of naval, lunar, map-reading instrument!\n\nTOM: And I'll pay 200 quid for it and it will turn out to have been mass made in Hull by a bloke called Fred.\n\nVO: And they're racing to the scene of the challenge in a rather cool 1981 Mercedes SL.\n\nEMILIA: If you're an antique expert, does that mean you're very, very old?\n\nIt's not an expert who is themselves an antique, if that's what you mean.\n\nEMILIA: Exactly.\n\nVO: And from one classy pair to another.\n\nTrundling along in this charismatic Citroen 2CV - ha!\n\n- we've got two of the finest antiques experts who were available: VO: It's Charlie Ross and James Braxton.\n\nCHARLIE: I don't think I'm in first!\n\nOoh, I am now, that's better!\n\nOh, this is the cutting edge, Bingo!\n\nVO: Charlie is an auctioneer and antiques expert of worldwide repute.\n\nHe even once raised $33 million in one day at a motor auction in LA.\n\nCHARLIE: So 50 plus 30... DEALER: Yes.\n\n..equals 70, yeah?\n\nVO: He's good with numbers, our Charlie, and oh so suave.\n\nJAMES: I see you've got your best beige on.\n\nCHARLIE: I'm in understated beige.\n\nVO: This man's parents persisted in taking him around stately homes as a child to gawk at antiques, and now look at him.\n\nJAMES: Now you can see I'm obviously a jazz musician by the way I'm approaching this!\n\nVO: With 25 years in the antiques business, he knows a good thing when he sees it, our James - or, as Charlie likes to call him, \"Bingo\".\n\nCHARLIE: Oh Bingo, I think you've put on the old three piece suit today, haven't you?\n\nJAMES: I have.\n\nCHARLIE: Especially.\n\nCHARLIE: Do you think Emilia's going to be turned on by your three piece wear?\n\nJAMES: I don't know, it's a risk.\n\nShe might like the charming, debonair thing, the tanned... this is a man resting from his yacht.\n\nVO: This Celebrity Antiques Road Trip kicks off in the historic city of Glasgow, covering the city from east to west before scampering towards home turf 450 miles south for an auction showdown in Billingshurst, West Sussex.\n\nVO: With its hustle and bustle and a history as rich in culture as it is in crime - ha!\n\n- Glasgow is the perfect playground for this plucky pair.\n\nYou are so competitive about everything.\n\nTOM: I am not!\n\nYou are quietly very competitive.\n\nIn fact, you're slightly like the Terminator.\n\nI think a bit of your face is going to fall off.\n\nWell if a bit of my face falls off, then auction it.\n\nWell, I want to win.\n\nVO: Emilia and Tom have Â£400 each, two days to forensically forage for antiques and one crucial auction to see who can turn the biggest profit.\n\nCHARLIE: Let battle commence.\n\nWhat are you doing?!\n\nYou're not putting a jacket on?!\n\nCHARLIE: You old tart!\n\nSee you later!\n\nCHARLIE: Ah-ha!\n\nTom?\n\nTOM: Hello, Tom, yes.\n\nCharlie.\n\nHello Charlie.\n\nJames.\n\nHi James.\n\nJAMES: Emilia.\n\nCHARLIE: Emilia.\n\nOh!\n\nEmilia!\n\nWe were actually going to have a boxing fight.\n\nWe were going to have a fight.\n\nOver you, Tom.\n\nI knew that was going to happen!\n\nDidn't I say that?\n\nCHARLIE: As senior member I've made a decision here.\n\nHave you?\n\nIf Emilia can put up with you - and it'll be hard, Emilia - I'm going to join you two for the next two days.\n\nJAMES: That's really nice of you.\n\nEMILIA: Fantastic.\n\nCHARLIE: You happy with that?\n\nBingo knows everything about nothing.\n\nWell I know everything about everything Charlie, so come... Go on Emilia.\n\nCHARLIE: Treat him gently!\n\nVO: Both teams are kicking off their antiques buying here, at Glasgow Antiques and Collectibles Market, housed in the world famous Barras market.\n\nThe Barrowlands, affectionately dubbed the Barras, sprang into being in the early 1920s.\n\nToday, it houses in excess of 300 traders, and has become an intrinsic part of Glasgow life.\n\nCHARLIE: Tom, why don't you have a good look round on your own?\n\nAlright.\n\nSo that we're not influencing one another.\n\nAnd if you see something... TOM: I'll summon you.\n\nYeah.\n\nDo you like that, or does it leave you cold?\n\nEMILIA: Personally, it leaves me cold.\n\nJAMES: Right.\n\nEMILIA: But how much is it?\n\nCoffee tables.\n\nHe's wanting Â£300 for it.\n\nEMILIA: Forget it.\n\nJAMES: So keep looking, we need that rare treat.\n\nCall me if you need any help.\n\nJAMES: Will do, will do.\n\nAny expert help!\n\nIt's very, very hard.\n\nTOM: I don't know, I feel slightly kind of lost.\n\nOh look at that, what's that little brooch thing... no.\n\nI slightly feel like I'm sort of taking stuff back to the headmaster and getting approval or not.\n\nCHARLIE: Tom?\n\nYou talking to me?\n\nLarge lumps of big furniture I know absolutely nothing about.\n\nNo.\n\nI think large lumps of big furniture, not good news.\n\nTOM: Interesting postbox?\n\nCHARLIE: I suspect that is...\n\nFake.\n\nGreat fun, but it's fake.\n\nWell spotted.\n\nRather like us: great fun but fake.\n\nYou speak for yourself!\n\nVO: After that fake start, the boys have tuned into something rather natty.\n\nVO: Dealer Ros is keen to help.\n\nCHARLIE: It's walnut, it's English.\n\nIf it didn't have the radio in it, it would be unsaleable as a piece of furniture.\n\nYes.\n\nCHARLIE: But of course, old radios have become hugely collectable.\n\nIs Radio Luxembourg marked on there?\n\nI don't think it is, actually.\n\nWe've got Kalundborg, Oslo, Reykjavik... CHARLIE: Come on Tom, fire it up.\n\nTOM: Right-o.\n\nCHARLIE: Yeah.\n\n(ROCK MUSIC ON RADIO) Rock it, Tom!\n\nTOM: OK, sorry, that's enough.\n\nI think we've all seen enough of that, don't you?\n\nI do!\n\nThere was a bit of interference, but is that where it is, or...?\n\nIt's because it's in here.\n\nRight.\n\nI've had it outside and it's brilliant sound.\n\nNever known a saleswoman like her.\n\nI know, she's got it all covered, hasn't she?\n\nAbsolutely fantastic.\n\nYou'll be telling me you made the damn thing next!\n\nNo, no, no, I'm not as old as Marconi yet!\n\nCHARLIE: Oh no!\n\nROS: It's my birthday today.\n\nCHARLIE: It's your birthday today?\n\nTOM: It's your birthday?\n\nROS: Today.\n\nTOM: Goodness me happy birthday.\n\nROS: Thank you.\n\nCHARLIE: Happy birthday.\n\nThank you.\n\nTOM: So you'll be feeling very generous, presumably.\n\nCHARLIE: Your birthday present to us could be to give us the Marconi radio.\n\nHow much is it darling?\n\nHow would 90 suit you?\n\nOoh.\n\n90, that sounds... ROS: And I'll throw in the dog.\n\nCHARLIE: I'd almost rather you didn't throw in the dog.\n\nTOM: Don't foist that dog off!\n\nBut you see, if the dog was thrown in, somebody might bid 10 or 20 quid for it for a laugh.\n\nTOM: Absolutely.\n\nJAMES: He's working his magic, isn't he?\n\nCHARLIE: Could we reserve it?\n\nROS: OK. JAMES: Worthless.\n\nHave you spent any money yet Emilia?\n\nI might, I might not!\n\nOoh, cagey.\n\nI told you, didn't I?\n\nI told you she'd be competitive.\n\nSo you're going for furnishings, are you?\n\nI'm not going to tell you what we're going for!\n\nYou're going to start getting all, you know... VO: The battle to be top dog has well and truly begun.\n\nJAMES: Don't panic about the opposition.\n\nFocus on the goods, not our competitors.\n\nReally?\n\nYeah, because it distracts you.\n\nBut that's half the fun of it!\n\nIt distracts you.\n\nEMILIA: I love this painting here.\n\nJAMES: So what do you like about that?\n\nWell that's something that I would have in my house.\n\nJAMES: Well it's an acid test, isn't it?\n\nEMILIA: Oh no!\n\nOh my God!\n\nSorry!\n\nSo 1912.\n\nThe frame looks totally contemporary.\n\nIt's on canvas, it's cracking a bit there.\n\nWould you have that in your house?\n\nWell not any more, because I've just seen what would happen!\n\nThe picture would fall out of it!\n\nNo, we can secure it, don't worry about that.\n\nJAMES: But it's all fine.\n\nJust very nicely complex, builded up, isn't it?\n\nEMILIA: Held together with sticking plaster.\n\nJAMES: I like that, isn't it?\n\nÂ£80 is too much, but this is where you come in, Emilia.\n\nThis is where you flutter your eyelids and all that sort of thing.\n\nI don't think that that's going to work.\n\nJAMES: Of course it is!\n\nOf course it is!\n\nEMILIA: You have so much faith in me.\n\nJAMES: Of course it is.\n\nEMILIA: Thank you.\n\nVO: A devilish plan there James, but it might just work.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie has come over all glassy eyed.\n\nCHARLIE: Very saleable objects, little perfume bottles.\n\nTOM: Right, little nick-nacks.\n\nCHARLIE: Ink wells, there's a little tidy there TOM: OK. CHARLIE: That's got a hallmark and the lion passant means it's silver.\n\nCHARLIE: Good thing about that is that it has a cut glass base, which you have to check very carefully, to make sure it's not chipped or damaged which it doesn't appear to be.\n\nThat's an impressive... TOM: Chunky CHARLIE: Very heavy cut glass TOM: Nice to have in hand.\n\nCHARLIE: That's an inkwell TOM: That's an inkwell is it?\n\nWouldn't that look wonderful if you put blue ink it?\n\nAh that's the idea VO: Dealer Vincenzo is on hand to help.\n\nCHARLIE: Vincenzo, are you a man that can be insulted or you wouldn't be insulted by an offer?\n\nFrom you I would never be insulted, I can always say no.\n\nMight laugh heartily.\n\nCHARLIE: We're not very keen on the elephants but we quite like all the jars but I was wondering as a sort of job lot for the lot I would like to pay a hundred pounds.\n\nVINCENZO: No, a hundred pounds is not in...\n\nI can't do it.\n\nCHARLIE: Ten, I'm doing my best.\n\nVINCENZO: Yes, try your best.\n\nCHARLIE: A hundred...ten... Give me 120 and I'll give it as job lot CHARLIE: Tom, I think it's a good thing to do and I think we'll stand a good chance of making some reasonable profit.\n\nOne twenty?\n\nOne twenty.\n\nVINCENZO: It's a deal.\n\nTOM: Thanks very much.\n\nCHARLIE: Thank you.\n\nVO: The first deal of the day Â£120 for the job lot of cut glass jars.\n\nSmashing!\n\nVO: James and Emelia have spotted something rather unusual.\n\nJAMES: Look at these great carpet bags!\n\nEMILIA: I know!\n\nAren't they gorgeous?\n\nJAMES: Aren't they gorgeous?\n\nEMILIA: Wouldn't someone want that?\n\nVO: A set of Bedouin carpet bags.\n\nBedouin meaning, of course, people of the desert.\n\nVO: Traditionally these would have been used to carry and store a tribe's worldly possessions.\n\nJAMES: Feel the way underneath it's just a block of foam.\n\nI know but you could still have that in your house as something to sit on.\n\nYou could couldn't you.\n\nThey are fun aren't they?\n\nAren't they?\n\nI'd buy these from auction.\n\nJAMES: And you know, either side of a sofa or whatever they really are lovely.\n\nWell let's see how much we can get them for.\n\nJAMES: We'll have to ask about that one.\n\nVO: Genuine Bedouin, that's the spirit Emelia.\n\nEMILIA: How much are these things here?\n\nCuz I really love them.\n\nHundred pound, 120.\n\nA hundred and 120?\n\nAye.\n\nThat's expensive.\n\nVINCENZO: You could use it.\n\nEMILIA: Yeah.\n\nJAMES: It's a mighty big old carpet bag but I think it's quite expensive, isn't it?\n\nEMILIA: It's very expensive, are we going to look in other rooms first?\n\nI can give it you, Â£125.\n\nEMILIA: For the pair?\n\nFor the pair.\n\nFor the pair And I'll say more, cuz I'll give you the cushion as a present.\n\nOh my god, Vincenzo.\n\nThank you I think it's the furnishings of a Bedouin tent in one lot isn't it?\n\nEMILIA: I just really, really love these.\n\nJAMES: If you like them somebody else will like them.\n\nEMILIA: If I like them then I'll then be buying them in the auction as well.\n\nJAMES: No, you're precluded.\n\nOh right.\n\nVINCENZO: But I don't do delivery, eh?\n\nEMILIA: No, no delivery needed.\n\nEMILIA: Yeah, we're going for it.\n\nVINCENZO: Anyway.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nSo you got a deal.\n\nEMILIA: Thank you very much.\n\nI need you to change it to two tens.\n\nI haven't got a 10.\n\nI've only got twenties and fives, so I'll need to change it to two.\n\nJAMES: I haven't got a 10.\n\nSo buy something else.\n\nI knew it wouldn't be easy.\n\nJAMES: I know what, what if we put another twenty pounds in and we got the picture as well?\n\nOK, let's deal.\n\nI do it just for you and never again.\n\nJust for her.\n\nVincenzo!\n\nI need another hug now.\n\nEMILIA: Wow!\n\nNow, you'll carry change from now on won't you?\n\nJAMES: Come on!\n\nVINCENZO: OK.\n\nThank you, thank you James.\n\nVO: So after that hug fest, Emelia and James managed to buy the oil painting and the Bedouin carpet bags, with complimentary cushions, for the bargain price of Â£160.\n\nVO: Happy?\n\nTOM: Now, what about the radio?\n\nCHARLIE: I love it.\n\nI'm going to hide, but I think it's got to be, Tom, between you and me, Tom, sort of around a nifty fifty, if we were going to buy and I'd be right behind you.\n\nOK. VO: Tom's hoping that Ros will be on his wave length here.\n\nHa!\n\nI want to talk to you about general matters.\n\nYes, OK. And we might accidentally find ourselves quite near this radio.\n\nTOM: Cause I think it's really fun this radio.\n\nIt's kind of quite niche.\n\nI'm under instructions to make you a very... a risible offer of Â£50.\n\nIf you stretch it to 60?\n\n55?\n\nOK, you've got a deal.\n\nTOM: 55?\n\nWith the dog?\n\nROS: You can have the dog.\n\nOh bless you.\n\nROS: OK?\n\nTOM: Thank you so much!\n\nVO: Well they both got what they wanted.\n\nTom his radio and Ros a birthday kiss and the dog, well he's just a bonus.\n\nI think we should look out for some female shopkeepers, I think he stands a really good chance with buying off the ladies.\n\nWhereas I've gone past that stage I think.\n\nVO: Vincenzo has heard that Tom bought the radio and wants to be in on the action.\n\nI just heard that you bought the radio, can I buy from you?\n\nBuy the radio?\n\nYes, I'll offer you Â£75.\n\nTOM: Sounds good.\n\nCHARLIE: What did it cost?\n\nTOM: 55.\n\nCHARLIE: That's Â£20 profit.\n\nBefore we've even moved five foot from it You're a natural dealer!\n\nI don't know what you're doing acting.\n\nCHARLIE: May I suggest that we simply say that you can have the radio but Â£75 off the silver.\n\nSimple as that.\n\nTOM: You happy with that?\n\nVINCENZO: Yeah, happy with that.\n\nCHARLIE: So instead of Â£120 we get the silver for Â£45 and he gets the radio.\n\nBut I don't want the dogs.\n\nYou don't want the dog?\n\nHe doesn't want the dog.\n\nWe've got a free dog.\n\nTOM: We've got a free dog.\n\nVO: Yes you get the woofer for free, but Charlie, your math!\n\nThis new deal means you've paid Â£100 for the glass jars, just to let you know, mate.\n\nCHARLIE: While you've been away I've been adding up the individual prices on all those bits of silver.\n\nDo you think we're going to do alright?\n\nWell they come to Â£350 so that's two...

You keep it for yourself, because I've got my... No, no.\n\nBecause I've got my hat.\n\nAre you saying you don't want to come under my umbrella?\n\nNo, I'd love to.\n\nCHARLIE: Did you enjoy your first buying experience?\n\nTOM: Well, it was fascinating watching you at work.\n\nCHARLIE: The proof of the pudding though, Tom is in the eating.\n\nTOM: I know, I know.\n\nTOM: Well I shall shatter that dog over your head if it's not... (CHARLIE LAUGHS) TOM: My wife will tell you that I am terrible at haggling, pathetic English, English politeness you know?\n\nNo, no.\n\nI've learnt to over the years.\n\nI think if I was actually a dealer for a living I'd have gone bankrupt years ago.\n\nWhat do you think of it so far?!\n\nVO: Just in case Tom does pick up any mercenary habits along the way Charlie is bringing him somewhere which should help keep him on the straight and narrow.\n\nVO: As the first city in the UK to have its own police force, Glasgow prides itself on its long law and order history.\n\nCHARLIE: Right, best behavior I think here.\n\nVO: Today, Tom and Charles have come to meet a retired police officer, Alastair Dinsmor, a volunteer here at the Police Museum.\n\nHi.\n\nTom Wa...\n\nI'm Alastair Dinsmor.\n\nTom Ward.\n\nHow'd you do?\n\nALASTAIR: Tom Ward?\n\nAnd..?\n\nCHARLIE: Charlie Ross.\n\nCharlie Ross.\n\nWould you like to come in?\n\nCHARLIE: Love to!\n\nTOM: Thank you very much.\n\nVO: Alongside preserving the museum's vast collection, Alastair has been avidly amassing artefacts from forces worldwide since the 1960s.\n\nALASTAIR: We had policing from 1779, 29 years before Robert Peel's police in London.\n\nCHARLIE: Ah!\n\nALASTAIR: Because of the...American Revolution robbed Glasgow of its tobacco trade.\n\nSo why do we all hear about Robert Peel all the time and not about the..?\n\nWell, they've just got a good publicity department... TOM: Right.\n\nALASTAIR: ..down in the Met... And a good nickname - the peelers.\n\nALASTAIR: Yeah, yeah.\n\nVO: The reason Glasgow formed the first police force was to tackle the city's increasing crime rate.\n\nUnemployment in the city had risen sharply when Glasgow's tobacco merchants lost control of the export and redistribution of the amber leaf, following America's Declaration of Independence in 1776.\n\nVO: The city's magistrates, who had historically dealt with crime, were overwhelmed, and so in 1779, Glasgow formed the first police force in the UK.\n\nCHARLIE: Early criminals that were caught by that initial police force were condemned to death?\n\nWell, some of them.\n\nThere was about 40 crimes that you could be hung for.\n\nALASTAIR: We have an extract from a newspaper of 1824, and it was two 18 year olds being hung at Glasgow Cross for persistent housebreaking, and it was only later that the list was reduced greatly... Yeah.\n\n..and...from...through the government.\n\nVO: Since retiring, Alastair has been devoting his time to maintaining the museum's vast collection.\n\nThere are over 2,000 artefacts here, each one with its own story.\n\nWhilst Tom might have played a few heroes, Alastair has something earned by a real life one.\n\nALASTAIR: This is Britain's first police bravery medal.\n\nTOM: Right.\n\nIt's a substantial item, isn't it?!\n\nTOM: ..gold medal isn't it?\n\nALASTAIR: It's silver, it's beautifully made.\n\nTOM: I love that sort of two truncheons rampant!\n\nALASTAIR: Constable John Kerr was checking property in the Trongate in Glasgow here, and he went down Old Wynd, and this was on the 23rd of November, 1871, about quarter to five in the morning.\n\nHe saw a large crack in one of the buildings and realized, being an ex-fireman, that it was...it was in a dangerous situation, so he ran up the stairs and rescued 68 people from the three story building.\n\nALASTAIR: And he got them out into the street and he went back in to check it, and as he was leaving, the building collapsed.\n\nWow!\n\nFortunately, he was uninjured.\n\nSo the city gave him this medal, and the back of it has a beautiful inscription that outlines what he did.\n\nTOM: Beautifully told, in detail.\n\nVO: For Tom, this place is like a giant dressing-up box.\n\nTOM: Are these yours?\n\nALASTAIR: Yes, the...\n\nI started in 1966... TOM: Wow!\n\nALASTAIR: ..when I was a police cadet, and it's sort of got out of hand!\n\nTOM: It has!\n\nI'm...I'm thinking of taking it up seriously!\n\nHow many of you got?\n\nALASTAIR: I have two... 200 uniforms.\n\nTOM: 200 uniforms.\n\nFrom how many different countries?\n\nEh, from about 92 different countries.\n\nCHARLIE: Which country in the world has the most flamboyant police uniform?\n\nI would say that the ceremonial uniform of the Italian carabinieri takes a lot of beating.\n\nTOM: Which was the hardest one to get hold of?\n\nI would say the cap from North Korea was... TOM: Yes, I can see how that... CHARLIE: Yes.\n\nNow, Alastair, this fez, how did that appear in your collection?\n\nALASTAIR: Just like that!\n\nNo!\n\nVO: And that joke, absolutely criminal!\n\nThank you so much for showing us round, Alastair.\n\nMy pleasure, Charlie.\n\nThank you, Alastair.\n\nCould have talked to you all day.\n\nAbsolutely fascinating.\n\nVO: So, a respectable first foray into antiques finding.\n\nBut there is still much work to be done.\n\nGo and recharge, m'dears, for tomorrow the case of unearthing more treasures continues.\n\nNighty night.\n\nVO: It's a brand new day, and our bright young things and our experts are champing at the bit to be reunited for more feverish antiques finding.\n\nEMILIA: I think we were so lucky to get James and Charlie, weren't we?\n\nTOM: I think we've been very, very lucky, cuz they're both extremely nice and extremely funny and extremely expert.\n\nCHARLIE: I should think Emilia's probably quite a good negotiator, isn't she?\n\nJAMES: She is good, and she's got the eyes for it.\n\nCHARLIE: Oh, I bet she just flutters the eyelids and the price falls like a stone!\n\nEMILIA: And the other thing that I noticed about them is that they're not competitive with each other at all about it.\n\nHave you not seen the little wax dolls they've got of each other, with pins in them, no?\n\nCHARLIE: Tom is a complete delight.\n\nThe man showed considerable nous and dealing ability on his first day!\n\nJAMES: Marvelous.\n\nActually, can I auction you?\n\nEh... EMILIA: Now that is how I could make some money!\n\nVO: We're not doing a slave auction here, Emilia, although you might have a point!\n\nVO: Yesterday, our beautiful starlets flirted, foisted, and fluttered their eyelashes into the hearts of dealers in this, the most friendly city in Scotland.\n\nIt's Glasgow, by the way!\n\nVO: Emilia and James spent Â£202 and got something for everyone: a framed oil painting of a rural scene; a pair of Bedouin tribal bags with complimentary cushions; a 1970s Subbuteo football game set; and a Dinky ABC Television scanner truck, leaving them with Â£198 to spend today.\n\nGod, Vincenzo!\n\nVO: Lucky chap!\n\nPersonally, I can't wait to see what they buy!\n\nVO: Meanwhile, best buddies Tom and Charlie embarked on something of a shaggy dog story.\n\nRock it, Tom!\n\nVO: Tom fell in love with a vintage radio, only to have birthday girl Ros throw in a classy canine effigy.\n\nVO: Charlie haggled his heart out with Vincenzo, to get the contents of a glass cabinet.\n\nI just heard that you bought the radio.\n\nVO: Then Vincenzo wanted the radio, so Tom struck a deal, meaning they got all the glassware for Â£100.\n\nYou're a natural dealer!\n\nVO: Cor!\n\nThe dog was still free... Mwah!\n\nVO: ..and Ros got a birthday kiss, leaving them Â£300 to spend today.\n\nVO: Now, everyone is headed 15 miles west of Glasgow, to the charming village of Kilbarchan which has been designated as an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nVO: Gardner's antique center, here in Kilbarchan, is rammed with rarities for our investigation teams to uncover.\n\nTOM: Good morning!\n\nEMILIA: So, it's like Christmas, waking up to start again!\n\nJAMES: How are you?\n\nEMILIA: Hi.\n\nI've got a little pug!\n\nVO: Piled high with stunning antique pieces.\n\nthe trick is not to miss a treasure!\n\nCHARLIE: Walk round but walk round slowly.\n\nTOM: Right.\n\nCHARLIE: It's very easy when you're in a place like this which is full of fantastic things to walk down there, walk down there...\n\nYes.\n\n..walk down there, and you can miss something that you really like.\n\nIt's like hunting some little creature which might just be nestling two feet from you.\n\nCHARLIE: Yes, yes!\n\nSo you've got be... VO: Tom and Charlie - poised to pounce!\n\nDecorative items sell well.\n\nDecorative doesn't?\n\nJAMES: Does.\n\nEMILIA: Does.\n\nSo busts or that country house look, that's what they're after.\n\nEMILIA: I'm worried that my kitsch taste will get in the way!\n\nJAMES: No, no, no, we're fine.\n\nOh, I love this tea cozy!\n\nVO: No, Emilia - that's not kitsch at all!\n\nJAMES: How much is that?\n\n68.\n\nJAMES: Ooh, no!\n\nEMILIA: Huh?\n\nI know, I know!\n\nOK!\n\nJAMES: That's too expensive, isn't it?\n\nJAMES: Let's keep going.\n\nOh... EMILIA: Now, this is interesting, isn't it?\n\nJAMES: I like that.\n\nYou've got a good eye.\n\nIt's very...again, that lovely cranes, Japanese aesthetic, and it's made by Doulton.\n\nIt's very unusual.\n\nHow much is that?\n\n38?\n\nEMILIA: Are you pleased, then?\n\nJAMES: Definitely.\n\nEMILIA: OK.\n\nThank goodness!\n\nDefinitely.\n\nPhew!\n\nJAMES: You hang on to that.\n\nWe don't want the boys to grab that.\n\nSo let's keep that with us, and shall we have a quick look in the other room?\n\nTOM: Now, Charlie, what do you think of this?\n\nCHARLIE: I think there's one word here.\n\n\"Ghastly\" is... Oh, really?\n\nTOM: I just thought it was an unusual thing.\n\nThe kind of thing that an old lady might like in her conservatory, type, to carry...to have flowerpots on, you know, that kind of vibe.\n\nI think you're right but an old lady with a conservatory probably wouldn't pay more than a tenner for it, that's the trouble.\n\nI'm not in this for profit.\n\nI'm in it for making old ladies happy.\n\nThen, we'll have the tray... CHARLIE: Frankly, I'm up against it, if you're just in this for making old ladies happier!\n\nJAMES: We've almost covered the whole shop now.\n\nCHARLIE: Have you?\n\nYep.\n\nWe're doing breakneck speed.\n\nCHARLIE: Oh no, we've been much, much more selective, haven't we Tom?\n\nTOM: We have.\n\nTOM: Come and have a look at this.\n\nThat's great.\n\nIs it complete?\n\nThat's important.\n\nI don't know when, it's presumably, Enid Blyton, so that's... CHARLIE: Post-war.\n\nTOM: Post-war.\n\nCHARLIE: 1953 copyright.\n\nTOM: Right.\n\nCHARLIE: Chad Valley, great maker of toys, but what's fantastic here - I mean, this presumably was bought and given to somebody in the early 50s.\n\nTOM: And barely... CHARLIE: They haven't used it!\n\nTOM: No, that's always the great thing, isn't it?\n\nCHARLIE: Yes, it's wonderful.\n\nTOM: What are we looking at?\n\nCHARLIE: 100 quid?\n\nTOM: 80 quid we could get that for.\n\nI think that's collectable.\n\nI'm liking it.\n\nTOM: You're liking it?\n\nHe's liking it.\n\nFirst time for everything.\n\nYep.\n\nI'm just, I was going to pop it one side.\n\nTOM: And what I'll now do is drop it - there we are.\n\nCHARLIE: Don't drop it!\n\nJAMES: Let's have a look round these two rooms and see if we can find a nice ceramic that we both like.\n\nEMILIA: I'm just going to give you some options.\n\nJAMES: OK. EMILIA: OK?\n\nThis.\n\nYep.\n\nEMILIA: That.\n\nJAMES: Yep.\n\nEMILIA: That.\n\nEMILIA: What about over here?\n\nJAMES: No.\n\nEMILIA: We've nearly been round all the rooms again.\n\nJAMES: I know, but it's amazing what you see on the second journey, isn't it?\n\nEMILIA: What about that?\n\nJAMES: That's interesting, isn't it?\n\nGreat shape.\n\nEMILIA: Isn't it?\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nThat's what - I would love to have that at home.\n\nJAMES: Yeah.\n\nVO: An old chemist's bottle used to store ammonia.\n\nBecause of its antiseptic and corrosive qualities, domestically in the old days it would have been used mainly for cleaning purposes.\n\nJAMES: And you can see how the label, they've put the label on the bottom, so it would have been on those fabulous chemist's shelves, wouldn't it?\n\nEMILIA: And there is a bit of damage there, but actually if you had it on a high shelf, you might not notice.\n\nJAMES: And how much is it with said damage?\n\nTo us, Â£68.\n\nSo that's not bad, is it?\n\nJAMES: So in a way, the break has given us the opportunity of purchase.\n\nEMILIA: I mean gosh, it's... JAMES: Can you see it?\n\nEMILIA: ..jewel-like purple, isn't it?\n\nJAMES: It's nightclub purple, isn't it?\n\nShall we go for them?\n\nYes, but can we, can we, get anything, fit anything else in?\n\nJAMES: No.\n\nVO: Co-owner David Gardner is happy to help.\n\nDAVID: I think really with the damage it's really a showy thing now rather... JAMES: It is, yeah.\n\nDAVID: It's a display thing.\n\nJAMES: Emilia, you're missing these pearls of wisdom here.\n\nEMILIA: I'm still searching!\n\nI'm just going to come and present to you with more things.\n\nWhy did you like this Emilia?\n\nI think it's such an unusual shape.\n\nJAMES: It is, it's a great shape, isn't it?\n\nDAVID: Ewer, from a basin and ewer set.\n\nEMILIA: I think it will fit in with almost any interior.\n\nJAMES: I think that's a great lot.\n\nCome on David, what's the trade on this?\n\nDAVID: They're 32 and 68, so you've got Â£100 there.\n\nÂ£100.\n\nYou happy?\n\nVery.\n\nWe've got Â£100.\n\nWell spent.\n\nJAMES: Well spent indeed.\n\nDAVID: Yes.\n\nWe've bought very individual lots that'll stand out.\n\nThey'll either...\n\nI think they could do quite well.\n\nVO: \"They'll either\" what James?\n\nDecided not to finish the sentence, eh?\n\nWell, time will tell.\n\nJAMES: You're teaching me, you're teaching me.\n\nEMILIA: No!\n\nJAMES: You're teaching me.\n\nEMILIA: Absolutely not!\n\nI'm driving you mad.\n\nTOM: Everyone loves a nice light.\n\nCHARLIE: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.\n\nIt's not dear, is it?\n\n38 quid?\n\nCHARLIE: There's one thing: selling things at auction, you can't sell them with plugs on, because if somebody buys it in an auction room, it's got a plug on, plug it in, stick the fingers in there, electrocute themselves, sue the saleroom, thank you very much.\n\nTOM: Right, OK, fine.\n\nCHARLIE: What was Noddy, 80?\n\nTOM: 80.\n\nAnd this is 38.\n\nTOM: Get it for 110, the whole lot?\n\nI like that.\n\nTOM: Yeah, go on.\n\n100 would be better - I mean 110!\n\nCHARLIE: Shall I leave it to you?\n\nTOM: Yeah, I thought you would.\n\nOK.\n\nI've also seen, because I'm on a roll with you now - see, I've caught you in one of your rare good moods.\n\nI'm going to... Have you ever seen me in a bad mood?\n\nWhat?\n\nI don't know yet.\n\nI don't want to be there when it happens.\n\nCHARLIE: Come and show me.\n\nTOM: Come and look.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nTOM: This is a pair, which I know always sends you into giddy ecstasy.\n\nOf... what?\n\nCHARLIE: Japanese.\n\nCreamware.\n\nThey're enamel decorated.\n\nThey are into the 20th century, but not by a great deal, I would say they're 1910, 1920.\n\nTOM: Right.\n\nSo 100 years old.\n\nCHARLIE: Simulated bamboo handles, which I quite like.\n\nTOM: Yes.\n\nThey are, by Japanese standards, poor quality.\n\nTOM: Poor quality.\n\nWell no, that's rude - average quality is a better word.\n\nCHARLIE: But if they weren't, they'd be 1,500 quid's worth, this size.\n\nTOM: Right.\n\nCHARLIE: Nice geisha girls.\n\nTOM: Alright, keep it clean.\n\nCHARLIE: Peonies.\n\nLotus blossom.\n\nYou've got everything you need in Japan.\n\nIt's 90 quid.\n\nYep.\n\nTOM: I think if we do the Noddy...

Well we can ask David.\n\nDavid?\n\nHow good's your math?\n\nTOM: 38 for this.\n\nCHARLIE: Yep.\n\n90 for that is 128.\n\nCHARLIE: Yep.\n\nTOM: 80 for that would be 208 in total as per tag.\n\nYep.\n\nSounds like 200 quid to me, doesn't it?\n\nI think it does, sounds quite like 200 quid.\n\nYeah.\n\nDoes it sound like 200 quid?\n\nWe couldn't manage Â£200 I'm afraid, no.\n\nDoesn't sound like 200 quid.\n\nNo, it doesn't.\n\nSounds like Â£208.\n\nCHARLIE: Sounds like Â£208!\n\nTOM: Sounds exactly like Â£208.\n\nTOM: Thanks for putting us straight.\n\nYeah, my pleasure.\n\nCHARLIE: Are you happy?\n\nTOM: I'm happy.\n\nYou happy?\n\nThat's tremendous, thank you David.\n\nDAVID: Absolutely, thank you.\n\nCHARLIE: Well done partner.\n\nVO: After a fairly hapless attempt at haggling, Tom and James are paying the ticket price for everything: Â£80 for the Noddy tea set, Â£38 for the cutglass table lamp and Â£90 for the pair of Japanese vases, bringing their total to Â£208.\n\nJAMES: I admire your tenacity.\n\nYou were in there, and you wanted to spend absolutely everything.\n\nAnd you almost did.\n\nWell I'm a terrier!\n\nEMILIA: So do you think we could have a new show together called \"Shop Till You Drop\"?\n\nJAMES: \"Shop Till You Drop\" or \"Fill The Van\".\n\nEMILIA: \"Fill The Van\".\n\nVO: Taking a break from their object finding mission, James has brought Emilia to an exhibition in Glasgow's Trongate building called \"Sharmanka: Kinetic theater\" by Russian-born artist Eduard Barsudski.\n\nEduard specializes in using found and hand-carved objects which perform an enchanting choreography to haunting music, telling funny and tragic stories of the human spirit.\n\nJAMES: It's an amazing space, isn't it?\n\nVO: James and Emilia have come to meet Eduard's right-hand woman, Tatyana Jakovskaya.\n\nHello!\n\nHello.\n\nTATYANA: Welcome to Sharmanka.\n\nHello.\n\nJames.\n\nHello.\n\nHello James.\n\nEMILIA: Emilia.\n\nTATYANA: Emilia.\n\nVO: Friend, collaborator and art critic, Tatyana co-founded Sharmanka with Eduard in 1988 in St Petersburg, and is still the theater's director today.\n\nTATYANA: \"Sharmanka\" in Russian means \"barrel organ\", \"hurdy-gurdy\".\n\nIt's also a symbol of things going in circle.\n\nJAMES: I see.\n\nTATYANA: So here in the west you believe in the progress, and you know, east believes that everything goes in circles.\n\nVO: There are currently 35 sculptures by Eduard Barsudski on display here, and several more are out touring the country.\n\nVO: Aside from training briefly to be an electrician, Eduard has no mechanical training.\n\nTATYANA: I met him 25 years ago in St Petersburg, Russia.\n\nA friend brought me to his flat - not really flat, room - and in this room, I saw all these machines.\n\nJAMES: Really?\n\nTATYANA: He lived among them on something which was his armchair daytime, and his bed at night.\n\nVO: The first found objects Eduard used were bits of carved furniture from pre-revolution Russia, which, when he first started to make these sculptures, were being discarded by everyone in favor of modern furniture.\n\nVO: Fleeing from Communist oppression in the USSR, Eduard came to Scotland in 1993, desperate to continue telling his stories through the medium of mechanic sculptures.\n\nVO: This is the first piece Eduard made here, and is affectionately named \"Jock's Jokes\", after a rather amusing chimney sweep he met called Jock Redburn.\n\nTATYANA: He collected all beautiful scrap, industrial scrap, and he would not allow anybody to use anything of this, until he saw photographs of Eduard's kinemats.\n\nSo they found each other after each other's own heart.\n\nTATYANA: They found each other, yes.\n\nEMILIA: I mean, they're just utterly extraordinary pieces.\n\nWas he fascinated by time?\n\nBy clocks?\n\nBy watches?\n\nI don't know why they keep appearing.\n\nTATYANA: Yes, of course.\n\nI think that it's kind of feeling that old objects keep touches of people who use them.\n\nVO: This piece is called \"Titanic\", and was made in 1994 for a major exhibition in Glasgow.\n\nIt was later bought to be one of the central pieces for the opening ceremony of Glasgow's Museum of Modern Art.\n\nTATYANA: We have to step over, so be, please, be very, very careful.\n\nJAMES: This is no time for comic trips!\n\nOh!\n\nJames...!\n\nTATYANA: This is butter churn, became heart of \"Titanic\".\n\nAnd I think that name \"Titanic\" came from this bell... EMILIA: That's gorgeous.\n\nTATYANA: ..which was bought in Belgium.\n\nAs a joke, we ask seller \"is it real one from Titanic?\"\n\nand he go \"yes, of course, I have many of them!\"\n\nEMILIA: It's such a wonderful merging of mechanics and theater, isn't it?\n\nJAMES: Yeah.\n\nEMILIA: And I love the way you describe it, with a heart.\n\nJAMES: Yeah.\n\nIt sort of gives it its life.\n\nEduard thinks that it's not so much he is making them, they just make themselves, he just help them into existence.\n\nJAMES: This is amazing.\n\nYou sit there.\n\nVO: The passion and originality with which Eduard Barsudski started making his kinemat is ever present today, and with Eduard now 72, still working six days a week on making more and more of these fantastic creations, we can look forward to many more mechanical marvels to come.\n\nVO: And sailing towards their last shop of the trip, Tom and Charlie are almost home and dry.\n\nCHARLIE: One more shop.\n\nTOM: One more shop.\n\nWe're in quite good shape.\n\nWe can relax.\n\n(THUNDER) CHARLIE: Gah!\n\nWhat about this?\n\nHave you seen rain like this?!\n\nLook at it!\n\nVO: Oh dear.\n\nLooks like you spoke too soon about the dry bit anyway.\n\nTOM: We're taking in water, guv'nor.\n\nCHARLIE: Woah!\n\nMy God!\n\nHa ha!\n\nCHARLIE: I'm sitting in three inches of water!\n\nCHARLIE: I thought the Clyde had burst.\n\nTOM: The Clyde, I know.\n\n(BOTH SING THEME FROM \"DAMBUSTERS\") CHARLIE: How's the rear gunner sir?\n\nTOM: Haven't heard from him since Calais, I'm afraid.\n\nTOM: Come on.\n\nVO: Ha!\n\nTom and a rather soggy Charlie have come to Glasgow City Antiques, hoping to find something which will help make a splash at the auction.\n\nCHARLIE: Hello!\n\nHow are you?\n\nDEALER: Fine, thank you.\n\nI've had an accident.\n\nDEALER: Are you wet?\n\nDo you want a towel?\n\nI don't think there's anything a towel can do, my dear.\n\nVO: It's only water Charlie - you won't melt.\n\nWith a number of traders housed under one roof, there's tons to see.\n\nI've never actually dried my bottom with a hairdryer before, and it's got a certain... je ne sais quoi.\n\nVO: Hmm, Charlie, you are awful.\n\nAh, look, there he - there he is.\n\nTOM: The whiff of the antiques gets him pointing.\n\nYou're still doing a little bit of that, aren't you?\n\nStill doing a little bit of that.\n\nI'm drying out slowly.\n\nTOM: You're shaking yourself out.\n\nCHARLIE: Have you seen anything you can't live without?\n\nBOTH: \"Christian Dior collar\".\n\nTOM: Is that fashionable these days?\n\nCHARLIE: I don't know.\n\nYou're at the cutting edge of fashion.\n\nAm I?\n\nYeah.\n\nName is great.\n\nTOM: Fifties is kind of glam.\n\nThere you are sir.\n\nJust half close your eyes and imagine I'm beautiful and female.\n\nTOM: And you've got a flower on your head.\n\nNot wearing glasses, with hair.\n\nI'm an imaginative man, but I think even my... VO: Stop larking around you two.\n\nYou need to find your last lot.\n\nCHARLIE: There.\n\nRather classical, Wedgwood, black basalt brooch.\n\nTOM: Brooch.\n\nThat's rather lovely, actually.\n\nCHARLIE: It's gorgeous.\n\nTOM: Shall we have a look?\n\nCHARLIE: Now just check if it says Wedgwood.\n\nTOM: It does say Wedgwood.\n\nCHARLIE: That's promising.\n\nVO: Trader John is acting as go-between, as the dealer who owns the brooch is a bit camera shy.\n\nCHARLIE: Would he know if that's gold or not?\n\nGive me two minutes and I'll find out for you.\n\nCould you ask him?\n\nI think it's a really interesting...\n\nIt's marked up at Â£100.\n\nJOHN: Right, OK. TOM: That's exactly the kind of thing I can see my mother-in-law wearing.\n\nShe's a very stylish...\n\nElegant lady.\n\nElegant...woman.\n\nIt's the sort of word you have to use about mother-in-laws.\n\nI know, I said it quickly.\n\nCHARLIE: It's wonderful quality.\n\nTOM: Yeah.\n\nSir.\n\nDavid, John - nearly called you David, that wouldn't have helped, would it?\n\nTOM: No.\n\nRight.\n\nIt's been tested as gold.\n\nCHARLIE: It has.\n\nTOM: And how old?\n\nWe thought it's about... CHARLIE: About 100 years old.\n\nJOHN: About 100 years old.\n\nCHARLIE: Black, death, Queen Victoria.\n\nOh, I see what you're getting at.\n\nCHARLIE: There were a lot of things around about 1900 that were ebonized, the furniture was ebonized, in other words blackened, for obvious reasons.\n\nI mean, from the death of Albert rather than Queen Victoria.\n\nWhen she went into black, everything went into black!\n\nCHARLIE: So what's the... to use a horrible expression, death on it?\n\nHis definite bottom line's Â£70.\n\nCHARLIE: Â£70.\n\nI think 70 quid, that's a bargain.\n\nWe think we'd like to buy that please, John.\n\nCHARLIE: John, thank you very much indeed.\n\nIt's very wet I'm afraid, my money.\n\nWell we've got 22 quid left over for a towel.\n\nCHARLIE: Do you think you'd want to put a towel in the auction having wiped my body down with it?\n\nThat would enhance its value about 25,000%.\n\nVO: Well, the boys are pinning their hopes on the brooch being a gem at auction, and having paid Â£70 for it, I'm keeping everything crossed.\n\nVO: And now for the moment of truth, when they must reveal what they've each bought.\n\nCome on, go on.\n\nLet's get on with it.\n\nLet's see what you've bought.\n\nCHARLIE: Bought a lot.\n\nJAMES: That is a lot!\n\nWow!\n\nCHARLIE: Have we bought a lot!\n\nTOM: We have bought a lot.\n\nJAMES: Come on.\n\nTOM: This is a Noddy tea set, Chad Valley, which apparently is good.\n\nYep.\n\nAnd we bought this sort of crystal based lamp, which we got for 38 quid I think.\n\nEMILIA: What's the history of that lamp?\n\nTOM: I bought it today, that's all the history I know.\n\nEMILIA: I need some lamps at home, so... CHARLIE: Marvelous, that's a buyer!\n\nTOM: And then we've got these, which are apparently quite average but quite nice, presentable Japanese turn of the last century... CHARLIE: 1920s probably, Satsuma.\n\nBut that's our best buy I think.\n\nJAMES: Now what is that?\n\nCHARLIE: It's a Wedgwood, 19th century Wedgwood brooch, mounted with gold.\n\nEMILIA: That's beautiful.\n\nCHARLIE: Paid 70 quid.\n\nVery good.\n\nCHARLIE: Yeah.\n\nJames, are you worried?\n\nNo, we're fine.\n\nPut it down.\n\nWhy do you look so worried?\n\nNo, I'm not worried.\n\nWell done.\n\nJAMES: This is what we've bought.\n\nThat's fantastic.\n\nJAMES: That's our rather nice ammonia.\n\nCHARLIE: That's fabulous.\n\nJAMES: Our chemist's jar.\n\nTOM: That's a great thing.\n\nCHARLIE: Hang on, by your finger, is there a little bit of a bijou damagette there?\n\nBut undamaged I would say that's Â£300, so how much was it going?\n\nAnd with damage?\n\nWith damage, well, I dunno - 12 quid?\n\nI'm only joking!\n\nHe's a rotter.\n\nThat's cruel.\n\nWatch my face.\n\n75.\n\nAlmost spot on - 68.\n\nI like that very much.\n\nTOM: That's really lovely.\n\nOur big ticket item was the sort of the contents of a Bedouin tent here.\n\nCHARLIE: Yeah.\n\nI did have a feel inside, they aren't actually chunks inside, are they?\n\nThey're sponge rubber.\n\nSponge rubber.\n\nNo, but you can fill them with whatever you want!\n\nYou can!\n\nYou can put anything you like in them.\n\nAnd then you can use them as... JAMES: Soft furnishings.\n\nEMILIA: Exactly.\n\nJAMES: Well done - defend your corner!\n\nI will!\n\nI love those.\n\nJAMES: So we bought that.\n\nCHARLIE: Ohh... JAMES: Brand of... Is that a Corgi or a Dinky?\n\nDinky.\n\nLoved the way you said \"Dinky\" there like that.\n\nQuick as a flash, \"Dinky\".\n\nCHARLIE: Didn't have to think, did he?\n\nDon't have Corgi where we are!\n\nCHARLIE: Right!\n\nJAMES: Right!\n\nJAMES: Well done.\n\nSee you there.\n\nTOM: See you at the auction.\n\nVO: But how convinced were they really about what each other had bought?\n\nVO: With these actors, sometimes you know it's hard to tell.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nCHARLIE: The whole thing's gonna hinge really on that Bedouin.\n\nI could see those in west London going into a smart flat for hundreds of pounds.\n\nJAMES: I'm not mad about the dog.\n\nAnd I'm not mad about those vases, but someone will be, won't they?\n\nThey will be.\n\nTOM: I love that huge bottle.\n\nLove that huge bottle.\n\nI think the fact that the top's been off it... You think that might struggle.\n\nI think it's important.\n\nThe only big threat, I think, from them is that fabulous collection of 12 silver topped bottles.\n\nEMILIA: Hmm.\n\nAll's fair in love and war.\n\nI think it's just gonna boil down to Bedouin versus brooch.\n\nCome on, let's go and have a beer.\n\nVO: Well, it's time to leave the delights of Bonnie Scotland and head 450 miles south to the beauty of Billingshurst in West Sussex, for that all-important auction.\n\nTOM: Are you nervous or are you excited?\n\nEMILIA: I'm quite excited and I'm a bit nervous about whether anyone is actually going to bid.\n\nTOM: I think people will think, \"ah, if Emilia Fox likes this then I must buy it.\"\n\nCHARLIE: Confident of making a profit?\n\nJAMES: I think so.\n\nCHARLIE: I'm just expecting profit after profit after profit.\n\nJAMES: Should be a slam dunk shouldn't it?\n\nVO: Quite right chaps.\n\nThat's the kind of confidence that gets you far in life.\n\nVO: Bellmans auctioneers have been auctioning fine art, antiques and collectables for over 20 years.\n\nTOM: Here we are.\n\nCHARLIE: The moment of truth JAMES: The moment of truth One fifty!\n\nVO: And we have eagle-eyed auctioneer Will Pasfield to give us his verdict on what's on the table.\n\nWILL: First of all it's a St Bernard.\n\nWhat we need to do is find two people who love St Bernards to get them bidding against each other.\n\nI think, my personal favorite item is the wet drug jar but the big chip on the neck is going to affect the price.\n\nWILL: The cut glass table lamp I think's going to be a little bit of a tricky sale.\n\nwe're going to be lucky if we get Â£10 for it.\n\nThe pair of Bedouin tribal bag seats and the other cushions as well; we've never sold anything like it before but I'll see what I can do.\n\nVO: Both teams started with Â£400 each.\n\nEmilia and James spent three Â£302 on an array of erm... goodies.\n\nSix things in total which are now organized into six auction lots.\n\nJAMES: Come on!\n\nVO: And by nefarious means, Charlie and Tom have ended up with six auction lots and spent a total of Â£378.\n\nMwah!\n\nVO: Take your seats.\n\nEyes front.\n\nThe auction is about to begin.\n\nBefore we start, I just want to say, good luck.\n\nGood luck.\n\nCHARLIE: Here we go, here we go.\n\nVO: First up, it's Emilia and James's football game.\n\nIt's not fair.\n\nEveryone's holding hands except for me.\n\nI feel like I'm...
