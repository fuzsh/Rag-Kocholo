        "text": "TV presenter Charlie Webster has also lent her voice to highlight how the charity supports women and girls living in some of the poorest parts of the world.\n\nWebster, who three years ago revealed that she was sexually assaulted as a teenager, said: \"Women around the world continue to have their voices silenced, their identity taken away from them and their bodies violated in the most horrific way.\n\n\"It is up to all of us to stop this from happening. This is a violation of everyone's fundamental human right to life.\n\nWomen around the world continue to have their voices silenced\n\nCharlie Webster\n\n\"I haven't been through what I have to sit and watch it and much worse continue to happen to others.\"\n\nFashion and beauty blogger Tanya Burr said she wanted to take part in the film, which was made for International Women's Day on March 8, to \"stand in solidarity with women and girls around the world\" but also to encourage others to do so.\n\nShe said: \"Fighting for women's rights is fighting for human rights. Now is the time for people to raise their voices, not just for International Women's Day but every day.\"\n\nThe ActionAid Commitments underpin the work that ActionAid does globally, working with the world's poorest, most marginalised women and girls to challenge the root causes of poverty and injustice.\n\nThey support women and girls to understand their rights, to challenge laws that prevent women from owning land and to end harmful practices such as female genital mutilation.\n\nGirish Menon, chief executive of ActionAid UK, said: \"Women's rights are under threat globally. We know from our work on the ground building coalitions across borders that we are stronger when we come together.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
