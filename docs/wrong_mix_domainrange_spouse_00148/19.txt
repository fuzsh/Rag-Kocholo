She describes herself as an old-fashioned romantic, but actress Emilia Fox has issued what some might take to be a coded ultimatum to her boyfriend of three years, chef Marco Pierre White.

In a new interview, the Silent Witness star makes it clear she ‘absolutely’ wants to get married and have more children.

Yet her dream is complicated by the fact her partner is still married to his estranged third wife, and has shown no urgency about getting a divorce.

Fox, 40, has just returned from visiting Ethiopia with the charity ActionAid, and says it opened her eyes to the joys of a larger family. She already has a four-year-old daughter, Rose, from a relationship with lawyer Jeremy Gilley and was married to actor Jared Harris, of Mad Men fame, for five years.

‘When I was in Ethiopia and saw families with siblings who look after each other, I thought how we can get caught up in our work. But what is more important than family life? So, yes, I would love more children,’ she told Good Housekeeping magazine. She said she had ‘a lovely marriage’ to Harris, but added: ‘I would love to [wed again]. Absolutely.’

It is unclear what 53-year-old Pierre White, who already has three failed marriages behind him, thinks about the idea. In February, he said: ‘I love Emilia, but I still love my wife too.’

Friends say they are still ‘very much together’.

He is still married to Spanish-born Mati Conejero, even though they have been separated for nearly a decade. She is mother to three of his four children – and is his business partner, which may make a split financially complex.
