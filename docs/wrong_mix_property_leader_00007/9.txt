Let's build on Nkrumah's foundation - Kufuor

Former President John Agyakum Kufuor has urged Ghanaians to build on the foundation that Dr. Kwame Nkrumah established for the country.

Mr. J.A. Kufuor noted that the late Dr. Nkrumah must be remembered with the respect he deserved, as an important part of the Ghana’s history.

Mr. Kufuor made the observation in an interview on Joy FM’s “Cosmopolitan Mix” programme on Friday, 21st September, 2012, co-hosted by NDC Member of Parliament for Adetan, Kojo Adu Asare and Deputy Director of the NPP’s Communication Team, Samuel Awuku.

The 21st of September, which is the day Ghana’s first President was born, is christened Founders’ Day, to celebrate the role he and his colleagues played to ensure that Ghana and Africa gained political independence from colonial rule.

The former President said Dr. Nkrumah being the first Prime Minister of Ghana, first President of the Republic, has earned a place in African and world history.

Meanwhile Mr. Kufuor has expressed optimism in the current generation saying he believes the mainstream of the youth will do well for the country.

“There are wayward youth everywhere, but I believe the mainstream of our youth will do well in due course,” he remarked.
