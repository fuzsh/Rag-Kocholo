        "text": "In the fall of 2021, Senior Landecker Fellow Vincent Kadiri was named a Mercator Fellow specializing in International Affairs. In the context of this Fellowship, Vincent has spent months ploughing through materials to bring to life a new virtual exhibition titled The Literary Life of Kwame Nkrumah. The exhibition will mark the 50th anniversary of the death of Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana and the revolutionary Pan-Africanist regarded by many as one of Africa’s greatest politicians.\n\nIn this quick-fire interview published by the Library Of Africa and The African Diaspora, Vincent uncovers his process and what he learnt. As he explains, the exhibition is highly relevant in the 21st century as it seems that only little has changed in the Global North-South power dynamics since the 1950s and 1960s. “The way out is only forward, forward to a higher and reconciled form of society, in which the quintessence of the human purposes of traditional African society reasserts itself in a modern context,” Vincent adds.\n\nFor anyone who wishes to (virtually) visit The Literary Life of Kwame Nkrumah, the virtual exhibition is available here.\n\nThe intention is to keep the online exhibition as a living public document to which people can suggest edits and exhibits. In the near future, Vincent would also like to contribute to an in-person event with lively debates on Nkrumah’s legacy. To stay updated on his endeavors, follow Vincent on LinkedIn."
