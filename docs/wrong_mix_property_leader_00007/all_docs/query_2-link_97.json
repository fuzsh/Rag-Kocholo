        "text": "Portia Ankamah Lartey is a self motivated individual who believes she can achieve anything she puts her mind to. She is Ghanaian and has completed three years of studying Civil Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. Her greatest achievement to date was gaining admission to Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. She excelled in her studies which allowed her the opportunity to become a Mastercard Foundation Scholar at Arizona State University pursuing her Master’s degree. She believes this new chapter in her life will enable her to develop herself as an individual and build her as a transformative leader. Having gone through the challenge of deciding on a career path at tertiary level, she mentors secondary school dropouts in her community to identify their potential and not necessarily follow the crowd. She envisions a world where girls in developing countries are empowered to achieve their dreams through education. In the near future, she hopes to create an empowerment center which will connect women from different fields of study to young girls who want to know about their future career and its progressions. She wants to be a transport engineer in the future to contribute to Ghana's development. Her experiences as an intern at urban roads where she supervised a road construction project in her community gave her the drive to advance her knowledge in that field of study. She loves music and believes that the core values which shaped her decisions thus far are: determination, self discipline and a positive attitude towards everything she does."
