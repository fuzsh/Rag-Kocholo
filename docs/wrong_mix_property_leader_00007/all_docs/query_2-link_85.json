It was officially opened on January 22, 1952 with 200 teacher training students transferred from Achimota College. In October 1952, the School of Engineering and the Department of Commerce were established.\n\nIn 1953, a Pharmacy Department was established, and a Department of Agriculture was opened to provide courses for the Ministry of Agriculture. A Department of General Studies was also instituted to prepare students for Higher School Certificate Examinations.\n\nIn 1957, the School of Architecture, Town Planning and Building was inaugurated, and its first students were admitted in January 1958. As the college expanded, it was decided to make KNUST a purely science and technology institution. In pursuit of this policy, the Teacher Training College was transferred to Winneba Training College and the Commerce Department was transferred to Achimota.\n\nKNUST is now a leading university in Ghana and offers a wide range of courses in science, technology, engineering, and the humanities. It is a major contributor to the economic and social development of Ghana.\n\nGallery\n\nLearn about the Partner\n\nStay informed.\n\nOur Scholars\n\nMeet the Team\n\nScroll with the left and right arrow keys\n\nCollaborative Research: Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning & Adaptation (MELA) @ Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nCollaborative Research: Needs Assessment Research (NAR) Baseline Study @ Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nCorporate Health Entrepreneurship\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nEpidemiology for Entrepreneurs\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Business Research Methods\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Ecosystem\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Financing\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Innovation and New Venture Creation\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Innovation Hub (H2i) @ KNUST\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Policy and Services Management\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nHealth Services Marketing\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nHealth Supply Chain Management\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nIntroduction to Community Emergency Care\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nIntroduction to Emergency Preparedness and Response to Pandemics\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nIntroduction to Healthcare Quality Improvement for Health Professionals\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nIntroduction to Palliative Care\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nIntroduction to Pre-Hospital Emergency Care\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nLeaders in Health: Global Nursing Program\n\nUniversity of Toronto\n\nMPH/ MSc. in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nMSc in Health Entrepreneurship\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nPhD in Field Epidemiology & Biostatistics\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nPhD in Non-Communicable Diseases\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nPostgraduate Training Program in Health Entrepreneurship\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nQuantitative Analysis for Decision Making\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nSocial Entrepreneurship\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nStrategic Management and Leadership in Health\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nTrain the Entrepreneur\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nVirtual Public-Private-Partner Universities (3PUs) Entrepreneurship Training\n\nKwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology\n\nScroll with the left and right arrow keys\n\nPalliative Care Short Course Field Report\n\nScroll with the left and right arrow keys\n\nInnovative Solutions for Healthcare Challenges: Youth-Driven Ventures Transforming Access to Medical Services in Africa\n\nThe University of Toronto is pleased to invite you to attend the session of the Health in Africa Series, entitled “Innovative Solutions for Healthcare Challenges: Youth Driven Ventures Transforming Access to Medical Services in Africa”.
