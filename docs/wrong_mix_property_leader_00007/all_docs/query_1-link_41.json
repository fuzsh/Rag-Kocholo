        "text": "This article draws on a Kleinian psychoanalytic reading of Hegel’s theory of the struggle for recognition to explore the role of international misrecognition in the creation of state subjectivity. It focuses on Ghana’s early years, when international relations were powerfully conceptualised and used by Kwame Nkrumah in his bid to bring coherence to a fragile infant state. Nkrumah attempted to create separation and independence from the West on the one hand, and intimacy with a unified Africa on the other. By creating juxtapositions between Ghana and these idealised international others, he was able to create a fantasy of a coherent state, built on a fundamental misrecognition of the wider world. As the fantasy bumped up against the realities of Ghana’s failing economy, fractured social structures, and complex international relationships, it foundered, causing alienation and despair. I argue that the failure of this early fantasy was the start of Ghana’s quest to begin processes of individuation and subjectivity, and that its undoing was an inevitable part of the early stages of misrecognition, laying the way for more grounded struggles for recognition and the development of a more complex state-subjectivity.\n\n16 I am not a historian of Ghana and I draw therefore on the historical accounts of others to support my broader theoretical and methodological argument. Many of these accounts fit within a complex ideological topography. Ghana, the first African country to become independent, was a magnet for an early generation of Africanist scholars who, as Jeffrey Ahlman writes in a recent account of the period, were drawn into an ideological ‘tug-of-war’ cast either as a ‘struggle between the “modern and the “traditional”, in the case of modernization-minded figures … or as one of revolutionary versus reactionary’: Jeffrey S. Ahlman, Living with Nkrumahism: Nation, State and Pan-Africanism in Ghana (Ohio: Ohio University Press, 2017), p. 10. Academic accounts always fall within the particular ideological bent of their authors, but those of this period of early African independence are particularly ideological – indeed, many academics became part of the political landscape themselves, acting as advisors or sympathetic cheerleaders for Nkrumah and the Convention People’s Party (CPP). It is interesting in the context of the argument presented in this article that Ghanaian politics was at the time seen as so clearly dichotomised – and this is a trend that continues, notably with Ali Mazrui’s description of ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ Nkrumahism. Ali Mazrui, Nkrumah’s Legacy and Africa’s Triple Heritage between Globalisation and Counter-Terrorism (Accra: Ghana University Press, 2004).\n\n17 Unlike her contemporary, Jacques Lacan, Klein does not draw on Hegel and neither, as far as I am aware, do any of her followers. The connections between Klein and Hegel made in this article are mine and build on earlier work: Gallagher, Julia, Zimbabwe’s International Relations: Fantasy and Reality in the Making of the State (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2017)CrossRefGoogle Scholar ; Julia Gallagher, ‘Creating a state: a Kleinian reading of recognition in Zimbabwe’s regional relationships’, European Journal of International Relations (2015), available at: doi: 10.1177/1354066115588204, pp. 1–24. In fact, Klein’s work has rarely been applied to political and social questions, possibly because she did virtually nothing in these directions herself, choosing to keep her ideas in their clinical context. For two notable exceptions, see Segal, Hanna, Psychoanalysis, Literature and War: Papers 1972–1995 (Abingdon: Routledge, 1997)Google Scholar ; Alford, C. Fred, Melanie Klein and Critical Social Theory: An Account of Politics, Art and Reason based on her Psychoanalytic Theory (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989)Google Scholar .\n\n35 Saburi Oladeni Biobaku, Secretary to the Premier, Western Region, Nigeria wrote: ‘We think it a matter of the highest priority to develop our people and our resources, to “modernize” in the phraseology of Professor Rostow; when we achieve this we shall invest the African personality with a potency that is bound to be respected everywhere, and our influence in the community of nations will be real, not superficial.’ Saburi Oladeni Biobaku, ‘Comments’, in American Society of African Culture (ed.), Pan-Africanism Reconsidered, pp. 129–32 (p. 131).\n\n45 Apter describes Nkrumah acting as the ‘nucleus of unity’ for Ghana as it attempted to create new institutions and abolish old ones. Apter, David, Ghana in Transition (New York: Atheneum, 1972), p. 274 Google Scholar . Kwaku Larbi Korang, in a fascinating discussion of Nkrumah’s depiction of his early life, shows how he portrayed himself as both embodiment and enabler of the emergence of Ghana as a ‘self-nation in a universal modernity that still kept faith with its own nature’. Larbi Korang, Kwaku, Writing Ghana, Imagining Africa: Nation and African Modernity (Rochester: Rochester University Press, 2004)Google Scholar .\n\n47 Nkrumah read widely and wrote prolifically during his time in power. Although some of his writing was achieved in collaboration and written by others, the ideas in his books were clearly his. On Nkrumah’s writings and thought, see Biney, The Political and Social Thought of Kwame Nkrumah and Immanuel Wallerstein, ‘Implicit ideology in Africa: a review of books by Kwame Nkrumah’, The Journal of Conflict Resolution, 11:4 (1967), pp. 518–22 (p. 519).\n\n62 Owusu, Maxwell, Uses and Abuses of Political Power: A Case Study of Continuity and Change in the Politics of Ghana (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970)Google Scholar .\n\nHere, Nkrumah was adopting the prevailing economic philosophy of the day – in Africa and beyond. A centralised economy focused on industrial growth, was the norm in the 1960s and pursued by socialist and capitalist African regimes alike. See Cooper, Frederick and Packard, Randall (eds), International Development and the Social Sciences (Berkley: University of California Press, 1991)Google Scholar .\n\n76 The argument that these were idealised by Nkrumah – that I make below – does not mean there was no substance to his perceptions of international friends and enemies. Ghana’s fragile economy was, like many other African economies, too small and too focused on its colonial dependence to have much hope of making it without substantial pan-African cooperation. Likewise, Nkrumah’s analysis of a malevolent West was rooted in the fact of Cold War anxieties and heavy-handed or illegal interventions in new states that were thought to be going the ‘wrong way’ ideologically.\n\n101 Apter writes of ‘rejoicing in the streets’ at the news of the coup (‘Nkrumah, charisma and the coup’, p. 787) and how ‘women chalked their faces and wore white in the villages – traditional symbols of rejoicing’ (‘Nkrumah, charisma and the coup’, p. 767). Gocking writes: ‘The coup itself was welcomed in Ghana with far more enthusiasm than had been the case for independence … The bars were jammed with celebrants the night after the coup.’ Gocking, The History of Ghana, p. 138. For a detailed account of the key actors involved in the coup, see Baynham, Simon, The Military and Politics in Nkrumah’s Ghana (Boulder: Westview Press, 1988)Google Scholar .\n\n105 First details the ways in which the US and European powers worked to undermine Nkrumah, and to support the regime that replaced him, but her account suggests that while they might have hoped for a coup, and supported it when it occurred, they did not mastermind it. First, Ruth, The Barrel of a Gun: Political Power in Africa and the coup d’etat in Africa (London: Allen Lane, 1970)Google Scholar . In 1978 a former CIA operative, Johri Stockwell claimed in his book In Search of Enemies that the CIA was pivotal in the coup. However, his account is confused and unconvincing. I’m inclined to believe, along with Rooney, that the CIA was clearly ‘well briefed’ on the coup plans, and supportive of them, but ‘they did not actually set the coup in motion or take part’. Rooney, Kwame Nkrumah, p. 254. They didn’t need to. As others have pointed out, the coup didn’t need external direction: there was plenty of domestic opposition to Nkrumah."
