        "text": "Prelude\n\nBeing born in the late 90s, I was unaware of the revolutionary movements that led to Africa's independence. Second-hand accounts from older generations were often generic and lacking in detail. Post-colonial leaders were, and I suspect still are, described as martyrs in elementary textbooks. Yet their politics is seldom discussed. A factor I have now learned led to their demise.\n\nToday, we often associate radical revolutionary movements that emanated during the mid to late 20th century with South American or South Asian countries. However, these movements also had a strong presence on the African continent. Reflecting on this omission of history in social science textbooks, I decided to write a series of essays about this period.\n\nThese essays are centred around African leaders, a pan-African movement, and a struggle toward nation-building following decades of colonial rule. The piece that follows this introductory passage chronicles the life of Kwame Nkrumah. The first democratically elected leader of post-independence Ghana and regarded by some as the most influential figure in the struggle for independence of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nEarly Life and Education"
