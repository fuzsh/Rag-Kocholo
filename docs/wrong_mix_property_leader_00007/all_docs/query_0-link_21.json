The quote, \"I am not African because I was born in Africa but because Africa was born in me,\" reflects his deep commitment to African identity and unity.\n\nNkrumah is expressing the idea that African identity is deeply rooted within him. He underscores the idea that African identity is about more than just birthplace; it's about a deep and intrinsic connection to the continent and its heritage. It resonates with the concept of Pan-Africanism, which seeks to unite people of African descent worldwide based on their shared history and culture.\n#HACSA #mondayquotes #mondaymotivation #kwamenkrumah #panafricanism #africanunity\".",
