The Nubuke Foundation was founded on the initiative of the well-known Ghanaian artist Kofi Setordji with the aim of promoting Ghana’s young art scene and conveying the country’s cultural heritage to a broad audience.

In cooperation with the University of Ghana, KNUST (Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology), and other international partners, the Foundation offers a diverse program of workshops, exhibitions, and readings, as well as a residency program and poetry and theater events. Along with its café and bookshop, Nubuke Foundation is a lively gathering place for adults and children and an oasis of culture in Accra.
