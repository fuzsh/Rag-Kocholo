Similarly to the abelian case, there exists a subgroup ⊂Z2(1)ZN(1) of the 1-form symmetry under which pairs of Wilson lines ⁢WR(L) and ⁢W¯R(L) that are exchanged under C have equal charge (-1)|R|. This is a direct consequence of the relation\n\n=|¯R|-⁢R1N|R|.\n\nTaking the orbifold by this Z2(1) with discrete θ-angle θκ, the Wilson lines with 1-form charge (-1)κ descend to Wilson lines of the /⁢SU(N)Z2 theory, while the others are projected out. The interesting case is =κ1, in which the trivial representation of ⁢SU(N) drops out. Then, as we have seen, there are two degenerate vacua exchanged under charge conjugation.\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking for orthogonal gauge algebras\n\nOne may attempt a similar analysis for other gauge groups G. We consider two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory with simple gauge group that integrates the gauge algebra =g⁢so(N) for ∈N⁢2N. The discrete θ-angles are described in Appendix B.1.\n\nWe perform an explicit analysis of the orbifolds and their vacua in Appendix B.2, akin to the ⁢su(N) case. The upshot is that charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken in /⁢SO(6)Z2 Yang–Mills theory, while the theory possesses a unique C-invariant vacuum for every >N8.\n\n5 Non-invertible symmetry orbifolds\n\nThe 1-form symmetry originating from the centre ⊂ZN⁢SU(N) is only the invertible part of a much larger set of non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory [70].\n\nDefinition 5.1.\n\nA symmetry is non-invertible if it is generated by a set of topological defect operators that do not form a group under fusion.\n\nIn two spacetime dimensions, finite non-invertible 0-form symmetries are, by definition, generated by topological line operators that form a (unitary) fusion category [3]. For example, Definition LABEL:def:network immediately extends to non-invertible symmetries by relaxing the group condition: The finite group A is replaced with its representation category ⁢Rep(A), and the symmetry parameter α is taken to be an object of ⁢Rep(A). These generalized symmetries have been extensively studied, see e.g. [3, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83] for an incomplete list of works in continuum quantum field theory. A rigorous approach to gauging non-invertible symmetries was recently given in [84, 85, 86, 87, 88].\n\nOn the contrary, non-invertible 1-form symmetries are more elusive. In this section we undertake a systematic study of the gauging of the non-invertible symmetry of two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory and the ensuing effect on Wilson loops. Specifically, we\n\n•\n\nintroduce a generalized θ-term in the theory after gauging the non-invertible symmetry; and\n\n•\n\nshow how the spontaneous breaking of charge conjugation symmetry descends to the theory after gauging the non-invertible symmetry.\n\nAs we discuss below, these apply equally well after gauging only a subset of the non-invertible 1-form symmetry.\n\n5.1 The non-invertible 1-form symmetry\n\nIt was shown in [70] that pure ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory in two dimensions admits a vast class of zero-dimensional topological symmetry operators, defined as follows. Let ⁢SU(N)# denote the set of conjugacy classes in ⁢SU(N). Take a point ∈℘Σ and a conjugacy class ∈[U0]⁢SU(N)#, for an arbitrary element ∈U0⁢SU(N). Delete ℘ and require that the gauge connection A has holonomy in [U0] around the puncture. The path integral over such gauge fields gives rise to a zero-dimensional gauge-invariant disorder operator ⁢V℘[U0], analogous to a Gukov–Witten operator. It is topological thanks to the invariance of two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory under area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and therefore we henceforth omit the subscript ℘ indicating its location. It is gauge-invariant by construction, as only the conjugacy class of the holonomy is fixed rather than the holonomy itself.\n\nLet us briefly review how these local topological operators act on the Wilson lines. Consider for simplicity a disk D of area 12 with a Wilson loop in the representation R running along the boundary with opposite orientation, as in Subsection LABEL:sec:reading. We recall that the path integral with the Wilson loop inserted is denoted ⟨WR⟩ and evaluates to (LABEL:eq:WRvevdisk). If we insert a disorder operator ⁢V[U0] at an arbitrary point in the interior of the disk, a standard computation shows that\n\n=⟨⁢V[U0]WR⟩⁢χR(U0)e-⁢g24C2(R), (5.2)\n\nwhich in general differs from the correlator without the insertion of the topological symmetry operators. The two invariant cases are =U01N (trivial topological operator) and =R∅ (trivial Wilson line).\n\nThe topological symmetry operators thus constructed are generically non-invertible [70]. As a concrete example, if ∈N⁢4N then one of the operators is associated to the conjugacy class [U0] with representative\n\nU0=⁢diag(⏟1,…,1/N2,⏟-1,…,-1/N2)∈⁢SU(N).\n\nFor this choice, the correlator (5.2) vanishes for a large set of representations, including the fundamental representation. Therefore the topological symmetry operator annihilates the corresponding Wilson loops, and hence does not admit an inverse.\n\nDemanding invertibility and imposing the special unitary constraint on U0, we are left with operators associated to the conjugacy classes of elements U0∈⁢Z(⁢SU(N))=ZN, thus recovering the usual 1-form centre symmetry Z(1) as the invertible subset of this larger set of symmetries. The standard group law agrees with the multiplication induced by the fusion product of topological symmetry operators.\n\n5.2 Gauging the non-invertible 1-form symmetry\n\nWe have seen in (5.2) that inserting a topological pointlike operator ⁢V[U0] in the correlation functions of Wilson loops projects out all the representations R for which =⁢χR(U0)0. Gauging the full non-invertible 1-form symmetry is enforced by integrating over insertions {⁢V[U0]|∈[U0]⁢SU(N)#} in the partition function on Σ. The integral is a Molien–Weyl projector which has the net effect of projecting out all representations except the trivial one.\n\nWhile the outcome is in agreement with general arguments, it is not possible to derive it in the path integral formalism. The obstruction is the absence of a definition of the 2-form gauge field B when the symmetry is non-invertible.\n\nGauging subsets of the non-invertible 1-form symmetry\n\nExactly as it is possible to gauge any subgroup ⊆BZ, it should be possible to gauge certain collections within the non-invertible 1-form symmetry; the analogous statement for gauging non-invertible 0-form symmetries was recently derived in [87]. Indeed, it is possible to gauge the symmetry classified by conjugacy classes ⊆H#⁢SU(N)# for every normal subgroup ⊆H⁢SU(N). This is done explicitly by integrating (5.2) over ∈[U0]H#. In this case the integral is again a Molien–Weyl projector, but we ought to take into account the branching rule under ⟶⁢SU(N)H to decompose the ⁢SU(N)-representation R into H-representations. Every R whose branching rule yields the trivial representation of H (among others) will survive the gauging of the subset of non-invertible symmetries classified by H#.\n\nGeneralized θ-term for the non-invertible 1-form symmetry\n\nThere are various ways to gauge the invertible 1-form symmetry, landing on different theories labelled by the discrete parameter κ. We thus propose a generalization of this concept to non-invertible symmetries.\n\nWhen gauging the standard 1-form symmetry Z(1) in Section LABEL:sec:orbi, we proceeded by introducing a discrete parameter κ and weighing the action functional accordingly. We sum over insertions of local topological operators labelled by ∈e/⁢ 2πiβNZ, for ∈β{0,1,…,-N1}, with weight [29]\n\n=⁢χκZ(e/⁢ 2πiβN)e/⁢ 2πiκβN\n\ngiven by the pairing of ∈e/⁢ 2πiβNZ with a character χκZ of Z labelled by ∈κ{0,1,…,-N1}. That is, a θ-term corresponds to turning on a pairing between the local topological operators that generate the symmetry Z and the character lattice of Z.\n\nIn this way, we are led to propose an extension of the notion of θ-term to non-invertible symmetries. For the local operators ⁢V[U0] classified by ⁢SU(N)#, we ought to turn on a pairing between ⁢SU(N)# and the character lattice ⁢CZ(⁢SU(N)) of ⁢SU(N). The character lattice is the image of the ring homomorphism ⟶⁢R(⁢SU(N))⁢C(⁢SU(N)) with ⟼RχR, under which the character is fixed by ∈R⁢R(⁢SU(N)). We conclude\n\nProposition 5.3.\n\nFor gauging the non-invertible 1-form symmetry, the generalized discrete parameter κ is an isomorphism class of irreducible representations of ⁢SU(N).\n\nThe pairing\n\nThe local topological operators ⁢V[U0] are classified by ⁢SU(N)#. The Wilson loops WR, charged under the non-invertible symmetry, are classified by the classes ∈R⁢R(⁢SU(N)) in the Grothendieck ring ⁢R(⁢SU(N)) of the category of ⁢SU(N)-representations. Taking correlation functions ⟨⁢V[U0]WR⟩ defines a pairing ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ between ⁢SU(N)# and ⁢R(⁢SU(N)):\n\n:=⟨U0,R⟩⟨⁢V[U0]WR⟩.\n\nThis is valid for every Riemann surface Σ, even though we only explicitate the expressions for the disk for clarity. In this case, the pairing is given by (5.2) and it differs from the canonical pairing by the exponential of the Casimir invariant. We may also introduce a pairing ⟨⋅|⋅⟩ between generators of ⁢R(⁢SU(N)) according to\n\n⟨R1|R2⟩:=∫⁢SU(N)⁢dU0⟨R1,U0⟩⟨U0,R2⟩=∫⁢SU(N)⁢dU0⟨⁢V[U0]WR1⟩⟨⁢V[U0]WR2⟩,\n\nwhere we used bi-invariance of the Haar measure to extend integration over conjugacy classes ⁢SU(N)# to ⁢SU(N). When Σ is topologically the disk D, it is given by\n\n=⟨R1|R2⟩⁢e-⁢g22C2(R2)δ¯R1,R2, (5.4)\n\nwhere we used orthonormality of the basis of characters. Again, it differs from the canonical pairing through the dependence on the Casimir invariant.\n\nGauging with generalized θ-term\n\nWe have seen that gauging the non-invertible 1-form symmetry with generalized discrete θ-angle labelled by κ dictates to integrate over insertions of operators ⁢V[U0] weighted by the character ⁢χκ(U0). Taking again the disk topology for concreteness, this yields\n\n∫⁢SU(N)⁢dU0χκ(U0)⟨U0,R⟩ =∫⁢SU(N)⁢dU0χκ(U0)χR(U0)e-⁢g24C2(R) =⁢e-⁢g24C2(R)δ¯κ,R=⁢e⁢g24C2(κ)⟨κ|R⟩,\n\nwhere for the first equality we used (5.2), for the second equality we used orthonormality of the characters, and for the last equality we used the pairing (5.4). We thus arrive at a projection onto ≅R¯κ. Had we defined the Wilson loop with orientation ∂D, instead of -∂D, we would get the projection onto ≅Rκ. From the considerations so far we arrive at\n\nProposition 5.5.\n\nGauging the non-invertible 1-form symmetry with generalized θ-angle labelled by κ corresponds to acting with the projector ⟨κ| on the Grothendieck ring ⁢R(⁢SU(N)).\n\nAs a consequence of the non-invertible 1-form symmetry, two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory ‘decomposes’ into infinitely many invertible field theories, labelled by the irreducible representations. Gauging with generalized θ-angle selects one such invertible theory. From this viewpoint, Proposition 5.5 extends the decomposition results in [30] from the invertible to the full 1-form symmetry.\n\nAnother perspective on the generalized θ-term\n\nWe have introduced a representation theoretic definition of θ-terms for the non-invertible symmetry. We now rephrase these findings in the formalism of Kapustin–Seiberg [89], see also [90, 91].\n\nLet us start again with ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory on Σ and its 1-form symmetry ⊆B(1)ZN. Following [89, 90], another presentation of the discrete θ-angle in the orbifold corresponds to stacking the ⁢SU(N) theory (before gauging) with a two-dimensional topological field theory, whose partition function is equal to\n\nexp(⁢κ∫ΣB).\n\nDifferent choices of parameter κ correspond to different couplings for the background gauge field B. Gauging the diagonal 1-form symmetry of the juxtaposed system produces the orbifold /⁢SU(N)Zk Yang–Mills theory with discrete θ-angle θκ.\n\nThe difficulty in extending this approach is the lack of notion of background gauge fields for non-invertible symmetries in general. Our previous analysis yields a solution in the particular case of the non-invertible 1-form symmetry of two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory. Conjugacy classes ∈[U0]⁢SU(N)# play the role of background gauge fields for this non-invertible symmetry. The possible ways of defining a partition function for these background fields are in one-to-one correspondence with characters of irreducible representations of ⁢SU(N).\n\nConsider the set T consisting of two-dimensional topological field theories possessing this non-invertible 1-form symmetry and differing by the choice of coupling. T is endowed with the fusion product ⊗ (fusion of two-dimensional spacetimes of theories) and the direct sum ⊕ (disjoint union of theories). From the above discussion, we infer that (T,⊗,⊕) acquires the structure of a ring, identified with the character lattice ⁢CZ(⁢SU(N)), and hence with the Grothendieck ring ⁢R(⁢SU(N)).\n\nWilson loops in non-invertible symmetry orbifolds\n\nThe study of Wilson loops in orbifolds by the non-invertible 1-form symmetry generalizes the program initiated in [53]. By collecting the expectation values of all the Wilson loops, it is in principle possible to reconstruct which part of the non-invertible symmetry has been gauged, and with which generalized θ-angle. In particular, if ≠⟨W∅⟩0 we already know that the gauging has been performed at =κ∅ (trivial representation).\n\nSuppose, for example, that we start computing ⟨WR⟩ by successively increasing |R| and find\n\n{≠⟨WR⟩0∈⁢ if R{∅,□,⁢□□,⁢□□□,…},=⟨WR⟩0 otherwise.\n\nThis is compatible with the branching rules for ⟶⁢SU(N)⁢SU(-N1). Note that the surviving Young diagrams are also compatible with an ⁢SU(2) or =⁢SO(3)⁢PSU(2) gauge theory, among others. Nevertheless, the values of the non-vanishing ⟨WR⟩ will make clear that the theory is a non-invertible gauging of an ⁢SU(N) theory, because dimR and ⁢C2(R) are evaluated for the ⁢SU(N)-representations associated to the single-row Young diagrams. For example, when >N2\n\n≠⟨W⁢□□⋯□⟩⟨W⁢□□⋯□⟩|=G⁢SU(2).\n\nIn conclusion, from the list of the expectation values of Wilson loops, one can reconstruct the global form of the gauge group even after the projection due to gauging a non-invertible symmetry.\n\n5.3 Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the non-invertible symmetry orbifold\n\nWe now assume ∈N⁢2N. The spontaneous breaking of charge conjugation symmetry generalizes to orbifolds of ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory by a subset of the non-invertible 1-form symmetry. For the invertible part, the subgroup ⊂Z2ZN for ∈N⁢2N consists of the elements ≅{e/⁢ 2πiβN}=β0,/N2{1,-1}, which are mapped into themselves by C. Gauging this Z2(1) leaves behind elements that are not fixed under the action of C. This argument applies to the gauging of every Zk(1) with k a power of 2 that divides N, where some of the elements that survive the gauging are not fixed under C and therefore are able to distinguish a representation from its conjugate.\n\nThe generalization of this idea to the non-invertible 1-form symmetry is to gauge the C-invariant collection of all the symmetries. Since the non-invertible topological operators are labelled by conjugacy classes in ⁢SU(N)#, the C-invariant subset consists of those operators labelled by conjugacy classes in ⁢SO(N)#. The centre =Z2⁢Z(⁢SO(N)) is precisely the invertible 1-form symmetry group Z2(1) that we have gauged to find spontaneous breaking of charge conjugation symmetry in Subsection LABEL:subsec:CbreakingSUNZk.\n\nA generalized θ-term that extends =κmod12 to the non-invertible symmetry is achieved by choosing κ to be the vector representation of ⁢SO(N). By their branching rules, both □ and ¯□ survive the projection, thus we conclude that charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken in the orbifold.\n\nProposition 5.6.\n\nConsider two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory with gauge group ⁢SU(N), ∈N⁢2N. In the orbifold theory obtained by gauging the non-invertible 1-form symmetry ⁢SO(N)# with a generalized θ-angle given by the character of the vector representation of ⁢SO(N), charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\n6 Anomalies\n\nIn this section we begin by giving an exhaustive analysis of mixed anomalies in ⁢U(1) and ⁢U(N) Yang–Mills theories. Then we discuss mixed anomalies present in the orbifolds of ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory involving the (-1)-form symmetry. The main result is Proposition 6.4, which we prove directly in the two-dimensional gauge theory.\n\n6.1 Charge conjugation and lower form gauge transformations\n\nLet Γ(-1) be a (-1)-form symmetry group, which we will assume to be either ⁢U(1) or a cyclic subgroup ⊂Zk⁢U(1). A Γ(-1) transformation in two dimensions is generated by a Wilson surface labelled by ∈ηΓ. The insertion of these operators in the partition function and correlation functions shifts the θ-parameter as ⟼θ⁢2π+θ⁢2πη. We have also observed in Subsection LABEL:sec:dualgauging (and will find again below) that, after turning on a 0-form gauge field, it shifts θ⁢2π by the corresponding background field.\n\nIn the language of the (-1)-form symmetry, the periodicity of θ becomes invariance under a (-1)-form gauge transformation, when a background for the (-1)-form symmetry is activated. Conversely, when the theory fails to be invariant under a shift of θ by its periodicity after some background gauge field is turned on, we interpret it as a breaking of the (-1)-form symmetry. These ideas will be explicitly realized momentarily.\n\nHaving set the stage to treat (-1)-form symmetries, we can now state the obvious\n\nProposition 6.1.\n\nConsider two-dimensional pure Yang–Mills theory with multiply-connected gauge group G, i.e. ≠⁢π1(G)1, which admits outer automorphisms. Let C be the non-trivial element in ⊆C⁢Out(G), and C′ the operator C followed by a (-1)-form gauge transformation. The theory is invariant under C at =θ0 and under C′ at =θπ.\n\nThe only novelty of this statement is to pinpoint the role of the (-1)-form symmetry, which however has important consequences. Indeed, the mixed anomalies involving charge conjugation in the literature typically rely on the non-invariance under shifts of θ. We claim that the anomalous nature of C′ originates in an anomalous (-1)-form symmetry.\n\n6.2 Anomalies in U(N) Yang–Mills theory\n\nCharge conjugation anomaly in U(1) Yang–Mills theory\n\nWe consider two-dimensional ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory and state here the result of [56, Section 2].\n\nProposition 6.2.\n\nTwo-dimensional pure ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory at =θπ suffers from a mixed anomaly between C′ and the 1-form symmetry.\n\nThe proof is straightforward. The θ-term\n\n⁢12∫ΣF\n\nis not invariant under background ⁢U(1)(1)-gauge transformations, as these shift the action functional by ⁢πin for ∈nZ. This is fixed by the usual replacement ⟼F-FB, but now the counterterm is not invariant under C′. In contrast to the flipping of sign of F, the non-invariance of B cannot be fixed by a shift ⟼θ+θ⁢2π, whereby\n\n⟼⁢θ⁢2π∫ΣB+⁢θ⁢2π∫ΣB∫ΣB,\n\nbecause the last summand is not integrally quantized. In conclusion, one cannot preserve both charge conjugation and 1-form symmetry.\n\nAnomaly in the space of couplings in ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory\n\nIt was shown in [35, Section 4] that pure ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory suffers from an anomaly in the space of coupling constants. This means the impossibility of turning on a background for ⁢U(1)(1) while at the same time promoting θ to a position-dependent coupling, i.e. an axion field, and preserving background gauge invariance.\n\nMixed lower-higher form anomaly in ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory\n\nWe now revisit the two anomalies just presented. The difference in our approach with respect to [35] is that we keep θ fixed and turn on a background gauge field a for ⁢U(1)(-1).\n\nProposition 6.3.\n\nTwo-dimensional pure ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory suffers from a mixed anomaly between the ⁢U(1)(1) 1-form symmetry and the ⁢U(1)(-1) (-1)-form symmetry.\n\nConsider the θ-term with a 2-form background ⁢U(1)(1) gauge field B turned on. Introducing the background ⁢U(1)(-1)-gauge field a, the non-invariant part of the action functional is\n\n∫Σ⁢(-FB)(+θ⁢2π⁢ia).\n\nWe now leave θ unchanged but act with a gauge transformation of a. There is a shift by ∫ΣB that is not properly quantized, thus spoiling the invariance.\n\nWe conclude that, even at =θπ, the mixed anomaly involving C′ is a consequence of the impossibility of preserving gauge invariance under both ⁢U(1)(1) and ⁢U(1)(-1). This is a corollary of Proposition 6.3 combined with Proposition 6.1. We stress that turning on the ⁢U(1)(-1) gauge field a breaks the symmetry under naive charge conjugation C explicitly, but in exactly the same way as any ≠θ0 does. The crux of the matter is whether or not C maps the theory to a ⁢U(1)(-1) gauge equivalent theory.\n\nLet us emphasize that this result is analogous to the mixed electric-magnetic anomaly of Maxwell theory in four dimensions. The electric 1-form symmetry and the magnetic (-d3)-form symmetry generally both participate in the anomaly in d dimensions. For =d4 both are 1-form symmetries, while for =d2 the magnetic symmetry is a (-1)-form symmetry.\n\n⁢U(N) Yang–Mills theory\n\nIt is straightforward to extend the argument of ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory to higher rank gauge groups ⁢U(N) for >N1. Turning on the background gauge field B for the 1-form symmetry ⁢U(1)(1), the action functional becomes\n\n+⁢1⁢2g2∫Σ⁢Tr[∗(-F⊗B1N)(-F⊗B1N)]⁢θ⁢2π∫Σ⁢Tr(-F⊗B1N),\n\nwhich fails to be invariant under shifts ⟼θ⁢2π+θ⁢2πn for ∈nZ. However, in contrast to the =N1 case, if\n\n∈⁢N∫ΣB⁢ 2πiZ,\n\nthe ⁢2π-periodicity of θ is preserved. In other words, in the ⁢U(N) theory for >N1, a subgroup ⊂ZN(1)⁢U(1)(1) is anomaly-free. This non-anomalous ZN(1) is identified with the 1-form symmetry of ⊂⁢SU(N)⁢U(N).\n\n6.3 Mixed lower-higher form anomaly\n\nWe will now show\n\nProposition 6.4.\n\nLet ≥k2 and N a multiple of k, with ∉k2⁢NZ. Pure /⁢SU(N)Zk Yang–Mills theory on Σ suffers from a mixed anomaly between the (-1)-form symmetry Zk(-1) and the 1-form symmetry Z/Nk(1).\n\nIn the ⁢SU(N) and ⁢PSU(N) theories, there cannot be such an anomaly, because the (-1)-form symmetry in the former and the 1-form symmetry in the latter are trivial, hence trivially anomaly-free.\n\nLet us quickly recall the setup of Section LABEL:sec:orbi. The /⁢SU(N)Zk curvature Fe decomposes into the ⁢SU(N) curvature F and the 2-form gauge field B. The theory has the electric 1-form symmetry =ˇB(1)Z/Nk(1), which we denote with a check to distinguish it from =B(1)Zk(1) of Section LABEL:sec:orbi, and the magnetic (-1)-form symmetry =K(-1)Zk(-1). The background gauge fields are respectively the 2-form ˇB and the scalar K.\n\nThe coupling of the electric 2-form field ˇB to Fe shifts\n\n⟼Fe-Fe⊗ˇB1N.\n\nOn the other hand, K enters through the magnetic coupling\n\n⁢kN∫Σ⁢KTrFe. (6.5)\n\nThe coefficient here, which generalizes the standard coupling (LABEL:magcouplingaF) to the case <kN, follows from (LABEL:FprimeCW), or equivalently from the fact that, by embedding K(-1) into the ⁢U(1)(-1) Chern–Weil symmetry, the conserved current is ∗⁢kNTrFe. In any case (6.5) is invariant under background K(-1)-gauge transformations, by recalling that ∈∫Σ⁢TrFe⁢2πNkZ.\n\nWhen both background gauge fields are turned on, the pertinent part of the action functional reads\n\n=⁢kN∫Σ⁢KTr(-Fe⊗ˇB1N)+-⁢k∫Σ⁢KˇB⁢2πin,\n\nwhere ∈nZ. We arrive at the natural modification of the action functional in (LABEL:AbelSUN1) given by\n\n∫Σ⁢ˇB(+-⁢kKκ), (6.6)\n\nwhere we do not write explicitly all the gauge-invariant terms that define the theory, and only focus on the anomalous part. This term is invariant under a background ˇB(1)-gauge transformation.\n\nHowever, it is not invariant under a background K(-1)-gauge transformation unless ∈∫Σ⁢kˇB⁢2πiZ. This is not generically the case, and there are three possibilities:\n\n1)\n\nIf =kNk, then the coefficient in (6.6) is just enough to preserve invariance under both B(1) and K(-1) background gauge transformations. More generally, if k is an integer multiple of Nk, i.e. ∈k2⁢NZ, then (6.6) is also invariant under K(-1) background gauge transformations.\n\n2)\n\nIf ∉k2⁢NZ, then (6.6) is improperly quantized and is not invariant under general K(-1) background gauge transformations.\n\n3)\n\nIf ⁢gcd(k,Nk)=m>1, then a subgroup ⊂Zm(1)ˇB(1) is anomaly-free.\n\nThe lack of background gauge invariance if both background fields are turned on indicates the presence of a mixed anomaly.\n\n6.4 Mixed 2-group anomaly\n\nAs we have seen, charge conjugation C(0) acts on the 1-form symmetry ZN(1). We can thus consider the non-trivial symmetry extension\n\n1⟶ZN⟶⋊ZNZ2⟶C⟶1\n\nin the category of groups. This is the semi-direct product group ⋊ZNZ2 in the automorphism 2-group Aut(SU(N))//SU(N) of the stack of ⁢SU(N)-bundles with connection, where the left factor is the 1-form symmetry and the right factor is charge conjugation.\n\nAs sets\n\nZN≅{e/⁢ 2πiβN}=β0,1,…,-N1,C≅{1,C},\n\nand ⋊ZNZ2 contains the same elements as the set ×ZNC. The group law in ⋊ZNZ2 is given by\n\n⋅(e/⁢ 2πiβ1N,1)(e/⁢ 2πiβ2N,1) =(e/⁢ 2πi(+β1β2)N,1), ⋅(e/⁢ 2πiβ1N,1)(e/⁢ 2πiβ2N,C) =(e/⁢ 2πi(+β1β2)N,C), ⋅(e/⁢ 2πiβ1N,C)(e/⁢ 2πiβ2N,1) =(e/⁢ 2πi(-β1β2)N,C), ⋅(e/⁢ 2πiβ1N,C)(e/⁢ 2πiβ2N,C) =(e/⁢ 2πi(-β1β2)N,1),\n\nfor all ∈β1,β2{0,1,…,-N1}.\n\nThe symmetry defects for C(0) are topological line operators of type ∈η{0,1}, while the symmetry defects for ZN(1) are local topological operators of type ∈β{0,1,…,-N1}. The action of the 0-form symmetry on local operators restricts to give an action on the generators of the 1-form symmetry. By the general argument in [26], gauging either C(0) or ZN(1) will produce a mixed anomaly between the remaining symmetry and the Pontryagin dual symmetry that emerges after the gauging. We can make this rather explicit in the case at hand when ∈N⁢2N.\n\nStarting from pure ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory on Σ, gauging the 1-form symmetry =Z(1)ZN(1) produces the dual (-1)-form symmetry ^Z=(-1)ZN(-1), where ≅^ZZN is the Pontryagin dual of =ZZN. The orbifold theory is pure ⁢PSU(N) Yang–Mills theory on Σ and the symmetry group is now the direct product ×ZNZ2 with the remaining 0-form symmetry C(0). Gauging Z/Nk(-1)⊆^Z(-1) can be achieved through the magnetic coupling of a background 0-form gauge field a to the ⁢PSU(N) curvature Fe:\n\n=⁢/NkN∫Σ⁢aTrFe⁢Nk∫Σ⁢aB.\n\nCharge conjugation acts on this term as :C⟼B-B, as a result of the original non-trivial extension. This is not invariant and, by a computation completely analogous to the one below (6.6), the two configurations before and after applying C are not equivalent unless ∈k2⁢NZ. Hence there is no way in general to gauge the (-1)-form symmetry Z/Nk(-1) while preserving the 0-form symmetry C(0).\n\nOn the other hand, gauging the 0-form symmetry C(0) in ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory yields the dual 0-form symmetry ^C=(0)Z2(0). The orbifold theory is now ⁢~SU(N) Yang–Mills theory with symmetry group the direct product ×ZNZ2 with the remaining 1-form symmetry ZN(1). As illustrated in Figure 3, when a local operator of type β is dragged across a line of type η, it acquires a phase factor ⁢λβ(η), where ∈λ⁢Z1(⁢BZN,^C) is a 1-cocycle corresponding to the non-trivial extension class. This 1-cocycle therefore becomes a mixed anomaly between ^C(0) and ZN(1), once C(0) is gauged [59].\n\n7 Applications\n\nWe conclude in this final section by briefly describing some simple implications of our results for other field theories. For further phenomenological implications, especially in higher dimensions, see [40].\n\n7.1 The massive Schwinger model\n\nLet us discuss our results for the abelian case in relation with the massive Schwinger model. This is ⁢U(1) gauge theory with a massive Dirac fermion in two dimensions. Let m denote the bare mass of the fermion field and g the gauge coupling as before. At =θπ, the phase diagram as a function of the dimensionless parameter :=^mmg presents a critical point ^mcr [92, 93]. For <^m^mcr the theory has a unique gapped vacuum, while in the large mass phase >^m^mcr the vacuum is two-fold degenerate and charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken [92, 93].\n\nFrom our findings it is clear that, for very large mass, charge conjugation symmetry must be spontaneously broken at =θπ. Indeed we expect that, when ≫mg1, one can integrate out the massive fermion and obtain pure ⁢U(1) Yang–Mills theory in a first approximation. Using the bosonization of the massive Schwinger model [92], one can show that the leading irrelevant operator preserves both C(0) and ⁢U(1)(1). Since C is spontaneously broken at =θπ in pure Yang–Mills theory, so it must also be in the massive Schwinger model when the mass is very large. In fact, after bosonization our argument becomes identical to the one used in [56, Section 2.2] for the two-dimensional abelian Higgs model.\n\n7.2 Two-dimensional adjoint quantum chromodynamics\n\nThe study of quantum chromodynamics in two dimensions (QCD2) with adjoint quarks has a long history, see for example [94] for an influential early work and [95, 74] for recent developments. The action is that of pure ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory coupled to a Majorana fermion ψ in the adjoint representation of ⁢SU(N). A major outcome of [74] is that this theory possesses a number of non-invertible 0-form symmetries, which are explicitly broken by a mass term for ψ.\n\nIn this subsection we discuss implications of our analysis to orbifolds of this theory. In two Euclidean spacetime dimensions the gamma-matrices are\n\nγ1=(0110),γ2=(0i-i0),γ5=(-1001), (7.1)\n\nwhere, in the notation of [74], =γ5⁢iγ1γ2 implements a chirality transformation.\n\nAdjoint QCD2 with large quark mass\n\nBy giving a large mass m to the adjoint fermion, such that ≫m2g21, the theory develops a large mass gap and the low energy dynamics is captured by the appearance of massive particles on top of the vacua provided by pure Yang–Mills theory. This analysis was already performed in [74] when the gauge group is ⁢SU(N) or ⁢PSU(N). Here we consider instead the case /⁢SU(N)Zk for k a power of 2 that divides N. Since the quark field is in the adjoint representation, the 1-form symmetry is preserved. We can thus gauge the subgroup Zk with discrete θκ-angle given by =κk2. Due to the large mass, the vacua are those already found in earlier sections. In particular, C is spontaneously broken.\n\nOur earlier analysis also leads to a prediction for the particle spectrum in /⁢SU(N)Zk adjoint QCD2. Let us exemplify this for =k2 and =κ1, with the vacua corresponding to the representations □ and ¯□. It is possible to act with a single adjoint fermion field on each vacuum. This is because the tensor product of the fundamental and adjoint representations expands into irreducible representations according to\n\n⁢\\ytableausetupcentertableaux,⊗⁢smalltableaux□{ytableau}\n\n&≅□⊕{ytableau}&⊕{ytableau}&and the fundamental representation □ appears on the right-hand side. The same is true for the anti-fundamental representation □¯, for which the conjugate representations appear on the right-hand side. The particle spectrum is thus created on top of each degenerate vacuum by acting with an arbitrary number of creation operators for the adjoint quark ψ, and then forming gauge singlets. The two towers of states are exchanged by charge conjugation.\n\nMassless adjoint QCD2\n\nLet us now step back to the simply-connected gauge group ⁢SU(N). In the opposite limit =m0, in which the quark field ψ is massless, the theory acquires a Z2(0) chiral symmetry generated by the matrix γ5 in (7.1). There is a mixed anomaly between the chiral Z2(0) and the 1-form symmetry ZN(1). We shall now reinterpret this anomaly in the light of our earlier analysis.\n\nBy gauging the full ZN(1) we land on ⁢PSU(N) gauge theory with discrete parameter κ. It was shown in [74, Section 3] that the action of the chiral symmetry shifts ⟼κ+κN2 if N is even. We reinterpret this fact by saying that, in order to remain within the same theory, the action of chiral symmetry must be accompanied by a (-1)-form background gauge transformation. This is because the theories with parameters κ and +κN2 are not equivalent. Therefore ⁢PSU(N) adjoint QCD2 possesses a higher structure mixing Z2(0) and the (-1)-form symmetry. Gauging the (-1)-form part, by the argument in Subsection 6.4 applied to the chiral symmetry, we predict a mixed anomaly between Z2(0) and the dual symmetry ZN(1), recovering the known results in our language.\n\n7.3 ⁢T¯T-deformation\n\nThe composite operator ⁢T¯T induces an irrelevant deformation of any two-dimensional quantum field theory with a conserved stress-energy tensor T. It is thus not expected to modify the low energy behaviour of the theory. As a consequence, every symmetry of the original quantum field theory, be it invertible or non-invertible, is either explicitly broken by the term ⁢T¯T in the action functional, or otherwise it should be preserved at every point of the irrelevant flow triggered by the ⁢T¯T-deformation. If the global (possibly non-invertible) symmetry suffers from an anomaly, one invokes the ’t Hooft anomaly matching condition to argue that the full symmetry structure is preserved. Indeed, the anomaly is captured by topological terms, which do not couple to the metric and thus are insensitive to the deformation by the operator ⁢T¯T. We now proceed to show explicitly how the latter statement works within the context of our earlier results.\n\nThe irrelevant perturbation of two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory by the operator ⁢T¯T was considered in [96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]. Let G be a gauge group with Lie algebra =g⁢su(N). The ⁢T¯T-deformed partition function on a closed, connected and oriented Riemann surface Σ is\n\n=⁢ZG⁢T¯T[Σ]∑∈R⁢R(⁢SU(N))τ⁢(dimR)χe-⁢g22C2⁢T¯T(R;τ), (7.2)\n\nwhere ≥τ0 is the deformation parameter. In (7.2) we have defined\n\n:=⁢C2⁢T¯T(R;τ)⁢C2(R)-1⁢τN3C2(R), (7.3)\n\nwhile the instanton analysis of [101] shows that the sum over irreducible ⁢SU(N)-representations R is restricted to the subset\n\n:=⁢R(⁢SU(N))τ{∈R⁢R(⁢SU(N))|<⁢τC2(R)N3},\n\nwhich guarantees convergence of the series (7.2).\n\nFollowing step by step the derivation of [99] we find that the ⁢T¯T-deformation is compatible with the orbifold. The ⁢T¯T-deformed partition function of /⁢SU(N)Zk Yang–Mills theory on Σ with discrete θ-angle κ is simply\n\n=⁢Z/⁢SU(N)Zk⁢T¯T,κ[Σ]∑∈R⁢R(⁢SU(N))τ⁢(dimR)χe-⁢g22C2⁢T¯T(R;τ)δ(mod-|R|κk).\n\nFrom this expression and the fact that the deformed Casimir (7.3) yields the same vacua as the undeformed Casimir invariant, we may state\n\nCorollary 7.4.\n\nLet ≥k2 be a power of 2 and ∈N⁢kN. In =G/⁢SU(N)Zk (resp. =G⁢U(1)) ⁢T¯T-deformed Yang–Mills theory at =κk2, hence =θκπ (resp. =θπ), charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken.\n\nThis result was expected, because ⁢T¯T is an irrelevant operator and thus should not change the low energy behaviour of a system, while the spontaneous breaking of C is a statement about the vacua of the theory. An alternative point of view is to say that gauging the 1-form symmetry Zk(1) corresponds to inserting networks of topological point defects, which are insensitive to the deformation of the metric brought about by the ⁢T¯T-deformation.\n\nNon-invertible 1-form symmetry\n\nOne main aspect of the theory with partition function (7.2) is that the ⁢T¯T-deformation preserves the exact Casimir scaling of the Wilson loops in Yang–Mills theory. As a consequence, the non-invertible 1-form symmetry discovered in [70] persists in the ⁢T¯T-deformed theory.\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking in the ⁢T¯T-deformed massive Schwinger model\n\nCombining Corollary 7.4 with, for instance, the observations in Subsection 7.1, we predict that charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, in the large mass phase, in the ⁢T¯T-deform-ation of the massive Schwinger model.\n\n7.4 Lower form symmetry in higher dimensions\n\nA version of Proposition 6.1 applies to four and higher even dimensions. The conclusions of this subsection overlap with the recent results of [40].\n\nThe Gaiotto–Kapustin–Komargodski–Seiberg anomaly\n\nIn [7], Gaiotto–Kapustin–Komargodski–Seiberg considered four-dimensional pure ⁢SU(N) Yang–Mills theory and observed a mixed anomaly between CP symmetry and the 1-form symmetry ZN(1). The anomaly is signalled by the breakdown of the periodicity ∼θ+θ⁢2π when a background 2-form gauge field for ZN(1) is turned on.\n\nHere we consider the four-dimensional theory on a closed four-manifold M4 with metric whose Hodge star operator is denoted ∗. We use the θ-term\n\n-⁢iθ∫M4⁢c2(⁢adP)\n\nwhere ⁢c2(⁢adP) is the second Chern class of the adjoint bundle associated to a principal ⁢SU(N)-bundle ⟶PM4. Since ⁢c2(⁢adP) is closed, we can consider the Chern–Weil (-1)-form symmetry ⁢U(1)(-1) with conserved 0-form current ∗⁢c2(⁢adP). Turning on a background 0-form gauge field a as a source for this current, the θ-term becomes\n\n-⁢i∫M4⁢c2(⁢adP)(+θ⁢ia), (7.5)\n\nwhere now the periodicity ∼θ+θ⁢2π is reinterpreted as the invariance under (-1)-form gauge transformations.\n\nAfter coupling this system to a background 2-form gauge field B, (7.5) ceases to be invariant under shifts ⟼θ+θ⁢2π. In the language of (-1)-form symmetries, B breaks invariance under background (-1)-form gauge transformations. The Gaiotto–Kapustin–Komargodski–Seiberg anomaly is thus a mixed anomaly between the 1-form and (-1)-form symmetries.\n\nLower form symmetry in even dimensions\n\nThe previous discussion generalizes in the following way. For any closed ⁢2n-dimensional manifold M⁢2n, with metric and corresponding Hodge star operator ∗, we consider a principal G-bundle ⟶PM⁢2n whose adjoint bundle has non-trivial nth Chern class: ≠⁢cn(⁢adP)0. Then G Yang–Mills theory on M⁢2n admits the θ-term\n\n⁢i-1nθ∫M⁢2n⁢cn(⁢adP),\n\nor its appropriate modification as in (LABEL:kappaB) for a discrete parameter κ. The ⁢2π-periodicity of θ, or alternatively the periodic identification ∼κ+κk, can be interpreted as the gauge invariance under (-1)-form Chern–Weil symmetries associated to the conserved 0-form current ∗⁢cn(⁢adP).\n\nTurning on a background 2-form gauge field B for the 1-form symmetry :=Z(1)⁢Z(G) modifies ⁢cn(⁢adP) by replacing ⟼F-F⊗B1 in its representation as a Chern–Weil form. Generically, the mixed terms in the expansion involving\n\n∧⁢⁢iθ(⁢2π)n∫M⁢2nBj⁢TrFl\n\nmay spoil the periodicity of the θ-parameter. By coupling the conserved current ∗⁢cn(⁢adP) to a background 0-form gauge field a, we recast the breakdown of periodicity as a mixed anomaly between the 1-form symmetry and the (-1)-form symmetry.\n\nAppendix A Notation and conventions\n\n:Σ A closed, connected and oriented Riemann surface on which the field theory lives.\n\n:χ The Euler characteristic of Σ.\n\n:ω The Kähler form on Σ, normalized to unit area =∫Σω1.\n\n:S A surface operator.\n\n:L A line or loop operator.\n\n:G A Lie group, taken to be the gauge group.\n\n:g The Lie algebra of G, called the gauge algebra.\n\n:⁢Z(G) The centre of G.\n\n:⁢R(G) The Grothendieck ring of the representation category of G.\n\n:χR The character of a representation ∈R⁢R(G).\n\n:A,B,K Finite abelian groups, taken to be global symmetries.\n\n:C The Z2 subgroup of outer automorphisms in ⁢Out(G) (when non-trivial), alias charge conjugation.\n\n:⁢~SU(N) The principal extension of the Lie group ⁢SU(N) by C.\n\n:X1X0 A groupoid with maps to the source and target objects in X0 of a morphism in X1.\n\n:⁢BH The delooping groupoid H1 of a group H.\n\n:⁢U(N) The Lie 2-group central extension of the Lie group ⁢SU(N) by ⁢BU(1).\n\n:A A connection on a G-bundle, alias a gauge field.\n\n:F The curvature of A.\n\n:B A curving on a gerbe, alias a 2-form gauge field.\n\n:1N The ×NN identity matrix.\n\n:A The affine space of G-connections on Σ.\n\n:ZG The partition function of the G gauge theory on Σ.\n\nWe work in the conventions in which the Chern–Weil form representing the first Chern class of a bundle is given by the curvature of a connection divided by ⁢2π, that is =c1⁢Tr(F⁢2π), so that ∈∫Σ⁢Tr(F⁢2π)Z. Conventions for gerbes are adapted with same factors of 1⁢2π. Our normalization and conventions for the fields follow [52], and in particular the gauge field A is anti-Hermitian. The imaginary unit =i-1 appearing in the action functionals is adapted to this normalization.\n\nTo avoid confusion, we specify a p-form symmetry group with a superscript (p). When a group is indicated without subscript, we refer to its group and topological properties, regardless of its action in the field theory. The notation Zk indicates the cyclic subgroup of ⁢U(1) consisting of the kth roots of unity, and we denote a p-form cyclic symmetry as ⊂Zk(p)⁢U(1)(p). To distinguish an element ∈x⁢u(1) tangent to ⁢U(1) at a kth root of unity from the root itself, we write ∈x{0,1,…,-k1}.\n\nThe symbol ≅ is used to denote isomorphisms of objects in a particular category (of groups, rings, vector spaces, etc.). For example, we write ≅R1R2 if and only if the two representations R1 and R2 are isomorphic.\n\nAppendix B Orthogonal gauge algebras\n\nB.1 θ-terms and anomalies\n\nWe consider the family of theories with gauge algebra ⁢so(N) where N is even, and analyse the possible θ-angles and anomalies. The ensuing analysis is inspired by [103], and adapts the ideas therein to two dimensions.\n\nConsider the Lie group ⁢Spin(N). Its centre is given by\n\n=⁢Z(⁢Spin(N)){×Z2Z2,=Nmod04,Z2,=Nmod14,Z4,=Nmod24,Z2,=Nmod34.\n\nClosely related is the group ⁢SO(N), of which ⁢Spin(N) is an extension by the group =AZ2:\n\n1⟶A⟶⁢Spin(N)⟶⁢SO(N)⟶1.\n\nPrincipal ⁢SO(N)-bundles ⟶PΣ are characterized by their second Stiefel–Whitney class ∈⁢w2(P)⁢H2(Σ,A), obstructing the lift of P to a ⁢Spin(N)-bundle.\n\nOn the other hand, the group ⁢O(N) is an extension of ⁢SO(N) by a different group =CZ2:\n\n1⟶C⟶⁢O(N)⟶⁢SO(N)⟶1.\n\nThis Z2 group is identified with charge conjugation. The obstruction to reducing an ⁢O(N)-bundle ⟶PΣ to an ⁢SO(N)-bundle is its first Stiefel–Whitney class ∈⁢w1(P)⁢H1(Σ,C). One can also combine the two Z2 extensions of ⁢SO(N) to form the group ⁢Pin+(N).\n\nFinally, for even N, one can further take the quotient =⁢PSO(N)/⁢SO(N)Z2, which corresponds to gauging the intrinsic 1-form symmetry.\n\nFor =Nmod24, we can start from ⁢Spin(N) Yang–Mills theory, based on a principal ⁢Spin(N)-bundle ⟶PΣ, and gauge the 1-form symmetry =Z(1)Z4(1) in two steps. There is a non-trivial group extension\n\n1⟶A⟶Z4⟶B⟶1 (B.1)\n\nwith A≅B≅Z2 (we denote them with different symbols to avoid confusion). By gauging A we obtain ⁢SO(N) Yang–Mills theory.\n\nIn more detail, we turn on the background\n\nβ:=+⁢w2B(P)⁢2w2A(P)∈⁢H2(Σ,Z4),\n\nwhere ⁢w2A(P) corresponds to the Stiefel–Whitney class we want to sum over to pass from ⁢Spin(N) to ⁢SO(N) gauge theory, and ⁢w2B(P) is the characteristic class of the bundle P for the remaining =B(1)Z2(1) 1-form symmetry. In the notation of the main text, we embed A and B into ⁢U(1) to obtain the identifications\n\nw2A(P)=⁢2a⁢2π,w2B(P)=⁢2B⁢2π\n\nfor 2-form gauge fields a and B, respectively. A Z4-gauge transformation shifts β by an element of ⁢H2(Σ,⁢4Z), corresponding to the standard gauge transformation of the fields a and B.\n\nCoupling the ⁢Spin(N) gauge theory to such a background allows for a discrete θ-angle classified by Z4, which we write as\n\n=⁢2πκ4∫Σβ⁢πκ∫Σ(+⁢12w2B(P)⁢w2A(P)).\n\nHere κ has periodicity ∼κ+κ4. To gauge A(1) we sum over topological classes of bundles labelled by ∈⁢w2A(P)⁢H2(Σ,A).\n\nHaving gauged A(1), the ⁢SO(N) gauge theory has a Pontryagin dual K(-1)=^A(-1) (-1)-form symmetry. We want to couple the theory to a 0-form gauge field K for this =K(-1)Z2(-1) (-1)-form symmetry. By reasoning along the lines of [103, Section 4], but now with the magnetic symmetry being a (-1)-form symmetry, we find the coupling\n\n+⁢π∫Σ⁢w2A(P)(-κ⁢2iK)⁢π2∫Σ⁢w2B(P)(-κ⁢2iK),\n\nwith the understanding that ⁢w2A(P) is summed over while ⁢w2B(P) and K are background fields which are kept fixed. The first term is gauge-invariant, and it is also invariant under (-1)-form background gauge transformations. The second term, however, is not invariant under K(-1) background gauge transformations. This is a manifestation of the mixed anomaly of [26], except that here it involves the lower form symmetry.\n\nB.2 Orbifolds and spontaneous symmetry breaking\n\nWe study orbifolds of two-dimensional Yang–Mills theory with gauge group G whose gauge algebra is =g⁢so(N), and analyze the fate of charge conjugation symmetry.\n\nLet us focus on =G⁢SO(N) with ∈N⁢2N; throughout this subappendix only we write =N⁢2r. Its tensor representations are in correspondence with Young diagrams of row lengths at most r, where the last row length comes with a sign. Spinor representations can also be put in correspondence with Young diagrams whose row lengths are shifted by a half-integer. Of particular interest to us are the following representations:\n\n•\n\nThe vector representation □, with Casimir =⁢C2(□)-N1.\n\n•\n\nThe spinor representation s corresponding to =Ri12 for all =i1,…,r, with Casimir =⁢C2(s)⁢N8(-N1).\n\n•\n\nThe cospinor representation c corresponding to =Ri12 for all =i1,…,-r1 and =Rr-12, with Casimir =⁢C2(c)⁢N8(-N1).\n\nThe spinor and cospinor representations have equal quadratic Casimir invariant as well as equal dimension, and are exchanged under charge conjugation.\n\nWe now gauge the 1-form symmetry =B(1)Z2(1) and turn on a discrete θ-angle with =κ1 and periodicity ∼κ+κ2. When =Nmod24, and hence r is odd, the three representations listed above survive the gauging. When =N6, the spinor and cospinor representations have lowest quadratic Casimir invariant, thus we obtain a degenerate vacuum and charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken in ⁢PSO(6) Yang–Mills theory. However, for >N8 the vector representation has lower quadratic Casimir invariant.\n\nWe note that for =N8, the vector, spinor and cospinor representations of =G⁢SO(8) all have equal quadratic Casimir invariant and equal dimension, as a consequence of the enhancement of the outer automorphism group of the Lie algebra ⁢so(8) from the cyclic group Z2 of order two to the symmetric group S3 of degree three, i.e. ⁢SO(8)-triality. It would be interesting to engineer a non-abelian orbifold of ⁢SO(8) which removes the trivial representation, so that the vacuum is three-fold degenerate and the triality S3 is spontaneously broken.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] D.

In this section we undertake a systematic study of the gauging of the non-% invertible symmetry of two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory and the ensuing % effect on Wilson loops. Specifically, we \\begin{itemize} \\par\\itemize@item@introduce a generalized $\\theta$-term in the theory after % gauging the non-invertible symmetry; and \\par\\itemize@item@show how the spontaneous breaking of charge conjugation % symmetry descends to the theory after gauging the non-invertible symmetry. \\par\\end{itemize} As we discuss below, these apply equally well after gauging only a subset of % the non-invertible 1-form symmetry. \\par\\par\\@@numbered@section{subsection}{toc}{The non-invertible 1-form % symmetry} \\par It was shown in \\cite[cite]{[\\@@bibref{Number}{Nguyen:2021naa}{}{}]} that% pure $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theory in two dimensions admits a vast % class of zero-dimensional topological symmetry operators, defined as follows. % Let $\\mathrm{SU}(N)^{\\#}$ denote the set of conjugacy classes in $\\mathrm{SU}(% N)$. Take a point $\\wp\\in\\Sigma$ and a conjugacy class $[U_{0}]\\in\\mathrm{SU}(% N)^{\\#}$, for an arbitrary element $U_{0}\\in\\mathrm{SU}(N)$. Delete $\\wp$ and % require that the gauge connection $A$ has holonomy in $[U_{0}]$ around the % puncture. The path integral over such gauge fields gives rise to a zero-% dimensional gauge-invariant disorder operator $V_{\\wp}[U_{0}]$, analogous to a% Gukov--Witten operator. It is topological thanks to the invariance of two-% dimensional Yang--Mills theory under area-preserving diffeomorphisms, and % therefore we henceforth omit the subscript $\\wp$ indicating its location. It % is gauge-invariant by construction, as only the conjugacy class of the % holonomy is fixed rather than the holonomy itself. \\par Let us briefly review how these local topological operators act on the % Wilson lines. Consider for simplicity a disk $\\mathbb{D}$ of area $\\frac{1}{2}% $ with a Wilson loop in the representation $R$ running along the boundary with% opposite orientation, as in Subsection \\ref{sec:reading}. We recall that the % path integral with the Wilson loop inserted is denoted $\\langle W_{R}\\rangle$ % and evaluates to \\eqref{eq:WRvevdisk}. If we insert a disorder operator $V[U_{% 0}]$ at an arbitrary point in the interior of the disk, a standard computation% shows that \\begin{equation}\\langle V[U_{0}]\\,W_{R}\\rangle=\\chi_{R}(U_{0})\\ \\mathrm{e}^{-% \\frac{g^{2}}{4}\\,C_{2}(R)}\\ ,\\end{equation} which in general differs from the correlator without the insertion of the % topological symmetry operators. The two invariant cases are $U_{0}=\\mathbbm{1}% _{N}$ (trivial topological operator) and $R=\\emptyset$ (trivial Wilson line). \\par The topological symmetry operators thus constructed are generically non-% invertible \\cite[cite]{[\\@@bibref{Number}{Nguyen:2021naa}{}{}]}. As a concrete% example, if $N\\in 4\\operatorname{\\mathbb{N}}$ then one of the operators is % associated to the conjugacy class $[U_{0}]$ with representative \\begin{equation*}U_{0}=\\text{diag}(\\underbrace{1,\\dots,1}_{N/2},\\underbrace{-1% ,\\dots,-1}_{N/2})\\ \\in\\ \\mathrm{SU}(N)\\ .\\end{equation*} For this choice, the correlator \\eqref{eq:noninv1form} vanishes for a large % set of representations, including the fundamental representation. Therefore % the topological symmetry operator annihilates the corresponding Wilson loops, % and hence does not admit an inverse. \\par Demanding invertibility and imposing the special unitary constraint on $U% _{0}$, we are left with operators associated to the conjugacy classes of % elements $U_{0}\\in\\mathsf{Z}(\\mathrm{SU}(N))=\\operatorname{\\mathbb{Z}}_{N}$, % thus recovering the usual 1-form centre symmetry $\\mathsf{Z}^{% \\scriptscriptstyle(1)}$ as the invertible subset of this larger set of % symmetries.

This is not generically % the case, and there are three possibilities: \\begin{enumerate}[1)] \\par\\enumerate@item@If $k=\\frac{N}{k}$, then the coefficient in \\eqref{% mixanomalous} is just enough to preserve invariance under both $\\mathsf{B}^{% \\scriptscriptstyle(1)}$ and $\\mathsf{K}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(-1)}$ background % gauge transformations. More generally, if $k$ is an integer multiple of $\\frac% {N}{k}$, i.e.\\leavevmode\\nobreak\\ $k^{2}\\in N\\,\\mathbb{Z}$, then \\eqref{% mixanomalous} is also invariant under $\\mathsf{K}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(-1)}$ % background gauge transformations. \\par\\enumerate@item@If $k^{2}\\notin N\\operatorname{\\mathbb{Z}}$, then \\eqref{% mixanomalous} is improperly quantized and is not invariant under general $% \\mathsf{K}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(-1)}$ background gauge transformations. \\par\\enumerate@item@If $\\mathrm{gcd}(k,\\frac{N}{k})=m>1$, then a subgroup $% \\operatorname{\\mathbb{Z}}_{m}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(1)}\\subset\\check{\\mathsf{B}}% ^{\\scriptscriptstyle(1)}$ is anomaly-free. \\par\\end{enumerate} The lack of background gauge invariance if both background fields are turned % on indicates the presence of a mixed anomaly. \\par\\par\\@@numbered@section{subsection}{toc}{Mixed 2-group anomaly} \\par As we have seen, charge conjugation $\\mathsf{C}^{\\scriptscriptstyle(0)}$ % acts on the 1-form symmetry $\\operatorname{\\mathbb{Z}}_{N}^{\\scriptscriptstyle% (1)}$.
