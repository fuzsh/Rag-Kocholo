        "text": "32 See Alessandra Nardi, ‘Il Collezionismo alla Torre del Gallo tra Ottocento e Novecento’, MA thesis, University of Florence, 2010, Part I, Chapters 1–2 (‘Il Collezionismo dei Conti Galletti’, and ‘La Collezione Galileiana alla Torre del Gallo’), especially pp. 32–42. There were two portraits of Viviani, too: see Nardi, op. cit., p. 42. Paolo Galletti (1851–1914) started toying with the idea that Galileo could have made a number of his telescopic observations from the estate of Torre del Gallo, which his family had acquired in 1848 (see Galletti, Paolo, Galileo alla Torre del Gallo, Florence: Le Monnier, 1879 Google Scholar; and Palagi, Giuseppe, Milton e Galileo alla Torre del Gallo, Florence: Le Monnier, 1877 Google Scholar). Galletti's collection of Galileiana soon caught the attention of Antonio Favaro (1847–1922), the foremost Galileo scholar of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and editor in chief of the Edizione Nazionale of Galileo's works. The two were nearly of the same age, and soon started a long and friendly correspondence, exchanging opinions and documents: their letters, of which seventy-four survive, are preserved in Pisa, as a small but significant part of the huge Favaro archive housed at the Domus Galilaeana. Beginning with 1872, when he became the sole owner of Torre del Gallo, Galletti restored the edifice and promoted it as a century-old astronomical observatory, housing a gradually expanding Galileo Museum with what became an extraordinary collection of pictures, documents, scientific instruments, books and manuscripts. Brief descriptions of Galletti's collection are offered in Galletti, Paolo, Cenni sulla Torre del Gallo, Proprietà del Conte Paolo Galletti e sul Panorama che vi si Ammira, il Più Stupendo di Tutti i Dintorni di Firenze, Florence: Tipografia della Gazzetta d'Italia, 1875 Google Scholar; and Galletti, Collezione Galileiana Esistente alla Torre del Gallo, Villa Galletti, Florence: Pineider, [1879]Google Scholar; del Balzo, Carlo, Il Mio Regalo di Nozze agli Sposi Young-Lady Lilly Mac-Swiney e Conte Paolo Galletti, Naples: R.

She was the wife of Ferdinand I de’ Medici (1549–1609; brother of Francesco, 1541–1587), the mother of Cosimo II de’ Medici (1590–1621), and the grandmother of Ferdinand II de’ Medici (1610–1670), all Grand Dukes of Tuscany. When Cosimo II died, leaving his ten-year-old son Ferdinand as Grand Duke, Christina and her daughter-in-law, Maria Maddalena of Austria, acted as regents until the boy came of age. Together, they aligned Tuscany with the papacy and redoubled the Tuscan clergy; upon the death of the last Duke of Urbino, instead of claiming the duchy for Ferdinand, they permitted it to be annexed by Pope Urban VIII. To Christina, Galileo addressed one of his most famous Copernican works, the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina, originally written in 1611 and circulated in manuscript in 1615 (it was eventually published only as Galilei, Galileo, Lettera … Scritta alla Granduchessa di Toscana, Florence: [s.e.], 1710 Google Scholar; in OG 5, pp. 309–348; English translation by Finocchiaro, Maurice A., ‘Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina’, in Finocchiaro, The Galileo Affair: A Documentary History, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1989, pp. 87–118 Google Scholar). In the letter, Galileo offers a carefully considered summary of his opinions on the proper relation of science to religion: the Holy Scripture cannot err, but it has to be properly understood, going beyond a purely literal reading of the text. Nature and Scripture are both dictated by God, and cannot contradict each other, and when an apparent contradiction surfaces, between sensory experiences and necessary demonstrations, on the one hand, and textual interpretations, on the other, we should review the latter.\n\n200 Almost as soon as he discovered Jupiter's satellites, Galileo tried to compile tables in order to be able to predict their situations, relations and eclipses, thereby determining the longitude of the place of observation at any hour of the night (a ready method of finding longitudes at sea had long been an object of search by all the maritime powers of Europe). In July 1612, Belisario Vinta started a correspondence on this subject with the representative of the Spanish court, Orso d'Elci; the correspondence went on for a few months (Galileo wrote a letter on 7 September, too), but stopped in October. The negotiations were resumed in June 1616 and protracted until December 1620 (also including Galileo's design for the celatone, in 1617), with several exchanges between Orso d'Elci, Curzio Picchena and Giuliano de’ Medici, but once again led nowhere. The issue was finally taken up again in May 1630, but failed and any plans were eventually given up in October 1632, after several exchanges between Esaù Del Borgo and Andrea Cioli. New negotiations were started with representatives of the States General of Holland in August 1636, through the good offices of Galileo's friend Elia Diodati in Paris (Galileo knew about the prize established by the Holland Provinces for a solution of the problem of longitude, already in October 1627, from a letter of Alfonso Antonini; at the time, however, he was interested in the negotiations with the Spanish court, whose third phase he resumed in 1630). These new negotiations dragged on for a while, but were interrupted by the sudden death of Martin van den Hove (Hortensius), in August 1636, and were eventually suspended in April 1640, also due to Galileo's health conditions. On the whole issue see Viviani's Racconto Istorico, in OG 19, pp. 614–615, 618–621, as well as his recollections in the letter to Prince Leopoldo, ibid., pp. 650–657. See also Favaro, op. cit. (197), pp. 101–148 (Spain) and 289–338 (Holland).\n\n212 That is, Vincenzo Viviani himself. We find this epithet also in the title pages of Viviani, op. cit. (20); Viviani, op. cit. (21); and Viviani, Formazione, e Misura di Tutti i Cieli, Florence: Piero Matini, 1692 Google Scholar; as well as in his will: Viviani, op. cit. (12), p. 3. In the letter to ‘Noble Beginner Geometers’ (‘Nobili Geometri Principianti’) of Viviani, op. cit. (20), f. *5r, he says, ‘FORSE alcuno vi sarà che m'attribuirà a soverchia ambizione il palesarmi in fronte di quest'Opera per ultimo Discepolo del Galileo; ma però molti più saranno quei, che me n'invidieranno. Il fatto si è che, per mia grande ventura, io son l'ultimo suo Discepolo, perchè egli mi fu continuo Maestro per gli ultimi tre anni di sua Vita, e di quanti ci trovammo presenti all'ultimo suo respiro, (che oltre a due Sacerdoti, v'interuennero il Torricelli, il Dottor Vincenzio Galilei suo figliuolo, e gli altri di sua Casa) io solo, (benchè l'ultimo, nell'essermene approfittato) sono a tutti sopravvissuto, e quasi anche rimasto l'ultimo di quanti più intimamente lo praticarono’ (‘There might be someone who will blame my self-description as the last pupil of Galileo, on the title page of this work, on excessive yearning; but many more will be those who will crave for it. As a matter of fact, I was very fortunate to be his very last pupil, as he was my teacher continuously, throughout the last three years of his life; and of those who were present when he breathed his last (besides two priests, Torricelli, Doctor Vincenzo Galilei his son, and other relatives of his) I alone – although the least to take advantage from this – have outlived them all, and am nearly the last of those who assiduously frequented him’). Indeed, all other pupils of Galileo died shortly after him, or at any rate before 1674, when Viviani first used the epithet: Benedetto Castelli in 1643; Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger and Mario Guiducci in 1646; Bonaventura Cavalieri, Vincenzo Renieri and Evangelista Torricelli in 1647; Clemente Settimi probably in the late 1640s or early 1650s; Braccio Manetti in 1652; Giovanni Battista Rinuccini in 1653; Pier Francesco Rinuccini in 1657; Antonio Santini in 1662; Famiano Michelini in 1666; Andrea Arrighetti in 1672. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, died in 1649, and his sister Livia in 1659; Galileo's other daughter, Virginia, had already died in 1634. Galileo outlived some of his pupils, too: Niccolò Aggiunti died in 1635, Niccolò Arrighetti in 1639, Dino Peri in 1640, and Iacopo Soldani in 1641. No doubt, of all of them Viviani was the most devoted, and spent his entire life in the effort to have Galileo's works and correspondence published, as well as his memory celebrated: see Favaro, op. cit. (19), pp. 1097–1130.\n\n236 ‘Imo octo’, Nelli remarks (op. cit. (11), vol. 2, p. 866); see also Nelli, op. cit. (28), p. 15: ‘immo novem tantum’); Albèri, in turn, corrects Nelli: ‘Imo decem’ (Albèri in Le Opere di Galileo Galilei, op. cit. (26), vol. 15, p. 380). In fact, whereas Galileo did live in Arcetri from September 1631 to January 1642 (that is, for a little over ten years), Viviani is not talking about the time Galileo actually lived in the estate of Esaù Martellini, but the time he spent ‘occupying himself with the sciences’ (scientijs uacauerat). Most likely, moreover, Viviani was not specifically referring to Galileo's last residence (Villa Il Gioiello) in Arcetri but used it to refer, more generally, to the time Galileo spent in Florence and its surroundings, practising and writing about science. Indeed, during the years he spent in Padua (early December 1592–early September 1611) Galileo often returned to Florence for the summer, living either in one of the summer residences of the Grand Duke (such as the Medici villas at Pratolino or La Ferdinanda in Artimino), or with his sister Virginia (in the neighbourhood of the Church of the Carmine). And from the time he took up his position as the primary mathematician and philosopher of the Grand Duke (save for his journeys, of course, especially those to Rome), he spent ‘over thirty years’ in or near Florence, as Viviani says, working on a number of scientific issues: first, in a house he rented on the south shore of the river Arno; then (from 15 August 1617) at the Villa L'Ombrellino, in Bellosguardo; and finally (from 9 September 1631) in the Villa Il Gioiello in Arcetri (in 1638 he was granted to move temporarily to his house in Costa San Giorgio, in Florence, next to his son Vincenzo's). He also spent time at the Medici Villas La Petraia and in Marignolle, on the outskirts of Florence; at the so-called Villa Michelangelo, in Settignano, as a guest of Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger; and he spent long and fruitful periods at Filippo Salviati's Villa Le Selve in Lastra a Signa. In Florence Galileo published On Floating Bodies, in 1612, after extensive discussions documented in several letters; see also the 1625 correspondence on hydraulics in OG 13, pp. 291–294. In Florence, he observed the moon, Jupiter's satellites, lunar eclipses, ‘tricorporeal’ Saturn, the phases of Venus, and sunspots; he also engaged in long negotiations with representatives of the Spanish Court about using the period of Jupiter's satellites in order to calculate longitudes: see, for example, Galileo's letters to Christopher Clavius and Benedetto Castelli, 30 December 1610 (in OG 10, nos 446–447, pp. 499–505); to Gallanzone Gallanzoni, 16 July 1611 (in OG 11, no 555, pp. 141–155); to Christoph Grienberger, 1 September 1611 (in OG 11, no 576, pp. 178–203); to Maffeo Barberini, later to become Pope Urban VIII, 2 June 1612 (in OG 11, no 684, pp. 304–311); and to Pedro de Castro, Francisco de Sandoval and Orso d'Elci, 13 November 1616 (in OG 12, nos 1233–1235, pp. 289–295). In Bellosguardo, Galileo worked on the microscope, on his reply to Francesco Ingoli, and on his theory of tides and other parts of the Dialogue, as well as making several telescopic observations: see, for example, the calculations recorded in OG 3, pp. 473, 701–702; and Galileo's letters to Federico Cesi, 23 September 1624 (in OG 13, no 1665, pp. 208–209) and to Benedetto Castelli, 2 August 1627 (in OG 13, no 1832, pp. 370–371). In Bellosguardo, Galileo worked on fluid mechanics, too, and offered suggestions for the design of the facade of the cathedral of Florence: see, for example, Galileo's report on the river Bisenzio (1631), in OG 6, pp. 627–647; and his letter to Andrea Cioli, 7 March 1631 (in OG 14, no 2115, pp. 215–218). During his frequent stays at Salviati's Villa Le Selve, Galileo conceived and wrote the first and third letter on sunspots (see OG 5, pp. 94–113, 186–239; Galileo dedicated Letters on Sunspots to his good friend Filippo Salviati, who is one of the interlocutors of his Dialogue and Two New Sciences), and made many telescopic observations of sunspots and Jupiter's satellites, as well as performing several other scientific activities (such as the study of the centre of gravity of solids): see, for example, Galileo's letter to Federico Cesi, 5 January 1613 (in OG 11, no 827, pp. 459–461); and the many observations recorded in OG 3, pp. 446, 448, 452–453. Finally, in Arcetri, Galileo worked for several years on Two New Sciences, as well as performing many astronomical observations (discovering the librations of the moon, for example: see Galileo to Alfonso Antonini, 20 February 1638, in OG 17, no 3684, pp. 291–297), responding to objections, and discussing at length with Benedetto Castelli about geometrical issues. He also spent considerable time on negotiations about his solution to the problem of longitude with representatives of the United Provinces of Holland, and engaged in exchanges, equally friendly and critical, with Fortunio Liceti. See, for example, Galileo's letters to Alfonso Antonini, 20 February 1638 (in OG 17, no 3684, pp. 291–297); to Giovanni Battista Baliani, 1 August 1638 (in OG 18, no 3897, pp. 75–79); and to Pierre de Carcavi, 5 June 1637 (in OG 17, no 3494, pp. 88–93); and those he received from Bonaventura Cavalieri, 22 July 1634 (in OG 16, no 2968, p. 113), and Benedetto Castelli, 12 December 1637 (in OG 17, no 3618, pp. 233–234) and 19 August 1639 (in OG 18, no 3905, pp. 85–86).\n\n241 The printed version and the actual inscriptions also offer two other short texts, which appear in the two scagliola cartouches on either side of Galileo's bust. The cartouche on the left presents a bas-relief of a man looking at Jupiter's satellites with the telescope, on the stern of a ship (a reference to Galileo's telescopic discoveries, published in Sidereus Nuncius, and to their possible applications in the determination of longitude); the text reads: ‘Este Duces, ô si qua via est. Virgil. Æneid. lib. VI’ (‘Be my guides, if any way there be. Vergil, Aeneid, VI 194’). The second cartouche, on the right of the bust above the entrance, represents a man observing sunspots with a telescope, a man watching the (parabolic) course of a cannonball, and a beam breaking under its own weight; the text reads (with obvious references to Galileo's On Sunspots and Two New Sciences): ‘In Sole, quis credat? retectas / Arte tua, Galilæe, labes. urb. viii. p.m.’ (‘Spots revealed on the Sun, who would believe that? Thanks to your science, Galileo. Urban VIII, Pope’); the source is the ‘Adulatio perniciosa’, a poem Cardinal Maffeo Barberini (later to become Pope Urban VIII, in 1623), an early admirer of Galileo, wrote in celebration of his telescopic discoveries: see Barberini, Maffeo, Poemata, Paris: Antoine Estienne, 1620, pp. 46–49 Google Scholar (the quotation is from p. 47, lines 21–22); Cardinal Barberini sent Galileo the poem on 28 August 1620, attached to a letter expressing his profound admiration and consideration for Galileo's work: see OG 13, no 1479, pp. 48–49. We also have a few letters Cardinal Barberini and Galileo exchanged in June 1612, praising the discovery of sunspots. In the printed version, these two quotes are introduced, respectively, by ‘In Diaglyptico Phrenoschemate G’ (‘In the carved emblem G’) and ‘In Diaglyptico Phrenoschemate H’ (‘In the carved emblem H’). The adjective diaglypticus is loan from the Greek διάγλυπτος, ‘carved’. For the translation of phrenoschema, see Donati, Alessandro, Ars Poetica, Rome: Guglielmo Facciotti, 1631, pp. 378–388 Google Scholar (Book 3, Chapter XXXII: ‘Figurata Epigrammata, vulgò Impresiæ’); and Kircher, Athanasius, Œdipvs Ægyptiacus: Hoc Est Universalis Hieroglyphicae Veterum Doctrinae Temporum Iniuria Abolitae Instavratio, 3 vols., Rome: Vitale Mascardi, 1652–1654, vol. 2(1), pp. 7–8 Google Scholar (Chapter II: ‘De Emblemate, & Impresia, siue Phrenoschemate’). The two bas-reliefs, designed by Foggini, are also cast in a bronze medal, c.1680: on one side, Galileo's profile; on the other, besides the symbolic images in the second cartouche, a representation of a pendulum and of free fall, as well as of Jupiter's satellites, the phases of the Moon and Venus, and a comet. On the side with Galileo's profile, we read the inscription: ‘GALILEVS LYNCEVS’ (‘Galileo, Lyncean’); on the opposite side, the inscriptions: ‘NATVRAMQVE NOVAT’ (‘Renovator of Nature’) and ‘MEMORIÆ OPTIMI PRÆCEPTORIS VINC. VIVIANIVS’ (‘To the memory of the Greatest of Preceptors, from Vincenzo Viviani’). See OGA 1, M4, pp. 520–521."
