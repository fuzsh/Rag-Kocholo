        "text": "Introduced in Percy Jackson & the Olympians\n\nedit\n\nPercy Jackson\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Percy Jackson\n\nPerseus \"Percy\" Jackson is a demigod, son of the mortal, Sally Jackson, and the Greek god of the sea, Poseidon. Percy lives in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, but found his life uprooted upon discovering his true paternity. He has black hair and sea-green eyes. He has inherited special abilities from Poseidon which include the ability to control water, boats, and ships; to create small hurricanes; to breathe and see clearly underwater, and to talk to horse-like creatures and most aquatic animals. He is also a gifted swordsman using his shape-shifting sword pen named Anaklusmos (Ancient Greek for \"Riptide\") for battle. The pen was created by Zoë Nightshade, and when uncapped changes into a celestial bronze sword. If he loses it, it will always appear back in his pocket.\n\nPercy struggles significantly in his mortal life. He, like most demigods, was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. This made him the subject of bullying from his peers. His mother was once married to Gabe Ugliano (Smelly Gabe), an abusive, gambling-addicted alcoholic. His repugnant mortal odor masked Percy's demigod scent, hiding him from monsters. At the end of The Lightning Thief, Sally turned Gabe into stone using Medusa's head. Later, she marries Paul Blofis, whom she genuinely loves, and they have a daughter named Estelle. Percy begins dating Annabeth at the end of The Last Olympian.\n\nPercy is the first-person narrator in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. He appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus, The Hidden Oracle, The Tower of Nero, The Son of Sobek, and The Crown of Ptolemy.\n\nIn the films, Percy Jackson is portrayed by Logan Lerman. In the musical, he is portrayed by Chris McCarrell. Walker Scobell and Azriel Dalman portray the role in the TV series.\n\nGrover Underwood\n\nedit\n\nGrover Underwood is a satyr and Percy's best friend. He appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus and The Burning Maze.\n\nHe has curly reddish-brown hair and fur, acne, and a wispy goatee. His horns grow larger as the series progresses, and he must take increasingly careful measures to hide them and his goat legs while posing as a human. In The Lightning Thief, Chiron states that Grover is small even for his age: He is twenty-eight then, but because satyrs mature half the speed of humans, he is considered a teenager. Grover is quite sensitive and attached to nature. Like all satyrs, he can sense emotions and sense monsters and demigods. As the series progresses, his concern for his friends and the pursuit of his goals leads him to take on leadership roles and become more confident. Unlike his demigod friends, Grover is not an orthodox fighter. Instead, he uses reed pipes or a cudgel. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, Grover begins a relationship with the dryad Juniper.\n\nIn The Lightning Thief, he gets a \"searcher's license\" after delivering Percy safely, allowing him to search for the lost god Pan. When Polyphemus captures him in The Sea of Monsters, he activates an empathy link, a psychic bond with Percy created a year before that allows telepathic communication across great distances. He uses this to guide Percy to his rescue. At the end of The Last Olympian, he is named a Lord of the Wild and given a seat on the satyrs' ruling council, the Council of Cloven Elders.\n\nIn The Heroes of Olympus series, Grover mainly appears as one of Camp Half-Blood's satyr allies reporting on Gaea's rising and participating in negotiations with the Romans to get Reyna to help transport the Athena Parthenos statue across the world.\n\nIn The Dark Prophecy, Meg McCaffrey summons Grover after getting a prophecy stating that she and Apollo will need a satyr guide. In The Burning Maze, Grover guides the two through the Labyrinth and, alongside the other nature spirits, aids in their fight against Medea and Caligula. After the death of Medea and Helios fading from existence, ending the California wildfires that he was causing, Grover returns to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nIn The Chalice of the Gods, taking place between The Heroes of Olympus and The Trials of Apollo, Grover volunteers to join Percy's quests to get recommendation letters from the gods so that he can get into New Rome University. Grover uses his nature spirit connections to help search for Ganymede's chalice of immortality and then to help Percy sneak into Mount Olympus to return it to Ganymede in the midst of Zeus' brunch for his mother Rhea.\n\nIn the films, he is portrayed by Brandon T. Jackson and Bjorn Yearwood as young Grover in the second film. In the musical, he is portrayed by George Salazar. Aryan Simhadri portrays Grover in the TV series.\n\nAnnabeth Chase\n\nedit\n\n\"Annabeth Chase\" redirects here. For the Close to Home character, see Close to Home (2005 TV series).\n\nAnnabeth Chase is the child of Athena and West Point history professor Frederick Chase. She has an extensive paternal family including Magnus Chase. She appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero, The Demigod Diaries, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades and The Blood of Olympus. She is described as having honey-blonde hair and gray eyes. She is described by her teacher Chiron as \"territorial about her friends\", which is manifested in some moments of jealousy and distrust. In The Lightning Thief, it is revealed that she also suffers from arachnophobia, a fear shared by her siblings due to their mother's relationship with Arachne, whom Athena turned into a spider.\n\nAnnabeth ran away from her father and stepfamily at age seven and encountered Luke Castellan and Thalia Grace. They lived as runaways until they were found by Grover Underwood and taken to Camp Half-Blood. Thalia temporarily perished when they reached Camp Half-Blood. Annabeth remained attached to Luke and convinced of his goodness even after his decision to support Kronos. He was also her first love interest. Her attempts to bring Luke back into the fold are an important theme in the books.\n\nAt the end of the series, she plans to finish high school in New York and then attend college in New Rome, with her boyfriend, Percy Jackson. In The Hidden Oracle, one of her friends states that Annabeth had gone to Boston for \"some family emergency\" — searching for her cousin Magnus Chase.\n\nAt the end of The Trials of Apollo, Annabeth starts attending New Rome University with Percy after helping him in The Chalice of the Gods to get the godly recommendation letters that Percy needs.\n\nHer main weapon is a short celestial bronze knife given to her by Luke Castellan. In The Last Olympian, it was found to be a cursed blade, which Luke used to eject Kronos from his soul, consequently killing himself. After losing it in The House of Hades, she uses a drakon-bone sword given to her by the giant Damasen in Tartarus. In The Kane Chronicles crossover series, she also uses Sadie Kane's wand when it turns into a dagger similar to the one Luke gave her. Annabeth also owns an invisibility Yankees cap, a gift from her mother. At the end of The Battle of the Labyrinth, Daedalus gives Annabeth his incredibly advanced laptop, which she loses in Tartarus in The Mark of Athena. In the third book of Magnus Chase series, Annabeth wears a UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design shirt, implying that is where she goes to college. Annabeth also has dyslexia and ADHD but is good at keeping it in check.\n\nIn the films, she is portrayed by Alexandra Daddario and Alisha Newton as young Annabeth in the second film. In the musical, she is portrayed by Kristin Stokes. Leah Jeffries portrays Annabeth in the TV series.\n\nLuke Castellan\n\nedit\n\nLuke Castellan was a 19-year-old son of Hermes and May Castellan. He appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth and The Last Olympian.\n\nIntroduced initially as the friendly head counselor of the Hermes cabin, Luke is revealed to serve Kronos at the end of The Lightning Thief. He is resentful of his father, who adhered to the gods' policy of non-interference despite Luke's mother May Castellan's mental illness after her failed attempt to become the host of the Oracle of Delphi. Having had enough of his mother's \"fits\", Luke ran away from home at nine years old and eventually arrived at camp aged fourteen with Annabeth Chase and Thalia Grace. After the loss of Thalia, a failed quest and continued silence from Hermes, Luke's ongoing resentment turned into a strong hatred of his father and the other gods. Described as decent and kind before Kronos, he behaved with volatility and violence after his defection. Though Luke originally served Kronos willingly, the horrors he witnessed during the Battle of Manhattan convinced him to fight against his former master, eventually committing suicide to destroy the Titan, who was using Luke as his host, by stabbing himself in his Achilles Heel with a celestial bronze knife he had given to Annabeth when they first met. When he died, Luke reiterates what Ethan Nakamura had told Percy before: unclaimed children and unrecognized gods deserve more respect than they have been given. Percy later fulfills his request.\n\nLuke is described as handsome, with sandy blonde hair, blue eyes, and a long scar on the side of his face, given to him by Ladon the Dragon during his failed quest. Besides the ability to open locks with his mind, which he inherited from his father, Luke is an excellent swordsman. He receives a sword named \"Backbiter\" from Kronos at the end of The Lightning Thief. It is later reforged as Kronos's scythe and has the ability to harm both mortals and immortals because of its double-edged blade, half steel, half celestial bronze. From Halcyon Green, he receives a diary he later entrusts to Chiron, and a celestial bronze knife he later gives to Annabeth with a promise to always remain her family. The knife becomes cursed after Luke's defection to Kronos. From his father Luke receives magic flying shoes, which he later curses and gives to Percy, but Percy gives the shoes to Grover. Just before giving himself over completely to host the spirit of Kronos, Luke bathes in the River Styx and obtains the invincibility of Achilles.\n\nIn the films, he is portrayed by Jake Abel and Samuel Braun as the young Luke in the second film. In the musical, he is portrayed by James Hayden Rodriguez. Charlie Bushnell portrays Luke in the TV series.\n\nThalia Grace\n\nedit\n\n\"Thalia Grace\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Thalia (Grace).\n\nThalia Grace is the daughter of Zeus and Beryl Grace, a TV starlet. She is seven years older than her brother Jason Grace and appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Last Olympian, The Lost Hero, The Blood of Olympus, The Dark Prophecy, and The Tyrant's Tomb.\n\nDue to her mother's abusive nature, Thalia had considered leaving home since she was little, but stayed to protect Jason. When Jason was seemingly stolen during a visit to Sonora, Thalia finally ran away and stayed on the run with Luke and Annabeth until they met Grover the satyr when she was 12. When they reached camp, Hades sent a horde of hell hounds that Thalia held off, sacrificing herself for her friends. Zeus pitied his daughter and turned her into a pine tree; her spirit then provided a magical barrier around the camp, keeping mortals and monsters out. Seven years later, she is purged from the pine tree with the Golden Fleece, which was applied to save it from poisons that were destroying the magical barrier protecting the demigods. At the end of The Titan's Curse, she becomes the lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis, which freezes her age the night before her 16th birthday and prevents her from being the child of the prophecy.\n\nThalia has bright blue eyes and short, spiky black hair, and wears black eyeliner and punk style clothing. Jason describes her as having a Mediterranean complexion. Annabeth and Chiron remark that her personality and character traits (like her bravery and loyalty) are very similar to Percy's. She also shares some traits with her father, such as his pride, confidence, and vehement reactions to betrayal or contradiction. An incredibly skilled warrior, she is willing to attack even Luke, who was known as the best swordsman of the last 300 years. Thalia's weapons are a replica of the shield Aegis, disguised as a silver bracelet, and a spear, disguised as a Mace can. After The Titan's Curse, she also uses a bow and hunting knives, given to her by the Hunters of Artemis. Her main power is the ability to summon lightning and generate electric shocks. In The Titan's Curse, it is revealed that she has a rather ironic fear of heights, despite being a daughter of Zeus. In The Lost Hero, she embraces her brother Jason for the first time in years, only to learn that he had lost his memory.\n\nShe is portrayed by Paloma Kwiatkowski and Katelyn Mayer as the young Thalia in the second film.\n\nZoë Nightshade\n\nedit\n\nIn The Titan’s Curse, Zoë Nightshade is introduced as one of Artemis’ huntresses. She is described as looking around 14 years of age, although it is later revealed that she is well over 2000 years old. She is also later then revealed to be a former Hesperid, daughter of Atlas and Pleione. She appears in The Titan’s Curse, along with being mentioned in The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Son of Neptune, The Blood of Olympus, The Dark Prophecy, and being seen in a flashback in The House of Hades.\n\nZoë is described by Percy as being tall, graceful and gorgeously beautiful. She had brown eyes, slightly upturned nose and long dark hair braided with a silver circlet on the top. It is also stated by Percy that she gave him the impression of a Persian princess. Although her ethnicity or race is never specified, she is known to have copper-colored skin. She is said to have the same cold look in her eyes as her father, the Titan Atlas.\n\nIn her early life, Zoë gave Hercules tips on how to trick her father, helping him complete his quest on stealing the golden apple. She then gifted him her hairpin, which turns into \"Anaklusmos\", the sword currently in the possession of Percy. After her sisters had found out about what Zoë had done, they exiled her. This pained Zoë, knowing that the Hesperides were her only family. Ultimately, Hercules never gave Zoë any credit and eventually abandoned her. As a reaction, she came to hold a grudge against male Heroes, especially those who reminded her of Hercules.\n\nAfter her incident involving Hercules, Zoë joins the hunters of Artemis, a group of eternal maidens who swears off men for semi-immortality and hunt with Artemis until they fall in battle. Zoë Nightshade eventually rose to become Artemis' loyal lieutenant for over 2000 years.\n\nZoë Nightshade makes it very clear that she dislikes Thalia Grace. Once had they ran into her, Luke Castellan, and Annabeth Chase. Zoë had asked Thalia to join the hunters, almost managing to convince her, but Thalia refuses, not wanting to leave Luke. Zoë was offended by her decision, which led them into a heated argument. This gave Thalia a strong hatred to the Hunters, especially Zoë Nightshade.\n\nThroughout the book, Zoë talks in an Early Modern, or Shakespearean, English. She also is said to speak in an old, strange accent, more heavily when upset. She would use words like ‘thou’, ‘thee’, and ‘thy’, and got irritated when Thalia would correct her speech, exclaiming “I hate this language! It changes too often!”.\n\nZoë also showed particular interest and love for the stars. After her death, caused by Ladon attacking her and Atlas’ final blow, she is turned into a constellation by the goddess Artemis. However, before she passes onto the stars, Zoë apologizes to Thalia, telling her that they could have been sisters. She also addresses Percy, telling him that she is honored he carried \"Anaklusmos\".\n\nTyson\n\nedit\n\nIn The Sea of Monsters, Tyson is introduced as Percy's bullied, childish friend. When Percy is forced to take him to camp, it is revealed that he is a baby Cyclops and thus a son of Poseidon, making him Percy's half-brother. He appears in The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The Blood of Olympus and The Tyrant's Tomb.\n\nTyson is tall with unkempt teeth and fingernails, brown hair, and eyes. He is mentally about 8 years old but highly intelligent and compassionate. As a son of Poseidon, he shares some of Percy's powers. As a Cyclops, he is immune to fire and has super strength, an uncanny ability to mimic voices, enhanced senses, and understands the \"old tongue\" (the language spoken by Gaia to her first children). Tyson is close with several characters and magical creatures in the series, including Rainbow the hippocampus, the hellhound Mrs. O'Leary, and the harpy Ella, who eventually becomes his girlfriend.\n\nIn The Sea of Monsters, Tyson first appears as a huge homeless kid that is taken in as a class project by Merriweather Prep, Percy's school. Tyson is sensitive, childish, and bullied with Percy being his only friend. However, it's also suggested that Tyson's presence in Percy's life has shielded him from attack throughout the year as monsters are too afraid to attack Percy while he is with a Cyclops. When Laistrygonian giants attack in the guise of a dodgeball game, Tyson's powers as a Cyclops shield him from harm and level the playing field, allowing him to defeat several of the giants before Annabeth Chase intervenes to finish the job. Due to her own bad experiences with Cyclopes, Annabeth reluctantly takes Tyson with them to Camp Half-Blood where his immunity to fire proves to be vital in defeating the attacking Colchis Bulls. Annabeth reveals Tyson's true nature to Percy and the young Cyclops faces a great deal of prejudice from the other campers due to his monster heritage and frustration from Percy when Poseidon claims Tyson as his son, causing Percy to be bullied as well. The sole exception to the bullying is Charles Beckendorf whose father, Hephaestus, employs Cyclopes, causing Beckendorf to befriend Tyson and train him in metalworking. When Percy and Annabeth secretly leave on a quest for the Golden Fleece, they only reluctantly take Tyson along and he befriends the hippocampus Rainbow who transports them to the Princess Andromeda. While trying to enter the Sea of Monsters, Tyson is apparently killed when the CSS Birmingham explodes as Tyson is trying to fix the engine at time, the only one capable of withstanding the extreme heat. Tyson later resurfaces on Polyphemus' island, having survived the explosion before being rescued by Rainbow. Polyphemus calls Tyson his half-brother, but Tyson helps Percy defeat Polyphemus, rejecting the other Cyclops for his evil ways. After returning to camp, Tyson repairs and upgrades Percy and Annabeth's chariot for the second chariot race and provides them with weapons. His gift to Percy, a wristwatch that Tyson had spent the summer working on, turns out to be a shield that proves to be vital in their victory. Afterward, Tyson reveals to Percy that having faced a hard life of constant monster attacks, he had prayed to their father who had led Tyson to Percy. Having received an offer to work in Poseidon's underwater Cyclops forges, Tyson leaves on Rainbow, saddening Percy who has come to see the Cyclops as a true brother.\n\nIn The Titan's Curse, Percy stays connected with Tyson through Iris's messages, although Tyson's new job and Percy's own responsibilities make this somewhat difficult to manage. At the end of the book, Tyson reveals that he has gotten permission to take the summer off and return to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nIn The Battle of the Labyrinth, Tyson returns to camp and repairs Percy's wristwatch shield which had been damaged while fighting the Manticore months before. Tyson joins the quest through the Labyrinth to find Daedalus and is at first excited to meet his idol Briares who they rescue on Alcatraz Island. However, Briares had become depressed, as all of his siblings had perished and lost the will to live, disillusioning Tyson. When Grover sets off on a side quest to find the missing wild god Pan, Tyson decides to join him despite his nervousness and allergies around satyrs. Percy, Annabeth, Grover, Rachel, Nico, and Tyson are present when Pan fades from existence. Tyson takes part in the last battle with Kronos' forces. When Briares arrives to help, he credits Tyson with his decision to help and he calls Tyson the true Hero.\n\nIn The Last Olympian, Percy meets his brother again a year later when, after the destruction of the Princess Andromeda, he ends up in Atlantis. Although the city is under siege by the ocean gods allied with Kronos, Poseidon refuses to allow Tyson to fight, leading to an argument between him and Percy because Poseidon believes that Tyson is too young to fight and must instead be protected. When Poseidon arrives to help defeat Typhon, much to Percy's joy, Tyson is leading Poseidon's army of Cyclopes. Following the defeat of Kronos, Zeus commends Tyson's bravery by making him the General of the Cyclopes. Due to Tyson's preference for a club for a weapon, Zeus promises that the gods will find him a suitable club.\n\nIn The Son of Neptune, Tyson is shown to be searching for the missing and amnesic Percy. When Percy's memories begin to return and unable to Iris message any of his friends, Percy manages to contact Tyson through a dream. Percy instructs his brother to find Ella the harpy and to meet him near the Caldecott Tunnel. After his quest, Percy summons his hellhound Mrs. O'Leary at the tunnel and she arrives with Tyson and Ella, leading to an overjoyed Percy and Tyson reuniting. Ella comments on Tyson's bravery and Percy notices that his brother is blushing, causing Percy to tease him about the romance blooming between Tyson and Ella. Tyson takes part in the Battle of New Rome, effortlessly killing the Cyclops Ma Gasket and her children and also battling Earthborn spirits with the help of advice on their weak spots from Ella. After the battle, Tyson is present when Percy is made praetor of the legion and when the Roman Senate discusses the approach of the Greek demigods.\n\nIn The Mark of Athena, Tyson is still present when the Argo II arrives. After Ella issues a prophecy, Percy discreetly orders Tyson to take Ella away, not wanting Octavian to learn of the harpy's knowledge of the lost Sibylline Books. After things go south, Percy contacts Tyson and orders him to take Ella to Camp Half-Blood where the harpy will be safe.\n\nIn The Blood of Olympus, Tyson is mentioned to have brought in a few friendly Cyclopes to aid in Camp Half-Blood's defense. When Reyna, Nico and Coach Hedge are cornered by Michael Kahale, Leila and Dakota on a yacht near Camp Half-Blood, Tyson unexpectedly arrives to help with Ella, who is now his girlfriend, and Rainbow, using his ability to mimic voices to mimic Octavian and trick the Romans into disarming themselves. Taking advantage of the surprise, Tyson effortlessly knocks Kahale unconscious with a single blow to the head, which is notable because Kahale is said to be so strong that it takes someone with an immense strength to overpower him. Tyson brings Ella and Coach Hedge back to Camp Half-Blood on Rainbow and relays Reyna's message about her intention to come at sunrise. During the ultimate battle with Gaea, Tyson leads the friendly Cyclopes against the Earth goddess and her monster army. Afterwards, with the powers of prophecy no longer working, Tyson joins Ella and Rachel Elizabeth Dare in traveling to New Rome in the hopes of reconstructing the Sibylline Books, the only source of prophecies left at the moment.\n\nIn The Tyrant's Tomb, Tyson and Ella have settled in New Rome where the harpy has been using her photographic memory to reconstruct the lost Sibylline Books while the harpy and the Cyclops run a bookstore at the same time. Ella's transcriptions take the form of tattoos on Tyson's skin rather than being put on paper, something that Apollo finds to be awkward to deal with. Tyson also has his girlfriend give him a tattoo of his friend Rainbow. Tyson and Ella help Apollo (Lester) to decipher the prophecies surrounding the current threat from Caligula, Commodus and Tarquin and later to perform a ceremony to summon Diana for help against the emperors and Tarquin's undead legion. The two are still in Diana's temple when Tarquin attacks their bookstore, looking for the Sibylline Books. After the battle, Tyson and Ella rename the bookstore Cyclops Books and provide Apollo and Meg with the first part of a new prophecy that directs them to return to New York City to face Nero.\n\nIn the films, he is portrayed by Douglas Smith. In the TV series, he will be portrayed by Daniel Diemer.[1]\n\nNico di Angelo\n\nedit\n\nNico is first seen in The Titan's Curse, as an unclaimed demigod rescued by Percy, Annabeth, Thalia, and Grover. At the end of the novel, it is revealed that Nico is a son of Hades. He appears in The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Son of Neptune, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades, The Blood of Olympus, The Hidden Oracle, The Tower of Nero and The Sun and the Star, of which he is the main protagonist.\n\nDespite biologically being ten years old when first introduced, he and his elder sister Bianca were born in the 1930s. After Zeus killed their mother Maria while trying to kill the children, Hades wiped their memories and placed them in the Lotus Hotel by the fury Alecto, a place in Las Vegas where time stands still for decades before he and Bianca were removed from the Lotus Hotel by Alecto, who brought them to the military academy Westover Hall.\n\nHe is native to Venice, Italy and can speak Italian (as his native language). Nico is initially depicted as cheerful and childlike, with olive skin and dark hair. He enjoyed playing Mythomagic, a mythology-themed card game similar to Magic: The Gathering. He takes the death of Bianca very hard, becoming moody, secretive, and irritable. He becomes angry at Percy, who swore to protect Bianca, but later forgives him. Afterward, he lived in the Underworld with Hades, where he becomes pale and shaggy-haired and begins wearing dark clothing. Nico, despite being very powerful, is extremely lonely, much like his father. He makes nearby people uncomfortable, partially due to his weapon of choice: a sword made of iron cooled in the river Styx (\"Stygian iron\"), capable of absorbing monsters' essences rather than banishing them to Tartarus. Stygian iron, unlike celestial bronze and Imperial gold, can harm both mortals and immortals.\n\nIn The Mark of Athena, he is captured by the giants Ephialtes and Otis to be used as bait before being rescued. In The House of Hades, Nico keeps a promise to Percy to guide the Seven to the mortal world side of the Doors of Death. Nico is outed as gay to Jason Grace by Cupid and is revealed to suffer from internalized homophobia due to growing up in the 1940s. After Cupid outs him, Nico admits his long-standing feelings for Percy to Jason. Although Jason offers Nico support, he is rebuffed. During Percy and Annabeth's time in Tartarus, they are helped by Bob the Titan who was convinced by Nico that Percy is a good friend. After Percy and Annabeth escape Tartarus thanks to the aid of both Bob and the Giant Damasen, Percy reunites with Nico and attempts to reconcile with him, but fails. During The Blood of Olympus, Nico, with the help of Reyna Avila Ramirez-Arellano and Gleeson Hedge, transport the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood. At the end of the novel, he fully reconciles with Percy and admits his feelings for him, although he notes that he no longer has those feelings anymore and the two depart as friends. During the events of Heroes of Olympus, he developed feelings for Will Solace, son of Apollo, who becomes his boyfriend between the events of The Blood of Olympus and The Hidden Oracle. As revealed in The Sun and the Star, Will developed an interest in Nico while Nico was helping him in the infirmary, and Nico in turn fell for Will when he helped Nico deal with his anger over the death and resurrection of Leo Valdez. Subsequently, an attempt by Nico to ask Will out during a private picnic turned into a camp-wide coming out party for Nico due to a misunderstanding. Deciding to come out rather than continue hiding, Nico publicly asked out Will, who accepted while none of Nico's worst-case scenarios surrounding coming out happened, giving him more confidence. Nico later realizes that his homophobia comes from a bad reaction that he got from a friend while he was eight in the 1940s.\n\nNico’s suggestion that Percy take on the curse of Achilles and his work to convince Hades to fight in The Last Olympian is crucial to the Olympians' success and earns him a short bout of fame. He is privy to the fact that there are two camps, one Greek and one Roman, before The Lost Hero, making him an important liaison between the two groups in the latter series. He brings his half-sister Hazel back from the dead and establishes her at Camp Jupiter. At the end of The Son of Neptune, Nico travels through Tartarus to find the monstrous side of the Doors of Death, an experience that leaves him haunted and weak. In The Blood of Olympus, he nearly dies several times while \"shadow-traveling\", which involves melting into shadows and teleporting himself to different places. His sister, Hazel Levesque, whom he brought back from the dead, is the daughter of Hades' Roman counterpart Pluto. In The Hidden Oracle, Will Solace introduces him as his boyfriend to Apollo. Although their attraction for each other is hinted at in The Blood of Olympus, they are not seen getting together. After the three-legged death race, he is seen assisting Will to treat the injured patients. At the end of the book, he helps Apollo and the others fight after his and Will's canoe capsized. In The Tower of Nero, he and Will help to fight Nero and Nico is shown to have become depressed following the death of Jason Grace. At the end of the book, Nico is convinced that his friend the Titan Iapetus or 'Bob' is calling for help from Tartarus despite his apparent death in The House of Hades. Nico decides to try to find out what happened to the friendly Titan with Will's help and rescue him if need be.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star, two months after The Tower of Nero, Rachel Elizabeth Dare gives Nico and Will the prophecy for their quest to Tartarus for the twelfth time, prompting Nico to convince a reluctant Chiron to give them an official quest. Nico and Will enlist the help of the troglodytes, or \"trogs\", whom Nico had relocated to the Underworld following the events of The Tower of Nero, to sneak into Tartarus without Hades' knowledge. Impressed by their success, Menoetes reveals that Bob has been captured by the primordial goddess of night Nyx who has been trying to force Bob to become Iapetus again. Nico finally reveals the story of his first trip into Tartarus and his encounter with Nyx, who grew interested in the young demigod due to his internal darkness. The trogs subsequently lead Nico and Will to the River Acheron, where the nymph Gorgyra agrees to help them in exchange for Nico and Will sharing their story with her. The demigods use Gorgyra's canoe to ride the Acheron into and through Tartarus, but the river's power forces them to confront their insecurities and differences of opinion, particularly Will's negative opinion of the Underworld which Nico sees as his second home. After finding Bob's pet saber-toothed cat Small Bob, the demigods finally locate the Titan in Nyx's home, the Mansion of Night, and free him from a continuous regeneration cycle by combining their powers of light and dark. Confronting the group, Nyx attempts to convince Nico to give into his darkness and to stay in Tartarus, revealing that she has created cacodemons out of that darkness. Fighting back against Nyx's manipulations, Nico gives the cacodemons their freedom, literally letting go of his demons in the process and convincing Nemesis, Hypnos and Epiales to help them escape, the cacodemons choosing to accompany them. While leaving the underworld, Bianca and Maria visit him in his dreams, urging him to enjoy his future with Will and find happiness. Returning to Camp Half-Blood, Bob departs to figure out his future while Nico decides to adopt the cacodemons, renaming them Cocoa Puffs.\n\nRachel Elizabeth Dare\n\nedit\n\nRachel is a mortal girl who can see through the Mist, the force that obscures gods and monsters from most mortals. Her father, Walter Dare, is a rich businessman, a fact which she is rather averse to. She first meets Percy in The Titan's Curse at the Hoover Dam. In The Battle of the Labyrinth, she guides Percy through the Labyrinth to Daedalus's workshop. It is hinted that she has some romantic feelings for Percy (which are noticed by Annabeth, who becomes extremely jealous). In The Last Olympian, she has strange visions about the war. Later, after she talked to Chiron, she decided to become the new Oracle of Delphi, according to her fate. She gave up her feelings for Percy to her duty. Her appearance makes things easier for both Olympians and Greek demigods.\n\nHer first act as the Oracle is to deliver the next Great Prophecy, setting the plot of the Heroes of Olympus series. She is contacted in The House of Hades to ask for Reyna's assistance to bring the Athena Parthenos back to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nFollowing the loss of Delphi to Python, as revealed in The Hidden Oracle, Rachel stops visiting camp and begins a frenzied attempt to regain her foresight, not helped by Apollo's disappearance. Once informed of Apollo's arrival, Rachel returns and learns that not only Delphi is lost, but also three other Oracles, and that only Rhea's Dodonian Oracle is still valid. She becomes upset upon learning of the existence of other Oracles, as Apollo hasn't told her before. In The Tower of Nero, Rachel regains her powers of foresight after Apollo kills Python and helps him battle Nero. She plans to take the summer off before returning to work as the Oracle full time. She also provides Nico and Will with a prophecy.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star, two months after regaining her powers, Rachel has been forced to repeat her prophecy for Nico and Will's quest twelve times until they actually leave on it. It's later revealed that Hades had sent Nico the prophecy through Rachel so that Nico would rescue Bob.\n\nShe has red hair and freckles, is skilled at painting and drawing, and occasionally shown as a non-ADHD foil for her demigod teammates. Percy remarks on her ability to stand still for a long time at a charity event. Due to her power of foresight, Rachel knows a great deal of knowledge before she learns it herself.\n\nClarisse La Rue\n\nedit\n\nClarisse is a daughter of Ares and the former lead counselor of the Ares cabin at Camp Half-Blood. She is hot-tempered, courageous, strong, an incredible fighter (usually using an electric spear given to her by Ares), and a good military strategist. She can be stubborn and overconfident, much like her father. Despite their similarities, Clarisse has a fear of her father and his anger at her if she should ever disappoint him. This, along with a strong sense of honor and pride, often motivates her actions. She also fears the Labyrinth because of what happened to her boyfriend Chris Rodriguez before she saved him. She is aggressive towards most demigods, including Percy, though she does respect and make friends with a few, including Percy, Annabeth, and Silena Beauregard.\n\nClarisse makes frequent appearances throughout the novels, first seen just after Percy arrives at camp. In The Sea of Monsters, Clarisse is given the quest to find the Golden Fleece. She is a main character in the short story \"Percy Jackson and the Stolen Chariot\" (published in The Demigod Files). In The Last Olympian, Clarisse initially sits out the war for Olympus due to a personal feud. Enraged after the loss of her friend Silena, she later joins the battle with a fury reminiscent of her father's, slaying a drakon singlehandedly and receiving the blessing of Ares. In The Blood of Olympus, Clarisse leads the Greeks in battle to defend the camp. In The Hidden Oracle, it is stated that Clarisse has gone to attend the University of Arizona and her role as counselor is taken by her half-brother Sherman Yang.\n\nShe appears in The Lightning Thief, The Sea of Monsters, The Battle of the Labyrinth, The Last Olympian, The Mark of Athena, The House of Hades and The Blood of Olympus.\n\nIn the film adaptations, she is portrayed by Leven Rambin. In the musical, she is portrayed by Sarah Beth Pfeifer. Dior Goodjohn portrays Clarisse in the TV series.[2]\n\nWill Solace\n\nedit\n\nWill Solace is a son of Apollo who is a native of Austin, Texas and the son of country singer Naomi Solace. While initially a recurring character in Percy Jackson and the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus, Will becomes a main character in The Trials of Apollo and The Sun and the Star. He is stated to be the camp's best combat medic and runs the infirmary. According to Will himself, he lacks the archery skills of the other children of Apollo due to his inherited gifts being for healing rather than combat. Nevertheless, he is extremely brave and, along with his healing abilities, can emit a painful ultrasonic whistle and can glow. Will later discovers the ability to project rays of light from his body as an attack, channel his light through Nico di Angelo's sword to strengthen it and, by channeling his own darkness, Will can tap into Apollo's plague powers to make his enemies sick. Will is bisexual as revealed in The Sun and the Star.\n\nAlthough unseen or at least unidentified, Will is present during the events of The Titan's Curse and The Battle of the Labyrinth as revealed in The Sun and the Star. As a result, he may be one of the unnamed Apollo campers mentioned during The Lightning Thief and The Sea of Monsters as well. Will reveals that, during the events of The Titan's Curse, he was training to be a field medic under his older brother Michael Yew and met Nico for the first time while treating his injuries after a training mishap.\n\nIn The Last Olympian, when Annabeth is hurt, Will uses his healing powers to help cure Annabeth. Following the death of his half-brother Michael Yew in the Battle of Manhattan, he becomes the head of the Apollo cabin.\n\nIn The Lost Hero, Will is assigned by Annabeth to show around recently arrived demigods Leo Valdez, Piper McLean and Jason Grace. Despite being properly introduced to Will, Leo refers to him as \"the archer dude.\" Will also complains about Annabeth wrecking the Apollo Cabin's flying chariot.\n\nIn The Blood of Olympus, Will attends a head counselor meeting discussing the situation with Romans where he laments that he lacks the combat skills of many of his siblings due to his gifts being for healing. However, Chiron reassures Will that he will nevertheless play an important role due to the inevitable need for healers. At one point, Will calms down Clarisse by touching her arm, which Nico, witnessing the meeting through a dream, notes is an incredibly rare thing, as Clarisse would normally attack anyone who ever dared tried to do such a thing. Will delivers Coach Hedge's baby boy Chuck and, despite not being a fighter, volunteers to join the team sent to scout out the Roman positions to get a break along with Lou Ellen and Cecil. Will is reunited with Nico and the two begin bickering over Nico's use of his powers, which Will can sense are having a negative effect on his health. Will also berates Nico for his plan to leave both camps after the war, stating that there are people who are or would like to be Nico's friends if he would only give them a chance. The team sabotages the Roman onagers and Will uses his ultrasonic whistle twice to help defeat attacking enemies. During the final battle with Gaea's forces, Will and Nico confront Octavian who, being a Roman descendant of Apollo, is a distant relative of Will's, although Nico notes that compared to Will, Octavian is watered-down and unhealthy looking, lacking anything that makes a child of Apollo special. Although Nico and Will both see that Octavian's robes are caught up in the firing rope of the onager, Nico convinces Will not to intervene, leading to Octavian inadvertently launching himself to his death when he fires the weapon at Gaea. In the battle's aftermath, Nico avoids Will, convinced that the son of Apollo will now see him as a monster and want nothing to do with him, Nico having shown signs of a possible attraction to Will while working together on the battlefield. To Nico's surprise, Will forcefully tracks him down and orders Nico to spend three days in the infirmary recovering, berating Nico for avoiding him in the process. Nico comes out to Percy and admits his former crush on him before joining Will.\n\nIn The Hidden Oracle, Nico and Will are shown to have started dating each other in the six months since the battle. When Will's now-mortal father Apollo arrives at camp, Will and Nico aid Apollo in his quest and in adjusting to being mortal. After the battle with Nero's forces, Will treats the worst of the camp's cases of hay fever caused by Apollo's plague arrow.\n\nIn The Tower of Nero, Nico has become depressed following the death of Jason Grace on top of all of his other losses while Will is supportive and concerned for his boyfriend. During the final battle with Nero, Nico and Will help Apollo alongside the troglodytes, with Will at one point suddenly arriving with Camp Half-Blood reinforcements, as Nero apparently has the upper hand. Following Nero's death, Will coordinates treating everyone's injuries and helps Apollo prepare for his final battle with Python. Two weeks later, Apollo, now a god once again, visits his son and his boyfriend, and the two reveal that Nico believes that a voice that he's been hearing calling for help from Tartarus is Bob. Will plans to join Nico on his mission into Tartarus to try to find out what happened to Bob and to rescue him if he can, enlisting the help of the troglodytes to get in and out. Rachel provides them with a prophecy.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star, two months after receiving their prophecy, Nico and Will are the last kids at camp after all of the other demigods, including the year-rounders, choose to leave to see the world or to be with their mortal families at the end of the summer. Rachel arrives to repeat her prophecy for what turns out to be the twelfth time and Nico convinces a reluctant Chiron to give him and Will an official quest to rescue Bob. The quest brings up the problems with Nico and Will's relationship, particularly due to the effects of the River Acheron on the two demigods. Will is shown to be uncomfortable with the Underworld in general which irks his boyfriend due to Nico seeing it as his second home, although Nico helps Will to get a new perspective on it. In addition, Will is weakened over time by being so far from his father's domain of the sun. While telling stories to Gorgyra in exchange for her help, Nico and Will reveal the story of their relationship, including the fact that it was Nico who made the first move in what was intended to be a private picnic with the help of Juniper and the dryads but was turned inadvertently into a public coming out party. Throughout the quest, Will learns how to use his powers more offensively, using his powers over light to emit rays from his body that kills Epiales and singes Nyx's wing. Will is also able to tap into Apollo's plague powers and give Nyx a case of hay fever. By channeling his light through Nico into his sword, Will is able to make the weapon more powerful. They succeed in rescuing Bob and his pet Small Bob from Tartarus and return to Camp Half-Blood.\n\nCalypso\n\nedit\n\nCalypso is the daughter of the Titan Atlas, who is imprisoned on the island of Ogygia for supporting her father during the first Titan war.[3] She first appears in The Battle of the Labyrinth, where she nurses Percy back to health. She falls in love with Percy and is heartbroken when he has to leave. Percy asks the gods to release her at the end of The Last Olympian,[4] but she is still residing there when Leo becomes trapped on Ogygia in The House of Hades, having been released from the curse of being forced to fall in love with all those to fall upon the island rather than the island itself. Leo and Calypso subsequently fall in love legitimately. After Leo escapes, he swears on the River Styx that he will return for Calypso. At the end of The Blood of Olympus, Leo gets back to Ogygia and frees Calypso using an astrolabe that Odysseus had built for that purpose, although he was unable to complete it without a crystal from the island that Calypso had given to Leo on his first visit.\n\nIn The Hidden Oracle, Calypso comes to Camp Half-Blood with Leo and reveals that, due to her choice to leave Ogygia, she has become a mortal. She accompanies Leo and Apollo in the latter's quest to find the Oracles and stop the Three Emperors from conquering North America. Despite this, the two secretly attempt to find a normalcy for their lives and later announce to Apollo that they are going to settle in Indianapolis, although they will continue to help him anyway they can. At the end of The Dark Prophecy, Calypso stays at the Waystation, while Leo goes to warn Camp Jupiter of an impending invasion and Apollo travels with Meg to search for the Erythraean Sybil. During The Dark Prophecy, Calypso regains her ability to use magic, although the goddess Britomartis suggests that she had simply lost control of her powers rather than losing them altogether. With training from Josephine, Calypso begins regaining control over her magic.\n\nAs a sorceress, Calypso can command wind spirits to do her bidding. She loses most of her control of them when she gives up her immortality; however, she is still capable of summoning them to a degree, though by consuming more power than usual. Also, due to spending a long time at Ogygia, she has mastered sewing and lock-picking, which she uses while finding the gryphons at Indianapolis Zoo. She is Leo's girlfriend as of The Blood of Olympus, The Hidden Oracle, The Dark Prophecy, and The Burning Maze. In The Tower of Nero, Leo reveals that Calypso is enjoying attending high school and is currently working as a counselor at a mortal band camp for kids. The two are currently in a fight due to Leo's disrespectful behavior towards women, but both Leo and Reyna are sure that they will work it out when she returns at the end of the summer.\n\nBob\n\nedit\n\nIapetus, also known as Bob the Titan, is the Lord of the West and the father of Atlas. Bob first appears as one of the main antagonists of the short story Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades which appears in The Demigod Diaries as well as the back of the paperback edition of The House of Hades. He subsequently appears as a main character and a supporting protagonist in The House of Hades and The Sun and the Star.\n\nIn Percy Jackson and the Sword of Hades, demigod Ethan Nakamura uses the sword of Hades to release Iapetus from where he has been locked in Tartarus for millennia. Iapetus battles Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Nico, and Thalia Grace, proving to be more than a match for them. In desperation, Percy throws Iapetus into the River Lethe which erases the Titan's memories, leaving him with a childlike personality. Percy convinces the amnesic Iapetus that he's actually their friend Bob and Bob heals Percy's injuries from the fight and aids him in confronting Persephone over her secret creation of the sword in the first place. Bob is subsequently employed as a janitor in the Underworld by Hades.\n\nIn The House of Hades while trapped in Tartarus, Percy and Annabeth briefly reminisce about Bob, inadvertently summoning him to their aid when the Titan overhears them. Percy is left feeling guilty after learning how Hades and Persephone used Bob as a servant while Nico would visit and tell the Titan about how good of a friend Percy is. Bob acts as a guide and protector to Percy and Annabeth, his knowledge of Tartarus from his time trapped there proving vital in their quest to reach the Doors of Death and escape. However, the regenerative effects of Tartarus on monsters starts to heal Bob's mind and slowly restore his memories, including the fact that Percy was the one who erased them in the first place. On one occasion, the group faces monsters who cast curses upon them that their previous enemies have left. Bob hesitates to help until Percy apologizes for his actions and for being a bad friend. Bob also befriends Small Bob, a sabertooth cat inadvertently created and then destroyed by Atlas in The Titan's Curse. Bob leads Percy and Annabeth to the friendly giant Damasen who heals the two demigods' injuries, but is convinced that he can't change his fate of forever battling the maeonian drakon despite Percy and Annabeth's belief that the line of the Prophecy of Seven about \"foes bare arms to the Doors of Death\" refers to the four of them: two demigods, a Titan and a Giant who should be mortal enemies under normal circumstances. Ultimately, despite the return of his memories, Bob takes Percy's advice to heart that he should take the parts of Iapetus' past that he wants while leaving everything else behind and continues to side with them, showing disgust for his evil past. At the Doors of Death, firmly identifying himself as Bob rather than Iapetus, he faces off against the embodiment of Tartarus alongside Small Bob, Damasen and the drakon, to ensure Percy and Annabeth's escape from the realm and the closing of the Doors of Death. The four are presumably destroyed in the process, devastating Nico, Percy and Annabeth who recognize Bob as a true friend. Percy sadly fulfils Bob's last request to say hello to the stars for him, Bob having wanted to see the stars again.\n\nIn The Tower of Nero, Nico begins hearing a voice calling out to him for help from Tartarus. Nico later reveals to Apollo that he believes that the voice is Bob, suggesting that the Titan had in fact survived his battle with Tartarus at the Doors of Death. Feeling guilty for leaving Bob behind, Nico is determined to travel into Tartarus and try to find out what happened to Bob and if possible, to rescue his friend. Nico and his boyfriend Will Solace explain that they intend to enlist the help of the troglodytes who are capable of safely tunneling into and out of anywhere, even Tartarus. However, Rachel issues them a prophecy that Will admits doesn't sound good.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star, he is rescued from Tartarus by Nico and Will. Having been killed fighting Tartarus, a reforming Bob was captured by Nyx who stuck the Titan in a permanent regeneration cycle. Nico and Will locate Bob's regeneration pod in the Mansion of Night and cut him out by combining their powers together. The reformed Bob joins the demigods in fighting against Nyx and her monster army before they make their escape. While the demigods rest, Bob sails them up the River Acheron, through the Underworld, out into Long Island Sound, and finally to the shores of Camp Half-Blood itself. In a dream, Hades reveals to Nico that he had sent his son the prophecy so that Nico would rescue Bob. Upon reaching Camp Half-Blood, Bob rejects an offer to stay and instead decides to head west with Small Bob.\n\nIntroduced in The Heroes of Olympus\n\nedit\n\nReyna Avila Ramírez-Arellano\n\nedit\n\nReyna Avila Ramírez-Arellano (also known by her initials RARA) is a 16-year-old Puerto Rican demigod. She is a daughter of Bellona, a Roman goddess of war, and the younger sister of Queen Hylla of the Amazons. She and her sister worked for Circe during the events of The Sea of Monsters where Reyna was one of the attendants who looked after Annabeth. After Percy and Annabeth escape and free Blackbeard and his crew, Reyna and Hylla were captured by the pirates before eventually escaping and going their separate ways.\n\nReyna found the way to Camp Jupiter, where she belonged. She became the praetor of the Twelfth Legion just four years after she joined. She would not trust anyone so easily, which was a good quality because she had a whole legion to lead. She did everything she could for her friends and family, which was everyone in New Rome. When she found out about the Greek demigods, Reyna chose not to pursue revenge against the Greeks, despite her difficult history with them. She understands the importance of both camps united.\n\nShe does not have a fatal flaw, unlike Annabeth. However, she could still not get everything she wanted. She could not find love, just like Venus had said. In the Tyrant's Tomb, she joined the Hunters. It is a sign of her overcoming fate, and living beyond other's expectations.\n\nShe is described as intimidating and a natural leader; she has glossy black hair and very dark brown eyes. Reyna is generally more used to responsibility than other demigods, as she is a praetor at Camp Jupiter.[5] Reyna's demigod ability is the power to lend her energy, skills, and character traits to nearby demigods. Similar to Leo Valdez, she can speak English, Latin and Spanish. Reyna is often accompanied by two magical dogs, Aurum and Argentum, or by her pegasus Scipio (\"Skippy\" dies after their trip from New York to Greece in The House of Hades after being slashed by a griffin's poisonous claw).[6] The immortal winged horse Pegasus awards her the title of \"Horse Friend\" because of her kindness towards Scipio and his descendants.\n\nIn The Blood of Olympus, she, Nico, and Coach Hedge go on a quest to return the Athena Parthenos to Camp Half-Blood. While shadow-travelling to New York, the trio stops in San Juan and visits Reyna's former house, haunted by the ghosts of her relatives. There Reyna reveals that the Ramírez-Arellano family (which includes Roberto Cofresi and Captain Marion Frederic Ramírez de Arellano) has always been favored by Bellona. Reyna's father (an Iraq War veteran) deeply loved the goddess, but his PTSD turned this love into an unhealthy paranoia. When Reyna was ten years old, he became a mania, or an evil insane ghost. When the mania attacked Hylla, young Reyna picked up the closest weapon and killed what remained of her father. Reyna is reluctant to discuss the incident because patricide is \"unforgivable\" in New Rome.[7] Reyna was in love with Jason Grace, which is shown throughout the series. Several characters like Percy, Annabeth, Piper, and Hazel have noticed Reyna's romantic feelings for Jason. In The Mark of Athena, Annabeth noticed that Reyna had a hungry sort of gleam in her eyes when she reunited with Jason Grace. Eventually, Annabeth sensed that Reyna wanted Jason to love her back. In The House of Hades, Jason felt guilty for letting her believe they had a future together. In The Blood of Olympus, she daydreams about romantic activities with Jason like \"romantic walks\" and \"sunset picnics\". When Jason had disappeared for 6–8 months, she briefly considered Percy a romantic partner.\n\nIn The Tyrant's Tomb, Reyna is revealed to be asexual and has always felt pressured to take a romantic partner, but didn't understand why she never truly felt an attachment to anyone until Apollo hits on her. Following the Battle of San Francisco Bay, Reyna resigns as praetor and instead joins the Hunters of Artemis. In The Tower of Nero, after becoming a god once again, Apollo encounters Reyna who is settling in well with the Hunters and has been mentoring Leo Valdez in his behavior towards Calypso.\n\nLeonidas \"Leo\" Valdez\n\nedit\n\nLeonidas \"Leo\" Valdez is a son of Hephaestus. He likes to joke around and relies on his sense of humor to bury the pain he feels as a result of his troubled past. He is described as having curly brown hair, brown eyes, a cheerful face, a slim and scrawny build, dark skin, and a mischievous smile. He is Hispanic-American and speaks Spanish. Leo has the ability to create and manipulate fire, a skill that no child of Hephaestus has had for 400 years. He also has severe ADHD, even by demigod standards. He is an excellent mechanic and at one point repairs a bronze dragon running wild in the camp's woods, which he names Festus (Latin for \"happy\"). Inspired by a blueprint in Bunker 9, an abandoned bunker in the camp's woods, and a picture he drew in his kindergarten time, he also creates the Argo II, the flying ship the seven demigods of the Great Prophecy sail on to reach Greece.\n\nWhen Leo was eight, Gaia tricked him into burning down his mother Esperanza's machine shop in Houston, resulting in her death. Leo's remaining family blamed him for killing her and left him a foster child and runaway. He meets Piper McLean at the Wilderness School in Nevada. Later, in The Lost Hero, he meets Jason Grace, who wakes up on a school bus headed to the Grand Canyon with no memories. However, Leo and Piper have Mist-induced memories of meeting and becoming friends with Jason. He sometimes thinks of himself as a seventh wheel, as for the first three books of the Heroes of Olympus series, he is the only person aboard the Argo II without a significant other, though he proves no less important or skilled than the others. In The Mark of Athena, Hazel learns her former boyfriend, Sammy Valdez, was Leo's great-grandfather. Until he falls in love with Calypso, a nymph third-generation titanness, in The House of Hades, Leo flirts with almost every girl he meets to cover up his insecurities about never finding love. In The Blood of Olympus, Leo sacrifices himself to annihilate Gaia and dies in the process, but is brought back to life using the Physician's Cure and returns for Calypso on her island, Ogygia. This is an impressive feat, as nobody has ever been to Ogygia twice. However, Leo had the advantage of an astrolabe that had been created for just such a purpose by Odysseus as an old man. Leo had gotten the device from two dwarfs shortly before landing on Ogygia and had learned from them that Odysseus had lacked a vital crystal to complete the device which Leo had convinced Calypso to give him before leaving the island.\n\nHe and Calypso then journey back to Camp Half-Blood, sending a magic scroll ahead to let his friends know he's alive. When he does arrive at camp (at the end of The Hidden Oracle), everyone lines up to punch him for keeping them worried for so long. As Leo is included in the prophecy of the Grove of Dodona, he and Calypso accept the task to accompany Apollo on his quests in The Dark Prophecy. Afterward, he announces that he and Calypso will be living at the Waystation and leading an ordinary life. When the prophecy of Trophonius requires that someone must warn Camp Jupiter of an invasion, Leo does the task alone. He returns, but later learns of Jason's death. In The Tower of Nero, Apollo encounters Leo briefly while visiting the Waystation after becoming a god once again.\n\nFestus\n\nedit\n\nFestus is a mechanical dragon made decades ago by the Hephaestus cabin at Camp Half-Blood, and given wings by Leo Valdez years later. He was first encountered in The Bronze Dragon where Festus goes on a rampage before being shut down by Percy, Annabeth and Charles Beckendorf who intends to reprogram Festus to help defend the camp.\n\nIn The Lost Hero, Festus has gone out of control ever since Beckendorf's death, but Leo's immunity to fire allows him to corral and tame the bronze dragon. Festus transports Jason, Piper, and Leo, before being destroyed by a crash-landing at King Midas' mansion. Leo asks Hephaestus to take his head to Bunker Nine at Camp Half-Blood, where he later repairs him to be the figurehead on the Argo II. Festus acts in this role throughout The Mark of Athena and The House of Hades, acting as the ship's control interface and occasionally helping to defend against attacks. After Piper uses charmspeak on him, Festus is stated to be constantly active, and he is described as being more alive than ever. Although Festus was initially damaged beyond any hope of repair due to his control disk being destroyed in the crash landing, Leo is able to build him a new control disk using the works of Archimedes that he had recovered in The Mark of Athena.\n\nIn The Blood of Olympus, Festus is secretly rebuilt by Leo and plays a vital role in the defeat of Gaea, lifting the primordial goddess high in the air where she's weaker and holding Jason and Piper steady as Piper charms the goddess to sleep. After Gaea's defeat, Festus resurrects Leo with the Physician's Cure and helps him to rescue Calypso using a mariner's astrolabe created by Odysseus.\n\nIn The Trials of Apollo, Festus acts as one of Apollo's allies. In The Hidden Oracle, after traveling the world with Leo and Calypso for six months, Festus finally returns them to Camp Half-Blood with the help of a homing beacon created by Leo's little brother Harley. He is destroyed again in The Dark Prophecy by Commodus while defending the Waystation, but is easily rebuilt by Leo who had redesigned Festus in case of such an eventuality. In The Burning Maze, Festus transports Leo to Camp Jupiter to warn them of an upcoming attack and is mentioned to have helped to defend the camp. He later brings Leo to see Apollo, Meg and Piper in the aftermath of the events in the Labyrinth. In The Tower of Nero, Leo mentions that he's using Festus as his workshop while Leo teaches homeless kids shop skills. Although most of the kids only see Festus as a large vehicle, a few can see through the Mist and see Festus in his true form.\n\nPiper McLean\n\nedit\n\nPiper McLean is a daughter of Aphrodite and the famous actor, Tristan McLean. She is fifteen in The Lost Hero. Unlike most children of Aphrodite, Piper is not particularly concerned with beauty or fashion. Piper is Cherokee on her father's side. She has tan skin, eyes that change color constantly, and choppy chocolate-colored hair which she cuts herself. Her demigod powers include \"charmspeak\" (essentially, magical persuasion) and the ability to speak French, as it is \"the language of love\". She is also occasionally able to see visions in her magic dagger Katoptris (Ancient Greek for \"mirror\"), which once belonged to Helen of Troy. The dagger lost that power after the battle against the giants in Athens.\n\nPiper's relationship with her father is mutually affectionate but strained, in part because of the small amount of attention he spares for her. When she was young, Piper used her persuasive skills to \"borrow\" (ask for in charmspeak) things to earn a little of his time. After he is kidnapped by the giant Enceladus in The Lost Hero and subsequently rescued by Piper, Jason, and Leo, Mr. McLean's relationship with his daughter begins to improve. Piper is also very close to Jason. Though she later learns it was all a trick of the Mist, she believed she was once his girlfriend while they attended the same school. She works hard to recreate this relationship in real life when she comes to Camp Half-Blood. She is also friends with all of the seven quest members in The Heroes of Olympus, especially Annabeth, Leo and Percy.\n\nPiper's main weapon is her dagger Katoptris, though she later acquires a magic cornucopia and uses it as a weapon. After being captured by pirates in The House of Hades, Piper asks Hazel to teach her sword fighting, using a jagged celestial bronze sword taken from the Boread Zethes.\n\nIn The Hidden Oracle, Nico mentions that Piper is currently attending school in Los Angeles, together with Jason. In The Burning Maze, it is revealed that her relationship with Jason ended a few months earlier. Apollo, as Lester Papadopoulos, is confused because the cloud nymph, Mellie, had seemed angry at Jason, leading Apollo to mistakenly believe that Jason had broken up with Piper, while in fact, Piper had ended the relationship because she felt it was forced. It is later unveiled that she wanted to discover herself and who she really was without the pressure of being the daughter of Aphrodite. The trick of the Mist that Hera used at the beginning of their relationship also contributed to the breakup as that meant that their relationship was technically \"fake\". Still, she is heartbroken when he sacrifices himself in The Burning Maze. In The Tower of Nero, because he was still one of her best friends who she could confide in. Later, she is revealed to be in a relationship with a mortal woman named Shel.\n\nIn The Sun and the Star, after returning from Tartarus, Nico contacts Piper who is still with Shel. The two discuss their grief over the loss of Jason and promise to be closer friends in the future. Piper reveals that she is truly happy with Shel, although she is still figuring herself out which Nico gives her advice on. Piper also admits that she had truly loved Jason.\n\nJason Grace\n\nedit\n\nJason Grace was a son of Jupiter and the mortal Beryl Grace, and the younger brother of Thalia Grace (Hunter of Artemis). He was raised by the wolf goddess Lupa and her pack after his mother was compelled to give him up when he was two, then later lived at Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Half-Blood. Jason inherited many special powers from his father Jupiter like summoning lightning bolts, controlling winds, flying, summoning storm spirits, and creating different types of storms like thunderstorms, rainstorms, and hurricanes. Jason is also a master swordsman and spear user. He and Thalia are reunited in The Lost Hero, and Thalia later reveals that their mother told her that Jason was dead, and that this was what finally drove her to leave home. Also in The Lost Hero, he begins a romantic relationship with Piper McLean. In The Blood of Olympus, it is revealed that Beryl Grace had become a mania, or spirit of madness.\n\nJason is often described to be very handsome and attractive. He had blond hair, electric blue eyes, and a scar above his upper lip, which is said to be from his attempt to eat a stapler at age two. By the age of fifteen, he had earned the rank of praetor and led the legion with his longtime partner, Reyna who eventually falls in love with him. Jason also coordinated the Roman camp's attack on the Titan force prior to the events of The Lost Hero: he led an assault against Mount Tamalpais/Othrys, a Titan stronghold near San Francisco, and defeated the Titan Krios in combat by himself. Piper McLean describes Jason as a very rule- and duty-oriented person, though Terminus describes him as a \"rule-flouter”. Of all the characters in the series, Jason is the one who struggles the most with the differences between the Greek and Roman perspectives. When the Argo II is stuck in North Africa, he must choose one identity or the other; he decides to consider himself a Greek, despite his parentage, and is subsequently unable to command a legion of Roman ghosts. During The House of Hades, it is revealed that Jason has plans to return to Camp Jupiter to improve it with things he learned at Camp Half-Blood, such as giving the fauns (the Roman equivalent of a satyr) more rights and responsibilities. Later, during The Blood of Olympus, Jason decides to consider both the Greek and Roman traditions as part of his heritage. He becomes the Pontifex Maximus, a role which sees him travel between Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter to build shrines for every god and goddess in the pantheon.\n\nJason is killed with arrows during The Burning Maze by the Roman Emperor Caligula after sacrificing himself to save Piper, Apollo, and Meg. His death is avenged by Frank Zhang in The Tyrant's Tomb with Frank telling Caligula that it's for Jason. Jason is given a state funeral in New Rome overseen by Apollo. In The Tower of Nero, Nico senses that Jason has likely moved on to either Elysium or been reborn.\n\nHazel Levesque\n\nedit\n\nHazel Levesque is a fourteen-year-old demigod, a daughter of Pluto and Marie Levesque. She first appears in The Son of Neptune, at Camp Jupiter. It is later revealed that she has returned from the dead, assisted by her half-brother Nico. She grew up in the 1940s in New Orleans, where her mother had a gris-gris shop. When she was born, Pluto offered to grant her mother a wish, but her request for wealth backfired into an ability to control precious metals and gems, which both first view as a curse. Hazel died after Gaea tries to use Hazel's power over earth to resurrect Alcyoneus. When Hazel's mother changes her mind about helping Gaea, Hazel buries herself and her mother under the earth, delaying Alcyoneus's rebirth and killing them both. While Hazel's spirit is being judged, she gives up the chance to go to Elysium to save her mother from punishment, and they are both sent to the Fields of Asphodel instead. At some point before The Lost Hero, Nico finds Hazel in the Underworld while trying to visit Bianca, only to find she has tried for rebirth. With the Doors of Death open, Nico is able to take Hazel to the world of the living through them, resurrecting her and then delivers Hazel to Camp Jupiter. Hazel and Nico are protective of each other, much as true half-siblings.\n\nHazel is described as African American, having cocoa-colored skin, curly cinnamon-brown hair, and golden eyes. Her legion tattoo is described as looking like a cross with curved arms and a head. She eventually learns to manipulate her curse, manipulating precious stones and metals and sensing structures underground. She is an accomplished horse-rider and skilled with a spatha. She tames the horse Arion, who eats precious metals. She is unusually knowledgeable about the Underworld because of her time there. During The House of Hades the goddess Hecate insists Hazel learn to manipulate the Mist. Hazel becomes very gifted at this. After the Second Gigantomachy, Hazel is promoted to the rank of centurion of the Fifth Cohort, succeeding her boyfriend Frank Zhang. During The Tyrant's Tomb, Hazel reveals that she has managed to break her curse with Frank, which is confirmed in The Tower of Nero. This confirms something that Juno had once told Hazel: that a descendant of Poseidon would some day wash away her curse. She is now able to summon precious metals and use and spend them without terrible consequences. In The Tyrant's Tomb, she and Frank team up with Apollo and Meg McCaffrey to protect Camp Jupiter from the emperors Commodus and Caligula as well as the undead king Tarquin. In The Tower of Nero, she and Frank are stated to be the best praetors that Camp Jupiter has ever had.\n\nFrank Zhang\n\nedit\n\nFrank Zhang, born Fai Zhang (Frank's Chinese name), is a 16-year-old demigod, son of Mars (Ares) and Emily Zhang, a Chinese-Canadian \"legacy\" (descendant of a demigod) who died during military service in Afghanistan. He is taken care of by his grandmother after his mother's death, and makes his way to Camp Jupiter upon her insistence. Frank's family descends from Periclymenus, a grandson of Poseidon, who had the power to shapeshift. Periclymenus's descendants were sold into slavery in China, and migrated to Canada many years later. While battling Alcyoneus (who is invincible within Alaska), Frank taps into his ancestral power and transforms into a bear. However, his combined power of being a son of Mars and having the ability to shapeshift makes his life very fragile. The Fates tied his life force to a piece of firewood when he was a baby, so if the wood burns up, he will die (as in the ancient Greek legend of Meleager). The goddess Juno appears to his mother and grandmother while he is a baby to warn them of this fact, as he would be crucial to defeating the Giants. In all of his life, Frank has ignited the wood twice, which he can do simply by thinking about it; the first time is while he is finding his way to Camp Jupiter, in bitter cold. The second time is when he, Percy, and Hazel travel to Alaska to free Thanatos. Eventually, Frank entrusts the firewood to Hazel, and in The House of Hades, Leo creates a fireproof pouch to contain it.\n\nFrank has a meek disposition and is uncomfortable upon learning his father's identity publicly in front of the whole of Camp Jupiter. He suspected himself a son of Apollo, given his skill with a bow and arrow. On his quest in The Son of Neptune, and later during the series as well, he uses an enchanted spear given to him by Mars. The spear summons a skeleton warrior, which Frank calls \"Gray\".\n\nAs he has been residing in Camp Jupiter for no more than a year, Frank is initially considered a probatio, or rookie, of the Fifth Cohort. During the Roman War Games, after Percy impresses everyone with his battle skills and instincts, Mars appears, informing Frank that he is his son and is to lead a quest. Since only centurions are allowed to lead a quest, Reyna has to promote him to centurion rank. Later, in The House of Hades, Jason surrenders his praetorship to Frank, who uses its authority and Diocletian's Sceptre to lead an army of Roman skeleton soldiers against the monsters in the Necromanteion.\n\nFrank was described as 'cuddly' and 'fuzzy' and with a chubby, babyish face in The Mark of Athena, but in The House of Hades, after summoning the blessing of Mars to defeat a hoard of enemies, he transforms. He is then described as being taller, more muscular, and without all of his childhood fat. Though now built like a professional football player, he is still as sensitive as before, and is embarrassed at his new appearance at first.\n\nInitially, Frank is wary of the tension between Hazel and Leo (caused by Leo's resemblance to Hazel's old boyfriend, Sammy Valdez). After Leo's encounter with Calypso, however, Leo becomes more relaxed around Hazel and their relationship becomes clearly platonic, much to Frank's relief. Frank then pursues a relationship with Hazel.\n\nFrank burns his stick for the final time in The Tyrant's Tomb to kill Caligula. Despite the stick completely burning, Frank survives, freeing him from his curse. Apollo believes that by taking his fate into his own hands in such a noble way, Frank has created a new fate for himself free of his curse. Apollo compares Frank's fate to Meleager, noting that Meleager's family had hidden his curse from him and his mother was eventually forced to use the firewood to kill him while Frank's family revealed the truth and it helped to shape who Frank became. It's also revealed that his romantic relationship with Hazel has enabled her to break her curse, fulfilling a prophecy that she had received that a descendant of Poseidon would wash away her curse.\n\nIn The Tower of Nero, Frank and Hazel are revealed to have become the most efficient praetors the Twelfth Legion has ever had and have been building up New Rome.\n\nCoach Gleeson Hedge\n\nedit\n\nGleeson Hedge is a satyr first mentioned in The Last Olympian, as the author of a distress call sent to Grover Underwood. Like Grover, Hedge is also a demigod Protector, his proudest \"recruit\" being Clarisse La Rue. He disguises himself as a coach at the Wilderness School to escort Piper McLean and Leo Valdez (and later, Jason Grace) to Camp Half-Blood. He also serves as the adult chaperone for the Argo II and later accompanies the Athena Parthenos to camp. Despite his often warlike and often overly aggressive attitude, Hedge is kind and understanding to campers in need. He enjoys extreme sports and martial arts movies. In The Lost Hero, Hedge falls in love with cloud nymph Mellie (assistant to Aeolus) and marries her; by the time of The House of Hades, Mellie is pregnant with a satyr boy. Chuck, the baby, is born at the end of The Blood of Olympus, with Clarisse as his godmother. In The Hidden Oracle, Hedge, Mellie, Chuck, Piper, and Jason are spending the winter in Los Angeles.\n\nIntroduced in The Trials of Apollo\n\nedit\n\nApollo / Lester Papadopoulos\n\nedit\n\nApollo, in the mortal form of Lester Papadopoulos, serves as the main protagonist of The Trials of Apollo series.\n\nIn The Heroes of Olympus, Apollo's Roman descendant Octavian promises the god many things for blessing his prophetic skills, which leads to the Olympians' distraction from the true threat of Gaia, and to the resurgence of Python. As a result, the Delphic Oracle ceases to function, effectively halting demigod quests, and Zeus punishes Apollo. Zeus's punishment consists of making Apollo mortal, though he retains most of his personality and some more minor powers. This punishment is revealed in The Trials of Apollo. In his mortal form, Apollo's name is Lester Papadopoulos. Apollo has to adjust to a life of mortality and questing to regain his former powers and lifestyle.\n\nFollowing a meeting with two thugs in Manhattan, Apollo encounters a demigod called Meg McCaffrey, who claims him as her servant until he regains his godhood. Apollo is released by Meg after the revelation of her alliance with his enemy. His quest to become a god again is to liberate the oracles and face down his demons and the brutal mistakes he's made. Apollo is a truly flawed yet humorous character with a deeper capacity for growth and love than even his blameful, punishing father Zeus realizes.\n\nAs Lester, Apollo is a 16-year-old teenager with curly brown hair, blue eyes, acne, and a \"flabby\" torso. He is narcissistic, prideful, and arrogant. His mortal transformation makes him empathize with mortals and reaches a higher understanding of the worth of life, the meaning of death, and what it means to be alive. In particular, he grows to care for Meg deeply and resolves to be there for her despite the difficulties involved.[8] After killing Python in The Tower of Nero, Apollo is reinstated as a god but is changed for the better by his time as a mortal, having grown up and established real relationships with his children and others. He doesn't define himself sexually but has been in relationships with both females and males.\n\nMeg McCaffrey\n\nedit\n\nMargaret (Meg) McCaffrey is a 12-year-demigod daughter of Demeter and the main character in The Hidden Oracle. Her father was murdered by \"the Beast\" (Emperor Nero) and she was subsequently adopted by Nero, gaslighted into personifying Nero's evil actions as separate from him. Nero taught her the arts of a demigod and gave her a pair of crescent rings which can transform into sickles made of imperial gold, before giving her a task to lure Apollo into the Grove of Dodona. Meg appears to Apollo in an alley of Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan where she defeats two thugs, who were sent by Nero to stage a robbery. Meg demands Apollo's servitude and they travel to Camp Half-Blood with Percy Jackson's assistance. There, Meg displays unusual abilities even before Demeter claims her, and later goes with Apollo to search for missing demigods and the Grove in the nearby woods, having to endure a brief abduction in the process. Her relationship with Nero is revealed at the climax, but her growing doubtfulness regarding Nero's ways, not to mention her already familiar friendship with Apollo, leads her to rob Nero of his chance of burning the Grove. While she helps Apollo bring the Grove alive, she severs their bonding spell and leaves.\n\nIn the second book, The Dark Prophecy, she returns to Apollo and helps him fight Commodus.\n\nMeg is described as small and pudgy, with dark hair chopped in a messy pageboy style and black cat-eye glasses with rhinestones in the corners. She is free-spirited and adventurous, inquisitive, and is also confrontational. She poses questions with no subtlety, something that Apollo is annoyed with but later comes to regard as a unique trait. Her abilities as Demeter's daughter allows her to connect better with nature as well as summoning a karpos (crop spirit) called Peaches, a power that none of Demeter's other demigod children are known to possess.[8]\n\nEven though she is Demeter's daughter, not Ceres (the Roman manifestation of Demeter) she fights like a Roman, with two swords; one for offense and one for defense. She is also known for her liking of unicorns in the fourth book The Tyrant's Tomb.\n\nHemithea\n\nedit\n\nHemithea, known as \"Emmie\", is a retired Hunter of Artemis and caretaker of the Waystation. She lives with her partner, Josephine, also an ex-Hunter, and their daughter Georgia at the Waystation in Indianapolis. She and her sister were granted immortality by Apollo after escaping from the wrath of their father, King Staphylus. She then joined the Hunters of Artemis and fell in love with fellow hunter Josephine, so sometime in the 1980s, Josephine and Emmie gave up their immortality to grow old together. In The Dark Prophecy, she saves Calypso, Leo and Apollo from the Blemmyae with crossbow turrets and lets them stay at the Waystation. She comments on the similarities between Calypso and her half-sister Zoë Nightshade.\n\nTriumvirate Holdings\n\nedit\n\nTriumvirate Holdings is a company that is led by three beings who are said to be the worst Roman Emperors in history. They force other people to worship them. During the Second Titanomachy, Triumvirate Holdings was responsible for giving Luke (at the time under the influence of Kronos) and his allies the Princess Andromeda, weapons, helicopters, and top human mercenaries. During the Second Gigantomachy, Triumvirate Holdings supplied Octavian with different weapons. Rachel described Triumvirate Holdings to be so rich that they make her father's company \"look like a kid's lemonade stand\". The trio have divided up North America into three major empires and are hunting for Oracles, which they plan to destroy.\n\nAmong the known members of Triumvirate Holdings are:\n\nEmperor Nero – A legacy of Apollo who is the main antagonist of The Hidden Oracle and one of the two main antagonists of The Tower of Nero alongside Python. The last in the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Nero is infamous for his tyranny and overindulgence in wealth and luxury with little regard to his subjects. He is the deified Roman Emperor, who has survived through the millennia along with two other deified Roman emperors—the Triumvirate. He forms an alliance with Python, who holds Delphi, while he himself controls the other oracles and plans to destroy Dodona. As the Emperor of the East, Nero lives in New York City, where he recruits and trains homeless demigods, and controls the eastern third of North America. He and the other two Roman Emperors have established Triumvirate Holdings. As \"the Beast\", Nero killed Meg's father, but later adopted and trained her in demigod arts so she could eventually lure Apollo into the Grove of Dodona. After Rhea restores the Grove of Dodona at Camp Half-Blood, Nero tries to force Apollo and Meg to burn the trees; failing at that, he sends a giant statue of himself, the Colossus Neronis, which originally stood in Rome, against Camp Half-Blood and Apollo and the Greek demigods defend the camp against it.[8] He is killed by Apollo in The Tower of Nero and his power absorbed by Python.\n\nEmperor Commodus - Commodus is the main antagonist of The Dark Prophecy and one of the three main antagonists in The Tyrant's Tomb alongside Caligula and Tarquin. The last in the Nerva-Antonine dynasty, Commodus ascended as emperor at a young age and was known for his good looks and musculature, for which he was nicknamed the \"New Hercules\". In later life, he became increasingly dictatorial and paranoid as he suspected that people would overthrow him. He also had preferences for gladiatorial battles and would buy slaves and exotic animals to fight to the death. Eventually, Apollo, with whom he had an affair, assassinated him while taking the form of Narcissus, his wrestling partner. As a god, he reigned as the Emperor of the Middle, ruling from a base at Indianapolis. He sends many of his men, including a kidnapped Georgina, to seek the Oracle of Trophonius, as he himself fears the oracle's reputed ability to drive its seekers insane. At the end of The Dark Prophecy, he launches an attack at the Waystation, but is defeated by Apollo and his group. He manages to get away at the last second, having been blinded by Apollo's brief revelation of his true form. Later, Commodus joins forces with Caligula and Tarquin to destroy Camp Jupiter but ends up being killed by Apollo.\n\nEmperor Caligula - The main antagonist of The Burning Maze and one of the three main antagonists in The Tyrant's Tomb alongside Commodus and Tarquin. He was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Caligula was ambushed by his Germani guards which led to his mortal death. Following this incident, he employed the Strix and the Pandai to work for him while his fellow emperors continue to use Germani. Many years later, Apollo and Piper were brought to Caligula by his talking horse Incitatus as Caligula has the Pandai they subdued executed. Before he can have Meg and Jason Grace executed, Caligula is stunned when Apollo threatens to commit suicide. After Apollo stabs himself while Caligula kills Crest following the news of the attack on Camp Jupiter ending in failure, Caligula sails north with his guards. Medea meets with Caligula and advises that performs a ritual before Apollo dies. Caligula later fights Jason and Tempest on the back of Incitatus where he manages to kill Jason. After making sure that he is dead, Caligula sets sail for the Bay Area. Later, Caligula joins forces with Commodus and Tarquin to destroy Camp Jupiter but ends up being killed by Frank who apparently sacrifices himself to destroy the emperor by burning up his firewood representing Frank's lifeline. To much surprise, Frank survives the experience and is left with his life no longer tied to the wood.\n\nKing Tarquin - One of the three main antagonists in The Tyrant's Tomb alongside Commodus and Caligula. Tarquin is the last king of Rome and is depicted as a zombie. He participated in the Battle of San Francisco Bay where he targeted the Sibylline Books. Tarquin was killed by Hazel and Diana who stabbed him in the chest and shot him in the head with an arrow respectively.\n\nGreek-Roman deities\n\nedit\n\nThe Olympians\n\nedit\n\nThough not all the gods who appear in Rick Riordan's novels are truly Olympians (that is, gods who live on Mount Olympus), all Greek and Roman gods are generally considered to be a subset of the Olympians. As such, most characters in the series refer to these immortals generally as the \"Olympian gods\", to distinguish them from the Greco-Roman primordial gods and Titans.\n\nZeus/Jupiter – The king of the gods and the most powerful Olympian by far, Zeus is most prominent in The Lightning Thief[9] but has several roles throughout the rest of Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Zeus is shown prominently throughout the series to be extremely narcissistic, paranoid and hypocritical. In The Lost Hero, under the influence of Khione, Zeus forbids contact between gods and mortals and closes off Olympus (against the influence of Khione), although he indirectly helps the protagonists several times on their quests.[5] As the primary Olympian god, his demigod children reside in Camp Half-Blood's biggest cabin, Cabin 1, although there is only one person who resides there at the end of The Heroes of Olympus: Jason. In the film adaptation, Zeus is portrayed by Sean Bean. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Lance Reddick in season one as one of his final roles before his untimely death.\n\nHera/Juno – The queen of the gods who plays a role in The Titan's Curse,[10] by helping Percy and the others on their quest in The Battle of the Labyrinth.[3] As Juno in The Lost Hero, she is kidnapped by Gaea, and contacts Jason Grace to rescue her. Previously as Juno, she had sneaked out of Olympus and switched Percy and Jason to try to unite the Roman and Greek demigods, going against the wishes of Zeus as part of a plan to defeat Gaea.[5] Her cabin in Camp Half-Blood is Cabin 2, the second biggest in the camp. Because she does not have demigod children, it is empty. In the film adaptation, Hera is portrayed by Erica Cerra.\n\nPoseidon/Neptune – The god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses who is the brother of Zeus and Hades. In The Lightning Thief, he is suspected of having stolen Zeus's master bolt with Percy's help which nearly started a war between Zeus and Poseidon. Percy is proven innocent after Percy recovers it from Ares.[9] Poseidon fights Oceanus in the underwater front of the Titan war. He remains there in The Last Olympian while the other Olympians fight Typhon, until Percy convinces him that his power is necessary to defeat Typhon. He was last seen fighting the Giants in the Second Gigantomachy alongside Percy and the other gods and demigods and mentioned Kymopoleia to the other gods as his daughter after Percy and Jason reported meeting her.[7] Though he is referred to as Neptune in the sequels of Percy Jackson and the Olympians when the Greeks and Romans are united, he has yet to appear in Roman form. His cabin in Camp Half-Blood is Cabin 3 in which Percy is the sole permanent occupant.In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, Poseidon is portrayed by Kevin McKidd. In the musical, he is portrayed by Jonathan Raviv. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Toby Stephens. He is first seen in a flashback talking to Sally where he advised her not to take him to Camp Half-Blood yet. Poseidon shows up in person to prevent Zeus from striking Percy by \"surrendering\".\n\nHades/Pluto – The god of the Underworld and brother of Zeus and Poseidon. He is an isolationist who distances himself constantly from other gods because they do the same to him, primarily out of fear.[11] They continuously underestimate Hades who is in fact a very honorable and fatherly individual. He is the father of Nico, Bianca, and Hazel Levesque (as Pluto). Hades was the one who teleported Sally Jackson to the Underworld during the Minotaur's attack on her and Percy. Percy, Annabeth, and Grover assumed that he was the culprit behind the Master Lightning Bolt's theft only to find out that he wasn't and that his Helm of Darkness was also stolen. After Percy defeated Ares, he gave the Helm of Darkness to the Furies for them to return to Hades. He returned Sally to the living afterwards. After the Second Titanomachy, Hades is granted Cabin 13 which is populated by his demigod child Nico and is given a throne on Mount Olympus. In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, Hades is portrayed by Steve Coogan and is depicted as having a fiery winged demon form. In the TV series, Hades is portrayed by Jay Duplass.\n\nDemeter/Ceres – The goddess of agriculture. She appears alongside her daughter Persephone in The Last Olympian, where they participate in the battle against the Titans.[4] Demeter's cabin in Camp Half-Blood is Cabin 4. In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, Demeter is portrayed by Stefanie von Pfetten.\n\nAres/Mars – The god of war who is the son of Zeus and Hera and the father of Deimos, Phobos, Eros, Clarisse La Rue, and Frank Zhang. Ares is a callous bully who is driven by either greed, aggression, violence or by the promise of violence. However, as Mars, he dislikes war without reason and is one of the more important Roman Gods. He is however still a bully and is all for killing the Greeks. Percy first encounters Ares in The Lightning Thief, in which he drives a black Harley-Davidson motorcycle with flame decals and a leather seat made from human skin. Percy defeats Ares in a sword fight near the climax of the book. Before fleeing in his divine form, Ares curses Riptide to fail Percy when he needs it the most. Cabin 5 in Camp Half-Blood is the home of Ares' demigod children; it is said to be surrounded by all kinds of warfare apparatus, including spikes.[9] In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, Ares is portrayed by Ray Winstone. In the musical, he is portrayed by James Hayden Rodriguez. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Adam Copeland. Unlike the book series, Ares doesn't curse Riptide and states that Percy has made an enemy for life.\n\nAthena/Minerva – The goddess of wisdom, and the daughter of Zeus and Metis. Athena first appears in The Titan's Curse, where she dislikes Percy and his relationship with her daughter, and votes to execute Percy due to his crucial role in the fate of Olympus. She then argues that it was the most logical and wise choice. As Minerva, she is a scatterbrain and lost. She hates the Romans for reducing her to that and tells her descendants to kill the Romans. She also leads her best children to the Athena Parthenos, although Aphrodite believes it to be subconscious, as Athena doesn't know where it is. After an argument between Minerva and Annabeth, she revokes the magical properties of her daughter's Yankees cap, but Athena eventually restores them to help against Serapis. In The Chalice of the Gods, Athena helps Percy on his quest to return Ganymede's stolen chalice which Annabeth takes as a sign that her mother has finally accepted their relationship. Her color scheme is grey,[10] and her cabin in Camp Half-Blood is Cabin 6. In the film adaptation, Athena is portrayed by Melina Kanakaredes.\n\nApollo – The god of the sun, light, music, truth, and healing. His Greek children live in Cabin 7 in Camp Half-Blood. He serves as a supporting character in Percy Jackson & The Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus series, and becomes the main protagonist of The Trials of Apollo series as a mortal named Lester Papadopoulos. Apollo first appears in The Titan's Curse, where he transports a group of demigods and Hunters at the behest of his twin sister Artemis. Later, he assists the quest group in rescuing Artemis from the Titans, even though doing so has been forbidden by Zeus. At the end of The Last Olympian, Apollo chooses Rachel Dare as his new Pythia. After the war in the second series, the furious Zeus punishes Apollo with mortality for his failure to identify Gaea as a threat. In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, he is portrayed by Dimitri Lekkos.\n\nArtemis/Diana – The goddess of the moon, animals, youth, and hunting. Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo. Artemis, true to her vows, is distrusting of men who discourages the companionship or value of men, and encourages maidenhood. As a result, she has no demigod children, but recruits Hunters who serve as her companions and attendants. Cabin 8 is her honorary home at Camp Half-Blood, but because she is a virgin, it is populated only when her Hunters come to visit. Her Roman counterpart Diana only appears in The Tyrant's Tomb when Apollo summons her to help New Rome. Diana kills Tarquin and heals her brother's zombie infection. In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, Artemis is portrayed by Ona Grauer.\n\nHephaestus/Vulcan – The gods' blacksmith, and the father of Charles Beckendorf and Leo Valdez. At Camp Half-Blood, Cabin 9 is dedicated to him. Hephaestus acts as a major ally of Percy in The Battle of the Labyrinth. In The Lost Hero, he defies Zeus by speaking to Leo through his dreams and delivers the head of the mechanical dragon Festus for use as the figurehead for the Argo II. In the film adaptation of The Lightning Thief, Hephaestus is portrayed by Conrad Coates. Timothy Omundson portrays Hephaestus in the TV series. Unlike the book series, Hephaestus shows up early where he finds Annabeth in his amusement park hideout with Percy trapped in the same throne that Hera was once trapped in. After agreeing to free Percy, he allows them to claim Ares' shield as Hephaestus tells Annabeth that he'll put in a good word to Athena.\n\nAphrodite/Venus – The goddess of love and beauty, who first appears briefly in The Titan's Curse. Her appearance shifts constantly, always becoming more beautiful.[10] Cabin 10 at Camp Half-Blood is the home of her demigod children. In The Lightning Thief, Aphrodite is portrayed by Serinda Swan.\n\nHermes/Mercury – The messenger of the gods, and the god of travelers and thieves. He is the son of Zeus and Maia. In the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, Hermes helps Percy, hoping that he will be able to redeem Luke.[12] All unclaimed demigods are packed into Hermes' cabin, Cabin 11 because Hermes welcomes all travelers. In the film adaptations, Hermes is portrayed by Dylan Neal in the first film and by Nathan Fillion in the second. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Unlike the book series, Hermes is found at the Lotus Hotel and Casino where Percy and Annabeth try to get him to help them get into the Greek underworld. He was reluctant to help them due to an event that strained his relationship with Luke and that Poseidon advised him not to help anymore people get into the Greek underworld. After having found that Annabeth pickpocketed him, he does leave instructions and a map for them on his car.\n\nDionysus/Bacchus also known as Mr. D – The god of wine, parties and madness who is the son of Zeus and Semele. Dionysus was made the head of Camp Half-Blood as punishment for pursuing \"an off-limits wood nymph\" romantically. He is also banned from drinking alcohol as a part of his punishment and so is often seen drinking Diet Coke as a substitute. Dionysus is portrayed as a cynical and unfriendly misanthrope who does not appear to have much respect for other beings except for Ariadne. He is a powerful god, but his powers are shown the least throughout the series. He has two demigod sons named Castor and Pollux, both of whom are the sole inhabitants of Cabin 12. As Bacchus, the Roman centurion Dakota is his son. Dionysus was once a demigod who, like Hercules, was made into a god. His seat on the Olympian Council originally belonged to Hestia who decided to abdicate it after Dionysus was first made into a god to avoid conflict. Dionysus hates his job and has a low opinion of demigods, likening them to Theseus and his abandonment of Ariadne. However, he is shown to be kind and helpful towards demigods on a few occasions, saving Percy and his friends from the Manticore in The Titan's Curse, curing Chris Rodriguez's madness in The Battle of the Labyrinth and giving Nico counseling sessions in The Trials of Apollo following the death of Jason Grace. He typically refers to Percy by variations on his real name, only ever calling him Percy Jackson a few times in the series, usually only in extremely serious moments. In The Last Olympian, his sentence is shortened to only fifty more years following the defeat of Kronos. In The Mark of Athena, Dionysus' Roman form Bacchus appears to help the Heroes against two of the giants once they prove themselves to him. In The House of Hades, the giant Clytius states that it took the combined forces of Dionysus and Hercules when they were both demigods to defeat him the last time. In The Tower of Nero following his own punishment, Apollo suggests to Dionysus that Zeus might have a greater purpose to forcing Dionysus to run Camp Half-Blood and not to lose hope. Dionysus is portrayed by Luke Camilleri in the first film and by Stanley Tucci in the second. In the musical, he is portrayed by George Salazar. In the TV series, he is portrayed by Jason Mantzoukas.\n\nHestia/Vesta – The goddess of the hearth and home. Like Artemis, she swore a vow of chastity so no conflict can spring up about her allegiance. As a result, she does not have any demigod child. Hestia gives up her golden throne on Olympus to Dionysus/Bacchus to keep the peace on the Olympian council, making the number of male and female gods unbalanced with seven men and fiv"
