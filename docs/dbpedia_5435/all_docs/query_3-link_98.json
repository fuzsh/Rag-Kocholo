        "text": "Yves Degryse/Berlin (BE)\n\nshow | duration 110 min\n\nin English with Italian subtitles\n\nc/o Teatro La Cucina / Olinda onlus via Ippocrate 45, Milan\n\nThe making of Berlin is a portrait of a city. It is built around the extraordinary story of Friedrich Mohr, a Berliner who was the Berliner Philharmoniker’s stage manager during WWII. The making of Berlin – with live horn music – offers an unfiltered look at BERLIN’s work process. But above all, it tells the story of one of the ‘unbrave’ who failed to stand up when fellow Jewish musicians and friends were expelled from the orchestra. The making of Berlin is the final part of the Holocene cycle, during which BERLIN made several portraits of cities over the past twenty years.\n\nBERLIN helps Mohr to realize an as yet unfulfilled dream. At the end of WWII, the conductor of the Philharmonic decided to perform Siegfried’s Funeral March from Wagner’s Götterdämmerung one last time. The performance would be broadcast live on German state radio. Rehearsing with the entire orchestra in one location soon proved too dangerous due to ongoing bombing. So the conductor divided the orchestra into seven segments and had them rehearse in separate bunkers. Faltering (recording) technology threw a spanner in the works. Mohr’s ultimate wish is to perform the technical tour de force as initially planned seventy-five years after the date. The Götterdämmerung will be played from seven bunkers simultaneously and can be heard in its entirety on the radio. A daring feat for which BERLIN called on, among others, radio station Klara, the orchestra of Opera Ballet Vlaanderen and German actor Martin Wuttke (known from Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds).\n\nTheatre- and film-maker Fien Leysen records the creation process for a behind-the-scenes documentary. Her footage eventually ends up in the performance as well. You gradually discover together with BERLIN that Mohr’s story is full of inaccuracies and that he seems to want to restore the irreparable. How far can you stretch the truth when you’re looking for atonement?\n\ndirection Yves Degryse with (on stage) Yves Degryse, Geert De Vleesschauwer / Marjolein Demey / Bregt Janssens / Eveline Martens / Sam Loncke (afwisselend), Rozanne Descheemaeker / Matea Majic / Diechje Minne / Jonathan van der Beek (afwisselend) ; with (film) Friedrich Mohr, Martin Wuttke, Stefan Lennert, Werner Buchholz, Alisa Tomina, Krijn Thijs, Chantal Pattyn, Symfonisch Orkest Opera Ballet Vlaanderen, Alejo Pérez, Yves Degryse, Caroline Große, Michael Becker, Claire Hoofwijk, Alejandro Urrutia, Marek Burák, Marvyn Pettina, Farnaz Emamverdi, team BERLIN: Jane Seynaeve, Eveline Martens, Jessica Ridderhof, Geert De Vleesschauwer, Sam Loncke, Manu Siebens, Kurt Lannoye, team Opera Ballet Vlaanderen: Jan Vandenhouwe, Lise Thomas, Eva Knapen, Christophe De Tremerie video e video editing Geert De Vleesschauwer, Fien Leysen, Yves Degryse internship video editing Maria Feenstra drone shots Yorick Leusink, Solon Lutz behind the scenes footage Fien Leysen scenography Manu Siebens set construction Manu Siebens, Ina Peeters, Rex Tee, Joris Festjens set design and construction film Jessica Ridderhof, Klaartje Vermeulen, Ruth Lodder, Ina Peeters musical composition and mixing Peter Van Laerhoven live music (horn) Rozanne Descheemaeker / Matea Majic / Diechje Minne / Jonathan van der Beek (alternating) music film Peter Van Laerhoven, Tim Coenen, Symfonisch Orkest Opera Ballet Vlaanderen olv Alejo Pérez mixing orchestra Maarten Buyl sound design and mixing Arnold Bastiaanse sound recordings Bas De Caluwé, Maarten Moesen, Bart Vandebril technical coordination Manu Siebens, Geert De Vleesschauwer production management Jessica Ridderhof production support Germany Daniela Schwabe, Gordon Schirmer research Wagner Clem Robyns, Piet De Volder research internship Annika Serong photography Koen Broos, Gordon Schirmer technical coordination berlin Marjolein Demey day-to-day coordination and production assistant Jane Seynaeve production BERLIN coproduction DE SINGEL (Antwerp, BE), le CENTQUATRE-PARIS (FR), Opera Ballet Vlaanderen (BE), VIERNULVIER (Ghent, BE), C-TAKT (Limburg, BE), Theaterfestival Boulevard (Den Bosch, NL), Berliner Festspiele (DE) with the support of the Flemish Government, Sabam for Culture, Tax Shelter of the Belgian federal government via Flanders Tax Shelter\n\nPhoto by Koen Broos\n\nFounders of BERLIN in 2003, Bart Baele, Caroline Rochlitz and Yves Degryse decided not to choose a particular genre, but to venture into the realm of documentary filmmaking and let the places of their forays guide their inspiration. This philosophy resulted in two project cycles: Holocene (the current geological era) where the starting point is always a city or other place on the planet, and Horror Vacui (fear of the void) in which true and poignant stories are delicately unravelled around a table. The Holocene cycle includes Jerusalem, Iqaluit, Bonanza, Moscow and Zvizdal. The first three episodes of Horror Vacui are Tagfish, Land’s end and Perhaps all the dragons. BERLIN are still working on both cycles. The Making of Berlin is the last chapter of Holocene. The company has worked in 27 different countries in recent years, within various circuits: from theatres to exhibition spaces, from festivals to special locations.\n\nSimon Senn (CH)\n\nperformance | duration 60 min\n\nc/o ZONA K, admission allowed with membership 2024\n\nIn this digital conference that doubles as a demonstration and confession, Simon Senn, a videographer and visual artist from Geneva, demonstrates how the virtual world and the real world are not always in opposition, revealing the unexpected entanglements between technology, representation, gender, and law.\n\nSimon Senn’s experience began when he bought the digital replica of a female body online. He then went in search of the woman whose body he was « virtually » inhabiting. Onstage he conveys this disturbing experience to the audience.\n\nAfter downloading the replica (a detailed and evidently accurate reproduction), he brought it to life with easily purchased sensors and discovered what it felt like to « have » a female body – at least through his 3D glasses. The experience was moving. Who is this woman ? Can he do anything he likes with this digital body ? What about the new and enjoyable sensuality this virtual form offers him ? He managed to track down the young woman and begin a discussion with her (one that continues today), where together they investigate this third digital body that exists between them. Arielle is now part of the project and is present in the show.\n\nSimon Senn decided to consult a psychologist and explore his feelings of «gender disturbance », which continue to surprise him – does he perhaps suffer from « Snapchat dysmorphia », the clinically accepted psychological illness of those who wish to transform themselves in order to resemble their online image?\n\nconception and direction Simon Senn with Simon Senn, Arielle F. and a virtual body production Compagnie Simon Senn co-production Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne – Le Grütli, Centre de production et de diffusion des Arts vivants – Théâtre du Loup distribution and tour Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne with the support of Porosus – Pro Helvetia – Fondation Ernst Göhner – Pour-cent culturel Migros – Loterie Romande\n\nPhoto from simonsenn.com\n\nBorn in 1986, Simon Senn is an artist and theater director, and lives in Geneva. He obtained a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Haute école d’art et de design de Genève and a Master’s degree from Goldsmiths College in London. At first glance, his work seems to suggest that he is a socially engaged artist, speaking out against a certain type of injustice. However, his works sometimes reveal a more ambiguous approach, exploring aporias rather than articulating addressed criticisms. Even if his videos or installations are normally based on a certain reality, fiction is often mixed in. Be Arielle F is his first proposal for the stage, with which he received the second Prix d’encouragement pour les arts de la scène Premio in 2019. During the health crisis of 2020, a live stream and adapted version of the show was offered digitally by the Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne. In 2024, he collaborates with Indian dancer Rohee Uberoi to capture and encode the movement of Bharata natyam in their projet Rohee, to be shown in Vidy.\n\nAnt Hampton/Time Based Editions (UK/DE)\n\nlive collective experience | duration 80 min | in italian\n\nc/o ZONA K, admission allowed after membership 2024\n\nin collaboration with Ateatro\n\nA talk with the author will be held at the end of the performance on Thursday 16 May.\n\nBooks and reading have changed and continue to change. The advent of digital, the rediscovery of orality and the audio dimension, and forms of participatory art are multiplying ‘ways of reading’ in new and innovative, yet ancient ways. Hybrid, performative, multimedia, transmedia forms are emerging… These transformations are reflected on the book as a physical object and on libraries as places of encounter and experience.\n\nStarting from the experience of Borderline Visible, the author Ant Hampton and Stefano Parise, Director Area Biblioteche del Comune di Milano, will discuss these themes, moderated by lecturer and theatre and publishing expert Oliviero Ponte di Pino.\n\nAnt Hampton presents the first in a new series of ‘live books’ – Time Based Editions – in which photographs and audio take you on a journey through the pages interweaving history, autobiography, literature and an urgent investigation into the hidden atrocities perpetuated on the margins of Europe.\n\nBorderline Visible begins as a récit de voyage, a journey from Lausanne to Izmir undertaken by two artists and friends. In Greece, health problems force one of them to stop, while the other goes on to Turkey, suddenly remaining alone. The narrative turns into a moving and troubled psycho-geography. Moving from ‘we’ to ‘I’, from present to past, from the personal to the political, Ant Hampton attempts to give value and meaning to the all too human ruins of ambition, history and language. The careful process of recomposition gradually brings to light a complex constellation of Jewish history, the end of the Ottoman Empire and Sephardic diasporas, rumours, earthquakes, tourism and forced migration, mental health and dementia, swallows and TS Eliot’s The Waste Land.\n\nIn the collective experience, the spectators are invited to participate in this journey together, flipping back and forth through the pages of the book, comparing images, closing and opening their eyes, drawing lines on the maps with a finger, guided by an audio track that combines narration, music, field recordings and instructions on how to get through the book.\n\nAfter the two collective appointments, Borderline Visible will be available for individual viewing in Italian, English, French and Dutch from 18 to 26 May (excluding Mondays) at 3.30 p.m. and 5.30 p.m. at Casa degli Artisti Milano.

His work since 1999 has often involved guiding people through unrehearsed situations and interactive relations, using automated devices. His three collaborations with Tim Etchells are participative experiences for two at a time, combining audio with different engagements with the page: text and silent reading (The Quiet Volume, 2010); archive photography (Lest We See, 2015); and mark-making/ erasure (Not to Scale, 2020). In more recent years his practice has expanded into a wider investigation of risk-taking and leaps of faith, for example with The Thing – An Automatic Workshop in Everyday Disruption, created with Christophe Meierhans. These and many other of his “Autoteatro” works continue to tour internationally in over 80 language versions, some of them without anyone needing to travel – a paradoxical outcome for an art committed to liveness and presence which in turn informed his 2021 advocacy and research project: ShowingWithoutGoing.live – an Atlas. Together with David Bergé, he co-founded Time Based Editions in 2023.\n\nLina Saneh and Rabih Mroué (LB)\n\nshow | duration 50 min\n\nin French with Italian subtitles\n\nc/o ZONA K, admission allowed upon 2024 membership\n\nAfter its premiere in 2009, Photo-Romance immediately become one of the most successful international theatre pieces and is now, after touring worldwide, is coming to Mousonturm in its newest version: in the roles of author and censor Lina Saneh and Rabih Mroué discuss the photo novella adaptation of a historical film document, which shows the enthusiasm of Italian crowds at Hitler’s Mussolini visit. The two of them – him, a former leftist activist, she, a divorced homemaker – met in Beirut in 2006 shortly after Israel’s attack on Lebanon: two lonely people, uncomfortable with the hubbub outside. By mixing fiction and reality, Photo-Romance deconstructs the political logic, as well as the illusion of theatre and shows “truth” to be a construction of possibilities.\n\nConcept, text and direction Lina Saneh and Rabih Mroué Translation Masha Refka Set design Samar Maakaroun Music Charbel Haber Soundtrack Lina Saneh, Rabih Mroué, Sarmad Louis Direction of photography Sarmad Louis jeu pour la bande-image Rabih Mroué, Lina Saneh Special guest Mona Mroué Assistant director and executive producer Petra Serhal Costumes Zeina Saab de Melero Makeup Stéphanie Aznarez Production assistant Ashkal Alwan (Beyrouth) With Lina Saneh, Charbel Haber, Rabih Mroué\n\nDirector, performer and playwright, Lina Majdalanie is a Lebanese artist, living in Berlin.

The show is the telling of a man which in life has made many wrong choices, a man which unluckiness has gotten fierce to, a man who’s touched the bottom, but from which he risen back. Lorenzo’s story became a podcast, titled Io ero il Milanese, produced by RaiPlay Sound, become a real and true case in 2022. It took off quietly, and thanks to word of mouth it conquered the public, overtaking 700 thousand plays. Now Lorenzo S.’s story can be known live: theatre space is, per antonomasia, the space of the revolution, hence suitable to give voice to the personal revolution of Lorenzo S. And his past, difficult, tough, but also full of hope.\n\nof Mauro Pescio e Lorenzo S. with Mauro Pescio and the special participation of Coro Amici della Nave di San Vittore under the cure of Associazione Amici della Nave, Associazione Verso Itaca, ZONA K\n\nMauro Pescio, radio and theatrical author. After graduating from Civica Scuola di Teatro Paolo Grassi di Milano he moves to Rome where he founds a theatre company with which he works for ten years. From 2012 he is author of “Voi siete qui” for Radio24 and from 2015 Radio 2’s “Pascal”. He has written “La piena” for Audible, Amazon’s first Italian production on a theatre podcast.

In the monologue Casero tries to rebuild an incomplete national historiography through the recounts of the grandma who witnessed the civil war. It deals however with a fragmented narration, fruit of an auto-censorship at this point internalised at transgenerational level. This performative work is born from the reflection which, to confront Spain’s recent political violence, it is necessary to reveal the habits of domestic oppression on which oblivion has been woven into generation after generation, idem for the aftermath which this historic omission has produced in the successive descendents of families such as Casero’s.\n\nAutofiction and historical analysis go hand in hand in this memory exercise which, through the language of light, examines the surroundings of the collective silence, inviting the spectator to explore the empty gaps of memory in which decades of furtively repressed decades of pain are insinuated. With the intention of intimately toning down the trauma provoked by the official speech which talks about winners and wins as collectives with no personal background, Casera investigates the varying generational behaviours respecting the institutionalised amnesia, incarnated in their relatives.\n\nUntil what point can silence push itself before becoming oblivion?\n\nIdeation and direction Sergi Casero Nieto author Testo di Sergi Casero Nieto with citations and fragments of Jorge Luís Borges, Federico García Lorca, text of memory of Clara Valverde interpreted by Sergi Casero Nieto assistant to the dramaturgy Mónica Molins Duran assistance Elsa Casanova Sempé English translation Vincent Sanchís Puerto Italian translation Sofia Breschiane scenography, stage and stage objects Sergi Casero light design Sergi Casero with the supervision and help of Mifuel Angel Ruz Velasco costumes Sara Clemente graphic design Sergi Casero distribution Domenico Garogalo production Centrale Fies / Live Works residence Centro de Residencias Matadero Madrid\n\nSergi Casero Nieto (Barcelona, 1991) His work occurs at the intersection between design, action and research. In his work he explores the use of performance as an instrument to represent the results of research, paying particular attention to the projection of scenographic techniques. The historical information becomes physically present in his work, delving deeper into counter-narrations such as the oral testimonies or the collective memory, putting into discussion the hegemonic narrations through the presentation of multiple past perspectives.

Sotto il nome del demone che tentò Faust, Mephistopheles, Anagoor raduna il materiale video raccolto tra il 2012 e il 2020 in un unico viaggio per immagini attraverso le lacrime del mondo, musicato in un live set elettronico da Mauro Martinuz. La materia cinematografica di spettacoli teatrali come Lingua Imperii, Virgilio Brucia, Socrate il sopravvissuto, Faust, Orestea, è composta da immagini profeticamente raccolte nei musei e nei templi, nelle case di cura per anziani e negli allevamenti intensivi, tra macellai, pastori e pellegrini, in India, in Iran, ad Olimpia, sulla ferita campagna veneta e sul Vesuvio. L’enorme quantità di materiale inedito trova nuova composizione in questo volo e caduta in forma di concerto cum figuris. Un concerto per immagini sul mondo, l’umano e l’animale, la violenza contro i corpi e il profitto in un’opera che ben mostra la visione estetica e politica della compagnia. Un’opera-film dove l’immagine che scorre trova il suo movimento nel suono live di Mauro Martinuz per condurci in un contemporaneo fuori dal tempo: quello dei corpi e della loro devastazione, dei soprusi di un capitalismo sempre più accelerato che nega le stagioni, il paesaggio e i sentimenti. Uomo contro natura ma anche uomo contro uomo.

Il teatro di Anagoor risponde a un’estetica iconica che precipita in diversi formati finali dove performing art, filosofia, letteratura e scena ipermediale entrano in dialogo, pretendendo tuttavia, con forza e in virtù della natura di quest’arte, di rimanere teatro. Dal 2008 Anagoor ha la sua sede nella campagna trevigiana, presso La Conigliera, allevamento cunicolo convertito in atelier e dal 2010 fa parte del progetto Fies Factory di Centrale Fies – art work space. Michele Mele e Annalisa Grisi completano il team seguendo management e curatela del progetto artistico.\n\nZONA K (IT)\n\nWE ARE NOTHING WE WILL BE EVERYTHING\n\nParticipatory theatre play\n\nAt Cittadella Dei Giovani\n\nViale Giuseppe Garibaldi, 7, 11100 Aosta AO\n\ninfo and bookings: 016535971 – info@cittadelladeigiovani.it\n\nDoes work really define who we are?\n\nHow well does it meet our expectations?\n\nHow much weight does it bear on our lives and on the choices we make?\n\nA participatory performance on working men and women, a choir of instances and inquiries.\n\nA public call, tens of workers which respond and a chorus. The “work” like fil rouge. Work as an aspiration, a forced choice, a source of sustenance, but most of all as a motor which derails trajectories, defines self esteem and personal beliefs, and which determines where and who with we spend most of or time. But does work truly define who we really are? How well does it meet out expectations? How much weight does it bare on our life and the choices we make? Does comprehending happiness or individual dissatisfactions help us evaluate collective wellbeing? The concatenation of stories becomes an investigative instrument to transform the collective experience into a shared narration, a hymn thought as a total art piece to re-hug a communities wish, and, through theatre, find new forms of representing reality.\n\na ZONA K project, direction Alessandro Renda, scenic implant Fabio Cherstich, testo Riccardo Spagnulo, con Matteo Gatta.

It decides this because, after the end of the first lockdown, it feels the urge to listen to in the immediate successive stage, would lose their position of employment. Nicola and Enrico hence decide to cruise around Italy at the research of those places in which the pages of Marx became people, locations, events. One day they end up in a factory, the GKN of Campi Bisenzio, which has just closed. One morning of the 2021 summer, the 9th to be precise, the 422 employees which worked there received an email: they did not have to return to work the day after: they’ve been fired. From that day on the employees occupy the factory. In the first days of Autumn the company entered for the first time at the GKN. The workers invite them to eat boar together. From that day on they sleep there, inside the occupied factory, on some cots. Meanwhile Nicola and Enrico interview the hundreds of workers, participate at pickets, assemblies, manifestations, listen, observe, each time looking to return to Marx’s pages to try to establish a creative dialogue between “Capital” and what happens in the environment, between a classic on philosophical and economic literature and a group of human beings in flesh and bones. Then their attention shifted onto three people in particular: Iorio, maintainer, Felice, worker responsible for setting up and Tiziana, worker responsible for cleaning, which they invite to the theatre to make a show together. This is the start of the creation of Il Capital, a show which recounts the meaning what spending 20 years in a factory making pieces, of the difference between who’s done it and who has never done it, of the extraction of surplus value, the closing of one factory amongst many, of what happens when a group of workers decide to attempt to make history, of how for some time the logics of the Capitale become ousted from a perimeter of space, one of an occupied industrial establishment. Of how Il Capital, sooner or later will return to present the bill. Il Capital Is also the story of the meeting between a theatre company and a group of metal labourers in the Capitale’s autumn. Il Capital is especially a show on time, on its passing, on who owns it, on who sells it, buys it, frees it.\n\nA Kepler-452 project dramaturgy and direction Enrico Baraldi and Nicola Borghesi with Nicola Borghesi and Tiziana de Biasio, Felice Ieraci, Francesco Iorio – factory workers collective GKN and with the participation of Dario Salvetti light and scenic space Vincent Longuemare sound design Alberto Bebo Guidetti video and documentation Chiara Calió technical-scientific advice on “Capital” by Karl Marx Giovanni Zanotti assistant to the direction Roberta Gabriele machinist Andrea Bovaia light and video technician Giuseppe Tomasi sound engineer Francesco Vacca scenic elements created in the Laboratorio di ERT production Emilia Romagna Teatro ERT / Teatro Nazionale thanks to Stefano Breda and Cantiere Camilo Cienfuegos di Campi Bisenzio\n\nKepler-452 is a theatre company born in 2015 in Bologna from the encounter between Nicola Borghesi; Enrico Baraldi, Paola Aiello and, for the organisation role, first Michela Buscema and then, since 2021, Roberta Gabriele. Since it’s birth the company cultivates this urgency: opening the doors of theatres, go out, observe what’s around, in the unshakable conviction that reality has an autonomous dramaturgical force. The theatrical formats created range from the involvement of non-professionals on stage on the basis of their own biographies, to theatrical reportages that transform investigations into reality into performative moments, to the creation of audio-guided itineraries and other devices for interaction with the urban space, up to the creation of the Festival 20 30 which, starting from 2014, brought many under 30s on stage in an attempt to paint a generational fresco. Starting from 2018, a production path begins with ERT / Teatro Nazionale (“ Il giardino dei ciliegi – Trent’anni di felicità in comodato d’uso” (The cherry garden – Thirty years of happiness on loan for use) (2018) while in 2019 F. – Perdere le cose” (F. – Losing things) debuts. Starting from 2017, its creats several editions of Comizi d’amore, a participatory theatre format that tells the story of communities on stage starting from the questions posed by Pasolini in his honomymous documentary.\n\nphotos Luca Del Pia\n\nMammalian Diving Reflex/Darren O’Donnell (CA)\n\n– NATIONAL PREMIERE –\n\nA ZONA K and Triennale Teatro Milano project\n\nParticipatory multimedia performance with the use of 3D visuals for 30 spectators | duration 90 min | the performance is characterised by an intense presence of smoke\n\nat ZONA K\n\nWith nostalgia we watch that little red dot in the night sky and we stupidly dream of restarting, as if problems on earth are resolved more easily at -65º and with the help of high doses of cosmic radiation.

After having distanced itself from a more traditional theatrical setting to move towards more socially engaging practices focused on performance. Creating shows to research the contradictions to transform into aesthetically brilliant experiences, the Mammalian always look to overtake themselves and the public with ideas and sensations, leaving intuition to lead the way.\n\nDarren O’Donnell is a novelist, essayist, dramaturge, filmmaker, performance director, artistic director and founder of Mammalian Diving Reflex. His mission is the one to give life to a social tissue which deeply integrates culture and cultural institutions, increasing their capacity for social response. In 2000 he won the Pauline McGibbon Awards for direcion and was nominatod for numerous Dora Awards of Toronto for writing, direction and acting, winning, alongside Naomi Campbell, for the project While Mice. His work with the Mammalian company entered in the top 100 of the Yerba Beuna Culture Centre in 2016. He has been nominated twice for the german BKM Preis Kulturelle Bildung and New York’s Ellen Stewart inagrual prize.\n\nPhotos © Paul Blakemore\n\nSilke Huysmans & Hannes Dereere (BE)\n\n– Season preview 2023 –\n\nmultimedia performance with English and Italian subtitles | duration 60 min\n\nA meeting with the company will be held at the end of the performance on Friday 24 February.\n\nc/o Out Off Theatre, via Mac Mahon 16\n\n‘We know more about the surface of the moon than we do about the bottom of the ocean.’ This statement is often heard when talking about the deep sea. Worldwide, only 10 percent of the ocean floor has been mapped and explored. At a moment in history when the planet we live on seems to have been explored extensively, some places remain unstudied and untouched.\n\nAfter their acclaimed performances Mining Stories and Pleasant Island, Silke Huysmans and Hannes Dereere present the final part of their trilogy on mining. This time, they focus on a completely new industry: deep sea mining. With resources on land becoming increasingly scarce and overexploited, mining companies turn towards the ocean. In the spring of 2021, three ships gather on a remote patch of the Pacific Ocean. One of them belongs to the Belgian dredging company Deme-Gsr. Four kilometres below the sea surface, their mining robot is scraping the seabed in search of metals. On another ship, an international team of marine biologists and geologists keep a close watch on the operation. A third ship completes the fleet: on board of the infamous Rainbow Warrior, Greenpeace activists protest against this potential future industry.\n\nFrom their small apartment in Brussels, Silke and Hannes connect with the three ships through satellite. Each of the ships represents one pillar of the public debate: industry, science and activism. Through a series of interviews and conversations, an intimate portrait of this new industry emerges. The piece is an attempt to capture a potentially pivotal moment in the history of the earth. How much deeper can mining companies dig, and what are we as humankind actually digging towards? What are the challenges and risks? What opportunities potentially lay ahead?\n\nby & with Silke Huysmans & Hannes Dereere dramaturgy Dries Douibi sound mix Lieven Dousselaere outside eye Pol Heyvaert technique Korneel Coessens, Piet Depoortere, Koen Goossens & Babette Poncelet production CAMPO coproduction Bunker (Ljubljana), De Brakke Grond (Amsterdam), Noorderzon – Festival of Performing Arts and Society (Groningen), Zürcher Theater Spektakel (Zürich), Beursschouwburg & Kunstenfestivaldesarts (Brussels), PACT Zollverein (Essen), Théâtre de la Ville (Paris) & Festival d’Automne à Paris (Paris) residencies Kunstenwerkplaats, Pilar, Bara142 (Toestand), De Grote Post, 30CC, GC De Markten & GC Felix Sohie special thanks to John Childs, Henko De Stigter, Patricia Esquete, Iason-Zois Gazis, Jolien Goossens, Matthias Haeckel, An Lambrechts, Ted Nordhaus, Maureen Penjueli, Surabhi Ranganathan, Duygu Sevilgen, Joey Tau, Saskia Van Aalst, Kris Van Nijen, Vincent Van Quickenborne & Annemiek Vink thanks to all conversation partners & the people who helped with the transcriptions\n\nSilke Huysmans studied acting at the KASK School of Arts Ghent and Hannes Dereere theatre science at the University of Ghent. With their performances, the two Brussels-based artists investigate the use of journalistic and documentary elements within theatre. Underlying their work is extensive field research, which they use to shape their projects. Since 2016, they have been working on a trilogy involving long-term research on mining. For the first part entitled Mining Stories (2016), Silke and Hannes returned to where she grew up in Brazil. In 2015, a dam explosion flooded this place with toxic mining waste, causing one of the biggest ecological mining disasters in recent history. Mining Stories received the main prize at the Zürcher Theaterspektakel 2018 (Switzerland). From 2019 is the second part, Pleasant Island. In this performance, the tiny island state Nauru holds a mirror up to the whole world. Nauru was once a paradise in the Pacific. After decades of colonisation and mining, this island finds itself in grave danger, literally up to its neck in rising sea levels. Out of the Blue concludes the trilogy and premiered at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in May 2022.\n\nRimini Protokoll (DE)\n\nTHE WALKS is an app with a series of walks by German theatre company, Rimini Protokoll. Each walk is a short audio experience for a specific place in your city, and an invitation to rediscover and interact with your environment.\n\nIt takes approximately 20 minutes to do an audio walk. Get going whenever you want. You decide how many of the walks you’d like to do and in what order. The stories and soundscapes in the short audio experiences are global in scope. “The Walks” connects people around the world in a local experience via the fundamental human action of walking.\n\nWalking in public gained new meaning with the COVID-19 pandemic. An ancient, daily ritual became an integral part of the new normality. People meet, walk, stroll through neighborhoods, play in landscapes, and perceive their environment anew with every stride.\n\nTHE WALKS understands walking as a theatrical scenario – an audio-guided walk in parks, a staged walk in supermarkets or timed interactions on riverbanks. In every city, voices, sounds, and music turn familiar places into sites and landscapes into stages step by step through storytelling, dialogical situations, choreographic discoveries, or musical and rhythmic variations on walking. The title of every walk indicates where or how to do it: “Walk for a cemetery,” “Walk along the water,” or “Walk around a roundabout.”\n\nTHE WALKS is a production of Rimini Apparat co-produced by ZONA K\n\n________________________\n\nApp info: “The Walks” is a smartphone app that you can download from the App Store or Google Play at a cost of xxxx euro.

Rimini Protokoll often develop their stage-works, interventions, performative installations and audio plays together with experts who have gained their knowledge and skills beyond the theatre. Furthermore, they like to transpose rooms or social structures into theatrical formats. Many of their works feature interactivity and a playful use of technology.\n\nOn top of that, Rimini Protokoll received the Mülheimer Dramatikerpreis for “Karl Marx: Das Kapital, Erster Band”, the German theatre award Faust, the Grand Prix Theatre from the Swiss Federal Office for Culture, the European Theatre Award, the Silver Lion at the Theatre Biennale in Venice, as well as the German Audio Play Award and the War Blinded Audio Play Prize.\n\nSince 2003, the production office of Rimini Protokoll is in Berlin.\n\nRAZIONE K – BOX 2\n\nThe events of the second part of the 2021 RAZIONE K Emergency food kit for theatre addicts season\n\nFrom 8 September 2021\n\nTHE WALKS\n\nRimini Protokoll (DE)\n\na Rimini Apparat production co-produced by ZONA K\n\n[smartphone app]\n\n21 September – 3 October 2021 h. 15.00 – 18.00 every 10′ [closed on Mondays]\n\nFASE NOVE // Assolo Urbano\n\nEkin Bozkurt, Chiara Campara, Giulia Oglialoro, Riccardo Tabilio, Francesco Venturi (IT)\n\nwith Rimini Protokoll (DE)\n\na project by ZONA K and Casa degli Artisti\n\n[urban walk] with departure from Casa degli Artisti\n\n2 October 2021 h. 16.30\n\nRADIO OLIMPIA, BOMBA LIBERA TUTT!\n\nCollettivo MMM (IT)\n\n[team performance game] c/o open square in Via Toce\n\n20 – 31 October 2021\n\nVernissage 20 October h. 19.00\n\nTuesday – Sunday from h. 10.00 to 13.00 and from h. 15.00. to 20.00 [closed on Mondays]\n\nGREETINGS FROM …\n\nMarilyne Grimmer (FR)\n\n[photographic exhibition]\n\n5 – 7 November 2021 h. 20.00\n\n#NUOVIPOVERI\n\nGuinea Pigs (IT)\n\n[show]\n\n22 – 28 November 2021\n\nLA SETTIMANA DELLE RESIDENZE DIGITALI\n\n[shows and performances online]\n\n26 November h. 20.00\n\n27 November 2021 h. 17.00 and 20.00\n\nTHE OTHERS لخرین\n\nCorps Citoyen (IT/TN)\n\n[performance]\n\n10 – 12 December 2021 h 20.00\n\nCURVA CIECA\n\nMuna Mussie (IT)\n\n[performance]\n\nRAZIONE K – BOX 1\n\nThe events of the first part of the 2021 RAZIONE K season\n\n– Preview –\n\n21 – 23 April 2021 h. 16.30\n\nPROJECT AND DEVICE – traces of a multimedia theatre\n\nfor the HUMAN RIGHTS FESTIVAL\n\n[digital column]\n\n19 – 22 May 2021 TURIN / 15 – 19 June 2021 MILAN\n\nPLAY ME (ORIGINS PROJECT)\n\na production ZONA K, creation CODICEFIONDA (IT)\n\ndramaturgical advice Agrupación Señor Serrano (ES)\n\nTurin c/o Palazzo del ‘900\n\nMilan c/o ZONA K\n\n13 – 14 July 2021 h. 21.45\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN\n\nAgrupación Señor Serrano (ES)\n\npresented in collaboration with and c/o Olida/Da vicino nessuno è normale\n\n20 – 21 July 2021 h. 21.00\n\nA CERTAIN VALUE\n\nAnna Rispoli / Martina Angelotti (IT)\n\npresented in collaboration with and c/o BASE\n\nRAZIONE K\n\nEmergency food kit for theatre addicted\n\nRazione K was the food ration of American soldiers during World War II.\n\nFor us, the RAZIONE K is almost like a small but substantial survival ration, “light and compact”. It is about doing and giving what is necessary to stay alive but dosing resources and energy. It is calibrating our strengths and weights, to be really ready to start again in the light of the changes that every event of this magnitude brings with it.\n\nIt is a change of pace with respect to the past, the sign of an intermediate year between a before, very clear and defined, and an after still to be written. On the one hand, it is a transitional year that brings to a close projects that have already begun but have not yet been presented to the public. On the other hand, it presents new ideas, following up on the peculiarities that have distinguished us over the years: audience participation, urban performance, attention to the present and research into new languages in the field of live performance.\n\nThere are no more focuses but a part 1 and a part 2. Continuing the metaphor of Razione K: a lunch and a dinner, a first course and a second course, a box 1 and a box 2. A first part that is concentrated from April to July and a second part that starts again in September and includes the autumn/winter until the end of 2021.\n\nThe desire to reiterate the importance of sharing projects and ideas with other realities of the artistic and cultural scene in Milan remains firm. Never as in the past year and in the current one has the need for relations, perspective exchanges and comparison on the future been so important.This confirms the collaboration with DANAE/Teatro delle Moire, Olinda/Da vicino nessuno è normale, IntercettAzioni, BASE, Stratagemmi, the Cooperativa Sociale Stripes, Terzo Paesaggio.\n\nOn a national level, ZONA K is a partner of In-Situ Italia, a cultural consortium for art in public space created together with Indisciplinarte of Terni in collaboration with BASE Milan, Sardegna Teatro of Cagliari and Pergine Festival in Trentino. “In-Situ Italia” gathers the Italian partners of “In-Situ”, the European platform created in 2003 and which today counts 19 partners from 13 countries. In the four-year period 2020-2024, the Italian consortium will promote the networking of skills and resources, collaborating within the European project “(Un)Common Spaces”.\n\nMoreover, from this year ZONA K is among the new partners who have joined the Call for Digital Residencies conceived and promoted by Centro di Residenza della Toscana (Armunia – CapoTrave/Kilowatt), in partnership with Associazione Marchigiana Attività Teatrali AMAT, the Cooperative Anghiari Dance Hub, ATCL Lazio for Spazio Rossellini, the Centre of Residency Emilia-Romagna (L’Arboreto Teatro Dimora di Mondaino – La Corte Ospitale), the Luzzati Foundation Teatro della Tosse in Genoa.\n\nBOX 1 APRIL – JULY 2021 BOX 2 SEPTEMBER – DECEMBER 2021\n\nCODICEFIONDA (IT) dram. cons.

But often, when you look down from above, you see clouds and fog covering everything and the landscape is constantly changing. What is the world like then? What is the truth like? Does it exist? In The Mountain, the latest show by the award-winning Catalan company, the first Everest expedition with an uncertain outcome, Orson Welles with the War of the Worlds, a fake news website, a drone scanning the audience, snow, fragmented images and Vladimir Putin speaking contentedly about trust and truth converge.\n\nIncontri online di danza di comunità\n\nSorry, this entry is only available in Italian.\n\nTrasforma un racconto e un’opera d’arte in un gesto.\n\nAttraverso l’esplorazione personale e l’improvvisazione, creiamo insieme una sequenza di gesti che ci divengono cari e arriviamo alla composizione di una sequenza da restituire al gruppo.\n\nIl movimento creativo diventa stimolo per l’immaginazione: mente e corpo, riflessione e azione, da soli ma in gruppo anche a distanza, per risvegliare la creatività, scoprire possibilità e recuperare un po’ di tempo per sé.\n\nCHIUSO 24 aprile primo incontro – dalla Letteratura alla Danza\n\npartendo da un paio di brani tratti dal “Colibrì” di Sandro Veronesi, ognuno darà movimento alle immagini ricevute; rifletteremo sulle azioni agite spontaneamente dal corpo, sulle pause, sulle forme assunte. Attraverso il tramite dello schermo, cercheremo la relazione con gli altri partecipanti e accoglieremo le idee che questa produrrà. Infine, selezionati i movimenti per noi più significativi, li collegheremo tra loro e sulla musica in una composizione da ripetere e perfezionare.\n\nEd ecco: una danza, un atto artistico che offriamo allo sguardo dell’altro, che racconterà qualcosa di noi.\n\n15 maggio secondo incontro – dall’Arte alla Danza\n\nl’osservazione di un paio di sculture (la “Nike di Samotracia” e “Forme uniche della continuità nello spazio” di Umberto Boccioni) ci offrirà spunti di riflessione sul movimento e la stasi: si può rendere il dinamismo attraverso una forma fissa? Cosa ci invita al movimento e cosa invece ci chiede la pausa, ci trattiene? Cosa succede al nostro corpo, alla pelle e all’interno, quando ci muoviamo? Cosa rappresenta il movimento per noi? Dove vorremmo andare? A quale velocità? Ognuno risponderà con la propria danza a queste e ad altre domande, cercherà una propria forma simbolica e la perfezionerà in funzione della sua resa estetica ed espressiva.\n\nOgni schermo collegato al laboratorio diverrà così una vetrina espositiva all’interno di un moderno Museo di sculture viventi.\n\n___________________\n\nCosto € 30,00 per 1 incontro\n\nCosto € 60,00 per 2 incontri\n\nPer informazioni e iscrizioni:\n\norganizzazione@zonak.it\n\n02.97378443 – 393.8767162\n\n___________________\n\nSe invece vuoi procedere direttamente all’iscrizione clicca QUI\n\nIl percorso si svolgerà su piattaforma Zoom.

Dal settembre 2013 tengo laboratori di danza educativa e di comunità rivolti a bambini e ragazzi, sia nelle scuole di Milano e provincia (dal nido alla secondaria di secondo grado), sia in strutture pubbliche e private in orario pomeridiano. Ho collaborato con l’Accademia del Teatro alla Scala, Lilopera, Le voci della città, Reggio Children; attualmente lavoro per ZonaK, Civita, Gallerie d’Italia.\n\nPhoto by Olivia Bauso on Unsplash\n\nFILM AB!

Preferibilmente storie vere, storie che qualcuno realmente ha vissuto. Ecco perché ho deciso di diventare una documentarista.\n\nQuesto è stato il mio inizio nel mondo delle immagini in movimento per la televisione e il cinema. L’arrivo di mia figlia mi ha portato più a contatto con le fiabe, la magia, lo stupore, la curiosità e la fantasia. Mi chiede spesso di raccontarle della mia vita quando ero piccola.\n\nPenso che i racconti ci aiutino a capire il nostro intimo e il mondo che ci circonda. E i bambini con la loro visione molto speciale delle cose e le loro domande correlate possono darci un accesso completamente nuovo non solo alla vita degli altri, ma anche alla nostra.\n\nPer me, il video e teatro sono una combinazione ideale per andare a esplorare a fondo delle meraviglie e delle narrazioni di vita. Con questi strumenti è possibile esprimere se stessi, vivere una fantasia, ma anche sperimentare e rendere accessibile la storia di altre persone.\n\nSono molto felice di aver potuto accostare da diversi anni la mia passione per le narrazioni e le immagini in movimento ai bambini, che mi mostrano quanto sia intenso essere pienamente coinvolti in una esperienza, nella vita e in tutto quello che li riguarda e che mi fanno pensare alle grandi domande della vita.\n\nRESIDENZE DIGITALI 2021\n\nSorry, this entry is only available in Italian.\n\nCorso online di sceneggiatura cinematografica\n\nSorry, this entry is only available in Italian.\n\nQual è il metodo migliore per scrivere la sceneggiatura di un film?\n\nCome dare vita ai personaggi?\n\nDalla creazione dell’idea di base alla costruzione della struttura e allo sviluppo del paradigma della narrazione, il corso propone un viaggio teorico e pratico sul cinema contemporaneo, attraverso nozioni tecniche sulla scrittura di una sceneggiatura e sulla fotografia.\n\nFADE IN prevede un breve excursus sui manuali di sceneggiatura di Syd Field e di Linda Seger, sulle suggestioni critiche sul cinema di André Bazin, padre della Nouvelle Vague ed elementi di teoria dei film di Thomas Elsaesser e Malte Hagener integrati con le idee innovative di Marco Bertozzi sul documentario come riuso, performance, autobiografia.\n\nI temi affrontati durante gli incontri:\n\n1. come scrivere una grande sceneggiatura\n\n2. la crescita del personaggio è il lievito del film\n\n3. il soggetto del film in tre frasi.

On the theater website, instead of conversing with Buñuel, Carrière or Shakespeare, the internet user converses with ENA, a bot that mimics human conversation. According to the Wikipedia definition, a bot is a sequence of computers that performs repetitive tasks that would be impossible or very burdensome for a human being. To learn how to write, ENA was shown 8 million documents.\n\nThe bots that answer the phone when we call big companies, those that affect social networks when elections are approaching or the bots we face in electronic games are brothers and sisters of ENA. But ENA doesn’t want to sell us anything, doesn’t want to inform us of any news (fake or real) and doesn’t even want to comfort us. ENA was conceived with the only purpose of pretending to be a human being, therefore to make theatre. ENA does not understand what she says or is told. For ENA, language is just a sequence of signs to which it responds with another sequence. Any dialogue with ENA will only make sense to the person participating in the conversation and to the audience reading the conversation on the theater’s website at the time. Having a dialogue with ENA is like playing squash with a wall that returns the ball to you. Keep in mind that, as a human being, you may be surprised or angry, or tired. ZONA K cannot be held responsible for messages sent by ENA which may be unpredictable.\n\nCAUTION:\n\nENA learned to write with GPT-2 (OpenAI) and dialogues thanks to DialoGPT (Microsoft) of the Transformer (Google) database. For this reason, although he understands Italian, he answers only in English. Nobody’s perfect.\n\n________________________\n\nInfo: online collective writing • duration as desired • in Italian and English translated simultaneously\n\nParticipation: free, non-stop 24 hours a day on the zonak.it website\n\nIf you have spoken to ENA and want a copy of your dialogue, send an email to biglietti@zonak.it clearly indicating the nickname and day of your interview\n\n________________________\n\nA project by Roger Bernat with the collaboration of Mar Canet and Varvara Guljajeva web design and programming Mar Canet and Varvara Guldjajeva graphics Marie-Klara González coordination Helena Febrés co-production FFF and Teatre Lliure thanks to Fabiano Cocozza\n\nBIO\n\nMagdalena Barile lives and works in Milan. Author, playwright and screenwriter, she teaches Theatre Writing at the Civica Scuola di Teatro Paolo Grassi and at the Scuola Belleville and Screenplay at the IED – Istituto Europeo di Design.

For many it was also a psychological polarization: between what is essential and what is superfluous. The artistic professions are not among those socially necessary.\n\nShould we think of a world in which art will no longer play a role? Can we imagine a reality that cancels the existence of art and of those who work there? What relationship can art have with each of us in this state of crisis? Is something that has long since gotten stale about to end? Can such a profound crisis be an opportunity?\n\nPHASE NINE || Urban Solo invites us to ask ourselves these questions in the context of the city. Nine important places for art in Milan – some iconic, others unusual – become the stage for nine audio installations which, through interviews with various experts, are confronted with a provocative question: why does art exist and not nothing?\n\n________________________\n\ndeparture Casa degli Artisti, Corso Garibaldi, 89/A – via Tommaso da Cazzaniga -M2 Moscova-.\n\nInfo: urban walk for 1 person – in Italian – closed on Monday\n\nTickets can be picked up on the day of the walk 15 minutes before the start at Casa degli Artisti, Corso Garibaldi, 89/A – via Tommaso da Cazzaniga -M2 Moscova-.\n\nBASIC INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPATING\n\nA document will be requested as a deposit for the use of the navigator.\n\nAs this is a route with mandatory stops, the departure time cannot be postponed.

The theme of work remained central, but he decided to focus in particular on work in the world of culture and art, a theme made even more urgent by the crisis caused by the pandemic. It was decided to work precisely on contingency, considering it an opportunity, investigating the changing perception of spaces and cultural operators.\n\nRimini Protokoll was founded in 2000 by Stefan Kaegi, Helgard Haug and Daniel Wetzel and over the years has collaborated with various constellations of artists. The goal is to expand the means of the theater in order to create new perspectives on reality. Rimini Protokoll avails itself of the collaboration of experts, whose knowledge and skills go beyond the theater, to produce shows, radio productions and urban interventions that often translate urban spaces and social structures into theatrical formats.\n\nREALITY?\n\nIn the presentation of the Reality 2020 season we told our vision of reality that did not want to translate into a philosophical disquisition or a flattening on the spectacularization of contemporary media. It was a title that wanted to close a three-year period where ample space was given to artists who have done their research and art from the Theater of Reality. A three-year period that started with Power and continued with Economy in which we felt the need to analyze and interpret the present, always keeping an eye on the so-called reality data as a rudder that keeps the course despite the brazen and unrepentant political propaganda that does not fear neither the self-contradiction nor the explicit lie.\n\nOf that season – which should have been structured in the Global, Human and Virtual focuses – we just had time to present the special event that went beyond the focus but which for us had the symbolic flavor of a first show that ZONA K brought into Casa degli Artisti.\n\nThen everything, as for everyone, stopped. The companies were first warned, then put on stand by, and finally the shows were canceled. Suddenly our strength, our distinctive trait, our identity and consistency in design choices and consolidated international relationships have become our boomerang. How to keep up a season that would have included numerous European artists? How to reopen a space where the distancing measures force to have no more than 20 spectators? How to look beyond the obstacle to imagine and build a new reality?\n\nThe word “new” was enough to re-tune us and to start again from where we left off. If it is a new reality that we have to live, then our season can be called REALITY ?. The question mark not only closes a questioning sentence, but also summarizes the amazement, perplexity and ultimately the hope that this is not really a new world to be invented, but a phase, a parenthesis not to be archived and from which to start again.\n\nWe therefore start from the desire to find a new meaning to reality, new perspectives, new ways of enjoying culture thanks to a continuous comparison with some of the artists who have accompanied us most in recent years. Thus the new autumn season that has emerged continues the path started where possible and leaves much more space for those distinctive features that have characterized our work in past years: complex projects, urban performances, shows for a few spectators at a time, collaboration with theaters larger to accommodate artists who need the stage. The most important novelty is the desire to give more space and time to the shows in the season with, on our part, an important productive effort: many of the shows we offer are real productions and co-productions. It is a choice that was already in the making and that found a boost in the pandemic: to continue working on an annual season, but with even more our projects that are able to sustain a long life and that do not run out in the space of a few reruns.\n\nEvents:\n\n15 – 24 September 2020\n\nUNDER COVID\n\nGianmarco Maraviglia\n\ncurated by Chiara Oggioni Tiepolo\n\n[photographic exhibition]\n\nAudience survey\n\nAMID FEARS, GOOD NEWS FROM THE PUBLIC\n\nThe Theatre has been one of the main victims of the pandemic. Without belittling the very serious damage suffered by the artistic staff and the entire production chain of the performing arts, there is a positive note that, in the midst of so much discouragement, brings a certain relief: the public has felt the absence of the theatre, and is eager to return to it.\n\nThis is one of the data that emerges clearly from the questionnaire designed and disseminated by ZONA K and Stratagemmi, with the support of Codici Ricerche, between May and June 2020: a crucial period, immediately following the lockdown.\n\nThe questionnaire aimed to find out what people’s feelings and expectations were about the reopening of the theatres, which had to be imagined in a different way from the pre-Covid period; making a virtue of necessity, the creators of the survey used this opportunity for dialogue with the public to sound out questions that only partly have to do with the emergency situation of the last few months. For example: how much artistic proposals accessible via telematics are actually appreciated; what is the relationship of the public with experimental languages and forms; how much the spatial context in which the performance takes place influences the spectators’ appreciation.\n\nThe survey produced valuable and at times unpredictable results: just think of the widespread enthusiasm for open-air performances, which certainly does not find an adequate response in the seasonal programmes of our theatres. Or the evident disaffection towards remote, telematic artistic fruition: an experience that spectators are definitely satiated with.\n\nThere is also – and this bodes well – a certain confidence in theatres as regards their compliance with health and hygiene requirements in order to prevent the risk of an epidemic resurgence: the interviewees declare more impatience than fear, suggesting that for them the theatre is not only an essential meeting place, but also a safe, reliable place.\n\nIn short: the data that emerge are by no means obvious, and can help us to understand where to start again, and in what directions.\n\nCertainly, as shown by the numerous encouragements that the interviewees attached to the questionnaire, the public is there, and is cheering for the theatre.\n\nSee the results of the questionnaire\n\nFoto by Cristina Lorenzi for ZONA K, BODIES IN URBAN SPACES 2017 di Cie.

After the short century, which showed the brutality of humanity and also the ability to get involved again, what have we become? Who do we want to be?\n\nHobsbawn said that the 1900s had ended in a global disorder of an unclear nature and without a clear mechanism to end or control it. Are we facing the new twenties, with the naïve and glitzy consciousness of what is happening around us?\n\nWill the homo sapiens, well defined and described by Harari, be able to make sense of the world he created? And understand global developments and distinguish the mistake from what is correct?\n\nThese, the shows of FOCUS VIRTUAL.\n\nOctober – November\n\nRIMINI PROTOKOLL (DE)\n\nNIGHT SHIFT\n\n[Travelling show]\n\nA ZONA K production in collaboration with Casa degli Artisti\n\nc/o places in the city\n\n22 – 23 October\n\nBABILONIA TEATRI (IT)\n\nGIULIO\n\n[show]\n\nc/o ZONA K\n\n12 – 13 November\n\nM.

For the occasion, some of the artists hosted over the years and the operators and critics most sensitive to the topic will be invited.\n\nc/o ZONA K and other places in the city\n\nDiscover the entire programme of the Theatre Season 2020 REALITY\n\nPhoto ©Rocco Rorandelli / TerraProject\n\nAgrupación Señor Serrano (ES)\n\nThere is a widely diffused image that traces the history of ideas: climbing a mountain, overcoming all difficulties to reach its top and, once there, being able to see the world “as it is”. Reaching the truth and not just shadows and reflections. It is a beautiful image in all respects.\n\nBut is it really so? Often looking from above you can see nothing but clouds and fog covering everything or a landscape that changes according to the time of day or the weather. What is the world like then? How is the truth? Is there the truth? Is the truth the top of a mountain to be crowned and that’s all, or rather a cold and inhospitable path that must be continually walked?\n\nIn The Mountain, the latest show by the award-winning Catalan company, the first expedition to Everest converges, the outcome of which is still uncertain today, Orson Welles sowing panic with his radio program The War of the Worlds, badminton players who they play baseball, a fake news website, a drone scanning the audience, lots of snow, mobile screens, fragmented images, and Vladimir Putin speaking content with trust and truth.\n\nA white and diaphanous stage. Miniatures to scale on practicables, a radio studio, a reproduction of Everest, portable projection screens and film tripods form a space halfway between a TV set, a museum and a badminton court. A network of ideas, stories, images, actions and concepts is the basis of The Mountain’s dramaturgical framework. With these materials, unfolded in layers that mix, creating unexpected connections, the show presents itself as an unmapped exploration of the myth of truth.\n\n________________________\n\nA ZONA K co-production presented in collaboration with Olinda/Da vicino nessuno è normale\n\nc/o Olinda/Da vicino nessuno è normale, Ex O.P.

A resolute investigation on the border between information and propaganda, between power and crime, between reason of state and inviolable rights, which questions the apparatus of the law, violence and the profound meaning of being free citizens in a free state.\n\nGiulio Regeni is not just a news story.\n\nGiulio Regeni makes us asking ourselves what a State means. What does justice mean. What does power mean. What does the police mean? What does trial mean. What does legality mean. What does prison mean. What public opinion means. What journalism and freedom of information mean.\n\nGiulio Regeni makes us asking ourselves the fundamental questions of social and civil life.\n\nHe makes us thinking about the concept of responsibility, of humanity, of strength.\n\nThe concepts and issues we are dealing with in our lifes, literature and theatre from Greeks to Shakespeare to us. Giulio Regeni is a starting point to reflect on all this.\n\n________________________\n\nc/o ZONA K\n\nTo participate you must send a request for the annual membership within the day before the show, click HERE to do it NOW\n\nInfo: show • duration 60 min. • in Italian\n\nStandard ticket: 15 € – Students/under 26/over 65/groups 10€\n\nPart of the subscription shows\n\n________________________\n\nBy Valeria Raimondi and Enrico Castellani, cast to be decided, production: Teatro Metastasio di Prato with Babilonia Teatri\n\nBabilonia Teatri is one of the most innovative companies in the contemporary theatre scene, distinguishing itself for a language by many defined as pop, rock, punk. It has become relevant in the Italian scene for its irreverent and divergent gaze on the world of today. Over the years Babilonia Teatri has won numerous awards. In addition to the main Italian cities, the company’s shows have been hosted numerous times also abroad, from France to Germany, from Austria to Hungary, from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Croatia, from Colombia to Russia. Enrico Castellani and Valeria Raimondi, founders of the company in 2006, are the artistic directors of Babilonia Teatri. Playwrights, authors, directors and actors, Castellani and Raimondi are based in Verona.\n\nRIMINI PROTOKOLL (DE)\n\nFOCUS: HUMAN\n\nIn the 2020 Theatre Season REALITY of ZONA K the multi-award winning German collective Rimini Protokoll will bring the truck to Milan that in 2006 was transformed into an audience on wheels capable of transporting 50 spectators through the city: seated on one side, they will look through a large window the urban reality that will become a stage.\n\nDuring the residency at Casa degli Artisti, which took place between May and September 2019, five selected artists developed a project for the truck around the theme of night work together with Rimini Protokoll.\n\nThe truck will transport spectators through the suburbs of the city and will focus the spotlights on what normally moves in the dark and in the invisible. Who works at night? How? Who pays? The submerged economy or the backbone and the backstage of the most brilliant day performances? What places host the jobs that begin when others stop and the jobs that have no beginning or an end?\n\n________________________\n\nA ZONA K production in collaboration con Casa degli Artisti\n\nc/o places in the city\n\nInfo: spettacolo itinerante per 50 spectators • in Italian\n\nStandard ticket: 20 € – Students/under 26/over 65/gruppi: 15 €\n\nPart of the subscription shows\n\n________________________\n\nCredits\n\nHelgard Haug, Stefan Kaegi and Daniel Wetzel founded the theatre-label Rimini Protokoll in 2000 and have since worked in different constellations under this n"
