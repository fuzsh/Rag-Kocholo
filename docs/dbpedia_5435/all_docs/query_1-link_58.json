        "text": "3.1Chemical profile of berry fruits\n\nThe chemical composition of Sambucus nigra and Rubus spp. extracts were reported in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively. The LSD test showed that the all chemical parameters differ statistically in the various samples (P < 0.001), with exception on vitamin C content, cyanidin 3-glucoside and FRAP in elderberry fruits.\n\nTotal phenol content (TPC) was present in greater amounts in the elderberries rather than blackberries, as confirmed by Ochmian et al. [36]. In particular, in the elderberries TPC ranged from 474.43 to 701.15 mg gallic acid /100 g f.w., with a variability based on the collection area; in fact, the sample S1 and the sample S2, collected in the same region (Campania), didn’t show significant differences. However, in our study it was possible to observe significant differences also between samples grown in the same area.\n\nAkbult et al. [37] have reported a concentration of TPC in the range of 371–432 mg GAE/100 g fresh matter in Turkish S. nigra. Lee and Finn [33] evaluated the concentration of TPC in two genotypes of European elder (S. nigra) and in eight genotypes of American elder (Sambucus canadensis) throughout two growing seasons and reported a TPC value ranging from 327 to 582 mg GAE/g fresh matter with higher levels in the cultivars Adams 1 and Adams 2 (S. canadensis) and Korsør (S. nigra) in both seasons, demonstrating that the TPC is closely related to the genotype. In another study, Mandrone et al. [24] have reported substantial differences in polyphenol concentration for S. nigra grown in four different Sicilian area, with a value ranging from 1811.13 to 2743.07 mg/100 g, and these differences were attributed to the different degree of fruit’s maturity.\n\nIn the blackberry fruits TPC was characterized by high variability inter and intraspecies ranging from 234.82 to 419.99 mg gallic acid /100 g f.w. In fact, the minimum value (234.82 mg gallic acid/100 g f.w.) but also the maximum value (419.99 mg gallic acid/100 g f.w.) was found in Rubus ulmifolis. This could be attributed to the different areas of blackberries’s samples collection. Rios de Souza et al. [6] have reported a mean value of 850.52 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g for Brazilian blackberries although, it must be emphasized, that the TPC is closely related to the extraction technique used, as shown by Reátegui et al. [38], and to the degree of maturation. In this context, Rutz et al. [4] have reported that during ripening of blackberries it is possible to observe an increase in the concentration of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins and antioxidant activity. In particular, the increased amount of anthocyanins at the mature stage is due to the synthesis of these pigments during ripening. In any case, a lower values were found in wild (M3 ÷ M14) than cultivated (M1 and M2) ones as shown in the Table 1. In contrast significantly lower values of total polyphenols were recorded for wild blackberries [36].\n\nThe content of total anthocyanins (TAC) was from 198.00 to 398.20 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside/ 100 g f.w. for elderberries and from 60.66 to 195.60 mg/100 g f.w. for blackberries. The high concentration of anthocyanins in elderberry is confirmed by other studies; for example Denev et al. [39] reported a value of 1.69 g/l inelderberry and 0.45 g/l in blackberry. The elderberries’s pattern of anthocyanins was characterized by the presence of specific compounds namely cyanidin 3-sambubioside and cyanidin 3-glucoside. The other anthocyanins are cyanidin-3-sambuboside-5-glucoside, cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside, cyanidin 3-rutinoside, pelargonidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-sambubioside and delfinidine-3-rutinoside [15, 40]. As reported by Mikulic-Petkovsek et al. [19], cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside are the most abundant anthocyanins in S. nigra, and this is in line with our results. In particular, elderberries showed values ranging from 232.74 to 392.86 mg/100 g f.w. of cyanidin 3-sambubioside and from 156.70 to 334.81 mg/100 g of cyanidin 3-glucoside. Veberic et al. [41] studied the profile of two elderberry cultivars (“Rubini” and “Haschberg”) grown in Austria by an HPLC analysis by using a Gemini column C18 (150×4.6 mm 3μm, Phenomenex) and reported that the separation of cyanidin-3-sambubioside by cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5-glucososide by cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside is not possible because the retention time of these anthocyanins is identical, as also affirmed by Bermúdez-Soto and Tomás-Barberán [40]. Due to the analytical conditions used in this work, a separation of the couple cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside has been obtained. Also Mandrone et al. [24] evaluated the polyphenolic composition of elderberry species being endemic in Sicily by LC-MS analysis and separated three peaks: Cyanidin-3-sambubioside-5 glucoside, cyanidin-3-sambubioside and cyanidin-3-glucoside.\n\nIn blackberry the pattern of anthocyanins was characterized by the presence of 3-glucoside, 3-rutinoside, 3-xyloside, and 3-O-β-(6”-malonylglucoside) of cyanidin, and 5 cyanidin-3-O-β-(6”-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaroyl)-glucoside [8]. In our study, the chromatograms obtained from blackberries showed the presence of four principal peaks and only one of these was identified and attributed to cyanidin-3-glucoside, with a value ranging from 17.67 (value found for cultivated blackberry sample) to 36.06 mg/100 g f.w. (value referred to a wild berry fruit sample) (Fig. 1). Different genotypes frequently had comparable overall levels of total anthocyanins and phenolic compounds, but were characterized by a high different composition in individual profiles of compounds.\n\nThe total flavonoids were higher in elderberries than in blackberries, as confirmed in literature [36, 42] and ranged from 569.08 to 995.25 mg quercetin/100 g f.w. and from 169.27 to 682.72 mg quercetin/100 g f.w. respectively. In this latter case a lower concentration of total flavonoids was recorded for cultivated blackberry fruits with respect to wild ones. In the present study the analysis of flavonoids has focused particularly on the quantization of the glycoside rutin and aglycones quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin. The quercetin and the rutin were present only in the samples of elderberries and with a high variability intraspecies and the values of samples from different areas are not always significantly different. The values of rutin ranged from 14.44 to 43.11 mg/100 g, while the value of quercetin with from 11.88 to 74.66 mg/100 g. Quercetin was not detected in any of the blackberry samples analysed in our study; this is probably due to the presence of quercetin derivates in blackberries, as also reported in literature [2]. On the other hand, kaempferol and myricetin were present only in blackberries. Kaempferol was the predominant flavonoid and showed an high variability intraspecies and interspecies. Both the sample with the lowest and the highest concentration belonged to the species R. ulmifolius ranging from 19.57 to 444.86 mg/100 g f.w. The myricetin had high variability among samples of different species. The R. ulmifolius was characterized by the highest concentration ranging from 3.29 to 22.63 mg/100 g f.w., while the lower concentration was observed in the only one sample of R. hirtos. Different results have been reported by Jakobek and Seruga [42], who analyzing samples of R. fruticosus and S. nigra, found the presence of both kaempferol and quercetin in samples of elderberry and quercetin, but not kaempferol, in samples of blackberry fruits. In a study conducted in Georgia on cultivated blackberry fruits no quercetin and kaempferol were found, while a low concentration of myricetin was reported (about 10 mg/100 g f.w.) [43].\n\nAlso Jakobek et al. [44] analyzed the flavonoids in berries and particularly myricetin, kaempferol and quercetin. In blackberry fruits the amount of kaempferol and quercetin detected was 2.13 and 55.42 mg/kg f.w respectively, while myricetin was not present. This different result in blackberry flavonol composition could be due to similar retention times of quercetin and myricetin. In the same work, in the elderberry fruits no amount of quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol was found; it should emphasized that in our work a total quercetin obtained by the hydrolysis of glycosides has been analysed, while the data reported by Jakobek et al. [44] were referred only to quercetin in free form, without considering glycosylated quercetin.\n\nThe amounts of individual flavonols, such as kaempferol and myricetin, as well as ellagic acid were significant different between wild blackberries and common commercial cultivars, showing higher mean values for wild than commercial samples, as also reported by Milivojevic et al. [2].\n\nThe ellagic acid was present only in blackberry samples, ranging from 18.99 to 200.06 mg/100 g of product, with an high variability intraspecies and interspecies. Also Jakobek and Seruga [40] reported the presence of ellagic acid only in commercial blackberry and not in elderberry fruits, with a average value of 22.5 mg/kg of fresh weight. In any case, the lower concentrations were observed for cultivated berry fruits, belonging to R. fruticosus. Higher values of ellagic acid have been reported by Jakobek et al. [43], who compared the composition of different berries collected in Slavonia (Croatia), including S. nigra and R. fruticosus, and reported the highest concentration of ellagic acid (121 mg/kg) in blackberries and its absence in elderberry fruits.\n\nThe vitamin C levels showed no significant differences in elderberries and the values ranged from 23.98 mg/100 g to 38.75 mg/100 g f.w. Similar values of ascorbic acid were found by Akbulut et al. [37] in wild European elderberry fruits. Moreover, this nutrient compound did not differentiate all samples either in terms of location area or intra species variability (p > 0.05). In blackberries, the concentration varied from 11 mg/100 g to a maximum of 20.73 mg/100 g of product, with a higher concentration in wild blackberries. Highest values were found by Rios de Souza et al. [6] who reported a mean concentration of 52.41 mg/100 g of ascorbic acid in Brazilian blackberries. On the other hand, Veberic et al. [41] found low mean values of vitamin C for several cultivated blackberries of about 6.87 mg/100 g f.w.\n\nAntioxidant activity is generally due to bioactive photochemical compounds and is frequently associated with total polyphenols or total flavonoid concentration. Moreover, the estimation of the antioxidant activity may vary depending on the method used, so it is preferable to determine it by using at least two techniques. In this study, the antioxidant properties of the extracts were analyzed by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2-2’-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity assays. The antioxidant activity in elderberry fruits ranged from 111.00 to 203.80 mM Eq gallic acid (FRAP) and from 26.36 to 42.52% quenching (ABTS). In blackberries the antioxidant activity ranged from 40.09 to 91.69 mM Eq gallic acid (FRAP) and from 16.16 to 37.02 % quenching (ABTS). The different methods reported in the scientific literature by different studies used did not allow a good comparison among the antioxidant activities. Anyway, in our study the correlation between antioxidant activity and phenolic substances was better, though not very high, between FRAP and total polyphenols (R2 = 0.78) and total flavonoids (R2 = 0.65), than between FRAP and total anthocyanins (R2 = 0.58) as also showed by Denev et al. [39]. These latter researchers evaluated the antioxidant activity of various berry fruits with different methods (TRAP, ORAC, HORAC and NO scavenging activity). Instead, the correlation coefficient between the antioxidant activity determined by ABTS method and polyphenols, anthocyanins and total flavonoids was lower. Conversely, the antioxidant activity evaluated with FRAP method by Ozgen et al. [45] was positively correlated with the concentration of total polyphenols and anthocyanins (R2 = 0.84 and 0.85, respectively). Our different finding was due to the fact that the berries composition is characterized by a large amount of phenolic compounds, such as procyanidins, that act as antioxidants, besides anthocyanins. Moreover, the antioxidant potential of different anthocianins is determined by their structural characteristics [8]."
