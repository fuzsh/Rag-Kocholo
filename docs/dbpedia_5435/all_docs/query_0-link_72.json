        "text": "Tensionless Strings and Supersymmetric Sigma Models: Aspects of the Target Space Geometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBredthauer, Andreas\n\n2007-01-01\n\nIn this thesis, two aspects of string theory are discussed, tensionless strings and supersymmetric sigma models. The equivalent to a massless particle in string theory is a tensionless string. Even almost 30 years after it was first mentioned, it is still quite poorly understood. We discuss how tensionless strings give rise to exact solutions to supergravity and solve closed tensionless string theory in the ten dimensional maximally supersymmetric plane wave background, a contraction of AdS(5)xS(5) where tensionless strings are of great interest due to their proposed relation to higher spin gauge theory via the AdS/CFT correspondence. For a sigma model, the amount of supersymmetry on its worldsheet restricts the geometry of the target space. For N=(2,2) supersymmetry, for example, the target space has to be bi-hermitian. Recently, with generalized complex geometry, a new mathematical framework was developed that is especially suited to discuss the target space geometry of sigma models in a Hamiltonian formulation. Bi-hermitian geometry is so-called generalized Kaehler geometry but the relation is involved. We discuss various amounts of supersymmetry in phase space and show that this relation can be established by considering the equivalence between the Hamilton and Lagrange formulation of the sigma model. In the study of generalized supersymmetric sigma models, we find objects that favor a geometrical interpretation beyond generalized complex geometry.\n\nTarget space pseudoduality in supersymmetric sigma models on symmetric spaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSarisaman, Mustafa\n\nWe discuss the target space pseudoduality in supersymmetric sigma models on symmetric spaces. We first consider the case where sigma models based on real compact connected Lie groups of the same dimensionality and give examples using three dimensional models on target spaces. We show explicit construction of nonlocal conserved currents on the pseudodual manifold. We then switch the Lie group valued pseudoduality equations to Lie algebra valued ones, which leads to an infinite number of pseudoduality equations. We obtain an infinite number of conserved currents on the tangent bundle of the pseudo-dual manifold. Since pseudoduality imposes the condition that sigma models pseudodual to each other are based on symmetric spaces with opposite curvatures (i.e. dual symmetric spaces), we investigate pseudoduality transformation on the symmetric space sigma models in the third chapter. We see that there can be mixing of decomposed spaces with each other, which leads to mixings of the following expressions. We obtain the pseudodual conserved currents which are viewed as the orthonormal frame on the pullback bundle of the tangent space of G칆춮 which is the Lie group on which the pseudodual model based. Hence we obtain the mixing forms of curvature relations and one loop renormalization group beta function by means of these currents. In chapter four, we generalize the classical construction of pseudoduality transformation to supersymmetric case. We perform this both by component expansion method on manifold M and by orthonormal coframe method on manifold SO( M). The component method produces the result that pseudoduality transformation is not invertible at all points and occurs from all points on one manifold to only one point where riemann normal coordinates valid on the second manifold. Torsion of the sigma model on M must vanish while it is nonvanishing on M칆춮, and curvatures of the manifolds must be constant and the same because of anticommuting grassmann numbers. We obtain\n\nSupersymmetric black holes with lens-space topology.\n\nPubMed\n\nKunduri, Hari K; Lucietti, James\n\n2014-11-21\n\nWe present a new supersymmetric, asymptotically flat, black hole solution to five-dimensional supergravity. It is regular on and outside an event horizon of lens-space topology L(2,1). It is the first example of an asymptotically flat black hole with lens-space topology. The solution is characterized by a charge, two angular momenta, and a magnetic flux through a noncontractible disk region ending on the horizon, with one constraint relating these.\n\nSupersymmetric dS/CFT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHertog, Thomas; Tartaglino-Mazzucchelli, Gabriele; Van Riet, Thomas; Venken, Gerben\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe put forward new explicit realisations of dS/CFT that relate N = 2 supersymmetric Euclidean vector models with reversed spin-statistics in three dimensions to specific supersymmetric Vasiliev theories in four-dimensional de Sitter space. The partition function of the free supersymmetric vector model deformed by a range of low spin deformations that preserve supersymmetry appears to specify a well-defined wave function with asymptotic de Sitter boundary conditions in the bulk. In particular we find the wave function is globally peaked at undeformed de Sitter space, with a low amplitude for strong deformations. This suggests that supersymmetric de Sitter space is stable in higher-spin gravity and in particular free from ghosts. We speculate this is a limiting case of the de Sitter realizations in exotic string theories.\n\nSupersymmetric gauge theory with space-time-dependent couplings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChoi, Jaewang; Fern츾춰ndez-Melgarejo, Jos츾춸 J.; Sugimoto, Shigeki\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe study deformations of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with couplings and masses depending on space-time. The conditions to preserve part of the supersymmetry are derived and a lot of solutions of these conditions are found. The main example is the case with ISO(1,1)츾충 SO(3)츾충 SO(3) symmetry, in which couplings, as well as masses and the theta parameter, can depend on two spatial coordinates. In the case in which ISO(1,1) is enhanced to ISO(1,2), it reproduces the supersymmetric Janus configuration found by Gaiotto and Witten [J. High Energy Phys. 06, 097 (2010)]. When SO(3)츾충 SO(3) is enhanced to SO(6), it agrees with the world-volume theory of D3-branes embedded in F-theory (a background with 7-branes in type IIB string theory). We have also found the general solution of the supersymmetry conditions for the cases with ISO(1,1)츾충 SO(2)츾충 SO(4) symmetry. Cases with time-dependent couplings and/or masses are also considered.\n\nN =4 supersymmetric mechanics on curved spaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKozyrev, Nikolay; Krivonos, Sergey; Lechtenfeld, Olaf; Nersessian, Armen; Sutulin, Anton\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe present N =4 supersymmetric mechanics on n -dimensional Riemannian manifolds constructed within the Hamiltonian approach. The structure functions entering the supercharges and the Hamiltonian obey modified covariant constancy equations as well as modified Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations specified by the presence of the manifold's curvature tensor. Solutions of original Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations and related prepotentials defining N =4 superconformal mechanics in flat space can be lifted to s o (n )-invariant Riemannian manifolds. For the Hamiltonian this lift generates an additional potential term which, on spheres and (two-sheeted) hyperboloids, becomes a Higgs-oscillator potential. In particular, the sum of n copies of one-dimensional conformal mechanics results in a specific superintegrable deformation of the Higgs oscillator.\n\nTargeting the minimal supersymmetric standard model with the compact muon solenoid experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBein, Samuel Louis\n\nAn interpretation of CMS searches for evidence of supersymmetry in the context of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is given. It is found that supersymmetric particles with color charge are excluded in the mass range below about 400 GeV, but neutral and weakly-charged sparticles remain non-excluded in all mass ranges. Discussion of the non-excluded regions of the model parameter space is given, including details on the strengths and weaknesses of existing searches, and recommendations for future analysis strategies. Advancements in the modeling of events arising from quantum chromodynamics and electroweak boson production, which are major backgrounds in searches for new physics at the LHC, are also presented. These methods have been implemented as components of CMS searches for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions resulting in purely hadronic events (i.e., events with no identified leptons) at a center of momentum energy of 13 TeV. These searches, interpreted in the context of simplified models, exclude supersymmetric gluons (gluinos) up to masses of 1400 to 1600 GeV, depending on the model considered, and exclude scalar top quarks with masses up to about 800 GeV, assuming a massless lightest supersymmetric particle. A search for non-excluded supersymmetry models is also presented, which uses multivariate discriminants to isolate potential signal candidate events. The search achieves sensitivity to new physics models in background-dominated kinematic regions not typically considered by analyses, and rules out supersymmetry models that survived 7 and 8 TeV searches performed by CMS.\n\nSupersymmetric black holes and Freudenthal duality\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarrani, Alessio; Mandal, Taniya; Tripathy, Prasanta K.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nWe study the effect of Freudenthal duality on supersymmetric extremal black hole attractors in 洧눨 = 2, D = 4 ungauged supergravity. Freudenthal duality acts on the dyonic black hole charges as an anti-involution which keeps the black hole entropy and the critical points of the effective black hole potential invariant. We analyze its effect on the recently discovered distinct, mutually exclusive phases of axionic supersymmetric black holes, related to the existence of nontrivial involutory constant matrices. In particular, we consider a supersymmetric D0 - D4 - D6 black hole and we explicitly Freudenthal-map it to a supersymmetric D0 - D2 - D4 - D6 black hole. We thus show that the charge representation space of a supersymmetric D0 - D2 - D4 - D6 black hole also contains mutually exclusive domains.\n\nSupersymmetric and non-supersymmetric models without catastrophic Goldstone bosons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBraathen, Johannes; Goodsell, Mark D.; Staub, Florian\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe calculation of the Higgs mass in general renormalisable field theories has been plagued by the so-called \"Goldstone Boson Catastrophe,\" where light (would-be) Goldstone bosons give infra-red divergent loop integrals. In supersymmetric models, previous approaches included a workaround that ameliorated the problem for most, but not all, parameter space regions; while giving divergent results everywhere for non-supersymmetric models! We present an implementation of a general solution to the problem in the public code SARAH, along with new calculations of some necessary loop integrals and generic expressions. We discuss the validation of our code in the Standard Model, where we find remarkable agreement with the known results. We then show new applications in Split SUSY, the NMSSM, the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model, and the Georgi-Machacek model. In particular, we take some first steps to exploring where the habit of using tree-level mass relations in non-supersymmetric models breaks down, and show that the loop corrections usually become very large well before naive perturbativity bounds are reached.\n\nSupersymmetric symplectic quantum mechanics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nde Menezes, Miralvo B.; Fernandes, M. C. B.; Martins, Maria das Gra츾춶as R.; Santana, A. E.; Vianna, J. D. M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSymplectic Quantum Mechanics SQM considers a non-commutative algebra of functions on a phase space 칉춥 and an associated Hilbert space H칉춥 to construct a unitary representation for the Galilei group. From this unitary representation the Schr츾췄dinger equation is rewritten in phase space variables and the Wigner function can be derived without the use of the Liouville-von Neumann equation. In this article we extend the methods of supersymmetric quantum mechanics SUSYQM to SQM. With the purpose of applications in quantum systems, the factorization method of the quantum mechanical formalism is then set within supersymmetric SQM. A hierarchy of simpler hamiltonians is generated leading to new computation tools for solving the eigenvalue problem in SQM. We illustrate the results by computing the states and spectra of the problem of a charged particle in a homogeneous magnetic field as well as the corresponding Wigner function.\n\nLandscape of supersymmetric particle mass hierarchies and their signature space at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.\n\nPubMed\n\nFeldman, Daniel; Liu, Zuowei; Nath, Pran\n\n2007-12-21\n\nThe minimal supersymmetric standard model with soft breaking has a large landscape of supersymmetric particle mass hierarchies. This number is reduced significantly in well-motivated scenarios such as minimal supergravity and alternatives. We carry out an analysis of the landscape for the first four lightest particles and identify at least 16 mass patterns, and provide benchmarks for each. We study the signature space for the patterns at the CERN Large Hadron Collider by analyzing the lepton+ (jet> or =2) + missing P{T} signals with 0, 1, 2, and 3 leptons. Correlations in missing P{T} are also analyzed. It is found that even with 10 fb{-1} of data a significant discrimination among patterns emerges.\n\nAmplitudes in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory from quantum geometry of momentum space\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGorsky, A.\n\nWe discuss multiloop maximally helicity violating amplitudes in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of effective gravity in the momentum space with IR regulator branes as degrees of freedom. Kinematical invariants of external particles yield the moduli spaces of complex or Kahler structures which are the playgrounds for the Kodaira-Spencer or Kahler type gravity. We suggest fermionic representation of the loop maximally helicity violating amplitudes in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory assuming the identification of the IR regulator branes with Kodaira-Spencer fermions in the B model and Lagrangian branes in the A model. The two-easy mass box diagram ismore츽 츽췉 related to the correlator of fermionic currents on the spectral curve in the B model or hyperbolic volume in the A model and it plays the role of a building block in the whole picture. The Bern-Dixon-Smirnov-like ansatz has the interpretation as the semiclassical limit of a fermionic correlator. It is argued that fermionic representation implies a kind of integrability on the moduli spaces. We conjecture the interpretation of the reggeon degrees of freedom in terms of the open strings stretched between the IR regulator branes.츽춺츽 less\n\n洧눨 = 2 supersymmetric Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMasterov, Ivan\n\n2015-06-01\n\nWe construct an 洧눨 = 2 supersymmetric extension of the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator for distinct frequencies of oscillation. A link to a set of decoupled 洧눨 = 2 supersymmetric harmonic oscillators with alternating sign in the Hamiltonian is introduced. Symmetries of the model are discussed in detail. The investigation of a quantum counterpart of the constructed model shows that the corresponding Fock space contains negative norm states and the energy spectrum of the system is unbounded from below.\n\nSupersymmetric Casimir energy and the anomaly polynomial\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBobev, Nikolay; Bullimore, Mathew; Kim, Hee-Cheol\n\n2015-09-01\n\nWe conjecture that for superconformal field theories in even dimensions, the supersymmetric Casimir energy on a space with topology S 1 츾충 S D-1 is equal to an equivariant integral of the anomaly polynomial. The equivariant integration is defined with respect to the Cartan subalgebra of the global symmetry algebra that commutes with a given supercharge. We test our proposal extensively by computing the supersymmetric Casimir energy for large classes of superconformal field theories, with and without known Lagrangian descriptions, in two, four and six dimensions.\n\nOn supersymmetric anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski flux backgrounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGran, U.; Gutowski, J. B.; Papadopoulos, G.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe test the robustness of the conditions required for the existence of (supersymmetric) warped flux anti-de Sitter, de Sitter, and Minkowski backgrounds in supergravity theories using as examples suitable foliations of anti-de Sitter spaces. We find that there are supersymmetric de Sitter solutions in supergravity theories including maximally supersymmetric ones in 10- and 11-dimensional supergravities. Moreover, warped flux Minkowski backgrounds can admit Killing spinors which are not Killing on the Minkowski subspace and therefore cannot be put in a factorized form.\n\nDualities and Curved Space Partition Functions of Supersymmetric Theories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAgarwal, Prarit\n\nIn this dissertation we discuss some conjectured dualities in supersymmetric field theories and provide non-trivial checks for these conjectures. A quick review of supersymmetry and related topics is provided in chapter 1. In chapter 2, we develop a method to identify the so called BPS states in the Hilbert space of a supersymmetric field theory (that preserves at least two real supercharges) on a generic curved space. As an application we obtain the superconformal index (SCI) of 4d theories. The large N SCI of quiver gauge theories has been previously noticed to factorize over the set of extremal BPS mesonic operators. In chapter 3, we reformulate this factorization in terms of the zigzag paths in the dimer model associated to the quiver and extend the factorization theorem of the index to include theories obtained from D-branes probing orbifold singularities. In chapter 4, we consider the dualities in two classes of 3 dimensional theories. The first class consist of dualities of certain necklace type Chern-Simons (CS) quiver gauge theories. A non trivial check of these dualities is provided by matching their squashed sphere partition functions. The second class consists of theories whose duals are described by a collection of free fields. In such cases, due to mixing between the superconformal R-symmetry and accidental symmetries, the matching of electric and magnetic partition functions is not straightforward. We provide a prescription to rectify this mismatch. In chapter 5, we consider some the N = 1 4d theories with orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups, arising from N = 1 preserving reduction of 6d theories on a Riemann surface. This construction allows us to dual descriptions of 4d theories. Some of the dual frames have no known Lagrangian description. We check the dualities by computing the anomaly coefficients and the superconformal indices. We also give a prescription to write the index of the theory obtained by reduction of 6d theories on a three\n\nDynamics of supersymmetric chameleons\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBrax, Philippe; Davis, Anne-Christine; Sakstein, Jeremy, E-mail: Philippe.Brax@cea.fr, E-mail: A.C.Davis@damtp.cam.ac.uk, E-mail: J.A.Sakstein@damtp.cam.ac.uk\n\n2013-10-01\n\nWe investigate the cosmological dynamics of a class of supersymmetric chameleon models coupled to cold dark matter fermions. The model includes a cosmological constant in the form of a Fayet-Illiopoulos term, which emerges at late times due to the coupling of the chameleon to two charged scalars. Supergravity corrections ensure that the supersymmetric chameleons are efficiently screened in all astrophysical objects of interest, however this does not preclude the enhancement of gravity on linear cosmological scales. We solve the modified equations for the growth of cold dark matter density perturbations in closed form in the matter era. Using this, wemore츽 츽췉 go on to derive the modified linear power spectrum which is characterised by two scales, the horizon size at matter-radiation equality and at the redshift when the chameleon reaches the minimum of its effective potential. We analyse the deviations from the 칉춭CDM predictions in the linear regime. We find that there is generically a region in the model's parameter space where the model's background cosmology coincides with that of the 칉춭CDM model. Furthermore, we find that characteristic deviations from 칉춭CDM are present on the matter power spectrum providing a clear signature of supersymmetric chameleons.츽춺츽 less\n\nNeutralino dark matter in the left-right supersymmetric model\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDemir, Durmus A.; Frank, Mariana; Turan, Ismail\n\n2006-06-01\n\nWe study the neutralino sector of the left-right supersymmetric model. In addition to the possibilities available in the minimal supersymmetric model, the neutralino states can be superpartners of the U(1){sub B-L} gauge boson, the neutral SU(2){sub R} gauge boson, or of the Higgs triplets. We analyze neutralino masses and determine the parameter regions for which the lightest neutralino can be one of the new pure states. We then calculate the relic density of the dark matter for each of these states and impose the constraints coming from the {rho} parameter, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, b{yields}s{gamma}, as wellmore츽 츽췉 as general supersymmetric mass bounds. The lightest neutralino can be the bino, or the right-wino, or the neutral triplet Higgsino, all of which have different couplings to the standard model particles from the usual neutralinos. A light bino satisfies all the experimental constraints and would be the preferred dark matter candidate for light supersymmetric scalar masses, while the right-wino would be favored by intermediate supersymmetric mass scales. The neutral triplet Higgs fermion satisfies the experimental bounds only in a small region of the parameter space, for intermediate to heavy supersymmetric scalar masses.츽춺츽 less\n\nHypermultiplet gaugings and supersymmetric solutions from 11D and massive IIA supergravity on H^{(p,q)} spaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGuarino, Adolfo\n\n2018-03-01\n\nSupersymmetric {AdS}4, {AdS}2 츾충 칉춲 2 and asymptotically AdS4 black hole solutions are studied in the context of non-minimal N=2 supergravity models involving three vector multiplets (STU-model) and Abelian gaugings of the universal hypermultiplet moduli space. Such models correspond to consistent subsectors of the {SO}(p,q) and {ISO}(p,q) gauged maximal supergravities that arise from the reduction of 11D and massive IIA supergravity on {H}^{(p,q)} spaces down to four dimensions. A unified description of all the models is provided in terms of a square-root prepotential and the gauging of a duality-hidden symmetry pair of the universal hypermultiplet. Some aspects of M-theory and massive IIA holography are mentioned in passing.\n\nOne-loop tests of supersymmetric gauge theories on spheres\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMinahan, Joseph A.; Naseer, Usman\n\n2017-07-14\n\nHere, we show that a recently conjectured form for perturbative supersymmetric partition functions on spheres of general dimension d is consistent with the at space limit of 6-dimensional N = 1 super Yang-Mills. We also show that the partition functions for N = 1 8- and 9-dimensional theories are consistent with their known at space limits.\n\nWilson loops in supersymmetric gauge theories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPestun, Vasily\n\nThis thesis is devoted to several exact computations in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge field theories. In the first part of the thesis we prove conjecture due to Erickson-Semenoff-Zarembo and Drukker-Gross which relates supersymmetric circular Wilson loop operators in the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a Gaussian matrix model. We also compute the partition function and give a new matrix model formula for the expectation value of a supersymmetric circular Wilson loop operator for the pure N = 2 and the N* = 2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a four-sphere. Circular supersymmetric Wilson loops in four-dimensional N = 2 superconformal gauge theory are treated similarly. In the second part we consider supersymmetric Wilson loops of arbitrary shape restricted to a two-dimensional sphere in the four-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We show that expectation value for these Wilson loops can be exactly computed using a two-dimensional theory closely related to the topological two-dimensional Higgs-Yang-Mills theory, or two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory for the complexified gauge group.\n\nSupersymmetric oscillator in optics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChumakov, Sergey M.; Wolf, Kurt Bernardo\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe show that the supersymmetric structure (in the sense of supersymmetric quantum mechanics) appears in Helmholtz optics describing light propagation in waveguides. For the case of elliptical waveguides, with the accuracy of paraxial approximation it admits a simple physical interpretation. The supersymmetry connects light beams of different colors. The difference in light frequencies for the supersymmetric beams is determined by the transverse gradient of the refractive index. These beams have the save wavelength in the propagation direction and can form a stable interference pattern.\n\nSupersymmetrizing the Gorsky-Shifman-Yung soliton\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIreson, E.; Shifman, M.; Yung, A.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe supersymmetrize the Hopfion studied by Gorsky et al. [Phys. Rev. D 88, 045026 (2013)., 10.1103/PhysRevD.88.045026]. This soliton represents a closed semilocal vortex string in U(1) gauge theory. It carries nonzero Hopf number due to the additional winding of a phase modulus as one moves along the closed string. We study this solution in N =2 supersymmetric QED with two flavors. As a preliminary exercise, we compactify one space dimension and consider a straight vortex with periodic boundary conditions. It turns out to be 1 /2 -BPS saturated. An additional winding along the string can be introduced and it does not spoil the BPS nature of the object. Next, we consider a ringlike vortex in a non-compact space and show that the circumference of the ring L can be stabilized once the previously mentioned winding along the string is introduced. Of course, the ringlike vortex is not BPS but its energy becomes close to the BPS bound if L is large, which can be guaranteed in the case that we have a large value of the angular momentum J . Thus we arrive at the concept of asymptotically BPS-saturated solitons. BPS saturation is achieved in the limit J 칙춙눾뭭걕 .\n\nSupersymmetric extensions of K field theories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdam, C.; Queiruga, J.

Further, we study the issue of topological defect formation in these supersymmetric theories. Specifically, we find supersymmetric K field theories which support topological kinks in 1+1 dimensions as well as supersymmetric extensions of the baby Skyrme model for arbitrary nonnegative potentials in 2+1 dimensions.\n\nLikelihood analysis of supersymmetric SU(5) GUTs\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nBagnaschi, Emanuele; Costa, J. C.; Sakurai, K.; ...\n\n2017-02-16\n\nHere, we perform a likelihood analysis of the constraints from accelerator experiments and astrophysical observations on supersymmetric (SUSY) models with SU(5) boundary conditions on soft SUSY-breaking parameters at the GUT scale. The parameter space of the models studied has 7 parameters: a universal gaugino massmore츽 츽췉 $$m_{1/2}$$, distinct masses for the scalar partners of matter fermions in five- and ten-dimensional representations of SU(5), $$m_5$$ and $$m_{10}$$, and for the $$\\\\mathbf{5}$$ and $$\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar 5}$$ Higgs representations $$m_{H_u}$$ and $$m_{H_d}$$, a universal trilinear soft SUSY-breaking parameter $$A_0$$, and the ratio of Higgs vevs $$\\\\tan \\\\beta$$. In addition to previous constraints from direct sparticle searches, low-energy and flavour observables, we incorporate constraints based on preliminary results from 13 TeV LHC searches for jets + MET events and long-lived particles, as well as the latest PandaX-II and LUX searches for direct Dark Matter detection. In addition to previously-identified mechanisms for bringing the supersymmetric relic density into the range allowed by cosmology, we identify a novel $${\\\\tilde u_R}/{\\\\tilde c_R} - \\\\tilde{\\\\chi}^0_1$$ coannihilation mechanism that appears in the supersymmetric SU(5) GUT model and discuss the role of $${\\\\tilde \\\n\nTowards a supersymmetric description of the Fermi Galactic center excess\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nCahill-Rowley, M.; Gainer, J. S.; Hewett, J. L.; ...\n\n2015-02-10\n\nWe attempt to build a model that describes the Fermi galactic gamma-ray excess (FGCE) within a UV-complete Supersymmetric framework; we find this to be highly non-trivial. At the very least a successful Supersymmetric explanation must have several important ingredients in order to fit the data and satisfy other theoretical and experimental constraints. Under the assumption that a single annihilation mediator is responsible for both the observed relic density as well as the FGCE, we show that the requirements are not easily satisfied in many TeV-scale SUSY models, but can be met with some model building effort in the general NMSSMmore츽 츽췉 with ~ 10 parameters beyond the MSSM. We find that the data selects a particular region of the parameter space with a mostly singlino lightest Supersymmetric particle and a relatively light CP-odd Higgs boson that acts as the mediator for dark matter annihilation. We study the predictions for various observables within this parameter space, and find that searches for this light CP-odd state at the LHC, as well as searches for the direct detection of dark matter, are likely to be quite challenging. It is possible that a signature could be observed in the flavor sector; however, indirect detection remains the best probe of this scenario.츽춺츽 less\n\nSupersymmetric electric-magnetic duality in D =3 +3 and D =5 +5 dimensions as foundation of self-dual supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNishino, Hitoshi; Rajpoot, Subhash\n\n2016-05-01\n\nWe present electric-magnetic (EM)-duality formulations for non-Abelian gauge groups with N =1 supersymmetry in D =3 +3 and 5 +5 space-time dimensions.

The EM-duality conditions are F칉췊칉췋 I=(1 /4 !)칄춭칉췊칉췋 칊추 칊춖 칊춗 칉췉G칊추칊춖 칊춗 칉췉 I with its superpartner duality condition 칉췉A I=-칊춚A I . Upon appropriate dimensional reduction, this system generates SDSYM in D =2 +2 . This system is further generalized to D =5 +5 with the EM-duality condition F칉췊칉췋 I=(1 /8 !)칄춭칉췊칉췋 칊추1&ctdot;칊추8G칊추1&ctdot;칊추8 I with its superpartner condition 칉췉I=-칊춚I . Upon appropriate dimensional reduction, this theory also generates SDSYM in D =2 +2 . As long as we maintain Lorentz covariance, D =5 +5 dimensions seems to be the maximal space-time dimensions that generate SDSYM in D =2 +2 . Namely, EM-dual system in D =5 +5 serves as the Master Theory of all supersymmetric integrable models in dimensions 1 칙출춳D 칙출춳3 .\n\nHigh-temperature asymptotics of supersymmetric partition functions\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nArdehali, Arash Arabi\n\n2016-07-05\n\nWe study the supersymmetric partition function of 4d supersymmetric gauge theories with a U(1) R-symmetry on Euclidean S 3 츾충 S 칉 1, with S 3 the unit-radius squashed three-sphere, and 칉 the circumference of the circle. For superconformal theories, this partition function coincides (up to a Casimir energy factor) with the 4d superconformal index. The partition function can be computed exactly using the supersymmetric localization of the gauge theory path-integral. It takes the form of an elliptic hypergeometric integral, which may be viewed as a matrix-integral over the moduli space of the holonomies of the gauge fields around Smore츽 츽췉 칉 1. At high temperatures (칉 칙춙 0, corresponding to the hyperbolic limit of the elliptic hypergeometric integral) we obtain from the matrix-integral a quantum effective potential for the holonomies. The effective potential is proportional to the temperature. Therefore the high-temperature limit further localizes the matrix-integral to the locus of the minima of the potential. If the effective potential is positive semi-definite, the leading high-temperature asymptotics of the partition function is given by the formula of Di Pietro and Komargodski, and the subleading asymptotics is connected to the Coulomb branch dynamics on R 3 츾충 S 1. In theories where the effective potential is not positive semi-definite, the Di Pietro-Komargodski formula needs to be modified. In particular, this modification occurs in the SU(2) theory of Intriligator-Seiberg-Shenker, and the SO(N) theory of Brodie-Cho-Intriligator, both believed to exhibit 칙춮misleading칙춯 anomaly matchings, and both believed to yield interacting superconformal field theories with c < a. Lastly, two new simple tests for dualities between 4d supersymmetric gauge theories emerge as byproducts of our analysis.츽춺츽 less\n\nSupersymmetric string waves\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBergshoeff, E.A.; Kallosh, R.; Ortin, T.\n\n1993-06-15\n\nWe present plane-wave-type solutions of the lowest-order superstring effective action which have unbroken space-time supersymmetries. They are given by a stringy generalization of the Brinkmann metric, dialton, axion, and gauge fields. Some conspiracy between the metric and the axion field is required. The [alpha][prime] stringy corrections to the effective on-shell action, to the equations of motion (and therefore to the solutions themselves), and to the supersymmetry transformations are shown to vanish for a special class of these solutions that we call supersymmetric string waves (SSW's). In the SSW solutions, there exists a conspiracy not only between the metric and themore츽 츽췉 axion field, but also between the gauge fields and the metric, since the embedding of the spin connection in the gauge group is required.츽춺츽 less\n\nSupersymmetric k-defects\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKoehn, Michael; Trodden, Mark\n\n2016-03-03\n\nIn supersymmetric theories, topological defects can have nontrivial behaviors determined purely by whether or not supersymmetry is restored in the defect core. A well-known example of this is that some supersymmetric cosmic strings are automatically superconducting, leading to important cosmological effects and constraints. We investigate the impact of nontrivial kinetic interactions, present in a number of particle physics models of interest in cosmology, on the relationship between supersymmetry and supercurrents on strings. Furthermore, we find that in some cases it is possible for superconductivity to be disrupted by the extra interactions.\n\nParallel software for lattice N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchaich, David; DeGrand, Thomas\n\n2015-05-01\n\nWe present new parallel software, SUSY LATTICE, for lattice studies of four-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(N). The lattice action is constructed to exactly preserve a single supersymmetry charge at non-zero lattice spacing, up to additional potential terms included to stabilize numerical simulations. The software evolved from the MILC code for lattice QCD, and retains a similar large-scale framework despite the different target theory. Many routines are adapted from an existing serial code (Catterall and Joseph, 2012), which SUSY LATTICE supersedes. This paper provides an overview of the new parallel software, summarizing the lattice system, describing the applications that are currently provided and explaining their basic workflow for non-experts in lattice gauge theory. We discuss the parallel performance of the code, and highlight some notable aspects of the documentation for those interested in contributing to its future development.\n\nChaos and random matrices in supersymmetric SYK\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHunter-Jones, Nicholas; Liu, Junyu\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe use random matrix theory to explore late-time chaos in supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems. Motivated by the recent study of supersymmetric SYK models and their random matrix classification, we consider the Wishart-Laguerre unitary ensemble and compute the spectral form factors and frame potentials to quantify chaos and randomness. Compared to the Gaussian ensembles, we observe the absence of a dip regime in the form factor and a slower approach to Haar-random dynamics. We find agreement between our random matrix analysis and predictions from the supersymmetric SYK model, and discuss the implications for supersymmetric chaotic systems.\n\nSupersymmetric M3-branes and G2 manifolds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCveti츿춠, M.; Gibbons, G. W.; L츾췊, H.; Pope, C. N.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nWe obtain a generalisation of the original complete Ricci-flat metric of G2 holonomy on R4츾충S 3 to a family with a nontrivial parameter 칉췉. For generic 칉췉 the solution is singular, but it is regular when 칉췉={-1,0,+1}. The case 칉췉=0 corresponds to the original G2 metric, and 칉췉={-1,1} are related to this by an S3 automorphism of the SU(2) 3 isometry group that acts on the S3츾충 S3 principal orbits. We then construct explicit supersymmetric M3-brane solutions in D=11 supergravity, where the transverse space is a deformation of this class of G2 metrics. These are solutions of a system of first-order differential equations coming from a superpotential. We also find M3-branes in the deformed backgrounds of new G2 holonomy metrics that include one found by A. Brandhuber, J. Gomis, S. Gubser and S. Gukov, and show that they also are supersymmetric.\n\nUltraviolet divergences in non-renormalizable supersymmetric theories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmilga, A.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nWe present a pedagogical review of our current understanding of the ultraviolet structure of N = (1,1) 6D supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and of N = 8 4 D supergravity. These theories are not renormalizable, they involve power ultraviolet divergences and, in all probability, an infinite set of higherdimensional counterterms that contribute to on-mass-shell scattering amplitudes. A specific feature of supersymmetric theories (especially, of extended supersymmetric theories) is that these counterterms may not be invariant off shell under the full set of supersymmetry transformations. The lowest-dimensional nontrivial counterterm is supersymmetric on shell. Still higher counterterms may lose even the on-shell invariance. On the other hand, the full effective Lagrangian, generating the amplitudes and representing an infinite sum of counterterms, still enjoys the complete symmetry of original theory. We also discuss simple supersymmetric quantum-mechanical models that exhibit the same behaviour.\n\nRequired experimental accuracy to select between supersymmetrical models\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrellscheid, David\n\n2004-03-01\n\nWe will present a method to decide a priori whether various supersymmetrical scenarios can be distinguished based on sparticle mass data alone. For each model, a scan over all free SUSY breaking parameters reveals the extent of that model's physically allowed region of sparticle-mass-space. Based on the geometrical configuration of these regions in mass-space, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the required accuracy of future sparticle mass measurements to distinguish between the models. We will illustrate this algorithm with an example. This talk is based on work done in collaboration with B C Allanach (LAPTH, Annecy) and F Quevedo (DAMTP, Cambridge).\n\nThe supersymmetric method in random matrix theory and applications to QCD\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVerbaarschot, Jacobus\n\n2004-12-01\n\nThe supersymmetric method is a powerful method for the nonperturbative evaluation of quenched averages in disordered systems. Among others, this method has been applied to the statistical theory of S-matrix fluctuations, the theory of universal conductance fluctuations and the microscopic spectral density of the QCD Dirac operator. We start this series of lectures with a general review of Random Matrix Theory and the statistical theory of spectra. An elementary introduction of the supersymmetric method in Random Matrix Theory is given in the second and third lecture. We will show that a Random Matrix Theory can be rewritten as an integral over a supermanifold. This integral will be worked out in detail for the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble that describes level correlations in systems with broken time-reversal invariance. We especially emphasize the role of symmetries. As a second example of the application of the supersymmetric method we discuss the calculation of the microscopic spectral density of the QCD Dirac operator. This is the eigenvalue density near zero on the scale of the average level spacing which is known to be given by chiral Random Matrix Theory. Also in this case we use symmetry considerations to rewrite the generating function for the resolvent as an integral over a supermanifold. The main topic of the second last lecture is the recent developments on the relation between the supersymmetric partition function and integrable hierarchies (in our case the Toda lattice hierarchy). We will show that this relation is an efficient way to calculate superintegrals. Several examples that were given in previous lectures will be worked out by means of this new method. Finally, we will discuss the quenched QCD Dirac spectrum at nonzero chemical potential. Because of the nonhermiticity of the Dirac operator the usual supersymmetric method has not been successful in this case. However, we will show that the supersymmetric partition function can be evaluated by means\n\nSupersymmetric flaxion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEma, Yohei; Hagihara, Daisuke; Hamaguchi, Koichi; Moroi, Takeo; Nakayama, Kazunori\n\n2018-04-01\n\nRecently, a new minimal extension of the Standard Model has been proposed, where a spontaneously broken, flavor-dependent global U(1) symmetry is introduced. It not only explains the hierarchical flavor structure in the quark and lepton sector, but also solves the strong CP problem by identifying the Nambu-Goldstone boson as the QCD axion, which we call flaxion. In this work, we consider supersymmetric extensions of the flaxion scenario. We study the CP and flavor violations due to supersymmetric particles, the effects of R-parity violations, the cosmological gravitino and axino problems, and the cosmological evolution of the scalar partner of the flaxion, sflaxion. We also propose an attractor-like inflationary model where the flaxion multiplet contains the inflaton field, and show that a consistent cosmological scenario can be obtained, including inflation, leptogenesis, and dark matter.\n\nSupersymmetric Galileons\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKhoury, Justin; Lehners, Jean -Luc; Ovrut, Burt A.\n\n2011-08-15\n\nGalileon theories are of considerable interest since they allow for stable violations of the null energy condition. Since such violations could have occurred during a high-energy regime in the history of our universe, we are motivated to study supersymmetric extensions of these theories. This is carried out in this paper, where we construct generic classes of N = 1 supersymmetric Galileon Lagrangians. They are shown to admit non-equivalent stress-energy tensors and, hence, vacua manifesting differing conditions for violating the null energy condition. The temporal and spatial fluctuations of all component fields of the supermultiplet are analyzed and shown to bemore츽 츽췉 stable on a large number of such backgrounds. In the process, we uncover a surprising connection between conformal Galileon and ghost condensate theories, allowing for a deeper understanding of both types of theories.츽춺츽 less\n\nSpace-based infrared sensors of space target imaging effect analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDai, Huayu; Zhang, Yasheng; Zhou, Haijun; Zhao, Shuang\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTarget identification problem is one of the core problem of ballistic missile defense system, infrared imaging simulation is an important means of target detection and recognition. This paper first established the space-based infrared sensors ballistic target imaging model of point source on the planet's atmosphere; then from two aspects of space-based sensors camera parameters and target characteristics simulated atmosphere ballistic target of infrared imaging effect, analyzed the camera line of sight jitter, camera system noise and different imaging effects of wave on the target.\n\nSupersymmetric Gauge Theories with Decoupled Operators and Chiral Ring Stability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBenvenuti, Sergio; Giacomelli, Simone\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe propose a general way to complete supersymmetric theories with operators below the unitarity bound, adding gauge-singlet fields that enforce the decoupling of such operators. This makes it possible to perform all usual computations, and to compactify on a circle. We concentrate on a duality between an N =1 SU(2) gauge theory and the N =2 A3 Argyres-Douglas theory, mapping the moduli space and chiral ring of the completed N =1 theory to those of the A3 model. We reduce the completed gauge theory to 3D, finding a 3D duality with N =4 supersymmetric QED (SQED) with two flavors. The naive dimensional reduction is instead N =2 SQED. Crucial is a concept of chiral ring stability, which modifies the superpotential and allows for a 3D emergent global symmetry.\n\nAnalysis of Ward identities in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAli, Sajid; Bergner, Georg; Gerber, Henning; Montvay, Istvan; M츾췊nster, Gernot; Piemonte, Stefano; Scior, Philipp\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn numerical investigations of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a lattice, the supersymmetric Ward identities are valuable for finding the critical value of the hopping parameter and for examining the size of supersymmetry breaking by the lattice discretisation. In this article we present an improved method for the numerical analysis of supersymmetric Ward identities, which takes into account the correlations between the various observables involved. We present the first complete analysis of supersymmetric Ward identities in N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(3). The results indicate that lattice artefacts scale to zero as O(a^2) towards the continuum limit in agreement with theoretical expectations.\n\nOn low-energy effective action in three-dimensional = 2 and = 4 supersymmetric electrodynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBuchbinder, I.

B.\n\n2013-11-01\n\nWe discuss general structure of low-energy effective actions in = 2 and = 4 three-dimensional supersymmetric electrodynamics (SQED) in gauge superfield sector. There are specific terms in the effective action having no four-dimensional analogs. Some of these terms are responsible for the moduli space metric in the Coulomb branch of the theory. We find two-loop quantum corrections to the moduli space metric in the = 2 SQED and show that in the = 4 SQED the moduli space does not receive two-loop quantum corrections.\n\nTsirelson's bound and supersymmetric entangled states\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBorsten, L.; Br츾춰dler, K.; Duff, M. J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA superqubit, belonging to a (2|1)-dimensional super-Hilbert space, constitutes the minimal supersymmetric extension of the conventional qubit. In order to see whether superqubits are more non-local than ordinary qubits, we construct a class of two-superqubit entangled states as a non-local resource in the CHSH game. Since super Hilbert space amplitudes are Grassmann numbers, the result depends on how we extract real probabilities and we examine three choices of map: (1) DeWitt (2) Trigonometric and (3) Modified Rogers. In cases (1) and (2), the winning probability reaches the Tsirelson bound pwin=cos2칊/8칙출춖0.8536 of standard quantum mechanics. Case (3) crosses Tsirelson's bound with pwin칙출춖0.9265. Although all states used in the game involve probabilities lying between 0 and 1, case (3) permits other changes of basis inducing negative transition probabilities.

The operators involved are supersymmetric codimension-two defects in an auxiliary Z_n gauge theory coupled to n copies of the SCFT. We compute the exact expectation values of such operators using localization, and compare the results to the supersymmetric R츾춸nyi entropy. The agreement between the two implies a relationship between the partition function on a squashed sphere and the one on a round sphere in the presence of defects.\n\nZero-point angular momentum of supersymmetric Penning trap\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Jian-zu; Xu, Qiang\n\n2000-10-01\n\nThe quantum behavior of supersymmetric Penning trap, specially the superpartner of its angular momentum, is investigated in the formulation of multi-dimensional semiunitary transformation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In the limit case of vanishing kinetic energy it is found that its lowest angular momentum is 3칙춗춢/2, which provides a possibility of directly checking the idea of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and thus suggests a possible experimental verification about this prediction.\n\nB-branes and supersymmetric quivers in 2d\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClosset, Cyril; Guo, Jirui; Sharpe, Eric\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe study 2d N = (0, 2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories that describe the low-energy dynamics of D1-branes at Calabi-Yau fourfold (CY4) singularities. On general grounds, the holomorphic sector of these theories 칙춦 matter content and (classical) superpotential interactions 칙춦 should be fully captured by the topological B-model on the CY4. By studying a number of examples, we confirm this expectation and flesh out the dictionary between B-brane category and supersymmetric quiver: the matter content of the supersymmetric quiver is encoded in morphisms between B-branes (that is, Ext groups of coherent sheaves), while the superpotential interactions are encoded in the A 칙춛 algebra satisfied by the morphisms. This provides us with a derivation of the supersymmetric quiver directly from the CY4 geometry. We also suggest a relation between triality of N = (0 ,2) gauge theories and certain mutations of exceptional collections of sheaves. 0d N = 1 supersymmetric quivers, corresponding to D-instantons probing CY5 singularities, can be discussed similarly.\n\nBosonized Supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera Equations: Symmetries and Exact Solutions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Ping; Zeng, Bao-Qing; Liu, Li-Ming\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe Bosonized Supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera (BSSK) system is constructed by applying bosonization method to a Supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera system in this paper. The symmetries on the BSSK equations are researched and the calculation shows that the BSSK equations are invariant under the scaling transformations, the space-time translations and Galilean boosts. The one-parameter invariant subgroups and the corresponding invariant solutions are researched for the BSSK equations. Four types of reduction equations and similarity solutions are proposed.

This article proposes a class of models of supersymmetric composite dark matter where the interactions with the Standard Model communicate supersymmetry breaking to the dark sector. In these models, supersymmetry breaking can be treated as a perturbation on the spectrum of bound states. Using a general formalism, the spectrum with leading supersymmetry effects is computed without specifying the details of the binding dynamics. The interactions of the composite states with the Standard Model are computed, and several benchmarkmore츽 츽췉 models are described.

Up to local conformal isometry, we classify the maximally supersymmetric backgrounds, determine their conformal symmetry superalgebras and show how they arise as near-horizon geometries of certain half-BPS backgrounds or as a plane-wave limit thereof. We then show how to define Yang-Mills theory with rigid supersymmetry on any supersymmetric conformal supergravity background and, in particular, on the maximally supersymmetric backgrounds. We conclude by commenting on a striking resemblance between the supersymmetric backgrounds of ten-dimensional conformal supergravity and those of eleven-dimensional Poincar츾춸 supergravity.\n\nOn supersymmetric AdS6 solutions in 10 and 11 dimensions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGutowski, J.; Papadopoulos, G.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe prove a non-existence theorem for smooth, supersymmetric, warped AdS 6 solutions with connected, compact without boundary internal space in D = 11 and (massive) IIA supergravities. In IIB supergravity we show that if such AdS 6 solutions exist, then the NSNS and RR 3-form fluxes must be linearly independent and certain spinor bilinears must be appropriately restricted. Moreover we demonstrate that the internal space admits an so(3) action which leaves all the fields invariant and for smooth solutions the principal orbits must have co-dimension two. We also describe the topology and geometry of internal spaces that admit such a so(3) action and show that there are no solutions for which the internal space has topology F 츾충 S 2, where F is an oriented surface.\n\nA supersymmetric SYK-like tensor model\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPeng, Cheng; Spradlin, Marcus; Volovich, Anastasia\n\n2017-05-11\n\nWe consider a supersymmetric SYK-like model without quenched disorder that is built by coupling two kinds of fermionic 칉춯 = 1 tensor-valued superfields, ''quarks'' and ''mesons''. We prove that the model has a well-defined large-N limit in which the (s)quark 2-point functions are dominated by mesonic ''melon'' diagrams. We sum these diagrams to obtain the Schwinger-Dyson equations and show that in the IR, the solution agrees with that of the supersymmetric SYK model.\n\nSupersymmetric relics from the big bang\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nEllis, John; Hagelin, J.

Circumstantial evidence points to a neutral gauge/Higgs fermion as the best candidate for this particle, and we derive bounds on the parameters in the lagrangian which govern its mass and couplings. One favored possibility is that the lightest neutral supersymmetric particle is predominantly a photino ~칉췁 with mass above 12 GeV, while another is that the lightest neutral supersymmetric particle is a Higgs fermion with mass above 5 GeV or less than O(100) eV. We also point out that a gravitino mass of 10more츽 츽췉 to 100 GeV implies that the temperature after completion of an inflationary phase cannot be above 10 14 GeV, and probably not above 3 츾충 10 12 GeV. Finally, this imposes constraints on mechanisms for generating the baryon number of the universe.츽춺츽 less\n\nSupersymmetric Dark Matter and Prospects for its Detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYamamoto, Takahiro\n\nDark matter is a prominent and dominant form of matter in the Universe. Yet, despite various intense efforts, its nongravitational effects have not been observed. In this dissertation, we explore the nature of such elusive particles within a supersymmetric SU(3)C 칙춝충 SU(2)L 칙춝충 U(1)Y gauge theory. Although large regions of parameter space within supersymmetric models have been excluded by recent results from collider experiments and direct and indirect dark matter searches, we find that there is a wide range of viable parameter space once the requirements of minimal flavor violation and mass universality are relaxed. In particular, we focus on a class of models in which electroweak-scale Majorana dark matter has interactions with the Standard Model sector via relatively light charged scalars with large chiral mixing and CP-violation. Our model is shown to lead to enhanced dark matter pair annihilation, and is constrained by precise measurements of the lepton dipole moments. We illustrate that our model satisfies all constraints, including the observed thermal relic density, and investigate prospects for the detection of dark matter annihilation products. We also examine the effects of chiral mixing and CP-violationn on the variation in the ratio of the flux of monoenergetic photons from annihilation to two photons relative to that from annihilation to a photon and a Z boson, as well as the helicity asymmetry in the diphoton final state. We also find the most general spectrum for internal bremsstrahlung, which interpolates between the regimes dominated by virtual internal bremsstrahlung and by final state radiation, and that it provides distinctive gamma-ray signals, which could potentially be observed in the near future.\n\nSupersymmetric leptogenesis with a light hidden sector\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Simone, Andrea; Garny, Mathias; Ibarra, Alejandro; Weniger, Christoph\n\n2010-07-01\n\nSupersymmetric scenarios incorporating thermal leptogenesis as the origin of the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry generically predict abundances of the primordial elements which are in conflict with observations. In this paper we propose a simple way to circumvent this tension and accommodate naturally thermal leptogenesis and primordial nucleosynthesis. We postulate the existence of a light hidden sector, coupled very weakly to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which opens up new decay channels for the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, thus diluting its abundance during nucleosynthesis. We present a general model-independent analysis of this mechanism as well as two concrete realizations, and describe the relevant cosmological and astrophysical bounds and implications for this dark matter scenario. Possible experimental signatures at colliders and in cosmic-ray observations are also discussed.\n\nModeling and validation of photometric characteristics of space targets oriented to space-based observation.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Hongyuan; Zhang, Wei; Dong, Aotuo\n\n2012-11-10\n\nA modeling and validation method of photometric characteristics of the space target was presented in order to track and identify different satellites effectively. The background radiation characteristics models of the target were built based on blackbody radiation theory. The geometry characteristics of the target were illustrated by the surface equations based on its body coordinate system. The material characteristics of the target surface were described by a bidirectional reflectance distribution function model, which considers the character of surface Gauss statistics and microscale self-shadow and is obtained by measurement and modeling in advance. The contributing surfaces of the target to observation system were determined by coordinate transformation according to the relative position of the space-based target, the background radiation sources, and the observation platform. Then a mathematical model on photometric characteristics of the space target was built by summing reflection components of all the surfaces. Photometric characteristics simulation of the space-based target was achieved according to its given geometrical dimensions, physical parameters, and orbital parameters. Experimental validation was made based on the scale model of the satellite. The calculated results fit well with the measured results, which indicates the modeling method of photometric characteristics of the space target is correct.\n\nSupersymmetric Q-balls: A numerical study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCampanelli, L.; Ruggieri, M.\n\n2008-02-01\n\nWe study numerically a class of nontopological solitons, the Q-balls, arising in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model with low-energy, gauge-mediated symmetry breaking. Taking into account the exact form of the supersymmetric potential giving rise to Q-balls, we find that there is a lower limit on the value of the charge Q in order to make them classically stable: Q칙출췁5츾충102Qcr, where Qcr is constant depending on the parameters defining the potential and can be in the range 1칙출쐼cr칙출108츾췅16.

Finally, we find that energy and radius of Q-balls can be parametrized as E칆춮칉쬔Q3/4 and R칆춮칉RQ1/4, where 칉쬔 and 칉R are slowly varying functions of the charge.\n\nVacuum fluctuations of the supersymmetric field in curved background\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBili츿춚, Neven; Domazet, Silvije; Guberina, Branko\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe study a supersymmetric model in curved background spacetime.

A soft supersymmetry breaking induces a nonzero contribution to the vacuum energy density and pressure. Assuming the presence of a cosmic fluid in addition to the vacuum fluctuations of the supersymmetric field an effective equation of state is derived in a self-consistent approach at one loop order. The net effect of the vacuum fluctuations of the supersymmetric fields in the leading adiabatic order is a renormalization of the Newton and cosmological constants.\n\nLocalization of Gauge Theory on a Four-Sphere and Supersymmetric Wilson Loops\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPestun, Vasily\n\n2012-07-01\n\nWe prove conjecture due to Erickson-Semenoff-Zarembo and Drukker-Gross which relates supersymmetric circular Wilson loop operators in the {N=4} supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with a Gaussian matrix model. We also compute the partition function and give a new matrix model formula for the expectation value of a supersymmetric circular Wilson loop operator for the pure {N=2} and the {N=2^*} supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a four-sphere. A four-dimensional {N=2} superconformal gauge theory is treated similarly.\n\nSupersymmetric asymptotic safety is not guaranteed\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nIntriligator, Kenneth; Sannino, Francesco\n\n2015-11-05\n\nIt was recently shown that certain perturbatively accessible, non-supersymmetric gauge-Yukawa theories have UV asymptotic safety, without asymptotic freedom: the UV theory is an interacting RG fixed point, and the IR theory is free. We here investigate the possibility of asymptotic safety in supersymmetric theories, and use unitarity bounds, and the a-theorem, to rule it out in broad classes of theories. The arguments apply without assuming perturbation theory. Therefore, the UV completion of a non-asymptotically free susy theory must have additional, non-obvious degrees of freedom, such as those of an asymptotically free (perhaps magnetic dual) extension.\n\nHeterotic flux tubes in N=2 supersymmetric QCD with N=1 preserving deformations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShifman, M.; Yung, A.; Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, Gatchina, St. Petersburg 188300\n\n2008-06-15\n\nWe consider non-Abelian Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield-saturated flux tubes (strings) in N=2 supersymmetric QCD deformed by superpotential terms of a special type breaking N=2 supersymmetry down to N=1. Previously it was believed that world sheet supersymmetry is accidentally enhanced due to the facts that N=(1,1) supersymmetry is automatically elevated up to N=(2,2) on CP(N-1) and, at the same time, there are no N=(0,2) generalizations of the bosonic CP(N-1) model. Edalati and Tong noted that the target space is in fact CP(N-1)xC rather than CP(N-1). This allowed them to suggest a heterotic N=(0,2) sigma model, with the CP(N-1) target space for bosonic fields andmore츽 츽췉 an extra right-handed fermion which couples to the fermion fields of the N=(2,2) CP(N-1) model. We derive the heterotic N=(0,2) world sheet model directly from the bulk theory. The relation between the bulk and world sheet deformation parameters we obtain does not coincide with that suggested by Edalati and Tong at large values of the deformation parameter. For polynomial deformation superpotentials in the bulk we find nonpolynomial response in the world sheet model. We find a geometric representation for the heterotic model. Supersymmetry is proven to be spontaneously broken for small deformations (at the quantum level). This confirms Tong's conjecture. A proof valid for large deformations will be presented in the subsequent publication.츽춺츽 less\n\nQuantum spectral curve of the N=6 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavagli츾 , Andrea; Fioravanti, Davide; Gromov, Nikolay; Tateo, Roberto\n\n2014-07-11\n\nRecently, it was shown that the spectrum of anomalous dimensions and other important observables in planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are encoded into a simple nonlinear Riemann-Hilbert problem: the P칉췊 system or quantum spectral curve. In this Letter, we extend this formulation to the N=6 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory introduced by Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena. This may be an important step towards the exact determination of the interpolating function h(칉췉) characterizing the integrability of this model. We also discuss a surprising relation between the quantum spectral curves for the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and the N=6 supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory considered here.\n\nOn the stability of non-supersymmetric supergravity solutions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nImaanpur, Ali; Zameni, Razieh\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe examine the stability of some non-supersymmetric supergravity solutions that have been found recently. The first solution is AdS5 츾충M6, for M6 an stretched CP3. We consider breathing and squashing mode deformations of the metric, and find that the solution is stable against small fluctuations of this kind. Next we consider type IIB solution of AdS2 츾충M8, where the compact space is a U (1) bundle over N (1 , 1). We study its stability under the deformation of M8 and the 5-form flux. In this case we also find that the solution is stable under small fluctuation modes of the corresponding deformations.\n\nDescription of the heterotic string solutions in U(N) supersymmetric QCD\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBolokhov, P. A.; Theoretical Physics Department, St. Petersburg State University, Ulyanovskaya 1, Peterhof, St. Petersburg, 198504; Shifman, M.\n\n2009-04-15\n\nWe continue the study of heterotic non-Abelian Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield-saturated flux tubes (strings). Previously, such solutions were obtained [M. Shifman and A. Yung, Phys. Rev. D 77, 125016 (2008).] in a particular U(2) gauge theory: N=2 supersymmetric QCD deformed by superpotential terms of a special type breaking N=2 supersymmetry down to N=1. Here we generalize the previous results to U(N) gauge theories. As was suggested by Edalati and Tong [M. Edalati and D. Tong, J. High Energy Phys. 05 (2007) 005.], the string world-sheet theory is a heterotic N=(0,2) sigma model, with the CP(N-1) target space for bosonic fields and an extramore츽 츽췉 right-handed fermion which couples to the fermion fields of the N=(2,2) CP(N-1) model. We derive the heterotic N=(0,2) world-sheet model directly from the U(N) bulk theory. Parameters of the bulk theory are related to those of the world-sheet theory. Qualitatively this relation turns out to be the same as in the U(2) case.츽춺츽 less\n\nAn object oriented code for simulating supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCatterall, Simon; Joseph, Anosh\n\n2012-06-01\n\nWe present SUSY_LATTICE - a C++ program that can be used to simulate certain classes of supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theories, including the well known N=4 SYM in four dimensions, on a flat Euclidean space-time lattice. Discretization of SYM theories is an old problem in lattice field theory. It has resisted solution until recently when new ideas drawn from orbifold constructions and topological field theories have been brought to bear on the question. The result has been the creation of a new class of lattice gauge theories in which the lattice action is invariant under one or more supersymmetries. The resultant theories are local, free of doublers and also possess exact gauge-invariance. In principle they form the basis for a truly non-perturbative definition of the continuum SYM theories. In the continuum limit they reproduce versions of the SYM theories formulated in terms of twisted fields, which on a flat space-time is just a change of the field variables. In this paper, we briefly review these ideas and then go on to provide the details of the C++ code. We sketch the design of the code, with particular emphasis being placed on SYM theories with N=(2,2) in two dimensions and N=4 in three and four dimensions, making one-to-one comparisons between the essential components of the SYM theories and their corresponding counterparts appearing in the simulation code. The code may be used to compute several quantities associated with the SYM theories such as the Polyakov loop, mean energy, and the width of the scalar eigenvalue distributions.

In this model, supersymmetry is broken by gravity and extra gauge interaction effects, providing a spectrum similar in several aspects to that in natural supersymmetric scenarios. Having the first two generations of sparticles partially decoupled means that any significant signal can only involve gauginos and the third family of sfermions. In practice, the signals are dominated by gluino production with subsequent decays into the stop sector. As we show, for gluino masses below 2300 GeV, a discovery at the LHC is possible at s=14TeV, but will require large integrated luminosities.\n\nSolution of second order supersymmetrical intertwining relations in Minkowski plane\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nIoffe, M.

For intertwining operators (supercharges) of second order in derivatives, the intertwined Hamiltonians correspond to completely integrable systems with the symmetry operators of fourth order in momenta. In terms of components, the intertwining relations correspond to the system of nonlinear differential equations which are solvable with the simplest칙춦constant칙춦ansatzes for the 칙춮metric칙춯 matrix in second order part of the supercharges. The corresponding potentials are built explicitly both for diagonalizable and nondiagonalizable form of 칙춮metric칙춯 matrices, and their properties are discussed.\n\nOn the supersymmetrization of Galileon theories in four dimensions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nElvang, Henriette; Hadjiantonis, Marios; Jones, Callum R.

Our results are that (1) the quartic Galileon has a supersymmetrization compatible with Galileon shift symmetry (칊춧 칙춙 칊춧 + c +b칉췊x칉췊) for the scalar sector and a constant shift symmetry (칊춛 칙춙 칊춛 + 칉) for the fermion sector, and it is unique at least at 6th order in fields, but possibly not beyond; (2) the enhanced \"special Galileon\" symmetry is incompatible with supersymmetry; (3) there exists a quintic Galileon with a complex scalar preserving Galileon shift symmetry; (4) one cannot supersymmetrize the cubic and quintic Galileon while preserving the Galileon shift symmetry for the complex scalar; and (5) for the quartic and quintic Galileon, we present evidence for a supersymmetrization in which the real Galileon scalar is partnered with an R-axion to form a complex scalar which only has an ordinary shift symmetry.\n\nSupersymmetric dark matter above the W mass\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGriest, Kim; Kamionkowski, Marc; Turner, Michael S.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe cosmological consequences are studied for the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model in the case that the neutralino is heavier than W. The cross section was calculated for annihilation of heavy neutralinos into final states containing gauge and Higgs bosons (XX yields WW, ZZ, HH, HW, HZ), where X is the lightest, nth neutralino and the results are compared with the results with those previously obtained for annihilation into fermions to find the relic cosmological abundance for the most general neutralino. The new channels are particularly important for the Higgsino-like and mixed-state neutralinos, but are sub-dominant (to the fermion-antifermion annihilation channels) in the case that the neutralino is mostly a gaugino. The effect of the top quark mass is also considered. Using these cross sections and the cosmological constraint omega(sub X)h squared is less than or approximately 1, the entire range of cosmologically acceptable supersymmetric parameter space is mapped and a very general bound on the neutralino mass is discovered. For a top quark mass of less than 180 GeV, neutralinos heavier than 3200 GeV are cosmologically inconsistent, and if the top quark mass is less than 120 GeV, the bound is lowered to 2600 GeV. Neutralino states that are mostly gaugino are constrained to be lighter than 550 GeV. It is found that a heavy neutralino that contributes omega(sub X) is approximately 1 arises for a very wide range of model parameters and makes, therefore, a very natural and attractive dark matter candidate.\n\nSpace moving target detection using time domain feature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Min; Chen, Jin-yong; Gao, Feng; Zhao, Jin-yu\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe traditional space target detection methods mainly use the spatial characteristics of the star map to detect the targets, which can not make full use of the time domain information. This paper presents a new space moving target detection method based on time domain features. We firstly construct the time spectral data of star map, then analyze the time domain features of the main objects (target, stars and the background) in star maps, finally detect the moving targets using single pulse feature of the time domain signal. The real star map target detection experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the trajectory of moving targets in the star map sequence, and the detection probability achieves 99% when the false alarm rate is about 8츾충10-5, which outperforms those of compared algorithms.\n\nN = 1 supersymmetric indices and the four-dimensional A-model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nClosset, Cyril; Kim, Heeyeon; Willett, Brian\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe compute the supersymmetric partition function of N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with an R-symmetry on M_4\\\\cong M_{g,p}츾충 {S}^1 , a principal elliptic fiber bundle of degree p over a genus- g Riemann surface, 칉춲 g . Equivalently, we compute the generalized supersymmetric index I_{M}{_{g,p}, with the supersymmetric three-manifold M_{g,p} as the spatial slice. The ordinary N = 1 supersymmetric index on the round three-sphere is recovered as a special case. We approach this computation from the point of view of a topological A-model for the abelianized gauge fields on the base 칉춲 g . This A-model 칙춦 or A-twisted two-dimensional N = (2 , 2) gauge theory 칙춦 encodes all the information about the generalized indices, which are viewed as expectations values of some canonically-defined surface defects wrapped on T 2 inside 칉춲 g 츾충 T 2. Being defined by compactification on the torus, the A-model also enjoys natural modular properties, governed by the four-dimensional 't Hooft anomalies. As an application of our results, we provide new tests of Seiberg duality. We also present a new evaluation formula for the three-sphere index as a sum over two-dimensional vacua.\n\nSupersymmetric Q-balls: A numerical study\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCampanelli, L.; INFN--Sezione di Ferrara, I-44100 Ferrara; Ruggieri, M.\n\n2008-02-15\n\nWe study numerically a class of nontopological solitons, the Q-balls, arising in a supersymmetric extension of the standard model with low-energy, gauge-mediated symmetry breaking. Taking into account the exact form of the supersymmetric potential giving rise to Q-balls, we find that there is a lower limit on the value of the charge Q in order to make them classically stable: Q > or approx. 5x10{sup 2}Q{sub cr}, where Q{sub cr} is constant depending on the parameters defining the potential and can be in the range 1 < or approx. Q{sub cr} < or approx. 10{sup 8} {sup divide} {sup 16}.more츽 츽췉 If Q is the baryon number, stability with respect to the decay into protons requires Q > or approx. 10{sup 17}Q{sub cr}, while if the gravitino mass is greater then m{sub 3/2} > or approx. 61 MeV, no stable gauge-mediation supersymmetric Q-balls exist. Finally, we find that energy and radius of Q-balls can be parametrized as E{approx}{xi}{sub E}Q{sup 3/4} and R{approx}{xi}{sub R}Q{sup 1/4}, where {xi}{sub E} and {xi}{sub R} are slowly varying functions of the charge.츽춺츽 less\n\nRigid supersymmetric backgrounds of 3-dimensional Newton-Cartan supergravity\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKnodel, Gino; Lisbao, Pedro; Liu, James T.\n\n2016-06-06\n\nRecently, a non-relativistic off-shell formulation of three dimensional Newton-Cartan supergravity was proposed as the c 칙춙 칙춛 limit of three dimensional N = 2 super-gravity [1]. Here in the present paper we study supersymmetric backgrounds within this theory. Using integrability constraints for the non-relativistic Killing spinor equations, we explicitly construct all maximally supersymmetric solutions, which admit four supercharges. In addition to these solutions, there aremore츽 츽췉 $$\\\\frac{1}{2}$$ -BPS solutions with reduced supersymmetry. We give explicit examples of such backgrounds and derive necessary conditions for backgrounds preserving two supercharges. Finally, we address how supersymmetric backgrounds of N = 2 supergravity are connected to the solutions found here in the c 칙춙 칙춛 limit.츽춺츽 less\n\nOn supermatrix models, Poisson geometry, and noncommutative supersymmetric gauge theories\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKlim츿춠츾춼k, Ctirad\n\n2015-12-15\n\nWe construct a new supermatrix model which represents a manifestly supersymmetric noncommutative regularisation of the UOSp(2|1) supersymmetric Schwinger model on the supersphere.

We analyze the two known N = 2 supersymmetric invariants for various non-supersymmetric black holes and find that both reduce to the Euler invariant. The c-anomaly therefore vanishes in these theories and the coefficient of the large logarithms becomes topological. It is therefore independent of continuous black hole parameters, such as the mass, even far from extremality.\n\nNon-renormalization for non-supersymmetric black holes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCharles, Anthony M.; Larsen, Finn; Mayerson, Daniel R.\n\nWe analyze large logarithmic corrections to 4D black hole entropy and relate them to the Weyl anomaly.

In some cases the breaking of C P saturates a 't Hooft anomaly, and anomaly inflow requires nontrivial massless excitations on the domain walls. Analogously, C P can be spontaneously broken in supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with light flavors and small soft breaking parameters. We study C P breaking and domain walls in softly broken SQCD with Nfsupersymmetric case contains an extra light field, the 칉췅', which has interesting effects on the structure of the walls. Vanishing of the C P anomaly is associated with the existence of multiple domain wall trajectories through field space, including walls which support no nontrivial massless excitations. In cases with an anomaly such walls are forbidden, and their absence in the relevant SQCD theories can be seen directly from the geometry of the low energy field space. In the case Nf=N -1 , multiple approximately Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield walls connect the vacua. Corrections to their tensions can be computed at leading order in the soft breaking parameters, producing a phase diagram for the stable wall trajectory. We also comment on domain walls in the similar case of QCD with an adjoint and fundamental flavors, and on the impact of adding an axion in this theory.\n\nDeep space target location with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Hipparcos data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNull, George W.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nInterplanetary spacecraft navigation requires accurate a priori knowledge of target positions. A concept is presented for attaining improved target ephemeris accuracy using two future Earth-orbiting optical observatories, the European Space Agency (ESA) Hipparcos observatory and the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Assuming nominal observatory performance, the Hipparcos data reduction will provide an accurate global star catalog, and HST will provide a capability for accurate angular measurements of stars and solar system bodies. The target location concept employs HST to observe solar system bodies relative to Hipparcos catalog stars and to determine the orientation (frame tie) of these stars to compact extragalactic radio sources. The target location process is described, the major error sources discussed, the potential target ephemeris error predicted, and mission applications identified. Preliminary results indicate that ephemeris accuracy comparable to the errors in individual Hipparcos catalog stars may be possible with a more extensive HST observing program. Possible future ground and spacebased replacements for Hipparcos and HST astrometric capabilities are also discussed.\n\nMotion prediction of a non-cooperative space target\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Bang-Zhao; Cai, Guo-Ping; Liu, Yun-Meng; Liu, Pan\n\n2018-01-01\n\nCapturing a non-cooperative space target is a tremendously challenging research topic. Effective acquisition of motion information of the space target is the premise to realize target capture. In this paper, motion prediction of a free-floating non-cooperative target in space is studied and a motion prediction algorithm is proposed. In order to predict the motion of the free-floating non-cooperative target, dynamic parameters of the target must be firstly identified (estimated), such as inertia, angular momentum and kinetic energy and so on; then the predicted motion of the target can be acquired by substituting these identified parameters into the Euler's equations of the target. Accurate prediction needs precise identification. This paper presents an effective method to identify these dynamic parameters of a free-floating non-cooperative target. This method is based on two steps, (1) the rough estimation of the parameters is computed using the motion observation data to the target, and (2) the best estimation of the parameters is found by an optimization method. In the optimization problem, the objective function is based on the difference between the observed and the predicted motion, and the interior-point method (IPM) is chosen as the optimization algorithm, which starts at the rough estimate obtained in the first step and finds a global minimum to the objective function with the guidance of objective function's gradient. So the speed of IPM searching for the global minimum is fast, and an accurate identification can be obtained in time. The numerical results show that the proposed motion prediction algorithm is able to predict the motion of the target.\n\nVertex Space Analysis for Model-Based Target Recognition.\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1996-08-01\n\nperformed in our unique invariant representation, Vertex Space, that reduces both the dimensionality and size of the required search space.

These correlations are demonstrated via extensive Monte Carlo simulation of seventeen benchmark models, each sampled at five distinct LHC center-of-mass beam energies, spanning the parameter space of No-Scale mathcal{F} -SU(5). This construction is defined in turn by the union of the mathcal{F} -lipped SU(5) Grand Unified Theory, two pairs of hypothetical TeV scale vector-like supersymmetric multiplets with origins in mathcal{F} -theory, and the dynamically established boundary conditions of No-Scale Supergravity. In addition, we consider a control sample comprised of a standard minimal Supergravity benchmark point. Led by a striking similarity between the H_{text{T}}^{text{miss}} distribution and the familiar power spectrum of a black body radiator at various temperatures, we implement a broad empirical fit of our simulation against a Poisson distribution ans츾춳tz. We advance the resulting fit as a theoretical blueprint for deducing the mass of the LSP, utilizing only the missing transverse energy in a statistical sampling of 칙출춴 9 jet events. Cumulative uncertainties central to the method subsist at a satisfactory 12-15% level. The fact that supersymmetric particle spectrum of No-Scale mathcal{F} -SU(5) has thrived the withering onslaught of early LHC data that is steadily decimating the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and minimal Supergravity parameter spaces is a prime motivation for augmenting more conventional LSP search methodologies with the presently proposed alternative.\n\nDoes the supersymmetric integrability imply the integrability of Bosonic sector\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPopowicz, Ziemowit\n\n2010-03-08\n\nThe answer is no. This is demonstrated for two equations that belong to the supersymmetric Manin-Radul N = 1 Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (MRSKP) hierarchy. The first one is the N = 1 supersymmetric Sawada-Kotera equation recently considered by Tian and Liu. We define the bi-Hamiltonian structure for this equation which however does not reduce in the bosonic limit to the known bi-Hamiltonian structure. The second equation is obtained from the Lax operator of the fifth order in the supersymmetric derivatives which in the bosonic sector reduces to the system of interacted two KdV equations discovered by Drinfeld and Sokolov in 1981 andmore츽 츽췉 later rediscovered by Sakovich and Foursov.츽춺츽 less\n\nNonlinear sigma models with compact hyperbolic target spaces\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGubser, Steven; Saleem, Zain H.; Schoenholz, Samuel S.; Stoica, Bogdan; Stokes, James\n\n2016-06-01\n\nWe explore the phase structure of nonlinear sigma models with target spaces corresponding to compact quotients of hyperbolic space, focusing on the case of a hyperbolic genus-2 Riemann surface. The continuum theory of these models can be approximated by a lattice spin system which we simulate using Monte Carlo methods. The target space possesses interesting geometric and topological properties which are reflected in novel features of the sigma model. In particular, we observe a topological phase transition at a critical temperature, above which vortices proliferate, reminiscent of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the O(2) model [1, 2]. Unlike in the O(2) case, there are many different types of vortices, suggesting a possible analogy to the Hagedorn treatment of statistical mechanics of a proliferating number of hadron species. Below the critical temperature the spins cluster around six special points in the target space known as Weierstrass points. The diversity of compact hyperbolic manifolds suggests that our model is only the simplest example of a broad class of statistical mechanical models whose main features can be understood essentially in geometric terms.\n\nSupersymmetric contributions to weak decay correlation coefficients\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nProfumo, S.; Ramsey-Musolf, M.

In the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), one-loop box graphs containing superpartners can give rise to non-(V-Ax(V-A) four-fermion operators in the presence of left-right or flavor mixing between sfermions. We analyze the present phenomenological constraints on such mixing and determine the range of allowed contributions to the weak decay correlation coefficients. We discuss the prospective implications for future {mu}- and {beta}-decay experiments, and argue that they may provide unique probes of left-right mixing in the first generation scalar fermion sector.\n\nDeviations from Newton's law in supersymmetric large extra dimensions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCallin, P.; Burgess, C. P.\n\n2006-09-01\n\nDeviations from Newton's inverse-squared law at the micron length scale are smoking-gun signals for models containing supersymmetric large extra dimensions (SLEDs), which have been proposed as approaches for resolving the cosmological constant problem. Just like their non-supersymmetric counterparts, SLED models predict gravity to deviate from the inverse-square law because of the advent of new dimensions at sub-millimeter scales. However SLED models differ from their non-supersymmetric counterparts in three important ways: (i) the size of the extra dimensions is fixed by the observed value of the dark energy density, making it impossible to shorten the range over which new deviations from Newton's law must be seen; (ii) supersymmetry predicts there to be more fields in the extra dimensions than just gravity, implying different types of couplings to matter and the possibility of repulsive as well as attractive interactions; and (iii) the same mechanism which is purported to keep the cosmological constant naturally small also keeps the extra-dimensional moduli effectively massless, leading to deviations from general relativity in the far infrared of the scalar-tensor form. We here explore the deviations from Newton's law which are predicted over micron distances, and show the ways in which they differ and resemble those in the non-supersymmetric case.\n\nDirect computational approach to lattice supersymmetric quantum mechanics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKadoh, Daisuke; Nakayama, Katsumasa\n\n2018-07-01\n\nWe study the lattice supersymmetric models numerically using the transfer matrix approach. This method consists only of deterministic processes and has no statistical uncertainties. We improve it by performing a scale transformation of variables such that the Witten index is correctly reproduced from the lattice model, and the other prescriptions are shown in detail. Compared to the precious Monte-Carlo results, we can estimate the effective masses, SUSY Ward identity and the cut-off dependence of the results in high precision. Those kinds of information are useful in improving lattice formulation of supersymmetric models.\n\nAnomaly-corrected supersymmetry algebra and supersymmetric holographic renormalization\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAn, Ok Song\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWe present a systematic approach to supersymmetric holographic renormalization for a generic 5D N=2 gauged supergravity theory with matter multiplets, including its fermionic sector, with all gauge fields consistently set to zero. We determine the complete set of supersymmetric local boundary counterterms, including the finite counterterms that parameterize the choice of supersymmetric renormalization scheme. This allows us to derive holographically the superconformal Ward identities of a 4D superconformal field theory on a generic background, including the Weyl and super-Weyl anomalies. Moreover, we show that these anomalies satisfy the Wess-Zumino consistency condition. The super-Weyl anomaly implies that the fermionic operators of the dual field theory, such as the supercurrent, do not transform as tensors under rigid supersymmetry on backgrounds that admit a conformal Killing spinor, and their anticommutator with the conserved supercharge contains anomalous terms. This property is explicitly checked for a toy model. Finally, using the anomalous transformation of the supercurrent, we obtain the anomaly-corrected supersymmetry algebra on curved backgrounds admitting a conformal Killing spinor.\n\nGeometric shapes inversion method of space targets by ISAR image segmentation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuo, Chao-ying; Xing, Xiao-yu; Yin, Hong-cheng; Li, Chen-guang; Zeng, Xiang-yun; Xu, Gao-gui\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe geometric shape of target is an effective characteristic in the process of space targets recognition. This paper proposed a method of shape inversion of space target based on components segmentation from ISAR image. The Radon transformation, Hough transformation, K-means clustering, triangulation will be introduced into ISAR image processing. Firstly, we use Radon transformation and edge detection to extract space target's main body spindle and solar panel spindle from ISAR image. Then the targets' main body, solar panel, rectangular and circular antenna are segmented from ISAR image based on image detection theory. Finally, the sizes of every structural component are computed. The effectiveness of this method is verified using typical targets' simulation data.\n\nNonlinear sigma models with compact hyperbolic target spaces\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGubser, Steven; Saleem, Zain H.; Schoenholz, Samuel S.\n\nWe explore the phase structure of nonlinear sigma models with target spaces corresponding to compact quotients of hyperbolic space, focusing on the case of a hyperbolic genus-2 Riemann surface. The continuum theory of these models can be approximated by a lattice spin system which we simulate using Monte Carlo methods. The target space possesses interesting geometric and topological properties which are reflected in novel features of the sigma model. In particular, we observe a topological phase transition at a critical temperature, above which vortices proliferate, reminiscent of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the O(2) model [1, 2]. Unlike in themore츽 츽췉 O(2) case, there are many different types of vortices, suggesting a possible analogy to the Hagedorn treatment of statistical mechanics of a proliferating number of hadron species. Below the critical temperature the spins cluster around six special points in the target space known as Weierstrass points. In conclusion, the diversity of compact hyperbolic manifolds suggests that our model is only the simplest example of a broad class of statistical mechanical models whose main features can be understood essentially in geometric"
