In the present study, we explore the potential of historical multi-temporal elevation models, combined with recent topographic data, to quantify 66 years (from 1953 to 2019) of river changes in the glacier forefield of an Alpine catchment. Thereby, we quantify the changes in the river form as well as the related sediment erosion and deposition.\n\nDevelopment of the morphodynamics on Little Ice Age lateral moraines in 10 glacier forefields of the Eastern Alps since theÂ 1950s\n\nSarah Betz-Nutz, Tobias Heckmann, Florian Haas, and Michael Becht\n\nEarth Surf.

We derived multitemporal models from historical aerial images and recent drone images to investigate the morphodynamics on moraine slopes over time. We found that the highest erosion rates occur on the steepest moraine slopes, which stay active for decades, and that the slope angle explains morphodynamics better than the time since deglaciation.\n\nSpatio-temporal analysis of slope-type debris flow activity in Horlachtal, Austria, based on orthophotos and lidar data since 1947\n\nJakob Rom, Florian Haas, Tobias Heckmann, Moritz Altmann, Fabian Fleischer, Camillo Ressl, Sarah Betz-Nutz, and Michael Becht\n\nNat.

Spatial and temporal analyses show variations in debris flow activity in space and time in a high-alpine region. The results can contribute to a better understanding of past slope-type debris flow dynamics in the context of extreme precipitation events and their possible future development.\n\nMulti-decadal (1953â2017) rock glacier kinematics analysed by high-resolution topographic data in the upper Kaunertal, Austria\n\nFabian Fleischer, Florian Haas, Livia Piermattei, Madlene Pfeiffer, Tobias Heckmann, Moritz Altmann, Jakob Rom, Manuel Stark, Michael H.

Using a combination of historical aerial photographs and laser scanning data, we derive information on flow velocities and surface elevation changes. We observe a loss of volume and an acceleration from the late 1990s onwards. We explain this by changes in the meteorological forcing. Individual rock glaciers react to these changes to varying degrees.\n\nAssessing the effect of lithological setting, block characteristics and slope topography on the runout length of rockfalls in the Alps and on the island of La RÃ©union\n\nKerstin Wegner, Florian Haas, Tobias Heckmann, Anne Mangeney, Virginie Durand, Nicolas Villeneuve, Philippe Kowalski, Aline Peltier, and Michael Becht\n\nNat.

We selected four study sites that feature different rock types. High-resolution terrestrial laser scanning data were acquired to measure the block size and block shape (axial ratio) of rockfall particles on the scree deposits. Laser scanning data were also used to characterize the morphology of these landforms. Our results show that hill slope and rock particle properties govern rock particle runout in a complex manner.\n\nMonitoring and modeling slope dynamics in an Alpine watershed – a combined approach of soil science, remote sensing and geomorphology\n\nF.

An existing physical event-based erosion model approach was tested on theses slopes and validated with the laser scanning values. Modeled and scanned values are in 98.4% agreement. Additionally a statistical modeling approach was used to compare the results with a previous study in a nearby area. The comparison showed a good applicability of the model on different slopes.\n\nLong-term monitoring (1953â2019) of geomorphologically active sections of Little Ice Age lateral moraines in the context of changing meteorological conditions\n\nMoritz Altmann, Madlene Pfeiffer, Florian Haas, Jakob Rom, Fabian Fleischer, Tobias Heckmann, Livia Piermattei, Michael Wimmer, Lukas Braun, Manuel Stark, Sarah Betz-Nutz, and Michael Becht\n\nEarth Surf.

We have applied geomorphological qualitative analyses, geomorphic index, and knickpoint modelling to detect the Quaternary reactivation of fractures in the Betic foreland (southern Spain). The obtained relief rejuvenation pattern and fault kinematics agree with propagation of transpressional deformation from the Betic fold-and-thrust belt.\n\nMulti-decadal (1953â2017) rock glacier kinematics analysed by high-resolution topographic data in the upper Kaunertal, Austria\n\nFabian Fleischer, Florian Haas, Livia Piermattei, Madlene Pfeiffer, Tobias Heckmann, Moritz Altmann, Jakob Rom, Manuel Stark, Michael H.

The main novelties consist of reproducing rainfall-induced geo-hydrological hazards such as shallow landslide, debris flow and watershed erosion through a multi-hazard approach. CRHyME was written in Python, works at a high spatial and temporal resolution, and is a tool suitable for quantifying extreme rainfall consequences at the basin scale.\n\nCurrent and future rainfall-driven flood risk from hurricanes in Puerto Rico under 1.5 and 2 Â°C climate change\n\nLeanne Archer, Jeffrey Neal, Paul Bates, Emily Vosper, Dereka Carroll, Jeison Sosa, and Daniel Mitchell\n\nNat.

Our analysis suggests 8 %–10 % of the population is currently exposed to flooding on average every 5 years, increasing by 2 %–15 % and 1 %–20 % at 1.5 and 2 °C. This has implications for adaptation to more extreme flooding in Puerto Rico and demonstrates that 1.5 °C climate change carries a significant increase in risk.\n\nUsing integrated hydrologicalâhydraulic modelling and global data sources to analyse the February 2023 floods in the Umbeluzi Catchment (Mozambique)\n\nLuis Cea, Manuel Ãlvarez, and JerÃ³nimo Puertas\n\nNat.

Sci., 24, 225–243, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-225-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-225-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMozambique is highly exposed to the impact of floods. To reduce flood damage, it is necessary to develop mitigation measures. Hydrological software is a very useful tool for that purpose, since it allows for a precise quantification of flood hazard in different scenarios. We present a methodology to quantify flood hazard in data-scarce regions, using freely available data and software, and we show its potential by analysing the flood event that took place in the Umbeluzi Basin in February 2023.\n\nImpact-based flood forecasting in the Greater Horn of Africa\n\nLorenzo Alfieri, Andrea Libertino, Lorenzo Campo, Francesco Dottori, Simone Gabellani, Tatiana Ghizzoni, Alessandro Masoero, Lauro Rossi, Roberto Rudari, Nicola Testa, Eva Trasforini, Ahmed Amdihun, Jully Ouma, Luca Rossi, Yves Tramblay, Huan Wu, and Marco MassabÃ²\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

It is based on hydrological simulations, inundation mapping, and estimation of population and assets exposed to upcoming river floods. The system supports duty officers in African institutions in the daily monitoring of hydro-meteorological disasters. A first evaluation shows the system performance for the catastrophic floods in the Nile River basin in summer 2020.\n\nBrief communication: A first hydrological investigation of extreme AugustÂ 2023 floods in Slovenia, Europe\n\nNejc Bezak, Panos Panagos, Leonidas Liakos, and MatjaÅ¾ MikoÅ¡\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3885–3893, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3885-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3885-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExtreme flooding occurred in Slovenia in August 2023. This brief communication examines the main causes, mechanisms and effects of this event. The flood disaster of August 2023 can be described as relatively extreme and was probably the most extreme flood event in Slovenia in recent decades. The economic damage was large and could amount to well over 5 % of Slovenia's annual gross domestic product; the event also claimed three lives.\n\nMultivariate regression trees as an âexplainable machine learningâ approach to explore relationships between hydroclimatic characteristics and agricultural and hydrological drought severity: case of study Cesar River basin\n\nAna Paez-Trujilo, Jeffer CaÃ±on, Beatriz Hernandez, Gerald Corzo, and Dimitri Solomatine\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3863–3883, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3863-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3863-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses a machine learning technique, the multivariate regression tree approach, to assess the hydroclimatic characteristics that govern agricultural and hydrological drought severity. The results show that the employed technique successfully identified the primary drivers of droughts and their critical thresholds. In addition, it provides relevant information to identify the areas most vulnerable to droughts and design strategies and interventions for drought management.\n\nReview article: Towards improved drought prediction in the Mediterranean region â modeling approaches and future directions\n\nBouchra Zellou, Nabil El MoÃ§ayd, and El Houcine Bergou\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3543–3583, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3543-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3543-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we underscore the critical importance of strengthening drought prediction capabilities in the Mediterranean region. We present an in-depth evaluation of current drought forecasting approaches, encompassing statistical, dynamical, and hybrid statistical–dynamical models, and highlight unexplored research opportunities. Additionally, we suggest viable directions to enhance drought prediction and early warning systems within the area.\n\nAssessing typhoon-induced compound flood drivers: a case study in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam\n\nFrancisco Rodrigues do Amaral, Nicolas Gratiot, Thierry Pellarin, and Tran Anh Tu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3379–3405, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3379-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3379-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose an in-depth analysis of typhoon-induced compound flood drivers in the megacity of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. We use in situ and satellite measurements throughout the event to form a holistic overview of its impact. No evidence of storm surge was found, and peak precipitation presents a 16 h time lag to peak river discharge, which evacuates only 1.5 % of available water. The astronomical tide controls the river level even during the extreme event, and it is the main urban flood driver.\n\nAssessing the ability of a new seamless short-range ensemble rainfall product to anticipate flash floods in the French Mediterranean area\n\nJuliette Godet, Olivier Payrastre, Pierre Javelle, and FranÃ§ois Bouttier\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3355–3377, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3355-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3355-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article results from a master's research project which was part of a natural hazards programme developed by the French Ministry of Ecological Transition. The objective of this work was to investigate a possible way to improve the operational flash flood warning service by adding rainfall forecasts upstream of the forecasting chain. The results showed that the tested forecast product, which is new and experimental, has a real added value compared to other classical forecast products.\n\nSentinel-1-based analysis of the severe flood over Pakistan 2022\n\nFlorian Roth, Bernhard Bauer-Marschallinger, Mark Edwin Tupas, Christoph Reimer, Peter Salamon, and Wolfgang Wagner\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3305–3317, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3305-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3305-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn August and September 2022, millions of people were impacted by a severe flood event in Pakistan. Since many roads and other infrastructure were destroyed, satellite data were the only way of providing large-scale information on the flood's impact. Based on the flood mapping algorithm developed at Technische Universität Wien (TU Wien), we mapped an area of 30 492 km2 that was flooded at least once during the study's time period. This affected area matches about the total area of Belgium.\n\nSensitivity analysis of erosion on the landward slope of an earthen flood defense located in southern France submitted to wave overtopping\n\nClÃ©ment Houdard, Adrien Poupardin, Philippe Sergent, Abdelkrim Bennabi, and Jena Jeong\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 3111–3124, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3111-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-3111-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed a system able to to predict, knowing the appropriate characteristics of the flood defense structure and sea state, the return periods of potentially dangerous events as well as a ranking of parameters by order of uncertainty. The model is a combination of statistical and empirical methods that have been applied to a Mediterranean earthen dike. This shows that the most important characteristics of the dyke are its geometrical features, such as its height and slope angles.\n\nFlash Flood Detection via Copula-based IDF Curves: Evidence from Jamaica\n\nDino Collalti, Nekeisha Spencer, and Eric Strobl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-162,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-162, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe risk of extreme rainfall events causing floods is likely increasing with climate change. Flash floods, which follow immediately after extreme rainfall, are particularly difficult to forecast and assess. We develop a decision rule for flash flood classification with data on all incidents between 2001 and 2018 in Jamaica with the statistical copula method. This decision rule tells us for any rainfall event of a certain duration how intense it has to be to likely trigger a flash flood.\n\nBetter prepared but less resilient: the paradoxical impact of frequent flood experience on adaptive behavior and resilience\n\nLisa KÃ¶hler, Torsten Masson, Sabrina KÃ¶hler, and Christian Kuhlicke\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2787–2806, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2787-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2787-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyzed the impact of flood experience on adaptive behavior and self-reported resilience. The outcomes draw a paradoxical picture: the most experienced people are the most adapted but the least resilient. We find evidence for non-linear relationships between the number of floods experienced and resilience. We contribute to existing knowledge by focusing specifically on the number of floods experienced and extending the rare scientific literature on the influence of experience on resilience.\n\nAssessing the spatial spreadâskill of ensemble flood maps with remote-sensing observations\n\nHelen Hooker, Sarah L. Dance, David C. Mason, John Bevington, and Kay Shelton\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2769–2785, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2769-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2769-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEnsemble forecasts of flood inundation produce maps indicating the probability of flooding. A new approach is presented to evaluate the spatial performance of an ensemble flood map forecast by comparison against remotely observed flooding extents. This is important for understanding forecast uncertainties and improving flood forecasting systems.\n\nAn integrated modeling approach to evaluate the impacts of nature-based solutions of flood mitigation across a small watershed in the southeast United States\n\nBetina I. Guido, Ioana Popescu, Vidya Samadi, and Biswa Bhattacharya\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2663–2681, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2663-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2663-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used an integrated model to evaluate the impacts of nature-based solutions (NBSs) on flood mitigation across the Little Pee Dee and Lumber River watershed, the Carolinas, US. This area is strongly affected by climatic disasters, which are expected to increase due to climate change and urbanization, so exploring an NBS approach is crucial for adapting to future alterations. Our research found that NBSs can have visible effects on the reduction in hurricane-driven flooding.\n\nIndicator-to-impact links to help improve agricultural drought preparedness in Thailand\n\nMaliko Tanguy, Michael Eastman, Eugene Magee, Lucy J. Barker, Thomas Chitson, Chaiwat Ekkawatpanit, Daniel Goodwin, Jamie Hannaford, Ian Holman, Liwa Pardthaisong, Simon Parry, Dolores Rey Vicario, and Supattra Visessri\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2419–2441, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2419-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2419-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts in Thailand are becoming more severe due to climate change. Understanding the link between drought impacts on the ground and drought indicators used in drought monitoring systems can help increase a country's preparedness and resilience to drought. With a focus on agricultural droughts, we derive crop- and region-specific indicator-to-impact links that can form the basis of targeted mitigation actions and an improved drought monitoring and early warning system in Thailand.\n\nThe potential of open-access data for flood estimations: uncovering inundation hotspots in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, through a normalized flood severity index\n\nLeon Scheiber, Mazen Hoballah Jalloul, Christian Jordan, Jan Visscher, Hong Quan Nguyen, and Torsten Schlurmann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2313–2332, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2313-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2313-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerical models are increasingly important for assessing urban flooding, yet reliable input data are oftentimes hard to obtain. Taking Ho Chi Minh City as an example, this paper explores the usability and reliability of open-access data to produce preliminary risk maps that provide first insights into potential flooding hotspots. As a key novelty, a normalized flood severity index is presented which combines flood depth and duration to enhance the interpretation of hydro-numerical results.\n\nAnalyzing the informative value of alternative hazard indicators for monitoring drought hazard for human water supply and river ecosystems at the global scale\n\nClaudia Herbert and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2111–2131, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2111-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2111-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new method for selecting streamflow drought hazard indicators for monitoring drought hazard for human water supply and river ecosystems in large-scale drought early warning systems. Indicators are classified by their inherent assumptions about the habituation of people and ecosystems to the streamflow regime and their level of drought characterization, namely drought magnitude (water deficit at a certain point in time) and severity (cumulated magnitude since drought onset).\n\nA methodological framework for the evaluation of short-range flash-flood hydrometeorological forecasts at the event scale\n\nMaryse Charpentier-Noyer, Daniela Peredo, Axelle Fleury, Hugo Marchal, FranÃ§ois Bouttier, Eric Gaume, Pierre Nicolle, Olivier Payrastre, and Maria-Helena Ramos\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2001–2029, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2001-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2001-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper proposes a methodological framework designed for event-based evaluation in the context of an intense flash-flood event. The evaluation adopts the point of view of end users, with a focus on the anticipation of exceedances of discharge thresholds. With a study of rainfall forecasts, a discharge evaluation and a detailed look at the forecast hydrographs, the evaluation framework should help in drawing robust conclusions about the usefulness of new rainfall ensemble forecasts.\n\nDoes a convection-permitting regional climate model bring new perspectives on the projection of Mediterranean floods?\n\nNils Poncet, Philippe Lucas-Picher, Yves Tramblay, Guillaume Thirel, Humberto Vergara, Jonathan Gourley, and Antoinette Alias\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-82,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-82, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA high resolution convection-permitting climate model is coupled with hydrological models over a Mediterranean catchment to simulate historical and future flood events. Results show the added value of this new generation of climate models for simulating Mediterranean floods. Future projections show an increase of the magnitude of the largest floods while the moderate floods are expected to decrease. Most floods are expected to become flashier i.e. potentially catastrophic in a warmer climate.\n\nAdded value of seasonal hindcasts for UK hydrological drought outlook\n\nWilson C. H. Chan, Nigel W. Arnell, Geoff Darch, Katie Facer-Childs, Theodore G. Shepherd, and Maliko Tanguy\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-74,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-74, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe UK has experienced recurring periods of hydrological droughts, including the drought declared in summer 2022. We investigate the drivers of winter rainfall in the East Anglia region using a large sample of plausible winters from seasonal hindcasts. We produced plausible trajectories of winter weather based on their atmospheric circulation patterns and showed how storylines of the 2022 drought can be created in autumn 2022 to explore plausible worst cases over winter 2022/23 and beyond.\n\nHydrological drought forecasting under a changing environment in the Luanhe River basin\n\nMin Li, Mingfeng Zhang, Runxiang Cao, Yidi Sun, and Xiyuan Deng\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1453–1464, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1453-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1453-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is an important disaster reduction strategy to forecast hydrological drought. In order to analyse the impact of human activities on hydrological drought, we constructed the human activity factor based on the method of restoration. With the increase of human index (HI) value, hydrological droughts tend to transition to more severe droughts. The conditional distribution model involving of human activity factor can further improve the forecasting accuracy of drought in the Luanhe River basin.\n\nA multi-disciplinary analysis of the exceptional flood event of July 2021 in central Europe â Part 2: Historical context and relation to climate change\n\nPatrick Ludwig, Florian Ehmele, MÃ¡rio J.

The event was among the five heaviest precipitation events of the past 70 years in Germany, and the river discharges exceeded by far the statistical 100-year return values. Simulations of the event under future climate conditions revealed a strong and non-linear effect on flood peaks: for +2 K global warming, an 18 % increase in rainfall led to a 39 % increase of the flood peak in the Ahr river.\n\nBrief communication: The potential use of low-cost acoustic sensors to detect rainfall for short-term urban flood warnings\n\nNadav Peleg, Herminia TorellÃ³-Sentelles, GrÃ©goire MariÃ©thoz, Lionel Benoit, JoÃ£o P. LeitÃ£o, and Francesco Marra\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1233–1240, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1233-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1233-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods in urban areas are one of the most common natural hazards. Due to climate change enhancing extreme rainfall and cities becoming larger and denser, the impacts of these events are expected to increase. A fast and reliable flood warning system should thus be implemented in flood-prone cities to warn the public of upcoming floods. The purpose of this brief communication is to discuss the potential implementation of low-cost acoustic rainfall sensors in short-term flood warning systems.\n\nBrief communication: On the extremeness of the July 2021 precipitation event in western Germany\n\nKatharina Lengfeld, Paul Voit, Frank Kaspar, and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1227–1232, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1227-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1227-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimating the severity of a rainfall event based on the damage caused is easy but highly depends on the affected region. A less biased measure for the extremeness of an event is its rarity combined with its spatial extent. In this brief communication, we investigate the sensitivity of such measures to the underlying dataset and highlight the importance of considering multiple spatial and temporal scales using the devastating rainfall event in July 2021 in central Europe as an example.\n\nA climate-conditioned catastrophe risk model for UK flooding\n\nPaul D. Bates, James Savage, Oliver Wing, Niall Quinn, Christopher Sampson, Jeffrey Neal, and Andrew Smith\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 891–908, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-891-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-891-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present and validate a model that simulates current and future flood risk for the UK at high resolution (~ 20–25 m). We show that UK flood losses were ~ 6 % greater in the climate of 2020 compared to recent historical values. The UK can keep any future increase to ~ 8 % if all countries implement their COP26 pledges and net-zero ambitions in full. However, if only the COP26 pledges are fulfilled, then UK flood losses increase by ~ 23 %; and potentially by ~ 37 % in a worst-case scenario.\n\nA globally applicable framework for compound flood hazard modeling\n\nDirk Eilander, AnaÃ¯s Couasnon, Tim Leijnse, Hiroaki Ikeuchi, Dai Yamazaki, Sanne Muis, Job Dullaart, Arjen Haag, Hessel C. Winsemius, and Philip J. Ward\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst.

Global models however ignore these interactions. We present a framework for automated and reproducible compound flood modeling anywhere globally and validate it for two historical events in Mozambique with good results. The analysis reveals differences in compound flood dynamics between both events related to the magnitude of and time lag between drivers.\n\nTransferability of data-driven models to predict urban pluvial flood water depth in Berlin, Germany\n\nOmar Seleem, Georgy Ayzel, Axel Bronstert, and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 809–822, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-809-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-809-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nData-driven models are becoming more of a surrogate that overcomes the limitations of the computationally expensive 2D hydrodynamic models to map urban flood hazards. However, the model's ability to generalize outside the training domain is still a major challenge. We evaluate the performance of random forest and convolutional neural networks to predict urban floodwater depth and investigate their transferability outside the training domain.\n\nSeasonal forecasting of local-scale soil moisture droughts with Global BROOK90\n\nIvan Vorobevskii, Thi Thanh Luong, and Rico Kronenberg\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-9,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2023-9, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for NHESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study presents a new version of a framework which allow to model water balance components at any site for a local scale. In comparison to the first version, the second one incorporates new datasets used to setup and force the model. In particular, we want to highlight the ability of the framework to provide seasonal forecasts. This gives the potential stakeholders (farmers, foresters, policymakers etc.) possibility to forecast e.g. soil moisture drought and thus apply necessary measures.\n\nBrief communication: Inclusiveness in designing an early warning system for flood resilience\n\nTahmina Yasmin, Kieran Khamis, Anthony Ross, Subir Sen, Anita Sharma, Debashish Sen, Sumit Sen, Wouter Buytaert, and David M.

Through this paper we advocate the use of a SMART approach to encourage bottom-up initiatives to develop inclusive and purposeful early warning systems that benefit the community at risk by engaging them at every step of the way along with including other stakeholders at multiple scales of operations.\n\nEvolution of multivariate drought hazard, vulnerability and risk in India under climate change\n\nVenkataswamy Sahana and Arpita Mondal\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 623–641, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-623-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-623-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn an agriculture-dependent, densely populated country such as India, drought risk projection is important to assess future water security. This study presents the first comprehensive drought risk assessment over India, integrating hazard and vulnerability information. Future drought risk is found to be more significantly driven by increased vulnerability resulting from societal developments rather than climate-induced changes in hazard. These findings can inform planning for drought resilience.\n\nA multi-disciplinary analysis of the exceptional flood event of JulyÂ 2021 in central Europe â PartÂ 1: Event description and analysis\n\nSusanna Mohr, Uwe Ehret, Michael Kunz, Patrick Ludwig, Alberto Caldas-Alvarez, James E.

The objective of this two-part study is a multi-disciplinary assessment that examines the complex process interactions in different compartments, from meteorology to hydrological conditions to hydro-morphological processes to impacts on assets and environment. In addition, we address the question of what measures are possible to generate added value to early response management.\n\nBare-earth DEM generation from ArcticDEM and its use in flood simulation\n\nYinxue Liu, Paul D. Bates, and Jeffery C. Neal\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 375–391, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-375-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-375-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we test two approaches for removing buildings and other above-ground objects from a state-of-the-art satellite photogrammetry topography product, ArcticDEM. Our best technique gives a 70 % reduction in vertical error, with an average difference of 1.02 m from a benchmark lidar for the city of Helsinki, Finland. When used in a simulation of rainfall-driven flooding, the bare-earth version of ArcticDEM yields a significant improvement in predicted inundation extent and water depth.\n\nComparison of estimated flood exposure and consequences generated by different event-based inland flood inundation maps\n\nJoseph L.

Sci., 23, 261–277, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-261-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-261-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEmergency managers use event-based flood inundation maps (FIMs) to plan and coordinate flood emergency response. We perform a case study test of three different FIM frameworks to see if FIM differences lead to substantial differences in the location and magnitude of flood exposure and consequences. We find that the FIMs are very different spatially and that the spatial differences do produce differences in the location and magnitude of exposure and consequences.\n\nHow uncertain are precipitation and peak flow estimates for the July 2021 flooding event?\n\nMohamed Saadi, Carina Furusho-Percot, Alexandre Belleflamme, Ju-Yu Chen, Silke TrÃ¶mel, and Stefan Kollet\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 159–177, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-159-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-159-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOn 14 July 2021, heavy rainfall fell over central Europe, causing considerable damage and human fatalities. We analyzed how accurate our estimates of rainfall and peak flow were for these flooding events in western Germany. We found that the rainfall estimates from radar measurements were improved by including polarimetric variables and their vertical gradients. Peak flow estimates were highly uncertain due to uncertainties in hydrological model parameters and rainfall measurements.\n\nEstimating the likelihood of roadway pluvial flood based on crowdsourced traffic data and depression-based DEM analysis\n\nArefeh Safaei-Moghadam, David Tarboton, and Barbara Minsker\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1–19, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change, urbanization, and aging infrastructure contribute to flooding on roadways. This study evaluates the potential for flood reports collected from Waze – a community-based navigation app – to predict these events. Waze reports correlate primarily with low-lying depressions on roads. Therefore, we developed two data-driven models to determine whether roadways will flood. Analysis showed that in the city of Dallas, drainage area and imperviousness are the most significant contributors.\n\nA multi-strategy-mode waterlogging-prediction framework for urban flood depth\n\nZongjia Zhang, Jun Liang, Yujue Zhou, Zhejun Huang, Jie Jiang, Junguo Liu, and Lili Yang\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 4139–4165, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-4139-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-4139-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAn innovative multi-strategy-mode waterlogging-prediction framework for predicting waterlogging depth is proposed in the paper. The framework selects eight regression algorithms for comparison and tests the prediction accuracy and robustness of the model under different prediction strategies. Ultimately, the accuracy of predicting water depth after 30 min can exceed 86.1 %. This can aid decision-making in terms of issuing early warning information and determining emergency responses in advance.\n\nMultiscale flood risk assessment under climate change: the case of the MiÃ±o River in the city of Ourense, Spain\n\nDiego FernÃ¡ndez-NÃ³voa, Orlando GarcÃ­a-Feal, JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez-Cao, Maite deCastro, and Moncho GÃ³mez-Gesteira\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3957–3972, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3957-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3957-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA multiscale analysis, where the historical and future precipitation data from the CORDEX project were used as input in a hydrological model (HEC-HMS) that, in turn, feeds a 2D hydraulic model (Iber+), was applied to the case of the Miño-Sil basin (NW Spain), specifically to Ourense city, in order to analyze future changes in flood hazard. Detailed flood maps indicate an increase in the frequency and intensity of future floods, implying an increase in flood hazard in important areas of the city.\n\nInteractions between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil-moisture-based indices to characterize drought with high-resolution remote sensing and land-surface model data\n\nJaime Gaona, Pere Quintana-SeguÃ­, MarÃ­a JosÃ© Escorihuela, Aaron Boone, and MarÃ­a Carmen Llasat\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3461–3485, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3461-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3461-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts represent a particularly complex natural hazard and require explorations of their multiple causes. Part of the complexity has roots in the interaction between the continuous changes in and deviation from normal conditions of the atmosphere and the land surface. The exchange between the atmospheric and surface conditions defines feedback towards dry or wet conditions. In semi-arid environments, energy seems to exceed water in its impact over the evolution of conditions, favoring drought.\n\nRare flood scenarios for a rapidly growing high-mountain city: Pokhara, Nepal\n\nMelanie Fischer, Jana Brettin, Sigrid Roessner, Ariane Walz, Monique Fort, and Oliver Korup\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3105–3123, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3105-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3105-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNepalâs second-largest city has been rapidly growing since the 1970s, although its valley has been affected by rare, catastrophic floods in recent and historic times. We analyse potential impacts of such floods on urban areas and infrastructure by modelling 10 physically plausible flood scenarios along Pokharaâs main river. We find that hydraulic effects would largely affect a number of squatter settlements, which have expanded rapidly towards the river by a factor of up to 20 since 2008.\n\nBrief communication: Impact forecasting could substantially improve the emergency management of deadly floods: case study JulyÂ 2021 floods in Germany\n\nHeiko Apel, Sergiy Vorogushyn, and Bruno Merz\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3005–3014, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3005-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3005-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper presents a fast 2D hydraulic simulation model for flood propagation that enables operational forecasts of spatially distributed inundation depths, flood extent, flow velocities, and other flood impacts. The detailed spatial forecast of floods and flood impacts is a large step forward from the currently operational forecasts of discharges at selected gauges, thus enabling a more targeted flood management and early warning.\n\nBrief communication: Western Europe flood in 2021 â mapping agriculture flood exposure from synthetic aperture radar (SAR)\n\nKang He, Qing Yang, Xinyi Shen, and Emmanouil N. Anagnostou\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2921–2927, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2921-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2921-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study depicts the flood-affected areas in western Europe in July 2021 and particularly the agriculture land that was under flood inundation. The results indicate that the total inundated area over western Europe is about 1920 km2, of which 1320 km2 is in France. Around 64 &percnt; of the inundated area is agricultural land. We expect that the agricultural productivity in western Europe will have been severely impacted.\n\nComprehensive spaceâtime hydrometeorological simulations for estimating very rare floods at multiple sites in a large river basin\n\nDaniel Viviroli, Anna E. Sikorska-Senoner, Guillaume Evin, Maria Staudinger, Martina Kauzlaric, JÃ©rÃ©my Chardon, Anne-Catherine Favre, Benoit Hingray, Gilles Nicolet, Damien Raynaud, Jan Seibert, Rolf Weingartner, and Calvin Whealton\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2891–2920, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2891-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2891-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEstimating the magnitude of rare to very rare floods is a challenging task due to a lack of sufficiently long observations. The challenge is even greater in large river basins, where precipitation patterns and amounts differ considerably between individual events and floods from different parts of the basin coincide. We show that a hydrometeorological model chain can provide plausible estimates in this setting and can thus inform flood risk and safety assessments for critical infrastructure.\n\nA new index to quantify the extremeness of precipitation across scales\n\nPaul Voit and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2791–2805, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2791-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2791-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo better understand how the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events (HPEs) will change with changing climate and to adapt disaster risk management accordingly, we have to quantify the extremeness of HPEs in a reliable way. We introduce the xWEI (cross-scale WEI) and show that this index can reveal important characteristics of HPEs that would otherwise remain hidden. We conclude that the xWEI could be a valuable instrument in both disaster risk management and research.\n\nEffectiveness of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 for flood detection assessment in Europe\n\nAngelica Tarpanelli, Alessandro C. Mondini, and Stefania Camici\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2473–2489, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2473-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2473-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analysed 10 years of river discharge data from almost 2000 sites in Europe, and we extracted flood events, as proxies of flood inundations, based on the overpasses of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites to derive the percentage of potential inundation events that they were able to observe. Results show that on average 58 % of flood events are potentially observable by Sentinel-1 and only 28 % by Sentinel-2 due to the obstacle of cloud coverage.\n\nAssessing flood hazard changes using climate model forcing\n\nDavid P. Callaghan and Michael G. Hughes\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2459–2472, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2459-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2459-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new method was developed to estimate changes in flood hazard under climate change. We use climate projections covering New South Wales, Australia, with two emission paths of business as usual and one with reduced emissions. We apply our method to the lower floodplain of the Gwydir Valley with changes in flood hazard provided over the next 90 years compared with the previous 50 years. We find that changes in flood hazard decrease over time within the Gwydir Valley floodplain.\n\nCharacterizing multivariate coastal flooding events in a semi-arid region: the implications of copula choice, sampling, and infrastructure\n\nJoseph T. D. Lucey and Timu W. Gallien\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2145–2167, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2145-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2145-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal flooding can result from multiple flood drivers (e.g., tides, waves, river flows, rainfall) occurring at the same time. This study characterizes flooding events caused by high marine water levels and rain. Results show that wet-season coinciding sampling may better describe extreme flooding events in a dry, tidally dominated region. A joint-probability-based function is then used to estimate sea wall impacts on urban coastal flooding.\n\nDifferent drought types and the spatial variability in their hazard, impact, and propagation characteristics\n\nErik Tijdeman, Veit Blauhut, Michael Stoelzle, Lucas Menzel, and Kerstin Stahl\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 2099–2116, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2099-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-2099-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe identified different drought types with typical hazard and impact characteristics. The summer drought type with compounding heat was most impactful. Regional drought propagation of this drought type exhibited typical characteristics that can guide drought management. However, we also found a large spatial variability that caused distinct differences among propagating drought signals. Accordingly, local multivariate drought information was needed to explain the full range of drought impacts.\n\nCited articles\n\nAbellÃ¡n, A., Jaboyedoff, M., Oppikofer, T., and Vilaplana, J.
