Endoscopic Transcanal Cartilage Myringoplasty for Repair of Subtotal Tympanic Membrane Perforation: A Method to Avoid Postauricular Incision

Khaled M Mokbel, Waleed Moneir, Hossam Elsisi and Ahmed Alsobky

Article Type: Original Article | First Published: December 28, 2015

Our aim is to evaluate transcanal endoscopic approach in repair of subtotal tympanic membrane perforation in a trial to prevent conventional postaural approach. Our study was done in 80 patients with unilateral dry subtotal tympanic perforations. They were 44 males and 36 females. Their ages ranged from 18-50 years with mean of 33 years. Autograft thin (0.2 mm) auricular cartilage shield was used to repair tympanic membrane perforation. Patients were divided into two groups according to the appr...

Nasal Glomangiopericytoma: Case Report and Clinicohistopathologic Overview

Sheldon P. Hersh and William H. Rodgers

Article Type: Case Report | First Published: September 25, 2015

Glomangiopericytoma, also known as sinonasal hemangiopericytoma, is a rare sinonasal neoplasm that commonly occurs during the sixth or seventh decade of life, often presenting with complaints of nasal congestion and epistaxis. Identified in less than 0.5% of all sinonasal tumors, this typically indolent lesion is a different tumor from the far more common and aggressive so-called soft tissue hemangiopericytoma that arises in varying sites throughout th
