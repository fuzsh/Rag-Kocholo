Hidayat Orujov, the Chairman of the Azerbaijani State Committee on Religious Bodies stated during talks with journalists that Azerbaijan is struggling with radical religious group who are working against the State, Trend reports.

We are not dealing with sects or religions but different persons and groups. In accordance with the Azerbaijani legislation different sects and religions are welcomed to practice their beliefs. The Azerbaijani society will never accept any impact of any countries and their religious models. We will fight with them, Orujov stressed.

He noted that 96% of the Azerbaijani population is Muslims, while 4% belong to different religions. Azerbaijan has established favorable terms for practicing any religion, Orujov stressed.
