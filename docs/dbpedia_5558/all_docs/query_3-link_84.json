        "text": "Folklora is the most prestigious heritage of a nation. İn its true sense, folklore is a nation's spirits, psychology, and history. It is an invaluable treasure, the reflector of a nation's wishes and desires, imagination and thinking, and the inner world. To add up more, \"The folklore gifted such wisdom to the geniuses of the East that on the one hand it amazes the people and on the other hand earns respect for its accuracy and preciseness\" (2,13)*. It becomes difficult to understand, perceive a nation's psychology, true history, its specific place in the history of humanity, the stages of development, lifestyle, outlook, believes and faith, customs and traditions without being aware of its folklore.\n\nFolklore is the main force, which provides a nation's integrity in its spirits, mind and conscience, doesn't let a nation apart into pieces, forget its own roots, ancestors, which are immortalized and turned to live memories in epics, tales, bayatis and legends (7, 3-4).\n\nFrom this point, the folklore of an Azerbaijani-speaking elat (a part of nation living as a group. The term can be applied to place and people) -which had to separate from its roots for certain social- political reasons and later on settled down amongst Arabs and Kurds, in the North of Iraq, mainly in Kirkuk region and numbered 600 thousands in the 60 of XX century, but now totals up to 2,5 millions -is an essen- tial issue to study (30, 8; 83, 36, 53; 25,13)\n\nWe don't use the term \"Azerbaijani-speaking country\" coincidentally. Including \"The Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" (20,277), \"The Soviet Encyclopedic Dictionary\" (61,26), and the foreign sources show that there are Azerbaijanis living in Iraq.\n\nKarl Menges, a famous Turkologist writes in his book \"Turkic languages and Turkic nations\": \"Azerbaijanis also live in the north of Iraq. They are more than 100 thousands.\" (38, 12-13).\n\nProf. Jalal Ertuq, a Turkish researcher writes on this issue: \"2,5 million Turkman-Azerbaijanis live in Arbil and Kirkuk regions nowadays (28, 8)\". It should be noted that they inhabited compact mainly in Kirkuk country: Kirkuk city, Tuz Khurmau (gaza), Altun Korpu (nahiya), taze Khurmatu (nahiya), Bashir, Boyuk Hasar, Bilava Garabulaq, Gizilyar, Yayji, Yarvali, Yengija, Kerkuz, Kumbatlar, Leylan, omar Mandan, Tarjil, Gokteppe, Tisin, Tokhmakhli, Turkalan, Chardakhli, as well as \"Bayat koylari\" (Bayat villages), and Kifri (gaza), which includes 64 regions; Garateppe (nahiyya), Daquq (nahiyya), Abud, Jambur, Birauchili, Bastamli, Galkhanli, Garanaz, Amirli, Aski Kifri, Zangili, Yeshilteppe, Kahriz, Kingirban, Kotaburun, Lagum, Ashtokan, Priahmad, Sayyad, Suleyman beg (muratli), tel Manzil, Ushtepe, Khasadarli, Hasarli, Jabarli and other city, region and villages. Besides, they also live in Khanagin (gaza), Shahraban (gaza), Dalli Abbas (nahiya), Mandali (nahiya), Garaghan, Gizliarbat, Gizilja, Susuzbulag vilages, the regions Dilaya county, in Arbil city, the center of arbil county, tilafar gaza of Mosul county, Mosul city and also in Baghdad, the capital city of the country.\n\nIt should be noted that frequent changes are introduced to the administrative-territorial divisions of the country. For example, Tuz Khurmatu gaza, which was a part of Kirkuk county, now belongs to Salahaddin county, and Kifri gaza became adjacent to Diyala county. Some villages were either totally eliminated or adhered to some other villages.\n\nSome researchers consider that uniting the Turkman inhabited territories with arab inhabited territories carry political reasons (22, 17).\n\nAs in the past, they still call both themselves and us -Azerbaijanis \"Turkman\" (18; 29; 19; 9; 79).\n\nIt is important to point out that the notion \"Turkman\" which was widely used during the State of Atabeys, the State of Garagoyunlus, The State of Aghgoyunlus, The State of Safavid carried a different meaning from what it means today. Therefore Prof. A. Damirchizadeh writes in his book \"A History of Azerbaijani Literary Language\": \"At that time the notion \"Turkman\" carried a different meaning from what it does today. This is the reason why the Azerbaijanis living around Baghdad are called turkman (9, 72).\n\nThe conclusion of the study of the other sources completely affirms Prof. A. Damirchizadeh's opinion on this issue.\n\nAcademician V. Bartold writes that \"Kitabi-Dadam Gorgud\" (Book of My Grandfather Gorgud) belongs to \"Caucasian Turkmans\"-Azerbaijanis (32, 6).\n\nAccording to the history after Shamsaddin eldaniz conquered Azerbaijan and Iraq \"he overcame all the great leaders and suborinated most of them. He wiped out all the rebellious Turkman leaders\" (10, 45).\n\nThis term can be come across in the works of our poets Nasimi and Khatai:\n\nQrebin nitqi baglandı dilinden,\n\nSeni kimdir deyen kim, turkmansan?\n\nHow could the Arab dare to doubt you,\n\nTo overlook you, cause you are Turkman?\n\nNasimi\n\nGetdikce tükenir erebin kuyi-maskeni,\n\nBağdad icre her nece kim türkman qopar.\n\nThe Arabs lose their space,\n\nAs Turkmans make Baghdad home\n\nKhatai\n\nS. Longrig, an English historian writes that after taking control over Shirvan, Shah Ismayil Khatai smashed turkmans at the battle near Nakhichevan (32, 16).\n\nThe term \"Turkman\" is widely used in a Kirkuk researcher Ata Tarzibashi's researches as well. This well-known folklore scholar shows that the khoyrat (bayati) first emerged in the Turkman inhabited areas of Iraq, during the period of the State of Aghgoyunlu and the State of Garagoyunlu it gained fame and spread to Turkey, to the north of Iran, especially to Tabriz, where mostly Turkmans lived, and to the territory which used to be called Azeri or Azerbaijan ahr wab inhabited by Turkmans (19, 8; 64, 203).\n\nAcademician Ziya Bunyadov's book \"The State of Azerbaijan Atabeys\" includes some significant information about the notion \"Turkman\". Te book tells that Toghrul III and goes against his uncle Gizil Arslan. Gizil Arslan ruins the troop of Toghrul III and Izatdin Hasan, which was composed of Turkman. They run from the battlefield to Izzatdin Hasan's fortress - Karkhin, which was near Kirkuk (8, 84).\n\nHidayat Kamal Bayatli, Kirkuk scholar also discloses his own attitude to the issue: \"And a part of Iraq Turkmans, who are originally Azeri Turks, were immigrated to Iraq by Shah Ismayil Khatai in 1505-1524, the Christian calendar (22, 20).\n\nThere is no doubt that under the term \"Turkmans\", these scholars meant Azeris and Iraqi turkmans. It isnt't surprising that in his interview to \"Qardashliq\" magazine (Brotherhood), Heydar Aliyev, the late ex-President of Azerbaijan Republic stated his opinion on this issue: \"Exploring the history, I came to believe that Southern Azerbaijan, Northern Azerbaijan and Iraqi-Turkmans are the parts of a whole\" (20, 4).\n\nAn important point should be noted out here. The matter is that some researchers used the term \"Turkman\" and some \"Turkmen\". While Ata Tarzibashi, Shakir Sabir Zabit, Ibrahim Daquqi, Rza Damirchi, Sinan Said, Movlud Taha Gayachi and some other wellknown Iraqi scholars used the term \"Turkman\", lately A. Benderoghlu prefers the term \"Turkmen\". This notion was referred as \"Turkmen\" in the books published by \"The Department of Turkmen Culture\" and in the newspaper \"Yurd\" (Motherland) both of which lead by him. Although before the researcher used the term \"Turkman\" in his books \"a Step in the Iraqi-Turkman literature\", and \"Turkmans in Revolutionary Iraq\", while editing our book \"Iraqi-Turkman Folklora\" (56), he ewplained that since Arabs also use \"Turkman\", he prefers the term \"Turkamen\" for the sake of differentiation. True, Arabs also spell this term as \"Turkman\", however A. Benderoghlu's point is wrong and harmful. Because modifying the term \"Turkman\", which was originated at the period of \"Kitabi-Dadam Gorgud\" (The Book of My Grandfather Gorgud), this way is not acceptable.\n\nİn the meantime, Prof. F. Zeynalov and Prof. S. Alizadeh, the researchers of \"Dada Gorgud\" write: \"It is an important fact that in the Drezden version this word is pronounced as 'Turkman'. It is obvious that Turkmans, the Azerbaijanis living in Iraq - are the population inhabited in Kirkuk (32, 250).\n\nProf. Mahir Nagib, a researcher from Kirkuk paid a special attention to this issue in his article \"A work for a Devotee\", which was translated into Ottoman Turkish and addressed to our book \"Iraqi-Turkman Folklora\", published in Turkey: \"A reader will notice that honored G. Pashayev is differentiating 'Turkmen' from 'Turkman'. Even the Azeri version of the book is called 'Iraqi-Turkman Folklora'. G. Pashayev's conclusion, which benefited from various sources should be supported. But the term Turkman is out of use in Turkey and Iraqi Turks are referred as 'Turkmen', that's why we had to use the term 'Turkmen'\" (57, 12).\n\nOne can see, Prof. Mahir Nagib also supports the idea of using the term \"Turkman\".\n\nFortunately, A. Benderoghlu realized his mistake and starting from 2003 he is using the term \"Turkman\" in his newspaper \"Yurd\" and other publications.\n\nNote that there is a dispute among the researchers over the etymology of the term \"Turkman\". Since XI century this term was referred as \"Turkmanand\" in the Persian and Tajic sources, which is translated into Turkish as \"Turk\" and \"Manand\" - alike (in Persian), so it means \"Turkishlike\" (1, 76; 71, 176-17; 29, 24). For Abulgaüzi, as common people couldn't pronounce \"Turkmanand\", they used the term \"Turkman\" (1, 76).\n\nSome other sources show that since they were interpreting between the Arabs and Turks, who didn't know Arabic, they were referred as \"tarjuman\" (translator), and as the time went on, the word was used as \"Turkman\" (24, 9).\n\nSome other researchers believe that Turk+man, Turk+men means \"Turkic person\", \"Turkic soldier\" (16, 18-19).\n\nAs known, semi-nomadic Turkman used to be called Tarakama. Since the notions of \"Oghuz\" and \"Turkman\" fall into the same ethnic category, Abulgazi Bahadir Khan Khivali, one of the first few experts, who talked about \"Dada Gorgud\" boys (chapters), brought this issue onto the table in his work \"Shajareyi-Tarakima\" (Genealogy of Tarakima) (1; 30).\n\nIt is possible to consider that \"Turkman\" is derived from \"Tarakimun\", the incorrect plural form of \"Tarakama\" in Arabic (33, 27).\n\nBut we credit the researchers, who explain the word \"man\" as magnificence, greatness, purity, reality, greatness, and strength (24, 10). If we take into consideration that the term Turkman existed for a long time, its being used in the meanings of \"Great Turk\", \"Majestic Turk\", \"Mighty Turk\", \"Real Turk\" sounds natural.\n\nThe use of \"man\" in the meanings of great, heavenly, grand in the words; gojaman (experienced person), azman (a giant person), ataman (a sharp person), shishman (an overweight person), kechaman (a big lizard) in both Azerbaijani and Kirkuk dialect also supports this idea.\n\nWe have to mention that there are fundamental differences between the Iraqi-Turkmen dialect and the Turkmen language in the Central Asia. In Turkmen language initial length of vowels are widespread and it changes the words' meanings. For example: bas (head); baas - yara (bruise), qor (see), qoor (grave) etc. This is characteristic neither for Azeri language nor Kirkuk dialect. In dental sounds. The are found in Arabic and English, as well as in Turkmen language. But there are no such sounds in Turkman dialect and Azerbaijani.\n\nThe sound g, which is widely used in both Azeri and Iraqi-Turkman dialect, is not available in Turkmen language. While Turkmen language distinguishes itself in some other cases as well, the phonetic structure of Azeri language and Iraqi-Turkman dialect coincide (52, 14-16; 82, 355; 53)\n\nTherefore A. Benderoghlu, the Iraqi researcher writes: \"Iraqi-Turkman dialect corresponds to Azerbaijani language. But there are small differences in Iraqi-Turkman dialect. They are almost unremarkable and shouldn't be considered something major\" (7, 14).\n\nInterestingly, in 1995, the world-wide famous Prof. Ihsan Doghramaji, who is originally from Arbil, was giving continuous speech in Arbil dialect, more precisely in Azerbaijani in the Academy of Sciences, but he sensed that the guests from Turkey didn't understand him well enough, and suddenly he turned to the president of the Academy: \"If you don't mind, I'd talk to the guests from Turkey in their own dialect about our academy.\" (30, 149).\n\nWhen the TV correspondent asked him: \"How do you feel about celebrating your 80th jubilee in your second motherland - Azerbaijan?\" - Doghramaji gave a polysemantic and well-thought answer: \"Azerbaijan isnt't my second motherland. It is one of my two motherlands. There is nothing more natural and more real than celebrating your birthday in your own motherland\" (30, 153).\n\nAs one can see, rightfully Ihsan Doghramaji considers Azerbaijan his own motherland and Azerbaijani language his mother tongue.\n\nDoubtlessly, we are the parts of a whole and therefore although we consider Nasimi and Fizuli our own, and they think of these poets as Iraqi-Turkman poets, none of us contradicts the other on this issue.\n\nPerhaps this is the reason that Nizami was introduced as Iraqi poet in his books, \"Khosrov and Shirin\" (1934), \"Treasure of Secrets\" (1934), \"Seven Beaties\" (1937), \"Igbalname\" (1939), which were published in Tehran, in Persian in the first part of the 20th century and are on display at the permanent exposition of Nizami Ganjavi in the Museum of Azerbaijan Literature. Only in the book \"Leyli and Majnun\" (1939) he was introduced as Iraqi-Ajam poet.\n\nAll these are telling us about a nation, whose fate subjected to scattering in the difficult terms of life. Fazil Hussein and Sinan Said, the Kirkuk researchers note that, first time the issue of this elat's being Turkman and speaking Azerbaijani turned to a subject of discussion in the first part of XX century, when the fate of Mosul county became subject to question while the Ottoman rule ended in Iraq and Iraq turned into a colony of England. The Turkish government considered them Turkish, but the England insisted that they were Turkmans. The English government proved that this elat didn't belong to Ottoman, their dialect wasn't similar to Turkish language, but to Azerbaijani language. England believed that territory long before the emergence of the Ottoman Empire (13, 93-99; 64, 35).\n\nFrom this point the representative of the \"East-India\" company, Edmonds' travel to the Turkman inhabited territory in 1820 is interesting: \"We arrived in Guruchay (Dry river) at 8.20. There were the tents of Bayat Turkmans' here. Hasan bey, the head of the ashirat (tribe), who sometimes was referred as \"Garagush bey\" (Eagle bey) invited me to have meal. He was well aware of the existence of the ashirat (tribe/elat) of Boyuk (Great) Bayat in Khurasan, but he couldn't define the exact date, when this branch of the ashirat moved to this country\" (14, 267).\n\nWe come across various historical facts about Iraqi Turkmans' origin and their settling date in Iraq. Many researchers believe that they moved from Azerbaijan.\n\nWe also think that, starting from early Middle Ages till the middle of the 16th century and afterwads in certain periods we lived together with Iraqi-Turkmans in the same territory, under the same power, but because of certain social-political reasons we had to split. As a number of substantial researches have come out lately on the history of Iraqi-Turkmans and Azerbaijan, we become more convinced in our conclusion (66; 10; 68; 37; 38; 24).\n\nIn the meantime, we don't reject the fact that the bloody wars, political interests and other reasonscaused some other streams of movement as well. Moreover, this took place in both directions. As Abulgazi Bahadir Khan states, thousands of Turkman families left Iraw and came to Shamakhi (1, 99).\n\nTabari, the Arabic historian and Prof. Subhi Saatchi think that the first movement of Turks to Iraq happened in 45, the Hijri calender (76a, 167; 68, 20).\n\nProf. S. Buluch, the Turkish scholar, also writes about this issue: \"In the first centuries of the Hijri calendar Azerbaijani Turks passed through Tabriz-Sultaniyya and settled down in Kirkuk\" (58, 109).\n\nShakir Sabir, the Kirkuk researcher thinks that their movement to Iraq started in VII century and they already forme their own blocks in Iraq in 745, the christian calendar (72, 37, 39).\n\nIbn-al-Asir, the Arabic historian of the 12th-13th centuries writes: \"Many Azerbaijani Turks led by Abu Mansur Baktash and Abu Ali İbn Dahgan moved to Iraq and settled down in Tilafar, Mosul and the neighbouring areas\" (26, 136).\n\nMustafa Javad, a well-known Iraqi researcher writes in his book \"The History of Turks in Iraq\" that Turks' movemen to Iraq started in the year of 32 in the Hijri calendar and divides this movement into seven stages. İn the period of Amavis, especially Abbasis Turks's being incomparably good at shooting, brave in battles, tolerant to the hordship brought high prestige to them, strengthened their position and made them the dirivin force in Iraq. In Mustafa Javad's categorization Saljug period falls into the fourth stage and in this period thousands of Oghuz Turks entered and settled in Iraq, formed Turkman khanates, and other khanates such as Artiglilar in Mardin, Atabeys in Mosul, Zeynalabdins in Arbil, Gipchags in Kirkuk, Gara (Literally: Dark/Black, Means: Great) Aslanlis in Diyarbakr, and the khanates in Daghistan and Azerbaijan. According to the researchers' writings, the bayat tiribes inhabited around Gara Tapa (Black Hill) and Daquq entered Iraq in the fourth stage. The rule of Teymuris and Jalairs marks the beginning of the fifth stage. Mustafa Javad categorizes the period of the State of Garagoyunlu and the State of Aghgoyunlu in the sixtth stage. The seventh stage consists of the period of the State of Safavid (46).\n\nProf. Subhi Saatchi divides these movements into seven stages and calls the last stage \"Ottoman Period\" (62, 31-106).\n\nAccording to Ershad Hormuzlu, a Kirkuk researcher, the biggest movement of Turkmans to Iraq happened during Toghrul bey's authority (1040-1063). In the Christian year of 1055 they numbered even more. As the continuous stream of Turkmans to Iraq turned to a Turkic-speaking area (24, 25).\n\nIt is undeniable that starting from the date that Shamsaddin Eldaniz took over the control in 1136 and afterwards during the periods of his predecessors; sons - Mahammad Jahan Pahlavan and Gizil Arslan, the relations with Iraq tightened (74, 53-58, 59).\n\nDuring Shamsaddin eldaniz's period the state and troop of Iraq and Azerbaijan united under the same power and the nation lived in peace (66, 127). He used to rotate between Azerbaijan and Iraq back and forth. His trip to Iraq ended in 1175, and after a while upon his return to Azerbaijan, died in Nakhichevan. And Jahan Pahlavan and Gizil Arslan became executive authorities of Iraq, Azerbaijan, Arran, Rey, Isfahan, Hamadan and other counties (10, 74). Daquq, Arbil, Kirkuk and other places that inhabited by Turkman, and Ganja, Nakhichevan, Tabriz and other cities were united under the same power during the period of the State of Atabeys (10, 234, 238; 66, 134).\n\nStarting from the execution of the last Abbasi khalifa in 1258 all the neighbouring cities and villages including Baghdad turned to Azerbaijan's county and accept its authority (8, 73). Since that period the connection between the Azerbaijanis living in Bahgdad, Kirkuk, Mosul and Arbil and the Northern and Southern Azerbaijan grew closer. This relation becomes even stronger during the periods of Jalairs in XIV century, and the State of Garagoyunlu and the State of Aghgoyunlu in XV century. The territory of the State of Garagoyunlu included Azerbaijan, Armenia, Western Iran, Iraq, Kurdustan, etc. The capital was Tabriz. The major cities were Tabriz, Maragha, Ardabil, Nakhichevan, Ganja, Baghdad, Arzinjan etc (4, 54). During the period of the State of aghgoyunlu, especially during the power of Uzun (Tall) Hasan the borders extended till the Kur River, Garabagh County, Arab-Iraq, Acami-Iraq, the borders of Persia and Khurasan including Arzinjan etc (23, 221; 27, 81; 28, 62; 36, 3; 37, 97, 172).\n\nTherefore in his letter to te European states Uzun Hassan indicated with especial emphasis: \"...Iraq, all of the Persia till the doors of India, ... Mazandaran, Gilan, ... Azerbaijan, Baghdad - all these belong to me. I am the ruler of these territories\" (37, 103).\n\nInterestingly, S. Longrig, the English researcher writes that during the rule of Uzun Hasan the capital of the countr, was Tabriz in summer and Baghdad in winter (32, 20).\n\nAs his grandfather Uzun Hassan, Shah Ismail Khatai also aimed to unite Azerbaijan and Iraq under the same power and reinstate the united Azerbaijan. His capturing Baghdad in 1506 with this purpose made Ottoman Empire very restless. Ottoman Empire was cautious about the growth of Safavid. For this reason it launched a war against Safavids with a great force and overcame in the famous battle, Chaldiran (38, 143). This defeat caused an incredible anount of losses to Safavids. One of them was the loss of Baghdad.\n\nAfterwards Azerbaijani rulers attempted to take Baghdad back by all means (38, 143). From this standpoint the facts by Shakir Sabir, the Kirkuk researcher and A. Mammadov, an Azeri scholar are quite attractive. Prince Bayazid joins a revolt against his father Sultan Suleyman of a refuge. Sultan Suleyman promises a great amount of gifts to Safavid to have his son bak for execution. Shah (King) Tahmasib puts a condition that Baghdad should be annexed to Azerbaijan again (36, 78). But Sultan (King) Suleyman doesn't accept this condition.\n\nIn the war of 1533-1535, between Azerbaijan and Turkey, Azerbaijan lost all Iraqi territories including Baghdad (38, 161, 162).\n\nBut starting from Shah Abbas's rule, in a timeframe from 1623 to 1638, Baghdad, kirkuk and other places were united under the Safavid authority, but again in 1638 the Ottoman authority took control over these territories (71, 85; 36, 3; 24, 30) and from 1732 to 1743 the control was switched between the Ottoman Empire and Azerbaijan back and forth. During 1734-1746, these territories were totolly under the control of Azerbaijan, but as Longrig, English historian writes, in 1746 Baghdad, Mosul, Kirkuk and other cities lost khan (referring to Azerbaijani authority) and gained sultan (referring to Ottoman authority) forever (32, 20).\n\nAfterwards our connection with Iraq came down to almost nothing. Therefore Azerbaijani rulers attempted to gain back the tribes taht inhabited in Iraq. Mirza Jamal Javanshir writes on this occasion: \"After Nadir Shah was assassinated in 1747, Panah Khan along with his accompanists went till Iraq and Azerbaijan borders to welcome the Garabagh people... Their visit ended up with failure\" (29, 14-15).\n\nIt should be mentioned that not only Garabagh tribes, but also other Azerbaijani tribes from both south and north inhabited here.\n\nAt the end the quoted sources have been given in an alphabetical order. As seen we have used code. The first figure indicates the source, the second indicates the page. Between them there is a cçomma. Sources have been separated by semicolon.\n\nAfter the connections broke, the people in Iraq expressed their complaints about the broken relations, the longing in the khoyrats (bayatis) like this :\n\nEslim Qarabağlıdı,\n\nSinem çarpaz dağlıdı.\n\nKesilib gelib-geden,\n\nDeme yollar bağlıdı.\n\nBağdad yolu Gencedi,\n\nGülü pence-pencedi,\n\nDeme sizden iragam,\n\nBu sevda ölüncedi ve s.\n\nI am from Garabagh,\n\nMy soul is hurt.\n\nNobady comes and goes,\n\nThe connections turned out to be cut off.\n\nRoad to Baghdad goes through Ganja, It has fully-blossomed flowers, Don't say that we are apart, This love is forever, etc.\n\nBut neither the broken relations, nor the long-lived years of separation could influence the language and the folklore of this elat. Although the Ottoman Turkish language was accepted as the literary language at that time, the spoken language and the folklore closely reflects Azerbaijani language and folklore (69, 14; 22, 329).\n\nWe don't intend to confront the Turkic languages that are very close. But at the same time, we have to accept the fact that Turkish, Azeri and Iraqi researchers, who did a deep study of Iraqi-Turkman folklore and are very well aware of Kirkuk dialect and folklore affirm that the dialect of this people coincides with Azeri language. Their folklore and folk songs, which share the same roots, are identical (6, 147-152; 18, 26; 45, 56-66, 44, 6; 42, 86-96; 54, 64-68; 55, 3-26; 69, 11-14; 71, 203; 9, 14; 36, 11; 2, 329).\n\nFuad Koprulu, a Turkish researcher writes with confidence: \"Iraqi-Turkmans - The Turks who speak in azeri dialect of Oghuz...\".\n\nAmir Asim, the head of the Foundation of the Turkic Language, read the first part of the book \"Selected khoyrtas of Kirkuk\", published by Kirkuk researcher Molla Sabir, (Baghdad, 1951) wrote an acknowledgement to the second part, where he stated: \"These folk poems, which resemble very typical patterns in Azeri dialect, include words and expessions that are very close to ours\" (45, 57).\n\nVahabi Ashgun, a Turkish scholar wrote an acknowledgement to the second part of molla Sabir's book and mentioned rightfully: \"As the first book, this book is also in Azeri dialect\" (45, 47).\n\nMir oghlu Jamil, the Turkish counselor to Belgrade, read Molla Sabir's book and wrote: \"Sabir bey's book \"The selected Kirkuk khoyrats\" birings an unquestionable fact to the surface that the language is totally the same with the Azeri dialect, which is the closest one to Turkish, the Western Turkic. (45, 140).\n\nFrom this point, the thoughts of ata Tarzibashi, the Kirkuk researcher are also worth paying attention: \"Our Turkman dialect is much closer to Azeri dialect than Turkish language, and even perhaps thye are twin sisters. Regardless the fact that they split for various kinds of reasons and lived a long history without any connections, there ara not remarkable differences in thees dialects\" (78, 26).\n\nProf. Hidayat Kamal Bayatly also came to a reasonable conclusion in his book \"Turkic dialact of Iraqi-Turkmans\": \"The dialect that Iraqi-turkmans use, is identicall to Azeri dialect. Geographically, Azeri dialect embraces Eastern Anadolu, Kirkuk (Iraq) and Suriya Turks. From the folklore point, it is the richest Turkic dialect with numerous variations\" (21, 329).\n\nProf. H. Mirzazadeh, a well-known scholar on the history of Azerbaijani language, also affirms this conclusion in his serious article \"Some Considerations About the Language of the Azerbaijanis living in Iraq\" (42, 86, 96).\n\nInterestingly, the history of literary language of Azerbaijan indicates that our literary language included numerous elements of the dialects of Southern Azerbaijan and Baghdad (Kirkuk) in XV-XVI centuries, and Kirkuk dialect was categorized in the Southern branch and dialects of Azerbaijani language (12, 37; 13, 43; 62, 17; 42, 85).\n\nBy the way, since the phonetic and lexical parameters of Azerbaijani languag correspond with those of southern and Eastern dialects, some of the researchers of \"Kitabi-Dadam Gorgud\", V. Bartold, F. Koprulu, A. Dilachar, M. Ergin consider that as Bartold says \"it belongs to Caucasian Turks\" (32, 6, 10, 13). O. Gogyay, M. Ergin, Y. Yakubovski, H. Arasli, M. Tahmasib, A. Damirchizadeh, S. Jamshidov, Kh. Koroghlu and others believe that the Dresden copy of the book was entirely created in Azerbaijan (32, 10, 19).\n\nDoubtlessly, we can tell that for centuries Iraqi-Turkmans had to survive by themselves surrounded with other nations, so that they preserved the old lexical and phonetic characteristic features of their language and therefore their language reflects the peculiarities of \"Kitabi-Dadam Gorgud\". Tens of words, which were used in the \"Kitabi-Dadam Gorgud\", are still in use in Kirkuk dialect, precisely, the same words still carry the same meaning and this is an apt proof. For example: kapanak (yapıncı-felt cloak), xerxız (oğru-thief), ekmek (çörek-bread), ense (arxa-back, backside), qalavuz (beledçi-guide), qısraq (at, madyan-horse), yayan (piyada - pedestrian), nesne (eşya, alet-thing), semiz (kök-root), sığır (buğa, cönge-bull), mavlamaq (huşunu itirmek-to faint), qanara (çarmıx-crucifix), borı çalmaq (şeypur çalmaq-to play trumpet), davul döğmek (tebil çalmaq-to play the drum), ismarlamaq (tapşırmaq-to charge, to commission), yarın (sabah-tomorrow), ög (önfront), xoyrad (qaba, kobud, nadanqrude, impolite, ignorant), yağmalamaq (talamaq-o plunder, to rob), qavat (alçaq, eskik adam-ignoble person), oda (otaq-room), imdi (indi-now), baş üzerinde (baş üste!-all right, no problem expression to say yes), qaum-qardash (qohum-qardaş-literal: the relateive-the brother (means: close people)), kelisa (kilse-church), iyi (gözel-nice), kendi (özü-oneself) etc. In relation with Gorgud, Abulgazi Khan says: \"Goul Ergi Khan offered Gorgud to sit at tor/tour in the place of honour\" - at the head of gathering (1, 79). It is interesting that this word as \"Dor//dour\" is used in Turkmani even today.\n\nTherefore, Azerbaijani researchers consider the \"Kitabi-Dadam Gorgud\" \"the ancestor of Azerbaijani folk and written literature\" (32, 5), and at the same time, Ata Tarzibashi, the Kirkuk researcher, calls it the \"mother book\" of Iraqi-Turkmans.\n\nThe fact should be added that, the linguists, such as P. Melioranski (40, 16, 18), M. Shiraliyev (75, 11), N. Baskakov (7, 9, 56), A. Sherbak (73, 27), H. Mirzazadeh (43, 20), E. Najip (49, 30), A. Orujov (50, 9), Y. Shirvani (76, 16) and others, state that since the \"Dictionary of Ibn-Muhanna\", which belongs to the late XIII, the early XIV centuries, is in old Azerbaijani, it should have been written either in Azerbaijan, or in Iraq territory.\n\nProf. Mahir Nagib, an Iraqi-Turkman researcher affirms the shared roots of the music in his book \"Categorization and Analysis of kirkuk Turk Folk Music: \"The distance between the borders couldn't deteriorate the saherd roots of Kirkuk Turk folk music and Azerbaijani Turk folk music\" (36,11). Researcher Subhi Saatchi is of the same opinion (70).\n\nThis closeness, identicalness is sharply visible in the place names as well: these place names - Aghdam, Aghdash, Agsu, Billava, Boyat, Guruchay, Garabulag, Garaqoyunlu, Garadagh, Garabaghli, Amirli, Yaychi, Yengica, Mandili, Mardinli, Uchtapa, Khasa, Khasadarli, Chardaghli, etc. - are common for both Northern Azerbaijan and Kirkuk. As in Baku, there is \"Shirvan Fortress\" near kifri. This palace was indicated as a historical monument of Iraqi-Turkmans in the map of Iraq published in Bahgdad in 1961. Still there is a block called \"Garabaghli\" in Kirkuk. The Iraqi scholars insist that \"Garabaghli\" or from Azerbaijan - from Garabagh region. As well the folklore introduces so many similar facts.\n\nSinan Said, a scholar from Kirkuk, who did research on \"Arzu-Gambar\" the famous Iraqi-Turkman epic, thinks that this is a funda-mental work, a document that can be referred to learn their dialect, to define their identity, the researcher brings this piece as an example :\n\nArzum endi bulağa,\n\nSesi geldi qulağa.\n\nArzuya peşkeş olsun\n\nŞirvan, Tebriz, Marağa.\n\nMy Arzu went down to the spring, Her voice was heard.\n\nLet Shirvan, Tabriz, Maragha\n\nBe sacrificed/gifted to Arzu.\n\nand writes: \"These lines are enough to decide where and by who the epos is originated\" (59). In the Tuz Khurmatu version of the epos the events take place by the Araz River :\n\nQuruyasan, ey Araz,\n\nElimizden düşdü saz.\n\nQemberi çay apardı,\n\nYetiş, ey Xızır İlyas (60, 376)\n\nDamn you, hey Araz,\n\nWe dropped our saz.\n\nThe river curried away Gambar,\n\nPlease, come help, hey Khizir Ilyaz (60, 376).\n\nThis piece itself is an apt fact of our shared roots.\n\nProf. Subhi Saatchi, who did a substantial work on exploring and advocating Iraqi-Turkman moral values, also stated his personal opinion about this historical issue: \"If we explore the colorful folklore and oral literature, we will witness that Kirkuk dialect carries the motives of Azeri Turkic\". If we study the customs and traditions of Azarbaijanis living either in the North or the South, we will witness that Kirkuk folk literature derives from the same source. This similarity and identicalness resembles in every example - from lullabies to riddles\" (63, 11, 13-14).\n\nAs mentioned above, many Azerbaijani and Iraqi-Turkman scholars share the same opinion. İn that case, is there any need to study the folklore of Iraqi-turkman separately? If we take into consideration that till the first quarter of XVI century Kirkuk was under Azerbaijan's authority and as Subhi Saatchi, the Iraqi researcher says, \"Till the 16th century all of the publications in Iraq were in Azeri Turkic\" (63, 14), we will witness a great need to study this elat's folklore deeply, who had to live apart from its roots for centuries.\n\nBy the way, note that two terms are used in Kirkuk sources - Kirkuk folklore and Iraqi-Turkman folklore. Both terms refer to the folklore of all Iraqi-Turkman community living in Iraq. It should be considered normal. Becaues the term \"Darband folklore\" or \"Nakhichevan folklore\" refers to the folklore of the people living in the surounding areas of relatively Darband and Nakhichevan as well. Accordingly, Kirkuk folklore refers the folklore of the people, who inhabited of the people living in the neighbouring villages and regions. That's why the readers will observe use of the both terms throughout the books of author.\n\nGathering, publishing and conducting research of Iraqi-Turkman folklore started in the middle of XX century. Ata Tarzibashi, Molla Sabir, Shakir Sabir Zabit, Mohammad Khurshid, Abdullatif Benderoghlu, Ibrahim Daquqi, Ihsan Vasfi, Subhi Saatchi, Mahir Nagip and others are the first remembered ones when the subject comes on to the scholars who collected this spiritual treasure, which was created and passed over to the following generations for centuries, and immortalized them in books, the greatest invention of humanity. As you look through the books that they complied with great difficulties, and published mostly at their own expense, you recall V. Beilinsky's words: \"The hard work of the modest and honest people, who collected the invaluable pieces of folklore with paintstakingly stubbornness and endess efforts and didn't let them be forgotten and destroyed, should meet the fullest gratitude and appreciation\" (6, 109).\n\nThe folklore pieces they collected were first published in the newspapers \"Kirkuk\", \"Afag\", \"Bashir\", \"Iraq\", \"Yurd\" and the magazine \"Qardashliq-Brotherhood\", and these materials all together turned to a substantial source for any researcher to refer to. The proverbs and aphorisms, khoyrat and manis (a kind of bayati), folk songs, ceremonies, jokes (anecdotes), believes, proys, curses and other patterns were included in \"The Selected Khoyrats of Kirkuk\" by Molla Sabir, \"Khoyrats and Manis in Kirkuk\" by Habib Sevimlin, \"Social Life in Kirkuk\", \"Proverbs in Kirkuk Dialect\" by Shakir Sabir, \"Khoyrats and Manis in Kirkuk\", \"Kirkuk Songs\", \"Invaluable Kirkuk words\" by Ata Tarzibashi, \"Iraqi-Turkmans, Their Language, History and Literature\" by Ibrahim Daquqi, \"A Step in the Literature of Iraqi-Turkman\", and \"Our Proverbs\" by Abdullatif Benderoghlu, \"Iraqi Turkmans\", \"Kirkuk Children Folklora\" and \"Folk Songs of kirkuk\" by Subhi Saatchi, \"Aphorisms and Proverbs of Iraqi-Turkmans\" by Mahir Nagib and other books. The activities in this sphere weren't limited only to collecting the folklore pieces and publishing books but also the attempts were made at conducting scientific research on the certain genres of Iraqi-Turkman folklore. Ata Tarzibashi's research on khoyrats, manis, and folk music is worth paying great attention.\n\nBut still the Iraqi-Turkman folklore is not entrely explored. It is the first attempt to analyze it systematically. The Iraq-Turkmani researcher A. Benderoghlu's opinion, who wrote the acknowledgement to our monograph \"Iraqi-Turkman Folklora\", supports this idea: \"Until now such a research of a substantial, detailed context has never been conducted either in Iraq by Turkmans or in Azerbaijan or in Turkey\" (52, 4).\n\nTrue, many genres and patterns of Iraq-Turkman folklore become subject to research for the first time. The main sources of our research were the books on Iraqi-Turkman folklore, the publications that we listed above, and the patterns, which we recorded in five tapes, each of which lasted for an hour and a half, and the examples we wrote down in several large notepads or more than a thousand pages each during our long-term visits to Iraq in 1962-1966 and 1972-1975.\n\nThe early genres, the people's ceremonies and music, the bayatiriddles, the lullabies, the tales, the jokes, the riddles, and the proverbs of the Iraqi-Turkman folklore are being explored scientifically for the first time. Among these genres bayati-riddles and lullabies have not been studied as independent genres in our Folklora studies - the former entirely and the latter partially.\n\nThe mutual relations of the azerbaijani and Iraqi-Turkman folklores were brought to light through parallels, comparisons of the patterns that derived from the same root and the categorization of the current genres were done through the latest achievements of the folklore studies (5; 34; 47; 48; 57; 58; 59; 61; 80; 81), etc.\n\nWhile talking about the importance of this study, it should be mentioned that, the thorough study of certain critical issues such as our history of aesthetic thought etc.\n\nIraqi-Turkman folklore is such a treasure that it reflects all the nuances of the nation's language and every single person who is in love with his nation can find invaluable pearls in this treasure. There is closeness, identicalness to Azerbaijan Folklora in every layer of this treasure of the nation's wisdom. We are blessed becaues the nation didn't part in its consciousness, thoughts, and mentality! After all a stone gets crumbled and ruins, a rock becomes tumbledown and ruins, a spring dries, a river gets thinner and cuts off. And a nation forgets and disappears (17, 4).\n\nBut still there is a bright reality, which consoles one. As Irmag, Iraq-Turkmani, writes: \"The motherland's territory can expand or diminish, its borders can extinguish, its history can be falsified, even its honor can be offended, its religion can be converted. But one thing never changes. This is mother tongue\" (19).\n\nAs you see, there are two principal existences in life - folklore and language, which never disappear carry undeniable historical facts about a nation. We think this is the literary-historical value of the Iraqi-Turkman folklore in the first place.\n\nHISTORICAL AND PHILOLOGICAL SOURCES QUOTED :\n\n1. Abulgazi Bahadir Khan.
