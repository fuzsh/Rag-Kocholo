        "text": "Since October 9, former member of the Azerbaijan national judo team, silver medalist of the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, Rustam Orujov has been training at the prestigious and elite judo club of Japan, \"Park-24\".\n\nIdman.biz informs that the main goal of the training is to learn the art of coaching with every detail.\n\nMembers of the first team of the Japanese national team train there. The main goal of the training program is to improve training techniques, form training programs and develop training strategies adapted for different age groups.\n\nRustam Orujov got acquainted with the activities and exercises of clubs, institutes and sports organizations located in various cities of Japan.\n\n\"Judo is treated in a unique way here. Structures and teaching systems are different. Now I understand better why the Japanese are so strong. They follow a strict regimen and undergo intensive physical training. The Japanese are very interested in Azerbaijani judo, and the athletes here are eager to train with me. After returning to Azerbaijan, I will share my experience during my stay here,\" said Rustam Orujov.\n\nIt should be noted that the training will continue until November 7."
