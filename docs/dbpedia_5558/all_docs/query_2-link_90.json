        "text": "Central Asia and the Caucasus\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Union, a number of linkages have been established between newly independent Central Asian states, or populations within them, and diaspora ethnic groups. This book explores the roles that diaspora communities play in the recent and ongoing emergence of national identities in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The loyalties of these communities are divided between their countries of residence and those states that serve as homeland of their particular ethno-cultural nation, and are further complicated by connections with contested transnational notions of common cultures and “peoples.” Written by highly respected experts in the ﬁeld, the book addresses issues such as nationalism, conﬂict, population movement, global civil society, Muslim communities in China and relations between the new nation-states and Russia. This innovative book will interest students and researchers of transnationalism and Central Asian studies.

Today myriad systems of relationship, exchange and mobility function intensively and in real time while being spread across the world. New technologies, especially involving telecommunications, serve to connect such networks. Despite great distances and notwithstanding the presence of international borders (and all the laws, regulations and national narratives they represent), many forms of association have been globally intensiﬁed and now take place paradoxically in a planetspanning yet common arena of activity. In some instances transnational forms and processes serve to speed-up or exacerbate historical patterns of activity, in others they represent arguably new forms of human interaction. Transnational practices and their consequent conﬁgurations of power are shaping the world of the twentyﬁrst century. This book forms part of a series of volumes concerned with describing and analyzing a range of phenomena surrounding this ﬁeld. Serving to ground theory and research on “globalization”, the Routledge book series on “Transnationalism” offers the latest empirical studies and ground-breaking theoretical works on contemporary socio-economic, political and cultural processes which span international boundaries. Contributions to the series are drawn from Sociology, Economics, Anthropology, Politics, Geography, International Relations, Business Studies and Cultural Studies. The series is associated with the Transnational Communities Research Programme of the Economic and Social Research Council (see http://www. transcomm.ox.ac.uk). The series consists of two strands: Transnationalism aims to address the needs of students and teachers and these titles will be published in hardback and paperback.

The volume focuses on contemporary and historical aspects of the areas and polities that constitute the regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia.1 The end of Soviet hegemony led to the emergence of new nation-states that had their formal beginnings as artiﬁcial polities created under Soviet policies. Along with Afghanistan, these ﬂedgling states have been struggling with the conundrums of national identity amid complex population mixes and competing local and transnational ethnic, religious, and political afﬁliations. Moreover, various globalizing forces are bringing great pressures to bear on the region’s constituent parts, vying among them for cultural afﬁliations, strategic zones of interest, and economic introgression. Central Asia’s propinquity to Russia and China’s Muslim populations, and to Iran and Pakistan, heightens the region’s political signiﬁcance; and as a vat of natural resources, including gas, oil, and gold, it has attracted intense interest from multinational capital. Even some of the region’s vast depopulated surfaces are of great moment – Russia’s missile program and nuclear industry are both deeply if now contingently engaged in Kazakhstan. The September 11th, 2001, attacks on the USA and their aftermath suddenly thrust the region further to the front of the world stage. Scholars, and the policy makers who depend on their work, are now struggling to sort out the region’s many-layered complexities. They have few published sources, however, which analyze the new post-Soviet realities. And those recent works that do address the region tend to focus on an individual political/geographic entity rather than on the dynamics among transnational forces within and beyond the region. The 2002 “Currents, Cross-Currents and Conﬂict” conference at the University of California, Berkeley, explored the roles diaspora communities play in the (re)emergence of identities in contemporary Central Asia and the Caucasus. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, a number of linkages have been established between the newly independent states, or populations within them, and diaspora ethnic groups. As mentioned by King and Melvin,2 the loyalties of these diaspora groups are divided between their countries of residence and those new states that\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nserve as the homeland of their particular, distinct ethno-cultural nation, and are further complicated by connections with contested transnational notions of common cultures and “peoples.” Related phenomena are to be found in the cobbled world of Afghanistan and in an extremely restive Xinjiang province in China. These transnational linkages operate both into and out of the region. For example, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, millions of self-identiﬁed Russians found themselves living on non-Russian territory in Central Asia. In order to maintain their social and economic positions in the new republics, they seek to play a direct part in Russian politics towards the region, as well as in local and inter-regional politics. Conversely, a number of factors have contributed to an exodus of large numbers from the Russian population in the Central Asian republics: indigenization; political reassertion by titular nationalities; ethnocultural resurgence; concerns about their economic viability in the new political dispensation; newly signiﬁcant language barriers, and so on.3 Another variety of transnational diaspora phenomena can be seen in the example of the Kazakhs. Kazakhstan was the only Soviet Central Asian state with a majority Russian population. During the post-Soviet transition, the new Kazakh government looked to Kazakh communities abroad, hoping to entice many to return to create a numerical majority in the Kazakh state. Links were formed with Kazakh communities in China, Russia, Turkey, and Iran, and speciﬁc policies were established to encourage a return to an identiﬁed “homeland.” Transnational diasporas operate in the other direction as well. By the time the USSR collapsed, distinct ethnic Uighur communities had established themselves in several different countries and republics. Although for the most part these communities had been isolated from one another, they began to ﬁnd a new unity in their relationship to their home region, Xinjiang (China). The Chinese state has become very apprehensive about the role these diaspora communities are playing in support of separatist voices in its western province. And several Central Asia nations are making use of the Uighur “card” in their relations with China. War and ethnic cleansing have been the engines of another variety of diaspora dynamics initiated by mass migrations from Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Afghanistan. Extra-territorial Armenian and Azeri communities have long played major roles in policies toward their respective homelands. And more recent Afghan refugees in Iran, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and the West are buffeted by the inﬂuences of transnational ethnic alliances as they attempt to play a role in the formation of a post-Taliban polity. This book is intended as a contribution to emerging scholarship concerning these and other transnational and diasporic currents in Central Asia and the Caucasus. In this regard, it might be noted that there exist few books in English dealing directly with the issues of transnationalism and diaspora in Central Asia. There are books that deal with speciﬁc diasporic communities, but they focus almost exclusively on relations with the host nations, paying little attention to relations with the home regions. And signiﬁcantly, few deal with post-Soviet Central Asia. With regard to the Caucasus, considerable attention has been\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\npaid over the years to the Armenian diaspora, but little work has been published reﬂecting changed conditions following the fall of the Soviet Union, nor has much been published about Armenian diasporas in light of recent theoretical conceptualizations of transnationalism.

Population dislocation, mass migration, and immigration were among the consequences of this dramatic series of sociopolitical changes. The end of Tsarist Russia caused the ﬁrst wave of migration out of the fallen empire. In Central Asia and the Caucasus, during the early period of Soviet rule, an exodus of refugees left their homelands for neighboring countries, mainly Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, and China. In Iran and Turkey these political refugees set up cultural and political organizations and endeavored to sustain their links with the homeland. In later years, particularly during the 1930s, under pressures exerted on their already unwelcoming countries by the Soviet government, many of these refugees were forced to leave for other distant countries, in Europe or the United States, in pursuit of a safer haven. Unfortunately, there are no statistics available on the exact number of these refugees. Nevertheless, on the basis of available archival materials, one can deduce that prior to the outbreak of World War II there were tens of thousands of Tatars, Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz wandering into and out of the neighboring countries, some toward Europe or the United States, forming the ﬁrst Caucasus and Central Asian diaspora communities. The second wave of population dislocation was engendered by the process of forming the new Soviet state. An immediate consequence of implementing the ethno-federalist and authoritarian modernizing policies adopted by the Bolsheviks were massive migrations, forced or “voluntary,” unique in modern world history. The engineered partition of the Tsarist Empire and the demarcation of the new borders in Central Asia began as early as April 1924, when the Sredazburo (Central Asian Bureau) of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party voted to partition the Tsarist administrative province of Turkestan. A process of administrative realignment across Central Asia then followed, and was ﬁnally completed in 1936. Under the new alignment, all of Central Asia was administratively divided into three organizational categories: autonomous republics, autonomous regions, and national territories. By adopting an ethnoadministrative policy in Central Asia, the Bolsheviks initially divided the entire region into three national-territorial entities for Uzbeks, Kazakhs, and Turkmen.\n\n2\n\nTouraj Atabaki\n\nHowever, to avoid any possible revival of old territorial solidarity, they offered the heartland of the former Turkestan – the khanates Bukhara, Kokand, and Khiva – to the Uzbeks. Thus Uzbekistan extended from Osh at the eastern edge of the Ferghana valley to Khiva and Khwarazm in the west, and from Tashkent in the north to Zarafshan and Termiz near the northern border of Afghanistan, comprising all three former khanates of Bukhara, Kokand, and Khiva. The new demarcation, however, left the area’s other major ethnic groups, most prominently the Tajiks and Kyrgyz, with a strong sense of betrayal. Fearful of escalation of national sentiment among Tajiks who spoke Persian, the language of neighboring Iran and Afghanistan, the Soviets formally recognized the Tajiks and Kyrgyz as the other two major ethnic groups in the region. They did so by concluding their territorial realignment with the allocation of an administrative territory to these ethnic groups. Subsequently, ﬁve republics were formed in the region, with each supposed to accommodate a titular or dominant ethnic group: Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik, Uzbek, or Turkmen. Following this engineered partition, a new project for the homogenization of each Central Asian republic was initiated. To enhance this project, a process of nativization began which meant that the titular ethnic group gained access to high positions in the local administration. Whereas it was possible for so-called “recognized ethnic minorities” to enjoy “cultural freedom” within the new republics, it soon became clear that if one wished to advance one’s career it was necessary to adopt a certain degree of overt “titularness.” Meanwhile, titular ethnic cultural distinctiveness was gradually constructed and Sovietized, and members of the titular nomenklatura were encouraged to advance the particular interests of their republic. Likewise, the Soviet policy of registering nationality in the internal passport at the republic level tended to encourage non-titular ethnic groups to declare themselves as a members of the titular group in ofﬁcial documents, for the sake of advancement within the government apparatus. Meanwhile, at the Soviet level the party-state system, with its drive to centralize power, monopolized the key command positions throughout the Soviet Union, denying access to these positions to almost all non-Russian nationalities. Its highranking administrators formed the privileged core of a trans-ethnic population. Even at the republic level, without exception, a native Russian always ﬁlled the position of deputy ﬁrst secretary of the Communist Party in every republic. The Sovetskij chelovek (Soviet person) was the ideological embodiment of this transethnic party system, subjected to the original, revolutionary-popular idea of Soviet patriotism, whose identity was grounded in a sense of loyalty to the Soviet state. Thus absolute loyalty to Moscow predominated over any form of loyalty to individual republics. However, within the republics a concealed ethno-nationalism gradually developed not only within each dominant group but also between the ethnic minorities, which fostered interests different from those of the titular nation. Ethno-nationalism in the Central Asian republics is the direct outcome of this peculiar type of ethno-federalist administrative structure adopted by the Soviets. While they attempted to link a single constructed titular nation to its own state, in\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\norder to achieve social homogeneity and political cohesion, they simultaneously denied the smaller ethnic minorities in each republic equal rights with the titular nation. Although the Soviet government never genuinely encouraged ethnonationalism anywhere within the Soviet Union, one can point to occasional instances when Moscow made concessions to minority groups in order to consolidate its power at the local level. One may therefore conclude that in the post-Tsarist Empire the Bolsheviks, while aiming to construct a peculiar institution of Soviet ethno-federalism in part through the invention of the Sovetskij chelovek paired with patriotism, in the end unwittingly stimulated ethno-nationalism by the application of their elitist and centralizing policies. Underlying this fundamental problem was the fact that the imposed territorial borders never corresponded adequately with the cultural groupings. As a result, ethno-nationalism during the Soviet era became the most dynamic force in local politics. While the titular nationalities in each republic enjoyed preferential treatment and tended to comprise the local administrative hierarchy, ethnic minorities strove to consolidate their presence in particular sectors of the administration, especially those most strictly controlled by the Russians, by adopting a “defense” system based on nepotism. In order to achieve a clear historical break and to impede any potential call for unity among people who shared a common language and culture but lived under different national ﬂags, the Soviet authorities in the early days of their rule launched a widespread linguistic refashioning project in Central Asia. The Sovietization of the languages in Central Asia was initiated under the authority of Russian orientalists working at institutions inherited from the Russian Empire. The chief target of this project was to form national languages based on a certain spoken dialect, and to install these as the ofﬁcial written and literary languages. Accordingly, each republic would have a national language different from the languages spoken or written by co-ethno/linguistic groups outside the Soviet Union. The invention of national languages created modern Kyrgyz and Turkmen in 1924, and Karakalpak in 1925. Furthermore, to establish pan-Soviet consistency and to break all links with the past, the Arabic alphabet for all national languages was changed in 1929 to Latin and in 1940 to Cyrillic. By then, Soviet territorial state-building in Central Asia had been concluded, with ﬁve Soviet Socialist Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan established in addition to the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan in Uzbekistan and the Autonomous Province of Gorno Badakhshan in Tajikistan. Along with territorial state-building and language policies, the Soviet regime also implemented a wide range of social engineering projects in Central Asia. In the 1930s, the Bolsheviks instigated a policy of forced sedentarization of nomadic people, and of mass collectivization of agricultural lands into the collective farming units known in Russian as kolkhoz and sovkhoz. Moreover, the pace of industrialization that was unsettling all of Russia during the 1930s caused dramatic labor shortages in some industrial sectors and regions. The Stalinist\n\n4\n\nTouraj Atabaki\n\npolicy of “encouraging labor migration” or the “voluntary labor migration in building socialism”, which in practice was nothing less than displacement of a segment of population within each republic, and often to a new republic, created colossal population dislocation. Completing these enormous waves of mass migration were the catastrophic deportation schemes engineered by the Communist Party during World War II and the immediate years after. The Crimean Tatars, the Volga Germans, and the Meskhetians were the most prominent of such deported ethnic groups. Nevertheless, although Khrushchev, following Stalin’s death, in his secret speech delivered to the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 1956, acknowledged the deportation of several national communities from their homelands, their respective autonomous territories were never restored to them. Therefore, although the ultimate aspiration of the early Bolsheviks was to create a homogeneous state, the immediate consequence of the ethno-federalist administrative policies adopted by the Communist Party, in combination with forced migrations and mass deportations, was the development of ethnonationalist sentiments among Soviet citizens. The Bolsheviks’ recipe of “modernization and urbanization completely overlooked the difference between the immigrant population seeking to ﬁt in, on the one hand, and an indigenous population seeking to assert its proprietary claim to homeland on the other.”1 Moreover, by ignoring the “signiﬁcance of the subjective ‘sense of place’ that served as an integral element in the way indigenes deﬁned themselves and viewed the world,” Stalin’s perception of homeland was as “an empty container within which nations could be created and destroyed”2 and eventually a Sovetskij chelovek could live. The ultimate demographic consequence of these miscellaneous measures of population displacement adopted by Moscow during the 70 years of Soviet rule was some eight republics in the Caucasus and Central Asia of very diverse ethnic composition. As is shown in Tables 1.1 and 1.2, prior to the fall of the Soviet Union, and based on the last general census conducted in 1989, variety within the ethic composition of the Central Asian Soviet Socialist Republics was high, while Russians composed the main non-native ethnic group in each republic. Acknowledging the high percentage of ethnic diversity in each republic, through state-party rule, the central Soviet government sought a forced harmony among diverse ethnic groups throughout the Soviet era. Nevertheless, once Gorbachev launched his reform program in the mid-1980s, it soon became apparent that disparities among the ethnic groups in each Soviet republic, and corresponding ethno-nationalism, ran deeper than anticipated. Soon inter-ethnic hostilities among nations, which had supposedly been supplanted by sovetskii chelovek, convinced even admirers of the Soviets’ achievements that the “Soviet person” had never really come into existence. By the late 1980s, some ethnic minority groups in each Soviet republic began to feel stirrings toward a return to their homeland/motherland, though they did not always know where that was. Following ethnic tension between disgruntled guests and their incommodious hosts, in 1989 some 63,000 Meskhetians were forced\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nTable 1.1 Population distribution and ethnic composition of ﬁve Soviet Central Asian Republics (1989) Uzbekistan\n\nKazakhstan\n\nTajikistan\n\nKyrgyzstan\n\nTurkmenistan\n\n19,810,000 Uzbeks 71.3% Russians 8.3% Tajiks 4.7% Kazakhs 4.0% Tatars 2.3% Kara Kalpaks 2.0% Crimean Tatars 0.9% Koreans 0.9%\n\n16,464,000 Kazakhs 39.6% Russians 37.8% Germans 5.8% Ukrainians 5.4% Uzbeks 2.0% Tatars 1.9%\n\n5,093,000 Tajiks 62.2% Uzbeks 23.5% Russians 7.6% Tatars 1.4% Kyrgyz 1.2% Ukrainians 0.8%\n\n4,258,000 Kyrgyz 52.3% Russians 21.5% Uzbeks 12.9% Ukrainians 2.5% Germans 2.3% Tatars 1.6%\n\nUighurs 1.1%\n\nGermans 0.6%\n\nKazakhs 0.8%\n\n3,523,000 Turkmen 72.0% Russians 9.4% Uzbeks 8.9% Kazakhs 2.4% Tatars 1.1% Ukrainians 1.02% Azeris 0.9%\n\nTurkmen 0.3%\n\nDungans 0.8%\n\nArmenians 0.9%\n\nKoreans 0.2% Kazakhs 0.2% Jews 0.1%\n\nUighurs 0.8% Tajiks 0.7% Koreans 0.4%\n\nOsetins 0.1% White Russians 0.1% Crimean Tatars 0.1% Bashkirs 0.1%\n\nAzeris 0.3% Kurds 0.3%\n\nBaluchis 0.7% Lezgis 0.2% White Russians 0.2% Persians 0.2% Bashkirs 0.1%\n\nWhite Russians 1.1% Kyrgyz 0.8% Koreans 0.6% Ukrainians 0.7% Azeris 0.5% Turkmen 0.6% Polish 0.3% Turks 0.3% Jews 0.3%\n\nTurks 0.3% Greeks 0.2%\n\nArmenians 0.2% Bashkirs 0.2% Azeris 0.2% Germans 0.2% Uighurs 0.1% Bashkirs 0.1% Others 0.9%\n\nWhite Russians 0.2% Jews 0.1%\n\nMoldovanians 0.2% Dungans 0.1% Armenians 0.1% Others 1.7% Mordva 0.1% Mordva 0.1% Tajiks 0.1% Others 0.6% Kurds 0.1% Chuvash 0.1% Ingush 0.1% Armenians 0.1% Jews 0.1% Udmurds 0.09% Others 5.5%\n\nGermans 0.1% Kurds 0.1% Others 4.5%\n\nSource: Natsional’nyi Sostav Naseleniya SSSR po Dannym Vsesoiuznoi Perepisi Naseleniya 1989 (Goskomstat SSSR), (Moskva: “Finansy i Statistika”, 1991), pp. 13–15, 17–19.\n\nto leave Uzbekistan, though they had no homeland to return to. In other cases, ethnic minorities living in areas adjacent to their titular republic one began to call for secession and conjoining with the motherland. In the Caucasus, following the outbreak of hostilities between Azerbaijanis and Armenians over NagornoKarabagh in 1988, some 300,000 Armenians and 200,000 Russians and Jews left Azerbaijan, while the number of Azerbaijani refugees coming from Armenia or Karabagh reached 230,000 to 250,000.3 The formation of eight independent republics in the southern region of the former Soviet Union was accompanied by political tensions between neighboring states and ethnic groups, which in some cases led to bloody confrontation.

Often the primary basis for such new or reformed identity was a deep sense of distrust toward Russia and Russians, recasting one’s identity by rejecting the “other”, which often included “other-izing” the Russians. With a community of 25 million, some 17 percent of the total Russian people, Russians living in the former Soviet states formed the largest displaced ethnic group of the Soviet Union. Language, religion, and the Russian colonial past all alienated the Russian community from its host republics. For decades, the practice of using Russian as the lingua franca had kept the Russian communities in the Caucasus and Central Asia from learning the local languages. From July 1989 to May 1990, all republics in the former Soviet south passed laws replacing Russian with their own national languages as their state language. Following independence, insistence on the use of national languages became even more pervasive, limiting the use of Russian but also the languages of other ethnic minorities. Russian and non-Russian immigrants leaving the southern independent republics increased in the ﬁrst years following the fall of the Soviet Union. In Turkmenistan, the size of the Russian population dropped from 12.6 percent of the total population in 1989 to 6.7 percent in 1995; in Uzbekistan, the decrease in the same period was from 8.3 percent to 6.0 percent.4 In Kazakhstan, which had a large Russian population, the number of Russians leaving the country for the Russian Federation during 1989–1993 reached 614,838, some 9.9 percent of Kazakhstan’s total Russian population.5 The same rate could be observed in the\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nother republics of the Caucasus and Central Asia. Moreover, during the last ten years, in the absence of Sovetskij chelovek, there has been an observable gradual increase in the sense of alienation among ethnic minority groups in each new republic, which has manifested itself in the crafting of a new diaspora identity for themselves. In the post-Soviet era, many of the diasporic populations who had settled in compact communities in the former Soviet republics have formed cultural societies, produced periodicals, and staunchly taught their children their own religious convictions and vernacular languages, even when they were sent to Russian schools. Moreover, they follow intimately the political changes in their country of origin. In contributing to a deﬁnition of diaspora, Walker Connor has observed that “despite massive migration, it is still the case that all but a relatively small percentage of the world’s population lives within an ethnic homeland” and propounds a working deﬁnition of diaspora as “that segment of a people living outside the homeland.”6 Distinguishing those diaspora communities whose country of origin does not enjoy sovereignty from those whose corresponding ethno-linguistic group forms the titular or non-titular ethnic community in another nation/territorial-state, both types survive within the southern Soviet successor states. Russians, Armenians, Germans, Ukrainians, Azerbaijanis, and Iranians are among those who are identiﬁed and engaged with the myth of homeland, though not necessarily with return. They “retain a collective memory, vision, or myth about their original homeland – its physical location, history, and achievements and they believe that they are not – and perhaps cannot be – fully accepted by their host society.”7 During the last years of Soviet rule and the early years of independence, one could trace the ﬁnancial and moral support some parties in the regional conﬂicts enjoyed from ethnic diaspora communities in the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Armenian and Azerbaijani communities of Central Asia supported the respective parties in the Nagorno-Karabakh conﬂict, and the Chechen diaspora in Russia as well as in the Caucasus and Central Asia acknowledged the ﬁnancial needs of their compatriots in their ﬁght for an independent Chechnya. Recruiting volunteers and dispatching them for combat was also part of these diasporas’ campaign to support the homeland. However, for those ethnic minorities without an independent homeland, such as the Crimean Tatars, the Meskhetians, or the Kurds, the collective desire for the restoration of the vanished or imagined homeland created a new form of ethno-communal allegiance and political solidarity which accentuated the “reconstruction” of a homeland and return. No matter how anachronistic their desire and call for rebuilding the “homeland” might appear, nevertheless, as in the case of the minority Kurdish community in Central Asia which supports the PKK in its strikes against Turkey, it has the potential to prove quite a real security threat. The contributions to this book address a number of the phenomena and issues raised above. They are the results of a conference, “Currents, Cross-Currents and Conﬂict: Transnationalism and Diaspora in Central Asia and the Caucasus,” held by the Caucasus and Central Asia Program at the University of California,\n\n8\n\nTouraj Atabaki\n\nBerkeley in April, 2002. The conference aimed to bring together specialists on diasporas to create a comparative and inclusive study of emerging transnationalism along the former Soviet Union’s southern borders, both in the Soviet successor states and their neighbors. In Chapter 2, Nationalism from Without: Theorizing the Role of Diasporas in Contemporary Conﬂict, Jolle Demmers presents a theoretical framework for examining the process of “deterritorialization” and “delocalization” of international conﬂicts. Furthermore, by contemplating the notion of long-distance nationalism she examines the role of politically mobilized diaspora in contemporary intra-state conﬂicts. In Chapter 3, Towards a Typology of Diasporas in Kazakhstan, Shirin Akiner, in her contribution on the typology of diasporas in Kazakhstan, provides a detailed historical description of the ethnic build-up of Kazakhstan. Furthermore, by studying the outcome of the Soviet fall on population dislocation in Kazakhstan, Akiner offers an account of a post-Soviet diaspora pattern of behavior in contemporary Kazakhstan. Finally, Akiner’s chapter concludes with some remarks on the typology of diasporas in former Soviet Kazakhstan as analogized with the British Empire. In Chapter 4, Russians in Post-Soviet Central Asia: Issues and Concerns, Kulbhushan Warikoo studies demographic changes in the Russian communities of Central Asia during the 70 years of Soviet rule and then following the Soviet Union’s demise. Warikoo considers diverse sociopolitical processes such as indigenization and what the Russian community perceived as a reluctance to assimilate, and their impact on the gradual decline of the Russian community in the former Tsarist/Soviet south. In Chapter 5, State, Homeland, and Diaspora: The Armenian and Azerbaijani Cases, Stephan Astourian poses an introductory debate on the concept of diaspora and its working deﬁnitions, followed by a detailed study on the rather long formation of the Armenian and Azerbaijani diaspora communities and their intermingled relationship with their (ﬁctitious and factual) homeland and its functioning states. Armine Ishkanian addresses the role of the Armenian diaspora, the most prominent diasporic group of the region, and its non-governmental organizations in shaping the post-Soviet transition. In Chapter 6, Diaspora and Global Civil Society: The Impact of Transnational Diasporic Activism on Armenia’s Post-Soviet Transition, Ishkanian examines the impediments confronting Armenian diaspora activism in advancing its agenda in the homeland. In Chapter 7, Afghan Communities in Uzbekistan: A Preliminary Case Study, Natalya Khan studies the drastic, catastrophic political changes in Afghanistan that have had far-reaching effects for Russia and the ﬁve Central Asian neighboring republics, among which is the gradual formation of an Afghan diaspora community in the region. By focusing on Uzbekistan, Khan’s study examines both the inter-state relationship between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and the status of Afghan refugees in Uzbekistan. The fate of the Uighur community in Central Asia is the subject of Ablet Kamalov’s study. Divided between the Tsarist/Soviet south and the Xinjiang province of China, since the late nineteenth century the destiny of the Uighur community has been linked to the Russo-Chinese diplomatic relationship. In Chapter 8, Uighur Community in 1990s Central Asia: A Decade of Change, Kamalov examines the impact\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nof the Soviet fall in refashioning the Uighurs’ collective identity both in the former Soviet Central Asia and in China. In addition to the Soviet successor states, the contributors to this book also consider neighboring regions. In Chapter 9, Eden Naby analyzes the formation of diaspora identities in correlation with real or imagined homelands. In this chapter, The Afghan Diaspora: Reﬂections on the Imagined Country, Naby studies the gradual conﬁguration of Afghan identity in diaspora populations, their reciprocal relationship with the host land and their possible role in reshaping the political process in Afghanistan. In Chapter 10, Islam in China: Transnationalism or Transgression, Dru Gladney argues that Muslims in China are seriously threatened in terms of self-preservation with an Islamic identity. Following an introduction on the roots of Islam in China, Gladney studies the four phases during which Chinese Islam was heavily inﬂuenced by exogenous trends. Finally, in Chapter 11, Naby presents an overview of the struggle of another diaspora community in preserving its diminishing entity and ethnic consciousness. In this chapter, The Assyrian Diaspora: Cultural Survival in the Absence of State Structure, Naby explores the hardships with which the Assyrians, a worldwide population of some four million, have been confronted with preserving their language and culture, maintaining the aspiration of creating a homeland though none is promised or waiting for them. In Russia, the Caucasus and Central Asia, since the fall of the Soviet Union, the idealization of a real or putative ancestral home and “a collective commitment to its maintenance, restoration, safety and prosperity, even to its creation”8 has become one of the main notions fostered by diaspora communities that dream of drawing new political borders. With this long-distance nationalism, borrowing Benedict Anderson’s language, Acton’s aphorism that “exile is the nursery of nationalism” is being contested and reconﬁgured.9\n\nNOTES 1 Robert J.

Increasingly, conﬂicts seem to become dispersed and delocalized. Stories about American Jewish groups supporting right-wing extremism in Israel, German Croats speeding the violent collapse of Yugoslavia, and the Tamil Tigers in London, Kurds in the Netherlands, Filipinos, Khmer, and Kosovar Albanians in Western Europe and the US are not new to us. Within the ﬁeld of Conﬂict Studies, however, the process of the “deterritorialization” of conﬂict is left surprisingly unexplored. Many questions about the political mobilization of diaspora communities and their role in intra-state conﬂicts remain unanswered. How and why are diaspora communities involved in intra-state conﬂicts in their erstwhile homelands? What activities do they undertake? How are they organized? What strategies do they use? And, eventually, how do they affect contemporary conﬂicts? In this chapter I explore the deterritorialization and delocalization of contemporary conﬂict. By looking at ideas on locality, long-distance nationalism, and conﬂict dynamics I aim to identify units of analysis to understand the role of diaspora in contemporary conﬂict. The nature of diasporic politics is manifold and highly case-speciﬁc. Kaldor, for instance, points at the presence of both cosmopolitan, anti-nationalist, and reactionary ethno-nationalists within diasporas.2 Others see room for hybrid, diasporic “third space” standpoints.3 The impact of diaspora activities on contemporary conﬂicts is also highly miscellaneous. In some cases diasporic connections seem to feed and prolong the conﬂict. In other cases diasporic voices and initiatives can plead for reconciliation and demobilization. Examples of diasporas acting as a strategic force in regional conﬂicts can be readily discerned. The sudden upsurge in strength of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) during the summer of 1998 may have been at least partially due to fundraising efforts by the Albanian diaspora in the West. The Croatian diaspora was quite effective in helping swing the international community behind the Croats in their conﬂict with the Croatian Serbs in the mid-1990s. Furthermore, the Tamil diaspora in Canada and Western Europe has been active in funneling ﬁnancial support to the Tamil insurgents ﬁghting the Sinhalese government forces in Sri Lanka.\n\nNationalism from without\n\n11\n\nDiasporas have existed in one form or another since ancient times. There are, however, reasons to believe that the political weight of diaspora communities has increased signiﬁcantly throughout the late twentieth century, and that they often play a crucial role in contemporary conﬂicts. These reasons are (1) the rise of a new pattern of conﬂict; (2) the rapid rise of war refugees; (3) the increased speed of communication and mobility; and (4) the increased production of cultural and political boundaries in the Western world.\n\nNEW PATTERNS OF CONFLICT, MOBILITY, AND BOUNDARIES Throughout the late twentieth century a new pattern of conﬂict has evolved in which identity groups – religious, ethnic, cultural, and others – have become central. One of the ﬁrst scholars to recognize this was Edward Azar. He argued for a radical revision of Clausewitzean ideas by claiming that it was the identity group – however deﬁned – and not the nation-state that was at the core of most contemporary conﬂicts. At the end of the twentieth century, with the collapse of Yugoslavia and civil wars in the Caucasus, Indonesia, and Africa, the idea that a “new pattern of conﬂict” had evolved became widespread. There is debate about whether this “new pattern” should be dated back to 1945 (and include the decolonization wars of the 1950s and 1960s, and the post-colonial civil wars of the 1970s and 1980s) or whether it only began with the ending of the Cold War in 1989. These large questions will not be discussed here. The phenomenon that most wars in the late twentieth century are within states, and that they are often about the role and status of nations and communities within these states is of concern to this research.4 These intra-state wars differ substantially from the European wars in the era of the dynastic state or from the “total wars” of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century.5 Kaldor and Vashee, for instance, characterize the “new wars” in terms of: political goals (no longer the foreign policy interests of states, but the consolidation of new forms of power based on ethnic homogeneity); ideologies (no longer universal principles such as democracy, fascism, or socialism, but tribalist and communalist identity politics); forms of mobilization (no longer conscription or appeals to patriotism, but fear, corruption, religion, magic, and the media); external support (no longer superpowers or ex-colonial powers, but diasporas, foreign mercenaries, criminal maﬁa, regional powers); mode of warfare (no longer formal and organized campaigns with demarcated front-lines, bases and weapons, but fragmented, dispersed, involving paramilitary and criminal groups, child soldiers, light weapons, and the use of atrocity, famine, rape, and siege); and the war economy (no longer funded by taxation and generated by state mobilization, but sustained by outside emergency assistance and the parallel economy including unofﬁcial export of timber and precious metals, drug-trafﬁcking, criminal rackets, plunder).6 In sum, new patterns of conﬂict have evolved that are distinct from traditional inter-state disputes over foreign policy, security, economic resources, or\n\n12\n\nJolle Demmers\n\nEast–West rivalry and revolve around questions of status of identity groups within states. What role do diaspora communities play in this new type of conﬂict? Since the nature of external support for contemporary conﬂict has become increasingly transnational, diaspora communities have become the obvious group to mobilize external support. Since identity groups in conﬂict often lack formal international representation such as membership of the United Nations (UN) and a diplomatic corps, they largely depend on their dispersed members for (the mobilization of) external support, both politically and ﬁnancially. An example of this are the repeated efforts of Moluccan groups in The Netherlands to pressure the Dutch government to use its membership in the UN to call for humanitarian intervention in Indonesia. Another example includes the call on the Serbian diaspora by Serbian Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj to strike back “wherever they lived” in response to the NATO bombing campaign in March 1999. Financially, diasporas are often pressured to contribute part of their income to the homeland: the parallel government of the Kosovo Albanians of the 1990s was ﬁnanced through a 3 percent tax on all income both within Kosovo and among the Albanian diaspora abroad.7 A recent survey estimated that remittances provided 45 percent of Kosovo’s annual domestic revenues during the war of 1998–1999. Kurds in Amsterdam and London are pressured by the PKK to work two out of the ﬁfty-two weeks in a year for the homeland organization. A second, very straightforward, reason to presuppose the increasing importance of diaspora communities in contemporary conﬂicts is the rapid rise of war refugees. Since most contemporary conﬂicts are civil conﬂicts within states, the share of civilian casualties is very high. Whereas in WWI 80 percent of warrelated deaths were soldiers, in the 1990s, over 90 percent of war-related deaths were civilians, killed in their own homes and communities.8 An often-heard ironic remark is that indeed, “The least dangerous place to be in most contemporary wars is the military.”9 These vicious internal conﬂicts generate great numbers of refugees, who often leave the country at the same time. In sum, the new pattern of conﬂict rapidly produces diaspora. Third, because of the speed of communications and high mobility of people, diasporas are increasingly capable of forging and sustaining social relations that link their societies of origin and settlement. Practically, this means that diaspora communities can easily participate in conﬂicts in their homelands and “live their politics long-distance.”10 A fourth reason why diaspora are likely to continue to focus on their erstwhile homeland is that it has become increasingly hard to settle in “host” countries. The new racist nationalism that is gathering force in contemporary Europe is centrally concerned with notions of defending home, space, and territory against “the other,” a category which has come to include immigrants, asylum seekers, and ethnic minorities. Due to the increased production of cultural and political boundaries in countries of the Western world, contemporary diasporas have found full incorporation in the countries in the West within which they resettle either not\n\nNationalism from without\n\n13\n\npossible or not desirable. Because of this, they maintain close relationships with their ancestral homelands.\n\nDIASPORA: A WORKING DEFINITION In his introduction to the new journal Diaspora Tötölian loosely mixes the term diaspora with transnational community by stating that, “Diaspora are the exemplary communities of the transnational moment.” Further, he adds: “The term that once described Jewish, Greek, and Armenian dispersion now shares meanings with a larger semantic domain that includes words like immigrant, expatriate, refugee, guest-worker, exile community, overseas community, ethnic community.”11 Others prefer to distinguish diaspora from transnationalism. Whereas transnationalism is deﬁned as a “process by which immigrants forge and sustain multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement,”12 diasporas are at times deﬁned as presupposing a separation more like exile.13 In addition, whereas transnationalism generally presupposes the construction of social ﬁelds that link together communities in two nation-states, diasporas are often seen as more globally dispersed. Diasporas maintain a “triadic relationship” between (a) globally dispersed yet collectively self-identiﬁed ethnic groups; (b) the territorial states and contexts where such groups reside; and (c) the homeland states and contexts where they or their forbears came from.14 Safran uses a rather strict deﬁnition of diasporas, deﬁning them as expatriate minority communities (1) that are dispersed from an original “centre” to at least two “peripheral” places; (2) that maintain a memory, vision, or myth about their original homeland; (3) that believe they are not – and perhaps cannot be – fully accepted by their host country; (4) that see the ancestral home as a place of eventual return, when the time is right; (5) that are committed to the maintenance or restoration of this homeland; and (6) of which the group’s consciousness and solidarity are importantly deﬁned by this continuing relation with the homeland.15 Whereas Tötölian’s deﬁnition lacks precision, Safran’s checklist is perhaps too strict. I agree with Clifford that we should be wary of constructing our working deﬁnition of a term like “diaspora” by recourse to an “ideal-type,” with the consequence that groups become identiﬁed as “more” or “less” diasporic. I will therefore follow Clifford and use the term “diaspora” as a signiﬁer, “not simply of translocality and movement, but of political struggles to deﬁne the local, as distinctive community, in historical contexts of displacement.”16\n\nDIASPORA AND CONFLICT: LOCALITY, LONG-DISTANCE NATIONALISM, AND CONFLICT DYNAMICS In the contemporary world, group identities are no longer spatially or territorially bounded. People support, produce, or cling to territorially based identities even\n\n14\n\nJolle Demmers\n\nthough they do not actually live in the territory. Diasporas can actively be involved in violent conﬂicts at the other end of the world through electronic means, and inﬂuence these conﬂicts by sending money, arms, and opinions. How can we conceptualize these processes of deterritorialization and delocalization of conﬂict? I will ﬁrst look into the applicability of ideas on locality and (longdistance) nationalism. Then I will brieﬂy discuss the delocalization of conﬂict dynamics.\n\nLocality: the claiming of space Globalization, and in particular new communication technologies such as the Internet offer individuals the opportunity to create and sustain their own social and cultural networks, in opposition to both national states and a wider global culture. In more abstract terms, this is what Arjun Appadurai calls “locality:” the capacity of individuals to shape their surroundings, to create a “home,” to claim space. In a recent article, Appadurai analyzes the transformation of the production of locality in a “dramatically delocalized world.” Locality, Appadurai claims, is a fragile social achievement. Even in the smallest, most isolated societies local subjects must be produced with the help of spatial symbolism. Appadurai points out how the relationship between the production of local subjects and the communities in which such subjects can be produced, named, and empowered to act socially is historical and dialectical. Furthermore, he stresses the importance of context and power in analyzing the link between locality and community. To transform “spaces” into “places” is inherently an exercise of power.17 The capability of communities to produce local subjects is affected profoundly by the locality-producing capabilities of larger-scale social formations such as the nation-state. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there was a steady increase in the capacity of the modern nation-state to deﬁne all communities under the sign of its forms of allegiance and afﬁliation. However, this process of homogenization is under threat from (1) the growing disjuncture between territory, subjectivity, and collective social movement, and (2) the steady erosion of the relationship between spatial and virtual communities.18 These processes are looked into here. Human motion and virtual communities The creation of a “homogeneous space of nationness” by the nation-state is increasingly under threat from the forms of circulation of people characteristic of the contemporary world. Human motion has increased rapidly throughout the late twentieth century. Increasingly, the intermediate surveillance of the nationstate is bypassed by new transnational forms of communication, such as fax machines, e-mail, and other forms of computer-mediated communication. Each of these developments, of course, interacts with the others, creating complicated new connections between producers, audiences, and “publics,” local and national, stable and diasporic.19 These numerous new forms of communication affect the\n\nNationalism from without\n\n15\n\ncapability of communities to be context-producing rather than largely context-driven. A clear example of this are the Zapatistas, a small indigenous peasant movement in the Lacandona jungle of southern Mexico who made very clever use of the Internet. Without the Internet they would have never been able to attract so much international attention and support, and would have been easily repressed and silenced by the Mexican priísta regime. Likewise, the Milosevic regime was unable to block the Serbian anti-Milosevic B92 Internet broadcasting from The Netherlands during the 1990s. Particularly, the Internet allows debate, dialogue, and relationship-building among various territorially divided individuals, who nevertheless are forming ‘communities of imagination and interest’, the so-called virtual communities.20 In this sense, the production of locality is primarily a political struggle. Due to human motion and the emergence of virtual communities this political struggle is no longer territorially bounded. How can we now use these insights in our study of the role of diaspora communities in intra-state conﬂict? What follows from Appadurai’s framework is that conﬂict should be understood as a struggle between the locality-producing capabilities of two or more social formations. Generally, in this struggle, the localizing power of the nation-state is dominant and capable of deﬁning all other social formations (e.g. identity groups) under the sign of its forms. However, at times of conﬂict, this dominance of the nation-state is contested. Identity groups or national minorities resist assimilation into the nation-state. In other cases, the nation-state has lost (or is unable to produce) localizing power (the so-called “weak” or “failed” states). Recent examples of this are Colombia where part of the country is in the hands of the guerrilla movement, the FARC, and the separatist civil wars in Indonesia (Ambon, Atjeh), Africa, and the Basque Country. But also “no-go” areas in major cities around the world: the favelas in Brazil and certain areas of Mexico City where the “state” and its representatives are not welcome. If groups choose to resist assimilation and construct their own histories, cultures, and identities, they must do so without the vast array of (localityproducing) facilities that are available to the state, such as national universities, state primary schools, standardized print languages, and ceremonies of national independence, statues, and street names.21 This was, for instance, the case in Kosovo, where Albanian Kosovars set up an underground parallel government during the Milosevic regime. This government administered a system of education, health, and social services. An important advantage of the idea of locality is that it offers room to study the construction of virtual communities and processes of delocalization. If properly made operational, the term could help to analyze the struggle of ordinary people in intra-state and nationalist conﬂict and their efforts to “claim space” and “produce locality.” Nationalism not as seen by governments and the spokespeople and activists of nationalist movements, but as it is seen by ordinary persons. Particularly in civil wars and intra-state conﬂict, “ethnic marking” is very important. Protestant youths in Belfast painting the pavements of their neighborhood during the Orange marches, saying this is my land, you don’t belong here.\n\n16\n\nJolle Demmers\n\nOr the more subtle examples such as the stickers you’ll ﬁnd at practically every trafﬁc light in Barcelona, saying: “This is Not Spain.” An important question with respect to the role of diaspora in intra-state conﬂict is therefore in what way they are able to strengthen their “homeland-groups’ ” capabilities to be contextproducing. Long-distance nationalism Whereas Appadurai tends to phrase the process of nation-building and nationalism primarily in terms of “locality production power,” others such as Ernest Gellner focus on “culture” and identity. Here nationalism is deﬁned as the political principle that holds that the national and the political unit should be congruent. The nation is deﬁned as a “shared culture,” a national identity.22 There is, however, an important shortcoming in theories on nationalism, particularly in relation to diaspora research. Until recently, theories on nationalism all stressed the centrality of territory and boundaries: ethnic or national boundaries should not cut across political ones. “Let all nations have their own political roofs, and let all of them refrain from including non-nationals under it,” as Gellner put it.23 Taking this as point of departure, it is hard to assess the “long-distance nationalism” of diaspora communities and their involvement in nationalist conﬂicts in their erstwhile homelands, particularly when they have no serious intention of returning to their heimat. Can we still speak of “nationalist” struggles when nationalists live, work, and operate in territories that are thousands of miles away from the ones they are ﬁghting for? And have no intention to return to? Is “long-distance nationalism” not a contradictio in terminis? I don’t think so. Rather, nationalism has changed: the phenomenon has outgrown its deﬁnition. In contrast to the expectations of many, globalization (including the internationalization of labor, mass migration) has not meant the end of nationalism. Instead, nationalists (Catalans, Kosovar Albanians, Macedonians, Serbs) have begun to carry out their struggles on a global scale. National communities are being “imagined” in a new (delocalized) way. We are witnessing the construction of transnational national communities.24 People remain loyal to a national homeland they no longer inhabit. “Exile is the nursery of nationality,” as Lord Acton already stated in 1860.25 Minority groups that are repressed by the state often “vote with their feet” and leave the country. Very often they try and emigrate to liberal democracies and Western countries where they can express their identity, culture, and language more freely. A large number of Kurds that ﬂed Turkey, for instance, only “discovered” their “Kurdishness” in Germany, where they could express their culture, language, and organize themselves without repression. Or as Lyon and Uçarer noted, “(T)here have always been Kurds among the Turkish guest workers and refugees, but most of them did not discover their “Kurdishness” until they came to Europe.”26 In their case exile indeed did breed nationalism. This kind of long-distance nationalism has become a signiﬁcant force in today’s global world.\n\nNationalism from without\n\n17\n\nThe delocalization of conﬂict dynamics By long-distance interference with the conﬂict in their homeland, diaspora communities are engaged in a sort of “virtual conﬂict:” they live their conﬂicts through the Internet, e-mail, television, and telephone without direct (physical) suffering, risks, or accountability. Therefore they are engaged in processes of conﬂict dynamics that differ importantly from their identity group members in their homelands. Although hardly investigated, this “delocalization” of contemporary conﬂict and the “long-distance participation” of diaspora communities is likely to have a complex, and crucial, effect on the conﬂict. Let us turn to conﬂict theory to further elaborate on this. Contemporary conﬂicts are often about the role and status of identity groups within states. In broad terms, conﬂict can be deﬁned as “the pursuit of incompatible goals by different groups.”27 These goals, however, are by no means static or ﬁxed. Conﬂicts, and particularly the violent, civilian conﬂicts under study here, are dynamic processes with complex life cycles. Galtung introduced an inﬂuential model of conﬂict dynamics.28 He suggested that conﬂict should be seen as a triangle, with contradiction (C), attitude (A), and behavior (B) at its vertices. Here the contradiction refers to the underlying conﬂict situation, which includes the actual or perceived “incompatibility of goals” between the conﬂict parties. Attitude includes the parties’ perceptions and misperceptions of each other and of themselves. These can be positive or negative, but in violent conﬂicts parties tend to develop demeaning stereotypes of each other, and attitudes are often inﬂuenced by emotions such as fear, anger, bitterness, and hatred. Attitude includes emotive (feeling), cognitive (belief), and conative (will) elements. Behavior is the third element. It can include cooperation or coercion, gestures signifying conciliation or hostility. Violent conﬂict behavior is characterized by threats, coercion, and destructive attacks. According to Galtung all three components have to be present together in a full conﬂict. A conﬂict structure without conﬂictual attitudes or behavior is a latent (or structural) conﬂict. Galtung sees conﬂict as a dynamic process in which contradiction, attitudes, and behavior are constantly changing and inﬂuencing one another. As a conﬂict emerges, it becomes a conﬂict formation as parties’ interests come into conﬂict or the relationship they are in becomes oppressive. Conﬂict parties then organize around this structure to pursue their interests. They develop hostile attitudes and conﬂictual behavior. And so the conﬂict formation starts to grow and develop. As it does so, it may widen, drawing in other issues and parties, deepen and spread, generating secondary conﬂicts within the main parties or among outsiders who get sucked in. Eventually, Galtung claims, resolving the conﬂict must involve a set of dynamic changes that involve a de-escalation of conﬂict behavior, a change in attitudes, and transforming the relationships or clashing interests that are at the core of the conﬂict structure.29 Since diaspora communities are physically separated from the “core conﬂict” they are engaged in different contradiction-attitude-behavior dynamics. Even if the diaspora and the “homeland” communities have similar perceptions of the\n\n18\n\nJolle Demmers\n\ncontradiction (C) (for instance, Serbian and Albanian Kosovar groups have incompatible goals because they both claim Kosovo/a to be “theirs”), they are likely to experience different emotions and develop different behaviour during the course of the conﬂict. Whereas the “homeland” groups that are physically engaged in the conﬂict will experience fear, hunger, pain, and stress, diaspora groups will probably feel anger, frustration, or alienation. Consequently, these differences in attitudes will affect their behavior and perception of the contradiction, and so forth. Diasporic and homeland groups live in different realities. The homelands that lie at the symbolic centre of transnational national communities are “inventions”; they are products of the imagination of deterritorialized groups. Hence, diaspora and local groups may have different interests in maintaining the “homeland” as a collective identity and a source of cultural reproduction. Anderson, for instance, stresses that the political activities of the diasporic person are directed toward an “imagined heimat” in which “he does not intend to live, where he pays no taxes, where he cannot be arrested, where he will not be brought before the courts, and where he does not vote: in effect, a politics without responsibility or accountability.”30 Although it is very likely that diaspora and local groups “imagine” their homeland differently (and therefore show different attitudes and behavior), I would be careful to oppose the two. Again, real life is more complex. Not all diasporas are engaged in just “virtual wars.” For example, a substantial number (an estimated 20,000) of Kosovar Albanians in the diaspora returned to Kosovo in 1998 and 1999 to participate in the conﬂict. They crossed the border between virtual and real conﬂict. So far, there is very little case material on the role of diaspora communities in intra-state conﬂict. What is becoming increasingly clear though is that it is no longer possible to understand ethno-nationalist conﬂict dynamics without incorporating the “diasporic” component.\n\nCONCLUSIONS There is reason to believe that the political weight of diaspora communities in intra-state conﬂict has increased. This is related to the rise of new patterns of conﬂict, the rise of war refugees, the speed of mobility and communication, and the increased production of cultural and political boundaries in Western countries. Group identities are much less territorially bounded. Of course, ethnonationalist diasporas have existed in one form or another since ancient times. However, advances in communication and transportation have increased their size, visibility, and impact within the international system. Diasporas are able to remain much more deeply involved in the national struggles in their homelands than they ever could before. In addition, both multicultural policies and xenophobia in Western countries enable and force newcomers to continue to deﬁne themselves in terms of their ethnic or national origin. In order to analyze and understand these new phenomena this chapter has looked at ideas on locality, nationalism, and conﬂict dynamics.\n\nNationalism from without\n\n19\n\nThe focus on locality and “context-producing capabilities” draws our attention to the rise of virtual communities and allows us to include everyday practices in the analysis of diaspora and violent conﬂict. The focus on nationalism offers a more historical and political view on nation-building and minority nationalism and the construction of transnational national communities. Conﬂict theory and, in particular, conﬂict dynamics, helps to analyze the diasporic component in contemporary conﬂicts. Clearly, the above ideas and concepts need further elaboration and ﬁne-tuning. This can only be done, however, with the help of solid empirical case studies. Hopefully, this chapter has provided some useful directions for this kind of research.\n\nNOTES 1 An earlier version of this chapter was published in Javnost/The Public: Journal of the European Institute for Culture and Communication, Vol. 9 (2002), 1, pp. 85–96. 2 Mary Kaldor, “Cosmopolitanism versus Nationalism: The New Divide?,” in Richard Caplan and John Feffer (eds), Europe’s New Nationalism: States and Minorities in Conﬂict (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 42–58. 3 See Homi Bhabha, The Location of Culture (London and New York: Routledge, 1994); Arjun Appadurai, “The Production of Locality,” in Richard Fardon (ed.), Counterworks: Managing the Diversity of Knowledge (London and New York: Routledge, 1995), pp. 204–25. 4 See Peter Wallensteen and Margareta Sollenberg, “Armed Conﬂicts, Conﬂict Termination and Peace Agreements 1989–96,” in Journal of Peace Research, 34:3 (1997), pp. 339–58; Kalevi Holsti, The State, War, and the State of War (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). 5 Hugh Miall, Oliver Ramsbotham and Tom Woodhouse, Contemporary Conﬂict Resolution (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998), p. 69. 6 Mary Kaldor and Basker Vashee (eds), New Wars: Restructuring the Global Military Sector (London: Pinter, 1997), pp. 7–19; Hugh Miall, Oliver Ramsbotham and Tom Woodhouse, Contemporary Conﬂict Resolution (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1998), p. 69. 7 One estimate puts the total collected between 1991 and 1999 at DM 1 billion. 8 Miall et al., Contemporary Conﬂict Resolution, p. 130. 9 Carolyn Nordstrom and JoAnn Martin, The Paths to Domination, Resistance, and Terror (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1992), p. 269. 10 Benedict Anderson, Long-Distance Nationalism: World Capitalism and the Rise of Identity Politics, The Wertheim Lecture 1992 (Amsterdam: Centre for Asian Studies Amsterdam, 1992), p. 12. 11 Khachig Tötölian, “The Nation State and its Others: In Lieu of a Preface,” in Diaspora 1:1 (1991), pp. 4–5. 12 Linda Basch, Nina Glick Schiller and Cristina Szanton-Blanc, Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects and the Deterritorialized Nation-State (New York: Gordon and Breach, 1994), p. 34. 13 James Clifford, “Diasporas, ” in Cultural Anthropology, 9:3 (1994), p. 304. 14 Steven Vertovec, “Conceiving and Researching Transnationalism,” in Ethnic and Racial Studies, March 1999, v. 22:2, pp. 447–63. 15 William Safran, “Diasporas in Modern Societies: Myths of Homeland and Return,” in Diaspora 1:1 (1991), pp. 83–4. 16 James Clifford, “Diasporas, ” in Cultural Anthropology, 9:3 (1994), p. 308.\n\n20\n\nJolle Demmers\n\n17 Arjun Appadurai, “The Production of Locality,” in Richard Fardon (ed.), Counterworks: Managing the Diversity of Knowledge (London and New York: Routledge, 1995) pp. 208–9. 18 Ibid., p. 213. 19 Ibid., p. 218. 20 Ibid., p. 219. 21 Loring Danforth, The Macedonian Conﬂict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World (Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1995). 22 In fact, every nationalist attempt to create a nation or a “people” at the same time creates national minorities, and potential new nationalisms.

It is home to over 100 ethnic groups. They vary considerably in size, historical experiences, and patterns of behavior. Consequently it is difﬁcult to establish an organizational framework that could serve as an analytical tool for examining group dynamics. Yet without such a framework it is impossible to move beyond a mere recital of group designations. A project of this magnitude would require a full-length study. Here, owing to constraints of space, the aim is inevitably far more modest: a preliminary categorization, based on certain salient characteristics, is presented and this is developed into a tentative typology. In order to ground the discussion, some background reference material is included. Below there is a brief introduction to Kazakhstan, followed by an explanation of terminological usage. Part I surveys (in very truncated form) the origins of the ethnic groups that form the basis for the analysis in Part II. In Part III the threads of the arguments set out in the preceding section are drawn together and systematized. The ﬁndings are then tested within a broader, international framework.\n\nKazakhstan Kazakhstan is located in the heart of Eurasia, between the Caspian Sea and the Tien Shan mountains. To the north and west it is bounded by the Russian Federation, to the east by China, and to the south by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. It covers an area of 2.7 million square kilometers, thus is almost as big as the whole of Western Europe. Yet it has a relatively small population, numbering (according to the 1999 census survey) just under 15 million. The country has a relatively diversiﬁed economy. It has world-class deposits of oil, gas, and coal, and also other minerals such as chrome, copper, gold, lead, wolfram (tungsten), and zinc. Most of its industrial base is connected with the extraction and processing of these resources. However, it also possesses extensive tracts\n\n22\n\nShirin Akiner\n\nof ﬁne arable land and is an important producer and exporter of agricultural products, notably grain, meat, and dairy. Kazakhstan, as a modern political entity, with ﬁxed borders, came into being after the establishment of Soviet rule in the early 1920s. In 1936 it acquired the status of a full Union republic, the second largest (in terms of territory) of the 15 constituent Soviet republics. It declared its independence on 16 December 1991, shortly before the formal demise of the Union. A week later, it became one of the founder members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\n\nTerminology and politics Since the mid-nineteenth century Kazakhstan has experienced huge movements of population. Most of these ﬂows were immigration inﬂuxes, but since independence there has been a sizeable exodus from the country. There have also been several waves of internal migration, particularly during the early Soviet period and again in the 1990s. The demographic turbulence of the post-independence period has been a subject of much debate. Perhaps, not surprisingly, discussions have been dominated, explicitly or implicitly, by political considerations. There are two main thrusts to such arguments. One uses the issue of emigration as a gauge of trust in the government – its economic and social policies as well as its style of governance – and concludes that the exodus is an indictment of the conduct of government. This school of thought, moreover, emphasizes the risk of social conﬂict in the country and stresses the need for, among other things, ongoing monitoring of the situation. The other line of argument downplays the exodus and concentrates instead on the positive aspects of government policies, particularly the efforts that have been made to promote inter-ethnic harmony and to develop a viable multiethnic, multi-cultural state. Both these approaches are valid, but neither, on their own, gives a complete picture of an extremely complicated situation. The difﬁculties of discussing demographic issues in Kazakhstan are compounded by the problems of terminology. During the Soviet period a distinction was made between the legal concept of “citizenship,” and the ethnic concept of “nationality.” Since independence, there has been a blurring of this distinction. At the same time, however, the concept of the “titular nation” – that is to say, the people from whom the state takes its name – has been promoted as a special category. Thus, although the preamble to the 1995 constitution1 speaks collectively of the “people of Kazakhstan,” the territory of Kazakhstan is described as “primordial Kazakh land.” By implication, therefore, the titular nation is regarded as the “host,” while others are the “guests.” These “guests” may acquire full citizenship, but are not regarded as having an intrinsic stake in the land, or at least, not one that is on a par with that of the Kazakhs.2 It is against this background that in Kazakhstan today terms such as “ethnic minority” and “diaspora” have come to be regarded by some as political slurs, on the grounds that they carry overtones of discrimination and exclusion.3 These sensitivities are understandable and need to be taken into account, but the\n\nTowards a typology of diasporas in Kazakhstan 23 projection of political interpretations onto terminology does not help to further scholarly debate. To be forced to take refuge in euphemisms or in vague, ill-deﬁned categories leads to obfuscation. The problem is compounded when an attempt is made to broaden the scope of the discussion. It becomes almost impossible to draw meaningful comparisons with experiences in other societies if there are no generally accepted deﬁnitions of common terms. Terminological concerns of this nature are by no means unique to Kazakhstan. In many multi-ethnic societies there are concerns as to the most appropriate way of referring to communities of immigrant origin. The issue has acquired greater immediacy in recent years as new patterns of migration have emerged, accompanied by a sharp rise in the volumes of population movements round the world. This has prompted new interest in the formation and functioning of multiethnic states, which in turn is generating a new terminology to describe dispersed, transnational communities. Increasingly, the term “diaspora” (the etymological meaning of which is “dispersal”) is gaining currency as a neutral, inclusive label for such communities. In the past, this term (often spelt with a capitalized initial) was used mainly to refer to the Jewish experience of dispersal by forced expulsion. Since the 1980s, however, the semantic sphere has been steadily widened. The term is still ﬂuid and different criteria are employed to deﬁne usage.4 However, communities as diverse as refugees, overseas merchants and guest workers now tend to be grouped together under this collective heading. This is indicative of the recognition that though the process of “dispersal” may take many forms, there are, nevertheless, common threads. Thus the expansion of the concept of “diaspora” lays the foundations for an analytical category within which the totality of the phenomenon of population movement can be examined. It is in this broad sense of a “dispersed community” that the term “diaspora” is used here. The Soviet-era term “nationality” is rendered synonymously by “ethnic group” or “people.” The term “titular nation” is a controversial usage, but it is retained here because it highlights an important issue, namely the special status of the Kazakh population within Kazakhstan. The great majority of Kazakhs regard this as their rightful due. Others observe that this special status is a reality, but do not necessarily condone it, regarding the privileging of any single ethnic group as inimical to the building of a modern, democratic state.\n\nPART I: ETHNIC SURVEY (SELECTED GROUPS) In the 1989 Soviet census, the total population for Kazakhstan was estimated at around 16,200,000.5 Some 100 ethnic groups were listed separately. Just under half were represented by fewer than 10,000 individuals (some 20 by fewer than 100). Of the remainder, approximately 20 groups numbered 10,000 to 100,000, (e.g. Kurds, Dungans, and Greeks) and some 30 groups were in the range 100,000 to one million (e.g. Koreans, Tatars, Ukrainians, and Germans). The biggest groups by far were the Russian and the Kazakh, each numbering over six million. Below the history of the titular nation is described at some length, since it is the\n\n24\n\nShirin Akiner\n\nformative experiences of the Kazakhs – or more precisely, the perception of these experiences – that shape the psychological context in which contemporary inter-ethnic relations are conducted.6 The entries in the other groups are shorter and intended only as a cursory reference.\n\n1. Titular nation The Kazakhs are predominantly of Turkic origin. It is impossible to date with certainty their ﬁrst appearance on the territory of modern Kazakhstan, but in all probability they formed part of the larger migration of Turkic tribes to the west, which occurred during the sixth century ad. Prior to this, the Sakas, an IndoEuropean people, had dominated the steppe region for hundreds of years. The incoming Turks appear to have merged with the descendants of these earlier settlers. On this basis, some Kazakh historians trace the origins of Kazakh statehood back to the Saka era, a period of some two millennia. The dominant way of life of the Turkic tribes was nomadic pastoralism, although in the south an urban culture developed along a branch of the ancient “Silk Roads.” Islam was brought to Central Asia by the Arabs in the eighth century. It ﬁrst took hold in the southern tier (modern Uzbekistan), then gradually spread northwards. In the early thirteenth century Kazakhstan came under Mongol domination. Although the Mongols did not survive as a separate ethnic group, the Kazakh aristocracy that subsequently emerged claimed direct patrilineal descent from Genghis Khan. Today, their descendants do not enjoy any formal privileges, but informally this lineage continues to command some respect. The same is true of the small number of Kazakhs who trace their genealogy back to the Arab scholars and holy men who brought Islam to the region in the medieval period. The ﬁrst identiﬁable Kazakh state formation, known as the Kazakh Khanate, was established in the ﬁfteenth century. By this time the Kazakh ruling elite had adopted Islam (of the Sunni sect, Hanaﬁ school), but the main body of the population was not fully converted until some centuries later. In the seventeenth century the Kazakhs split into three tribal confederations, known as the Big, Middle, and Small Hordes (Kazakh Ulu, Orta, and Kishi Zhus respectively). These units were further divided into tribes and clans. Each Horde had a speciﬁc geographic territory within which it conducted its annual cycle of transhumance. In the eighteenth century, under attack from Oirot Mongols ( Jungars) in the east, most Kazakh tribes sought protection from Russia, though some turned to China. The lands of the latter were incorporated into the Chinese empire in the eighteenth century; today this region forms part of Xinjiang Higher Autonomous Province. Meanwhile, Russian inﬂuence in the steppe region gradually expanded until, in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century, the Kazakh leaders (khans) were deposed and their territory annexed by the Russian empire. Members of the Kazakh aristocracy began to be educated in the Russian system at this time and several subsequently served in the Tsarist administration.
