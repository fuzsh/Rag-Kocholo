        "text": "Olympic silver medallist Rustam ORUJOV (AZE) went four from four to sail into the semi-finals where he inevitably will be pitted against teammate Hidayat HEYDAROV (AZE) who claimed pool B with the same record of 4:0.\n\nIn pool C Olympic champion ONO Shohei (JPN) breezed into the last four with an effortless display as he won all four of his bouts by ippon.\n\nAshi-waza ace Denis IARTCEV (RUS) was on form in pool D as he used all of his fear factor to win his four outings and book a meeting with ONO for a place in the final.\n\nOlympic champion from the weight below, Fabio BASILE (ITA), failed in his quest to become the first Italian man to win a world judo title as he fell in round four at the hands of Tohar BUTBUL (ISR).\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nHEYDAROV, Hidayat (AZE) V ORUJOV, Rustam (AZE) ONO, Shohei (JPN) v IARTCEV, Denis (RUS)\n\n-57kg\n\nWorld champion YOSHIDA Tsukasa (JPN) won all three of her contests in pool A to seal a semi-final berth. YOSHIDA was tested by Julia KOWALCZYK (POL) who picked up a waza-ari score before the home favourite registered her second and match-winning score.\n\nOlympic champion Rafaela SILVA (BRA) ruled Pool B to book a semi-final clash with the world champion.\n\nMontreal Grand Prix winner DEGUCHI Christa (CAN) rushed through the preliminary rounds to set up a semi-final duel against surprise package Ivelina ILIEVA (BUL) who shocked Nora GJAKOVA (KOS) in the quarter-finals."
