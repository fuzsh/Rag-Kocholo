Khojaly does not differ from horrific tragedies of Katyn, Lidice, Oradour-sur-Glane, Holocaust, Songmy, Rwanda and Srebrenica, which are etched on the minds of people forever. These atrocities went down in the history of wars as genocides of civilians that shook the world. On the night of 25-26 February 1992, the Armenian armed forces sur¬roun¬ded Khojaly with 10 tanks, 16 armored carriers, nine infantry fighting vehicles, 180 military experts and infantry units of the 366th motor rifle regiment, which was part of the 23rd division of the 4th USSR army deployed in Khankandi. Khojaly genocide is investigated in the prose and drama on the basis of Azerbaijan press named after “Yeni Azərbaycan”, “Ədəbiyyat qəzeti”, “525-ci qəzet”. Khojaly genocide is very actual problem in modern period because it is one part of our history and it is great importance to investigate the reality for literary criticism.\n\n\"One night of February 26, 1992, armed units from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) started a military operation to take out artillery positions and bring an end to the blockade of Khojaly airport. That same night, 12 kilometres away from Khojaly, in the area near the town of Aghdam, peaceful residents were found dead. Until today, the Azerbaijani authorities have used their version of the events near Aghdam (so called “the events of Khojaly”) to incite ethnic hatred and racism [towards Armenians]. However, their version of events has been disputed on the basis of factual evidence by, first of all, numerous Azerbaijani sources, as well as by independent observers.\" Content Khojaly: propaganda through tragedy The situation in the military conflict zone The humanitarian corridor – why was an evacuation of peaceful civilians not organised? Where and why did peaceful residents die? What happened to the bodies and who needed the death of peaceful civilians?\n\nThe February 25-26 taking of the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojalu in the Askeran region of NKAO by the Armenian armed forces is called “Khojalu Genocide” in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have launched and continue maintaining a large-scale propaganda campaign to present it as a genocide. The 30th anniversary of Khojalu capture will be marked soon, but to this day there is no any research on this new “genocide.” This work is an attempt to present in detail the preparation and seizing of Khojalu by the armed forces of Nagorno-Karabakh, Khojalu defense plans by the Azerbaijani authorities, as well as the actual takeover, the processes following the capture, and the fate of Khojalu population. The book also partially addresses the reasons for presenting the capture of Khojalu as an “Azerbaijani genocide,” and the groundwork for that. The book is an engaging reading not only for those interested in Karabakh conflict and its history, but also for the general public.\n\nThis paper points out the research problems concerning the Khojaly-Gedebey culture which was prevalent in the South Caucasus during the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages. The author has been studying this culture for more than ten years ; she has been carrying out research in museums, archives and stack-rooms in Azerbaijan, Russia, Germany, and Austria. In this paper she presents the problems she has found, and she brings them up to international discussion. The first problem: the name of the culture. In prior archaeological research, the cultural sites from the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages in the central and southern Caucasus are known under the following names: “Central South Caucasian culture,” “Ganja-Karabagh culture” and “Khojaly-Gedebey culture.”2European scientists did not yet dedicate comprehensive studies to that culture - with the exception of Hanchar who subsumed all finds known at that time belonging to that culture,3 and Schachner who, at least, compiled the available information,4 and also G. Kossack who pioneered contributions to the chronology in the Caucasus. They only occasionally mentioned it under all of the three names “Khojaly-Gedebey,” “Ganja-Karabakh” and “Central South Caucasian culture.”5 Based on the geographic range and the peculiarities of this culture with its distinct original characteristics, “Khojaly-Gedebey culture” is the most accurate designation for this culture.\n\nRepublic of Azerbaijan gained its independence on October 18, 1991 from the USSR. During the beginning of its independence twenty percent of Azerbaijani territories (Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding regions) were occupied by Armenian armed forces. The genocide in Khojaly town was one of the bloodiest pages in Azerbaijani history, where Armenian troops massacred Azerbaijanis in order to achieve their ethnic cleansing policies. Referring to the United Nation Convention on the Prevention of the Punishment of Genocide (1948) and the Rome Statute (1998) it can be defined that the act of the illegal occupation of Khojaly by the Armenian armed forces by killing ethnic groups and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group with a goal to eliminate could be considered as genocide. The paper will focus on the brutal actions done by Armenian Government during its occupation and address how international community responds to the event occurred in Khojaly.\n\nIn the article,there has been studied the role and influence of Khwarazmians, who went with Jalal-al-Din Mengübirti to Anatolia after his death, in the political life of the region.The entry of the commanders and military units of the Khwarezm state into the service of the Seljuq state in Anatolia and the relations of the Seljuqid rulers with the Khwarezm emirs are analyzed. At the same time, there are reasons why most of the Khwarazmian military units left the territory of Anatolia. This article is focused on why most of the Khwarazmians left Anatolia and the strained relations with the Seljuq rulers Ala al-Din Kayqobad and Ghiyath al-Din Kaykhusrav II. Ala al-Din Kayqobad and other Roman Seljuq rulers express their views on why the Khwarazmians were divided into central and eastern Anatolia and why they were later moved to the west. The article analyzes the views on the ethnic composition of the Khwarazmians. A brief history of the Beyliks Sarukhan and Germian, founded by the Khwarazmians in Anatolia, is told. There is information about the villages and their location of the \"Horzumlu\" (Khwarazmians) who lived in Anatolia from the 13 th century to the present day. Several maps related to the Khwarazmians left in Anatolia have been prepared for the article, and these maps are also provided."
