Practical importance. The article has important scientific and practical importance in terms of studying all aspects of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict in the context of national interests. The article can be useful in writing research papers, textbooks and monographs in this field. Conclusion. In conclusion, this article sheds light on the outcome of the 44-day war, covering it from various aspects. The war itself was related to many factors, including the failure of international mediators to help resolve the conflict and put pressure on Armenia, and the latter's increasingly destructive behavior. The article highlights the 44-day war, its impact on relations between Armenia and its diaspora, the economic impact of the war on the region as a whole, and its impact on international relations.\n\nThis book focuses on Post-Soviet ethnic conflicts and Russia's involvement in them. In light of its significant importance for general ethnic conflict, specifically the post-Soviet Caucasus, along with the most recent war just fought over the area from September-November 2020, this book appropriately argues that it is time to reconsider Karabakh. This project deals with the historical, social and political aspects of the Karabakh issue regarding its origins, development and the current status of the conflict subsequent to the war in the autumn of 2020. Thus, the main themes will stress these points, as well as the importance of the Karabakh issue for the future, by considering its precedents and implications for other secessionist wars. This book also explores how such wars begin and end, the international legal precedents of self-determination versus territorial integrity, its implications for post-Soviet developments and conflicts, and the latest successful weapons developments lessons from the recent war involving drones, among others such as Azerbaijanâ€™s rich oil reserves. https://www.amazon.com/Karabakh-Conflict-Between-Armenia-Azerbaijan/dp/3031162617/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZHJF89YAL2M0&keywords=Yavuz+and+Gunter+Armenia&qid=1696699497&sprefix=yavuz+and+gunter+armenia%2Caps%2C113&sr=8-1&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.18ed3cb5-28d5-4975-8bc7-93deae8f9840\n\nResume The ongoing Nagorno Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan results from two principles of international law: the main sides of conflict, Armenia and Azerbaijan, defending their position claim the self determination right of people and territorial integrity with inviolability of state borders. The main obstacle on the ongoing \" no war, no peace \" condition of negotiation process is that mutual agreed statement on these principles is not possible. [1, 33] Firstly, in order to look the legal aspects of Nagorno Karabakh conflict, there is a need to analyze the political and legal processes that created the problem around Nagorno Karabakh's legal status. Therefore the ADR period (May 1918-April 1920) is important: because those years involve the beginning of the contemporary ethnic conflict and the formation of the current legal-political position of conflict sides. On other words, analyzing the process of legal status of NK conflict during the ADR period from the frame of sides' claims and arguments is very important on the research of the legal aspects of Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The position of Azerbaijan side to the Armenian arguments 1.1. The answer of Azerbaijan side to the Armenian argument on the recognition of ADR by international community Result Sources Introduction Firstly, it is necessary to look through the legal aspects of NK problem with the historical process together. As both Armenia and Azerbaijan consider themselves right and the claims and arguments are dated to historical process or are the result of this process. The opposite historical texts form the knowledge about the root of conflict. In this article, firstly we tried to analyze the claim and arguments of conflict side on the legal status of NK during 1918-1920 with the participation of ADR. The main aim of this is to evaluate the political and legal issues of NK problem in this stage. The reason of choosing the stage of ADR for research is that this period is the beginning of the two South Caucasus neighbor people's state establishment and as well the beginning years of political-legal debate around the NK. There is a special need to analyze those periods in order to raise the fake and wrong knowledge on the legal aspects of conflict. Although in this article we made the way for the claims and arguments of armenian side on the NK in 1918-1920 and tried to answer these claims and arguments by defending Azerbaijani side. The main object in this is that to raise the wrong perception and knowledge about the political-legal background of the conflict and to illuminate the historial realities of Azerbaijan position once more.\n\nThe year 2020 was to become a decisive time for the three-decades-long Armeniaâ€“ Azerbaijan conflict. The 44-day-long war between Armenia and Azerbaijan resulted in the liberation of the Azerbaijani territories that had been under occupation by the armed forces of Armenia for nearly 30 years. The negotiation process, under the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group since 1992, did not yield any tangible results in terms of facilitating a final resolution of the conflict. This commentary will focus on the most recent events in the run-up to the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan that lasted from September 27 to November 10, 2020, and will offer some thoughts on the war itself and the myths and misperceptions associated with the Armeniaâ€“Azerbaijan conflict. The war was brought about by the unconstructive position and denialism of the leadership of Armenia across the entire duration of the peace process, which over the last two years, since the ascension to power of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, acquired a new dimension as he ramped up purposeful political and military provocations against Azerbaijan. The 44-day war undermined many myths and changed perceptions in regard to the Armeniaâ€“Azerbaijan conflict, some of which will be highlighted in this work."
