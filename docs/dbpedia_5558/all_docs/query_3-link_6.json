In accordance with the Azerbaijani legislation different sects and religions are welcomed to practice their beliefs. The Azerbaijani society will never accept any impact of any countries and their religious models. We will fight with them, Orujov stressed.\n\nHe noted that 96% of the Azerbaijani population is Muslims, while 4% belong to different religions. Azerbaijan has established favorable terms for practicing any religion, Orujov stressed."
