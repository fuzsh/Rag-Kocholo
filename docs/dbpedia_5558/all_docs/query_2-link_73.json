        "text": "Schedule\n\nThe Judo World Championships 2019 will take place from Sunday, August 25 through Sunday, September 1. Each day is dedicated to a single weight class, with weigh-ins for those athletes taking place the night before.\n\nThe action kicks off on the 25th with the extra-lightweight competitions for both men and women. The 26th sees the half-lightweights in action, with each day after that seeing the next higher weight class compete.\n\nIn every weight class, the tournament is played out in a single day, starting with preliminaries and with the finals taking place in the evening.\n\nThe final individual competitions take place on August 31, when the heavyweights will compete. September 1 then sees the mixed team competition, which wraps up the Judo World Championships for this year.\n\n2019 World Judo Championships Host\n\nThe 2019 World Judo Championships are being held at the Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. This venue is perhaps the most important arena in judo, having been built specifically to hold the judo event at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. The Nippon Budokan will also host the 2020 Summer Olympic judo.\n\nWhile Japan has been instrumental in the development of judo as a competitive sport, the World Judo Championships have been held in various locations around the world. The 2018 event took place at the National Gymnastics Arena in Baku, Azerbaijan, while the 2021 championships â€“ the event is not held in Olympic years â€“ will take place in Vienna, Austria.\n\nWorld Judo Championships Results and History\n\nThe World Judo Championships were first held in Tokyo in 1956. That first tournament looked a lot different than the event does today. When Shokichi Natsui became the first judo world champion, he did so in a single field without any weight classes, defeating fellow Japanese judoka Yoshihiko Yoshimatsu in the final.\n\nWhile Japan has always been a powerhouse in judo, they havenâ€™t held a stranglehold on the world championship. The first non-Japanese winner of the World Judo Championships with Dutch judoka Anton Geesink, who won the title in 1961.\n\n1964 saw Olympic judo contested for the first time. Weight classes were first introduced at the 1965 World Judo Championships, which took place in Rio de Janeiro. In 1980, a womenâ€™s world judo championship was held for the first time, and while it existed as a separate event for the first few years, in 1987, the menâ€™s and womenâ€™s competitions were turned into a single World Judo Championships.\n\nFor most of its history, the World Judo Championships have been held every other year. But beginning in 2009, the event has become a nearly annual competition, only being skipped in years in which the Summer Olympics are being held. That will continue in 2020 when judo will be included in the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Japan has historically been the strongest judo nation in the world. They top the World Judo Championships all-time medal table, which includes menâ€™s, womenâ€™s, and team competition.\n\nJudoka are ranked using a traditional kyu-dan grading system. While the specifics of the system vary by country, beginner students will typically start with a white belt, then progress through various colored belts as they work through the kyu ranks with a local sensei (teacher).\n\nDan ranks are traditionally only awarded by independent judges, with a judoka earning their black belt at the grade of first dan. At high dan ranks, practitioners might wear a red and white panelled belt, with 9th and 10th dan judoka sometimes wearing a red belt.\n\nJudo has been one of the many disciplines that has been heavily utilized in mixed martial arts, with judo grappling and takedowns having proven effective even at the elite level. Several prominent UFC champions have had previous competitive experience in judo, including Ronda Rousey and Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\nOdds and Tips\n\nBetting on judo requires an approach thatâ€™s similar to wagering on other combat sports. You should look at the recent results of major judo competitions, such as the previous yearâ€™s World Judo Championships. Itâ€™s also important to consider the current rankings list, which includes information on lesser tournaments held throughout the year.\n\nFor those who want to go deeper, finding head-to-head results between judoka can give insight into athletes who have a stylistic advantage over particular opponents.\n\nJudo isnâ€™t a sport that sees tremendous turnover from year to year, so most of the medal winners from the previous world championships tend to perform well again the following season. In fact, several of the 2018 gold medal winners are coming in as the top seeds in their weight classes for the 2019 World Judo Championships, including the following:\n\nMollaei (Menâ€™s Half-Middleweight)\n\nNikoloz Sherazadishvili (Menâ€™s Middleweight)\n\nGuram Tushishvili (Menâ€™s Heavyweight)\n\nTsukasa Yoshida (Womenâ€™s Lightweight)\n\nClarisse Agbegnenou (Womenâ€™s Half-Middleweight)\n\nChizuru Arai (Womenâ€™s Middleweight)\n\nThere are typically only two markets available for judo betting: outright bets on who will win each weight class, and individual match betting. Odds typically become available for the World Judo Championships at online sports betting sites in the days just before the event begins.\n\nFree Bets and Betting Offers\n\nBookmakers offer a variety of free bet offers for new customers as a way to welcome them to their sites. One of the simplest offers is a matching bonus that gives you free credit to use however you like in the bookies. Other bookies offer boosted odds on specific bets or will give you your money back in credit if you lose your first bet after opening your account.\n\nWhile bookmakers rarely create offers specifically for the World Judo Championships, our list of recommended betting sites all offer brilliant bonuses."
