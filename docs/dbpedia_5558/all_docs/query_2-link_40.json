        "text": "On August 3, a traditional gala night was held in Paris, the capital of France, organized by the International Judo Federation. Representatives of the Olympic participating countries selected for their special services in the field of sports were invited to the event.\n\nThe general secretary of the National Olympic Committee of Azerbaijan Azer Aliyev, Minister of Youth and Sports Farid Gayibov, and Deputy Minister Mariana Vasileva participated in the gala evening.\n\nAt the special invitation of the President of the European Judo Union, Laszlo Toth, the president of the Association of Azerbaijan Judo Veterans, a member of the Executive Committee of the Azerbaijan Judo Federation, a multiple winner and prize-winner of the world and European championships among veteran masters, the founder of the sports club “Judo Club 2012”, Azer Askerov was among the official guests of the event.\n\nIt should be noted that the Azerbaijani delegation feels the constant care of the President of the European Judo Union Laszlo Tot and his wife Afag Tapdigova.\n\nIt should be noted that Azerbaijani judokas won 2 gold medals at the Paris-2024 Summer Olympic Games. The medals were won by Hidayat Heydarov (-73 kg) and Zelim Kotsoyev (-100 kg), a member of “Judo Club 2012”. With this result, our team achieved a historic result by finishing the judo competitions with the overall score and in second place among men after the Japanese team (3 gold, 1 silver, 3 bronze).\n\nThe farewell ceremony of the Azerbaijani Olympic team that will participate in “Paris-2024” was held. 48 athletes from our country will participate in the upcoming Summer Olympic Games. The honor of carrying the Azerbaijani flag at the opening ceremony held in Paris was entrusted to judoka Gultaj Mammadaliyeva and boxer Mahammad Abdullayev.\n\nThe Olympic Games are one of the most significant events in the world of sports. They are held every four years and bring together athletes from all over the world representing their countries in various sports. Games help to strengthen international relations, cultural exchange, and mutual understanding between nations, inspiring millions of people to achieve high results and strive for excellence. Games have a special attitude not only by athletes but also by sports fans. The opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games are also an important tradition that showcases the culture of the host country.\n\nThe Olympic movement, founded by Pierre de Coubertin at the end of the 19th century, is based on ancient Greek traditions. One of the main traditions is the lighting of the Olympic torch, which is a symbol of peace, unity, and friendship between nations. The Olympic torch is lit in Greece and carried by relay to the venue of the games. During the Olympic Games, a truce was declared between the hostile parties, and those who violated it were punished. Unfortunately, these principles are not always followed now, but at least efforts are made to stop armed conflicts during the Olympic Games. Despite the differences in political views, different geopolitical interests, and mental characteristics, representatives of different regions are united by the love of sports, which improves the world.\n\nSport is a world of justice, honesty, perseverance, and strength, a world where anyone with a strong spirit has a place. “O sport! You are peace!” – this saying of Baron Pierre de Coubertin became the slogan of peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the world. It should be, but unfortunately, the world has never been ideal.\n\nThe Olympic Games are distinguished by their scale and international importance, bringing together athletes from more than 200 countries. I think every athlete dreams of participating in the Olympic Games. The situation led to the fact that I could not participate in the Olympics as an athlete, but I always watched the Olympic sports competitions, of course, first of all, the competitions between judokas with great impatience. For a judoka, any competition is, first of all, an exam, an opportunity to test one’s capabilities, and a holiday, but the attitude to the Olympic Games is especially sensitive, exciting, and joyful.\n\nThe real rise period of the Olympic movement in Azerbaijan began after the election of the Honorable President Mr. Ilham Aliyev as the head of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) in 1997.\n\nI would like to proudly remind you of one important fact: after the restoration of state independence, the first Olympic gold medal was brought to Azerbaijan by our famous judoka, my dear friend Nazim Huseynov. In 1992, he won a gold medal at the XXV Summer Olympic Games held in Barcelona (Spain) and wrote his name in golden letters in the history of Azerbaijani sports.\n\nThen there was a period of stagnation in judo that lasted up to 16 years. And only after President Ilham Aliyev became the head of the Azerbaijan NOC, the revival of our judo began.\n\nAnother prominent representative of Azerbaijani judo, Elnur Mammadli, became the champion of the Beijing (China) Summer Olympic Games in 2008. Our judokas Mevlud Miraliyev (Beijing 2000), Irina Kindzerskaya (Tokyo 2020), Elmar Gasimov, Rustam Orujov (Rio de Janeiro 2016) who won medals in the following Olympics also made a worthy contribution to the development of judo in our country.\n\nOf course, there are still members of the Azerbaijani judo family among our athletes, who we hope will achieve high achievements in the Paris Olympics. 7 male and 2 female athletes will represent our country in judo competitions. I am especially pleased that among them is the “Judo Club 2012” representative Zelim Kotsoyev.\n\nI believe that each of our athletes will make sacrifices to raise the Azerbaijani flag and sing our national anthem in France, and I pray to God that we will experience that proud moment together!\n\nWe expect brilliant Olympic victories, medals, and worthy participation in such a prestigious tournament from representatives of various sports. Good luck!\n\nAzer Askerov\n\nJune 26 – Day of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan, we celebrate with pride and gratitude. This special day embodies the realization of our dreams and hopes, our desire for justice and freedom. Today, we pay our respects to the brave and victorious Azerbaijani Army, which has become a symbol of the strength and courage of our people.\n\nFor more than 30 years, we dreamed of a powerful army that would liberate our lands from occupation, take revenge for the spilled blood of innocent peaceful residents of Azerbaijan, give us a sense of pride and dignity, and return the original owners to their lands. Finally, this dream of ours came true in 2023 thanks to the sacrifice and bravery of our heroic soldiers.\n\nThe political will, determination, and wisdom of the Commander-in-Chief of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, based on the absolute faith of our people in their leader, unwavering unity around him, and complete trust in the measured decisions and steps taken by him, as well as the dedication and courage of the Azerbaijani military, played an important role in achieving a crushing victory over the invaders.\n\nToday, the Azerbaijani Army is victorious, an army that has restored historical justice. He won the love and respect of his people and proved that it was impossible to break and subjugate Azerbaijan. Our soldiers and officers risk their lives and do everything to prevent the recurrence of the tragedies that befell our compatriots, the multi-ethnic people of Azerbaijan.\n\nWe are proud of our army, which has become the guarantor of peace and stability in the region, in addition to protecting our people. We are grateful to our servicemen for their bravery and courage and for being ready to defend the Motherland to the last drop of blood.\n\nOn this significant day, we bow before the spirit of our martyrs, and the skill and bravery of our compatriots who died for the freedom and independence of Azerbaijan. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten, their heroism will live forever in the hearts of our people!\n\nHappy holiday, dear compatriots! May our army always be strong and invincible, and our people united and indomitable!\n\nThe brave army of Azerbaijan is truly loved and respected by the people. Love our Armed Forces!\n\nBest wishes to the victorious Commander-in-Chief of the Azerbaijan Armed Forces, Mr. Ilham Aliyev!\n\nAzer Askerov\n\nEid al-Adha is one of the most sacred holidays of Islam and one of the most important virtues of Islam. Eid al-Adha is associated with the story of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) who was ready to sacrifice his son as a sign of obedience to God. This holiday symbolizes not only faith and loyalty, but also the Almighty’s mercy, generosity, and care for his servants.\n\nEid al-Adha has a deep spiritual meaning and includes several main aspects. The story of Hazrat Ibrahim (peace be upon him) teaches us to trust the Creator and be ready to fulfill His will. This holiday reminds us of the importance of faith and obedience.\n\nOne of the important rites of the Eid al-Adha is giving alms, that is, sacrificing an animal and distributing it. The meat is divided into three parts: one part remains for the family, the second is given to friends and relatives, and the third is distributed to the poor. It symbolizes generosity and caring, as well as the importance of helping those in need.\n\nEid al-Adha allows for strengthening relationships within the family and society. People gather together to pray, eat together, and support each other, which fosters a sense of community and togetherness. Tables full of traditional food are a symbol of joy and unity. Eid al-Adha contains deep moral principles that are important not only for Muslims but also for all mankind.\n\nEid al-Adha includes several traditional ceremonies and events. The ceremony begins with morning prayers in mosques, where pious Muslims gather to thank God and ask for his blessings. This ritual symbolizes peace, mercy, love, and respect for each other.\n\nSince Eid al-Adha is a time of good deeds, charity is an important part of the spiritual and moral values ​​of a Muslim. This is not only a religious holiday, but also a time when people think about their spiritual and moral values ​​and strengthen their faith.\n\nHappy holiday, dear brothers and sisters! May God accept your prayers and sacrifices!\n\nWith great respect to all of you,\n\nAzer Askerov\n\nThe Azerbaijani judo family is again experiencing great joy and pride. We are doubly happy to be the “Judo Club 2012” team! The activity of the club, Zelim gizil gizilimizsoyev, one of our most talented Collective, the head of the United Arab Emirates 0, won a medal in the -1 kg weight category at the world championship held in Abu Dhabi, and in this prestigious competition, he succeeded in creating the Azerbaijan flag and singing our National Anthem.\n\nThe First Vice-President of Azerbaijan Mehriban Aliyeva congratulated Zelim on the occasion of this great president. Thank you, dear lady. It is the state care for sports, all kinds of conditions of Mr. President Ilham Aliyev in this field that inspire the leaders of the country to achieve great achievements.\n\nI would like to emphasize that Zelim prepared high perseverance and moral and psychological preparation for the world championship. On the way to the final, he managed to increase the strongest judoka in the world. He fought like a knight and won without being removed from anyone’s name and fame.\n\nZelim Kotsoyev will go to the Paris-2024 Summer Olympic Games as the leader of the rating table of his weight, and we believe that he will perform successfully at the Olympics.\n\nI also heartily congratulate our dear friend Elkhan Mammadov, who played a special role in its organization, who won the world championship 11 years ago and wrote on the golden page of Azerbaijan’s judo history!\n\nZelim, we are proud of you, we are waiting for new forces!\n\nAzer Askerov\n\nHidayat Heydarov, one of the pioneers of modern Azerbaijani judo, won a gold medal at the world championship held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and gave us great joy and pride. The last time this gold was brought to our country 11 years ago by our friend Elkhan Mammadov, who is now a judo veteran…\n\nToday, Hidayat is at the peak of his sports career: he is a four-time European champion, and he is the first in the world ranking in his weight class! First of all, his personal coach, the living legend of Azerbaijani judo Tarlan Hasanov, has an exceptional role in his success. I heartily congratulate my dear teacher on the great victory of his young student.\n\nI know that Mr. Tarlan expects an Olympic championship from Hidayat, and I would very much like his dream to come true.\n\nAnd I must mention that it is the irreplaceable care and attention of the Honorable President Mr. Ilham Aliyev that inspires Azerbaijani athletes to raise our national flag and sing our Anthem by winning prestigious international competitions. Such attention and care has a strong influence on the establishment of the Azerbaijan Judo Federation at a high level and on the development of this popular sport in our country.\n\nOnce again, I congratulate Hidayat Heydarov on becoming the world champion, I wish him new successes and victories! Young friend, we imagine you on the first step of the Olympic podium!\n\nAzer Askerov\n\nThe International Mugham Centre has hosted an official award ceremony for winners of the 2nd National Television Festival of Sports Films and Programs, established by the National Olympic Committee (NOC), Azernews reports.\n\nAt the event, Vice-President of the National Olympic Committee Chingiz Huseynzade, General Secretary of the National Olympic Committee Azer Aliyev, the chairman of the festival’s jury Zemfira Meftakhetdinova, chairman of the Judo Club 2012 Public Union, President of the Association of Azerbaijan Judo Veterans, the winner of the world and European championships among master judokas Azer Asgarov, member of the Executive Committee of the Azerbaijan Judo Federation, members of the NOC Executive Committee and the jury of the festival, Olympic champions, heads of sports federations and television channels, well-known athletes, and public figures participated in the awarding ceremony.\n\nNOC Vice President Chingiz Huseynzade, who spoke at the ceremony, greeted the guests and stressed the importance of the festival. He pointed out that the National Television Festival of Sports Films and Programs dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the National Olympic Committee was established in 2022 for the first time.\n\n“When we organised the festival for the first time, we did not know whether this festival would continue in the future or not. Today, the numbers were announced. If 40 videos were presented at the first festival, 58 videos were presented at this festival.

This is a time when our faith deepens, we get closer to God, and we strive for perfection. Overcoming our ego, showing generosity to those in need, and earning the reward of every day through worship and prayers are the important virtues of Ramadan.\n\nThe traditions of this holy month, founded by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), are preserved and implemented in our country. Fasting is a symbol of spiritual purification, faith, and revival for all of us. After all, fasting is not only about giving up all bad habits and forbidden things. It has a deep meaning: by fulfilling the requirements of fasting, a person accustoms himself to good deeds throughout his life.\n\nIn this blessed month, we pray that our unity and solidarity will strengthen us and that Ramadan will bring us peace, joy, and prosperity.\n\nAccording to tradition, in this month, which is considered holy for every Muslim, characteristics such as mercy, charity, forgiveness, and helping the poor are more clearly manifested.\n\nRamadan holiday is marked by the end of the holy month in which we fast. Eid starts at sunset on the last day of Ramadan and continues until the evening of the next day. Muslims congratulate each other, give gifts, and are sure that the coming year will be even more successful, full of happiness, prosperity, and joy, inshallah!\n\nHappy Ramadan!\n\nMay God Almighty accept our prayers for the further strengthening of our state, unity, prosperity, spiritual wealth, inner peace, and well-being of our people! Amen!\n\nAzer Askerov"
