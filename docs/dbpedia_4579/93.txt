Athens Sights & Monuments - The Arch of Hadrian in Athens, Greece is an impressive example of ancient Greek architecture. This iconic structure, constructed of white Pentelic marble, can be found on the Athens road that leads from the city center to the Temple of Olympian Zeus. The arch is made up of marble slabs that are expertly connected using brackets, eliminating the need for cement. Its design features three rectangular sections with Corinthian columns and pilasters. On one side of the arch, visitors can read the inscription "This is Athens, a city of Theseus," while on the other side, the inscription reads "It is not the city of Theseus, but Adrian."

Throughout history, the Arch of Hadrian has played various roles in Athenian society. In the 18th century, it served as one of seven gates in the defensive wall that the Turks built to protect the city from Albanian raiders. Despite its lack of full protection, this monument has remained remarkably well-preserved over time. Unfortunately, in recent years, pollution has caused the original material to become extensively discolored, and the inscriptions have begun to degrade.

If you're planning a trip to Athens, don't miss the opportunity to visit the Arch of Hadrian. This iconic landmark is a must-see for history buffs and architecture enthusiasts alike.
