        "text": "Architectural Splendor of the Arch\n\nThe grandeur of the arch lies in its colossal dimensions and intricate design details. Standing at a height of 21 meters, it features a rectangular structure with three arched gateways. Each of these gateways exhibits a dual façade, facing both north towards the city and south towards the road.\n\nDual Facades and Tripartite Design\n\nThe arch's dual facades, while similar, present subtle architectural differences. The central archway, larger and higher than the two flanking ones, is framed by four massive Corinthian columns. These columns stand on pedestals and bases, adorned with a decoration of acanthus leaves. The vertical arrangement of these elements creates a visually pleasing rhythm that enhances the overall aesthetics of the arch.\n\nUse of Corinthian Capitals\n\nInterestingly, the arch showcases the use of Corinthian capitals, characteristic of Roman architecture, but with a twist. Unlike traditional designs where capitals crown the top of columns, this monument features them at the bottom. This unconventional placement lends a unique charm to the structure.\n\nIntricate Decorative Details\n\nThe craftsmanship of the arch is further accentuated by the intricate decorative details. The architrave of the main arch, as well as those of the two flanking arches, are supported by two flanking pilasters topped by two capitals. Above the two flanking archways are identical niches, each standing on a small entablature supported by two pilasters crowned with capitals.\n\nInspired?

The arch, which was probably wider in its original form, now stands restored to its former glory, continuing to awe visitors with its architectural magnificence.\n\nThe Arch as a Symbol of Expansion\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian was not merely a commemorative monument; it was also a symbol of the planned expansion of Gerasa. Its location, about 460 meters southward of the main Southern Gate, indicates a plan for the city's southward expansion. However, the envisaged expansion was never fully implemented."
