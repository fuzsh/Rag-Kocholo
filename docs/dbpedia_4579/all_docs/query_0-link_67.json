It was dedicated to \"Olympian\" Zeus, a name originating from his position as head of the Olympian gods.

During the Roman period, the temple, which included 104 colossal columns, was renowned as the largest temple in Greece and housed one of the largest cult statues in the ancient world.\n\nWikipedia: Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens (EN)\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian, most commonly known in Greek as Hadrian's Gate, is a monumental gateway resembling—in some respects—a Roman triumphal arch.
