It has three arched gates and the Queen of Sheba, is said to have passed under those gates while on her way to visit King Solomon. The gate was closed inside the city walls and unused for many years, only being revealed when the valls eventually collapsed. With the exception of the pillars, the gate is made entirely of white marble with striking ornamentation."
