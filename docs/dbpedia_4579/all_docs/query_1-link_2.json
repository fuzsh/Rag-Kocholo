        "text": "Location: Syntagma\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian in Athens is a triumphal arch which lies in proximity to Syntagma Square, right between the Acropolis and the Temple of Olympian Zeus. On the northwest, this monument faces the Monument of Lycicrates in Plaka. The construction of this temple started in 131 AD when the people wanted to celebrate the arrival of the Roman Emperor Hadrian and thank him for his benefactions to the city. The architect and builders of the arch are unknown to this day.\n\nIts location is not random, but rather symbolic. In fact, it was strategically selected to mark the line between the ancient part of Athens and Hadrian's new city.\n\nTAKE A SIGHTSEEING TOUR OF ATHENS!\n\nWith this walking tour, you have the chance to discover the most important historical landmarks in the center of Athens, including the Arch of Hadrian.\n\nBook the tour!\n\nMade of fine Pentelic marble, this arch is 18 meters high, 12,5 meters wide and 2,3 meters deep. Its architecture is similar to other Roman arches and it is crowned by pilasters of the Corinthian rhythm. Its design is fully symmetrical.\n\nThe monument has two layers. At the center of the lower layer, there is an arched gate through which people can pass. Also, there were two columns, which do not exist anymore and are connected by architraves between the two layers.\n\nTwo inscriptions are carved in the architrave, one on each side: the first, on the side towards the Acropolis, reads \"This is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus\", while the second, on the side facing the new city, reads \"This is the city of Hadrian and not of Theseus\".\n\nIt is obvious that the ancient city formed new districts due to the expansion that was made by the Emperor.\n\nGiven that the monument was never fully protected, it has survived time in extraordinary condition. Unfortunately, in recent decades, pollution has caused extensive discoloration of the original material and degradation of the inscriptions.\n\nTop Tours and activities\n\nBest Seller -10.00%\n\nSpecial Offer: 10.00% discount for early booking (-60 days).\n\nSightseeing tour with Acropoli...\n\nCategory: City\n\nThis tour allows guests to visit the Acropolis and the New Acropolis Museum after passing by some of the most impressive and interesting sights around the city!\n\n4 hours Map\n\nfrom € 71.10\n\nBook now\n\nBest Seller\n\nFull-day Athens tour with Cape Sounion\n\nCategory: City, Day Trips\n\nDo not miss out on this incredible full-day tour of Athens, which includes visits to the Acropolis, the New Museum of Acropolis, the otherworldly Cape Sounion, and a lunch break in between!\n\n1 Day Map\n\nfrom € 142.00\n\nBook now\n\nWalking tour with Acropolis and city tour\n\nCategory: City, Walking\n\nHop on this fascinating walking tour around the centre of Athens, starting from the Greek Parliament and finishing at the majestic Parthenon atop the Acropolis Hill.\n\n3 hours & 30 min Map\n\nfrom € 39.00\n\nBook now\n\nHow to get there\n\nThere are many ways to reach the Arch of Hadrian from any location in Athens.\n\nTours: Discover the Arch of Hadrian with an organized tour.\n\nPrivate transfers: We recommend using an online pre-booked transfer service, which provides transfer by taxi, minibus, or private VIP car and arranging a pickup directly from the port, airport, or your hotel.
