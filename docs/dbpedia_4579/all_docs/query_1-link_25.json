The Arch of Hadrian is the triumphal arch that is built out of Pendelic marble by Athenian hands in 131 A.D. on an ancient road that led from the old to the new Roman region of the city to honor Hadrian.\n\nThe architrave has two inscriptions which seem to have had the purpose of dictating the border between the Ancient and the Roman city.\n\nOn the side facing the Acropolis it writes:\n\n\"This is Athens, the ancient city of Theseus\",\n\nand on the other side is written:\n\n\"This is the city of Hadrian and not of Theseus\".\n\nThe Arch of Hadrian is located outside the fenced archaeological site of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, directly on Vasilissis Amalias Avenue and can be admired from all sides."
