It is if the architect went out of his way to make this arch different from the others, or perhaps to make it fit the other monuments of the city.\n\nStanding under it, one can see the Acropolis on one side, and the Temple of Zeus on the other. In this photo, taken from the West, the columns of the latter are just visible under the trees behind the arch."
