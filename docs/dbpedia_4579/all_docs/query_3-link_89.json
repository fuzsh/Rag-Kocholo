        "text": "English: In 131-132 A.D., a triumphal arch known as Hadrian’s Gate, was erected by the Athenians northwest of the Olympieion precinct in honor of the emperor Hadrian for his many public works in Athens. It was built on the road linking the city with the Ilissian sanctuaries, marking the boundary between the old and the new city.\n\nThe monument, 18 m high, 13,50 m wide, had two facades with the same features and was divided vertically into two distinct parts. The lower one recalled the roman form of an honorary arch, while the upper one was related to the traditional Greek propylon.\n\nThere were two inscriptions on the architrave above the archway:\n\nOn the west side: THIS IS ATHENS THE ANCIENT CITY OF THESEUS. On the east side: THIS IS THE CITY OF HADRIAN AND NOT OF THESEUS.\n\nIn 1778 the triumphal arch was incorporated into the eastern section of the Turkish fortification, known as “Haseki’s Wall”, at which time it was converted into a gate, called the Vasilopoula’s Gate” or “Kamaroporta”.\n\nText credit: Inscription set at the archaeological site of the Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens, by the Ministry of Culture."
