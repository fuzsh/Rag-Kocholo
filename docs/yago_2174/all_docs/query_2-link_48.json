        "text": "Martin, also called (until 1395) Mart√≠n, Duke (duque) de Montblanch (b. 1356, Gerona, Catalonia, d. 1410, Barcelona), king of Aragon from 1396 and of Sicily (as Martin II). He was the son of Peter IV and brother of John I of Aragon.\n\nMartin's life was marked chiefly by the continued Aragonese intervention in Sicily. When Frederick III of Sicily died in 1377, leaving a daughter, Mary, as his heiress, there ensued a long period of disorder. Peter IV of Aragon, on the grounds that females were excluded from succession to the Sicilian crown, claimed it for himself as the nearest male heir; and Mary underwent a series of abductions. Peter, however, in the face of objections from the papacy and the Angevins, in 1380 ceded his pretensions to his son, Martin, whose own son Martin was to marry Mary. Peter IV died in 1387, leaving Aragon to his elder son John I; the queen of Sicily was brought to Spain in 1388, and her marriage to the younger Martin took place in 1390. In 1392 the couple landed in Sicily with Martin of Montblanch and began to reign as queen and king-consort, despite strong local opposition. Mary died in 1401, leaving her widower to reign alone as Martin I of Sicily; but meanwhile Martin de Montblanch had become king of Aragon as Martin I in 1395 through the death of John I. When Martin I of Sicily died without legitimate issue in 1409, he left his kingdom, with his second wife, Blanche of Navarre, as regent, to his father, who thus became Martin II.\n\nMartin, who had no surviving children of his own, intended that Sicily at least, if not Aragon too, should go to his grandson Fadrique (Frederick) de Luna, a bastard of Martin I of Sicily. On Martin's death, however, in 1410, this succession was contested; and Ferdinand of Antequera, son of Peter IV's daughter Leonor, having been chosen king of Aragon as Ferdinand I in 1412, defeated Fadrique's partisans and reestablished Blanche's authority as his regent in Sicily. Thenceforward the Aragonese (later the Spanish) and the Sicilian crowns were to remain united for nearly 300 years (until the War of the Spanish Succession)."
