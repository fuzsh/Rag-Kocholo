        "text": "King Alfonso V of Aragon had no children with his wife, Maria of Castile. Upon his death he was succeeded by younger brother in Aragon and by illegitimate son in Naples. Say that ATL Maria of Castile is not childless-she has 3 surviving kids with Alfonso (Ferdinand b. 1422, Alfonso Jr b. 1426, Eleanor b. 1433). What impact would legitimate offspring of Alfonso have?\n\nI think he would still divide Naples and Aragon-younger son would inherit Naples while older would rule Aragon. That means John, brother of Alfonso V, is only King of Navarre iure uxoris in this TL (and he can't disinherit his son by Blanche in favour of son from second marriage, if he ever remarries ITTL and has any sons by second wife) and would lost even that position after death of Blanche. Thus Kingdom of Navarre could have its own Trastamara line.\n\nMeanwhile daughter of Alfonso V could became Holy Roman Empress instead of her Portuguese cousin and namesake-Alfonso IOTL was in favour of a match between HRE Frederick and his Portuguese niece. If he had his own legitimate daughter it seems obvious he'd preffer said daughter as Empress. For Pope and Emperor match with daughter of King of Naples also should be more desirable than match with Portuguese infanta.\n\nSome toughts about Navarre: if Charles of Viana still looks for support of his uncle Alfonsi in Naples against father, perhaps he befriends his cousins there and new King of Aragon (Ferdinand II, son of Alfonso V) helps him if John illegally refuses him rights to Navarrese throne? John, not having Aragon, is in worse position than IOTL, especially if his nephew is against him.\n\nWith not being king of Aragon here, can Juan block Carlos' succession? I mean, would he have a powerbase in Navarre that could allow this?\n\nAny suggestions for ITTL alternate marriages @Kellan Sullivan @isabella\n\nI'm thinking about something like that:\n\n-Eleanor of Portugal (OTL Holy Roman Empress) and Ferdinand II of Aragon\n\n-Catherine of Portugal and Charles IV of Navarre\n\nMeanwhile Alfonso Jr, King of Naples (and perhaps also od Sicily) would need wife of higher birth than OTL bastard son of Alfonso V.\n\nWell marrying on the high nobility of the land he rule would not be without precedent (see Juan II of Aragon’s OTL second wedding) and Isabella’s family was pretty high (she was the heiress of her maternal uncle, the prince of Taranto) and her maternal grandmother was also once Queen Consort of Naples (she had her children from the first wedding and became Queen Consort through her second).\n\nAbout the other two weddings they can work but John would still most likely be able to continue to rule over Navarre until his death (as I think improbable who either Ferdinand II of Aragon or Henry IV of Castile would have any interest in helping Carlos against Juan) so I would still let succession in Castile go through Eleanor and her children unless she has married differently than OTL.\n\nI'd make OT in my own thread, but I'm thinking about daughter of John II of Castile from first marriage (Catherine or Eleanor) surviving. Would we see double Navarrese-Castilian marriage in such case with Charles of Viana married to Castilian infanta before death of his mother? Such marriage would strenght position of Charles.\n\nI suspect it would also mean that Juan of Aragon, King of Navarre, wouldn't remarry to Juana Enriquez. She was a scion of the Castilian royal family. AIUI he married Juana because she was beautiful but also because it was in Castilian interests to allow the marriage. If Carlos has a Castilian bride I don't see the Castilian king backing one of his nobles' daughters' candidacy. Especially if the relationship between Juan and Carlos is as fraught as OTL"
