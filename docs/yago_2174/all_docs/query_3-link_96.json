Perteneciente a la Dinastía de Evreux. Heredera del trono de Navarra desde la muerte de su hermana mayor Juana (1413).\n\nEn 1402 contrajo matrimonio con Martín \"el Joven\", rey de Sicilia y heredero de la Corona de Aragón. Muerto éste en 1409 pasó a gobernar la isla, regresó a Navarra y contrajo matrimonio en segundas nupcias con Juan II de Aragón, hijo de Fernando de Antequera y hermano de Alfonso V \"el Magnánimo\", rey de Aragón.\n\nLa abulia (pérdida de iniciativa) que le caracterizaba, permitió que Navarra quedara sometida en todo a su marido y a sus intereses, perdiendo el reino territorios fronterizos como consecuencia de la intervención armada de Juan II en los asuntos de Castilla (1428-29).\n\nDe la unión con Juan II de Aragón nació Carlos, príncipe de Viana, quien -según las capitulaciones matrimoniales de 1419- debía heredar el reino de Navarra a la muerte de su madre. Pero al morir doña Blanca, su esposo usurpó el trono navarro, alegando entre otras razones el testamento en el que la reina recomendaba a Carlos que no se hiciese coronar sin consentimiento de su padre.\n\nCarlos de Viana, declaró la guerra su padre (1451-1461): reclutó el apoyo de los montañeses de Beaumont (beamonteses) y del propio condestable castellano, Alvaro de Luna. Pero Juan II le derrotó una y otra vez, al tiempo que se casaba con la castellana Juana Enríquez (1447) que le daría un hijo, el futuro Fernando el Católico.\n\nHijos [editar]Carlos (1421 - 1461), Príncipe de Viana, casado con Inés de Cleves, sobrina de Felipe III, Duque de Borgoña.\n\nJuana (1423 - 1425).\n\nBlanca (1424 - 1464), casada con Enrique IV, rey de Castilla y León.\n\nLeonor (1425 - 1479), sucesora al trono de Navarra, casada con Gaston IV de Foix, Conde de Foix y Vizconde de Bearn.\n\nPrecedido por:\n\nCarlos III\n\nReina de Navarra\n\nPeríodo:\n\n1425 - 1441 Sucedido por:\n\nCarlos IV y Juan II\n\nBlanche I, Queen Nararre and Castile\n\nShe was the daughter of King Charles III of Navarre and infanta Eleanor of Castile\n\nBlanche married firstly Martin the Younger, King of Sicily and Crown Prince of Aragon.
