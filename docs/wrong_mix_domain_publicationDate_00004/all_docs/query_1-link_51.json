        "text": "Mac joined the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in June or July 1945, not because of a sudden conversion to its politics or Marxist economics and philosophy, but because, as he later disclosed “…I had just met a lot of Russian POW’s in Norway, because the Soviet Army had just then rolled back the Germans.” (National Archives, KV2/3967, Malcolm Hulke to Executive Committee, 16th November 1951) He later wrote that his adoption of Communism had been “more an emotional expression than a logical conclusion.” (National Archives KV2/3968, Malcolm Hulke to Emile Burns, 14th June 1949)\n\nDirected by Moscow, the CPGB had initially opposed the war after Stalin had done a deal with Hitler in August 1939, both dictators pledging not to attack each other, but when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22nd June 1941, the line changed and the British party faithfully swung fully behind the war. Its members now set up Anglo-Soviet Friendship Societies and played a leading roles in committees to increase productivity in war factories.\n\nThe party gained a great deal of prestige when the Red Army held Hitler’s armies at Moscow in 1941, encircled and broke the 6th Army commanded by Friedrich Paulus at Stalingrad in 1943, and then drove the German armies all the way back to Berlin, which they took in April 1945 after a ferocious battle which shattered the city.\n\nIn the 1945 general election the CPGB polled over 100, 000 votes and had two members of parliament elected – Willie Gallacher (West Fife) and Phil Piratin (Mile End) – as well as over 200 councillors in different parts of Britain. The climate soon changed however, with the beginning of the Cold War between the East and the West, often dated to a speech that Winston Churchill made on 5th March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri, in which he said that “an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.” Whilst anti-Communism in Britain never reached the levels of hysteria and paranoia that it did in the United States during the McCarthyite witchhunts of the late 1940s and early 1950s, which destroyed hundreds of people’s lives, it was not a popular or easy choice to be known as a Communist while party members were closley monitored by the authorities as we shall see.\n\nThe Communist party placed a great deal of importance on political education. Mac would have been encouraged to attend evening meetings and weekend schools on economics, history and politics as wella s social events. He may well have met some of the historians, poets, writers and musicians who belonged to the party in that era. These included Peter Blackman, Alan Bush, Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm, Doris Lessing, Edgell Rickword, John Saville, Montague Slater, Randall Swingler, Edward Thompson and Dona Torr.\n\nMac would have also been encouraged to understand the importance of discipline, of placing the interests and decisions of the party before personal preferences and desires. (This may have later helped his writing career, discipline is a very useful asset for writers faced with the inevitable fast-approaching deadlines.)\n\nBack home in Braithwaite after being demobbed, Mac was enrolled as member of the Cockermouth branch, as there was no branch in Keswick. In the summer of 1946 he went down to London and transferred to the Marylebone branch where his party activity included becoming Secretary of the Marylebone Young Communist League. He also took part in picketing at the Savoy and in the squatting movement in the autumn of 1946 (National Archives KV 2/3967, Malcolm Hulke to Betty Reid, 28th January 1952)\n\nTed Willis – with whom Mac later worked on a number of television series and worked with to set up the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain – was National Secretary of the YCL from 1946 to 1951, writing a pamphlet called Fighting youth of Russia: the story of the young men and women of the Soviet Union (1942). It seems likely that it was in the YCL that Mac and Ted met for the first time, a friendship which would endure until Mac’s death.\n\nUnity Theatre\n\nIn the early 1950s Malcolm became involved with the socialist theatre company, Unity Theatre, founded in 1935, which after 1937 was housed in a former chapel on Goldington Street, Somers Town, London.\n\nColin Chambers, who has written the history of the theatre, says: that the Unity began:\n\n…with irrepressible determination amid the political struggles of the early 1930s that were fought against the savage cuts in state benefits, the imposed means tests, the waste of widespread unemployment and poverty, and above all against the rise of fascism. Four decades later, when the theatre’s auditorium was destroyed by fire, Unity had become a shadow of its former glories. Yet, despite its non-professional status and limited size, Unity made a major and lasting contribution to the British theatre through its own work and that of its members who became professional. It pioneered direct political commentary on stage, in its satires and documentary-based shows and developed a drama that represented working-class life and speech with insight and integrity. (Colin Chambers, The Story of Unity Theatre (1989), p.17).\n\nAcording to Colin Chambers by 1952 : “Unity was in serious trouble in those days and there had been a major internal dispute in 1952 over who was to blame for the theatre’s plight. A conference at the end of that year was highly critical of the management committee but offered no realistic solutions (plays drawn directly from life and classics that reflected peoples’ struggles). The perceived failings of a production at the end of the year – Christmas Bridge by Nancy MacMillan – led to a change in the leadership and the general manager Mick Manning going. ” (email from Colin Chambers, 15th January 2021) There is short note in files based on a report made by Aaronovitch which states that Mac was “playing a bad role in Unity Theatre conflct – with Hancock and Felber.” There are no further notes on this subject (National Archives, KV 2/3967, January 1953)\n\nIn January 1953 Mac wote a short note to Harry Pollitt, the party’s General Secretary who attended the first night of The Bridge of Life by Julius Hay, a British premiere of a prize-winning play by Hungary’s leading playwright. Mac apologised to Pollitt being “tipsy” : “Despite whatever on hears about conduct at Unity, we are really a well behaved group, though perhaps a little high spirited. I think I was probably more drunk with tiredness and the strain of the first-hand night than with Hungarian Vodka.” (National Archives, KV 2/3967, Malcolm Hulke to Harry Pollitt, 20th January 1953. My thanks to Colin Chambers for identifying the play)\n\nThere was a group of Communist party members in Unity known as “Unity Leadership” but Mac was not invited to meetings, leading him on several occasions to complain to Reid and John Mahon, Secretary of the London District Committee (National Archives, KV 2/3967, Malcolm Hulke to Betty Reid, 1st December 1952. Malcolm Hulke to John Mahon, 18th May 1954)\n\nIn 1954 Mac was listed in Unity’s annual report as the production manager. In 1961, to mark the 25th anniversary of the company, he devised, edited and produced a booklet entitled HERE IS DRAMA– behind the scenes at Unity Theatre. The foreword was by Benn W Levy (a playwright and the former Labour MP for Eton and Slough), while the illustrations were by Ken Sprague, who contributed to the Daily Worker and many other progressive organisations and causes.\n\nIn his introduction Mac wrote that the booklet was designed with three purposes in mind:\n\nFirst, as a booklet to help new active-members speed up their integration into the life of Unity Theatre. Second, to answer the already active-member who, after working 18 months backstage, asked if anyone knew what a Production Organiser did. Third, to take at least some of Unity’s faithful audience and outside supporters behind the scenes.\n\nHERE IS DRAMA is a very incomplete booklet. Ask any Unity Theatre active-member and he will you that his particular job is not described correctly; and the vehemence of his condemnation will be the measure of his interest in and enthusiasm for his chosen spare-time profession. It is, however, only an outline of the jobs to be done by people in a people’s theatre; it is not an encyclopaedia.\n\nMac finished his introduction by stressing that almost all jobs at Unity “can be done, and are done, equally well and equally badly by women as well as men.”\n\nAt the end of the booklet he wrote:\n\nUnity is a theatre of ideals. But don’t you be too dreamy-eyed in your approach. Only the very mature, and the lonely, stand the test of time. Some people have even been known to use Unity as a jumping-board for West End theatre work, don’t forgot they may do a lot of good for Unity Theatre in the process. Never store up grievances : take them to the Management Committee. In the final analysis, however, there is only one person who will change and improve unity theatre. You.\n\nMac’s time at Unity would have given him invaluable practical experience in observing how a drama is created, from the first draft of the script to the final curtain on the last night. He would also seen at first hand what worked on stage – and what did not. Finally Mac would have learned how to survive the stresses and strains of drama production (often more drama offstage than onstage…) and coping with the temperaments of one’s colleagues. In 1962 Mac became Secretary of the Unity Theatre Trust as it mounted an appeal for survival.\n\nMac does not seem to have written for Unity himself, which is surprising in view of his later successful career as a writer. Eric Paice, with whom Malcolm worked in the 1950s and 1960s, was also involved with Unity, did write a number of plays for the company.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that Mac and Eric Paice became acquainted through Unity. It’s puzzling therefore to read in an interview they gave to The Stage in 1959 that they claimed to have met when both working at an advertising agency. Did they want to conceal their involvement with Unity?\n\nEric was born on 13th November 1926 in Pevensey. He grew up on a landed estate in Kent where his father was the gardener. He attended Sevenoaks Grammar School until it was evacuated during the Blitz. Aged 14, he was apprenticed to a printer as a machine minder but his indentures were cancelled when he tried to set up a trade union branch. He then served in the Royal Navy from 1943 to 1946. He joined Unity in 1949, and worked on the lighting side of productions. In 1951 he became Unity’s nightwatchman, living in a room in the theatre.\n\nHis first shows were for the company’s mobile unity, Focus On Peace and Focus On Germany. In the summer of 1951 Eric was sent as a British delegate to the Writers World Youth Festival in Berlin, but his group were twice turned back in the American zone in Austria. After a protest campaign in Britain, the group eventually got to Berlin. Like any good writer Eric made use of the experience, turning into a show for Unity which he called Barrier Across Europe. His other plays for Unity were The Rosenbergs (1953), Turn it Up (1953) and World On Edge (1956), which was about the Suez crisis He went on to write many single plays and series episodes for television and the radio. The Rosenbergs was refused a licence by the theatre censor in the person of the Lord Chamberlain who wrote: “ ‘Unity theatres are v. left-wing….One wonders if it is right to use the theatre for this sort of personal propaganda especially in a case which is still, really sub-judice.” (Colin Chambers, The Story of Unity Theatre (1989) , William Ash, obituary of Eric Paice, The Guardian, 12th July 1989)\n\nMac’s television and film work in the 1950s and 1960s\n\nBy 1955 he was working for the National Union of Students as the Hostel Appeal Organiser, trying to raise £30,000. In November of that year the Manchester Guardian published a letter from him\n\nYour report on Mr P L Brooke’s castigation of students at the National Union of Students council meeting at Ormskirk for their apparent “scandalous” apathy towards NUS hostel appeal has given the appeal unexpected but not unwelcome publicity. But how welcome the reporter would have been at the ensuing hostel appeal meeting when more than sixty invited delegates stayed up until the small hours to discuss the appeal and to report on their plans for raising funds…(Manchester Guardian, 16th November 1955).\n\nMac resumed his efforts to become a writer:\n\nWhen I was about thirty, and by then working for a social service organisation – and, once again, mainly involved in figure work – I picked up a discarded book on the seat of London bus. It was called “Trading in Bodies”, and its lurid front cover depicted a man wielding a whip at a cluster of half naked young women. It was about the most badly written, appallingly printed book I had ever seen. But it was published in London, and I reckoned that if anyone could sell a story as bad as that – characters no longer needed in the plot just disappeared and weren’t referred to again – then surely I could break into that market. I phoned the publisher , asked their requirements. they told me : “Thirty-eight thousand words, no more, no less. American city setting; and no smut – when the man goes the bedroom with a woman, the next scene’s next day, see?”The outright fee, for all rights, into perpetuity would be the colossal sum of eighteen pounds. (Malcolm Hulke,“I Never Went To School,” BBC radio broadcast, 1st August 1963)\n\nMac brought his book-keeping skills to bear on his embryonic career as a pulp fiction writer:\n\nI calculated how fast I would have to write in order to earn by writing for this amrket at the same hourly rate I was earning by going out to work. It must, I discovered, writing at one thousand words an hour, including plotting, correcting, and the physical job of typing. So I sat at my typewriter for two hours every evening for nineteen evenings , and produced the required thirty-eight thousand words. In due course, and without any nonsense and re-writing a word of this epic, I received my first cheque for professional writing – eighteen pounds. Thus encouraged the next step was to try television… (Malcolm Hulke,“I Never Went To School,” BBC radio broadcast, 1st August 1963)\n\nMac and Eric Paice wanted to break into still relatively new medium of television where there was an increasing demand for drama on the BBC and also , after September 1955, on its rival ITV.\n\nTelevision drama was then in its infancy: plays were still being filmed live with actors hurrying between sets – sometimes getting there just in time for the camera shot! The introduction of videotape in 1958 allowed plays to be pre-recorded and edited for broadcast, much less stress for all concerned.\n\nEric looked back to this era in his book The Way To Write For Television, published in 1981:\n\nUntil the invention and mass availability of the video recorder, a television play or series would appear before a mass audience for a brief hour, then vanish like the morning dew. And the television companies were extraordinarily profligate with material that seemed to them to be in unending supply. Most of the plays produced in the late fifties and early sixties were wiped so that the tapes on which they were recorded could be used again. To find any trace of them today you must rummage in the attics of writers with storage space to keep their old scripts. It was instant drama, with no shelf life. (Eric Paice, The Way To Write For Television, (1981), p.1)\n\nIn an interview in 1975 in Tardis (the magazine of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society) Mac told Gordon Blows that he and Eric broke into television “simply by getting together evenings and weekends and writing a complete play. We submitted it to the BBC and they bought it. After that we switched channels and did a number of plays for Armchair Theatre produced in those days by ABC television. The plays market is not a closed shop at all, then or now.” (Gordon Blows, “The Malcolm Hulke Interview”, Tardis, 2, 1975)\n\n“This Day in Fear”: 1st July 1958.\n\nTheir first success was “This Day in Fear,” rejected by ITV but then taken up by the BBC, and broadcast on 1st July 1958 in the series Television Playwright. The play was produced by George Foa, and the cast included Billie Whitelaw and Patrick MGoohan, who in the 1960s played the lead role in the very popular series Danger Man (for which Mac wrote one episode) and then created and starred in the cult TV classic The Prisoner (1967).\n\nIt seems that the play may have gone out live. In his book Writing For Television Mac recalled that that: “a scene between Billie Whitelaw and Patrick McGoohan included the surprise appearance of one of the “extras” (small part actors) who wandered across the space between the window of the supposed first floor bedroom and the “drop” (canvas curtain with picture of houses across the street), startling viewers with his seeming levitation act. ” (Writing For Television (1974), p. 14)\n\nThe main character is a former IRA member who, having turned his back on the movement, is on the run after betraying a comrade and who seeks safety with the police.\n\nThe Times described it as “the most arresting yet” in the series. “The development is most graceful: irony discloses in advance that the courteous and solicitious ‘police’ are in fact the killers but there is no preparation for the bombshell that the protagonist himself is the Republican hero whose death was to be avenged…the revelation of identity kaleidoscopically shakes the disconnected ends of the plot into order.” (The Times, 2nd July 1958)\n\nThe Belfast Telegraph reviewer thought that it was “…well acted by a largely Irish cast, the end packed, even for Ulster viewers, two surprises.” (Belfast Telegraph, 2nd July 1958)\n\nHarold Darton in The Stage was also impressed :\n\nMalcolm A Hulke and Eric Paice…took their first step into TV writing with this play, and a most successful debut it was. The setting was that of an almost conventional thriller plot – a man is about to be murdered, and he is given forewarning of his fate so that he can sweat it out suitably (and so that the playwrights can have an excuse to build up the suspense).\n\nWhat lifted “This Day in Fear” out of the rut was the extras that go to make a play out of the thriller permutations. The extras here were an IRA background, twists and double twists at the end (where the “police” turn out to be the assassins, and where the man destined to be shot turns out to be in fact, the man he is accused of betraying (if you see what I mean), and by clever little touches to the deliberate policy of suspense.\n\nHow would you feel if a threat to murder you appeared in the In Memoriam columns of the news paper, and then you found your papers had been cancelled and the milk order to your household cut by half a pint. “This Day in Fear” may not be a great play, but it was most entertaining and television could do with more like it. Messrs. Hulke and Paice were lucky to have producer George Foa for their first piece. An overall smooth production was helped by some very effective filming. Patrick McGoohan in the main part was most convincing, though he sometimes swallowed his words. But one tends to feel with Patrick McGoohan that one has seen him playing the same part before. Billie Whitelaw as his wife look a step up the social ladder, from her usual parts of a tart or a Cockney, she progressed to an architect’s wife, and she did it with her usual efficiency. Allan McClelland as the would-be assassin was hardly a strong enough character to be a bullying Irishman, and hardly a small enough character to be a sinister ferret-like type. Bad casting, perhaps. (The Stage, 10th July 1958)\n\nThe play was adapted for radio by Cynthia Pughe and broadcast on 7th March 1959. I have not been able to find out a great deal about Cyntia ; she is named as a script reader in the Script Unit at the BBC in the 1950s and was working as Val Gielgud’s Secretary. She also wrote a number of radio plays, often adaptations eg Murder Happens by Arnold Ridley, broadcast 27th June 1951; The Wandering Jew by E Temple Thurston, broadcast on 19th November 1952 and Ladies in Retirement by Edward Percy and Reginald Denham, broadcast on 24th July 1965.\n\nOn 25th August 1961 a version of the play was broadcast on the German television channel ARD 2 under the title Treibjagd (The Hunt) directed by Rüdiger Graf. The cast included Paul Glawion, Eva Berthold. and Hans Zesch-Ballot. The translation was by Marianne de Barde who translated over 50 dramas for German television from 1952 to 1983. Retro-Media-TV.de\n\nSoon Mac felt confident enough to make a bold move:\n\nWithin a year of the first television production I was able to move over to full-time writing and to give up my job – which by then was as manager of an agency selling advertising space. With that job I was earning enough to feed both me and the six thirsty cylinders of my very old car. But I realised that to ever make real living, I had to break out of being employed by other people, who inevitably tend to fix your rate not so much by what you do as by your educational background, and to work in a world where anyone can play – no matter where they come from or whatever their education has been. The entertainment business is only interested in results, and as a consquence has its own peculiarly tolerant democracy.\n\nSo I had to become professional writer because I had no real qualifications to be anything else. During those long days of my school-less years, cut off from other children because they were at school and I was at home, I played endless games of the imagination on my own. In a sense, as I sit down at home each morning at my typewriter, I’m still doing just that.\n\n(Malcolm Hulke,“I Never Went To School,” BBC radio broadcast, 1st August 1963)\n\nPolitical Vetting at the BBC\n\nGiven Mac’s Communist party background and both Mac’s and Eric involvement with Unity Theatre it is surprising that they were allowed to work for the BBC which vetted its staff and writers for their politics. The history of vetting at the BBC was examined in detail by Paul Reynolds in 2018 in an article on the BBC’s own website. Despite its denials over many decades, political vetting began in 1935 and continued until the 1990s, carried out in liaison with M15.\n\nVetting was brought into play once a candidate and one or two alternatives labelled “also suitable” had been selected for a job. The alternatives served a useful purpose. If the first choice was barred by vetting, the appointments board moved easily on to the second. The candidates were told only that “formalities” would be carried out before an appointment was made. This sounded harmless enough; it would allow time to follow up references, perhaps. Candidates did not know that “formalities” meant vetting – and was, in fact, the code word for the whole system.\n\nA memo from 1984 gives a run-down of organisations on the banned list. On the left, there were the Communist Party of Great Britain, the Socialist Workers Party, the Workers Revolutionary Party and the Militant Tendency. By this stage there were also concerns about movements on the right – the National Front and the British National Party.\n\nA banned applicant did not need to be a member of these organisations – association was enough….\n\nIf MI5 found something against a candidate, it made one of three “assessments” in a kind of league table:\n\nCategory “A” stated: “The Security Service advises that the candidate should not be employed in a post offering direct opportunity to influence broadcast material for a subversive purpose.”\n\nCategory “B” was less restrictive. The Security Service “advised” against employment “unless it is decided that other considerations are overriding”.\n\nCategory “C” stated that the information against a candidate should not “necessarily debar” them but the BBC “may prefer to make other arrangements” if the post offered “exceptional opportunity” for subversive activity.\n\nThe BBC procedure was in principle never to employ someone in Category “A”, though a few did get through the net. This contradicted its public position that the BBC controlled all appointments. In theory it did. In practice it gave that choice to MI5 in Category “A” cases.\n\nIf staff came under suspicion only after they had been employed by the BBC or applied for transfer to a job that needed vetting, an image resembling a Christmas tree was drawn on their personal file.\n\nPaul Reynolds, The vetting files: how the BBC kept out “subversives”. BBC website, 22nd April 2018.\n\nFor whatever reason Mac and Eric must have passed the vetting.\n\nArmchair Theatre\n\nMac and Eric wrote four plays for Armchair Theatre, a series launched in July 1956 by Howard Thomas, head of ABC, which had the franchise for weekend television in the Midlands and in the North unril 1974.\n\nThomas said that “television drama is not so far removed from television journalism, and the plays which will grip the audience are those that face up to the new issues of the day, as well as to the problems as old as civilisation.” For the first three years the plays were staged in ABC’s northern studios in Didsbury, Manchester, housed in the former Capitol cinema. (Sadly the building was demolished in 1999).\n\nSydney Newman was approached by ABC to become the producer of Armchair Theatre and worked on the series between 1958 and 1962, often seen as its golden period. Newman came to England from Canada where he had made hundreds of documentaries and been head of drama at the Canadian Broadcasting Company. He had pioneered a new approach, commissioning drama which reflected social issues.\n\nNewman produced 152 episodes of Armchair Theatre, which were shown on Sunday evenings. Many writers, later to find fame, cut their teeth on the series. Newman said of England: “At the time, I found this country to be somewhat class-ridden….The only legitimate theatre was of the ‘anyone for tennis’ variety, which, on the whole, presented a condescending view of working-class people. Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays, and invariably about upper classes. I said ‘Damn the upper-classes -they don’t even own televisions!’ My approach was to cater for the people who were buying low cost things like soap every day. The ordinary blokes the advertisers were aiming at.” The viewings figures for the plays often reached 12 million.\n\nMalcolm and Eric’s plays for Armchair Theatre were as follows:\n\nThe Criminals: 28th December 1958.\n\nThis was directed by James Ferman and starred Stanley Baker, Raymond Huntley, and Allan Cuthbertson. The plot centres on an escaped convict hiding in a Piccadilly office who plans to break into the strong-room of the adjoining bank and who forces four businessmen to assist him in the raid.\n\nThe reviewer in The Times was taken with the play:\n\nThe irony compressed into the title…is prepared so cunningly that not until the end of the performance of the thriller last night on Independent Teleision were all its layers of meaning exhausted. The play is based on the idea that a criminal lurks inside every honest man, but the authors’ means of turning this familar idea into action is anything but derivative. For the purpose of the plot honesty is made to equal hypocrisy and cowardice and the only possible hero is a self-confessed criminal….The criminal from the outset is the only sympathetic character but by degrees he acquires a total moral ascendancy as the other figures reveal their shiftiness, self-interest, and readiness to take a share of the pickings if no danger is involved. The ironic climax comes with the accidental death of the convict leaving his four inadvertent accomplices with a murder on their hands and a room full of banknotes. By this time the atmosphere has taken on a biting moral invective: and in Mr James Ferman’s concentrated production the performances of Mr Raymond Huntley and Mr Stanley Baker ensured that none of it was lost. (The Times, 29th December 1958)\n\nHowever the Birmingham Daily Post was less enthused, describing it as “… a contrived crime thriller with a topical touch. The safe-blowing episode was incredible, but the characters were drawn in some detail. Stanley Baker played the principal criminal with great force.” (Birmingham Daily Post, 29th December 1958.)\n\nMargaret Cowan in The Stage was not overly impressed either:\n\nThe theme of the play seems to be that cupidity will get the better of all of us, given the right circumstances. Four businessmen on New Year’s Eve are about to leave for Germany, At the office, they are having a last drink. Waiting for them is an escaped convict (Stanley Baker). He is forceful, intelligent, and has worked out a daring robbery which he plans with the enforced help of the four executives, who are construction engineers. Their offices adjoin a bank.\n\nHe tricks them into believing that their wives are in danger. All night they help him tunnel a passage, and fail to take their opportunities to overpower him. In the end he is trapped and killed by fallen masonry, but not before the others have shown that they are interested in taking large sums of money, provided they are not found out.\n\nThe whole thing is incredible. The action, motivation and execution of the plot are all artificial. It fails to convince and fails to move. Stanley Baker gave a strong performance as a forceful leader, and the others did their best with their parts. But they fought a losing battle with an unconvincing script. It was directed as well as possible by James Ferman with good settings. (The Stage, 1st January 1959)\n\nSwedish television broadcast a version of “The Criminals” on 1st November 1961 under the title Medbrottslingarna (Accomplices) It was directed by Yngve Nordwall and starred Bengt Brunsko, Olof Bergström and Ake Engfledt. The translation was by Marianne Höök.\n\n“The Big Client”: 17th May 1959.\n\nThis was a satire set in the advertising industry, directed by Ted Kotcheff, and starring Ian Bannen. (Both Eric and Mac had worked in advertising).\n\nThe Times TV critic was not so taken with this as he had been with their previous play.\n\nLast night…we were introduced to the bedlam competitions of the advertising agency, and incidentally to the brand of the ruthlessness that drives ambitious young men of to-day towards an even more unscrupulous future. Fred Cooper is a manager in a small and unambitious agency, intent on finding room at the top, and the play follows his curiously heartless and dishonest moves to secure an important American client, and to get the personal position with him that belongs by right to his directors. In the big client and ambitious youngster like meets like. and Fred secures his future with a final compact of degradation in which the boy’s own fiancée is sacrificed to the new and infuential boss.\n\nUnfortunately the authors, after creating potentially an interesting study of egoism, drive and inferiority complex, lay on the unscrupulousness too thickly for credibility and not all Mr Ian Bannen’s vitaility and brash yet uncertain charm could save the play from disintegration and a slick artificiality. (The Times, 18th May 1959).\n\n“Telecrit” in the Liverpool Daily Post was more favourable :\n\nJust when I was beginning to tire of ABC’s Sunday night talent scouting for budding TV dramatists along came Malcolm A. Hulke and Eric Paice last night with a work that made many of its “Armchair Theatre” contemporaries appear as amateurish as Monty playing diplomats. The drama: “The Big Client” a story of a ruthless young rogue grasping his opportunities with both hands—and cheating his pals in the process.\n\nWith a plot twisting as skilfully as the twister it portrayed, “The Big Client” was sixty solid minutes’ tightly-compressed entertainment.\n\nThe authors didn’t waste a second spinning their yarn – they couldn’t afford to. In the telling of this tortuous tale. each line had to count. And it did.\n\nThey gave us nothing profound. That wasn’t their target. Instead, they served-up fast-moving drama with assured technique.\n\nLike a galvanic minnow, darting among the big fish, lan Bannen gave the opportunist just the right blend of boyish charm and dangerous deceit. As the play closed with its last. effective twist, one saw he’d cheerfully murder his mother for a choc ice.\n\nBut for all Bannen’s magnetic performance. the real stars of the show were Messrs. Hulke and Paice—who also wrote “The Criminals” that recent ITV drama of bank robbery with a difference, starring Stanley Baker. Here on last night’s evidence is a combination to watch with the keenest interest. (Liverpool Daily Post, 18th May 1959.\n\nAccording to The Stage the advertising trade press was full of letters protesting about the unscrupulous “hero” of the play Fred Cooper. “It is not a malicious atack on advertising,” Mac responded, “It is about a boy called Fred Cooper. That he should gravitate to the world of advertising is just the way it most likely would be. But there are Fred Coopers in every line of business.” (The Stage, 12th August 1961)\n\nThis play was later turned into a musical with music and lyrics written by Michael Pratt which premiered at the Bristol Old Vic in November 1961. The cast included Harry H Corbett and Elizabeth Shepherd.\n\nPeter Ford reviewed the show for The Guardian:\n\nMike Pratt….has caught the brittle spirit of the piece in his music and lyrics. What then caused the Big Client to lose its edge in the theatre? The answer may lie partly in the script and the fact that its climactic development is affected by bittiness of scene, in spite of the ingenious job done by the designer, Daphne Hare. But the burden lies more with the company. Val May’s cast…enact the play sharply but with or two exceptions…they neither the voice nor the drive for singing music of this genre. It is thus left to the professional dancers to set the pace. (The Guardian, 30th November 1961)\n\nThe reviewer for The Stage said that the show “ought be as good a formula as most, for entertainment of this kind, but at the first showing the impact was less than one would have expected. The characters conform to type, and some of the laugh-lines generated by Malcolm Hulke and Eric Paice are good quality, but there are not enough of them. The lyrics of Mike Pratt’s vocal number appear stronger than the music but judgement on this is complicated by the lack of vocal accomplishment among the players – at any rate for this kind of jazz-cum-blues music. If there is a hit tune in the score it is not given a chance to emerge in Val May’s production… (The Stage, 30th November 1961)\n\nMac discussed a scene from the play in chapter 6 of Writing for Television which is on dialogue.\n\nMost directors and actors prefer the cut and thrust of an exchange of short, sharp sentences between characters . In some series drama, you may even find a rule that no speech shall exceed four lines of typing. But there is a case for the occasional very long speech. Here is a long speech from the play The Big Client by Eric Paice and myself…The speaker, an American pharmaceutical tycoon called J G Henderson, had already been established in the play by way of third -person reference. By the time we arrived at the big speech, the audience was eager to hear everything Henderson had to say about himself. The scene took place in a London hotel suite where Henderson had summoned representatives from most of London’s biggest advertising agencies. Having handed round the drinks, to show his hail-fellow-well-met face, Henderson mounted a rostrum, put on his sincerity face and talked.\n\nHENDERSON\n\nGentlemen, as you know, I have to return to New York tonight. That means I have to decide on my advertising agency within the next few hours.\n\nHE PAUSES AND MAKES AN ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SIGNAL. GRETA HEFFNER, HIS PRIVATE SECRETARY, COMES OVER TO HIM WITH A SILVER TRAY ON WHICH IS A DISPLAY. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAY IS A PACKET MARKED “ZYGOTEN”. HENDERSON PICKS UP THE PACKET, SHAKES OUT A PILL, AND HOLDS IT BETWEEN HIS THUMB AND INDEX FINGER, AND CONTINUES.\n\nHENDERSON\n\nThis item is worth half a million pounds to one of you gentleman or ladies here. I want you to prepare for me an idea – no details – you haven’t got time for that; an idea for advertising this product. You know your public, and that’s why I want a British advertising agency to handle this. I want your ideas by four o’clock this afternoon. Are there any questions?\n\nTHERE IS ABSOLUTE SILENCE.\n\nHENDERSON (CONTINUING)\n\nWell, gentleman, may I presume the question you’d all like to ask me? Why did I quit my previous agency so suddenly? I’ll tell you because there’s a lesson we can all learn from this. I spent a whole month with this agency, actually sitting in with them from eight o’clock every morning working out the copy platform . But last night we had a party. One of the Executives got drunk. He started calling me a lot of bad names. That I didn’t mind at all because I am used to taking hard knocks. But then he said something about what I might do with this product.\n\nHE HOLDS UP THE SMALL PILL BETWEEN THUMB AND INDEX FINGER AND LOOKS AT THE ADVERTISING PEOPLE BEFORE HIM\n\nHENDERSON (CONTINUING)\n\nI don’t have to tell you what he said.\n\nHE LOOKS AT THE PILL AGAIN, THEN CAREFULLY, ALMOST REVERENTLY, REPLACES IT IN THE PACKET.\n\nHENDERSON (CONTINUING)\n\nAs successful men and women I think you will agree with me that if you are selling a product you must have confidence in that product. Because if you don’t believe in it yourself, how can you expect millions of ordinary people to believe in it? (SUDDENLY TURNING TO FRY) Don’t you agree with that, Mr Fry?\n\nTHE YOUNG ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE , FRY, IS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIMSELF PICKED OUT AND SPOKEN DIRECTLY BY NAME.\n\nFRY\n\nOh, good gracious, yes, definitely. Obviously one must believe in one’s product.\n\nHENDERSON\n\nDeeper than that, Mr Fry. You see, belief is a neccessity for living. It’s like food, it’s like friends. The problem with our society is that there’s a belief vacuum. And we have to fill it. (THEN WITH A TWISTED SMILE) You know, only the other day I was toying with the idea of setting up belief clinics all over the United States for those deprived faithwise.\n\nThis was an extraordinarily long speech for a one hour television play, but there was some justifications for it. First, it was entertaining. In Henderson we had a larger-than-life character, and everything he said and did was entertaining. Second, the speech was full of suspense. Between Henderson and his trapped audience of advertisng people there existed a tension relationship. The slightest wrong move by any of them, and they knew they would never get that golden account. Third, and most important, this scene and Henderson’s explanation had been prepared for. All the earlier scenes of the play had been about Henderson, about his advertising account, above all about his pill. (Incidentally, the construction of The Big Client contravened a rule favoured by many script editors and producers, which is that it is generally inavdvisable to have characters talk about a third character who has not yet been seen, albeit fleetingly, on the screen. The belief is that audiences never really listen to names mentioned unless they have met the people concerned, although they may absorb descriptions of characters not-yet-seen, eg “father”, “the boss”, “my son”. In The Big Client we were able to disregard that rule, because in those earlier scenes people only talked about Henderson; so, by the time he finally appeared, it was like the Second Coming, and the audience felt they were seeing someone whom they already knew very well). Writing for Television, (1974) pp. 53-54.\n\nA production of “The Big Client” was broadcast on 19th July 1961 by the Australian Broadcasting Company, directed by James Ushaw. The cast included James Condon, Barry Linehan and Alisair Duncan.\n\nAnother production under the title Das große Geschäft was broadcast on 22nd September 1966 on Austrian television by Österreichischer Rundfunk, directed by Walter Davy. The cast included Alfred Reiterer, Tatjana Schneider and Walter Kohut.\n\n“The Great Bullion Robbery”: 25th December 1960.\n\nThis was directed by John Llewellyn Moxey and starred Donald Wolfit, Colin Blakely, James Booth and Douglas Wilmer. The play was based on the first notable British train robbery, which took place in 1856 on a train from London to Folkestone.\n\nThe script was adapted by Eric and Mac from an original script by retired judge Gerald Sparrow. They told David Griffiths in Playbill that they had read the transcripts of the Old Bailey trial: “our adaptation uses the names of the people involved. The method of the robbery is the same as the true case but in unfolding the plot we have taken a certain amount of theatrical licence.”\n\nThe Times reviewer described Mac and Eric as “that accomplished and productive writing team”. He continued: “The television script…drew on a transcipt of the original Old Bailey trial, and though a fictional drama had been woven around the bald facts, the result, aided by a taut production by Mr John Moxey and some stylish mid-Victorian sets by Mr James Goddard. The mechanics of the robbery itself, were, as they usually are, fascinating, with clashes of temperament and crises of nerves as unforeseen complications were unravelled, but the suspense was cleverly kept up until the case against the successful perpetrators began to piece itself together and Sir Donald Wolfit as the shifty lawyer Saward found himself fighting what was to prove, in more ways than one, the most important case of his career. ... ” (The Times, 28th December 1960)\n\n“The Girl in the Market Square”: 20th March 1961.\n\nThis play was directed by John Llewellyn Moxey and starred Susan Denny, Rupert Davies and Michael Collins.\n\nThe girl of the title is found dead as a result of a car hit and run accident. However, both the town and the driver regard his importance as ranking above the girl’s to warrant any further attention from the police.\n\nIt was later broadcast as a radio play, part of a series of plays broadcast by the BBC in 1961 in conjunction with the Writers’ Guild. Apart from Mac and Eric, the other playwrights in the series included Bryan Forbes, Howard Clewes, Ted Willis, Alun Owen and Gale Pedrick.\n\nAccording to Mac, the Independent Television Authority told ABC that it couldn’t go on because the story included a corrupt police inspector. “The company paid us an additional £100 to turn him into the hero.” Malcolm Hulke, Writing for Television (1974), p. 139)\n\nLife In Danger: 1959\n\nEric and Mac wrote the script for Life in Danger, a film directed by Terry Bishop, and produced by Butchers’ Film Service, who released many low budget films in this period. The cast included Derren Nesbitt, Julie Hopkins and Christopher Witty.\n\nIt begins with a child murderer escaping from a Parkways Institute. In the nearby village the inhabitants are fearful, particularly when an unknown man appears in the village and takes refuge in a barn with two teenagers. Led by a retired major the villagers are ready to take matters into their own hands…\n\nIn tone, atmosphere and plot twist Life in Danger is very smilar to the work that Eric and Mac were doing for Armchair Theatre at this time.\n\nYou can watch a short extract from the film here\n\nGert and Daisy: August and September 1959\n\nMac and Eric wrote three episodes for this ITV comedy series, created by Ted Willis and produced by Jack Hylton, which starred Elsie and Doris Waters.\n\nThey were very well known as a comedy duo on the radio in Workers Playtime (1941-1964 and Flogitts (1956-1957) and had also made a number of films during the war: Gert and Daisy’s Weekend (1942), Gert and Daisy Clean Up (1942) and It’s in the Bag (1944). (Incidentally their brother was Jack Warner).\n\nElsie and Doris played Gert and Daisy, two sisters who used to work in show business who now run a boarding house for theatrical visitors. Other cast members included Hugh Paddick and Patsy Rowlands. The series was poorly received and only ran for six episodes.\n\nYou can read more about Elsie and Doris and the contribution they made to comedy here.\n\nTell it to the Marines: September 1959\n\nEric and Mac wrote the first episode for this comedy series, also created by Ted Willis, which starred Jack Allen, Ian Colin, and Ronald Himes. It was an attempt by Jack Hylton to emulate the success of Granada’s The Army Game.\n\nThe series is based on the rivalry at both officer and lower ranks level between the Royal Navy and the Royal Marines when the latter are billeted with the former. It ran for two series and was directed by Milo Lewis.\n\nNo Hiding Place: October 1959.\n\nNo Hiding Place was a police series – made by Associated Redifussion – which ran from 1959 to 1967. .It was the sequel to the series Murder Bag (1957–1958) and Crime Sheet (1959), both of which starring Raymond Francis as Detective Superintendent Tom Lockhart at Scotland Yard. Eric Lander played Detective Sergeant Harry Baxter.\n\nScreeonline says that it was “the first detective series produced for the commercial network that was ‘live’ and totally British in flavour.” The format proved very popular and regualarly attarcted seven million viewers. No Hiding Place, Screenonline)\n\nMac and Eric wrote an episode in the first series called “The Stalag Story” (in which Patrick Troughton, later the Second Doctor, had a part as “Blakey”).\n\nMac wrote a further two episodes on his own: “A Menace to the Public,” broadcast on 15th February 1965, and “A Moment of Freedom,” broadcast on 1st December 1965.\n\nMac and Eric Spotlight on Scripts.\n\nThe duo were interviewed by The Stage in August 1959 for their regular feature “Spotlight on Scripts”.\n\nComedy scripts, more often than not, are a matter of team work; the reverse is true in the field of drama. And it is rarer still to find such collaboration among tv dramatic writers. One that has proved eminently successful is the team of Malcolm A Hulke and Eric Paice. From their beginning their efforts had immediate success; “This Day in Fear”, “The Criminals”, “Life in Danger” and “The Big Client” are a few of their hour-length (or more) plays which have been repeated on the radio and tv in America, Australia and the Continent. From this they wrote several half-hour scripts for tv film series, did scripts for feature films, and are now also scripting shows for live tv serials, this time for comedy.\n\nThese two writers have more work than they cope with, and, as will be seen, this has had some reaction on the scripting formulae.\n\nOverwhelmingly success brings its own problems, but the remarkable fact remains that their success was immediate and continuous. To what was this succsess due?\n\n“We approach the matter in a coldly scientific manner”, they said. “We analysed good tv scripts and then evolved a method of work that would make them as foolproof as possible.”\n\n“Certain points emerged as axiomatic. Static drama does not come across on tv, it must be fast-moving.”\n\n“We are primarily storytellers and go into the background of every character thoroughly, even though we may not use this. That way we are both familar with the character.”\n\n“We work out everything live on the tape, imitating the voices we want, editing and rejecting as we go along.”\n\n“It is important to be completely detached – not to get ourselves involved with the characters. And it is important to work to a deadline – and keep to it.”\n\nWorking together, suggesting and rejecting, and putting everything immediately on tape, these two writers attain speed, mutual generation of ideas, accuracy of facts and attitudes, and dialogue which is functional and economic.\n\nThe interesting thing about this partnership is that, with the constant increase in work, they have lately found that they do not always have the time to work together. Now they meet once a week to discuss their scripts instead of working in the same room every day. With their newest contract with ABC-TV (three plays a year for three years) the new pattern of collaboration emerges – they will, under the contract, do two plays a year together and one play will be written by either partner.\n\nDoes this mean that a close collaboration between two writers cannot continue with excess of work? Anytime now Messrs. Hulke and Paice may be able to supply us with the answer. The Stage, 12th August 1959.\n\nMac and Eric were represented by Harvey Unna, a refugee from Nazi Germany. Harvey worked for the BBC on German broadcasts during the war, acted as a translator for Hartley Shawcross at the Nuremburg war crimes trials, and then created one of Britain’s most successful literary agencies.\n\nTarget Luna and the Pathfinders series: 1960 and 1961\n\nIn 1960 Sydney Newman commissioned Mac and Eric to write six episodes for a children’s science fiction serial for ABC, Target Luna, which was broadcast in April and May of that year, directed by Adrian Brown.\n\nNewman’s aim for the programme was to educate young people about science. The series centres on Professor Wedgewood, head of an experimental rocket centre which launches missions into space from Buchan Island, a remote Scottish isle. His children, Geoffrey, Valerie and Little Jimmy, have come to spend the holidays with him. However Little Jimmy is accidentally launched into space: the rest of the series shows how he is rescued after facing numerous perils in his trip around the moon and back to earth. It was filmed in the ABC studios in Birmingham. (Geoffrey was played by Michael Craze who in 1966 joined the cast of Doctor Who in the serial “The War Machines” playing Ben Jackson, a sailor).\n\nMac was very keen to show a situation in which the different nations of the world unite. “We soon see how the plight of one human being in an Earth-bound rocket catches the imagination of the whole world. Radar stations – Russian, American, British and others – are linked in a global effort to bring the rocket home. Space travel, it turns out, is a great unifying influence among the nations. The old law of the sea becomes the law of space too.” (Andrew Pixley, Pathfinders On Television)\n\nIn his post on Pathfinders in Space Andrew Pixley suggest that the series “bore a strong resemblance in early stages to André Norton’s THE LOST PLANET, televised by the BBC six years earlier. In the 1954 production, Jeremy Grant, a sixteen year old, comes to stay with his uncle Doctor Lachlan McKinnon at a remote house in Scotland. Here, McKinnon was about to launch a rocket to the planet Hesikos, with Jeremy and young, pretty Janet Campbell, a university student, firmly involved in the journey, during which they faced the standard dangers of any 50s ‘B’ movies: meteorites and the like. (Andrew Pixley, Pathfinders On Television)\n\nTarget Luna was a success with the public and Newman commissioned three sequels: Pathfinders in Space (seven episodes), Pathfinders to Mars (six episodes) and Pathfinders to Venus (eight episodes), which aired between September 1960 and April1961, directed by Guy Verney.\n\nThe cast was completely revamped with new actors playing both the main roles and the children, while there was greater emphasis on science in these sequels. “This is a more ambitious story,” announced Eric, with Mac adding, “We’re steeped in scienography.”\n\nIn these new adventures the adults, the children and Hamlet the Hamster travel to the Moon, Mars and Venus, encountering amongst other perils lost civilisations, an alien spaceship, sandstorms, dinosaurs and Venusians. In many ways the series, with its pedagogic intention and imaginative science fiction story lines, was a predecessor to Doctor Who. Unusually for this period the cast included a woman scientist, the selonographist Professor Mary Meadows, played by Pamela Barney, who is used to convey science lessons to the watching children.\n\nReviewing Pathfinders to Mars in The Stage Dena Hamlin said that the first episode: “rocketed off with a good start but soon fizzled out. In the opening minutes a fuel tank explodes, Professor Wedgwood (Peter Williams) is injured and we see science reporter Conway Henderson (Gerald Flood) take over as leader of this latest expedition from Buchan Island into space.\n\nBut, after this, and until shortly before the end of this episode, came a dreary introduction which lacked action, speed and excitement. I even felt that George Colouris, playing a mystery man who tricks his way into the expedition by misleading the Canadian professor (Bernard Horsfall), was not really sinister enough to excite the audience.\n\nHester Cameron, a 13 year-old making her TV debut as Henderson’s niece Margaret, was slightly precocious and did not seem suitable awed at the pospect of her journey into space. Stewart Guidotti, again appearing as Prof Wedgewood’s son, managed to smuggle Hamlet – the guineapig who is already a seasoned luna explorer – aboard.\n\nThe last few minutes after take-off saved the episode from collapse as the mystery man radioed a “first part of the plan completed” message to his unseen accomplices. Perhaps the next five instalments will come up to the exciting standard of previous Pathfunder serials. (The Stage, 15th December 1960)\n\nMac told The Stage that Pathfinders to Venus” ...follows on from the Mars adventure. The crew are on their way back to earth when they get a radio message to rescue an American who is orbiting around Venus. Needless to say, once he is picked up the Pathfinders find an opportunity to land on Venus and have a look around. No one actually knows what Venus looks like because it is covered by a white gas cloud. So we can use our imagination.” The Stage, 16th February 1961)\n\nPerhaps Eric and Mac had taken criticism of Pathfinders to Mars to heart, for the anonymous reviewer in The Stage was considerably more enthusiatic about the first episode of the final serial. “ Unlike most serials, where the first episodes are devoted to introducing the characters and explaining the plot, this went straight into orbit. Hester Cameron and Stewart Guidotti as the two teenagers aboard the British ship gave good performances and reintroduced the hamster who is perhaps the most seasoned of the space travellers. Altogether, I am sure, children will be looking forward to future episodes.” (The Stage, 9th March 1961)\n\nBefore they wrote Pathfinders to Mars Eric and Mac sent out a three page questionaire to selected schools in London, Newcastle and Northern Ireland. The idea was to get schoolchildren to answer questions on the credibility of the recent series, to grade the personality appeal of the characters, and assess the entertainment value of the show. (The Stage, 10th November 1960)\n\nGhost Squad: 1961-1964\n\nGhost Squad was produced by ITC and ran for three series 1961-1964. It follows the cases investigated by a Special Division of Scotland Yard which fall outside of normal police work. The series was based on a book of the same name written by John Gosling, a retired police officer and former member of the squad. The regular cast included Michael Quinn with Donald Wolfit playing his boss.\n\nMac is listed on the IMDB as writing for the series, but his episodes are not identified.\n\nThe Man in the Back Seat: 1961\n\nThis was Eric and Mac’s second film script.\n\nThe Man in the Back Seat was produced by Lesley Parkyn and Julian Wintle (Independent Artists) and directed by Vernon Sewell. The cast included Derren Nesbitt, Keith Faulkner, Harry Locke and Carol White.\n\nTwo small-time crooks attempt to rob a greyhound track bookie, only to find that the money is in a bag securely chained to his wrist. Piling the unconscious victim into the back seat of his own vehicle, the pair take off in panic determined to first free the bookie from his money and then free themselves of him altogether. But their attempts fail and their desperation increases as the night wears on…\n\nThe Avengers: 1962-1969\n\nMalcolm’s connection with Sydney Newman continued when he wrote nine episodes for the cult TV series The Avengers, which Newman created for ABC in 1961.\n\nWhilst Newman’s Armchair Theatre drama series had been successful Howard Thomas, head of ABC, recalled that: “As the percentage increased of gloomy and realistic plays I suggested to Newman that our drama schedules needed something more lighthearted and sophisticated. I reminded him of the days when MGM produced spakling comedies for their contract stars like Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy, Norma Shearer, elegantly dressed and in fashionable settings.\n\nWhy couldn’t we make a series based on the Thin Man, with characters like those made famous by William Powell and Myrna Loy? This suggestion appealed to the ever-perceptive Newman and he came back with a proposal. (Howard Thomas, “The birth of The Avengers”, The Times, 2nd April 1977)\n\nIt was originally a vehicle for Ian Hendry, following from his appearance as Dr Geoffrey Brent in the series Police Surgeon which lasted for just one series in the autumn of 1960. The Avengers takes its title from the first episode, “Hot Snow”, in which Dr David Keel (Ian Hendry) investigates the murder of his fiancée Peggy (Catherine Woodville), shot in the street by a drug ring.\n\nHe is assisted by a shadowy stranger named John Steed (Patrick Macnee) who was also investigating the ring, and together they avenge her death. They then form a partnership to investigate crimes and mysteries.\n\nHendry left after the first series. Patrick Macnee then became the lead character, while his female partners in the investigations were in order: Venus Smith (1962-1963) played by Julie Stevens), Cathy Gale (1962-1964) played by Honor Blackman, Emma Peel (1965-1967) played by Diana Rigg, and Tara King (1968-1969) played by Linda Thorson. The series evolved over the decade from a black and white gritty crime and mystery thriller to a stylish fantasy series, filmed in colour, which combined English eccentricity with elements of “Swinging London” carefully crafted to appeal to the American market.\n\nOf these nine episodes Mac co-wrote four episodes with Terrance Dicks, whom he had got to know when Terrance rented a room in his house and whom Mac asked to work with him on the scripts when he learnt that Terrance, an advertising copywriter, was very keen to write for television. In interviews Terrance has freely acknowledged the influence of Malcolm on his career, describing him as his mentor. In 1968, after a spell on Crossroad, Terrance became assistant script editor on Doctor Who, and about a year later, the chief script editor.\n\nTerrance recalled :“the great thing about Mac, you see, from a technical point of view, was that he was a touch typist. He was always terribly efficient and well organised, a kind of human machine, and when he decided to be a writer the first thing he did was go to a typists’ school and learn shorthand and typing. So the way we would work was that Mac would sit at the typewriter and we’d discuss a line or whatever, agree on it, and “zap”, it would appear on the paper.” (Richard Marson , “The Incredible Malcolm Hulke,” Doctor Who magazine, 91, August 1984)\n\nMalcolm’s episodes for The Avengers were as follows:\n\n“The Mauritius Penny“ (with Terrance Dicks) : 10th November 1962\n\nIt was produced by Leonard White and directed by Richmond Harding. The cast included Alfred Burke, Richard Vernon, and Sylvia Langova.\n\nA man called Goodchild rifles through stamps for sale in a stamp dealers back office and then shoots the owner Peckham dead. The next day Steed tells Cathy they were watching Peckham because an agent was killed in Rome three months ago, bearing an envelope addressed to him. Steed goes to the shop in disguise wearing glasses and makes enquiries, but arouses suspicions. After he leaves Shelley and Goodchild unload a crate of sub-machine guns.\n\nSteed and Cathy meet at a stamp auction at which Goodchild is shot dead. Cathy gets a job at the stamp dealers shop as an assistant. She overhers Brown being given instructions to kill her. He agrees and says he’s received final instructions from Paris: Norway and Denmark will move at the same time they do. Cathy opens a crate and finds Peckham’s body inside. She is surprised by Brown but knocks him out.\n\nSteed impersonates Goodchild at the dentist. He is drugged by Miss Gray and questioned by Shelley but is rescued by a delivery driver who says, “If I were you guv’, I’d change my dentist”.\n\nCathy arrives at the stamp convention with Brown’s invitation and discovers it is in fact a fascist rally: an organisation called New Rule is planning a coup. She is unmasked and taken for questioning. The leader arrives and is revealed to be Lord Matterley (who has been using the codename “The Mauritius Penny”). Steed turns up and rescues Cathy, and together they subdue the fascists brandishing sub-machine guns\n\nYou can find a full summary of the plot on The Avengers website.\n\n“Intercrime” (with Terrance Dicks): 7th January 1963.\n\nI t was produced by John Bryce and directed by Johnathan Alwyn.

Then he is killed. Cathy reads that the army has been mobilised. Steed tells her that Richter has predicted that a white star would re-enter the solar system and was making some final observations. Cathy is sent to the Tor Point Observatory in Cornwall to investigate, staying in a boarding house with the astronomers.\n\nAn astronomer called Rahim is also murdered whilst carrying out observations Steed arrives and together they discover that Richter was wrong and that the scientists were killed as part of an elaborate scheme to make money on the Stock Exchange in the panic over the end of the world.\n\nYou can read a full summary of the plot on The Avengers website.\n\n“The Undertakers”: 5th October 1963\n\nI t was designed by David Marshall and directed by Bill Bain.\n\nThe cast included Howard Goorney, Lally Bowers and Mandy Miller.\n\nUndertakers turn up a flat and the chief pallbearer shoot a man dead.

Steed shows Cathy a list of the ‘inmates’ of Adelphi Park: she exclaims that they’re all millionaires.\n\nCathy gets a job at the home as assistant matron and discovers that the inmates are all impostors. The episode culminates in a gun battle with the ring leaders of the plot in the grounds of the home amist the giant Grecian statues of women. It transpires that the impersonations were a way of avoiding death duties. No-one ever saw the inmates in the home , so they could be kept alive “on the books” for the required time.\n\nYou can read a full summary of the plot on The Avengers website\n\n“The Medicine Men”: 7th November 1963\n\nIt was designed by David Marshall and directed by Kim Mills.\n\nThe cast included Peter Barkworth, Newton Black and Monica Stevenson.\n\nA young woman is smothered in a Turkish bathhouse.

However the three episiodes he produced were considered well below par and Clemens and Fennell were brought back to save the series.\n\nThe story involved a plot to steal the country’s art treasures (including the Crown Jewels) by Intercrime, (who featured in a previous episode written by Mac and Terrance Dicks). The international crime organisation stages a fake national emergency involving a missile attack on the London, resulting in the treasures being placed in a high security vault to which they have the access codes.\n\nParts of the episodes were later recycled into “Homicide and Old Lace”\n\n“Homicide and Old Lace” (with Terrance Dicks): 26th March 1969\n\nIt was directed by John Hough and Vernon Sewell.\n\nThe cast included Patrick Newell, Joyce Carey and Mary Merrall.\n\n“Mother” – the head of the organisation that Steed and Tara work for- spends his birthday with two of his aunts, and entertains them with a tale of “The Great Great Britain Crime” mentioned above.

She’s the secretary, but her knowledge of the art world makes her invaluable. The firm of Souter and Shoesmith refer to themselves as the SIS (Specialists in Security).\n\n“The Protectors is a rather ambitious series characterised by some very good writing and some complex moral problems.” Cult TV Lounge website.\n\nEric and Mac wrote two episodes:\n\n“It Could Happen Here”: 9th May 1964\n\nIt was directed by Bill Bain.\n\n“Souter and Shoesmith are called in by a trade union to investigate phony lotteries which the union feels are exploiting its members. In fact there’s a lot more than that going on, and there may be a connection with the murder of a union branch secretary. Shenanigans in a trade union might suggest something political but is that what is really behind these shady goings-on?

He has just completed a draft for an episode of Gideon’s Way, he is in the process of completing an episode for No Hiding Place (called A Menace To the Public) and will then work on an episode of Danger Man and another for The Avengers. Without pausing to draw breath he will then complete a play for radio called A Boy For Zelda, work on the English version of a successful stage play from Holland, and perhaps turn his radio play Man on the Island into a novel. Having such much time on his hands (!) he is helping to organise the first assembly of the projected International Writers Guild, to be held in London November 19th-21st . “I’m a sort of glorified bedding officer, fixing acccommodation for delegates and so on…” (The Stage, 15th October 1964)\n\nWinifred wrote to one of Mac’s brothers in December 1963: “Mac is well but very busy.

He wasn’t impressed by the BBC’s drama output.\n\nI found it was to be really absolutely asleep. I thought the camerawork was sluggish…There was no real depth. It was all rather stagey. After I’d been there about three weeks, I really was totally dismayed because, other than a handful, there were really very few marvellous people I felt were really good directors. I didn’t like the writers that were being used and I disliked intensely the fact that all scripts were purchased by the Script department run by Donald Wilson, because I found that directors wanted to be involved in the creation of a script . (Andrew Pixley, “Newman at the BBC”, Doctor Who magazine, 466, October 2013)\n\nNewman re-organised the BBC’s drama production teams and launched a number of new drama series. He then looked at the 5.15 Saturday afternoon slot between the end of Grandstand and the start of Juke Box Jury. Traditionally this had been used for reruns, cartoons or adventure series such as Garry Halliday but Newman wanted something different.\n\nAt a number of meetings in the spring of 1963 Newman and his staff evolved the notion of a mysterious Doctor who could travel in time and space. The aim of the series were educational, similar to Pathfinders in Space, with the remit of teaching its young audience in an enjoyable way about space and history. In its first years the serials alternated between a science fiction adventure and an adventure set during a dramatic historical event such as the travels of Marco Polo, the Crusades, and the St Bartholomew’s Eve Massacre of 1572 (a surprising subject for a tea-time children’s serial, although no actual killings were shown). The series was to be called Doctor Who.\n\nNewman brought in as producer a young woman he had worked with at ABC, Verity Lambert, which caused a stir as the BBC was then a very male world. Verity persuaded the veteran actor William Hartnell to take on the role of the Doctor. Hartnell had been working as an actor since the 1930s, but was frustrated by the limited roles he was now being offered, often as an army sergeant in films and on television. Verity had been impressed by his role in a recent British film This Sporting Life (1963), set in the world of Rugby League in which he had played a talent scout.\n\nThe first episode of Doctor Who was broadcast on 23 November 1963. “An Unearthly Child” introduced the Doctor and his grandchild, Susan, whose science and history teachers at Coal Hill school, Ian and Barbara, are puzzled by her advanced knowledge on some matters and total ignorance on others.\n\nThey follow her to junkyard at 76 Totters Lane and burst into what seems to be a police-box, but is in fact, as the Doctor explains to their disbelief, a space and time machine, the Tardis, as Susan has named it: Time and Relative Dimension in Space. He and Susan are travellers who left their unnamed world. At the end of the episode, fearful of being found out, the Doctor sets the machine in motion and the Tardis leaves the earth for an unknown destination. The rest of the first serial takes place in the Stone Age. and is frankly rather drab.\n\nIt was the second serial, set on a dead planet called Skaro and which introduced the Daleks – emotionless mutants in a mechanised travel machine – that caught the imagination of whole generation of young people.\n\n“Britain 408 AD”\n\nMac had been asked to write for the new show and had submitted a storyline in early September for a serial called “Britain 408 AD”, the period when the Romans were about to abandon its colony and pull out its legions. The story editor David Whitaker felt that the story had a lot of colour, but was too complicated with its various opposing factions: Britons, Romans, Celts, Saxons.\n\nIt was hoped that a rewritten version of “Britain 408 AD” might occupy the sixth slot of Season One. Later that month it was decided that the production block did not need another historical story and Mac’s serial was not proceeded with : instead he was asked to work on a serial called “The Hiddden Planet” which he had also submitted. Mac resubmitted “Britain 408 AD” to Whitaker’s successor, Denis Spooner, but Spooner rejected it in April 1965 because the Romans had already featured in his own recently broadcast serial “The Romans” set at the court of the Emperor Nero. (“Lost Stories”: Doctor Who, a brief History of Time Travel website)\n\n“The Hidden Planet”\n\nIn October 1963 , “The Hidden Planet” was pencilled in as the seventh story of Season One. But when Mac delivered his script for episode one in January 1964, the production team didn’t like it and asked him to rewrite it. Mac disagreed with this, arguing that the script followed the storyline they had agreed and that he should therefore be paid extra for any rewrites. The production team rejected his argument , and in March Mac agreed to revise his scripts. By July, Hulke had rewritten the script, but after Carole Ann Ford (who played the Doctor’s granddaughter Susan), had left the show it was felt that too much work would be needed to restructure the serial while it was felt the story lacked monsters, now viewed as essential in the show’s science fiction serials, part of the Dalek effect on Doctor Who.\n\nIn October Mac was advised by David Whitaker that the story was not now going to be used. As in the case of “Britain 408 AD” he resubmitted it to Denis Spooner but this too was rejected by him in April 1965 because it still included Ian and Barbara who were about to leave the series at the end of “The Chase.” (“Lost Stories”: Doctor Who, a brief History of Time Travel website) .\n\nMac later explained that this serial was about:\n\n“… a planet which is the same size as Earth, but on the other side of the sun, and therefore we have never seen it. The Doctor goes to the planet and for obvious reasons the Tardis crew think they are on Earth. But they find things are different: I think they landed in a field and Susan notices a four-leaf clover, and then they see they are all four leaf clovers. And then other mysterious things happen like birds flying backwards or having double wings, and things of that sort. (Richard Marson, “The Incredible Malcolm Hulke,” Doctor Who magazine, 91, August 1984)\n\nThis idea of an identical planet crops up in a later serial “The Tenth Planet,” broadcast in the autumn of 1966, written by Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, in which the planet Mondas appears suddenly in the solar system, a twin of the earth, except that this planet has Cybermen on it who come calling on their new neighbours. It’s not a friendly visit.\n\n“Journey Into Time” : the forgotten Doctor Who radio series, 1966\n\nIn 1966 Mac wrote a script for a radio version of Doctor Who. The story of this forgotten production was told by Richard Bignell in issue 3 of the Doctor Who research magazine, Nothing at the End of the Lane. In 1965 Richard Bates of Watermill Productions approached the BBC about the possibility of making a radio series of Doctor Who for transmission abroad in Australia, Canada and the United States. Whilst there were reservations by some at the BBC a contract was finally agreed in early 1966., giving Watermill an option for six months. Boris Karloff was under consideration to play the Doctor: some 52 episodes were planned.\n\nMac was obvously approached by Bates to write for the projected series (they had worked together on The Avengers) for in June 1966 Watermill sent the BBC a 17 page script for a pilot episode written by him called “Journey Into Time”. Watermill told the BBC that they were now considering Robert Coote for the role of the Doctor, and the BBC extended the option until September. In the end the role was taken by Peter Cushing, who played the Doctor in two films made by Aaru prodictions: Dr. Who and the Daleks (1965) and Daleks’ Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. (1966). A recording of Mac’s script was made and sent to the BBC for evaluation.\n\nRichard Williams, Commercial Manager – Television Enterprises at the BBC, wrote to Bates: “All my colleagues who have heard the pilot have been very impressed and we trust that this enthusiasm will be shared by your customers.” The company (now called Stanmark) began issuing promotional material.\n\nBut some key figures within the BBC now starting to have doubts. Martin Esslin, Head of Drama (Sound) wrote in September that, whilst it was technically well produced:, “As a piece of science fiction, however, it strikes me as extremely feeble and it certainly isn’t anything I would recommend for broadcast in any of the spots for which I am responsible.” Others were more favourable, but in the end nothing more happened, the series was not proceeded with, while the recording vanished.\n\nMac’s script also vanished until Richard Bignell rediscovered it when researching the story of this lost radio series and it was included in the article in Nothing at the End of the Lane.\n\nIn the script the Doctor and Susan land the Tardis on Earth in 1967, three thousand years adrift from where they wanted to be. The Tardis turns into a police box while Susan decides she wants to go to school where she displays unusual knowledge eg of the binary system. Classmate Mike Logan rescues her from a bully and she vistis his house where Susan displays a great knowledge of plants. She tells Mike and his father : “My grandfather and I, we were once at a place that was covered in plants. They were all much bigger than your father’s..but the same varieties Zantedeschia Aethiopica and Adiantum Capillus Verens ..I mean they’d become big.. It was after an atomic bomb explosion. They’d mutated. They were rather dangerous.”\n\nMike tells his father: “...some of the things she says – it’s like she came from a different world.” He walks with her near to her home, but the only building nearby is a police box in a park. They meet Doctor Who (as he is called in the script) dressed in old fashioned clothes as Mike remarks. Doctor Who tells him he bought them in New York in 1910.\n\nBack at school Susan draws a Neanderthal Man on the blackboard and gets into trouble with her teacher. Walking her home again Mike thinks he sees Susan go into the police box. He goes back the next day and meets Doctor Who outside. When he hears Susan calling he manages to get inside the box and exclaims in shoc , “It’s like a giant electronic palace… .it’s so large Susan… I…I can’t believe it. How can it be so small outside and so big inside?” Doctor Who tells Mike that they come from Earth but from three thousand years in the future. They are unable to return home to their own time because the telechronometer is not working. Mike accidentally sets the Tardis in motion. On landing they discover that they are surrounded by soldiers and have landed in the middle of the American Revolution. (Fade Out) (Richard Bignell, “Journey Into Time”, Nothing at the End of the Lane, 3, 2012.) The Times, 14th January 2012, p.29.)\n\n“The Faceless Ones”: April and May 1967\n\n“The Tenth Planet”, broadcast in October 1966, was William Hartnell’s last serial. He had been suffering from ill-health and at that time Doctor Who was produced 40 weeks a year, so it was a relentless work schedule.\n\nRather than lose Doctor Who the programme makers, Innes Lloyd and Gerry Davis, took the bold and quite risky step of replacing the by now much-loved Hartnell with another actor, Patrick Troughton, ascribing the change to the Doctor having worn out his old body. As the new Doctor explains at the beginning of “The Power of the Daleks”: “ I’ve been renewed. It’s part of the Tardis. Without it, I couldn’t survive…”\n\nThe change of actors worked: the serial continued and remained just as popular for several years more, although the ratings did fall off in 1969.\n\nIt was in this new era that Mac’s first serial for Doctor Who was broadcast. It was co-written with Derrick Kerkham (who wrote under the name “David Ellis”), with whom he had started working after meeting him at the annual awards dinner of the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain in March 1966. Kerkham had written for series such as Dixon of Dock Green, Compact, and Crossroads. Like Mac., he had also pitched unsuccessfully to Doctor Who. Both knew the new Doctor Who script editor Gerry Davies from their time working on the football series United!\n\nFirst they pitched a story to Davies called “The People Who Couldn’t Remember” but this rejected by him in June. Davies explained that it was not the kind of story he was looking for and that in future they should avoid satire and humour. “Our viewing figures take a dive every time we introduce a joke in a script.” He went to advise them that what the show needed was a “strong scientific concept and loads and loads of menace.” At a meeting with the two writers to discuss more ideas Davies told them “We’d like you to do a story set in a big store.”\n\nBy November they had submitted a story line. In this the Doctor and his companions land in a department store in 1973 where they discover a plot by aliens to colonise the earth by wiping out out humanity with a plague. The aliens have infiltrated the store with a sub-species called The Chameleons who can change their appearance to mimic humans. Mac was keen to show the aliens as individuals with a range of beliefs rather an anonymous species. After receipt the producers told Mac and David that they had decided that they wanted it to be set in airport instead.\n\nThe revised serial (now called “Doctor Who and the Chameleons”) was formally commissioned by Davies on 3rd January 1967 to be delivered a month later. The future setting was abandoned, as was the plague (only to reappear in 1970 in Mac’s serial “The Silurians”). In February they were asked to write out Ben and Polly from the series, leaving just Jamie as a companion. (For an excellent in depth analysis of the development of this serial, please see: Andrew Pixley, “The Big Store”, Nothing at the End of the Lane, 4, Autumn 2015.)\n\nMac and David’s serial was broadcast under the title “”The Faceless Ones” in six parts in April and May 1967. The cast included Pauline Collins, Wanda Ventham and Gordon Kaye.\n\nThe Doctor and his companions – Ben (Michael Craze), Polly (Anneke Wills) and Jamie (Frazer Hines) – land in the Tardis on a runway at Gatwick airport and run for cover when they are spotted by a policeman. Whilst hiding, Polly sees a man killed in the offices of Chameleon Tours with some kind of electrical weapon. She shows the body to the Doctor and Jamie, but when they return with the airport’s Commandant the body has gone.\n\nUnknown to the Doctor and Jamie, Polly is taken prisoner by the Chameleon Tours aircrew. When Doctor and Jamie next meet Polly she denies knowing them or even being Polly. The Doctor tells Jamie : “You don’t want to believe everything you see…” Later we see duplicates of humans being revived and given faces in the medical centre.\n\nJamie meets Samanatha, looking for her brother Brian who went on a fight with Chameleon Tours – and never returned. We see the plane take off – and turn into spacecraft while the passengers appear to vanish. The Doctor discovers that aliens are stealing the identities of young air passengers in order to take over the world, their own planet having been devastated in an explosion. The aircraft is going into space to rendezvous with their command satelite. The Doctor tells the Commandant: “Things are not always what they seem…Chameleon Tours are not quite what they seem either.”\n\nThe Doctor defeats the aliens after taking an aircraft to the satellite masquerading as his duplicate while the originals of the duplicated humans are found just in time in the airport car park. In tone it feels similar to a number of episodes of The Avengers. which often featured mysterious disappearances.\n\nIn an interview in 1975 Mac said that this was the serial he enjoyed writing most. “If you remember the Chameleons… had taken over part of an airport and were methodically changing themselves into Earth people. So at any point in the story you were never quite sure whether a character whom you had got to know had been changed or was still him. It was a lot of fun…” (Gordon Blows, “The Malcolm Hulke Interview”, Tardis, 2, 1975)\n\nAlthough The Stage mentioned that the duo intended to collaborate on future projects and were working a six-part thriller for adults, this was their only work that made it to the screen.\n\nYou can read the full script as broadcast here.\n\nSadly only two episodes have survived of the serial but In 2020 an animated version of the missing episodes was released on DVD.\n\n“The War Games”: April to June 1969\n\nMalcolm’s next contribution to Doctor Who was “The War Games” which he co-wrote with Terrance Dicks, renewing their writing partnerships. It was broadcast between April and June 1969 and lasted an epic ten episodes, one of the longest Doctor Who serials ever made.\n\nIt was written at haste, because, as Terrance admitted in interviews, they had run out of scripts and needed something very urgently. He brought in his good friend Mac to help out and they were still writing the final parts when filming had already started on the first episodes. Pat Troughton had decided he wanted to leave the series, as had the actors playing his companions, Frazer Hines and Wendy Padbury.\n\nIn “The War Games” the Doctor and his companions, Jamie and Zoe, lands in the midst of what appears to be the First World War. The Doctor tells Jamie:“We’re back in history, Jamie. One of the most terrible times on the planet Earth.” They are pickud up by a British officer and nurse and taken to the British lines where they are accused by General Smythe of being spies. The Doctor is sentenced to death but escapes at the last minute, the first of many such escapes in the course of the story. Something is not quite right, though. The General has a modern video communicator in his bedroom and has the power to hypnotise his underlings, while nobody can remember how they got to the Front.\n\nThey discover that other wars from history such the Roman invasion of Britain and the American Civil War are taking place in different zones. Using the Aliens’ travel device – the Sidrat- the Doctor and Zoe get into the headquarters from where the wars are being co-ordinated. Here the Doctor meets a renegade from his own race, the War Chief.\n\nWAR CHIEF: You may have changed your appearance, but I know who you are.\n\nDOCTOR: Oh, do you?\n\nWAR CHIEF: Your machine is a Tardis. You’re too familiar with it’s controls to be a stranger.\n\nDOCTOR: I had every right to leave.\n\nWAR CHIEF: Stealing a Tardis? Oh, I’m not criticising you. We are two of a kind.\n\nDOCTOR: We most certainly are not!\n\nWAR CHIEF: We were both Time Lords and we both decided to leave our race.\n\nDOCTOR: I had reasons of my own.\n\nWAR CHIEF: Just as I had.\n\nDOCTOR: Your reasons are only too obvious. Power!\n\nWAR CHIEF: How much have you learnt of our plans?\n\nDOCTOR: I know that you’ve been kidnapping soldiers from the Earth from various times in it’s history and bringing them here to kill one another.\n\nWAR CHIEF: But do you realise our ultimate objectives?\n\nDOCTOR: No objective can justify such slaughter.\n\nWAR CHIEF: The war games on this planet are simply the means to an end. The aliens intend to conquer the entire galaxy. A thousand inhabited worlds.\n\nDOCTOR: Yes, but why choose the people of the Earth?\n\nWAR CHIEF: They are the most suitable recruits for our armies. Man is the most vicious species of all.\n\nDOCTOR: Well, that simply isn’t true.\n\nWAR CHIEF: Consider their history. For a half a million years they have been systematically killing each other. Now we can turn this savagery to some purpose. We can bring peace to the galaxy, and you can help. You see, I’m not the cold-hearted villain you suppose me to be. My motives are purely peaceful.\n\nThe Doctor, his companions and a motley army of rebels from different zones combine to defeat the Aliens, but the Doctor then has to summon the Time Lords to return all the soldiers back to their own times. Despite his efforts to escape they put him on trial for interfering on his travels and not standing aloof.\n\nTIME LORD: You have heard the charge against you, that you have repeatedly broken our most important law of non-interference in the affairs of other planets. What have you to say? Do you admit these actions?\n\nDOCTOR: I not only admit them, I am proud of them. While you have been content merely to observe the evil in the galaxy, I have been fighting against it.\n\nTIME LORD 3: It is not we who are on trial here, Doctor, it is you.\n\nDOCTOR: No, no, of course, you’re above criticism, aren’t you.\n\nTIME LORD: Do you admit that these actions were justified?\n\nDOCTOR: Yes, of course, I do. Give me a thought channel and I’ll show you some of the evils I’ve been fighting against.\n\n(The Time Lords nod to each other.)\n\nDOCTOR: The Quarks, deadly robot servants of the cruel Dominators, they tried to enslave a peace loving race. Then there were the Yeti, more robot killers, instruments of an alien intelligence trying to take over the planet Earth.\n\nTIME LORD 3: All this is entirely irrelevant.\n\nDOCTOR: You asked me to justify my actions, I am doing so. Let me show you the Ice Warriors, cruel Martian invaders, they tried to conquer the Earth too. So did the Cybermen, half creature, half machine. But worst of all were the Daleks, a pitiless race of conquerors exterminating all who came up against them. All these evils I have fought while you have done nothing but observe. True, I am guilty of interference, just as you are guilty of failing to use your great powers to help those in need!\n\nTIME LORD: Is that all you have to say?\n\nDOCTOR: Well, isn’t it enough?\n\nTIME LORD: Your defence has been heard and will be carefully considered, but you have raised difficult issues. We require time to think about them. You will be recalled when we have made our decision.\n\nThe Time Lords accept his plea, but exile him to Earth with a new identity as yet unknown, while Zoe and Jamie are returned to their own times, all knowledge of their travels with the Doctor removed from their minds.\n\nIn this story Mac and Terrance show war as violent, brutal and pointless, controlled by ruthless leaders who place no value on human lifer and who, whilst apparently on different sides – German, British, Yankee, Southerner – are in fact all working together.\n\nThey add to this by not giving the Aliens any names – only titles such as “The Security Chief” and “The War Lord” – while we never learn the name of their planet which is only ever referred to as “The Home Planet”. The writers go one further by showing that by combining together the soldiers can defeat their rulers, now that looks distinctly like Mac’s touch.\n\nThe serial seems to draw on Peter Watkins’ drama documentary about a nuclear attack on Britain The War Game (which was banned by the BBC in 1965 but screened by CND) and also Joan Littlewood’s theatre show Oh What A Lovely War, which was based on songs the soldiers made up themselves to tunes of the day and sang during the war. Some scenes in “The War Games” were actually shot on the set near Brighton where the film of Oh What A Lovely War had recently been made.\n\nThe serial attracted the lowest audience of Patrick Troughton’s last season in the role, just 4.9 million. In the years since, however, it has attracted greater appreciation. It’s my personal favourite of Mac’s serials for Doctor Who.\n\nWhen asked by Gordon Blows in an interview in 1975 whether “The War Games” could be made into a film, Mac replied that it would make a terrific film “but would be very expensive to produce. In television audiences will accept it if someone rushes in and tells the Doctor that they’re surrounded by ten thousand Romans soldiers/monsters/ Daleks…Only one or two need to be seen. But in the cinema adiences expect to see everything and that rockets up the costs.” (Gordon Blows, “The Malcolm Hulke Interview”, Tardis, 2, 1975)\n\nMac spoke about the serial in the only recorded interview I have been able to locate, made by Gary Hopkins: “You know when you work in collaboration it’s a good idea to forget immediately whose idea is which, so who got the basic idea and the development I would’t like to comment on.”\n\nHe said that they were given an important instruction:\n\nTo find way of changing Patrick Troughton’s appearance but to leave it open… Patrick had said he didn’t want to go on being Doctor Who, he’d done it for three or four years, he wished to leave. No one had been selected, so they wanted an open-ended serial. We then came up with the idea of Time Lords, this was a very complicated way of doing things, I suppose really, but it gave us a good few scenes about the Doctor’s trial and how he gets sent into exile.\n\nThat was another thing, they wanted him to look different in the next series, because they hadn’t got Patrick Troughton any more, and they had also found that serials that took place on Earth tended to get higher ratings so they wanted him exiled to Earth for some reason or other, then they just left left it to us to work it all that out. I think we did quite an interesting job. It was to have been a six parter but after we started, a four parter by somebody else fell through… We were told after we had scripted three or four episodes, “Can you make it go to ten?” It was the sort of story you could stretch. I believe it did begin to lose ratings towards the end. Now the War Lords idea must have come early. I wonder if we got the Time Lords idea at the same time? Certainly we wouldn’t have started scripting until we got those things sorted out.\n\nWriting for television you’ve got to think all the time economically about sets and cast..\n\n(Gary Hopkins, recorded interview with Malcolm Hulke: The Doctor Who Podcast, 17th April 2013)\n\nSicher ist Sicher (Better Safe Than Sorry) : 4th October 1964.\n\nThis crime comedy by Eric and Mac was broadcast on German television by ADR/WDR.
