        "text": "These are John Carr's science fiction recommendations. All of these books can be found in the MIT Science Fiction Society library, though not all of them can be checked out.\n\nI could argue literary merit vs. fun vs. scientific accuracy vs. broad appeal, but when I ask myself \"which books would I most recommend\" these come out at the top.\n\nThe books marked with \"*\" are especially recommended.\n\nAuthorBookComments Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Silly SF.
