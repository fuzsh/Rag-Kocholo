        "text": "Now we’ve got time on our freshly cleaned hands,\n\nThe Spectator’s literary luminaries are lubricating the wheels on time’s wingèd chariot and seizing the chance to boost their morale and brain function, reflect on the meaning of life and catch up on a good book or six. Each day, the Lockdown List carries our bibliophilic recommendations.\n\nDay 74: Indian summer\n\nRoss Clark\n\nThe success of Black Lives Matter has deflected attention from a group which has no less a cause for grievance over its treatment throughout US history: native Americans. Indeed, to this day Native Americans, thousand for thousand, have an even greater chance of being killed by police officers as do African Americans.\n\nThe Earth is Weeping tells the story of the decisive years in the fate of the Indians on the western plains (and in this book, which is delightfully free of politically correct language and doctrines, they really are Indians) between the 1860s and 1880s. It is essentially an age-old tale repeated so many times over human history, from the enclosures in 19th century England to the Amazon of the present day: the battle between hunter-gathers and cultivators, between wanderers and settlers, between those who belonged to the land and those who considered the land belonged to them. Ultimately there was only going to be one winner, not just because the US cavalry had superior firepower but because the Indian way of life was fatally-dependent on the buffalo, whose herds were inevitably going to be disrupted and diminished as US settlement pushed westwards.\n\nEven so, the Indians could pack a punch and on several notable occasions scored important victories against the white man. Their firepower often impressed the cavalry, not least in their ability to fire an arrow straight through a buffalo and out the other side — something a bullet from a Colt .45 could not achieve. Rains of arrows put paid to more than ill thought-out advance. Unlike bullets, the arrows could be pulled out of dead soldiers and reused.\n\nThis is a refreshingly fair book which tells the story straight. Cozzens doesn’t hold back on the crimes of hot-headed generals like Armstrong Custer and their unprovoked murderous attacks on Indians — even against those who just wanted to live peacefully on the lands where they had always lived. But neither does it romanticize the Indians as innocents.It describes in great detail their violence – both that towards the white man and toward other Indian tribes. Fighting was inbred in their culture long before the cavalry arrived to dispossess them. They, too, often staged unprovoked attacks of settlers. Not only could they be efficient killers; their treatment of bodies after battle was little short of psychopathic. After Custer and his men had been surrounded and killed at Little Bighorn the warriors withdrew in victory — only for the womenfolk and children to desecrate the bodies in ways which are described graphically and which require a strong stomach to read.\n\nThe Earth is Weeping is a tragedy played out under big skies and in fickle weather which could often turn from searing heat to temperatures of minus 40. It is a story punctuated with treaties and broken promises, where the land available to Indians contracted progressively to the reservations which exist today. As someone who has never been out west, it left me enchanted by the vastness of the place — and, from the vantage point of lockdown, pining for the freedom of those who called it home.\n\nDay 73: Escaping New York with Heyerdahl and de Gaulle\n\nJohn R. MacArthur\n\nEarly in the lockdown I thirsted for stories of resistance, so I pulled the World War Two memoirs of Charles de Gaulle from the shelf and dedicated myself to reading the whole thing. Stirring stuff, especially the run up to the general’s dramatic radio appeal to occupied France, on June 18, 1940, for continued war against Germany, and later his recounting of the tenacious defense by outnumbered Free French forces against Rommel’s Afrika Corps at the fortress of Bir-Hakeim. The perfect companion book was Ernest R. May’s revisionist history of the Fall of France, Strange Victory, since it argues that with better luck and intelligence methods, the French military — not at all overmatched in weaponry and manpower — could well have halted the German blitzkrieg during those four awful days in May 1940 and stopped Nazism in its tracks.\n\nNow I just want to escape from virus-occupied New York, so I’m rereading Kon-Tiki, Thor Heyerdahl’s hair-raising account of his 1947 voyage from Peru to Polynesia on a balsa wood sailing raft. An ethnographer and adventurer, Heyerdahl wanted to demonstrate how Indians from the Americas could have settled the South Seas perhaps a thousand years earlier, although his theory was controversial even then. But while he probably got the history wrong, he inadvertently provided a powerful rebuke of modernist architecture and design that I’ve never forgotten. On the deck of Heyerdahl’s vessel, he had built a ‘shaky bamboo cabin’ situated ‘only a foot and half above the water line’, open to the ocean and the sky, but nevertheless a great comfort to a crew surrounded by raging seas and thousands of miles from land. Why? Because of variety — a variety of building materials and colors as opposed to monotonously flat surfaces and uniform structures:\n\n‘The green and yellow bars, with fringes of foliage hanging down from the roof, were restful to they eye as a white cabin wall never could have been…this primitive lair gave us a greater feeling of security than white painted bulkheads and closed portholes would have given in the same circumstances… There we could lie on our backs and look up at the curious roof which twisted about like boughs in the wind, enjoying the jungle smell of raw wood, bamboo, and withered palm leaves.’\n\nI’m happy to know that Heyerdahl also served with the Free Norwegian forces that fought the German occupiers of his homeland.\n\nDay 72: Ulysses S. Grant, misunderstood president\n\nMatt Mayer\n\nEvery now and again I find myself reading a book that proves to be timely. On this occasion, that book, Grant, is Ron Chernow’s biography of 18th president and Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant. Although the book runs to nearly 1,000 pages, Chernow’s organization allows him to dive deeply into each aspect of Grant’s life without covering minutiae that would lose most readers. Many historians have praised Grant the General, but dismissed Grant the President. Chernow shows why that approach is a mistake.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s recent gaffe in which he stated that any black person who votes for Donald Trump isn’t really black should ignite the broader debate about the Republican party’s rich history in improving the lives of African Americans. Of course, President Abraham Lincoln gets enormous credit for the Emancipation Proclamation and committing the North to the cause of ending slavery, but Chernow reminds us how critical Grant’s role was in that story. Specifically, Grant not only backed Lincoln’s position during the Civil War, but also fought aggressively as president to protect African Americans from violence, break the Ku Klux Klan and ultimately do what he could to give African Americans political equality.\n\nAdditionally, Grant, like Donald Trump, wasn’t a career politician or committed Republican, so was viewed by the political class as ‘uniquely stupid’. Nonetheless, his most ardent critics had to concede that ‘We do not know why the president is successful, we only know that he succeeds’. Chernow’s treatment of Grant is even-handed, showing both his failures when it came to trusting people and his successes in getting results.\n\nFinally, Grant shared another trait with Trump that ultimately made him successful. As Confederate general Robert E. Lee noted about Grant near the climax of the war, ‘Grant is not retreating; he is not a retreating man.’ Despite failing miserably in his private life, Grant’s ability to win during wars spanned both his service in the Mexican-American War and the Civil War. This record largely was due to his refusal to retreat married with his penchant to attack — he clearly believed being on offense won battles and wars. Trump possesses a similar mentality as seen in his constant use of Twitter and his relentless clashes with the mainstream media. While some people are troubled by these tactics, Trump’s ardent supporters love what he does. Like Grant, he fights to win.\n\nI believe Chernow’s book will force historians to reevaluate Grant’s presidency. I hope it also spurs more Americans to pick up this book to learn about one of the most fascinating presidents in American history. I can only imagine what a biography about Trump will look like 150 years after his presidency.\n\nMatt Mayer served in the Department of Homeland Security and now works at Opportunity Ohio.\n\nDay 71: Count your blessings\n\nLara Prendergast\n\nWith a newborn baby to look after, I haven’t found a huge amount of time to read. Instead, I’ve watched two epics — The Sopranos and The Wire — and have convinced myself that I can chalk these up somehow.\n\nThe book I would love to re-read in lockdown isn’t exactly a hidden gem — I imagine most people have come across The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas — but I read it one summer in my early twenties, while looking after three Italian children on Lake Como. I had time on my hands, the summer felt long, and the Count kept me company.\n\nIt’s a tale about a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes and sets about seeking revenge on those responsible for keeping him cooped up. The perfect companion for a long summer’s lockdown, I’d say.\n\nLara Prendergast is Food & Drink editor for The Spectator’s US edition.\n\nDay 70: Cicero, Obama and Chrissie Hynde\n\nRod Liddle\n\nI’ve been reading John Gribbin’s Schrödinger’s Kittens, just to assure myself that reality does not exist either at a quantum level or indeed inside my own house. The early days of lockdown were spent re-reading Cicero’s speeches which, as a young man, I thought wonderful, but now remind me of Obama at his most duplicitous. Also Asian Waters: Chinese Expansion and the Shifting Balance of Power by the excellent Humphrey Hawksley, to prepare myself for the next Armageddon, and Robert Harris’s brilliant new novel The Second Sleep, which is dark and cunning.\n\nThe most odd, perhaps remarkable, has been a book which I suspect is self-published: Disappearing by a man called Chris Heal, who may not be actually called Chris Heal. It is erudite, confused, deranged in parts, entertaining and thoughtful. It tells the story of an Englishman who wishes to remove himself from the modern world and involves himself, along the way, in various wars in Africa. It purports to be a true story, but I have my doubts because the protagonist boasts of murdering Jean-Claude Juncker. A man who is, to the best of my knowledge, still alive. Between Gribbin and Heal the current crisis seems ephemeral. Oh, I also read Chrissie Hynde’s autobiography. Boy, did that Akron babe do drugs.\n\nRod Liddle is a Spectator columnist.\n\nDay 69: Cocktails in Brooklyn\n\nCaroline McCarthy\n\nIn May 2020, I was supposed to be visiting New Orleans for the second time. The first had been last December, and my traveling companion (my younger brother) and I were unable to do quite as much as we’d wanted to. We only had a long weekend in the first place, the weather was notably bad, and we needed pretty much a full 48-hours and a lot of Excedrin to adjust to the novelty of a city where you can order a cocktail at a bar and just wander around with it on the street. So I’d been looking forward to this second visit.\n\nNow, given how 2020 has chosen to unfold, the trip to New Orleans was called off and in a twist of irony, cocktails-to-go are now commonplace on my home turf of Brooklyn. The place down the block is even selling frosé. But I have chosen to add Lawrence N. Powell’s The Accidental City: Improvising New Orleans to my pandemic reading list. As this book meanders like a lazy river through the Crescent City’s early epochs, these days the reader may find it both shocking and soothing how many norms and seemingly permanent institutions just sort of happened without much planning or foresight. And yet here it is, and here we are. On the bright side, at least things aren’t boring.\n\nCaroline McCarthy is a contributing editor to The Spectator’s US edition.\n\nDay 68: Alaskan Jews\n\nDaniel M. Bring\n\nNot every day does the biography of a Confederate general cracks the top 10 of the New York Times’s bestseller list. But Rebel Yell: The Violence, Passion, and Redemption of Stonewall Jackson by S.C. Gwynne managed that feat, and for good reason.\n\nIn Rebel Yell, Gwynne charts the life of Thomas ‘Stonewall’ Jackson and the battles that made him one of the most famed and feared field commanders in American history. Within its pages, Jackson appears as a complete person — demonstrating greatness and great faults — who was as much a devoted husband and devout Christian as he was a ruthless and unyielding warrior.\n\nThe narrative pursues the young Jackson from his orphaned childhood in Appalachian Virginia to the halls of Montezuma at Chapultepec, where he distinguished himself in the Mexican-American War. Amid the Civil War, the stoic Jackson stands ‘like a stonewall’ at First Manassas in 1861, raises hell in the Shenandoah Valley in 1862, and dies from pneumonia after being accidentally shot by Confederate skirmishers at Chancellorsville in 1863.\n\nThrough Jackson’s travails, Gwynne also tells the wider story of the first half of the American Civil War. He treats all of its dramatis personae — the admirably-conservative but grandstanding Union General George McClellan, for instance — with balance and consideration similar to that he affords Jackson.\n\nAlternate history books about World War Two, like The Man in the High Castle or The Plot Against America, mostly ask the big questions. What if the Axis won? What if America went Nazi? In The Yiddish Policeman’s Union (2007), Michael Chabon expounds on a more specific question: what if the Roosevelt administration, instead of sending Jewish refugees back to the Nazis, sent them to Sitka, Alaska?\n\nAs implausible as that may sound, a Jewish state in Alaska almost happened. The Slattery Report recommended that option, but the administration rejected it. In this timeline, the man most responsible for its rejection died in a car crash. So arises a massive Ashkenazi metropolis, replete with Yiddish street names, Hasidic mafiosi, and the most (surprisingly) mouth-watering descriptions of Jewish food to be found in print. To his invented world, Chabon brings an ethnographer’s eye for details — such as the cultural integration of Sitka’s Filipino minority — as well as a geographer’s eye for scenery, with lush, atmospheric depictions of the snow-swept Pacific Northwest.\n\nReaders enter this curious world just as it is coming to an end. The 60-year-lease of Sitka is expiring, and the evangelical government of the US plans to resettle its inhabitants to a war-torn state of Israel. The murder of a would-be messiah leads an unassuming alcoholic detective — the novel’s pulpy protagonist — to uncover an elaborate government conspiracy. ‘Strange times to be a Jew,’ is the characters’ oft-repeated aphorism. Strange times, indeed.\n\nDay 67: Godless in Belfast\n\nAndrew Doyle\n\nForrest Reid, one of the great prose stylists of the early 20th century, deserves to be far better known. Even in his home city of Belfast he is considered obscure. His first autobiography, Apostate (1926,) is the best of its kind, a passionate account of his first 16 years, the time which, for Reid, were the most important in any life. So horrified was he by the prospect of becoming an adult that he took an overdose of laudanum before his 17th birthday. ‘I wanted to be a boy always,’ he writes. ‘I would have given gladly the remainder of my existence to have had the past five years over again’. He was violently ill, but soon recovered.\n\nReid was an animist; he believed that the Belfast landscape was alive with spirits. His paganism was instinctive, a remarkable quality for a boy brought up in the Church of Ireland tradition. As a small child, marshaled into his Sunday best and then into church pews, he would scream and throw his hymnal to the floor. ‘I hated Sunday,’ he writes in Apostate. ‘I hated church, I hated Sunday School, I hated Bible stories, I hated everybody mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments, except perhaps the impenitent thief, Eve’s snake, and a few similar characters’.\n\nApostate is not only beautifully written, but offers a fascinating recreation of pre-industrial Belfast. Seen through the perspective of this unique boy, the city takes on an almost ethereal quality. Reid was a visionary in the Romantic tradition of Blake and Wordsworth. In the early chapters of Apostate he tells us of a ‘tall smiling figure with long, pointed, yellow teeth’ who would tower over him in bed. ‘If I had the requisite skill I could draw that face now,’ he writes, ‘as I still half-believe I could have photographed it then’.\n\nI have yet to read an autobiographical account of childhood as powerful and engaging as Apostate; it supersedes even Edmund Gosse’s Father and Son (1907), another favorite of mine. Although much of Reid’s work is out of print, Faber issued a paperback version of Apostate in 2011. Alternatively, if you can get hold of Faber’s 1947 edition it’s well worth the investment, as it is illustrated with some brilliantly evocative wood engravings by Reynolds Stone.\n\nDay 66: Just like old times\n\nAlan Cornett\n\nDuring a time when it’s impossible to travel, and often difficult even to get outside, I’ve enjoyed the writings of English author Robert Macfarlane. Macfarlane is a Cambridge professor, but not the sort you find in an ivory tower. He’s far more likely to be walking an ancient path or sliding through a tight spot in an underground cavern. I recently completed his book The Old Ways: A Journey On Foot, in which Macfarlane describes his long walks and rediscovery of often ancient pathways. He reconnects to an earlier time and opens up often lost ways of thinking.\n\nI’ve now taken up his most recent book Underland: A Deep Time Journey. Rather than walking old paths, Macfarlane takes a plunge into caverns that are thousands, or millions, of years old. There he still finds the legacy of man, our ancestors who left us messages from tens of thousands of years ago. If you feel stuck at home, Macfarlane’s writings will let you do some thoughtful traveling at home.\n\nAlan Cornett is a writer in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nDay 65: Thunder at twilight\n\nMichael Auslin\n\nIt’s hard not to feel that the corona-crisis is much bigger, if possible, than its direct effects; that it embodies somehow a fundamental break with the world of the past half-century, at least, and all its presumptions, especially about globalization. That should probably mitigate towards some light reading, Agatha Christie or P.G. Wodehouse, but the issues seem too important to try and divert one’s attention from.\n\nThe sociopolitical balance in Western democracies already seemed so threatened, even before coronavirus, that it seems necessary to plumb how our fractured view of the world came about. I’m trudging through Alasdair MacIntyre’s After Virtue, 35 years after failing to understand any of it as a college freshman. His limning of our modern emotivist worldview, a product of the failure of the Enlightenment to replace traditional Aristotelian ethics, is the best explanation I’ve come across for why we can agree on nothing and why all we can do is yell at each other. Read it with David Rieff’s Triumph of the Therapeutic, which a half-century ago perfectly, indeed eerily, predicted the intellectual and emotional breakdown that defines our world.\n\nIf MacIntyre and Rieff’s philosophy and sociology is correct, then we’re in the middle of a fundamental historical change. Jacob Burkhardt’s The Age of Constantine the Great beautifully, if datedly, lays out the epochal transition from the pagan classical world to the later Christian Roman empire and an entirely new worldview. The exhaustion of Western liberalism, the ‘decadence’ identified two decades ago by the late Jacques Barzun and more recently by Ross Douthat, similarly afflicted the Roman Empire before the transformation in Constantine’s generation. With no new integrative belief system on the horizon, our breakdown seems more to point to a new Dark Age than a renascence.\n\nCOVID itself seems to be a new dark age, where monsters lurk and we all pray for a magic solution to keep the dangers at bay. For many, our horizons have shrunk to our houses, blocks, and neighborhoods, while the larger world suddenly feels far away and mysterious. But venture into it we must, at some point, regardless of the threats. I always regretted never feeling much moved to read The Lord of the Rings, but I now feel compelled, and have grabbed my one-volume edition to eagerly follow, if not empathize with, Frodo and his fellowship as they leave the Shire and journey to Mordor. But whenever it ends, I think I’m going to need some Wodehouse.\n\nMichael Auslin is the author of Asia’s New Geopolitics.\n\nDay 64: Amis is a hit\n\nDamian Reilly\n\nSurprising they haven’t canceled Martin Amis yet. Throw Money: A Suicide Note in the air and let it fall open where it will. There’ll be more than enough there for the social justice mouth-breathers and culture psychopaths to go at — more than enough to deem, what’s the word? problematic. It’s all ‘faggot’ this and ‘bumboy’ that. Violence visited upon women: early on the narrator lets us know he is ‘a hitter’, and a memorably busy paragraph on page 291 begins, ‘Then I tried to rape her again.’ There’s no shortage, too, of racial epithets that back in the early Eighties, when the book was written, might not have seemed so shocking, but that today cannot fail to make the modern reader wince.\n\nWhy hasn’t one of the more lurid female television news anchors — the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, say — had the opportunity yet to give the septuagenarian author the treatment, live on air? ‘You say Money is intended to be a comedy, but can you explain what’s funny, to pluck a sentence at random, about: “thus midday discovered me with a second scotch in my hand, a Pakki nightie round my waist, and a half naked sex stewardess straddling my thighs”?’\n\nAmis, you’d imagine, might try to weasel out with the usual excuses — the novel’s narrator is not meant to be sympathetic, he’s meant to be grotesque. But that wouldn’t wash. No, sir. Because the problem is the novel’s narrator is grotesque, but he’s also incredibly sympathetic. He gets more so by the page. Send for the cancel firing-squad goons!\n\nI picked up Money in a moment of lockdown despair, because it’s blindingly funny. I think this is the fourth time I’ve read it. It’s about a man, John Self, who is trying to get a movie made. He jets between the mirror-worlds of New York and London, and behaves appallingly in both. The joke, and it’s a good one, is no matter what he does, he keeps getting richer. And he keeps being indulged. The writing is beyond the reach of virtually every other modern writer. It’s dizzying, virtuoso stuff — 450 pages comprising only sentences that can’t be improved, every word picked with the poet’s precision. The high voltage energy is maintained throughout — there’s no lag, no attempted triple backflip that doesn’t land perfectly.\n\nAmis, thanks to Money but also to London Fields, both masterpieces, is the only British writer able to enter, let alone stand a round, in a bar containing Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Don DeLillo and Richard Ford. He is easily the greatest living British writer and should therefore be celebrated keenly, at every opportunity.\n\nWhich is why they’ll cancel him. If they can’t do it while he’s alive – and they probably can – they’ll definitely do it when he’s dead.\n\nDay 63: Days of her life\n\nPatrick Allitt\n\nLockdown has been kind to me. I live in a big house with a lovely wife, two bouncy dogs and a super garden that’s just reached its springtime best. I’m compensating for these blessings by reading a book about a famous American ascetic: Dorothy Day by John Loughery and Blythe Randolph. In early life Day (1897-1980) was a Greenwich Village radical, writing for the Masses, having an affair with Eugene O’Neill and getting herself arrested outside the White House during a women’s suffrage rally, then going on hunger strike in prison.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, however, she astonished her friends by converting to Catholicism and founding a newspaper, the Catholic Worker, that preached an uncompromising blend of absolute pacifism and radical poverty. For the rest of her life she opened her doors to society’s outcasts, asking nothing of them and giving everything in return. She proved, perhaps inadvertently, that to live a genuinely Christian life makes shattering demands that no ordinary mortal can manage. The FBI collected a bulky file on her anti-war activism while belligerent bishops denounced her. Still, they knew that, in the long run, she was a much likelier candidate for sanctification than they were!\n\nPatrick Allitt is a professor of American history at Emory University.\n\nDay 62: The right stuff\n\nAndrew Bacevich\n\nSpectator readers might enjoy American Conservatism: Reclaiming an Intellectual Tradition, just published by the Library of America. Don’t be deterred by the fact that I am the editor of this anthology, which collects works by American conservatives or by writers working in the conservative vein. The collection begins with Henry Adams and finishes up with the likes of Antonin Scalia, Patrick Deneen and Wendell Berry. It even includes Zora Neale Hurston and Joan Didion. Trust me: plenty of food for thought here, which is what the country needs just now.\n\nAndrew Bacevich is co-founder and president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.\n\nDay 61: Trigger warnings and tricky words\n\nHeather Mac Donald\n\nBefore mask-wearing and the ecstatic shunning of outdoor mask refuseniks, the safetyism ideology that is currently destroying millions of livelihoods in the name of public health had already taken root. Witness the pre-corona sidewalks of Manhattan. A young child, maybe 40 inches tall, would be slowly wheeled along on a tiny tricycle scooter by his father, the father’s hand resting protectively on the boy’s shoulders. This three-wheeled toy is eminently stable, yet the boy would invariably be wearing a massive helmet, lest somehow he keel over and hit the ground. Given the boy’s lack of both height and momentum, such an unlikely fall would not even produce a bruise, yet every possible precaution had been taken to protect him from calamity.\n\nAn antidote to these bubble-wrapped childhoods lies in H.L. Mencken’s luminous memoire of growing up in 1880s Baltimore, Happy Days. It was a time when boys were still allowed to raise hell, explore city alleys and bramble-filled ravines, defend territory, and torment girls — all untethered from officious adults. Mencken’s treatment of boyhood is in the great ironic tradition of Booth Tarkington (Penrod) and Mark Twain. Fittingly, his life-long obsession with books started with the discovery of Huckleberry Finn at age nine: ‘probably the most stupendous event of my whole life’, he writes. ‘If I undertook to tell you the effect it had upon me, my talk would sound frantic, and even delirious…I had not gone further than the first incomparable chapter before I realized, child though I was, that I had entered a domain of new and gorgeous wonders.’\n\nMencken captures the vibrancy of the post-bellum American city, with its abundance and squalors. Chesapeake Bay provided oysters and prime hard crabs, ‘blue in color, and with snow white meat almost as firm as soap’. Summer in the country brought stewed blackberries, served warm over just baked bread. ‘To this day I can taste it at the moments when an aging man’s memory searches through his lost youth for bursts of completely felicity.\n\nBugs were everywhere: mosquitoes, chiggers, bumble bees, and huge beetles that blackened ceilings in the summer. Mencken and his brother Charlie were always ravenous but were only allowed to gorge themselves without restraint on Christmas, provoking the inevitable visit from the doctor. Odd taboos governed what children could safely eat: No uncooked fruit, for example. How lucky we are to live in times when people are more sensible about risk!\n\nMencken’s father, a traveling cigar salesman, is a powerful presence, his mother invisible. The father took his son with him to visit customers in the cool, shady saloons of Washington DC, a city notable at the time for its modern asphalt streets. The father’s Christmas gifts introduced Mencken to technology and the trades — the most fateful being a toy printing press. Less successful were a microscope (revealing a ‘revolting mass of worms’ in a drop of vinegar), an electric battery, and a box of carpenter’s tools.\n\nWhat would Mencken make of today’s social distancing enforcers? He and his fellow gang members certainly did not think well of the police: ‘A cop was a congenitally iniquitous character, an enemy to society, a master of all the slimy devices of espionage and betrayal. He was against all the manly sports of boys of normal mind and high metabolism. If they started a ballgame in the street, he would take his stand behind a tree a block away, watching for some violation of his arbitrary and incomprehensible regulations, and spoiling all the fun.’ That today’s officious rule comes not from the authorities but from private citizens would not surprise Mencken. The more books he read, he wrote, the more he acquired a ‘despondent view of humanity’.\n\nTrigger warning: Mencken’s sympathetic but honest description of Baltimore’s blacks, who were suffering under all the enforced ignorance that slavery and segregation could impose, would not get past current school and publishing house censors.\n\nAnother memoir is a rebuke to contemporary college students, whose fantastical illusions of identity-based threat and demands for bureaucratic protection from that threat set the stage for the virus panic. Richard Henry Dana, Jr., whose Boston ancestors played a central role in the nation’s founding, took a ‘gap year’ from Harvard in 1834 unlike any of the credentializing internships with progressive institutions favored by today’s elite student.\n\nDana signed up as a sailor on a Boston trading ship, believing that non-bookish work would save his failing eyesight. The ship headed around the tip of South America to California, then a Mexican province, to purchase cowhides for leather manufacturers on the East Coast. Dana’s diary, which became Two Years Before the Mast, recorded without a trace of self-pity the incomprehensibly grueling work of a sailor, unfathomable today even if one is not a member of the knowledge class. The captain abused the crew with floggings, a reminder of the dangers of unchecked power that most moderns have put out of mind with their treacly view of human nature. Scarcity and deprivation were an unremarkable fact of life; the reader joys along with the crew at a windfall of precious fresh onions, vital for curing a fellow shipmate’s potentially lethal scurvy.\n\nDana’s descriptions of the terrors and sublime beauties of the sea are gripping, but the highpoint of Two Years Before the Mast is his ethnography of the different cultures bumping up against each other at the primitive ports of San Pedro, Santa Barbara, Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay. The aristocratic sloth and peacock preening of the Mexican male aristocracy augur their demise; the enterprising Germans and crafty Russians vie with the Americans for commercial advantage, while the sleek native Indians share their navigational skills with the Anglo-European traders. Here was real ‘diversity’, without double standards or victimhood, that would likely send a contemporary Harvard student running for the shelter of his ideologically monolithic Gender Studies class. Dana foresaw how American entrepreneurship would transform the stark California coast and unleash untold wealth, which he confirmed upon a repeat visit to San Francisco in 1859.\n\nDana returned to Harvard in 1836 ‘in a state of intellectual famine, to books and study and intercourse with educated men’, and graduated with highest honors. He brought out Two Years Before the Mast in 1840 for the measly sum of $250 and no royalties; as the first account of pre-Gold Rush California and a literary masterwork in its own right, the chronicle became a success on both sides of the Atlantic. In his subsequent law practice, Dana defended fugitive slaves and agitated against sailors’ traditional state of indentured servitude.\n\nVocabulary warning: The book’s nautical terminology is hard-going for the uninitiated. Sail through it.\n\nThe daring, joy, and manliness memorialized in these great narratives recall a world that grows more remote with every injunction to ‘stay safe’.\n\nHeather Mac Donald is the Thomas W. Smith fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a contributing editor at City Journal and a frequent Spectator contributor. Her latest book is The Diversity Delusion.\n\nDay 60: Avoid Graham Greene\n\nF.H. Buckley\n\nShut-ins during a pandemic are expected to dig out the big books they’ve always meant to read. Horsefeathers!\n\nWhat people want, when they read the daily death tables, are distractions, not Milton. For those who’ve been binge-watching the Bosch series on Amazon, therefore, let me suggest the 22 novels on which it’s based, by Michael Connelly. Start with the beginning. Apart from being the closest thing to Raymond Chandler, it’s also an insider’s guide to the neighborhoods and restaurants of LA. Venice. Angel Flight. Musso and Frank. Du-Par. If you can’t visit them, the next best thing is to read about them.\n\nIf that’s a little infra dig for you, how about some classics that are ripping good yarns? War and Peace, Howards End, Crouchback. Sure, you’ve read them, but they’re fun re-readables.\n\nOne negative suggestion. Not a good time for Greeneland or novels set in leper colonies.\n\nF.H. Buckley’s latest book is American Secession: The Looming Threat of a National Breakup (Encounter).\n\nDay 59: A genius for inaccuracy\n\nAnthony Daniels\n\nFather and Son by Edmund Gosse is a beautiful childhood memoir of the ambivalent relationship between the author and his suffocatingly religious but very affectionate widowed father, P.H. Gosse, who was also one the great naturalists of the Victorian era. Gosse senior was an accomplished artist whose illustrations in his books were paeans to the glory of God; but as a member of the strict Plymouth Brethren sect, he did not allow his son much boyish pleasure, albeit that he inducted him into the glories of the natural world. Gosse junior became the most famous literary critic of his time, though Henry James said of him that he had a genius for inaccuracy. All the same, his memoir is a moving account of how he escaped from a confinement that was both very limiting and a rich source of experience and reflection.\n\nAnthony Daniels is a contributing editor to City Journal.\n\nDay 58: Locked down with Mrs Thatcher\n\nMatt Ridley\n\nA charming new book that delves deep into both genes and fossils, while also telling stories about intriguing people, is Some Assembly Required by Neil Shubin. It’s science writing at its best, unraveling deep mysteries about evolution and finding very surprising results: our memories may depend on ancient viruses, for example. Also on science, a spy thriller of great suspense is Trinity by Frank Close, about Klaus Fuchs, who stole the secrets of the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb for the Soviet Union, while MI5 and the FBI missed several chances to catch him. A great novel, only it happens to be non-fiction. But for lockdown length, there is nothing better than Charles Moore’s third volume of Margaret Thatcher, the culmination of an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary career. And from May 19 you can buy my new book How Innovation Works: and Why it Flourishes in Freedom.\n\nMatt Ridley is the author of How Innovation Works and a frequent contributor to The Spectator.\n\nDay 57: Cromwell’s road\n\nRev. Michael Coren\n\nSir Diarmaid MacCulloch is one of finest historians in the English-speaking world and preeminent in the area of the English Reformation. He has combined his expertise in 16th-century history with a compelling literary style in his latest book, Thomas Cromwell: A Revolutionary Life. It’s the definitive work on Henry VIII’s great minister and an extraordinary insight into the politics and religion of the age, and of any age for that matter. Thomas Cromwell’s somewhat dark reputation was given a new and bright shine by Hilary Mantel in the Wolf Hall trilogy and this life takes us from the fictional into the authentic; its triumph is that it is just as thrilling and equally stimulating and challenging. A profoundly important book.\n\nRev. Michael Coren is the biographer of G.K. Chesterton, J.R.R. Tolkien and H.G. Wells.\n\nDay 56: The survivor’s tale\n\nJulie Bindel\n\nRachel Moran’s Paid For is a powerful memoir based on her experiences of prostitution from the age of 15 on the streets of Dublin. Moran’s book inspired sex-trade survivor-led movements including SPACE (Survivors of Prostitution Abuse Calling for Enlightenment) International, and became a useful weapon in the global fight against the normalization of commercial sexual exploitation. Moran, abused into prostitution as a homeless 15-year-old found the strength to escape after seven years, signed up for a journalism degree, and then took a decade to write a book that would educate the general public against so-called ‘sex work’.\n\nIf you are looking for something uplifting to read during lockdown and this title puts you off, don’t let it. It is the most courageous, optimistic and beautiful book you will read on such a harrowing topic. In exposing the truth about the sex trade, this book will save lives.\n\nDay 55: Mysteries of the lockdown life\n\nMelanie McDonagh\n\nThe optimistic take on lockdown reading is that it’s the chance to read big, demanding books. This may be possible if you’re in solitary confinement but if you’re living with others, your best bet is a series of short books.\n\nThe obvious choice is Albert Camus’s The Plague. Right now it raises all sorts of questions: were the restaurants of the town of Oran really serving customers to the end of lockdown, with just rice running low? It was a very sociable crisis. Though they didn’t have streaming, poor things.\n\nPenguin has issued all 75 of the Inspector Maigret books by Georges Simenon; if you’re an addict, a pile of them to read one after another would be bliss.\n\nThrillers in general are good lockdown material. I’ve had an Eric Ambler phase. There’s something about the claustrophobic atmosphere, the helplessness of the decent ordinary man inexorably caught up in bizarre circumstances which make these stories grip even if I can’t follow the plot. They’re a classy read. Try the best known, The Mask of Dimitrios, which starts in Istanbul and ends in Paris.\n\nGraham Greene’s 1932 novel Stamboul Train has that excellent quality of the train thriller, viz, a contained setting: characters can’t get away between stations. Like all the best of them, the destination is Istanbul. It’s wonderfully expressive of the tense atmosphere of the time. Modern readers will wince at the merciless depiction of anti-Semitism, but it’s not Greene’s attitude here; it’s society’s.\n\nFor history, Eamon Duffy has written a terrific short book on John Henry Newman, especially good on his take on the psychology of religion.\n\nFor American history, go search for a copy of The Aspirin Age, brilliant essays on wonderfully various aspects of the period 1919-41 by well-known writers, edited by Isabel Leighton. The one on the Ku Klux Klan, Robert Coughlan’s ‘Konklave in Kokomo’, is very funny. Bring it back into print, someone.\n\nDay 54: Death by ennui\n\nCameron Hendy\n\nIt’s almost arrogant to try and recommend a book by Michel Houellebecq. The man is quite literally a genius, and the generally understood Houellebecqian premise of a western world in terminal and irreversible decline is hard to argue with: so what can be gained by punishing ourselves further and reading him again now?\n\nHis latest novel — Serotonin — was reviewed by Douglas Murray for this magazine in the context of the gilets jaunes movement. Now we find ourselves in quarantine, I am again struck by Houellebecq’s knack for writing novels that beautifully express something the reader already knows but cannot clearly articulate to themselves. In the case of Serotonin it is this: the trend towards governance of citizens by unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats and experts is a sickness that will cause our social fabric to rot and decay faster than nearly anything else.\n\nSerotonin depicts an armed farmers’ revolt of sorts, the uprising of French milk producers who have had their businesses and economic prospects crushed for the sake of EU price controls.\n\nWe find ourselves now in a comparable situation — different states and jurisdictions have enforced wildly different lockdown regimes, nearly all of which impart arbitrary economic cruelty on those subjected to them with the thinnest of epidemiological justification. How many lives will be crushed by the response to COVID-19? Do any of the nominal experts making these decisions truly care?\n\nCameron Hendy is a writer in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nDay 53: The bookworm’s turn\n\nTaki\n\nThe lockdown has turned me into a bookworm. My friend Michael Mailer, son of Norman, has just finished directing The Boys in the Boat, a film of the wonderful book by Daniel James Brown about the nine American working-class boys rowing for the University of Washington who somehow qualified for the Olympics, beating out powerhouses like Yale, Princeton and Harvard. Better yet, the sons of loggers and farmers then stunned the world by beating out the heavy favorites of Germany and Italy. The emotional heart of the story lies with one of the crew plagued by personal demons and crushing poverty. Reading this book should be a wake up call for Americans to stand up and recover from the Chinese-made and delivered virus.\n\nAndrew Jackson is not so popular these days with virus-averse (she’s too horrible even for the virus to approach) Ocasio-Cortez, but I love and admire him and think he’s probably the greatest of our presidents. Robert Remini’s The Battle of New Orleans turned American history around. It is a gem of a book, short and to the point, and Jackson won a battle against great odds that defined the nation ever since.\n\nTaki has written The Spectator’s High life column since 1977.\n\nDay 52: Galaxy of the Guardianistas\n\nLeaf Arbuthnot\n\nI’ve been mulching about in Tessa Hadley novels since the lockdown bit. Her most recent book, Late in the Day, is a languid tale about two interlocking couples in north London who have to adjust after a bereavement.\n\nI tend to read most before I go to bed and it’s a wrench to put Hadley down when I finally accept I must sleep. There’s a dreaminess to Hadley’s prose that makes me want to read on and on. Her characters are, in the main, middle-class Guardianistas with mortgages and ailing parents, and they meander through their plots with a certain innocence, hurting one another negligently and letting their children down. Dramatic things do happen in Hadley’s books but they are tamped down by the fineness of her writing, which always stops proceedings from becoming lurid.\n\nStart with Late in the Day, then move on to The Past, which reunites a fracturing family for a summer holiday.\n\nLeaf Arbuthnot’s debut novel, Looking for Eliza, is out on May 14.\n\nDay 51: Ears wide open\n\nKatrina Gulliver\n\nDuring the shutdown, I’ve been listening to a lot of audiobooks. They’re fantastic for having on while I get on with other things, or on sunny days simply lying in the garden, eyes closed. The thing with audiobooks is it’s not just the text: the narrator makes or breaks the experience. There are many probably good books I’ve had to give up on because the narrator’s voice was too annoying.\n\nBut when I have found good narrators, I end up following them to other books I wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. The wonderful Gareth Armstrong I first encountered when he narrated John Hooper’s The Italians. I’m now working my way through his narrations of Georges Simenon’s back catalogue: the Inspector Maigret books are great for a lazy afternoon.\n\nI’ve also come to enjoy Kirsten Potter, who narrated the very-of-the-moment Station Eleven. This week I started her recording of Willa Cather’s Lucy Gayheart.\n\nKatrina Gulliver is a historian and a frequent book reviewer for The Spectator.\n\nDay 50: Profits of doom\n\nMary Kate Skehan\n\nPerhaps the government would like a consulting contract with my book club? Way back in February, we presciently chose the pandemic novel Severance by Ling Ma as our April read, long before Cuomo blew his proverbial bugle. I’m not going to say we knew what was coming, but rest assured we aren’t reading The Road next month.\n\nSeverance follows Candace, a wry, detached young woman who has meandered through her mid-twenties in mid-aughts New York City, sort of doing a career, sort of having a relationship, sort of making art. By the time we meet her, though, she’s one of nine known survivors of a virus that came to New York on a cargo ship from China. Improbably, I loved it.\n\nTrigger warnings for certain scenes, if you witnessed the onset of COVID in a metropolis: the HR department that passes out masks, hand sanitizer and friendly hygiene tips just weeks before civilization’s collapse; the gradual departure of Candace’s colleagues from their office, then the city; her walks through the abandoned streets, taking pictures of defunct subway stations, zombie coffee carts and closed storefronts. I, too, enjoy long, wistful walks in the city, pondering disasters both personal and cosmic, and I really vibed with Candace’s canny observations of the crisis, as well as her clear-eyed reflections on the world that existed Before.\n\nSeverance was marketed as a satire when it was published in 2018. Whether it reads that way now, rather than as thriller or allegory or prophecy, probably depends on your experience of corona. Regardless, we can take comfort that Severance did not predict at least some particulars of our own crisis: the COVID mortality rate is thankfully not 100 percent, like the fictional virus; and I hear you can still get take-out coffee in New York.\n\nDay 49: Happy families\n\nMadeleine Kearns\n\nE.B. White’s 1949 essay ‘Here is New York’ discusses a different New York to the one I’ve gotten to know in the past four years. Different restaurants, bars, neighborhoods, etc. But like his prose, the city White paints is also timeless. I left Manhattan over a month ago in the knowledge that it may well be quite different when I return. Is it too soon for nostalgia?\n\nI’m now in leafy Virginia, staying with my friend’s family/sister’s future in-laws. They have an enviable library, a wide collection of Easton Press classics, gorgeous leather-bound books almost too nice to touch. I’m more than halfway through Anna Karenina and agree wholeheartedly with whoever it was that said the opening epigram is the wrong way around. I’ve also been dipping into Paul Johnson’s Modern Times, a tremendous grab bag of the 20th century. The 1990s, I reckon, must have been a great decade in which to live as an adult: ‘the end of history’, and all that. Eager to learn more about history, but unwilling to put the time in, my mum has sent over some of Jonathan Sumption’s Reith Lectures. So far, they have not disappointed.\n\nFor a more spiritual perspective, I’ve been reading An Interrupted Life: The Diaries of Etty Hillesum, 1941-43. Etty (we’re on first-name terms since I’ve intruded on her most intimate thoughts) was a young Dutch Jewish woman, who, age 27, was sent to a Nazi death camp. My friend Olivia, who is 21 years old and living with Stage Four cancer (alone, since she’s highly vulnerable to coronavirus), has been enjoying them too. Over Zoom, we’ve been discussing Etty’s inspirational hope: her interior freedom. ‘Our greatest injury is the one we inflict on ourselves,’ Etty wrote (a sentiment which might have saved Anna Karenina). ‘I find life beautiful and I feel free. The sky within me is as wide as the one stretching above my head. I believe in God and I believe in man, and I say so without embarrassment.’\n\nMadeleine Kearns is the William F. Buckley Jr Fellow at National Review.\n\nDay 48: Master of disaster\n\nW. James Antle III\n\nAs a philistine with little time to read things unrelated to work even during lockdown, I have been exploring the great books of the Western canon. That is, books ostensibly written by Donald Trump. Like binge-watching episodes of The Apprentice, they do give insight into the president’s rhetoric and decision-making. (One thing I noticed about TV Trump — he appeared to be carefully considering the advice of his fellow judges, including his children, and when asking them questions seldom said anything that tipped his hand as to which way he was leaning, but made decisions too fast to have actually incorporated their feedback). A particularly good one is Think Big: Make It Happen in Business Life.\n\nYes, these books are all ghostwritten. But the best ghostwriters capture the nominal author’s voice and many actually write the books based on interviews with them. Think Big does that compellingly, as Trump recounts when he powered through financial calamity through little more than the power of wishful thinking. Sound familiar during the crusade against the coronavirus?\n\nI hope to get to Andy Bacevich’s The Age of Illusions soon enough.\n\nW. James Antle III is politics editor of the Washington Examiner.\n\nDay 47: What can Churchill teach us about China?\n\nGavin Mortimer\n\nEngaged on writing the biography of David Stirling, the founder of the Special Air Service, I’ve been re-reading Winston Churchill’s history of World War Two. Churchill’s son, Randolph, served temporarily with the SAS in 1942, and the British Prime Minister was a fierce supporter of irregular warfare.\n\nBut the first volume of Churchill’s magisterial work has left me uplifted and alarmed. Uplifted because I’m reminded of his lone courage and perspicacity in warning that Britain’s appeasement of Nazi Germany would end badly, and alarmed because it appears that the country is in danger of committing the same grave mistake with another totalitarian regime. ‘Hitler’s aggressive policy and treaty-breaking had rested, not upon Germany’s strength, but upon the disunion and timidity of France and Britain and the isolation of the United States,’ wrote Churchill. ‘His opponents were too irresolute to call his bluff.’\n\nSubstitute ‘Hitler’ and ‘Germany’ for ‘Xi Jinping’ and ‘China’ and that sentence rings true today. Britain, in particular, has been so naive in its appeasement of the Chinese Communist party in recent years that we are on the brink of allowing Huawei a role in our 5G mobile phone networks.\n\nGerman troops marched into Austria on March 12, 1938, and as Churchill recounts, he warned Parliament two days later: ‘Europe is confronted with a programme of aggression, nicely calculated and timed, unfolding stage by stage… If we go on waiting upon events, how much shall we throw away of resources now available for our security and the maintenance of peace? How many friends will be alienated, how many potential allies shall we see go one by one down the grisly gulf?’\n\nThis week in the South China Sea the Chinese navy has been aggressively pursuing its claims, seeking to exploit the chaos in the West caused by coronavirus with a calculated display of force. As Hitler did in the 1930s, Xi Jinping understands that Europe and America is weak and divided.\n\nFirm and honest leadership is urgently required and whatever the faults of Donald Trump he has from the outset identified China as the West’s biggest threat. Boris Johnson, the man who claims Churchill as his hero, seems as blinded to Chinese ambition as his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron.\n\nJohnson needs to dip into his hero’s history of World War Two to better understand the mind of dictators or else he could go down in history as not a Churchill, but a Chamberlain.\n\nDay 46: Wyndham’s world\n\nBrendan O’Neill\n\nIt’s a crime that John Wyndham isn’t a household name. Nonetheless, he casts an extraordinary shadow over modern culture. Every catastrophe movie owes him a debt. You can see and hear him in much of Spielberg’s work. And he was a huge influence on arguably the most zeitgeisty author of our era: Margaret Atwood. We might not use the word Wyndhamian, but we live in Wyndhamian times.\n\nThe COVID crisis — by which I don’t just mean the virus itself but also our societies’ deranged, authoritarian response to it — drew me back to Wyndham’s best-known work, The Day of the Triffids. Hopefully Americans won’t have the same response to that book’s name as many Brits do: it makes us think of the rather camp, naff mini-series the BBC made of it the 1980s.\n\nIt’s a uniquely haunting novel. What strikes many people when they first read it is that the infamous walking, carnivorous plants of the title don’t feature all that much. It’s mostly about survival in a world rendered apocalyptic by a weird meteor shower that makes most of humanity go blind. Walking around deserted London now, in which many have had their senses of smell and taste, though mercifully not their sight, obliterated by an unwanted visitor, I think often of the book’s opening line: ‘When a day that you happen to know is Wednesday starts off by sounding like Sunday, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.’ Every day sounds like Sunday now.\n\nFor uplift, delve into G.K. Chesterton’s 1914 novel The Flying Inn. It tells of a future England in which the ruling elite has given into Islam — controversial! — and outlawed all pubs. So two blokes ramble round the country in a cart selling rum to a booze-desperate populace. Anyone up for doing something similar in our currently pub-less countries? Or treat yourself to the greatest autobiography ever written: Memoirs of a Revolutionary by Victor Serge. ‘One must range oneself actively against everything that diminishes man, and involve oneself in all struggles which tend to liberate and enlarge him’, Serge wrote. Words to live by in the lockdown, and after it.\n\nBrendan O’Neill is editor of spiked.\n\nDay 45: Writer to the point\n\nMatt McDonald\n\nFor a journalist, there are few better omens than when your boss gives you a book to teach you how to write good.\n\nThat’s what my editor Freddy Gray did in February, lending me his copy of Write to the Point by our colleague Sam Leith. Finding myself pinned in my Brooklyn apartment for weeks on end gave me the excuse I needed to start it — and I’m so glad I did.\n\nSam Leith speaks my language. I don’t just mean this in the sense that the conversational British English he writes in makes his writing guide very accessible; his chosen example to demonstrate the future perfect tense is ‘By closing time, I will have drunk about a gallon of Strongbow and will very much need a wee.’ This is exactly how I would be spending my time if bars were still open.\n\nThe tips in this book are a must-read for any developing writer. He perfectly captures why use of the impersonal pronoun ‘one’ sits so uncomfortably: it sounds ‘rather affectedly aristocratic’. He also describes how pomposity ‘tells your audience that you have an unduly high opinion of yourself (though a more confident audience might diagnose the opposite: that you’re writing pompously because you’re nervous)’.\n\nAnd ‘making your audience laugh is a way of hot-wiring their goodwill’ is a line I’ve adopted as an unofficial mantra. I’m considering making it my first tattoo, even if I have to drive to Georgia to get it.\n\nI wish I’d read this when I was 18, rather than now I’m 28. I just posted this copy to another colleague — but you should get your own.\n\nMatt McDonald is the managing editor of Spectator USA.\n\nDay 44: Flashman revisited\n\nPeter Hitchens\n\nThis is not a good time for reading. In my Oxford suburb I can clearly hear, in the small hours, the dismal groaning and threshing sounds of the British economy suffering an officially-imposed heart attack. It keeps me from Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad, which I want to read but which is so unbearably grim that it is the last thing I need just now.\n\nI have instead fended off the night with re-reading. George Macdonald Fraser’s original Flashman books — Flashman itself, Royal Flash and Flashman at the Charge, are all based on the brilliant conceit that the fictional bully of Tom Brown’s School Days was in fact a real person, a cruel, immoral, lecherous poltroon with the Devil’s own luck, caught up in all the best historical melodramas of the 19th century. The early books remain works of genius, funny, sparely written, bitter, merciless, fast-moving and always intelligent. Those who have not read them should do so. Those who have should read them again. The world recedes as you turn the pages.\n\nI have also re-read, in the original unaltered 1945 version, Brideshead Revisited. While looking out for differences from the later revised text (they are few but important) I read the book more thoroughly than ever before. I must have read it 20 times, but Evelyn Waugh’s writing is so intricate and unwasteful that there is always more to find. There are some passages which, however many times I read them, almost cause me to cry out, especially the repeated blow on the bruise , and the moment when the incessant shouting voices cease. The only book I have come to afresh in this odd time is from Ann Patchett’s neglected backlist, a small jewel called Taft which really ought to be easier to find. Find it anyway.\n\nDay 43: Roman across the shelves\n\nDavid Bahr\n\nIt’s hard to concentrate these days. Two screaming toddlers at home, a wife screaming wife-things, and my genuine concern about our economic future has combined into a large mental roadblock on any path toward finishing a book.\n\nWhat this looks like practically is that I pick up one text only to discard it after a day or an hour or a few minutes. I tried comedy, but found Wodehouse too light for my mood. I thought Nietzsche’s Untimely Mediations might be a nice project, but had to stop after two weeks. (Who serious really gives a damn about Nietzsche at a time like this?) It occurred that self-harm might offer some release, so I dusted off some Jane Austen. I just kept it at dusting, though. I was never really going to re-open her work. V.S. Naipaul’s short stories were presented to me by a friend. I’ll give him a go one day, but not now. Magazines — except for The Spectator and the Claremont Review of Books, of course — don’t do it for me for longer than a few articles a sitting.\n\nSo happy day indeed when I found my old Dryden edition of Plutarch’s Lives. I started out of order, and since I was in a weird mood, began with my favorite weirdo, Alcibiades. Plutarch’s manner of writing in the Lives is captivating. Part-gossip, part-history, part-political philosophy, there is something for everyone, and so something for whatever side of my mood takes over.\n\nAfter Alcibiades I decided to set a challenge and work through the book straight. I spend each evening with another character, forgetting, if only for an hour or so, the distractions of the here and now. I’m now on the life of Poplicola. Hopefully I can keep this up. If not, I’ll just look at the pictures in People.\n\nP.S. If there are any other Plutarch lovers out there, drop me a line.\n\nDavid Bahr is managing editor of the American Mind.\n\nDay 42: Escape into oligarchy\n\nJosh Kaplan\n\nIn these times of great uncertainty, I’m sure many will be reaching for escapist novels or books that transport them out of their current reality. I find it more comforting to lean into the feeling of chaos and read books that paint a picture of societies in decline. The double header of The Unwinding: an Inner History of the New America by George Packer and Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible by Peter Pomerantsev fit that bill nicely.\n\nThe former, a richly reported history of four decades of American decline, is told through the eyes of a factory worker in Youngstown, an entrepreneur from the Tobacco belt and a young Democratic activist. Packer explores the forces behind the subprime mortgage crisis, the decline of Midwest manufacturing and the influence of money on US politics through beautiful vignettes and stories of how some of America’s most famous names started out.\n\nOn the other side of the coin is Pomerantsev’s look at the insidious world of Russian oligarchs and misinformation. Having started his career in Russian reality TV, Pomerantsev describes how reality is constructed and controlled through the nation’s TV screens. Writing that TV is ‘the central mechanism of a new type of authoritarianism’, his work too focuses on outliers in Putin’s Russia; he rarely mentions the Supreme Leader by name, opting instead to drop a breadcrumb trail that leads the reader to wonder if there’s anything Putin doesn’t control.\n\nBut when dark tales of sinister global capital are too bleak, there’s always the warm, comforting embrace of Nora Ephron. The true voice of sardonic Jewish culture, Ephron’s novels and personal essays hold up incredibly well to the test of time. Peppered with recipes that everyone now has time to cook, Ephron’s first novel Heartburn is a biting, deeply witty story about how to go on when the world feels like it’s closing in on you — a warm bath for the soul to soak in.\n\nJosh Kaplan is the social audience manager at Joe.co.uk and a Spectator USA contributor.\n\nDay 41: Lockdown rock\n\nLuke Haines\n\nI, Fatty:A Novel by Jerry Stahl is your burn-through biography. Stahl has ‘lived’ a bit, so is the perfect conduit to tell the tragic tale of silent movie auteur Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle. Narrated in the first person, Fatty wiseguy’s his way through his own life. From a bleak, dust-poor childhood where he got a starring role as his papa’s punchbag: from the carny to silver screen stardom. Fatty’s most famous role was as a junked-out, impotent rapist killer, but that was off-screen. He was found to be not guilty, but by then he was toast. We also learn that Buster Keaton was a major dude and a genius, and that Fatty’s only crime was getting railroaded by the ‘mean’ girls. Johnny Depp loves this book. Don’t let that put you off.\n\nDead Fashion Girl — A Situationist Detective Story by Fred Vermorel is an epic, scrupulously researched, true-life unsolved murder mystery, concerning the 1954 strangulation of fashion designer Jean Townsend. Fred — an art school pal of Malcolm McLaren and confidante of the Sex Pistols inner circle — spends a lot of time visiting care homes and talking to nearly dead survivors of London’s creepy post-war vice scene. If you like this sort of thing (I do), then this is the book for you. 1950s Soho was a cess pit.\n\nStaying in 1950s London I point you in the direction of Fear And Loathing In Fitzrovia, Paul Willett’s biography of the great Soho writer and roué Julian MacLaren-Ross. MacLaren-Ross follows in the fine tradition of Brits who are seen to have wasted their talent (patron saint, Peter Cook). Of course, ‘wasting’ one’s talent is a supreme talent in itself. Writers! Marvel at MacLaren-Ross’s uncanny ability to squeeze an advance out of any hapless publisher, squander it on a new coat, then vanish. Drinkers! If during this enforced lockdown you are missing your favorite bar or speakeasy, then read this book. You’ll be on the wagon before you are halfway through.\n\nLuke Haines is a singer and songwriter, and The Spectator’s rock critic.\n\nDay 40: Churchill revisited\n\nZack Christenson\n\nOn the advice of a friend (advice in this case meaning she ordered me the book and wouldn’t stop inquiring about it), I’m reading Brideshead Revisited. I am perhaps the only Spectator staff member to have not read Waugh’s classic. The book, for the uninitiated, takes place in early 20th century England among the upper crust of society and spans approximately 20-some years up to World War Two.\n\nBrideshead makes for great lockdown reading, with its descriptions of the fantastic meals, banquets, parties and European travel that currently eludes us. The plot is also quite good, but I won’t bore you with the details. It also includes at least 200 percent more gay relationships than I had anticipated in a book published in London in 1945, which according to the same friend shows my blind spot towards mid-20th century British literature. The two books in line after this are Submission, by Michel Houellebecq, and The Mandibles, Lionel Shriver’s latest. Moving from the decadence of the 20th century to dystopian novels set in the near future seems appropriate. Perhaps I’ll make another entry and let you know how they are.\n\nFor those looking for something lighter yet still literary, I might recommend diving into classic spy novels. The spy novelists writing between the 1960s and the 1990s wrote fantastically cerebral thrillers: nothing like the stuff you find in airport bookstores today. I recently discovered Len Deighton, a writer you should check out if you think le Carré’s books are a little over the top. I ‘discovered’ Deighton by stumbling upon a paperback of Twinkle Twinkle Little Spy in a seconds bin outside Shakespeare and Co. in Paris, and read it as I traveled in Morocco. That’s obviously irrelevant to the book recommendation. I’m only mentioning it as a tease.\n\nI often recommend to Americans Boris Johnson’s biography of Churchill, The Churchill Factor, both as a light and quick biography but also an introduction to Johnson. No question the entire book was a branding exercise, Johnson’s attempt to make the case for himself as the heir to Churchill’s legacy. It doesn’t matter: it’s still well done. Johnson explains the nuances of what made Churchill great, such as the rhetorical and oratorical tricks he used to make himself sound grand and wise. It might make you feel better that it took Churchill years of practice to become Churchill.\n\nLastly, I always recommend Barbarians at the Gate to anyone with even a faint interest in business. This book essentially invented the genre of non-fiction narrative business storytelling that paved the way for the books by Michael Lewis and others. It’s the story of the attempted takeover of RJR Nabisco by competing private equity firms in the late 1980s, the decade that would end up being the last gasp of the era of corporate raiders. If that sounds boring, I promise you it’s not. You become a fly on the wall to the excesses of Wall Street in the 1980s. If you think the world of corporate finance and big business is crazy now, this book might provide some perspective.\n\nZack Christenson is the publisher of The Spectator’s US edition.\n\nDay 39: Lowlives\n\nIan Thomson\n\nI was going to suggest Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year, but thought better of it because what we need now, more than ever, is a dose of light entertainment. Alexander Baron’s comico-serious novel The Lowlife, first published in the UK in 1963, concerns the antics of Harryboy Boas (‘two syllables, please’), an inveterate gambler and Stoke Newington man-about-town. The novel, with its street-savvy Yiddish wit and wisdom, is what Harryboy would have wished: a winner. Harry H. Corbett of Steptoe and Son (adapted for the US as Sanford and Son) fame was due to play Harryboy in a film of the book, but, sadly, it was never made. The Lowlife has something of the dark cockney menace of Harold Pinter; and, strikingly, it was one of the first British novels to incorporate Caribbean immigrants as characters. COVID-19: oy-yoy-yoy!\n\nDay 38: All in good taste\n\nMarlo Safi\n\nIf you’d like something prosaic, irreverent and appealing to the gustatory senses, Anthony Bourdain’s A Cook’s Tour is a delightful book that’ll leave you wistful for the late chef.\n\nI recently read Debating China: The US-China Relationship In Ten Conversations which could help anyone trying to catch up that tumultuous relationship today, although the book is a few years old and doesn’t account for the Trump administration. For something heavier, I highly recommend Christopher Lasch’s Women and the Common Life: Love, Marriage, and Feminism. In that same vein, Camille Paglia’s Sex, Art, and American Culture: Essays is provocative and perennial.\n\nFor those looking for a lighter read, The Best American Food Writing 2018 and 2019 editions are collections of well-reported essays from numerous American publications — since they’re organized as individual essays, it’s a book that’s easy to pick up and pace yourself with, and it also presents food writing as a one of the most exciting fields within journalism.\n\nMarlo Safi writes on food and drink for The Spectator and is a culture writer for the Daily Caller.\n\nDay 37: Viktor Frankl’s search for meaning\n\nCarolyn Stewart\n\nWe don’t need escapist reads right now. We need inoculation against the hardships to come. Who better to teach us about resiliency than a psychiatrist who survived Nazi concentration camps before founding a school of therapy on the meaning of life?\n\nTo kick off quarantine, I picked up Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning. During the height of the war, the Austrian doctor rejected an American visa to stay with his aging parents in Vienna, until they all were deported to concentration camps. He spent three hellish years in Auschwitz, Dachau, Theresienstadt and Kaufering, ultimately losing all members of his family save one.\n\nFrankl’s experiences, as difficult as they are to read, provide consoling proof of man’s resiliency. In the camps, a slice of bread becomes an indescribable luxury. A pile of bodies in a tent becomes Frankl’s treasured spot where he can rest for a moment and look out at the Bavarian countryside. He bears witness, in his own words, to the truth that ‘man is capable of defying and braving even the worst conditions conceivable’.\n\nThe soul is resilient and fights for self-preservation in a number of ways: humor, beauty, memories of loved ones, plans for the future. This is what interests Frankl. The second half of his memoir is devoted to how we find meaning in life, which as he sees it, is through embracing the idea that we are challenged by life, daily and hourly. The meaning of life is to rise to the challenge and persevere.\n\nIn our current moment, life challenges us to stay indoors, near our panic-stocked kitchen and finish Tiger King on Netflix. All of a sudden, life’s pretty good.\n\nCarolyn Stewart is the publications director of the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC.\n\nDay 36: Trollope in space\n\nToby Young\n\nI’ve just read Cold Storage by David Koepp, about a deadly fungus that escapes from a decommissioned bioweapons storage facility. It charts the efforts of a group of unlikely heroes to contain the outbreak. It’s very entertaining in an action-movie way, full of suspense, shoot-outs and explosions. Admittedly, I read it about two months ago, before we knew how serious COVID-19 was going to be, so it’s possible I might not enjoy it as much today.\n\nIf you like science fiction, but don’t want anything too close to the bone, I can recommend the Destroyermen series by Taylor Anderson, which is about a World War Two destroyer that passes through a portal in the space-time continuum and plunges its crew into an alternate universe in which highly-evolved lemurs and lizards are engaged in an epic struggle for control of the earth’s resources. It sounds rather lowbrow, and I suppose it is, but the characters are very well-drawn and every inch of the canvas is filled in. The author is a gun buff so there’s lots of detail about ordinance, if you like that sort of thing, which I do. Highly recommended — and there are 14 of them in total so they should keep you busy.\n\nI’m currently reading The Warden by Anthony Trollope, having read the Palliser novels last year. The great thing about the Palliser novels and the Barchester Chronicles is that you can get the audio versions by Timothy West, which are absolutely sublime. If you actually get the virus, and find reading a struggle, you can always lie in bed listening to them.\n\nToby Young is associate editor of The Spectator.\n\nDay 35: Indian ink\n\nKapil Komireddi\n\nThe first five pages of Douglas Murray’s The Madness of Crowds seemed deathly boring. This, I said to myself, truly is a dreadful book. I turned to page six and couldn’t put the book down. Murray is one of those writers I hadn’t properly read but whose opinions culture had distilled and deposited in my consciousness. I had been dissuaded from reading his books by enlightened acquaintances with powerful views on tolerance. Then recently, one of my oldest and most literate friend, an editor at Murray’s publisher, pressed the book into my hand as a Christmas present and asked me to read it. It was a mistral of fresh air.\n\nMurray is gay — a disclosure that grabbed me only because of his unwillingness on the page to advance mitigations for the politics of personal destruction pursued by influential pockets of the gay community. He brings that honesty, that sharpness of vision, to every issue that the mob decrees should be beyond discussion. He has the courage to defend human beings whom others have abandoned out of fear because he is animated by principles that are worth defending. I did not agree with everything Murray wrote. But I knew that I was reading someone who cherished civilization — and was determined to safeguard it from the passions of the mob. What Waugh said of Kipling is true also of Murray in this instance: ‘He believed civilization to be something laboriously achieved but only precariously defended. He wanted to see the defenses fully manned.’ Crowds madden. Crowds kill. Crowds undo civilizations. This period of enforced solitude might be the perfect occasion to read The Madness of Crowds.\n\nThe Twittering Machine by Richard Seymour advances similar warnings on the dangers of the mob — and on the destructive potential of technology — but from a political perspective that could not be more different from Murray’s. I have been reading Seymour for many years and I have found him, even when I have disagreed with him, to be illuminating. He is the closest thing to an Indian Marxist Britain has. The Twittering Machine is a wonderful antidote to the delusion that social media is liberating. This protracted bout of self-isolation, when our dependency on those platforms will intensify, might be a good time to read it.\n\nPatrick McGuinness’s The Last Hundred Days, about the dying days of Ceausescu’s regime in Romania, is the best work of historical fiction I read this decade. I recommend it to everyone. A poet of extraordinary talent, McGuinness conjures up a totalitarian dystopia in breathtakingly beautiful prose.\n\nI was deterred from reading Keshava Guha’s Accidental Magic by the publicity surrounding it, which sold it as a book for ‘Potterheads’. I set aside my prejudices to dip into it. It’s an exceptionally brilliant, and brilliantly intricate, debut novel about Bostonians and Bangaloreans by a tremendously talented young writer.\n\nRaj Kamal Jha’s The City and the Sea is the most poignant novel I read last year. It’s a work of extraordinary empathy that reaffirms the role of a writer in society.\n\nFor those with an interest in India, may I recommend Tripurdaman Singh’s Sixteen Stormy Days, a riveting, blow-by-blow account of the first amendment to constitution of the world’s largest democracy. Aatish Taseer’s The Twice-Born: Life and Death on the Ganges is one of the more poignant tributes to India. Taseer is a writer I admire immensely. His devotion to his craft is exceeded only by his love for India and its past. So naturally, the benighted regime that now governs India revoked his overseas citizenship. The book I’m most eagerly awaiting is David Frum’s Trumpocalypse: Restoring American Democracy.\n\nKapil Komireddi is a Spectator contributor and the author of Malevolent Republic: A Short History of the New India.\n\nDay 34: Gray wigs and gray cells\n\nCraig Bruce Smith\n\nWith news and talk of COVID-19 virtually everywhere, the past is the only place left untouched by this pandemic. With the United States facing an uncertain national crisis that has left many questioning the role of American government, liberty and citizenship, let’s consider the first time it happened: the American Revolution.\n\nFor a compelling story on the American Revolution that reads like a novel and are destined to be feature films start with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David Hackett Fischer’s Paul Revere’s Ride and Washington’s Crossing. (Russell Crowe for Revere and Hugh Jackman for Washington, anyone?)\n\nPaul Revere’s Ride follows the famed members of the Sons of Liberty, silversmith, and ‘Midnight Rider’ Paul Revere, but it’s so much more. It tells the story of a military occupied Boston with all the drama and intrigue that went into the start of the Revolutionary War. It busts the myth of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s ‘The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere’, and offers compelling theories on a well-placed spy and who really fired the first shot of the war.\n\nWashington’s Crossing, perhaps the best book on George Washington period, brings to life one of the most iconic moments in American history. It follows the Continental Army from their crushing defeat in New York to the triumphant Christmas crossing of the Delaware and victories New Jersey campaign.\n\nFor two books that help define how the Revolution transformed America, look no further than the Bernard Bailyn’s classic Ideological Origins of the American Revolution and the Good Will Hunting-famed Gordon Wood and his masterpiece Radicalism of the American Revolution. (If you want a Revolution book right on the nose, try Elizabeth Fenn’s Pox Americana: The Great Smallpox Epidemic of 1775-82.)\n\nBut since we’re all essentially locked inside, who better to read than the Queen of Crime and master of the locked-room murder Agatha Christie. Her incomparable sleuth, the mustachioed Belgian Monsieur Hercule Poirot, known for his ‘little gray cells’, is certainly at the top of the heap of all-literary detectives. Murder on the Orient Express is the best-known (and features a locked train compartment), but for true locked room novels try The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Cards on the Table and Murder in Mesopotamia.\n\nFor history mixed with mystery, it’s Louise Penny’s Bury Your Dead (part of the Inspector Gamache series, read them all) featuring Samuel de Champlain and a modern Québec City. For supernatural histories starring vampires (and witches), Elizabeth Kostova’s The Historian and historian and novelist Deborah Harkness’s All Souls Trilogy are not to be missed.\n\nCraig Bruce Smith is a historian and the author of American Honor: The Creation of the Nation’s Ideals during the Revolutionary Era.\n\nDay 33: What the Dickens\n\nAmber Athey\n\nMy time spent reading as an adult has mostly centered on making my way through the classics I may have missed from my middle and high school reading lists. The latest book I’ve been working on is Charles Dickens’s first novel, The Pickwick Papers. It’s actually a perfect piece of literature for our current moment, as the stories of the idiosyncratic Pickwickians eating, drinking, and sporting their way around the country through a series of delightful mishaps will help fill the social void left by quarantine.\n\nAnyone looking for a healthier alternative to the smash Netflix series Tiger King should consider picking up Tea Obreht’s The Tiger’s Wife. I was forced to read this before my freshman year at Georgetown and automatically despised the book as a side effect of being assigned a summer project. However, I revisited it a few years later and realized how much I had missed the first time around. It’s a spirited tale exploring family, death, and mythology in a fictional province in the Balkans. I found myself lost in the rich stories Natalia, the protagonist, tells about her grandfather’s life as she comes to terms with his death.\n\nDay 32: Albion’s seed\n\nPriscilla M. Jensen\n\nIn this time of plague, I’ve found myself holding forth to my contemporaries about accepting that we are geezers, with a sprinkling of crones. I picked up my trusty Albion’s Seed, by David Hackett Fischer, his eye-opening study of ‘four British folkways in America’, to have a look at the sections on age as apprehended in the cultures of Puritan New England, Anglican/cavalier Virginia, Quaker Delaware, and the one I know of first-hand, the hard-headed borderers who came from the Scottish marches to Appalachia and ain’t given up yet.\n\nIn each regional case, the story is much as one might expect, but rather more interesting. In New England, the aged were looked upon as the favored of God — why else would they have outlived so many? In a culture which saw His hand daily at work, survival to the age at which one might be regarded as what Fischer calls an ‘elder-saint’, was so much venerated that early on in life people began to round up their actual ages — ‘age-heap’ — to appear a bit older. Age, one might say, served as a sort of synecdoche of Providential benediction. Virginia tradition is familiar to Americans, and to The Spectator’s UK cousins, as a patriarchal analogue of the divine right of kings, in which deference rather than veneration is owed to the elder and awareness of the bareness of one’s chin daunting in company.\n\nOlder persons in the Quaker culture of the Delaware valley were looked to as guides or teachers, to the extent that ‘to elder someone’ meant to admonish him, to scold, or correct. And in the backcountry, in the hills where the Scots-Irish headed from Ulster, the very ancient echoes of tanistry, says Fischer, accorded considerable power to the accomplished and powerful aged, while relegating their less impressive contemporaries to the inglenook or the road.\n\nWays of understanding, dealing with, age are not, of course the only folkways Fischer describes in this magisterial yet deeply entertaining work. (For decades it’s been my family’s — my parents’ and now my — gift to any foreign visitor with enough English to puzzle it out.) He explores, in each of the geographic areas, ways of looking at elites, gender ways, courtship and marriage, work and learning, magic and religion, speech and naming, aging and death. One of my favorites has to do with language and naming habits — I’m happy to onomasticate my way through anthropological records of all sorts, and these are familiar and revelatory at the same time.\n\nAlbion’s Seed rewards both deep reading and browsing; I’ve been messing around with it for several decades now and appreciate it more every time I pick it up. Indispensable for the American bookshelf.\n\nPriscilla M. Jensen is The Spectator’s copy editor.\n\nDay 31: Heroes behind bars\n\nAndrew Stuttaford\n\nAn essential for those now compelled or ‘advised’ to hunker down at home are books that act as a reminder that, however irritating this may be, it beats, well, actual imprisonment. A novel or two with a hero behind bars but (don’t overdo the gloom) emerging triumphant ought to be on anyone’s social isolation list: Alexandre Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo might be one, but there are, of course, countless others.\n\nXavier de Maistre went through a considerably less trying period than the unfortunate Edmond Dantès, when, in 1790, he was confined to his room in Turin for 42 days for taking part in a duel, an experience that he turned into his remarkable A Journey Around My Room a few years later. Whimsical, discursive, and with more than echo of Lawrence Sterne about it, de Maistre’s sprawling novella (that’s not the contradiction it seems) is a masterclass in making the best of a mildly uncomfortable situation (in his case, made even milder by the presence of an obliging servant and a faithful dog). A journey around a room is, de Maistre points out, cheap, safe for the sick, comforting for the cowardly, attractive to the indolent, and a healthy alternative for those of ‘you whose minds are brooding over sinister plans to reform your way of life’. Join him on his journey as he gets up from his armchair and, ‘walking towards the north’, there comes into view of his bed ‘a most agreeable sight’.\n\nInterior, which its author, Thomas Clerc, describes as an ‘over-inflated recreation’ of A Journey Around My Room, broadens things out a bit. Clerc dedicates over three hundred pages to not just a single room, but a whole apartment — if not a very large one. Like de Maistre, Clerc uses his journey as the basis for digression, discussion and observation while adding a fine collection of aphorisms and some good jokes into the mix. He also focuses much more attention on what’s in his ‘sanctuary’, some might say obsessively so: The description of his desk and its contents (‘the left side is the empire of the archive’) spills over more than a dozen pages. Then again, as Clerc notes, his previous book ‘was devoted to annotating every street in Paris’s 10ème Arrondisement’. There are moments, however, when one begins to wonder if the poor man has not spent just a little too much time indoors. A bottle ‘gorgeously sheathed in brown wicker…brings to mind a woman tied up with rope for some erotic game’. There’s a warning there, I feel, for us all.\n\nAndrew Stuttaford is a contributing editor at National Review.\n\nDay 30: The land of Lawrence Durrell\n\nRichard Pine\n\nHere in Corfu, Greece, we have almost total shutdown. The one major hit to existence is the loss of the café, the focus, in city as in village, of gossip, information, argument and saving the planet — or at least the Greek part of it. In the absence of this pivot of social life, universal dismay is as prevalent as the Covid-19 virus. You can hear the silence.\n\nI shall avail of the time afforded by this enforced privacy, to read through the entire fiction of Lawrence Durrell, from his earliest Pied Piper of Lovers (1935) to the closing volume of The Avignon Quintet (1985), to gear myself for a new edition of my Lawrence Durrell: the Mindscape.\n\nNot everyone’s cup of tea? Well, let me recommend the short stories of Alexandros Papadiamantis (1851-1911), one of the fathers of modern Greek fiction. Papadiamantis, from the island of Skiathos, lived in Athens, working as a translator, but commuted in his mind between the city and his island birthplace. His stories are intensely local, visceral, feral, passionate and compassionate. Publisher Denise Harvey, based in Evia, Greece, produced the first of a projected three-volume collection under the title The Boundless Garden in 2007; the second volume has just appeared. These stories can be compared with the stories of Liam O’Flaherty (1896-1984), from the western Irish island of Inishmore. O’Flaherty’s stories are also available in a three-volume collection, published by Wolfhound Press. Like Papadiamantis’s insights, they portray the loves, fears, anxieties and fierce realities of primeval island life. If the two men had met, they would have understood each other intimately.\n\nRichard Pine directs the Durrell Library of Corfu and edits the journal C20.\n\nDay 29: Consolations of philosophy\n\nEmina Melonic\n\nIf you’ve never read any books by Iris Murdoch, then do yourself a favor and begin with her 1958 novel, The Bell. Like most of Murdoch’s books, it is full of strange characters that are seeking some kind of salvation, whether religious, sexual, or even philosophical. It takes place near Imber Abbey, which is surrounded by a community of eccentrics who do not see themselves as such, and they all have something to hide. A new bell is about to installed in the Abbey when, suddenly, the old, long-lost bell is recovered. This is the catalyst that opens up different paths for all of the relationships in the book, especially those dominated by sexual obsessions. Deeply erotic and steeped into the paradoxes of sex and religion, The Bell is one of Murdoch’s best books that takes the reader on a journey through the joys and absurdities of love.\n\nGiven the fact that there is indeed so much ugliness in the world today, we should seek more beautiful things that uplift the human spirit as well as ask what does it mean to be human? This is exactly the gift you will receive if you read Roger Scruton’s Beauty, in which he awakens the mind to art, but also trains the mind to make proper aesthetic judgments. Scruton has a wonderful gift in writing about aesthetics in an approachable manner, and here too, he wants us to dig deeper into what the nature of beauty really is. Is it subjective? Can it be judged? Can we say that something is not art? In all of these beautiful musings, Scruton offers philosophical and aesthetic nourishment, an oasis from the paint splatters brought on by the cult of ugliness.\n\nMilan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being takes place during the 1960s and 1970s in Prague during the Communist regime. Like most of Kundera’s novels, this too is philosophical in nature and its aim is to reflect on the meaning of sex and love in the times of totalitarianism. It mainly follows the womanizing escapades of a surgeon, Tomáš. Who will he choose? His wife? His mistress? How can they all make sense of relationships and the existential burdens that are placed on human beings during times of utter absurdity and evil? Despite some of its underlying political themes, Kundera’s novel is an aesthetic experience of the tragic, erotic, and the absurd.\n\nEmina Melonic is a critic and wrote most recently for The Spectator on Ross Douthat’s The Decadent Society.\n\nDay 28: ‘Two popes and now a plague!’\n\nEric Nelson\n\nA friend exclaimed the other day, ‘Gosh, two popes at the same time and now a plague! It’s the 14th century again!’ Very much in that spirit, I’ve been happily rereading the Decameron in quarantine. For those who may not have had the pleasure, this masterpiece by Boccaccio is set during the outbreak of the Black Death in Florence in 1348. To escape the pestilence, a group of seven women and three men retreat to the hills above the city, where, to keep themselves amused, they agree that each will tell one story per day (with days off for chores, Good Friday, and the odd fast). The result is, that after 10 days of storytelling distributed over two weeks, they have told one hundred bawdy, scandalously anti-clerical, hilarious, and ultimately redemptive tales. My practice has been to keep to the schedule of the characters themselves, so I read 10 stories each day — which means, alas, that I’ll be out of stories even before I run out of hand sanitizer.\n\nA particularly striking feature of the text is the typology of reactions to the plague that Boccaccio sketches in the introduction. There were those, he explains, who believed that a ‘sober and abstemious form of life’ would protect them and so ‘lived in isolation from everyone else’. On the other hand, there were those who ignored the peril, gratifying all their cravings for drink and debauchery, and shrugging the whole thing off ‘as one enormous joke’. One thinks of the spring breakers in Miami Beach. Last, Boccaccio adds, there were those who attempted to steer ‘a middle course’, which is of course our challenge as well.\n\nEric Nelson is a professor of political science at Harvard.

Ballard, two wonderfully leftfield British authors who remain under-read and under-appreciated, especially in the US. Self-isolation should give you enough time for Farrell’s ‘Empire trilogy’, his tragi-comic take on the political and human foibles of British colonial rule.\n\nThe plot of Troubles centers around the once grand but now dilapidated Majestic Hotel surrounded by the political upheaval of the 1919-1921 Irish War of Independence. Guffaw-out-loud humor and pathos occupy almost every page.\n\nThe Siege of Krishnapur recounts the 1857 Indian Mutiny siege of a fictional Indian town from the perspective of the eccentric British residents. Farrell wittily nails the strange alchemy of absurdity, idiocy, courage and British pluck that permeated the British colonial adventure.\n\nThe Singapore Grip — the title derives from a fabled sexual technique practiced by local prostitutes — deals with the fallout of the World War Two Japanese occupation of Singapore for a British family running one of the colony’s leading trading companies: ‘when you staggered outside into the sweltering night, you would have been able to inhale that incomparable smell of incense, of warm skin, of meat cooking in coconut oil, of money and frangipani, and hair-oil and lust and sandalwood and heaven knows what, a perfume like the breath of life itself’. Reading that line lifts me every time.\n\nMy challenge to you: read all three books and decide on your favorite. You can while away hours of self-isolation arguing about it. Put a gun against my head, I’d go for The Singapore Grip.\n\nWith J.G Ballard you are guaranteed a feisty, compelling and smolderingly sensual experience. This is exemplified by the likes of Cocaine Nights and Super Cannes about the dark secrets of dystopian resort and gated communities chasing the next sordid high. The only problem if you are self-isolating celibately is the steamier sections will likely leave you feeling thoroughly vexed and in need of a cold shower or a quick batch of 30 press-ups to take the edge off.\n\nBallard’s semi-autobiographical Empire of the Sun and its sequel The Kindness of Women draw on his teenage years spent in a Japanese internment camp after the fall of Shanghai. Both offer searing candor and wisdom about the human condition that is all too relevant given our current COVID-19 predicament. His prison camp experience inspired a life-long obsession with civil society’s fragile veneer and how easily it can shatter — a timely theme again, unfortunately — explored in the likes of High-Rise and Millennium People. His science-fiction novels and short story collections — written in the elegant literary New Wave style of the 1960s and 1970s — offer a perfect escape from the oppressive realities of society’s current veneer being tested. Ballard would tell us he told us so.\n\nDay 26: Dr Johnson, we presume?\n\nPhilip Hensher\n\nThere’s no better book to lose yourself in than James Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. The huge cast wanders in and out, bouncing off the humane, bizarre or profound conversation of its subject. Boswell had a genius for bringing not just individual humans to life, but cats (poor old Hodge, threatened with being shot by hooligans) and, in the end, a whole society. Well-read, heavy-drinking, witty, confident London society of the 18th century leaps from the wry, ironic, forgiving pages. You don’t have to read it from beginning to end — any 20 pages are a delight — but it has a cumulative power like nothing else\n\nPhilip Hensher is a novelist and the London Spectator’s lead fiction critic.\n\nDay 25: Splendid isolation with Anna\n\nPaul Wood\n\nWe were in France when the coronavirus hit and a generous (and very wealthy) friend allowed me to use one of his homes, an impossibly beautiful 18th century château near Avignon. It was easy to quarantine ourselves because the château stood in splendid isolation in acres of grounds. On the first day there, I could see a number of gardeners in the distance, before they disappeared following the edict to stay at home from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who declared: ‘Nous sommes en guerre.’ In the mornings, the housekeeper — who lived in the nearby village — would leave a fresh baguette and a couple of pains au chocolat on the doorstep. I’d see her from the kitchen window, giving me a wave with a hand encased in a disposable plastic glove as she made her way home down the long gravel drive.\n\nAs you would expect from such a house, there was a well-stocked library. From one of the shelves, I pulled down Anna Karenina. It has one of the most famous opening lines in literature and even if you have not read the book, you will probably know it: ‘Happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ I had always been put off reading it by the length, 960 pages, but with gendarmes outside the gates — vos papiers, s’il vous plait — now was the perfect time to start.\n\nTolstoy hooks you from the first page: ‘All was confusion in the Oblonskys’ house. The wife had found out that the husband was having an affair with their former French governess…’ This was the 2001 Penguin edition, the translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, which puts Tolstoy into simple and direct English. Compare that line to the version from the Everyman edition, published in 1992: ‘The wife had discovered an intrigue between her husband and their former French governess.’ It matters which translation you read.\n\nAs the preface to the Penguin edition says, Anna Karenina began to form in Tolstoy’s mind after a woman threw herself under a train near his country estate of Yasnaya Polyana (‘Bright Glade’): ‘Jealousy and an unhappy love affair were involved, and led Tolstoy to reflect very seriously on the role of love and marriage in society.’ The novel rings true partly because Tolstoy drew heavily on his own life to write it. For instance, the scene where Levin shows his future wife the diaries revealing his youthful debaucheries came from the author’s own experiences.\n\nThat comes from How to Write Like Tolstoy, by Professor Richard Cohen, which is interesting to read alongside Anna Karenina. Cohen discusses Tolstoy’s gift of creating solid, three-dimensional characters, telling the story of when Turgenev visited Yasnaya Polyana. Tolstoy took him to see a barn full of animals. A few minutes later, Turgenev stormed back to the house. He had been infuriated by Tolstoy’s casual ability to go up to each animal — horse, cow, or duck — and describe its character, love life, and family connections. According to Cohen, Turgenev complained: ‘It was intolerable! He knows I can’t create characters like him, and here he was doing it with a whole menagerie!’\n\nWe left the château and drove for England (not wanting to expose my 75-year-old mother-in-law to the corona-soup of an airport departure hall). We drove for miles on the autoroute without seeing another vehicle; service stations were eerily deserted. Our companion on the drive was an audiobook of The Last Juror, by John Grisham — a master of pulp instead of a master of literature. It’s the story of a murder trial in Mississippi and how, one by one, the jurors are killed off after convicting the murderer. It was gripping, entertaining, and substantial as candy floss: perfect for the endless empty road. Britain was a week behind France. It seemed strange to see the motorway full of cars, a line of people at the till in the gas station.\n\nI’m now reading Tolstoy in my own home, a Victorian semi, instead of under an ancient, spreading plane tree on a small estate. But if we are still isolating by the time I finish"
