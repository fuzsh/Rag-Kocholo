Really great writer.\n\nNeal Stephenson has a couple good ones too.\n\nI like the Ender books, and of course Tolkien, and Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter has some good things and some not so...\n\nTake a look at a guy named Jeff Somers too, and Paolo Bacigalupi.\n\nRichard Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs series is cool, like sci-fi laced with crime noir.\n\nWow 24 replies, and no one has listed any of the William Gibson stuff!

I read the other two in that trilogy and liked them as well.\n\nHe has more, and they are just as good...\n\nSome great suggestions and I think I have read them all... here's a few that have been missed so far:\n\nJonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell (by Susanna Clarke)(NYT Book of the Year... and had a World of Warcraft zone designed after it)\n\nThe White Company (by Sir Arthus Conan Doyle)(more well-known for Sherlock Holmes, this is Doyle's personal favorite work about a band of mercenary bowmen in medieval France).\n\nSalem's Lot (by Steven King)(gonna throw this one in here because other people mentioned The Stand. Yes it's horror, but it's more like zombie apocalypse horror... with vampires)\n\nI like sci-fi and fantasy books too, my parents owned a bookstore when I was a kid, I would sit in the corner and read... a lot. Read LOTR for the first time at about 9 yrs old. I liked wheel of time as well, caught up to the author at around book 5 and it became a bit difficult to keep the details fresh while waiting for the next book, too bad Jordan wasn't able to finish it himself.\n\nAll time favourite author, Terry Pratchett, anyone else a fan?\n\nI'm more fantasy than sci-fi.\n\nI've read so many its insane.\n\nAmong my favorites;\n\nChronicles of narnia\n\nShannara books up to druid of..\n\nMagic kingdom for sale\n\nThere are a ton of others. I'll have to stop by the library and remember some titles.\n\nI can read your average novel in one sitting. I enjoy it more that way than slow reading"
