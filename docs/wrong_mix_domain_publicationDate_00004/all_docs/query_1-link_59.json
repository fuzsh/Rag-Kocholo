        "text": "4: DORMANT\n\nThe first of two stories by A.E. Van Vogt, both interesting and unique in their style and treatment of non-human intelligence. Alfred Elton Van Vogt (1912-2000) was Canadian, who moved to California in 1944. He added the middle two names ‘Elton Van’ in 1937, but almost never used his first names, only initials. His first successful science fiction story was “Black Destroyer” (1938), and was said to have later inspired the 1979 movie Alien. Vogt sued for plagiarism and was awarded $50,000 compensation. In 1939 he married Edna Mayne Hull (she came from the same Canadian town as he did), and she became his ‘secretary’, typing his stories, but in the 1940s she also wrote several science fiction stories herself. Although Van Vogt is regarded as one of the early pioneers of the science fiction ‘golden age’, opinion on him was divided, or, as British science fiction writer and critic Brian Aldiss said, his “stories never cease to arouse argument”. Nevertheless, he wrote a series of what are now regarded as science fiction classics – Slan (1946); The Weapon Makers (1946); The World of Null-A (1948); Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950); and The Weapon Shops of Isher (1951). That said, I have only read – or have memory of – the two short stories listed here. In retrospect, I was very selective in what I read. The only specific science fiction authors whose novels I read in any quantity were H.G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Azimov’s Foundation stories, John Wyndham, and Ray Bradbury. Beyond that, short story anthologies only gave a snapshot of authors, or their style. Thus I first read “Dormant” (originally published in 1948) in Edmund Crispin’s Best SF, by Faber (my copy dated ‘mcmlxii’ – 1962.)\n\nBoth stories – “Dormant” and “Fulfilment” (1952) – certainly example what has been called Van Vogt’s “bizarre narrative style”. In “Dormant” the story has two protagonists, the alien entity Iilah, and the U.S. Navy Lieutenant Maynard. Neither are actually aware of the existence of the other. The story is also set in the aftermath of the Second World War, in 1950, so just two years after actual publication. That the story ends with global catastrophe does, of course, rather date it. We’re still here. Perhaps we can take it as another example of an alternative history we were lucky enough to avoid!\n\nMy one possible criticism is events take place on a small, uninhibited Pacific island – “roughly three miles long and, at its widest, half a mile across. It curved tensely around a blue lagoon and the thin shape of its rocky, form-ridden arms and hands came down toward the toe of the island – like a gigantic man bending over, striving to touch his feet and not quite making it.” But the text also says – and this is key to the story and incredible antiquity of Iilah – that the island was old, more than a “million million years”, and “a protuberance of primeval earth itself”. Of course, the Earth is actually only 4.543 billion years old (the Universe itself being about 13.8 billion years), so that is 4,53,000,000 (plus/minus 50 million years, the geologists say) – a million million would add another three zeros! The oldest known rocks are in Canada (3.03 billion years) and Australia (4.3 billion years). The Pacific Ocean itself is quite young by comparison – only about 750 million years, the oldest floor 180 million years. So Van Vogt was out on his prehistory geology, but then, when he wrote the story, ‘continental drift’, or plate tectonics, to give its correct name, was still just a wild, unproven theory. Modern geology didn’t really begin until the 1960s and early 70s. Likewise, in 1948 astronomers still had no idea even of the scale of the universe, never mind its age, how or when it began. This continued to be argued over by cosmologists for another thirty years at least. So, no shame Van Vogt got it wrong.\n\nThe story opens with a vivid description of the island, and the casual reference to Iilah – “dead now almost for ever, forgotten by time and the universe.” Events then move to 1941, and the coming of the Japanese – there is a bit of lingering racism just three years after the Second World War, in Van Vogt’s description of “the little yellow men”. They built underground gas and oil tanks, destined to be thereafter neglected, and which later, after the war had ended, “sagged a little in their beds of earth and cracks appeared in several main pipes. Slowly the oil drained off and for years a yellow-green oil slick brightened the gleam of the lagoon waters.” The Japanese engineer in charge of the original installation had reported, “At the mouth of this channel [into the lagoon] there lies a solid shape of glittery, rocklike substance about four hundred feet long and ninety feet wide.” This was Iilah, then still dormant. But then, in the post-war 1940s, the American exploded their A-Bombs “in the reaches of Bikini Atoll, hundreds of miles away”, and eventually “the first seepage of that potent energy reached the island in the early autumn of 1946.” Two years later a U.S. clerk “ransacking the records of the Imperial Japanese navy in Tokyo” discovered the existence of the oil tanks, and two years more after that, the U.S. destroyer Coulson is dispatched to investigate. The Edmund Crispin edition I have (“reprinted from Destination: Universe! Publishers Messrs. Eyre & Spottiswoode Ltd.”), clearly states the year of events as being 1950, but it would seem the original magazine story gave the year it was published – 1948, and at least some of the text had small changes also.\n\nSo we are introduced to our first protagonist, Lieutenant Keith Maynard, a moody, gloomy man with a latent masochistic streak to his personality, together with his sarcastic executive officer, Lieutenant Gerson, whose “tongue dripped ceaselessly with irony”. Needless to say, the two do not get on. And straightway, Maynard is puzzled by the broad swath of crushed palm trees and the hundred feet-wide furrow from the mouth of the lagoon “to where a large rock lay half-buried near the top of the hill.” This prompts an exchange between the two men, with Maynard inadvertently exclaiming how could the rock have got there, “It’s not on any photographs”, and Gerson replying maybe they had the wrong island, or, alternatively, “I’d say it weighs about two million tons. The Japs probably dragged it up there to confuse us.”\n\nThis annoys Maynard, who recognises the estimate to probably be accurate, coupled with the knowledge that if the Japs could move a rock weighing two million tons they would have won the war. The channel to the lagoon “was wider and deeper” than stated by the Japanese. Having checked out the buried tanks (three of which were now empty, the oil leaked into the lagoon), Maynard is again goaded by Gerson’s sarcasm into a premature investigation of the rock. By then it was night, and he is accompanied by seven men and the Bos’n’s Mate. All are puzzled by the nature of the destruction in the furrow, the crushed and burnt trees. The rock was a quarter of a mile from, and four hundred feet above, the lagoon. “From nearby, the rock looked like nothing more than rough granite. In the beam of the flashlights it glinted with innumerable streaks of pink…the upper end, buried though it was deeper into the ground, rose at least fifty feet above…” However, when Maynard instructed a seaman to break off samples of pink streaks, the man’s hand is completely burned off. – “He had touched Iilah.”\n\nIt soon transpired the rock was not only ‘hot’ – its surface temperature at about eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit, but it also radio-active, as was – if mildly – the waters of the lagoon. A hospital plane was to be dispatched to take away the injured seaman. Meantime, Maynard’s navy superiors were at first calling the rock a meteorite, despite its massive weight and that it rested on the surface of the island.\n\nThe story then switches to Iilah, its consciousness dimly reignited by the radiation from the Pacific Atom-bomb tests. Slowly, as awareness of his environment increased, “he looked forth with his radio vision out upon a strange world. He was lying on a shallow plateau near the top of a mountain. The scene was desolate beyond his memory. There was not a glint nor pressure of atomic fire – not a bubble of boiling rock nor a swirl of energy skyward by some vast interior explosion. He did not think of what he saw as an island surrounded by an apparently limitless ocean. He saw the land below the water as well as above it. His vision, based as it was on ultra-ultra-short waves, could not see water. He recognised that he was on an old and dying planet, where life had long since become extinct. Alone and dying on a forgotten planet – if he could only find the source of the energy that had revved him.”\n\nOnly when he propelled himself out of invisible, unsensed water, did he lose contact with water-borne current of atomic energy, but also the water “ceased to inhibit the neutron and deuteron activity of his body. His life took on an increased intensity. The tendency to slow stiflement ended. His great form became a self-sustaining pile, capable of surviving for the normal radio-active lifespan of the elements that composed it – still on an immensely less than normal activity level for him.” He reflected that there was something he was supposed to do, but at first no memory came. He examined the Moon and nearby planets: all were dead. He realised that he, too, had been dead, without recalling what had happened. Thus he was still musing over his fate when the destroyer floated through the sky towards him, apparently some unknown life-form, showing some dull internal heat. It stopped, still floating above the surface of the planet – an impossibility to him – but made no attempt at communication. Iilah not only didn’t see water, his ultra-waves also passed through humans. They, too, were invisible to him. He decided to direct “the first questioning pattern of thought towards the destroyer. He aimed straight at the vaguely glowing fires of the engine room, where, he reasoned, would be the intelligence of the alien creature.”\n\nThirty-four men died in the spaces in and around the engine room. The survivors, including Maynard and Gerson, were forced to abandon the radio-active ship, camping on the foreshore. Meantime scientific equipment and personnel were being flown in by transport planes, with bulldozers and concrete walls being built about the mysterious rock. Receiving no orders from higher command, and with more men falling ill from radiation sickness, Maynard eventually dispatched the entire ship’s company to Hawaii, leaving only a skeleton crew of volunteers of about a dozen men. There now followed confusion and interdepartmental wrangling between the navy and the civilian Atomic Energy Commission, with Maynard aware he was the navy’s representative on the island. “The realization included a thrilling mental visualization of himself rising to the rank of an admiral – if he handle the situation right. Just what would be right, aside from keeping a sharp eye on everything, he couldn’t decide. It was an especially exquisite form of self-torture.” Thus he took to night-time secret spying on the works being carried out by the “army of scientists and their assistants.” As such, he was the only person to witness Iilah climb to the top of the hill.\n\nTwo months had gone by as Iilah watched the freighters come and go, following the same route and always keeping at the same level. There were tantalizing glimpses of smaller, much faster, winged ships descending from a great height before disappearing behind the crest of the hill to the east. In the same direction he could perceive a haze of lights brightening the sky. Curiosity prompted him to set off the violent explosions on his lower surface and climb the seventy feet or so to the top of the hill. He regretted it immediately. One ship lay offshore. The haze of lights seemed to have no source, while scores of trucks and bulldozers scurried around. He sent several questioning thought-waves at some of them, but with no response. Come morning and from the human prospective, the rock was sitting on the top of the hill, now threatening both side of the island with its seemingly stray bursts of energy. Nine men were dead and a dozen injured, together with two months work wrecked. While the scientists moved camp to the lowest end of the island, a delegation of the project director and four top scientists visited Maynard, with the suggestion that he use the non-radio-active rear gun turret to open fire on the rock. Maynard refused, eventually saying he would only do so if he received a command from a naval authority. It was bureaucratic wrangling, and only on the fourth day did he receive indirect hints the navy regarded him as the ultimate decision-making “commander on the island”.\n\nToo late, for some in the scientists’ camp boarded the Coulson and opened fire on the rock. By the time Maynard boarded the destroyer – having ordered a party of his men to intercept the returning motor-boat – the rock was already starting down the hill. Iilah had initially misinterpreted the incoming shell as some unknown form of communication, and even allowed the explosions to breach his protective defences. Only belatedly did he realise he was perhaps being attacked, if by “purely molecular” methods completely unfamiliar to him. Annoyed more than still thinking himself endangered, he resolved to drive it away. Even as he entered the water – this, to him, mysterious level below which affected his life forces – the destroyer recommenced firing, now at point-blank range, poking “deep holes into the ninety-foot cliff with which Iilah faced his enemy”. As he shoved against the destroyer – “Maynard and his men, having defended the Coulson as long as possible, tumbled over the far side into their boat and raced away as fast as possible.” – so it sunk down onto the rocks that formed the plateau. From Iliah’s viewpoint “An unexpected thing happened. Once amongst the rocks, the creature started to shudder and shake…It fell over on its side and lay there like some wounded thing, quivering and breaking up.”\n\nIilah then reclimbed the mountain (as he thought of it). The freighter was able to escape, ‘floating’ above the bleak valley, eventually stopping several miles away. Instead Iilah headed towards where the small objects were clustered. He moved at about eight miles an hour, but in the subsequent chaos and panic three hundred and seventeen men were crushed to death, “by a monster that did not even know they existed.” By nightfall, Maynard was leading a party searching for survivors, who were then ferried to where the freighter waited. Orders had come through on the radio. Within forty-eight hours the island was to be obliterated by an atomic bomb dropped from a drone plane. They find “one of the world-famous scientists”, injured but conscious. As Gerson administered morphine, Maynard tried to question him his opinion. The scientist’s response, “There’s something funny about that creature. Don’t let them do any – ” Too late. Gerson had successfully put him to sleep. “Maynard followed the stretcher without a word. He had a sense of having been saved from the necessity of making a decision, rather than having made me.”\n\nThe next day drone plane appeared in the sky. Iilah “sent cautious thoughts towards it. Several planes, to which he had directed his thought waves, had twisted jerkily in mid-air and tumbled down out of control.” But this robot plane did not divert from its course. It dropped its bomb – “The timing was perfect, the explosion titanic.” The result was to restore Iliah’s memory and sense of purpose. The million millennia interstellar war was obviously still on-going. “He set in motion an ordering process that would dissolve all his shields inside his own body…The explosion that knocked a planet out of its orbit was recorded on every seismograph on the globe.” Only some time later would astronomers discover the Earth was falling into the sun. No one would be alive “to see Sol flare into Nova brightness and burn up the Solar System before gradually sinking back into a dim G state…”\n\nThe story ends with the reflection, even had Iilah known it was not the same war, the consequences would probably have been the same. “Robot atom bombs do not make up their own minds.”\n\nEven so, it was our rather dumb military response – “Shoot first, ask questions later” – that triggered our collective doom."
