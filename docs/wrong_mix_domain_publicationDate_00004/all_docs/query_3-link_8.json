The novel follows a group of immortals, known as the High Ones, as they navigate the complexities of human history and their own eternal existence. The story begins in ancient China, where two of the High Ones, Hsi and Chu, are living as nobles. When a rival faction threatens their lives, they are forced to flee and embark on a journey that will take them across the globe and through the ages. Along the way, they encounter other immortals, each with their own stories and perspectives on the human experience. One of the most compelling aspects of \"The Boat of a Million Years\" is the way Anderson uses the immortals' long lives to explore the vast expanse of human history. From the fall of the Roman Empire to the Age of Exploration, the novel offers a unique perspective on the major events and cultural shifts that have shaped our world. At the same time, the immortals' own struggles and relationships serve as a microcosm for the human experience. They grapple with questions of identity, purpose, and belonging, and must come to terms with the fact that, despite their immortality, they are still subject to the same joys, sorrows, and uncertainties as everyone else. Anderson's writing is rich and evocative, bringing to life the diverse settings and cultures the immortals encounter on their journey. The novel is also imbued with a deep sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe and our place in it. Overall, \"The Boat of a Million Years\" is a thought-provoking and engaging novel that will appeal to fans of both science fiction and historical fiction. Its exploration of immortality and the human experience is both timeless and profound, making it a worthy addition to any reader's shelf..."
