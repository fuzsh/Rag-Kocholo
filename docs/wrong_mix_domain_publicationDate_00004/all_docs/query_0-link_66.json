        "text": "The Shockwave Rider is one of a series of influential and wildly imaginative novels that Brunner wrote in the 1960s and 1970s in which he imgined how society might develop in the future under the impact of problems such as over-population and environmental pollution.\n\nIn The Shockwave Rider, Brunner’s focus is the impact of computers on society, a technology whose use in the early 1970s was confined to large corporations, scientific research institutes and the government. Computers were large machines which filled whole rooms: the idea of home computers was just a distant dream. (You can find a timeline on the development of computers here).\n\nIn his introduction to the novel John Brunner writes:\n\nPeople like me who are concerned to portray in fictional terms aspects of that foreign country, the future, whither we are all willy-nilly being deported, do not make our guesses in a vacuum. We are frequently – and in this case I am specifically – indebted to those who are analyzing the limitless possibilities of tomorrow with some more practical aim in view…as for instance the slim yet admirable hope that our children may inherit a world more influenced by imagination and foresight than our own. The scenario (to employ a fashionable cliche) of The Shockwave Rider derives in large part from Alvin Toffler’s stimulating study Future Shock, and in consequence I’m much obliged to him.\n\nFuture Shock, published in 1970, was written by Alvin and Heidi Toffler. The Tofflers argued that society was undergoing an enormous structural change, a revolution from an industrial society to a “super-industrial society” a change which was overwhelming people and leaving them suffering from “shattering stress and disorientation” ie “future shock” In their view the majority of social problems were symptoms of “future shock”.and “information overload.”\n\nThe Tofflers explicitly referenced science fiction: “… science fiction has immense value as a mind-stretching force for the creation of the habit of anticipation. Our children should be studying Arthur C. Clarke, William Tenn, Robert Heinlein, Ray Bradbury and Robert Sheckley, not because these writers can tell them about rocket ships and time machines but, more important, because they can lead young minds through an imaginative exploration of the jungle of political, social, psychological, and ethical issues that will confront these children as adults.”\n\nBrunner specificlaly references the book in the novel :“oh, well the fact it it took us by surprise is just another example of Toffler’s Law, I guess: the future arrives too early and in the wrong order.”\n\nSo to the story. Nicholas Haflinger is a “dodger.” In this future society computers log all citizens and their activity, but Haflinger can create his own identity on the data-net (as Brunner calls it) by inputting fictitious details from his veephone – and then disappear from the gaze of the authorities. Periodically Haflinger purges his existing identity and creates a new one.\n\nIn this future those with money have adopted the “plug-in” lifestyle” which offers never-ending change as one vacuous trend replaces another, one job replaces another, one house replaces another, one partner replaces another… ad infinitum. Television offers multiple three-vee channels which are periodically hijacked by pirate channels broadcasting from satellites. There are also competing religious groups: eg the Billykings (Protestants), the Grailers (Catholic), the Jihadi babies (Muslims), who attack each other in gang wars (known as “triballing).\n\nThe computer networks offer public Delphi boards on which the public bets on the outcome of predictions.\n\nIt works approximately like this.\n\nFirst you corner a large – if possible, a very large – number of people who, while they’ve never formally studied the subject you’re going to ask them about and hence are unlikley to recall the correct answer, are nonetheless plugged into the culture to which a question relates.\n\nThen you ask them, as it might be, to estimate how many people died in the great influenza epidemic, which followed World War 1, or how many loaves were condemned by EEC food inspectors as unfit for human consumption during June 1970.\n\nCuriously, when you consolidate their replies they tend to cluster around the actual figure as recorded in almanacs, year-books and statistical returns,\n\nIt’s rather as though this paradox has proved true: that while nobody knows what’s going on around here, everybody knows what’s going on around here.\n\nWell, it works for the past, why can’t it work for the future? Three hundred million people with access to the integrated North American data-net is a nice big number of potential consultees. Unfortunately most of them are running scared from the awful specter of tomorrow. How best to corner people who just do not watn to know?\n\nAn orphan, Haflinger was was recruited from school by the government and taken to a training and educational facility called Tarnover. It’s dedicated to:\n\n…exploiting genius. Their ancestry could be traced back to the primitive “think tanks” of the mid-twentieth century, but only in the sense that a solid-state computer was descended from Hollerith’s punched-card analyzer. Every superpower, and a great many second-hand and third-rank nation has similar centres. The brain race had been running for decades and some countries had entered it with head start. (The pun was popular, and forgivable.)\n\nThe USA entered the race on the grand scale very late. Not until the nation was reeling under the impact of the Great Bay Quake was the harsh lesson learned that the economy could not absorb disasters of even this magnitude. Even then it took years for the switch from brawn to brain to become definitive in North America. ..the goal? To pin down before anybody else did the genetic elements of wisdom.\n\nHaflinger flourishes at Tarnover – but then he discovers that they are trying to make a superhuman through genetic experiments, creating life that is brought to term in an artificial womb. Appalled, he goes on the run\n\nAt the start of the novel, after deleting his identity as Arthur Lazarus, founder and proprietor of the Church of Infinite Insight in a converted drive-in movie theatre near Toledo, Haflinger creates a new identity as Sandy Locke, a computer-sabotage consultant, and gets a job with a corporation called G2S. All well and good and as planned. But then he meets a woman called Kate Lilleberg who sees right through his role-playing. “You Sandy Locke are trying far too hard to adhere to a statistical norm. and I hate to see a good man go to waste.”\n\nThe strain of living too many lives and having to constantly maintain a facade brings about Haflinger’s mental collapse from which he is rescued by Kate. They become lovers and go on the run, eventually ending up at at Precipice, one of the settlements created by refugees from Northern Califiornia after the Great Bay Quake which levelled San Francisco. The town is reached by a meandering electric rail-car. “Among the things Precipicians didn’t like might be cited the data-net, veephones, surface vehicles not running on tracks, heavier-than air craft…modern merchandising methods and the Federal government.”\n\nPrecipice rejects “the plug-in society”; the inhabitants lives life in environmental way with a strong sense of place and community, guided by a grassroots democracy. But it hides some vital secrets that protect its independence from a Federal governmnet that loathes it and from the tribes who try and raid the town from time to time. This description of a human-based society seems very inspired by the communes that sprang up in California in the 1970s.\n\nAfter a falling out Kate and Haflinger spilt up and leave Precipice. Haflinger is identified and captured, returned to Tarnover and questioned relentlessly about his life on the run.\n\nHis interogator Freeman tells him: “…But you see you are nobody. And you chose to be so of your own free will. Legally, officially, you simply don’t exist.” Kate too is abducted and interogated to put pressure on him. But, convinced by Haflinger’s relentless logic, his interrogator Freeman releases them unofficially. The couple then criss-cross the United States, borrowing home computers as Haflinger creates and releases a worm that cannot be killed into the data-net, as he tells a press conference held in building occupied by students;\n\n…consist in a comprehensive and irrevocable order to release at any printout station any and all data in store whose publication may conduce to the enhanced well-being, whether physical, psychological or social of the population of North America. Specifically…information concerning gross infringements of Canadian, Mexican and.or United Staets legal enactmnets respecting – in order of priority- public health, the protection of the environment, bribery and corruption, fair business and the payment of national taxes, shall be dissemminated automatically to the media.\n\nIn other words there are no longer any secrets.\n\nThey return to Precipice where they and the town face a final apocalyptic threat from the Federal Government that only Halflinger’s extraordinary talent for altering the data-net can save them from. Can he achieve the impossible?\n\nThe Shockwave Rider is at heart a novel of ideas and possibilities : the core of the novel is Freeman’s and Haflinger’s dialogue on the kind of society they are living in – and what an alternative might be. Highly recommended.\n\nThis Doctor Who novel was a long time in coming. It began life as a joint script dreamt up by Tom Baker and his co-star, the late Ian Marter (who played Unite medic Harry Sullivan in Doctor Who between 1974 and 1975). A good deal of the original story seems to have been worked on between rounds in their favourite London pubs or the Colony Club. Giving it the name name Doctor Who Meets Scratchman the two actors got as far as talking to director James Hill about a possible film, but it never progressed any further.\n\nFlash forward forty odd years and the project has been revived and turned into a novel in a collaboration between Tom and the very experienced writer James Goss, whose previous Doctor Who work has included the novels City of Death (2015), The Pirate Planet (2017) and Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen (2018). In an interview in Doctor Who Magazine (534) James says:\n\nAt the start of the project I sat down with Tom and a storyline… Although a script of Scratchman exists, there were a few hints that it wasn’t quite what Tom and Ian had originally envisaged. So we went right back to the original story and built it up from there. ..Tom was very influential in shaping the story.\n\nScratchman features The Fourth Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan. The story is told in a series of flasbacks by the Doctor himself who has been hauled up in front of an assembly of Time Lords with the snappy title of the Convocation of Oblivion. They’re not happy.\n\n“ Your recent actions endangered the enture universe,” the Zero Nun informed me.\n\nYes. Something trivial like that.\n\nThe crowd seethed. There was hunger to them….\n\n“All right,” I told her. “But in order to do that I need to teach you about the fear”.\n\n“Fear?” she blinked. That got her.\n\n“Yes.” I addressed the entire chamber. “You see, even the Time Lords are afarid of something . And tonight, I’m going show you what it is. Are you sitting comfortably? Of course you are. And I’m rather afraid that’s the problem…”\n\nThe novel opens with the Doctor and his companions landing on a remote Scottish island. (Science fiction and Scottish islands seems to naturally go together, one thinks of Target Luna, The Andromeda Breakthrough, Orbit One Zero, Aliens in the Mind etc).\n\nA peculiar breeze drifted through the fading daylight on the island. The strange wind howled around the field, circling like a cat before settling down.\n\nA sheep observed all this curiously. Confirming her worst suspicions, a large blue box pushed its way out of thin air onto the grass. The ewe shook her head sadly and trotted away.\n\nThe island is picturesque, but the Doctor senses something in the air. He’s right, of course. They soon discover that the scarecrows on the island are mutated villagers. They are alive (sort of) – and malevolent, and it’s not long before the Doctor and the remaining villagers are barricaded in the local church in a classic “base under siege” scenario with the scarecrows hammering on the doors. (The Doctor comes up with a collective noun for scarecrows, by the way “a scratch”)\n\nThe Doctor manages to get them out of this, but this is just the begining of their troubles. If the first half is gothic in feel, the second half draws on classic Greek tales, particularly The Odyssey.\n\nThe Doctor, having been separated from Sarah and Harry, finds himself in a mythological place. If I tell you that he’s driven there by Charon (in a London taxi) you’ll probably guess where he is (or appears to be, for nothing is straightforward and nothing is what it seems). Can the Doctor free himself and rescue his companions?\n\nBetween them Tom and James have successfully evoked a particular era of Doctor Who without it being a pastiche and I personally enjoyed it a great deal, particularly some of the phrases in the novel. Here are a few of my favourites;\n\n“Oh,” said Sarah, and it was the saddest of “oh’s”.\n\n“I love a good barricade, it reminds me of the Siege of Leningrad”.\n\n“That”, I said very gravely, “is a bag of jelly babies”. I took the sweets from Harry’s hand and offered them around. No takers.\n\nI took refuge in the canapes, successfully helping myself to a vol-au-vent. It’s quite something when only the profiteroles believe in you.\n\nUrsula Le Guin is one of the most important science fiction writers of the twentieth century, whose works such The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossesed continue to be very influential. Ursula was an activist in the USA in the campaign against the Vietnam War, and The Word for World Is Forest clearly emerged from that experience. Much of the war was fought in forests between the Americans, who had vast military techonology, and the guerilla army of the Vietcong, who had no such weaponry, but were armed instead with an unrelenting desire to be free.\n\nThe novel is set on Athshe, a planet entirely covered by forests in which live the Athsheans, a small, peaceful, highly intelligent, humanoid race whose bodies are covered with green fur. The planet is colonised by several thousand Earthmen – who rename it New Tahiti – and begin cutting down the forests and shipping the wood back to Earth. They make virtual slaves of the Athsheans, using them as labourers or for sexual gratification as there are few Earth women.\n\nThe three main characters are the Earthman Davidson, the Earthman Lyubov, and the Athshean Selver. Davidson is a military man who regards the Athsheans (or “creechies” as the colonists call them) with contempt: “the creechies are lazy, they’re dumb, they’re treacherous, and they don’t feel pain”. He personifies the masculine mindset, reflecting to himself: “the fact is the only time a man is really and entirely a man is when he’s just had a woman or killed another man”. Lyubov, by contrast, tries to underestand the Athsheans, their culture of singing , their symbiotic relationship with the forest, and the fact that the Athsheans dream when they are awake as well as when they are asleep.\n\nDavidson rapes Selver’s wife who dies. Selver realises that the Earthmen intend to destroy the forest, and therefore his people, unless they are stopped – and begins to dream of a way of achieving this. He tells his people:\n\nIf we wait a lifetime or two they will breed, their numbers will double or redouble. They kill men and women, they do not spare those who ask life. They cannot sing in contests. They have left their roots behind them, perhaps, in this other forest from which they come, this forest with no trees. So they take poison to let loose the dreams in them, but it only makes them drunk or sick. No one can say whether they ‘re men or or not men , whether they’re sane or insane, but that does not matter. They must be made to leave the forest. If they will not go they must be burned out of the Lands, as nests of stinging-ants must be burned out of of the groves of the city…Tell any people who dream of a city burning to come after me..\n\nSelver co-ordinates attacks from thousands of Athsheans on the Earth settlements, killing many men and women, and setting fire to the buildings. His friend Lyubov dies in one of the attacks. Selver pens the survivors into a compound and negotiates a truce. This is broken by Davidson who organises attacks on the Athshean cities in the forest. Finally, Selver captures him alive, and tells him:\n\nLook Captain Davidson..we’re both gods, you and I. You’re an insane one and I’m not sure whether I’m sane or not, But we are gods…We bring each such gifts as gods bring. You gave me a gift, the gift of killing of one’s kind, murder. Now, as well as I can, I give you the my people’s gift which is not killing. I think we each find each other’s gift heavy to carry.\n\nDavidson is not killed, but put on a treeless island, to live alone. Emissaries from Earth and other planets arrive who prepare to evacuate all the surviving Earth colonists. One of the envoys asks Selver whether Athsheans are now killing Athsheans. Selver replies sombrely :\n\nSometimes a god comes…He brings a new way to do a thing, or a new thing to be done. A new kind of singing, or a new kind of death. He bring this across the bridge between the dream-time and the world-time. When he has done this, it is done. You cannot take things that exist in the world and try to drive them back into the dream, to hold them inside the dream with walls and pretences. That is insanity. What is, is. There is no use pretending now, that we do not know how to kill one another.\n\nAs well as the background of the Vietnam War, there are clear resonances in the novel of the way that native Americans were treated by European colonists who raped and killed them and took their land; and the similar experience of the Aborigine peoples of Australia, who also talk of a “dream-time”.\n\nWhile Selver and Lyubov have some complexity as characters, with Selver feeling that what he has unleashed is dreadful but also feeling that he has not other choice, Davidson is one dimensional, a man in thrall to his own needs and desires – and with no empathy for others. Reflecting some years later Ursula acknowledged this flaw in the novel. “….he is purely evil – and I don’t, consciously, believe purely evil people exist. But my unconscious has other opinions. It looked into itself and produced, from itself, Captain Davidson. I do not disclaim him“.\n\nWhether she intended or not, Ursula’s novel is very much a feminist riposte to Robert Heinlein’s Starship Troopers (1959) – written against the backdrop of the Cold War – which imagined a future society in which you can only become a citizen by serving in the military. It is in fact a paean to the alleged virtues of the military “code of honour” , a code unpicked by Ursula in this novel to reveal its true reality: racism and murder.\n\nThe Word for World Is Forest had some influence on “Kinda”, a 1982 Doctor Who serial written by Christopher Bailey, his first script for Doctor Who. Like Ursula’s novel “Kinda ” is set in a forest with a people confonting colonists and is a psychological, rather than an action serial, with layers of meaning and a number of spiritual reference. Bailey says that he tried to write it without any people being killed, and that he name the main characters after Buddhist terms, including the Mara (“temptation”), Panna (“wisdom”), and Anatta (“without self”). Incidentally Panna was played by the wonderful Mary Morris who, among many other roles, appeared in the BBC science fiction series A for Andromeda and The Andromeda Breakthrough as the scientist Madeline Dawnay.\n\nIn 2017 I will be trying to post as much as possible about science fiction written by women. So far all the books and television series I have posted about since I started this blog have been written by men, which reflects the nature of the genre for much of the first half of the twentieth century. But things began to change slowly in the 1960s.\n\nOne example is Memoirs of a Spaceman by Naomi Mitchison (1897 – 1999), published in 1962. At the age of 65 this was Naomi’s first venture into science fiction: prior to this she was known for her many novels, travelogues and frank autobiography.\n\nLet’s imagine for a minute that you are a man in your early 30s who is a science fiction “aficianado” (not a “fan,” much too vulgar). You have read and enjoyed the work of Wells, Wyndham and Hoyle, men who showed you the Earth threatened by Martians, airships, Triffids, “Bathies”, not forgetting an interstellar gas cloud. On television you have watched and enjoyed 1984, the Quatermass serials, A for Andromeda and its sequel The Andromeda Breakthrough.\n\nNothing you have read or seen has shaken your view of society or marriage or sex in the slightest. So you buy a copy of Memoirs of a Spacewoman, hoping perhaps for a racy tale of ray-gun toting young women in spacesuits and you sit down in your favourite armchair by the fire, with your favourite pipe and a glass of your favourite malt whisky, and you begin reading… and after a few seconds your world starts to tilt sideways, like the Tardis caught in a tractor beam.\n\nThe novel begins reflectively:\n\nI think about my friends and the fathers of my children. I think about my children, but I think less about my four dear normals than I think about Viola. And I think about Ariel. And the other. I wonder sometimes how old I would be if I counted the years of time blackout during exploration. It would be an alarming thought if that kind of thought happened to alarm me. Then I begin to wonder how many more voyages I should undertake, supposing of course that i don’t get killed.\n\nMary is a communications expert whose role on her various voyages to other planets is to establish communication with the alien species they encounter, sometime easily, sometimes traumatically. The space travel involve “time blackouts,” so that many years pass before the space explorers return to Terra (Earth), a phenomenon which at first created problems as she recalls:\n\nNaturally we did not realise at once that time blackout was going to make difficulties. It took a few major scandals to clear that up, and after all the Terran incest taboo has a quite sensible biological basis. Nowadays the parent-child relationship is rather strictly organised so we are not tempted to fall in love with our sons, however much they have grown up during our time blackouts; sometimes, I feel, we are over-conditioned, so that we are not even normally attracted to them in an affectionate way. I should hate that to happen to me. but of course there are also one’s friends’ sons.\n\nHowever, I know as well as the rest that one shouldn’t let oneself be attracted, and at least all my children’s fathers were in my age group or older. One ought to leave the young alone. How many times I’ve said that to myself! And usually, I will say, acted on it.\n\nHer companions on her voyages include Martians – not the death-dealing monstrosities of Well’s vivid imagination, but highly intelligent, sympathetic small humanoids – who communicate mostly through touch, and change gender depending on circumstances. Mary forms a close relationhip with Vly, who rescues her after an explosion on a planet they are visiting;\n\nDear Vly was communicating all over with his tongue, fingers, toes and sexual organs. I felt so grateful; it was so kind, so kind of him. More especially when one realises that on a mixed expedition the Martians never wish to communicate with the humans except for strictly technical and scientific purposes. It was with this feeling of gratitude towards him, of tensions easing, that I came to waveringly. Or was it only gratitude? Might it have been something more physiological, less ethereal? Difficult to ascertain.\n\nMary’s interaction with Vly leads to her ovaries being stimulated, and she gives birth on the journey home to a girl she calls Viola. “This happy and delightful small entity, not entirely human, and yet mine – I remember so well the stab of tenderness towards her! And strangely, oddly, the same tenderness towards Vly.”\n\nThis is not the only unorthodox child she has. Mary agrees to a scientific experiment involving grafting alien tissue onto her thigh, which grows into a living organism she calls Ariel after the spirit in The Tempest.\n\nBy now Ariel was over three feet long. It liked to be as close as possible over the median line reaching now to my mouth and inserting a pseudopodium delicately between my lips and elsewhere…its effect on me was somewhat disconcerting.\n\nEventually Ariel separates completely from Mary as though she had given birth. The experiment seems to be a success, but then Ariel dies, and Mary feels grief for the dead organism.\n\nIn between her voyages Mary also has children with Terrans, choosing the fathers sometimes for their intelligence, sometimes for sensuous reasons. She is attracted, for instance, to T’o M’kasi because of his hair : “the delightful heather spring of the different hair tensions tingling against one’s digital nerves as no flaccid blond hair does.”\n\nMary recounts her exploits on various planets and on Terra in chatty and frank way, as though you were having lunch together in a Cheltenham teashop. Memoirs of a Spaceman is an intellectually dazzling exploration of relationships (human and alien), sexuality (human and alien) and the joys and difficulties of communication (human and alien). Naomi Mitchison’s novel bears almost no relationship to the kind of novels being produced by her male contemporaries: put simply, it’s decades ahead of them and it’s unsurprising that it was reprinted in 1985 by The Women’s Press in their science fiction series. You can find a complete list of the novels in that series here.\n\nNo one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. .. Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment.\n\nSo begins H G Wells’ novel The War of the Worlds, a book which, perhaps more than any other of his works, created the genre we now call science fiction. When Wells wrote his tale of the invasion of southern England by an expedition of Martians, Great Britain was the most powerful and wealthiest nation on the planet with colonies in India and Africa and elsewhere, its power buttressed by its army and navy, confident in its God-given destiny to rule over other races. In his introduction Wells makes an explicit political point about how this confidence was punctured by the arrival of the Martians:\n\n… we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\n\nThe story is told through the eyes of unnamed narrator, a writer on philosophy, who is taken by an astronomer friend to watch unexplained eruptions of gas on Mars over ten nights, the launching, we soon realise, of projectiles towards the unsuspecting Earth:\n\nOne night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000 miles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil.\n\nThe first projectile falls to Earth on Horsell Common in Surrey. When it unscrews it reveals a Martian whom Wells chooses to make physically repulsive to Earth eyes:\n\nThose who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth, the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth–above all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes–were at once vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter, this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread.\n\nThe Martians never attempt to communicate with humans, they simply see them as an obstacle to their posession of a new world, mirroring the countless massacres inflicted by Europeans in America, Africa, Australia and many other parts of the world. When a welcoming party approaches the cylinder the Martians kill them all with a heat ray and then construct metal fighting machines which lay waste to the countryside. The narrator describes his first encounter:\n\nAnd this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand.\n\nThe army tries to stop them with artillery, but the guns and the soldiers are burned and destroyed. By chance one shell does damage a fighting machine, so the Martians respond by using a black poison gas to quell all opposition as though they were gassing an ants’ nest:\n\nan enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour, coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country. And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was death to all that breathe.\n\nThe Martians appear unstoppable as more cylinders fall to Earth. They add to their armaments with a flying machine:\n\nSomething rushed up into the sky out of the greyness–rushed slantingly upward and very swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the land.\n\nWells creates a vivid and disturbing picture of millions of refugees fleeing i from London and other towns, turning on each other as they desperately seek some kind of safety. This is not a picture of heroic resistance, but of a society breaking down in fear and panic.\n\nThe narrator is trapped in a ruined house by the fifth cylinder crashing to earth. Hidden a few feet from the invaders, he discovers a dreadful secret, that the Martians are collecting humans in order to drink their blood for food. He sees this happen, but fortunately Wells spares us the details. Escaping from the house, the narrator makes his way to London, a city now almost empty of people.\n\n…it was curiously like a Sunday in the City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn, the desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops. A jeweller’s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed asleep, but she was dead.\n\nThe farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the stillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death–it was the stillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . .\n\nHe now hears a strange cry from a Martian fighting machine endlessly repeated:\n\nUlla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me, from the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now again hungry and thirsty….As I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased. It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap.\n\nThe narrator finds the fighting machines standing motionless, and discovers that the Martians are all dead, killed, it later transpires, by Earth’s bacteria:\n\nIn another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines, and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the Martians–dead!–slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being slain; slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth.\n\nIn the final chaper the narrator brings the story up to date with the Martians, it seems from observations, having invaded Venus. But he is not confident that the threat has gone for ever, and the ending of the novel is melancholic:\n\nIt may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the future ordained.\n\nI must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and desolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle, children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal, and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding silence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise upon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler, uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and wretched, in the darkness of the night.\n\nI go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a galvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last great day. . . .\n\nThis is still a very readable novel, dazzling in its invention, but also prescient in its description of the behaviour of populations under attack by overwhelming force. A century after Wells wrote we are sadly all too familar with the scenes he imagined…\n\nIt is a story above all told from the viewpoint of ordinary civilians, caught up in terrifying events: there are no scenes set amongst government ministers, scientists or the military hierarchy.\n\nThe influence of The Wars of the Worlds can be seen in science fiction writing, up to and including Doctor Who: pitiless repulsive creatures, encased in a metallic machine, and armed with a death ray, now who does that remind you of?\n\nWells’ birthplace Woking has its own Martian fighting machine as seen above.\n\nYou can read the novel online here.\n\nReview in The Observer, 27 March 1898.\n\n“Freshness and originality are distinguishing features in Mr Wells’ compostions, and his latest work will in no sense disappoint his readers. It is fact extremely clever. Mr Wells depicts the attack on England of a number of the inhabitants of Mars, and he contrats their highly-trained scientific methods of warfare with our puny efforts of resistance. The moral too is admirable. We had become “soft” and “effete” and some extra mundane agency was necccessary to restore vigour to national life. ..We are assured by highly competent critics that Mr Wells owes his inspiration to Defoe, to Swift, to Edgar Poe, and even to Jules Verne. In The War of the Worlds we can trace none of these sources of inspiration. The aspect of his work is purely native – autochthonous, as the late Professor E A Freeman might have said…The literary technique is excellent, and it is in this respect that Mr Wells gains his great superiority over the mere sensation-mongers of the day. We have enoyed reading his book. It is not a novel, but it is good fiction.”\n\nProductions\n\nOrson Welles broadcast a live production on 30th October 1938, in which the story was transplanted to Amercica and which caused panic in some places with its vivid descriptions of an invasion. You can listen to this broadcast here, The story of the broadcast was made into a tv film in 1975, The Night that Panicked America, which you can watch here.\n\nThe BBC broadcast a radio dramatisation in six parts in May – July 1950, adapted by Jon Manchip White, who had just joined the BBC Drama Script Unit as an editor. He kept the Victorian setting and much of Wells’ dialogue. It had Anthony Hawtrey in the main role, with Peter Cokea s Gilvy and Derek Guyler as Stent. The producer was David H Godfrey. This production has not survived in the archives. There is more information about it here.\n\nThe first film version was made in 1953 by Paramount, starring Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, with the story updated and moved to the USA, and bearing scant resemblace to the original novel. It was produced by George Pal and directed by Byron Haskin. A sequel was later made for television that ran for two seasons from 1988 to 1990.\n\nThe BBC broadcast another radio dramatisation in six parts in June and July 1967, again using the adaptation by Jon Manchip White, although he says he had nothing to do with it, and yet someone uncredited has updated it to the present day. It had Paul Daneman as Professor John Nicholson, , Isabel Rennie as Dora Nicholson, Martin Jarvis as Ogilvy and Peter Sallis as the Parson. The sound score was by David Cain of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The producer was John Powell. (I can vividly remember listening to this). You can find out more about this production here. This production has survived and has been released on CD by the BBC. It’s also available on Audible. You can listen to a clip here.\n\nIn 1978 Jeff Wayne released an LP, The War of the Worlds, which told the story through words and music, and sold by the million. It was later turned into a stage musical. You can watch it here.\n\nAnother film version directed by Steven Spielberg was released in 2005, which I like even less than the 1953 version…\n\nAfter the post-nuclear war landscape of The Chrysalids John Wyndham’s fourth novel, The Midwich Cuckoos, was a return to familiar (though, as we shall see, unsettling) territory, a possible alien invasion of the world.\n\nIt begins with a small ordinary English village being subject to a mysterious force rendering everyone within a circle unconscious for a whole day on Tuesday 27th September (which would have fallen in 1960). The authorities outside cannot get in: an aerial photograph reveals an object in the village with “a pale oval outline, with a shape, judging by the shadows, not unlike the inverted bowl of a spoon.” When the village come back to life the object has gone, while the villagers appear not to have been harmed by what they quickly come to call the “Dayout”.\n\nSome months later, however, every woman of childbearing age, married or single, discovers that she is pregnant. The story is told, partly at least, through the eyes of village resident and writer Richard Gayford and his wife, Janet, who fortunately were not in the village at the time of the Dayout.\n\nGayford is recruited by an old friend and government intelligence officer, Bernard Westcott, to observe what takes place in the village after the Dayout and report back. He is the typical Wyndham protagonist, intelligent enough, but his wife is cleverer. The novel also has that familar Wyndham character, the older man who sees what is really going on, which in The Midwich Cuckoos is Gordon Zellaby, who lives in a large house in the village, and writes learned books. His daughter Ferrelyn, planning to be married, is one of the pregnant women.\n\nWhen the sixty-one children are born they appear to be normal human children, except they all have a sheen to the skin, golden hair and golden eyes. Soon, however, they display mental powers, forcing those mothers who have left the village to bring them back so that they can all be together. Zellaby carries out some tests and realises that the Children of Midwich are a single entity, one girl and one boy, who share intelligence, thoughts and learning. Already he suspects what is really going on, but blanches at the course of action that he feels is neccessary :\n\nCuckoos are very determined survivors. So determined that there is really only one thing to be done with them once one’s nest is infested. I am, as you know, a humane man…As a further disadvantage I am a civilised man. For these reasons I shall not be able to bring myself to approve of what ought to be done. Nor, even when we perceive its advisability, will the rest of us. So, like the poor hen-thrush we shall feed and nurture the monster, and betray our own species.\n\nThe novel resembles The Kraken Wakes in that the tension is built up quite slowly as a series of disturbing events occur. Unlike his other novels the whole action takes place within the village, and nowhere else, creating a claustrophobic feeling. One of the odd things about the novel is the chief storyteller up to now, Richard Gayford, whom the reader no doubt expected would take the narative forward, leaves the village with Jane at the end of Part One, and is absent for eight years.\n\nReturning to London for a short visit he bumps into Westcott, and accompanies him on a return trip to Midwich, during which he is brought up to date with what has happened whilst he has been away. The Children grew up much quicker than human children – by the time they were nine, they were the size of teenagers – and eventually the authorities decided that it was best to set up a special school in The Grange to look after them together. Westcott is returning for an inquest into the death of a young man, Jim Pawle, killed when his car hit a wall. The verdict is “Accidental Death”, but Gayford learns the truth from Zellaby, that the car hit one of the Children by accident, and they appear to have somehow deliberately made Pawle crash.\n\nAfter the inquest Pawle’s brother, David, shoots and wounds one of the Children, who then make him shoot himself. This leads to an attaks by the villagers on the Grange which ends in deaths and injuries when the Children use their mental powers to make them attack each other. Afterwards, one of the Children gives Westcott and the others a chilling warning\n\nI will put it more plainly. It is that if there is any attempt to interefere with us or molest us, by anybody, we shall defend ourselves. We have shown that we can, and we hope that that will be warning enough to prevent further trouble.\n\nZellaby explains that he believes an interplanetary invasion is under way:\n\n…we have not grasped that they represent a danger to our species, while they are in no doubt that we are a danger to theirs. And they intend to survive.\n\nWestcott now reveals there were other Dayouts in other parts of the world. In most cases the Children were killed at birth, but in the Soviet Union one group of Children survived in a town called Gizhinsk, which he has just learned, has been wiped out by an attack by an atomic cannon, killing the entire population. The Soviets then issued a warning calling on all governments to “neutralize” any such known groups as the Children were “a threat to the whole human race.” Zellaby sums up the dilemma they are now facing:\n\nIn a quandary where every course is immoral, there still remains the ability to act for the greatest good of the greatest number. Ergo, the Children ought to be eliminated at the least possible cost, with least possible delay. I am sorry to have to arrive at the conclusion. …It is the right step…But of course, our authorities will not be able to bring themselves to take it…\n\nAt the end of the book it is Zellaby who takes on the moral responsibility for dealing with the dilemma. Gayford accompanies him to the weekly film show that he runs for the children at the Grange and reflects as he watches them help Zellaby unload the equipment:\n\nThere was nothing odd or mysterious about the Children now…For the first time since my return I was able to appreciate that the Children “had a small ‘c’ too”. Nor was there any any doubt at all that Zellaby’s was a popular event. I watched him as he watched them with a kindly, half-wistful smile. I had a confused feeling that these could not be the Children at all; that the theories, fears and threats we had discussed must have to do with some other group of Children.\n\nShortly after Gayford returns to Zellaby’s home he sees a flash of bright light and a blast hits the house, smashing the windows, He realised that Zellaby has blown up himself with all the children. His wife Angela finds a note which reveals that Zellaby had a terminal illness and ends:\n\nAs to this – well we have lived so long in a garden that we have all but forgotten the commonplaces of survival…If you want to keep alive in the jungle, you must live as the jungle does.\n\nThe core of the novel is the moral question of how to act against invaders who arrive, not in spaceships or cylinders as in H GWells’s The War of the Worlds, but in the form of children. Step by step Wyndham leads us down the path to a dreadful conclusion, that the Children must be killed. He emphasises the horror of this by making the Children seem, just before this happens, the most like children they have been for the whole novel.\n\nThis is not Wyndham’s best novel, but it is certainly his most unsettling one, sonething he perhaps empphasis by placing the action in the archetypal English village, where nothing ever happens. Is there a nod here, perhaps, to Went the Day Well? Alberto Cavalcanti’s 1942 film in which an English village resists a German invasion (the Germans are disguised as British soldiers).\n\nFilms and radio dramatisations\n\nThe novel was filmed in 1960 by MGM , retitled somewhat sensationally as The Village of the Damned. The Richard Gayford character does not appears, the film’s hero is Gordon Zellaby, played by George Sanders, whilst his wife is played by Barbara Shelley (who also appeared in the film version of Quatermass and the Pit in 1967) . You can watch a trailer here.\n\nThe novel was adapted by William Ingram in three 30-minute episodes for the BBC World Service, first broadcast in 1982. It was directed by Gordon House.\n\nAnother adaptation by Dan Ribellato in two 60-minute episodes for Radio Four was broadcast in 2003.\n\nSurprisingly no television version has been made.\n\nOther posts\n\nIn my previous posts I have looked at Wyndham’s previous novels\n\nThe Day of the Triffids\n\nThe Kraken Wakes\n\nThe Chrysalids\n\nIn previous posts I have looked at The Day of the Triffids and The Kraken Wakes, both of which were set in the contemporary Britain of the 1950s, and showed the breakdown of society when faced with an unprecedented threat. John Wyndham’s third novel The Chrysalids is quite different in tone and content.\n\nThe novel set in the future, perhaps several centuries after our own time. The story is told through the eyes of David Strorm as he grows up in a rural part of Labrador, called Waknuk. This is a religiously fundamentalist society, fearful of any kind of physical difference in human bodies. Every Sunday without fail they recite a creed:\n\nAnd God created man in in His own image. And God decreed that man should have one body, one head, two arms and two legs; that each arm should be jointed in two places and end in one hand; that each hand should have four fingers and one thumb; that each finger should have a flat finger-nail..\n\nWe, the readers, soon divine that the “Tribulation” of which they talk was in fact a nuclear war, and that this is the society that has somehow survived, plunged back into a subsistence way of life, based on farming, with no technology. They use horses for travel, and bows and arrows for weapons, for instance. It’s clear that the fall-out is still creating mutations in humans, “deviations” as they call them, who when discovered are driven out of society to “The Fringes”. David’s father Joseph, is particularly fervent on rooting out “blasphemy”. They believe:\n\nThe penance of Tribulation that had been put upon the world must be worked out, the long climb faithfully retraced, and, at last, if the temptations of the way were resisted, there would be the reward of forgiveness. – the restoration of the Golden Age.\n\nAs he grows up David’s austere but orderly world is disrupted by a series of events. H becomes friends with a girl called Sophie, and discovers one day that she has six toes, not five. He does not report this, as she is his friend and he does not see her as a “deviation” but as a person. Eventually, of course, this secret is discovered: Sophie and her family are driven out, while David is brutally beaten by his father.\n\nBut David has his own secret, he too is a “mutant, ” able to communicate by telepathy with his cousin Rosalind and a number of other teenagers who have made it into adolescence without being discovered. David does have one ally, his uncle Axel who finds out about David’s ability, and warns him that he must never reveal his secret. Axel is that familar figure in Wyndham’s novels, the older man who challenges the received wisdoms and “commonsense” of their time. He is a close cousin to Michael Beadley in the Day of the Triffids and Alastair Bocker in The Kraken Wakes. A former sailor, Axel has travelled widely and seen things on sea and land which make him very sceptical of the rigid pieties of his own society.\n\n“Preacher words!” he said, and thought for a moment. “I’m telling you,” he went on, “that a lot of saying a thing is so, doesn’t prove it is. I’m telling you that nobody, nobody, really knows what is the true image. They all think they know – just as we think we know, but, for all we can prove, the Old People themselves may not have been the true image.” He turned, and looked long and steadily at me again.\n\n“So,” he said, “how am I, and how is anyone sure that this “difference” that you and Rosalind have does not make you something nearer to the true image than other people are? Perhaps the Old People were the image; very well then , one of the things they say about them is that they could talk to one another over long distances. Now we can’t do that – but you and Rosalind can. Just think that over, Davie. You two may be nearer to the image than we are.”\n\nDavid’s mother gives birth to another child, Petra, who appears perfectly normal until one day, when still a young child, she falls into the river, and in panic displays astonishing telepathic power, summoning Michael and the others to rescue her. As she grows up they are able to teach her to use her power – and to keep it a secret. Then one day, whilst out riding, Petra is attacked by a wild cat which kills her pony. Again she screams for help telepathically summoning all the group to help her. This gathering is observed by a passing stranger, who becomes suspicious and starts to make enquiries. A few days later in the middle of the night two of the group, Sally and Katherine, are seized by the authorities and tortured to make them reveal their secret. Alerted by the sisters, David, Rosalind and Petra steal horses and flee towards The Fringes. Another of their group, Michael, undiscovered, is with the armed posse which sets off to hunt them down. He tells his friends:\n\nThey’re afraid of us. They want to capture you and learn more about us – that’s why there’s the large reward. It isn’t just a question of the true image – though that’s the way they’re making it appear. What they’ve seen is that we could be a real danger to them. Imagine if there were a lot more of us than there are, able to think together and plan and co-ordinate without all their machinery of words and messages : we could outwit them all the time. They find that a very unpleasant thought; so we are to be stamped out before there can be any more of us. They see it as a matter of survival – and they may be right, you know.\n\nThat “matter of survival” is the key theme of the rest of the novel, both of the travellers and of the human race. As they flee Petra tells them that she has made contact with another “think-together” person, a woman who lives a very long way away across the sea in a place called “Sealand” where everyone is telepathic. The woman tells them that she will come and rescue them because of Petra’s remarkable power.\n\nIn the meantime, Michael, Rosalind and Petra make it to the Fringes, where they are helped by Sophie who is living there in poverty and squalor. The pursuing posse attacks the camp and Sophie is killed, but the group is saved when the flying machine arrives and sprays glistening threads that land on everyone in the camp, and bind them tight. The Sealand woman makes her way to the cave where they are hiding:\n\nPetra raised her hand and tentatively touched the woman’s face, as if to assure herself that it was real. The Sealand woman laughed, kissed her, and put her down again. She shook her head slowly, as if she were not quite believing. “It was worth while,” she said in words so curiously pronounced that I scarcely understood them at first. “Yes, certainly it was worth while!” She slipped into thought-forms, much easier to follow than her words.\n\n“It was not simple to get permission to come. Such an immense distance; more than twice as far as any of us has been before. So costly to send the ship: they could scarcely believe it would be worth it. But it will be…” She looked at Petra, wonderingly.”At her age, and untrained – yet she can throw a thought half-way around the world!”\n\nDavid suddenly realises that the threads have killed all the attackers, but the Sealand woman is unrepentant, explaining that they are a doomed race and that the “think-together” people are the future:\n\nYour minds are confused by your ties and your upbringing: you are still half-thinking of them as the same kind as yourselves. That is why you are shocked. …They can see quite well that if it is to survive they have not only to preserve it from detioriation, but they must protect it from the even more serious threat of the superior variant. For ours is a superior variant…The essential quality of life is living: the essential quality of living is change; change is evolution; and we are part of it.\n\nThe woman takes David, Rosalind and Petra in the flying machine off to New Zealand: Michael stays behind to rescue another member of the group, Rachel, promising to make their way to find them one day. The novel finishes as the machine arrives above a sunlit city with David sensing something new, a kind of suffused glow:\n\n“What is it?” I said, puzzled. “Can’t you guess, David? It’s people. Lots and lots of our kind of people”.\n\nThe Chrsyalids is Wyndham’s masterpiece. His chilling vision of a dystopian future is perfectly realised and the narative is compelling, carrying the ring of truth in its depiction on how societies can bond in fear against perceived “Outsiders” and repress dissent and change.\n\nWyndham wrote, of course, during the Cold War: a time when there was a real fear that the two superpowers, the USA and the Soviet Union – now armed with hydrogen bombs of enormous destructive power – would destroy the world between them. This fear found its way into a good few science fiction novels and plays, some of which I have listed below This survey is by no means exhasutive, of course.\n\nNovels\n\nThe Spurious Sun, by George Borodin (1948) begins with an H-bomb-like explosion in Scotland which ignites the upper atmosphere; savage wars ensue worldwide, the UK is eliminated by nuclear weapons, and both Leningrad and San Francisco are obliterated.\n\nDeath of a World by J.

An adapation for radio, written by Toby Hadoke, was broadcast by Radio Four on 27 October 2019. This is a an interview with Toby about his work on this version.\n\nIn previous posts I have looked at the science fiction writing of Fred Hoyle in the television dramas A for Andromeda and The Andromeda Breakthrough, as well as his novel, October the First is too Late. Written with his son Geoffrey Hoyle, Fifth Planet echoes the plot of Fred’s earlier novel The Black Cloud (1957) in which a sentient gas cloud entered the solar system and caused glocal catastrophe before moving on. In Fifth Planet a star named Helios, accompanied by its planets, enters the solar system in the late c20th.\n\nThe central character in the novel is Hugh Conway, a scientist who works at the Helios Centre in the UK which is planning a Western expedition to land on Helios’s fifth planet, Achilles. The Soviet bloc is also planning an expedition. Conway is married to the beautiful Cathy, but after ten years they share no common interests, and she is serially unfaithful, including an affair with one of the astronauts, Mike Fawsett, as Conway knows. Although set in the future, this is clearly the world of the early 1960s with Conway reading The Times over his breakfast.\n\nThere then follows a good deal of scientific detail about the difficulties of rendezvousing with a moving object like Achilles and the kind of massive rocket that would be needed to make the journey there and back. This becomes tedious after a while. Finally, and as a reader you are very relieved, both expeditions set off towards Achilles. (By the way the Soviet expedition includes a woman, Tara Ilyana, which was prescient of the Hoyles. They wrote the novel in August 1962: on 16 June 1963 Valentina Tereshkova spent three days orbiting the earth in a Soviet Vostock capsule.)\n\nThe Soviet expedition arrives first – but crashes on landing, killing one crewman and injuring another. They are rescued by the Americans after they too have landed. The atmosphere on Achilles is breathable, but there is no sign of any life, the landscape comprising lakes and grass:\n\nNow they knew what the green stuff was. Nothing but grass. Grass that stretched away from them in all directions , over hill over dale. It came up to their calves and it had a nice soft pile. They weren’t botanists so they couldn’t tell whether it was different from the grass back home…Even so it looked pretty much like a clover field. There was a light wind that produced a slight stirring of its surface. They walked a few hundred yards away from the rocket. The sky, they noticed, was very blue, a little richer than on Earth. The wind and the grass were producing a very gentle whispering.\n\nAchilles seems to be an Eden, but turns out to have a serpent as the members of the expedition start to suffer from hallucinations and other mental disturbances. Fawsett thinks he sees Cathy, for instance, and then has a breakdown, while two men drive in circles, unable to escape. Another pair of astronauts come across a set of vertical translucent sheets on a hill:\n\nNow that they had found something both Larson and Bakovsky began to think along the same lines. Theirs was the natural human reaction. What could they do to change things? They didn’t understand it, but perhaps if they could fiddle with something or other, something would happen, and then they would begin to understand it. Fiddle with it first and think about it afterwards. That was the thing to do…\n\nThe “fiddling” involves hurling a hand grenade at the sheets, which turns out to be very bad idea indeed. Larson dies on the spot “his whole personality, his very self, was lifted upwards and dissipated like puff of smoke”; Bakovsky runs for half a mile “his face strained with the utmost terror” until he reaches a lake and runs straight in until he vanishes under the water.\n\nFinally the remnants of both expeditions blast off back to Earth, where the Soviets and the West are bemused and then increasingly suspicious as to what reall did happen on Achilles. Cathy is summoned to the bedside of the traumatised Fawsett who dies in her presence. Conway takes her home, already aware that she is no longer his wife but someone else. “..in the first brief moment when she’d looked up at him he’d known – he’d known that it was not Cathy.” An alien has travelled from Achilles in the mind of Fawsett and then transferred to Cathy. She tells Conway she has come to find out about Earth, ” for the same reason that you came to our planet.”\n\nCathy now has prodigious mental power to influence the minds of humans which she uses to create a worldwide illusion that a nuclear war has started, though humanity eventually divines that it was an illusion;\n\nConway hadn’t realised how remarkably quick his own recovery had been. It took the rest of the world more than three hours to make the same recovery. The people rose up from the pavement, they came out of the fall-out shelters, they came out of their graves, and they found that the sun was still shining and that their children were still alive. For the most part they broke down and wept as they had not done since they were young themselves. They didn’t know how it had happened but they knew that in some way a hellish disaster had been avoided.\n\nThe governments of the world realise that this illusion resembles the illusions experienced on Achilles, and suspicion soon falls on Cathy. In the final, and frankly best part of the novel, with some genuine tension at long last, Cathy and Conway go on the run, hunted by the army and police. Whilst recovering from a bullet wound she tries to explain to him how their planet works:\n\nHe was delighted when he realized that the nature of the animating force of life was an irregularity in a wave surface, like a flash of radiation. As it travels in respect of time so our lives are propelled through the electrical circuits in our brain….the wave surface over a short period of time would appear like a standing wave in the four dimensional.\n\nNo, I didn’t understand that either. At the end of the novel Cathy uses her mental powers to get them on a shuttle into space and the pair take over a rocket that will get her back to Achilles. Conway is now deeply in love with this new version of Cathy, who has been transformed from a housewife principally interested in shopping and sex to a highly intelligent and powerful woman, and makes a last minute decision:\n\nHe looked far down the ship to where Cathy was standing, still watching him. He stood still for a moment and then with a muttered exclamation he began to move towards her again. He stopped for a few seconds to put his arm around her waist and draw her to him, then he went over to the big control panel. Quickly he released the transit, and only then pressed the switches that started the big motors. A very faint trembling seemed to fill the ship, and at last he reached down and pressed the main control lever. In an instant he could feel the drive beginning, he could feel the pressure in his legs. The great rocket began to swing outwards from the Earth, it began the journey for which it had been made, the journey to the planet of the whispering grass.\n\nIn their prologue to the novel the Hoyles explain that they wrote the novel to explore some scientific ideas;\n\nPhysics regards the world as four dimensional, all moments of time exist together. The world can be thought of as a map, not only spatially , but also with respect to time. The map stretches away both into the past and into the future. There is no such thing as as “waiting” for the future. It is already there in the map.\n\nI think the novel shows up the Hoyles strengths and weaknesses as science fiction writers. The ideas about space and time are intriguing, but the story is often lacklustre and cliched. The characters never really come to life off the page, except perhaps the alien Cathy. The idea of an alien visitor showing humanity that nuclear war would be disastrous seems to be a nod to the film The Day They Earth Stood Still (1951), while the motion of an alien taking over the mind of a returning astronaut seems to be a nod to the The Quatermass Experiment (1953).\n\nReviews\n\nIn Fifth Planet the astronomer and his son bring originality to three familiar themes: the interplanetary space race, the alien world with disturbing novelties, and the symbiotic life-form inhabiting a human being. This last – the human being in question is the hero’s wife – achieves an uncommon pitch of conviction and even pathos. Interspersed are the attacks on politicians as a group and the technocratic bias which one has come to expect from Hoyle pere. There are also references to development in sociology and psychology which will have made these studies scientific, an unscientific notion, although I couldn’t quite make out whether the Hoyles believe it or not. They do seem to think that certain individuals are “basically” interchangeable. This is unscientific.\n\nKingsley Amis, The Observer, 8 December 1963, p.24\n\nIf you would like to comment on this post, you can either comment via the blog or email me, fopsfblog@gmail."
