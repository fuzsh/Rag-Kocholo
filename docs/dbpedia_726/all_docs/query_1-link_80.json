        "text": "MR. JOHN ADAM, who died from typhoid fever at Brooklyn, N.Y., on May 16th, was one of the best cricketers in New York. He was born at Aberdeen in 1875.\n\nMR. WILLIAM GROVER ASHBY, for forty years Hon. Treasurer of the Sussex County C.C., died at Burgess Hill on June 12th. He was born at Staines on October 6th, 1826.\n\nTHE REV. WILLIAM KIRKPATRICK RILAND BEDFORD died at Cricklewood on January 23rd. He was the Father of the Free Foresters, which club he founded on July 20th, 1856, and the author of The Annals of the Free Foresters, issued in 1895. In 1894 he published, in the columns of Cricket, some very interesting reminiscences of early cricket and cricketers. He was educated at Westminster, and was for over forty years Rector of Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham. He was much interested in archery and heraldry. He was born in 1827.\n\nMR. JOHN BEST, who was born in August, 1824, died at St. Dennis, Cornwall, on February 27th, at the ripe age of eighty. He was a great supporter and lover of cricket, and, at the age of 75, could handle both bat and ball with remarkable success.\n\nA. BLABER, who was well-known in club cricket around Lewes, died on May 15th. He appeared twice for Sussex-once in 1890 and again in 1894. At the time of his death he was only 35 years of age, having been at Ludwell Farm, Horsted Keynes, on December 15th, 1869.\n\nMR. WALTER BODEN died at the Pastures, near Derby, on September 16th. It was chiefly on his initiative that the Derbyshire County C.C. was established. Throughout his life he always worked in the best interests of the County Club, of which he was the first Hon. Secretary, and the President from 1895 to 1898 inclusive. His portrait formed the frontispiece to W. J. Piper\"s History of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club, published a few years ago.\n\nWILLIAM BOTTOMORE, 60 years of age, died suddenly at Sheepshed on October 20th. In 1879 and the first half of the eighties he did good service to Leicestershire as a fast bowler, and was a useful batsman. His highest innings against a first-class side was 79, v. Sussex in 1880. He also made 41 not out against Surrey in 1884.\n\nMR. JAMES DUNCAN BOYD, one of the best supporters of American cricket, being especially identified with the New Jersey Athletic Club, died in January. He was born in Manchester in 1850.\n\nMR. H. HALE BUDD died on July 5th, in his sixty-second year. For many years he was actively identified with the Victorian Cricket Association, and for some thirteen seasons was Hon. Sec. of the East Melbourne C.C.\n\nMR. JOHN CHESTER, who died at Sheffield on February 20th, at the age of 74, had served on the Committee of the Yorkshire County C.C. for thirty years. He was buried at Fulwood Cemetery, Sheffield, on February 23rd.\n\nTHE EARL OF CHICHESTER, whose sudden death on April 21st, at Stanmer Park, Lewes, evoked so much sympathy, was in his Eton and Cambridge days a prominent figure in the cricket field, being known then as the Hon. F. G. Pelham. It was only in his last year at Eton-1863-that he secured a place in the eleven. By taking eight wickets with his slow round-arm bowling he helped Eton to beat Winchester in a single innings, but in a drawn match against Harrow at Lord\"s he met with very little success, his only wicket costing him 44 runs. The Eton team in 1863 was an extremely strong one, including as it did Alfred Lubbock (captain), the late E. W. Tritton, J. Frederick, the Hon. G. W. Lyttleton, and the late C. A. Teape. On their form that year Lubbock and Tritton could compare with almost any school batsmen, and against both Winchester and Harrow they did great things. At Cambridge the Hon. F. G. Pelham was in the eleven for four years, being captain in 1866 and 1867. He had the pleasure of taking part in some remarkable matches against Oxford, but only in 1867 was it his good fortune to be on the winning side. There was nothing surprising in this, however, the Oxford elevens of 1864 and 1865 being among the best ever sent up to Lord\"s. In 1864 T. S. Curteis-a fine left-handed fast bowler that season-was, with Pelham on at the other end, winning the game for Cambridge when R. A. H. Mitchell turned the scale, and by scoring 55 not out gave Oxford a four wickets\" victory. Small as it looks in these days, that 55 not out was always regarded as one of the finest innings Mitchell ever played, runs being very hard to get on the bad wickets at Lord\"s in 1864. In the following year- Mitchell\"s last in the University match- Oxford won easily by 114 runs, but in 1866 they only got home by 12 runs, after a very stern fight. Then, in 1867, Pelham tasted success at Lord\"s, a good all-round team beating Oxford by five wickets. Pelham had a notable share in the win, taking five wickets in Oxford\"s second innings for 32 runs. Altogether, in his four matches against Oxford he took twenty-six wickets-a better record than that of the Oxford slow bowler, W. F. Maitland, in the same games. Pelham played occasionally for Sussex, and was a member of the combined Surrey and Sussex eleven that met England at the Oval for Tom Lockyer\"s benefit in 1867. Thanks to the bowling of Emmett and W. G. Grace, England, though by no means at full strength-the leading Northern professionals keeping away from the Oval at that time-won by nine wickets. Pelham was born at Stanmer on October 18th, 1844, and entered the Church in 1869.\n\nMR. WALTER MORESBY CHINNERY, J.P., D.L., the father of Mr. H. B. Chinnery, died suddenly at Hatchford Park, Cobham, Surrey, on March 30th. As he was born on August 19th, 1843, he was sixty-one years of age at the time of his death. He was a splendid runner, especially at a mile, for which his best time, 4 minutes 29 seconds, was for some time the amateur record. He won the Mile Amateur Championship in 1868, 1869 and 1871, and the Four Miles in 1868 and 1869. He was buried at Hatchford, Cobham, on April 3rd. Though keenly interested in cricket he was not a prominent player.\n\nMAJOR R. A. CLEMENT, who was secretary to the Master of the Buckhounds, and Clerk of the Course at Ascot, died at Hove on October 2nd. He was in the Rugby XI. in 1851, 1852, and 1853, being captain in the last-mentioned year, and in 1854 he appeared for Cambridge in the University match. He was a useful bowler and a fair batsman. He was born on March 3rd, 1834.\n\nFREDERICK COWARD, an old Lancashire cricketer and some years back one of the regular County umpires, died at Preston in December. He was 63 years of age. He was brother of C. Coward who died in 1903.\n\nTHE REV. ARTHUR FRANCIS EMILIUS FORMAN, who was born at Gibraltar on July 26th, 1850, died of consumption at Repton on February 13th. He was a good all-round cricketer, but will be better remembered as a coach than as a player. For thirty years he was a master at Repton School, and, while he was there, many cricketers, who afterwards took part with success in the best matches of the day, passed through his hands. The best known of his pupils are Lionel Palairet, F. G. J. Ford, and C. B. Fry, and J. N. Crawford, who has played so well for Surrey during the last two seasons, bids fair to make a great name for himself both as batsman and bowler. Mr. Forman was in the Sherborne Eleven from 1866 to 1869, being contemporary with W. H. Game, but although he afterwards proceeded to Trinity College, Oxford, he did not succeed in obtaining his Blue. In 1877, 1878, 1879, and 1882 he occasionally appeared in the Derbyshire team, but did not meet with much success, his highest score being 32 against Sussex in 1882. He wrote many articles on Public School Cricket, a subject in which he was greatly interested and one which he dealt with most skillfully. He was a man of fine physique, standing 6ft. and weighing 13st. 8lbs.\n\nMR. SAMUEL GOODMAN, JUN., who was born at Philadelphia on February 6th, 1877, died at his native place on March 4th, death being due to spinal meningitis following pleuro-pneumonia and a bad strain caused by a fall in ju-jitsu. He played for Pennsylvania University in 1894-5-6, being captain the last year, and had for some time been one of the mainstays of the Philadelphia Club. A detailed biography and excellent portraits of this well-known player appeared in the April number of the American Cricketer.\n\nMR. WILLIAM HENRY HAIGH, probably the finest wicket-keeper ever identified with American cricket, died in Boston, U.S.A., on March 21st, at about the age of seventy. He was born at Halifax, in Yorkshire, and, prior to emigrating to America, earned a name for himself in this country as a wicket-keeper of more than average ability. It was said indeed that he could take the bowling of Tarrant, of Cambridge, better than any other man in England, which was certainly high praise. The late R. A. Fitzgerald, too, in Wickets in the West, spoke of him as by far the best man behind the sticks he saw during the tour of the Englishmen through America in 1872. He was interested in the game to the last.\n\nJ. H. INNS, who was born at Writtle, near Chelmsford, on March 30th, 1877 died at Leyton on June 14th. He was a good wicket-keeper, and was stated to be one of the finest fieldsmen in England. He was buried at Writtle on June 17th.\n\nMR. M. JONES, who was born at Penylan, Cardigan, on December 20th, 1829, died on June 2nd. He played for Harrow in 1845, 1846, and 1847, and for Oxford against Cambridge in the two following years. He obtained six wickets in an innings against Eton in 1845, and against Cambridge in 1850, whilst in the Eton v. Harrow match of 1847 he bowled down eight wickets (the other two being run out) in the first innings, and secured six (four clean bowled) in the second. It is to be regretted that no notice of this player appears in Scores and Biographies.\n\nTHOMAS LAMBERT, who had appeared for Northumberland and Durham County as both amateur and professional, died at Crown Street, Newcastle, on October 8th. He was a sound batsman and an excellent wicket-keeper, and had been asked to qualify for Lancashire. He was born at Durham on October 26th, 1862. Height, 5ft. 6ins.; weight, 14st. 6lbs.\n\nTHE REV. AUGUSTUS AUSTEN LEIGH, a member of the well-known cricket brotherhood, and a great nephew of Jane Austen, the novelist, died suddenly at Cambridge on January 28th, aged 64. He was born in Berkshire on July 17th, 1840, and educated at Eton and King\"s College, Cambridge. From 1893 to 1895 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University, and, at the time of his death, was President of the Cambridge University C.C. and Provost of King\"s College, having filled the latter position for fifteen years.\n\nTHE REV. GEORGE STRICKLAND MARRIOTT, a younger brother of Messrs. C. and J. M. Mariott, died on October 21st. He was in the Winchester XI. in 1872, 1873, and 1874, and in 1878 assisted Oxford against Cambridge. Scores and Biographies described him as A good batsman, bowls fast round-armed, whilst in the field he is generally point. From 1874 until 1885 his name will occasionally be found in the Leicestershire Eleven. He was born at Cotesbach, near Lutterworth, on October 7th, 1855.\n\nMR. GEORGE N. MARTIN, an old member of the Incogniti, died in August. He made many good scores for the Club, particularly in their annual tours in the Midlands.\n\nJOHN PARRATT, who was born on March 24th, 1859, died at Morley on May 5th, at the age of 46. He played twice for Yorkshire in 1882, twice in 1890, and once in 1891. In 1885 he was engaged at Selkirk, while in 1887 and 1888 he was with the Werneth Club. He was a useful all-round cricketer, and, at the time of his death, was landlord of the Royal Oak at Morley.\n\nJAMES PHILLIPS, a brother of Henry Phillips, the famous wicket-keeper, died on January 31st, at Hastings, where he was born on September 26th, 1849. He came into prominence by means of an innings of 103 for the Sussex Colts against Nine Gentlemen and Three Players of Sussex, at Brighton, on June 1st, 1871, and the same season witnessed his début in county cricket. Between 1871 and 1886 he appeared for Sussex in 67 matches, scoring 1,801 runs in 122 completed innings, average 14.76. His highest score was 89 against Hampshire, at Brighton, in 1882, when he and Mr. W. Newham, who scored 101, added 185 runs together for the sixth wicket. He never appeared in a Gentlemen v. Players match, but in 1878 was chosen to assist the Players against the First Australian Team at the Oval. This, as students of the game will readily recall, was the match in which the late E. Barratt took all ten of the Australians\" wickets in an innings without bowling down a single one. Phillips, too, had good reason to remember the match with gratification, for, although he was on the losing side (the Australians winning a close game by eight runs), his scores of 19 not out and 14 were the highest in each innings of the Players. He was the author of an interesting pamphlet on Hastings Cricket.\n\nTHE REV. H. A. PICKARD died in Banbury Road, Oxford, on September 29th. He was in the Rugby Eleven of 1851 with A. P. Law, and was born on May 12th, 1832.\n\nTOM PLUMB.-The death took place on March 29th of the once-famous wicket-keeper Tom Plumb. For some years he had been in very poor circumstances, and he passed away in the workhouse at Northampton. Born on July 26th, 1833, he was in his seventy-second year. To the present generation he was only a name, but cricketers whose memories go back as far as 1870 will remember him as a worthy rival of Pooley and the late George Pinder. His misfortune was that he did not belong to a leading county, his opportunities in first-class cricket being in consequence much restricted. It was always a disputed point whether he or George Pinder was the finer wicket-keeper to fast bowling. In a match at Lord\"s in 1870, between The United North and The United South Elevens, the late George Freeman-then in his prime, and beyond, question the best fast bowler of the day-was given his choice between the two men, and selected Plumb. Twice at least-in 1868 and 1869- Plumb appeared in the big match of the Canterbury Week, and fairly divided honours with Pooley. The match in 1868-between the North of the Thames and the South of the Thames-was a memorable one, the North winning by 58 runs, though W. G. Grace scored 130 and not out 102 for the South. For the winners the Rev. Joseph McCormick (now Canon McCormick) made 137 and 27; R. A. H. Mitchell, 22 and 90; and Plumb, 1 and 67. Plumb appeared in the Gentlemen v. Players match at Lord\"s in 1869 .\n\nMR. JONATHAN RASHLEIGH, who was born on January 7th, 1820, died on April 12th. He was in the Harrow Eleven of 1836, but, owing to illness, did not appear at Lord\"s. In 1842 he was in the Oxford side which was defeated by Cambridge by 162 runs, the winners receiving 81 extras in totals of 139 and 180.\n\nMR. HAROLD REYNOLDS, who at one time played successfully in Madras, died at Lahore on August 8th, from typhoid fever. In the late eighties he was identified with the Kensington Park C.C.\n\nTHE REV. CHARLES HENRY RIDDING, elder brother of Messrs. Arthur and William Ridding, died at Kneller Court, Fareham, on March 13th. He will always be remembered as a splendid wicket-keeper and long-stop, never using pads or gloves. He was, in addition, a good steady batsman. He played for Winchester in 1842 and 1843, for Oxford against Cambridge in 1845-6-7-8-9, and for the Gentlemen v. Players from 1848 to 1853. He scored 33 and 26 against Cambridge in 1848, and 27 not out and 14 the following year. Owing to his profession-the Church-he was obliged to discontinue the game much earlier than he otherwise would have done. In the Gentlemen v. Players match at Lord\"s in 1849 he performed the extraordinary feat of stumping Hillyer off the terrific bowling of Mr. Harvey Fellows. His principal scores in important matches were 75 for Oxford University v. Cowley, at Oxford, in 1847; 63 for Oxford University v. Clapton, at Clapton, in 1846; 63 for Gentlemen of Hampshire v. Gentlemen of Sussex, at Brighton, in 1858; and 53 for Oxford University v. Cowley, at Oxford, in 1848. He was born at Winchester on November 26th, 1825, was 5ft. 5½ins. in height, and weighed 10st. 9lbs. His name will be found in the Oxfordshire XI. from 1859 to 1864, and in that of Hampshire from 1861 to 1865. He occasionally played under the assumed name of Charles.\n\nMR. EDMUND BUTLER ROWLEY, who died on February 8th, in Manchester, was born in that city on May 4th, 1842. He was the fourth of seven cricketing brothers, the most famous of whom was Mr. A. B. Rowley. Scores and Biographies says (Vol. X., page 64)- Is a fine free hitter, and has made excellent scores in the North, though he has not often appeared South. In the field he is generally short- slip. He learnt his cricket at Rossall School, and assisted Lancashire from 1864 until 1880, during which period he played 134 innings for the county, scoring 1665 runs with an average of 13.21. After handing over the captaincy of the team to Mr. A. N. Hornby, he continued to take the greatest possible interest in everything connected with Lancashire cricket, and served on the County Committee until his death. His most notable feat was an innings of 219 for the Gentlemen of Lancashire against the Gentlemen of Yorkshire, at Manchester, in July, 1867. At the Oval in 1862, when only twenty years of age, he made two splendid scores of 61 and 70 for the Gentlemen of the North against the Gentlemen of the South, and in the same year he was chosen to assist in the Gentlemen v. Players match at the Surrey ground. By profession he was a solicitor.\n\nMR. JOHN SCOTT SCULLY, of the Belmont Cricket Club, Philadelphia, died at White Haven, Pa., on March 20th, at the early age of twenty-two. He was nephew of the two well-known international cricketers, Walter and Dr. J. Allison Scott. He graduated at Pennsylvania University, where he played cricket, football, baseballl and lawn tennis with success.\n\nCOL. JAMES SIMONDS, the original Hon. Treasurer of the Berkshire County Cricket Club, died at Redlands, Reading, on November 22nd, in his 57th year, the cause of death being dropsy.\n\nFREDERICK SMITH, who had a somewhat extended trial in the Yorkshire eleven two years ago, and had lately been associated as a three-quarter back with the Bramley Football Club, died on October 21st. He caught cold a week before through travelling back to Nelson in wet clothes after playing for Bramley, and pneumonia quickly set in. A left handed batsman, Smith took part in twelve matches for Yorkshire in 1903, scoring 292 runs with an average of 16. This was a very fair record for a new man, but, as he did not play in 1904, except in a few second eleven matches, he was presumably not thought good enough for a regular place in the county team. His best scores for Yorkshire were 55 against Kent at Leeds, and 51 against Somerset at Bradford. He was born at Yeadon on December 18, 1880, and at the time of his death was qualifying for Lancashire.\n\nTHE REV. JOHN DE SOYRES, Rector of St. John the Evangelist\"s, St. John\"s, New Brunswick, who died suddenly on February 3rd, while undergoing an operation, was a great lover of cricket. He was born in Somerset in 1849, and educated at Brighton College and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he had a most distinguished career. He went out to New Brunswick in 1888, and had made for himself a reputation as the most distinguished preacher in Eastern canada. He was a nephew of Edward Fitzgerald, the translator of Omar Kahayyam.\n\nMR. RICHARD STACEY SPENCER, formerly of Birchanger, Essex, died of malarial fever in South Africa on January 26th, at the age of 55. He was educated at Bishop Stortford, and played occasionally for Hertfordshire. For many years he was Hon. Sec. of the Rickling Green C.C.\n\nMR. WILLIAM FREDRICK TRAILL, who was born at Lewisham, in Kent, on January 7th, 1838, died on October 3rd. He was educated at merchant Taylors\" School and at Oxford, and was in the latter eleven in 1858 and two following years. Against Cambridge in 1860 he took eleven wickets for 53 runs-six for 35 and five for 18-but Oxford lost a low-scoring game by three wickets. He appeared on a few occasions for the Gentlemen against the Players between 1859 and 1867, and assisted Kent eleven times-in 1860, 1861, 1862, 1863, and 1866. His dêbut in inter-county cricket-against Sussex at Turnbridge Wells in 1860-was a very successful one, seeing that he scored 49 runs in the only innings he had, and obtained eight wickets for 68. Scores and Biographies (Vol. vi., p. 48) says of him:- A capital round-armed bowler, middle-paced, with an easy delivery...... Also an excellent batsman, and fields well.\n\nJOHN TYE, who was born at Bulwell, Notts, on July 10th, 1848, died at Brighouse in the last week of November. Scores and Biographies described him as a good hard hitter, and a very fast and bumpy round-armed bowler. In 1874 he appeared on a few occasions for Derbyshire, and it was not until 1876 that he assisted his native county. He played for Nottinghamshire six times in 1877, and twice in 1878 and 1881. His highest score was 48 v. Gloucestershire, at Clifton, in 1876, and his best bowling performance nine wickets for 101 v. Lancashire, at Manchester, the same year. For nearly a quarter of a century he had been connected with the Brighouse Club.\n\nGEORGE UBSDELL died at the Palatine Hotel, Ganton, near Liverpool, on October 15th. Born at Southampton on April 4th, 1845, he was for many years a prominent member of the Hampshire XI. Scores and Biographies says of him (Vol. ix., p. 378):- Is an excellent hitter to all parts of the field, especially to the off, bowls round-armed, middle-paced, and is also a capital wicket-keeper.In the match at Southampton, in August, 1865, between Hampshire and Surrey, he caught one and stumped five of the latter in a single innings, the Surrey total realising only 37. After relinquishing first-class cricket, Ubsdell was for twelve years groundman of the Liverpool C.C., at Aigburth. Height, 5ft. 6ins.; weight, 10st.\n\nMR. PERCY WALLIS, one of the oldest members of the Derbyshire Committee, and a Vice-President of the County club, died on December 6th.\n\nTHE REV. E. W. R. WALTERS, Vicar of Heddon-on-the-Wall, died on January 1st, at the age of 43. He was educated at Ardingly and Oxford, but did not gain a place in the eleven whilst at the University.
