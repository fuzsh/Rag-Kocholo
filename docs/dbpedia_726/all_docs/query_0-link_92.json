        "text": "H @nelson and welcome to the forum.\n\nWilliam Robert Nelson, Edit Colmer born circa 1897, was subsequently transferred to the Labour Corps, with service number 280313. Find My Past have indexed service records for him under the Labour Corps service number, and they should also be available on Ancestry. Unfortunately I don't subscribe to either site, so can't check them out further.\n\nHopefully others that do have access can give you a heads up if there are any details there that might help with your search.\n\n1 hour ago, nelson said:\n\nor his family as I would like to return the medal to the them.\n\nA noble ambition but one that could prove frustrating. Tracking descendants requires a genealogist and a great deal of perseverance - I and others on the forum have enough problems when it comes to finding descendants of men who the official government body have now accepted as being amongst the deceased of the Great War, (the missed commemorations), or where after a great deal of research it's been possible to put a name to the grave of an unknown British soldier. Even then there is no guarantee that they will be interested.\n\nSaying which it is doable. If you are able to place him in his time and family, then always worth a check for family trees on Ancestry, as at least they will have been prepapred by someone in the family who might be interested.\n\nGood luck with your quest,\n\nPeter\n\nEdited 19 June , 2022 by PRC\n\nSenior moment\n\nThere is only one likely candidate in the civil birth records for England & Wales - the birth of a William Robert Colmer was registered with the civil authorities in the St. Olave Bermondsey District of London in the April to June quarter, (Q2), of 1897. Mothers' maiden name is Richards.\n\nThe most likely death record, (Lewisham District Q4 1971), shows his date of birth as the 2nd April 1897.\n\nBut there is no straight match for him on the 1901 or 1911 Census of England & Wales, but nor is there a death record from this time that might account for it.\n\nThe 1921 Census of England & Wales does have a William Robert Colmer, born Bermondsey and birth year calculated as 1897, who was recorded in the Camberwell Registration District.\n\nAnd with that its possible to find him on the earlier censues - both times recorded as Robert. On the 1911 Census, aged 14 and born Bermondsey, he was recorded living at 6 Meeting House Lane, Camberwell, Surrey (London ) SE. His parents were William, (aged 38, Tailors Cutter, born Camberwell) and Emma, (aged 34 and born Bermondsey).\n\nThe couple state they have been married 15 years. (The marriage of a William Stanley Colmer to an Emma Elizabeth Richards was registered with the Civil Authorities in the St Olave Southwark District in Q2 1896).\n\nThe union is stated to have produced 5 children, of which 3 were then still alive. As well as (William) Robert the other two children living with them are:-\n\nAlbert Colmer, aged 11, born Bermondsey. (The birth of an Albert Henry Colmer, mothers' maiden name Richards, was registered with the civil authorities in the Camberwell District in Q3 1899. Most likely died in the Lewisham District in Q1 1959).\n\nGeorge Colmer, aged 3, born Bermondsey. (The birth of an Eric George Colmer, mothers' maiden name Richards, was registered with the civil authorities in the St Olave Bermondsey District in Q3 1907. Most likely died in the Camberwell District in Q4 1934).\n\nPossible additional children born subsequently.\n\nEdith Ethel Colmer. Q4 1911, mothers' maiden name Richards, Camberwell District. (Most likely married an Albert H. Gowen in the Camberwell District in Q4 1933. Most likely death as Edith Ethel Gowen, born 7th September 1911, in the Brent District of Middlesex in Q4 1979. You had 42 days after the event to register the birth, which was then reported in quarter registered, which isn't automatically the same as quarter born. So a birth at the start of September and registration in Q4 is not incompatible).\n\nAlfred Charles Colmer. Q2 1913, mothers' maiden name Richards, Camberwell District. (Most likely the death of a 25 year old Alfred C Colmer registered in the Lewisham District in Q2 1938).\n\nHelena Elsie Colmer. Q3 1914, mothers' maiden name Richards, Camberwell District.(Most likely married an Eric R. Andrews in the Lewisham District in Q2 1936. No obvious death in England & Wales up to 2007).\n\nStanley Victor Colmer. Q4 1915, mothers' maiden name Richards, Camberwell District. (Most likely death was in the Lewisham District in Q2 1971, when his date of birth was recorded as the 9th November 1915).\n\nGrace Constance Colmer. Q3 1917, mothers' maiden name Richards, Camberwell District. (Most likely married a John W. Bethell in the Lewsisham District in Q3 1938. The death of a Crace Constance Bethell, born 28th May 1917, was registered in the Banbury District in Q4 1990).\n\n_________________________________\n\nThe FMP indexing of the 1939 Register shows a William R. Colmer but with no year of birth transcribed. He was living at 18 Scott's Lane, Beckenham. From the indexing there doesn't appear to be anyone else living at that address. Worth investigating further, but could be that William may have no direct descendants and so \"nearest\" family will come by investigating the siblings set out above.\n\nThe UK Probate Service doesn't seem to have any probate details for the man who died in the Lewisham District in 1971.\n\nHope some of that helps, if only to benchmark the Ancestry family tree against.\n\nPeter\n\nEdited 19 June , 2022 by PRC\n\nTypos"
