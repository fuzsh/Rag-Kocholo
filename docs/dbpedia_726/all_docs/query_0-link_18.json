The office was originally created in 1900 when the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham was formed by the London Government Act 1899. The Metropolitan Borough was absorbed into the larger London Borough of Lewisham in 1965, and the office of Mayor continued for the new authority. In 2002 a directly-elected Mayor of Lewisham was introduced, and the existing office of mayor, whose duties included chairing council meetings and representing the borough in a ceremonial capacity, was renamed \"Chair of the Council\" and then \"Speaker\".\n\nMetropolitan borough (1900-1965)[]\n\n1900-01: Theophilus William Williams\n\n1901-02: Theophilus William Williams (second term)\n\n1902-03: William Brown\n\n1903-04: George Septimus Warmington\n\n1904-05: Thomas White [6]\n\n1905-06: Arthur William Hiscox - [7], [8] and [9]; author of a history of the borough [10]\n\n1906-07: Ernest Cantelo Burt Philpott\n\n1907-08: William Burrell\n\n1908-09: Henry Percival Stebbing 1863-1910\n\n1909-10: Edward Ball [11]\n\n1910-11: Henry Adolphus Baxter 1853-1935\n\n1911-12: William Henry Le May\n\n1912-13: Robert Gordon Brew 1859-1937\n\n1913-14: Robert Jackson - was in Germany in August 1914.\n\n1914-15: Robert Jackson (second term)\n\n1915-16: Allan Hume Nicholl 1866-1941 [12], [13] and [14]\n\n1916-17: Allan Hume Nicholl (second term)\n\n1917-18: Allan Hume Nicholl (third term)\n\n1918-19: Allan Hume Nicholl (fourth term)\n\n1919-20: Harry Chiesman [15] and [16]1861-1940\n\n1920-21: Thomas Richard Roberts\n\n1921-22: Charles Henry Dodd 1869-1955\n\n1922-23: Charles Henry Dodd (second term)\n\n1923-24: James Frederick Griffith\n\n1924-25: James Frederick Griffith (second term)\n\n1925-26: Edwin William Hayes [17]\n\n1926-27: Albert Edward Webb\n\n1927-28: Henry John Furneaux 13 February 1892-1975\n\n1928-29: John Thomas Hallinan - 6 of his 7 children became doctors.
