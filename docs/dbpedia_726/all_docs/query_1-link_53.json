In 1891, he and his wife Ellen along with their 11 children were living at 2 Longfellow's road, George was then a retired met police inspector and was working as a school board inspector. In 1901 the family were then living at 112 Albert road, Walthamstow. Does anyone know's if these addresses and even the houses still exsist?\n\nMy great grandmother Alice Dowdeswell married Ernest Jeffery on the 1st august 1900 in St Stephen's church, Walthamstow, which I think no longer exsists.\n\nIn 1891 Ernest, aged 14, was an assistant in a lace warehouse. He was living at 39 Cuthbert street, Walthamstow, with parents Jane and John. In 1911 he and Alice, his wife, were living at 59 Grove road, Walthamstow. They had 6 children, 3 of whom were triplets: Muriel Faith, Phyllis Hope and Winifred Charity Jeffery. Winifred died at 5 month's old..... Ernest was still working in the drapery trade as a manufacturers agent. In 1926 Ernest, then aged 47, left his family, apparently for a younger woman - possibly Henrietta Ada Rich????....no one knows where he went after his departure, did he stay in walthamstow or surrounding area???..\n\nIf anyone knows anything about the above names, I would love to hear...

My gt uncle John Royall Minns married Annie Elizabeth Dames at St Mary's church, Walthamstow in Sept 1888. He was described as a cook living at 9 Ravenswood Road and she as a servant of the same address. They subsequently emigrated to the USA via Australia and the Falkland Islands. The American side of the family have always believed that they were married in a church that was \"owned\" or on land owned by the Royall Minns family. Can anybody throw any light on this story? Or tell me if Ravenswood Rd still exists? I believe the Dames were cabinet makers in the area. Thanking you in anticipation.
