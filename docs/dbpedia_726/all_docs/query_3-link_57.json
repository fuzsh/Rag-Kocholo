        "text": "George Herbert Clarke, professor and author, was born at Gravesend, County Kent, England, on August 27, 1873. At the age of eight he moved with his family to Toronto. In 1891 he received a B.A. with honours from McMaster University and in 1896 received his M.A., also from McMaster. From 1897 to 1901 Dr. Clarke did editorial work in Chicago. He then began an academic career with professorships at Mercier University, Georgia, (1901 to 1905), Peabody College, Tennessee (1908-11) and University of Tennessee and University of the South to 1925. From 1925 to 1943 Dr. Clarke was head of the Department of English at Queen's University. From 1925 he was a member of the editorial committee of the Queen's Quarterly, becoming Editor-In-Chief in 1944. He retained this position until 1953, the year of his death. Honours which Dr. Clarke received during his lifetime included an LL.D. from McMaster University (1923), a D.C.L. from Bishop's University (1944), an LL.D. from Queen's (1943), and a Lorne Pierce Medal from the Royal Society of Canada (1943). He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1930."
