        "text": "Funeral services will be at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, January 9, 2024 at the Peterson – Johnson Funeral Home in Milaca for Eugene C. Herbert, 93 of Foreston who passed away peacefully at the Fairview Princeton Hospital on January 1, 2024 surrounded by his family. Pastor Kate Mensing will officiate and the burial will follow at Forest Hill Cemetery. Pallbearers will be sons David Herbert and Jim Herbert, grandchildren Michael Herbert and Michael Timmer, son-in-laws Dwayne Timmer and Donn Eggen. Friends may call from 5 – 7 p.m. on Monday January 8, 2024 at the Peterson-Johnson Funeral Home and one hour before the service Tuesday. A luncheon will be provided at the Zion Lutheran Church following the burial.\n\nGene was born on June 20, 1930 to George and Ruby (Haskins) Herbert in Oak Park,\n\nMN. Gene attended District #16 School in rural Oak Park, MN and then Milaca High School. In 1949 Gene chose to enlist in the U.S. Army and proudly served in Japan during the Korean Conflict.\n\nGene was united in marriage July 19, 1952 to Betty Ann Warner and the couple lived in the home they built in Foreston. To this union six children were born. Gene worked in the Twin Cities as a union roofer and then a union sheet metal worker retiring at 62 to enjoy fishing, yard work, playing cards, visiting with friends and spending time with family. Even after Betty passed away in 2008 Gene was able to remain in his home in Foreston until he passed.\n\nGene was a lifelong member of the American Legion Post in Milaca #178 and Foley #298 receiving his 50 year membership recognition in 2018. He also served many years on the City of Foreston Planning and Zoning Board. Gene took immense pride in his home and its surroundings, the lawn was always a top priority, that and a mean game of cribbage! Gene never missed his weekly cribbage games at Burns’ with Jim, Bob, Marvin, Mike with Audrey providing her homemade treats and overseeing the game.\n\nGene is survived by sons and daughters, Patty Johnson (Donn Eggen), Peggy (Dwayne) Timmer, David, Nancy (Leroy) Scott, Jim (Terrie); 15 grandchildren, 24 great grandchildren, sister-in-law Jean Bruggeman and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his wife Betty (2008); his son Curt (2018), his grandson Justin Johnson (2014), his parents George and Ruby; his brothers Vernon, Gerald and Donald; his sisters Eleanor and Joyce along with all of their spouses."
