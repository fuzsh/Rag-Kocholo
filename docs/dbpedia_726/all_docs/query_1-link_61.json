        "text": "​(1764-1846)\n\nRICHARD BECHER, the eldest son of Richard Becher and Ann Haselby, was born 15th March 1764 and baptised two days later at St Andrews, Holborn. His Godparents were Richard Becher, R. Porter and Anne Haselby.\n\nHis father obtained an East India Company nomination for him, and his brother Robert, and they were appointed as Writers on 31st May 1781 with rank from October that year. The three of them went out to India that autumn and Richard joined the Bengal Civil Service. He held several appointments including Commercial Chief at Cossimbazaar in 1783. The records are then incomplete until his appointment as Commercial Resident at Commercolly on 5th March 1790. He was out of employment in 1801 but became Commercial Resident at Bareilly on 16th July 1802; Third Member of the Board of Trade 20th May 1805; Acting Salt Agent of Tumlook 28th October 1808 and Salt Agent at Tumlook on 26th January 1809. He resigned on 30th January 1815 in India.\n\n​\n\n​In 1786 he was described as being 'of Portman Square' when he and his brother John and George Peters (my 5x maternal great grandfather) each donated £21 to the Magdalen Hospital which had been founded a decade earlier just off Blackfriars Road, south east London. This sum also conferred on them the Governorship of the hospital for life.\n\nRichard Becher's visiting card is part of a historical collection at the British Museum and can be seen lower centre in the photo on the left.\n\nHe had seven children prior to his marriage with Frances Wyatt of whom the boys were initially given the surname of Stephens and it was only later that Robert made a statutory declaration stating that his sons were in fact true born and 'for very particular reasons' were baptised as Stephens.\n\nHe married Frances Wyatt on 12th August 1815 at St Marylebone. She was born about 1773 at Elham, Kent. The local press on 16th February 1815 carried this announcement:\n\nNOTICE is hereby given, that Mr. ROBERT BECHER has admitted Mr. RICHARD BECHER, and his son, Mr. JOHN BECHER, in Partnership, and that the Firm will be Messrs. BECHER & CO. from this date; and it is further hereby notifoed that in consequence of Mr. RICHARD and Mr. ROBERT BECHERS'S intention to return immediately to Europe, the business of the above Firm will, until the return of Mr. ROBERT BECHER, be conducted by Mr. JOHN BECHER, Junior.\n\nRICH. BECHER\n\nROBT. BECHER,\n\nJ. BECHER.\n\nCalcutta, January 21, 1815\n\nHe is recorded in the 1841 Census at Speldhurs, Kent, although living at Chancellor House\n\nRichard Becher died 9th April 1846 at his residence at 17 Portland Place, Brighton and was buried there. Frances also died there on 6th February 1855.\n\nThe details for all seven children are given below except for Robert Stephens Becher whose details which are here.\n\nJohn Becher (1791-1842)\n\nRobert Becher (1791-1841\n\nCharlotte Becher (1795-1815)\n\nGeorge (c.1795-1826)\n\nHarriet Becher (1807-1842)\n\nWilliam Augustus Becher (1813-1879)\n\nSarah Frances (1815-1820)\n\n1. JOHN BECHERwas born in 1791 and baptised 27th May 1791 at Burrampore. He was a Merchant and Free Mariner. It is not known when he sailed to England where he had a residence in Penge. He was a member of the United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies and in their directory entry of 1815 John Becher is listed as living at 2 Connaught Place, 9 Cumberland Gate, London. His firm was one of the oldest in the city and was first known as Becher, (G.) Mackintosh & Co. of 7 Clive Street, Ghaut, Calcutta; then Becher, (Henry) Chapman & Co. of 6 Old Court House Street, Calcutta; and then after John Becher's death in 1842 it became Chapman, (Edward Pryce) Griffiths & Co. of 9 Hasting's Street, Calcutta. He was also, with his son Major Robert Becher, a member and shareholder of the Bengal Tea Association in 1839.\n\nHe married EmilyFoulkes 28th July 1826 at St Mary Bredin, Canterbury. She was the daughter of John Foulkes of Elstead, Surrey. According to John's Will, he set sail for England on or shortly after 9th March 1840. He died 16th March 1842 at Singapore on his passage from Bombay to Calcutta on board the Forth. He was buried there on 16th March 1843.\n\nBack in England, his wife moved to 12 Stanhope Place, London and later married on 16th January 1851 John Leigh Williams at Richmond, Surrey who predeceased her. At the time of her second son's death in 1857, she was living at 3, Westcliff Gardens, Folkestone, Kent. She died 9th October 1870 at Isleworth,\n\nThey had six children:\n\n1. Major-General ALFRED BECHER who was born 28th July 1825 at St Pancras, London and was educated at Edward Trimmer's school on Upper Richmond road, Putney, Surrey along with two of his younger brothers. By the time he applied for an East India Company Cadetship on 7th December 1842 his father had died and he was unable to prove his age as there was no entry in the Parish Register so he was deemed to be 'not under 16 or over 22'.\n\nHe sailed to India and on 11th Sept 1843 he transhipped at Bombay for Karachi on the steam frigate Auckland. He was a Cornet when he transferred to the 5th Bengal Light Infantry but owing to a shortage of officers he was brought in as a Lieutenant on 28th March 1829.\n\nHe summarised his own career in support of his son's later application for a Cadetship:\n\n‘On going out I joined the 8th Regt Bombay N.I. and served with it in Sinde during 43-44 and 45. Also in the Mutiny in 57 and 58 in which year I had to come home with medical certificate from fever contracted from exposure. I proceeded with the same regiment for the Abyssinian Campaign, but being in the last brigade reached too late, and never landed. I was adjutant of this regiment for some years. On the re-organisation of the Native Army about 1861 I obtained the appointment of Second-in-Command of the 8th Regt, came home on furlough in 1871 for about 18 months. Received command of the 26th Regt N.I. in about 1874, which I retained till '77 when ill health obliged me to come home - and owing to failing health was induced to retire from Service in 1878 instead of returning which was my wish in order to obtain full Colonel's allowances at the end of this year which I would have been entitled to (NB I'm unable to give exact dates, not having any records by me). I am most anxious to obtain this cadetship as I cannot afford to meet the high charges that are exacted by those who prepare candidates for the high standard of education now required at the Competitive Examinations - at the same time as having my younger son to educate also.'\n\nHe married Caroline Maria Morse 22nd June 1858 at St Mary Abbott's, Kensington by Rev. Philip S. Desprey, the uncle of the bride. She was born in Bombay 11th February 1838 the daughter of Major Henry Charles Morse (8th Regiment, Bombay N.I.) and Penelope Gabriell Desprey. She is in the 1871 Census living at Melbourne House, Chapel Road, Broadwater, Worthing, Sussex with their four children. Alfred was then a Colonel stationed in India. On 12th November 1871 he disembarked at Southampton having sailed from Bombay via Alexandria, Malta and Gibraltar aboard the Poonah. Alfred and his wife are both in the 1881 Census living at Lexington, Beckenham, Kent with their family. In the 1891 Census they are still in Beckenham at Crystal Palace Park Road plus their children Rose, Lily and Percy (this last name appears to be an error as his actual name was Edward). She died in 1894 at Lewisham, London. He died 26th September 1901 at Hawthorndene, Longton Avenue, Sydenham, Kent. His obituary in the Woolwich Gazette recorded that General Alfred Becher, late of the East India Company's service, and of the Bombay Staff Corps, whose death at his residence, Hawthorndene, Longton-avenue, Sydenham was announced last week, entered the East India Army in December, 1812, and obtained the rank of Major in September, 1848, and that of Lieutenant Colonel in December, 1888. He commanded the 18th Bombay Native Infantry, reached the brevet rank of Colonel in December, 1873, and was placed on the Retired List in August, 1878, receiving the honorary rank of Major General in the following November.\n\nThere were four children:\n\n1. Rose Blanche Becher born 5th August 1859 at Harvey Villa, Elham, Nr Folkestone, Kent. In 1891 at Lewisham she married Joseph Osborn Grout (1858-1904) on 14th June 1891 at St Philip's, Sydenham. He was born in Standon, Herts, the son of Joseph Grout and Maria Isabella Hippisley, of The Mount, Braughing, Hertfordshire. She died 8th October 1938 then of 4 Longton Avenue, Sydenham and was buried at Elmers End Cemetery.\n\n2. Millie Becher (or Lily) born 9th November 1860 at Sattara, Bombay, India and lived in various parts of S.E. England and died 31st October 1927 at St Margaret's, Twickenham.\n\n3. Edward Alfred Morse Becher born 12th October 1862 Shalapore, Bombay and named after Henry Charles Morse, a Colonel in the Bombay Staff Corps.\n\nHe started out as an actor and adopted the professional name of O'Neill Edward and lived at Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea. He ran into financial difficulty after the failure of various theatrical ventures mostly in the provinces. The Times reported bankruptcy proceedings on 9th January 1899 where it stated that he was living at Wharton Road, Kensington and that he had put on an Ibsen play which ran for 30 weeks but made a loss causing the bankruptcy.\n\nThe following month, on 25th February 1899 The Times reported that he had incurred a loss of £400 producing the play 'The Red Squadron' and he had contracted liabilities of between £400 and £600 during production of the piece 'No Appeal' which ran for three weeks only. His income had amounted to £240 over the last twelve months as four relatives depended on him for support. It is not known what the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceedings were. He went on to appear in more than thirty plays and films between 1911 and 1929.\n\nHe married, firstly, Rose Adela Elizabeth Meller on 19th December 1891 at Wandsworth. She was was an actress born 1862 in Lambeth to Thomas Meller and Elizabeth.\n\nA number of her roles were reviewed in The Stage. From 11-15th May, 1891, she played Mrs Elida Wangel in Ibsen's 'Lady from the Sea' (which had been adapted and translated by Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Kark Marx's daughter) at Terry's theatre in the Strand, London, on part of the site of the present-day Cole Hole pub. She also played the Matinees; her manager was Mr C. St John Denton.\n\nThe Echo reported that 'Rather odd paragraphs have been copied from our paper by another relative to the theatrical career of the recently-married Miss Rose Meller. She is stated to have advanced the cause of Ibsen and played a leading part in 'The Doll's House.' Miss Meller was responsible for the production of the Master's 'The Lady from the Lake' at Terry's one afternoon. She was Elida. We have always held that she did the British drama a service on that occasion; but we should not have said she advanced the cult of Ibsen.\n\nFrom 28th January to 5th March, 1892, she played Lady Isobel in John C. Chute's 'East Lynne' at the Olympic Theatre, Drury Lane, managed by Mr John Cleman. The review said she was 'A young actress who will make her mark. In addition to possessing good looks and voice, there is evident intelligence combined with earnestness and capability expressing the deepest feeling. Mr Edward O'Neill, another promising actor, is good as Levison.'\n\nShe was a adherent of the methods of the Frenchman Francois Delsarte who laid stress on the connection between mental attitude and physical posture and how one's emotional state is communicated through one's physical appearance. In 1913 she became a Delsarte teacher at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and published numerous articles on Delsarte's methods in the journal 'Focus' including a major work 'The Science and Art of Speech and Gesture' in 1927.\n\nHe, his wife, and daughter are recorded in the 1901 Census living at 125 Keppel Street, Chelsea. In 1911 she wrote the 3-act comedy 'Dick the Benedick.' They divorced in 1917.\n\nThere was one child: Olive Daune Becher, seen left, born 18th March 1894 in Kensington, London who was also an actress. In 1920 she sailed to New York on the Adriatic and on the passenger list her next of kin was given as her mother: Mrs O'Neill, c/o T. F. Jephart, Stadion, Chelsea, London whose wife was Elizabeth Florence, nee Chipperfield.. Olive died 22nd April 1966 at Dartmouth, Devon.\n\nThis 1917 painting of her by George Washington Lambert, left, was sold at Sotheby's, Australia, for £22,480 in May 2013.\n\nHe married, secondly Josephe Mary de Paniagua, daughter of Jean Didier André de Paniagua and Henriette Simard in 1917 at Brentford, Essex. According to the 1936 Electoral Roll he was then living with his second wife at 6 The Barons, St Margaret's, Twickenham. He died 19th August 1938 at Brentford.

Whether I gain my object or fail in it, to you I shall ever feel equally indebted for the very kind and friendly interest you have shown in my behalf. Most willingly and happily would I adopt your plan of leaving my sister at Simla and returning to ?? it was a measure which occurred to me before I include my application for leave - but - I know/knew ? there with whom I could make such an arrangement. And my sister's case is such that requires far more nursing and attendance than a mere acquaintance would devote to her. As said before, hers is a case of life or death and unless her husband could be with her I would not leave her for the world. I have replied to Colonel Lumley's letter by this opportunity in the way you have kindly suggested and I was almost adding another paragraph to it bringing to H. Fane's notice that if I can put in General Orders for leave although I should lose half my staff salary. I shall have to do my work precisely the same as if I were at Kurnaul. I have been too well drilled in the world sense to be particularly sanguine or anxious about any worldly matter but I confess I am inclined to think that Sir Henry Fane* will not allow your kind exertions in my behalf to be overlooked if he can possibly help it.\n\nOnce more I tender you my grateful thanks. And remain My dear Colonel.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nRobt. Becher\n\nP.S.
