        "text": "An internationally famous and well respected bodybuilder / actor, Lou Ferrigno first appeared on TV screens in 1977 as the musclebound title character of Der unglaubliche Hulk (1977), the alter ego of meek scientist David Banner. Ferrigno was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1951 and as a child suffered from an ear infection that resulted in permanent partial hearing loss. Undeterred by what some may have perceived as a disadvantage, Lou threw himself into athletics (predominantly weightlifting and body building) and at the age of 21 won his first Mr. Universe title. For good measure, he came back and won it again the following year!\n\nHe also played professional football in the Canadian Football League, before coming to the attention of producer Kenneth Johnson, who was seeking just the right person to portray on screen the comic book superhero, The Incredible Hulk. With his 6'5\", 285 lbs. frame, Lou was the biggest professional bodybuilder of the time, and had recently starred in the documentary Pumping Iron (1977), about the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest in South Africa. He successfully auditioned for the part of the green-skinned Goliath, and that is the role with which he is most closely identified.\n\n\"The Hulk\" was a huge ratings success and spawned several telemovies after the initial TV series completed its run. Lou continued to remain busy in films and TV with appearances often centered around his remarkable physique. His films included Herkules (1983), Sinbad - Herr der sieben Meere (1989) and Frogtown II (1992). Lou has additionally guest-starred on several TV shows including Ein Colt für alle Fälle (1981) and Mike Hammer (1984) and had a recurring role on King of Queens (1998). In 1997 he was featured in the dynamic documentary about his sensational return to professional bodybuilding at age 43, Stand Tall (1997). The film detailed how he returned to compete in the Masters category of the Mr. Olympia contest against several familiar bodybuilding foes. In more recent years, he has appeared in several films, including The Misery Brothers (1995), Ping! (2000), From Heaven to Hell (2002) and a cameo as a security guard in the big-budget remake of Hulk (2003).\n\nBig Lou is also a successful author with two books detailing his bodybuilding knowledge, and his life behind the scenes playing the Incredible Hulk on TV in the 1970s, plus he has a popular website frequented by his many fans worldwide.\n\nFrom Timothy Olyphant's first screen appearances, such as his two-minute bit in Der Club der Teufelinnen (1996), to \"Nicko\", whose presence at times dwarfed the island in A Perfect Getaway (2009), he has been a force to be reckoned with.\n\nBorn in Hawaii, Timothy David Olyphant was raised in Modesto, California. He is the son of Katherine Lyon (Gideon) and John Vernon Bevan Olyphant, a college teacher who was also an executive at E & J Gallo Winery. He has an older brother, Andy, who is in A&R for Warner Bros. Records, and a younger brother, Matt Olyphant, who was the lead singer for the punk rock group, Fetish, and is also an artist. He is a descendant of the prominent Vanderbilt and Olyphant families of businesspeople, and his ancestry includes Russian Jewish (from a maternal great-grandfather), English, German, Scottish, Dutch, and Irish. Timothy quickly became Modesto's favorite son, competing as a pro swimmer and excelling at drawing. It was, by chance, that he enrolled in an acting course as an elective and decided to pursue an acting career. He took his family and headed to New York City, where he studied the craft and began auditioning for roles. From the beginning, he tried to choose diversified roles and take chances with every genre and always approached everything he did with commitment, humor and grace. Timothy is married to his college sweetheart, Alexis Knief, and, together, they raise three children, one son and two daughters in California. He has managed to keep his personal life out of the tabloids. He obviously has his priorities straight, as this is no easy task in Hollywood.\n\nHighlights of Olyphant's career include his riveting portrayal of \"Sheriff Seth Bullock\" in HBO's hit drama, Deadwood (2004). He now personifies intensity as complex Kentucky Marshal, \"Raylan Givens\", in FX's Justified (2010). On the big screen, in 2010's The Crazies - Fürchte deinen Nächsten (2010), he had the chance to infuse his character with doubts, fears and humaneness in an inhumane situation. Mr. Olyphant proved he could carry a major movie on his talent, alone. He recently appeared in Ich bin Nummer Vier (2011), a sci-if thriller, in which Tim provided the adult mentorship, taking a back seat to the teen cast.\n\nLena Headey is a Bermudian-British actress. Headey is best known for her role as \"Cersei Lannister\" in Game of Thrones: Das Lied von Eis und Feuer (2011) (2011-2019) and Brothers Grimm (2005), Besessen (2002), and Was vom Tage übrig blieb (1993). Headey stars as \"Queen Gorgo,\" a heroic Spartan woman in the period film, 300 (2006), by director Zack Snyder.\n\nHeadey was born in Hamilton, Bermuda, to British parents Sue and John Headey. Her father, a Yorkshire police cadet, was stationed in the Bermuda Police Service. She was raised there until age five, when her family returned to England. She was brought up in Yorkshire before moving to London in her teens. Headey had not gone to drama school before she became an actress. At the age of seventeen, Headey's performance in a one-off show in the company of six school friends caught the attention of a casting agent, who took a photo and asked her to audition. Eventually, Headey was cast in Waterland (1992), which became her big-screen debut. She honed her natural acting talent while filming and also took archery classes and horse training. She also took boxing classes in clubs in south London, where a former boxer had been teaching her to spar. During her film career, spanning over 15 years, Headey has shown her range in a variety of roles, playing characters from Amazon-type warriors and action-minded women in The Cave (2005) and Brothers Grimm (2005), to a lesbian florist in Imagine Me & You (2005).\n\nHeadey's film career has taken her all over the world. She was in India for the filming of Das Dschungelbuch (1994), then in St. Petersburg, Russia, for filming Onegin - Eine Liebe in St. Petersburg (1999), and in Norway for filming of Aberdeen (2000). In 2005 Headey was filming in Romania and in Mexico, then spent four months in Prague, Czech Republic, where a forest was designed and built for filming Brothers Grimm (2005), with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. During 2006 Headey was in Canada for the filming of 300 (2006), then went to locations in Bulgaria for shooting The Contractor - Doppeltes Spiel (2007), and Germany and in Czech Republic for the filming of Der Rote Baron (2008).\n\nShe also played Gina McVey in the horror thriller The Broken (2008), and Elizabeth in Das schwarze Herz (2009). In addition to her film-work, Heady appeared as Sarah Connor in a TV spin-off of the popular \"Terminator\" film franchise, the FOX's television series Terminator: S. C. C. (2008).\n\nOutside of her acting profession, Headey continued taking boxing lessons in London. She is a vegetarian and also remains loyal to yoga, which she discovered during her work in India. She has never been back to her birthplace in Bermuda; she shares her time between her homes in London, England, and Los Angeles, California.\n\nBest known for his supporting role as Dwight in Fast & Furious (2009) as well as his voice acting as 2012 Michelangelo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012-2017) and Beast Boy in Teen Titans Go! (since 2013), Gregory Michael Cipes realized his calling as an entertainer early in life. Having been born and raised in South Florida to a family of 9 brothers and sisters, Greg's inspiration to join the entertainment business was drawn from his thespian grandparents and TV director father. After dozens of roles in children's theater and numerous national commercials, made his professional off-Broadway acting and singing debut, starring as Young Solomon in the production \"The Rothschild's\" at the age of 13. At 16 he wrote, recorded and self produced his first single and eventual South Florida dance club hit with his band \"Cipes and the People\", whose album has since sold 60,000 copies plus. His new band, \"Super Space Fighters\" has been touted by critics as being a fresh take on Rock and Roll by mashing the sounds of the likes of the Beatles, Grateful Dead and Bob Marley (I). Cipes's new band has just started playing festivals across the United States.\n\nAt the age of 17, Greg became nationally ranked as a Junior Professional surfer with an unheard of 13 corporate sponsors. He's been featured several surfing magazines, and has graced the cover of \"Eastern Surf Magazine\" while appearing in numerous advertising campaigns for his sponsors.\n\nGreg moved to Los Angeles in 2001, with nothing more than his beloved dog Timber, a guitar on his bad, and a surfboard. Since, he has starred in over 30 feature films such as \"Fast & Furious - Neues Modell. Originalteile. (2009)\", \"Pain (2011)\", \"Rache ist sexy (2006)\", \"Evil Twins (2006)\", \"Die Party Animals sind zurück (2006)\", \"The Onion Movie (2008)\", \"Club Mad (2004)\". His television appearances include \"Ghost Whisperer - Stimmen aus dem Jenseits (2005)\", \"Cold Case - Kein Opfer ist je vergessen (2003)\", \"Gilmore Girls (2000)\", Raines (2007)\", \"Dr. House (2004), \"Bones: Die Knochenjägerin (2005)\", \"Without a Trace - Spurlos verschwunden (2002), \"Samantha Who? (2007)\". He has had recurring and series regular television roles on \"The Middle (2009)\", \"Deadwood (2004), \"One on One (2001)\", \"True Blood (2008)\" and \"Twentyfourseven (2006)\", \"Roseanne's Nuts (2011)\", \"CSI: Miami (2002)\", \"General Hospital (1963)\" & \"Anger Management (2012).\n\nCipes has been dubbed the Crowned Prince of the Voiceover, having originally been discovered by 8 time Emmy Award-winning voice director Andrea Romano who cast Greg in his first cartoon role announcing \"Greg has begun this ridiculously huge voice-over career.\" Greg is now the voice of his childhood idol Michelangelo in Nickelodeon's new global hit series Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012). His animation roles have made him known universally in such immortal characterizations as \"Beast Boy\" in Teen Titans Go! (2013), \"Kevin Levin\" in Ben 10: Alien Force (2008), \"Chiro\" in Disney's \"Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!\" (2004) , \"Danny Rand/Iron Fist\" in Der ultimative Spider-Man (2012), \"Caleb\" in W.i.t.c.h. (2004), Atlas\" in \"Astro Boy\" (2003), the unforgettable lion cub, \"Ryan\" in Tierisch wild (2006) and recurring roles in Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and Der Fisch-Club (2010) and Kick Buttowski - Keiner kann alles (2010).\n\nGreg's latest projects include a bi weekly \"speakeasy\" concert of eclectic local bands called La La Land, which is held at the Hollywood lounge Bardot. As a celebration of the culture and community of Laurel Canyon, Greg has created and is hosting the 4th Annual \"Love Street Festival\", taking place in Laurel Canyon July 5th. Greg is also on the board of the \"Kids Venice Basketball League Natural Leaders program\" which is an outreach program based in Los Angeles where underprivileged youth are introduced to the practices and principles of organic gardening, Yoga, Surfing, sustainable living and meditation. He has started his own charity organization based in Los Angeles called \"UnAmor\" bringing homeless Children, the Elderly and dogs together. Greg continues to tour the world making autograph appearances, teaching meditation and playing music live at Comic cons.\n\nCritically hailed for his forceful, militant, authoritative figures and one of Hollywood's most talented and versatile performers, Laurence (John) Fishburne III has been the recipient of numerous awards, including a number of NAACP Image honors.\n\nBorn in Augusta, Georgia on July 30, 1961, to Hattie Bell (Crawford), a teacher, and Laurence John Fishburne, Jr., a juvenile corrections officer. His mother transplanted her family to Brooklyn after his parents divorced. At the age of 10, the young boy appeared in his first play, \"In My Many Names and Days,\" at a cramped little theater space in Manhattan. He continued on but managed to avoid the trappings of a child star per se, considering himself more a working child actor at the time. Billing himself as Larry Fishburne during this early phase, he never studied or was trained in the technique of acting.\n\nIn 1973, at the age of 12, young Laurence won a recurring role on the daytime soap Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) that lasted three seasons. He subsequently made his film debut in the ghetto-themed Cornbread, Earl and Me (1975). At 14 Francis Ford Coppola cast him in Apocalypse Now (1979), which filmed for two years in the Philippines. Laurence didn't work for another year and a half after that long episode. A graduate of Lincoln Square Academy, Coppola was impressed enough with Laurence to hire him again down the line with featured roles in Rumble Fish (1983), Cotton Club (1984) and Der Steinerne Garten (1987).\n\nThroughout the 1980s, he continued to build up his film and TV credit list with featured roles despite little fanfare. A recurring role as Cowboy Curtis on the kiddie show Pee-wee's Playhouse (1986) helped him through whatever lean patches there were at the time. TV guest appearances at this time included \"Trapper John,\" \"M*A*S*H*,\" \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Miami Vice,\" \"Spenser: For Hire\" and \"The Equalizer.\"\n\nWith the new decade (1990s) came out-and-out stardom for Laurence. A choice lead in John Singleton's urban tale Boyz n the Hood - Jungs im Viertel (1991) catapulted him immediately into the front of the film ranks. Set in LA's turbulent South Central area, his potent role as a morally minded divorced father who strives to rise above the ignorance and violence of his surroundings, Laurence showed true command and the ability to hold up any film.\n\nOn stage, Laurence would become invariably linked to playwright August Wilson and his 20th Century epic African-American experience after starring for two years as the eruptive ex-con in \"Two Training Running.\" For this powerful, mesmerizing performance, Laurence won nearly every prestigious theater award in the books (Tony, Outer Critics Circle, Drama Desk and Theatre World). It was around the time of this career hallmark that he began billing himself as \"Laurence\" instead of \"Larry.\" More awards and accolades came his way. In addition to an Emmy for the pilot episode of the series \"Tribeca,\" he was nominated for his fine work in the quality mini-movies Die Ehre zu fliegen - Tuskegee Airmen (1995) and Miss Evers' Boys - Die Gerechtigkeit siegt (1997).\n\nOn the larger screen, both Laurence and Angela Bassett were given Oscar nominations for their raw, seething portrayals of rock stars Ike and Tina Turner in the film What's Love Got to Do with It? (1993). To his credit, he managed to take an extremely repellent character and make it a sobering and captivating experience. A pulp box-office favorite as well, he originated the role of Morpheus, Keanu Reeves' mentor, in the exceedingly popular futuristic sci-fi Matrix (1999), best known for its ground-breaking special effects. He wisely returned for its back-to-back sequels.\n\nInto the millennium, Laurence extended his talents by making his screenwriting and directorial debut in Mit aller Härte (2000), in which he also starred. The film is based on his own critically acclaimed play \"Riff Raff,\" which he staged five years earlier. In 1999, he scored a major theater triumph with a multi-racial version of \"The Lion in Winter\" as Henry II opposite Stockard Channing's Eleanor of Acquitaine. On film, Fishburne has appeared in a variety of interesting roles in not-always-successful films. Never less than compelling, a few of his more notable parts include an urban speed chess player in Das Königsspiel (1993); a military prisoner in Ein fremder Klang (1990); a college professor in Singleton's Die Rebellen (1995); a CIA operative in Bad Company (1995); the title role in Othello (1995) (he was the first black actor to play the part on film); a spaceship rescue team leader in the sci-fi horror Event Horizon - Am Rande des Universums (1997); a Depression-era gangster in Hoodlum (1997); a dogged police sergeant in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003); a spelling bee coach in Akeelah ist die Größte (2006); and prominent roles in the mainstream films Predators (2010) and Contagion (2011). He returned occasionally to the theatre. In April 2008, he played Thurgood Marshall in the one-man show \"Thurgood\" and won a Drama Desk Award. It was later transferred to the TV screen and earned an Emmy nomination.\n\nIn the fall of 2008, Fishburne replaced William Petersen as the male lead investigator on the popular CBS drama CSI: Vegas (2000), but left the show in 2011 to refocus on films and was in turn replaced by Ted Danson. Having since had a regular role as \"Pops\" in the comedy Black-ish (2014), he has also been seen on the bigger screen in the Superman movies Man of Steel (2013) and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) as Daily Planet chief Perry White; played a hired assassin in the thriller Standoff - Die einzige Zeugin (2016); portrayed a minister and former Vietnam War vet in Last Flag Flying (2017); and essayed the role of a revengeful prison warden in Imprisoned (2018).\n\nFishburne has two children, Langston and Montana, from his first marriage to actress Hajna O. Moss. In September 2002, Fishburne married Cuban-American actress Gina Torres.\n\nColin Farrell is one of Ireland's biggest stars in Hollywood and abroad. His film presence has been filled with memorable roles that range from an inwardly tortured hit man, to an adventurous explorer, a determined-but-failing writer, and the greatest military leader in history.\n\nFarrell was born on May 31, 1976 in Castleknock, Dublin, Ireland to Rita (Monaghan) and Eamon Farrell. His father and uncle were both professional athletes, and briefly it looked like Farrell would follow in their footsteps. Farrell auditioned for a part in the Irish boy band Boyzone, unsuccessfully. After dropping out of the Gaiety School of Acting, Farrell was cast in Ballykissangel (1996), a BBC television drama. \"Ballykissangel\" was not his first onscreen role. Farrell had previously been in War Zone (1999), directed by Tim Roth and had appeared in the independent film Drinking Crude (1997). Farrell was soon to move on to bigger things.\n\nExchanging his thick Dublin accent for a light Texas drawl, Farrell acted in the gritty Tigerland (2000), directed by Joel Schumacher. Starring Farrell among a number of other budding young actors, the film portrays a group of new recruits being trained for the war in Vietnam. Farrell played the arrogant soldier Boz, drafted into the army and completely spiteful of authority. The film was praised by critics but made little money at the box office. It was Farrell's first big role on film, and certainly not his last. Farrell followed up with American Outlaws (2001), where he played the notorious outlaw Jesse James with Scott Caan, son of legendary actor James Caan, in the role of Cole Younger. The film was a box-office flop and a critical failure. Immediately, Farrell returned to the war drama film that had made him famous. Co-starring in the war film Das Tribunal (2002) opposite Bruce Willis, Farrell played the young officer captured by the enemy. The film was another failure. Farrell struck gold when he was cast in the Steven Spielberg film Minority Report (2002) that same year. Set in a futuristic time period, Farrell played the character Danny Witwer, a young member of the Justice Department who is sent after Tom Cruise's character. The film was a smash hit, and praised by critics.\n\nFarrell continued this success when he reunited with Joel Schumacher on the successful thriller Nicht auflegen! (2002). Farrell played the role of the victim who is harassed by an unseen killer (Kiefer Sutherland) and is made to reveal his sins to the public. 2003 was a big year for Farrell. He starred in the crime thriller Der Einsatz (2003) as a young CIA man mentored by an older CIA veteran (Al Pacino). Pacino later stated that Farrell was the best actor of his generation. Farrell certainly continued to be busy that year with Daredevil (2003), which actually allowed him to keep his thick Irish accent. The film was another success for Farrell, as was the crime film S.W.A.T. - Die Spezialeinheit (2003) where Farrell starred opposite Samuel L. Jackson and LL Cool J. Farrell also acted in the Irish black comedy film Intermission (2003) and appeared another Irish film Die Journalistin (2003) which reunited him with Joel Schumacher once again. The following year, Farrell acted in what is his most infamous film role yet: the title role in the mighty Oliver Stone film epic Alexander (2004), which is a character study of Alexander the Great as he travels across new worlds and conquers all the known world before him. Farrell donned a blond wig and retained his Irish accent, and gave a fine performance as Alexander. However, both he and the film were criticized. Despite being one of the highest grossing films internationally and doing a good job at the DVD sales, Farrell did not come out of the experience without a few hurts. Farrell attempted to rebound with his historical film The New World (2005). Reuniting with \"Alexander\" star Christopher Plummer, and also acting with Christian Bale, Farrell played the brave explorer John Smith, who would make first contacts with the Native peoples. The film did not do well at the box office, though critics praised the film's stunning appearance and cinematography.\n\nFarrell returned to act in Michael Mann's film Miami Vice (2006) alongside Jamie Foxx. The film was a film adaptation of the famous television series, and did reasonably well at the box office. Farrell also acted in In den Staub geschrieben (2006) with Salma Hayek and Donald Sutherland, though the film did not receive much distribution. The next year, Farrell acted alongside Ewan McGregor in the Woody Allen film Cassandras Traum (2007) which received mixed reviews from critics. Farrell followed up with the hilarious black comedy Brügge sehen... und sterben? (2008). Written and directed by Irish theatre director Martin McDonagh, the film stars Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two Irish hit men whose latest assignment went wrong, leaving them to hide out in Bruges, Belgium. The film has been one of Farrell's most praised work, and he was nominated for a Golden Globe. As well as Brügge sehen... und sterben? (2008), Farrell acted alongside Edward Norton in the crime film Das Gesetz der Ehre (2008) which was not as successful as the former film. As well as working with charity, and speaking at the Special Olympics World Games in 2007, he has donated his salary for Terry Gilliam's Das Kabinett des Doktor Parnassus (2009) to Heath Ledger's little daughter (who was left nothing in a will that had not been updated in time). Ledger had originally been cast in the film and was replaced by Farrell, Johnny Depp and Jude Law. The film was a critical and financial success, and Farrell also played a small role in Crazy Heart (2009) which had the Dubliner playing a country singer. Farrell even sang a few songs for the film's soundtrack. As well as those small roles, Farrell took the lead role in the war film Triage (2009). Farrell incredibly lost forty-four pounds to play the role of a war photographer who must come to terms with what he has experienced in Kurdistan. While the film was finely made, with excellent performances from all involved, the film has received almost no distribution.\n\nFarrell's other leading role that year was in Neil Jordan's Irish film Ondine - Das Mädchen aus dem Meer (2009). In recent years, he co-starred in the comedy horror film Fright Night (2011), the science fiction action film Total Recall (2012), both remakes, and McDonagh's second feature, and the black comedy crime film 7 Psychos (2012). Since the mid-2000s, Farrell has cleaned up his act, and far from being a Hollywood hell raiser and party animal, he has shown himself to be a respectable and very talented actor.\n\nHe also starred in The Lobster (2015) and The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), both directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. For The Lobster he was nominated for a Golden Globe.\n\nEthan Green Hawke was born on November 6, 1970 in Austin, Texas, to Leslie Carole (Green), a charity worker, and James Steven Hawke, an insurance actuary. His parents were students at the University of Texas at the time but divorced when Ethan was 5 years old. His mother raised him alone for the next five years, moving around the country, until she remarried in 1981 and the family settled in Princeton Junction, New Jersey.\n\nHe attended West Windsor-Plainsboro High School and then transferred to the Hun School of Princeton and it was while he was there that he began taking acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus. His early ambition had been to be a writer, but as a result of the acting lessons and appearances in student productions he persuaded his mother to allow him to attend an audition for a role in a sci-fi adolescent adventure, Explorers - Ein phantastisches Abenteuer (1985). He got the role (along with River Phoenix) but although the movie was favourably reviewed, it met with little commercial success which discouraged Hawke from pursuing further movie roles for several years.\n\nHe was admitted to the prestigious Carnegie-Mellon University to study theatre but his studies were interrupted when he won his break-through role opposite Robin Williams in Der Club der toten Dichter (1989) and he did not complete his degree. He then appeared in numerous films before taking a role in the Generation X drama Reality Bites - Voll das Leben (1994) for which he received critical praise. He starred in the romantic drama Before Sunrise (1995), and its later sequels Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).\n\nHis subsequent acting career was a mix of theatre work (earning a number of awards and nominations, including a Tony Award nomination for his role in \"The Coast of Utopia\" at the Lincoln Center in New York), and a mix of serious and more commercial movies, notably Gattaca (1997) (where he met his first wife, Uma Thurman) and Training Day (2001). His role as the father in the coming-of-age drama Boyhood (2014) earned him multiple award nominations, including the Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nMeanwhile, he also wrote two novels: \"The Hottest State\" (1996) and \"Ash Wednesday\" (2002).\n\nJoshua David Duhamel was born in Minot, North Dakota. His mother, Bonny L., is a retired high school teacher, and the Executive Director of Minot's Downtown Business & Profession Association, and his father, Larry Duhamel, is an advertisement salesman. Josh has three younger sisters: Ashlee, McKenzee and Kassidy. His ancestry is German, and smaller amounts of Norwegian, French-Canadian, English, Irish, and Austrian (his last name is very common among Francophones in the world). Before his acting career, the football player studied biology and earned his Bachelor's degree at Minot State University with the intention of pursuing dentistry.\n\nAt 26 years old, Josh worked in construction, and it was by chance that he got into showbusiness. Modeling eventually gave way to acting as Josh was asked to audition for the title character in The Picture of Dorian Gray (2004), from the novel by Oscar Wilde.\n\nDuhamel can be seen in Vince Gilligan and David Shore's CBS series, \"Battle Creek.\" He is in production on four films: \"Lost In The Sun,\" \"Bravetown,\" \"The Wrong Stuff,\" and \"Beyond Deceit.\"\n\nDuhamel also starred alongside Hillary Swank and Emmy Rossum in the George C. Wolfe directed drama, \"You're Not You.\" Duhamel also starred opposite Julianne Hough in Lasse Hallstrom's \"Safe Haven,\" a drama based on the best-selling novel by Nicholas Sparks and the thriller \"Scenic Route,\" which tells the story of two friends stranded in the desert. In addition, Duhamel was seen in the star-studded, ensemble comedy \"Movie 43\" alongside Emma Stone, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Kate Winslet, Richard Gere among many others. Co-directed by Peter Farrelly and Patrik Forsberg, the film features various intertwining, raunchy tales.\n\nOther projects include Garry Marshall's \"New Year's Eve\" alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert DeNiro, Halle Berry, and Hilary Swank and Michael Bay's \"Transformers: Dark of the Moon,\" where he reprised his role of Captain William Lennox for the third installment of the franchise. Additional film credits include the romantic comedy \"Life as We Know It\" alongside Katherine Heigl, \"Ramona and Beezus,\" \"When in Rome\" and \"The Romantics.\" On television, Josh is best known for his role as Danny McCoy on the NBC crime drama \"Las Vegas.\" Additionally, he lent his voice to Nickelodeon's Emmy Award-winning animated series \"Fanboy & Chum Chum\" and starred in several seasons of the long-running ABC soap opera \"All My Children,\" in which he received three consecutive Daytime Emmy nominations.\n\nOn January 10 2009, Josh married Fergie Duhamel, better known as Fergie from The Black Eyed Peas. They have one child together, Axl Jack Duhamel. They reside in Los Angeles."
