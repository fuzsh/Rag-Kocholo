        "text": "Herbert Carl Volmar died peacefully on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, in Bountiful, Utah. He was born on January 6, 1928, to Carl H.J. Volmar and Hedwig Reinhardt Volmar in Salt Lake City, Utah. Herb attended Davis High School and later served in the Merchant Marines and as a ship medic during World War II, often steering the ship. His children loved to hear his stories of the sea and the dedication required at that time. He later enlisted in the US Army and completed training after the war had ended.\n\nIn 1950, Herb married Dawn McAllister in the Salt Lake Temple. Together they built a beautiful family of five children: Suzanne Riches Kern (Ralph Kern), Bradley (Jeri), Carolyn (Doug Nielsen), Scott (Lori), and Paulette (Dan Cary). He is also survived by his sisters, Esther Brown and Joyce Hill.\n\nHe was a proud trooper with the Utah Highway Patrol from 1957-1961, which was followed by a career as an aerospace quality control engineer at Univac in North Salt Lake, Utah. Even while working full time, he built two homes in Centerville, Utah for his family. He was a talented carpenter and handy man, though these projects were usually completed during the evenings or on weekends. He served in many callings in the Centerville 6th Ward through the years including as a member of the Bishopric. Many deep and lasting friendships were formed during the years in Centerville.\n\nHerb and Dawn built their retirement home on Lizzie Lane in St. George. There they gained many additional wonderful friends. Dawn passed away in July of 2003, but Herb continued to carefully care for the St. George house and yard. He served in his St. George LDS ward and especially enjoyed serving as a temple worker in the St. George Temple for many years.\n\nHerb was constantly busy, always helping his neighbors and friends with repair projects, he had an incredible ability to solve a problem. The St. George home became a welcome respite for his children, thirteen grandchildren and great grandchildren. When visiting, they always found a warm welcome, a comfortable bed and a full breakfast every morning.\n\nHerb Volmar will be remembered for his unwavering dedication to his family and his Savior, his strength of character and his wisdom. He was impeccably honest, fair and giving. He displayed much love for his children and grandchildren on many occasions with any help that was needed. Herb will be fondly remembered by all his family for the Sees Chocolates he passed out each Christmas, a tradition that began as a dating tradition with Dawn. He had a dry wit and an ability to thrive, no matter the circumstances.\n\nHis family would like to express thanks for the wonderful kindness and help received from his caring neighbors and friends in St. George. Thanks also for the wonderful care he received at Creekside Senior Living in Bountiful from loving staff and care givers, Creekside neighbors, friends and family. Applegate Hospice services rendered careful personal care to Herb which was greatly appreciated by the family.\n\nServices to celebrate Herbâ€™s life will be on Monday, October 9, 2023, at Russon Mortuary, 295 N Main Street, Bountiful, Utah. A viewing will be from 10:00 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., followed by a funeral service at 11:00 a.m. Interment at the Centerville City Cemetery following the funeral service.\n\nServices will be streamed live on the Russon Mortuary & Crematory Facebook page and on this obituary page. The live stream will begin about 10-15 minutes prior to the service and will be posted below.\n\nHerb will be missed greatly, but the legacy and memories of his life and spirit will always be in our hearts."
