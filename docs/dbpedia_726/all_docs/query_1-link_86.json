He’s even featured on the cover of Men’s Health.\n\nBut, this is not where it started.\n\nBorn and raised in an abusive poverty ridden household, Scott began his life between Glasgow and Salford. He recognised that he needed to improve his chances of a better quality life so joined the police force after studying.\n\nHe worked his way to senior detective roles often working covert and anonymously on some of the UK’s most heinous crimes including child sexual offences. \n\nIn 2017, in a pursuit to appease his itch for fitness, common good and entrepreneurialism he founded Battle Cancer with the goal of creating a community that uses fitness to support cancer survivors, patients, and their families. \n\nBattle Cancer is an organization that harnesses the power of fitness to support those affected by cancer.\n\nThe organization has since grown into a global movement that hosts events and fundraisers across the world, all with the aim of raising awareness and funds for cancer research and support. Battle Cancer now partners with NIKE, Whoop and Nocco all because of Scott’s tenacity.\n\nScott is now a sought-after speaker and educator, known for his infectious enthusiasm and unwavering commitment to his cause. He has been featured in numerous publications and media outlets, including Men's Health, Women's Health, and the BBC.\n\nWhether he's coaching clients one-on-one, organizing a Battle Cancer event, or speaking to a packed audience, Scott's mission remains the same: to inspire and empower individuals to take control of their health and their lives, and to show that with the right mindset, anything is possible.\n\n\nExtra Stuff: \n\n Follow vybey on Instagram\n\n Instagram -\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/vybey.uk/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?even...)\n\n-\n\nGet in touch \n\nGet in touch in the comments below or head to...\nInstagram:\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?even...\n\nTwitter:\n\n[https://www.twitter.com/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?even...\n\nEmail:\n\ndavidjuniormcintosh@gmail.com",

Status is proven to be more important than diet or exercise for health outcomes..\n\nStatus is not just a modern phenomenon; it's a fundamental part of the human experience, existing long before our current society. As writer Will Storr explains, the need for status and respect from others is not merely a luxury—it's an essential psychological and biological requirement for humans to thrive. He calls it the original currency.\n\nThroughout history, status hierarchies have existed in animal societies, serving as a means to organise social life and prevent constant conflict. From our tribal ancestors to modern civilization, the desire for status has deeply shaped human behavior and social structures.\n\nBut despite its importance, the topic of status often makes people feel uneasy. While discussions about connection and belonging are more comfortable, status remains a somewhat taboo subject. It's this discomfort that has perhaps led to fewer books being written about this universal human drive.\n\nHowever, Storr's work aims to shed light on this fundamental aspect of the human condition, unraveling its complexities and unveiling its significance in our lives.\n\nAlso, join us to hear about the psychology of cults, why architechts are the most illusive modern day cult, Will’s experience from going undercover following Neo-Nazi’s to understand the madness of groupthink and his experiences of David Irving the infamous holocaust denier.\n\nWill’s books: The Status Game: On Human Life and How to Play It\n\nhttps://amzn.to/41R6rsL\n\nSelfie: How the West Became Self-Obsessed\n\nhttps://amzn.to/41cJ2BL\n\nThe Science of Storytelling: Why Stories Make Us Human, and How to Tell Them Better\n\nhttps://amzn.to/3ohtxKo\n\nSignup to my Patreon: ⁠https://www.patreon.com/developmentbydavid⁠\n\nSPONSORS:\n\nVybey (code DBYD for 15%) - https://vybey.co.uk/?shpxid=fd5d5aab-fd5f-48d9-bf37-b58aa4317f25West Coast Motors - https://www.wcmotors.co.uk/\n\nRuari Fairbairns is co-founder of One Year No Beer, a subscription-based platform promoting an alcohol-free lifestyle with over 100,000 global members. Quickly, GET THIS EPISODE AND EVERY EPISODE EARLY BY SIGNING UP TO PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/developmentbydavid This episode explores the gradual transformation of society's relationship with alcohol, highlighting the need for heightened awareness of its negative impacts on mind and body. It delves into discussions on stress, trauma, ADHD, emotional sobriety, and the pivotal role of community in the transformative journey towards an alcohol-free lifestyle. The insights stem from Ruari’s turbulent and emotionally challenging childhood on the Isle of Mull in Scotland whcih saw him attempt suicide as early as 14. Who would know a letter to Richard Branson, who he then later met in Barbados, would change and save his life. This episode dives deep on the effects on alchohol and what it does to our body in mind. We expose the risks of casual drinking and show that alchohol by no means results in stress management. We also talk about the sober curious lifestyle which acts as a far better way to to reap the rewards of a sober lifestyle without the need for abstinence. 94% of people surveyed want to have a better relationship with alcohol do not want to quit. So, how do we have a more booze conscious culture. What are some of the low hanging fruits to reeping a time rich life in a time poor economy. How can you have a better relationship with your family, body and mind. Join Ruari and I who will give you the tools you need.\n\nTracy Garrad is CEO of Aviva Canada and has held CEO positions at HSBC, First Direct and AXA Health.
