        "text": "FRANCES MAY MUGRIDGE 20/2/1925-2/1/2003\n\nBorn in Littlehampton, West Sussex.\n\nKnown as Bunty, a nickname given to her by a son of one of her mother's brother.\n\nBunty moved to Hastings, Sussex with her family at some point in her childhood and apparently went to a Church School. Which one that was I don't know but Bunty had lots of stories to tell of her life at school to her children. Bunty also spent a lot of time living with her maternal grandmother in Wick, so maybe the school she went to was there, rather than Hastings. She also used to spend a lot of time with her mother's sister, May in Arundel, Sussex.\n\nIn 1939 Bunty was living at 33 Sedlescombe Road North with her parents and siblings Betty and Tony.\n\nUpon leaving school, Bunty worked for some time at a hotel. It may well have been the Queen's hotel as her mother worked there at some point in her life.\n\nAt some point, the family moved to Hendon, London, to 3 Dehar Crescent. I think this was sometime near the beginning of the war, or possibly just after the war started.\n\nBunty went to work at an aircraft plant in West Hendon. She would watch the aerial fights between Spitfires, Hurricanes and German bombers until she was forced to go down to the air raid shelter.\n\nIn April 1942, Bunty managed to convince the Army that she was 17, when in fact she was a year younger. She joined the Women's Auxillary Territorial Services as a Private. Her mother had given her consent for the enlistment.\n\nBunty was sent to Scotland to do her basic training and was then assigned to an anti-aircraft gun post. Her job was to calculate the location of an attacking enemy aircraft and to issue the command to fire to the gunner.\n\nBunty was posted to several camps in England and Wales and was discharged in July 1945. She was still a Private, having turned down promotion. Her reason for doing that was \"she preferred to be in the war on her own terms\".\n\nBunty remarked that a bad part of the war was all the rationing and the good part was meeting her husband.\n\nBunty met Corporal Howard Wayne Hendrix, of Wilks County, North Carolina, USA at a dance. He asked to walk her home and she agreed. Howard, apparently was so pleased that he gave Bunty some chewing gum.\n\nHoward was promoted to Sergeant and posted to Africa, Sicily and France so their courtship had to continue by post.\n\nWhen Howard returned from France he and Bunty were married at Hendon registry office on 10/4/1945. General Patton had signed the permit to marry.\n\nTheir children:\n\nCarol Frances 8/6/1948 Alison Elizabeth 19/3/1954 Dorothy Gail 20/8/1955 Howard Wayne 19/3/1962 John Everett 16/9/1965\n\nBunty set sail for America on the Queen Mary and arrived in the United States on 06/04/1946, along with several hundred other war brides. One of these brides was a lady named Ronnie Church who was to become Bunty's friend for 57 years. By a strange coincidence, neither of the ladies had met in England, they both rented rooms in the same house and discovered that they shared the same birthday and date. They decided they must be twins!\n\nAccording to Bunty's youngest sister, Alison, Howard still had a girlfriend living in North Wilkesborough when Bunty arrived and Bunty was not treated too well in the early days of the marriage.\n\nHoward worked as a mechanic at Gaddy Motor Company in North Wilkes.\n\nBunty became an American citizen on 23/10/1951, aged 26.\n\nBunty was a very good seamstress, taking after her mother and she forever had people going in and out of her home with sewing jobs.\n\nHoward died in ?\n\nShe was well know and very well liked and was full of life. She was for ever telling jokes and stories. She had a wicked sense of humour. She was also very fond of children and when her youngest went off to school, Bunty decided to babysit children, so her house was always noisy and full of fun.\n\nTo sum up Bunty, I will 'borrow' some script, written by Carol, Bunty's eldest child, to read at her memorial service. There were always folks at our house, either visiting, having sewing done, children and leaders from mom's scout troops or children being cared for by mom. As a result we gained more family. Mom was always reaching out to share her ambiance of love with everyone she could. It's hard to remember that the people weren't related by blood, but by love. One of mom's unwritten rules was that everyone must drink hot tea while sitting around her kitchen table (must have been a thow back to her life in England). And they did and they enjoyed it. But, there was an exception...if you came to visit while Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy was on the TV, you were to either be quite or match your wits against mom. That was always a losing battle , she kenw the answer to everything. She was a walking, talking encyclopedia of information. She was the smartest woman I have ever known. I think there must have been some gene associated with this knowledge as her sister Betty and also myself are a mind of useless information!\n\nCarol also went on to say \"Mom spent hours pouring over her material and patterns and would think nothing about making us a new outfit to wear to school the next day. She also made many friends by sewing, there was always someone going in and out of our house, carrying in material and carrying out the finished garment. My brother Wayne says Mama is the fabric from which we children were sewn.\n\nI had many conversations on the phone with Bunty and she was always saying she should be doing the housewark rather than talking but she never, ever got round to it. I would ask her next timne we spoke but it had not been done. The only time it got done was if someone was coming over from England to visit. The whole neighbourhood knew Bunty was expecting company when they saw her start to clean. She had a theory that she had cleaned houses for too many years and she was now going to spend her time enjoying her children, grandchildren, her friends, her books, her sewing and shopping. That sounds like a very sensible idea to me. Life is too short to waste it on continual cleaning! Bunty was a lady who loved to shop and would start buying Christmas presents in the January sales. These presents would be hidden all over the house and sometimes they would be forgottern. It was not unusual to get a present the following summer when lost ones reappeared.\n\nThe family would always rent a large house on the coast in ? each summer and a good time was had by all. In the summer of 2003 Bunty was sick during the trip. Shortly after her return, Bunty found out she had liver cancer. She had to have chemotherapy and Bunty, being Bunty, charmed the staff at Wilkes Regional hospital. They nicknamed her 'The Queen' and always curtsied or bowed whenever she went there. Bunty remained optimistic during the treatment but her body did not do so well.\n\nBunty died of liver cancer in her home at Applewood Lane, North Wilkesboro,North Carolina on Thursday 02/01/2003. A memorial service was held for her on Saturday 4th February atthe Miller Funeral Services Chapel, North Wilkes and there were so many people there, they had to stand outside. Bunty had been a very well known and loved lady.\n\nHer obituary from the local paper read as follows:\n\nMrs. Frances Mugridge Hendrix, age 77, died Thursday, January 2, 2003\n\nMrs. Frances Mugridge Hendrix, age 77, widow of Howard Hendrix of Applewood Lane, North Wilkesboro, died Thursday, January 2, 2003 at her home. Mrs. Hendrix was born February 20, 1925 in Littlehampton, United Kingdom to John Caleb and Emily Legget Mugridge. She was a veteran of the British Army and served during World War II and came to the United States in 1946. Surviving are two sons, John Hendrix of North Wilkesboro, Wayne Hendrix of Millers Creek; three daughters, Alison Blevins of Millers Creek, Gail Laws, Carol Davis, both of North Wilkesboro; two sisters, Alison Oaks, Betty Smithson both of the United Kingdom; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Memorial services were held Saturday, January 4 at Miller Funeral Chapel with the Rev. Dean Rector officiating. Memorials may be made to Frances M. Hendrix Scholarship Fund, c/o John Q. Myers, Yadkin Valley Bank & Trust Company, Wilkesboro, N.C. 28697 or to Hospice of Wilkes, 1907 West Park Drive, North Wilkesboro, N.C. 28659. Miller Funeral Service was in charge of the arrangements.\n\nBERTIE LEONARD JOHN MUGRIDGE4/6/1926-??/12/2001\n\nBorn in Hastings, East Sussex and known as Bert.\n\nAs a child, Bert moved many times with his parents and siblings from rental home to rental home. It was quite probably avoid the rent man. Some of the places I know were St Thomas's Road, 33 and 136 Braybrooke Road.\n\nIt was said that Bert was always in trouble when he was younger. I took this with a pinch of salt until I found the 1939 Register entry for him..\n\nIn 1939 Bert was in Hertfordshire at the Danesbury Approved School, Hertford.\n\nBert joined the army as part of his national service. It kept him out of trouble.\n\nMarried Jean Shaw (b 1926 in Hastings) on 03/08/1949.\n\nTheir children:\n\nChristopher Andrew 4/12/1950 Graham Rex 20/2/1955\n\nBert was very softly spoken, with a deep voice. It was quite difficult at times to hear what he said.\n\nBert worked for BEA and lived for many years in Weybridge, Surrey.\n\nBert and Jean moved out to Spain, near Alicante to enjoy his retirement. They spent several years there before their new batch of grandchildren called them back home.\n\nBert and Jean moved back to England, to Shropshire to be near their grandchildren.\n\nBert died in Telford, Shropshire 05/12/2001 of lung cancer. He had also been suffering from emphysema for many years. Bert was cremated at Telford crematorium on Wednesday 12th December.\n\nJean developed demensia and ended her days in a care home. She died there on 27/05/2015. Jean was cremated at Telford crematorium on Friday June 12th.\n\nELIZABETH ANN MUGRIDGE 6/2/1930-25/4/2008\n\nMy mum kept all sorts of bits of paper from her past for which I am extremely grateful. It's a shame I never knew about them until after her death as I would liked to have quizzed her on some of them.\n\nBorn in Wick near Littlehampton.\n\nChristened on 08/05/1930 at All Saint's Church, Wick.\n\nKnown as Betty.\n\nMoved to Hastings when she was fairly young and grew up as a tomboy. She did not like her younger brother Tony too much and was always fighting with him. I believe it was probably due to a bit of jealousy as she was no longer the baby of the family and Tony was spoilt. Despite her dislike of Tony, she lost her top two front teeth in a fight, when she was 11, defending him from a group of bullies. During her time in Hastings, Betty lived at many different addresses and some of the moves happened at night which led her to believe the family were doing a 'moonlight flit' to avoid the rent man. Some of the addresses the family lived at were St Thomas's Road, 33 Braybrooke Road and 136 Braybrooke Road.\n\nThe primary school Betty attended was Mount Pleasant school. For a short history of the school expansion, click here.\n\nBetty obviously attended Sunday school regularly as she kept a scripture examination certificate that she was awarded in 1940. This certificate was awarded with honours and came form St Luke's Presbyterian School.\n\nAs a child, Betty moved many times with her parents and siblings from rental home to rental home. It was quite probably avoid the rent man. Some of the places I know were St Thomas's Road, 33 and 136 Braybrooke Road.\n\nIn 1939 Betty was living at 33 Sedlescombe Road North with her parents and siblings Bunty and Tony.\n\nThe family also spent some time in Hendon at 3 Dehar Crescent. I believe this was during the war, which would explain why Betty and her brother were evacuated.\n\nDuring the war Betty was evacuated, with her younger brother Tony, to Bedford. Each time I asked her about her experiences she would just say it was not nice and clam up. She told me, in later years, that she had regularly been touched inappropriately by the man of the house. It is a shame she didn't tell her mother that when she came up to fetch Tony after it was discovered he had been ill treated. It was while she was evacuated that Betty went off sugar in her drinks. The parents used Betty's sugar rations and she had to have jam in her tea if she wanted it sweet. She told me this tasted so revolting, that she just stopped having anything sweet.\n\nBetty was confirmed at St Paul's Church in Bedford in 1944, so obviously during her evacuation and she took her first communion at St Mary's Church in Bedford.\n\nI don't know the name of the school Betty went to in Bedford but I do know she attended Tower Road School in St Leonards on Sea, Sussex. The school buildings were built in a huge dip, the walls around the playground were about 30' high (or that's what they appeared to be when I was younger) and there was a ramp leading down into the playground. I have just found a piece about the opening of the school here. This school was later renamed as Woodlands Secondary School for girls (where I attended) and years later it became Christchurch Junior School. The majority of the old building was knocked down but the new buildings still occupy the old playground. Betty's great grandson went to school here. Betty passed exams there in 1944, aged 14, in French, hand writing and English (with distinction). These were all elementary certificates.\n\nAfter the war the family returned to Hastings where they bought a house at 14 Brook Street\n\nBetty was always an athletic person who enjoyed sports and took part in the activities in Hastings Youth Week, held in June, in 1948. On June 10th she came 3rd in the girl's 17-19 year old girls 150 yard race and also 3rd in the girls 100 yard race.\n\nStraight after leaving school, she went to work at Pelham's Chemist in the High Street, Old Town in Hastings. The shop is still there, complete with the tiled name under the shop window, only today it is a florists shop.\n\nShe became godmother to Julia Pelham, (the daughter of the chemist's owner) at St Clements Church, Hastings on 14/08/1949 .\n\nBetty decided to be different to the rest of her siblings and wanted to join the RAF rather than the Army. She enrolled as a member of the Women's Junior Air Corps on 18/02/1946, 12 days after her 16th birthday. She belonged to Unit 208 in Hastings and meetings took place on Monday nights from 19-00 to 21-30 hours at 4 Carlisle Parade. Betty was promoted to Lance Corporal on 18/2/1948, 2 years after her enrollment; Corporal on 21/06/1948, Sergeant on 01/05/1950 and a unit Sergeant on 06/11/1950. While a cadet Betty had 4 flights in a Fairchild Argos, which she told me she thoroughly enjoyed. On 21/04/1948 she gained her 1st Ability badge and on 03/11/1948 she gained her Air Ability badge. Betty left the WJAC on 07/05/1951, after 5 years.\n\nOn 18/05/1951, Betty signed up for 4 years service in the WRAF. Her serial number was 2816958 and she joined as an A.C.W/2.\n\nNot long after she enlisted, betty attended a big service in St Paul's Cathedral which was attended by the King and Queen and General Dwight D. Eisenhower. This service took place on July 4th, 1951 and it was a Service of Commemoration of 28,000 American dead in war time comradeship with the people of Britain and of Dediscation of the Roll of Honour for the American Memorial Chapel. Betty kept the booklet about the ceremony and it appears all her service pals signed it for her. I believe they had all probably recently finished their basic training and were going off to different RAF stations. Betty also managed to get the autographs of Dickie Valentine and Douglas Fairbanks Junior, who were also at the service. She had often talked about these but had never shown me them so I was a bit sceptical. I found them after her death.\n\nBetty spent 2 years in the WRAF working as an airframe mechanic on Vampires and Meteors.\n\nIt was while Betty was doing a course at RAF St Athans in Wales, (where she was stationed), that she met her future husband. She contracted German measles during her course and had to join the next course to finish it, so bumping into her husband to be.\n\nMarried Lawrence Edwin Smithson (b 1931 in Yorkshire) on 29/3/1952 in St Andrews Church, Hastings, Sussex.\n\nTheir children:\n\nLesley Ann 31/5/1954 Jacqueline Theresa 8/2/1957 Kim Rosemary9/4/1959\n\nAfter their wedding, Betty still worked at St Athans until she was posted to Germany and Eddie was posted elsewhere. At that point, Betty left the servcie.\n\nEddie was posted to Singapore and went on ahead. Betty sailed out to Singapore on board the S.S. Lancashire, sailing from Liverpool on 26/02/1954. She had had to sail, rather than fly as she was expecting her first child. Betty had cabin 76, berth D. I have a menu for the night of 25/03/1954 with a note on the bottom saying \"All clocks will be advanced 30 minutes at midnight tonight. Obviously the beginning of BST but why half an hour instead of an hour?\n\nThe first place they lived in Singapore was 103 Lorong J Telok Karau Road in Katong. This was a shared house where they had one room to themselves while sharing a kitchen and bathroom. They later moved into a married quarter at 17 Mornington Crescent, RAF Seletar. They had an armour there to help with the work who also helped look after their daughter, Lesley.\n\nAfter Eddie's tour of duty came to an end, Betty and Lesley returned home to England on 21/02/1956. They lived at 34B Springfiled Road, St Leonards on Sea, Sussex. Eddie was sent on a training course for a different aircaft type and ended up serving in Malta for several months on his own. Whenever he was training or off on an unaccompanied posting, Betty and the girls always headed back to St Leonards on Sea where Betty's family still lived.\n\nEddie was then posted to RAF Watton, near Norwich in Norfolk. The family they lived at 34 Walploe Street, Norwich until they got a married quarter on the camp.\n\nAfter the birth of their second daughter, Betty and Eddie moved into a 2 bedroomed married quarter at 15 Farnborough Road, at RAF Watton.\n\nWhen daughter number 3 came along, the family moved into a larger 3 bedroomed married quarter at 25 Boscombe Road\n\nFrom Watton, Eddie was posted to RAF Bruggen in Germany in 1961. As usual, he went ahead of the family and lived there for several months on his own while waiting for accomodation. During this time Betty and the girls lived with her mother at 190 Bohemia Road, St Leonards on Sea, Sussex.\n\nAccomodation in a block of flats in Eindhoven, Holland became available and Betty and the girls moved in there. I remember when we flew out to Germany form gatwick airport, we spent the night in the Union Jack Club by Waterloo station in London. My grandmother stayed the night as well. We all travelled up by rail from Hastings to Charing Cross Station. They were only there for 3 or 4 months before they moved to a maisonette at 38K Webshall Strausee, Moenchengladbach in Germnay. This was an RAF off camp accomodation and the family lived there for the rest of the 3 year posting.\n\nEddie was sent off for more training on his return to England and once more Betty and the girls went down to St Leonards on Sea to live until a married quarter was available. They left Germany from RAF Wilderath on 2/10/1964.\n\nOnce a married quarter became available, Betty and the girls moved again; this time to 7 Valetta Road, RAF Dishforth, North Yorkshire. This was not far from Ripon.\n\nThe next move was a fairly short one from one part of Yorkshire to another. The family lived at 185 AMQ, RAF Driffield in the East Riding of Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1967 the family moved into 126 Pine Square, RAF Wattisham, Suffolk. This camp was near Ipswich.\n\nBetty and the girls left RAF Wattisham in July 1970 and went to live temporarily with Betty's mother at 190 Bohemia Road. They then moved into a rented 3 bedroomed semi-detached house at 40 Shirley Drive, St Leonards on Sea. The monthly rent on the house was £36 and 8 shillings.\n\nThe family lived there for 7 months and Betty got a job working in Theakers, a chemist chain, in Battle Road, just a short walk from the house.\n\nAfter 7 months, the family moved again, this time to 16 St Margarets Raod, St Leonards. This was a large victorian style terraced house that was arranged over 5 floors. The caretaker lived on the bottom 2 levels and Betty and the girls lived on the top 3. You could see the sea from the top 2 stories at the back of the house and it was only about a 7 minute walk to the pier and the beach.\n\nBetty still worked for Theakers but was able to change shops and went to work in the town centre branch. After a falling out amongst the staff, Betty and one other employee went to work for another Chemist. This time it was a small time chemists named Cathaways, along Bohemia Road.\n\nThe family stayed in that house until 1973 when Eddie was posted to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Lesley had left home, Jacqui went to live with her grandmother and finish school while Betty and Kim moved in with Eddie at 99 Abbey Road, Witney, Oxon. This was a married quarter and much nicer than the ones at Carterton. Eddie took over the quarter on 29/03/1973 at 09-00 hours, his and Betty's 21st wedding anniversary.\n\nWhile living in Witney, Betty went to work at the local Waitrose supermarket. She was trained to operate a chechkout till but very soon moved onto serving on the delicatessen counter. She really enjoyed this job and stayed there until she moved back down to Hastings again.\n\nEddie decided to retire from the RAF and went to work for the Saudi Arabian Air Force in 1975. Betty had taken Kim back to Hastings to live as she had gotten in with a bad crowd, Lesley was still living away and Jacqui went to lodge with the next door neighbours. The house at Witney was handed back to the RAF.\n\nBetty and Kim rented a lovely house at 8 Hamilton Gardens in Hastings and stayed there for several months.\n\nDuring one of Eddie's trips home to England he and Betty bought their first ever home. This was 9 Applewood Close in St Leonards on Sea. Betty lived there for a couple of years before she decided to go out to Saudi to live with her husband. The house was sold to Betty's younger sister, Alison, and her husband.\n\nBetty arrived at Dhahran airport, Saudi Arabia, aboard BA 121 on 13/11/1978 at aproximately 19-00 hours.\n\nDuring Eddie's time in Saudi he and Betty went on holiday to different exotic places, electing to off set their flying allowance (for home visits) on the cost of somewhere war. They visited Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Kenya, Barbados, Mauritius, the Seychelles and several trips to Jersey. They really enjoyed these holidays.\n\nBetty and Eddie lived in Saudi for about 3 years before they returned home to Hastings. They bought another house, 24 Shirley Drive in St Leonards on Sea for the sum of £24,950. This house was not far from the house they had rented back in 1970. Eddie went on a training course to do with helicopter engines. He then got a job at Fleetlands in Gosport, Hampshire so another move was on the cards.\n\nBetty and Eddie moved into 169 Privett Road in Gosport in about 1983. They lived there quite happily for about 9 years and always had one or more grandchildren to stay during the school holidays. It was always Betty who asked if she could have them stay as she loved to take them out places. I really don't know who enjoyed it the most, her or the grandchildren! Both Betty and Eddie joined the RAF Association while they were down in Gosport and attended their meetings and functions.\n\nBetty suffered from breast cancer and had a mastectomy in January 1991. I can't remember if she had the operation in Salisbury hospital or Queen Anne's hospital, Cosham, Hampshire. She made a quick recovery and was looking after 2 of her grandchildren for 10 days, 5 weeks after the op. I remember her telling me how strange it was, how she felt lopsided and how she nearly fell off a chair whhile changing a lightbulb as she was unbalanced!\n\nBetty had reconstruction surgery a year after the operation and that took place at either Salisbury or Cosham. One op was done in one hospital and one in the other.\n\nIn 1992 Eddie was told he had to retire as he was a civil servant and had reached that age so they decided it was time to move again.\n\nBetty and Eddie took their time to look around and decided to move to Ramsey in Huntingdonshire. They lived at 53 Blenheim Drive in Ramsey.\n\nWhile in Ramsey, Betty became a member of the ladies wing of the Royal British Legion and made many friends. She worked as a volunteer in the Legion shop, sold poppies and went up to the Royal Albert Hall each year for the Remembrance service.\n\nBetty and Eddie finally decided to return to Hastings to live in 2000, staying with her daughter Kim and her family in Battle Road, St Leonards on Sea while looking for a house to rent. They also spent several months living with their grandson Jamie (Kim's son) and his girlfriend while changing houses.\n\nBetty and Eddie lived at 28 Pine Avene, Hastings, moved to 8 Berlin Road, Hastings and then finally moved into 40A Queens Road, a flat above Gamleys toy shop. There was a lovely view of part of Hastings Castle from her bedroom window. This flat was very close to homes her parents, grandparents and great grandparents had lived. Of course, she didn't know this at the time they moved in as I hadn't found all the relatives at that time. By a strange coincidence, the flat was rented through an estate agents situated at 109 Queens Road. The flat above this shop was once occupied by Betty's parents and younger sister.\n\nBetty was diagnosed with uterine cancer and in March 2004 she under went a hysterectomy in Brighton hospital. This time she was not so lucky with avoiding radiotherapy treatment and had about 6 treatments. She did not mind those so much, she was more annoyed by the fact that she was limited in what she could do for 6 weeks after her op. She had always been an active person and hated the restrictions put on her.\n\nEddie died of a heart attack on the morning of Monday January 1st 2007, leaving Betty rather shell shocked. He had been ill on and off for years but this came out of the blue. He was cremated at Hastings crematorium on Thursday the 11th January on a wet, miserable day.\n\nBetty began to suffer from awful pains in her hips and also pain in her right knee. The doctor discovered her knee was in need of a bit of repair and this wasd probably contributing to the pain in her hips. So in May 2007 she went into hospital to have it cleaned out. It didn't do the trick, the hip pain was still there.\n\nThe hip pain was discovered later in the year on a visit to her oncologist - the bones were breaking up due to cancer.\n\nOn Christmas Eve 2008, Betty was given the news that she had been dreading - the cancer had returned, this time to her stomach and this time it was untreatable. She was given months to live.\n\nIn the second week of January, Betty was admitted to St Michael's Hospice for a 2 week assesment. Because of the swelling in her legs and stomach and the fact she couldn't manage any of the stairs in her flat, it was decided that she should remain at the hospice.
