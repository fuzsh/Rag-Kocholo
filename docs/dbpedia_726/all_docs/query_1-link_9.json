        "text": "Jane Booth Scott had been baptised on 20 June 1810 in Gravesend, daughter of James Scott (1784 - 1835) and Essex Booth (1784 - 1835) who had married on 5 December 1805 in Strood, Nr Rochester, Kent. Other researchers have suggested that\n\nJames Scott (1) was baptised on 13 June 1784 in St Mary's Chatham, Kent, the son of James Scott (2) and Rebecca. James Scott (1) of Holland Street, Southwark died aged 52 and was buried on 6 June 1835 at Christ Church, Southwark.\n\nand that\n\nEssex Booth was born on 16 December 1784 and baptised on 21 December 1784 at Dunbar, West Lothian, the daughter of Charles Booth and Jean Downie. Essex Scott was buried on 18 January 1835 in St George's, Gravesend.\n\nCharles Booth had married Jean Downie on 12 January 1784 in Dunbar. Charles Booth of Walcot Place, Lambeth died aged 69 years and was buried on 23 March 1831 in St George, Bloomsbury.\n\nJane Booth Scott had previously married David Knight on 31 May 1835 in Whitechapel. David and Jane had a daughter\n\nLouisa Essex Knight. Born 13 February 1836 and baptised on 13 March 1836 at Gravesend.\n\nDavid Knight had died by 1837, but his death has not yet been traced.\n\nIn 1841 James Scott and his wife Jane were living at Bermondsey Walk where James was a nautical instrument maker. James was 39 and Jane 29 years old. Three children are listed, although no relationships are given.\n\nAnn Scott, Aged 3\n\nJane Scott. Aged 1\n\nLouisa Night. Aged 5\n\nAnn Jane Scott was born on 26 April 1839 and was baptised on 9 September 1839, the daughter of James Scott, mathematical instrument maker and his wife, Jane. They were living at Jamaica Road, Bermondsey when Ann was baptised. Something seems not quite right with the ages here. I'm convinced that the reference to daughter Jane on the census is an error by the enumerator. The father's occupation suggests that I have the right family.\n\nIn 1851 James and Jane are living at 17 Bermondsey Walk. James is a 49, a nautical instrument maker. Two children are listed, daughter Louisa Knight Scott, aged 15 and son Francis Scott, aged 2. Elizabeth Knight, their 17 year old niece is visiting.\n\nJames and Jane appear to have had at least two more children\n\nJames Alfred Scott. Born 1846. Baptised 1 July 1846 at St Mary's, Bermondsey.\n\nFrancis David Scott. Born 13 May 1848, Baptised 22 August 1852 at Bermondsey Christchurch\n\nTheir daughter Ann J Scott, aged 12 was at the Blind School, London Road, Lambeth, Southwark at the time the 1851 census was taken. It is not clear where James Alfred Scott was at the time.\n\nSee School for the Indigent Blind, Lambeth Road- LandmarkLandmark (boroughphotos.org)\n\nI can find no trace of the family in 1861.\n\nIn 1871 James and Jane were living at 17 Nautical Makers House, Southwark. James, aged 70 is still described as a nautical instrument maker. His wife Jane was 60 years old. Their son James Alfred was 24 years old and a lighterman. Son, Francis David was 22 years old, a nautical instrument maker. An 18-year-old domestic servant is also listed.\n\nJane Booth Scott died aged 63 years old in 1874 (Reg Gen Sept 1874 St Olave 1d 162).\n\nSo, Jane had died by 1881. The family were living at 17 Bermondsey Wall, Bermondsey. James, aged 79, was still a nautical instrument maker. According to the census he was 6 years younger than his new wife as Emma who by then was 85 years old. Son Francis, shown as unmarried!, was living with them along with children Emily, aged 12, Walter, aged 3 and Jane, aged 2. Its not clear what happened here for later census returns show Francis living with his wife Emma and their children (see below). I do wonder if James had not remarried and the transcriber got the relationships and ages wrong - Emma was 5 years older than her husband Francis.\n\nJames George Scott of Bermondsey Wall, died in 1882 and was buried in Southwark on 13 December 1882.\n\nIn 1861 Edward and Louisa were living in Bath Road, Heston, Middlesex. Edward, aged 25 was an \"engineers clerk and traveller\". HIs wife Louisa was 24 years old. They had two sons.\n\nWilliam James Howard. Born 5 September 1858 in Deptford.\n\nEdward David Howard. Born 13 December 1860 in Bermondsey.\n\nIn 1871 they were living at 65, Union Road, Rotherhithe and Edward was now a \"timber merchant\". William and Edward, aged 14 and 10 were scholars. A daughter had been born and was 3 years old\n\nLouisa Esther Jane Howard. Born 1867 in Bermondsey.\n\nIn 1881 they were living at 9, Worboy Terrace, Leyton and Edward was a 45 year old timber dealer. Their son Edward, aged 20 was a joiner, daughter Louisa was 13 years old.\n\nBy 1891, Louisa E Howard was a 54 year old widow. She was living at 61, Westbury Road, West Ham. She was self employed as a music teacher. Daughter Louisa was a 23 year old school teacher. Lillie Clement, an 11 year old adopted child is also listed, along with boarder Augustus Cannon, a 24 year old shipping clerk.\n\nIn 1901 Louisa Howard, a 65 year old widow was living at 112, Monega Road, She was working on her own account as a music teacher. Her granddaughters (see below), Louise E Cannon, aged 8 and Annie Cannon, aged 6 were boarding with her, as was Lilly Clements, now a 21 year old barmaid.\n\nIt is likely that Louisa Essex Howard died in 1908 aged 71 years old (Reg Gen March 1908 West Ham 5a 113).\n\nEdward and Louisa's son William James Howard married Louise Jones on 8 August 1880 at Holy Trinity, Harrow Green, Essex. In 1881 they were living at 2 Woodstock Cottages, Chatsworth Road, where William was a joiner. Their 8 year old nephew Jonah Gordon was living with them. In 1891 they were at Claremont Villas, Plumstead. William, aged 34 was still a joiner. Their eldest five children had been born. In 1901 the family are at 73, Punnett Road, Plumstead, but strangely the head of the household is shown as \"David\" Howard, a 44 year old carpenter!!. All six children had now been born,\n\nMarion Louise Howard. Born 12 July 1881 in Stratford. Marion married Walter Edward Richardson in 1915 in West Ham. In 1921 Walter and \"Marie\" were living at 1, Caulfield Road, East Ham. Walter is 37 years old and a tailor's manager for Montagues Bur.....ess Ltd, 29 to 30 Oxford Street, London.

Walter Edward Richardson died on 30 January 1972 and was buried on 3 February 1972 in Pembrokeshire.\n\nWilliam Edward Howard. Born 1884 in Stratford\n\nPercy Bertram Howard.

William Edwin Mole died in 1973 at Heol Tyn y Cae, Rhwbina, Cardiff,\n\nIn 1911 William and Louisa were at 365, High Street, Plumstead where William, aged 54 was a carpenter for the local council. The census shows that they had 6 children of which 5 survived. Marion, aged 25, Mabel, aged 23 and Ethel, aged 19, all remained at home. William James Howard of 365, High Street, Plumstead died on 27 February 1918. He was buried on 5 March 1918 in Greenwich. Probate was granted to Louisa Howard, widow.

Madame Annie Pyne, a young blind lady of pleasing appearance and who we understand had recently become the wife of the conductor of the concert sang \"Tell me with my heart\" in first rate style and in a subsequent humorous duet \"Town and Country or Guardian and Ward\" with Mr Pyne displayed a power that made us feel although deprived of one of natures great facilities she is wonderfully blessed with the gift of song\".\n\n28 May 1870 - \"St Pancreas, Holborn and Bloomsbury Journal\".\n\nOn Friday evening, the Blind Choral Class gave their annual conference at Birbeck Institute, Southampton Buildings, Holborn...............a good opening followed by selections from \"Messiah\" in which...........Madame Annie Pyne............and Mr G T Pyne took solo parts....................Mr G T Pyne with much humour sang \"who'll serve the Queen\" he was also encored.

Madame Annie Pyne, a lady possessing pure soprano voice in her rendering of \"With Verdure Clad\" was all that could be desired was loudly applauded.

The first piece calling for comment was \"The Lark\" by Madame Annie Pyne which was well sung that an encore was demanded and a scotch song substituted. Mr G T Pyne (the conductor) who is evidently a favourite both with the audience and the choir sang \"The Scout\" and as encore \"I'm not myself at all, Molly Dear\" with considerable humour, afterwards singing humorous duets with his wife.

Banns had earlier been read on 13 June 1880, 20 June 1880 and 27 June 1880 at St George, Bloomsbury. Frederick is described as being of the Parish of Holy Trinity, Lea, Kent and Annie Jane Pyne was of the parish of St George, Bloomsbury.\n\nThe only earlier records located of Frederic Swanson\n\nAt the time of the 1841 census, aged 15, he may have been living with his mother Elizabeth Swanson and his sister Elizabeth Swanson, aged 13 at Seymour Street, Somers Town, St Pancras. The head of the household appears to be Miguel Del Rago, aged 60 and \"born in foreign parts\" his occupation is unclear, as is his relationship to Elizabeth and Frederick. Was this Miguel del Riego (lordbyron.org)? His death certificate in 1846 suggests that he was a canon of Ovcida, Spain\n\nAt the time of the 1851 census when, aged 24 and unmarried he is living at 5 Park Row, Charlton and working as an organist at Blackheath Church. Interestingly the census notes that he too was blind.

Programme presented by Mr & Mrs Swanson - Pyne, the Misses Grace, Ada and Edith Pyne, Miss Annie Somersfield and Mr C R Payne.\n\nThe performance started with the Madigral from \"The Mikado\" \"Brightly dawns our wedding day\" which was followed by \"The Pretty Little Flower\" duet from Ruddigore by Miss Grace Pyne and Mr Payne\n\nMiss Edith Pyne , a young lady of 12 years old contributed Arne's \"When Daisies Pied\". Mrs Pyne sung artistically Rossini Cavatine \"Di Piacer\" and Arditri's \"Beauties Sleep\" and also took part with her daughters in the trio \"Memory\" and with Mr Pyne and Mr Payne in \"The Magic Wove Scarf\".\n\nMiss Ada Pyne was recalled for \"The Lost Chord\" and gave \"Little Buttercup\" and Miss Grace Pyne gained a similar complement for a \"Penny for your Thoughts\" and replied with \"Cockles & Mussells\"\n\nMiss Summerfield \" a little 9 year old pupil of Mrs Pyne played a piano solo in exemplification of the fact , as Mr Pyne pointed out to the audience that blind people are capable of teaching. The little pianist was encored and contributed \"Home Sweet Home\", the chorus of bridesmaids \"Fair is Rose\" from Ruddigore was well received and several part songs made up the programme which passed off very successfully, The family we may remark is obliged to leave Hastings for Mrs Pyne's health\".\n\nAnnie appears to have recovered and on 13 October 1888 the Isle of Wight Observer reports on the family's farewell concert at the Town Hall following at series of concerts over the summer at Esplanade Gardens.\n\nJames Alfred Scott may have died in 1879, aged 33 years old, in Southwark (Reg Gen June 1879 St Olave Southwark 1d 177), presumably before his son's birth, in which case why is he described as he is at the time of the baptism?\n\nSusan Eliza Scott died and was buried on 10 October 1895 in Southwark.
