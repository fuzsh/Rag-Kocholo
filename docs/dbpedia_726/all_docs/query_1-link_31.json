        "text": "by\n\nP. G. Wodehouse\n\nLiterary and Cultural References\n\nChapter 1 (pp. 7–22)\n\nBelpher Castle, in the county of Hampshire (p. 7)\n\nThere is a village named Belpher (or Belper) in Derbyshire, but no obvious link between that and Wodehouse’s choice of name.\n\nThe names of two other Wodehouse castles—Dreever Castle in A Gentleman of Leisure and Beevor Castle in Spring Fever—echo the names of well-known real-life castles: Belvoir (pronounced “Beaver”) in Leicestershire and Hever (pronounced “Heaver”) in Kent (the county in which Beevor Castle is placed); it is possible that the name Belpher may have been similarly inspired.\n\nMurphy (In Search of Blandings) identifies the village of Belpher with Emsworth, a village on the Hampshire coast just east of Havant where Wodehouse lived for varying periods between 1903 and 1914; Belpher Castle he identifies with Stansted House, a stately home about two miles north of Emsworth which features in The Little Nugget as “Sanstead House.”\n\nreturn to text\n\nEarls of Marshmoreton (p. 7)\n\nThe similarity between Marshmoreton and Moreton-in-Marsh, a market town in Gloucestershire, is probably not coincidental. Moreton-in-Marsh lies less than 15 miles from Cheltenham, where Wodehouse’s parents lived from 1902.\n\nreturn to text\n\njack-rabbit (p. 7)\n\nJack-rabbits are not rabbits, but hares, of the genus Lepus. They are most active at night, spending much of the day-time lying in a flattened spot of grass or other vegetation; if startled, they run at a speed that few animals can match. Hares occur throughout much of Africa, Asia, Europe and North America, but the name “jack rabbit” is usually applied only to some of the North American species.\n\n[Diego Seguí notes that the US magazine and book versions specify “the Californian jack rabbit” here, so it would be the Lepus californicus, or black-tailed jackrabbit.]\n\nreturn to text\n\npicture-palaces (p. 7)\n\nA (rather old-fashioned) term for cinema.\n\n[The motion picture industry had advanced rapidly in importance during the 1910s, transitioning from mainly short subjects shown in improvised venues to mainly feature-length films often exhibited in purpose-built theatres with luxurious appointments and frequently exotic decorations. The best of these, the “picture palaces,” provided live music from orchestras and mighty organs, smartly uniformed ushers, atmospheric lighting effects, and other diversions designed to round out the entertainment effect of a visit to the cinema. —NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\ntwenty-first birthday (p. 7)\n\nAt the time when A Damsel in Distress was written, twenty-one was, in the United Kingdom, the legal age of majority, the age at which one acquires the full legal rights of an adult. Under the Family Law Reform Act 1969, the age of majority in England and Wales was lowered to 18 years with effect from 1 January 1970.\n\nreturn to text\n\nLord Belpher . . . Lady Patricia Maud Marsh . . . Lady Caroline Byng (p. 7)\n\nThe plethora of titles may be confusing. If, as is often the case, an English peer holds more than one title, his eldest son is customarily styled using one of the subsidiary titles; within the Wodehouse canon, the best-known example is Clarence, 9th Earl of Emsworth, whose elder son, George, is styled Viscount Bosham. In the present case, the Earl of Marshmoreton’s son, Percy, is styled using the courtesy title of Lord Belpher; his daughter, Maud, takes the honorific prefix “Lady,” hence is known as Lady Maud Marsh, Marsh being the family name; his sister, who, as a daughter of the 6th Earl, would have been styled Lady Caroline Marsh before her marriage, retains the honorific prefix with her married name.\n\nThe use of “Lord” or “Lady” by the Earl’s close relatives is solely a matter of courtesy and social usage; those so styled are regarded, in law, as commoners. Only the Earl has the legal status of a peer.\n\nreturn to text\n\nchatelaine (p. 8)\n\nA woman who has charge of a large house (from French châtelaine, the feminine form of châtelain, a castellan, or governor of a castle).\n\nreturn to text\n\na history of the family (p. 8)\n\nWodehouse’s formidable Aunt Mary Deane was the author of The Book of Dene, Deane, Adeane: A Genealogical History (1899); no doubt this influenced Wodehouse to include this task as an occupation for several of his characters. Lord Weeting, Florence Craye’s brother in “Disentangling Old Percy” (1912), begins writing a history of the family but abandons it when he is introduced to nightlife. In “Jeeves Takes Charge” (1916), Bertie’s Uncle Willoughby is supposed to be writing a history of the family, but Florence discovers that he has written his scandalous reminiscences including stories about her father and other eminent people. Lord Marshmoreton’s book appears to be the only one likely to make it to publication. [NM]\n\n[Diego Seguí notes that in Uncle Fred in the Springtime the Duke of Dunstable too is writing his own Family History, assisted by Baxter.]\n\nreturn to text\n\nKeggs the butler (p. 8)\n\nThere are several butlers named Keggs in Wodehouse’s stories; it is an appropriate name considering that one of a butler’s duties is the care and serving of alcoholic refreshment. The first Keggs mentioned is at Strathpuffer Castle in “An Official Muddle” (1903); there is another Keggs at Corven Abbey in The Gem Collector (1909). Other Keggses are the Keiths’ butler in “The Good Angel” (1910) (collected in The Man Upstairs) and in “Love Me, Love My Dog” (a short story published in Strand Magazine in August 1910); John Bannister’s butler in The Coming of Bill/The White Hope; and Augustus Keggs, now retired but formerly in the employment of Lord Uffenham (see Money in the Bank, Something Fishy and Ice in the Bedroom).\n\nThe similarly-named Coggs is Lord Ickenham’s butler in Uncle Fred in the Springtime and Uncle Dynamite.\n\nThe Keggs of “The Good Angel” may be the same individual as Keggs in A Damsel in Distress: as David Jasen points out, both engage in organising matrimonial sweepstakes. [Note expanded by NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\nthe voice of calumny (p. 8)\n\nThis personification of slander occurs frequently in 18th and 19th century literature, as, for example, in Walter Scott’s Kenilworth (ch. 11), Mary Wollstonecraft’s Maria (ch. 17), Fanny Burney’s Cecilia (bk 8, ch. 1) and Charles Dickens’s The Pickwick Papers (ch. 39), as well as in several theological works.\n\nreturn to text\n\nFarmers’ and Merchants’ Bank (p. 8)\n\nThe Farmers and Merchants Bank (now absorbed into the Bank of America) was the first bank to be incorporated in Los Angeles, California, and it played a major role in the early economic development of the city. While there are many unrelated banks of the same name in towns and cities across the US, no bank of this name seems to have existed in England.\n\nreturn to text\n\nOddfellows’ Hall (p. 8)\n\nThe Oddfellows is one of the largest and oldest friendly societies currently operating in the UK. Evolving from the mediaeval Trade Guilds, the Oddfellows began in the City of London in the late 17th and early 18th centuries and established local groups across England and Wales. In 1810 the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows was formed by a number of local groups joining together. As the idea caught on, more and more groups started up around the country, generally meeting in pubs and church halls and now many Branches own their own meeting place or Oddfellows hall.\n\nThe Oddfellows website\n\nAlthough the Oddfellows have several branches in the Portsmouth and Southampton area, there is no record of a Lodge in Emsworth.\n\nThe origin of the name Oddfellows is uncertain. One suggestion is that in the mediaeval period the “Odd Fellows” were associations of “fellows” (journeymen) from an odd assortment of trades, as distinct from the socially more prestigious craftsmen’s guilds, which were associations of master craftsmen from a single trade.\n\nreturn to text\n\ninductive reasoning (p. 8)\n\n“Yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now existing in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna’s bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co., of Stepney.”\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, “The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,” in The Return of Sherlock Holmes\n\nInductive reasoning is the process of drawing inferences from specific observations. For example, from previous experience that a guard dog does not usually bark at its owner and the fact that a particular guard dog did not bark during the night-time, one can reason inductively to the inference that the burglar may have been the dog’s owner. As Wodehouse clearly demonstrates, inductive reasoning yields inferences that are not necessarily true: another example of a false inference, based on countless observations of wild swans in Europe, is that all swans are white; it is immediately refuted by the sight of an Australian black swan.\n\nInductive reasoning is often contrasted with deductive reasoning, which derives a necessarily-true conclusion from previously known facts or premises; thus, if I am human and all humans are mortal, it necessarily follows, deductively, that I am mortal. (The premise that all humans are mortal is an inductive inference; the premise that I am human is occasionally questioned!)\n\nreturn to text\n\nwhale-oil solution (p. 9)\n\nSpraying with whale-oil solution, more precisely with a solution of whale-oil soap, used to be a recognised method for the control of insect pests on roses:\n\nThe Aphis (Aphis rosae), or Green Fly, is well known by all who have grown roses. . . Much the best destructive agent to use against them is tobacco smoke. . . Whale-oil soap, dissolved in water, is also a useful remedy.\n\nHenry Brooks Ellwanger, The rose; a treatise on the cultivation, history, family characteristics, pp 88–9 (1906)\n\nThe first leaves have scarcely appeared ere they are beset by the thrip or rose-hopper, almost immediately succeeded by the green fly, leaf-roller, rose-chafer and rose-slug. Were the sparrow of any earthly use, he would not leave these to hellebore, whale-oil soap, and Paris green.\n\nGeorge Herman Ellwanger, The garden’s story, p 188 (1891)\n\nreturn to text\n\nAthenæum Club (p. 9)\n\nThe Athenæum Club was founded in 1824. While most of London’s gentlemen’s clubs at that period attracted mainly those of independent wealth and status, the Athenæum Club aimed additionally to attract men “of distinguished eminence in Science, Literature, or the Arts, or for Public Service.” It used to number among its members so many bishops and other clerics that it was long regarded as a clergymen’s club; continuing this tradition, the late Cardinal Basil Hume was a member.\n\nThe club’s first chairman was the distinguished scientist Sir Humphrey Davy; the first secretary was a scientist who achieved even greater distinction, Michael Faraday. Other members have included Sir Walter Scott, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Cecil Rhodes, Walter de la Mare, Thackeray, Winston Churchill, Benjamin Disraeli, and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Rudyard Kipling is just one of over 50 members of the club who have been awarded the Nobel Prize, including at least one in each category of the prize.\n\nThe Athenæum Club occupies a handsome neoclassical building on the corner of Pall Mall and Waterloo Place.\n\nreturn to text\n\nHybrid teas (p. 9)\n\nHybrid teas are a group of rose cultivars, produced by crossing two other types, the Tea and the Hybrid Perpetual. The first hybrid teas were raised from the late 1860s. They are highly regarded for their colour and fragrance. The large flowers are usually borne singly on a long stem, which makes them particularly suitable as cut flowers.\n\nMost hybrid teas are hardy plants and can withstand a relatively cold winter, but they do require protection from severe cold and this, together with a lack of resistance to disease, makes them difficult to grow in the home garden.\n\nreturn to text\n\nTemple Flower Show (p. 9)\n\nThe Temple Flower Show, then called the Great Spring Show, was an exhibition of the Royal Horticultural Society, held annually in the gardens of the Inner Temple in London from 1888 to 1911. In 1912, the show was cancelled to make way for the Royal International Horticultural Exhibition, which was held in the grounds of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea; when the Great Spring Show resumed, in 1913, it was held at Chelsea, where it remains today and is now known as the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nreturn to text\n\nrose-slugs, rose-beetles . . . (p. 9–10)\n\nRose-slug is the name given to the larvae of certain sawflies which cause damage to rose bushes by eating away the fleshy part of the leaves, leaving only the veins and stalk untouched. Sawflies are the most primitive members of the insect order Hymenoptera, and are distantly related to bees and wasps. Over 400 species of sawfly have been recorded in Britain. Many feed on a specific type of plant, from which they derive their common name, such as Gooseberry sawfly, Pine sawfly, etc; those which show a partiality for roses include the Rose-slug sawfly, Endelomyia aethiops, and the Bristly rose slug, Cladius difformis.\n\nRose-beetle is another name for the rose chafer, Cetonia aurata, a member of the family Scarabaeidae and thus a relative of the dung beetles. The adult rose chafer is a bright metallic-green and measures 14–20 mm in length; it feeds mainly on the petals of roses and other plants. The larvae live in decaying plant material such as compost, peat and rotten wood; unlike the larvae of many other chafers, which do considerable economic damage to cereal crops and grassland, the larvae of the rose chafer do not feed on plant roots.\n\nThe rose-hopper, or rose leafhopper (Edwardsiana rosae, is a small yellowish-white insect, about four millimetres long, with transparent wings. While its behaviour is as Wodehouse describes it, there is some terminological confusion because the rose leafhopper is not a thrips and, indeed, belongs to a different insect order, the Hemiptera, or “true bugs.” According to H. B. Ellwanger (see above), a solution of whale-oil soap is an effective remedy for rose leafhoppers.\n\nThrips are tiny, slender insects with fringed wings; they comprise the order Thysanoptera (from the Greek thysanos: fringe + pteron: wing). Unlike the rose leafhopper, thrips are tiny black insects and are usually to be found deep within the flower head, rather than under the leaves. The word thrips is both singular and plural; thrip is erroneous.\n\nreturn to text\n\nAttila the Hun (p. 10)\n\nAttila was born c. 406 AD. In 434, he became ruler of the Huns, jointly with his brother Bleda until the latter’s death, c. 445, thereafter sole ruler until his own death in 453. During his reign, Attila forged an empire that extended over much of Europe, from Germany and the Netherlands to the Ural river, and from the Danube to Poland and Estonia. In 451, Attila invaded Gaul, reaching Orleans before being repulsed by a coalition of Romans, Visigoths and Franks; the two armies met at a place usually assumed to be near Châlons-en-Champagne, where they fought the Battle of Chalons. Though the Visigoth king was killed during the battle, it was Attila who was forced to retreat. After an indecisive invasion of Italy in 452, Attila retreated across the Danube. He died the following year, in circumstances that are still debated. Following his death, his three sons fought over his legacy, the Huns became disunited, and within a year Attila’s empire had dissolved.\n\nIn western culture, Attila is a byword for barbarism and cruelty, though many historians now believe that this is partly due to a confusion with other so-called “barbarians” and that Attila, and the Huns in general, were far more civilised than they are usually depicted. In the Germanic epics, Attila appears as Etzel in the Nibelungenlied and as Atli in the Volsunga Saga and the Poetic Edda.\n\n[Diego Seguí notes that Dahlia Travers once compared her nephew Bertie Wooster to Attila:]\n\n“Attila,” she said at length. “That’s the name. Attila, the Hun.”\n\n“Eh?”\n\n“I was trying to think who you reminded me of. Somebody who went about strewing ruin and desolation and breaking up homes which, until he came along, had been happy and peaceful. Attila is the man. It’s amazing,” she said, drinking me in once more. “To look at you, one would think you were just an ordinary sort of amiable idiot—certifiable, perhaps, but quite harmless. Yet, in reality, you are a worse scourge than the Black Death.”\n\nRight Ho, Jeeves, ch. 20\n\nreturn to text\n\nGenghis Khan (p. 10)\n\nTemüjin, known to history as Genghis Khan, was born c. 1162 AD. He rose to become the undisputed leader of the Mongols and established the basis of the Mongol Empire. Temüjin took the name Genghis Khan in 1206 when, having succeeded, by a combination of war and diplomacy, in uniting all the tribes of the Mongolian plains, he was acknowledged by a council of Mongol chiefs as their “khan,” or leader. Having united the Mongols, Genghis Khan set about conquering their neighbours, and by the time he died, in 1227, the Mongol empire extended from the Caspian Sea in the west to the Sea of Japan in the east; Mongol armies had also raided as far west as the Crimea. Under Genghis Khan’s successors, the Mongol Empire was expanded to encompass the whole of China, Burma and the Korean peninsula, southern Russia from the Sea of Okhotsk to modern-day Belarus and Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tibet.\n\nLike Attila, but with more justification, Genghis Khan has a reputation for savage cruelty. Though he usually offered his enemies relatively fair terms if they would submit without a fight, he and his successors were ruthless in exterminating those who resisted; cities, such as Samarkand, that opposed the Mongols were devastated and their inhabitants slaughtered. Accurate numbers for those killed by the Mongols during the 13th and 14th centuries cannot be established, but estimates range as high as tens of millions.\n\nreturn to text\n\nhorny-handed toiler (p. 10)\n\nThe phrase “horny-handed toiler” appears in a pamphlet written, in 1865, by a Boston-based unionist, Ira Seward, as part of a campaign for reduced working hours. In modified form, as “horny-handed sons of toil,” it appears in the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, attributed to Denis Kearney, an Irish-born political activist, in a speech he made at San Francisco around 1878. The spoonerism “tons of soil” is frequently, though without any evidence, attributed to William Spooner himself, while the (probably apocryphal) newspaper headline “Sons of toil buried under tons of soil,” as relating to a mining accident, is also frequently quoted, again without adequate citation.\n\nreturn to text\n\nplastic\n\nThis is one of the older senses of the word; the meaning here is “moldable” or easily shaped into a given form, like a sculptor’s clay. The modern sense of an artificial polymer material such as vinyl or polyethylene had only begun to be used in chemical engineering and had not reached general literature when this book was written. Still less should this be read in the modern pop-psychological sense of “insincere or artificial in emotional interactions”; that usage goes no further back than the 1960s. [NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\n“topper”\n\nWe hear this in Bertie’s slang so often, as well as in the speech of his contemporaries, that it is surprising to find OED citations back to 1709 and through the nineteenth century to mean someone or something excellent. Of course it can mean a top hat as well; that sense goes back to 1820, and Wodehouse uses it that way too. But the ones below are in the “best in class” sense of the present quotation. [NM]\n\n“You know, Jeeves, you’re by way of being rather a topper!”\n\n“Jeeves Takes Charge”\n\n“I think,” he proceeded a little feverishly, “that you are the most indescribable topper that ever—”\n\nGinger Kemp, in The Adventures of Sally\n\n“They’ll give three hearty cheers and think you a topper.”\n\nArchie Moffam, in Indiscretions of Archie\n\nreturn to text\n\nThey say absence makes the heart grow fonder. (p. 11)\n\nThe first to say so may have been the Latin poet Sextus Aurelius Propertius (c 50–15 BC):\n\nsemper in absentis felicior aestus amantis\n\n(absence always increases lovers’ passion)\n\nElegies, Book 2, XXXIII\n\nThe phrase was popularised by the English poet and songwriter Thomas Haynes Bayly (1797–1839) in his poem “Isle of Beauty.” The poem was part of the collection “Songs to Rosa,” which, with a melody by Charles Chapland Whitmore and musical arrangement by Thomas A. Rawlings, was published in 1826:\n\nWhen the waves are round me breaking,\n\nAs I pace the deck alone,\n\nAnd my eye in vain is seeking\n\nSome green leaf to rest upon,\n\nWhat would I not give to wander,\n\nWhere my old companions dwell . . .\n\nAbsence makes the heart grow fonder;\n\nIsle of Beauty “fare thee well”!\n\nThe song was sufficiently popular that it is mentioned in a letter dated 20 October 1831, written by Elizabeth Cleghorn Stevenson (Mrs. Gaskell) to her friend Harriet Carr.\n\nIn Wodehouse, the sentiment is endorsed by Jeremy Garnet in Love Among the Chickens, ch. 9; by the narrator of The White Hope in Book Two, Chapter III (1914); by Sam Shotter in Sam the Sudden, ch. 21.1 (1925; serialized as Sam in the Suburbs, ch. 26); and by Hamilton Beamish in The Small Bachelor, ch. 8 (1926). Doubters include Lady Caroline Byng, as here, and Bertie Wooster in “Jeeves and the Spot of Art” (1929; in Very Good, Jeeves, 1930). [NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\nStuff! (p. 12)\n\nAnother form of the exclamation “Stuff and nonsense!”—which Lord Marshmoreton himself uses to George in Chapter 16. The combined phrase dates back to 1749 in Fielding’s Tom Jones; the one-word interjection is even older, in Farquhar’s Sir Henry Wildair (1701). The noun sense meaning worthless material, padding, rubbish is even older. [NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\ndashed affair (p. 12)\n\nIn less permissive times, “damned,” used as an oath, was usually printed as “d–––d,” from which arose the practice of substituting the descriptive “dashed” in its place.\n\nreturn to text\n\nReggie … wabbled in his tracks\n\nWodehouse often uses this older form of wobble [OED derives both forms from Dutch wabbelen, to move to and fro] especially to describe people who are hesitating or having trouble making up their minds, or things such as golf clubs controlled by such people; sometimes editors would change this to wobble in books or in British magazines, as in the following cases among many others.

Nowadays, the service from Portsmouth to London Victoria makes a scheduled stop at Emsworth, from where the fastest journey takes approximately 2 hours, but at a time when express services made unscheduled stops on request, it is not improbable that Emsworth could have been a request stop. The journey time can be reduced by about 10 minutes by going one station west, to Havant, and joining the Portsmouth to London (Waterloo) express.\n\nreturn to text\n\nSocial Progress League at Lewisham (p. 15)\n\nPossibly from his time at Dulwich, Wodehouse would have known Lewisham, a suburb in South London just 2–3 miles to the east, as a largely working-class area and thus just the sort of place where a social reform movement might hope to be effective. Whether a real Social Progress League existed (in England: there was one in New Zealand) has not been established, but as a generic name it could cover a wide range of activities: Lady Caroline’s attitudes would tend to rule out socialism, women’s suffrage or anything else that might alter the existing social order; the temperance movement, welfare for “fallen women,” and similar worthy causes would seem more likely to attract her energies.\n\nreturn to text\n\ncorrect stance for his approach-shots (p. 15)\n\nAt the time he was writing A Damsel in Distress, Wodehouse was living at Great Neck, Long Island, near the Sound View Golf Course, which became the setting for many of his golf stories. Although he had already written a few stories with a golfing background (“A Woman is Only a Woman” was published just a few months before A Damsel in Distress), this is the first of his novels to make extensive use of the comic possibilities of golfing jargon such as “correct stance” and “approach shots.”\n\n[NM notes that there is quite a bit of comic use of golf terms in both the 1906 and 1921 versions of Love Among the Chickens including “foozled a drive” and “decapitated his brassy on the occasion of his striking Dorsetshire instead of his ball.” Diego Seguí comments that the story “A Woman Is Only a Woman” appeared in the Saturday Evening Post of June 7, 1919, in the same issue as Part 5 of the serialization of A Damsel in Distress, which ran from May 10 through June 28, so most if not all the golf references in the novel came before the story appearance.]\n\nreturn to text\n\ntroubled spirit (p. 15)\n\nBut they my troubled spirit rule,\n\nFor they controll’d me when a boy;\n\nThey bring me sorrow touch’d with joy,\n\nThe merry merry bells of Yule.\n\nAlfred, Lord Tennyson, “In Memoriam,” stanza XXVIII\n\nreturn to text\n\nsoul in torment (p. 15)\n\nAnd there in the middle of it was the man himself, his face twisted like a lost soul in torment, and his great brindled beard stuck upwards in his agony.\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle, “The Adventure of Black Peter,” in The Return of Sherlock Holmes\n\nreturn to text\n\nthe mater (p. 16)\n\nLatin: mother.

The club was founded in 1851 and from then until 1864 the Keeper of the Green was the legendary ”Old” Tom Morris. In 1860, Prestwick was the venue for the first Open Championship, which was played there each year until 1870, since when the venue has rotated among a small number of links courses. Prestwick was the venue in 1914, when Harry Vardon won the last Open before war brought the annual event to a temporary halt. Tam Duggan and Alec Fraser may be real people, but it is more probable that they are generic Scots names; there is no record of anyone of either name having won a tournament of any note, at Prestwick or any other venue, in the years preceding the writing of A Damsel in Distress.\n\n[Three up and two to play indicates that the tournament was match play, scored by holes won rather than cumulative strokes taken.

When an actress or any girl on the stage smiled at or ogled a friend in the audience, she was said to mash him, and “mashing” was always punishable by a fine deducted from the wages of the offender. It occurred to the writer that it must have been derived from the gypsy mash (masher-ava) to allure, to entice.

The name was subsequently extended to any area within a major city that has a high concentration of music publishers and musical instrument stores, such as Denmark Street, near Covent Garden, London, which has been known since the 1920s as “Britain’s Tin Pan Alley.” Later still, “Tin Pan Alley” came to be used as a colloquial term for the world of music composing and publishing, and for popular music generally (usually—as in this instance—with a slightly derogatory reference to the commercial and unadventurous nature of the music).\n\nThe origin of the phrase is uncertain: the OED cites the use, in 1885, of “tin-panning” to refer to “a great uproar being caused by the beating of old trays, kettles, etc.” and it is often suggested that “Tin Pan Alley” referred to the cacophony produced by many musical instruments playing different tunes in a small area.

It was originally founded in 1810 as the Maidenhead Academy and went through several changes of name before its current name, “The Lawrenceville School,” was adopted during its refounding in 1883. The school is located in Lawrence, New Jersey, just a few miles from Princeton. Lawrenceville featured in several novels written by one of its alumni, Owen Johnson (class of 1895); one of the novels, The Varmint was made into a motion picture in 1950. The novelist and playwright Thornton Wilder taught French at the school in the 1920s (he received his MA in French from nearby Princeton in 1926).\n\nHarvard University is a private university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is one of the eight institutions (Princeton and Yale are others) that collectively comprise the Ivy League.

In 1916, as Britain’s engagement in the First World War was becoming even more intense, and as the USA entered the war in 1917, governments in both countries suggested reductions in “non-essential industries” in order to free up manpower, materials, fuel, transport, and so forth for the war effort.

Unless it is expressly agreed by the parties or implied by the nature of the contract, the time allowed for performance of a contract is not of the essence and the contracting parties are allowed a reasonable amount of time in which to fulfil their obligations. If it is important that performance of the contract take place as quickly as possible, it is usual to insert a clause stating that “time is of the essence.” Alternatively, if one party to a contract has failed to perform its obligations, the other party can issue a notice making time of the essence and, if non-performance continues, will become entitled to terminate the contract and sue for damages.\n\nreturn to text\n\ngetting to some public house and leaning against the wall\n\nBottleton East, down Limehouse way, was one of those primitive communities where the native sons, largely recruited from the costermongering and leaning-up-against-the-walls-of-public-houses industries, have a primitive sense of humour and think things funny which are not funny at all.\n\nCocktail Time, ch. 2 (1958) [NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\nthe two Bohemians (p. 39)\n\nIt is unlikely that the pair are, in fact, natives of Bohemia.

And should he, in the course of removing the young man’s silk hat, inflict even the most minor injury, he could be charged with the offence of battery. If he were to carry out his threat and break the young man’s jaw, he could be charged with the crime of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which carries a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment.\n\nUnder §42 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, charges of common assault or battery could be heard by two magistrates (acting without a jury) and, if found guilty, the offender could be fined a maximum of £200 or imprisoned in the common gaol for up to two months.\n\n§39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 essentially retained this status by defining common assault and battery as “summary offences,” which means that they can be dealt with summarily, without the need for an indictment and with no right to trial by jury.

For a perfect example of a theatrical female with a disposition to kick, see Mabel Hobson in ch. 6 of The Adventures of Sally (1921/22) [NM]\n\nreturn to text\n\ntrinitrotoluol (p. 57)\n\nTrinitrotoluol, or trinitrotoluene (TNT), is a chemical reagent and explosive. It is one of the most commonly-used military and commercial explosives, not least because it is insensitive to shocks and friction, is comparatively stable, neither absorbs nor dissolves in water, and can be melted and poured at temperatures well below those at which it will spontaneously detonate. First produced in 1863, it was originally used as a dye and, because it is so difficult to detonate, its explosive qualities were not immediately recognised.\n\nThe amount of energy released in an explosion of a unit quantity (e.g., kiloton or megaton) of TNT is frequently used to quantify the energy released in large explosions, such as nuclear weapon tests and asteroid impacts.\n\nreturn to text\n\ntroubadour of the Middle Ages (p. 57)\n\nTroubadours were composers and performers of lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (1100–1350). The troubador tradition began in the Occitan-speaking region of southern and south-western France, from where it spread to Spain and Italy. The art of the troubadors declined during the early 14th century and died out around the time of the Black Death (1348), which killed an estimated 30–60% of the population of Europe.\n\nThe troubadors were professional entertainers, some of whom wandered from court to court. More typically, a troubador would gain the patronage of a wealthy noble and would become part of the noble’s household, staying in the one place as long as the patronage continued. While many troubador songs dealt with themes such as chivalry and courtly love, many were also comic or satirical, and a troubador who sang of unrequited love was not necessarily any more troubled in love than a modern-day pop singer.\n\nreturn to text\n\nin a cuppy lie (p. 57)\n\nSee The Clicking of Cuthbert.\n\nreturn to text\n\n“Ships that pass in the night!” (p. 58)\n\nShips that pass in the night and speak each other in passing;\n\nOnly a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;\n\nSo on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,\n\nOnly a look and a voice; then darkness again and a silence.\n\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, Tales of a Wayside Inn, Part III, “The Theologian’s Tale: Elizabeth,” iv (1863)\n\nreturn to text\n\nPiccadilly Grill-room (p. 59)\n\nThe Piccadilly Hotel, on Piccadilly Circus, was built in 1905–08 on the site of the former St James’s Hall. The hotel’s grill-room became a very popular eating-place, especially in the evening, when a small orchestra entertained the diners, its performances often being broadcast live on radio. The hotel is now known as Le Méridien Piccadilly.\n\nreturn to text\n\nEvening News (p. 59)\n\nThe Evening News was launched in London in July 1881. In 1960 it absorbed the Star, which had been published since 1888. The Evening News ceased publication in 1980 after merging with the Evening Standard; the latter, originally known simply as the Standard, has been published continuously since 1827.\n\nreturn to text\n\nthat admirable slop (p. 60)\n\n“Slop” here means “policeman”; it is an example of “back slang,” where a word is written backwards and a new word coined from the result, in this case “ecilop” or “esclop,” hence “slop” — another example is “yobbo,” or “yob,” which originated as back-slang for “boy.”\n\nSee also The Code of the Woosters.\n\nreturn to text\n\nBurke’s Peerage (p. 61)\n\nBurke’s Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage is a guide to the titled families of Great Britain and Ireland. It was first published in 1826 by a British genealogist, John Burke, under the title Burke’s Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was revised annually between 1840 and 1940, except for a hiatus from 1917 to 1923, but subsequent revisions were infrequent(there were none between 1970 and 1999); the last print edition was published in 2003, since when further revisions are being made available only online.\n\nWhen “A Damsel in Distress” was written, Burke’s Peerage was still recognised as a major authority on genealogical matters. In recent years that status has been eroded somewhat by a rash of publications, some of very inferior quality, bearing the name “Burke’s,” though unconnected with Burke’s Peerage.\n\nreturn to text\n\nChapter 6 (pp. 62–79)\n\nBoots (p. 62)\n\nSlang: “An appellation given to the youngest officer in a regiment, junior member of a club, etc.” (OED).\n\nreturn to text\n\nNot so dusty (p. 62)\n\nIn the 17th century, one meaning of “dusty” was “mean, worthless, vile” (OED), a usage that has survived only in this slang expression, meaning “not so bad.”\n\nreturn to text\n\nBow Street Police Court (p. 63)\n\nMore correctly, Bow Street Magistrates’ Court.\n\nBow Street is in central London, close to Covent Garden. It has been home to a magistrates’ court since c. 1739, when Colonel Thomas de Veil sat as a magistrate in his home at No 4. In 1747, the novelist Henry Fielding was appointed a Justice of the Peace (i.e. magistrate) and held court in the same house. A purpose-built magistrates’ court was opened in Bow Street in 1881 and continued in operation until 2006.\n\nAs well as dealing with summary offences (such as Lord Belpher’s), Bow Street Magistrates’ Court was, for much of its history, the office of the Senior District Judge (Magistrates’ Courts) and, as such, was the venue for the preliminary hearings of many famous cases that were eventually transferred, on indictment, to the Central Criminal Court (“Old Bailey”). Among those who passed through the Bow Street court are: Roger Casement and William Joyce (“Lord Haw-Haw”), both subsequently executed for treason; Dr. Crippen, who was hanged for murder; the suffragette sisters, Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst; and Oscar Wilde.\n\nreturn to text\n\nthe raspberry (p. 64)\n\nA “raspberry” is a derisive sound made by keeping the lips closed and forcing air over the tongue; it derives from rhyming slang (“raspberry tart” = fart) and has been dated to 1875 by Eric Partridge (A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English). The US equivalent is the “Bronx cheer” (which Wodehouse uses in Hot Water).\n\nAccording to the OED, the first recorded use of “raspberry” in a figurative sense, to signify “a refusal; a reprimand, disapproval; dismissal” is from W. A. Lathrop, also from 1919; earlier OED editions listed this sentence from the current book and the one quoted below from a short story, dated 1923 from its book collection, which should have been dated to its original 1918 magazine appearance:\n\nHe would seem . . . to have blown in one morning at seven-forty-five . . .

Figuratively, to “blot one’s escutcheon” is to stain one’s reputation.\n\n. . . your uncle by marriage, Ebenezer, popularly supposed to be the one blot on your family escutcheon, may turn out to be an angel unawares with a sovereign to bestow.\n\n“Concerning Relations” in Public School Magazine, March 1901\n\nMy late Uncle Henry, you see, was by way of being the blot on the Wooster escutcheon.\n\n“Sir Roderick Comes to Lunch” (1922, also in The Inimitable Jeeves, 1923)\n\nSee also Sam the Sudden, Heavy Weather, Lord Emsworth and Others.\n\nreturn to text\n\nshame and agony and what not\n\nThe phrase “and what not” is of course standard English, especially as the final item of a list, meaning “and anything else”—a native equivalent to et cetera. But Wodehouse seems to use it also as a marker for the speech of his knuts and dudes. Eleven of the twelve instances in the present book are in the words or thoughts of Reggie Byng, and many of them are at the end of a “list” of one item, especially when advice is being given or something potentially embarrassing is being discussed; the usage seems self-deprecatory, as if to say “Here’s what I think, but I might have chosen a better word.”\n\n“I say, mater, dear old soul,” said Reggie hastily, “I think you’d better tear yourself away and what not.”\n\nChapter 1\n\n“Well, what I mean to say is—family row and what not—if you see what I mean—I’ve one or two things I ought to do——”\n\nLater in Chapter 6\n\nAnd so forth. The phrase is also very frequent in the speech of Archie Moffam, beginning with the first Archie story:\n\n“Bit embarrassing, all this, what!” said Archie, chattily. “I mean to say, having met before in less happy circs and what not. Rum coincidence and so forth!”\n\n“The Man Who Married an Hotel” (1920, also in Indiscretions of Archie, 1921)\n\nAnd of course Bertie Wooster says it early and often; sometimes it just means et cetera but it can also show the detachment of the dude who is unwilling to commit himself to a straight statement:\n\nI couldn’t help feeling that this visit of his to America was going to be one of those times that try men’s souls and what not.\n\nOne of eight instances in “Jeeves and the Chump Cyril” (1918, also in The Inimitable Jeeves, 1923)\n\nHis [Bingo’s] finely-chiselled features were twisted with agony and what not, and he asked me what the dickens I thought I was playing at.\n\n“Scoring Off Jeeves” (1922, also in The Inimitable Jeeves, 1923)\n\n[NM]\n\nDiego Seguí adds:\n\nWodehouse is also fond of its use as a noun: “a whatnot” or “what-not”, meaning “something undefined, a what-is-it” or as a euphemism (often “son of a what-not”).\n\nNM also finds its use as a noun simply referring to an item of furniture in Bill the Conqueror.\n\nreturn to text\n\nfilled his cup of pleasure (p. 64)\n\nThey, too, added their quota to my cup of pleasure by being distinctly frigid.\n\nNot George Washington, ch. 26\n\nreturn to text\n\n“His Nibs” (p. 65)\n\nNibs (or Nabs), subst (colloquial) — Self: His Nibs = the person referred to; Your Nibs = yourself; My Nibs = myself.\n\nFarmer & Henley, Slang and Its Analogues, Past and Present, vol 5 (1902)\n\nAccording to the OED, “now chiefly: the person in authority, as an employer, superior, etc. (frequently used ironically or with the implication that the person referred to has an excessive sense of his or her own importance) . . . usually with possessive adjective as a mock title, as his nibs, her nibs, etc.”\n\nreturn to text\n\na Socialist (p. 65)\n\nIn 1919, when A Damsel in Distress was published, English politics was still dominated by the Liberal and Conservative parties and Socialists were viewed by many as revolutionaries who, left to themselves, would bring upon the country the sort of turmoil still, at that time, being experienced in revolutionary Russia.\n\nreturn to text\n\nintellectually he considered him negligible (p. 65)\n\nShades of Jeeves and Wooster!\n\n“You will find Mr. Wooster,” he was saying to the substitute chappie, “an exceedingly pleasant and amiable young gentleman, but not intelligent.
