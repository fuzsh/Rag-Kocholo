        "text": "An incredibly prolific English poet, George Herbert was also a devout Anglican priest. Faith and talent combined so that all his poetry was written for the glory of God.\n\nHis voracious reading of poetry, combined with his talent and cultivation of his gifts, allowed him to produce some great works. Though Herbert didn’t seek literary fame, his poems garnered strong responses. Some pieces shocked people. Others were well-received. Either way, his work influenced many other poets in his day and for years to come.\n\nWhat Do We Know about George Herbert’s Family?\n\nGeorge Herbert came from a large Welsh family and was born in 1593.\n\nHis father died when he was three. His mother, Magdalen Newport, raised Herbert along with her nine other children and ensured they received a good education. Newport was a great admirer of the poet John Donne.\n\nHerbert was schooled at Westminster School in London, followed by university studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. He received his bachelor’s degree in 1613 and his master’s in 1616.\n\nHerbert’s siblings included his famous brother, Edward Herbert. Edward was a philosopher, studied at Oxford, and was the Baron of Herbert Castle. Like his brother, Edward was incredibly prolific, a voracious reader, and led an interesting life as an academic, traveler, musician, and satirist. Some of Edward’s most famous works are The Life and Reign of King Henry the Eighth, published in 1649, and De Veritate, published in 1624.\n\nWhat Were George Herbert’s Accomplishments as a Priest?\n\nHerbert’s life was not always easy. From 1626 to 1629, Herbert experienced difficult health issues, the loss of his mother, and great poverty. Things began to get better after his marriage to Jane Danvers in 1629 and his decision to pursue the calling of becoming a priest. By pursuing this clerical calling, Herbert became a better writer and developed a deeper faith in Christ.\n\nIn 1630, Herbert was ordained as an Anglican priest in the Church of England. He then became the rector at a parish in Bemerton. During his three years as a priest, Herbert gladly served the people in his parish by caring for them, giving them the sacraments, and performing morning and night prayers. Herbert was well known as a humble servant of Christ that truly lived out his vocational calling.\n\nAfter Herbert died in 1633, his most important work, The Temple Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations, was published. This volume of poetry conveys the tension between doubt and faith Herbert experienced in his life, his love for writing and language, and his gratitude to Christ for the sacramental gift of life.\n\nTwo great literary examples of Herbert’s accomplishment as a priest and poet are the completion of his well-known poems “Christmas” and “Love III.” These two poems are not just well-crafted verses. They provide something universal for any person to relate to. Herbert knew as a priest what it meant to suffer, pray, and celebrate with his congregation. Herbert did not allow the social status of being an Anglican priest as an excuse to seek comfort and security in money or prestige. Herbert knew he was called to serve God’s people and fulfilled that calling to the best of his ability.\n\n“Christmas” was published in 1633 and captures the wonder of Jesus’ Incarnation in the first century. For Christians, Christmas is not just for gathering with family, spreading good cheer, and giving presents. At its root, it is a time to reflect on the coming of the Prince of Peace that became the suffering servant. The speaker in the poem conveys the emptiness experienced after pursuing vain hedonistic pleasures. After the painful shame and grief, the speaker finds that the same God who became incarnate through the Virgin Mary on a cold night in Israel is the same God who comforted them in their grief.\n\n“Love III” was published in 1633 and is a poignant description of Christ’s agape love. The speaker in the poem expresses a reluctance to be forgiven by Christ after experiencing a painful fall from grace. After struggling with the tension of either despair or surrender, the speaker makes a choice: surrender. They find themselves welcomed home to a celebratory feast as the prodigal son was, recorded in Luke 15. This poem is a great work Christians all around the world can relate to. It is honest about the shame that comes from not living up to one’s own standards. However, it also affirms the freedom and joy found in Christ, whose agape is greater than despair and sin.\n\nWhat Does It Mean that George Herbert Was a Metaphysical Poet?\n\nHerbert was part of the seventeenth-century literary movement known as the metaphysical poets. Other members included John Donne, Andrew Marvell, Henry Vaughan, Abraham Cowley, and Richard Crashaw.\n\nThese poets explored theological and philosophical themes in their poetry by seeking to convey how the divine is experienced in life by people. These poets rejected scientific materialism and proclaimed that the purpose of humankind was to glorify God and enjoy him forever. The Bible, Greek philosophy, different mythologies, and metaphysics all inspired the metaphysical poets. Many people have found great spiritual nourishment in their work, and they continue to be studied extensively by academics today.\n\nWho Are Some Christian Poets that George Herbert Influenced?\n\nHerbert’s work went on to inform various poets. Two are particularly worth noting.\n\nHerbert was a great influence on C.S. Lewis. While better remembered today for his apologetics and fiction, Lewis began his writing career as a poet, publishing the works Spirits in Bondage and Dymer. He would continue to write poetry throughout his life. Lewis read The Temple numerous times, gaining great spiritual nourishment from it. In Surprised by Joy, Lewis included Herbert in a list of writers he discovered as an atheist and was surprised to find out were Christians—writers whose works helped lead him to faith. Lewis recommended Herbert’s poetry to many of his correspondents and highly praised Herbert not only in Surprised by Joy but in his literary study The Oxford History of English Literature Excluding Drama.\n\nAnother notable poet influenced by Herbert was T.S. Eliot, considered one of the twentieth century’s greatest poets. Among other things, Eliot the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1948. Eliot wrote a critical study of Herbert’s poetry in 1962. The book is a great work of literary scholarship exploring Herbert as a great man with an incredible understanding of language and a God-given talent that he used well.\n\nBest Books by George Herbert\n\nHerbert’s work has been collected in several books, including The Complete Poetry edited by John Drury.\n\nShop Now\n\nOther great collections of his work include:\n\nHerbert Poems (Everyman’s Library Pocket Poet series)\n\nShop Now\n\nThe English Poems of George Herbert edited by Helen Wilcox\n\nShop Now\n\nThe Temple edited by Henry L.
