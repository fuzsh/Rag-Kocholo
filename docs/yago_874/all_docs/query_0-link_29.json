        "text": "The Schindlers lived in an area called Sudetenland. It became part of Czechoslovakia in 1918. Like many others there, the Schindlers were ethnic Germans. In 1935 Schindler joined a pro-Nazi party and began spying in Czechoslovakia for the German military. Germany took over the Sudetenland in 1938. Schindler joined the Nazi Party the next year.\n\nAfter Germany occupied Poland in 1939, Schindler went to Kraków, Poland. He opened a factory there. By 1942 nearly half of his workers were Jewish. The same year the Nazis decided to kill all the Jews in areas controlled by Germany.\n\nAt first, Schindler kept his Jewish workers safe by bribing German officials. In 1944 Schindler’s factory was moved to Brnenec, Czechoslovakia, close to his hometown. Before the move, Schindler, Emilie, and his staff made a list of Jewish workers he said he needed for the new factory. Eventually, about 1,100 workers arrived at Brnenec. They spent the remainder of the war building ammunition that was made to fail. The Jews he saved came to be called Schindlerjuden.\n\nThe war ended in Europe on May 8, 1945. Schindler and Emilie fled the next day with the help of the Schindlerjuden. He eventually moved to West Germany and spent the rest of his life supported by donations from the Schindlerjuden.\n\nSchindler was declared a Righteous Gentile (a non-Jewish person who helped Jews during the Holocaust) in Israel in 1962. Schindler died on October 9, 1974, in Hildesheim, West Germany, and was buried in Jerusalem.\n\nSchindler’s story was mostly known only among Holocaust survivors until Schindler’s Ark by Thomas Keneally was published in 1982. The novel was used as the basis for the film Schindler’s List (1993)."
