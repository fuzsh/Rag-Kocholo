        "text": "The story came to international attention through Thomas Keneally's book Schindler's Ark (1982), which was later made into the film Schindler's List (1993), directed by Steven Spielberg. Both accounts dealt with the fact that Oskar Schindler, for all his finer qualities, was a serial womaniser. He eventually abandoned his wife to a life of poverty in Argentina in 1957; he died in Germany in 1974 without ever seeing her again.\n\nAfter the film came out, Emilie Schindler published a memoir, Where Light and Shadow Meet (1997), and gave a series of interviews in which she vented her bitterness at her husband's posthumous fame. She complained that neither Keneally's book nor Spielberg's film had made much of her part in saving the Schindlerjuden, and she sought to put the record straight. She drew attention to the complexity of her husband's motives, claiming that he had been acting at least partly out of self interest. Without his factory and its workforce, she argued, he would have been sent to the Eastern Front, and he was, by her account, a coward fond of brandy and fine clothes.\n\nAgainst that, she testified that he had no trace of anti-Semitism and that he counted his workers among his friends, and indeed his mistresses. Keneally, who met Emilie Schindler for the first time 11 years after the publication of his book, conceded: \"The truth is, if I were writing the book now, I would probably write about Oskar differently. You could say he was a jovial philanderer, but by another name he was a sexist brute.\"\n\nEmilie Schindler was born Emilie Pelzl on October 22 1907 at Alt Moletein, Bohemia, a German-speaking enclave in what became Czechoslovakia. She and her elder brother grew up among geese and cows on the family farm. Aged 14, she boarded for a year at an austere convent before completing her education at an agricultural school. As a girl, Emilie was fascinated by the gypsies in Alt Moletein and one day a gypsy woman read her palm. \"I see, child, that your lifeline is long . . . \" the woman said, \"but you will also experience much pain and suffering. You will meet a man who will take you away from here. You will love him above all, although you will not be happy at his side . . . \"\n\nEmilie was 20 when she first met Oskar Schindler, who had come with his father to sell the Pelzles some new motors to supply their house with electricity. Oskar's visits became more frequent until one day, taking Emilie by the hand, he said to her parents: \"I want to unite my life to Emilie's so that we can build a future together.\"\n\nAfter their marriage in 1928 they went to live with Oskar's parents at the industrial city of Zwittau, where Emilie spent her days cooking, sewing and listening to her mother-in-law, who never stopped repeating: \"Oskar is now married, and it is his wife's obligation to educate him, my dear Emilie.\"\n\nIn 1935, Oskar Schindler joined the German Counter-Intelligence Service (Abwehrdienst) in Krakow. Following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, he was offered the administration of an enamelware factory that had been owned by Jewish industrialists and was renamed Deutsch Emailwaren Fabrik (German Enamelware Factory). In 1942 he bought the factory from its owners, who made it a condition that Schindler employ Jewish workers from the nearby Krakow ghetto. Schindler obtained authorisation from the SS to employ the Jews, and the workers were elected according to their capabilities, health and age, and then transferred to the Plaschow concentration camp on the outskirts of the city.\n\nLater the Germans decided to close the plant and the nearby Plaschow camp and send all the prisoners, including Schindler's workers, to the death camp of Auschwitz. But when Schindler was given the chance to establish a munitions factory at Brunnlitz, a small Czechoslovakian town, he determined to take with him his Jewish workers.\n\nA list was prepared of Jews whom Schindler would take to Brunnlitz; it included the names of some 300 who worked at the enamelware factory, 750 from the Plaschow concentration camp, and others recommended by prominent local Jews. A problem arose, however, when the Mayor of Brunnlitz objected that a munitions factory could become a target for Allied bombing raids. Emilie Schindler asked her husband to let her handle the matter and went to see the mayor. When she walked into his office, she was confronted by her old swimming teacher. They talked about old times, and she left with a permit allowing them to establish the factory.\n\nWorkers arrived at Brunnlitz in the spring of 1944. Oskar was the manager of the plant, while Emilie's job was to organise the meals of the entire staff. \"I always tried,\" she recalled, \"to get more bread than was stipulated and to make sure that the soups were as nutritious as possible.\" She scoured the black market for food, defying SS guards and doing deals with mill owners, knowing that black marketeering was punishable by immediate execution, as was providing succour to Jews.\n\nOn one occasion while Oskar Schindler was away, and a snow storm was raging outside, his wife heard pounding at the door. It was the man in charge of transporting Jewish workers from Goleschau, a Polish mine, and he had 250 Jews crowded into four wagons. A factory had requested Jewish labourers, but then rejected them; now their only chance of survival was if the Schindlers accepted them to work in their factory. Emilie Schindler allowed the Jews in; but when she looked into the carriages, she saw a nightmare beyond imagination.\n\n\"It was impossible to distinguish the men from the women: they were all so emaciated . . . they looked like skeletons. Their eyes were shining like glowing coals in the dark . . . 12 of them had not survived the trip. The position of their bodies seemed to say they had spent the last moments of their lives begging for answers: hands folded and eyes wide open, as if pleading to God.\" She then fed and looked after them, and as their health improved they began to join the work force.\n\nOn the day the armistice was signed, Emilie Schindler recalled how her husband ordered loudspeakers to be installed at the factory and assembled all the workers to listen to Winston Churchill announcing the unconditional surrender of the Germans. Then, his wife at his side, he announced that in view of the situation the factory would close and everyone was free to go where they pleased. He regretted that there was nothing more he could do for them. \"I felt very proud to be there at his side,\" Emilie Schindler recalled.\n\nAfter the closure of the ammunitions factory, the Schindlers fled the advancing Soviet army to Switzerland and from there, in October 1945, travelled to Germany where, with the help of a Jewish organisation called Joint, they were assigned an apartment in Regensburg. In 1947, Joint gave Oskar $15,000 in recognition of what he had done during the war. But, as Emilie later recalled: \"The travails of war did not make Oskar more austere: he spent the money on small pleasures and objects for which he had not the slightest need . . . a large part of it with one of his girlfriends.\"\n\nIn 1949 Joint provided the Schindlers with two passes to travel on the last ship taking Jewish refugees to South America. After arriving in Argentina, with the help of the Jewish community, the Schindlers were offered the job of caretakers on a farm and soon settled at San Vicente, a small town 40 miles from Buenos Aires. Emilie Schindler ran the farm on her own, raising hens while her husband, as she recalled, \"seemed more interested in the adventures the capital could provide\" - chief among them other women.\n\nAfter a meeting with a friend, Oskar Schindler suggested that they start raising coypus for their fur. Emilie tried to dissuade him but \"when Oskar believed that one of his schemes could make money, no one could change his mind\". She then travelled to Buenos Aires to scan bookstores for information about the animals, which up to then, as she later remembered, \"I had seen only on the shoulders of Oskar's lovers\". As soon as the coypus arrived Oskar Schindler said: \"Emilie, behold before you the business of the century. We're going to be millionaires. All women wear fur coats.\" But although his wife worked from dawn to dusk, the business proved rather less profitable than her husband had envisaged.\n\nIn 1957 Oskar Schindler left Argentina never to return, leaving his wife practically destitute. \"So there I was,\" she recalled, \"surrounded by animals with which I could not talk, but which loudly demanded to be fed.\" Oskar Schindler received 100,000 Deutschmarks in compensation for the Brunnlitz factory, but she said she never saw a penny of it.\n\nShe went up to Oskar's gravestone and placed a pebble on his tomb (according to the Jewish tradition) and silently said to him: \"Well, Oskar, at last we meet again, but this is not the time for reproaches and complaints. It would not be fair to you or me. Now you are in another world, in eternity, and I can no longer ask you all those questions to which in life you would have given evasive replies . . . and death is the best evasion of all. I have received no answer, my dear, I do not know why you abandoned me . . . But what not even your death or my old age can change is that we are still married, this is how we are before God. I have forgiven you everything, everything . . . \"\n\nIn later years Emilie Schindler met world leaders and the Pope, but she appreciated more the small gestures such as the occasion when in Los Angeles a fragile, stooped woman approached her \"to thank me in a trembling voice for a chocolate bar that I had given her almost half a century ago\"."
