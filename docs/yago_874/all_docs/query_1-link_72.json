        "text": "Oskar started to work for his father selling farm machinery in 1924. In 1927, they went to sell equipment to a farmer that lived in small village 25 miles from Svitavy, named Staré Maletin. The farmer was Emilie Pelzl’s father. Oskar courted Emilie for a year until she gave in and married him on March 6, 1928. Emilie Schindler described Oskar Schindler as a handsome, mysterious, and elegant man with piercing blue eyes. Once married, they moved in with Schindler’s parents in Svitavy. (Crowe, David)\n\nAfter meeting Emilie, he quit his job with his father and went to work for the Morovian Electric Company in Brno. After marrying, he quit the company to run a driving school in Àumperk, 55 miles northeast of Svitavy, which didn’t last because he left to serve for the Czechoslovak army in the Tenth Infantry Regime of the 31st Army.\n\nWhen he came back from active duty, he returned to the Electric Company, but by 1931, the company went bankrupt, and Schindler was unemployed for a year. At the time the country was in a Depression, and so Hans Schindler, Schindler’s father, had to close his business and was unable to help his son. This situation frustrated Emilie. Her father had given Oskar a dowry of 100,000 Czech crowns ($2,964), but he had squandered it all. (Crowe, David)\n\nBy this time Oskar Schindler had picked up his father’s fondness for drinking. During the year of unemployment, he was arrested twice for public drunkenness, disorderly conduct, and assault. Frustrated with his legal problems, Schindler left to Berlin to find work. Once he returned, he bought a chicken farm, then quickly lost interest and traded the farm work to a position in the Jaroslav Simek Bank of Prague as a representative. He worked at the bank for six years and left it in January of 1938 to start selling government property on installments for a businessman in Brno. Schindler showed a lack of direction, and his conduct had not improved. Once his financial situation was stabilized, he started an affair with an old school friend, Aurelie Schlegel, and fathered two children out of wedlock. Edith was born in 1933 and Oskar Jr in 1935. He neglected his children his entire life and left Aurelie Schlegel to raise them by herself. (Crowe, David)\n\nDuring his affair with Aurelie Schelgel, Oskar’s mother “Fanny” died of an illness. His father, Hans, abandoned his mother just months before she died, sold their family home and moved in to an apartment by himself. Oskar Schindler never forgave his father for the treatment he gave his mother, failing to see the resemblance in conduct between his father and himself. After some time, however, he put aside his opinion of his father and helped him financially until he died in 1945. (Crowe, David)\n\nThe impact of Schindler’s mother death on him was never documented; however, in the same year of her death, Schindler joined Konrad Henlein’s Sudeten (southern) German party and made his first contacts with the German military counterintelligence branch, Abwehr. This would deeply change Oskar Schindler’s life, but it would also reinforce his bond and allegiance to his Southern German roots. (Crowe, David)\n\nBy Sara Neves Pereira"
