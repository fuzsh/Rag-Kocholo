        "text": "Emilie and Oskar Schindler: \"Righteous among the nations\"\n\nThe fact that Oskar Schindler and his wife Emilie lived in Regensburg after the end of the war is not common knowledge. However, thanks to Steven Spielberg’s film \"Schindler’s List\", their name is well known all over the world. The plaque, which you can see on the house wall on Watmarkt 5 where they resided, primarily was mounted here because of the immense popularity of the film. Ever since then, it has been reminding all passers-by that the Schindlers saved more than 1,200 Jews from certain death.\n\nBoth Schindlers were honoured with the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" for this act of humanity - Oskar Schindler in 1962, his wife Emilie in 1994. This honour is the highest one bestowed to a person by the State of Israel; it was granted for the first time in the year 1953. In early 2019, the list of recipients reached a total number of 27, 362 individuals coming from 51 countries - among them were 627 Germans and 110 Austrians.\n\nImmediately after the end of the war, the two Schindlers came to Regensburg, arriving in May 1945. In November 1945 they moved into an apartment here on Watmarkt 5 where they stayed until September 1946. After that they moved to another apartment on a street named Alte Nürnberger Straße 25. From there, they emigrated to Argentina in the winter of 1949."
