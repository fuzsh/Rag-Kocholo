        "text": "Oskar's two children had not been born from his wife Emilie, but from a women by the name of Aurelie Schlegel, after the marriage between Oskar and Emilie in 1928, Oskar had an affair with this women and bore two children out of wedlock. Oskar, believing there was no connection between him and the children did not stay to take care of them, but rather left to return to his wife who later discovered the affair. Oskar Jr had been born on December 21, 1933, and his sister Edith on February 21, 1935. Although never registered as their father due to his not believing he was such, Oskar might have still payed money to Aurelie to help the children. It is presumed that Oskar Jr joined the Hitler Youth Unit at some point within his life due to the age of the recruits at the time, and athough Aurelie had used the Red Cross to search for her son after the war he was never found, the current status of either children still remain a mystery."
