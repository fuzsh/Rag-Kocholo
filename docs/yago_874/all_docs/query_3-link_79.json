        "text": "“ He shot that woman in the steps because she meant nothing to him. She was one of a series neither offending or pleasing him. „ ~ Schindler talking to Helen Hirsch about Göth killing a Jewish woman.\n\nOskar Schinidler is the titular main protagonist of the famous drama movie, Schindler's List, a fictionalization of events that happened during World War II. He is a German businessman who, during World War II and the Holocaust, saved 1,100 Jews by employing them in his factories.\n\nHe was portrayed by Liam Neeson.\n\nHis Good Ranking[]\n\nWhat Makes Him Close to Being Pure Good?[]\n\nThe scene where he kisses the Jewish girl at his birthday can arguably be viewed as sexual assault, but Goeth implies this is quite common with him and his workers and she was likely only scared because he could’ve gotten them both arrested.\n\nHe saves Itzak Stern's life by getting him to run his business.\n\nHe keeps hiring Jews (and only jews) to work for him, and while arguably motivated by money, he is very respectable towards them.\n\nWhen Stern is sent to a detention camp, Oskar makes sure he is found and returned.\n\nHe was extremely horrified by the liquidation.\n\nHe considered trying to save a little girl in red, until she found a place to hide, and was disgusted when found her dead.\n\nHe refused to believe any man was purely evil, claiming that war simply \"brought out what was of worst in men\".\n\nHe confronted a drunk Amon Goeth, trying to convince him not to kill any of his Jew workers/prisoners.\n\nDespite his refusal at hiring Regina Palerman's parents, he later explained to Stern that the act would be illegal and would risk the lives of all the Jews he already saved, not to mention, he later subverts this by ending up hiring the Plaermans anyway.\n\nHe comforted parents of children who were being slaughtered in the gas chambers.\n\nDespite Nazis being around, he complimented two Jewish girls who gave him a birthday cake.\n\nWhen the war ended, he tried to convince Goeth not to send the remaining Jews to Auschwitz.\n\nHe personally buys Helen Hirisch from Goeth, even though that would cost him the last money he had left.\n\nAfter the first train arrives to his camp, he greets and comforts the Jews in it.\n\nAfter one of the trains took a wrong turn to Auschwitz, he ensures that every last Jew is found and sent back to his camp.\n\nHe subverts the fact that he had affairs with other women, saying to his wife he doesn't want an open marriage anymore and that she is the only woman who means anything to him.\n\nHe sabotages his own factory (that supplies the Nazi's ammunition) to disable the shells, saying that \"if his factory produces a shell that can be fired, he’ll be very disappointed\".\n\nAfter the Nazi party is abolished, he gives a heartwarming speech to his workers, and tries to convince the remaining Nazis to return to their families \"not as murderers, but as men\".\n\nBefore leaving his factory to avoid being arrested, he had his workers to frequently receive gifts.\n\nDespite everything he's done, he told to Stern, breaking down in his arms, that he wished he saved more lives, even if not just one.\n\nWhat Prevents Him From Being Pure Good?[]\n\nHe is reckless since he takes some not that well calculated risks, for example, the scene where he kisses a Jewish girl at his birthday, which could've gotten him arrested and his factory shut down, and when he sabotaged his own factory, which led to the Nazis to begin to grow suspicious of him.\n\n[]\n\nOskar Schindler on the Heroes Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
