        "text": "FRANKFURT, Germany Emilie Schindler, who helped her industrialist husband save hundreds of Jews from Nazi death camps in a saga memorialized by the movie Schindler\\'s List, has died, her biographer said Saturday. She was 93.Schindler\\'s widow died Friday night at a hospital in Strausberg outside Berlin where she had been brought for an undisclosed illness on July 21, writer Erika Rosenberg said in a statement.The cause of death was not announced, but news reports when Emilie Schindler was hospitalized said she had suffered a stroke.The Schindlers\\' campaign to save at least 1,200 Jews from the Holocaust went largely unnoticed until Steven Spielberg\\'s Oscar-winning film came out in 1993.Yet Emilie Schindler often complained that Schindler\\'s List overlooked her role in keeping the Jews alive. \"Oskar is the hero &#151; and what about me? I saved many Jews, too,\" Emilie Schindler told German ARD television in a 1999 interview.According to Israel\\'s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, which bestowed her with the \"Righteous among the Nations\" award in 1993, Emilie Schindler prevented the Nazis from sending a trainload of 120 nearly starved Jewish prisoners to Auschwitz.Oskar Schindler convinced the Nazi SS camp commander that the emaciated, frostbitten men were needed to work in his factory. Upon their arrival, Emilie nursed them back to health. None of them ever worked.Schindler, who had lived in Argentina since 1949, came to Germany this year saying she wanted to spend her final days here. A retirement home in Bavaria accepted her, but she fell ill and was hospitalized at the Maerkisch-Oderland clinic.She was born Oct. 22, 1907 in a German-speaking village in today\\'s Czech Republic, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. She married Oskar in 1928 and moved with him to Krakow, Poland, where they ran a factory later used to harbor Jewish laborers during World War II.The Schindlers emigrated to Argentina after the war but Oskar returned to Germany in 1958, leaving Emilie behind. Though they never saw each other again before Oskar\\'s death in 1974, they never officially divorced.For decades, Emilie Schindler lived alone in Argentina &#151; the couple had no children &#151; subsisting on a state pension until the film brought her more attention. She was awarded Argentina\\'s highest honor granted to foreigners, the Order of May, in 1995.In her memoir, \"Where Light and Shadow Meet,\" written with Erika Rosenberg and published by Norton, Emilie Schindler portrayed her husband as a womanizer and as self-serving as he was generous.Her own recollections of scrounging for bread and medicine on the black market and begging for food for the Jewish laborers they kept were detailed in the book, illustrating her claims that her husband hadn\\'t single-handedly saved their lives.After returning to Germany in July, she donated papers and other items that belonged to her husband to a history museum in Bonn.Earlier, she lost a legal battle to obtain a suitcase full of her husband\\'s papers, including a list of the Jews who were saved, that a German couple found in 1999 and gave to the Stuttgarter Zeitung newspaper. The paper published excerpts, then donated the papers to Yad Vashem.Emilie Schindler is survived by a niece in Germany."
