        "text": "Since Steven Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\", the whole world has known the story of Oskar Schindler, the German factory owner who saved over a thousand Jews during the Nazi era. But hardly anyone knows that Oskar Schindler saved the Jews Jews together with his wife Emilie. How can it be that she bravely risked her life for others and at the same time failed to free herself from a toxic relationship with her husband for decades? The film explores this question from different perspectives throughout time and tells the story of how Oskar Schindler becomes a celebrated hero and Emilie Schindler dies impoverished and almost unknown in 2001."
