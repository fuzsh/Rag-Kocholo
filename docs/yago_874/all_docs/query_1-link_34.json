        "text": "Although Oskar Schindler's name is synonymous with Holocaust heroes, his life story is by no means black and white. Readers will be introduced to a man who, with the help of his wife and staff, protected more than 1,000 Jews from the Nazis during the Holocaust. At the same time, this hero was a known womanizer with an alcohol problem. This enlightening book covers his upbringing, including his years in the Nazi Party, and his change of heart. Readers will find this volume to be educational, eye-opening, and inspiring."
