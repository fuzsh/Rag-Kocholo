        "text": "An opportunist businessman with a taste for the finer things in life, Oskar Schindler seemed an unlikely candidate to become a wartime rescuer—and he was, indeed, a long way from perfect—but during World War II, he rescued more than 1,000 Jews from deportation to Auschwitz—Nazi Germany's largest camp complex.\n\nIn many ways, it is the imperfections in Oskar Schindler’s character and the nuances in the historical record that make his story even more remarkable.\n\nOskar Schindler was born on April 28, 1908, in Svitavy (or Zwittau), Moravia, at that time a province of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. An ethnic German and a Catholic, he remained in Svitavy during the interwar period and held Czech citizenship after Moravia was incorporated into the newly established Czechoslovak Republic in 1918.\n\nSchindler grew up in Zwittau, Moravia, and worked in several trades.\n\nHis father was Johann \"Hans\" Schindler, the owner of a farm machinery business, and his mother was Franziska \"Fanny\" Schindler. His sister, Elfriede, was born in 1915.\n\nAfter attending primary and secondary school, Schindler enrolled in a technical school, from which he was expelled in 1924 for forging his report card. He later graduated, but did not take the Abitur exams that would have enabled him to go to college or university. Instead, he took courses in Brno in several trades, including chauffeuring and machinery, and worked for his father for three years.A fan of motorcycles since his youth, Schindler bought a 250-cc Moto Guzzi racing motorcycle and competed recreationally in mountain races for the next few years.\n\nOn March 6, 1928, after attending a series of trade schools in Brno, Schindler married Emilie Pelzl—the daughter of a prosperous Sudeten German farmer.\n\nThe young couple moved in with Oskar's parents and occupied the upstairs rooms, where they lived for the next seven years.\n\nSchindler held a variety of jobs, including working in his father's farm machinery business in Svitavy, opening a driving school in Sumperk, and selling government property in Brno. But soon after his marriage, Schindler quit working for his father and took a series of jobs, including a position at Moravian Electrotechnic and the management of a driving school.\n\nSchindler's father, an alcoholic, abandoned his wife in 1935. She died a few months later after a lengthy illness.\n\nAfter an 18-month stint in the Czech army, where he rose to the rank of lance corporal in the Tenth Infantry Regiment of the 31st Army, Schindler returned to Moravian Electrotechnic, which went bankrupt shortly afterwards. His father's farm machinery business closed around the same time, leaving Schindler unemployed for a year. He took a job with Jaroslav Šimek Bank of Prague in 1931, where he worked until 1938.\n\nSchindler was arrested several times in 1931 and 1932 for public drunkenness. Also around this time he had an affair with Aurelie Schlegel, a school friend. She bore him a daughter, Emily, in 1933, and a son, Oskar Jr, in 1935. Schindler later claimed the boy was not his son.\n\nSchindler joined the separatist Sudeten German Party in 1935.\n\nIn 1936, he joined the Abwehr, the military intelligence service of Nazi Germany.\n\nHe was assigned to Abwehrstelle II Commando VIII, based in Breslau.\n\nPrior to the beginning of German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he collected information on railways and troop movements for the German government.\n\nHe was involved in espionage in the months leading up to Hitler's seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March. Emilie helped him with paperwork, processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the Abwehr office. As Schindler frequently travelled to Poland on business, he and his 25 agents were in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland.\n\nOne assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass, deemed critical for the movement of German troops.\n\nHe was arrested for espionage by the Czechoslovak government telling the Czech police that he did it because he needed the money—by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.\n\nSchindler was released as a political prisoner under the terms of the Munich Agreement that year.\n\nHe joined the Nazi Party in 1939.\n\nSchindler continued to work for the Abwehr, collecting information for the Nazis, until as late as fall 1940, when he was sent to Turkey to investigate corruption among the Abwehr officers assigned to the German embassy there.\n\nAfter some time off to recover in Zwittau, Schindler was promoted to second in command of his Abwehr unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava (Ostrau), on the Czech-Polish border, in January 1939.\n\nEmalia\n\nFollowing the German invasion and occupation of Poland, Schindler moved to Krakow from Svitavy in October 1939.\n\nIn November 1939, he contacted interior decorator Mila Pfefferberg to decorate his new apartment. Her son, Leopold \"Poldek\" Pfefferberg, soon became one of his contacts for black market trading. They eventually became lifelong friends.\n\nAlso that November, Schindler was introduced to Itzhak Stern, an accountant for Schindler's fellow Abwehr agent Josef \"Sepp\" Aue, who had taken over Stern's formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a Treuhänder (trustee).\n\nProperty belonging to Polish Jews, including their possessions, places of business, and homes were seized by the Germans beginning immediately after the invasion, and Jewish citizens were stripped of their civil rights.\n\nSchindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company he was thinking of acquiring, an enamelware factory called Rekord Ltd, owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year.\n\nStern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship under the auspices of the Haupttreuhandstelle Ost (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy or lease the business, as that would give him more freedom from the dictates of the Nazis, including the freedom to hire more Jews.\n\nTaking advantage of the German occupation program to “Aryanize” and “Germanize” Jewish-owned and Polish-owned businesses in the so-called General Government, and\n\nWith the financial backing of several Jewish investors, including one of the owners, Abraham Bankier, Schindler signed an informal lease agreement on the factory on November 13, 1939 and formalised the arrangement on January 15, 1940.\n\nHe renamed it Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik (German Enamelware Factory) or DEF, and it soon became known by the nickname \"Emalia\".\n\nAt first he seemed like every other usurping German industrialist, driven by profit and unmoved by the means of his profiteering. But somewhere along the line, that changed.\n\nHis wife, Emilie, maintained the apartment in Ostrava and visited Oskar in Kraków at least once a week.\n\nHe initially acquired a staff of seven Jewish workers (including Abraham Bankier, who helped him manage the company and 250 non-Jewish Poles.Bankier, a key black market connection, obtained goods for bribes as well as extra materials for use in the factory.\n\nAt its peak, in 1944, the factory employed about 1,750 workers, of whom 1,000 were Jews whom the Germans had relocated from the Krakow ghetto after its liquidation in March 1943 to the forced labor camp and later concentration camp Krakau-Plaszow.\n\nOn August 1, 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank issued a decree requiring all Kraków Jews to leave the city within two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district.\n\nBased on interviews with dozens of Holocaust survivors saved by Oskar Schindler, it is believed that his initial interest was to make money—principally in the money-making potential of the business and hired Jews because they were cheaper than Poles—the wages were set by the occupying Nazi regime. But as time went on, he began shielding his Jewish workers without regard for the cost.\n\nHis connections with the Abwehr, Wehrmacht and its Armaments Inspectorate helped Schindler to obtain contracts to produce enamel cookware for the military—and later helped protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death in the Nazi concentration camps. As time went on, Schindler had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes and gifts of luxury items obtainable only on the black market to keep his workers safe.\n\nIn Fall 1941, the Nazis began transporting Jews out of the ghetto. Most of them were sent to the Bełżec extermination camp and murdered.\n\nAs the brutality of the Holocaust escalated, Schindler's protection of his Jewish workers became increasingly active. In the summer of 1942, he witnessed a German raid on the Jewish ghetto. Watching innocent people being packed onto trains bound for certain death, something awakened in him.\n\n“Beyond this day, no thinking person could fail to see what would happen,” he said later.\n\n“I was now resolved to do everything in my power to defeat the system.”\n\nSchindler's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.\n\nSchindler also helped run Schlomo Wiener Ltd, a wholesale outfit that sold his enamelware, and was leaseholder of Prokosziner Glashütte, a glass factory.\n\nWhile Schindler operated these other factories in Krakow, only at Emalia did he employ Jewish workers who resided in the nearby Krakow ghetto.\n\nAlthough the prisoners deployed at Emalia were still subject to the brutal conditions of the Plaszow concentration camp, Schindler intervened repeatedly on their behalf. He used bribes and personal diplomacy both for the well-being of Jews threatened on an individual basis and to ensure, until late 1944, that the SS did not deport his Jewish workers.\n\nIn order to claim the Jewish workers to be essential to the war effort, he added an armaments manufacturing division to Emalia. During the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto in March 1943, Schindler, aware of the plans because of his Wehrmacht contacts, had his workers stay at the factory overnight to prevent them coming to harm.\n\nSubcamp of Plaszow\n\nInitially Göth's plan was that all the factories, including Schindler's, should be moved inside the camp gates. However, Schindler, with a combination of diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at Schindler's own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, were well fed and housed, and were permitted to undertake religious observances.\n\nAfter the SS re-designated Plaszow as a concentration camp in August 1943, Schindler persuaded the SS to convert Emalia into a subcamp of Plaszow. In addition to the approximately 1,000 Jewish forced laborers registered as factory workers, Schindler permitted 450 Jews working in other nearby factories to live at Emalia as well. This saved them from the systematic brutality and arbitrary murder that was part of daily life in Plaszow.\n\nSchindler did not act here without risk or cost. His protection of his Jewish workers and some of his shady business dealings led SS and police authorities to suspect him of corruption and of giving unauthorized aid to Jews. German SS and police officials arrested him three times, while he owned Emalia, but were unable to charge him.\n\nSchindler was arrested twice on suspicion of black market activities and once for breaking the Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl, an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act. The first arrest, in late 1941, led to him being kept overnight. His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler's influential contacts in the Nazi Party. His second arrest, on 29 April 1942, was the result of his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day. He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts were able to obtain his release.\n\nIn 1943, Schindler was contacted via members of the Jewish resistance movement by Zionist leaders in Budapest. Schindler travelled there several times to report in person on Nazi mistreatment of the Jews. He brought back funding provided by the Jewish Agency for Israel and turned it over to the Jewish underground.\n\nOn March 13, 1943, the ghetto was liquidated and those still fit for work were sent to the new concentration camp at Płaszów.\n\nIn charge of the Płaszów camp was SS-Hauptsturmführer Amon Göth, a sadist who would shoot inmates of the camp at random. Inmates at Płaszów lived in constant fear for their lives. Emilie Schindler called Göth \"the most despicable man I have ever met.\"\n\nIn October 1944, Schindler was arrested again, accused of black marketeering and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers. He was held for most of a week and released.\n\nGöth had been arrested on September 13, 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power, and Schindler's arrest was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth's activities. Göth was never convicted on those charges, but was hanged by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland for war crimes on September 13, 1946.\n\nOn one occasion, the Gestapo came to Schindler demanding that he hand over a family that possessed forged identity papers. \"Three hours after they walked in,\" Schindler said, \"two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded.\"\n\nSchindler's List\n\nDuring the last two years of the war, he had undergone a dramatic moral transformation, and, in many ways, he came more and more to associate himself with his Jews than with other Germans.\n\nIn October 1944, after the SS transferred the Emalia Jews to Plaszow, Schindler sought and obtained authorization to relocate his plant to Brünnlitz in Moravia, and reopen it exclusively as an armaments factory. One of his assistants drew several versions of a list of up to 1,200 Jewish prisoners needed to work in the new factory. These lists came to be known collectively as “Schindler's List.”\n\nThe defining measure of Schindler’s commitment to doing everything possible to save his Jewish workers came in the fall of 1944, when he chose to risk everything to move his armaments factory to Brunnlitz.\n\nSchindler met the specifications required by the SS to classify Brünnlitz as a subcamp of Gross-Rosen concentration camp and thereby facilitated the survival of around 800 Jewish men whom the SS deported on October 15, 1944 from Plaszow via Gross-Rosen to Brünnlitz.\n\nThree hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of being sent to the gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.\n\nIn addition to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery and raw materials to the new factory.\n\nFew if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory's low output, Schindler bought finished goods on the black market and resold them as his own.\n\nThe rations provided by the SS were insufficient to meet the needs of the workers, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków, obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers' health and other basic needs.\n\nSchindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war.\n\nIn January 1945, a trainload of 250 Jews who had been rejected as workers at a mine in Goleschau in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital until the end of the war.\n\nThough classified as an armaments factory, the Brünnlitz plant produced just one wagonload of live ammunition in just under eight months of operation. By presenting bogus production figures, Schindler justified the existence of the subcamp as an armaments factory.\n\nThis facilitated the survival of over 1,000 Jews from being deported to Auschwitz, Nazi Germany's largest camp complex—sparing them the horrors and brutality of conventional camp life.\n\nAs the Red Army drew nearer in July 1944, the SS began closing down the easternmost concentration camps and evacuating the remaining prisoners westward to Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Göth's personal secretary, Mietek Pemper, alerted Schindler to the Nazis' plans to close all factories not directly involved in the war effort, including Schindler's enamelware facility.\n\nPemper suggested to Schindler that production should be switched from cookware to anti-tank grenades in an effort to save the lives of the Jewish workers. Using bribery and his powers of persuasion, Schindler convinced Göth and the officials in Berlin to allow him to move his factory and his workers to Brünnlitz, in the Sudetenland, thus sparing them from certain death in the gas chambers.\n\nUsing names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg, Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1,200 Jews—1,000 of Schindler's workers and 200 inmates from Julius Madritsch's textiles factory—who were sent to Brünnlitz in October 1944.\n\nSchindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On May 7, 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered, and the war in Europe was over.\n\nAs a member of the Nazi Party and the Abwehr intelligence service, Schindler was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal. Bankier, Stern, and several others prepared a statement he could present to the Americans attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives. He was also given a ring, made using gold from dental work taken out of the mouth of Schindlerjude Simon Jeret. The ring was inscribed \"Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.\"\n\nTo escape being captured by the Russians, Schindler and his wife departed Brünnlitz westward in their vehicle, on May 9, 1945, the same day that Soviet troops liberated the camp, in a two-seater Horch, initially with several fleeing German soldiers riding on the running boards.\n\nA truck containing Schindler's mistress Marta, several Jewish workers, and a load of black market trade goods followed behind. The Horch was confiscated by Russian troops at the town of Budweis, which had already been captured by Russian troops. The Schindlers were unable to recover a diamond that Oskar had hidden under the seat. They continued by train and on foot until they reached the American lines at the town of Lenora, and then travelled to Passau, where an American Jewish officer arranged for them to travel to Switzerland by train. They moved to Bavaria in Germany in the fall of 1945.\n\nAfter World War II\n\nAfter World War II, Schindler and his wife Emilie settled in Regensburg, Germany, until 1949, where they were supported by assistance payments from Jewish relief organisations.\n\nAfter receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses, he moved with his wife Emilie to Argentina, where they took up farming.\n\nWhen he went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife, permanently separated but not divorced, and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden (\"Schindler Jews\")—the people whose lives he had saved during the war.\n\nSchindler died, penniless and almost unknown, on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim, Germany. Many of those whose survival he facilitated—and their descendants—lobbied for and financed the transfer of his body for burial in Israel.\n\nHe was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993.\n\nIn 1993, Yad Vashem awarded Oskar and Emilie Schindler the title \"Righteous Among the Nations\" in recognition of their efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust at great personal risk.\n\nAlso in 1993, the United States Holocaust Memorial Council posthumously presented the Museum's Medal of Remembrance to Schindler. Rarely presented, this medal honors deserving recipients for extraordinary deeds during the Holocaust and in the cause of Remembrance. Emilie Schindler accepted the medal on behalf of her ex-husband at a ceremony in the Museum's Hall of Remembrance.\n\nSchindler's story garnered more attention thanks to Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Schindler's List, based on the 1982 novel, Schindler's Ark, by Thomas Keneally that recounted Schindler's life and works.\n\nAnd yet, Spielberg’s movie, while admirable in many ways, took creative license on a full variety of issues. For instance, Oskar Schindler didn’t break down in tears because he thought he could have saved more people, and it is unlikely he experienced a defining moment, such as seeing a girl in a red coat, that led to his decision to save the lives of his Jewish workers.\n\nAnother important correction to the historical record: Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley, was actually a composite of a number of people, including Mietek Pemper, who played a crucial role in putting Oskar Schindler in the position to save many people. Pemper had the unfortunate task of being forced to work as the assistant to Amon Goth, the sadistic commandant of the Krakow-Płaszow concentration camp. In that position, Pemper passed along valuable information to Oskar. As the German war effort neared collapse, Pemper told Schindler he needed to expand into armaments because only factories deemed vital to the war effort would be viewed worth saving, along with, it was hoped, the workers in those factories.\n\nMoreover, evidence suggests that Schindler had already chosen his path sometime before this tragedy and that the organized exterminations simply made him more determined to help as many Jews as he could.\n\nWriter Herbert Steinhouse, who interviewed him in 1948, wrote that,\n\n\"Schindler's exceptional deeds stemmed from just that elementary sense of decency and humanity that our sophisticated age seldom sincerely believes in. A repentant opportunist saw the light and rebelled against the sadism and vile criminality all around him.\"\n\nDr. Moshe Bejski, who was saved by Oskar Schindler during the Holocaust. “Oskar could easily have closed his Krakow operations and retreated westward with the profits he had already made. Instead, he chose to risk his life and his money to save as many Jews as he could.”\n\nIn a 1983 television documentary, Schindler was quoted as saying,\n\n\"I felt that the Jews were being destroyed. I had to help them; there was no choice.\"\n\nToday, there are more than 15,000 descendants of the Schindler-Jews (Jews who were saved by Oskar Schindler) living in the US and Europe, and many other in Israel.\n\nBefore World War II, the Jewish population of Poland was 3.5 million. Today there are between 10,000 and 15,000 left."
