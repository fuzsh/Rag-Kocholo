You know him the hit sketch show In Living Color, The Proud Family, and so many more countless shows, movies, and his many impersonations and comedic characters. However, he recently opened up a little more about his childhood.\n\nIn 2020, he released his book —Living In Color -What’s Funny About Me. It was the first time he spoke about being abandoned by his mother at the age of 18 months in the 1960s in Mississippi, in a pile of trash.\n\nMORE BAYOU CITY BUZZ\n\nThe secret that he had been keeping to himself surrounding his early years was that the woman who found him and adopted him, was white.\n\nHe managed to turn that trauma into triumph with the love of comedy.\n\nMORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\nTommy Davidson will be performing live Thursday, March 24 at the Komedy Lounge on FM 1960."
