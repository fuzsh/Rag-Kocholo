Cindy has been extremely intuitive since very early childhood. At the age of 10 she had her first memorable experience with a spirit. Days after losing a childhood friend in a fatal car accident, Cindy woke up in the middle of the night to see her friend standing next to her bed. At the time, she dismissed this experience and convinced herself it was just a dream. It wasn’t until her early 20’s that she realized she was having psychic and mediumistic experiences all along. During this “awakening” she began searching for answers and reasons for her experiences and became aware of her multi-faceted abilities as a psychic medium. She began training not only in the United States but also at the Arthur Findlay School of Intuitive Sciences in Stansted, England. She believes in compassionately sharing her gift with others while also opening up others to the gifts they too possess and that everyone is inherently intuitive and able to feel Spirit.\n\nTickets: $30-$35\n\nVIP Seats are the 100 seats closest to the stage.\n\nGeneral Admission are the seats from the VIP seats to the back of the room.\n\nAll shows are 18+\n\nSeats are only guaranteed until showtime.\n\nSeats are assigned on a first come first serve basis as people arrive.\n\nGroups must arrive together in order to sit together.\n\nFor the best chance of being seated together arrive early and arrive all together.\n\nThere are no refunds on any ticket purchases.\n\nDoors/Show Times\n\n6:00 PM Doors/7:00 PM Show"
