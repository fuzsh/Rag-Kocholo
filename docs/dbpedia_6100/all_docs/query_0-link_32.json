        "meta_description": "Davidson’s hilarious impressions of Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson and other icons have become infamous. His visibility on In Living Color led to three Showtime specials: On Strength of New York, Illin’ in Philly and Takin’ it to DC. Tommy hosted and starred in Showtime’s hugely popular Chocolate Sundaes special which garnered rave reviews and incredible sales. He just guest starred on season 2 of Showtime’s critically lauded hit series, Jim Carrey’s “I’m Dying Up Here.” His elasticity as a performer is seen on the small screen with standout guests stints ranging from BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood opposite Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon to his hosting the hit series, Vacation Creation (ABC) for three seasons. As a voice artist, America fell in love with Tommy as the star of Will Smith’s animated series, Youngin’s, Disney’s animated series, The Proud Family and alongside Michael Jai White in the critically-lauded spoof comedy, Black Dynamite (Adult Swim) as the character ‘Cream Corn.’ Tommy’s long awaited autobiography, Living In Color: What’s Funny About Me (Kensington Books) is due January 28, 2020 with a myriad of key events planned around its anticipated release.. Tommy’s stand up dates always sell out. He currently headlines “Off Color Comedy Tour” with Keenan Ivory Wayans, Shawn Wayans and David Alan Grier prompting all to ask,” Is ILC coming back?",
