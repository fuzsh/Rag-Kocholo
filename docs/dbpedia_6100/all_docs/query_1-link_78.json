        "text": "BY CLYDE HUGHES | AC JosepH Media\n\nATLANTIC CITY — Tommy Davidson has seen it all in more than three decades of comedy.\n\nFrom co-starring in the legendary Fox sketch comedy show “In Living Color” to voicing Proud family patriarch Oscar Proud in the Emmy Award-winning animated series “The Proud Family,” Davidson has been on the cutting edge of comedy for years.\n\nIn an interview with Front Runner New Jersey.com ahead of his headlining show Sunday (Feb. 4) at the Resorts Hotel and Casino, Davidson said he simply has had the best job in the world.\n\nTommy Davidson at Resorts Casino Hotel, 6:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. shows on Feb. 4.\n\nFor more information: https://resortsac.com/entertainment/atlantic-city-comedy-show/\n\n“I feel lucky and fortunate,” Davidson told FRNJ. “It’s a job, and a very good job to have. I realized how fortunate I am and have a lot of respect for the working men and women in our country. My job description is that I ‘dispense happy.’ How can you get any better than that?”\n\nDavidson said his comedy has never been about offending people, but is instead about pointing out differences in a positive way with hilarious anecdotes, which helped him circumvent many of the challenges comedians face today by people rejecting laughs that hurt others.\n\n“I was never one of those comics that offends,” Davidson said. “Certain groups who have been made fun of have gotten tired of the ‘oohs’ and the ‘aahs,’ and we’re going to get together and shut this down.”\n\nDavidson broke into comedy nationally with some of the biggest names in the genre, including Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, Robert Townsend and Keenan Ivory Wayans. It was a time when Black comedians were starting to get some of their best breaks in the industry.\n\nDavidson landed spots on shows starring Townsend and Wayans’s In Living Color. In Living Color produced an all-star cast of performers from Jim Carrey and Jamie Foxx to Wayans’ brother Damon Wayans.\n\n“Came in at a really good time,” Davidson said. “For me, it was about opportunities. Arsenio had his own show. Keenan had his own show. Robert had his own show. Those shows gave me a chance to make my own breaks. It was all about being in the right place and right time. That period was definitely the right place at the right time.”\n\nIn Atlantic City, Davidson said there will be plenty of local fanfare to get into his act along with what he sees going on nationally. In short, he believes his show will have something for everyone.\n\n“With Atlantic City, there’s so many directions you can go,” Davidson said with a big laugh. “It’s like a grab bag, a piñata.”\n\nDavidson said his latest venue now is music, where he has broken into the genre of smooth jazz. With one album in the books and another prepping for release, he encourages everyone to go to his website at www.tommydavidson.com or Apple Records to check out the newest sounds.\n\nFollow Us Today On:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nNote from AC JosepH Media: If you like this story and others posted on Front Runner New Jersey.com, lend us a hand so we can keep producing articles like these for New Jersey and the world to see.
