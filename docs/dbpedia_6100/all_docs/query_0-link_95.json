Tommy has starred in four successful Showtime specials to date (On the Strength in New York City, Illin' in Philly, Takin’ it to DC, and The Chocolate Sundaes Comedy Show). Most recently, Tommy has been working on the just-renewed second season of his hit series, Black Dynamite, Adult Swim's #1 top-rated show. Next up on the feature film front is the extraordinary story of the international celebrity Sammy Davis Jr. whose outsize talent couldn’t save him from himself in, Deconstructing Sammy, which Tommy bought the rights to last year and is in development on.\n\nKnown for the indelible characters he created on the iconic variety show and spot-on impersonations from iconic figures like Sammy Davis Jr. and President Obama, Tommy is truly the ultimate all-around performer. Selling out every venue in which he performs, Tommy Davidson promises an unforgettable in-studio of incisive wit, hilarious panel, memorable takeaways and big laughs."
