        "text": "Wiry, hyperkinetic African-American comic actor. Davidson is most recognized for his performances on Fox's \"In Living Color.\" Davidson made his first TV appearance on the HBO comedy special \"Robert Townsend & His Partners in Crime III.\" The next year he was cast as an ensemble member of \"In Living Color\" where his ability for impersonations and characterizations was fully exploited. Davidson made the jump from TV to features playing the part of the comic foil in \"Strictly Business\" (1991), although that film did not succeed at the box office. In 1997, he played the more stalwart of the two guys on the make in \"Booty Call,\" a surprise comedy hit, co-starring opposite Jamie Foxx as young men searching for condoms in order to enjoy an evening of love with their dates."
