        "text": "PHILIPSBURG–American actor and comedian Tommy Davidson, who is best known for his role in the comedy show “In Living Colour,” will be headlining this year’s 15th edition of the Laugh Till Belly Burst comedy show, which is set for June 7 and 8.\n\nThe More Fun More Laughter Foundation said over the weekend this year’s show will be amazing with a great line-up of comedians from around the region sharing the stage with Davidson. The foundation said negotiations have been ongoing with Davidson for more than a year now and after receiving only great reviews from previous American and Canadian comedians, who were part of the St. Maarten comedy fest, he decided to headline the upcoming two-night LTBB festival.\n\nDavidson started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1986, when a childhood friend convinced him to perform stand-up at The Penthouse strip club in Park View, Washington, D.C. He continued performing in various comedy clubs throughout the Washington Metropolitan region, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. He opened concerts for Patti LaBelle, Starpoint, and Kenny G. He performed on a fundraising telethon for WHMM in 1987.\n\nDavidson won an amateur stand-up competition at Apollo Theatre in 1987. Soon afterwards, he moved to North Hollywood, California, where he met Martin Lawrence, who lived in his building. He performed at Comedy Store, where Robert Townsend heard of him and asked him to be the warm-up comic for an HBO special. After performing at Luther Vandrossand Anita Baker shows, he appeared on Arsenio Hall Show.\n\nDavidson’s first major exposure came on the variety show In Living Colour, where he played various characters, including his impersonations of Sammy Davis, Jr., Michael Jackson, Sugar Ray Leonard, and child victim of Homey D. Clown. In 1991, he released Ill in in Philly, a VHS tape of a stand-up performance, which was aired regularly on Comedy Central in the 1990s, and “On The Strength”, another stand-up performance, this time filmed in New York City.\n\nHe has also appeared in the films Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Strictly Business, Booty Call and Juwanna Mann. Davidson provided the voice for Oscar Proud, the father in the Disney animated series The Proud Family. In an episode of Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham, Davidson hosted the show with amateur acts trying to make names for themselves. He was also a guest on an episode of Cartoon Network’s animated/live action talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast. Davidson did commercials for Pizza Hut in 2002, talking about the “P’zone Revolution”. He even starred on the short-lived TV series Between Brothers with Kadeem Hardison, Kelly Perine and Dondre Whitfield in 1997.\n\nMore recently, Davidson played the role of Cream Corn in Black Dynamite. He also reprised his role in the Adult Swim television show of the same name. He appeared in an episode of the TV show Martin, playing the role of fictional talk-show host Varnell Hill (a parody of Arsenio Hall).\n\nIn 2015, Tommy and his fiancée, Amanda, appeared in Season 4/Episode 11 of Celebrity Wife Swap. His fiancée swapped with Corey Feldman’s girlfriend, Courtney. In 2016, Tommy appeared on Celebrity Family Feud."
