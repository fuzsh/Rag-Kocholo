        "text": "Tommy Davidson’s exceptional range – from stand-up comedy and acting to versatile music accomplishments – have earned him a reputation as an extraordinary performer. Best known as one of the stars of the hit television show In Living Color, his visibility has allowed him to become a household name known for his innovative talent.\n\nDavidson started his career as a standup comedian in Washington DC, earning an ardent following with relentless work in the leading comedy clubs. As one of the cutting-edge, young stand-ups, he was spotted by major concert promoters who booked him as the opening act for A-list tours including Patti LaBelle, Kenny G and Luther Vandross. It wasn’t long before he came to Hollywood and was headlining at a number of clubs, including the Comedy Act Theatre, where he met Robert Townsend. This led to his first national television appearance with a starring role in Partners in Crime and was the conduit to Keenan Ivory Wayans, who proved instrumental in Davidson’s career by offering him an opportunity to audition.\n\nTommy and Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier — the uniquely talented cast of the most adventurous primetime variety show on television, In Living Color (1990), made TV history. The iconic sketch show was recently honored with the ‘Groundbreaking Award” by TV Land in a star-studded salute guided by Whoopi Goldberg and this year celebrates its 25th anniversary.\n\nTommy’s film debut started opposite Halle Berry in Strictly Business. A range of feature film roles from Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, where he received acclaim and praise for his turn as “Womack/Sleep ‘N Eats,” to Juwanna Mann (Morgan Creek Productions’) and the pivotal cameo in Jim Carrey’s Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, followed. He starred in 2011’s landmark, award-winning documentary, I Am Comic, opposite Tim Allen, Lewis Black, Sarah Silverman, Carlos Mencia, Jeff Foxworthy and Kathy Griffin\n\nDavidson’s hilarious impressions of Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson and other icons have become infamous. His visibility on In Living Color led to three Showtime specials: On Strength of New York, Illin’ in Philly and Takin’ it to DC. Tommy is the host and star of Showtime’s 2013 Chocolate Sundaes special (eOne) which garnered rave reviews upon premiere and remains one of eOne Film’s best sellers.\n\nHe has just been cast in a starring role in Frat Pack, an unapologetic comedy shooting in Toronto in April due late 2015 release. The indie feature centers on a shy late 20s British bachelor who is dragged on a wild road trip to a fraternity party as his mother marries into a larger than life American family. Think “Road Trip” meets “Bridesmaids” meets “Project X” with a bit of “American Pie” thrown in.\n\nHis elasticity as a performer who delivers on the small screen ranges from his guest starring role in season 4 of the hot BET show, Real Husbands of Hollywood, opposite Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon and as the star of Will Smith’s animated series, Youngin’s and Disney’s animated series, The Proud Family\n\nTommy stars opposite Michael Jai White in the critically-lauded spoof comedy, Black Dynamite (Sony Pictures) as the character ‘Cream Corn.’ The cult hit was adapted as an animated series for the Cartoon Network, becoming a breakout hit. It continues to garner the highest ratings the Turner imprint has ever experienced setting the precedent for all Adult Swim series.\n\nCLICK HERE TO BOOK TOMMY DAVIDSON\n\nWhat is Summit Comedy, Inc.?\n\nSummit Comedy was formed many moons ago in 1998 by Chuck Johnson, current owner/President. Chuck Johnson entered the comedy business the day after graduating from Appalachian State University in 1995 where he booked all of the live music and comedy for the university’s club “Legends”.
