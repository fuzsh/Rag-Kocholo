        "text": "Welcome to the Good Time Tommy team!\n\nI just wanted to take a moment and personally welcome you to our team and thank you for the opportunity to represent you in your real estate journey. We view all of our clients as a valued relationship rather than a real estate transaction. With this in mind, we strive to bring you excellence in all we do! This applies to buying a home, selling a home, the contract process, and extends long after the transaction has closed.\n\nIn response to the more challenging market we have experienced over the years, we have become more determined and assertive with our marketing and technology. Always staying abreast of the newest developments, market trends, and educational opportunities. This has allowed us to be very successful in securing results for our clients.\n\nTommy Davidson (#GTT)"
