        "text": "Tommy Davidson makes a trip back to the Land of Enchantment for a one-night-only headlining engagement at Albuquerque's REVEL Entertainment Hub on the Uptown Funk stage on Wednesday, June 8th, 2022. Davidson has proven himself as a talented comedian over the years. One of the original members of the iconic comedy show, In Living Color, Davidson made a name for himself through hilarious characters and outstanding impressions, including Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson, and MC Hammer.\n\nHe lent his voice as a series regular, Cream Corn, on the Adult Swim action-comedy spoof Black Dynamite. After becoming the beloved character, Oscar Proud on The Proud Family, he returned with a new version of the hit series, The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder (Disney +), to rave reviews on a new ardent following.He has also made guest appearances in everything from MTV's Wild N Out to BET's Real Husbands of Hollywood and ABC's Celebrity Wife Swap. He also recently headlined The Off Color Comedy Tour with Keenan Ivory Wayans, Shawn Wayans, and David Alan Grier and toured with Mike Epps and Martin Lawrence, having launched his career as a stand-up comic in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhile he has been continuing his comedy legacy, he has also focused on the side of music, finishing his latest hit song, \"Sweet Reunion,\" with multi-Grammy winner Dave Koz. In a recent interview, Davidson shared his love for the original by Kenny Loggins and how he wanted to do it justice. \"It's a beautifully written song by one of my favorite artists, Kenny Loggins. I made a vow to do justice to that song one day by remaking it in my style because it gave me years of pure listening pleasure. Coming out the past couple of years with all the negativity, it is time for a positive song on the airwaves. Something to make everyone feel good about themselves and the world around them. It's the right song at the right time - mankind's SWEET REUNION that is long overdue.\""
