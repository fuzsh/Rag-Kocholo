        "text": "Black Dynamite\n\nTheatrical Movie Poster\n\nCountry United States Directed by Scott Sanders Release Date 2009 Language English Distributor Apparition\n\nMain Cast Character Actor Black Dynamite\n\nMichael Jai White Bullhorn Byron Minns Gloria Grey Salli Richardson\n\nBlack Dynamite is a 2009 spoof/homage/pastiche of the blaxploitation films of the 1970's directed by Scott Sanders and written by Sanders, lead actor Michael Jai White, and co-star Byron Minns. The film stars Michael Jai White and Salli Richardson, and co-stars Mykelti Williamson, Tommy Davidson and Phil Morris, with appearances by notable names like Arsenio Hall, Tucker Smallwood, Bokeem Woodbine and John Salley. The film was very low budget, for both practical reasons and as part of a tribute to classic blaxploitation movies which were also very low budget. While other \"retro\" productions might have reproduced the look of a 1970's film digitally, the producers of Black Dynamite chose to use 16mm film and sound equipment from the era instead. The movie is filled with stock footage from the era, and many errors are either left in (a henchmen forgetting to put a car into park before getting out) or deliberately written into the script (an actor reading out stage instructions.) The film had a very limited release in 2009, followed by a release on both DVD and Blu-Ray. It was followed by the graphic novel Black Dynamite: Slave Island and an animated series on Adult Swim. Plans for a sequel are in motion.\n\nWhat most people miss is the fact that many of the actors aren't just playing the characters in the movie, they're playing actors who are playing characters in the movie. For example, Michael Jai White stars as \"All-Star running back Ferrante Jones\" who plays Black Dynamite, which is a tribute to popular blaxploitation star such as Jim Brown and Fred \"the Hammer\" Williamson, who started their careers on the grid-iron.\n\nThe following firearms were seen in the film Black Dynamite:\n\nHandguns\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 629 Classic\n\nBlack Dynamite (Michael Jai White) uses a Smith & Wesson Model 629 Classic as his primary weapon. The 629 is chambered in .44 Magnum, is the stainless steel version of the S&W Model 29, and was introduced in 1978. The 629 Classic has a full-length underlug, which differentiates it from the standard 629. Black Dynamite fires it one handed regularly, showing pretty much no recoil or flinching, which is fitting to his badass persona. (The real reason for this is the fact that almost all the muzzle flashes were added in post production.) Black Dynamite also has the amazing ability to fire ten to twenty shots from the revolver without reloading as is fitting to the spoof nature of the film\n\nDan Wesson Large Frame .44 Magnum\n\nBlack Dynamite also uses a stainless Dan Wesson Large Frame revolver, again in .44 Magnum.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 10\n\nA snub-nosed Smith & Wesson Model 10 is O'Leary's (Kevin Chapman) weapon of choice. Saheed (Phil Morris) holds a henchman hostage with one. Bullhorn (Byron Minns) later uses one to put one of his own out of his misery.\n\nColt MK IV Series 70\n\nOne of Chicago Wind's (Mykelti Williamson) thugs holds a Colt MK IV Series 70 on Black Dynamite in the Hip Pocket, before it is \"kicked\" out of his hand by Bullhorn. Also seen in the hands of one of O'Leary's partners while infiltrating Black Dynamite's home. Black Dynamite likely uses the same prop later on in the montage.\n\nSmith & Wesson Model 38 Nickel plated\n\nFirst Lady Pat Nixon (Nicole Sullivan) uses a Smith & Wesson Model 38 to stop Black Dynamite from destroying the presidential china.\n\nPhiladelphia Derringer\n\nRichard Nixon (James McManus) tries to use the Philadelphia Derringer used by John Wilkes Booth to kill President Lincoln (which is not only in the White House, but also loaded) on Black Dynamite after their nunchuck fight. He is foiled by the ghost of Abraham Lincoln. (Yes, that's what actually happened in the movie.)\n\nDan Wesson Model 15\n\nOne of Rafelli's thugs (Irwin Keyes) shoots Jimmy with a Dan Wesson Model 15.\n\nSubmachine Guns\n\nM1928 Submachine Gun\n\nWhile Don Rafelli (Mike Starr) is on the phone, a henchman with a Thompson M1928 submachine gun can be seen in the background. Another henchmen at the warehouse is armed with one.\n\nMadsen M50\n\nMost of Rafelli's thugs use Madsen M50s as their primary automatic weapon. \"Donut Man\" (Lee Whittaker) is seen with a Madsen M50 after Black Dynamite shoots him. (IMDb refers to the character as such.)\n\nM3 Grease Gun\n\nCream Corn (Tommy Davidson) uses an M3 Grease Gun.\n\nSmith & Wesson M76\n\nRafelli's goons use Smith & Wesson M76s. Black Dynamite also uses one later assaulting the warehouse.\n\nShotguns\n\nMossberg 500\n\nMilitant #2 (Darrel Heath) uses a Mossberg 500.\n\nRifles/Carbines\n\nM16/SP1\n\nA militant is seen training himself to load the M16/SP1 quickly in the Panthers' compound.\n\nColt AR-15A2 Sporter Match HBAR\n\nBlack Dynamite is armed with a Colt AR-15A2 Sporter Match HBAR fitted with a Cobray 37mm Launcher and a Colt scope on Kung Fu Island.\n\nM14\n\nSaheed (Phil Morris) carries an M14 with a scope. It is probably the same M14 from the militant's headquarters.\n\nM1 Carbine (including Iver Johnson Enforcer)\n\nOne of Black Dynamite's guys uses an M1 Carbine. Bullhorn (Byron Minns) also uses an Iver Johnson Enforcer.\n\nHeavy Weapons\n\nM60 machine gun\n\nAn M60 machine gun is seen in Black Dynamite's (stock footage-filled) flashback to his days in the Vietnam War.\n\nM72 LAW\n\nThe Secret Service uses an M72 LAW to shoot down Black Dynamite's helicopter and to destroy his parachute. As with most of the other muzzle flashes in the movie, the rocket and smoke appear to be effects added in post-production.\n\nCobray CM79LF 37mm Launcher\n\nMilitant #2 uses a Cobray CM79LF 37mm Launcher during the assault on Kung Fu Island.\n\nCobray 37mm Launcher\n\nBlack Dynamite's AR-15 has an underbarrel Cobray 37mm Launcher attached.\n\nMk 2 hand grenade\n\nBlack Dynamite throws a Mk 2 hand grenade during the assault on Kung Fu Island.\n\nBlindicide RL-83\n\nMilitant #2 uses Blindicide RL-83 rocket launcher during the assault on Kung Fu Island.\n\nTrivia\n\nCartridge Case\n\nBlack Dynamite is given a cartridge case that was supposedly found at the scene of his brother Jimmy's murder. According to Saheed, it's from an \"AR-48\" and whoever had it must \"work for the Man.\" But according to the book he's looking in, it's just a 45-90-300 WCF. (And none of the men who shoot Jimmy had anything that could fire such a round.)"
