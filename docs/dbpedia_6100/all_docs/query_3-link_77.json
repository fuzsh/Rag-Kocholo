        "text": "Long before Chance the Rapper spoofed Lil Pump on Saturday Night Live or Dave Chappelle had half of America imitating Lil Jon, In Living Color blazed the trail for hip-hop parody.\n\nThe Fox sketch comedy show, created by actor/comedian Keenan Ivory Wayans, debuted in 1990, becoming one of television's most influential, revolutionary and successful sketch comedy shows. It launched the careers of some of entertainment's biggest names—Damon Wayans, Jamie Foxx, David Alan Grier, Tommy Davidson—comics who spoke the language of hip-hop and incorporated the culture in their comedy. The show's in-house DJ (a pre-stardom Shawn Wayans), harem of background dancers (dubbed the Fly Girls) and live performances from rap's hottest acts all added to the allure that drew in the hip-hop generation through the first half of the 1990s. Heavy D even wrote and recorded the show's theme song!\n\nAt the time, hip-hop was still a growing culture, far from being accepted by mainstream audiences. But In Living Color helped to crystalize the music and aesthetic. Nowhere else could you find Jim Carrey performing a knee-slapping remix of Vanilla Ice's \"Ice Ice Baby\" (elsewhere, the funnyman satirized White reggae artist Snow's No. 1 record, \"Informer\") or Jamie Foxx poking fun at Sir Mix-A-Lot's classic song \"Baby Got Back.\" In Living Color brought hip-hop to nighttime TV in the most vibrant and hysterical way possible.\n\nAlthough more than 25 years removed from its debut, In Living Color remains a staple of pop culture, evidenced by crooner and showman Bruno Mars' In Living Color-inspired visual to his Cardi B-assisted \"Finesse (Remix),\" which gave viewers a blast from the past, conjuring up memories of the iconic sketch show and its historical importance.\n\nIn light of the new video's nostalgia, XXL took a deep dive into In Living Color's archives to compile the most memorable hip-hop-moments from the show's five-season run."
