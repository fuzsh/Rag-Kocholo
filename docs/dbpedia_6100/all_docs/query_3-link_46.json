        "text": "When the FCS playoffs roll around this year, they’re going to have a different look to them... sort of. While it will still be a 24-team bracket like we’re used to seeing, beginning this year the subdivision will be seeding its Top 16 teams instead of just eight. The eight best will still receive a bye but the other eight will be at home in the opening round and the decision on who hosts won’t be left up to a blind bid anymore. As we look (perhaps too far) ahead to what the field may look like in 2024, we’ve taken that into account.\n\nWithout a snap of ball being played yet, here’s our best guess at how things will shake out by the end of November.\n\nPredicted Top Eight Seeds\n\n1. North Dakota State\n\nIf there’s any team that is going to be coming into 2024 with a taste for blood, it’s the Bison and a vengeful NDSU team is bad news for the rest of the country. North Dakota State watched their chance at another trip the big one slip away in double overtime last winter in the semifinals while their rivals hoisted the trophy for a second straight year. Matt Entz is out the door to USC and Tim Polasek is the man in charge now. He knows the Bison machine as good as anyone, having served as an assistant intermittently from 2006 to 2016. Polasek will still have Cam Miller throwing passes and Cole Wisniewski intercepting them on the other side. NDSU brings back a lot of talent besides these two and shapes up to be the scariest group out there.\n\n2. South Dakota State\n\nThe defending champs are again going to be one of the toughest squads to knock off this fall and they, too, return a lot of household names. Walter Payton Award winning QB Mark Gronowski is gunning for a third ring this year as are guys like Tucker Large, Adam Bock and Amar Johnson among several others. SDSU might not quite be the same completely unstoppable force they have been in recent years but to count out the Jackrabbits is a fool’s errand. Jimmy Rogers’ team boasted a historically-great defense last fall and has won 29 straight. Even though they might not take the top spot this year, Brookings will still be in line to host several playoff games.\n\n3. Montana\n\nThe Griz got a long-awaited taste of the big stage last year and now they’re hoping to run it back. Montana only lost two games in 2023 and one was the national championship. Coach Bobby Hauck will again be behind the headset but his team is going to look a little different. Former quarterback Clifton McDowell left in the portal and big defensive tackle Alex Gubner is trying his hand out in the NFL. The defending Big Sky champs, despite the changes, should still be a formidable bunch this year. Wide receiver Junior Bergen is as dangerous as any in the return game while Trevin Gradney and Riley Wilson will bolster another strong defense. A QB battle has yet to determine the starter but regardless Montana is not going anywhere.\n\n4. Montana State\n\nThere might not be a hungrier team out there than Montana State. 2023 felt like a year of missed opportunities for a squad that was slated to be one of the best. MSU got drubbed in their rivalry game, came inches away from beating South Dakota State and saw their season end in cruel overtime fashion to NDSU early in the playoffs. The Bobcats, after a long offseason of what-ifs, have the motive and the talent to make a deep run this year. Tommy Mellott, Brody Grebe and Marcus Wher lead a senior class that make MSU a threat in the Big Sky once more. Head coach Brent Vigen is in Year Four now and he’ll have the ‘Cats near the top of the heap again.\n\n5. Villanova\n\nThe biggest FCS sleeper this year might reside in Philly. It’s easy to forget that this Villanova team was the one that gave SDSU its greatest challenge in last year’s playoffs. Isas Waxter and Shane Hartzel are still running the defense while quarterback Connor Watkins, this year’s preseason pick for CAA Offensive Player of the Year, will be slinging it around once more on the other side. ‘Nova is set up nicely for another deep run this season and is pegged by many to be the top dog out East. 2024 may be the best shot the Wildcats have had in a long time to make a legitimate push toward Frisco.\n\n6. Chattanooga\n\nIf ever there was a window for Chattanooga to take the torch in the SoCon, this is that window. The Mocs don’t lose hardly anyone from their 2023 playoff squad while the likes of Furman, Western Carolina and Mercer do. Quarterback Chase Artopoeus is still around after a season that saw him throw for 2,672 yards and 20 touchdowns. Receiver Javin Whatley also returns as does linebacker Alex Mitchell. Rusty Wright’s team feels like they’re on the verge of really breaking out this fall and there’s no telling quite what the ceiling is if they can stay healthy.\n\n7. South Dakota\n\nFollowing up one of the best seasons in school history is going to be no easy task in Vermillion but USD has the pieces still around to put on another really good run. Aidan Bouman returns under center as do several of his favorite targets like Carter Bell and J.J. Galbreath. The defense, although it lost some NFL-caliber talent, will still be solid as well. South Dakota’s place in the Missouri Valley will be determined greatly by its matchups against both in-state rival SDSU and NDSU (whom it beat last year). The ‘Yotes have the makings of a Top 8 seed again.\n\n8. Central Arkansas\n\nThe Bears seem as though they’re ready to not only challenge in the United Athletic Conference but in the FCS as a whole. Standout linebacker David Walker is poised for another fantastic season as is running back ShunDerrick Powell. If these two can play to their expectations then UCA will be a playoff team and probably get a bye week to boot. With Austin Peay seemingly stepping back, the conference is ripe for the picking and is the Bears’ to lose.\n\nPredicted First Round Matchups (New 9-16 Seed Format)\n\nDrake at 9. Idaho (Winner to Central Arkansas)\n\nThe Vandals lost a lot after last season but if anyone can keep them on the straight and narrow, it’s Jason Eck. Until we see what they have with Jack Layne at QB, they’re just on the outside of that Top 8 seed conversation. No Hayden Hatten and no Anthony Woods will hurt but Idaho is still a very talented group and surely will be in the postseason. They’ll host Drake who will be the Pioneer League champ for the second straight year. The Bulldogs return quarterback Luke Bailey and D lineman Finn Claypool making them likely the most talented team in their league.\n\nDuquesne at 10. Sacramento State (Winner to South Dakota)\n\nDuquesne will make its second straight playoff appearance this year as the NEC’s champion once more. The Dukes will ride the arm of Darius Perrantes as far as it will take them and hope some big transfers like T.J. Jones will help push them over the top. Their first round dance partner will be Sacramento State. The Hornets will again get in with guys like Elijah Tau-Tolliver and Kaiden Bennett leading the charge on offense. Sac State’s defense will be its main concern but it will still be good enough to have them in the upper half of the Big Sky.\n\nLafayette at 11. Furman (Winner to Chattanooga)\n\nThey might not repeat as SoCon champs but Furman is still talented enough to get in and they should barring a catastrophic slip. The Paladins brought in former USC quarterback Isaac Ward to take over for Tyler Huff and lead the offense, an offense that still has its top receiver in Colton Hinton. They’ll welcome in last year’s Patriot League champions Lafayette. The Leopards will do it again with standout running back Jamar Curtis and signal caller Dean DeNobile. John Troxell’s team proved itself last season and won’t be going away in 2024.\n\nEastern Illinois at 12. Youngstown State (Winner to Villanova)\n\nEIU showed a real glimmer of hope last year in Chris Wilkerson’s second season running the ship, winning eight games and landing right in the thick of the Big South-OVC title push. The Panthers might have just enough to break through in 2024, especially with the mass exodus league mate Gardner-Webb had this offseason. YSU will also get in again because of familiar names like Mitch Davidson and Tyshon King. They’ll also get to be at home in the first round with a potential rematch against Villanova looming in the second.\n\nIllinois State at 13. Western Carolina (Winner to Montana State)\n\nThe Missouri Valley is always good for one dark horse and that dark horse this year is Illinois State. Amir Abdullah is one of the best linebackers in the country and will again be hitting hard on the Redbirds defense. Mix that in with a good O line and solid offense, ISU should make its first playoff appearance since 2019. Western Carolina, meanwhile, brings back some big pieces on what was the FCS’ best offense from a season ago. Cole Gonzales knows how to rack up points and, although the Catamounts just missed the selection last season, this year feels like it’ll be different.\n\nRichmond at 14. UT Martin (Winner to Montana)\n\nThe Skyhawks have been oh-so close to the postseason for the last two years after making a showing in 2021 and it feels like it might finally be the season they punch through in the Big South-OVC to get back. Quarterback Kinkead Dent will again lead the offense but now without running back Sam Franklin, things get interesting. That being said, UTM will still have enough to overtake for that top spot in the Big South-OVC. They’ll face Richmond, who gets an at-large in its last CAA season. The Spiders did say farewell to some big time defenders like Tristan Wheeler. With guys like D’Angelo Stocker and QB Kyle Wickersham still around, though, they’re good enough for a spot.\n\nTarleton State at 15. Incarnate Word (Winner to South Dakota State)\n\nLast year was an odd year for UIW. After a sensational 2022 campaign that saw them reach the semifinals, the Cardinals missed out on the playoffs entirely despite winning eight games. This year they should take back the Southland title and return to the mix in Clint Killough’s second season. Then there’s Tarleton State, who’s postseason eligible for the first time since moving up. The Texans seem like they have the makings of a playoff team with running back Kayvon Britten and quarterback Victor Gabalis among several others. TSU gets in in their first year and will see the Cardinals in the opening round.\n\nUAlbany at 16. UC Davis (Winner to North Dakota State)\n\nAs it always seems to be, the Big Sky is going to be top heavy once more and, while UC Davis likely won’t walk away the league champ, they will make the postseason cut and host in the opening round. If running back Lan Larison can stay healthy, the Aggies have a lethal rushing attack. Miles Hastings has proven to be the steady hand at quarterback and Tim Plough’s first season at the helm shapes up to be a good one. UAlbany will come in after reaching the semifinals last year. Star QB Reese Poffenbarger is gone, though, and it feels like a slight setback may be on the horizon for the Danes. With Greg Gatusso in charge, however, you can’t say they’re out of it.\n\nPredicted First Four Out\n\nSouthern Illinois\n\nLosing standout quarterback Nic Baker is really going to hurt SIU this season. The Salukis are still going to be a solid team but trying to maneuver that MVFC schedule is going to be a hefty challenge. Running Ro Elliot is also gone; another big blow to the offense. Nick Hill is a heck of a coach and make no mistake, his team will still play some pretty good ball in 2024. “Pretty good”, however, won’t be enough to make the cut out in the Midwest this year and SIU gets left in the cold.\n\nWilliam & Mary\n\nThe Tribe got bit by some really bad luck last fall with injuries and even then, they came out with a winning record. Running back Bronson Yoder, one of the biggest pieces on the offense who was hurt in 2023, should be good to go this year but those at-large bids in the CAA won’t be easy to come by and William & Mary feels like they’ll need to do a lot to impress the committee enough to get the nod. They certainly have a playoff-caliber team however it might not all come together in a way that gets them there.\n\nEastern Washington\n\nTimes have been hard in Cheney as of late and the Eagles have... weirdly... not given their fans much to be excited about over the last couple of seasons. This year EWU should see some steady improvement with Kekoa Visperas under center again and Efton Chism III still on the outside. There’s some looming questions on that defense, though, and until they can prove that they’re competitive against the Montanas and Montana States of the Big Sky, it’s hard to pencil them in for a playoff spot.\n\nAustin Peay\n\nYes, Austin Peay was the UAC champion last year but a lot has changed in the months since. The Govs have lost a handful of talent either to the NFL or to the transfer portal and teams like Central Arkansas and Tarleton State have done nothing but ascend. Javon Jackson, Tre Shackelford, Kam Thomas and Mike DiLiello are all gone and while the program did bring in a lot, It’s difficult to see that conference sending three to the playoffs. As of right now, Austin Peay is the one left out.\n\nPredicted Final Bracket\n\nHost institutions pictured on the bottom of each pairing."
