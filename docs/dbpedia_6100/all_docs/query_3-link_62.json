        "text": "Matt Rife was born and raised in a small town outside of Columbus, Ohio, Matt first hit the stage when he was only fifteen years old and hasn’t looked back.\n\nRaised in a financially challenged household, Matt spent his final year of high school being homeschooled.\n\nThrough social media, he befriended some of the biggest names in the business who immediately spotted his talent and encouraged him to continue growing as an artist.\n\nRife began opening for and befriending such comedians as DL Hughley, Ralphie May, Finesse Mitchell, Tommy Davidson, Dane Cook, Erik Griffin, Tony Rock, Jo Koy, Bill Bellamy, and DeRay Davis just to name a few.\n\nMatt has gained the respect of veterans of stand up and audiences alike. Word spread quickly about the white “kid” who can rock an urban as well as a mainstream audience.\n\nHis talents, looks, story, and personality have earned him the nickname/tagline of “The Justin Bieber of Comedy.” He also set a record at 17 years old by being the youngest person ever on BET’s ComicView.\n\nFocusing on developing a TV show and expanding his set, Matt now lives in Los Angeles and is now a regular at many of the comedy clubs in the city. Matt has truly found his calling and his natural ability to draw an audience into his world. Working well beyond his years, Matt looks to be heading for greatness.\n\nFollow Matt Rife on Instagram"
