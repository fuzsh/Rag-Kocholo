        "text": "Tommy Davidson’s exceptional range – from stand-up comedy and acting to versatile music accomplishments – have earned him a reputation as an extraordinary performer who delivers no matter the arena. Best known as one of the stars of the hit television show In Living Color, Davidson’s visibility has allowed him to become a household name known for his innovative talent. Davidson started his career as a standup comedian in Washington DC, earning an ardent following. Spotted by major concert promoters, he was first booked as the opening act for Patti LaBelle, Kenny G and Luther Vandross. It wasn’t long before he came to Hollywood and was headlining the biggest rooms and met Robert Townsend.\n\nThis led to his first national tv appearance and starring role in Partners in Crime, the conduit to Keenan Ivory Wayans, who proved instrumental in Davidson’s career by offering him an opportunity to audition. Davidson voiced the series regular role of Cream Corn in the Adult Swim action-comedy spoof Black Dynamite, and has also made multiple guest appearances on shows like MTV’s Wild ‘N Out, BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood and ABC’s Celebrity Wife Swap. He also recently headlined The Off Color Comedy Tour with Keenan Ivory Wayans, Shawn Wayans and David Alan Grier, and co-headlines with Katt Williams, Mike Epps and Martin Lawrence to sell out large venue audiences. Davidson’s feature credits include Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, Morgan Creek’s Juwanna Mann, Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls opposite Jim Carrey, and Strictly Business opposite Halle Berry among others.\n\nHe also recently starred in the feature documentaries I Am Comic opposite Tim Allen and Lewis Black, and Dying Laughing alongside Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman. His most recent critically lauded music duets include Sweet Reunion with multi-Grammy winner Dave Koz and I Know with A-list saxophonist, Richard Elliot."
