        "text": "Dr. Tommy Davidson, DC, PhD age 63 of Gatesville, passed away on Friday, October 11, 2019.\n\nMemorial services will be held at 2:00 p.m. Tuesday, October 15, 2019 at Coryell Community Church in Gatesville, with Dr. Levi Price officiating.\n\nTommy was born on March 21, 1956 in El Paso, Texas to Cotton and Carolyn Mabery Davidson. He was raised in Gatesville and graduated from Gatesville High School in 1974. Tommy attended Baylor University where he played football and received both his Bachelors and Masters degrees. Shortly after, Tommy earned his PhD from Texas A&M University followed by his Doctorate of Chiropractics from Los Angeles Chiropractic College.\n\nDr. Davidson returned to Gatesville to practice chiropractics in both Gatesville and Valley Mills where he served these communities for over thirty years. During that time, Dr. Davidson played a number of roles within the community including positions on the Gatesville City Council, Trustee of Gatesville I.S.D., and was the athletic trainer to both Gatesville High School and Valley Mills High School athletics. Dr. Davidson also served as the team chiropractor for Baylor University athletics for the last decade. He was a coach and mentor to many athletes within the community—from the little to the big league.\n\nDr. Davidson is survived by his wife, Nina Davidson; three children, Dr. Casey Davidson and wife, Ericka, Claire Bostic and husband, Gable, and Will Davidson and fiancé, Jasmine Martin; parents, Cotton and Carolyn Davidson; sisters, Kelly Wood and husband, Dr. Greg Wood, Tracy Sage and husband, Randy; brother, Dr. Ty Davidson and wife, Sam; and two grandchildren, Kate and Lily Davidson.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family encourages memorials to be made to the Gatesville Boys and Girls Club, 2533 E. Main Street, Gatesville, TX 76528."
