        "text": "All the golfers who will be competing in men’s and women’s golf at the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nThe US Open concluded the men’s golf competition qualification process at the 2024 Olympics in Paris, while the women’s qualifying ended a week later at the KPMG Women’s PGA Championship.\n\n60 women and 60 men earned a spot in Paris and will battle it out over four rounds at Le Golf National in August.\n\nParis 2024 will mark the third consecutive time the Olympics includes golf after its return to the schedule following a 112-year absence. The 2016 Olympics in Rio saw many players withdraw due to the Zika virus, while Tokyo 2020 was impacted by Covid, so 2024 should be the first time the biggest names are all in attendance.\n\nThat said, the Olympic qualifying criteria is designed to ensure players from around the world are represented, including a large portion of the field ranked outside the Official World Golf Rankings (OWGR) top 200, so some big names will miss out.\n\nU.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau is probably the biggest of the lot not to be included, due to four Americans being above him in the OWGR. Fellow LIV golfers Cameron Smith and Sergio Garcia have also seen their world rankings drop and will miss out.\n\nHow golfers qualify for the Olympics\n\nA total of 120 golfers will participate in the 2024 Olympics — 60 in the men’s competition and 60 in the women’s – the same number as at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nTwo spots — one in the men’s field and one in the women’s — were set aside for host nation France. All five continents of the Olympic Movement (Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania) were also guaranteed at least one male and one female competitor.\n\nThe Olympics uses the OWGR to select the rest of its participants.\n\nThe top 15 players in the OWGR automatically qualify for the Olympics, though a maximum of four golfers per country can be selected from that group. For example, the United States had nine golfers in the top 15 of the OWGR, but will only take the four highest-ranking members of that group.\n\nBeyond that, the rest of the places were allocated based on OWGR but limited to two male and two female representatives per country.\n\nWhich men’s golfers are playing at the 2024 Olympics in Paris?\n\nMen’s Olympic golf teams by country\n\nHere is a country-by-country look at the 60 participants in the men’s field for golf at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nArgentina (2)\n\nEmiliano Grillo\n\nAlejandro Tosti\n\nAustralia (2)\n\nJason Day\n\nMin Woo Lee\n\nAustria (1)\n\nSepp Straka\n\nBelgium (2)\n\nThomas Detry\n\nAdrien Dumont du Chassart\n\nCanada (2)\n\nCorey Conners\n\nNick Taylor\n\nChile (2)\n\nJoaquin Niemann\n\nMito Periera\n\nChina (2)\n\nZechang Dou\n\nCarl Yuan\n\nChinese Taipei (2)\n\nC.T.

(2)\n\nRose Zhang (9)\n\nWho won Olympic golf last time?\n\nXander Schauffele won gold for America, with Rory Sabbatini picking up silver for Slovakia, and Pan Cheng-tsung securing bronze for Chinese Taipei.\n\nIn the women’s Olympic golf, USA’s Nelly Korda took gold, Japan’s Mone Inami won silver, and Lydia Ko bagged a bronze medal for New Zealand.\n\nWho are the leading contenders for medals in golf at the 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nTom Kim (South Korea)\n\nA three-time PGA Tour winner before the age of 21, Kim has had some good results in 2024, including a recent second-place finish at the Travelers Championship and a T4 at the Canadian Open, but he’s also missed the cut at The Open and the Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nHe shot a 64 and finished T6 at the French Open at Le Golf National last year, so won’t be going in blind like some of the other big names.\n\nCollin Morikawa (USA)\n\nThat the world number six (seven at the end of qualification) only just snuck into the team highlights USA’s strength in depth.\n\nHe finished in the top four at this year’s Masters and PGA Championship, in the top-16 at the US Open and The Open, and has only one winless season since turning pro.\n\nA seven-man playoff saw him miss out on a bronze medal in Tokyo.\n\nJon Rahm (Spain)\n\nLIV Golf’s biggest signing hasn’t won in his new tour yet but sits second in its overall season-long standings, and that’s despite withdrawing from one event due to a foot injury.\n\nA T7 at The Open was an improvement on the rest of his 2024 major season which had seen a T45 at The Masters, a missed cut at the PGA Championship, and no appearance at the US Open due to the same injury.\n\nScottie Scheffler (USA)\n\nThe most dominant run since peak Tiger Woods saw Scheffler bag five wins in two months while not finishing outside the top-20 from the start of the year to the US Open. A tough time at Pinehurst showed he’s human (and that being arrested isn’t conducive to major success), but he won the Travelers on his very next start. The world number one will be the man to beat in Paris.\n\nRory McIlroy (Ireland)\n\nLet’s park that US Open heartbreak, and the disappointing showing at Royal Troon, and focus on the positives. He’s won twice in 2024, has eight major top-10s in the last three seasons, and is number three in the world.\n\nHe last played the Open de France at Le Golf National in 2016, finishing third and posting a 66.\n\nWe still believe. The question is: does Rory?\n\nAlex Noren (Sweden)\n\nA blast from the past, but Noren is worth keeping an eye on thanks to his reputation as a course specialist. He won the Open de France at Le Golf National in 2018 and ranks 13th for Strokes Gained: Total on the PGA Tour this season.\n\nXander Schauffele (USA)\n\nImpossible not to mention the man who’s won half of 2024’s majors (the PGA Championship and The Open), hasn’t finished outside the top 20 in one of golf’s biggest events since 2021, and won the gold medal in Tokyo.\n\nSchauffele hasn’t missed a cut since April 2022 and it would be no surprise to see him successfully defend the gold he secured last time with rounds of 68-63-68-67.\n\nSepp Straka (Austria)\n\nFinished a shot shy of the bronze medal playoff in 2022 and will hope to at least make the podium in Paris.\n\nT7 and T2 finishes at last year’s PGA Championship and Open Championship, alongside victory at the John Deere Classic and a good showing in the Tour Championship, earned him a Ryder Cup wildcard pick.\n\nCeline Boutier (France)\n\nThe top-ranked European and home favorite has yet to reach the heights of last season, when she won four times, but she lives in Paris and graduated from the academy at Le Golf National. She also won the Evian Championship by six shots in front of a home crowd last year.\n\nWe spoke to Boutier about the pressure of carrying French hopes on her shoulders, the traits you need to do well at Le Golf National, and whether she’d settle for silver or bronze.\n\nNelly Korda\n\nQuiet off the course but box office on it, the world number one has already won six times in 2024, including the Chevron Championship.\n\nThree missed cuts in a row tempered expectations a touch, but her modus operandi tells us she’ll dominate the par 5s and she’s the clear favorite to repeat her gold medal exploits from Tokyo 2020.\n\nAtthaya Thitikul (Thailand)\n\nInjuries have affected her season but you can’t ignore her exceptiona; short game or impressive recent form – the 21-year-old has ten top-10 finishes from 16 starts. She also ended the 2023 season with the best scoring average on tour.\n\nJin Young Ko (South Korea)\n\nWon seven times from July 2021 to March 2022 but has struggled with injuries since. Yet to get off the mark this season, though she did finish T2 at the Women’s PGA Championship. She’ll need to get her driver working better to win gold, as the world number three has been losing around 0.5 strokes per round off the tee.\n\nLydia Ko (New Zealand)\n\nLooking to complete the triad after silver in Rio and bronze in Tokyo. Fantastic early season form has petered out with two missed cuts and then T46 and T39 in her last two starts.\n\nYuka Saso (Japan)\n\nAnyone with two US Open wins in four years needs to be taken seriously. Saso won two golds for the Philippines in the 2018 Asian Games. Now representing Japan, she has the power and the towering ball flight to tame the long par 4s at Le Golf National.\n\nLilia Vu (USA)\n\nA double major champion in 2023 and the second-best player in the world, Vu won on her return from injury at the Meijer LPGA Classic and then finished second at the Women’s PGA Championship a week later.\n\nRose Zhang (USA)\n\nHard to find fault in her game and has built a reputation as one of the best ball-strikers on tour. Zhang also ended Nelly Korda’s winning streak with a commanding display at the Cognizant Founders Cup in May. Expect the 21-year-old to kick on now she’s finished her exams at Stanford until the winter.\n\nFind everything you need to know about the Olympic golf format here.\n\nAbout the author\n\nRob McGarr – Contributing Editor\n\nRob has been a writer and editor for over 15 years, covering all manner of subjects for leading magazines and websites.\n\nHe has previously been Features Editor of Today’s Golfer magazine and Digital Editor of todays-golfer.com, and held roles at FHM, Men’s Running, Golf World, and MAN Magazine.\n\nYou can follow him on YouTube where – depending on what day of the week it is – he’ll either be trying his best to get his handicap down to scratch or shoving his clubs in a cupboard, never to be seen again."
