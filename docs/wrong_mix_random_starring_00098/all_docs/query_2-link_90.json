WebinarTotal Rewards Strategy\n\nPramod Krishnaprasad,\n\nBNY Mellon & Pershing India\n\nAyan Majumdar,\n\nSenior Director - Talent, Reward and HR Transformation, General Assembly\n\nRemote Working advocates are rejoicing as the pandemic proves their theory of future working models to be right. Organizations have been propelled to accept the new normal and work towards designing processes that can make this a sustainable and successful shift for employers and employees alike.\n\nWhile they try to establish their position in the remote vs. in-office spectrum, there is an increasing focus on the reward approach that aligns with a hybrid workplace model.

The more important the position and access to sensitive data, the more crucial the need for background screening. Many companies conduct their screening only when a person is hired, rather than throughout the entire tenure of an employee. This is where many companies have weaknesses in security risks. In a world wherein the definition of a workplace is getting blurred and talent osmosis through borderless economy becoming a norm, employment verification of potential future employees has become a critical measure of a recruitment index.

The highest-performing companies in the world are great at writing.\n\nSo, how do you evaluate and build critical thinking and writing skills in your company? This panel discussion will explore how companies think about critical thinking and writing in hiring, learning and development, and promotions.
