        "text": "Overall deal value in the first five months of 2024 reached $535 billion, up 30% from the comparable period a year earlier, PwC said, and deals valued at $10 billion or more had the strongest start of the year in at least a decade. The firm, which has private-equity clients, painted a bullish picture of dealmaking on the rebound, albeit at a more moderate pace than the resurgence following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. That recovery was “almost like a 90-degree angle and came right out of the gates,” said Colin Wittmer, formerly PwC’s U.S. deals leader who became its U.S. chief financial officer this month. Desai added that he has seen a significant uptick in businesses looking to shed units or sell themselves, suggesting that sales will pick up.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Motorola and Regions Financial are among a dozen companies that have removed diversity criteria from executive bonus plans this year after pressure from conservatives, as the political backlash to the initiatives continue to divide US boardrooms. The 12 companies were among 60 that dropped environmental, social and governance incentives from their executive pay plans after pressure from Strive, the anti-ESG asset manager founded by Donald Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy. Launched in 2022, Strive has more than $1.6bn of assets under management. Matt Cole, Strive’s chief executive, applauded the companies’ moves away from DEI and ESG measures, and said the decision improved executive incentives.\n\nAs Congress gears up for a tax rewrite next year, private-equity lobbyists are meeting with lawmakers and preparing for a fierce fight to preserve the industry’s most valuable tax benefits. Major elements of the Republicans’ 2017 tax bill expire at the end of next year, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are staking out positions for what they expect to be a mammoth negotiation over extending or revising its tax cuts. With incumbent Democrats and Republicans far apart on tax policies—many of the former seek to raise taxes on corporations and the rich, while the latter aim to preserve Trump-era cuts—business lobbyists are swarming Washington to defend their industries’ favored provisions. The uncertain outlook for November’s elections adds urgency to those efforts. Private equity has two big priorities: protecting the carried-interest tax break and ensuring that businesses can continue deducting interest payments at the current rate of up to 30% of profits. “Pretty much every industry group is in full talks on tax reform. Nobody is looking for a win—they’re looking to defend provisions in the [2017 law] and make sure they’re not on the chopping block,” said James Maloney, founder and managing partner of communications and lobbying firm Tiger Hill Partners, which works with private equity.\n\nThree private equity groups are battling it out in the final stages of an auction process for school operator Nord Anglia, in what is likely to be one of the largest European deals of the year. Bain Capital, Permira and Veritas Capital are among the contenders through to the last round of the sale process, according to people familiar with the matter. Final bids for a majority stake in the London-based group are due later this month and the business could be valued at up to $15bn, the people added. Other bidders could yet be involved, one of the people cautioned. Nord Anglia’s existing owners — Swedish private equity group EQT and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board — are likely to retain a stake in any deal, the people said. The Singapore wealth fund GIC is also likely to co-invest alongside a possible winning bidder, they added. The deal is among the largest potential transactions in Europe this year, ranking alongside the likes of Abu Dhabi’s National Oil Company’s potential €14.4bn deal for German chemical group Covestro, and would-be acquirers face complications due to the deal’s multibillion-dollar size. Larger private equity takeovers have faced challenges in recent years as higher interest rates make financing the deals more costly.\n\nBusiness is healthier abroad. Halliburton said its international revenue rose 8% year over year, marking the 12th consecutive quarter of growth in that business. SLB, which has higher exposure to international markets, said revenue abroad surged 18%, led by impressive 24% growth in the Middle East. Capacity-expansion projects are “in full swing” in countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq, SLB CEO Olivier Le Peuch said on Friday’s earnings call. Though Saudi Arabia earlier this year said it would hold off on its oil-capacity-expansion project, it should keep services firms busy on unconventional gas fields such as Jafurah. The kingdom has ambitious plans to increase natural-gas production by more than 60% by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. Halliburton’s shares fell about 5% on Friday and international-focused SLB’s shares rose about 2%, but both have underperformed relative to crude oil prices and the rest of the industry year to date. They are trading at substantial discounts to their historical average, with SLB’s enterprise value at about 8 times forward 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, 26% lower than its 10-year average. On the same metric, Halliburton is trading 29% below its historical average. The big shadow looming over service firms is the timing of the recovery in North America, if it comes at all. Halliburton, which relies on the region for about 45% of its revenue, said it doesn’t expect much improvement this year and expects revenue to decline 6% to 8% for the full year. Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller thinks activity should return in 2025 after producers digest their acquisitions and sell some noncore assets to smaller operators.\n\nPrivate equity firms have sharply curtailed their use of a controversial debt financing manoeuvre to return cash to investors, after institutions raised concerns about how some groups have embraced new forms of leverage to compensate for a lack of deals. So-called net asset value loans used to pay dividends fell by about 90 per cent during the second half of last year following heightened criticism from investors, according to 17Capital, a New York based specialist lender that has pioneered the market. Buyout firms have increasingly added an additional layer of leverage on top of their typical deal-linked borrowing, taking on debt secured against their fund investments, with some firms relying on those funds to pay dividends to investors.\n\nPrivate-credit participants can continue to self-monitor risks, which can raise further concerns for regulators while offering potential advantages for borrowers and funds, according to a Moody’s Ratings report published on Thursday. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals last month rejected a 2023 rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission that would have required private asset managers to provide details of fees and expenses to investors. The appeals court found the rule to be beyond the SEC’s authority. The ruling means enhanced oversight of the private fund industry may be a distance off, the Moody’s report said.\n\nThe private-equity industry is grappling with a tale of two cities in 2024, with bullish or bearish outlooks often depending on which side of the market firms find themselves. Dealmakers, flush with cash in their fund coffers, are increasingly bullish, citing pent-up demand as well as an anticipated interest-rate cut. But fund managers and those involved in fundraising can be more bearish, particularly if they are confronted with languishing fund performances and struggle to sell earlier investments. Those with bearish views are “just laying it out that there is going to be certain [fund] investment vintages that don’t look like prior years,” said Kevin Desai, U.S. private-equity lead at advisory firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Desai said he expects the mergers-and-acquisitions market to be robust for the rest of the year. But metrics that firms use to assess the performance of an investment, such as distributed to paid-in capital (DPI), multiple on invested capital (MOIC), or internal rate of return (IRR), which includes unrealized gains, might be more challenged than they have been historically. “You don’t have the run-up in multiples that you had in prior years,” he said.\n\nJuly 12, 2024The energy transition toward cleaner, less carbon-intensive sources is real. Oil and gas are not going away any time soon. That may sound like a contradiction, but it is more like a description. While fossil fuels are projected to see potential declining demand in coming decades, they will still be a significant part of the energy mix. That will be the case even in scenarios where the world substantially accelerates progress toward net zero.1 Climate policy is focused on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to achieving the 1.5°C pathway which was set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement and reaffirmed in the COP 28 UAE Consensus in December 2023.2 However, it is just as important to ensure access to an affordable, reliable, and competitive global energy supply for everyone, everywhere. All four elements are related to each other and addressing all four is essential to a successful transition. Otherwise, the unsteady progress toward substantial emissions reductions could stall further; there are and will be trade-offs.\n\nThe world’s demand for oil is expected by Goldman Sachs Research to grow for the next decade. Lackluster electric vehicle sales and rising incomes around the globe are increasing the appetite for energy supplies that will be met primarily with more fossil fuels. While some prominent forecasters have predicted oil demand will peak by 2030, our researchers expect oil usage will increase through 2034. That’s in part because of demand for oil from emerging markets in Asia and demand for petrochemicals, according to a report by Goldman Sachs Research. “We think peak demand is another decade away, and more importantly, after the decade it takes to peak, it plateaus, rather than sharply declines, for another few years,” write Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, and analyst Amber Cai in the team’s report."
