The PDS for financial products offered through InvestSMART can be downloaded from this website or obtained by contacting 1300 880 160.\n\n* InvestSMART’s capped management fees (capped at $550 p.a.) do not include indirect cost ratio charged by ETF providers nor brokerage. Indirect Costs are estimated to be between 0.09% - 0.30% p.a. depending on the portfolio. For more information about fees and costs, please see the Product Disclosure Statement and Investment Menu.\n\n# Performance figures are after management and admin fees excl. brokerage and assuming dividends re-invested and no withdrawals. Performance figures for periods greater than one year are annualised and presented as \"per annum\" values. The peer comparison figures have been sourced from Morningstar data and is therefore limited to the funds and investment products included in their database. This may not include all funds available for retail investment in Australia. The peer calculation is inclusive of admin and management fees; excludes brokerage and no withdrawals have been made. InvestSMART cannot determine whether or not franking has been included, nor if dividends have been reinvested. Historical performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.\n\n^ Only funds and investment products included in the Morningstar Australia database are available for fee and performance comparison. This may not include all funds available for retail investment in Australia. Only funds with > three year returns were included in any fee comparison, and were compared to Morningstar’s nominated benchmark. Fees are calculated by Morningstar as the average over 10 years. Whilst every care has been taken in producing these numbers, InvestSMART does not guarantee the accuracy of the figures produced in the table. Fee data may not include all costs being charged such as platform and adviser fees. For the effect of fees on your cumulative returns, please see our report How Fees Can Destroy Your Wealth.\n\n^^ The performance figures for the Intelligent Investor Income and Growth Model Portfolios are since inception on 1 August 2001 using theoretical buys and sells without brokerage and management fees until 1 July 2015. After the 1 July 2015 performance figures (after fees and brokerage) were recorded from the Separately Managed Accounts that mirrored these models. After 18 June 2019 performance figures (after fees and brokerage) have been recorded from the Australian Equity Income ETF (ASX: INIF) which mirrors the Income Model and after 5 October 2020 performance figures (after fees and brokerage) have been recorded from the Australian Equity Growth ETF (ASX: IIGF) which mirrors the Growth Model. Past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance."
