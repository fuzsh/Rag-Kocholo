        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley looked incredible as she posed alongside ex-husband Arun Nayar at a New Year's Eve bash.\n\nThe 58-year-old actress and wealthy entrepreneur appeared friendly as they enjoyed an eventful night together. Elizabeth took to her Instagram page to share pictures of the pair while they cosied up next to each other. In the caption, she wrote: 'Mamma and Daddy.' The Four Weddings and a Funeral star showed off her curves in a racy sequin dress and grey heels while Arun looked dapper in a black suit and crisp white shirt.\n\nThe pair were married from 2007 to 2011, but have remained good friends after their divorce. Back in April 2011, Hurley filed for divorce, citing Nayar's \"unreasonable behaviour\" as the cause. However, more than a decade later, the pair appear to have no bad blood between them after reuniting.\n\nElizabeth and Arun were last pictured together in August 2022 when they attended Damian's graduation from drama school. The 21-year-old former student wrote in the caption: \"Mama and Daddyo at graduation with mee!\" Damian is the son of the famous actress and her ex-husband Steve Bing. The late movie producer tragically died by suicide at the age of 55 in June 2020.\n\nArun remains a fatherly figure in Damian's life and opening up about their relationship, Elizbeth said: \"Arun is Damian's daddy and a very good one too, they see each other a lot.\" While it had been claimed that Bing had never met his son, Elizabeth confirmed after his death that father and son had grown close in recent times and had spoken on Damian's 18th birthday.\n\nThe model and actress told YOU magazine in 2020: \"It had been great to connect again. We hadn’t been friends for a very long time, but about a year and a half ago he came back into our lives. It’s very sad… just terrible. Horrific that it happened but there is some comfort to know we had made up and there was no bad feeling.\"\n\nIt comes after Damian followed in the footsteps of his multitalented mother, and directed two movies, one of which stars Elizabeth. He was recently seen working on his new film, an erotic thriller titled 'Strictly Confidential' in June.\n\nThe film marks Damien's first foray into Hollywood with the self-penned film, which he thanked the cast and crew for helping make happen. He took to Instagram and penned: \"I can't begin to sum up how intense and wonderful the past few months have been.\n\n\"I'm truly blown away by the inspiring and talented people I've been able to work with – with immense gratitude to my phenomenal cast. Everyone involved deserves public declarations of adoration (all of which will come in due course - but right now I want to worship Elizabeth Hurley who, during the making of my first ever short film back in 2010 (when I was eight) promised me she'd be in my first feature; true to her word, the minute this film was green-lit, Mama dropped everything and raced out to the beautiful Caribbean to help.\n\n\"Working together was a dream.\" He added: \"Every single person played a vital role in bringing this project from script to screen and I am forever grateful. This has genuinely been the most incredible experience, both professionally and personally.\""
