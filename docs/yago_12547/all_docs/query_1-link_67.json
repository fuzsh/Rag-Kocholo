        "text": "\"The Beast Must Die\" is a 1974 horror film directed by Paul Annett. Covering werewolves as its main creature-based theme, the film houses an interesting \"whodunit\" mystery element to things. This isn't even in generality of things, but actually something that the film champions and wears on its shoulders, breaking the fourth wall and conversing directly with the viewership on who they think the culprit may be. The novelty element isn't long, but it's a good suggestive buy in that helps aid attention for the rest of the film's length. The overall narrative is in placed in a setting much similar to the infamous short story \"The Most Dangerous Game\". A similar concept of man being the most ultimate prey…\n\nThe Beast Must Die plays out like something of a cross between And Then There Were None and The Most Dangerous Game, only with a werewolf twist. The simple plot focuses on a group of people brought together by a rich hunter who believes one of them to be a werewolf. The central gimmick is the guessing game over the identity of the werewolf. The film informs the viewer at the start that they will be given a \"werewolf break\" at the end to try and guess. It's all rather quaint and camp, but it's never anywhere near as much fun as it could have been which is a shame really. The film really fails in the execution. There's not…\n\nThis crazy whodunnit is my second favourite werewolf film. I love everything about it. Calvin Lockhart here is a fine specimen and his whole manner and voice is so dramatic, love!! The music whether it be the eerie tense times or the funky is all great to me. I am jiggling away on the couch everytime. The plot itself from that mad opening to harassing all of his guests to find out who the werewolf is, Calvin's outfits, Peter Cushing's mad accent that he forgets sometimes, his employee operating all the cameras in the trees and whatnot. It's all ludicrous in the best possible way and I lap every second of it up. The country mansion and gardens settings is…\n\nThis is a hard-to-categorize Amicus feature from 1973 that intriguingly blends genres.\n\nThe central conceit is that there is a werewolf in the group of guests that have been invited by millionaire Tom Newcliffe to spend three days at an isolated estate in the English countryside. Newcliffe, a renowned big-game hunter, is obsessed with lycanthropy and is determined to stalk and kill a werewolf. Naturally, things spin out of control and it seems that Newcliffe will get far more than he bargained for.\n\nBahamian-American actor Calvin Lockhart is commanding as Newcliffe, a role that would be played by Edris Elba if this film were to be re-made today. Peter Cushing is one of the guests and Michael Gambon (with obvious…\n\nA werewolf mystery that asks its audience to guess who the beast is, Paul Annett's \"The Beast Must Die\" combines a fun concept with lackluster execution. The Amicus production boasts a sturdy cast but lacks the energy and atmosphere to make it anything more than mildly watchable.\n\nThe plot revolves around a wealthy, big game hunter who has taken down nearly every type of animal. Assembling a group of people at his home, he declares his intention of tracking his biggest quarry: a werewolf. The story casts suspicion on all of the hunter's guest, and, literally, asks its audience to solve the mystery of which guest is the titular monster.\n\nIt is a compelling story idea with some fun moments,…"
