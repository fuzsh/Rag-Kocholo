Unfortunately, there are a ton of really cool screenings, events, and shows that I've left out due to space.\n\nBlue Collar and True Lies double feature at the Metrograph. Zero thematic connections whatsoever other than being completely perfect in every way.\n\nAll of the psychotic European shock films that I've seen at KGB on Sundays. I don't even remember what most of them are called!\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah at The Roxy. Biased because I just put that screening together.\n\nTouch of Evil at Syndicated's Sidewalk Cinema. This one couple brought a barking dog and they should be ashamed.\n\nStar Trek II at Nitehawk's The Deuce. The confusing mixture of trekkies and filmheads in the audience was so much fun.\n\nRichard Kern shorts night at Bella Ciao. Three people fainted!\n\nCoppola's The Conversation at Film Forum. Unbelievably sick restoration and great snack selection.\n\n9. see myself living anywhere else.\n\nShowgirls at IFC Center on 35mm. Verhoeven is the king.\n\nDemme's Something Wild on TV right before a disastrous breakup.\n\nThe Slashening and Secret of Cuck Island at Our Wicked Lady in Bushwick. Microbudget horror crowds are so fun!\n\nThe short films of Yuri Alves. The guy is a genius out of Newark and all of his stuff is on Vimeo!\n\nHealth Ensurance 2. Michael Rees put on one of the best short film nights I've ever experienced. Electric.\n\nDanielle Burgos\n\nWriter\n\nNew releases:\n\nMad God (Phil Tippett)\n\nMemoria (Apichatpong Weerasethakul) technically 2021 but only ever in theaters supposedly, and in NYC for a week in August 2022, so.\n\nEarth II (Anti-Banality Union)\n\nPetit Maman\n\n␀. ANSWERING THE SUN\n\nA digital attempt to outdo Helios himself. I thought this was going to explore Forbidden Colors, but it did not. No attempt at pushing the digital limit can compete with AFA’s reopening choice, full-sensory Sharits’ double-barrel film RAZOR BLADES.\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nAll That Jazz (1979)\n\nBrain Damage (1988)\n\nBullet in the Head (1990)\n\nBurnt Offerings (1976) Dan Curtis.

A few I recall.\n\nThrough the Olive Trees (Abbas Kiarostami, 1994)) And Life Goes On was the last film I watched in the cinema in March 2020 when the first lockdown started. Finally saw Through the Olive Trees in the cinema summer 2022.\n\nThe Wind Will Carry Us (Abbas Kiarostami, 1999) - there was a retro in town this summer. First viewing. Not as brilliant as Taste of Cherry, but in every way brilliant.\n\nMahanagar (The Big City) - (Satyajit Ray, 1963). Progressive, modern cinema on every level.\n\nTerence Davies\n\nFilmmaker, Benediction\n\nFirst viewings (unranked):\n\nThe White Ribbon (Michael Haneke, 2009)\n\nThe Grand Budapest Hotel (Wes Anderson, 2014)\n\nThe Power of the Dog (Jane Campion, 2021)\n\nSurprise Package (Stanley Donen, 1960)\n\nEveryday Rebellion (Arash T. Riahi, 2013)\n\nExile Family Movie (Arash T. Riahi, 2006)\n\nEismayer (David Wagner, 2022)\n\nAfter Love (Aleem Khan, 2020)\n\nClouds of Sils Maria (Olivier Assayas, 2014)\n\nNick Davis\n\nNew releases:\n\nDonbass - I still think it's criminal that it took epic devastation for this to interest US distributors, but it's as astonishing and ambitious now as when I saw it four years ago, and even more essential. For all that, I still don't think it got its due in this long-deferred Stateside rollout, but I'll keep beating the drum.\n\nAftersun\n\nHappening\n\nEO\n\nGreat Freedom\n\nCareless Crime\n\nRRR\n\nTÁR\n\nDecision to Leave\n\nHoly Spider\n\nHonorable mentions: Compartment No. 6; Both Sides of the Blade; another inexplicably delayed arrival on these shores, A Man of Integrity; and another, very different Loznitsa triumph, Babi Yar. Context\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nEuropa '51 (Rosellini) - Surely the least discussed of the Rosellini/Bergman collaborations (albeit hardly an obscurity), which may explain what took me so long but also gave my awestruck response an extra veneer of welcome surprise\n\nMalina (Schroeter)\n\nLittle Dorrit (Edzard)\n\nThe Oak (Pintilie)\n\nThe Story of Qiu Ju (Zhang)\n\nThe Life of Oharu (Mizoguchi)\n\nThe Black Stallion (Ballard)\n\nThe Flavor of Green Tea over Rice (Ozu)\n\nJu Dou (Zhang)\n\nUnknown Pleasures (Jia)\n\nMonsieur Hire (Leconte)\n\nOnce Around (Hallström)\n\nLa Cérémonie (Chabrol)\n\nThe Killing Floor (Duke)\n\nCasque d'or (Becker)\n\nTwin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (Lynch)\n\nThe Unbelievable Truth (Hartley)\n\nCrush (Maclean)\n\nDangerous Game (Ferrara)\n\nToo Beautiful for You (Blier)\n\nJon Dieringer\n\nEditor-in-chief, Screen Slate\n\nNew releases:\n\nJackass Forever (Jeff Tremaine)\n\nAftersun (Charlotte Wells)\n\nRRR (S. S. Rajamouli)\n\nSick of Myself (Kristoffer Borgli)\n\nFunny Pages (Owen Kline)\n\nMurina (Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović)\n\nCrimes of the Future (David Cronenberg)\n\nBunker (Jenny Perlin)\n\nHapper’s Comet (Tyler Taormina)\n\nInspector Ike (Graham Mason)\n\nFirst viewings and discoveries:\n\nCollege Boys Live (George O'Donnell, 2009)\n\nDefinitively the overlooked masterpiece of the 00s.\n\nA Strange Harvest (Linda Moulton Howe, 1980) & Endangered Species (Alan Rudolph, 1982)\n\nStruck upon this cattle mutilation doc/fiction double feature while researching our UFO series. I think Amos Vogel would have lost his shit over A Strange Harvest.\n\nThe Ondekoza (Tai Kato, 1981)\n\nIncredible taiko drummer performance film featuring great butts.\n\nOne Fall (Marcus Dean Fuller, 2011)\n\nBizarre vanity project by actor Marcus Dean Fuller, playing a character “James Bond” who returns to his small hometown with healing powers after he survives a 200-foot drop off a cliff. On Tubi, of course.\n\nSister Act 2 (Bill Duke, 1993) w/ Lion King’s “The Circle of Life”\n\nLauryn Hill is a force of nature. Mitchell slotted Sister Act 2 into our \"Bad Habits\" nun series at Roxy, and the 35mm print had the opening number of The Lion King attached as a promo. Animation on film is unsurpassed.\n\nPractical Magic (Griffin Dunne, 1998) & Mermaids (Richard Benjamin, 1990)\n\nProgramming this as a Sunday brunch double feature in October would be printing money. Free idea for NYC movie theaters.\n\nThe Appointment (Lindsey C. Vickers, 1982)\n\nHad been clamoring for an upgrade from VHS for this for years—it appears the film elements are lost, but BFI released a much improved video transfer. The analog fuzz doesn't hurt this bizarre, narcotic gem. The first scene, tacked on after-the-fact, is a standalone masterpiece, even if you spend the rest of the film puzzling over what it has to do with anything.\n\nAnalog horror shorts on YouTube\n\nEmerson Goo turned me onto this scene where accounts post short—typically two-to-five minute—abstract, non-narrative horror films steeped in analog aesthetics. One of them, Kyle Edward Ball, is poised for a breakout with the release of his feature Skinamarink in January.\n\nThe Plaint of Steve Kreines as Recorded by His Younger Brother Jeff (Jeff Kreines, 1974) & Ricky and Rocky (Jeff Kreines & Tom Palazzolo)|\n\nKreines is best known for co-directing the essential Seventeen with Joel DeMott. But these earlier portraits of white middle-class midwestern life are more evidence of why he was considered a young prodigy.\n\nBullet in the Head (John Woo, 1990)\n\nOn glorious bullet-sprayed celluloid. Sources tell me the rights to John Woo's films are being held hostage by a hotel chain. Free John Woo.\n\nShredder Orpheus (Robert McGinley, 1990)\n\nPost-apocalyptic industrial metal skateboarding adaptation of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Would make a sick double feature with Jacques Demy's Parking.\n\nThe Night of Counting the Years (Shadi Abdel Salam, 1975)\n\nHeavy.\n\nAyanna Dozier\n\nArtist/writer\n\nAfter a rather busy fall, I will finally have free time beginning December 11th, three days after the deadline, to watch critically acclaimed films that my friends have raved about all year. This includes titles like Tár, Eo, Bones and All, Corsage, Aftersun, Saint Omer, All the Beauty and Bloodshed, and Nanny. Titles that may possibly end up on my \"best of\" list for 2023, but who knows? What I've assembled below is a combined list of first watches for the year that include several (but not 10) titles from 2022.\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nLust Caution (2007) directed by Ang Lee\n\nThe Eternal Daughter (2022) directed by Joanna Hogg\n\nGod's Creatures (2022) directed by Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer\n\nDans Ma Peau (2002) directed by Marina de Van\n\nSchool of the Holy Beast (1974) directed by Norifumi Suzuki\n\nDeadly Illusion (1987) directed by Larry Cohen\n\nThe Cathedral (2022) directed by Ricky D'Ambrose\n\nOnanism (1969) directed by Nalini Malani\n\nWhen I Put My Hands on Your Body (1989) directed by David Wojnarowicz and Marion Scemama\n\nNight Vision (Red as never been) (2022) directed by Na Mira\n\nWhite Dust from Magnolia (1980) directed by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha\n\nDecision to Leave (2022) directed by Park Chan-wook\n\nElvis (2022) directed by Baz Luhrmann\n\nNosferasta: First Bite (2021) directed by Bayley Sweitzer and Adam Khalil\n\nRewind and Play (2022) directed by Alain Gomus\n\nHanna Edizel\n\nEditor\n\nFirst viewings and discoveries:\n\nCollege Boys Live (George O'Donnell, 2009)\n\nDead Bang (John Frankenheimer, 1989)\n\nDeadly Illusion (Larry Cohen & William Tannen, 1987)\n\nFlesh+Blood (Paul Verhoeven, 1985)\n\nThe Gift (Sam Raimi, 2000)\n\nHigh Tide (Gillian Armstrong, 1987)\n\nJackass Forever (Jeff Tremaine, 2022)\n\nLight Sleeper (Paul Schrader, 1992)\n\nThe 4th Man (Paul Verhoeven, 1983)\n\nDas Millionenspiel (Tom Toelle, 1970)\n\nPrince of Darkness (John Carpenter, 1987)\n\nRobin Redbreast (James MacTaggart, 1970)\n\nSchalcken the Painter (Leslie Megahey, 1979)\n\nSerial Mom (John Waters, 1994)\n\nSnake Eyes (Brian De Palma, 1998)\n\nSpetters (Paul Verhoeven, 1980)\n\nThief of Hearts (Douglas Day Stewart, 1984)\n\nWhite of the Eye (Donald Cammell, 1987)\n\nMiles Emanuel\n\nIndefatigable cinephile/Actor, Funny Pages\n\nAlthough I saw more than ten new releases this year, there is only one that I expect I will still be thinking about at the end of 2023. So I am using the nine extra slots for first viewings of movies made in years past. Notable for me, if not the list you see below—this December, I watched my ten thousandth movie. And still, I have things like Peter Watkins’ Resan ahead of me. Never, in this game, does one run out of things to look forward to.\n\nNew release:\n\nEarwig (Lucile Hadžihalilović)\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nHu-Man (Jérôme Laperrousaz, 1975)\n\nSmashing the 0-Line (Seijun Suzuki, 1960)\n\nL’homme aux yeux d’argent (Pierre Granier-Deferre, 1985)\n\nNot of This Earth (Roger Corman, 1957)\n\nMovement Studies in Paris (Joris Ivens, 1928)\n\nPour le Mistral (Joris Ivens, 1966)\n\nBed and Sofa (Abram Room, 1927)\n\nThe Psychic (Lucio Fulci, 1977)\n\nWhat Scoundrels Men Are!

This animated, punk-soundtracked Sci-Fi epic will have you rooting for the villain (or maybe that's just me)--discovered through Kier-La Janisse's too-good-to-be-true cinema podcast, \"A Song From the Heart Beats the Devil Every Time.\"\n\n\"Third from the Sun,\" Twilight Zone, season 1, episode 14 (1960). Although actor Fritz Weaver later got typecast as a bad guy, he reveals himself as a model leading man with a Mid-Atlantic accent to die for; the consummate Cold War episode--how did it sneak past censors?\n\nHopper/Welles (2020). I have become evangelistic about this 1970 conversation between Dennis Hopper and Orson Welles--although Orson hardly appears during their 130-minute exchange, he is the driving force of this film for his lapidary but respectful off-camera probing, impelling Dennis to drop all masks.\n\nIce Station Zebra (1968). Gloriously free of CGI and reminding of what can be done on a soundstage; outstanding performances by Rock Hudson and Patrick McGoohan.\n\nTinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (2012). I'm cheating here because I constantly rewatch this cerebral spy thriller--its infectious characters, depictions of the loneliness of field intelligence work, and characterological study of betrayal make it among the finest cinematic portraits of espionage.\n\nAaron Hunt\n\nWriter\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nFisting: Never Tear Us Apart\n\nOctogod\n\nFall of the I-Hotel\n\nWhat’s Up Connection\n\nTestament\n\nIt’s Only A Movie\n\nIn the Claws of a Century Wanting\n\nPeople Power Bombshell: The Diary of Vietnam Rose\n\nTremble All You Want\n\nTomorrow’s Promise\n\nLe Cérémonie\n\nGusto Kita With All My Hypothalamus\n\na child dies, a child plays, a woman is born, a woman dies, a bird flies off\n\nO’Sangue\n\nTop of the Heap\n\nMacho Dancer\n\nAlma’s Rainbow\n\nMoral\n\nThe Moon Has Risen\n\nThe Gossips of Cicadidae\n\nDean Hurley\n\nComposer/Sound designer\n\nFirst viewings and discoveries:\n\nStraight Time (Ulu Grosbard, 1978)\n\nBlue Collar (Paul Schrader, 1978)\n\nOut for Justice (John Flynn, 1991)\n\nThe Outfit (John Flynn, 1973)\n\nSharky’s Machine (Burt Reynolds, 1981)\n\nVice Squad (Gary Sherman, 1982)\n\nRunning Cool (Beverly & Ferd Sebastian, 1993)\n\nMelvin and Howard (Jonathan Demme, 1980)\n\nQuick Change (Bill Murray & Howard Franklin, 1990)\n\nThe Crazy Rulers of the World (Jon Ronson, 2004)\n\nNiels Joaquin\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nJohnny Guitar (1954), Criterion Channel\n\nThe Player (1992), Criterion Channel\n\nBlue (1993), MoMA\n\nBelfast, Maine (1999), Metrograph\n\nFace (2009), MoMA\n\nThe Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), Criterion Channel\n\nInsiang (1976), Criterion Channel\n\nKiller of Sheep (1978), Metrograph\n\nEl Dorado (1966), MoMI\n\nPursued (1947), MoMI\n\nMy Blueberry Nights (2007), IFC\n\nThree Colors: Red (1994), FLC\n\nThe Raid (1954), MoMA\n\nMerritt K\n\nWriter\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nThe Black Cat (1934)\n\nChristine (1983)\n\nAugust in the Water (1995)\n\nJosie and the Pussycats (2001)\n\nThe Flying Luna Clipper (1987)\n\nCalifornia Split (1974)\n\nGentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n\nSpace is the Place (1974)\n\nVampire Hunter D: Bloodlust (2000)\n\nTrouble in Paradise (1932)\n\nLarry Karaszewski\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nDealing Or The Berkeley To Boston Forty Brick Lost Bag Blues\n\nWhistle Down The Wind\n\nStroszek\n\nA Special Day\n\nDesire (1936)\n\nAngel (1937)\n\nTrouble In Paradise\n\n…no Lies (1973)\n\nThe Deadly Trap\n\nTop Of The Heap\n\nThe Apple\n\nMurder In A Blue World\n\nRivals\n\nCrossfire\n\nRepeat Performance (1947)\n\nPayment Deferred (1932)\n\nThe Shiek\n\nDocks Of New York\n\nToo Much Too Soon\n\nI Walk The Line\n\nMarriage Italian Style\n\nDangerous (1935)\n\nThe Fall Of The Roman Empire\n\nGlenn Kenny\n\nCritic\n\nNew releases:\n\nArmageddon Time\n\nBoth Sides of the Blade\n\nThe Cathedral\n\nDeception\n\nDecision to Leave\n\nEmily the Criminal\n\nFlux Gourmet\n\nLux Aeterna\n\nOne Fine Morning\n\nSaloum\n\nJohn Klacsmann\n\nArtist/archivist\n\nNew releases (unranked):\n\nAnswering the Sun (Rainer Kohlberger)\n\nCrimes of the Future (David Cronenberg)\n\nEarth II (Anti-Banality Union)\n\nFunny Pages (Owen Kline)\n\nGeorge Carlin's American Dream (Judd Apatow & Michael Bonfiglio)\n\nJackass Forever (Jeff Tremaine)\n\nOutside Noise (Ted Fendt)\n\nThe Rehearsal \"The Fielder Method\" (Nathan Fielder)\n\nRiotsville, USA (Sierra Pettengill)\n\nTriangle of Sadness (Ruben Östlund)\n\nSadly, I haven’t seen All The Beauty And The Bloodshed (Laura Poitras) yet.

I need to go see EO sometime this week, so maybe this will all change, but best is hardly the word I would think to use for anything I caught in theaters. That said, Nope wins for being the most unexpectedly boring film. White Noise wins for being the film I least want to see in a theater, on a plane, in a hotel room, or in my life.\n\n2) The best movie of this year, and possibly any other, was William Klein's The Little Richard Story at Anthology. After a botched first screening that ended with a cancelled show, the only English-language subtitled 16mm print was rescheduled in the Deren theater where it stunned the packed audience and, many say, melted the screen. Made for German television, this underseen gem deserves the full Film Foundation restoration treatment. Whoever actually owns the rights needs to be cajoled into doing something about it. I deeply hope that Jake Perlin or some other intrepid Lover of Cinema will take this film on as a cause. A wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom.\n\nC. Lavender\n\nSound Designer, Film Composer, Programmer\n\nTop First Viewing + Viewing Experience: Geographies of Solitude (Mills, 2022) in the sand pit under the open sky at Rockaway Film Fest.\n\nFavorite First Viewings - Queer Cinema\n\nI watched so many deeply inspiring queer movies this year that they deserve to be highlighted in their own category!\n\nPond and Waterfall (Hammer, 15 min, 1982) - A personal highlight of the year was getting to perform a live score for this film at Rockaway Film Fest. Barbara Hammer makes you want to dive in the water with her and splash around for a bit.\n\nFlaming Ears (Puerrer, Scheirl, Schipek, 1992) - Bless the team that restored this film from very limited remaining material so that I could have my mind totally blown away by this hypersaturated lesbian sci-fi anarchic-apocalyptic world.\n\nSex, Lies, Religion (Kennerley, 6 min, 1994) - Delete the apps, meet me in the cemetery .\n\nMuscle (Satô, 1989) - Features an unauthorized Coil soundtrack, decades of obsessive love, and Pasolini worship to emerge as the Pinku-Eiga king’s most surreally touching love story.\n\nDuffer (Despins, Dumaresq,1972) - Harsh noise, poorly dubbed paranoid inner monologues, and bad choices permeate this tragically bizarre bisexual cautionary tale.\n\nNaked Killer (Fok, 1992) - Revels in the difficult to maintain energy of being offbeat and 80’s glamour shot style sexy at the same time.\n\nKamikaze Hearts (Bashore, 1986) - An energizing and powerful experimental documentary (or is it??).\n\nAsk Any Buddy (Purchell, 2020) - Pure archival queer power plunder.\n\nAnnea Lockwood / A Film About Listening (Green, 30 min, 2021) - Annea Lockwood is a musical treasure, as was her late-partner Ruth Anderson. A stunning, but too brief portrait of a brilliant mind.\n\nFavorite First Viewings - General\n\nFlux Gourmet (Strickland, 2022) - Absolutely destroys the preciousness of sound art with messy band dynamics, hydrophones in the sauce, and flanger jokes. My favorite film of 2022. Hilarious & cringe-inducing.\n\nMemoria (Weerasethakul, 2021) - As someone that’s always considering the role of sound in my personal and professional life, I wrote pages upon pages of reflection after watching “Memoria.” This is “Deep Listening” cinema.\n\nThe Appointment (Vickers, 1981) - Masterful tension and suspense with a dark fairytale narrative. One of those films that lingers with you.\n\nEyes of Fire (Crounse, 1983) - Slowburn psychedelic folk horror.\n\nThe Last Angel of History (Akomfrah, 45 min, 1996) - Insightful experimental Afrofuturism documentary featuring interviews across music/science/literature/criticism, archival footage, and dial-up era cyber graphics.\n\nDeath Powder (Izumiya, 1986) - An early entry in the Japanese cyberpunk film genre - a freaky face melter!\n\nDisgusting Spaceworms Eat Everyone!! (Keller, 1989) - Repo Man’s lo-fi feral child; featuring a raw LA industrial soundtrack, delightful use of green screen, and lots of sarcastic wit. Two exclamation marks means it’s fun!!\n\nSouthland Tales (Kelly, 2006) - \"We're a bisexual nation living in denial.”\n\nI’m No Longer Here (Fries, 2019) - A heartbreaking journey from Mexico to NYC narrated by Cumbia music.\n\nCeremonial (Monnet, 3 min, 2018) - Built upon a blend of 16mm, 8mm and digital footage; this hypnotic short explores ritual practices among Indigenous First Nation tribes in North America while maintaining their sacred privacy.\n\nThe Viewing (Cosmatos, 2022) - Visually stunning with brilliant sound design to boot.

His gee-golly-gosh style of interviewing is incredible and irreplaceable.\n\nRRR\n\nBest movie I’ve ever seen. It makes you realize how pretentious Marvel movies are.\n\nOvernight\n\nIncredible lo-fi documentary about the blowhard bartender-turned-filmmaker who made Boondocks Saints. Everyone thought he was crazy at the time for hating Harvey Weinstein.\n\nThe Card Counter\n\nThere’s an emerging trend of septuagenarian and octogenarian filmmakers making these insanely-crisp HD swan songs that make some wild stylistic decisions (see also, The Irishman and EO). Schrader’s decisions are the coolest of all (that crazy-wide Gitmo 360 camera…).\n\nLo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World\n\nI’m way too late to the Herzog game, and I just started watching everything from the newest to the oldest. I love the moment where we hear the origin of the movie's title.\n\nTramuaZone\n\nI can’t add too much to what’s already been said about this amazing series, but even if you’re not a Curtis fan, the footage alone is mind-blowing.\n\nVideos of People Playing Piano at Costco\n\nThere’s an abundance of these on YouTube. Really soothing, and makes you realize that Costco may be one of the only public forums we have left for free entertainment in the suburbs.\n\nDaybreakers\n\nUnhinged movie about a dystopian Earth where society is run by Vampires. I love the absurd world-building that includes the industrialized production of blood and cars with blacked out windows for driving during the day.\n\nTransformers: The Premake\n\nA movie that’s at least partially about how film production invades our public spaces. I think about this kind of thing when I see movies filming in my neighborhood, it’s of no benefit to us as citizens whatsoever. These films should have to feed everyone on the block for the day and pay prorated rent.\n\nEarth II\n\nThe latest installment of the Anti-Banality Union’s blockbuster collages about humanity declaring war on Earth itself.\n\nMitchell Mailloux-Glidden\n\nProjectionist/programmer/writer\n\nNew releases:\n\nBeatrix (Czernovsky, Kraxner)\n\nStars at Noon (Denis)\n\nJackass Forever (Tremaine)\n\nRRR (Rajamouli)\n\nThe African Desperate (Syms)\n\nFunny Pages (Kline)\n\nThe Girl and the Spider (Zürcher, Zürcher)\n\nThe Munsters (Zombie)\n\nOutside Noise (Fendt)\n\nBenediction (Davies)\n\nFirst viewings:\n\nDon't Play Us Cheap (Van Peebles)\n\nXCXHXEXRXRXIXEXSX (Jacobs)\n\nKuichisan (Endo)\n\nSoul City (Jones)\n\nVampires (Carpenter)\n\nSpike of Bensonhurst (Morrissey)\n\nWhoregasm (Zedd)\n\nDead and Buried (Sherman)\n\nEVENTIDE (Lockhart)\n\n1 P.M.

Both hilarious, and great cultural commentary.\n\nDeep Red - After some underwhelming experiences with Italian horror, this is the movie that made me realize that I may not be wild about their horror, I DO love giallo movies.\n\nEega - I didn’t manage to see RRR, but I did catch up with this earlier romcom/action movie from the same director, about a vengeful man reincarnated as a housefly.\n\nScream for Help - A movie that defies labels of “good” and “bad” – so many choices are “wrong,” and you’ll laugh a lot, but it’s also consistently entertaining and suspenseful.\n\nCrimes of Passion - Somehow simultaneously one of Ken Russell’s wildest and most focused films.\n\nMidsommar - If a folk horror film was… weirdly comforting?\n\nThe Cat (1992) - You will believe a space cat can fly (and also fight monsters)\n\nWe’re All Going to the World’s Fair - This went wide in 2022, but the release date says 2021, so I put it here.\n\nVideo Diary of a Lost Girl - The video store fever dream of a certain type of movie fan’s dreams.\n\nKoyaanisqatsi - Look, I recently discovered pot.\n\nThe Addiction - I’m tired of “vampirism as addiction metaphor” movies, but this is one of the earliest and best.\n\nAkira - I have no idea what happened in this movie, but it sure looks gorgeous.\n\nHappy Birthday to Me - As beautifully absurd a thriller ending as any giallo.\n\nPerfect Blue - One of the most prescient movies about celebrity ever?\n\nNo Sudden Move - Kimi got more attention of Soderburgh’s two HBO Max pandemic films, but I preferred this one. Devil in a Blue Dress meets Chinatown vibes.\n\nTenebre - Some of the showiest, most beautiful suspense shots.\n\nPossibly in Michigan - A bizarre horror (?) shot-on-video musical art film from 1983. Transfixing.\n\nRolling Thunder - Revenge movie as descent into sadness.\n\nAll that Jazz - This movie has a whole editing language all its own.\n\nThe Neon Demon - Look at this movie. It’s got (metaphorical) demons, it’s got a lot of neon… what more do you want?\n\nSteven Mears\n\nNew releases:\n\nBenediction\n\nAftersun\n\nThe Fabelmans\n\nTár\n\nThree Minutes: A Lengthening\n\nEO\n\nHappening\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nLost Illusions\n\nVortex\n\nFirst viewings and discoveries:\n\nThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg (1964)\n\nCléo from 5 to 7 (1962)\n\nThe Roads to Freedom (1970 BBC miniseries)\n\nThe Last of Sheila (1973)\n\nThe Railway Children (1970)\n\nA Tale of Winter (1992)\n\nLaugh, Clown, Laugh (1928)\n\nWhere’s Poppa?
