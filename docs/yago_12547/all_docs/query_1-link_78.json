The restorations were completed in 2019 by the Film Noir Foundation's (FNF) preservation partner, UCLA Film & Television Archive, with support provided from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's Charitable Trust (The HFPA Trust).\n\nFor veteran cinephiles, this year's Noir City is a chance to again experience cherished cinematic masterpieces in a bona fide movie palace, including several films presented in glorious 35mm. For those just starting their cinematic journey, it's the perfect introduction to a wide world of international filmmakers and stars, on the big screen, larger than life. Tour guides include some of the world's most revered filmmakers: Julien Duvivier, Jean-Pierre Melville, Jirí Weiss, Kim Ki-young, and Masahiro Shinoda.\n\nIn addition to films, trivia, and nightly prizes, we are partnering with KNKX to present the Dmitri Matheny Group on Closing Night, playing noir jazz with an international flare.\n\nStan Shields, SIFF Festival Programming Manager, says, \"We are excited to bring Noir City back to SIFF Cinema Egyptian again this year. Audiences will be treated to rare, hard-to-find noir gems, and there is no better venue to experience these powerful international contributions to film noir.\"\n\nSIFF Artistic Director Beth Barrett puts it all in perspective; \"SIFF and the Film Noir Foundation have been partnering for years to support the restoration of noir films, and bring this artistically and culturally important genre to SIFF audiences,\" adding, \"What makes this partnership so special is Eddie. Eddie Muller is our fabulous guide, giving audiences a treasure map to a cache of films that might otherwise go unseen and unappreciated.\"\n\nPasses and tickets for Noir City 2020 are on sale now, and the full schedule is available at siff.net/noir.\n\nFriday, February 14 - Thursday, February 20\n\nSIFF Cinema Egyptian\n\nFestival Passes: $150 | $100 Members\n\nIndividual Film Tickets: $15 | $10 Members | $14 Seniors and Youth\n\nNOIR CITY 2020 LINEUP\n\nFriday, February 14\n\nThe Beast Must Die | La bestia debe morir (35mm) FILM NOIR FOUNDATION RESTORATION\n\nA writer adopts a new identity to track down the hit-and-run driver who killed his son in this tense adaptation of Nicholas Blake's landmark 1936 novel.

As a focal point of the classic film noir revival, the Foundation serves as a conduit between film companies and repertory cinemas still eager to screen these films in 35mm. Revenues generated by ticket sales encourage studios film archives to strike new prints of films that are at risk of disappearing from public view, either through neglect or scarcity. Once these films are unearthed and returned to circulation, the chances exponentially increase that they will be reissued on DVD, available in pristine, affordable form for future generations of film-lovers.\n\nAbout SIFF\n\nFounded in 1976, SIFF creates experiences that bring people together to discover extraordinary films from around the world with the Seattle International Film Festival, SIFF Cinema, and SIFF Education. Recognized as one of the top film festivals in North America, the Seattle International Film Festival is the longest, most highly attended film festival in the United States, reaching more than 140,000 annually.
