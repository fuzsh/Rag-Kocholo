        "text": "For self-made millionaire Tom Newcliffe (Calvin Lockhart, WILD AT HEART), the \"most dangerous game\" is not man, it is the werewolf. He has invited five guests with strange pasts to his isolated country house for the weekend including lyncanthropy expert Dr. Lundgren (Peter Cushing, AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS), pianist Jan (Michael Gambon, THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER), disgraced medical student Paul (Tom Chadbon), former diplomat-turned-TV-host Bennington (Charles Gray, THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), and Davina (Ciaran Madden, who later co-starred with Gambon in the UK TV series version of the Maigret detective stories), a friend of Newcliffe's wife Caroline (Marlene Clark, GANJA AND HESS). With the help of security expert Pavel (Anton Driffing, FAHRENHEIT 451), Newcliffe has rigged his estate with microphones, cameras, motion detectors, and armed guards for his werewolf hunt. Can you deduce the identify of the werewolf or will the werewolf whittle down the cast before \"The Werewolf Break.\" While James Blish's novella \"There Shall Be No Darkness\" identified the werewolf in the first paragraph, Amicus has turned their adaptation into a TEN LITTLE INDIANS-style whodunit. Like the 1965 adaptation of the aforementioned Agatha Christie novel, THE BEAST MUST DIE stops for sixty seconds to offer the audience the opportunity to guess the identity of the werewolf before it is revealed. Although not really exciting or suspenseful, THE BEAST MUST DIE features a fine cast (including a game Charles Gray, the always professional Cushing, and the underrated Clark), a funky score by Douglas Gamley, a laughable werewolf, and feels strangely non-British despite the Shepperton Studios locations.\n\nADDITION: Severin Blu-ray (September 2020): Severin have also transferred Paul Annett's The Beast Must Die to a Region FREE Blu-ray. It is described as being \"from a brand new 4k scan\". Colors support Indicator's 1080P. This is on a single-layered disc and has a similar bitrate (and graph) to the Indicator. The Severin is marginally brighter and there is a slight shift down in the frame, but otherwise inconsequential differences, imo.\n\nFor audio, Severin use a 24-bit DTS-HD Master 2.0 channel dual-mono track. My ears couldn't detect much difference - maybe the Indicator had a better high-end and the Severin deeper bass response. Both offer optional English subtitles. Severin's is a Region FREE Blu-ray.\n\nFor the supplements, Severin include the same 2003 commentary (originally from the Dark Sky DVD) with director Paul Annett and writer Jonathan Sothcott. Duplicated as well is the dozen minute Directing the Beast - archival interview with director Paul Annett. I enjoyed the 19-minute audio essay by horror historian Troy Howarth entitled \"And Then There Were Werewolves\" discussing Agatha Christie, her famous \"Ten Little Indians\" (aka \"And Then There Were None\") and the many film adaptations. There is a 7-minute audio interview excerpt of Milton Subotsky on BEAST MUST DIE - interviewed by Philip Nutman and a lengthy (3/4 hour) second audio interview (also repeated and found on the Indicator) - this one with Producer Max J Rosenberg interviewed by Sothcott. The original theatrical trailer included has a delightful optional commentary by genre scholars Kim Newman and David Flint with Newman extolling the film's groundbreaking and influential characteristics - this is also an extra on the Indicator.\n\nSo the Severin's Blu-ray is Region FREE and falls short of the Indicator in the extras department (although I loved the Howarth audio essay!) I keep enjoying this film that has more layers than you might expect - especially once you give over to the 'werewolf break'. Like I state about The Beast Must Die; I, personally, consider it a keeper.\n\nADDITION: Indicator Blu-ray (June 2020): Indicator have transferred Paul Annett's The Beast Must Die to 1080P Blu-ray. It is described as being from a \"4K restoration\". Colors support the Dark Sky DVD with a greenish tinge. The 1080P is on a single-layered disc and the higher resolution exports a significantly improved image. It is much darker and shows more information in the frame and the superiority is remarkable. More the production weaknesses - but the image can be inconsistent - looking less-effective at times interspersed with crisp sharp close-ups. I'd say this was a demonstrative upgrade from bother DVDs.\n\nNOTE: We have added 62 more large resolution Blu-ray captures (in lossless PNG format) for DVDBeaver Patrons HERE\n\nOn their Blu-ray, Indicator use a linear PCM mono track (24-bit) in the original English language. It is another advancement in the film's audio effects and, not always suitable 'big-band-like', score by Douglas Gamley (Madhouse, The Land That Time Forgot, The City of the Dead, Asylum, And Now the Screaming Starts) sounding authentically flat and clean. Indicator offer optional English (SDH) subtitles on their Region 'B'-locked Blu-ray.\n\nThe Indicator Blu-ray includes the 2003 commentary from the Dark Sky DVD with director Paul Annett and writer Jonathan Sothcott. I really liked it - great to hear Annett - an affable, intelligent and easy-going chap. I found it quite a pleasant commentary as he shares his recollection of Cushing, the cast and his first film feature. There are audio interviews that play to the film with Max J. Rosenberg for 47-minutes. This is an archival audio recording from 2000 with the famed producer in conversation with Sothcott. The next is a BEHP Interview with Jack Hildyard from 1988 running the full length of the film. It is an archival audio recording, made as part of the British Entertainment History Project, featuring the Oscar-winning cinematography in conversation with Alan Lawson. There is another BEHP Interview with Peter Tanner entitled \"Part Two, 1939-1987\" running 80-minutes as part of the British Entertainment History Project, featuring the acclaimed editor in conversation with Roy Fowler and Taffy Haines. We get a short, new, introduction to the film by Stephen Laws (acclaimed horror author) showing his appreciation. Directing the Beast was also on the Dark Sky 2003 DVD running 13-minutes. Indicator has included an 18-minute Super 8 version of The Beat Must Die - a cut-down home cinema presentation. There is an extensive image gallery of publicity and promotional material and an original theatrical trailer plus Kim Newman and David Flint do a trailer commentary from 2017 - also showing appreciation for The Beats Must Die. The package has a limited edition exclusive 40-page booklet (3,000 copies) with a new essay by Neil Young, an archival article on Amicus Productions, a look at the James Blish short story which inspired the film's screenplay, an extract from the pressbook profiling actor Calvin Lockhart, an overview of contemporary critical responses, and film credits.\n\nPaul Annett's The Beast Must Die was the last horror by Amicus. After this the studio did The Land That Time Forgot (1975), At the Earth's Core (1976) and The People That Time Forgot (1977.) The Beast Must Die is a great historical 70's artifact of the genre and studio. A cracker of a werewolf-mystery - very cool on many levels. It's a film that has greatly benefitted by transfer to Blu-ray from Indicator and the extras make it a worthwhile purchase. I consider this a keeper and it definitely gets a strong recommendation!!\n\nWhile the Euroshock DVDs of AND NOW THE SCREAMING STARTS and ASYLUM were interlaced, the barebones disc of THE BEAST MUST DIE features a progressive transfer. While the 1.66:1 aspect ratio would seem to be more appropriate to the British film, Dark Sky's 1.76:1 anamorphic HD-mastered transfer reveals more picture information on the sides (with some still noticeable vertical cropping).\n\nBoth prints still have their faults which may be down to cheap processing. The colors look a bit more naturalistic on the Euroshock edition but the detail is better on the Dark Sky version (the Euroshock seems to have been sharpened) which ports over the audio commentary and featurette from the OOP Anchor Bay UK release. The Dark Sky disc is available separately (HERE) but the boxed set can be acquired for under $20.\n\n- Eric Cotenas"
