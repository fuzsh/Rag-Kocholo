[…] Film takes on certain novelty aspects in beginning as a foreword announces that “this is a detective story, and you are the detective.” Audience then is informed that all the clues will be given, and near the windup audience is asked if it can identify the werewolf from among the guests. The Max J. Rosenberg-Milton Subotsky production develops well enough after an overly-long opening that has little actually to do with the story, but explains that a fanciful closed-circuit tv network has been installed inside and out the manor house to help owner keep tabs on his guests if they should revert to animal form. Script is sometimes plodding, but generally the expected suspicions of the various guests come in for their share of plot. Michael Winder never completely makes his characters believable in his screenplay, but this may be due to the subject at hand which dwells on the old folklore legends of a person changing into a werewolf at will. Calvin Lockhart delivers creditably in the main character, and Peter Cushing is an expert on subject whose discoursing sets the stage. Marlene Clark makes an impression as the hostess. Paul Annett’s direction is usually fast and camera work by Jack Hildyard as usual is above standard. John Stoll’s art direction is a superlative plus. – from a review by Whit.\n\nBoxoffice vol.105 no.4 (6 May 1974) p.a7\n\nModern technology gives a new twist to the old werewolf legend in a British-made horror drama of rare quality. Except for minor flaws (e.g., a bit of padding, which includes a 30-second werewolf sequence not really needed), CRC’s “The Beast Must Die” is superior film fare. […] Old reliable Peter Cushing gives his usual effective performance, gaining whatever sympathy is due this odd assortment and neatly contrasting Lockhart’s very mannered interpretation. […] Director Paul Annett switches from British TV action fare to the wide screen for an impressive debut. – from an uncredited review\n\nThe Independent Film Journal vol.73 no.12 (15 May 1974) p.21\n\nThe venerable werewolf, baring its fangs on screen every few full moons or so, is back on the contemporary scene again in The Beast Must Die, although this time the fabled creature serves more as the source for one of those “one-of-us-is-a-murderer” mystery plots than as a staple of sheer terror. Amicus productions, whose stable of past successes includes some of the gorier anthology films (Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror, etc.) has toned down the bloodletting here and opted for strict, old-fashioned whodunnitry, which may work against audiences whose tastes lie along more shuddery lines. Still, a relatively tight screenplay by Michael Winder should provide audiences willing to puzzle out the identity of the werewolf with an involving enough tale, even though a gimmicky framework casts a somewhat juvenile tint over the proceedings. […] Paul Annet’s [sic] direction is surest when focused on the seemingly guilty and in scenes like one in which a table-full of people undergo several of Cushing’s sure-fire vampire tests, summoning up a good deal of tension but no positive results. Performances are pretty good throughout, although Cushing’s broadly accented portrayal of the Teutonic vampire expert indicates he didn’t take the proceedings too seriously. Production values, particularly in a couple of long-winded, outdoor chase sequences, are not up to Amicus’ usual classiness.\n\nReferences\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBoxoffice vol.105 no.4 (6 May 1974) p.a7 – review (author not credited)\n\nCastle of Frankenstein no.23 p.52\n\nCinefantastique vol.4 no.4 (Winter 1976) p.31 – review\n\nCinemaTV Today no.10041 (21 July 1973) p.11 – credits\n\nCinemaTV Today no.10045 (18 August 1973) p.10 – note\n\nCinemaTV Today no.10047 (1 September 1973) p.8 – note (Titles change); credits (In production)\n\nCinemaTV Today no.10081 (4 May 1974) p.12 – review\n\nEmpire June 1999 p.150 – review (by Kim Newman)\n\nFlesh and Blood no.3 (1994) p.44 – illustrated credits, review\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter vol.229 no.22 (21 December 1973) p.14 – credits\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter vol.231 no.7 (24 April 1974) p.3 – review\n\nThe Independent Film Journal vol.73 no.12 (15 May 1974) p.21 – credits, review (Buying & booking guide, author not credited)\n\nMonthly Film Bulletin vol.61 no.485 (June 1974) pp.119-120 – credits, synopsis, review (by Vera Glaessner)\n\nNew Musical Express 30 August 1980 p.33 – review (On the box)\n\nRadio Times vol.248 no.3246 (8 February 1986) p.27 – review\n\nScary Monsters no.114 (Fall 2019) pp.64-66 – illustrated article (A journey into hair-raising horror, with your guide Peter Cushing by Kevin Nickelson)\n\nVariety vol.274 no.11 (24 April 1974) pp.18, 22 – credits, review (by Whit)\n\nBooks"
