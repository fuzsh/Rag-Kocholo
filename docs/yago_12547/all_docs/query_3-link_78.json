But here goes, anyway…\n\nAntebellum (Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz 2020), set on a slave plantation during the Civil War, opens with a long tracking shot that culminates in the beating of a captured runaway and the fatal shooting of another. For the next half hour, the often poorly-scripted film wallows in images ‘enact[ing] black suffering for a shocked and titillated audience’,[1] but with little of the insidious visual artistry of the always picturesque and thus superficially more palatable 12 Years A Slave (Steve McQueen 2013). (That said, it does contain three striking shots: the long opening tracking shot through the plantation; the final shot of the abduction sequence as the other Uber carrying Veronica’s friends passes and turns away; the closing slow-motion shots of an axe-wielding Eden, riding on horseback through Confederate lines.)\n\nAs with Don’t Worry Darling and Barbie, something is clearly amiss in this fictional world. Is it just budgetary constraints that make the cotton field so small, the slaves’ labour in it so unhurried? Why are the slaves forbidden to speak? Did Confederate soldiers really run ‘reform’ plantations, or chant about ‘blood and soil’?\n\nThe illusion of this world breaks definitively when Him (Eric Lange), the confederate officer who repeatedly rapes Eden (Janelle Monáe), receives a call on his hitherto concealed cell phone.\n\nIs this an alternate history, like CSA: The Confederate States of America (Willmott 2004)?\n\nA time-travel story, like Sankofa (Gerima 1993) or Octavia Butler’s Kindred (1979)?\n\nSpoiler alert: no.\n\nThe middle section of the film follows celebrity scholar–activist Veronica (Janelle Monáe). Away from home promoting her latest book, she is abducted by white supremacists and transported to the plantation from the opening section of the film – which exists in the present, adjacent to a Civil War theme park and battle re-enactment site, owned by Senator Denton (Eric Lange). There, carefully targeted and abducted Black people are forced into the role of slaves, so white supremacists can play at being Confederate soldiers and, unhindered, visit racist and sexual violence upon them.\n\nIn the final section of the film, Eden/Veronica orchestrates her escape, taking murderous revenge on her captors and bringing in police and FBI to shut the place down.\n\nOften clumsy, Antebellum attempts to address the way America’s racial history continues to play out in the present. Perhaps its sole innovation, whether intentional or not, is in the first section to position the audience to sympathise with the slave characters, but then in the second section to depict Veronica, and her friend Dawn (Gaborey Sidibe), as (at least potentially) really irritating characters.\n\nVeronica’s relentlessly bourgeois life – fabulous fashion, sentimental motherhood – helps to normalise the image of Black people being wealthy and middle class, something with which microaggressive minor white characters – a concierge, a waitress – are disgruntled. But it also really drives home how her avowed Black intersectional feminism, which consists of shallow clichés and therapeutic affirmations, has a major blind spot: she mentions ‘class, race and gender’ but (surprise!) class is completely absent from anything she says or does.\n\nDawn is self-consciously loud, quick to express appetite and desire and – in contrast to Veronica – to put down microaggressions. But she sails awfully close to the stereotype of a pushy Black woman.\n\nThe two women’s different kinds of outspoken-ness (or perhaps merely spoken-ness) is clearly intended to contrast with the silence and (performance of) subservience forced upon the ‘slaves’ in the face of macro-aggressions.\n\nSome audiences will rejoice in the depiction of such strong Black women; others will accept them as comic exaggerations intended to drive home the film’s admittedly unsubtle point. And, of course, while it is not incumbent on filmmakers to present uncomplicatedly positive images of Black women, other audiences will find Veronica and Dawn considerably less sympathetic than Eden and the other the slave characters.\n\nIt is for this last group that the film presents the greatest challenge: it does not matter what Veronica and Dawn are like, it does not matter whether you sympathise/identify with them or not. Nothing can validate this slavery re-enactment or, more importantly, slavery itself and its ongoing legacies.\n\nBut in that uncertain zone of (potential) irritation, one must face up to the possibility/extent that one’s negative response to these Black middle class women is in some way structured by racism and sexism.\n\n[1] Weheliye, Alexander G. Habeas Viscus: Racializing Assemblages, Biopolitics, and Black Feminist Theories of the Human. Duke UP, 2014. 90\n\nDrafting an essay on contemporary dystopian cinema 1: 65 (Beck and Woods 2023)\n\nThe sense of relative privilege is perhaps nowhere clearer than in contemporary retrotopian tendencies, since such evocations of mythical pasts as models of utopian futures hinge upon hierarchical differences of class, race and gender. Zygmunt Bauman[1] identifies four interwoven tendencies in contemporary real-world politics which offer some kind of utopian sensation by focusing on (1) tribalism, which can mediate between the individual and wider forces in a world imagined as a (2) Hobbesian war of all against all while also offering some kind of (3) return-to-the-womb consolation, even if it means (4) perpetuating, reinforcing and increasing existing inequalities.\n\nDon’t Worry Darling (Olivia Wilde 2022) appears initially to be set in the Victory Project, a wealthy 1950s American suburb, moderately and monogamously debauched, given over to libidinal–consumerist pleasures and rigid gender roles.\n\nSomething is clearly amiss, though. The world is too brightly lit, the colours too vibrant, to be true. The houses are show-home immaculate; every surface gleams or invites sensuous tactility. The women are too content as housewives, and their husbands too prompt to initiate and perform expert cunnilingus. There is no trace of discontent, of restriction, of suffocation. It is as if Betty Friedan never existed, as if the feminine mystique were true.\n\nAlso, the setting is (slightly) more ethnically diverse than it would actually have been, with suburbanites of Asian, African American and Jewish descent in supporting and background roles.\n\nIt is the dream image of the white suburban 1950s – that ‘emblem of happier times, when family values and small-town American were concrete manifestations of the triumph of capitalism and the “end of ideology”’ – but adjusted to take some account of the period’s ‘repressed [racial, patriarchal and sexual, but never class] realities’[2] and of more contemporary blandly middle-of-the-road liberal sensibilities.\n\nIn this way, Don’t Worry Darling ‘calcifies the current state of affairs in America and presents it as a future that we should be excited for’, as Clark Seanor writes of Becky Chambers’s Wayfarers series of novels (2014–21), and it is not alone in doing so. For example, Barbie (Greta Gerwig 2023) surrounds stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) with ethnically diverse, albeit mostly light-skinned, Barbies and signals a queer presence in the-sexless-because-they-have-no-genitals Barbieland through Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) and Allan (Michael Cera); the Kens are similarly diverse.\n\nMoreover, Barbie is careful to put the key speech about ‘the cognitive dissonance required to be a woman under the patriarchy’ into the mouth of Gloria, played by America Ferrara, a Honduran American with Indigenous (Lenca) ancestry. Powerful and affecting as her delivery is, the speech is cast in terms so broad and vague as to seem inclusive, but really just (once more) presents white bourgeois liberal feminist plaints as if they are universal. There is no sense of women’s differential material experiences of patriarchal (and other intersecting) systems of oppression. Gloria’s daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) is right to dub stereotypical Barbie ‘white saviour Barbie’, even if she demurs in favour of Sasha’s mother who just delivered the speech and thus found a way to deprogram the other Barbies, who’ve been brainwashed into subservience through the Kens’ plot to institute patriarchy in Barbieland (‘It’s like I’ve been in a dream where I was really invested in the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League’).\n\nJust as Barbie begins to realise something is rotten in the state of Barbieland when she wakes up tired and headachey with bad breath and ‘irrepressible thoughts of death’, to a cold shower, a burnt waffle, milk that’s gone off, gravity, flat feet and traces of cellulite, so Alice (Florence Pugh), the protagonist of Don’t Worry Darling, begins to experience glitches in the Matrix. There are flashes of traumatic images within the glossy Victory Project and from the desert outside; brief moments of anamnesis, coded through lighting, colour and design to suggest some other locale, but always in close-ups that to deny Alice (and the viewer) sufficient information to make sense of them; and black-and-white glimpses of corseted dancers, choreographed in some eerie Busby Berkeley-style reduction of women to interchangeable elements in a machine. Moments of crisis end unresolved, with Alice waking up later and elsewhere, not knowing how she got there and uncertain about the reality of what she witnessed. When she is distracted by a stubborn speck of dirt on the window she is cleaning, the wall behind glides forward to crush her against the glass; and in the film’s most Phildickian moment, she opens a box of eggs only to discover that each one is just an empty shell.\n\nShe is, of course, in a virtual world.\n\nIn real reality, Alice is an overworked surgeon, even more exhausted than usual from having to take on additional shifts since her husband lost his job. Jack (Harry Styles) whines about how Alice, who is constantly working, neglects him and their relationship, and has no luck finding employment – but he is drawn to the ‘philosophy’ of Frank (Chris Pine), an online tech-millionaire guru partly based on Jordan Peterson. Without Alice’s knowledge or consent, he signs them up to the real Victory Project, which inserts them both into the virtual world and suppresses her memories and identity to prevent her from realising the truth. In exchange, when Jack and the other husbands head off to their top-secret engineering work every day, they actually exit the virtual world for jobs in the real work that pay enough to sustain their illusory existence (the details of this are unclear, but it looks a lot like the indentured servitude Elon Musk seems to have in mind for his Martian colonists).\n\nIn the virtual world, variations in costume design and the mid-century modern architecture and décor emphasise, although less overtly than the wryly synchronised departure of husbands for work each morning, superficial differences within uniformity. This can probably be extended to variations in ethnicity, body shape and so on; like Barbie, Don’t Worry Darling often seems to intersectionality-wash cherry-picked elements of second-wave and post-feminist liberal feminisms; like Barbie, it possesses no actual vision.\n\nThis is not, however, to dismiss the significance of these movies, whether they flop (Don’t Worry Darling took $87.6 million off a $35 million budget) or are global blockbusters (Barbie took $.144 billion off a $145 million budget, the biggest domestic, foreign and worldwide box-office of the year). The outraged responses to such films indicate the extent to which the anti-feminist backlash, often tied to ethnonationalism, is entrenched in mainstream political and alt-victimhood[3] discourses, and thus the extent to which even such modest acts of liberal feminism (Alice is often barefoot, her friend Peg (Kate Berlant) continually pregnant) and anti-racism are necessary portals to a better world.\n\nDrafting an essay on contemporary dystopian cinema 3: Antebellum (Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz 2020)\n\n[1] In his rather mediocre Retrotopia.

Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Utopian Imagination. Ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan, Routledge, 2003. 155–166. 163.\n\n[3] See David M. Higgins’s rather good book, Reverse Colonization: Science Fiction, Imperial Fantasy and Alt-Victimhood. University of Iowa Press, 2021.\n\nI’ve been using the last couple of days of our Cornish holiday, after Andrea abandoned me for work, trying to make some progress on an essay on contemporary dystopian cinema, which is due in ten days time. I still only have the vaguest sense of what I want to say, my books are 150 miles away, and the notes I took from them in December are either uninspiring or make no real sense to me now. So I’ve switched things up and started rewatching the films to see what they say to me – and as an extra incentive to actually write things down, I thought I’d begin posting draft sections here. I have no idea which of them will make it into the final version, or in what condition.\n\nLet’s begin with 65 (Beck and Woods 2023), Adam Driver’s addition to the humans-versus-dinosaurs canon, which still lacks a definitive film (mainly because Hammer never actually made Zeppelins vs. Pterodactyls).\n\n‘Prior to the advent of mankind’, the opening of 65 (Beck and Woods 2023) tells us, as a disembodied viewpoint drifts through gaseous computer-generated nebulae and past bright revolving galaxies, ‘in the infinity of space other civilizations explored the heavens’.\n\nHowever, having established the magnitude of space and the depths of cosmic time, the film promptly gives way to statistical absurdity: an alien spaceship returning from a long-range exploratory mission collides with the debris around the K-T asteroid and crashlands on Earth two days before the extinction-level impact will occur.\n\nAnd if that is not sufficiently improbable, two survivors evade numerous dinosaurs and other perils as they locate the other half of the wreckage, which contains an undamaged escape vessel, and launch themselves back into space even as the asteroid is entering the atmosphere.\n\nEven more absurd than this, though, is the film’s premise that on the planet Somaris, over 65 million years ago, a species evolved that is in every respect identical to middle class North American human beings. No physiological element distinguishes them from humans, and they have no distinctively alien social structure or culture. Their technology, while more advanced than our own, fits within the paradigms of contemporary design or a conventional near-future imaginary. Their emotional lives consist of an utterly familiar affective repertoire. They form monogamous nuclear families, with the gendered and generational dynamics, repressed tensions, beach holidays and comfortable-but-stylish casualwear one expects of a liberal, middle-class family. As a spaceship pilot, Mills (Adam Driver) is often away from home for up to six weeks at a time, but he nonetheless enjoys a special relationship with Nevine (Chloe Coleman), his daughter. (His wife, who is Black, is merely credited as Nevine’s Mom (Nika King)).\n\nHowever, Nevine is sick with one of those never-actually-named debilitating movie diseases that, if untreated, is fatal. And since Somaris has evolved not only a species of fantastical bourgeois Americans but also a US-style healthcare system and a gig economy that now includes spaceship pilots, Mills must sign up to pilot a long-range mission that will take him away from home for two years to pay for Nevine’s expensive treatment.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that distinguishes these non-humans, with their capitalism, patriarchy and reproductive heteronomativity, from actually-existing suburban Americans, with their capitalism, patriarchy and reproductive heteronomativity, is that aliens’ holiday beach has unusual giant rock formations that look like fossilised wave crests.\n\nIf, as XXX suggests, ‘all sf falls between the poles of utopia and dystopia’ (find this fucking quote), what is one to make of such sf films as 65, which lack both hope and vision and anger and despair, and display no trace of sociopolitical world-building beyond lazily reiterating the present?\n\nWhat is one to do with such a fundamentally symptomatic text that braids together elements of the dystopian world in which we live, albeit without any discernible dystopian inflection, with an extinction-level event akin to the one through which we are living, but also separating them out (bourgeois aliens live on one world, extinction descends upon another) so as to deny the causal links between, and culpability of, actually-existing socioeconomic systems and global catastrophe?\n\nGiven such blankness, such mutually cancelling contradictions that somehow sidestep the commonplace that one man’s utopia is another man’s dystopia, how can such a text be positioned between utopia and dystopia?\n\nTo treat it as utopian is to accept some Fukuyaman vision of neoliberal hegemony as not just the end of history, but the all of history; to admit that the best we can imagine is just more of the endless same.\n\nTo treat it as dystopian is to move beyond the superficial appearances that distinguish it from the polluted trashworld of, say, Blade Runner 2049 (Villeneuve 2017), and to accept the worst that we can imagine is just more of the endless same.\n\nBut 65 has no discernible interest in either of those possibilities, nor in any admixture of two.\n\nDrafting an essay on contemporary dystopian cinema 2: Don’t Worry Darling (Wilde 2022) with some Barbie (Gerwig 2023)\n\nSomeone asked how many of the 403 films I watched in 2023 I saw on the big screen. Off the top of my head, I would have guessed closer to 30 than 20, but much fewer than usual since at the end of 2022 we moved from Bristol to a small Welsh village with a train station but not much else, and certainly not a cinema.\n\nThere is a multiplex a few miles away in the Newport retail park, but being dependent on public transport, the only way to get there is an hourly bus which stops there 55 minutes before the film starts and departs 5 minutes before the end credits roll. Every fucking time.\n\nSo in the face of such first world problems, we’ve stayed Bristol-oriented. Fortunately my commute is on the same line and costs the same as travelling to the city centre, with no restriction on breaking the journey partway to put in my hours inspecting the pipe at the piss factory, so I’ve made use of that a few times this year (and of my customary picket line being near the Watershed and about ten minutes from the Odeon).\n\nAnd it turns out, the answer is actually 60 films on the big screen (although not always in cinemas), with 21 of them over the five days I spent at the Cinema Rediscovered and Forbidden Worlds festivals. (I’ve written about falling in love with cinema, rather than just film, here; if you scroll down you can listen to me reading about falling in love with cinema, rather than just film, aloud.)\n\nIt was a hard year for cinemas. Audiences are still nowhere near pre-Covid levels, Bristol lost two of its five multiplexes (including the only cinema in the south of the city), and the Watershed took a funding hit. But there wass still an awful lot going on: festivals (although I didn’t manage to get to anything at Afrika Eye, Encounters, Bristol Radical Film Festival or Bristol Palestine Film Festival, and only one film at Slapstick) and screenings organised by the good folks at 20th Century Flicks, Cary Grant Comes Home, Film Noir UK, Horror Without End and Southwest Silents, among others).\n\nCinemas, festival, screening organisations, pop-up events are precious and we should cherish them. I mean, just look at the range of stuff I did manage to get to (I promise I’ll stop just posting lists soon):\n\nSalomé (Charles Bryant and Alla Nazimova 1922) – with live accompaniment\n\nDer letzte Mann/The Last Laugh (F.W. Murnau 1924) – with live accompaniment\n\nPapirosnitsa of Mosselproma/The Cigarette Girl of Mosselprom (Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky 1924) – with live accompaniment\n\nBeverly of Graustark (Sidney Franklin 1926) – most uncomfortable seats\n\nAsphalt (Joe May 1929) – with live accompaniment\n\nTange Sazen yowa: Hyakuan ryô no tsubo/The Million Ryo Pot (Sadao Yamanaka 1935)\n\nMeshes of the Afternoon (Maya Deren 1943)\n\nScarlet Street (Fritz Lang 1945)\n\nWanted for Murder (Lawrence Huntington 1946)\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre (John Huston 1948) – highest cost/lowest quality one-off screening, but it was in a fancy old wine cellar with a fancy glass of red included\n\nThe Third Man (Carol Reed 1949) – IMAX\n\nThe Sound of Fury (Cy Endfield 1950)\n\nBeware, My Lovely (Harry Horner 1952)\n\nInvaders from Mars (William Cameron Menzies 1953) – IMAX\n\n20000 Leagues under the Sea (Richard Fleischer 1954) – in London\n\nYield to the Night (J.

Warren 1977) – IMAX\n\nVictor/Victoria (Blake Edwards 1982) – most uncomfortable seating but we’d learned from the earlier screening of Beverly of Graustark and managed to get in the front row so we could at least stretch our legs out\n\nWarGames (John Badham 1983) – IMAX; I introduced this one despite being ill – too ill, in fact, to stick around for the second half of the double bill, which was a shame cos there’s no way seeing Threads (Mick Jackson 1984) on an IMAX screen could have made me feel worse, surely?\n\nAfter Hours (Martin Scorsese 1985) – IMAX; I introduced this one, which was pretty weird since I’m no fan of Scorsese, but at least I managed to make an increasingly baffled and angry audience applaud Teri Garr\n\nNight of the Creeps (Fred Dekker 1986) – IMAX\n\nSomething Wild (Jonathan Demme 1986) – IMAX; I introduced this one before introducing After Hours and it was lot smoother ride for everyone involved\n\nWong ga jin si/Royal Warriors (David Chung 1986) – IMAX\n\nSalvation (Beth B 1987)\n\nDie Hard (John McTiernan 1988) – in Plymouth\n\nOne Hand Don’t Clap (Kavery Dutta Kaul 1988)\n\nCyborg (Albert Pyun 1989) – I introduced this one, too, suggesting that I am now Bristol’s go-to guy for reminding people how fucked up and weird (and shit) the 1980s were\n\nGremlins 2: The New Batch (Joe Dante 1990) – IMAX\n\nSzürkület/Twilight (György Fehér 1990)\n\nGing Chaat goo si III: chiu kup gin chat/Police Story 3: Supercop (Stanley Tong 1992) – IMAX\n\nBeurokeo/Broker (Hirokazu Koreeda 2022)\n\nEnys Men (Mark Jenkin 2022)\n\nR.M.N.

Movie (Aaaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic and Pierre Leduc 2023)\n\nSecond, my top 3 films released in the UK in 2023, in joint first place.\n\nGodzilla Minus One (Takashi Yamazaki 2023)\n\nFallen Leaves (Aki Kaurismäki 2023)\n\nA Dog Called Discord (Mark Jenkin 2023)\n\nI also enjoyed, in roughly this order:\n\nPolite Society (Nida Manzoor 2023)\n\nSisu (Jalmari Helander 2022)\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Power and Justin K Thompson 2023)\n\nEnys Men (Mark Jenkin 2022)\n\nInfinity Pool (Brandon Cronenberg 2023)\n\nPearl (Ti West 2022)\n\nMeg 2: The Trench (Ben Wheatley 2023)\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig 2023)\n\nThe Marvels (Nia DaCosta 2023)\n\nJohn Wick Chapter 4 (Chad Stahelski 2023)\n\nPathaan (Siddharth Anand 2023)\n\nFast X (Louis Letterier 2023)\n\nSmoking Causes Coughing (Quentin Dupieux 2022)\n\nI am still not sure if I enjoyed R.M.N. (Cristian Mungiu 2022) or if ‘enjoyed’ could ever be the right word for it.\n\nThird, my top 32 films I saw for the first time in 2023, in order of release:\n\nPoil de carotte/Carrot Top (Julien Duvivier 1932)\n\nThe Sound of Fury (Cy Endfield 1950)\n\nThe Tall T (Budd Boetticher 1957)\n\nThe Human Condition trilogy (Masaki Kobayashi 1959–61)\n\nFight, Zatoichi, Fight (Kenji Misumi 1964)\n\nRed Beard (Akira Kurosawa 1965)\n\nBushman (David Schikele 1971)\n\nFear Eats the Soul (Rainer Werner Fassbinder 1974)\n\nThe Tree of Wooden Clogs (Ermanno Olmi 1978)\n\nDirty Ho (Chia-Liang Liu 1979)\n\nThe Magnificent Butcher (Yuen Woo-Ping 1979)\n\nNorma Rae (Martin Ritt 1979)\n\nVagabond (Agnès Varda 1985)\n\nRoyal Warriors (David Chung 1986)\n\nOne Hand Don’t Clap (Kavery Dutta Kaul 1988)\n\nTwilight (György Fehér 1990)\n\nDrylongso (Cauleen Smith 1998)\n\nLes glaneurs et la glaneuse/The Gleaners and I (Agnès Varda 2000)\n\nI Wish (Hirokazu Kore-eda 2011)\n\nJourney to the Shore (Kiyoshi Kurosawa 2015)\n\nOur Little Sister (Hirokazu Kore-eda 2015)\n\nBefore We Vanish (Kiyoshi Kurosawa 2017)\n\nDecision to Leave (Park Chan-wook 2022)\n\nGodzilla Minus One (Takashi Yamazaki 2023)\n\nFallen Leaves (Aki Kaurismäki 2023)\n\nA Dog Called Discord (Mark Jenkin 2023)\n\nSisu (Jalmari Helander 2022)\n\nPolite Society (Nida Manzoor 2023)\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Power and Justin K Thompson 2023)\n\nEnys Men (Mark Jenkin 2022)\n\nInfinity Pool (Brandon Cronenberg 2023)\n\nPearl (Ti West 2022)\n\nFourth, for anyone not yet bored out their mind by my lists, the complete list of 403 titles:\n\n21 Jump Street (Phil Lord and Chris Miller 2012)\n\n22 Jump Street (Phil Lord and Chris Miller 2014)\n\n65 (Scott Beck and Bryan Woods 2023)\n\n65 (Scott Beck and Bryan Woods 2023)\n\n20000 Leagues under the Sea (Richard Fleischer 1954)\n\nAfter Hours (Martin Scorsese 1985)\n\nAfter Hours (Martin Scorsese 1985)\n\nAftersun (Charlotte Wells 2022)\n\nAfter the Fox (Vittorio De Sica 1966)\n\nAkahige/Red Beard (Akira Kurosawa 1965)\n\nL’albero degle zoccoli/The Tree of Wooden Clogs (Ermanno Olmi 1978)*\n\nAlien (Ridley Scott 1979)\n\nAmazing Grace (Alan Elliott and Sydney Pollack 2018)\n\nAmbulance (Michael Bay 2022)\n\nAngst essen Seele auf/Fear Eats the Soul (Rainer Werner Fassbinder 1974)\n\nAnna (Luc Besson 2019)\n\nAntlers (Scott Cooper 2021)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (Peyton Reed 2023)\n\nAsphalt (Joe May 1929)\n\nAssault on Precinct 13 (John Carpenter 1976)\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water (James Cameron 2022)\n\nBabylon 5: The Road Home (Matt Peters 2023)\n\nBad Boys (Michael Bay 1995)\n\nBait (Mark Jenkin 2019)\n\nBait (Mark Jenkin 2019)\n\nThe Bank Job (Roger Donaldson 2008)\n\nBarbara (Christian Petzold 2012)\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig 2023)\n\nBarbie (Greta Gerwig 2023)\n\nBeast (Baltasar Kormákur 2022)\n\nBeing John Malkovich (Spike Jonze 1999)\n\nBelle (Amma Asante 2013)\n\nBeurokeo/Broker (Hirokazu Kore-eda 2022)\n\nBeverly of Graustark (Sidney Franklin 1926)\n\nBeware, My Lovely (Harry Horner 1952)\n\nThe Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings (John Badham 1976)\n\nBlack Adam (Jaime Collet-Serra 2022)\n\nBlackboard Jungle (Richard Brooks 1955)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (Ryan Coogler 2022)\n\nThe Black Phone (Scott Derickson 2021)\n\nBlade Runner 2049 (Denis Villeneuve 2017)\n\nBlue Valentine (Derek Cianfrance 2010)\n\nBodies Bodies Bodies (Halina Reijn 2022)\n\nBoogie Nights (Paul Thomas Anderson 1997)\n\nBorn in Flames (Lizzie Borde 1983)\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s (Blake Edwards 1961)\n\nBroken Flowers (Jim Jarmusch 2005)\n\nBuchanan Rides Alone (Budd Boetticher 1958)\n\nBullet Train (David Leitch 2022)\n\nBushman (David Schikele 1971)\n\nCall Me By Your Name (Luca Guadagnino 2017)\n\nThe Cameraman (Edward Sedgwick and Buster Keaton 1928)\n\nCan que/Crippled Avengers (Cheh Chang 1978)\n\nChiu kup gai wak/Project S/Supercop 2 (Stanley Tong 1993)\n\nCiao maschio/Bye Bye Monkey (Marco Ferreri 1978)\n\nClash of the Titans (Desmond Davis 1981)\n\nLa classes operaia va in paridiso/The Working Class Goes to Heaven (Elio Petri 1971)\n\nClimbing High (Carol Reed 1938)\n\nCocaine Bear (Elizabeth Banks 2023)\n\nCoffy (Jack Hill 1973)\n\nComanche Station (Budd Boetticher 1960)\n\nCommando (Mark L.

Ignore the credits and it’s down to 95-100 minutes so there’s relatively little bloat (the accompanying DCEU Aquaman trailer was subjectively longer) and no room for absurd portentousness around inevitable magical objects. (I assume this is partly Disney-panic about female-led cast-of colour movie’s opening weekend – a shorter run-time means cramming in more screenings.)\n\nIt treats the typical MCU diagrammatic plotting with the contempt it deserves (that too might be a consequence of shortening the runtime for above reasons but its nonetheless nice to see the perfunctory treated so perfunctorily).\n\nIt decentres the ultra-white saviour protagonist it’s stuck with (not dissing Brie Larson) as much as possible with two other Marvels of colour (Kamala Khan and family way more important this month than Nia DaCosta et al could have imagined).\n\nQuietly and unspectacularly, it has a cast of colour with I think just two even remotely significant speaking roles for white actors (one buried under alien makeup).\n\nIt almost makes up for having to lose Cap’s dyke haircut by giving her a moment with Valkyrie (but for god’s sake, Feige, just let them come out).\n\nAdmits ‘humanitarian intervention’ was colonial crime.\n\nReplaces Hawkeye.\n\nDouble Dutch skipping as utopian joy.\n\nA surfeit of kittens my partner knew nothing about in advance (and which she claims was also a sequence of utopian joy).\n\nOn the downside:\n\nIt resolves the colonial crime through a further ‘humanitarian intervention’ cos whitey knows best.\n\nOngoing deterioration of effects work.\n\nInevitable opening of a multiverse breach to let yet more IP in (really wish they’d recast the voice actor)."
