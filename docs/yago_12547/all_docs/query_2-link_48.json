        "text": "Industry\n\nTwo HFPA-Restored Movies Open Noir Film Festival\n\ncolor:black’> is based on a novel by Irish poet and mystery writer Cecil Day-Lewis (writing under his Nicholas Blake pen name) the father of actor Daniel Day-Lewis, eight time-nominee and twice Golden Globe winner.\n\nFNF archives\n\ncolor:black’> is based on Fritz Lang’s 1931 film M‘. It is the second remake (after Joseph Losey’s 1951 version, shot on location in downtown Los Angeles), but this time it was written from a woman’s point of view: It stars the beautiful Olga Zubarry, known as The Argentinian Marilyn Monroe, who plays a cabaret singer trying to protect her young daughter from a mysterious would-be pedophile murderer. At the same time, she has to parry the advances of the prosecutor who is pursuing the killer. The script, Muller explained, ‘is a proto-feminist reimagining of M‘, focusing on female characters who were ignored in the earlier films…. a major rediscovery and now a pristine digital restoration, which should lead to a worldwide reappraisal of the films of writer-director Román Viñoly Barreto.’\n\nmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";color:black’>America doesn’t hold a monopoly on swaggering gangsters, larcenous lovers, surly ex-cons, corrupt cops, and scheming femmes fatales. On this year’s cinematic sojourn, you’ll (see) more than enough style to fill up any existential void. I hope you find life-changing movies here. This is definitely the way to meet them: larger than life, restored, on the big screen. Now, more than ever, it’s essential to resist the dread and paranoia of contemporary times by looking beyond our differences. Let’s appreciate the noir ethos for the creativity it inspires and the warning flares it long ago flashed on screens worldwide. Noir has no national boundaries. It’s the same story, everywhere.’"
