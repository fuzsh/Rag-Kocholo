        "text": "I knew Flicker Alley had restored this, so I was anxious to see it. It's an Argentine film based on a novel about a crime novelist widower whose young son is the center of his world. When the boy is killed by a hit and run driver - and worse he could have been saved if the driver had stopped and gotten help - he goes on his own search to find the killer and kill him himself. But all of his trails go cold. And then, in a really fantastic and unbelievable turn, he gets a lead. And I'll just leave specifics of the plot at that.\n\nThe original novel, according to Eddie Muller on TCM's Noir Alley, had the diary of the avenging father first, and what turns into a murder mystery later. How do you adapt that to film? I think it was done quite artfully. The acting, especially of the two child actors, was well done and the production values are quite high. There were a few things that were surprises to me. Apparently in 1952 Argentina it was considered an intrusion to stop a man from beating his wife? And there was some Christian symbolism, especially at the end, that seemed rather odd.\n\nI will say one bad thing about the restoration. The picture and sound are wonderful, but the English subtitles are white. Thus there are lots of times, when they are superimposed on a light image, that they are difficult or impossible to read. And dialogue is a big part of this film. Still I'd recommend it as something you'd never see coming out of the American studio system of the same year.\n\nNarciso Ibáñez Menta is the widowed father of a son. Although a mathematician, since the death of his wife, he has made his living by writing pulpy mysteries under a pseudonym. When the boy is killed in a traffic accident, he plots the driver's death.... and the driver dies by poison. Menta has a perfect alibi.\n\nThe first adaptation of Cecil Day Lewis' novel shows some interesting parallels to Day Lewis' life, although he was not, so far as I can tell, implicated in a murder. The distinguished poet, who became the Laureate in 1968 wrote mysteries under the pseudonym of 'Nicholas Blake. The movie is a clear film noir, with lots of foggy night scenes and a major flashback, visually interesting and with a nice degree of sexual heat running through it, that Chabrol's later version muted.\n\nI caught this on TCM's Noir Alley with Eddie Muller, thanks to its restoration. What an entertaining film all around. This movie is one of those examples of when every aspect comes together for a cohesive offering.\n\nThe story is cool, enough so it's been remade not only into a French film but also into a British TV series, neither of which I've seen. The direction and editing are superb. The acting is genuine. The cinematography, music, costuming, makeup, lighting, etc., all blend together quite seamlessly.\n\nI agree with the reviewer mentioning the subtitles being difficult to impossible to read during certain frames. After a while, I simply had to rewind to try to discern what the words were or just plain \"let it go\" and try my best to figure it out by context.\n\nAlthough I would classify this is a must for die-hard noir fans, I would highly recommend it to someone who either likes foreign film or, well, just a darn good film!"
