        "text": "There’s an ineffable quality to Kansas Bowling and her films that I’m simply not smart nor talented enough to describe. At 26 she’s already directed two feature length films–the first, B.C. BUTCHER, she made as a teenager for the legendary Troma Films, and the second, CUDDLY TOYS, is a truly underground smash that took years to get distribution because people were afraid to release.\n\nYou know you’re doing something right when people are legitimately afraid to be associated with your art.\n\nShe’s made tons of music videos for such diverse acts as Papa M, The Death Valley Girls, Surfbort, and Chicago’s own James Marlon Magas. She’s acted in movies directed by Quentin Tarantino and Glenn Danzig. She starred in a couple music videos for The Killers. She got Iggy Pop to eat a cheeseburger on film as an homage to Andy Warhol. She did this interview in the parking lot of a casino on a short break between gambling sessions.\n\nI’m in my 40s, so I know that I probably have no idea what is cool these days.\n\nBut I also know that Kansas Bowling is cool in a way that never goes out of style.\n\nHer newest film, CUDDLY TOYS, is one of the most exciting movies I’ve seen in years. Shot over the course of years on 16mm it’s a docu-fiction exploration of the life of the American Teenage Girl. Particularly, the horrors of being a teenage girl. Framed as an educational film, Bowling walks us through some of the most uncomfortable realities of contemporary teenage sexuality. Even though the (in)famous mondo exploitation film FACES OF DEATH always seems to come up as a comparison I’ve also seen names like Todd Solondz, Harmony Korine, Chantal Akerman, and Robert Altman thrown about, too.\n\nLike I said, it’s gonna take someone smarter and more talented than I to fully explain CUDDLY TOYS.\n\nWhat I can tell you, though, is that despite it being one of the most intense, transgressive, and often shocking films I’ve seen in quite a while, it’s also one of the funniest. Flat out.\n\nWhich makes it all the more intense.\n\nThe vibes are all over the place and always off the chart. Bowling has figured out how to make you laugh at things that aren’t funny in the least. The pitch-black humor of CUDDLY TOYS serves as both respite from the film’s intensity and as punctuation to the overall message. It’s a film that is social commentary without political ideology.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing more boring than people who make transgressive art for its own sake. People who think trying to shock people should be a goal in and of itself usually have the most banal outlook on the world anyway. They’re insufferable. If all you want to do is get a rise out of people, just go punch a stranger in the middle of the street. Any idiot can do that.\n\nAnd Kansas Bowling is the furthest thing from that.\n\nI got the chance to speak with her in preparation for her visit to Chicago where she’s doing an old school roadshow engagement of CUDDLY TOYS, with three screenings at three different theaters over the course of three days, as well as an evening of her short films and music videos at a fourth venue. We spoke about her navigating between her bare-bones style as a filmmaker while acting in major Hollywood films, about the acceptable and unacceptable ways we talk about sexual assault, why F FOR FAKE is probably the greatest film ever made, and dreaming about growing up and running a b-movie film studio.\n\nThis is an educational interview.\n\nRaphael Jose Martinez: I'm curious about the life of this movie, not necessarily the production of it, but after you finished it. Because I've been seeing it for a couple of years now kind of surreptitiously in these kind of like, I don't want to say illegal screenings, but a gray area where it's just kind of friends of friends with you there to screen it. Now CUDDLY TOYS is getting an official release with an actual distribution company into, you know, above-ground theaters. What was the holdup? And what was the process of getting it from these DIY microcinemas to, say, Lincoln Center?\n\nKansas Bowling: Well, there's been issues with getting the music rights, which has been part of it. And then the other giant issue has been... people not wanting to touch the movie...\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nKB: ...which I don't... I don't understand. Why not? People are so stupid. I just eventually had to get enough people interested… find some people and producers and supporters who are crazy enough to help it along, I guess.\n\nRJM: I've seen this movie more times than I've seen a lot of movies just because…\n\nKB: [laughs] That’s so funny!\n\nRJM: ...because I work at a place that has screened it multiple times over the past couple years. And at least with the crowd that has been at Analog [a microcinema in Chicago] specifically, it's been like a word-of-mouth hit.\n\nKB: That’s so cool.\n\nRJM: We know that we can screen CUDDLY TOYS and, without even having to really promote it, it'll at least fill the place half up. So it's really interesting to find out that people have been upset by it… I mean, it doesn’t surprise me that people are upset by it…\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nKB: Well, that's the thing! Once it actually screens most of the people really love it. But it's just like... If a distributor watches it, by themselves, not in a theater... they're like, “Oh, I don't know what people are gonna think about this. I don't know if I want to be involved.” It's just been really hard. And even with festivals, too. There's been some big festivals that were going to play it, and then there's been some internal controversy, and then they didn’t play it. I feel like it's people anticipating backlash that doesn't actually happen once people actually see it. Occasionally there is… some people have been mad. But not really, you know?\n\nRJM: Joe Swanberg here in Chicago has been a huge, huge proponent of the film. That's how I found out about it.\n\nKB: Yeah.\n\nRJM: At Analog he made it a point to not tell anybody about the movie.\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: Nothing context wise. Just, here's this really cool movie by this really cool, young director and so on and so forth. As if it's any other movie... because it is. It's just a movie. So it's been really interesting. I don't think anybody's walked out. There's been people afterwards who have been like, “I fucking did not like that movie, but at least they sat around and talked about it, you know?\n\nKB: Yeah.\n\nRJM: Because it’s different in a crowd. I’ve only seen it one time not in a crowd, when I got a screener to give to the theater that I'm booking it at [Facets]. And yeah, watching it on a couch is a whole different experience than watching a roomful of people...\n\nKB: [Laughs]\n\nRJM: ...because I find it to be really funny...\n\nKB: [laughs even harder]\n\nRJM: It's a movie that, as fucked up as it is, it’s got some of the funniest jokes I've seen in a long time... and some of the most, like, really depraved scenes. [Laughs] Do you think it's a comedy? Are you kind of bummed out when people don’t find the humor in it?\n\nKB: So this is a part that I don’t know if I want in print… [laughs] ...because a lot of the scenes I find hilarious... and I didn't expect you all to be so mad! I don't know. I guess I have a dark sense of humor. I don't know what to say without sounding like a freak. Because people can make you sound really crazy.\n\nRJM: So I’ve seen CUDDLY TOYS literally like five times in the theater at this point... which is insane. I know the scenes by the audio. If I'm working in the video store I know, “Okay, this scene’s coming up. I gotta go step into the theater and watch this part.” And I’ve found that the people that seem to be, at least in my experience from these multiple screenings that I’ve been at, the most uncomfortable by it have been men, not women.\n\nKB: Yeah.\n\nRJM: And the one scene that I'm speaking of, that I think is really funny, but makes me uncomfortable because I find it so funny, is the rape/assault scene at the picnic. There's one point where he leans in and licks a sandwich off of the girl’s face…\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: ...and it's like a setup then punchline almost. Like it's all like leading up to this!\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nRJM: And afterwards I've had conversations about that scene a couple of times, and everybody's like, “That is funny.” But at the same time it's really… real.\n\nKB: I love her date small talk. It was really funny because she was me and my sister's roommate when we filmed that. And she was on a date with someone once and me and my sister crashed it. [laughs] And the small talk on her date was really similar to that. They were really silent, and then she's like, “So... what's your favorite Gatorade flavor?”\n\nRJM: I mean, how can you take that scene too seriously when it starts with them pulling out champagne glasses and sharing a warm beer?\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nRJM: I love the movie so much because it’s transgressive in a real way, in an honest way. It doesn't feel like it's shocking for the sake of being shocking, it feels like it is like trying to tell a story in kind of a really dark, humorous way. It really feels like you're leaning into the mondo exploitation… like the history of mondo exploitation movies. Because it does feel like MONDO NEW YORK, MONDO HOLLYWOOD, and FACES OF DEATH, which I know you've said was an influence on it.\n\nKB: Yeah… thank you. I mean, I definitely was not trying to be shocking. I was just trying to make an honest movie and not censor myself or anything. I honestly never really even really thought about people reacting this way.\n\nRJM: Have you had anybody not just dislike the movie, but be angry with you for making the movie?\n\nKB: Yeah, a few times. Yeah.\n\nRJM: That’s gotta be weird.\n\nKB: It's always for really silly reasons. Like, they can't even really point out why they're upset. So it’s nothing to actually take seriously.\n\nRJM: So in the past couple of days, I re-watched the movie a couple times and I reread the book that you wrote about the making of it. They both hold on their own, but obviously the book is a companion to the movie. But I really like how in the book you don't answer anybody’s critiques. You just kind of explain your thoughts on stuff. There's one thing that you say at the very end of the book, and I'm going to quote you to you, which I know is always like weird and embarrassing, but I’ve got to do it…\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: You say, “It embarrasses me to have done it, even though I know it would have been impossible for me not to do. Just because I'm proud of something does not mean I ever have to watch it again.” I find that really fascinating because you're saying that you're not indebted to the past at all–you do stuff and you move forward–but so many of your influences, and your aesthetics are drawn from the past.\n\nKB: Yeah…\n\nRJM: Like, the mondo genre is kind of a dead genre as a film.\n\nKB: Uh huh…\n\nRJM: So I'm curious… how you do you take from the past but then just move forward with it. How do you cultivate all these things?\n\nKB: First thing is… it's really funny because, obviously, I've seen the movie a million times. I edited it and I do screenings and stuff. But whenever someone talks about the book... I wrote it [laughs] and I never read it again [laughs even harder]. I don’t even remember what I wrote in it.\n\nRJM: That's the thing that you actually don't care about anymore?\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nKB: I’m here like, “I said that?!” [laughs] But that definitely is true. That's part of it. Once I make something I feel like I've grown from it and I'm past it. I've been working on this new movie for a really long time. The movie I'm working on now I've even been working on since I was making CUDDLY TOYS - at least in the pre-production research phase and stuff. And I already feel done with it–and I'm not done filming. I just like to move on. It's the only way to, I guess, grow as a filmmaker or artist or whatever. I just feel like there's too much, there's too much to do. Just you just got to make it, stop thinking about it, and do the next thing.\n\nRJM: I agree. It's interesting how different mediums allow that. With film once you make it it's done. Unless you're going to be George Lucas and continuously edit your movies for the rest of your life, you just kind of put it in the can and let it be. Whereas I went to go see the Cure the other day, they play a song and I think to myself, “Man, you're in your 60s and you're playing a song that you wrote when you were a teenager.” That's gotta be...\n\nKB: No. That's like a nightmare. I hate it when people ask me about Troma stuff. I just want to kill myself. I just hate it.\n\nRJM: I didn't want to ask specifically about that, but as a segue... I've always been impressed by the amount, and the breadth, of different people you've been able to work with as somebody who's only done two features–but also a shit ton of shorts and music videos. In your first feature [B.C. BUTCHER] you had some pretty weird names that are celebrities in some capacity. You've done a music video with Iggy Pop. How have you gotten these people to work with you? Or how have you been able to work with these people?\n\nKB: You just have to ask [laughs]. I mean, I've asked lots of people to be my projects and a lot of people have said no–but some people have said yes. It's been cool. Like with Iggy... I was supposed to do a video for the Death Valley Girls and he has a radio show, and I knew he'd been playing their music a lot lately, so I was like, “Why don't we just ask Iggy if he'd be in a video? He loves you guys.” And I did. His assistant responded like an hour later. He was like, “He would love to!” [laughs] Of course he had his conditions. We had to go to him in Florida. The shoot obviously lasted 10 minutes because it's one shot, one take. And I've acted in a bunch of things for other people, so I've met people other ways. It's just working on things and meeting people.\n\nRJM: I come out of a DIY punk background, that whole scene, and went film school for a while and just stopped making movies because I was just like, “I don't want to work with like 20 people on anything ever.”\n\nKB: Oh yeah.\n\nRJM: I can barely be in a room to rehearse with three of my close friends. I can't imagine working with 20 strangers on, like, “my vision.” It sounds like hell. But your film making style seems like very, very akin to that. I know that on CUDDLY TOYS it was, for the most part, just you, your sister and your boyfriend. Do you have a background in underground arts besides film at all? Because I'm familiar with some of your boyfriend's old bands from back in the day [e.g., crucial Philly vampire-core band Ink & Dagger]. So I just always assumed that you might have had some connection to that somehow.\n\nKB: I mean, not really. I've just kind of been doing it the same way that I started doing it. Because I made the Troma movie when I was like 17. My crew was… I had a cinematographer that I hired off of Craigslist [laughs], and then I had all my friends from high school, my dad did sound...\n\nRJM: Wow. That's awesome.\n\nKB: [laughs] Yeah!\n\nRJM: I’m assuming he has no experience doing sound for anything ever.\n\nKB: No, I just rented a Zoom and a boom mic. So you know, he’s just holding it over people and pressing record. [laughter] I just haven't done it any other way. But every time I'm on a set, like acting or something, or working on something where there's a giant crew, I'm just like, “Oh my god, this is a nightmare. I could never do this. This is so horrible.” Because l really don’t need anyone else. It's crazy.\n\nRJM: What blew my mind is that I discovered who you were through CUDDLY TOYS, but then when I was looking into the person who made this movie I found out that you acted in a Tarantino movie [ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD]...\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: ...and these are just two opposite worlds. Big budget Hollywood with a notoriously meticulous filmmaker... and you're stealing shots in Vegas in front of casinos. Watching you navigate between the two worlds is very John Cassavetes...\n\nKB: Thank you.\n\nRJM: How do you do that? Like, does one fuel the other?\n\nKB: Umm.. like financially, yeah [laughs]. People always like, “Oh, how have you done so many music videos, and blah, blah, blah.” And I'm like, “Well, I’m poor! I have to!] How else do you think I can make my features?” Just a couple of weeks ago I was unit production manager on a short film that had like a 40-person crew…\n\nRJM: For a short film? That’s crazy…\n\nKB: I don't know. It's a crazy world, isn't it? A lot of it just seems unnecessary. I mean, I set up my own lighting usually. I'll have Don [Devore, Bowling’s boyfriend] or my effects girl, Lo, do the sound if she's not doing effects. Or if nobody's free to do the sound, I'll just like set it on the ground and press record.\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nRJM: That's how I make my stuff. I also shoot on film, Super 8, so it's usually just me being like, “Go stand over there... Move that light before you hit your blocking...”\n\nKB: It's just more that the looks I'm going after anyway are sort of from that style of filmmaking. Visually, I just would love if all my stuff just looked like Herschel Gordon Lewis movies. Not thematically but visually… which I think I got down pretty well with CUDDLY TOYS, because a lot of Herschel Gordon Lewis is sort of very small. A lot of it is indoor rooms with sort of spotlight lighting. My next movie I'm doing has a lot of outdoor scenery stuff. I'm really into a ‘70s trucker aesthetic too–just like, wide open roads. Trucker or weird road movies like BOBBY JO AND THE OUTLAW. Long zooms, things like that. All of that stuff that I'm into, you don't need like, three grips and three gaffers. For CUDDLY TOYS I shot half of it. Because I actually wasn't too confident as a cinematographer when I started CUDDLY TOYS I had a cinematographer. But pretty much halfway through I was just like, “Ehhh… give me the camera.”\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nRJM: What weren’t you comfortable with? The technical aspect or the visual aspect of it?\n\nKB: The technical aspect. I had never shot with that camera. I just got it. But eventually I just taught myself and I took over filming. And then anytime I'm on camera, Don shot it.\n\nRJM: Those scenes are great. I’ve seen you talk about the movies, and it's obvious that you have a true passion for these really fringe exploitation sub genres. The white coat exploitation genre is something that is dead and gone and nobody really references it at all, and you have this perfect execution of it, where it seems industrial, and it seems medical, and it just also seems kind of... haphazard…\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: ...not to say sloppy–because that'd be rude–but just a little bit like you can see the seams...\n\nKB: Totally! I mean, it's like partially intentional [laughs]. Sometimes I’d be like, “Aww, fuck! You can hear me stepping on the paper!” But then I'm like, “...ehhh, whatever.”\n\nRJM: I mean, that's exactly how those movies were. They weren't made to be good. They were made to be made. They're like, “We're not here to create a picture. We're here to teach you about this thing.”\n\nKB: Yeah, exactly.\n\nRJM: Joe [Swanberg] showed me a short reel of the movie that you're working on now that’s similar to CUDDLY TOYS in the sense that it is kind of about Jane Doe victimization. What exactly is the theme with that one? Cause it looks good! It felt more like an overt horror movie as opposed to this existential, kind of thematic horror movie that CUDDLY TOYS is.\n\nKB: I don't want to say too much about it because I haven’t announced the movie yet. But I will say I actually did start writing it as sort of a CUDDLY TOYS sequel, but then it turned into its own thing. I thought... what if I did a sequel where it's stories about real girls, just true stories. But then it turned into this whole thing we're I’m getting involved with, like, detectives all across the country...\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nRJM: Whoa! So this has become like a legit true crime…\n\nKB: [laughs] Yeah, like, trying to solve crimes. I've been like an amateur detective the last few years...\n\nRJM: That's wild.\n\nKB: [laughs] Yeah! Once you get into it you find out a lot of these unsolved cases are just unsolved because nobody's doing anything about it. They just kind of gave up like 40 years ago. There's all this new technology, and they're like, “Oh, yeah... that case. We haven't thought about that in a couple decades.” They just need someone to, like, poke around a little.\n\nRJM: There's a line, I think now more than ever, where… exploitation fare used to be so looked down upon historically. Look at the ‘60s through the ‘80s. It was just “trash cinema” and “pulp” and stuff like that. True Crime obsession has gone mainstream–or if not mainstream, it's become acceptable.\n\nKB: Mmhmm.\n\nRJM: Do you see a kind cleansing with that? Because CUDDLY TOYS still has this kind of sordid feel to it. Like, there's still elements of that movie where it feels like you're watching something you're not supposed to be watching…\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: Whereas people are trying to make careers out of true crime podcasts, where they're trying to appeal to the widest possible people while just exploiting, like, literally exploiting people's tragedy.\n\nKB: Yeah… I don't know if I have anything to say about that…\n\nRJM: [laughs] That’s fair.\n\nKB: Well… a lot of people... I don't know... I don't want to get into this. I'm gonna say something that's gonna make me sound like a real asshole [laughs]...\n\nRJM: That's fine. That's fine. [laughs] I just think it's like really silly. Growing up, where I did, when I did–I'm from Chicagoland–I remember when Gacy was executed. I remember where I was when Dahmer was killed in prison. As if it was like 9/11 or something. Like, I remember exactly where I was when I heard the news. And so I just find how all of these wine moms talk about this...\n\nKB: Yeah...\n\nRJM: ...like weird and sad, and kind of just … boring.\n\nKB: There's like trends of acceptable ways to talk about things.\n\nRJM: That's a great way to put it. Because I think that CUDDLY TOYS talks about stuff that people talk about all the time, and that people make millions of dollars talking about, but the way that you're doing it is not the “okay” way. It's not the approved way of doing it. Do you think that's kind of the issue?\n\nKB: I guess, yeah. This could be a whole other conversation… but it's sort of like the conversation about like, rape culture, and how it's just been this huge conversation the last like six years, or however long it's been. And all you hear all day is “rape, rape, rape, rape, rape...” But then if you, god forbid, make something that's influenced by hearing that word 24/7 then, like, you’re a monster. I don’t know. [laughs] See, this is where I go and say silly things. No one's calling me a monster.\n\nRJM: At a certain point when something becomes part of the cultural conversation why are people shocked when people talk about it in uncomfortable ways?\n\nKB: Yeah.\n\nRJM: Which is why I liked watching that movie. Every time I watch it, I get something more out of it. Because once the immediate discomfort of certain scenes in your film are gone, that immediate shock… I mean, every time I watch that movie I find it fucking funnier.\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: Is it because I've been desensitized to it?\n\nKB: [laughs harder]\n\nRJM: Or is it because I'm able to get past looking around like, “Is it okay for me to laugh at this? Are people gonna fucking judge me for enjoying this? Am I supposed to enjoy this type of thing?”\n\nKB: There are horrible things that happen in the world every day. So I feel like, you know, you don't have to be sad all the time. You're allowed to find the irony in something horrible and laugh about it.\n\nRJM: That's absolutely true. People who don't want to have fun will make sure that nobody gets to have fun. That's just how it seems to be. Or they’ll make it their point to try to make sure that nobody gets to have fun.\n\nKB: Yeah. Like when we did the double rape scene, we were all laughing, having fun, while we were filming it. And we're just like, “Oh my god, wouldn't it be so funny if like, right before this girl dies, she's just talking about, like, what she wants to be when she grows up and stuff?” [laughter] Like, it's just horrible, really awful stuff. And you know, when that happens in real life, it's god awful. But you know, I've been around things like that, too. And it's not fun. But then… I don't know... when you see it so in your face like this… you can't even really tell in the voiceover where she's walking over to the car hitchhiking, but we did this really funny voiceover where she's like, “Oh, I love Ted Bundy... his eyebrows remind me of my dad.” [laughs] “When I grow up, I want to have a clothing store in Haight-Ashbury...”\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nKB: It’s stupid, but...\n\nRJM: Going back to what you were saying before, I think that because of your purposeful blending of reality and complete fiction–ridiculous, over-the-top fiction–people just want to assume that everything is the most serious and the most real, and they can't like enjoy it. Like, it's a movie. It's just a movie, guys.\n\nKB: Even in real life, though. There's some really, god awful things that have happened. And, you know, part of the way to deal with them is just to find the really ridiculous part in it and laugh about it.\n\nRJM: In your book, you talk about how it was harder to find guys to do the rape scenes than to do murder scenes.\n\nKB: [laughs] Yeah.\n\nRJM: People were dropping out, people didn't want to do but then begrudgingly did it anyway, because they’re like, “I guess I committed to it. I have to do it.” You talked about how when you were actually doing it, you guys were cutting it up and having fun. How you actually got to where they feel like, “Oh, this isn't gonna be like a heavy thing.” How did you work as a director with the actors to be like, “Ok. Rape this teenage girl...”\n\nKB: Well, I didn't do it in a way where… [laughs] this might get me in trouble. I shouldn’t… I’m not one of those people who is like, [serious, concerned voice] “Are you going be okay?” Like, I feel like that just makes it more awkward, you know? I don't know. They agreed to do it. So okay, let's just go do it. That's fine. And then everyone laughs after. I don't know. I don't know what to say about that...\n\nRJM: I just found it interesting that you made that a point to talk about in your book, that actors are more uncomfortable with doing anything that involves sexual assault than murder, or anything like that.\n\nKB: Yeah. Someone actually, like specifically, said that. I don't remember which scene it was where I was going to shoot in somebody's car, I think it might have been for the double rape scene. I think it was gonna be in this dude's van at first, and he's like, “Oh, yeah... I mean... You can, like, kill the girls in the van, but you can't rape them in it.”\n\nRJM: What?\n\nKB: [laughs] “Okay, we just won't use it then.” It’s so stupid. I can't remember who it was.\n\nRJM: ...but what a strange line to draw...\n\nKB: [laughs] That's what I've actually heard about my next movie, that it's gonna be a lot easier to get distribution because the girls die.\n\nRJM: Yeah, because as a society, we're more okay with killing women more than hurting women. Not that either one of them is good at all, or should happen at all, please let me be clear…\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: ...but what a weird line to draw–especially when it comes to the arts. Like, why one and not the other\n\nKB: I honestly don't understand at all. I don't I don't even know what to say about it. I just don't get it. It’s really stupid.\n\nRJM: I'm curious about some of your influences as a filmmaker, not directly in regard to CUDDLY TOYS, or your new project or anything, but in general. I remember once when you came to Chicago for a screening you programmed THE SWIMMER at Analog, which I had never heard of. I just went in there and like 30 minutes into the movie I'm like, “Is this just about a dude swimming through people's fucking swimming pools? This is the wildest thing I’ve ever seen in my fucking life.”\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: It's this weird B-movie from the middle of an era that's like post-New Hollywood but pre-video. What other films from that era are influences on you? Because I know that you had said that was an influence in some capacity on your filmmaking.\n\nKB: Yeah, that's definitely in my top 10. I think it's just an incredible movie. I think MIDNIGHT COWBOY is probably the greatest movie ever made.\n\nRJM: Only X-rated movie to ever win an Oscar.\n\nKB: Best Picture! Yeah, I think that's the greatest movie ever made. My favorite movie of all time probably is F FOR FAKE, the Orson Welles movie.\n\nRJM: That is one of my favorite movies. Top five of all time. That is the magic of cinema, of what film can do.\n\nKB: Every time I watch it, I feel like I'm just holding my breath the whole time. Like, oh my god. It’s so perfect and beautiful. Same with MIDNIGHT COWBOY, though. I'm just like, man… every single shot was so thought out about how the movie was going to be edited. Just everything. It's just… it's perfect. My favorite director probably, as his whole body of work, is Russ Meyer. I think SUPER VIXENS is one of the greatest movies ever made. Also, Robert Altman's POPEYE.\n\nRJM: Really?\n\nKB: Yeah. It's perfect. It's really perfect. And then I love, of course, all the Italian horror movies… DON’T TORTURE A DUCKLING, the Fulci movie, is also one of my favorites. There's a movie called THE WITCH WHO CAME FROM THE SEA–that's also one my favorite movies. Oh! SOMEWHERE IN TIME...\n\nRJM: I don’t know that one.\n\nKB: I think it's the most romantic movie ever made. It's Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. It's written by Richard Matheson. And it's directed by the guy who directed the majority of the Night Gallery episodes, which is one of the best shows ever. The Rod Serling show after The Twilight Zone. SOMEWHERE IN TIME is a little square compared the other ones but I think it's beautiful.\n\nRJM: I have a question that kind of ties into all that, because all of these you’re naming are from a specific era, which overlaps with the first thing you see when CUDDLY TOYS comes on screen… the Crown International Pictures logo. How did you get that? They don't exist.\n\nKB: Uhh… [laughs] I haven’t asked yet.\n\nRJM: Awesome.\n\nKB: When I was like a little girl, it was my dream to be the president of Crown International Pictures [laughs]. When I was like, either 17 or 18, or something like that, I worked like one day a week at Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills. I would take a bus, and I would get off at this bus stop that was right in front of the abandoned Crown International Building. I would look in the window every day and be like, “Someday! It’s all gonna be mine!” But now it's like a car dealership or something [laughs].\n\nRJM: That's even better. A perfect metaphor.\n\nKB: I wouldn't want a building in Beverly Hills anyways now. I'm a different person.\n\nRJM: Charlie Chaplin lived in Chicago for like a hot minute making silent films before they moved out to L.A. There’s still the studio building where he created his Tramp character and stuff like that. They sold the building to a college. So I drive by it all the time like, “Oh, look, the history of cinema.”\n\nKB: That's so cool. Now where I live is right where Mark Twain first started writing. So I’m always like, “Man, American humor was invented right here!” So that's even better.\n\nRJM: That is actually much better than wanting to have an old warehouse in Beverly Hills, that's for sure.\n\nKB: Yeah… I fucking hate L.A. now. So I'm never going back.\n\nRJM: Maybe that's why Chicago loves CUDDLY TOYS so much...\n\nKB: Because you guys hate L.A.?\n\nBoth: [laughter]\n\nRJM: Exactly.\n\nKB: It’s a truly awful place.\n\nRJM: I just got one last question for you. I ask this to everybody that I interview... What's one thing that you know to be 100% true, that somebody else would say is not a fact. Something that is a core belief to you but somebody else would debate you on.\n\nKB: Reincarnation?\n\nRJM: Yeah?\n\nKB: [laughs]\n\nRJM: Have you thought about what you have been before?\n\nKB: Yeah. I think I was a trucker. Yeah... for sure, actually.\n\nMegan Fariello: Amy Nicholson, in the first of the six chapters that make up the film, states that we’ve all been to Oz. It’s often a first favorite film—it was certainly mine. It seems to be wholly informative to an individual and group understanding of cinema. And so that said, what drew you to dive into such detail, into THE WIZARD OF OZ and into Lynch’s relationship and obsession with that film, and maybe a broader cultural impact that the film has.\n\nAlexandre O. Philippe: Generally speaking… if I look at my general preoccupations, or my body of work, if you will, all the films that we’ve made at Exhibit A Pictures, I’m certainly very interested in the idea of the movies that have transcended their medium to become cultural events. Those are really the films that I’m specifically interested in, and there’s no question that THE WIZARD OF OZ is one of those films. A little bit unique, for me specifically, in this film, is that I grew up in Switzerland and so THE WIZARD OF OZ is not really very well known in Europe. So I didn’t grow up on THE WIZARD OF OZ, I grew up on Lynch. I was a Lynch fan long before I became a fan of THE WIZARD OF OZ… I discovered THE WIZARD OF OZ in my twenties.\n\nMF: Oh wow, that’s such an interesting perspective.\n\nAOP: Yeah, the moment that I did watch THE WIZARD OF OZ, I immediately became hooked. I’ve studied it and spent a lot of time trying to understand that film. But so for me, I think this film stems initially from the desire to make a film about David Lynch… I became just absolutely fascinated by the mysterious connections between America’s quintessential fairy tale and our foremost surrealist. What a mashup, right?\n\nMF: That’s such an interesting, different perspective than I have, which is [that THE WIZARD OF OZ is a film] I watched a hundred times as a young kid. [AOP laughs.] I was really struck by the construction of this film, particularly the elongated six chapters. Can you speak a little bit about how you structured this film, how you came up with the form, and the process of finding the participants and those perspectives, and how it all came together?\n\nAOP: There’s a lot of steps to that. The first step was COVID. [Laughs] We started working on this film in earnest in March 2020, just when things started to shut down. There wasn’t that possibility of actually filming interviews, but for something like this… which is again, it’s not a film that in any way, shape, or form attempts to solve the David Lynch riddle, because there’s nothing to solve… it’s a film that is about mysteries. It’s about the mysteries of the creative process, it’s about the mysteries of influence and inspiration, so it made a whole lot of sense for me to explore those mysteries through very specific lenses and to give each participant the room to develop a thesis. First and foremost, I had to find people who were completely willing to go there with me and just see how far we could go. It landed on those six people, or seven actually [directors Aaron Moorhead and Justin Benson share a chapter]. It became this sort of organic thing. I went one by one, because I felt like each chapter informed other questions or triggered other questions or ways to look into this relationship between Lynch and OZ. I had to go one participant at a time… then I crafted what I essentially thought was their chapter. When [myself and the participant] were both really happy with where it landed, I sent them to the recording studio to record their voiceover, and that’s what you have in the film.\n\nMEF: I really appreciated the amount of time that you allotted to each of these chapters. The participants, they really seem to dive into not only into analysis and theories, but also their own personal cinematic histories. Was there anything surprising that came out thematically or in individual chapters that you were not expecting to hear?\n\nAOP: It’s all unexpected. I’m glad you picked up on that, because to me, the real beauty of those chapters is how personal they get. Of course it’s a film about the relationship between Lynch and THE WIZARD OF OZ… but on a larger scale it’s about the mysteries of influence and inspiration on the creative process, which is why we have this epic montage at the end, which I’m not going to give away for people who haven’t watched the film. But it’s about larger ideas, about when we grow up watching movies and we love movies, and we get influenced by certain films, and then you grow up and you become a filmmaker, that in a way we’re all sort of trapped by those films whether we like to admit it or not. But that’s a really cool thing, it’s a really beautiful thing, this idea that there are certain ideas, themes, motifs, and totems that keep coming back again and again and again in our work… it’s not that we’re trapped in a negative sense, we’re not made prisoners by those films, but those films become a part of our filmmaking DNA. As David Lowery mentions in his chapter, he says you sort of have to lean in on that, you have to keep digging, and the more you dig, the more you find. And I think that’s such a beautiful idea.\n\nMF: In terms of putting the visual and the audio together, I think in the Benson and Moorhead chapter, they mention how unique Lynch’s approach is to sound and the combining of visuals and auditory elements. I found that through the film, through your combination of what the participants and the perspectives were saying, and the visuals that you were putting on screen… what is the process, how do you work through editing a visual essay in tandem with these very personal, in-depth perspectives?\n\nAOP: That’s where the real work began. That particular work, it starts at the writing process, in the sense that as I started putting together their chapter, I had to think on a micro level about how I’m going to tell this story visually. That’s number one. But obviously I worked very, very closely with my wonderful editor, David Lawrence, who’s a wonderful filmmaker and editor in his own right; we literally pored over every single moment and every single clip and made sure not just that it landed, but that every single clip was really the best possible one, that it was really special, that it told a story on multiple levels. That’s very involved. We have well over a thousand clips in the film. It gets pretty wild. That was the real grind, in a way. It’s a fun grind, but it was a grind, you know, making this film.\n\nMF: Speaking to that, there’s a really interesting balance between these personal, very in-depth film analyses, as well as a broader cultural impact of THE WIZARD OF OZ and Lynch’s engagement with that film, thematically looking at American mythology, the American dream. Can you speak to that theme running through the six chapters?\n\nAOP: The idea of the American dream is very important to me and very interesting to me because growing up in Europe, and growing up as a cinephile very specifically, not exclusively, but very specifically, of American films and Hollywood films, when I was growing up, I dreamed of the United States. I think without necessarily knowing it then, I longed for the day where I would get to go or maybe there was a seed there that I would get to one day move to America, which I did, I eventually became American as well. I mean, I’ve lived this idea of the American dream. I was the first of my family to come here, and I followed my dreams and I worked hard. I became very lucky to have the opportunity to do the things that I do. But, the American Dream, also… first of all, it’s an idea, and, as we all know, it’s an idea that, unfortunately, you need all the right circumstances and a lot of luck to get. And I’m very cognizant of that, that I was very fortunate to be able to have the life that I have, to do what I do. The darkness of it, this idea of chasing the dream, if you will, which in and of itself is also a bit of a myth… I think certainly David Lynch explores that really beautifully in his films, from the character of Diane in MULHOLLAND DRIVE to the Laura Dern character in INLAND EMPIRE. All these characters who envision themselves living the dream, getting over the rainbow and everything’s wonderful, but it’s not. It’s all in their heads. It’s complicated, it’s a very complicated idea, and it’s a very loaded idea. What’s interesting is that, as complicated as America is, socially, politically, on just about every level, it's a complicated country, especially now, I think that that idea of America, true or false, true for some and not for others, but true or false generally speaking, it’s still very potent. People still dream about America. For good or not good reasons.\n\nMF: In Lynch’s films, it’s so hard to parse through what he’s saying about the American dream and home and this return to something.\n\nAOP: The one thing I would say about that, which is what I think makes his films so wonderful to me, certainly, is that even though a lot of his characters don’t get to go over the rainbow, truly, or they go over the rainbow but they can’t find a way back home, he still treats them with a great deal of empathy. Karyn [Kusama] in her chapter really talks about this particular idea so beautifully. This idea that Diane Selwyn [in MULHOLLAND DRIVE], in sort of creating the Betty character, who is innocent and optimistic and as she says a very golly-gee, gee-whiz kind of optimist, gets to project the best version of herself. That’s really a beautiful idea. I really responded to that idea when Karyn said. I think as dark as Lynch can get, he is very much the sort of innocent optimist, and I think that’s what makes him so relatable.\n\nMF: It was interesting that that got brought up, how optimistic he is despite that darkness that runs through his work. I have one final question: I found this film incredibly self-reflexive, in the perspectives but also in thinking about my own relationship to THE WIZARD OF OZ and the connection to Lynch, and maybe the reason I’m a Lynch fan is because I watched THE WIZARD OF OZ so much as a kid [laughs]... but what in terms of your own process through making this film, was there anything you reflected about your own relationship to cinema, to the kinds of films you appreciate? Was there something new about how you understand and relate to cinema through this entire project?\n\nAOP: I think inevitably every time I have the opportunity to dive into this kind of project and especially with, again, people I have so much admiration for, who are such wonderful thinkers, people who think very actively about not just movies, but art and how movies relate to life and the language of cinema, and all of that stuff, I really can’t stress enough what an incredible privilege it is for me to be able to pick their brains and then follow their trains of thoughts and ask them questions and see where that leads me. Everytime I make a film like this, I feel like I come out of the process richer. And I don’t mean richer just because so-and-so made a connection between Lynch and OZ that I hadn’t thought of; that’s all great, that’s always fun, when you get to discover that, but that’s not what the film is about. It’s when David Lowery talks about the experience of watching THE WIZARD OF OZ in black and white when he was a kid and how that experience became transformed when he got to finally watch it in sepia and color the second time around and then watching it again as an adult, having a better understanding now of the quote-unquote American nightmare. That’s really cool. There’s [also] this great moment where I ask [John Waters] a question about his own work, and he says, “Yeah, I think I’ve made some references, but I can’t really think of one.” So then I had to go through his entire filmography again and find those moments, and there’s some incredible stuff! Those are the moments that are transformative for me as a filmmaker, as a cinephile, and as a human, period.\n\nBy Raphael Jose Martinez\n\nFilms about artists are often hagiographies, a way to elevate someone into some sort of canon. The most interesting things about them are generally paved over in order to tell stories of overcoming struggle and making these people into messengers of hope. Swedish writer-director Lasse Hallström’s HILMA deftly avoids all the trappings of the banal, cliched bio-pic and gives us the story of a truly strange and powerful artist without any generic window dressing.\n\nThe film tells the story of Hilma af Klint, a queer Swedish artist who, despite predating popular abstract artists, was completely unknown until well after her death in 1944.\n\nAnd by choice. An iconoclastic mystic, who used her powers as a spiritual medium to paint what she saw in the metaphysical world, Klint was unknown until her first gallery showing in 1986, 42 years after her death. In 2019 her show at the Guggenheim Museum drew over 600,000 visitors, making it the most attended exhibition in the museum’s history.\n\nHILMA gives a beautiful overview of the often fraught and difficult life of Klint. Starring the mother-daughter duo of Tora Hallström and Lena Olin, both as Hilma at different points in the artist’s life, we get a powerful telling of woman who, to this day, seems to exist outside the bounds of conventional society.\n\nI had the pleasure to sit down with both Tora and Lena for a conversation. What began as a simple question-and-answer session about the film eventually turned into a wonderfully weaving, meandering conversation about solace and comfort in a post-pandemic world, the power of manifesting, the need for witches in contemporary society, and the soul of art. I think Hilma would have enjoyed it very much.\n\nRaphael Jose Martinez (RJM): So what drew the two of you into doing a film about Hilma af Klint?\n\nTora Hallström (TH): My dad [HILMA writer-director Lasse Hallström] started out by being really interested in UFOs and through that he met some guy who used to work at the Pentagon. There was this whole process of figuring out if there are extra-terrestrial beings, and there was some connection with that and mediums. Through that he became very interested in mediums, being able to talk to the other side, and at the same time Hilma was becoming really big in New York. And she was a medium, obviously, and Swedish, so he started doing a lot of research. I was working in investment banking at the time when this started becoming an actual topic of conversation, and I was on my only vacation, like, ever, and my dad was talking about this project saying, “I think I’m going to make a movie about Hilma af Klint and you should play Hilma.” I was like, “I’m… I’m a banker.” [Laughs] I can’t do this. But then during the pandemic I moved home and had this period of reflection…\n\nRJM: I think a lot of us did.\n\nLena Olin (LO): Oh yeah.\n\nTH: It was this awful time, but it was kind of a blessing to have all this time to be bored. I was also 25, so quarter-life crisis thoughts were coming to me, too. Do I actually like what I do? And I was tracing the common thread of, “I think I want to do acting, actually.” And at the same time there was a first draft of this script and ViaPlay wanted to buy it, so all these things just kind of intersected at the same time. I was ready to change my life and do this.\n\nRJM: And what drew you to it?\n\nLO: Well, it started with a fascination of Lasse. Because the first time I heard her name mentioned was when I watched a movie with Kristen Stewart on a plane called PERSONAL SHOPPER, where she looks for her dead brother. And she says that there's a Swedish painter who has a connection with the other side and her name is Hilma af Klint. And I didn't know… I thought it was a fictional character because I hadn't heard of her. I was playing a painter, and I was shooting in the East Hamptons, Tom Dolby (THE ARTIST’S WIFE) was the director, and Lasse was staying with me because he was writing this film about UFOs. And Tom Dolby said, because I was playing a painter, he said, “I love Hilma af Klint, do you know her paintings?” And I was like, “She’s real?!” So then we started reading about her, and I could see that Lasse got obsessed with her and he said, “I have to make a movie about this woman.” Because she’s such a powerful, extraordinary, brilliant character. He started contacting the family and traveling to places she’s lived, places she’s worked, and became obsessed with it. And he said, “There’s one person that should play Hilma, and that’s Tora.” So it all came together in a magical way, actually. It was almost like everything was meant to happen.\n\nRJM: Do you think the fact that it was a family of Swedish artists wanting to do this project allowed it to happen so quickly?\n\nLO: I think so. Yeah. And we get the question, “Why is it in English?” Well, Lasse first went the whole bureaucratic way in Sweden where you need to wait until next year’s decision by the Swedish Film Institute… it’s very sort of Eastern European heavy in that regard. Then ViaPlay came in and said they wanted it to be specifically Nordic but reach internationally. They said, “We’ll take care of it. We can pay for the script.” They loved the script, they loved the idea, they love Lasse… and they had seen tapes of what Tora can do with the character. But we wanted to make it in English because we want to go international.\n\nRJM: That makes sense. And I love that you two are speaking specifically about the draw of the aspect that she was a medium, because that makes it far more unique than most biographical dramas about artists. I’m particularly intrigued by how the film does focus on the mysticism, with the constant refrain of her being a “witch.” You can’t really speak of her life story without having the mysticism in there, it’s inextricable, but this also seems to follow this uptick in films about female mysticism–for lack of better terms “witchcraft”–that seems to be happening. What do you think the pull is to stories like these nowadays, that more people are wanting to see these representations–or at least these tales, stories–of women who are doing, not anti-scientific stuff, but para-scientific stuff?\n\nTH: I think it’s because a lot of people have these sides to themselves and believe in a lot of it, but it hasn't been acceptable for a long time. And so they see it and are like, “I recognize that. I haven't seen that someone else has seen what I’ve seen and believe.” And people have it to varying degrees. Like people like to go to yoga. That’s like one degree. Then some people actually have medium capabilities. Through this whole process I’m very open about the fact that I believe in this type of stuff now, and people have come to us and been like, “Yeah, I talk to the other side, too.” It’s become a hope in being able to talk about it openly. I actually believe in it, and it lightens everything. I felt a lot of fear of death in my life and the hope of thinking that if you lose a loved one you’ll be able to speak to them and they’ll always be with you. I think there’s something really beautiful and comforting in that for people. And especially seeing a woman doing this type of work in that time and being so brave to be able to do it when it was kind of dangerous, I think is really powerful.\n\nRJM: The film makes it very, very clear that she was going to do what she wanted to do regardless of even her closest loved ones.\n\nLO: Right. I think that's what’s so moving about her. The fact that she was so incredibly brave to just keep going. She followed what she saw, the stories she had to tell. And I think that, speaking of witches and mysticism, I think we need it now. I think in those days when they burned them maybe they didn’t need them. I don't know. Cause they were more in touch with the earth. People were more spiritual. Today we understand the power of it, that we need it … I think Hilma is brilliant example of science and creativity going together. It’s the same thing with medicine. I wouldn’t go to only holistic medicine and be like, “Yeah!” But I trust what they say–and the combination is amazing. I think where we are, as human beings on this planet today, we need it! What did those witches say that was so powerful they needed to burn them?!\n\nTH: Yeah!\n\nLO: Let’s listen up. Like everything, like old people who understood the earth. I just came from Arizona, and you see that we are now coming back to what they tried to show us. There’s a power in the earth. You just have to respect it. All of those things, we need them now. And I think therefore people are waking up. I think a lot of people have carried this, “I think it’s a little embarrassing, but I think I feel my dad’s presence when I…” You know? And now the more we speak about it the more everyone is like, “Yeah! Maybe we’re not alone. Maybe we are all one. Maybe there is something bigger. Maybe there is hope in that.” [Deep breath] Yeah!\n\nRJM: Absolutely! Because there’s nothing specifically about this film that makes it overtly a post-pandemic type of film, but I felt it really was. It offers that hope. Because as a world we’re processing this mass amount of death…\n\nLO: Yes, yes.\n\nRJM: …that we’ve all seen, if it hasn’t affected us directly. All those images we were just bombarded with when we had nothing to do but watch them.\n\nTH: Right…\n\nLO: You’re right!\n\nRJM: And now this film kind of offers a soft way of helping deal with that, which I really enjoyed.\n\nLO: Totally. That’s a really good point.\n\nRJM: The other thing about the bravery of Hilma that I thought was quite specifically in the narrative here is the focus on her queer relationships, which is not a thing that you really hear about even now when they speak of her. If anything they only focus on the mysticism. Or a strong woman in a time, and a culture, that didn’t allow her to do what she did. A lot of artists kind of get desexualized, because “nobody wants the tawdry details,” when I think that everyone actually wants the tawdry details! What was that like in the making of this, and in focusing on this aspect of Hilma? Why did you feel the need to do it? And how did you go about navigating that?\n\nTH: I think it’s because that was the truth–or at least as we understand it. It’s pretty much confirmed. We’ve spoken to her family… I haven’t spoken to them directly, but my dad spoke a lot with her family. We read the correspondence with Anna, who was her love in the movie. I feel like it needed a love story. But what I love about how it’s handled in the film is that it’s just a beautiful love story, it’s not necessarily about trying to sexualize the fact that it’s a queer relationship or anything like that. Like, “Ooh!” We’re not going to make it a big deal. It’s just so natural that she loves Anna, and Anna loves Hilma.\n\nRJM: It’s a relationship between artists.\n\nTH: We’re just celebrating their love, I think, which is even more impactful for the LGBTQ community. They just naturally have a love story.\n\nRJM: It didn’t have to be all neat and cute.\n\nLO: And it’s complicated, the way love stories are. Anna has the money, Hilma does not, and it became this sort of inflamed thing for them. And that’s something that the family may not speak of now, but she didn’t get any financial help from the family because she was an outsider. She was not accepted. And the way the relatives talk about her is like [puts on a cartoonishly snooty accent] “Well… she preferred to eat vegetables. Hmmmm. She was very odd.” When they speak about her they sort of walk around it, but I think in those days it was so not acceptable. I mean, she loved women. So she created her own little world of women who understood her and respected her, that she understood and respected. And it was complicated, the way love and relationships are! It was like because they were women and they loved each other it’s all flowery. It was awfully complicated.\n\nRJM: It seems like a relationship that 50 years ago would have been relegated to, “They were… friends.”\n\nTH: A couple of spinsters living together!\n\nLO: And I think that Lasse has such a good take on that. I really love how he portrays them. It’s exactly as you said, they were “friends.” We all have uncles that everyone is like, “No… he lived with his best friend.”\n\nRJM: “It was just easier for them that way!” But with an eyebrow raised… With this being a film that was also made by a family there must have been a connection that you all had in the process that would be more akin to a spiritual connection than, say, working for a hired job. How was that, versus some of the other stuff you have done?\n\nLO: Well, I think that Tora and Lasse had a very… Lasse would say, “She freaking reads my mind! If I walk up because I wanted her to do something, Tora would be like, ‘I know.’” And then she would do exactly what I thought I wanted her to do!” Which is very cool! But Lasse knew that even though it’s family, I think that it was important to him to get the best out of people–that everyone is going to feel like family. That everyone is going to feel respected and included. But I think that the two of them had a very, “I know what you’re thinking..” [dynamic].\n\nRJM: Was there ever a moment where you thought to–or did you–attempt to contact the spirit of Hilma?\n\nLO: Tora did.\n\nTH: Mmhmm. We met with a really talented medium in Sweden. Actually all the five women and I had a session with him together. I had a session with him alone where we talked about my personal life and talked to Hilma, and then we all did one together, which was really beautiful. And he only speaks Swedish. The rest of the actresses were English, so I actually translated as he was speaking. So I kind of had to take the role of Hilma…\n\nRJM: So you became a medium for the medium?\n\nTH: A medium for the medium! Which was very funny! So I got the experience of listening to him and communicating to them what he was saying. But it was so interesting. We spoke to Hilma directly. She had such a great sense of humor, which was very surprising. You feel like she would take her work very seriously–which she did–but she was so fun to talk to. Like she was someone I’d be friends with today! We had a great time together! Of course she had this darkness that she was dealing with, too, but there was this lightness. It was really beautiful getting to experience that together.\n\nLO: All the girls were on fire! I remember after that, after one of the sessions you had with that medium, somebody had seen Tora and the other actors and was like, “I didn't dare walk to that table because they were such a lit group.” It was amazing.\n\nTH: We got all these interesting anecdotes from her personal life. I mean, we can’t confirm that they’re true, but I believe that they’re true. Where she said that she didn't feel like a man or a woman, there wasn’t a word for that at the time. And I was like, “This is so exciting.” I got to bring this masculine energy to a role of woman wearing a corset in a period piece and make it so modern and fresh. Amazing little details that she threw in there that we got to hear directly from Hilma.\n\nRJM: That’s so interesting that you say that because I thought there were moments in the movie, and from her life, that seemed kind of prescient and speak to things now. One of the particular moments is the scene where she has Rudolph Steiner come to her studio and look at her stuff and he comments that art that doesn't originate in the soul of the artist can’t really be called art.\n\nTH: Mmhmm.\n\nRJM: And she has a moment where she asks herself, “What am I doing?” And I think now we’re dealing with that on a technological level with A.I. art and stuff like that.\n\nLO: Yeah! You're right!\n\nRJM: Is that art? Is that not art? It translates into visual art, and now with acting even you can replicate people’s voices. Because Hilma said it was a tool. She sees what she does, that’s out of her control, as a way to get to the reality of it, whereas Steiner thought that was not it at all. How do you two feel about this weird in between of what you’re actually doing, or what this machine, this technological ghost is doing for you?\n\nTH: Wow. Yeah, that’s really…\n\nLO: I feel like what she was describing… that artificial thing is super creepy actually. And people have relationships with it, like, “I love you so much! Don’t leave me.” But it’s… artificial! But I do believe that in any creative job there is that divine intervention. If you’re on stage and you suddenly go and grab somebody’s arm and were thrown against the wall… then afterwards you ask, “Where did that come from?!” Or you're suddenly in a scene, and you do something, and you've prepared and prepared, and once you start shooting you let go of everything and let it happen. Then the things that happen, it’s like a summer wind that blows through a room. You have the windows open, and the curtains move. Something happened. And I think that is creativity. When we’re open. We can prepare, but we have to let it come to us. And I think that's what Hilma was describing. Then they put names to it, like the High Masters. But I think that anyone… we think that something is there. We’re listening to our gut, to our spirit. We are being lead by something.\n\nRJM: Do you think that there will ever be an artist, 50 or 60 years down the road, that people will say that they were feeling the spirit of artificial intelligence? In this weird way that they felt they were being guided it? Personally, I don't.\n\nLO: Does it scare you though? The artificial intelligence thing?\n\nRJM: I am absolutely of two minds, because I think there is a definite use for it.\n\nLO: Of course.\n\nRJM: But for labor reasons.\n\nLO: Yeah, yeah, yeah!\n\nRJM: When you're making certain types of art there are certain things that aren't that important. “I wish that background just existed. I wish we didn't have to focus on that because it’s just not very important.” Which in that case, this is great. But then you have the idea of, “Oh I want it to help me write this script or this dialogue.” It can’t appreciate the world on a physical or sensuous level. It can’t describe the feel of your summer breeze, it can only describe the idea of the feel of a summer breeze. And there I find it scary. Because the moment when you conflate those two everything disappears and falls apart.\n\nTH: But it’s all derived from human art, too. Are you talking about the A.I. app that creates art? Like, “Give me pigs in a cathedral drinking wine.” And then there's just a painting of that. Have you seen that?\n\nLO: No! Oh my god!\n\nRJM: And you can do “pigs in a cathedral drinking wine in the style of Picasso.”\n\nLO: [Laughs] Oh no!\n\nRJM: And it looks like a Picasso!\n\nTH: But you have to say “in the style of a Picasso,” right? There had to be a Picasso to make it happen.\n\nLO: Oh, that's true!\n\nTH: Nothing original is going to happen without humans, who have the ability to imagine things that don't exist. Artificial intelligence just draws from that. At least I hope there's not a future where artificial intelligence can imagine things that don't exist or create things out of nothing!\n\nLO: But you pray that there is something… in love, in art, that can only be made by humans. I was thinking, the thing that makes us human… I was sitting at the opening [of the film], which I haven't done in a long time, and I was sitting there with other people, and it was sensational. Like, god, we need other people when we watch something, when we experience something. And that's not artificial, that's human! But it can be helpful. Someone was telling me about how with some medical things they can do it faster than any doctor could put two and two together. If you have this x-ray of a lung and then you also have the blood work, boom, they do it in two seconds. But when it comes to art… that's so scary. But you're right. There needed to be a Picasso to make it in the style of Picasso.\n\nRJM: So I have one final question, and it’s completely unrelated to the film, just a final question that I ask at every interview. Kind of an artistic outlook question. And it is… what is one thing that you as a person believe to be 100% true, a fact in your mind, that someone else would disagree with you about?\n\nLO: God, that’s so interesting…\n\nTH: I think a lot of things. I can’t choose one!\n\nLO: I think that I’m very… I love to watch sport coaches, what they say, and how they coach people. I grew up with actors, I went through drama school, but I think I’m being so much more helped when I listen to sport coaches. And one of the ones who was training horseback riding, he was saying, “When a kid comes up to me with realistic dreams, I’m not interested. I want the ones with unrealistic dreams.” And I think I’m unrealistic in my dreams and what I believe to be a fact. This is what I’m going to do. This is the house I’m going to build. And I’m talking about the guest house I’m going to build, and I look at our house, and I look at my husband, and everyone is like, “It’s never going to happen.” But I know it will happen. It’s a very small thing, but I think that’s the one thing. And I can apply that to a lot of things that I truly believe. I’ve been right so far, but I'm not so sure that one’s going to happen. But I have a lot of those, where I have such strong beliefs. But I think that all of my dreams have been so sure. They're dreams, and I take that very seriously.\n\nTH: I like that. Manifesting works.\n\nRJM: That’s perfect. I kind of sums up the whole film as well. What a great way to end this.\n\nBy Raphael Jose Martinez\n\nIt’s impossible to describe Lydia Lunch. Calling her a musician, or an artist, or a writer, is like calling the January 6th storming of the U.S. Capitol an airing of social grievances. You wouldn’t be wrong, but you also wouldn’t be painting the whole picture.\n\nA gadfly of virulent proportions, Lunch has been a creative force since the 1970s when she moved to New York City and became a fixture of what eventually became known as the No Wave and Cinema of Transgression movements.\n\nAlongside her in those times was Beth B., a filmmaker just as intertwined with those movements as Lunch. Together they made such underground classic films as BLACK BOX and VORTEX.\n\nNow, some 40 years on, they’ve collaborated again with the documentary LYDIA LUNCH: THE WAR IS NEVER OVER, which was completed in 2019 and is finally being released post-pandemic via Kino Lorber. Less a biography and more an exploration of the motivations and politics of Lunch’s art, THE WAR IS NEVER OVER doesn’t just give a retrospective-style look-back, it provides a modern contextualization. It’s not just about what Lunch did—it’s about why she did it. And more importantly, why she’s still doing it; why her words and art are just as relevant now than ever.\n\nIf not more so.\n\nNever answering to anyone but herself, you might not agree with everything Lydia Lunch has to say—and there’s never a doubt that she’ll say something you won’t. But at the same time there’s no denying that she’s got a razor sharp mind behind it and even sharper tongue saying it.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with both Lydia Lunch and Beth B., not only about the new documentary, but about their decades of collaboration, the fluidity of art, the strange and often ugly economics of independent cinema, and why Barack Obama was a cocksucker.\n\nTo say I was a bit intimidated would be an understatement.\n\nRaphael Jose Martinez (RJM): So I watched the film, and I really, really loved it. As I was saying to you, Beth, before Lydia joined us, I’ve been a fan of both of you and your work since I was teenager getting into more, for lack of better terms, alternative or non-mainstream art. You two have known each other quite awhile at this point and have been collaborating…\n\nLydia Lunch (LL): Longer than you’ve been alive, my friend.\n\nRJM: [Laughs] Yes. That is actually true.\n\nBeth B. (BB): Frightening facts, that’s right.\n\nRJM: So what drew you together to do this project now?\n\nBB: For me it had to with a full circle. When I first came to New York, Lydia was one of the people who inspired me greatly and in some ways I felt like it was important for younger people to understand the history of what Lydia was about, what that scene—the No Wave scene—was about. And to really use that as a pivotal point to explore a lot of the themes that Lydia has worked on and the themes that I have been involved with [through] my films as well, and the way that they have kind of coincided with each other.\n\nLL: I think it’s interesting to do it recently, when we did it and it’s released now, considering what we just came out from under in the last five years of bullshit—with both the idiocy of Diaper Donnie Trump, his malignant sexism, anti-everything except for rich, dumb cunts, and also between the snowflaking of the new puritanical-ism, and the Cardi Bs, something has got to be making sense. I wouldn’t say in the middle of this, but outside those both extremes.\n\nBB: I think it’s also that so many of the issues that were brought up in the late 70s, especially the ones that Lydia has talked about on and on—patriarchy, power, control, abuse of power—those things are 100% relevant today. It’s not like those things have gone away. And some people just don’t really know the history. So they think these are things that have manifested just recently, but in fact it is the history of centuries…\n\nLL: The world.\n\nBB: The world. Absolutely. Internationally. Not just this country.\n\nLL: Forever. And this is one of the issues that really perturbs me greatly—and which is why I will still continue to be the woman on a hill with a bullhorn—is the political nonsense. Not just in America but in so many other countries. ‘Cause I think these are, and they always were, feudal times. There are always people who think they're kings, more so even now—fewer, with more money—having so much money that ten men have more money than most countries. The non-abolition of slavery, having left the plantation and now turning most people into slave-wage laborers—fuck you Jeff Bezos. There are just so many issues to me—which is why I could open my mouth to talk about my own issues—that these are historical, and hysterical, and ever non-ending problems.\n\nRJM: That makes sense to me because I grew up… well, I didn't grow up…\n\nLL: Neither did I!\n\nCF: My twenties were the Obama era, and I had so many friends and so many people who were older than me being like, “Everything’s changed! It’s so much better than it was!” And at the time I was living in a small, rural town in southern Illinois with the last name Martinez—and I knew that it wasn’t different for me. That if cops pulled me over I’m fucked.\n\nLL: Not even how you look, but your last name. Not even if you did look more like a Martinez.\n\nRJM: I had circumstances where they felt tricked; “How do you look like this and have that name?!” The politics actually haven't changed.\n\nLL: Well, I call Barack Obama “The Beige Puppet.” Because we had hope, but it was false hope. Or as Kafka said, “There is hope, but not for us.” First of all, I think he was kind of almost a plant in the sense that, well, he was discovered out of Harvard like so many of these other people that go on to exploit other countries. And he might have been used as a kind of place holder while America was actually becoming more fascist and authoritarian. But here we had a little, as we often do, ebb and flow. We thought Bill Clinton was good at first. Then we realized his “three strikes, you're out.” Barack Obama, I don't think he’s evil—I think his wife is much better—but I think it was allowing us a little false hope while they were doubling down on the dirty deeds done behind our backs.\n\nRJM: Yeah. He’s to the right of Nixon, policy wise. And I was trying to explain this to my immigrant parents who are saying, “Finally, there's not a white person in the office!”\n\nLL: It’d be great if there was actually a black man, not a beige puppet, in the White House.\n\nBB: Part of the problem is that it’s all corporatized. Everything is corporatized. So you can’t even see beyond the politics of the corporations that control everything.\n\nLL: Look, he was another cocksucker of the bankers.\n\nBB: Yeah, all of them.\n\nLL: And we knew that right away. He proved that right away. I think we need to abolish anyone who makes over $150,000—they should not be in fucking office. Because they don't know how the rest of us live. They're still complaining about $15 an hour wages?! How fucking dare you. How dare you.\n\nRJM: That just happened last week here in Chicago, where the city raised it to $15 an hour…\n\nLL: Oh! How generous! How about firefighters on the west coast? They only make $15. Firefighters?!\n\nRJM: Or when they don’t want to pay them they just get prisoners to do it. That is literal slave labor.\n\nBB: There you go. Slave labor.\n\nLL: Our gulags. Anyway… back to the doc.\n\nRJM: [Laughs] Well I wanted to speak on, not necessarily the doc itself, but the corporatization of film and music. Because in the doc, Lydia, you talk about the idea of taking the reigns of producing everything yourself, how that was the ethos you lived by. I know you, Beth, have done the same thing…\n\nLL: Well, we also didn't have much of a choice. And we continue to do it. But carry on with the question…\n\nRJM: Is it even possible to do that in the same manner anymore? Because nowadays I think the internet has democratized the availability of art, and the access to art, but at the same time you’ve got to upload your movie to Google’s YouTube. Or you’re using Facebook, or Facebook’s Instagram. So you have more independent control, but it’s still on somebody else’s leash.\n\nLL: Well, I’m glad whoever owns or runs YouTube exists because I’m happy that people in Taiwan, or Romania, can see some of what I’ve done. I never got into doing what I do thinking that there was going to be a big fucking paycheck. And the people that complain about that are always the richest motherfuckers. Now, I don’t like Spotify because I think they’re a total ripoff—and I don’t know what of my material is on there, but it’s gotta come off. But I think with YouTube, it just seems more like a weekend teenage party to go look at some stuff. But neither of us have had much help. Beth may have gotten more grants because she’s applied for them. I’ve never applied for a grant, and it’s maybe to my detriment, but look, I’m trying to sell my intellectual property rights out of a cultural guilt trip to the people who are paying $150 million for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Hi. Really?!\n\nBB: I mean, it’s interesting for me in terms of cinema. It’s really been kind of a roller coaster ride in terms of cinema. Because we know that in the 80s [and] 90s there was some support for independent filmmaking. But a lot of it was coming from Europe. That was where the support was because they were much more open minded, and they see cinema as being an art form. They do not see that here in the United States. There has always been that battle, and I finally got fed up with that fucking battle in the 90s when I finally finished a feature film, TWO SMALL BODIES, and there really was nothing. All the funding in Europe had dried up for American filmmakers, and there was nothing here, and the studios started saying, “Oh! We have an ‘indie’ studio now.” So they, in a sense, usurped the arena that the indie filmmakers had occupied. At that point I was like, “Ok, how do I survive?” I ended up going into television. I produced and directed documentaries in television.\n\nLL: Crime TV!\n\nBB: [Laughs] Yes! Crime TV! It was great!\n\nLL: I live and sleep by crime TV!\n\nBB: It was amazing. Court TV. So I ended up working for about eight years in network television, and I was choosing my own subjects, etc. And in the beginning, which was around the year 2000. But over the course of that, then what happened? The corporatization of everything. And suddenly I had these committees that I had to appeal to started censoring… “Cut this. Cut that.” So I was back in that loop, and I had to get out of there. So I got back into the underground. I said, “Ok. I’m doing it again. My way. That is it.” So in a way I stopped battling. It’s not like I’m making any money, but at least I have the satisfaction of making the films the way I want them, choosing my subjects. I mean, I still choose subjects that are still very underground, edgy—I mean you can’t get edgier than Lydia…\n\nLL: I’m soft around the edges!\n\nBB: [Laughs] You are! And that’s what I wanted to show in the film, a much more comprehensive and complex [laughs] portrait of Lydia. It wasn’t about making a “biography” of her..\n\nLL: A biopsy.\n\nBB: They can go on the internet and see it all. But it was a forensic biopsy, yes. [Laughs]\n\nLL: But as Beth was saying earlier, if it wasn't for Europe I don't know what I would have done for the past 35 years of my career. Because I can bring anything that I do there, and most of it can’t do here. Hence in the documentary quite a few things are from European performances. And also going back to the corporate nonsense… that’s why Beth—I don't know how she managed to do it, but did—managed to raise a lot of the money for this movie on Kickstarter. Which is a democratic format. I’ve never gone and done that. I’m not against doing that. I just think that whoever has the money should give the money. But that's just because I’m what? A communist?\n\nRJM: It’s just so strange that we’ve literally gone back to patronage.\n\nLL: I’m not against it.\n\nCF: Neither am I.\n\nBB: It also reminds me of the reason why I got into making film instead of art. I was like, “Ok. This incorporates all the arts within it.” And I was so sick of specialization. It made me want to vomit. And the preciousness of art. And I thought, “You can get someone on the street to pay $3 to see a movie.” That was in the 70s, 80s. In a way Kickstarter is very similar. People are putting in small amounts of money to be able to have something that is not readily available to them. And in some ways I hate doing the Kickstarters, cause they knock the shit out of you. You have to be doing it 24 hours a day for 30 days, and be completely dedicated to raising that money. But it’s satisfying in that you then have these odd kinds of partnerships with people you do not know, yet they become part of your network.\n\nLL: And they're the ones who really want it. Whether it’s $5, or $50, or $500, it’s amazing. They give to what they feel is a worthy cause.\n\nRJM: I agree. I’ve had some long conversations with people about that when Kickstarter and Indie-A-Go-Go kind of first started appearing on the scene. I used to be the editor for the magazine Maximum Rocknroll years and years ago.\n\nLL: Oh yeah. [Laughs]\n\nRJM: And that magazine was a very puritanical punk rock thing of, “This is. This is not.” Drawing lines. And there were genuine questions as to whether or not it was appropriate to do that. And I was like, “What’s the difference between getting the money from the people that are going to be buying the album directly, or the movie directly, or getting it from a record label?”\n\nLL: I’ll tell you what the difference is. The difference is that you’re not going to owe those people anything more than the products are already going to make anyway.\n\nRJM: That’s a very good point.\n\nLL: With a record company you might owe them five more years of your life, after they rip you off with ridiculous amounts of expenses. I wouldn’t know, I’ve never had a record deal like that. I don’t deal with those kind of criminals.\n\nRJM: Tying this with the kind of corporate stuff as well… you two are very associated with the Cinema of Transgression and No Wave, obviously, and it’s one of those movements where you get the statement, “It could never happen again.” And that happens with every art movement, where afterwards everyone says, “You couldn’t do that again.”\n\nLL: Ok. Ok. Look. It’s only a movement in retrospect.\n\nBB: Exactly.\n\nLL: And also, there have been movements. The Viennese Actionists, the Surrealists, the Dadaists. That’s what I most closely related to. So to think that it can’t come again? I don’t know. I mean, what exactly is it that can’t come again? Extremity? Weirdness? D.I.M.—do it myself, or D.I.Y.—do it yourself? What is it that can’t come again? I don’t believe that. I believe everything is cyclical. We’ve just been in a really bad phase of music for a while but we’ve been in a great phase for television, because that’s where it seems so much art with music, with lighting, with directing, with dialogue, is right now—as opposed to major motion pictures. When I speak to people in their 20s sometimes they’re like, “Ughh, there’re no visionaries of my generation.” Well, look behind you, kid! And also look to architecture, look to science, look to other things. It’s not always going to be music. It’s not always going to be movies. It’s not always going to be books. Sometimes it’s going to be something else, and you’ve got to expand what might be intriguing and educational to you and what might speak to you.\n\nRJM: How strange is it to you—because I’m sure the questions of No Wave and Cinema of Transgression come to the two of you all the time during interviews—how strange is it to have to constantly reflect on art that you made when you were in your teens or early 20s?\n\nBB: We’re still making it.\n\nLL: Listen, darling, what I made was more than 30 years ahead then. Now they’re catching up. It’s very, very normal to me.\n\nBB: It’s also that, in my mind, It’s still going on. It’s not like I’ve stopped. The forms sometimes change. I work with film, I work with video installations, sculpture installations, all different forms—just as Lydia does. When I talk about my work, even of the 70s or the 80s, it’s not like I’m going back. It’s an ongoing dialogue. And what I find fascinating is looking back at some of the other films and understanding in a way how sometimes they’re very autobiographical, they’re very much of that time. But like we were talking about earlier, they’re not just of that time because these issues do not go away. We have to keep looking at them from different perspectives, put a different lens on—of 2021—in terms of where we are heading, but also being able to reflect back on the history to understand where we have come from.\n\nLL: I also think that when you mention both No Wave and Cinema of Transgression, both of them relating very heavily to New York at a certain period, now I feel that there are people that are scattered around that are still quite No Wave, or are still quite extreme artists, [such as] Slava Mogutin, Weasel Walter, Tim Dahl… there's a variety of people both in music and in literature that are still extreme. It’s just that they're not all gathered in one place. And because even the nature of journalism is very different, it seems like there are a lot more online magazines. But if we even go back to Maximum Rocknroll time, or my teenagehood when there was Creem magazine, Rock Scene, Circus, Rolling Stone—occasionally—Playboy magazine for great interviews even, or Spin—originally—there were at least these kind of publications that we could kind of trust to focus and tell us a few things. Now there are so many culture, fashion, art, music, film, diversified multi-art medium magazines online, but it’s not like when we would actually go out and buy a magazine, hoping to find that one nugget that really spoke to us. I think there are people out there—and this is why I do my own podcast, The Lydian Spin. This week is the two year anniversary, 104 episodes. It’s bringing in people that are doing stuff now, filmmakers, writers, musicians—and who have been doing things—and just trying to continue what I have always done, which is trying to collaborate with people, expose people to other people, and just carrying on with that. So to me it just makes a lot of sense. And Beth was saying originally that this was feeling like it’s full circle? Well, it’s full circle to me, ‘cause this feels like a continuation of this, our documentary, is like the podcast and the documentary I’m working on now which is ARTISTS — DEPRESSION, ANXIETY & RAGE. Which I’m only doing the interviews. And it’s kind of why I started doing and saying what I said in the beginning. It’s ‘cause it isn’t only about me. I was dealing with bigger, universal issues and now I’m turning the microphone on, so far, 35 other musicians and artists so suffer from… fortunately things I do not suffer from, I don’t have depression or anxiety, but most musicians and creatives do for numerous reasons. So again, this all makes sense to me of where Beth and I are right now—and Beth has been on my podcast as well—it just makes sense that this is what’s happening right now in our sphere. It’s important to our times, but then again I’ve always felt important at any time – especially in my own time and my own mind.\n\nRJM: How has the pause in the past year that COVID created affected all the stuff that both of you have been doing?\n\nLL: To me? Nothing. ‘Cause I wasn’t planning on touring. I was planning on going out with this film. So I had one show that was canceled because I had just toured with Retrovirus to the west coast, Australia, and did the last show in New York. And now I just did one of the first shows in New York last Friday. I was working on promoting THE WAR IS NEVER OVER, working on my podcast, working on my documentary, and teaching workshops. So it was very psychically creative. I still did two albums in the meantime—no reason to release them yet. So it was fine timing for me. Beth was a bit disappointed, but now whatever slack we faced, it’s racing forward.\n\nBB: What I find fascinating is that I felt that year was an extraordinary time for me to be able to reflect on what I have been doing, what I want to be doing. So I think that things like that, at least for me, I could take it and actually use that time to be productive in other ways. So in some ways it relieved that pressure of, “We’ve got to get the film out now!” So I actually was able to mentor my daughter, who at that time was 17 [and] was writing a feature length script. I think that in the same way that Lydia was looking outside of herself at other people, and what they were experiencing, I felt that I was, in a way, doing the same thing with my daughter. What her story is is very different than my story. Where she’s coming from, very different. And it’s a story that really needed to be told, and she felt like she wanted to do that. So the idea of being able to mentor somebody who was very young, to be able to bring out… again, it’s what’s not seen and not heard. And that’s always been what my work has been about, bringing voice that are on the outside into a form that can be communicated to others. So it was extremely gratifying to be able to do that, and also prepare everything for the movie. In some ways we were so prepared for this moment, I mean, I was getting really impatient, but again, the situation ended up coming full circle because Kino Lorber, during this time, actually asked me if they could start to restore and distribute my catalog of films. And as they started to do that they said, “Oh! And of course we want to distribute your new film.” So they took it upon themselves to restore everything that I’ve done and using Lydia’s movie as the catapult to start a movement towards re-examining the early films and my entire oeuvre. So that opportunity would not have been here without the pandemic. How odd.\n\nLL: I’m never impatient by the way. Like one of my philosophical heroes, the Marquis de Sade. 300 years later people still don’t get what the fuck he was talking about. And it wasn’t only the sex, let me tell ya. So I’m not impatient at all.\n\nBB: I’m glad you weren’t, Lydia. [Laughs]\n\nLL: “Calm down.” The thing I don’t want anybody to tell me. “Calm down.”\n\nRJM: I had one last question. In THE WAR IS NEVER OVER you had a quote that stuck out to me where you said, “Trauma is greedy.” And I remember reading in an interview years ago a similar quote that said “pain attracts pain.” Talking about this year where basically the world paused because of mass trauma and mass death, what do you think is going to be the response to that if trauma attracts trauma, pain attracts pain? Collectively as a world there’s no denying that we’ve been watching people drop dead in numbers we can’t even imagine.\n\nLL: Well, I mean, in a horrible way I have to say…. not that I wanted 600,000 people to die ‘cause Trump’s a fucking idiot, not that I don’t think the whole world should have shut down for a month instead of a year and a half because he couldn’t get it together. I think that when people are finally coming of the horror—’cause a lot of people were suffering, obviously, either with COVID, the fear of COVID, people dying, being locked down— and I hope that as they start coming out, and things start opening up, that we’re still extremely fucking careful, that they’re going to have a better appreciation of what really matters. And how important it is to have joy, beauty, humor, fun, laughter, friends, community, art—sex. I hope it just makes people appreciate more, because I feel that not only is trauma and pain greedy, but this fucking country is greedy. And we need to roll back some of what we expect to just land on our doorstep. And that’s really important—it’s a lesson that I had to teach myself. When you are such a glutton for whatever it is, food, sex, drugs, all the above, alcohol, or in my case adrenaline, you have to reel it back at one point and go, “To fill the void within only the self will suffice.” So learn to love yourself peeps, like I love myself, and then you’ll all be a little more like me, Lydia Lunch. And the war, it never fucking ends.\n\nBy Michael Glover Smith\n\nImagine a feminist take on the Hollywood teen comedies of the 1980s, one that examines how the trauma and grief engendered by a missing person’s case can reverberate through an entire society – strengthening the bonds between some characters while exacerbating the tensions between others. Now imagine that film being lit like a giallo and punctuated by a capella musical numbers. Can’t do it? That’s probably because KNIVES AND SKIN, the splendid second feature by writer/director Jennifer Reeder, doesn’t look or sound like anything you’ve seen before. The locally made film, produced by Newcity’s Chicago Film Project, has taken the festival world by storm ever since its World Premiere at the Berlinale at the beginning of 2019. KNIVES AND SKIN will open at the Music Box Theatre for a theatrical run beginning, appropriately enough, on Friday the 13th. I recently spoke to Jennifer in person about her cinematic and literary influences and her singular approach to editing, lighting and music.\n\nMichael Glover Smith: I loved your film. Are you tired of the TWIN PEAKS comparisons yet?\n\nJennifer Reeder: No, I’m not, I’m not! There are other comparisons that have not come up that I am very thankful for. But TWIN PEAKS is not one of them.\n\nMGS: I think TWIN PEAKS is the greatest thing ever but your film is very different, stylistically and narratively. The comparison does seem valid in the sense that they both have central mysteries that serve as a narrative hook: In your case, the disappearance of Carolyn Harper allows you to go into all of these different homes and paint a portrait of an entire community. Was the concept of a missing girl always the point of origin for you?\n\nJR: No, the starting point was actually wanting to write a story about a group of girls who had been very close when they were younger, like maybe in middle school, and had grown apart, and something happens to them that sort of forces them to be friends again, to come back together. I wanted to make a gentle, girl-power film, you know? I had made a bunch of short films leading up to this that were suggesting coming of age is a lifelong process, and sort of dealing with the lives of adolescent girls. There was often a dark element. But with KNIVES AND SKIN, I was driving back to Ohio to see my mother along this rural two-lane road - very typical of that area, or all of the Midwest, really - and sort of imagined these three goth-punk girls walking along that road - on their way to band practice, on their way to school, on their way home from school - and just knowing that there are kids in small towns all over the country who feel like misfits in their environment. They feel like misfits in their own skin but they actually look like misfits in their environment. I thought that was a great visual analogy for so many people who feel like they’re at a crossroads in life. So I started thinking about who those three girls are and what is about to happen to them that will change their lives forever. It’s such a typical moment in small towns: If someone, in particular a young person, goes missing, it gives the entire town an excuse to drop everything and refocus their lives - oftentimes in a way that transforms their lives, and everyone can exorcise their own psychosis and obsession through this other event. I feel like that general structure is what I liked about TWIN PEAKS: All those psychotic threads among the townspeople led back to Laura Palmer. But I was also influenced by RIVER’S EDGE, and that film did the opposite thing: That dead girl became a fissure through the lives of these young people but she was much more invisible than Laura Palmer. So it’s kind of fusing those two stories. But in terms of the world of David Lynch, I actually feel much more influenced by BLUE VELVET.\n\nMGS: I thought about that while watching KNIVES AND SKIN.\n\nJR: The kind of unraveling of another horrific mystery, and those two main characters trying to figure out what exactly has happened, and lots of other people are involved, and the mistrust in the town… Or even something like LOST HIGHWAY I feel has this really great way of suggesting these parallel worlds. For some people that can be a very frustrating experience but I really love how he creates this kind of plot-maze and oftentimes the plot is like a staircase that goes nowhere. It’s like a funhouse.\n\nMGS: A puzzle with no ultimate solution.\n\nJR: Correct. Some people don’t like it at all. I find it wickedly entertaining.\n\nMGS: I thought about BLUE VELVET in terms of your production design. One thing Lynch does that I think is amazing, which you also do in a different and more female-centric way, is he makes films that are very culturally specific that are also universal and timeless. There are large sections of BLUE VELVET that feel like they could be taking place in the 1950s but then one little detail will snap you back into the present. Like Kyle MacLachlan’s earring will make you realize, “Oh, wait, we’re in the ‘80s.” Your film is similar because so much of it seems like it could be taking place in the ‘90s or the ‘80s or the ‘70s.\n\nJR: I really tried to eliminate phones but there’s one scene where you realize they all have smart phones.\n\nMGS: Right, when everyone gets the text from Carolyn. Well, it’s not very cinematic to see people spending a lot of time on their phones!\n\nJR: Right. I did that on purpose. I wanted it to feel frozen in space and time. The ‘80s sensibility has a lot to do with my own autobiography but also the ‘80s were such a delicious time for teen films. So this is a film that sort of knows it’s a teen film. It has a kind of self-consciousness about it. And there’s something about ‘70s Italian horror, the colors of that, which felt really relevant. And then I think, certainly, there’s a kind of ‘80s club-kid fashion that exists among some of those girls.\n\nMGS: A lot of high-school fashion is timeless: The letter-jackets, the cheerleader uniforms, the band uniforms…\n\nJR: Correct. Yeah, and I wanted those characters to feel iconic or emblematic. Not so much like caricatures, although maybe when you’re first introduced to them you think you know them: You think you know who a cheerleader is, you think you know who a girl in the band is, you think you know who the jock is. But I also wanted for those expectations of those characters to unravel over the course of the film.\n\nMGS: You were successful in that. Speaking of the ‘80s, I saw that someone recently compared KNIVES AND SKIN to Kathy Acker and that you were happy about that. I imagine Blood and Guts in High School must’ve been formative for you?\n\nJR: Yeah, absolutely. It was super-cool to have a literary reference for the film. And, in that same tweet, Audra Lorde was mentioned. They’re very different writers but both, rest in peace, my queens. I feel like I’ve been deeply influenced by literature as much as by other films. And I think there have been so many female writers who have taken on the same subject matter as this film - a kind of abject approach to femininity or a kind of toppling of a patriarchy or dealing with gender and race in a very pointed way. People have asked me a lot about women and genre and “Isn’t this an interesting time for women in genre because so many women are taking it on or being handed opportunities to deal with genre?” But people forget that, in terms of literature, Mary Shelley invented Frankenstein.\n\nMGS: As a teenager!\n\nJR: Yes, exactly! Or Daphne DuMaurier, from Rebecca to The Birds to My Cousin Rachel and on and on. Or Patricia Highsmith. We could go on and on. There are so many women in literature who have dealt with such complex subject matter in terms of female identity.\n\nMGS: And, in Acker’s case, female trauma.\n\nJR: Female trauma, for sure. So that comparison, it just felt like that was exactly my audience. Not that I went into this thinking about Blood and Guts or thinking specifically about Kathy Acker but I do feel like I have these kind of wicked angels on my shoulder when I go into telling certain stories. And Audra Lorde and Kathy Acker are both right there along with me.\n\nMGS: Let’s talk about this film as a portrait of the Midwest. It feels very Midwestern but I couldn’t tell if you cared exactly where it was set. Is it Illinois? Is it Indiana? Is it Wisconsin? Is it Ohio? It could be any of those places.\n\nJR: Correct. So many of the films that I’ve written - almost every single one of them - in my brain, the landscape is Ohio, which is where I grew up. However, I’ve been living at the border of Illinois and Indiana for longer than I lived in Ohio, actually. And I will never not write films about the Midwest even if it’s more of a city film rather than a rural film. There was a time when we thought about shooting this in Louisville, Kentucky. Someone who was interested in producing it was living in Louisville. And that seemed interesting to me but then it also occurred to me I know nothing about Louisville, Kentucky. And perhaps even setting it in Kentucky and thinking about it as being Southern Gothic rather than Midwestern Gothic, I didn’t really know what that world was. So I wanted to set it in a place where it’s unidentified. The high school is Big River High School and that doesn’t even identify the state that they’re in. And I don’t presume that the Midwest owns refineries or quarries, you know? But it also feels like that kind of landscape - the refinery, the quarry, a river running through a town - does feel Midwestern. And there’s something about the sort of awkwardness and stubbornness of the people in this film that also feels Midwestern. It also felt really important that this film is not a city film but yet it’s very inclusive in terms of the cast, wh"
