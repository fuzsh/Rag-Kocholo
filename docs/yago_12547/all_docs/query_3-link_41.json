        "text": "I guess if PARIS VU PAR… had used the ROGOPAG naming convention it would be called CHADOGOPORORO, which is pretty good. Apply this to all compendium films. What’s your favourite result? TWILIGHT ZONE: THE MOVIE would be LALASPIDAMILA, if you count the intro and outro.\n\nI was excited to find a copy of PARIS VU PAR… back when it was a very rare film. It was a VHS tape with a faded hand-lettered label I discovered in a semi-abandoned cupboard at my place of work, Edinburgh College of Art. Whoever it belonged to had apparently departed the building, literally or maybe also metaphorically. When inserted into a VCR it proved to be unsubtitled, and also a homemade telecine achieved by projecting the movie on a door. I didn’t watch very much of it.\n\nNice to see it looking so spruce here!\n\nThey saved the heavy hitters, Godard and Chabrol, till last, though JLG’s credit is shared, ambiguously, with Albert Maysles, and I don’t quite know at what height Chabrol’s fame was hovering, since it took him a while to arrive at the “French Hitchcock” tag (which is an unhelpful label in many ways). He was just coming off a previous anthology film, LES PLUS BELLES ESCROQUERIES DU MONDE with Godard, Hiromichi Horikawa, and Gregoretti (who was the G in ROGOPAG), which I guess should be called CHAGOHOG.\n\nJLG & Maysles first.\n\nWe have the stunningly beautiful and very thin Joanna Shimkus (Mrs. Sidney Poitier) and a really good sculptor who makes abstract figures out of scrap metal. Camerawork is handheld, as in the Rohmer episode, but at least the camera takes advantage of its untethered position to rove about and explore the scene. So it behaves like a documentary. We do catch a glimpse of a movie light, but you can put that down to the Verfremdingseffekt if you like.\n\nIf it’s been scripted, not too much brilliant work has been done: Shimkus says things like “Do you love me?” and “Do you think I’m pretty?” The sculptor gets to talk about his work.\n\nThere is a little bit of mystery/suspense going on — Shimkus has begun the film by sending a pneumatic telegram which she now evidently regrets. What’s in it? Seems like this rugged sculptor is the intended recipient.\n\nIt’s actually a fairly neat plot, even if it doesn’t amount to much. Shimkus has sent messages to her two lovers, but has mixed the envelopes up. When she confesses this to her sculptor he’s initially accepting, then thinks about it a bit and throws her out. She proceeds to lover number two, Roger the mechanic, who runs a body shop. He’s already received the letter. She gives the same explanation she tried before: she wasn’t really proposing a tryst in the letter, she wanted to break up with the guy so she had to meet up with him, there’s nothing too it really.\n\nThere’s a twist in the tale, and then we’re done. Along the way we’ve had moments of silence, music, and a few street shots to establish the locale. And a brief view of a bar signposted as “For artists and intellectuals” — I’m prepared to believe it’s a real joint.\n\nChabrol also has a movie star, his partner and muse Stephane Audran. He also has himself, so the pair of them play the parents of a slightly disturbed child. The adults’ incessant bickering drives the boy to insert a pair of extraordinarily effective ear-plugs. Godardian silence and Chabrolian tragedy or maybe black comedy ensue. I have a feeling this one doesn’t entirely come off, but it looks nice. There is some wobblycam in the exteriors (filming without permits, perhaps?) but the interiors have a nice wide angle quality. Though the colour is attractive these compositions would probably look better in black and white.\n\nChabrol gives himself more closeups than he gives to the elegant Audran. You know how he likes to pull faces? We get a bit of that here.\n\nLa Muette, the district of Paris chosen for this one, is also a pun on MUTE, I guess.\n\nUsually in compendium films you get a director who’s absolutely on fire to show you what they can do, and somebody else who’s phoning it in, and one or two in-betweens. This one’s odd because everybody seems pretty laid back. Maybe that’s the influence of being at home in Paris. And the nouvelle vague is pretty cool, pretty chill generally — though it also had a lot of energy which you don’t get much of here.\n\nNestor Almendros shot the Rohmer, whose camerawork I disliked, but also the Douchet, which was decent-looking. Oh yes, and here’s an intertitle, also from the Rohmer.\n\nChapter one of the anthology film PARIS VU PAR… is directed by Jan “who he?” Douchet. This compendium features some heavy hitters and some no-names who presumably were enjoying a moment in 1965.\n\nJust looked up Douchet — he wasn’t really having a moment, but he made lots of film documentaries for the telly, and he was a critic at Cahiers du Cinema so he knew the right people. Everyone else at Cahiers was getting into movie-making, so why not him? He was also a prolific actor — he was in Verhoeven’s ELLE in 2016. I should read his stuff.\n\nStill, his film is not hugely interesting. Diverting while it’s happening, but doesn’t leave you with much. The best part is maybe the opening, in which a fairly dry documentary about St. Germain des Pres which slowly picks up nouvelle vague quirks (a female VO reading signs starts breaking into the sonorous male VO) before bleeding into the fiction story.\n\nAn American girl hooks up with an attractive young man with a fabulous apartment, but the next day she’s pursued by another young man who has the same car, the same apartment, and seemingly the same parents…\n\nThe story has possibilities but I don’t feel like it really explores them. Ultimately it felt a bit chauvinist, as nouvelle vague films often do.\n\nJean Rouch, known for his ethnographic films, helms the installment on Gare du Nord. After the establishing shot this one unfolds as a truly remarkable long take until its final moments when there’s another cut, Handheld, with a hidden cut I think midway but visually apparently unbroken. And all this in a tiny apartment (and then out onto the streets) with the exposure balanced so the windows still show a view without turning into a white glare.\n\nOn top of this stunt, the film is very well acted (including by the producer, Barbet Schroeder, who plays a major role). The dialogue is pretty good — we begin with one of those domestic arguments that flare up out of nowhere. An attempt is made to make each character have their good and bad points. But the wife, Nadine Ballot, is discontented. About everything. She accuses her husband, Schroeder, of looking like Churchill. That’s pretty bad.\n\nWhen she heads to work she meets a handsome stranger who offers her all the things she’s been vocally dreaming of in her complaints to hubby. This gets pretty ridiculous, to the point where you wonder if hubby has hired an actor to tempt her or something, but no such naturalistic explanation emerges and eventually the stranger leaps off a railway bridge when she rebuffs him. That’ll show her.\n\nRouch would make his name in documentaries and on this evidence he was no screenwriter. Claude Chabrol, who contributes a later episode, said that a lot of auteurists thought the director had to be able to write, which was not the point at all. Rouch should have hired a screenwriter.\n\nNext up: RUE SAINT DENIS by Jean Daniel “who he?” Pollet, and PLACE DE L’ETOILE by Eric Rohmer."
