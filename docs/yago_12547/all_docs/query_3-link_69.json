        "text": "Every movie referenced at the end of Damien Chazelle’s ‘Babylon’\n\nHistorically, any story that dissects the history of Hollywood in all its glory is a shoo-in at the Academy Awards. Looking back at the last decade of the awards show, the likes of David Fincher’s Mank, Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Damien Chazelle’s La La Land have each been nominated for ‘Best Picture’. So, when Chazelle released Babylon last year, it was predicted to be a big Oscar hit.\n\nStarring award darlings Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt, the divisive frenetic drama tells the story of the ambition and excess of early Hollywood. Tracing the rise and fall of multiple characters during an era of depravity, Chazelle’s film is scored to a familiar jazz soundtrack that thumps a racing pulse and helps to drive a story that flounders for over three hours, saying nothing particularly innovative.\n\nThis might explain why the movie has been largely snubbed by the awards show, given nominations only for three technical categories: ‘Best Achievement in Production Design’, ‘Best Original Score’ and ‘Best Achievement in Costume Design’. Aside from this trio of nods, the film has been ignored from all the major categories, including ‘Best Picture’, ‘Best Director’ and more.\n\nOf all the movie’s outrageous moments and frivolities, it is the climactic montage scene that is getting the internet talking. Lured in by the magnetism of the movies, Diego Calva’s Manny Torres visits a cinema to watch Singin’ in the Rain, enraptured by the progressive feat of creativity, the character is then treated to a century-spanning montage of numerous iconic films from across the history of the moving image.\n\nInterpreted as a celebration of cinema by some and the reflection of a long-troubled industry by others, the sequence includes a collection of eclectic movies that span the whole spectrum of world cinema. Starting at the dawn of the moving image, the montage begins with the pioneering work of Eadweard Muybridge in the late 19th century, whose series of cabinet cards, in the form of The Horse in Motion, paved the way for modern filmmaking.\n\nAs the frantic sequence, scored to Justin Hurwitz’s sizzling soundtrack, increases in speed, we are treated to short clips from some of the greatest filmmakers of the early 20th century, including D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin and Oscar Micheaux. Making sure to include each and every major innovation in the history of cinema, Chazelle picks movies like The Wizard of Oz, which introduced wider audiences to Technicolor, as well as more obscure short films like 1979s Sunstone, a pivotal release of early computer animation.\n\nGoing through the final sequence of Babylon, we’ve compiled a list of every movie referenced. Listing every movie in the chronological order in which they appear in the montage, take a rapid tour through film history below.\n\nEvery movie referenced at the end of Babylon:"
