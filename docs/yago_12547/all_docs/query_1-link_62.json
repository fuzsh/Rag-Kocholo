        "text": "The Film Noir Foundation is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit public benefit corporation created as an educational resource regarding the cultural, historical, and artistic significance of film noir as an international cinematic movement.\n\nIt is our mission to find and preserve films in danger of being lost or irreparably damaged, and to ensure that high quality prints of these classic films remain in circulation for theatrical exhibition to future generations.\n\nThat's the high-toned legalese. Here are the facts: Even as the high-tech revolution lets us own vast film libraries on DVD, the risk grows greater all the time that 35mm prints of some films will fall into disuse and eventually disintegrate—especially lesser-known titles that have slipped through the cultural cracks, but are worthy of rediscovery.\n\nAs a focal point of the classic film noir revival, the Foundation serves as a conduit between film companies and repertory cinemas still eager to screen these films in 35mm. Revenues generated by ticket sales encourage studios film archives to strike new prints of films that are at risk of disappearing from public view, either through neglect or scarcity. Once these films are unearthed and returned to circulation, the chances exponentially increase that they will be reissued on DVD, available in pristine, affordable form for future generations of film-lovers.\n\nSince 2005, the Film Noir Foundation has saved the following films:\n\nRestorations\n\nCry Danger (1951)\n\nThe Prowler (1951) – Funded by the FNF in conjunction with the Stanford Theatre Foundation\n\nTry and Get Me!

James Norman \"Jim\" Beaver, Jr. (born August 12, 1950) is an American stage, film, and television actor, playwright, screenwriter, and film historian who is familiar to worldwide audiences as the gruff but tenderhearted prospector Ellsworth on the HBO Western series Deadwood, among many other roles including Lawson the gun dealer on Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. In 1978, while in college, Beaver published his book on the actor John Garfield: His Life and Films.

Back in 1988 when I first became obsessed, it seemed like few knew what film noir was here in the UK. So it would usually be just me and a small bunch of moody loners (male and female) who'd go to a regular evening at a flea pit in North London. Three films for a couple of bucks (or pounds here). Such fun... A pity NOIR CITY only happens in the U.S. Oh well, maybe one day I'll get over... — Henry Jaremko\n\nJust wanted to start by telling you that I am extremely happy to have found your Foundation. I am 38 years of age, and for the last few years I have become a fan of 40s and 50s movies. My parents are Greek. They moved to Australia before I was born, and the fact that I am a Greekimg Australian who loves old movies is rare.... I have my parents to thank—especially my father, because he always had great enthusiasm whenever Bogart or Cagney was on the television. I have your NOIR CITY e-magazines, and they are nothing short of amazing... Thank you for your time and thank you for saving the greatest years of film. — Daniel Sarantidis\n\nI just sent you $100 via Paypal. But I missed the \"send message\" link. I have contributed before, and I wish I could do so more often.
