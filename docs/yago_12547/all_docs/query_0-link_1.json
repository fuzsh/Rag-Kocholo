        "text": "Based on a novel of the same name — one that was also the basis of Claude Chabrol's 1969 film This Man Must Die) — The Beast Must Die is an overheated Argentine noir about a man mourning his dead son through murder.\n\nVirtually everyone in the film, apart from the two small boys, is either objectively awful, or dismissed by the film for their weakness. The men are violent, calculating, or willful cuckolds, while the women are helpless victims, seductresses of married men, or hateful shrews. The fact that Felix Lane (Narciso Ibáñez Menta) a cold, calculating, manipulative murderer is the movie's hero tells us everything we need to know about the world in which it is set.\n\nOpening…\n\nNoirvember #9\n\nThe opening half hour of The Beast Must Die seems to actively belie its noir nature. A monstrous patriarch is killed mid-rant, and suddenly we’re in the mist of a whodunnit as an inspector questions those present until secrets upon secrets are exposed. Poison, a damning diary, a hidden identity, all of it intriguing but without context at the moment.\n\nThen Narciso Ibáñez Menta takes centerstage as our gripping lead during the extended flashback that is the bulk of the runtime. And thus this Argentinian noir becomes a shadowy, brooding saga of tragedy and vengeance. Effectively a Monte Cristo-esque thriller where a broken man is hardened by grief into a calculating manipulator, infiltrating his quarry’s most inner circles.…\n\nGorgeous Argentinian noir told with a quintessential Latin hyperbolic emotional passion. The filmmaking is solid — the camera movements have elegance. The strongest section is for sure the hit and run scene followed by the father discovering the kid’s dead body, set on a wet road near the foggy coastline with surprising editing choices and artful compositions. The kaleidoscopic montage in the aftermath is delightfully psychedelic. The standout of the movie is knockout Laura Hidalgo, an all time beauty in the peak of her radiance, who is perfectly costumed throughout and delivers a fabulous over the top performance that still felt real. Only wish the story had pulled me in more on an emotional level."
