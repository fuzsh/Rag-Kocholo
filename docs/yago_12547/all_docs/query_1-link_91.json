        "text": "The Film Noir Foundation is a non-profit public benefit corporation created as an educational resource regarding the cultural, historical, and artistic significance of film noir as an international cinematic movement. It is our mission to find and preserve films in danger of being lost or irreparably damaged, and to ensure that high quality prints of these classic films remain in circulation for theatrical exhibition to future generations. That's the high-toned legalese. Here are the facts: Even as the high-tech revolution lets us own vast film libraries on DVD, the risk grows greater all the time that 35mm prints of some films will fall into disuse and eventually disintegrate—especially lesser-known titles that have slipped through the cultural cracks, but are worthy of rediscovery. As a focal point of the classic film noir revival, the Foundation serves as a conduit between film companies and repertory cinemas still eager to screen these films in 35mm. Revenues generated by ticket sales encourage studios film archives to strike new prints of films that are at risk of disappearing from public view, either through neglect or scarcity. Once these films sare unearthed and returned to circulation, the chances exponentially increase that they will be reissued on DVD, available in pristine, affordable form for future generations of film-lovers. The Film Noir Foundation has funded and produce restorations of the following films: \"Cry Danger\" (1951) \"The Prowler\" (1951) – Funded by the FNF in conjunction with the Stanford Theatre Foundation \"Try and Get Me!\" (1951) \"Repeat Performance\" (1947) - Funded by the FNF in conjunction with the Packard Humanities Institute \"High Tide\" (1947) - Funded by the FNF in conjunction with the Packard Humanities Institute \"Too Late for Tears\" (1949) \"The Guilty\" (1947) \"Woman on the Run\" (1950) \"Los tallos amargos\" (1956) \"The Man Who Cheated Himself\" (1950) \"Trapped\" (1949) \"La bestia debe morir\" (1952) \"El vampiro negro\" (1953)\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.filmnoirfoundation.org/news.html\n\nExternal link for The Film Noir Foundation\n\nIndustry\n\nMovies, Videos, and Sound\n\nCompany size\n\n2-10 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nAlameda\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n2005\n\nSpecialties\n\nFilm Restoration and Film Festivals"
