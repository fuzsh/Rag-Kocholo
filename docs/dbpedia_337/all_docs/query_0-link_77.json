        "text": "Shortly after a 48-12 season-ending loss in the District 2 Class 3A semifinals to Wyoming Area, Lake-Lehman coach Jerry Gilsky tried to put the season in perspective.\n\nThat’s not an easy task for a coach whose spent more than three months with some student-athletes who played their last football game ever.\n\n“Eight-win season. Credit it to our guys. They did a hell of a job,” Gilsky said. “The effort and the talent we showed out of this group, (and) the seniors did an excellent job.\n\n“Overall this year I was impressed with our guys, what they did, how they fought. They worked hard all season.”\n\nGilsky took over the program in 2010. Hard work wasn’t associated with the Black Knights back then. He replaced Carl Kern, who cited a lack of commitment by the players for his resignation after four seasons.\n\nKern was an old-school coach who played for the legendary Woody Hayes at Ohio State. Whatever buttons Gilsky pushed, they were the correct ones, and he turned the program around.\n\nConsider the 10 years prior to Gilsky taking over. Lehman had just two winning seasons, bottoming out at an all-time worst 0-10 in 2006. He brought stability and wins to a program that had three coaching changes in a six-year period.\n\nIn Gilsky’s 10 years, Lehman has made the postseason nine times, played for a district championship three times and won the D2-2A title in 2013.\n\nGilsky gave plenty of credit to Wyoming Area after the loss. But with plenty of talent coming back, a concession speech might not come so soon in the 2020 season.\n\nCOUPLE OF COMMITMENTS\n\nDallas’ Luke DelGaudio and Berwick’s Eric Montes recently made their college commitments to Division I programs via Twitter.\n\nDelGaudio, a receiver/defensive back, will be playing at Bucknell next fall. He had 32 catches for 485 yards and six touchdowns during the regular season.\n\nMontes will play at Delaware State. He has been considered one of the top defensive linemen in the WVC the past few seasons and also saw action as a fullback where he scored a pair of touchdowns prior to the postseason.\n\nWQMY BROADCAST\n\nWQMY will be televising the District 2 Class 4A championship game between Valley View at Dallas on Friday.\n\nAlthough this was thought to be the final telecast of the season, sports director Bob Ide said WQMY will also have a playoff game the following weekend.\n\nPREP-WA ON FACEBOOK\n\nWhile there will be no TV coverage of the District 2 Class 3A championship game between Scranton Prep and Wyoming Area, the game can be heard on Facebook.\n\nWyoming Area Football Alumni will have audio-only coverage of the game on its Facebook page. While the group provided both audio and video for regular-season games, District 2’s telecast fees ($3,000 for a championship game) are obviously too much to absorb.\n\nSURPRISE LOCATION\n\nDistrict 2 champion Delaware Valley and District 6 champion State College will meet for a third consecutive year on Friday in the first round of the PIAA Class 6A state playoffs.\n\nThe previous two games were played at Danville High School, so it was surprising to see Friday night’s game with be at Hazleton Area’s Harman-Geist Memorial Field.\n\nEven though the stadium is a District 2 site, State College will be traveling only about 30 more miles to the game than DelVal.\n\nHOW THEY’RE DOING\n\nFive of the six teams which won state championships in 2018 will still be playing in Week 13. Here’s a look at where the defending champs stand:\n\n• Defending Class A champion Farrell (10-2) has made an amazing run since losing its first two games. The Steelers (horrible nickname) posted nine consecutive shutouts, which included a 42-0 win over West Middlesex in the District 10 semifinals and a forfeit victory over Cambridge Springs in the quarterfinals. Cambridge Springs cited the lack of healthy players for the forfeit.\n\nFarrell plays D5 champ Tussey Mountain (11-1) on Friday.\n\n• Southern Columbia (12-0) steamrolled Towanda 75-0 and North Penn-Mansfield 42-0 on the way to the Class 2A title game in District 4, where it will play Mount Carmel (10-2). The Tigers won the regular-season matchup 48-0 in Week 2.\n\nAgainst Towanda, Southern Columbia ran nine offensive plays in the first half and scored on eight of them.\n\n• Aliquippa (11-1) picked up where it left off last season, which ended in the Class 3A state title. The Quips, though, could see their season end Saturday in the D7-3A title game with Central Valley (11-1), which won the regular-season meeting 45-6 in Week 10.\n\n• In Class 4A, D10 champion Erie Cathedral Prep (10-2) defeated Fort LeBoeuf 56-0 and University Prep 42-6 in a subregional tournament with District 8. The defending Class 4A state champion gets D6 champion Bellefonte (9-2) next. The Ramblers’ only losses were to a pair of teams from Ohio.\n\n• Penn Hills (10-2) won the Class 5A state title in 2018, but is the only defending champion to pack away the equipment. The Indians lost 35-20 to McKeesport in the D7-5A quarterfinals last weekend.\n\n• St. Joseph’s Prep (8-2) won the Philadelphia Catholic League title with a pair of lopsided wins and plays Philly Public League champ Northeast (11-1) for the District 12 Class 6A championship.\n\nPrep is vying for a fourth consecutive trip to the Class 6A state title game. Its only losses are 21-17 to Georgia power Marietta and 31-25 to football factory IMG Academy of Florida."
