        "text": "Radio station in Marietta, Ohio\n\nWMOA is a Class C radio station which broadcasts at 1490 kHz, with its signal originating from the city of Marietta, Ohio. The 1000-watt station covers much of the Mid-Ohio Valley, which includes parts of Southeastern Ohio and Northwestern West Virginia around the cities of Marietta and Parkersburg, West Virginia.\n\nWMOA began broadcasting as an experimental station in September 1946 from a garage in Williamstown, West Virginia, across the Ohio River from Marietta. The station, upon receiving a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license, relocated its broadcast studios to the basement of the historic Lafayette Hotel in downtown Marietta. The studios relocated again to the Citizen's Bank Building during the latter part of the 20th century before settling at their current location on Lancaster Street in Marietta.\n\nThe station currently advertises itself as \"Local Radio\" and features a variety of generally local interest broadcasting. The station is currently affiliated with ABC Radio for national news updates, and broadcasts live sporting events for nearby Marietta College. Besides ABC News updates twice hourly, the station features local on-air talent and Adult Contemporary music for the bulk of their broadcast day, The station primarily provides coverage of the Cincinnati Reds and Ohio State University football, but also airs Cleveland Cavaliers, Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Guardians, Ohio University Bobcats football, and local high school sports broadcasts.\n\nOfficial website\n\nFacility details for Facility ID 54265 (WMOA) in the FCC Licensing and Management System\n\nWMOA in Nielsen Audio's AM station database\n\nFM translator"
