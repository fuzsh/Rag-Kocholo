        "text": "PARKERSBURG – Those who depend on WPBY’s digital broadcast for their PBS television may have found their signal strength lacking or missing over the past few weeks.\n\nThat is because Parkersburg’s local West Virginia Public Broadcasting channel is operating at approximately one-third normal power, said Jim Dennison, senior engineer for W.Va. PBS.\n\nCable and satellite viewers of local PBS programming should not experience any problems, he said.\n\nThe transmitter, located on Lost Pavement Road between Parkersburg and Mineral Wells, sustained an equipment malfunction about two weeks ago, Dennison said. That malfunction appears to have been caused by a lightning strike, Dennison said.\n\n“I don’t know when (the lightning) could have hit, but I know of nothing else that can take out three power supplies at once,” Dennison said.\n\nThe transmitter is powered by a bay of six power supplies, Dennison said.\n\nThe suspected lightning strike ruined three of them.\n\nThis reduced the broadcasting strength of the television station from 1,200 watts to 450 watts, Dennison said.\n\nThe suspected lightning strike also interrupted power to WVPG, West Virginia Public Radio 90.3 Parkersburg, Dennison said. Repairs for WVPG were easy to arrange and full power has been restored to the radio station, he said.\n\nAlthough the WPBY television station is still broadcasting, its normal range has been reduced by about one-half because of the loss of the power supplies, Dennison said.\n\nThis has prevented some viewers from receiving the signal, while others have reported distorted or weak signals, Dennison said.\n\nThe power supplies are no longer manufactured, Dennison said.\n\nPower supplies made by other manufacturers will not fit the transmitter, making replacements hard to come by, Dennison said.\n\n“We are searching for repair facilities to restore the three units, but we have had no luck yet,” Dennison said Tuesday.\n\nAny repairs made to the units must fall within the regulations of the Public Broadcasting network, Dennison said.\n\n“Once we find someone who can repair them, it will take about two weeks to get them running again,” Dennison said.\n\nIf the power supplies cannot be repaired, the only option would be to replace the entire transmitter, Dennison said.\n\nWhen it is at full power, WPBY broadcasts to all of Wood County, the western halves of Pleasants and Ritchie counties, most of Wirt County and northern Jackson County in West Virginia.\n\nIn Ohio, it serves most of Washington County, southeastern Morgan County, eastern Athens County and northeastern Meigs County.\n\nThere is no estimate for full restoration of broadcast strength, Dennison said."
