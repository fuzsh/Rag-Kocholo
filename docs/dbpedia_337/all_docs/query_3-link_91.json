        "text": "Dear Radio Babe: Subject: Old Time Radio.\n\nI read your column, even though I sometimes do not understand it.\n\nYou see, I am several generations from you.\n\nI started (in) radio when I was a part-time student at Ohio State University in Columbus in 1946. How I longed to be \"on the air.\"\n\nOne day when our boss was out, I talked the on-duty announcer into letting me make the break (everything was live then). I said, \"This (is) WCOL, Columbus, Ohio.\"\n\nI was so thrilled my voice had gone out on the air!\n\nMy boss returned, really angry. He had heard it. He called both of us into the office and we were almost fired.\n\n\"Don't you know,\" he asked, \"that women's voices are not welcomed on radio?\"\n\nI fooled him.\n\nIn the '70s, I had a talk show for 11 years with 22 faithful sponsors.\n\nThank goodness women's voices are welcome on radio and everywhere! -- Sally Hille, Nokomis\n\nDear Sally: Radio Babe is so very pleased to make the acquaintance of an original radio babe!\n\nAnd although R.B. typically keeps writers' identities anonymous, after reading your note, she wanted to share parts of your (Google-searchable) radio history with the readers, because, yes, Sally, you're a radio legend!\n\nR.B. found a 2006 article, \"WMOA Celebrates 60 Years with Sally Hille,\" about Marietta, Ohio's WMOA (1490 AM), in which author Andrew Rex interviewed Hille. (See it at said, \"Sandy (Guyer, the station's original owner) and I got to talking about a woman's show. There weren't any women's shows. Actually, back when I started in radio, women's voices were not welcomed on radio.\"\n\nShe started \"Sally's Social Corner\" and did \"Weather With Sally,\" some of which were recorded from her home studio --a bathroom -- prior to acquiring a new home.\n\nNostalgically, the WMOA Web site shows a picture of Hille seated at a vanity in front of her notes, microphone in hand, wearing a bright pink dress; a matching wall sink juts out behind her. (See here: in media as a whole, but especially by putting out a living \"voice\" to a captive public and leading where none had tread previously.\n\nYou go, girl!\n\nNow, about not understanding R.B.'s modern topics sometimes ... be sure to ask questions! Although the medium has advanced in (some) complex directions, R.B. will provide answers -- but you must ask first.\n\nDear Readers: Last week, someone told a story about Sirius Satellite Radio CEO Mel Karmazin. About his fiscal hypervigilance, and how that reared its head during his CBS New York reign. Karmazin reportedly ordered the previously 'round-the-clock WCBS employee cafeteria to shut down on weekends despite hundreds who worked there, and in a district where it was difficult to find eateries.\n\nHere's a letter referring to that story:\n\nDear Radio Babe: Subject: Mel and the cafeteria.\n\nI enjoy reading your column every week and wanted to confirm the story about Mel shutting down the cafeteria ... which used to be open 24/7 and now closes at around 6:30 or 7 p.m. weeknights! A real pain when I'm working up north!\n\nThat said, though, the radio division is not better off without him.\n\nJust look at some of the idiocy that's happened within the CBS-owned radio stations during the past couple of years (WCBS-FM in New York, for example) under the Hollander brothers. Best -- P.K.\n\nDear P.K.: Thank you for the compliment and Karmazin confirmation.\n\nAs for the Hollander brothers, R.B. isn't sure what their roles are, having kept her focus on Southwest Florida. All she knows is that WCBS (101.1 FM) is still the much-derided (and poorly rated) JACK FM after switching from 43 years of oldies.\n\nDirect queries and comments to Radio Babe c/o the Herald-Tribune, P.O.
