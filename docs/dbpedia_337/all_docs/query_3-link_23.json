        "text": "PARKERSBURG — The History Channel hit television series American Pickers plans to film episodes throughout Ohio in August.\n\nAmerican Pickers is a documentary series created in 2010 that explores the world of antique “picking.” The show follows skilled pickers in the business, as they hunt for America’s most valuable antiques.\n\n“We’re looking for leads throughout the state, specifically interesting characters with fascinating items! The way we find people and collections for our show is through spreading the word far and wide so that people know we’re coming to town,” Associate Producer Joshua Kerlin said. “We are looking for different, unusual, and unique items – something we’ve never seen before with an extraordinary story!”\n\nThe show is no stranger to the area as they have visited multiple times over the years including a visit to the former Hunt’s General Store in Cottageville in 2022. The store, once owned and operated by Lawrence Otho “L.O.” Hunt, was a catch-all place that sold milk, groceries, hardware, guns, appliances and clothing. It was also a butcher shop. The building is now owned by his grandsons Brad and Bruce Hunt.\n\nThe show said they hope to give historically significant objects a new lease on life while learning a thing or two about America’s past along the way.\n\nThey said the Pickers have seen a lot of rusty gold over the years and are always looking to discover something they’ve never seen before. They said they are ready to find extraordinary items and hear fascinating tales about them.\n\nThe Pickers do not pick stores, flea markets, malls, auction businesses, museums, or anything open to the public.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a unique item, story to tell, and is ready to sell, send them your name, phone number, location, and a description of the collection with photos to: americanpickers@cineflix.com or call (646) 493-2184 facebook: @GotAPick"
