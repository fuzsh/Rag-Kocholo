Figured it must be because my Samsung tv is too old so I tried the browser method which seems to work but the buffering circle never ever goes away. It's playing well and everything but the circle doesn't go away ðŸ˜‚ Help please\n\nToday when casting to my Android TV there's no volume from multiple video files, and this is the first time I've experienced this in years. Other casters like VLC etc seem to work but WVC is usually the most reliable. Any fix?"
