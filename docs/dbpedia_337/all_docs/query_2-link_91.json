        "text": "Stream Health\n\nHow do you know if a stream is healthy?\n\nModerate\n\nNot Messy\n\n5-10 Minutes\n\nOutdoor\n\nCheck the health of a stream!\n\nWe rely on healthy bodies of water to sustain our environment. Can you tell if a stream is healthy? Take the temperature, check the water clarity, and look for signs that your stream is supporting life around it with these activities.\n\nWatch the video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/cfu3gJ37ls4\n\nYou Will Need\n\nA thermometer\n\nA clear cup or secchi disk\n\nWaterproof shoes\n\nA container to hold small creatures. Ice cube trays work well!\n\nMaterials & Directions PDF\n\nDirections\n\nWatching the Stream Health Video\n\nIf you want to make a secchi disk, you can either use a white paper plate and black tape or a white lid and a black permanent marker.\n\nUse the Stream Health Chart to answer the following questions.\n\nTo check the temperature of your stream, first try it with your hand.\n\nNext, use your thermometer to get an accurate temperature. We used a floating thermometer designed for a pool.\n\nNext, you want to look at the water itself. How would you describe it?\n\nYou can make a simple secchi disk with your clear cup and a waterproof marker. Or you can make something a little bigger depending what you have on hand.\n\nPut your secchi disk in the water. Can you still see the pattern? Does the white still look bright white?\n\nMake observations of the living things in and around your stream.\n\nDo you see any signs of animals living around the water?\n\nWhat kinds of plants do you notice near your stream.\n\nWhat about in the water? Scoop out some water into a container or ice cube tray. What do you observe?\n\nDo you think your stream is healthy?\n\nSee First Investigation of Stream Health (F.I.S.H) to learn more.\n\nDiscovery Questions\n\nWhy is it important to pay attention to the health of streams in our area?\n\nAlthough water may seem to be all around us, potable water (water that is safe and clean to drink) is only a very small percentage of the water on earth. Many water sources are polluted from human actions such as industry, agricultural practices, and suburban lawn care. Protecting our water sources is not only important for humans, but also for other organisms we share our ecosystem with.\n\nWhat are some ways we can monitor stream health?\n\nWe can monitor stream health with simple observations of the area as well as taking temperature, using a secchi disk to test for transparency and water purity. We can observe vegetation around the stream and look for signs of healthy wildlife in the area. Noticing signs of wildlife such as scat or footprints, tells us that the area is healthy enough to support an active ecosystem.\n\nWhat are some ways we can monitor and help restore streams in our areas?\n\nBecoming a citizen scientist through programs like First Investigation of Stream Health (FISH) is a great way to get involved. You can go to the FISH website to get started.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nStream health is important to clean water, recharging groundwater that supplies our local wells and reservoirs. Our local agricultural industry depends on the health of water and riparian buffers.\n\nHealthy streams protect us from floods and provide habitats for native species keeping our ecosystem balanced.\n\nKey Words\n\nClarity\n\nA measure of how far light goes down through water.\n\nMacroinvertebrate\n\nSmall organisms without a backbone.\n\nSediment\n\nMinerals and debris that settles at the bottom of water.\n\nSecchi Disk\n\nThe black and white pattern of a secchi disk is used to measure transparency of water.\n\nRiparian Buffer\n\nArea next to a stream that acts as a border between the stream and human activity.\n\nPotable\n\nSafe and clean to drink.\n\nProduced by:\n\nIn collaboration with:\n\nBrought to you\n\nwith support from:\n\nPromotional\n\nCollaborators:\n\nThe Pennsylvania State University Â© 2024 Privacy and Legal Statements"
