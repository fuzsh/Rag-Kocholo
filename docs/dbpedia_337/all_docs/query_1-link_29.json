        "text": "The Ohio History Connection provides free access to over 1,000,000 full-text searchable pages of Ohio newspapers through Ohio Memory and the Library of Congress’s Chronicling America. Our newspaper digitization program is supported by partnerships with local institutions as well as grant funding, including the National Endowment for the Humanities’s National Digital Newspaper Program (see NDNP-OH for more information). See the list below for links to titles and date ranges currently available online. Looking for another title? Search our online collections catalog to see what’s available on microfilm or hardcopy, or download our list of digitized Ohio newspapers freely available from other sources (Excel or PDF).\n\nTip: Use the Up and Down arrows to sort the list alphabetically bytitle, city, county, region or special press type, or chronologically by date. To find what you’re looking for even faster, try usingthe search box directlyabove the table. For example, to find all digitized Cleveland papers, type in Cleveland, and your results will automatically only include entries with the word “Cleveland.” Please note that this search box only searches the list below and not the actual newspaper pages."
