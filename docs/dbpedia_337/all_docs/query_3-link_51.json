The stories are about the early days of the detective bureau through the nineteen nineties and beyond involving cases of kidnapping, murder, organized crime, mob hits, decapitation murders, drug wars, and other crimes with an unusual twist in many instances. They include the largest single-family homicide in U.S. history, a mass shooting by a sniper, and contract murders involving drugs and revenge. A description of the crime rate in each decade gives an overview of the major cases that follow in detail.",
