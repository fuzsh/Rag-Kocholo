I tried to listen in on both frequencies with an Icom T70 HT but heard nothing at all. This morning the scanner is still picking up signals on both frequencies every few minutes but no sound.\n\n447.700 is a ham frequency. WVC is on 800 MHz trunked. Do you have the UCA trunk system programmed in your Pro-197?\n\nSent from my Pixel XL using Tapatalk"
