Virtual Camp ZOOM User Guide Download Go to Schedule Frequently Asked Questions Quotes History Camp Photo Library What is “All Ages Virtual History Camp”? Over the past few years The Castle has received numerous requests to make our renowned History Camp classes accessible beyond our 3rd – 6th grade audience. In 2021 we successfully launched our first “All Ages’ version of History Camp. We are excited to be doing our second offering this year! This year’s “All Ages History Camp” will be a little different than a traditional camp. For the convenience of our “campers” we have broken the camp into just a couple classes a week over four weeks. This virtual experience is geared toward ages ten and up. Each week will feature two classes with bonus classes offered some weeks. Activities will cover various topics related to the era of 1880 – 1900 including Marietta’s 1888 centennial celebrations, the Spanish American War, cultural shifts, and the political atmosphere surrounding Senator Theodore Davis, owner of The Castle 1888 – 1917. You can choose to register for individual activities or the entire camp. Planned interaction between campers and teacher/presenters Classes and activities for camp will have interactive elements. We have especially engaging presenters this year who are excited to provide engaging, interactive content to keep the campers attentive and involved. Payment, Registration, & Using Zoom Each activity will take place using Zoom. You can choose to register for individual sessions which peak your interest, or register for the full camp at a discounted rate. Individual sessions are priced at $5 per class or $35 for all eight classes, including free access to any bonus classes. Registering for the Week? To begin, click on the “Full Camp - $35” button below. After completing the payment process, you should automatically receive via email information for connecting to all classes. Remember to save this information. Registering for Individual Classes? By clicking “Register,” you’ll be taken through the payment process. After payment, you’ll be able to register for classes through Zoom. Next, you’ll receive an email with instructions to log-in, after it has been manually approved by our Zoom administrators. You should receive this log-in information in less than 12 hours. Remember to save this information. We suggest registering at least 30 minutes in advance of each class. We would suggest campers have the assistance of an adult to log-in. For assistance with the registration process or using Zoom please reach out to us at education@mariettacastle.org or call 740-373-4180. Receiving Information & Updates – Important!
