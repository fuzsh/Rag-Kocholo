        "text": "DAVE & DEB\n\nMornings 6am-10am\n\nDave Gunderson\n\nA Utah man am I. Born and raised in Salt Lake, I graduated from Cottonwood High School and attended the University of Utah with my focus in Broadcast Journalism. I’ve always had a love for music and the gift of gab, which led me to a 30 year career in radio and TV doing on-air, sales, marketing and promotions throughout Utah. Round one with KSOP was in 1990 for 5 years and round two started in 2010 doing Afternoon Drive eventually leading to what is now “Dave and Deb” in the Morning in 2011. I love country music, the outdoors, sports and my family. I’m married with 4 kids and living the dream.\n\nDeb Turpin\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City and raised in Kaysville. Graduated from Davis High School…go Darts! I attended Weber State University and the University of Utah where I studied French, Business, Police Science, IT and Psychology…haha…yeah I know. Then I thought about becoming a veterinarian, until I remembered the math skills required for that. I grew up listening to KSOP and music has always been my go-to in life. With some obvious trouble focusing on one college major, I asked myself what my dream job would be? Radio! There weren’t really any openings here, but I came in several days in a row and begged! I started working as the landscaper and promo gopher. I became the Music Director in 1991 and have added the responsibilities of Program Director in 2009 and Morning Show Co-Host in 2011. I love my family, my friends, my dogs, food, Cheese Fix, Netflix, documentaries, movies, country music (really, most music) and cowboy boots and shoes. I have way too many. It’s a privilege to bring new music to Utah radio and have fun on the air every day.\n\nCJ\n\nAfternoons 3pm – 7pm\n\nI was born and raised in West Valley City, graduated from Hunter High class of 2000. I became interested in radio at the age of 8. My father was in the radio business for more than 50 years and helped me get my start here at Z104 in 1997 as a board Op and I have been learning the ins and outs ever since. I enjoy concerts, movies, cars, food, and just hanging out with good company. I love the fact that I get to work with the public in so many ways and hopefully bring a lot of entertainment and fun into peoples daily lives!\n\nTRACY CHAPMAN\n\nEvenings 7pm – Midnight\n\nTracy Chapman a market veteran, since 1975. Tracy has spent the majority of his radio years in country music. One of his greatest influences in country radio is KSOP’s own Country Joe. In his spare time you can find Tracy boating, camping and riding ATVs with his family and friends, or running his sound and entertainment company with his brother and kids. Tracy is a lover of dogs and animals which is why he chooses to live in his mountain community where on a daily basis there is a sighting of a moose or deer, and critters of all kinds. Tracy is happy to finally be working with some of his best friends here at Z104 including Gentlemen Jim who he has known for nearly 40 years now! Country music is his favorite format because the artists are so in tune with their fans. Keep it live and local as heck on Z104!\n\nBIG AL\n\nMidnight to 6am M-F and Weekends\n\nI was born and raised in Granger, Utah (WVC). I came from a family Of 4 brothers, no sisters. My parents owned and operated Bill’s Auto Wrecking in Hunter in the 70’s. That’s where I get my love for cars, I guess. I graduated From Kearns High Class Of 1990…Go Cougars! I met a great guy At KSOP – John Greenwell, in 1985. I met John after losing my Dad at age 15. My love for radio began in 1985 with John teaching me about the radio business. I started out as a board operator helping out at the Utah State Fair and doing fill-in here at KSOP-FM in 1995. I enjoy being on the air entertaining all the night owls weeknights Midnight to 6am. I enjoy country music, going out to eat, TV Shows like The Dukes Of Hazzard, C.H.I.P.S, The Fall Guy, Knight Rider, and I Told Ya I Was A Car Nut! I enjoy Monster Truck Shows, Top Fuel, Funny Car Racing, and spending time with my wife and our 2 dogs.\n\nPORTIA\n\nWeekends\n\nPortia was a theater major in Salt Lake City in the late eighties/early 90s when she ran into a DJ at her talent agency in 1991. Next thing you know she was DJing for KJQ in 1992 then proceeded to work for X96 alternative rock from 1993 to 1998 and from 2004 to 2009.
