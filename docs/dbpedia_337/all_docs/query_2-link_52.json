I am three weeks away from graduating college, which is insane to think about. However, the time is now. A time that is greatly appreciated by football fans all over the country. It is NFL Draft season. The prospects are off the charts this year at positions like edge rusher, wide receiver and cornerback. With the madness that this off-season has created only time will tell to see who will come out of this draft victorious. Last year I did a full seven-round mock draft. I predicted all 259 picks in the draft. For time sake I don’t know if I’ll do that again. I guess it will just depend on how the first round goes. Without further ado, let’s start the official YSN 2022 NFL Mock Draft.\n\n[et_pb_tabbed_posts_agsdcm posts_per_page=”6″ show_thumbnails=”on” show_author=”on” show_categories=”on” show_date=”on” disabled_on=”off|off|off” _builder_version=”4.9.10″ tab_font=”Roboto Condensed|700|||||||” tab_font_size=”18px” main_title_font=”Roboto Condensed|700|||||||” main_title_text_color=”#1c1d1f” main_title_font_size=”18px” list_title_font=”Roboto Condensed|700||on|||||” list_title_font_size=”18px” border_color_all=”#1c1d1f” global_colors_info=”{}”][et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm ignore_displayed_posts=”on” _builder_version=”4.9.10″ global_colors_info=”{}”][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm][et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm category_id=”438″ _builder_version=”4.4.6″ global_colors_info=”{}”][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm][et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm category_id=”24″ _builder_version=”4.4.6″ global_colors_info=”{}”][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm][et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm category_id=”18″ _builder_version=”4.4.6″ global_colors_info=”{}”][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm][et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm category_id=”5″ _builder_version=”4.4.6″ global_colors_info=”{}”][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm][et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm category_id=”433″ _builder_version=”4.9.10″ _module_preset=”default” global_colors_info=”{}”][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_tab_agsdcm][/et_pb_tabbed_posts_agsdcm]\n\nLISTEN TO WVCW ON THE GO\n\nSupport wvcw\n\nCollege radio is one of the last outlets for creative radio programming and a training ground for the future of the industry.\n\nWith your help we can keep the students on the air for years to come.\n\nSTUDIO SPOTLIGHT\n\nMarch Madness is Coming\n\nJoin the WVCW Sports Team as they count you down to March Madness!
