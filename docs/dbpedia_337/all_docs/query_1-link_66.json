        "text": "Mason Beuhring: It’s such a pleasure to sit and chat with you, Carol. Would you mind starting with your background; where you are from, your family, and your time before coming to Marietta Community Foundation?\n\nCarol Wharff: I’m from Marietta and graduated from Marietta High School in 1981. After graduating from the University of Cincinnati with a degree in business, I returned to Marietta.\n\nMB: What did you do upon returning to Marietta?\n\nCW: I married a fellow Tiger, John Wharff. I also decided to enhance my business degree by earning a teaching certificate from Ohio University. At the time, I had planned to pursue consulting and business workshop-type work and believed a teaching background would help me communicate and get my message across, but I mainly worked in sales and marketing. Years later, when the Foundation position became available, I decided to interview and was offered the position.\n\nMB: What made you decide to take the position of Executive Director in 1998?\n\nCW: It had purpose behind it, something that I could really wrap my head around. I had served on quite a few boards at the time as well, so I had an idea of how the not-for-profit world worked. I was aware the Foundation was awarding grants and I was excited to be a part of that work. There was also a great Board. The Foundation has always had a great Board!\n\nMB: You have kind of a unique perspective because you were an Executive Director, but you’re also a donor. How does one perspective influence the other?\n\nCW: It was an easy decision to become a donor. I saw firsthand all the great things that the Foundation was a part of and all the ways it supported Marietta. My husband has always been community-minded and when we eventually bought the radio station, we knew that we were here permanently and wanted to be able to give back to the community. I don't know if my children will end up here later on in life, but if they do I want to make this the best community possible. I loved the idea of giving in perpetuity; that you can still be giving back beyond your lifetime.\n\nMB: How did this perspective help with your new position at the Foundation?\n\nCW: I never looked at it like I was selling something, rather I was educating people on the Community Foundation. If someone was already a supporter of Marietta, then it was easy for them to see the benefits of giving through Marietta Community Foundation. It was rewarding to make that connection.\n\nMB: Now you also have a unique perspective because you’ve been the Foundation’s Executive Director twice! What made you transition out and then eventually come back?\n\nCW: I made the decision to step down from ED to a part-time position after my son was born. With my part-time position, I was still working with donors and helping with the grant cycle process so when the opportunity arose, and the Foundation was seeking a director, I was fortunate enough to be able to become the ED again.\n\nWhen I left for the final time, I knew it was time. My kids were at the age that they had activities and games so many days of the week and I wanted to get more involved at their school. I also knew and was confident in the ability of Heather Allender and knew she would be able to step in and take the Foundation to a whole new level. I love keeping up with her and listening to what’s happening. I love to brag about MCF’s board and the great people involved with the Foundation, and now, my husband is on the board and I enjoy listening to the news about MCF from a board member’s perspective!!\n\nMB: What did you gain most from your time at the Foundation?\n\nCW: Again, I loved the Board and I had nothing but respect for every person who served. I learned so much from all of them and still quote them to this day. I continue to use them as sounding boards. Bob Kirkbride had the ability to present both sides of a position and help guide the group along to the best decision for the organization. Bill Thompson was honest and straightforward and made us all laugh!! The two of them together were so invaluable!\n\nMB: You described your work before as ‘educating’ individuals on the work of the Foundation. What is one service that the Foundation gives to the community that you would like to teach others?\n\nCW: There are a lot of people out there that want to give, and they just don't know how, but the Foundation makes it easy. I think quite a few people look at the world and get overwhelmed with all the neediness and the Foundation can educate them on specifically how they can help and how to meet local needs. Donors can give money to a national program and a large percentage might go to operational costs or some of it might go to programming, you just don't know. The Foundation doesn’t charge an administrative fee and can help people understand exactly what is happening with their money. With the Foundation, you know all of your donation is going to help people in our community. That is a major gift the Foundation is giving back.\n\nMB: How does it feel to know that because of the work you and others put in, we now manage over 300 funds, our assets are over $40 million, and the total of grants given to the community have surpassed $22 million?\n\nCW: It makes me feel like I did something well. Bob Kirkbride would always say that we’re building relationships that we may not see come to fruition until 20 or 30 years later. It’s fulfilling to hear of different donors who are currently giving and to think about some of the relationships that I had with those donors. Perhaps I had an impact on their decision. It's great, especially where the world is today, to have a Foundation in such a small community to be at the size it is.\n\nMB: Carol, thank you for speaking with me! It’s been great to look at the beginning years of the Foundation, knowing where we are today.\n\nNew installments for our Executive Director Series will be published throughout 2021.
