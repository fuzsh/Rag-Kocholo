        "text": "Thank you for your reply. I followed your instructions to use the browser, when I did that and I put ctv.ca in to it I got an error message. I am using Chrome and my phone is pixel 6a. I then put firefox on my phone and I am getting the exact message that my browser is not supported.\n\nI think maybe part of the problem is ctv. I can watch ctv on my phone, ipad, desktop and laptop but the problem is I want to watch it on my tv.\n\nRight now I am using the hdmi cord to computer to watch till I can get this figured out.\n\nI also put on the companion receiver from Roku on my phone. I don't understand what it is or is not doing.\n\n@Carlynn\n\nGood to hear the laptop HDMI method is working for you.\n\nOk, regarding the Web Video Caster app. (WVC). You need to install the WVC app on your phone. The WVC receiver gets installed on your Roku device. This is how the WVC app communicates with your Roku device.\n\nYou need to launch the WVC app on your phone after you have installed it from the Play Store. When I mentioned that you enter the Web address into the built in browser, you need to enter the Web address into the browser feature of WVC. (not Chrome or Firefox. You need to use the browser that comes with WVC).\n\nRight on the top of WVC app, you will see a little box with a magnifying glass and the word \"Browse\". This is where you type in the Web addresses.\n\n----\n\nSounds like you are not launching the WVC app on your phone. Look at the links I posted in the previous responses and make sure you have installed Web Video Caster to your phone from the Play Store. Then, from within the WVC app, watch the tutorial on how to use . (Or look at the link I provided before).\n\n----\n\nI will try and post some instructions later tonite when I am in front of computer with some screenshots/images that may help you. (The free version of WVC works just fine, so don't feel compelled to purchase it until you learn what it can do and you have it up and running.)\n\n-----\n\nFeel free to update between now and this evening so I know what to address in the walkthrough.\n\nRoku Community Streaming Expert\n\nJust another Roku user... I am not a Roku employee.\n\nInsignia RokuTV, Ultra 4660, Premiere+ 3921, Express 4k+ 3941, Streambar 9102"
