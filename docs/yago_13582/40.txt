Becky Stark is the lead singer for the quartet Lavender Diamond. She talked about her writing and singing in a recent interview.

“I was hearing all this great beautiful music and I thought, What about all the people in the world that aren’t getting to hear this? And who is making the choice for it to be that way?

“Some artists say, The mainstream is not for me; that’s the domain of money. But what kind of punks and radicals are we if we are going to give up on our world like that?

“I mean, I know it’s very Pollyanna of me, but if you think you don’t have any power then you’re participating in the destruction of the world. Everyone has so much power, even if it’s what you choose to buy and how you choose to treat people.. Your life makes a difference – where you are and who you are and what you love makes a difference….

“I made a really conscious choice to make music for as many people that can possibly hear it. Part of the artistic meaning for me is making this music and sharing it with the world.”
