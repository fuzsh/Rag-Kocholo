        "text": "On the 125th anniversary of Commander's Palace on September 17, 2018 in New Orleans, there was a symposium on the growth of American cuisine. Topics included hospitality, technology, women in the restaurant industry and cocktail culture.\n\nWhat I said was that our past was a key to answering some or many of the symposium topics, and that 1983 was quite the year!\n\nIt all started for me in 1976.\n\nTHE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL DINNER\n\nSpenger’s Tomales Bay Bluepoint oysters on ice\n\nCream of fresh corn soup, Mendocino style, with crayfish butter\n\nBig Sur Garrapata Creek smoked trout steamed over California bay leaves\n\nMonterey Bay prawns sautéed with garlic-parsley-butter\n\nPreserved California geese from Sebastopol\n\nVela dry Monterey Jack cheese from Sonoma\n\nFresh caramelized figs\n\nWalnuts, almonds, and mountain pears from the San Francisco Farmers’ Market\n\nAMERICAN MENU FOR VENTANA, 1978\n\nInspired by the success of the 1976 dinner, and after I sold my part of Chez Panisse, and tempted to be the chef at Ventana in Big Sur, I proposed menu items. As a Celebration of America.\n\nWhile working for Time Life’s new series The Good Cook in 1978, I was staying at Richard Olney’s Solliès-Toucas house in the south of France while he was in London writing the series. But, as yet there was no full-time job for me in the series, so I was talking to the general manager of Ventana about one. I sent him a 4-page single-spaced typed letter with the type of food we could do to start a revolution in New American food.\n\nVirginia ham with California fruits\n\nChicken and pheasant hash\n\nPaso Robles peaches in local red wine\n\nMonterey Wild boar, walnut vinaigrette\n\nParsnip cakes with watercress salad\n\nRoast duck with Big Sur blackberries and green walnuts\n\nBraised Pigs’ feet or sheep trotters on johnnycakes instead of tortillas\n\nTurtle Cay bananas in rum with mango ice cream\n\nBlack bottom pie\n\nLUNCHEON ON THE TERRACE ASTOR MANSION\n\nAfter massive forest fires and highway collapses in Big Sur closed Ventana, I was back in the Bay Area, taking over Mark Miller’s Santa Fe Bar & Grill. It was soon a big success, and the word was out nationally. A N.Y. advertising agency asked me to do a little lunch at the Astor Mansion in Newport for their Ocean Spray client. The dinner was to be by the newly famous “butterless” French chef, Guy Savoy. The team from my Santa Fe Bar & Grill cooked this menu for 100 food and hospitality journalists.\n\nGrilled Fennel Sausage with Rangpur Lime & Orange- Cumin Salt\n\nGrilled Mixed Shellfish with Grilled Garlic & Ancho Chili & Herb-Shellfish Butter Sauces\n\nCranberry Puree Marinated Grilled Lamb Loin\n\nMixed California Vegetable Salad Cranberry Chili Relish\n\nGrilled California Goat Cheese with Garden Greens"
