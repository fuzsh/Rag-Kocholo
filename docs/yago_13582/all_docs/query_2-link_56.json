        "text": "ROBERT AINSLEY\n\nArtistic & General Director\n\nAinsley began his tenure as Artistic and General Director of The Glimmerglass Festival in September 2022. Demonstrating his commitment to new works, Ainsley launched Project Pipeline, an initiative that brings a new opera to life every season, either through a youth opera or a mainstage commission. In 2024, he made his orchestral debut in Glimmerglass’ production of La Calisto with his 2013 realization of the score.\n\nHe served as the Director of the Washington National Opera’s Cafritz Young Artists Program and the American Opera Initiative, seeking and training the finest young American singers, composers, and librettists for international careers. Artists he has worked with have performed on the world’s leading stages, won the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions, been finalists in Operalia, and performed with him at the 2018 White House State Dinner for the President of France. In 2020, he was featured in recital with world-famous soprano Renée Fleming for the Metropolitan Opera’s “Met Stars Live in Concert” series.\n\nHe is an alumnus of the University of Cambridge, Mannes College of Music, and the Lindemann Young Artist Development Program at the Metropolitan Opera. Since then, he has been Co-founder and Principal Conductor of the Greenwich Music Festival, a guest Chorus Master at English National Opera, Associate Music Director at Portland Opera, Head of Music Staff and Chorus Master at Minnesota Opera and Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, and a faculty member at Westminster Choir College’s CoOPERAtive Program.\n\nHe has collaborated on a string of world premieres, raved about art song in recital series of his own creation, and lectured on everything from Adams to Zemlinsky. Through it all, he has worked to inspire hundreds of young artists and thousands of audience members to share his passion.\n\nCheck out his Glimmerglass blog: Rob’s Ramblings\n\nJoseph Colaneri\n\nMusic Director\n\nRenowned for his versatility, musical depth, and ability to “inspire musicians”, Joseph Colaneri is recognized as a multifaceted presence on the podium. An international conductor equally adept with operatic, oratorio and symphonic repertoire, Colaneri continues to expand his relationships with orchestras and opera companies both nationally and abroad.\n\nColaneri first worked with Glimmerglass in 2009 as conductor for La Cenerentola, and he conducted the Festival’s new production of King for a Day in 2013. The Glimmerglass Festival appointed Joseph Colaneri as its Music Director, effective October 1, 2013. His other Glimmerglass productions include Madame Butterfly (2014), Candide and Macbeth (2015), La bohème and The Thieving Magpie (2016), and The Siege of Calais (2017).\n\nIn addition to his work with Glimmerglass, Colaneri has served as a member of the Metropolitan conducting roster since 1998. Colaneri served as Artistic Director of the West Australian Opera in Perth from 2012-2014. He also serves as Artistic Director of Opera at Mannes School of Music at The New School in New York City.\n\nDuring the 2015-16 season Colaneri led productions of Puccini’s Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera during the fall and Donizetti’s L’elisir d’amore in the spring. Colaneri made his conducting debut at the Metropolitan Opera with a performance of La bohème in fall 2000.\n\nHe conducted Luisa Miller in season 2001-2002 and conducted all of the popular Met in the Parks performances of Turandot with Andrea Gruber in season 2002-2003, L’Italiana in Algeri with Olga Borodina in season 2003-2004, Nabucco featuring Maria Guleghina in spring 2005 at Lincoln Center, as well as Rigoletto in the Metropolitan Opera Parks performances. In 2005-2006 he conducted Falstaff at the Metropolitan with Bryn Terfel in the title role. Continuing with the Italian repertoire, he conducted Il trittico in season 2006-2007. In the 2007-2008 Metropolitan Opera season, Maestro Colaneri conducted two of Donizetti’s masterpieces: La Fille du Régiment with Natalie Dessay and Juan Diego Flórez and Mary Zimmerman’s new production of Lucia di Lammermoor with Miss Dessay in the title role. During the 2009-2010 season he replaced James Levine for the Metropolitan’s new Luc Bondy production of Tosca, including the worldwide HD transmission and DVD for EMI. During the 2011-2012 season he led performances of Don Pasquale.\n\nAlso in demand as an opera conductor abroad, among the distinguished companies with which Colaneri has guested are Den Norske Opera, Portland Opera, Chautauqua Opera, Orlando Opera, UCLA, and the San Francisco Opera Center. Orchestras with which he has guested include the Tokyo Philharmonic, National Symphony Orchestra of Taiwan, Orchestra of St. Luke’s, and the Chautauqua Symphony.\n\nThis 2019 – 2020 season, Maestro Colaneri conducts a new production of Verdi’s Aïda at San Diego Opera followed by John Corigliano’s The Ghosts of Versailles to celebrate the 250th Anniversary of l’Opéra Royal in Versailles, France. In March, he leads Mozart’s La clemenza di Tito at the Shepherd School of Music in Houston and debuts at the Seattle Opera in May with Puccini’s La bohème. Next summer, Colaneri returns to Glimmerglass to lead Francesca Zambello’s productions of Wagner’s Die Feen and Rodgers and Hammerstein’s The Sound of Music.\n\nFor Joseph Colaneri’s complete biography, click here.\n\nEric Owens\n\nArtistic Advisor\n\nAs Artistic Advisor, Owens consults closely with Artistic & General Director Francesca Zambello and Music Director Joseph Colaneri on matters of Festival repertoire and casting and serves as an ambassador for the company.\n\nKnown for his roles of both classic works and new music, Owens’ international career has brought him to major opera houses around the world, including the Metropolitan Opera, San Francisco Opera, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Washington National Opera and LA Opera to Royal Opera Covent Garden, English National Opera and more.\n\nOwens made his Glimmerglass debut in the 2001 production of Britten’s The Rape of Lucretia.
