        "text": "I became passionate about photography at a very young age (my Father was a photographer and my Mother was an art teacher). Growing up in front of a camera made me dislike having my portrait taken. For a long time I believed that I was an unphotogenic person, and I preferred to be behind the camera rather than posing in front of it. After studying photography extensively, I have come to realize that in the right hands, there is no such thing as an ‘unphotogenic’ person. I pay a great deal of attention to posing and lighting, so that my clients look as radiant in my pictures as they do in real life.\n\nI consider my style to be eclectic as I’ve been trained in studio portraiture as well as photojournalism. I’m always learning new techniques and attending photography workshops when I can. I’m flexible, fun, and my focus is on your needs. I have over 15 years experience photographing weddings, portraits, and events. I know how to make sure that you look your absolute best, whether it’s indoors or outdoors."
