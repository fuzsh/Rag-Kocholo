In 1995, Gasali’s artwork was exhibited in Bayreuth, Germany alongside the work of five other artists from Nigeria launching his career. In 1996, the opportunity arose for him to travel outside of Nigeria for the first time when he was invited to come to the University of Iowa to do a series of exhibitions and workshops. Once there, the Octagon Gallery in Ames, Iowa took notice of his work and offered to exhibit it and he was also invited to work with a group of teenagers doing storytelling and art workshops to share with them the traditions of his own Yoruba culture.

Since he retired from professional pursuits in 2013, he has devoted much of his energy to knotting, usually producing five or six works each year. His pieces have been shown at local, national, and international juried exhibits. Some of his works incorporate found objects, and many are inspired by nature. Color plays a central role in all the pieces, which commonly combine fiber made of cotton, hemp, jute, and rattail. Rather than rely on infrastructure for support or shape, his pieces depend solely on the robust strength of the knots themselves, almost always the humble double half-hitch. Completely self-taught, he has developed techniques for achieving the results he intends while regularly surrendering to the instruction offered by the cords passing through his hands.\n\nMay 28, 2024: Jacqui Carey\n\ngenerously sponsored by The Braid Society\n\nWatch Video\n\nWhilst attending an art foundation course, Jacqui Carey discovered that weaving combined her love of mathematics and art.

They include all the following, and maybe more: shop owner, student, teacher, guild member, writer, editor, and publisher, for- and non-profit administrator, production weaver, fair trade advocate, founder of quite a few projects, explorer. In her first 50 years she was based in Colorado more than anywhere else, then she moved to Guatemala, where she has been since the year 2000. She loves looms because they do not require electricity, and still does all her drafting on graph paper with a pencil. She’s been called a Luddite more than once, but her resistance to technology does not go so far as trying to destroy it, rather she just leaves it to others. And hey – she has even learned to work with Zoom!\n\nCael Chappell (August 15, 2023)\n\ngenerously sponsored by National Basketry Organization\n\nWatch Video\n\nCael Chappell has been working with basket weavers in Africa since 1991.

After twenty years as a marketing sales executive, Adrienne has crafted a second career in jewelry fabrication and instruction. In a field that has become fairly predictable, her unique combination of kumihimo braiding, bead weaving, and metal fabrication techniques places her extraordinary pieces in a class of their own. Being raised in a family of engineers means Gaskell is driven by the need for the process to be technically interesting. The engineering gene also influences her interest in finding new jewelry fabrication techniques. It is what first attracted her to kumihimo braiding, now one of the predominant techniques used in her work. Her mother, who taught her needlework and how to make her own clothing, was fond of saying that Adrienne was born with a needle in her hand.\n\nMurray Gibson (January 25, 2022)\n\ngenerously sponsored by The Woolgatherers\n\nWatch Video\n\nMurray Gibson has been weaving tapestries for more than 30 years. He graduated from the Alberta College of Art and Design, Calgary, AB. He also received his MA in Textiles from Goldsmiths College, University of London, UK. He always designs his tapestries so that they reference textiles if not specifically tapestries. In some works, he has made direct reference to medieval tapestries in both imagery and technique, but there are also more subtle illusions to cloth through the use of patterning and even the use of a woven border. It is very important to Murray that his concepts and imagery are always best realized in a woven form. In 2015, Murray was named a Master Artisan by Craft Nova Scotia (formerly The Nova Scotia Designer Crafts Council). He was inducted into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2019.\n\nLiz Gipson (April 16, 2024)\n\ngenerously sponsored by Weave A Real Peace\n\nWatch Video\n\nSmitten by small looms and big plans, Liz Gipson is a writer, weaver, teacher, and rigid-heddle weaving enthusiast who hosts Yarnworker, a popular site for rigid-heddle weavers, and the associated Yarnworker School, an online, community-funded classroom.

It is the perfect medium for exploring mind, body, and spirit.\n\nJune 25, 2024: Sam Goates\n\ngenerously sponsored by Claudia Cocco in Memory of Irma Cocco\n\nWatch Video\n\nSam Goates began her own journey around the world of the textile industry at the Glasgow School of Art, though the make-do-and-mend approach of her parents was the real beginning, with sewing, dressmaking, and handspinning. After graduation, a 20-year \"holiday\" in Australia followed, being paid to be creative and design woven textiles. In 2008 Sam swapped busy Sydney for the seas and skies of Scotland’s Moray Firth coast. She took on a range of project work, from freelance design to product development as well as training projects across the textile industry. The common theme was a desire to promote weaving and wool at both the industry and artisan level. In a rickety shed by a fishing harbour, Sam has brought into the world her very own mini-micro weaving mill, Woven In The Bone. Here she tends to her nursery of vintage machines and foot-treadle looms, each with their own cantankerous characters, cajoling them into life to produce artisan woollen cloth to export around the world.\n\nRabbit Goody (May 10, 2022)\n\ngenerously sponsored by Heddlecraft\n\nWatch Video\n\nRabbit Goody knew how to weave from the very beginning, as if from some past life, or like someone who can pick up a musical instrument and play without thinking about it. She started weaving when she was in her late teens, without any real instruction, but it came very naturally to her. Her curiosity and interest in hand and early power technology was something that she developed throughout high school and college. The understanding of process – how things come into being – is the guiding question in all her work. After working for many years at the Farmers’ Museum in Cooperstown, NY as the head of Domestic Arts and as Assistant Curator for Textiles, she established the mill which has been producing fabrics for over 26 years. She has spent a great deal of time studying historic textiles in museum collections because being a curator has given her access to many, many collections. She has studied weavers’ draft books and has learned to read the weavers’ recipes and receipts from the past so that she can recreate textiles that have not been seen for hundreds of years. In addition to historic patterns, she designs very modern textiles that look as if they were hand woven but are in fact woven on our power looms.\n\nSarah Gotowka (June 27, 2023)\n\ngenerously sponsored by Weave A Real Peace (WARP)\n\nWatch Video\n\nSarah Gotowka is a practicing textile artist and instructor.

Starting with collectible mohair teddy bears, she has been designing and creating teddies for over 30 years. They have been featured in several US magazines, including Teddy Bear and Friends, Teddy Bear Review, and several overseas publications, with an emphasis on some unique innovations and mixing of media. During the time that she was creating teddy bears, in 2002 Irene discovered the art of needle felting. The use of wool fibers to sculpt became part of the teddy bears also, but as time went on it became apparent that this new art form was going to become a very large part of Irene’s creative process and she began to create sculptures that were beyond the teddy bears. She developed techniques that pushed her to continue designing and developing. Most of her work makes use of mixing her media. Needle felting itself was new to most people, so Irene was called on to demonstrate and educate at many shows. She has also developed needle felting classes that teach the how-to, but also using imagination and technique to create everything from 3D sculpture to embellishment and using fiber to create 2D fiber paintings and shadow boxes to allow for deeper dimensional paintings. Irene is originally from Long Island, NY, and relocated to the Asheville area in 2014, with her husband and her “fur family”.

The restoration of spinning wheels started when his wife, Kathy, began bringing spinning wheels home and asking, \"Can you do this?\" This evolved into a fascination with the mechanics and history of wheels, and John developed his knowledge and techniques that he uses to restore wheels to their original state. His desire is to restore the original parts, being sensitive to the original wheelmaker’s design. With 2200 square feet dedicated to a complete shop and showroom, John and Kathy have the resources and capabilities to perform any type of work that may be needed for any type of spinning wheel. While focused on the restoration of antique wheels, they also provide repair, customization, and parts for out-of-production wheels, in addition to helping resolve wheel issues and offering guidance to those wishing to perform their own repairs.\n\nJustin Squizzero (June 22, 2021)\n\ngenerously sponsored by Schiffer Publishing\n\nWatch Video\n\nHandweaver Justin Squizzero challenges modern definitions of progress by creating functional textiles that celebrate the natural world and the dignity of human labor.

Squizzero’s venture, The Burroughs Garret, draws on the textile traditions of his northern Vermont home, marrying natural dyes and fibers with a reserved aesthetic rooted in early New England. Produced on his 19th-century farm using 200-year-old hand looms, Squizzero’s textiles examine the role of handcraft in a post-industrial society, questioning the human experience in a digital age.\n\nWilliam Storms (September 14, 2021)\n\ngenerously sponsored by Grace Tully\n\nWatch Video\n\nWilliam Storms is a mathematically driven craftsman who moonlights as a Hand Weaver and daylights as a full-time Jacquard Designer for Crypton Fabric's recently acquired Mill in NC.
