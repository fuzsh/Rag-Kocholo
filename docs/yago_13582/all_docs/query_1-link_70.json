        "text": "Overview\n\nCalifornia’s cap-and-trade program, launched in 2013, is among a suite of major policies the state is using to lower its greenhouse gas emissions. California’s emissions trading program is the fourth largest in the world, following the cap-and-trade programs of China, the European Union, and the Republic of Korea. In addition to driving emissions reductions in one of the world’s largest economies, California’s experience has provided valuable insights into creating and managing an economy-wide cap-and-trade system.\n\nCalifornia’s system is a central component of the state’s broader strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The state also has additional goals of 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2045 and economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2045.\n\nThe program’s covered entities include large electric power plants, large industrial plants, and fuel distributors (e.g., natural gas and petroleum). In total, about 450 businesses that are responsible for around 85 percent of California’s total greenhouse gas emissions must comply. California has also linked its system with the Canadian province of Quebec’s cap-and-trade program, meaning that businesses in one jurisdiction can use emission allowances (or offsets) issued by the other for compliance. This increases the number of businesses under the cap, which reduces compliance costs by creating more options for companies to reduce their emissions.\n\nStatewide greenhouse gas emissions decreased 5.3 percent from the start of the program in 2013 to 2017 (see figure below). While it is difficult to establish causality between emissions reductions and any specific policy or market condition, at least some of this reduction can likely be attributed to California’s cap-and-trade program, which covers about 85 percent of the state’s emissions and invests billions of dollars in emission reducing projects.\n\nCalifornia Cap-and-Trade Details\n\nCap-and-trade systems are one of several market-based ways to reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions. California’s program represents the first multi-sector cap-and-trade program in North America. Building on lessons from the northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the California program blends proven market elements with its own policy innovations.\n\nThe California Air Resources Board (CARB) implements and enforces the program. The cap-and-trade rules first applied to electric power plants and industrial plants that emit 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year or more. Starting in 2015, the program was extended to fuel distributors meeting the 25,000-metric ton threshold. The program’s overall greenhouse gas emission cap declined by three percent annually from 2015 through 2020 and is designed to decrease an additional five percent from 2021 through 2030. Emission allowances are distributed by a mix of free allocation and quarterly auctions. The portion of emissions covered by free allowances varies by industry and by how efficient each facility is relative to industry benchmarks. These policy elements and other relevant details of California’s cap-and-trade program are summarized in the table at the end of this page.\n\nAuction revenue\n\nAlthough a significant number of emission allowances are freely allocated for transition assistance and to reduce emissions leakage in California’s program, the majority are sold at auction. Revenues from these auctions are deposited in the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The California Legislature then appropriates these funds to state agencies to administer programs that further reduce emissions. The California Climate Investments 2020 Annual Report found that allowance auctions have generated $12.5 billion in revenues since the start of the program. The report also highlights that the projects implemented through 2019 are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 44.7 MMTCO2e over their lifetimes—the equivalent of taking over 10 million gasoline-powered vehicles off the road for a year.\n\nA pair of 2012 laws established guidelines on how this annual revenue is disbursed. The two laws do not identify specific programs that would benefit from the revenue, but they provide a framework for how the state invests cap-and-trade revenue into local projects. The first law, AB 1532, requires that the auction revenue be spent for environmental purposes, with an emphasis on improving air quality. The second, SB 535, requires that at least 25 percent of the revenue be spent on programs that benefit disadvantaged communities, which tend to suffer disproportionately from air pollution. The California Environmental Protection Agency identifies disadvantaged communities for investment opportunities, while the state’s Department of Finance oversees the expenditures of this revenue to mitigate direct health impacts of climate change.\n\nIn 2016, AB 1150 amended the criteria for revenue use again. It requires at least 25 percent of revenue to go to investments “within and benefitting disadvantaged communities and at least an additional 10 percent for low-income households or communities,” totaling 35 percent of revenue required to go towards disadvantaged and low-income communities.\n\nAB 398, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed on July 25, 2017, further clarifies the priorities for investments as:\n\nReducing air toxic and criteria air pollutants\n\nPromoting low- and zero-carbon transportation\n\nSustainable agriculture\n\nHealthy forests and urban greening\n\nReducing short-lived climate pollutants\n\nPromoting climate adaptation and resilience\n\nSupporting climate and clean energy research\n\nMore information about how the proceeds from California’s cap-and-trade program are used can be found here.\n\nCalifornia’s Overall Climate Change Program\n\nCalifornia’s cap-and-trade program is only one element of its broader climate change strategy, as authorized in the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) and the 2016 extension bill SB 32. AB 32 sets a statewide carbon limit by 2020 while SB 32 sets a statewide limit by 2030. AB 32 seeks to slow climate change through a comprehensive program that reduces greenhouse gas emissions from virtually all sources statewide.\n\nAB 32 and other state laws also require a variety of actions aimed at reducing the state’s impact on the climate including a renewables portfolio standard, a low carbon fuel standard, an advanced clean cars program, and a variety of land use and energy efficiency standards and incentives. California’s cap-and-trade program acts as a backstop to ensure its overall greenhouse gas target is met, regardless of the performance of these complementary measures. The figure below shows how CARB is planning to achieve the state’s 2030 emissions goal. The reductions delivered by the cap-and-trade program depend upon reductions delivered by complementary policies.\n\nFor more information on actions taken by CARB in response to AB 32, visit the AB 32 Scoping Plan page which has the latest information about how the state is achieving and planning to meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals."
