        "text": "Our Beloved Sister, Shauna Lee Stark age 56 returned to her Heavenly Father on May 28, 2021.\n\nShauna was born on March 12, 1965 to Cleon Joseph and LaVern Hiatt Stark. She was heaven sent and the apple of her mother, father and her four brothers, eye.\n\nEarly in life Shauna developed childhood diabetes, and some years later in addition to diabetes she also developed epilepsy. Although this made life a challenge, she never let it stop her from being sassy, spunky, fiesty and always willing to offer her unconditional love to others. Shauna never met a person she didn't love and offered hugs to everyone she met. She brought a lot of joy and made many friends at the care centers where she resided.\n\nShauna loved her Heavenly Father and her Savior Jesus Christ, she had a strong testimony of the Gospel and enjoyed attending Sacrament meeting at the care center as often as she could.\n\nShe loved her dogs, her dolls, the BeeGees, BYU football, she loved rides with her brother Mike, especially by the LaVell Edwards stadium, she loved LaCasita Restaurant, Orange Vanilla Coke, her nieces, Treasa and Kassidi, her nephews James and Tyson and most of all her brothers Michael, Jerry, David and Danny.\n\nShauna was preceded in death by her parents Cleon and LaVem Stark, her brother Danny, who she adored.\n\nShe is survived by her siblings, Michael (Becky) Stark, Jerry Stark, David (Karen) Stark, Sister In-law, Jill Hillock who she cherished.\n\nGraveside Services will be held at 11:00 AM, Friday June 4, 2021 at the Springville Evergreen Cemetery located at 1997 East 400 South Springville, Utah. A viewing for family and friends will be held that morning from 9:30 AM to10:15 AM at Wheeler Mortuary, 211 East 200 South Springville, prior to the services. Shauna will take her final ride by the LaVell Edwards Stadium before arriving at the cemetery.\n\nThe family would like to thank all of those who took Shauna under their wing and cared for her, Kirk and Monica Boyer, Spanish Fork Nursing and Rehab, Mike and Marilyn Erickson & especially for their exceptional and treasured friendship they shared with Shauna, Orchard Park Nursing and Rehab, for their continuous kindness and care. Last but not least thank you to Wheeler Mortuary for their considerate and tender respect of our Shauna."
