The show is an episodic ensemble comedy featuring a revolving cast of guest stars including Miranda July, Peter Glantz, Tunde Adebimpe, Ron Regé, Jr., Mia Doi Todd, Ariana Delawari, Josh Fadem, and Brandon Ratcliff.\n\nThe show was originally produced as a stage show in Los Angeles in 2006, which was followed by a preliminary film shoot in New York City and Los Angeles the same year. A second film shoot was produced in Summer 2009 in Portland, Oregon. Season one entered final post-production in fall 2009.\n\nFormat\n\n[edit]\n\nLike any variety show, Califunya! features musical performances by artists such as The LA Ladies Choir and Colin Meloy of The Decemberists, comedy skits and guest appearances by visual artists like Jim Drain, who also served as the show's art director. The tone of the show was described as \"parodying a high school play that is parodying a kids' show from the '60s as performed by grownups—with all the expected exclamation points muted.\"[1]\n\nIt was produced and released in 2009/2010 by Wieden+Kennedy Entertainment.[2]\n\nEpisode list\n\n[edit]\n\nEpisode # Title Featured artist Original airdate 01Sailing Through Space on a Beautiful Planet!Mia Doi Todd, Ariana DelawariDecember 15, 2009 ( ) 02\"Bluebird\" ♫Ariana Delawari, Mia Doi Todd, Colin MeloyJanuary 5, 2010 ( ) 03The CurtainAaron RoseJanuary 19, 2010 ( ) 04The Key to My Happiness!Ariana DelawariFebruary 2, 2010 ( ) 05Musical Guest ♫ Colin MeloyColin MeloyFebruary 16, 2010 ( ) 06Tea Party ♥Aaron RoseMarch 2, 2010 ( )\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
