The family moved to AuTrain five years ago from Wisconsin and Becky was a big part of her boys’ activities at school in Waterloo and at Superior Central. She had a passion for autism awareness and was a wonderful advocate. She was a fantastic baker and cook and made the best cheesy potatoes. Becky loved hosting or going to family events and always had fun wherever and whenever she was with her family. She loved the Green Bay Packers and University of Wisconsin Badgers. Becky had a one of a kind laugh and infectious laugh. She was by nature a loving, amazing, and giving daughter, sister, wife, mother, caregiver, and friend.\n\nBecky is survived by her husband Emmett of AuTrain; their sons – Emmett Tyler Phillipson and Ethan Wilbur Charles Phillipson both at home; father – Wilbur Stark of AuTrain; siblings – Tammy Rias of Beaver Dam, WI, Jackie Stark of Milwaukee, WI, and Brian Stark of Waterloo, WI; parents-in-law- Emmett and Lynne Phillipson of Grand Marais and Nancy Phillipson of Munising; brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law – Kimberly (Robert) Watt of Gwinn, Eric (Deidre) Phillipson of Munising, and Amanda (Tiffany) Phillipson of Little Lake; nieces and nephews – Marcus, Christopher, Carley, Monise, Fednise, Kaden, Kayla, Eli, and Ashlynn.
