Her great knowledge and understanding of all aspects, meant that she could adapt the programme to what we needed, when we needed it.”\n\nPatrick Davenport – Meadowfoods\n\n“The Chamber has had an excellent relationship with Becky for a number of years, during this time she has delivered many presentations and training courses in relation to International Trade, including; Brexit readiness, Rules of Origin, Incoterms, Methods of Payment, and many more. Becky has outstanding knowledge and experience, this combined with her very interactive approach, delivery and enthusiasm for the subject inspires others and is always greatly received by those in the room.”\n\nDebbie Bryce – Chief Executive Officer, West Cheshire and North Wales Chamber of Commerce\n\n“Becky Stark is a knowledgeable and personable presenter who delivers the whole training package. She is an expert in many areas who has the knack of bringing the audience with her. She is a firm favourite amongst our employees.”\n\nLee Kavanagh – Customer Care Manager Innospec Limited\n\n“We contacted Stark Export Focus during the build up to Brexit with many fears from staff and management over the changes needed and the limited knowledge we had with import, export and customs requirements. Becky was extremely helpful in supporting colleagues and the business during what was a very tricky time with very limited support coming from elsewhere. She responded to any request in a professional, supportive and informative way, utilisation of video conferencing with screen sharing etc was also extremely useful as Covid and lockdown prevented what would normally have been face to face meetings. We would highly recommend Becky and Stark Export Focus to anyone!”\n\nBrian Bannister – Managing Director, Lafert Electric Motors Ltd\n\n“We worked with Becky and immediately I was impressed by the quality of research she conducted in our sector and the speed at which she presented her findings. She has an incredibly in-depth understanding of the different ways to export your product and service, and I would have no problem recommending her as one of our business partners.”\n\nBen Griffiths – MD Neatcrown Corwen\n\n“For several years now we have invited Becky back to the Priory School to give a talk to all our Year 9 students about how languages have been beneficial to her in her career in business. This is a fantastic opportunity for our students to listen to some concrete examples about the benefits of learning a foreign language. Becky is always very enthusiastic, her presentation is targeted at the right level for 13/14 year olds and students often cite the talk as being influential in their decision to carry on with languages to GCSE level. We are very grateful to Becky for sharing her experiences with us.”\n\nLucy Talbot – Priory School\n\n“An Inspirational and motivation speaker, who inspires future generations to make the best of their entrepreneurial skills for business.”\n\nValerie Payne – Regional Executive for NE Wales, for the Big Ideas Wales Project\n\n“Becky’s enthusiasm and knowledge made for a very useful and enjoyable workshop”.\n\nCarole Longden – Longden Limited\n\n“Becky presented confidently to business management undergraduate students at Glyndwr University about her career path in international business and export related services. Her wealth of experience and engaging style made for an inspiring session.”\n\nNeil L Pritchard – Careers Advisor, Glyndwr University\n\nSERVICES\n\nCOMPANY\n\nCONTACT US\n\nLOCATION\n\nMold, Flintshire\n\nSite by NEARO © Stark Export Focus 2023\n\nCONTACT US\n\nLOCATION\n\nMold, Flintshire\n\nSERVICES\n\nCOMPANY\n\nSite by NEARO © Stark Export Focus 2023\n\nCONTACT US\n\nLOCATION\n\nMold, Flintshire\n\n© Stark Export Focus 2023\n\nSite by NEARO"
