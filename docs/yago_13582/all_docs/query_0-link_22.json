        "text": "Credentials: I’m a 500-hour RYT with Yoga Alliance since 2004 trained in Encinitas, CA. I received a teaching certificate from the Solar Yoga Center in 2001, which at that time wasn’t affiliated with YA. I taught for several years prior to any certification based on experience and an established practice.\n\nI’m trained and comfortable in a variety of styles: hot yoga, power yoga, vinyasa, gentle yoga, traditional Hatha yoga. In addition, I had intensive training by Yoga Six enabling me to teach at their flagship studio in St. Louis. I taught vinyasa, three different hot sequences, power yoga, and slow flow.\n\nAt Yoga Source I pioneered the Hour of Power format, which went on to be one of their most popular classes and a staple of many other studios.\n\nFavorite workout: wearing out my new rescue dog. She’s my personal trainer! I also love to take yoga classes when I travel-no one knows I’m a teacher so I get to be a true student.\n\nFavorite workout time: mid-morning – early evening\n\nIdeal client: anyone who walks in the studio\n\nImportant to know about me: I bring a lot of life and yoga experience into my teaching. I’m honest, supportive, non-judgmental, and playful. I put myself out there as a real person to make students feel comfortable. I believe that they can do anything they set the mind to as long as they feel safe in their postures and the studio environment.\n\nGo to work out song: crazy, fun Bollywood music and almost anything David Byrne performs."
