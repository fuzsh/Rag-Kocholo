        "text": "\"She first photographed my wedding and did such a phenomenal job capturing our special day, personalities and wedding vibe.\n\nSecond time I worked with her was for a professional shoot and again, so easy to work with and the photos were incredible.\n\nThis last time she photographed my extended family (including young kids) and again, photos were fantastic! She's so easy to work with, has great ideas/recommendations around shoot locations and photo set ups and and takes great photos.\n\nSeeing that I've worked with her in three different capacities, I can confidently say she's great for any and every occasion. I highly recommend you reach out to her!\"\n\nEmily M."
