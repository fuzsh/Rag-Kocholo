He specialized in leading dangerous factions, which included his wicked Army of Darkness, collegiate bullies The Varsity Club, and the wild Dungeon of Doom, which introduced Big Show to the wrestling world,\" the WWE said.\n\nThe organization added, \"The one-time 'Taskmaster' also became a creative force behind the scenes for WCW,” which he first became involved with in the late '80s.\n\n\"WWE extends its condolences to Sullivan’s family, friends and fans,\" the statement concluded.\n\nLongtime wrestler and WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H reflected on Sullivan's impact on the sport in a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter). \"Kevin Sullivan had one of the most unique minds in the history of our industry, pushing creative boundaries and developing some of the most intriguing characters to step into the ring. He had an unwavering passion for what we do,\" he wrote.\n\nRelated: WWE Legend Virgil Dead At 61: 'An Incredible Athlete'\n\nWhile a cause of death has not been revealed, Fox affiliate WJW reported that a GoFundMe was set up for Sullivan, explaining that the former wrestler was \"facing a critical medical emergency and financial crisis\" following an accident he suffered while in Florida for autograph signings in May.\n\nPer the organizers of the fundraiser, \"he underwent emergency surgery that saved his leg and life but faced severe complications, including sepsis and encephalitis.\"\n\nIn an update to the campaign on July 15, they said that Sullivan was in the process of recovering, with the \"ultimate hope that he regains his independence.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
