        "text": "RE: FARCAPE FINAL FRELLIN' FAREWELL BURBANK, CA\n\nI was at the Farscape 2007 convention in November for the first time and it was amazing. I was very happy to discover that there was going to be another convention next year. I know it's far too early to say for sure but is Claudia Black going to be on the guest list for next years convention? She's a brilliant and versatile actress and it would be really great if she was a guest next year. Finally I just want to say that you put on a brilliant convention and I look forward to seeing what wonderful tricks you have up your sleeves for next year.\n\n- T.T.\n\nHello! Thank you for another great Farscape convention! This year was my second time attending, and I had just as much fun this year as I did last year! I am so glad you are having another in 2008 - I am definitely planning to attend!\n\nI read on the 2008 Farscape convention site that you are asking for guest requests - I'd love to see everybody again who was there this year - plus Francesca Buller (please!?!) and Claudia Black (please!?!). I would also love to see Virginia Hey, David Kemper, Andrew Prowse, Ricky Manning. And last but not least, if there is any way possible - a visit by Brian Hensen!\n\nBen Browder's performance is one of the biggest highlights of the weekend - would it be possible for you to sell a DVD of his performance again this year like you did last year?\n\nJust one bit of feedback for next year - would it be possible to schedule more time for Ben onstage, or schedule fewer things after him so he can run long if he wants to (he seems to want to! ;-)) without putting the rest of your schedule out of whack? I would love to see his time on stage extended if you can, and perhaps move one of the other Sunday guests onto another day so Sunday isn't so full. It's an exciting day, but it was a bit overwhelming to try and attend all of the events on Sunday.\n\nThanks again for a truly wonderful event! See you next year!\n\n- P.W.\n\nI had such a great time at the Farscape Convention this year, and I just wanted to thank you all so much for being in this business, which enables us to see and interact with the people who've changed our lives for the better. Of course, it was also such a pleasure to reunite with old friends and to meet new ones. I am so looking forward to 2008's second Final Frelling Farewell (may there be many more!)\n\nIf I have one quibble it's with the number of music videos that were shown this year. Watching the fan videos, both as \"fillers\" and as introductions for the honored guests, is one of the singular pleasures of attending this convention, and i do hope that next year you guys decide to show a few more. Not every Farscape video is a work of genius, y'know. But most of 'em are way fun to watch.\n\nThank you all also for showing my video \"the end of the world\". This was such a great thrill - to watch something I made displayed on a big screen in front of like-minded people. I'm happy for the gift certificate, but it's not the reason I enter the vid contest. I vid for the sheer love of Farscape, and would enter the contest for the recognition alone.\n\nTake care all of you and see you next year!\n\n- L.G.\n\nI have just returned from the 2007Conventon - and my first visit to the US. I have to tell you what an outstanding time my husband and I have had. This is the first convention we have attended and didnt know what to expect but the whole thing was a blast, Your staff were very professional and helpful - even when i lost my breakfast ticket and was nearly in tears, but all ended well. We will definitely be signing up for next year and cant wait.\n\nI started vidding this year and sent one of my first music videos in but never thought it had a chance. It was shown before Ben came on stage. Thank you so much - this just topped off the whole thing for me. What a fab experience. thank you, thank you, thank you!\n\nSee you next year. - S.\n\nI did attend the Farscape convention, and thank you very much for a wonderful event! It was my first convention, and finances willing, not my last. Really an excellent experience. I was sorry to have missed out on the 2006 con, which sounded like a truly special party with Signal Room playing. I also really enjoyed the fan panels - the Scapecast, fanfic panel and vidders panel, as well as the costume and talent contests.\n\n- L. I.\n\nI just wanted to tell you that I had a great time at the Farscape Con over the weekend. Each year I think this will be my last, and then I have a fantastic time, and decide to come back again. So thank you for all your hard work in making this con so enjoyable.\n\nI also wanted to say that the volunteers are just amazing. They’re polite and work extremely hard, yet they have fun with us too. So it never feels like we’re little kids being corralled by the grownups. It’s like they’re fans too, and they’re just trying to keep things orderly. Which they really do.\n\nAs usual, the guests were all great. Ben was amazing as always. I’m sure you know he’s the big draw, and he doesn’t disappoint. He must leave exhausted every year. And the cabaret was great this year. It was kind of, well, lame last year, to be honest. So I almost didn’t buy a ticket. But this year everyone came prepared and they really put on a great show. My favorite was Anthony’s completely improv-ed totally ridiculous song that was just hilarious.\n\nMy only small complaint is that there was never any food in the convention center, so we ended up having to get carryout from The Grille, which is a pain in the neck. The hotel, in general, seemed fussier than The Hilton, though that room they gave us ended up being really nice.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for a great con. I hope a lot of people come next year so you don’t end up regretting having a 2nd final con!\n\n- A.P.\n\nI attended the Farscape Farewell convention last weekend. I would like to thank CreationEnt for an absolutely wonderful time. I met amazing people and was able to meet some of the stars. Thank you for a truly wonderful weekend. I will be attending next year in California and hope that Claudia Black can be apart of it.\n\nSincerly, B.S.\n\nDidn't I hear you say you hoped to have Fran next year? Yes!!! Please!!! We missed her terribly last year and this year. Thank you! I had a great time at the con this year, too. I bought gold tickets for next year. Haven't done that the last couple of years. I loved all the great shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, mugs, hats........I bought one of everything! They were beautifully done. I love the embroidery on things. Ya'll did a great job. Gary was so funny with the auction. I loved it, although I didn't manage to come home with anything from the auction this time, it was still fun.\n\nThanks! F.\n\nHello and thank you for a wonderful frelling convention. As a convention newbie, i was impressed with how everything ran. The merchandise was wonderful. (Andy's shirt was fantastic!) The cast was gracious and entertaining. Their talent is amazing. You asked us to send you our '08 gust request. Francesca Buller, Claudia Black, Andrew Prowse and Kent McCord would be on that request list. Of course Ben is at the top of the list, I was so struck by him. I have already reserved my gold seat and will see you next year! Thank you for a great convention.\n\nRespectfully, D.B.\n\nI just wanted to thank you for putting together such a fantastic convention- I am a newbie to Farscape and attended the event on a whim. It was easily one of the best weekends I've had in years. Thanks again for the great weekend!\n\n- N.H.\n\nI'm back from Farscape 2007 and have finally gotten a good night's sleep, so I wanted to let you know that I had a GREAT time!! I've been to all of the Farscape Burbank Conventions and already have signed up for 2008. I'm thrilled that Ben is (hopefully) coming back, so please try to get Claudia for 2008.\n\nSincerely, B.H.\n\nThank you so much for another great convention. You did a fantastic job and the evidence that you really make the effort to please diverse personalities was always in view. It's not an easy job. Brilliant program, the cast always gracious and kind. (Please continue to invite David Franklin...he's like our mascot!) The clothes continued to be fantastic (LOVE the classic Farscape logo)! Hope to see Andrew Prowse as a guest next year.\n\nWith respect and gratitude, N.\n\nHello to you wonderful folks at Creation, and Thank You for such a memorable convention! This was my first convention as i'm new to Farscape, and after attending this convention, I immediately reserved my gold seat for next year.\n\nSince i'm so late coming to Farscape, being able to attend this convention was wonderful and I look forward to meeting as many of the cast as humanly possible so t the convention you guys said to e-mail our '08 guest requests, and I'd dearly love to see as many as the following as can be invited (just in case '08 will be the last year, which would be sad).\n\nFrancesca Buller - Ro'na, M'lee, Raxil, War Minister Ahkna\n\nPaul Goddard - Stark\n\nVirginia Hey - Zhaan\n\nTammy Macintosh - Jool\n\nRebecca Riggs - Grayza\n\nClaudia Black - Aeryn Sun\n\nRaelee Hill - Sikozu\n\nThanks again guys, look forward to seeing you again next year\n\n- J.P.\n\nRE: CUSTOMER SERVICE\n\nThank you so much once again for Creation's prompt attention to a problem. Don't know how you manage to give such great personal attention to everyone when you are all so obviously extremely busy.\n\nlt has been great to put faces to names when we have had the pleasure of meeting some of you at the Las Vegas Star Trek Conventions where we have always received a speedy response to any problems - including the time my neighbour managed to lose one of her autographed photos amongst the hundreds of menus in the Hilton Paradise Cafe!\n\nRegards, S.F.\n\nRE: FIREFLY / SERENITY CONVENTION BURBANK, CA\n\nBy the way the Firefly/Serenity, Stargate and Galactica Conv. this year were absolutely fabulous. These few words don't even describe how much fun they were. Thank you and ALL of your staff for all the good and memorable times we have had at your Conventions. Happy Holidays.\n\n- Your Fans, G. & M. Workman\n\nFirst of all, thank you for the wonderful Firefly/Serenity convention last month! It was the second convention I attended, and I loved it so much. It was open and friendly and full of surprises and I'd definitely do it again next year in a heartbeat.\n\n- K.B.\n\nI wanted to say thanks to all involved with that convention for putting on such a great event. The staff, stars & fellow fans were great throughout the weekend. I have to say I have a set of great memories from that weekend. I went along with a friend who loved the show and we have been to all of the Burbank conventions for the Firefly/serenity but by far this one was the most well organized and continually fun one yet. I had a blast and she loved every second of weekend with the stars, stories and everything Firefly/Serenity.\n\nThank you all, J.N.\n\nThanks so much...you totally rocked the photo ops...hope you're there next year, too!\n\n- S.\n\nOMG - I just opened the Summer & Sean pic and turned to a puddle...LOL! Please thank Ted for capturing this moment for me...you guys rock my world!\n\nAll the very best, P.\n\nThanks again for the best convention ever!\n\n- T. - P.S. Love the photos!!!\n\nI was at your recent Firefly/Serenity Salute in Burbank...it was my first Creation event, and I had so much fun, I want to come again! I will write more comments about what an awesome time I had last weekend as soon as I have a moment to sit down and do it justice.\n\n- S.\n\nThis convention was easily my best Creation experience ever!\n\n- Cheers, R.\n\nI just wanted to thank Creation Entertainment for showing me such a great time and giving me some great memories. The Staff was very friendly and helpful, the stars were a lot of fun to hang out with and the fans were super great. I enjoyed being a part of the Charity Auction helping with taking down the banners. It was a great running gag. The weekend was full of surprises with the stars sharing time on stage with each other. Thank you Creation for making a very tall man smile.\n\n- D.L.\n\nBy the way........I wanted to to say that last weekend's Firefly/Serenity Convention was the best ever......Nathan Fillion just made our weekend with his humor and the way he greeted us for the photo op, he was very welcoming and when he was onstage we couldn't stop laughing the entire time. Thank you and Creation for giving us the best weekend we have had in a long time.\n\n- A.\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention earlier is your staff and volunteers were all SO friendly and free with any information and always happy to answer questions, it makes you feel like your patronage is appreciated and may I reiterate, the organization was phenomenal, I know many more people will attend next year and you asked for some suggestions for supporting people to be there, obviously Joss would be a major coup but it would also be nice to see Cristina Hendricks, Mark Sheppard, Michael Fairman, Richard Brooks, Melinda Clarke, Jonathan Woodward and Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Krumholz from Serenity the movie would be great.\n\n- L.\n\nJust wanted to let you know that I had a wonderful time at this convention. The guests were great and lots of fun. I was only able to make it Sunday but, WOW, what a day. Was so much fun when we ended up with all the guests up on stage at the same time so unexpectedly. Nathan of course was so funny!! Looking forward to next year and will definitely do both days. My friend had a great time (was her first Scifi convention). She is already making plans to go next year with me and to go to some others also. Leticia as always was so nice and organized. Would be great for next year if you could also get: Jewel Staite J She is the only one from “Firefly” that I have not had the pleasure of meeting. Will see you this weekend at the Farscape convention!!\n\n- R.R.\n\nThe Firefly/ Serenity Convention was quite simply THE BEST convention I have ever been to. Thanks so much for a fantastic weekend, and thanks to your staff members, who were always very helpful, gracious and professional, hope to see you again soon.\n\n- M.C.\n\nI just got home from this weekends event and wanted to thank you and your staff for a great time. I have been to a few of Creations shows in Phoenix ( I wish you would come back ) and enjoyed them very much, but this show blew them all away. I love the fact that although you have a schedule to keep, you allow some deviation for the stars and fans interaction. Once again, I hade a great time and hope to come to another show real soon.\n\n- L.E.\n\nI wanted to share that I felt I was extraordinarily lucky to attend the Creation's convention for \"Firefly\"/\"Serenity.\"\n\nThe weekend felt like I was taking part in a warm and loving family reunion in which everyone had come together to celebrate Joss Whedon's \"Firefly\" universe (affectionately known as \"the 'verse\").\n\nClearly, the actors are very fond of one other as they greeted each other with big bear hugs, slaps on the back, and tons of good-natured ribbing. They also seemed just as delighted to be there so say \"hi!\" to their adoring fans. The massive ballroom room buzzed with excitement and warmth as everyone came together.\n\nOne of the highlights of the weekend was when Nathan Fillion made a surprise appearance on Saturday during Alan Tudyk's Q&A. Nathan had only been scheduled to appear on Sunday afternoon, so those of us who came for both days were in for a special treat. Not wanting to be left out of the fun, Morena returned on stage with Alan and Nathan and it was purely heaven time for the fans as they all teased each other mercilessly and with great humor. Given this little jokester prank, Alan happily returned the favor on Sunday to disrupt and provide some great comedy during Nathan's Q&A which prompted Summer and Sean to also come back out on stage and share in all the fun.\n\nSo there was a lot of spontaneous appearances and re-appearances which only continued to delight the fans. It made the experience all the more special to be a part of. Thank you!\n\n- T.\n\nJust wanted to write and tell you what a wonderful time I just had at the Creation Entertainment Salute to Serenity and Firefly. It was very well organized and your staff was accommodating and helpful. The guests were wonderful - they seemed relaxed and comfortable and appeared to have as much fun as the fans. I'd never been to a convention before and had my reservations about attending, but I had such a great time this weekend that I've already signed up for next year. Thanks for the great show! See you next year.\n\n- S.Y.\n\nThanks so much for a great event, as always. The cast members were all great to see and that's largely because of the comfortable and classy environment you folks provide for them. Our interest in Firefly began with comments posted about Nathan Fillion's appearances at other Creation events, so we checked out the DVD set and were immediately hooked. Meeting the on-screen cast, and talking with some of the behind-the-scenes folks was outstanding and only makes us hungry for more; more about what's already been done and, hopefully, new experiences in the future (dare we say \"Serenity 2: The Return of Wash\"?). Anyway, we wanted to pass along out thanks and we hope to attend next year's salute.\n\n- T & F J\n\nRE: XENA CONVENTION & LUCY LAWLESS CONCERT CHICAGO, IL\n\nThe Xena Convention in Chicago was my very first time attending. This year has been a very blessed year and this is definitely at the top of my list. I had tears of joy going to Chicago because of who I was going to meet and take pictures with, the friends I was going to make and the good time I was going to have away from my job. Tears of joy and sadness came over me leaving to go back home because I didn't want the exciting weekend to end. Lucy and Renee were such wonderful guests.\n\nI remember Lucy asking if I was O.K. at the photo ops because she thought I was stressing over what questions to ask . And I would like to thank both Lucy and Renee for their concern over me. God Bless these sweethearts. I wanna thank Sharon and the whole Creation family for the hard work they put in to this. You know who you all are. I really appreciate this very much and you definitely have my respect. I also want to thank along with Lucy and Renee Ted, Steven, Joe and Adrienne for taking time out of their busy schedules to attend.\n\nThank you Chris(photo ops) for the wonderful photos I got with Lucy and Renee. They're displayed beautifully at home. I just can't stop staring at them because of how wonderful they turned out. When I look at them at a certain angle Lucy and Renee have a beautiful glow. The blue and white background, to me, looked like a dream state and I was posing with two pretty angels. But it wasn't a dream. It was for real. Now that I know that Renee sometimes wears a Gabrielle costume for the photo ops, I'll have to catch it next time and trust me I will attend another Xena convention next time because I have more stars from the series to meet and I want to be reunited with friends I made from the first one.\n\nThank you all once again for making this first time Xena experience for me an unforgettable experience. I will cherish and embrace this first time blessing in my heart and soul forever.\n\n- K.\n\nHi, I just wanted tell you how much I enjoyed the convention and Lucy's concert....You and your staff do an amazing job...Also for Bryan, Becky, Julie, Monica and Chris they are all so nice and friendly, I just wanted to let them know how much I appreciate everything they do.. It was a dream come true for me when Lucy decided to do photo ops, and I loved how she made everyone feel special.......I wanted to Thank, Lucy and Renee for taking time out of there busy schedules to be there.. and how much I appreciate everything they do for us fans... they are truly amazing, very special ladies, and real sweethearts...I feel we're the luckiest fans in the world!!!!!!! Thanks for everything you do....See you in Burbank.......Take care and God Bless\n\n- R.\n\nI love my pictures! I love them all but my favorite is the one of Lucy which I already picked\n\nup at the con. Your pictures are so good, Chris. Thank you for that as these are important memories for us all. Everytime I look at that picture with Lucy, I remember the moment and how\n\nfriendly, kind and genuine she was to me and to everyone during these photo shoots. You must have had fun doing them seeing us all beaming and laughing.\n\n- Thanks again, J.A.\n\nWow!! What a fantastic weekend I had!! Lucy's concerts were fabulous. She gets better each time I hear her. I loved Renee's appearance on Friday night. What a great pair those two make on stage at the concert and the con. It was great having Joe Loduca at the con and in charge of Lucy's show. What a talented guy! I really enjoyed hearing Lucy sing at the con with him and loved Renee and Lucy singing We Can Work It Out. How fun was that? Please thank Lucy for doing the photo op. I was so happy to finally meet her. She made my weekend when I got a big hug from her! How sweet she was to us all! Another con has come and gone but I'm looking forward to Burbank in January!! See you then!\n\n- J.M.\n\nThank you for a great convention! I don't know how you guys managed to pull off two large conventions at the same hotel, the same weekend, but somehow you guys managed. My thanks to Sharon, Gary, Adam and the rest of the Creation employees and staffers. Thank you to Lucy and Renee, Ted, Adrienne, Steven and Joe for coming and visit with fans. I hope you guys bring back the Xena convention to Chicago next year because it allows so many of us who can't afford to go to Burbank to experience a convention a little more frequently.\n\n- J.\n\nRE: STAR TREK CHICAGO, IL\n\nWow!!!! Awesome!!!! Wonderful!!!! Great!!!! Those are the words that come to mind. I just wanted to write and tell you what an awesome time I had and fun too. All the guests were super especially Frakes and Sirtis they were very funny. The breakfast and the photo ops were the most enjoyable. All the staff at Creation were great too. Tammy, Becky, Chris the photographer. He really does a great job. Also Gary and Adam were great too. Adam it was nice to finally meet you. This is why I will only buy Creation tickets and merchandise. Looking forward to next year. I will be going in Gold again. Thanks for all your hard work. This fan is very pleased.\n\nJ. W.\n\nRE: PHOTO OPS\n\nYou've done an excellent job with the photo ops. All my pictures from this year and last year have turned out wonderfully. Thank you! :)\n\n- S.\n\nRE: CREATION'S MYSPACE PAGE\n\nThank you SO much for posting the footage of Ms. Nichols and myself onstage together. God, I was so NERVOUS and caught off-guard!! I can barely watch it bc I get so choked up. It was the most amazing moment for me.\n\nTo say I had an incredible time doesn't really do it justice. I guess the only thing left to do now is buy a ticket for next year.\n\nHugs, N.\n\nRE: STARGATE SG-1 CHICAGO, IL\n\nFirst off, I have to tell you that I love Creation Events. You guys just get it. You know it's not about rushing everyone through to get an auto or photo with the actor. It's about letting that actor take as much time as he or she sees fit to interact with the fans. And speaking of photos, your photographer Chris rocks. Seriously he is the best photographer I have ever come across at a convention.\n\n- A. O.\n\nI guess you’re in the middle of getting ready for your next con. I just wanted to take time to thank you again on behalf of KTGODN for your kindness toward us. We all appreciated it very much. We made many new friends and had such a wonderful time. This was a first convention for at least 3 of us, I believe. I must say, I have a VERY healthy respect for what you do now! I don’t know how you are still sane. I hope you don’t have to keep that pace up year-round. WOW! I’m not sure about the rest of the crew, but I was about four days recovering!\n\nWell, once again, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart, we really appreciate it! It was a trip none of us will ever forget. I can’t begin to tell you what it meant to each of us. Thank you.\n\nYour friend, M.S.\n\nIt is always a pleasure to interact with you and the folks from Creation at the con. You all \"make\" the experience so much better. Although I don't know yet which con our group will choose for next year, I certainly hope you are Our Photographer again. Thanks for your patience and wonderful work.\n\n- M.L.\n\nVIP TICKET FEEDBACK\n\nI just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to have a great experience. I was actually blown away by the AMOUNT (a lot!) of time that some of the actors spent with us. The purchase was SO worth it. I guarantee that if you offer this again, I will buy it (or attempt to win the bid!) Also, thank you for the generous gifts at the end of the show--it was quite unexpected and much appreciated.\n\n- K.Z.\n\nRE: STAR TREK LAS VEGAS, NV\n\nRE: SHATNER/NIMOY PHOTO OP\n\nWow! This is the sensation of my office. I cannot believe I am actually in a picture with them both. Thank you so much for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; I will treasure my photo with two superstars forever.\n\n- Flo\n\nWhat a trip! What a terrific time I had because of you and your staff. Everyone was extremely friendly and approachable, especially Robert and Steve (security/talent escorts). You are very lucky to have those two on your staff. Leticia, man, she and her staff sure worked hard getting us all registered. And this year's registration was very organized and well done. I'm from Canada, but I never felt that I was losing my place to select seats for the next year because I had to go into another line. They were great.\n\nI'm already looking forward to next year and 5 full days! I'll need to get my sleep before I come!\n\nAgain, many thanks to you and your terrific staff for the wonderful convention!\n\n- P.W.\n\ni just wanted to tell u what an awesome time i had this weekend at the stargate convention in chicago. all the guests were super awesome and the staff and crew of creation were wonderful too. also the photo ops were the most enjoyable. chris the photographer did a great job and so did gary. i will be back next year in gold. thanks and again and i wll always buy creation tickets and merchandise. your friend and supporter james from chicago. cant wait til next year.\n\n- J.\n\nCongratulations on a successful show!! My husband and I very much enjoyed the Vegas ST convention. It was our first BIG con and WOW, it was incredible! Thanks for all of the hard work in putting it together.\n\nThanks again, A.C.\n\nINCREDIBLE, FANTASTIC, GREAT. I wanted to follow up our telephone conversation to tell you how wonderful and memorable the 2007 Star Trek Las Vegas Convention was. Far and away the best Creation Con. The VIP Backstage Pass was the best along with your graciousness and concern for us. Your staff was super also: Lori, Chris Schmelke, Ed Rodriguez, Maria, Christopher, Becky, Julie, Barb, Carol, etc. Greatly looking forward to my next Star Trek Creation Con.\n\n- H.G.\n\nFirst I wanted to thank you for putting on yet another great event. My friend and I had a wonderful time like we do every year and we are already planning next years trip. We will send another email (once he returns for travel for work) with specific suggestions and comments but overall it was awesome.\n\n- R.P.\n\nI just wanted to say thank you again for the award. As you both know, there aren't too many 'official recognitions' that producers get except for the most gratifying--- a thrilled and happy audience-----and perhaps great box office. But the award you bestowed upon me at the LV convention means as much or more than any rave New York Times review because it comes from a) fellow producers and b) fellow Star Trek fans. The award is going to be added into my 'official playbill bio' this Fall and I will be sure to credit Creation Entertainment.\n\n- T.J.\n\nI wanted to write and thank you both for the fantastic job you & everyone at Creation did with this year's Las Vegas convention! It was, as always, a well organized, fun, joyful event!\n\nI always tell anyone who asks me, that with Creation, if you guys say you will do something you will, if there is any problem you will take care of it, and it is always fun!\n\nTo me, Star Trek is, at it's heart, about social commentary and responsibility, about discussion of ideas and hope for the future. In such, I appreciate that so many of the guests express opinions about social and political issues. I know that some of the audience disagreed with guests about certain issues, and while I applaud people expressing their opinions, I would be sad to see a day when anyone - guest or audience member feels silenced or that they were unwelcome to talk politics. Gene Roddenberry's vision was so distinctly political and so specifically socially relevant that it seems to me that a Star Trek convention is one of the first places that such discussion, including disagreement, should be welcomed. (For the record, my own opinions are very much in the \"Kate Mulgrew-George Takei-Nicholas Meyer vein,\" but I would also welcome debate and feel that everyone has a responsibility to express themselves and their opinions, especially now.)\n\nSo again, thank you for a great weekend - and thanks to all of the people who, along with yourselves work so hard to make these events happen - Leticia is always so wonderfully helpful, Lyn in a gem, and everyone is kind, helpful, and respectful.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you in Novenber at the Farscape & Battlestar Galactica (another deeply political show) cons!\n\nYours in friendship, J.B.\n\nThe Las Vegas Convention was absolutely fabulous, and the most memorable one I ever attended, especially because of being selected as one of the winners in the music video contest (\"title: Jonathan Archer and the Temporal Cold War\"), for which I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nI just wish to express my gratitude to you for keeping the spirit of Star Trek alive, by giving us the chance to be together with people from all around the world as one big happy family. Mr.Roddenberry gave us the vision of a bright future, but you have made in into a reality!\n\nI will be there next year again to be with all the friends I've made over the years, and looking forawrd to another great convention!\n\nThank you again and Live Long and Prosper!\n\n- Y.K. / Tokyo, Japan\n\nYou and the Creation team did a fantastic job organizing the Las Vegas convention. It was the first Star Trek convention that my daughter and I ever attended, and we had a wonderful time.\n\nThe guests were very entertaining. The comedy award would be a toss-up between Shatner/Nimoy and Frakes/Spiner. All of the guest were very nice, but on the especially nice list are Wil Wheaton, Terry Ferrell, Nana Visitor, and Max Grodenchik. In the Vendors room, Herb Jefferson, Jr, Garry Walberg, Chase Masterson, and Lawrence Montaigne, were especially nice to my daughter.\n\nThe parties were very nice. The guests were entertaining and accommodating of the fans. My daughter and I attended the Chocolate Party, Gold Patron Dinner, the Dessert Party, and Sunday Breakfast and Auction. The food was plentiful, and tasty at all of the events.\n\nIf I can think of anything else, I will email again, but overall the experience was fantastic. Thanks for a terrific time.\n\n- A.D.\n\nThanks again to you and the many volunteers who made our VIP experience very rewarding and enjoyable. Iris was especially great as we were able to leave our personal belongings back stage and knowing that someone was there overseeing the area. You really went way out for the group especially with all of the food and refreshments that were provided. We were glad to see that there was enough for the staff members. Even some of the guest stars were able to take advantage of this. Thanks again for a fantastic job!!\n\n- J. P.\n\nI just wanted to extend my heartfelt thanks to you and Adam for an absolutely memorable weekend! Thanks to your recommendation, I was able to volunteer for the weekend, and truly can't think of a better way to spend an great 4 days! I met many lovely people, enjoyed myself thoroughly, and all in all appreciate everything you and Creation have done to make events like this such an amazing experience.\n\nI hope to be able to volunteer again in the future when needed, and hope to continue to be involved in your wonderful events!\n\nThanks, and congratulations for a great weekend!\n\n- M.S.\n\nOne of the many thousands of people you took \"photo-op\" pictures of this past couple days in vegas for the Star Trek Convention. I just wanted to take the time to actually say thank you...I loveeeee all my photos and am so happy that you captured them so well. In any case thank you again from a random fan among many hope to see ya next year!\n\nSincerely, R.M.\n\nI was at the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention this past weekend....AWESOME......\n\n- K. L.\n\nThe convention was great! We had a blast and hopefully it will be on Howard (Stern) TV in October, thanks and take care!\n\n- R.C."
