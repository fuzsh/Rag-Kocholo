        "text": "In this interview, we explore the journey of Becky Nesel, also known as Geo-Beck, from her childhood explorations in Upstate New York to becoming a prominent geology influencer. Despite initial doubts about pursuing science, Beckyâ€™s curiosity led her to discover a passion for geology in college, eventually inspiring her to transition into content creation full-time. Through her website, engaging videos and social media presence, Becky challenges stereotypes, demystifies geology, and encourages others to view the world through a geological lens. Her story is a testament to the power of passion, perseverance, and creativity in inspiring curiosity and making science accessible to all.\n\nCould you share a bit about how your journey in geology began? Did you always have a passion for geology, or did it develop over time?\n\nYes, during my childhood, I spent a considerable amount of time outdoors. My family engaged in numerous outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, and kayaking. Growing up in Upstate New York, we often visited the Catskills and the Adirondacks. These experiences nurtured my curiosity about nature. I frequently found myself pondering the origins of the landscapes around usâ€”how lakes, mountains, and rocks came to be. Although this curiosity was always present, it wasnâ€™t until college that I realized geology was a field one could pursue academically and professionally. While selecting a major during my second year, I discovered geology listed on my universityâ€™s website. Faced with the need to choose a major as I was nearing the completion of my general education classes, I decided to give it a try. Iâ€™ve always had a fondness for rocks and the outdoors, so I thought, â€˜Why not?â€™ I reasoned that if it didnâ€™t resonate with me, I could always switch to another field. However, from the moment I attended the first class, I was captivated.\n\nHave you always been a science person?\n\nInterestingly, when I started college, I was undeclared. I entered with the mindset that, although I was unsure of what to study or which major to choose, I was certain it wouldnâ€™t be in the sciences. My assumption was that science was too challenging, required too much work, or that perhaps I wasnâ€™t sufficiently adept for it. My enjoyment of science in school was limited; I recall somewhat liking science in middle school, but any other science class I took thereafter felt like a chore. I was merely fulfilling a requirement, aiming to exert the minimum effort necessary and then move on. Therefore, it was a significant surprise to myself that I ultimately chose a science as my major.\n\nIf you didnâ€™t end up doing geology, what do you think you would have ended up doing.\n\nBefore settling on geology, I had tentatively chosen a different major, but I never actually enrolled in any of the relevant courses. I had declared Global and International Studies as my major without truly understanding what it encompassed. The idea appealed to me because I was interested in travel and learning about different cultures and places, so it seemed intriguing at first glance. However, as I began to explore other majors in preparation for registering for classes, I realized that Global and International Studies was not quite what I had anticipated. This exploration led me to discover geology. I also considered pursuing a major in human development, especially after enjoying a related class in my freshman year. Yet, none of these options truly resonated with me the way geology did once I started delving into it.\n\nWhen it clicked, was it a sudden thing, or was it something you were into when you were younger?\n\nI had virtually no knowledge about geology before declaring it as my major, which is curious considering I didnâ€™t understand much about the field. I even naively thought that it wasnâ€™t a â€˜realâ€™ science, a misconception that, surprisingly, is quite common. This misunderstanding partly fueled my confidence in choosing it, under the impression that it would be manageable because it wasnâ€™t a â€˜seriousâ€™ science. However, geology proved to be a rigorous discipline, and it challenged me significantly. Yet, the realization of its complexity and depth came quickly once I began my coursework.\n\nIn my initial classes, I experienced a profound sense of discovery, learning to identify various rocks and minerals and understanding the vast timescales of our planetâ€™s history, about which I had previously known nothing. These topics were utterly fascinating, revealing a whole new world to me. My curiosity was boundless, and I found myself eager to learn more. This same sense of excitement and wonder, which now arises when I explore new topics for videos or articles, mirrors the feelings I had in those early days of my studies. Itâ€™s a recurring sensation of enthusiasm and curiosity, reminiscent of the wonder I felt as a child when exploring the natural world. This reconnection to my childhood curiosity was what truly compelled me to continue my studies in geology.\n\nWhat do you love about geology?\n\nThere are countless aspects of geology that captivate me. Personally, the perpetual learning journey stands out most significantly. The realization that I will never know everything about this field used to be quite daunting, reflecting my initial intimidation by science as a whole. However, this endless frontier of knowledge has become one of the aspects I cherish most about geology. Unlike other disciplines where answers might be more definitive, geology thrives on interpretation and perspective. While it is grounded in undeniable facts and principles from physics and chemistry, the field allows, and even encourages, diverse interpretations from scientists based on their unique insights and observations. This openness to creativity and inquiry is thrilling to me, offering endless opportunities to ask questions and explore.\n\nMoreover, I am fascinated by the diversity within geology itself. The science encompasses a vast array of topics, each with its own depth and complexity. This variety not only broadens the scope of what one can learn and discover but also highlights the interconnectedness of our planetâ€™s history, processes, and future. Itâ€™s this combination of never-ending learning, the blend of certainty and interpretation, and the rich diversity of the field that makes geology so profoundly engaging to me.\n\nAdditionally, the opportunity to be outdoors significantly enriches my experience in geology. This aspect not only reinforces my passion for travel but also my desire to explore new places. Thereâ€™s always the chance to encounter something entirely new, to be surprised by the natural world. I appreciate the humility that comes with understanding that Iâ€™ll never be a complete authority in the science.\n\nHow did you get into influencing?\n\nAfter graduating college, I embarked on a career in the construction and engineering industry, but it quickly became apparent that it wasnâ€™t the right fit for me. Despite learning a great deal, I yearned for a connection to geology, which my job didnâ€™t provide. I missed sharing my enthusiasm and curiosity about geology, and I realized that my role didnâ€™t allow me to expand my knowledge in this area as I had hoped.\n\nIn my interactions with contractors, drillers, and engineersâ€”many of whom had little knowledge of geologyâ€”I found joy in explaining the geological significance of the soils and rocks we encountered. Their interest and surprise in learning about something they saw daily but never truly understood reignited my passion for teaching and sharing knowledge.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic began, I left my job, feeling uncertain about my future direction. In search of the fulfillment I had lost, I created a YouTube video to share why I love geology. This initial video led to more content creation, including a piece on the formation of the Hudson River next to where I grew up, marking the end of the last Ice Age. My journey into digital content creation expanded to TikTok and later Instagram, the latter becoming my primary source of income through brand partnerships.\n\nThis transition wasnâ€™t immediate; it spanned about three years, during which my commitment fluctuated due to part-time jobs and other commitments. However, by the beginning of 2023, I decided to pursue content creation full-time. It was a significant leap, driven by a desire to make my passion a sustainable career. I took the risk, hoping to find success in this new path.\n\nHave you always been comfortable in front of a camera?\n\nEmbarking on this unexpected path has been quite a journey for me, especially considering my longstanding aversion to public speaking. Suffering from an anxiety disorder, Iâ€™ve always found presentations and speaking in front of people to be daunting challenges. This began to change in college when I realized that I could communicate effectively about topics I was passionate about. My confidence grew when discussing these subjects, particularly in the supportive environment of small groups composed of friends, classmates, and professors with whom I had formed close relationships.\n\nDespite these gains, my initial foray into creating videos and speaking on camera was marked by significant nervousness. The prospect of presenting myself to an audience in this new medium pushed me well beyond my comfort zone. However, by persistently challenging myself, I have gradually become much more comfortable with public speaking and content creation. This journey has taught me the value of stepping into unfamiliar territories, especially when fueled by a passion for sharing knowledge and curiosity.\n\nAs a geology influencer, how do you see yourself? How do you see your role in educating people, getting them interested and engaged with geology?\n\nI firmly believe itâ€™s crucial for the public to perceive scientists as multifaceted, human individuals, rather than the stereotypical image of all-knowing, detached figures. This perception shift is particularly important in geology, a field where the archetypical image has long been that of an older white man with a beard, as often depicted in media. By presenting myself as a young woman actively engaged in geology, I hope to challenge and change these stereotypes, showing that the field is accessible and intriguing to a broader audience.\n\nMoreover, my goal is to illustrate how geology intersects with various aspects of our everyday lives, such as architecture, travel, and tourism, in ways people might not expect. By sharing my enthusiasm for geology, I aim to unveil the fascinating world beneath our feetâ€”a world integral to our daily experiences yet frequently overlooked. My greatest joy comes from enlightening others, offering them a new perspective on the world around them. It feels almost empowering to provide someone with this fresh lens through which to view their environment, revealing the unseen connections and wonders of geology that surround us all.\n\nYour videos, you have a great feel to them. They are really welcoming. Whatâ€™s your process like? Where do you start?\n\nIâ€™m passionate about encouraging more individuals to consider science communication as a career path, as there are many who could excel in this field. My approach to creating content isnâ€™t rigidly structured but starts with an idea that often comes spontaneously. I maintain an ongoing list of these ideas, either digitally or in a notebook, to ensure I never lose a potential topic.\n\nWhen a particular idea captures my attention or has been on my mind for a while, I begin by conducting a comprehensive brainstorming session. This can take place in a Google Doc or a journal, where I jot down everything that fascinates me about the subject and the key messages I wish to convey. The next step involves creating an outline, which is a common initial phase for both Instagram and YouTube content, helping me organize my thoughts and plan the structure of the piece.\n\nFor YouTube, the process is more extensive. I plan the locations for filming, the shots I need, and the specific points I want to highlight on camera. A shot list is prepared to ensure I capture all necessary B-roll and direct-to-camera segments. This preparation precedes the actual filming, which is scheduled based on the locations and content needs.\n\nInstagram content varies; if Iâ€™m creating a voiceover with B-roll, I allow for spontaneity during filming, capturing footage as inspired by the moment. Assistance from friends or my boyfriend in filming or photography is invaluable here. After gathering footage, I review it alongside my initial outline to script a voiceover that complements the visuals. The final step involves recording the voiceover, editing the footage to align with the audio, and then refining the entire piece for posting.\n\nYouTube projects, especially those requiring multiple locations, demand a more meticulous and time-consuming approach. For example, a recent video exploring the brick industry in the Hudson Valley and its ties to glacial history and New York Cityâ€™s architecture spanned several months, from conception in January or February to posting in October. Despite the lengthy process, the joy of sharing the finished work makes it all worthwhile.\n\nDid you have a background in any videography before this? Or did you learn on the fly?\n\nIâ€™ve learned as Iâ€™ve gone along and am still learning. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed creating short videos during my travels, a hobby that began in high school and continued through college. Whenever I went on a trip, I would make a fun little video on iMovie, albeit in a very amateur manner. I was never really proficient at it. When I first started making videos for SciCom, I used iMovie on my computer, along with some free programs. Now, Iâ€™ve transitioned to Adobe Premiere Pro, which has been a significant learning curve. However, itâ€™s an incredibly useful software for what I aim to achieve and allows me room to grow. But yes, I never really had formal experience with video editing. I do have some experience with photography, though. Iâ€™ve always been passionate about photography. My sister is a wedding photographer, and Iâ€™ve assisted her several times. So, I guess that experience somewhat contributes to my video production skills.\n\nWhat are your basic essential tools?\n\nYes, I have. My phone is indispensable, especially for most of my Instagram content. Additionally, I use a Canon 5D full-frame camera for photography. My goal this year, and moving forward, is to incorporate more photography into my work and to enhance my skills in that area. Iâ€™m considering switching to a Sony mirrorless camera soon, which would be suitable for both video and photography. It would also serve as an easier option for travel. Currently, when I travel, my gear feels somewhat cumbersome. I carry my 5D, which is an older and heavier model, along with a smaller, more compact Canon M50 for video. This setup is not very efficient. Therefore, Iâ€™m hoping to transition to using just one main camera and gradually expand my equipment from there.\n\nYou post on 3 main platforms, and different social media platforms have sort of different voices and different feels to them. Do you cater to each of them, or do you just kind of tweak your content a enough to fit a platform?\n\nNavigating the creation of content for YouTube and social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok presents an ongoing challenge for me. On YouTube, with its longer-form content, I find I can more authentically express my personality and voice. The format allows for a conversational tone and more experimental editing. I enjoy incorporating animations Iâ€™ve created in Procreate and exploring different editing techniques.\n\nHowever, the nature of short-form content on Instagram and TikTok requires a more concise approach due to the shorter attention spans of their audiences. While both platforms have their trends, they tend to differ significantly. I make an effort to stay informed about these trends on each platform, but I avoid letting them dictate my creative process. Focusing too much on trends can stifle my creativity.\n\nInstead, I often start with an idea for a voiceover and then add a song I like, which might be gaining popularity, as background music. This approach allows me to maintain my creativity without being constrained by the need to follow trends strictly. Occasionally, if a trend aligns naturally with an idea I have, Iâ€™ll embrace it.\n\nDealing with the algorithms of each platform can be frustrating, especially when efforts to cater to them donâ€™t yield the desired results. This can be discouraging. To mitigate this, I strive to maintain a balance, allowing myself to create content that reflects my voice and interests while occasionally integrating popular elements when they fit naturally with my ideas.\n\nCan you share some memorable sort of experiences? What are some things that stand out to you?\n\nReflecting on the past few years, the most rewarding aspect for me has been witnessing the fruits of my labor finally gaining traction, allowing me to pursue this passion as a full-time career. The realization that my efforts have transformed into a sustainable income source is both incredible and surreal. Iâ€™m optimistic that this is just the beginning.\n\nMoreover, Iâ€™ve surprised myself with achievements I never imagined possible. A highlight of this year was collaborating with several tourism boards, a notable experience being my first trip with Travel Nevada. I embarked on a road trip spanning from Reno to Great Basin National Park in the east, before concluding in Las Vegas. This journey marked my first visit to Nevada, presenting an opportunity to explore the state comprehensively, from its vast deserts to the intriguing town of Tonopah. Here, I experienced rockhounding at various locations, including a turquoise mine, which was a stark contrast to what I anticipated enjoying. The repetitive landscape of mountains and valleys, coupled with the thrill of discovering rocks, made me ponder the surreal nature of my life at that moment, getting paid to do what I love.\n\nLastly, the connections Iâ€™ve forged have been invaluable. Iâ€™ve made friends both within and beyond the United States, some of whom Iâ€™ve met in person and others I plan to. These relationships are incredibly special to me. I realize this answer is lengthy, but these experiences have truly shaped my journey.\n\nYou have a TV show â€” New York Rocks with Geo Beck â€” as well. How did that happen?\n\nI collaborate with a production company called Hudsey, based in the Hudson Valley, my hometown and current residence. Hudsey is a remarkable small production company and streaming platform known for creating outstanding documentaries, shows, and films that either involve locals or are about the area. My connection with them began when I discovered a submission form on their website, inviting content creators to propose their work for potential licensing on their soon-to-launch platform. Intrigued by the opportunity, I submitted my videos, hoping they might be interested in featuring them.\n\nTo my surprise, Hudsey reached out with an interest in collaborating on a project beyond just licensing my content. After a productive Zoom call, they proposed creating a show centered around geology, inspired by the quality and style of my videos. We filmed the pilot episode in March 2022, which debuted with the platformâ€™s launch in June. Following that, we shot the next episode at the Museum of Natural History in June, an experience I found thoroughly exhilarating.\n\nThis opportunity is available for free on their website, allowing anyone to sign up and watch the episodes, which is an aspect I find particularly exciting. Initially, I was apprehensive about being on camera, especially with professional cinema equipment, as opposed to my usual phone or beginner vlog camera. However, the Hudsey teamâ€™s support made me feel comfortable and confident. Working with them has been an incredible journey, allowing me to not only be in front of the camera but also to produce and brainstorm ideas for the show.\n\nCollaborating with Hudsey has expanded my capabilities, providing support in video production aspects I typically managed alone. Our partnership has opened doors to unique experiences I couldnâ€™t have pursued independently, such as our upcoming project to film in an underground marble quarry in Vermont. This collaboration has been a significant and exciting part of my journey.\n\nWhatâ€™s your favorite rock?\n\nChoosing a favorite is always challenging for me, but if I had to pick, my favorite rock is actually a mineral called labradorite. Labradorite is fascinating due to its labradorescence effect, which is truly captivating. At certain angles, it may appear almost clear or black, but as you shift its position to catch the light differently, it reveals stunning hues of blue. Further rotation can unveil yellowish-orange alongside blue tones. This remarkable color play results from its unique crystal structure and the way light rays are refracted and partially trapped within, while others are reflected back to our eyes. This phenomenon, combined with its beauty, makes labradorite particularly intriguing to me.\n\nFavorite geological places youâ€™ve been.\n\nThe Republic of Georgia holds a special place in my heart, largely because my boyfriendâ€™s family originates from there. Our visit a few years ago opened my eyes to what I now consider the most incredible place Iâ€™ve ever experienced. The prospect of returning fills me with excitement, eager to further explore its diverse landscape. Georgia offers a unique blend of natural wonders, from majestic mountains and the serene Black Sea to its abundant volcanic rocks.\n\nDuring our previous visit, we ventured into the mountains, among the tallest in Europe, and the scenery was simply breathtaking. The presence of geothermal hot springs added another layer of wonder to our adventure, with landscapes so surreal they scarcely seemed real. Georgiaâ€™s rich natural and cultural tapestry makes it an endlessly fascinating destination that I long to explore more deeply.\n\nDo you have any advice for aspiring geologists?\n\nMy primary piece of advice for anyone embarking on a new venture is to start with what you have. Thereâ€™s a limit to how much planning, thinking, dreaming, and organizing one can do before feeling ready, and the truth is, you might never feel fully prepared to start something new or uncomfortable. The key is to simply begin. Your initial attempts may not be perfectâ€”my first videos certainly werenâ€™tâ€”but itâ€™s through taking those first steps that you gain momentum. Starting sets the wheels in motion, providing you with the motivation to experiment, learn, and improve. Itâ€™s in this process of doing and iterating that real progress is made.\n\nIMAGE CREDIT: Becky Nesel.\n\nSign up for the Daily Dose Newsletter and get the morningâ€™s best science news from around the web delivered straight to your inbox?
