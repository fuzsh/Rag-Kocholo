        "text": "On July 12, 2019, Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 1054 and AB 111 (collectively, the “2019 Wildfire Legislation”). The 2019 Wildfire Legislation enacts a broad set of reforms and programs related to utility-caused wildfires in California, including establishing the California Wildfire Fund (“Fund”).\n\nThe purpose of the Fund is to provide a source of money to reimburse eligible claims arising from a covered wildfire caused by a utility company that participates in the Fund by assisting in capitalizing the Fund, and undertaking certain other obligations specified in the law. In addition to other requirements, a “covered wildfire” is only one that was ignited on or after July 12, 2019. Please note the California Wildfire Fund is a separate and different entity from the Fire Victim Trust.\n\nThere are three participating utility companies in the California Wildfire Fund.\n\nOversight of the administration of the Fund is the responsibility of the California Catastrophe Response Council (“Council”), created under AB 111. You can find out more information about the Council here. Under the oversight of the Council, the California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”) serves as the Administrator of the Fund.*\n\nImportant Note to Residents and Business Owners\n\nThe Fund exists as a mechanism for utility companies to recover certain costs and expenses arising from covered wildfires. By statute, the Fund is only authorized to distribute funds directly to the utility companies after they have paid or settled eligible claims arising from a covered wildfire.\n\n​\n\nIf you are an individual or business owner seeking a financial recovery or related support from the impact of a wildfire, information on the following sites may be helpful to you:\n\n​\n\nFire Victim Trust (for the 2015 Butte Fire, 2017 North Bay Fires and 2018 Camp Fire)\n\nCalifornia Community Foundation’s Wildfire Recovery Fund\n\nCalifornia Department of Insurance: Resources to Help Recent Wildfire Survivors\n\n​\n\nThe newly created California Catastrophe Response Council (Council) is responsible for oversight of the California Wildfire Fund. The Council has nine members, consisting of the following:\n\n​\n\nGovernor\n\nInsurance Commissioner\n\nTreasurer\n\nSecretary of Natural Resources\n\nOne member appointed by the California Senate Rules Committee\n\nOne member appointed by the Speaker of the California Assembly\n\nThree members of the public, appointed by the Governor to serve two-year terms\n\nThe Governor, Insurance Commissioner, Treasurer and Secretary of Natural Resources are each authorized by law to designate individuals to serve on their behalf as members of the Council. Among other things, the Council is charged with appointing an “Administrator” for the Wildfire Fund. The Council named California Earthquake Authority (CEA)* the Administrator of the California Wildfire Fund on April 23, 2020.\n\n*Assets in the California Earthquake Authority Fund and the California Wildfire Fund are segregated and separately managed and maintained. All costs and expenses incurred by the Authority to administer the Wildfire Fund are allocated to and paid from the Wildfire Fund."
