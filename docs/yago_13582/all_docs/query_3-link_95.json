        "text": "Rebecca Stark, Photographer\n\nCreativity runs in my family, so I knew I had to unleash my creativity in some form or another. I fell in love with photography at an early age with the first click, pic, and print.\n\nI didn't just \"pick up\" the art of photography. I've trained in studio portraiture as well as photojournalism. Plus, I continue to learn new techniques by attending photography workshops to hone my craft.\n\nWhen we have a shoot, I like to get to know you first, find out what locations you have in mind, and focus on posing & lighting during your session, so you look your absolute best.\n\nWith over 15 years of experience photographing weddings, portraits, and events, my photos will make you look as radiant as you are in real life. My style is eclectic yet flexible. So let's have fun capturing the true you.\n\nI'm glad you found me!\n\nGive me a call or\n\nshoot me an email.\n\nI'd love to chat about your session. : )"
