        "text": "Catching Up With..\n\nCatching Up With...Rebecca Stark Nugent\n\nRebecca Stark Nugent is a Boomer ball of fire. She just completed her first novel, If the Devil Had a Wife and then wrapped up filming on a feature length documentary about the novel.\n\nShe's spent the better part of her life as a writer, educator and public relations expert and now she's having the time of her life as a celebrated author. Since Rebecca's the writer, guess we'd better let HER tell the story...\n\nWhat are you doing these days?\n\nIf I'm not on the road promoting the book, time spent at home allows me to wind down and catch up on other projects in the hopper. I am making final revisions to the documentary...have two other books in the beginning stages and six grandchildren (ranging in age from 3 to 14) to visit!\n\nSeems like all I do these days is repack, drive, and sign or talk about my book. I've traveled to book signings and presentations from Las Vegas to Savannah, with most of my time spent in Texas and Louisiana. I'm heading out to Phoenix in March to talk about \"Getting Started on Your First Book\" at Sun City Grand. I always enjoy the opportunity to visit with book clubs or civic groups.\n\nSounds like the book is taking a lot of your time. When did you write it and what inspired you?\n\nIf the Devil Had a Wife is my first literary effort and was rather detail-oriented. My goal was to have it read like a novel, but it was actually a true story. Curiosity is what led me to write it. I started going through boxes supposedly filled with \"family history\" in 1996, only to become even more interested as I was hooked on the first box.\n\nI finally realized there were some interesting pieces missing and that's when I spent my weekends and breaks at courthouses and libraries, or interviewing eye witnesses, many of whom had worked for my grandfather. Never really thought about writing a book, but it was my family's story and with my parents as inspiration I knew I had to do it.\n\nRebecca Stark Nugent and grandson Kyle\n\nWhat did you do before becoming a writer?\n\nStarted out after college as a newspaper reporter in Big Spring (TX), then taught journalism and history at Stark High School in Orange (TX) before spending most of my time as a Director of Community Relations for Texas school districts (Spring ISD, Highland Park ISD and Bryan ISD). Then worked as the Director of Communications for the City of College Station (TX) until I resigned in 2008 to help care for my father after my mother died.\n\nWhen are you your most creative?\n\nLate evening into the morning hours is my favorite time to write. No interruptions and the dog is asleep!\n\nHow do you write - pen and paper, computer, laptop...tell us a little about the process.\n\nIf only you could see my dining room, or what was formerly my dining room! Most of my notes are contained in spiral notebooks or legal pads, some even on hotel notepads or an occasional napkin. When it comes to the actual writing, however, I use a laptop that is my constant companion.\n\nWhere do you live and how long have you lived there?\n\nMoved to Bryan, TX in 1994 and love being in Aggieland. It is one of the friendliest places I've ever been and we don't need a helicopter to give us a traffic report. Since both my sons graduated from Texas A&M, I'm assured of a few visits each year when they come for football or other sports events.\n\nFavorite movie?\n\nHuge fan of The Verdict with Paul Newman (love it when the good guys win!), but my favorite is the documentary based on my book that is currently in production. Turner Classic movies are a great diversion to some of the programming I find on television. Even if I've seen the movie before -- and sometimes because I've seen it before -- it just takes me back to a place in time that I feel the world was a better, safer place. No computers or internet, but we could play outside anytime we wanted.\n\nDog or cat?\n\nDefinitely a dog. Although I love golden retrievers, I have been partial to Yorkies for more than 40 years. Jasper, a 4 lb. rescue dog found roaming the streets of Houston, travels everywhere with me -- plane or car.\n\nWhat kind of car do you drive?\n\nLove my Honda Pilot. It's Army green -- just riding in it soothes the soul. Plus it's perfect to transport books and supplies for the various book fairs and other destinations. With more than 140,000 miles, it is still in great condition and gets me where I need to be.\n\nCelebrity you'd like to meet.\n\nRobert Redford would top that list. Always admired not only his good looks, but his ease on the screen and the ability to become each character he plays. Clint Eastwood would be second, primarily because he's come a long way since Rowdy Yates and continues to impress both behind the camera and in front of it.\n\nFavorite television show?\n\nThat would be a three-way tie between NCIS, The Mentalist, and anything with Tom Selleck. Both NCIS and The Mentalist present problem solving opportunities and I'm always trying to put pieces of the puzzle together!\n\nComments"
