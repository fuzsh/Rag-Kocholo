In the stunning finale of Becky Chamber’s Wayfarer Series, The Galaxy, And The Ground Within, three strangers do their best to help those at the fringes of the Galactic Commons after a freak technological failure brings all traffic to a halt, while in Stark Holborn’s Ten Low an ex-con ventures on a breakneck race to escape across an alien moon thriving with aliens and criminals.

Two telling tales to remind us that we are not alone in space!
