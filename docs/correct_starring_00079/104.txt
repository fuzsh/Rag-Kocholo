Double Feature withWithnail and I (6:30 PM)

One ticket gives admission to both films.

How to Get Ahead in Advertising is a satire on the advertising world written and directed by Bruce Robinson (Oscar-nominated writer of "The Killing Fields"). It was the follow-up to his cult hit directing debut, "Withnail and I." Like "Withnail," the film starred Richard E. Grant - in this outing with co-star Rachel Ward. The movie is a farce about a mentally unstable advertising executive who suffers a nervous breakdown while making an advert for pimple cream. The exec has a crisis of conscience about the ethics of advertising, which leads to mania. He then develops a boil on his right shoulder that comes to life with a face, voice and vengeance. Among the cast - iconic upper-class Brit Roddy Maude-Roxby ("Rowan and Martin's Laugh In") in one of his last movie roles and Sean Bean ("Lord of the Rings" trilogy) in one of his first.
