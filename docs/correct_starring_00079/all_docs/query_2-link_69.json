        "text": "From the offices of Sullivan Bristol, advertising executive Dennis Bagley looks out of his window towards the Houses of Parliament. The view from Westminster Tower at the junction of Albert Embankment and Lambeth Road in SE1 with Lambeth Bridge in the foreground. The location also appears in 'How to Get Ahead in Advertising'. 'George and Mildred', 'The Reluctant Bride', 'The Cracksman', 'Seventy Deadly Pills', 'A Dandy in Aspic', 'The Naked Truth', 'Midnight Lace', 'The Vault of Horror' and many other productions.\n\nTurning from the view, Dennis Dimbleby Bagley (Richard E. Grant) tries again to come up with a brilliant advertisement for a very dull pimple cream. To the right, Lambeth Palace can be seen through the window.\n\nAfter lunch, Bagley’s wife Julia drives him back to the office. Looking north along Albert Embankment with Lambeth Bridge and the Houses of Parliament to the left.\n\nBagley gets out of the passenger seat and walks round to the driver’s side of the car. Across the river to the right stands the Tate Gallery on Millbank. The gallery was renamed Tate Britain in 2000.\n\nAnd to the left we can see the work, which replaces Consort House seen in \"Hot Enough for June\" and \"A Pair of Briefs\", coming to an end . SJ\n\nOn the train home, Bagley rants at his fellow first class passengers about adverising and the press. Through the window, Didcot Parkway station comes into view.\n\nAfter alighting from the train at ‘Datchet’ a Priest (Gordon Gostelow) is shocked by Bagley as he continues his tirade whilst leaning through the carriage window. Platform 5 at Didcot Parkway station in Oxfordshire.\n\nAt the Bagley’s luxury home in the country, Julia wakes to find her husband slowly going out of his mind. Winchfield House, Odiham Road, Winchfield, Hook, Hampshire identified by Steve Randall. The property also appears in 'The Company of Wolves'."
