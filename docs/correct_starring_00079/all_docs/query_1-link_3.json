        "text": "“Edgar, you sly old fox!”—Edgar to himself.\n\nEdgar Balthazar is the main antagonist of Disney's 1970 animated feature film, The Aristocats. He was the loyal butler to rich millionairess Madame Bonfamille, until he finds out that she is going to leave her entire fortune to Duchess and her kittens, leading to him turning greedy and plotting to get rid of the cats in order to become the sole inheritor of his employer’s fortune, and is the archnemesis of Thomas O’Malley.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nEdgar is portrayed as a sophisticated, loyal, and polite butler, yet underneath his exterior belies a scheming, greedy, impatient, and egotistical man (though this attitude only sparks because Madame Bonfamille’s fortune is mentioned; otherwise, he would have willingly remained loyal to his mistress, thus eliminating his antagonistic role).\n\nWhile Edgar is highly manipulative and selfish, he seems to have some degree of empathy. It would have been easy for him to just kill Duchess and her kittens, but instead, he chose only to kidnap them and release them into the wild; and when that did not work so well, he decided to ship them to Timbuktu as well as when he fought Thomas O’Malley with a pitchfork, he used it to restrain the cat instead of impaling or killing him. This means that Edgar clearly has a better sense of morality than villains like Cruella de Vil and is far more clumsy than villainous, as evidenced from his bumbling antics; from stumbling over a trash can to mistaking a tree branch for a gun to his back, making a clumsy U-turn on his motorcycle away from the police to riding his motorcycle down the subway stairs by mistake (nearly being hit by a train), spitting out a mouthful of wine in shock when he hears the kittens meowing loudly at the door, getting his shoelaces tied together by Roquefort the mouse and tripping on them, and (most comical of all) getting in a situation involving Napoleon and Lafayette (two farm dogs) attacking him. He is also more misunderstood than evil, as shown when he didn’t hear about the entire truth of the will and jumped to conclusions.\n\nThough certainly clever and deceitful, Edgar isn’t as intelligent as he thinks he is. He is also shown to be an extremely irrational and unintelligent imbecile; as shown by the fact that he seems to take the expression that cats have nine lives literally, explaining his belief that he’d be dead long before the cats pass away, not to mention that he counted the years they would live one after the other. He also doesn’t seem to realize that even if Duchess and her kittens could outlive him, he’d still have control over their inherited wealth, since as cats, they obviously can’t use money by themselves and he’d simply have been legally obligated to care for them until they reached the end of their lives. However, one explanation may be that Edgar might have had to use some of the money on the cats’ welfare and care, when he really just wants it all for himself.\n\nRole in the film[]\n\nEdgar is introduced as Madame Adelaide’s faithful butler. However, after hearing that Madame has stated in her will that she intends to give all of her fortune to her cats and he only can access it once they all die, Edgar despairs, foolishly believing that by the time the cats die, he will already be dead of old age (as he believed that cats literally have nine lives, unaware that he, of course, will be kept in charge of the fortune). Because of this, he begins scheming to get rid of them. To ensure this, he mixes sleeping pills in the cats’ milk that afternoon, and nearly tasted it himself before realizing the better of it. Delivering the milk to the cats as their dinner, he leaves them until they have consumed it all. Roquefort the mouse (who is a friend of the cats) is also invited to eat and, being much smaller than the cats, succumbs quickly to the “Crème de la crème a la Edgar” as well, but is ignored by Edgar.\n\nThat night, once the cats are all asleep, Edgar sneaks them out of the mansion and drives out into the countryside to abandon them in his motorcycle, so paranoid about his actions that he accidentally drives into a subway station on the way. After having left the city, Edgar drives by an old mill, planning on throwing them off the bridge and into the river below. His plan in inadvertently foiled by two dogs, Napoleon and Lafayette, who reside on a nearby farm, when they spot the butler and begin their pastime of chasing anything on wheels. Desperate to escape alive, Edgar drives off the road and through a river, thereby losing the basket containing the cats. After a frantic chase ending with Edgar crashing through the wall of the mill, he heads back to the city, leaving his umbrella, bowler hat, shoes, and sidecar behind at the farm, not noticing the loss until he returns to the mansion. When the cats awaken in the wilderness, Toulouse tells his mother that Edgar did this to them, but she brushes this assumption off, claiming that Edgar would never do such a thing.\n\nThe next morning, everyone in the mansion is distraught at the cats’ disappearance. Edgar is the only resident feeling happy and content, much to the surprise of Roquefort and Frou-Frou. Unaware that Frou-Frou is an intelligent horse, Edgar, in his overconfidence, brags about his act, showing her his wrongdoings through the newspaper detailing the kidnapping, which disgusts her and Roquefort as he gloats over the news. His happiness is cut short when he suddenly remembers that he lost his hat, umbrella, basket (which Duchess and the kittens were contained in before the skirmish with the dogs) and the motorcycle sidecar at the crime scene. Distraught, he plans to return to the mill that night to retrieve his lost things in order to evade possible arrest from the authorities.\n\nThat night, equipped with a fishing rod, Edgar once again drives off, this time closely followed by Roquefort, who has hidden in Edgar’s tail light. However, during the ride, Roquefort is shaken out of the light and left in the streets of Paris. Edgar returns to the mill to find Napoleon and Lafayette asleep in the sidecar and the basket, with Napoleon wearing Edgar’s hat. The dogs are awoken by the squeaking of Edgar’s shoes but decide they only heard a cricket. First, he then tries to get his hat back, which he does by rubbing Napoleon’s belly while he is asleep. Next, he then tries to get the basket as well, dropping Lafayette into the sidecar. But when he tries to get his umbrella, he accidentally activates the sidecar’s horn and wakes up the dogs. Having been discovered, Edgar then drives off and escapes with his things, successfully defeating Napoleon and Lafayette and eliminating all evidence of his crimes.\n\nEdgar is once again feeling pleased with himself and celebrates with a bottle of red wine. Realizing he must do something about Edgar, Roquefort ties his shoelaces together. As the cat door is barred, the kittens, having returned home with their mother with help from an alley cat, Thomas O’Malley, start meowing. When Edgar hears this, he is shocked and quickly gets up, only to fall down. Roquefort uses this opportunity to try to get the cats’ attention and warn them to run. However, although they do see him, they cannot hear what he’s saying. Shocked over their return and determined to get rid of them for good, Edgar traps Duchess and her kittens in a sack after letting them into the house. However, before he can do anything, he is forced to hide the sack in the cold oven, as Madame enters the hall, also having heard the cats as well. Believing the cats to be outside, Adelaide orders Edgar to open the door to let them in but sees that no one is waiting outside. After a moment, Adelaide is forced to admit that no one is outside. As Edgar pretends to sympathize with her, Duchess is able to communicate with Roquefort, who sends him to find Thomas O’Malley.\n\nWhile Roquefort goes for help, Edgar locks himself in the stable and locks the cats into a trunk, planning to send them to Timbuktu, Mali to ensure they will never return. But before he can start taking the chest outside, O’Malley immediately attacks him, and he and Frou-Frou desperately try to stop Edgar. Furiously, Edgar chases O’Malley with a pitchfork, but soon gets attacked by Scat Cat and his gang as well. After Roquefort has managed to unlock the trunk (after temporarily getting the fighting to stop by shouting at everyone to be quiet), Thomas jumps into the trunk to help Duchess and the kittens, but closes it again, still intending to ship them to Timbuktu. To prevent this, the alley cats with help from Frou-Frou keep Edgar occupied long enough to be able to open the trunk, thus allowing the cats to escape. After the Duchess, Thomas and the kittens have jumped out, Frou-Frou kicks Edgar into the trunk, slamming it shut and trapping him inside. The shipping company arrives and, seeing only one possible trunk, take it (unaware that Edgar is inside) and load it onto the truck. It’s completely unknown what happens to Edgar after this, but it’s likely that she starved to death or suffocated inside the trunk, as there was no food nor holes to breathe. Although, he could also have been discovered inside the trunk and released from it, albeit already far from France. If this is the case, then he is currently living in Timbuktu, with no riches, as his punishment.\n\nThe next day, Madame presumably never discovers Edgar’s treachery, assuming that he simply left on his own accord, and as such, excludes him from her will. While this doesn’t confirm anything, this implies that she possibly ultimately planned to distribute her fortune between the cats and Edgar, something that he himself, either alive or dead, would never know.\n\nOther appearances[]\n\nEdgar makes a cameo appearance in the 2023 short film, Once Upon a Studio.\n\nGallery[]\n\nMedia Universe Wiki has a collection of images related to Edgar Balthazar.\n\nTrivia[]"
