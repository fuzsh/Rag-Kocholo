        "text": "Disney+ has been a saving grace for The Walt Disney Company over the past few years, especially during the pandemic. Now, the streaming platform is a significant source of income for the company, with new and original stories being developed specifically for Disney+.\n\nWe have seen the rise of the Star Wars universe through the insanely successful seasons of The Mandalorian, Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and more. Just recently, over 11 million Marvel fans tuned into the final episode of Loki.\n\nIt offers a vast library of content from various Disney-owned franchises, including classic animated films, Pixar movies, Marvel Cinematic Universe films and series, Star Wars content, National Geographic documentaries, and more. Disney+ provides a family-friendly platform that caters to audiences of all ages.\n\nThe service also features original content produced exclusively for Disney+, such as original series like High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, WandaVision, and Moon Knight, as well as original movies. With a child-friendly interface, Disney+ allows subscribers to explore a wide array of beloved Disney classics and new, exclusive content on-demand, making it a popular choice for entertainment enthusiasts.\n\nFor many, Disney+ was a way to shrink down that VHS collection that many have been collecting for years, and have everything in one place. No longer is the term “be kind, rewind” applicable.\n\nWhen Disney+ first debuted, it implemented precautions by providing a warning for subscribers to read regarding potentially controversial scenes in some of Disney’s classic content. Notably, scenes from films like Disney’s Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp raised concerns.\n\nIn Dumbo, the depiction of black crows singing “When I see an Elephant Fly” has been criticized for its potentially negative representation of African Americans. Similarly, in Lady and the Tramp, the Siamese Cats’ song, “The Siamese Cat Song,” was deemed catchy but controversial due to its lyrics.\n\nSoon after the discussions gained traction among fans, Disney+ subscribers observed warnings appended to some Disney Classics, including Dumbo, The Aristocats, The Jungle Book, and the original Lady and the Tramp. These warnings aimed to caution viewers about “outdated cultural depictions” and potential racial portrayals.\n\nInitially, these advisories appeared at the end of the film descriptions, but a recent update has shifted them to display after the movie begins.\n\nMovies affected by this change include Dumbo, The Jungle Book, the original Lady and the Tramp, Peter Pan, and Swiss Family Robinson.\n\nInterestingly, there’s a notable absence of the warning for a specific movie, which not only lacks the advisory but is entirely unavailable on the platform.\n\nIn a recent Reddit post, we noticed some Disney+ users complaining that Aristocats was no longer on the streaming platform, and after doing a quick check, we were able to confirm they were indeed correct.\n\nRelated: Disney+ Set to End, Huge Content Disappearance Reported\n\nIn case you have not seen the film, The Aristocats is a Disney animated film that follows the adventures of a family of aristocratic cats in Paris. When Madame Adelaide Bonfamille decides to leave her fortune to her beloved cats Duchess and her three kittens – Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse – her butler Edgar schemes to eliminate the feline heirs to inherit the wealth for himself.\n\nHowever, the cats find themselves in the French countryside and encounter an alley cat named Thomas O’Malley, who helps them find their way back to Paris. Along the journey, they face various challenges and share heartwarming moments, ultimately discovering the importance of family and friendship.\n\nWashington Informer reported that Disney officials clarified what was wrong with the film, “The Siamese cat Shun Gon is depicted as a racist caricature of East Asian peoples with exaggerated stereotypical traits such as slanted eyes and buck teeth.”\n\n“He sings in poorly accented English voiced by a white actor and plays the piano with chopsticks.”\n\nWhile the programming is restricted to small children, others will still be able to watch after viewing a new disclaimer that notes that the program includes “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now.”\n\nIn that article, “Disney+ officials also defended their decision not to remove the “offensive” films altogether.\n\n“Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together,” the company wrote.\n\nWarnings will also tag other shows like “The Lady and the Tramp,” and “Swiss Family Robinson.” Which is the warning we previously shared.\n\nHowever, this article was written in 2021, and over the past two years, it seems that Disney made the decision to remove The Aristocats entirely. While that film was taken off the platform, other films with the updated warning still remain.\n\nRelated: Disney CEO Reveals Disney+ as We Know It Will Shut Down in December, Tells Parents to “Prepare”\n\nThe warning on those films read:\n\nThis program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or culture. These stereotypes were wrong then and wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknlowedge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together. Disney is committed to creating stories with inspiration and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe. To learn more about how stories have impacted society visit www.Disney.com/StoriesMatter.\n\nThe Aristocats, Peter Pan, and Dumbo have all been removed from children’s profiles years ago, but this is a new development to see the movie missing on the regular Disney+ settings.\n\nInterestingly, the Disney parks recently had an entire Marie line of household products in their store, which seems like an odd thing to sell if the movie is not even available on the streaming platform, which likely indicates this was a much more recent removal."
