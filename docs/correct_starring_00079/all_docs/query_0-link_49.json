He can be always found, happy with a bag of tools and some materials to play with.\n\nCookery School Side\n\nMess Hall - Cookery School. In 2013, director Lu Kemp and Artangel began developing conversations about the meaning of care, health and wellbeing for older men in the UK. In particular, this was inspired by tales of men in their 80s learning to peel their first onion or being coached over the phone to make a meal following the death of their partners. These small details of everyday life demonstrate the consistent necessity to adapt, even into our final decades. Yet even more fundamentally, they reveal the untold stories of the mothers, partners, children and care-workers that provide the majority of care in our society. The project began by asking what happens when the care provided by families and the state disappears, and how we will begin to address this as our ageing population continues to grow.\n\nThese conversations led to the establishment of a weekly cookery course for men aged over 65, taught by professional chef and actor, Paul Cawley, at St Luke’s Community Centre in Islington. The men who joined the group came along through outreach workers at St Luke’s and Age UK Islington. Many had little experience of cooking, and as we came together to roll pastry, chop onions and experiment with spices, a community began to form.\n\nThe cookery classes provided a learning environment, social space, and an opportunity to exchange the difficulties, pleasure and issues around ageing and care for older men. In addition to the cookery class at St Luke’s, we ran further classes at Mile End Hospital with long-term patients and occupational therapists, directly seeking to work within a state-run institution. In both the classes at St Luke’s and at Mile End hospital, conversations would emerge over simple obstacles, such as the difficulty of opening ready rolled pastry packets with arthritic fingers, or how to carry a cup of tea on a walking frame. These dialogues were frequently difficult and troubling, though often eased by humour.\n\nA simple meal, or ingredient can carry a wealth of emotional and symbolic meaning for the duration of a life. Though many of the stories from the classes described individual experience, connections frequently emerged, bubbling away alongside the pots of stew or soup.\n\nWith thanks for the time and commitment from the following men who joined the cookery school: Babatunde Awonunsi, William Bunker, Chris Chainey, Stephen Coke, Anthony Copeland, Ivo Fantini, Kurban Haji, Horst Ingo Hay, Cyril Ismond, Valdemar Kalinin, Alf Marks, Edward McCairn, John Munday, Claude Penchina, Ron Savill, Alan Smithers, Graham Swift, Allan Tunbridge, Gordon Warrell\n\nChef: Paul Cawley trained as a chef at Ealing Technical College, and The Strand Palace Hotel. Over the next decade he worked across London, and as a private chef to a Duke and on a millionaire’s yacht. He then retrained as an actor at The Drama Studio, London. Since then his work has included appearances at The National Theatre, Chichester Festival Theatre, Minerva Theatre Chichester, Sheffield Crucible, The Rose Theatre, Gate Theatre, Lyric Theatre Hammersmith, BAC, Theatre 503, The Finborough, National Theatre Studio, Strand Theatre, Southwark Playhouse, and King’s Head Theatre. On screen, he was most recently seen playing Alan in both series of The Wrong Mans on BBC2, other recent credits include, Eastenders, Doctors, and Spooks, and he will be seen later this year in Partners in Crime on BBC1.\n\nPartners\n\nVital Arts is the arts organisation for Barts Health NHS Trust, charitably funded to deliver arts projects for the well-being of patients, staff and the wider hospital community. Over one million people attend the six hospitals within our trust each year, looked after by 15,000 members of staff. We see these important civic spaces as ideal places to introduce a new audience to contemporary art. Vital Arts was founded in 1996 and has grown into one of the UK’s leading arts and health organisations, with an international reputation for producing pioneering arts programmes that transform the experience of being in hospital for patients and staff. We commission artists, musicians and performers to help improve the hospital environment for patients. We manage two art galleries which ‘bring the outside in,’ and an extensive contemporary art collection. We forge links with the hospital community through our diverse programme of artists’ residencies, public art commissions and arts education projects. Recently commissioned artists include Peter Liversidge, Hurvin Anderson, Richard Slee, Roger Hiorns, Adeela Suleman, Ruth Claxton, Darren Almond, Richard Wentworth and Morag Myerscough.\n\nSt Luke's Community Centre is an old and well-established charity dating back centuries. We serve the community which lives in and around the former parish of St Luke's, Old Street. Nowadays, this comprises the London Borough of Islington's ward of Bunhill, and small pockets of Hackney and Clerkenwell, and the City of London. Often we work outside these ancient boundaries where we have secured external funding and the work fits in with everything else we do. We own a large community centre in a very deprived part of London. The building provides a space for local people to gather and socialise, and for us and other organisations to deliver services and activities to the local community. We also work outside in the community supporting other groups and running community events. Our charitable aim is to improve the conditions of life for the people living in the area of benefit. We believe that providing a community centre and services in the area will help break down barriers within the neighbourhood. We will contribute towards the area being welcoming, safe, healthy, alive with activity, and neighbourly.\n\nAge UK Islington was established in 1963 to promote the well-being of local older people. We aim to ensure that older people in Islington maintain their independence and are able to enjoy freedom of choice and equal opportunities. We provide free information and advice on a range of issues for over 55s, we help people to regain or maintain confidence to live safely and well at home, perhaps after a period of hospitalisation, and offer practical help with essential jobs around the house. Islington is one of the top ten most deprived boroughs in the country with older people suffering the greatest deprivation. The vast majority of our older residents live alone and often do not claim benefits despite requiring them. These causes of need can be compounded by dealing with the complexities of the welfare system, struggling with housing problems, literacy issues and social isolation. As with many inner city boroughs, Islington has large immigrant and refugee communities, many of whose older members require extra support when faced with difficulties in a country where they may never have planned to grow old. Following a period of hospitalisation or bereavement the more affluent older people in Islington may also need support coping and re-building their lives.\n\nFull credits for Mess Hall and Have Your Circumstances Changed?\n\nChef and Tutor: Paul Cawley\n\nCookery School Participants: Babatunde Awonunsi, William Bunker, Chris Chainey, Stephen Coke, Anthony Copeland, Ivo Fantini, Kurban Haji, Horst Ingo Hay, Cyril Ismond, Valdemar Kalinin, Alf Marks, Edward McCairn, John Munday, Claude Penchina, Ron Savill, Alan Smithers, Graham Swift, Allan Tunbridge, Gordon Warrell\n\nActors: Mitchell Jelley, Kareem Onyiukah, Luca Toomey, Paul Humpoletz, Dudley Sutton, Roddy Maude-Roxby, Kailuca Koniak, Khalil Vaughan, Guillermo Bedward, Luis Collyer\n\nCreative Team: Lu Kemp, Cis O'Boyle, Elena Peña, Ben Lewis, Jamie Vartan\n\nAssociate Director (understudies): Mercy Ojelade\n\nCookery school workshops: Mark Storor\n\nRehearsal stage management and production: Rachel Stringer\n\nPerformance stage management: Rachel Stringer, Benedict Hudson, Fana Cioban, Linda Peterkoba\n\nChaperones: Sophie Cathersides, Eleanor Dowling, Chloe Louis Marshall\n\nProduction manger: Rachel Shipp\n\nProps Sourcing: Rachel Stringer\n\nProps: Tim Spooner\n\nProps: Ben Irwin\n\nSound Technician and Installation: Federica Lippi\n\nProduction support: Lauren Philp and Louis Vincent\n\nCostume and set: Sarah June Mills\n\nDesign Assistant: Avra Alevropoulou\n\nBuild: Jim Cain, Denis Buckley, Nigel Edwards and Ben\n\nPhotography: Manuel Vason, Ludovic des Cognets\n\nFilm: Matan Rochlitz\n\nFront of House team\n\nJennifer Boyd\n\nMartha Crawford\n\nIsabel Ford\n\nJohn Petrie\n\nRosie Taylor\n\nThanks\n\nGratitude and admiration to all staff and volunteers at St Luke’s Community Centre, Katie Clark, Sofia Larrinua Craxton, Graham Reeves, Maria Agiomyrgiannaki.
