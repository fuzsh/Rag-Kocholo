        "text": "Double Feature withWithnail and I (6:30 PM)\n\nOne ticket gives admission to both films.\n\nHow to Get Ahead in Advertising is a satire on the advertising world written and directed by Bruce Robinson (Oscar-nominated writer of \"The Killing Fields\"). It was the follow-up to his cult hit directing debut, \"Withnail and I.\" Like \"Withnail,\" the film starred Richard E. Grant - in this outing with co-star Rachel Ward. The movie is a farce about a mentally unstable advertising executive who suffers a nervous breakdown while making an advert for pimple cream. The exec has a crisis of conscience about the ethics of advertising, which leads to mania. He then develops a boil on his right shoulder that comes to life with a face, voice and vengeance. Among the cast - iconic upper-class Brit Roddy Maude-Roxby (\"Rowan and Martin's Laugh In\") in one of his last movie roles and Sean Bean (\"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy) in one of his first.\n\nFormat: DVD"
