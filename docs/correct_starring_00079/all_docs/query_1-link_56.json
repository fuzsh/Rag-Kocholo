        "text": "Oliver & Company is another one of those Disney animation titles that I haven’t seen since I was a child and frankly I had very little desire to re-watch it again. Oliver is most definitely the worst adaption Dickens’ Oliver Twist. Twist isn’t exactly a replica of the story, but rather it is used as inspiration. We have Oliver, Dodger, Fagin, and Sykes (Sikes). The story is much more heartwarming and funny than the dark story we have seen retold so many times. Overall it is rather mediocre, aside from one or two fun songs and some funny moments placed here and there.\n\nActing: The acting is definitely the highlight of this film. Such great and distinct voices really bring the animated dogs to life. Billy Joel is great as Dodger, even getting to sing one of the most under rated Disney song of all time, “Why Should I Worry?” Bette Midler stood out to me, voicing what is probably the funniest character in the movie.\n\n9/10\n\nVisuals: I love the style of raw cell animation, it really lends itself to the 1980s grudge of underground New York. It is rather pleasing to my eyes.\n\n8/10\n\nStory: A meh adaption of the fabulous Dickens’ novel. The songs are fun, but too few and far between. Script is rather clever at times.\n\n5.75/10\n\nConcept: Not only adapting Twist into a children’s story, but using animals as the leads. Works ok I guess.\n\n4.5/10\n\nPersonal: Any longer than 74min, I would have had enough.\n\n5.5/10\n\nRe-Watchability: I have no want to buy this one.\n\n5/10\n\n6.3/10\n\nThe Aristocats has always been a great memory of my childhood. Every time I re-watch it with my siblings we reminisce about our favorite scenes and moments, always bursting into laughter when these points in the film take place. There is allot to like about this film, and it is respectfully entertaining, but but lacking in greatness and originality.\n\nI would basically call The Aristocats, One Hundred and One Dalmatians for cats. Cats are stolen, cats must journey home and defeat bad guy. Of course it takes a different, more comic and jazzy route than Dalmatians. But you still can’t scratch the feeling that you have seen this before.\n\nActing: I love, love, love the voices used in this film. it is probably my favorite part. Roddy Maude-Roxby voice as Edgar is timeless. His hoity-toity voice is absolutely perfect. “Hear Kitty-Kitty!” The rest of the cast is perfect. Absolutely no complaints.\n\n10/10\n\nVisuals: I am a pretty big fan of this raw style of cell animation, frankly I miss it. Though it isn’t quite as glamorous as some, it still holds its own. It reminds me of a coloring book.\n\n8/10\n\nStory: You read my complaints earlier about the story. It is still fun, but lacks in originality. The pacing of the film is great though. I am a pretty big fan of the songs, especially O’malley the alley cat and Everybody Wants to Be a Cat. Heck I even get a good laugh out of Scales and Arpeggios.\n\n7/10\n\nConcept: Not too original, but still fun.\n\n6/10\n\nPersonal: I really like The Aristocats, sure it isn’t my favorite, but I own it on BluRay and will come back to it every once in a while.\n\n7/10\n\nRe-Watchability: ^^^^^^^^\n\n7/10\n\n7.5/10\n\nNot since re-watching The Hunchback of Notre Dame have I been so pleased to be watching the Disney Animation Studios Canon. The Great Mouse Detective is not only a pleasant transition piece to the Disney Renaissance but it is a clever, splendidly paced homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. I recently started listening to the audiobooks of Sherlock and was pleasantly surprised to how many references they make to these timeless stories. I loved the inclusion of Toby, the detail in Basil’s home; his studies of footprints and cigarette and cigar ash.\n\nVisuals: The character animation is splendid throughout this film. Every character is given his or her little quirks that we soon familiarize ourselves with. I background detail was splendid, creating a fully realized tiny world of mice in London. Also that clock scene was truly a masterwork. I don’t know how they did, but damn, that was sure an impressive scene.\n\n9/10\n\nActing: Vincent Price as Ratigan is gold, Barrie Ingham plays an equally good crazy Basil of Bakerstreet. I loved all these character voices. Maybe I will watch it again soon to hear those lovely British accents.\n\n8.5/10\n\nStory: The story is splendidly paced, it will keep both the youngsters and adults cheery from start to finish. no scene drags, there is allot of laughs and some witty dialogue. The only downside is the inclusion of some not so good songs. One I really liked and I thought seemed to fit was the “Let Me Be Good to You”. How has this song been forgotten. It matched the bar scene perfectly.\n\n8/10\n\nConcept: Take a group of novels about the Sherlock Holmes in the mouse world, who lives in Sherlock’s house. What with the animals and the vibrant world of Sherlock, this makes for a perfect Disney film.\n\n9/10\n\nPersonal: I am becoming more and more introduced into the world of Sherlock and I am loving every minute of it. I would suggest you read the Holmes novels and stories before you watch this one again. it makes it so much better.\n\n8.5/10\n\nRe-Watchability: It’s out on BluRay. I know I will be picking it up soon. There is just so much fun to be had here, so many characters to love and become even more familiar with. Would love a sequel.\n\n8/10\n\n8.5/10\n\nI think Lilo & Stitch is the first movie on this Walt Disney Animation Studio Challenge that I originally saw in theaters. It weird for me to think that most of the Disney films I have seen were originally seen on VHS. Well, I guess it isn’t that weird. It is just strange because I see so many movies in theaters now that it just seems un natural not to go see a new Disney movie.\n\nVisuals: I bought this one on BluRay to see it in the most pristine quality possible. It is a a pretty movie, that uses a great combination of hand drawn and Computer generated images. It isn’t as spectacular as some Disney films, but the animation matches the tone of the story perfectly, giving us an abundance of bright images. The character animation is great, the human characters are given fun features and the aliens are very creative, no repeat alien shapes and guises.\n\n8/10\n\nActing: The Director of this film (Chris Sanders) is one talented guy. Not only did he Direct, but wrote and performed Stitch’s voice. That all so famous voice was played by the director! (Note: Director of the best DreamWorks film ‘How To Train Your Dragon.) Anyways, the talent is on spot, with the help of a wonderful screenplay that gives these voice actors some great comic opportunity.\n\n9/10\n\nStory: Lilo & Stitch is not only extremely creative in terms of plot and character, but the screenplay is rich with some of the most quick witted comedic moments I have ever seen in animated project. There is allot of heart in Stitch and you can really tell Chris Sanders and team put their souls in this one.\n\n9/10\n\nConcept: The evil genius creating hundreds of experiments, #626 being his masterpiece, his Opus of evil. This creation fleas to earth and seeks protection from a little girl who likes weird looking dogs. THAT’S GREAT! The themes of family and even the coming of age awareness are always relevant and nice.\n\n8.5/10\n\nPersonal: I do like this movie, but I probably like it more in terms of its technicality and great screenplay. I laugh allot, but many more have grown closer to my Disney heart. Though Lilo & Stitch still does have its place.\n\n7/10\n\nRe-Watchability: Lilo & Stitch is tremendously entertaining and very quotable. I could watch this one at least once a year. Though, I’ll watch others before this.\n\n7/10\n\n8.1/10"
