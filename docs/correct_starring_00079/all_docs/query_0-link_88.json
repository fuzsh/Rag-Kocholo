        "text": "Christmas\n\nAll posts tagged Christmas\n\nFrom kindergarten through 12th grade, I always looked forward to the last day of school before Christmas. Not only was the last day before the winter break a half-day, but it was always spent watching a holiday movie. The teacher always chose the movie the class watched, and they varied depending on the grade we were in. But holiday classics like “A Christmas Story” and 1951s “A Christmas Carol” were usually crowd favorites.\n\nIn fifth grade, however, our teacher chose poorly was. For some reason, Mrs. Nelson thought it would be a good idea for us to watch a movie called “Christmas Comes to Willow Creek.” I don’t think any of us had heard of the movie, but some of the boys got excited when they saw the film starred John Schneider and Tom Wopat from “The Dukes of Hazzard.” But as we quickly found out, Wopat and Schneider were not playing the Duke boys here. The BHS Mrs. Nelson brought wasn’t even from Blockbuster or another video store. I guess she taped it off the tv because every few minutes she had to stop and fast forward through the commercials.\n\nAnyway, “Christmas Comes to Willow Creek” takes place in a small town in Alaska called Willow Creek. Unfortunately, the hat is not having a good Christmas season this year. We learn that Willow Creek has been dealing with major problems ever since the main employer there, a cannery, closed its doors for good. The plant closing left many Willow Creek residents without jobs, including brother Ray (John Schneider) and Pete (Tom Wopat). Although they’re siblings and both work as truck drivers, the two are very different people and haven’t gotten along in quite some time.\n\nBetween trying to find work and paying his bills, Pete is also trying to figure out what to do with his rebellious teenage son Michael (Zachary Ansley). After his mother died, Michael is constantly at odds with his pop over everything. Part of Michael’s anger is due to Pete spending most os his time on the road trucking instead of at home. Meanwhile, Ray has become a recluse with problems of his own, including a pregnant wife, who years ago left Pete for Ray. Once this little nugget was revealed, the girl sitting next to me said: “And I thought my family had issues.” Around this time you could also hear some of the other kids in class getting impatient with the movie.\n\nAfter fast-forwarding the tape some more, we saw the Duke boys getting hired by an old friend, Al Bensinger (Hoyt Axton), to bring Christmas presents and a very big surprise from California up to his home town of Willow Creek. Things don’t go as planned since the brothers can’t get along. Also, for reasons, I can’t remember, young Michael tags along for the trip. The trio somehow gets stuck in a blizzard without food or water. At the same time, Ray’s wife goes into labor back home. But back at the truck, Michael kicks his dad while he’s down by telling him he often wishes Ray was his real father. And if you think this sounds like a country song, you may not be far off. As I recall, one of the Duke boys did some of the music for “Christmas at Willow Creek.” If it wasn’t John Schneider, it sounded like him.\n\nTo add even more cheesiness to the preceding, as Ray’s wife gives birth to their child, he and Pete finally reconcile with each other. They even arrive at their destination in time for Christmas and are greeted by a crowd of happy townspeople. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that earlier in the movie we found out that Ray can cook chili-like nobody else, and the big surprise is that Al has loaded the truck with enough supplies to reopen the cannery to manufacture chili. In the end, Ray and his wife decide to stay in town to raise their baby and run the cannery. Pete is also sticking around because Al has made him a partner in the company, which means no more long-distance trucking.\n\nWhen “Christmas Comes to Willow Creek” ended, the only ones paying attention were Mrs. Nelson and Mr. Pendergast (the other 5th-grade teacher). One kid was reading Sports Illustrated, the girls in front of me had her nose in a Nancy Drew mystery, and based on the snoring, someone in the back was asleep. I know I stopped paying close attention one Ray and Pete started arguing in the truck. I distinctly remember pulling out the latest issue of Amazing Spider-Man and trying to draw like Todd McFarlane. I occasionally looked up to see if Ray and Pete had killed each other yet, but sadly no luck there. “Christmas Comes to Willow Creek” appeared to be a huge miss with the class.\n\nI think Mrs. Nelson realized this because I saw her saying something to Mr. Pendergast. A few minutes later he was gone, and we were off to recess. After we came back into the classroom, Mrs. Nelson told us to sit down, we had another movie to watch. I guess Mr. Pendergast ran to the nearest video store and brought back “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.” Of course, that’s not a holiday movie at all, but everyone in the class was happy. Since this was a half-day, we weren’t able to finish watching the movie, but at least everyone went home happy.\n\nBut maybe I’m being unfair to “Christmas Comes to Willow Creek.” When I was in fifth grade I found this movie cheesy, unintentionally funny even. I thought the acting by Tom Wopat and John Schneider was wooden at best. However,r that was thirty years ago. Maybe if I saw the movie today I would feel differently about it. Then again, I think I would just have preferred if Mrs. Nelson had made us watch an episode of “The Dukes of Hazzard.”\n\nWith Christmas 2019 right around the corner, I started thinking again about the stuff I asked for as a kid but never got. I can’t tell you how many Christmas mornings I woke up and had that moment when I ripped open the wrapping paper om;y to discover clothes or something even more useless. To many times Santa and/or my family didn’t quite deliver what I wanted or asked them for. But I guess everyone had moments like regardless of whether you grew up in the 70s, 80s, or 90s.\n\nOnce I became an adult and made my own money, I started looking for some of the items (mostly toys) that never made it under my Christmas tree. I’ve been able to purchase some of them, but other items have been too expensive since I was a kid. I suppose I could buy one or two if I wanted to, but that might lead to the wifey hurting me and sleeping on the couch. So, for now, I’ll have to stick to merely dreaming about owning things like:\n\nElectronic Battleship\n\nIn theory, Battleship shouldn’t be an exciting game, yet I couldn’t get enough of it. It all started at my friend’s house when he got the basic Battleship game for his birthday. We played that thing every time we were together, even while riding in the car which wasn’t always easy. But once my biddy got the electronic Battleship for Christmas, I knew I wanted one of my own and asked for one the following year.\n\nDid I get one?\n\nNope, for some reason, my family bought me Operation instead. The choice still baffles me because I had never shown any interest in the game. Best I can figure, my family went to a toy store and saw a ton of Operation on display and maybe thought it was the hot game of the year. But it wasn’t what I wanted and I never used Operation for the simple fact it reminded me of what I didn’t get.\n\nBelieve it or not, I finally got an Electronic Battleship of my own… when I was 13. By that point, my tastes had changed and I wasn’t as thrilled to get it on my 13th birthday. In my teens, I wanted better gifts I guess. But I was curious about where my aunt got it and she said she saw it at a flea market. I kinda wish that flea market had been around several years earlier when I asked for Electronic Battleship in the first place!\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nNintendo Game Boy\n\nDeep down, I knew the chances of me getting a proper Nintendo system were slim. At the time I was living with my aunt and uncle and they were the Ebeneezer Scrooge of the neighborhood. To them, anything over $4.99 was overpriced. Despite this, every year I would ask not for the NES, but the much smaller (and cheaper) Nintendo Game Boy. I tried explaining to them how I didn’t have to hook it up to the television and I could take it everywhere with me. I even mentioned the Game Boy was a hot ticket, so I would be willing to settle for a Sega Game Gear.\n\nPer usual, all my pleas fell on deaf ears. I was told if I wanted something from Nintendo I would have to buy it myself, but Merry Christmas! The closest I ever got to a Nintendo Game Boy was the year my aunt and uncle gave me two handheld games: a Knight Rider racing game, and a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sewer game. My aunt put them both in one box and when I saw what was inside, part of me wanted to scream while the other part thought “They’re still making Knight Rider shit?”\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nM.A.S.K.’s Boulder Hill\n\nFunny story: I was never a big fan of the 1980s MA.S.K. cartoon. With flying cars and cool looking masks, it should have appealed to me, but I never got into it the way some of my friends did. I may not have loved the animated series, but the M.A.S.K. stuff I did enjoy was its toy line. One of my neighbors had all the toys, but the one that got my attention right away was the team’s secret Boulder Hill headquarters.\n\nFrom what I remember, Boulder Hill was a huge hit with kids my age in the mid ’80s. I remember going to one store with a huge display of M.A.S.K. toys and the headquarter playset was front a center. I don’t remember how much it cost, but it must have been pretty expensive because when I asked my grandmother for it, she looked at the price, and laughed. Needless to say, Boulder Hill never made an appearance under my Christmas tree.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nGatchaman God Phoenix Diecast\n\nOne of the earliest cartoons I remember watching was Gatchaman, or as it was known to stateside, Battle of the Planets. I was too little to realize I was watching a cut-up version of the Japanese original, but I doubt I would have care because I was too busy looking at the cool costumes and vehicles. The team bird costumes were unique, and their underwater headquarters was cool and all. But the truly awesome thing was that each Gatchaman team member have their vehicles, but they all formed part of the team jet called the Phoniex.\n\nI was so blown away with what I saw on my television that I probably would have been happy with any toys related to the Battle of the Planets. One of my cousins got me a couple of action figures one birthday (although I’m sure they were knock offs.) One Christmas I even got the racing car one of the characters drove in the tv show. But the one vehicle that eluded me my entire life was the Phoenix. I finally found a replica of the Phoenix at New England Comics in 200.2. It wasn’t the toy I remember as a kid, but hey, at least the Phoenix was still sitting on my desk at home.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nMattel Shogun Warriors Mazinga … Jumbo Machinder 1977 1978 Mazinger z\n\nThis one I can’t blame on my family. As I’ve mentioned before on this here blog, the one cartoon that changed me forever was Mazinger. Toys weren’t always easy to find, but one afternoon while walking around Chinatown in Boston, my family walked into a store that had bins filled with random toys. Among them was a Maziinger figure from the Shogun Warriors line. Or at least that’s what I think it was because everything on the box was written in what I assume was Japanese or Chinese since I was in a Chinatown store.\n\nAnyways, the one thing I recognized was a Mattel style logo on the corner of the box, but again, it was in another language so it could have said “Chuck” for all I know. But that didn’t matter to me, all I cared about was seeing a Mazinger toy. Sure the colors were off from what I remembered watching, but it was still Mazinger’s tone. I begged and begged my mom to buy it for me, but she told me no, we weren’t there for toys. O was sad, but I also knew Christmas was only a couple of months away and thus Mazinger toy was the first thing on my list.\n\nUnfortunately, when the holiday season finally rolled around, neither I nor my mother could remember which store I saw the toy in.\n\nPossible spoilers ahead!\n\n“Noelle” is a new Disney+ Christmas movie that’s available to stream now. The plot revolves around a young woman Noelle (Anna Kendrick) and her brother Nick (Bill Hader). The siblings live an amazing life in the North Pole with their father Santa (Bryan Brendle) and mother (Julie Hagerty), as well as their childhood nanny Elf Polly (Shirley MacLaine).\n\nBut after their father passes away, it falls to Nick to take up the mantle of being Santa Claus. Nick will become the 22nd Santa in the family and continue the tradition of delivering presents to kids around the world on Christmas Eve.\n\nHowever, as Christmas gets closer, Nick begins to crumble under the stress of being the new Santa. Concerned for her brother, Noelle suggests he take a weekend off to clear his head before the big night. Nick likes the idea, but when he doesn’t come back, Noelle – with an unwilling assist from Polly – takes it upon herself to save the day (and Christmas) by going to Phoenix Arizona to look for Nick.\n\n” Noelle” doesn’t break new ground when it comes to a holiday movie. The whole “fish out of water” tale has been done before in other Christmas movies like “Elf” and “The Santa Clause.” The difference here is Anna Kendrick in the role of Noelle. The Oscar nominee is perfectly cast as the daughter of Santa Claus. Anna Kendrick fully committed to the part, giving her a sunny personality even in the direst of circumstances. She handles the dramatic and comedic elements with grace, and even when she seems clueless about what’s going on, she’s still likable.\n\nTwo of my favorite Anna Kendrick moments in the film were when she meets a deaf girl and her mother at a shelter. Noelle can communicate with the girl by using sign language, and it was at this moment that I think Noelle realized Christmas is not just about children. The other moment is a little sillier. It comes when a psychiatrist is telling Noelle one of the patients thinks he’s Frosty the Snowman. Noelle replies with something like “Frosty is here?!” It’s a silly moment, but her joy at the mere mention of Frosty was priceless.\n\nAlso worthy of praise is Bill Hader and Shirley MacLaine as the anxious Nick and Noelle’s no-nonsense caretaker Polly. This might be the most normal role I’ve seen Hader in, but he’s great as a Santa who is about to have a nervous breakdown thanks to the pressure of the job. Having Nick relocate to Arizona as a yoga instructor allowed for some great interactions with Noelle. Meanwhile, MacLaine is playing herself, but her devotion and loyalty to Noelle were sweet and touching.\n\nI was also glad the filmmakers shied away from turning “Noelle” into a romantic comedy. There is a quasi-romantic angle between Noelle and Jake Hapman (Kingsley Ben-Adir), a private investigator and divorced father who helps her search for Nick. But there’s very little in terms of romance. They’re friends and come to care for each other, and Noelle becomes buddies with Jake’s son. But I don’t remember Noelle and Jake even hugging during the movie, so if you’re looking for romance go watch a Hallmark movie.\n\n“Noelle” doesn’t have a villain per se, but it does feature the Kringles’ geeky cousin Gabriel (Billy Eichner), who’s forced to serve as Santa in Nick’s absence. However, since his expertise is in technology, Gabriel tries to modernize the North Pole with algorithms and online delivery services. Gabriel even comes up with a program that determines there are under 3,000 “good” children in the world. The “bad” kids, all receive a text message explaining why they’re not getting any presents this year and how they can improve for next Christmas.\n\nIf I have any negative comments about “Noelle,” it would be that I wanted to see more of the people she meets in Phoenix. Noelle crash lands in a market and meets a couple of employees. But the two don’t play a huge role in the movie for some reason. Also, Julie Hagerty doesn’t get much to do as Noelle and Nick’s mom. Most of her scenes involve her trying to convince Gabriel that what he’s doing is wrong. My last complaint would be the long-running joke about everyone Noelle meets wanting an iPad. It was a funny joke at first, but it got old after a while.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, “Noelle” doesn’t break new ground when it comes to holiday films. A lot of what you see here has been done before in other Christmas movies. But what “Noelle” does well is tell the story of Anna Kendrick’s character discovering who she is and what her place in her family is supposed to be.\n\nIn the end, the film was entertaining and everyone I saw it with enjoyed it. “Noelle” has a great ensemble cast and its funny from start to finish. If nothing else, “Noelle” finally got me in the Christmas mood, and for that, I recommend checking it out on Disney+.\n\n“Noelle” score: B\n\nOne of the things that I love about movies is that they always remind me of something else. Maybe who I was with, what was going on that particular day, or something unique that happened when I saw a particular movie. I can’t tall you how many movies I can relate to something else, but it’ a lot. One of those movies is Disney’s “The Aristocats.”\n\nThe first time I saw “The Aristocats” was way back in the fourth grade. To be more specific, it was the week before Thanksgiving 1988. Our music teacher brought the movie for us to watch one day. We thought it was a special treat since this was around Thanksgiving, but alas, we were all wrong.\n\nAfter the movie was over, the music teacher informed us our class would be performing one of the songs from the movie during that year’s Christmas show. Upon hearing the news, everyone in class groaned their displeasure. But before we get to what happened next, here’s a recap of “The Aristocat”: The 1971 animated film was one of the last things Walt Disney greenlit before his passing or freezing.\n\nThe film tells the story of a cultured feline named Duchess (Eva Gabor), her three kittens, Toulouse (Gary Dubin), Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and an alley cat named Thomas O’Malley (Phil Harris). Duchess and her kittens enjoy a comfortable life of luxury in the posh estate of their owner Madame Adelaide’. Here Duchess teaches her little oned the importance of good manners, and of love and kindness for all creatures, even mice. In fact, one of their best friends at the estate is a small mouse which was kinda cool to me as a kid.\n\nEverything changes the day Madame Adelaide’s butler, Edgar, (Roddy Maude-Roxby) overhears his employer’s plan to will everything to her cats instead of him.\n\nNow Edgar’s only chance of inheriting her wealth is to get rid of them. Early one morning he takes them deep into the vast countryside and leaves them there.\n\nDuchess and the kittens escape, but find themselves far from home. From there, an alley cat Thomas O’Malley befriends Duchess and her kittens. He promises to do everything he can to get them home, and along the way, he enlists the help of many of his animal friends like a loyal mouse, a pair of dim-witted hound dogs, a horse, and more. But the highlight is easily the jazz band of alley cats O’Malley introduced Duchess and her kids to. And that’s the part that reminds me of something else.\n\nAnyways, back to the fourth grade…\n\nWhen our music teacher told us we had to sing in front of people, nobody in the class was thrilled. Our regular teacher, Mrs. Hackett tried telling us it would be fun and it better than what the other fourth-grade class had to do. I was more confused than anything. I didn’t understand why we had to sing something from “The Aristocats” during a Christmas show. Not that it mattered, because in the end all our pleas went nowhere, and the music teacher told us we had to sing “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat.”\n\nFor the next couple of weeks, music class was nothing but “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat.” I don’t know how many times we sang that song in total, but it had to be enough times that our hearts just didn’t seem to be into it. Three days before the show we were still not getting it right.\n\nOur music teacher wasn’t happy with us, so he brought the movie back to show us how happy the cat was when they sang the song. Part of me wanted to say “They’re happy because they were drawn that way.” But I held off, and I’m glad I did otherwise what happened next may not have happened.\n\nAs we watched the “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat” scene again, the music teacher started screaming “This is what I want!” One of the kids asked what he meant, and the teacher shouted back “Everything you see in the movie I want to see here!” The troublemaker in class, Dave, asked “You want us to do the same thing?’ And the teacher said “Yes! I want the same thing!” Dave grinned, and said “okay.”\n\nIf you’ve seen “The Aristocats” and in particular the “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat ” scene, then you know there’s a moment when some of the cats jump up on top of the piano and stomp their feet to the music. When our singing got to that point, troublemaker Dave stood up, climbed on top of his desk and started stomping tot he beat.\n\nDave was a big guy for his age, and his desk had probably been there since the Truman administration. It was a bad combination no matter how you put it and it ended with the desk legs giving way and Dave crashing down to the floor below, breaking his arm in the process.\n\nEveryone in the room was shocked. I saw it happen because Dave was next to me, but others only heard the crash. When it was clear Dave had hurt himself, an ambulance had to be called, even the police showed up to talk to the music and regular teacher. We didn’t see Dave again until after the holiday break.\n\nWe never found out if he got suspended or whether his mother threatened legal action against the school. Either way, the lucky bastard got to miss the Christmas show, including the part where the music teacher suggested we should all wear cat ears. Thank goodness there wasn’t enough time for him to get those.\n\nIt’s been over thirty years since all of that happened, but to this day whenever “The Aristocats” coms on tv or I see the DVD at a store, all I can think about is fourth-grade music class. “The Aristocats” is a good movie, one of my Disney guilty pleasures. But no movie can top that music teacher telling us we weren’t as good as cartoon cats, and Dave crashing down and breaking his arm.\n\nChristmas is almost here, which for me means a couple of things: One, I should probably start my Christmas shopping. But I have a tradition of waiting until the 24th to do all that. Second, it means at some point before Christmas day, I have to run to the nearest comic book store to buy a giant stack of comics to keep preoccupied while the family drives me nuts.\n\nAnd speaking of Christmas and comics, I’ve put together a short list of a few of my absolute favorite Christmas theme comic books. The reasons I like these issues varies, but these are comics I still try to read this time of year. Anyways, in no particular order, here’s my list:\n\nBatman #456\n\nWritten by: Alan Grant\n\nArt by: Norm Breyfogle\n\nBatman #456 from November, 1990, is not your typical comic book Christmas issue. The story doesn’t focus on the holiday, it just happens around Christmas. But maybe that’s one of the reasons I love this comic so much. The main reason though, is because of the art by the one and only Norm Breyfogle.\n\nIn “Identity Crisis, Part Two: Without Fear of Consequence…”, Vicky Vale has been captured by some thugs, one wearing a skull mask. Batman, out on patrol; decides to track Vicky down in the Batmobile. Meanwhile, Tim Drake believes he’s figured out who was behind the whim killings, but he can’t reach Batman who’s run into the Scarecrow.\n\nMy favorite parts of Batman #456 feature Batman trailing the bad guys in the stealth Batmobile, and Tim Drake dealing with his own demons in the Batcave. All of this works because Norm Breygohle sets the perfect mood with his art. As a kid, I spent countless hours trying to imitate his art from this issue. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Batman #456 is why Breyfogle is my all time favorite Batman artist.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nStarman #27\n\n“Christmas Night”\n\nWritten by: James Robinson\n\nArt by: Steve Yeowell and Wade Von Grawbadger\n\nIf you haven’t read Starman, shame on you, this series is a must read. But, if you only read one issue in the series, then Starman #27 should be it. The story by James Harrison is called “Christmas Night,” and the tale takes place on Christmas Eve. First we see the O’Dare family preparing for dinner along with the series’ extended cast. Then we see how Jack Knight helps a homeless mall Santa find his last memory of his family.\n\nThe story is rather simple fo Starman, but I think that’s one of the reasons I liked this issue in the first place.The book gives you a nice balance of sadness and hope. But by the time you get to the final page, you’re left with a happy feeling all around.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nSuperman #165\n\nWritten by Jeph Loeb\n\nArt by: Ed McGuinness, Cam Smith, Humberto Ramos, Wayne Faucher, Rob Leifeld, Norm Rapmund, Mike Weiringo, Art Adams, Ian Churchill, Joe Madureira, and Tom Townsend.\n\nSuperman #165 is a nice little comic in which Superman gives the member of the Justice League their Christmas. Supes is such a nice guy, than he gets presents he knows his fellow members will enjoy. Among the gifts are Rubber bands for Plastic Man, and Chocolates for the Martian Manhunter.\n\nJust the image of Superman giving the League presents cracks me up to this day. Superman #165 also features Superman interacting with other heroes, and it’s fun to see his optimism compared to the others. All in all, a nice little comic written by Jeph Loeb.\n\n————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nThe Incredible Hulk #378\n\nWritten by: Peter David\n\nArt by: Bill Jaaska\n\nThe story “Rhino Plastered,” came right when Peter David’s run on the Hulk hit its stride. But to many, this comic was probably nothing more filler, as it interrupted the ongoing arc.\n\nHowever, I loved reading an issue where Rick Jones entertains some hospitalized kids with a story about how teasing can lead to big trouble.\n\nRick tells the kids the story of the Rhino, who is alone for the holidays, and is depressed about his super-villain career. Rhino steals a Santa suit, puts it on top of his Rhino costume, so he can make a few bucks with a fake charity bucket. But things take a turn when he’s drafted into becoming a department store Santa.\n\nThing getting worse at sunset, because that’s when Bruce Banner changes into the grey version of the Hulk. And it just so happens that The Hulk arrived in time to catch a mouthy kid the Rhino had tossed across the room. Where the story goes from here, you need to find a copy of Incredible Hulk #378 to find out.\n\nEver since I was a little kid, Charles Dickens’ 1843 classic A Christmas Carol has been one of my go to movies every holiday season. But there are so many adaptations of A Christmas Carol out there, that its difficult to choose one as your favorite.\n\nHowever, there are a few versions of Dickens’ classic tale that I make sure to watch every year around this time. My list is in no particular order, and just because some adaptations didn’t make the list, it doesn’t mean I hate them or anything. The following are just the ones that hold a special place with me for one reason or another. Anyways, here are my go to adaptations of A Christmas Carol:\n\nScrooge (1970)\n\nThis 1970 musical starring Albert Finney often gets lost amongst all the other versions of Dickens’ story. But I like “Scrooge” because it’s so different from the others. Here we get to see Scrooge fall into his grave and end up in hell where Jacob Marley is happily waiting for him. We even get to see Scrooge at work, not just in the ofice, but out among the people he hates so much.\n\nThe special effects in “Scrooge” were a step up from anything that had been done before, and the music has some stand out performances. Meanwhile, Albert Finney’s performance is quirky enough that you can’t help but to grow to like him.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nA Christmas Carol (1999)\n\nThe reason this 1999 tv movie makes my list is simple: Patrick Stewart.\n\nDespite a stong cast and wonderful production value, the fact remains that without Patrick Stewart as Ebenezer Scrooge, this adaptation doesn’t work. But I also have to mention that Joel Grey as the Ghost of Christmas Past scares the living daylights out of me whenever I see him.\n\nI know the filmmakers were working on a television budget, but they could have used make up that was less terrifying.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nA Christmas Carol (1938)\n\nSomehow, the 1938’s “A Christmas Carol” starring Reginald Owen had escaped me until two years ago. During much of December 2015, I was sick with bronchitis, and during one sleepless night, this version aired on Turner Classic Movies.\n\nTo my absolute shock, I loved this movie. Sure, Reginald Owen only has one facial expression, and his laugh is sounds a little maniacal. But it’s everything else that’s going on in this movie that I truly enjoy. For instance, when Jacob Marley first appears, Scrooge calls the police and they come to his room to see what’s going on.\n\nAlso, the 1938 film gives Scrooge’s nephew Fred (Barry MacKay) a full role. This Fred doesn’t show up for three scenes, he’s in the movie from the start. Not only does he play with Tim and other kids, but we even get to see him at church with his fiancée. This is easily my favorite version of the character in any Christmas Carol adaptations.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nA Christmas Carol (1951)\n\nThe 1951 film is probably the best known adaptation of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. It’s the most dramatic of them all, and that’s all thanks to Alastair Sim’s wonderful performance as Ebenezer Scrooge.\n\nHe’s mean, scary, and his transformation is arguably the best in any of the films. After his redemption Scrooge sings, dances, and literally stands on his head. All the while terrifying his poor housekeeper. But at the end of the day, Alastair Sim is Scrooge as far as I’m concerned.\n\nThe supporting cast is just as strong, with Mervyn Johns as Bob Cratchit as a standout. However, I do wish some of the special effects in the movie were better. The Jacob Marley sequence it’s fine, but that’s really all the FX there are. It’s strange that the 1938 film would feature more special effects than the 1951 version. But that’s a minor complaint really because the rest of the movie is so damn good.\n\n—————————————————————————————————————————————–\n\nSo that’s my list. Those are the Christmas Carol movies I watch at least twice every December. While there are other adaptation I enjoy like the Mickey one, and “Ms. Scrooge,” these four are the ones I own and will always love the most.\n\nFor most people, Christmas means spending all day relaxing, eating, and having fun with your family. Not so much for the workers at Video To Go.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous VTG Files, one of our favorite after work traditions was to travel down to Rhode Island to play the slot machines at what was then called Lincoln Park. We went down there all the time, sometimes more than once a week which probably wasn’t the smart thing to do money wise. We liked going down there so much, we even did it on Christmas day.\n\nDecember 25th fell on a Thursday in 2003, and on that day I had a very important choice to make: go see “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” with Laneit and the rest of the TNU gang, or go gamble, possibly win lots of money, and ogle Ali at the casino.\n\nBy 2003. I had realized that the Lord of the Rings movies were not my cup pf tea, so of course I chose to go to the casino. Per usual, the crew on this trip were, my boss Krysty, her boyfriend Kris, Ali, and me. I won’t bore you with all the details, so I’ll just give you some of the night’s highlights:\n\nKrysty’s thinking had been “It’s Christmas, so the place will be empty, it’ll be fun.” Wrong! Lincoln Park was packed like we’d never seen before.\n\nI still say every nursing home and/or assisted living facility brought all their clients there that night, because the parking lot was full of buses from all over New England.\n\nThis was the last time someone asked me for my I.D.\n\nOne lady had on biggest fur coat I’ve ever seen. You could barely see her head sticking out.\n\nAli told me to focus dammit!\n\nKrysty and Kris vanished for a couple of hours. They were either doing the horizontal mambo somewhere, or they found a door to Narnia behind a slot machine.\n\nIt’s not a party until someone faints.\n\nOld people are touchy about slot machines.\n\nTwo guys got into a fight over either a woman or a slot machine. It was difficult to tell from all the yelling as they were escorted out by security.\n\nIHOP was closed.\n\nAs an 11-year-old boy, I fell hook, line, and sinker for the marketing blitz for 1989’s “Batman” film. At the time, I hadn’t read many Batman comics, and my comic collection was still in its early stages. But I knew Batman from the seventies and early eighties cartoons, and couldn’t wait for the movie.\n\nThe massive marketing wave for the movie and its tie-ins also struck a chord with me, and after my uncle took me to see Batman on opening weekend, I knew I needed to own all those wonderful toys! Unfortunately, “Batman” opened in June, which meant Christmas was a ways away, and my Birthday was even further away.\n\nI suppose I could have asked my uncle to stop at the Kay Bee (or KB) Toys store inside the South Shore Plaza on the way home, but he was a cheap bastard and I knew he wouldn’t get me anything.\n\nFor several months I waited patiently for Christmas to arrive, and when it was time to give my family my wish list, I made sure to write down all sorts of Batman goodies. I basically asked for anything Bat related, from comics, t-shirts, and of course, toys.\n\nChristmas ’89 landed on a Monday that year, and I was up before the sun was up so I could dive into the gifts under the tree. That day I received clothes, books, and a Apollo 11 1,000 piece puzzle which I thought was kind of odd. Anyways, I finally found a present that felt like an action figure, so I tore the paper and found… Bob the Goon.\n\nThe only Batman related gift I got that year was Bob the Goon. That moment still haunts me to this day. At the time two things popped into my head:\n\n1. What the !?#?$?$^?!\n\n2. Seriously, who gave the go ahead on a Bob the Goon action figure?\n\nIt’s not that I had anything personal against actor Tracey Walter, but even back then I knew he was only in the Batman movie because he was good friends with Jack Nicholson. The main reason I hated the Bob the Goon toy was because what could you possible do with him?\n\nWith a Batman action figure I could have had countless adventures. Add in a vehicle or tow, and those adventures would have doubled in size. But with Bob, there really wasn’t much to do. In fact, I don’t know that I ever played with the action figure at all.\n\nAnywho, I found out days later from my mother that they had gone to a few stores and all the good Batman toys were sold out. I believe her, and my family more than made up for it on my next birthday when I got Batman, the Joker, the Batmobile, and the Batwing. As for Bob, I have no idea what happened to him, but I recently found his hat.\n\nThis is the most wonderful time of the year, and every year it seems to come earlier and earlier. But that’s another story for another time.\n\nThis story, is about a one of my all time favorite Christmas films.\n\nEvery December I take out my favorite holiday movies so I can watch them over and over. I got everything from the classics “White Christmas,” it’s a Wonderful Life,” to more recent favorites like “Elf” and “Love Actually.”\n\nThere are also the not so traditional Christmas movies like the original “Die Hard” and Tim Burton’s “Batman Returns.” Another not so traditional favorite of mine is the 1983 comedy. “Trading Places.”\n\nWay back when I was a wee little nerd growing up in the Boston area, I discovered “Trading Places” one December on WSBK TV 38. Back then, the local channel had aired a variety of movies hosted by Dana Hersey. And one year, “Trading Places” made the holiday playlist.\n\nI loved everything about “Trading Places”: The cast, the poor guy vs. the rich jerks, Dan Aykroyd, Eddie Murphy, and the Activia lady in their prime, it was all great. After seeing the movie just once, I had a new holiday favorite.\n\nAnd because these were the dark days before dvds, my only chance to watch the movie was during the Christmas season. I think I tried renting the movie one time at Blockbuster, but because it was rated R, I ended up with a kids movie.\n\nAnyways, several years later I finally bought the dvd, and I was shocked because there was one important scene cut from the film. When the movie aired on WSBK, there was a scene in which Clarence Beeks steals the USDA report on orange crop forecasts.\n\nI remember the scene because Beeks sits down with a security guard and they talk about the 1950 film “Sunset Boulevard.” Beeks then knocks out the poor old security guard, and steals the crop report.\n\nI know I didn’t dream this scene up, but it’s not any dvd copy that I know of, and its never shown on television either. Meanwhile, my wifey think I made up the whole thing, but I know there was a missing scene."
