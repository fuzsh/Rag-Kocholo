They stick together despite several disagreements and eventually find that the 'story' of their travels has been made a part of the advertising campaign that they had been so keen to escape from in the first place.

To his horror, Galaxian finds that the only ambassador available for the task is Wilco Roger, a rather unorthodox character who sports a disgraceful record of incompetence.\n\nNevertheless, Wilco must achieve complete success in this duty or, by way of punishment, spend the rest of his days in exile on the dreaded planet Gonk!Wilco ponders his fate and accepts the challenge along with a ban on the use of his supernatural powers (he can appear and exit in a puff of smoke), except in the case of extreme emergency.\n\nArriving on Earth, Wilco soon realises the causes of unrest in the form of an all-out war between the two communities of Beatland and Balladisle, with music at the root of their mutual dislike. Some play ballads, others play beat, but both sides insist that their music is tops! >>>"
