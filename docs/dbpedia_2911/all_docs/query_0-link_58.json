        "text": "Meggitt has announced plans to expand its carbon brake manufacturing facility in Kentucky, marking a significant increase of both capability and capacity.\n\nThe company is investing for growth around the world to meet increasing demand for its products and services. The expansion will see the facility increase in size by 95,000ft² and is part of a broader expansion plan for the facility.\n\nThe factory already provides braking components for a number of customer programmes, including the Airbus A220 and A321, as well as for Gulfstream, Dassault and Bombardier. The facility will also serve as an MRO hub to meet rising demand for aircraft maintenance and repair.\n\nMeggitt’s president of braking systems, Brian Bondarenko said: “Today’s announcement of plans for the expansion of our Danville, KY facility is yet another important milestone in our broader investment programme around the world. This investment reflects the increasing demand for our highly innovative and competitive products and services and we are proud of the trust our customers continue to place in Meggitt.”"
