        "text": "Meggitt is an international company with headquarters in the UK, although more than half its employees are in the US. The company produces a variety of subsystems for military and civil aircraft, military vehicles, naval vessels, and for the power generation and oil and gas industries. Their military products include ammunition handling, thermal systems, power units, weapons scoring systems, and numerous others.\n\nAccording to the company’s 2021 Annual Report, 42% of Meggitt’s 2021 revenue was for military business, around £625 million. It goes on, “We have equipment on an installed base of around 22,000 fixed wing and rotary aircraft and a significant number of ground vehicles.”\n\nMeggitt’s role in the production of Israel’s Apache attack helicopters was revealed by the Guardian in 2006. Several key Apache components were identified as being produced in the UK, including the air data system – manufactured by Meggitt.
