        "text": "Reciprocating Power Generating Engine Market Overview\n\nThe new report published by The Business Research Company, titled \"Reciprocating Power Generating Engine Global Market Report 2024 - Market Size, Trends, And Global Forecast 2024-2033\", delivers an in-depth analysis of the leading size and forecasts, investment opportunities, winning strategies, market drivers and trends, competitive landscape, and evolving market trends.\n\nAs per the report, the reciprocating power generating engine market size has grown steadily in recent years. It will grow from $52.81 billion in 2023 to $53.87 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.0%. The reciprocating power generating engine market size is expected to see marginal growth in the next few years. It will grow to $57.28 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.5%.\n\nDownload Free Sample Report @ https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=5808&type=smp\n\nRising Electricity Demand Fuels Growth Of Reciprocating Power Generating Engine Market\n\nThe increase in electricity demand across commercial and industrial sectors is significantly contributing to the growth of the reciprocating power generating engine market. Electricity is the power that is used in the commercial and industrial sectors for lighting in manufacturing and other industries. The increase in the usage of electricity due to the increase in the expansion of cogeneration plants, private consumption, as well as a rise in small industries, is the major driving force for the growth of this market. For instance, according the U.S. Energy Information Administration's report published in 2022, a US-based federal agency for energy, each of the energy-consuming sectors used more energy in 2021, with the transportation sector witnessing the biggest annual rise in energy consumption at approximately 10.2%, making up about 97 quads of the total U.S. energy consumption, an increase of roughly 4.7% from 2020. Therefore, the increase in electricity demand across commercial and industrial sectors is expected to create opportunities for various players involved in the reciprocating power-generating engines market.\n\nStrategic Collaboration Drives Evolution Of Reciprocating Engines In The Energy Sector\n\nStrategic collaboration between companies is a key trend gaining popularity in the reciprocating power generation engine market. Companies manufacturing reciprocating power generating engines are undergoing various collaborations to develop new technologies and products. For instance, In January 2022, WEC Energy Group, a US-based publicly traded electric and natural gas utility holding company, and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), an independent, non-profit organization based in the United States, will conduct research and development related to electricity generation, distribution, and utilization. They partnered to announce the completion of a hydrogen blending pilot project at a reciprocating engine. The partnership allows strategic growth for both companies along with the installation of a new range of generator products. This development demonstrates the evolving nature of reciprocating engines and their role in the energy sector.\n\nThe reciprocating power generating engine market covered in this report is segmented -\n\n1) By Fuel: Gas-fired, Diesel-fired, Duel fuel, Other Fuel\n\n2) By Rated Power: Below 2MW, 2MW-5MW, Above 5MW\n\n3) By Application: Industrial, CHP, Energy and Utility, Landfill and Biogas, Other Applications\n\nBuy Now & Get Exclusive Discount on this Report, Checkout link @\n\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/Discount?id=5808&type=discount\n\nMajor companies operating in the reciprocating power generating engine market include Rolls-Royce Limited, Mitsubishi Motors North America Inc., MAN Energy Solutions SE, Kohler Co., Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Deere & Company., hinduja automotive limited, Briggs & Stratton Corporation, Caterpillar Inc., Cummins Inc., Deutz AG, Escorts Kubota Limited., Siemens Energy AG, Wärtsilä Oyj Abp, Yanmar Co.
