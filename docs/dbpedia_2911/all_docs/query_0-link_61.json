        "text": "Parker Hannifin Corp. is expanding its global aerospace and defense motion and control reach with an all-cash acquisition of Meggitt a UK-based manufacturer. The deal will nearly double Parker’s aerospace business.\n\nMeggitt, headquartered in Coventry, the UK, had annual revenue of approximately $2.3 billion in 2020 and employs more than 9,000 team members serving customers around the world. Meggitt has diverse aerospace and defense exposure with technology and products on almost every major aircraft platform, but does not specialize in fluid power technologies.\n\nParker has been fairly quiet on the acquisitions front for the past two years, with one of its last buys that of Exotic Metals Forming Company LLC for $1.725 billion in cash. Exotic was a manufacturer of innovative and technically demanding, high-temperature, high-pressure air and exhaust management solutions for aircraft and engines.\n\nThe announcement has been issued jointly by Parker and Meggitt plc through the UK’s Regulatory News Service (RNS) under Rule 2.7 of the UK Takeover Code. The Acquisition remains subject to satisfaction of the conditions set out in the announcement, including regulatory clearances and approval by Meggitt’s shareholders.\n\n“The combination of Parker and Meggitt is an exciting opportunity for both companies’ team members, customers, shareholders and communities,” said Tom Williams, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We strongly believe Parker is the right home for Meggitt. Together, we can better serve our customers through innovation, accelerated R&D and a complementary portfolio of aerospace and defense technologies.\n\n“We are committed to being a responsible steward of Meggitt and are pleased our acquisition has the full support of Meggitt’s Board. We fully understand these responsibilities and are making a number of strong commitments that reflect them. During our longstanding presence in the UK we have built great respect for Meggitt, its heritage, and its place in British industry. Our own journey over more than 100 years has taught us the importance of a strong culture and reputation.”\n\nParker Hannifin\n\nwww.parker.com\n\nFiled Under: News"
