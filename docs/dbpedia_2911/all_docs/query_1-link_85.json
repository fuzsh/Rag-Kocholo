        "text": "CLEVELAND, Sept. 7, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG) announced today that after careful consideration, it does not intend to make a firm offer for Meggitt PLC.\n\nTransDigm Chairman W. Nicholas Howley stated, \"We have long admired and studied the Meggitt business and believed that a combination between the two companies could provide value to investors of both companies. However, based on the quite limited due diligence information that was made available and the resulting uncertainties, TransDigm could not conclude that an offer of 900 pence per Meggitt share would meet our long-standing goals for value creation and investor returns. TransDigm and our advisers put substantial time, effort, resources and expense into evaluating a potential transaction. We reached a memorandum of understanding with the Meggitt Pension Plan trustees, arranged the necessary financing for the acquisition which we anticipated would position us roughly in the range of leverage levels that we have used historically for larger acquisitions, and communicated our willingness to make commitments to HM Government comparable to those offered by the other bidder for Meggitt. However, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we make acquisitions only when we see a clear path to achieving our investment return goals with a reasonable degree of certainty.\"\n\nUnder Note 2 on Rule 2.8 of the Code, TransDigm (and any person acting in concert with it) reserves the right to set aside the restrictions in Rule 2.8 of the Code in the following circumstances: (i) with the agreement of the board of directors of Meggitt if such agreement is given after the offer announced by Parker-Hannifin Corporation is withdrawn or lapses; (ii) if a third party announces a firm intention to make an offer for Meggitt; (iii) if Meggitt announces a \"whitewash\" proposal (as described in Note 1 of the Notes on Dispensations from Rule 9 of the Code) or a reverse takeover (as defined in the Code); or (iv) if there is a material change of circumstances (as determined by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers).\n\nA copy of this announcement will be available on TransDigm's website at www.transdigm.com.\n\nAbout TransDigm Group\n\nTransDigm Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, is a leading global designer, producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today.
