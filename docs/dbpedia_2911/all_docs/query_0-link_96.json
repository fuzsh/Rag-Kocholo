        "text": "TT Electronics, a global leader in manufacturing solutions and engineered technologies, has announced that its Cleveland, Ohio facility has signed a significant new contract with Parker Meggitt.\n\nThis multi-million pound agreement focuses on the production of complex electronic assemblies for commercial aircraft braking systems through 2027, further cementing the long-standing collaboration between TT Electronics and Parker Meggitt.\n\nFormerly known as Meggitt plc and acquired by the Parker-Hannifin Corporation in September 2022, Parker Meggitt’s technology and products are integral to many major aircraft platforms.\n\n“This award from Parker Meggitt – a valued customer for many years – underscores the exceptional capabilities and the best-in-class experience delivered by our Cleveland team,” said Michael Leahan, Executive Vice President Commercial at TT Electronics.\n\n“It also reflects the rising demand and growth opportunities within the commercial aerospace sector and the ongoing renewal of global aircraft fleets. TT is well positioned to leverage these trends and continue to support our customers’ evolving needs.”\n\nTT Electronics has been delivering comprehensive manufacturing and agile supply chain solutions to Parker Meggitt for more than a decade.\n\nThis latest contract award not only reinforces the strategic partnership between the two companies but also highlights Parker Meggitt’s trust in TT’s proven expertise in challenging aerospace and defence applications.\n\n“This partnership extension is a testament to the value and professionalism that TT Electronics consistently delivers,” said Jennifer Osbaldestin, General Manager at Braking Systems Division at Parker Meggitt.\n\n“Their advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep understanding of our requirements have been pivotal in achieving our programme goals. We look forward to continuing this successful collaboration as we advance our technologies and enhance the safety and efficiency of commercial aircraft braking systems.”\n\nThis award is the most recent in a series of significant contract signings for TT Electronics across the UK and North America, driven by increasing demand for global aerospace and defence platform production.\n\nRecent awards include the RBSL Challenger 3 Award for cable assembly at TT’s Abercynon site and a multi-year contract with Marotta Controls at the Cleveland, Ohio facility."
