        "text": "Today, Boom announced the successful flight of XB-1, the world's first independently developed supersonic jet, at the Mojave Air & Space Port in Mojave, California. Flown by Chief Test Pilot Bill \"Doc\" Shoemaker, XB-1's inaugural flight marks a major milestone toward the return of supersonic travel onboard Overture - Boom's supersonic airliner. The XB-1 program provides the foundation for the design and development of Overture, while establishing a safety-first culture in engineering and manufacturing. \"Today, XB-1 took flight in the same hallowed airspace where the Bell X-1 first broke the sound barrier in 1947.\" said Blake Scholl, founder and CEO of Boom Supersonic. \"I've been looking forward to this flight since founding Boom in 2014, and it marks the most significant milestone yet on our path to bring supersonic travel to passengers worldwide.\" Read more on XB-1's milestone first flight here: https://lnkd.in/e2anXhRD"
