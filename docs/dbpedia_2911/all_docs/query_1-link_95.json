        "text": "Meggitt has announced two deals with an aggregated value of $85 million with Lockheed Martin and the Defense Logistics Agency in the United States.\n\nMeggitt has signed a three-year agreement with Lockheed Martin for the supply of rudder pedal assemblies on the F35. The contract has a value of around $65 million. Meggitt has a longstanding relationship with Lockheed Martin and this award increases the Company’s content and scope of supply on the F35 aircraft.\n\nThe contracts with the Defense Logistics Agency, which equate to approximately $20 million, are to supply Super Hornet F/A – 18 E/F/G fuel bladders, to support the US Navy Fleet. Meggitt will provide long-life, lightweight fuel bladders for the Super Hornet.\n\nSpeaking about the two defence deals, President of Meggitt’s Airframe Systems division, Chris Allen, said: “We are delighted to be partnering with Lockheed Martin on the F35 platform. We value our long-standing relationship with Lockheed, and are pleased to have been given this opportunity to add to our existing content on the F35.\n\n“Meggitt has become synonymous with flexible fuel bladder technology and we look forward to working closely with the Defense Logistics Agency on the F18E/F Super Hornet. We are proud that Meggitt innovation continues to win the trust and confidence of our customers.”\n\nIf you would like to join our community and read more articles like this then please click here."
