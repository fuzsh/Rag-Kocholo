        "text": "Parker-Hannifin Corp., the U.S. maker of industrial motion-control systems, agreed to buy Meggitt Plc for 6.3 billion pounds ($8.8 billion) in cash to strengthen its hand in a rebounding aerospace industry.\n\nShares of Meggitt surged the most on record after the 170-year-old company said its board would recommend the offer at 800 pence per share, 71% above Fridayâ€™s closing price. The massive premium will make it harder for a rival to jump in and snatch the Coventry, England-based target, after a string of U.S. buyouts of British aerospace and defense firms."
