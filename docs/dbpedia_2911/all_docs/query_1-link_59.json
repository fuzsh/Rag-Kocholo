        "text": "TransDigm Group Inc. joined in the bidding for Meggitt Plc, making a surprise counter-offer well above an earlier proposal intended to discourage challengers for the U.K. manufacturer of airplane components.\n\nShares of Meggitt, a Coventry, England-based aerospace and defense supplier, surged to a record Wednesday on the preliminary, non-binding offer of 900 pence a share. The approach is about 13% higher than the 6.3 billion-pound ($8.7 billion) offer from TransDigm’s Cleveland rival, Parker-Hannifin Corp., that Meggitt’s board said earlier this month it planned to recommend."
