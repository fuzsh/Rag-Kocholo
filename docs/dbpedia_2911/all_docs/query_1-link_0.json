        "text": "The UK government has said it is \"closely monitoring\" the planned £6.3bn takeover of defence and aerospace firm Meggitt by a US company.\n\nThe statement by the Department for Business comes after Parker-Hannifin announced its 800p-a-share offer for Coventry-based Meggitt.\n\nMeggitt employs 9,000 people worldwide, including 2,300 in the UK.\n\nThe government said it had powers to intervene in mergers and takeovers that raised national security concerns.\n\nHowever, officials stressed that no decisions to intervene had been taken at this stage.\n\nA government spokesperson said: \"Under the Enterprise Act 2002, the Business Secretary has powers to intervene in mergers and takeovers which raise national security concerns.\n\n\"While commercial transactions remain primarily a matter for the parties involved, the government is closely monitoring the proposed acquisition of Meggitt by Parker-Hannifin.\"\n\nIt comes six days after the government said it was monitoring the proposed takeover of another UK defence firm, Ultra Electronics, by a US private equity-owned company, Cobham.\n\nUltra, a major supplier to the Royal Navy, has said it is \"minded to recommend\" the £2.6bn bid, subject to other terms, including assurances over national security.\n\nMeggitt specialises in components for the aerospace, defence and energy industries. Companies that it supplies include Airbus and BAE Systems. It also has contracts with the Ministry of Defence, which Parker has pledged to honour.\n\nParker said it was \"committed to being a responsible steward\" of Meggitt.\n\nIt also said it would maintain Meggitt's product engineering and manufacturing staff levels in the UK, while increasing the number of apprenticeships by 10%.\n\nResearch spending\n\nThe offer for Meggitt, which is listed on the FTSE 250 index, represents a 70% premium on Meggitt's closing share price on Friday, which was 469.1p.\n\nThe takeover announcement sent its share price soaring more than 55% in Monday trading to 733.8p.\n\n\"During our long-standing presence in the UK we have built great respect for Meggitt, its heritage, and its place in British industry,\" said Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Parker-Hannifin.\n\nParker, which already employs 2,000 people at its own UK sites, has said it is committed to keeping Meggitt's headquarters in Coventry.\n\nIt will also ensure that the majority of the board are UK nationals and increase research and development spending in the UK by 20% over the next five years.\n\nSir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Meggitt, said: \"Meggitt is one of the world's foremost aerospace, defence and energy businesses, leading the market with a strong portfolio of technology and manufacturing capabilities, and holding a significant amount of intellectual property."
