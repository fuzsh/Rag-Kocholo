        "text": "Meggitt Training Systems produces integrated virtual and live fire weapons training systems for the defence market\n\nTo date, the firm has fielded more than 5,100 virtual simulation systems, 40,000 laser-based weapon simulators (with 400+ weapon variations), 13,000 live fire ranges, and is deployed in more than 130 countries.\n\nSolutions providing realistic training for the armed forces\n\nMeggitt Training Systems provides solutions that offer realistic training for judgmental, marksmanship, crew and collective missions, as well as engagement skills, mission rehearsal, gunnery, convoy and armored vehicles, for armed forces, law enforcement and security organisations around the world.\n\nThe firm’s products have set the standard for simulation training and include the flexible FATS® M100 open architecture, providing intelligent integration of new simulation training advancements.\n\nThe FATS® M100 integrates with a wide variety of image generation sub-systems, allowing customers to specify a service wide preference and leverage previous investment.\n\nThis provides the use of common terrain databases, driving significant cost savings as they can be shared across multiple system platforms, including small arms trainers.\n\nThe inclusion of enhanced visual game engines, immersive 3D graphics, and Meggitt’s patented wireless BlueFire® weapon simulators allow for realistic training.\n\nWireless weapons for high-throughput training\n\nUsing a combined weapon and virtual simulation strategy, soldiers can train on small arms up to crew-served weaponry.\n\nMeggitt’s innovative BlueFire technology combines the largest inventory of weapon simulators in the world with the most ballistically accurate wireless smart weapon simulators in the industry.\n\nFully-sensored, convertible BlueFire weapon simulators provide the same accurate, real-time training diagnostics as tethered weapon simulators, featuring two-way, weapon-to-system communication and continual laser operation that only records when the trigger is pulled.\n\nThe operator controls the round management via smart software, allowing real-time sensor feedback for viewing weapon status.\n\nMeggitt’s BlueFire wireless weapons meet the form, fit, function and accurate ballistics of live weapons without the full burden of maintenance and ammunition costs.\n\nBlueFire weapons provide cost-effective solutions for high-throughput training, and tetherless mobility for a broader range of motion.\n\nNot only is there a benefit from cost savings, but multiple studies have shown the value of marksmanship and full immersion training where personnel experience the same stress realised in theatre, all within a simulated training environment.\n\nWireless tablet control, after action review, and automatic coaching for real-time student feedback\n\nFurther enhancing the training, Meggitt’s wireless tablet control lets instructors control the training scenarios, providing student feedback in real-time. The tablet delivers immediate after-action review (AAR), allowing engagement and shot assessment in a 3D virtual environment delivering detailed trainee diagnostics for skill reinforcement and/or correction.\n\nThe detailed shot analysis, automatic assessment and coaching capabilities pulled from doctrine are instantaneously available on an individual tablet for trainee reference. This ‘automatic coaching’, founded upon collaboration with customer subject matter experts, coaches and trainers, brings consistent and instant training, based upon hard-learned combat experience.\n\nMilitary simulation training for allied forces\n\nMeggitt’s FATS® systems have been the longstanding training systems of record for the US Army, UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), US Marines (USMC), US National Guard, and the US Air Force (USAF), as well as the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force, Australia Defence Forces (ADF), Italian Army, Singapore Army, and Singapore Police Coast Guard.\n\nMost of these are long-term relationships that have existed for more than 20 years with continuous engagement, resulting in multiple upgrades and training enhancements delivered to meet their evolving training requirements.\n\nMeggitt recently secured the US Army’s Engagement Skills Trainer (EST II) and the US Marine Corps Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainers (ISMT) contracts, solidifying Meggitt as the global leader of advanced simulation systems.\n\nThe company continuously looks beyond today’s defence requirements and researches improvements upon existing solutions with evolving technology.\n\nThe EST II and ISMT systems will provide the most innovative virtual training systems developed to date, supporting joint training and providing combat readiness solutions for today and into the future.\n\nMeggitt Training Systems employs nearly 400 people at its headquarters in Atlanta, US, and at facilities in Orlando, Canada, Netherlands, the UAE, Australia and Singapore.\n\nWith facilities worldwide, Meggitt Training Systems provides live, 24/7 customer support and sales assistance to US and allied forces"
