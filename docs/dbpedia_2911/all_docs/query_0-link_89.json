        "text": "DANVILLE, Ky., Oct. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems (MABS), a division of the UK-based Meggitt group, today celebrated significant growth in its operations with a ribbon cutting ceremony and facility tour attended by Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin and other dignitaries. The event was held to dedicate a 66-job, $9.3-million expansion of its Danville manufacturing and distribution campus.\n\n\"For the past decade, Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems grew as a substantial employer and a major player in Boyle County's economy. This project represents the company's second expansion and an ongoing commitment to central Kentucky,\" Gov. Bevin said. \"The expansion we dedicate today also exemplifies the Commonwealth's increasing role in the global aerospace industry. Corporate partners like MABS recognize Kentucky offers an ideal location and workforce for aviation and aerospace manufacturing. I look forward to seeing MABS continue to grow in the years ahead.\"\n\nDuring the two-part project, MABS relocated and integrated its wheel-and-brake maintenance and repair operations facility from Akron, Ohio, to Danville. The company also expanded its carbon brake manufacturing capacity with three new production furnaces and related support machines. The expansion will help MABS meet current and future demand from new clients, including providing components for the Canadian Bombardier C-Series aircraft and Gulfstream 650 business jet.\n\n\"The MABS Danville campus has available land to accommodate growth in creating a single, global production and distribution center with significant economies of scale. Future plans call for additional building expansions in 2018-20, with additional carbon furnaces and support equipment, at an anticipated investment of $100 million,\" said MABS President Luke Durudogan.\n\nMABS provides sophisticated aircraft braking systems to a wide range of customers worldwide including airline operators, aircraft constructors, private aircraft owners, charter operators, government and military operations as well as distributors and repair stations.\n\nThrough the interplay of structural design, thermal management and materials technology, MABS addresses the extreme environment of brake control – one of the most safety-critical assemblies on an aircraft – including prowess in advanced friction materials for its long-life, high-power, lightweight heat sinks for brake discs, as an example. Moreover, despite the millions of foot pounds of kinetic energy brakes absorb and the control dynamics required for an emergency, passengers appreciate systems that perform under normal circumstances with braking so smooth they hardly know they have landed.\n\nMABS initially located its carbon brake manufacturing facility in Danville in 2005. In 2011, it added an assembly and distribution operation, bringing its total Kentucky investment to approximately $70 million. MABS currently employs some 185 people in Danville.\n\nFor information on Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems, visit www.meggitt-mabs.com.\n\nPHOTO DOWNLOAD 1: http://www.kcomm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Meggitt-Aircraft-Braking-Systems1.jpg\n\nCaption 1: Ribbon cutting for the Meggitt Aircraft Braking Systems expansion was accomplished by (l. to r.)
