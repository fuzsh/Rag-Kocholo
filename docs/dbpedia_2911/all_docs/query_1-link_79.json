        "text": "Information on Parker\n\nComments on the Acquisition\n\nThe combination of Parker and Meggitt is an exciting opportunity for both companies team members, customers, shareholders and communities. We strongly believe Parker is the right home for Meggitt. Together, we can better serve our customers through innovation, accelerated R&D and a complementary portfolio of aerospace and defense technologies.\n\nWe are committed to being a responsible steward of Meggitt and are pleased our acquisition has the full support of Meggitts Board. We fully understand these responsibilities and are making a number of strong commitments that reflect them. During our longstanding presence in the UK we have built great respect for Meggitt, its heritage, and its place in British industry. Our own journey over more than 100 years has taught us the importance of a strong culture and reputation.\n\nMeggitt is one of the worlds foremost aerospace, defence and energy businesses, leading the market with a strong portfolio of technology and manufacturing capabilities, and holding a significant amount of intellectual property. Whilst Meggitt is currently pursuing a strong, standalone strategy which will deliver value to shareholders over the long-term, Parkers offer provides the opportunity to significantly accelerate and de-risk those plans, while continuing to deliver for shareholders. Parkers offer also includes far-reaching commitments that will ensure that Meggitt remains a significant presence in the UK, increasing investment in research and development, and increasing the number of apprenticeship opportunities. The Board of Meggitt is confident that Parker will be a responsible steward of Meggitt and unanimously recommends Parkers offer.\n\n\n\nTony Wood, Chief Executive of Meggitt, said:\n\nBringing together the Meggitt and Parker businesses will provide increased benefit to the UK with the provision of technologies, products and capabilities through Meggitt, and a leading aerospace business in Parker. The offer from Parker is an endorsement of the work undertaken to transform the Meggitt Group in recent years, and the Combined Group will maximise the opportunities for future growth and profitability with a shared commitment to operational excellence, allowing us to continue to invest in our people, products and services for customers worldwide for years to come.\n\n4\n\nSlaughter and May is acting as legal adviser to Meggitt in connection with the Acquisition.\n\nFurther information\n\nThis announcement is not intended to and does not constitute, or form part of, an offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to the Acquisition or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities of Meggitt in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. The Acquisition will be made solely by means of the Scheme Document, which, together with the Forms of Proxy, will contain the full terms and conditions of the Acquisition including details of how to vote in respect of the Acquisition. Any vote in respect of the Scheme or other response in relation to the Acquisition should be made only on the basis on the information contained in the Scheme Document.\n\nPlease be aware that addresses, electronic addresses and certain other information provided by Meggitt Shareholders, persons with information rights and other relevant persons for the receipt of communications from Meggitt may be provided to Parker during the offer period as required under Section 4 of Appendix 4 of the Code to comply with Rule 2.11(c).\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Limited (Citi), which is authorised in the UK by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and PRA, is acting exclusively for Parker and no one else in connection with the Acquisition and will not be responsible to anyone other than Parker for providing the protections afforded to clients of Citi nor for providing advice in relation to the Acquisition or any other matters referred to in this announcement. Neither Citi nor any of its affiliates, directors or employees owes or accepts any duty, liability or responsibility whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, consequential, whether in contract, in tort, in delict, under statute or otherwise) to any person who is not a client of Citi in connection with this announcement, any statement contained herein, the Acquisition or otherwise.\n\nNM Rothschild & Sons Limited (Rothschild & Co), which is authorised and regulated in the UK by the FCA, is acting exclusively for Meggitt and no-one else in connection with the Acquisition and will not be responsible to anyone other than Meggitt for providing the protections afforded to clients of Rothschild & Co nor for providing advice in relation to the Acquisition or any other matters referred to in this announcement.\n\nMorgan Stanley & Co. International plc (Morgan Stanley) which is authorised by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and the PRA in the UK is acting exclusively as financial adviser and corporate broker to Meggitt and no one else in connection with the matters set out in this announcement. In connection with such matters, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents will not regard any other person as their client, nor will they be responsible to any other person for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for providing advice in relation to the contents of this announcement or any other matter referred to herein.\n\nMerrill Lynch International (BofA Securities), which is authorised by the PRA and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA and the PRA, is acting as financial adviser and corporate broker exclusively for Meggitt and no one else in connection with the subject matter of this announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than Meggitt for providing the protections afforded to clients of BofA Securities nor for providing advice in relation to the subject matter of this announcement or any other matter or arrangement referred to herein.\n\n7\n\nOverseas jurisdictions\n\nThe release, publication or distribution of this announcement in or into jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the law of any jurisdiction other than the UK should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. In particular, the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom to vote their Meggitt Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. This announcement has been prepared for the purposes of complying with English law and the Code and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside of England.\n\nCopies of this announcement and formal documentation relating to the Acquisition will not be and must not be, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation), the Takeover Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into or by use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, facsimile, email or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Takeover Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or from within any Restricted Jurisdiction.\n\nFurther details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained in the Scheme Document.\n\nAdditional information for US investors\n\nThe Acquisition is being made to acquire the securities of an English company by means of a scheme of arrangement provided for under English law. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules under the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Scheme will be subject to disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the UK to schemes of arrangement, which are different from the disclosure requirements of the US tender offer rules. Certain financial information included in this announcement and the Scheme documentation has been or will have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and thus may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US. However, if Parker exercises its right to implement the acquisition of the Meggitt Shares by way of a Takeover Offer in accordance with the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, such offer will be made in compliance with applicable US laws and regulations.\n\n8\n\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by a US holder as consideration for the transfer of its Scheme Shares pursuant to the Scheme may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable United States state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each Meggitt Shareholder is urged to consult with independent professional advisers immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to it.\n\nIt may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Meggitt is located in a country other than the US, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the US. US holders may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US courts judgement.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, in accordance with normal UK practice, Parker or its nominees, or its brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Meggitt Shares outside of the US, other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition and/or Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. If Parker elects to implement the Acquisition by way of Takeover Offer in accordance with the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, such Takeover Offer will be made in compliance with applicable US laws and regulations, including Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act, as amended, and Regulation 14E thereunder, subject to exemptive relief, including in respect of Rule 14e-5 thereunder.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, normal United Kingdom market practice and Rule 14e-5(b) of the US Exchange Act, BofA Securities, Morgan Stanley and their affiliates will continue to act as exempt principal traders in Meggitt securities on the London Stock Exchange. These purchases and activities by exempt principal traders which are required to be made public in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Code will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. This information will also be publicly disclosed in the United States to the extent that such information is made public in the United Kingdom.\n\nForward looking statements\n\nThis announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by Parker and Meggitt contain statements which are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements, including for the purposes of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of Parker and Meggitt about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on Parker and Meggitt, the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical\n\n9\n\nfacts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as plans, expects or does not expect, is expected, is subject to, budget, scheduled, estimates, forecasts, intends, targets, anticipates or does not anticipate, or believes, or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results may, could, should, would, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved. Although Parker and Meggitt believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, Parker and Meggitt can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include the satisfaction of the Conditions, as well as additional factors, such as: local and global political and economic conditions; significant price discounting by competitors; inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals; changes in consumer habits and preferences; foreign exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations (including those from any potential credit rating decline); legal or regulatory developments and changes; the outcome of any litigation; the impact of any acquisitions or similar transactions; competitive product and pricing pressures; success of business and operating initiatives; government actions and natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and pandemics; and changes in the level of capital investment. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither Parker nor Meggitt, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FCA), neither Parker nor Meggitt is under any obligation, and Parker and Meggitt expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nDealing disclosure requirements\n\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the persons interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\n\n10\n\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the persons interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.\n\nIf two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.\n\nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).\n\nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover Panels website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panels Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.\n\nNo profit forecasts, estimates or quantified financial benefits statements\n\nNo statement in this announcement is intended as a profit forecast, profit estimate or quantified benefits statement for any period and no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for Parker or Meggitt, as appropriate, for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for Parker or Meggitt, as appropriate.\n\nNote regarding non-US GAAP financial measures\n\nThis announcement contains references to non-US GAAP financial information for Meggitt, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and EBITDA margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with US GAAP, Parker believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating the company performance for the period presented. For further information, see Appendix 2 (Bases and Sources).\n\nRounding\n\nCertain figures included in this announcement have been subjected to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of figures that precede them.\n\n11\n\nTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION\n\nNot for release, publication or distribution, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction\n\nFor immediate release\n\n2 August 2021\n\nRECOMMENDED CASH ACQUISITION\n\nof\n\nMEGGITT PLC\n\nby\n\nPARKER-HANNIFIN CORPORATION\n\nto be effected by means of a Scheme of Arrangement\n\nunder Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe boards of directors of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (Parker) and Meggitt PLC (Meggitt) are pleased to announce that they have reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt by Parker. It is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the Companies Act.\n\n2.\n\nThe Acquisition\n\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition, which will be subject to the Conditions and further terms set out in Appendix 1 to this announcement and to the full terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document, Scheme Shareholders at the Scheme Record Time will be entitled to receive:\n\nfor each Scheme Share: 800 pence in cash\n\nThe Acquisition values Meggitts entire issued and to be issued share capital at approximately £6.3 billion on a fully diluted basis.\n\nThe price of 800 pence in cash for each Scheme Share represents:\n\n13\n\nIf, after the date of this announcement and prior to the Effective Date, any dividend and/or other distribution and/or other return of capital or value is declared, made or paid or becomes payable in respect of the Meggitt Shares, Parker reserves the right to reduce the consideration payable under the terms of the Acquisition at such date by an amount up to the amount of such dividend and/or distribution and/or other return of capital or value. In such circumstances, Meggitt Shareholders would be entitled to retain any such dividend and/or other distribution and/or other return of capital or value.\n\nParker is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets.\n\nIn considering prospective acquisitions, Parker looks for targets that are well aligned culturally, as well as strategically, with the goals of The Win Strategy. This is Parkers global business system, representing a unified strategic vision for its team members worldwide. Anchored by Parkers culture, values and purpose, The Win Strategy defines the key operational priorities and metrics used to drive team member engagement, customer experience, profitable growth, and financial performance.\n\nParker believes Meggitt is very well aligned with Parker and the goals of The Win Strategy. Parker further believes that the Acquisition would be strategically and culturally compelling, and enhance the future prospects of the Combined Group within global aerospace and defence industries, for the following key reasons:\n\n14\n\nMeggitt and Parker share a heritage as established manufacturers with significant presence across the UK, serving as trusted defence suppliers to the UK and US governments, and governments across the EU and globally. The UK is an important market to Parker and a key part of its business. Parker is a highly experienced acquirer with prior experience of successfully integrating UK companies in the industrial sector (including a publicly listed company) into its business. These continue to thrive within the Parker Group. The Acquisition of Meggitt is aligned with Parkers capital deployment strategy. Consistent with its track record as an acquirer, Parker will be a responsible steward of Meggitt, recognising Meggitts strong UK heritage and safeguarding relevant stakeholders interests. Parker has therefore agreed with Meggitt to offer a number of legally binding commitments to HM Government, as further detailed in paragraph 9 below.\n\nBased on the preliminary analysis to identify potential synergies and relying principally on Parkers understanding of the market and experience in conducting and integrating previous acquisitions, Parker expects that, following completion of the Acquisition, it can achieve $300 million (approximately £216 million) of pre-tax synergies from its combination with Meggitt. It is expected that these synergies will be achieved by the end of the third full year following completion of the Acquisition, and Parker expects to incur approximately $250 million (approximately £180 million) in cumulative one-time pre-tax costs to achieve these synergies. Parker anticipates synergies to be achieved primarily through the implementation of The Win Strategy, improvements to the Combined Groups supply chain, lean, productivity and SG&A operations, as well as continuing Meggitts strategy of footprint optimisation.\n\nThe terms of the Acquisition imply a US GAAP Enterprise Value multiple of 16.3x 2019 US GAAP EBITDA and 10.9x 2019 US GAAP EBITDA (including estimated pre-tax synergies of £216 million) for Meggitt.\n\nParker expects the combination to be earnings accretive in the first full 12 months after closing. The Acquisition is expected to drive incremental sales growth and cash flow accretion, and deliver a high single-digit ROIC in year 5 which should grow thereafter.2 Parker remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit rating.\n\n2\n\nExcludes one-time costs and deal related amortisation.\n\n15\n\n4.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe directors of Meggitt, who have been so advised by Rothschild & Co and Morgan Stanley as to the financial terms of the Acquisition, consider the terms of the Acquisition to be fair and reasonable. In providing their advice, Rothschild & Co and Morgan Stanley have taken into account the commercial assessments of the directors of Meggitt.\n\nAccordingly, the directors of Meggitt intend unanimously to recommend that Meggitt Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting as the directors of Meggitt have irrevocably undertaken to do in respect of those Meggitt Shares they hold and in respect of which they control the voting rights (representing approximately 0.05 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt on 30 July 2021 (being the last business day before this announcement)). Further details of these undertakings, including the circumstances in which they cease to be binding, are set out in Appendix 3 to this announcement.\n\nMeggitt is one of the worlds leading aerospace, defence and selected energy market businesses, with a unique portfolio of technologies, products and capabilities that underpin strong market positions.\n\nIn recent years, management has been successfully delivering a strategy that has fundamentally improved Meggitts competitive position and its standing with customers, transitioning the business from a conglomerate holding company to a focused and strategically cohesive business through a programme of non-core disposals and targeted partnerships and acquisitions. Meggitt has continued to increase its exposure to attractive and growing markets where it has strong competitive positions through its investment in differentiated technology and capabilities. The companys strategy to develop best-in-class products and technologies for aerospace and defence markets, with very high requirements for product safety, performance and reliability, has resulted in strong sole-source, life-of-programme positions on growing aerospace platforms. In turn, this has delivered an increase of approximately 70 per cent. in shipset content on average on the latest generation of platforms. This strong position in original equipment underpins Meggitts presence in the aftermarket which has enabled Meggitt to secure attractive long-term annuity revenue streams. In combination with its strong aerospace and defence positions, Meggitt has a highly attractive aero-derived Energy business with strong growth opportunities in renewables and low carbon applications.\n\nThe benefits of Meggitts strategy were increasingly clear prior to COVID-19, with Meggitt recording seven consecutive quarters of revenue growth, achieving record operating profit and strong cash generation in FY 2019, and creating significant value for shareholders.\n\nWith the onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, management took quick and decisive action in the face of unprecedented challenges in the aerospace sector, resulting in significant cash savings and positioning the business to remain competitive in that environment. Meggitt successfully delivered £450m of in-year cash savings, generated positive free cash flow and reduced net debt in FY 2020. Meggitt also continued to progress key strategic initiatives including the sale of its Training Systems business, investment in the Ansty Park campus, and the acceleration of Meggitts existing sustainability strategy.\n\n16\n\nAccordingly, following careful consideration of both the financial terms of the Acquisition and Parkers plans for the Meggitt business under Parkers ownership, the Meggitt Board intends to recommend unanimously the Acquisition to Meggitt Shareholders.\n\n6.\n\nIrrevocable undertakings\n\nAs described above, Parker has received irrevocable undertakings from the directors of Meggitt to vote in favour of the Scheme at the Court Meeting and the Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting (and, if the Acquisition is subsequently structured as a Takeover Offer, to accept any Takeover Offer made by Parker in accordance with the terms of the irrevocable undertakings) in respect of those Meggitt Shares that they legally and/or beneficially hold and the voting rights of which they control, amounting to, in aggregate, 409,769 Meggitt Shares, representing approximately 0.05 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital as at 30 July 2021 (being the last business day before this announcement).\n\nThe undertakings from the directors of Meggitt remain binding in the event of a higher competing offer for Meggitt and will cease to be binding only if (i) the Scheme Document is not despatched to Meggitt Shareholders within 28 days (or such longer period as may be permitted by the Panel) after the date of this announcement; (ii) Parker announces that it does not intend to make or proceed with the Acquisition and no new, revised or replacement Takeover Offer or Scheme is announced in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code at the same time; (iii) if the Takeover Offer or Scheme lapses or is withdrawn and no new, revised or replacement Takeover Offer or Scheme has been announced, in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code, in its place or is announced, in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code, at the same time; or (iv) any competing offer for the entire issued and to be issue share capital of Meggitt becomes or is declared wholly unconditional or, if proceeding by way of a scheme of arrangement, becomes effective.\n\nFurther details of these irrevocable undertakings, including the circumstances in which they cease to be binding, are set out in Appendix 3 to this announcement.\n\n7.\n\nInformation relating to Parker\n\nParker is a leading worldwide diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, providing precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets. Parker was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, USA in 1917 and incorporated in Ohio, USA in 1938.\n\n18\n\nParker currently has over 50,000 team members globally, and manufacturing, service, sales, distribution and administrative facilities in 49 countries. Parker supplies its products to approximately 464,000 customers in virtually every significant manufacturing, transportation and processing industry.\n\nIn its most recently completed and reported fiscal year, which ended 30 June 2020, Parker reported net sales of US$13.70 billion and net income of US$1.21 billion.\n\nParker has a long and successful history in the UK, having operated in the UK for over 50 years, and currently employs more than 2,100 team members in 18 facilities across the country. Parker is a highly experienced acquirer with prior experience of successfully integrating UK companies in the industrial sector (including a publicly listed company) into its business. These continue to thrive within the Parker Group. Parker believes strongly in the importance of cultural fit and leadership, as well as employee engagement, in creating and nurturing successful organisations. These priorities are thus prominently reflected in The Win Strategy and practised and reinforced throughout the Parker organisation.\n\n8.\n\nInformation relating to Meggitt\n\nHeadquartered in the United Kingdom, Meggitt is an international group and a world leader in the aerospace, defence and energy markets, employing more than 9,000 people at over 40 manufacturing facilities and regional offices worldwide.\n\nWorking closely with its customers, Meggitt delivers technologically differentiated systems and products for the most demanding environments with high certification requirements for applications across its core end markets. Through focusing on engineering and operational excellence, Meggitt builds broad installed bases of equipment and provides through life services and support across a fleet of approximately 73,000 aircraft. As well as ensuring that its products and technologies satisfy the highest requirements for product safety, performance and reliability, Meggitt continues to prioritise investment in sustainable technology solutions for customers.\n\nMeggitts defence business accounts for 46 per cent. of Meggitt Group revenue with over 70 per cent. of revenue derived from its core US market. With equipment on an installed base of around 22,000 fixed wing and rotary aircraft and a significant number of ground vehicles, Meggitt is well placed, having secured strong positions on some of the newest and hardest worked platforms.\n\nIn energy and other markets, which represents 11 per cent. of Meggitt Group revenue, Meggitts leading technologies and aerospace derived innovation serve a number of core end markets, primarily onshore and offshore gas and LNG and power generation applications. While Meggitt already has significant exposure to lower carbon applications, primarily in gas and LNG, it continues to build a strong pipeline of new opportunities in these areas as well as renewables.\n\nMeggitt operates across four vertically integrated, customer aligned divisions:\n\n19\n\nUK strategic capability and commitment\n\nParker recognises the important role that Meggitt plays, both as a leading UK business and in supporting the UKs strategic capabilities. Under its ownership, Parker will be a responsible steward of the Meggitt business and will continue to demonstrate a commitment to supporting the success of the UK, at home and abroad.\n\nParker will commit to ensuring that Meggitt will continue to meet its contractual obligations in respect of goods and services supplied to or for the benefit of HM Government, and maintain Meggitts existing technology and manufacturing that resides in the UK for the benefit of HM Government, as required.\n\nDemonstrating Parkers commitment to the UK, following completion of the Acquisition, the majority of the board of directors of Meggitt, which will be a subsidiary of Parker, will be UK nationals and, where required, security-cleared. Further, the majority of the board of directors of relevant subsidiaries of Meggitt will also be UK nationals and, where required, security-cleared. Parker will also support Meggitts continued active participation in the ADS Group.\n\nParker recognises the high standards and protocols that need to be observed, and Parker remains committed to ensuring that Meggitt continues to comply with and enforce applicable security protocols prescribed by HM Government, and to allow officials to inspect Meggitts premises, as required, to verify compliance.\n\nEvaluation of the Meggitt business and implications of the Acquisition\n\nPrior to this announcement, consistent with market practice, Parker has been granted limited access to certain Meggitt information for the purposes of confirmatory due diligence. However, because of applicable regulatory controls, and the constraints of a public offer process, Parker has not received sufficiently detailed information to formulate definitive plans regarding the impact of the Acquisition on the Meggitt Group.\n\nBased on the limited work it has been able to conduct so far and subject to such further review, the principal sources of synergies across the Combined Group are currently anticipated to be in, among others, the following areas: procurement savings opportunities; footprint optimisation; overlap in central corporate and support functions; and general and administrative expenses.\n\nFollowing completion of the Acquisition, Parker intends to undertake a full evaluation of the Meggitt Group which is expected to last up to 12 months after the Effective Date (the Evaluation). While the parameters of the Evaluation have not yet been finalised, Parker expects that it will involve, among others, the following areas:\n\n22\n\nParker is supportive of the Meggitt Footprint Optimisation (as described below) and intends to work with Meggitt management to continue to implement it. Additionally, as part of the Evaluation, Parker intends to explore opportunities to enhance cost savings in these areas. This includes assessing Parkers legacy facilities and fixed assets to identify opportunities for these to be combined with Meggitt facilities.\n\nBusiness locations and fixed assets\n\nParker recognises the important role that Meggitt plays in defining the UK defence and aerospace sector as world-leading and is committed to protecting Meggitts rich UK heritage.\n\nIn recognition of the importance of supporting HM Governments levelling up agenda and to facilitate growth in its UK and European aerospace and defence businesses, Parker will maintain Meggitts UK headquarters, together with its new operational centre of excellence, at Ansty Park in Coventry, the West Midlands. Meggitts operations at Ansty Park will continue to comprise a range of manufacturing, engineering and support functions. Meggitts headquarter functions will also remain in Coventry (save for any changes to headquarter functions due to the reduction of PLC-related functions and overlaps, as described above). The Combined Groups headquarters will be located at Parkers head office in Cleveland, Ohio, USA.\n\nSubject to the ongoing execution of the Meggitt Footprint Optimisation (as described further above), Parker does not envisage any other material change to Meggitts or Parkers other locations of business, or any need to redeploy any of the Meggitt Groups or Parker Groups fixed assets, as a result of the Acquisition.\n\nBrand\n\nParker values and recognises the importance of Meggitts brand. After the Effective Date, each of Meggitts existing four divisions (being Airframe Systems, Engine Systems, Energy & Equipment and Services & Support) will operate under the combined Parker-Meggitt names.\n\nResearch and development\n\nAn effective R&D function lies at the heart of the success of both Parker and Meggitt and is central to the growth potential for the Combined Group. Parker will remain committed to enhancing the UKs position in defence and aerospace through R&D investment following the completion of the Acquisition.\n\n23\n\nParker will continue to work collaboratively across industry and with universities (including in the UK), government authorities and other companies as part of its leading R&D programmes. As Governments and businesses around the world combine to face the challenge posed by climate change, Parker is excited by the potential of the Combined Groups R&D function to accelerate the innovation of more-electric and low-carbon technologies.\n\nParker plans to continue to innovate and invest in R&D at Meggitt following the Acquisition. Parker will at least maintain Meggitts existing level of expenditure with respect to R&D in the UK and, subject to normal levels of growth and activity occurring in the aerospace industry, intends to increase this by at least 20 per cent. over the next five years.\n\nParker recognises the important role that sustainability plays in R&D and innovation, both in Meggitts long term strategy and HM Governments ambitions to address environmental, societal and governance concerns worldwide.\n\nParker will therefore maintain Meggitts target of investing at least two-thirds of its research and technology budget in projects relating to sustainable aviation and low-carbon energy. Furthermore, Parker fully supports and will adopt Meggitts targets of reducing net carbon emissions by 50 per cent. by 2025 and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across the existing Meggitt business.\n\nManagement and employees\n\nParker welcomes the opportunity to combine the skills and experience of the employees of the Meggitt Group in the Combined Group, for the benefit of both companies around the world.\n\nBased on Parker and Meggitts strong cultural alignment, Parker sees the Acquisition as a significant opportunity to combine the talent, learnings, and best practices of Meggitt and Parker, creating a stronger team and environment for the employees of the Combined Group. Furthermore, employees of Meggitt will benefit from new opportunities within the Combined Group.\n\nAs described above, Parker will undertake the Evaluation following completion of the Acquisition, and whilst Parker is, as yet, unable to draw any conclusions as to its likely outcomes insofar as they may impact employees, a number of commitments can be made at this point.\n\nParker intends to safeguard the existing employment rights of the management and employees of the Combined Group in accordance with applicable law and does not envisage any material change in their conditions of employment.\n\n24\n\nParker is particularly mindful of HM Governments initiatives that seek to provide alternative routes into employment through apprenticeships and retraining, and encouraging further take-up of vocational careers. Parker greatly values Meggitts commitments to these initiatives and to ensuring it attracts and develops the best talent in order to shape the future of the Meggitt business. As such:\n\nWhilst protecting and increasing investment in these areas, Parker sees the benefit of reviewing the ways in which the operations of the Combined Group can be further improved, which may impact employment roles within the organisation. Preliminary evaluation to date of impact on employees suggests that:\n\nIn addition, Parker will continue to implement Meggitts publicly announced global footprint consolidation strategy, reducing Meggitts footprint by a total of 50 per cent. from its 2016 baseline by 2023. This will include site consolidations, closures and rationalisations (the Meggitt Footprint Optimisation), together with an assessment as to whether Parkers legacy facilities and fixed assets located in North America may form part of the optimisation of the Combined Groups footprint, which may result in headcount reductions or relocation of Combined Group employees.\n\nThese reductions will not include employees engaged in R&D, product engineers, direct manufacturing labour or apprentices in the UK.\n\nThe finalisation and implementation of any restructuring, integration and workforce reductions will be subject to detailed and comprehensive planning as part of the Evaluation, will be based on growth prospects (in particular the rate of recovery of the aerospace industry), productivity and other similar considerations, and will be subject to appropriate engagement and consultation with stakeholders, including affected employees and any appropriate employee representative bodies in accordance with the legal obligations of the Combined Group. It is expected that, where appropriate, Parker will seek to reallocate staff from discontinued roles to other roles within the Combined Group.\n\n25\n\nParker would commence this engagement and consultation process long enough before any final decision is taken to implement any job reductions, so as to ensure compliance with relevant legal obligations.\n\nRetention Arrangements\n\nFor the purpose of protecting the business of Meggitt to be acquired through the Acquisition, Parker has agreed that Meggitt may implement certain employee retention arrangements for a number of key Meggitt employees whose retention is considered critical for the business.\n\nAs part of such arrangements, Parker has agreed that Mr Tony Wood (CEO of Meggitt) and Ms Louisa Burdett (CFO of Meggitt) will each be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to 50 per cent. of their respective annual base salaries (less any required deductions) which, in each case, will be payable, subject to and conditional upon: (i) completion of the Acquisition; (ii) de-listing of the Company; and (iii) the relevant director remaining in employment with a member of the Meggitt Group or the Parker Group and not having resigned prior to the payment date (the Executive Retention Arrangements). Subject to applicable leaver terms, such cash payments will be paid to the executive within 30 days after the Effective Date (or, if later the day following the date on which Meggitt is de-listed from the London Stock Exchange). The total aggregate value of all Executive Retention Arrangements is £540,000.\n\nIn order to promote the retention of certain Meggitt employees (including the Meggitt executive directors), Parker has agreed that, conditional upon completion of the Acquisition, it will implement a new transitional cash plan and will grant cash awards (the Transition Awards) under such plan to Meggitt employees who: (i) are employed with the Meggitt Group on the Effective Date; and (ii) hold unvested awards granted in 2019, 2020 and/or 2021 under the Meggitt 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP Awards). Such Transition Awards will be payable by Parker, subject to applicable leaver terms, on or as soon as practical after: (a) in respect of LTIP Awards granted in 2019, on the Effective Date; and (b) in respect of LTIP Awards granted in 2020 and/or 2021, on the normal vesting date of such LTIP Awards, subject to continued employment. The value of each eligible participants Transition Award(s) will equal the aggregate of the value of the Meggitt Shares underlying any portion of their LTIP Award(s) that lapsed due to the application of time pro-rating and/or any assessment of the applicable performance conditions in accordance with the rules of the LTIP, based on the same consideration payable per Meggitt Share as is payable under the Scheme.\n\nAs required by, and solely for the purposes of, Rule 16.2 of the Code, Rothschild & Co and Morgan Stanley have (in their capacity as independent advisers to Meggitt for the purposes of Rule 3 of the Code) reviewed the terms of the Executive Retention Arrangements and the Transition Awards together with other information deemed relevant and advised Meggitt that the Executive Retention Arrangements and the Transition Awards are fair and reasonable so far as Meggitt Shareholders are concerned. In providing their advice, Rothschild & Co and Morgan Stanley have taken into account the commercial assessments of the Meggitt directors.\n\n26\n\nThe existing non-executive directors of Meggitt will resign from office as directors of Meggitt with effect from the Effective Date.\n\nPensions\n\nParker recognises the importance of upholding Meggitts pension obligations and ensuring that its pension schemes are appropriately funded in accordance with statutory and trust deed requirements.\n\nMeggitt operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the Meggitt Pension Plan (the Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan). The Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan is closed to new members and to future accrual. It is not intended that any changes shall be made to reopen this scheme to the admission of new members or to the future accrual of benefits.\n\nParker has held constructive discussions with the trustee (the Trustee) of the Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan and Parker, the Trustee and Meggitt have entered into a legally binding memorandum of understanding dated 2 August 2021 (the Memorandum of Understanding) setting out the parties agreement with respect to the future funding of the Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan. The key terms of the Memorandum of Understanding include:\n\nThe Trustee has confirmed in the Memorandum of Understanding that, based on the information available to the Trustee as at the date of the Memorandum of Understanding and taking into account the undertakings provided by Parker under the Memorandum of Understanding, the Trustee has no reason to believe that the Acquisition would be materially detrimental to the ability of the Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan to meet its liabilities or to the likelihood of the accrued Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan benefits being received.\n\n27\n\nMeggitt also operates defined contribution pension arrangements in the UK and both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in other jurisdictions (together, the Other Pension Schemes). Parker does not intend to make any changes to the Other Pension Schemes (including with regard to accrual of benefits for existing members, the admission of new members and current arrangements for the funding of any scheme deficit) and confirms its intention for employer contributions to Other Pension Schemes to continue in line with current arrangements.\n\nTrading facilities\n\nMeggitt is currently listed on the Official List and, as set out in paragraph 15, a request will be made to the London Stock Exchange to cancel trading in Meggitt Shares and delist Meggitt from the Official List, to take effect on or shortly after the Effective Date.\n\nPost offer undertakings\n\nNo statement in this paragraph 10 constitutes or is intended to become a post offer undertaking under Rule 19.5 of the Code.\n\n11.\n\nFinancing\n\nThe cash consideration payable by Parker under the terms of the Acquisition, together with certain fees and expenses in connection with the Acquisition, is expected to be funded by a combination of cash resources, borrowing under debt facilities to be entered into or otherwise available to Parker and net proceeds of debt securities to be issued by Parker. Nothing in this announcement shall constitute the offer for sale of any securities. In support of its obligations to pay the cash consideration and such fees and expenses, Parker has entered into a term loan bridge facility obtained from Citibank, N.A. (the Bridge Facility). Parker has obtained the fully committed Bridge Facility from Citibank, N.A., as sole lead arranger, sole bookrunner, sole administrative agent and, together with Citicorp North America, Inc., as lenders.\n\nIn due course, and in place of drawing under the Bridge Facility, Parker intends to obtain and enter into: (i) a new $2,000,000,000 senior unsecured term loan facility, which will be used to reduce (and partially replace) the Bridge Facility; and (ii) an amendment to its existing revolving credit agreement to increase the commitments thereunder and to make certain other changes to the terms thereof in connection with the Acquisition.\n\nCiti confirms that it is satisfied that sufficient resources are available to Parker to satisfy in full the cash consideration payable under the terms of the Scheme.\n\nFurther information on the financing of the Acquisition will be set out in the Scheme Document.\n\n12.\n\nMeggitt Share Schemes\n\nParticipants in the Meggitt Share Schemes will be contacted regarding the effect of the Acquisition on their rights and appropriate proposals will be made to such participants in due course. Details of these proposals will be set out in separate letters to be sent to participants in the Meggitt Share Schemes.\n\n28\n\n13.\n\nOffer-related arrangements and Memorandum of Understanding\n\nConfidentiality Agreement\n\nParker and Meggitt have entered into a confidentiality agreement dated 1 July 2021 (the Confidentiality Agreement) pursuant to which Parker has undertaken, amongst other things: (a) to keep confidential information relating to the Acquisition and Meggitt and not to disclose it to third parties (other than certain permitted parties) unless required by law or regulation or with the consent of Meggitt; and (b) to use the confidential information for the sole purpose of evaluating, negotiating, or implementing the Acquisition. These confidentiality obligations remain in force until the earlier of: (i) 18 months from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement; and (ii) the date of completion of the Acquisition. The agreement also contains provisions pursuant to which Parker has agreed not to solicit certain employees, consultants or independent contractors of Meggitt, subject to customary carve-outs, for a period of 12 months from the date of the Confidentiality Agreement.\n\nCooperation Agreement\n\nParker and Meggitt have entered into a cooperation agreement dated 2 August 2021, (the Cooperation Agreement) pursuant to which, among other things:\n\nUnder the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, Parker has agreed with Meggitt that it will offer a number of legally binding commitments to HM Government, as further described at paragraph 9 above.\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement records the parties intentions to implement the Acquisition by way of Scheme, subject to the ability of Parker to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer in certain circumstances set out in the Cooperation Agreement and with the consent of the Panel.\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement will be capable of termination by either party in certain circumstances, including if the Scheme does not become Effective by the Long-Stop Date, a competing transaction completes, becomes effective or is declared or becomes unconditional in all respects, any Condition has been invoked by Parker (in circumstances where invocation of the relevant Condition is permitted by the Panel) prior to the Long-Stop Date or if the Acquisition is withdrawn or lapses in accordance with its terms prior to the Long-Stop Date.\n\n29\n\nIn addition, Parker may terminate the Cooperation Agreement on written notice to Meggitt where the Meggitt directors have publicly withdrawn, adversely qualified, adversely modified or failed to reaffirm or re-issue (when reasonably requested by Parker to do so) their unanimous and unconditional recommendation that Meggitt Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme or a competing transaction is either recommended by the directors of Meggitt or completes, becomes effective or is declared or becomes unconditional in all respects.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, Parker has undertaken that it will deliver a notice in writing to Meggitt on the business day prior to the Scheme Court Hearing confirming either: (i) the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions (other than Condition 2); or (ii) if permitted by the Panel, that it intends to invoke one or more Conditions.\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement also contains provisions that will apply in respect of the Meggitt Share Schemes and certain other employee incentive arrangements.\n\nClean Team Agreement\n\nParker and Meggitt have entered into a due diligence clean team agreement dated 7 July 2021 (the Clean Team Agreement), which sets out how any confidential information that is commercially sensitive can be disclosed, used or shared for the purposes of due diligence, synergies evaluation, integration planning and regulatory clearance. Such commercially sensitive information must only be made available to the party receiving information through designated persons removed from day-to-day commercial or strategic operations and decisions and external professional advisers. The findings of such designated persons and external advisers may only be relayed to other employees, officers and directors of the receiving party in specified circumstances and subject to certain restrictions.\n\nCJDA\n\nFurther, Parker, Meggitt and their respective legal counsel have entered into a confidentiality and joint defence agreement dated 5 July 2021 (the CJDA), the purpose of which is to ensure that the exchange and/or disclosure of certain materials relating to the parties and in relation to, in particular, the anti-trust and regulatory workstream only takes place between their respective legal counsel and external experts, and does not diminish in any way the confidentiality of such materials and does not result in a waiver of any privilege, right or immunity that might otherwise be available.\n\nMemorandum of Understanding\n\nParker, the Trustee and Meggitt have entered into a legally binding Memorandum of Understanding dated 2 August 2021 setting out the parties agreement with respect to the future funding of the Meggitt UK DB Pension Plan. Further details of the Memorandum of Understanding are set out at paragraph 10 above under the heading Pensions.\n\n30\n\n14.\n\nStructure of the Acquisition\n\nIt is intended that the Acquisition will be implemented by way of a Court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement between Meggitt and the Scheme Shareholders, under Part 26 of the Companies Act. The procedure involves, among other things, an application by Meggitt to the Court to sanction the Scheme, by which Scheme Shares held by Scheme Shareholders will be transferred to Parker in consideration for which the Scheme Shareholders will receive cash on the basis described in paragraph 2 above. The purpose of the Scheme is to provide for Parker to become the owner of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Meggitt.\n\nThe Scheme is subject to the Conditions and certain further terms referred to in Appendix 1 to this announcement and to the full terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document. In particular, the Scheme will only become effective if, among other things, the following events occur on or before the Long-Stop Date:\n\nAny Meggitt Shares issued before the Scheme Record Time will be subject to the terms of the Scheme. The Resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting will, amongst other matters, provide that the Articles be amended to incorporate provisions requiring any Meggitt Shares issued or transferred after the Scheme Record Time (other than to Parker and/or its nominees) to be automatically transferred to Parker (and, where applicable, for consideration to be paid to the transferee or the original recipient of the Meggitt Shares so transferred or issued) on the same terms as the Acquisition (other than terms as to timings and formalities). The provisions of the Articles (as amended) will avoid any person (other than Parker and its nominees) holding Meggitt Shares after the Effective Date.\n\nUpon the Scheme becoming effective: (i) it will be binding on all Scheme Shareholders, irrespective of whether or not they attended or voted at the Court Meeting or the General Meeting (and if they attended and voted, whether or not they voted in favour);\n\n31\n\nand (ii) share certificates in respect of Meggitt Shares will cease to be valid and entitlements to Meggitt Shares held within the CREST system will be cancelled. The consideration for the transfer of Scheme Shares to Parker will be dispatched to Scheme Shareholders no later than 14 days after the Effective Date.\n\nIf any Condition in paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 to this announcement is not capable of being satisfied by the date specified therein, Parker shall make an announcement through a Regulatory Information Service as soon as practicable and in any event by no later than 8.00 a.m. (London time) on the business day following the date so specified, stating whether Parker has invoked that Condition, (where applicable) waived that Condition or, with the agreement of Meggitt, specified a new date by which that Condition must be satisfied (with the Panels consent and as the Court may approve (if such consent(s) or approval(s) is/are required)).\n\nIf the Scheme does not become effective on or before the Long-Stop Date, it will lapse and the Acquisition will not proceed (unless the Panel requires an extension to the Long-Stop Date pending final determination of an issue under section 3(g) of Appendix 7 of the Code).\n\nThe Scheme Document will include full details of the Scheme, together with notices of the Court Meeting and the General Meeting. The Scheme Document will also contain the expected timetable for the Acquisition, and will specify the necessary actions to be taken by Meggitt Shareholders. It is expected that the Scheme Document, together with the Forms of Proxy, will be sent to Meggitt Shareholders and, for information only, to persons with information rights and to holders of options granted under the Meggitt Share Schemes, as soon as practicable and in any event within 28 days of this announcement.\n\nThe Acquisition is expected to complete during Q3 of 2022, subject to the satisfaction or (where applicable) waiver of the Conditions. An expected timetable of principal events will be included in the Scheme Document.\n\nThe Acquisition is conditional on a number of antitrust and regulatory approvals and Parker will make further announcements in respect of such approvals as appropriate.\n\n15.\n\nDelisting and re-registration\n\nIt is intended that an application will be made to the FCA for the cancellation of the listing of the Meggitt Shares on the Official List and to the London Stock Exchange for the cancellation of trading of the Meggitt Shares on the London Stock Exchanges main market for listed securities, with effect as of or shortly following the Effective Date.\n\nIt is expected that the last day for dealings in Meggitt Shares on the main market of the London Stock Exchange is expected to be the last business day immediately prior to the Effective Date and no transfers shall be registered after 6.00 p.m. (London time) on that date.\n\nIt is also intended that, following the Scheme becoming effective, Meggitt will be re-registered as a private company under the relevant provisions of the Companies Act.\n\n32\n\n16.\n\nDisclosure of interests in Meggitt relevant securities\n\nExcept for the irrevocable undertakings referred to in paragraph 6 above, as at close of business on 30 July 2021 (being the business day before this announcement), neither Parker, nor any of the directors of Parker or any member of the Parker Group, nor, so far as the directors of Parker are aware, any person acting in concert with Parker for the purposes of the Acquisition had any interest in, right to subscribe for, or had borrowed or lent any Meggitt Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into Meggitt Shares, nor did any such person have any short position (whether conditional or absolute and whether in the money or otherwise), including any short position under a derivative, any agreement to sell or any delivery obligation or right to require another person to take delivery, or any dealing arrangement of the kind referred to in Note 11 of the definition of acting in concert in the Code, in relation to Meggitt Shares or in relation to any securities convertible or exchangeable into Meggitt Shares.\n\nIn the interests of secrecy prior to this announcement, Parker has not made any enquiries in respect of the matters referred to in this paragraph of certain parties who may be deemed by the Panel to be acting in concert with Parker for the purposes of the Scheme. Enquiries of such parties will be made as soon as practicable following the date of this announcement and any disclosure in respect of such parties will be included in the Scheme Document.\n\n17.\n\nOverseas shareholders\n\nThe availability of the Acquisition and the distribution of this announcement to Meggitt Shareholders who are not resident in the United Kingdom may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. Such persons should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements of their jurisdiction. Meggitt Shareholders who are in any doubt regarding such matters should consult an appropriate independent professional adviser in the relevant jurisdiction without delay.\n\nThis announcement does not constitute an offer for sale for any securities or an offer or an invitation to purchase any securities. Meggitt Shareholders are advised to read carefully the Scheme Document and related Forms of Proxy once these have been dispatched.\n\n18.\n\nMeggitts issued share capital\n\nIn accordance with Rule 2.9 of the Code, Meggitt confirms that, as at close of business on 30 July 2021 (being the last business day before to the date of this announcement), it has 781,372,024 Meggitt Shares in issue (excluding shares held in treasury). The International Securities Identification Number for Meggitt Shares is GB0005758098.\n\n19.\n\nDocuments published on a website\n\nCopies of the following documents will, by no later than 12 noon (London time) on 3 August 2021, be published on Meggitts website at www.meggittoffer.com and Parkers website at www.aerospacegrowth.com until the end of the Acquisition:\n\n(a)\n\nthis announcement;\n\n33\n\nNeither the contents of Meggitts website and Parkers website, nor the contents of any other website accessible from hyperlinks on such websites, are incorporated into or form part of this announcement.\n\n20.\n\nGeneral\n\nParker reserves the right to elect (with the consent of the Panel and subject to and in accordance with the terms of the Cooperation Agreement) to implement the Acquisition by way of a Takeover Offer for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Meggitt not already held by Parker as an alternative to the Scheme. In such an event, the Takeover Offer will be implemented on substantially the same terms (subject to appropriate amendments), so far as applicable, as those which would apply to the Scheme, including the inclusion of an acceptance condition set at 75 per cent. of the Meggitt Shares (or such other lower percentage as Parker may, subject to the rules of the Code and the terms of the Cooperation Agreement and with the consent of the Panel, decide).\n\nIf the Acquisition is effected by way of a Takeover Offer and such Takeover Offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects and sufficient acceptances are received, Parker intends to: (i) make a request to the FCA to cancel the listing of the Meggitt Shares from the Official List; (ii) make a request to the London Stock Exchange to cancel trading in Meggitt Shares on its market for listed securities; and (iii) exercise its rights, if available, to apply the provisions of Chapter 3 of Part 28 of the Companies Act to acquire compulsorily the remaining Meggitt Shares in respect of which the Takeover Offer has not been accepted.\n\nThe Scheme will be governed by English law and will be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. The Scheme will be subject to the applicable requirements of the Code, the Panel, the London Stock Exchange and the FCA.\n\nThe Acquisition will be made on the terms and subject to the Conditions and further terms set out in Appendix 1 to this announcement and the full terms and conditions to be set out in the Scheme Document. The bases and sources of certain financial information contained in this announcement are set out in Appendix 2 to this announcement. Certain terms used in this announcement are defined in Appendix 4 to this announcement.\n\n34\n\nFTI Consulting +44 (0)20 3727 1340 Nick Hasell Alex Le May Dwight Burden\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP is acting as legal adviser to Parker in connection with the Acquisition.\n\nSlaughter and May is acting as legal adviser to Meggitt in connection with the Acquisition.\n\nFurther information\n\nThis announcement is not intended to and does not constitute, or form part of, an offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to the Acquisition or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities of Meggitt in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. The Acquisition will be made solely by means of the Scheme Document, which, together with the Forms of Proxy, will contain the full terms and conditions of the Acquisition including details of how to vote in respect of the Acquisition. Any vote in respect of the Scheme or other response in relation to the Acquisition should be made only on the basis on the information contained in the Scheme Document.\n\nPlease be aware that addresses, electronic addresses and certain other information provided by Meggitt Shareholders, persons with information rights and other relevant persons for the receipt of communications from Meggitt may be provided to Parker during the offer period as required under Section 4 of Appendix 4 of the Code to comply with Rule 2.11(c).\n\nCiti, which is authorised in the UK by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and PRA, is acting exclusively for Parker and no one else in connection with the Acquisition and will not be responsible to anyone other than Parker for providing the protections afforded to clients of Citi nor for providing advice in relation to the Acquisition or any other matters referred to in this announcement. Neither Citi nor any of its affiliates, directors or employees owes or accepts any duty, liability or responsibility whatsoever (whether direct or indirect, consequential, whether in contract, in tort, in delict, under statute or otherwise) to any person who is not a client of Citi in connection with this announcement, any statement contained herein, the Acquisition or otherwise.\n\nRothschild & Co, which is authorised and regulated in the UK by the FCA, is acting exclusively for Meggitt and no-one else in connection with the Acquisition and will not be responsible to anyone other than Meggitt for providing the protections afforded to clients of Rothschild & Co nor for providing advice in relation to the Acquisition or any other matters referred to in this announcement.\n\nMorgan Stanley which is authorised by the PRA and regulated by the FCA and the PRA in the UK is acting exclusively as financial adviser and corporate broker to Meggitt and no one else in connection with the matters set out in this announcement. In connection with such matters, Morgan Stanley, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents will not regard any other person as their client, nor will they be responsible to any other person for providing the protections afforded to their clients or for providing advice in relation to the contents of this announcement or any other matter referred to herein.\n\n36\n\nBofA Securities, which is authorised by the PRA and regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA and the PRA, is acting as financial adviser and corporate broker exclusively for Meggitt and no one else in connection with the subject matter of this announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than Meggitt for providing the protections afforded to clients of BofA Securities nor for providing advice in relation to the subject matter of this announcement or any other matter or arrangement referred to herein.\n\nOverseas jurisdictions\n\nThe release, publication or distribution of this announcement in or into jurisdictions other than the UK may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the law of any jurisdiction other than the UK should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. In particular the ability of persons who are not resident in the United Kingdom, to vote their Meggitt Shares with respect to the Scheme at the Court Meeting, or to appoint another person as proxy to vote at the Court Meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Acquisition disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person. This announcement has been prepared for the purposes of complying with English law and the Code and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside of England.\n\nCopies of this announcement and formal documentation relating to the Acquisition will not be and must not be, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. If the Acquisition is implemented by way of Takeover Offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation), the Takeover Offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into or by use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, facsimile, email or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of any Restricted Jurisdiction and the Takeover Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or from within any Restricted Jurisdiction.\n\nFurther details in relation to Overseas Shareholders will be contained in the Scheme Document.\n\nAdditional information for US investors\n\nThe Acquisition is being made to acquire the securities of an English company by means of a scheme of arrangement provided for under English law. A transaction effected by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules under the US Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Scheme will be subject to disclosure requirements and practices applicable in\n\n37\n\nthe UK to schemes of arrangement, which are different from the disclosure requirements of the US tender offer rules. Certain financial information included in this announcement and the Scheme documentation has been or will have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and thus may not be comparable to financial information of US companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the US. However, if Parker exercises its right to implement the acquisition of the Meggitt Shares by way of a Takeover Offer in accordance with the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, such offer will be made in compliance with applicable US laws and regulations.\n\nThe receipt of cash pursuant to the Acquisition by a US holder as consideration for the transfer of its Scheme Shares pursuant to the Scheme may be a taxable transaction for United States federal income tax purposes and under applicable United States state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each Meggitt Shareholder is urged to consult with independent professional advisers immediately regarding the tax consequences of the Acquisition applicable to it.\n\nIt may be difficult for US holders to enforce their rights and claims arising out of the US federal securities laws, since Meggitt is located in a country other than the US, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the US. US holders may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US courts judgement.\n\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, in accordance with normal UK practice, Parker or its nominees, or its brokers (acting as agents), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, Meggitt Shares outside of the US, other than pursuant to the Acquisition, until the date on which the Acquisition and/or Scheme becomes effective, lapses or is otherwise withdrawn. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Any information about such purchases will be disclosed as required in the UK, will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. If Parker elects to implement the Acquisition by way of Takeover Offer in accordance with the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, such Takeover Offer will be made in compliance with applicable US laws and regulations, including Section 14(e) of the US Exchange Act, as amended, and Regulation 14E thereunder, subject to exemptive relief, including in respect of Rule 14e-5 thereunder.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, normal United Kingdom market practice and Rule 14e-5(b) of the US Exchange Act, BofA Securities, Morgan Stanley and their affiliates will continue to act as exempt principal traders in Meggitt securities on the London Stock Exchange. These purchases and activities by exempt principal traders which are required to be made public in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Code will be reported to a Regulatory Information Service and will be available on the London Stock Exchange website at www.londonstockexchange.com. This information will also be publicly disclosed in the United States to the extent that such information is made public in the United Kingdom.\n\n38\n\nForward looking statements\n\nThis announcement (including information incorporated by reference in this announcement), oral statements made regarding the Acquisition, and other information published by Parker and Meggitt contain statements which are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements, including for the purposes of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of the management of Parker and Meggitt about future events, and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this announcement include statements relating to the expected effects of the Acquisition on Parker and Meggitt, the expected timing and scope of the Acquisition and other statements other than historical facts. Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as plans, expects or does not expect, is expected, is subject to, budget, scheduled, estimates, forecasts, intends, targets, anticipates or does not anticipate, or believes, or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results may, could, should, would, might or will be taken, occur or be achieved. Although Parker and Meggitt believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, Parker and Meggitt can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These factors include the satisfaction of the Conditions, as well as additional factors, such as: local and global political and economic conditions; significant price discounting by competitors; inability to obtain, or meet conditions imposed for, required governmental and regulatory approvals; changes in consumer habits and preferences; foreign exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations (including those from any potential credit rating decline); legal or regulatory developments and changes; the outcome of any litigation; the impact of any acquisitions or similar transactions; competitive product and pricing pressures; success of business and operating initiatives; government actions and natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and pandemics; and changes in the level of capital investment. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. Neither Parker nor Meggitt, nor any of their respective associates or directors, officers or advisers, provides any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this announcement will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Other than in accordance with their legal or regulatory obligations (including under the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the FCA), neither Parker nor Meggitt is under any obligation, and Parker and Meggitt expressly disclaim any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n39\n\nDealing disclosure requirements\n\nUnder Rule 8.3(a) of the Code, any person who is interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of an offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror in respect of which it has been announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an Opening Position Disclosure following the commencement of the offer period and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An Opening Position Disclosure must contain details of the persons interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An Opening Position Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the commencement of the offer period and, if appropriate, by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the 10th business day following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. Relevant persons who deal in the relevant securities of the offeree company or of a securities exchange offeror prior to the deadline for making an Opening Position Disclosure must instead make a Dealing Disclosure.\n\nUnder Rule 8.3(b) of the Code, any person who is, or becomes, interested in 1% or more of any class of relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror must make a Dealing Disclosure if the person deals in any relevant securities of the offeree company or of any securities exchange offeror. A Dealing Disclosure must contain details of the dealing concerned and of the persons interests and short positions in, and rights to subscribe for, any relevant securities of each of (i) the offeree company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s), save to the extent that these details have previously been disclosed under Rule 8. A Dealing Disclosure by a person to whom Rule 8.3(b) applies must be made by no later than 3.30 pm (London time) on the business day following the date of the relevant dealing.\n\nIf two or more persons act together pursuant to an agreement or understanding, whether formal or informal, to acquire or control an interest in relevant securities of an offeree company or a securities exchange offeror, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3.\n\nOpening Position Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company and by any offeror and Dealing Disclosures must also be made by the offeree company, by any offeror and by any persons acting in concert with any of them (see Rules 8.1, 8.2 and 8.4).\n\nDetails of the offeree and offeror companies in respect of whose relevant securities Opening Position Disclosures and Dealing Disclosures must be made can be found in the Disclosure Table on the Takeover Panels website at www.thetakeoverpanel.org.uk, including details of the number of relevant securities in issue, when the offer period commenced and when any offeror was first identified. You should contact the Panels Market Surveillance Unit on +44 (0)20 7638 0129 if you are in any doubt as to whether you are required to make an Opening Position Disclosure or a Dealing Disclosure.\n\nNo profit forecasts, estimates or quantified financial benefits statements\n\nNo statement in this announcement is intended as a profit forecast, profit estimate or quantified benefits statement for any period and no statement in this announcement should be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share for Parker or Meggitt, as appropriate, for the current or future financial years would necessarily match or exceed the historical published earnings or earnings per share for Parker or Meggitt, as appropriate.\n\n40\n\nNote regarding non-US GAAP financial measures\n\nThis announcement contains references to non-US GAAP financial information for Meggitt, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and EBITDA margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with US GAAP, Parker believes that they are useful to an investor in evaluating the company performance for the period presented. For further information, see Appendix 2 (Bases and Sources).\n\nRounding\n\nCertain figures included in this announcement have been subjected to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of figures that precede them.\n\nPublication on website and hard copies\n\nA copy of this announcement and the documents required to be published by Rule 26 of the Code will be made available, subject to certain restrictions relating to persons resident in Restricted Jurisdictions, on Parkers website at www.aerospacegrowth.com and Meggitts website atwww.meggittoffer.com. For the avoidance of doubt, the contents of those websites are not incorporated into and do not form part of this announcement.\n\nMeggitt Shareholders may request a hard copy of this announcement by contacting Computershare during business hours on +44 (0) 370 ###-###-#### or by submitting a request in writing to Computershare Investor Services PLC at The Pavilions, Bridgwater, Bristol, BS99 6ZZ.
