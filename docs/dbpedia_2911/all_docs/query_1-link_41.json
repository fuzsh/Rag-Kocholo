This will include items related to advanced process control (APC), alarm sounds, and team training. Research on how APC degrades operator skills will be shown with implications for intervention techniques such as simulators or micro-learning. New sets of alarm sounds will be presented that facilitate identification of which console is generating the alarm. Enhanced training for operator-maintenance interactions based upon aerospace and military principles will be explained. Discover more at Emerson Exchange Immerse, Oct. 3-5.
