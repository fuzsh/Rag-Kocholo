        "text": "Furious workers at Meggitt Plc, the aerospace contractor and supplier to the UK Ministry of Defence which is the centre of a takeover approach from U.S. tech firm Parker-Hannifin Corp, have voted in support of industrial action, claiming the company offered them a free cup of tea instead of a proper pay rise.\n\nThe employees are angry after receiving a 3 per cent pay offer from the company, which they say amounts to a big pay cut in real terms (according to the Office for National Statistics, consumer price inflation in June rose to 9.4 per cent).\n\nAccording to the GMB union which represents more than 160 members of staff on the company’s payroll, bosses at Meggitt offered free cups of tea on Thursdays in a bid to sweeten the deal.\n\nStrike dates will be announced in the coming days.\n\nDavid Warwick, GMB Organiser, comments: “These are workers who gave up 10 per cent of their wages during the pandemic just to help the company out.\n\n“Now they’ve been hit with an insulting offer of a real terms pay cut. It’s not much of a thank you.\n\n“To add injury to insult, bosses tried to sweeten the deal with an offer of free cups of tea on a Thursday. Needless to say, that was roundly rejected.\n\n“Meggitt can still avoid costly industrial action, just get back in the room with GMB and make our members an offer that helps them keep their heads above water.”"
