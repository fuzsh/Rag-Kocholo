        "text": "Meggitt Defense Systems, provider of virtual and live fire weapons training technology, has changed its name to Meggitt Training Systems, announced company president Rich Haddad. Based in Suwanee, Ga., Meggitt Training Systems comprises a significant portion of Meggitt PLC, a multi-billion dollar international aerospace, defense, and electronics group.\n\nThe new name reflects the company's expertise in virtual and live fire weapons training, and is part of a comprehensive restructuring that has been in the works for several months, including centralizing operations in Georgia. Existing and new customers of Meggitt Training Systems will continue to experience improved customer service, sales, and support under the new structure.\n\nMeggitt Training Systems will continue to produce, market and sell the Fats and Caswell brands of virtual and live-fire weapons training solutions and serve customers in the military, law enforcement and security industries. The combination of solutions provides officers and soldiers with comprehensive training programs targeted to their individual needs.\n\nHaddad, who became president in October 2007, replaces Ron Mohling. With more than 10 years of executive experience, including the past three years as Vice President of Business Development at Meggitt Defense Systems, and nearly 10 years of active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps, Haddad is uniquely suited to his new role with Meggitt Training Systems.\n\nTasked with further unifying Meggitt Training Systems' operations and leading it into the future, Haddad welcomes the chance to build the new company's identity within the industry and beyond.\n\n\"Without a doubt, Meggitt Training Systems is well positioned to become the leading provider of virtual and live fire training systems in the U.S. and globally,\" said Haddad. \"Our new name represents the streamlined, straightforward approach the company will take in all aspects of our business. I look forward to building on the tradition the Fats and Caswell brands have established.\""
