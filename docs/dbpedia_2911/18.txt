Company Profile

Headquartered in the UK, Meggitt Plc is a global engineering group specialising in extreme environment components and smart sub-systems for aerospace, defence and energy markets.

Over 9,000 people are employed across manufacturing facilities in Asia, Europe and North America and regional bases in Brazil, India and the Middle East.

Meggitt’s civil aerospace presence covers large commercial transports, regional aircraft, business jets, helicopters and general aviation.

Its defence markets cover all military aircraft types, land systems, naval platforms and aerial, land-based and marine threat simulation training and weapons systems development. The firearms element of this capability extends into law enforcement and security organisations.

The group’s growing presence in energy is driven by our core fluid controls, heat management and sensing and monitoring capabilities, many of which are deployed to help reduce the maintenance costs, fuel consumption and carbon emissions of industrial gas and steam turbines.
