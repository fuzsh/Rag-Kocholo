You may have seen everything that happens in “West of Pluto” in countless other movies, but never quite the way it’s presented here. This snapshot of 24 hours in the life of a group of suburban Quebec teenagers deftly mixes documentary-like realism with an offbeat, indie-film vibe, resulting in an engaging and surprisingly involving dramedy.

Co-writer-directors Henry Bernadet and Myriam Verreault’s unique approach takes a bit of time to jell, but satisfies once the movie’s narrative intentions become clear.

Through its array of giddy, angst-ridden and pseudo-deep adolescents — played here by an ensemble of nonprofessional actors — the film succinctly captures the roller-coaster emotions of teens as they navigate friendship, romance, sex, drugs, partying, high school, parents, music and more.

These essentially bright, decent kids may be types (the outsider, the science geek, the virgin, the angry one) but never feel like stereotypes, thanks to the authentic performances, unforced dialogue and the filmmakers’ respectful, near-Hughesian take on their characters and subject.

The movie, much of which revolves around a house party gone awry, is effectively punctuated by amusing classroom show-and-tells, thematically linked factoids about the (former) planet Pluto and a series of visually creative transitions (love that tree-wrestling dog). Nice job.
