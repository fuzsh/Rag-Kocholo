        "text": "I love films, but pretty often what I love most about films or TV shows is their score or soundtrack and the way they use it. In 500 Days of Summer for example, my favourite moments come as a result of the frankly brilliant placings of Hall and Oates’ You Make My Dreams and Regina Spektor’s Hero. My favourite scene in Game of Thrones is where Cersei blows up the Sept because the music makes it so ominous and climatic. In these examples, the music complements the screenplay so well that I believe it makes the scene.\n\nSo that’s what this new series, “Score Makes a Scene” is.

If I don’t like an album, I’ll avoid it. Continue reading Announcement: Reviews\n\nMuse are one of the biggest rock bands of the 2000s. But they’re not just a rock band. In fact, the unique sound of Muse is the result of a group of influences from Rage Against the Machine to Rachmaninoff. This is the story of that sound.

Continue reading Catfish and the Bottlemen: The Balance – Review\n\nThe mix of metal and a symphony orchestra; it just works, and Metallica’s S&M Live album proved that. With the announcement that the heavy metal behemoths are set to play a one-off show on the 20th anniversary of the album, here are five tracks that made the adaptation great. Continue reading The five best tracks from Metallica’s S&M\n\nWith depth, power, and no shortage of great guitar riffs and solos, Aiden Hatfield’s debut EP sounds like something he has wanted to make for quite some time, which, in fact, it is.\n\nThe multi-talented instrumentalist has created something that reflects his own personality and experiences while sounding professional along the way. A great way to start his musical career. Continue reading Aiden Hatfield: Chapter One – EP Review"
