        "text": "My absolute favorite thing about the state of horror movies in 2024 is how many filmmakers are going real weird with it. Killers, vampires, ghosts, and especially zombies feel incredibly passé on their own. We need a little uncanny strangeness with our scares, and some existential dread. Yum yum yum, I eat it up. The most recent movie to fit this bill like a glove is Damian McCarthy’s Oddity, which has made the festival rounds and which I saw through Fantasia Fest 2024. Oddity is not lying; it’s a very weird movie, but the scares are plentiful, the imagery creepy, and the story strangely satisfying.\n\nMcCarthy’s previous film was Caveat, an intensely grimy little movie about a man who takes a job watching over a psychologically disturbed woman in an abandoned house on an isolated island. While that movie didn’t light the world on fire, it did provide some upsetting concepts and imagery that made me curious to see what he’d do next. Oddity takes much of what worked in Caveat and makes an altogether more approachable, “conventional” movie that lulls the viewer into thinking they know what’s going to happen. They might, but probably not.\n\nDani (Carolyn Bracken) moves into a very remote house in the Irish countryside with her husband Ted (Gwilym Lee), a doctor at the nearby mental asylum. One night while Ted is at work, a creepy stranger (Tadhg Murphy) knocks on the door and tells Dani that he saw someone, or something, enter the house and that she is in grave danger. Now this presents Dani with a predicament. Believe this man, or not. What she decided, and what actually happened is part of the movie’s fun, so I won’t spoil it.\n\nWe then cut to some time later, Dani is out of the picture, and Ted’s new girlfriend Yana (Caroline Menton) is about to move into the house, under duress. Arriving at just the wrong time is Dani’s vision-impaired twin sister Darcy (also Bracken) who plans to stay the weekend. It isn’t just an unwanted relative. Darcy, who owns a shop full of occult and folklore oddities, brings a human-sized wooden homunculus with which she plans to get to the bottom of what happened to her sister.\n\nOddity is one of those horror movies that refuses to adhere to any usual story conventions. It keeps you guessing all the way through, which in and of itself builds tension. The laws of the natural and supernatural bleed in interesting ways, keeping viewers on edge. I found so much to like about it, especially to do with the unique location. We go other places, but the majority of the action happens in the remote house. It’s beautiful and welcoming, but the lighting at night plus some large, shadowy areas make it sinister in the best way. Similarly, the mere presence of the weird homunculus, and Darcy’s other cursed objects, leaves us wondering when and how they’ll come into the story. When they do, it’s supremely satisfying.\n\nThis is a movie where you aren’t sure what you’re watching at times, or why, but everything comes together by the end. Not necessarily how you think it would, or maybe even should, but that’s literally in the name. Oddity is scary, mysterious, upsetting, and effecting and I had a big grin on my face when the credits rolled. Definitely worth your time."
