Think again.\n\nFor years there has been consensus about the merits of Britain’s ‘cult films’ — Peeping Tom, Witchfinder General, The Italian Job — but what of The Mark, Unearthly Stranger, The Strange Affair and The Squeeze? Revisionist critics wax lyrical over Get Carter and The Wicker Man, but what of Sitting Target, Quest for Love and The Black Panther? OFFBEAT redresses this imbalance by exploring Britain’s obscurities, curiosities and forgotten gems — from the buoyant leap in film production in the late fifties to the dying days of popular domestic cinema in the early eighties.\n\nFeaturing essays, interviews and in-depth reviews, OFFBEAT provides an exhaustive, enlightening and entertaining guide through a host of neglected cinematic trends and episodes, including:\n\nThe last great British B-movies\n\n‘Anti-swinging sixties’ films\n\nSexploitation — from Yellow Teddy Bears to Emmanuelle in Soho\n\nThe British rock ‘n roll movie\n\nCIA-funded British cartoons\n\nAsylums in British cinema\n\nThe Children’s Film Foundation\n\nThe demise of the short as supporting feature\n\nVal Guest, Sidney Hayers and the forgotten journeyman of British film\n\nSwashbucklers, crime thrillers and other non-horror Hammers\n\nNow updated with more than 150 pages of new reviews and essays, featuring:\n\nThe Beatles in Colour!\n\nThe History of the AA Certificate\n\nKen Russell’s 1980s Films\n\nIris Murdoch’s A Severed Head\n\nCurating Offbeat films in the Digital Age\n\nAnd much more!\n\nContributors:\n\nDarrell Buxton, Sam Dunn, Mark Goodall, Graeme Hobbs, Peter Hoskin, David Hyman, Martin Jones, David Kerekes, Sarah Morgan, Kim Newman, James Oliver, Gary Ramsay, David Slater, David Sutton, Andrew Syers, Phil Tonge, Julian Upton, Jennifer Wallis"
