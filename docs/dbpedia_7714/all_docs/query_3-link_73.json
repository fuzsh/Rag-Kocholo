        "text": "Udaipur- In a notable shift from traditional cinematic roles where women often served as mere complements to the hero or were confined to dance sequences, contemporary cinema, particularly recent OTT releases, is marking a transformative era. The spotlight is now firmly on women characters who take center stage, carrying the narrative on their shoulders. From bikers to bike mechanics, social media influencers to football commentators, these women are breaking free from stereotypical portrayals and embracing offbeat professions that were previously considered beyond their domain. These characters not only challenge societal norms but also reveal the strength and resilience of women, diverging from the stereotypical \"show dolls\" roles that prevailed until at least the last decade. This evolving representation underscores a positive stride towards more nuanced and empowering portrayals of women in the world of cinema.\n\n\"Dhak Dhak,\" a gripping Hindi road adventure drama directed by Tarun Dudeja, takes audiences on a journey with four diverse women on a road trip from Delhi to Ladakh. Led by social media vlogger Sky (Fatima Sana Shaikh), the quartet, which includes Mahi (Ratna Pathak Shah), a senior Sikh grandmother; Uzma (Dia Mirza), a middle-aged Muslim garage owner; and Manjari (Sanjana Sanghi), a young bride-to-be, challenges societal norms as they ride towards the highest motorable pass in the world, Khardung La. The film beautifully captures the essence of freedom and self-discovery as these women ride beyond the limits of their lives.\n\nThe Mooknayak had a conversation with Ritu Roongta, a homemaker residing in Kolkata, who expressed her enthusiasm for the recent film releases that she sees as a source of inspiration for today's independent women. Ritu believes that contemporary women have a plethora of career options and the courage to pursue their passions. These films, according to her, serve as a reflection of the changing dynamics and aspirations of women in society. \"My elder daughter chose a different career option; she aspired to become a writer, and she excelled at it. She already has a few books to her credit,\" Ritu says, noting that movies often reflect what is happening somewhere in society.\n\nAnamika Gupta, a chef based in Jodhpur, also shared her insights on the impact of movies, particularly those from the southern cinema, in portraying strong and empowered women. Anamika, an admirer of Nayanthara, expressed her admiration for the way Nayanthara portrayed the role of a chef in the film. She believes that cooking comes naturally to women, but the film \"Annapurni\" beautifully sheds light on the discrepancy between the ease with which women manage household chores and the challenges they face in establishing themselves as professionals in the culinary world.\n\nAnamika emphasized the societal perception that cooking is often regarded as a natural skill for women but is not necessarily acknowledged as a viable profession, particularly in comparison to the prevalent notion that cooking is a male-dominated field. The film, \"Annapurni,\" resonated with Anamika as it artfully addresses this disparity and showcases the journey of a woman striving to excel in a culinary career."
