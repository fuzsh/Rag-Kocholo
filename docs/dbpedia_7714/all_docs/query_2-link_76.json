        "text": "All this week, Indiewire will be rolling out our annual Summer Preview, including offerings that span genres, a close examination of various trends and special attention to all the new movies you need to get through a jam-packed summer movie-going season. Check back every day for a new look at the best the season has to offer, and clear your schedule, because we’re going to fill it right up.\n\nREAD MORE: Indiewire’s Complete 2016 Summer Movie Preview\n\n“Elstree 1976,” May 6\n\nThere’s a special subset of documentaries based on the premise of a group of people collectively revisiting an experience that, at the time, seemed insignificant. In the case of “Elstree 1976,” that group is a handful of actors and actresses who played minor roles in the original “Star Wars.” From the man in the Greedo suit to stormtroopers to Mos Eisley waitresses to X-Wing pilots to David Prowse himself, they each relate their moment in sci-fi lore to the life events that preceded it. For the career actors, it’s almost just as exciting to see them flit through other bits of 70s cinema (a Kubrick classic, “Superman” and “Rollerball” all make cameos as well). The behind-the-scenes “Star Wars” anecdotes are nice for enthusiasts, but the extra focus on the tension in the film’s greater fanverse make it an interesting look at a specific kind of fame. -Steve Greene\n\n“Dheepan,” May 6\n\nWith Cannes on the horizon, it’s an ideal time for last year’s Palme d’Or winner to take a trip through stateside theatres. Jacques Audiard’s window into Sri Lankan immigrants living in France features a pair of passionate performances at its center from Jesuthasan Antonythasan and Kalieaswari Srinivasan. Telling the story of a man and woman posing as husband and wife while trying to provide for the young girl who afforded them the opportunity to leave the country’s civil war, Audiard switches between the real and the metaphoric, pairing slow-motion shots of elephants with exteriors of Parisian apartment buildings that literally dwarf the subjects walking below. In its quieter moments, it’s a carefully crafted look at one man working to transcend his grief and the community he tries to help foster in a strange place. Repeated shots of falling objects hint at the impact to come, but watching the film float towards its climax is the biggest reward here. -SG\n\n“High-Rise,” May 13\n\n“High-Rise” crashes in a series of grisly encounters as the power structures fall to pieces, but it never ceases to deliver a series of wildly enjoyable sights and sounds. Ben Wheatley nicely contemporaries the material with a rock ‘n’ roll soundtrack (which includes the appropriate choice of ABBA’s “SOS,” among others) while allowing Ballard’s original dialogue to carry the ideas. Chief among them is the observation that the “High-Rise” ensemble has been “thriving like an advanced species in the neutral atmosphere,” a poetic concept that speaks to the heightened fantasy that carries the hectic narrative along. -Eric Kohn\n\n“The Lobster,” May 13\n\nMany people will call Yorgos Lanthimos a member of the “Greek Weird Wave,” and that’s because he makes ambitiously oft-kilter movies like “The Lobster.” Set in a future where society highly values relationships over everything else, this wicked slice of romantic satire centers around an architect (Colin Farrell) who checks into a hotel after his wife leaves him. Slowly but surely, Lanthimos builds the twisted world of his film with a dark sense of humor you’ll never forget. You see, the hotel is something of a dating service, and each resident has but 45 days to find a companion or else they’ll be transformed into an animal of their choosing. It’s a premise Lanthimos navigates with tonal twists and plenty of plot surprises. Make sure you have a reservation for this strange and wonderful indie. -Zack Sharf\n\n“Sunset Song,” May 13\n\nA new film from English auteur Terence Davies (“The Long Day Closes”) is always a cause for celebration, and that’s especially true of “Sunset Song,” the filmmaker’s long long-awaited passion project. Adapted from Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s 1932 novel of the same name and set in the years just before World War I, this beautifully bucolic melodrama stars Agyness Deyn (“Clash of the Titans”) as a Scottish farm girl who’s torn between the history of her homeland and the hope of a distant future. Gibbon and Davies are a match made in heaven, and Deyn — who’s had a tough go of transitioning from the fashion runway to the screen — delivers a breakout performance for the ages. -David Ehrlich\n\n“Presenting Princess Shaw,” May 27\n\nThere was never any doubt that “Catfish” was just the tip of the iceberg, both for Internet identity hoaxes or for the documentaries that would inevitably be made about them. Director Ido Haar stumbled upon another doozy with the wild story of Samantha Montgomery (a.k.a. Princess Shaw), a cash-strapped New Orleans woman who works as a caregiver for the elderly by day and performs original songs for her virtually ignored YouTube channel by night. But while Princess’ audience might be small, it only takes one listener to turn everything around…as she learned when a (very popular) artist on the other side of the planet began mixing her vocals into his viral music hits. Their story is too strange to be fiction, but Haar mines it for a number of compelling questions about identity and ownership in an age when everyone is connected. -DE\n\n“Chevalier,” May 27\n\nOver the course of “Chevalier,” friendships are indeed tested, gossip circulates and flaws are scrutinized, all within the confines of the boat. The minimalist setting fits a premise so tightly contained that it constantly threatens to become overly precocious. Instead, Athina Rachel Tsangari maintains an impressive grasp of each man’s oddball tendencies, yielding a fascinating — if occasionally meandering — study of competitive spirit. -EK\n\n“Swiss Army Man,” June 24 (NY/LA), July 1 (nationwide)\n\nThere has never been a plot point quite like [this] in the history of cinema, but that’s not the only outrageous gag offered up here; the Daniels use it as a starting point for the strangest buddy comedy ever made. Finding himself newly marooned in a forest, Hank drags Manny through the vacant brush, singing the occasional song — the bubbly a cappella soundtrack was written exclusively for the movie — while gradually figuring out ingenious ways to use Manny’s body as a resource. His Rube Goldberg-like inventiveness finds him ricocheting string from the body’s gullet to scrounge up cliffs and staying hydrated from the water that streams out from Manny’s mouth. Then somehow Manny gradually comes to life — at least, a little bit, twitching his cheeks just enough to communicate, though he shows no signs of knowing anything about the world. -EK\n\n“The Purge: Election Year,” July 1\n\nThe original “The Purge” was a curious case in contradictions. Despite the conventional home-intruder film that the original became, there was the intriguing (if unexplored) world-building promise of franchise fodder. Exploring how different areas of society would react to an anarchic idea of legalized crime for one night every year birthed “The Purge: Anarchy,” a generally better-regarded sequel that benefited greatly from planting Frank Grillo firmly at the center of the chaos. Now Grillo’s back again, giving a connective main character tissue through separate installments for the first time in the series. Throw in veteran character actors like Mykelti Williamson, Raymond J. Barry (no dystopian allegory is complete without an impromptu “Justified” Season 3 reunion!) and Elizabeth Mitchell and this could become an election year cash-in that’s actually close to tolerable. -SG\n\n“Our Little Sister,” July 8\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda (“Still Walking,” “After Life”) was once pegged as Japanese cinema’s true successor to the legendary Yasujiro Ozu. But while recent films like “I Wish” and “Like Father, Like Son” have found him narrowing in on the same domestic territory that Ozu excavated so well, they’ve also seen him embracing an unabashed sentimental streak that has more in common with Steven Spielberg than it does the man who coined the pillow shot. “Our Little Sister” is nothing if not a harmonious middle ground between those two reference points. The story of a 14-year-old girl who moves in with her three half-sisters after their father’s death, “Our Little Sister” is a gentle and episodic drama that observes an estranged group of women thawing into a family over the course of a calendar year. Slowly snowballing into an affecting portrait of home, it’s the perfect movie for a long summer afternoon when you want the world to slow down enough for you to savor it. -DE\n\n“Life, Animated,” July 8\n\nRoger Ross Williams’ crowdpleasing documentary boasts a true-life story that sounds both too fantastic and too fantastical to believe. The film follows the story of Owen Suskind, a young autistic man who unexpectedly finds his voice and a new way to communicate with his family through his love of animated Disney movies. Suskind’s story is unique, special and often unexpected, and Williams’ tender and clever treatment of the material is one of the most charmingly offbeat features hitting the big screen this summer. Let this one surprise you. -KE"
