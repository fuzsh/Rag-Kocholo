        "text": "üéâ Today, we‚Äôre celebrating Men's Health Week with a powerful call to action for our colleagues and patients: Know Your Numbers! In Ireland, too many men skip routine check-ups, ignore symptoms, or delay seeking medical help when they‚Äôre sick or in pain. But together, we can change that narrative. Pharmacists are at the frontline of men‚Äôs health, offering essential education and encouraging proactive health measures. At LloydsPharmacy, we‚Äôre committed to making a difference and making men's health matter and that's why today across our 80 pharmacies, we‚Äôre providing free blood pressure checks and expert advice for our patients. This simple step can lead to a lifetime of better health. It‚Äôs time to empower the men in your life‚Äîhusbands, partners, fathers, friends, brothers, and sons‚Äîto take control of their health. Let‚Äôs inspire them to know their numbers and to reach out to healthcare professionals with any concerns. Together, we can create a healthier future for all men. Let‚Äôs make every number count! üí™üíô #MensHealthMatters #KnowYourNumbers #MakeYourHealthMatter\n\nYou wouldn't really understand the joy in my heart! As the founder of Fides Health Advocates, LLC and Fides Healthcare Management and Consulting, LLC, I am incredibly proud of the work we do. Our mission extends beyond roles of patient navigators. We are a team that treats ALL of our clients like family, regardless of where they are on their health journey. One of the most rewarding aspects of our job at #FidesHealth is witnessing the change in patients who have been labeled as ‚Äú#noncompliant‚Äù or ‚Äú#badpatients.‚Äù Let me share the inspiring story of Ms. Jay, who touched our hearts: Ms. Jay came to us with multiple health issues, including diabetes and cancer. She had been struggling, feeling overwhelmed by her conditions and the weight of her diagnoses. We rolled up our sleeves and worked closely with Ms. Jay, not just as healthcare professionals but as compassionate allies. ‚ùóÔ∏èHere is the result of our work with Ms. Jay: ‚óè Reduced medication list ‚óè Improved hemoglobin A1c ‚óè Stronger patient-provider relationship ‚óè Inspiration and empowerment ‚óè Consistency in healthy food choices & physical activities üìçAt Fides, we don‚Äôt just navigate paperwork or appointments. We navigate lives. Our purpose is to empower individuals like Ms. Jay, helping them rewrite their health narratives. When we see smiles return, confidence grow, and lives transform, it fuels our passion. #HealthAdvocacy #PatientEmpowerment #HolisticHealth #Inspiration #HealthJourney #PurposeDriven #HealthAdvocates\n\nMyself, Shane Jerominski and Dr. Maurice Shaw have been sharing hard stories about techs/Pharmacists who have contemplated suic*dal actions due to workplace conditions. Those are the stories we get in our inboxes and that make us feel at times helpless. So when you see us fighting harder for better working conditions through either association or the Pharmacy Guild, it is not about us. It is not for personal gain. We are not here cashing like some crazy thoughts on the internet. We are doing this because we are too many lives at risks. So be part of the change. Be part of the fight against greet and profits focused values. Bled, Lannie D. , Shane Jerominski or Dr. Maurice Shaw can‚Äôt do it alone. Join your association or join us on the mission to unionize our profession at https://pharmacyguild.org/.\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dQdPfk-g The value in the pharmacies are the members of the pharmacy team who go over and beyond to take care of their patients and community. The system, including corporate and institutional management, as well as policy-makers, need to ensure the teams have the resources and support they need to take care of patients AND THEMSELVES. One loss of a team member in a situation like this is TOO much. Commit to the Pharmacist's Fundamental Responsibilities and Rights - https://lnkd.in/dvEzNKEc . Publicly demonstrate your concern and respect for the pharmacy team through public action. Fix what can be fixed now and commit to advocating for longer term solutions. Decision-makers, step-out and show through visible action! Our thoughts go out to Ashleigh and her family.\n\nReflections of a week being a patient. Generally, when you listen from someone that you are an interesting person, you feel it‚Äôs a compliment, something positive. Yeah, everything in life depends on the point of view. This week I heard from my GP that I became an interesting patient. It took me a while to internalize the comment and to understand there was something wrong and ‚Äúweird‚Äù with me. I arrive today on Friday exhausted of so many exams and appointments. It‚Äôs been a rollercoaster of emotions, with ups and downs, bad experiences, and good experiences. No, we still don‚Äôt have clarity of what is going on, but I am happy that I have a plan for the month and that I was invited to discuss and define my next steps with the different physicians I saw this week. I am a lucky person: I work at the Pharma industry, I can ask my colleagues for help to understand the system, to advise me, to connect with good professionals. I am a lucky person: I work with the patient community, who teaches me every day about the challenges of diagnosis, access to treatment, need for care, the importance of education, the need to be an advocate for myself. I am writing and sharing my own life here just to remind everyone that we are all patients (and caregivers). And, for us, who work in the health segment, we cannot forget how we feel while a patient, how we want to be treated, how much we want to be listed and included in the decisions related to our health. So, I take this week experience to reinforce my purpose to leverage the patient community voice in the whole healthcare system: from the development of a new drug, the barriers to have a fast and correct diagnosis, and access to a holistic treatment. #commitmenttopatientsandcaregivers #patientengagement #patientadvocacy #patientcommunity #patientvoice #nothingaboutUSwithoutUS\n\nI've got a little story to share with you, a recent experience that got me thinking, reflecting on my journey as a healthcare professional. It all started when I was feeling under the weather, you know, one of those days when everything seems a bit too much. I had some vomiting, and I knew I needed to rehydrate with ORS, but oh boy, actually drinking it was tougher than I thought! üò¨ But hey, this got me thinking, diving deep into my understanding of empathy. üí≠ As someone in healthcare, I understand the importance of treatment, but I realized there's more to it than just knowing the science. I still need to offer my treatment with grace, with love, and with patience...asking myself, \"How would I want to be treated?\" ü§î Because let's face it, sometimes the medical advice we give isn't exactly a walk in the park. ‚ù§Ô∏è Like telling someone they need to cut back on pastries or hit the gym more often ‚Äì not the most thrilling convo, right? üèãÔ∏è‚ôÇÔ∏è But here's the deal, guys. We the healthcare professionals gotta find that sweet spot, that middle ground where both patient and practitioner feel comfortable. You know those small concerns they have...tackle them. If they tell you they really don't like vegetables, look for ways they could incorporate them into meals maybe switching up recipes and not dismissing their concerns because you think their condition will force them to take the \"bitter herbs\"ü•¶‚ú® So, my fellow healthcare warriors, here's my challenge to you: Let's be gentle, let's be understanding, and let's make a real difference in our patients' lives. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about the treatment ‚Äì it's about the journey we take together. PS: Remember, a little empathy goes a long way. üòâ #HealthcareEmpathy #PatientCare #HealthAndWellness #EmpatheticMedicine #HealthcareJourney #CompassionateCare #WellnessWarriors #HealthAwareness #PatientExperience #EmpathyInHealthcare #MedicalCompassion #HolisticHealth #PatientFirst #CaringProfessionals #HealthcareChallenge"
