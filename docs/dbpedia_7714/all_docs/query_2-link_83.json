        "text": "— Right after last year’s Sundance Film Festival wrapped, the news broke that longtime festival director Geoff Gilmore would be stepping aside, to be replaced by John Cooper.\n\nEven though Sundance ’09 had been impressive - introducing viewers to year-long buzz generators Precious, An Education, Moon, In the Loop and The Cove - the departure of Gilmore was pitched as an overdue step away from the Sundance of parties, gift suites and star-studded premieres, and a step back to the original spirit of the festival.\n\nThis year, Sundance promotional materials sported images of roots overlaid with the word “Rebellion.” It was a direct admission that the festival had changed - a little bit like a pizza parlor hyping its new pies by admitting that its old product tasted like cardboard.\n\nActually though, Sundance ’10 wasn’t all that different from ’09, ’08 or any other year. The festival showcased a number of films that will arrive in nationwide general release sometime this year. The party invitations still outnumbered the screening invitations, and marketers still roamed the streets of Park City handing out free samples.\n\nMeanwhile, the festival program was lit-tered with typical “Sundance movies”: Low-budget comedy-dramas featuring familiar actors playing offbeat characters.\n\nFor the “Sundance movie” in its most frustrating form, audiences needed look no further than Jay and Mark Duplass’ Cyrus, starring John C. Reilly as an irresponsible middle-aged man-child who falls in love with a single mother and learns that her grown son (played by Jonah Hill) is just as useless as he is.\n\nAs the two men launch a series of passive-aggressive moves and countermoves against each other, Cyrus devolves from a witty, insightful story about arrested development into a washed-out version of a broad Hollywood comedy: like Step Brothers, but without the jokes. Like a lot of Sundance fare, Cyrus feels not just unfinished, butsmugly unfinished, as though to polish it would be to sell out.\n\nBut “Sundance movies” can be appealing in their shagginess, too. TV’s How I Met Your Mother star Josh Radnor made a light, likable and blessedly nonquirky filmmaking debut in happythankyoumoreplease - winner of the U.S. Dramatic Feature Audience Award - about a group of young New Yorkers working past their neuroses and learning to love.\n\nSundance favorite Nicole Holofcener returned with her latest comedy Please Give, starring Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt as married antique dealers struggling to live virtuous lives. Holofcenerhas such a gift for capturing small, relatable moments on film that she makes the whole idea of modest indie films - and a festival to celebrate them - seem worthwhile.\n\nCRIME IN THE OZARKS\n\nSundance is also known for serving up more potent genre fare, like writer-director Debra Granik’s U.S. Dramatic Feature Grand Jury Prize and Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award-winning adaptation of Daniel Woodrell’s novel Winter’s Bone.\n\nSet in the Missouri Ozarks, Winter’s Bone stars Jennifer Lawrence as a 17-year-old high school dropout who has a week to hunt down her methamphetamine-cooking deadbeat father or risk losing her family’s house and land. As the heroine knocks on doors up and down the mountain, Granik introduces the audience to a motley band of “bred and buttered” crooks, including a temperamental relative played by the always phenomenal John Hawkes, and a shrewish moll played by Dale Dickey. Winter’s Bone never missteps as a crime movie or as a story of isolated rural clans. It’s one of the best American noirs to come along in a good long while.\n\nAlmost as good? The Australian gangster picture Animal Kingdom, winner of the Grand Jury Prize for World Cinema Dramatic Feature. It is also about a teenager’s initiation into his family’s criminal branch. The hero (played by James Frecheville) is a bit of a blank, but his relatives are colorful, and first-time director David Michod conveys the danger of the Aussie underworld by setting it against the mundanity of suburbia.\n\nThis year’s Sundance wasalso a good one for horror/ suspense, thanks to two of the Midnight offerings. In Buried, Ryan Reynolds plays a truck driver who wakes up in a coffin, accompanied by a lighter and a cell phone. Director Rodrigo Cortes maintains interest over 90 minutes even though he’s limited to showing Reynolds’ face and whatever object he’s holding in his hands.\n\nAlso clever: Vincenzo Natali’s campy monster movie Splice, with Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley as mad hipster scientists who crossbreed animals and accidentally end up with a fast-growing, superpowered woman-thing.The movie could be scarier (and funnier), but its portrait of a young couple grappling with unplanned parenthood lingers in the mind far longer than most tongue-in-cheek splatter flicks.\n\nAs far as comedy goes, this year’s In The Loop spot was occupied by Four Lions, cowritten and directed by Britwit legend Chris Morris. FourLions follows a cell of hapless British-Islamist terrorists who bicker with each other over what to blow up. The movie is fearless in its satire, and as sad as it is funny.\n\nIt makes a good companion piece to The Taqwacores, an adaptation of Michael Muhammad Knight’s cult novel about a group of outcast Muslims who live in a punk rock commune in Buffalo, N.Y. Though amateurish at times, The Taqwacores depicts multiple subcultures with deadly accuracy, and mixes utopianism and pessimism in a way that doesn’t feel like a copout.\n\nBIRDS OF A FEATHER\n\nThis was a good year for movies that pair up neatly. Amir Bar-Lev followed up his excellent documentary My Kid Could Paint That with The Tillman Story, which shows how various politicians and cultural commentators have tried to simplify the complicated life and death of NFL-star-turned-soldier PatTillman.\n\nThe Tillman Story matches well with the U.S. Documentary Grand Jury Prize-winning Restrepo, with its nailbiting you-are-there Afghan combat footage. Journalists Sebastian Junger and filmmaker Tim Hetherington embedded with an Army unit in the treacherous Korengal Valley off and on for a year, and they document how life on the front lines becomes at once surreal and primal, and far removed from any specific political ideology.\n\nIf there was a dominant theme at this year’s Sundance, it wasn’t “Cinematic rebellion,” it was “Line up early,” as the festival seemed more crowded than usual. Even a ticket in hand didn’t guarantee entry to some of the hottest titles.\n\nBut stalwarts were rewarded with some terrific stories, told well. Those who could find a seat won’t soon forget Leon Gast’s documentary Smash His Camera, about legendary paparazzo Ron Gallelaand his 50 years of run-ins with celebrities.\n\nNor will they forget Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman’s edge-of-your-seat documentary Catfish, in which a trio of New York artists track down the truth behind one of their anonymous Facebook fans. These are viscerally exciting documentaries, dealing with how artists connect with their public, and why art matters in the first place.\n\nThe same can be said of one of the best documentaries at Sundance ’10: the surprise last-minute entry Exit Through the Gift Shop, directed by mysterious British graffiti artist Banksy. It starts as a wacky character study of a French videophile, becomes a survey of trends in modern art, and then expands into an explanation of what makes art good or bad, and why the buying public can’t always tell the difference.\n\nThroughout Sundance, attendees were inundated with posters and trailers urging us to go DIY (do-it-yourself), to be creative, to “Rebel!” Exit Through the Gift Shop was a refreshing relief from all that, offering an appropriately flippant response: “On second thought, don’t.” Noel Murray is a Conway-based critic and writer who regularly contributes to, among others, The Onion A.V.
