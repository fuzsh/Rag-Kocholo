        "text": "A gritty, mind-bending thriller about three young adults who find themselves in an impossible time labyrinth, where each morning they awaken to the same terrifying day as the preceding one. Starring Dustin Milligan, Amanda Crew and Richard de Klerk.\n\nMathieu (Samian) may be a brilliant and successful neurosurgeon, but his life is far from perfect. When his long-term prescription drug habit is exposed, and his wife discovers he’s been having an affair, Mathieu faces professional and personal consequences. His father’s sudden death prompts Mathieu’s return to the northern Anishinaabe community of his youth and the remote forest cabin where he goes to scatter his father’s ashes. But what begins as a respite from his chaotic life to a place he thought he’d left far behind becomes a battle with something far darker. Haunted by painful memories and hunted by the legendary Wendigo, Mathieu faces demons both figurative and literal.\n\nA rare French-language Indigenous genre film, L’inhumain is the directorial debut of Anishinaabe producer and writer Jason Brennan. It’s a thrilling and evocative parable about the dangers of feeding the monster inside.\n\nWhen young Leon (Hewlett) forms a bond with an anatomy doll he calls Pin, his father (O’Quinn) doesn’t give it much thought, seeing it as a typical childhood imaginary friend. But after both of Leon’s parents are killed in a car accident, his attachment grows into a dangerous level of fixation, and he begins to employ the doll in increasingly horrific ways. This incredible piece of psychological horror will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nA cult favourite among horror fans but currently out of print, we’re pleased to offer a rare chance to see Pin in honour of its 35th anniversary.\n\n“A cool, bloodless, well-made thriller with a taste for the quietly bizarre.” – Janet Maslin, The New York Times"
