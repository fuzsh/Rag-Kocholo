        "text": "Watch here: https://youtu.be/I67OD00VODY\n\nHi there, I'm offbeat kiki, cartoon reviewer, halloween enjoyer and fan of fantastical media. I was watching the Twilight movies recently, for science, when something occurred to me; magic is represented in many ways across our media, and it doesn't REALLY have a common definition or set of rules. So today for a change of pace I'd like to take a look at various movies and tv shows - some of which were suggested by my viewers on twitter - and how they define magic. What does our collective consciousness think magic would be if it were real? Let's find out.\n\nPlease note that we are not going to talk about real life witches wizards or magical practice due to the religious nature of the topic; I want to focus in specifically on fantasy visual media, and that means the books behind any movies or tv shows I mention will not be taken into account. We're also covering a lot of ground here, so if I get a fun fact about one of these pieces of media wrong, feel free to kindly correct me in the comments. We're here to learn and have fun.\n\nHarry Potter\n\nSo the default option I'm sure for a lot of people when thinking of magic is Harry Potter. A series that I grew up on, and despise the author of. Most millennials have seen Harry Potter, I'm not sure about Gen Z. If you're a zoomer let me know about that in the comments. But anyways magic in Harry Potter is a very mainstream depiction;\n\nSpell phrases seem to be based in or related to latin\n\nSpells are cast with wands\n\nSpells can do basically anything, from bring things to you, disarming other wand users, sending out a flare, killing people, controlling their bodies, unlocking locks, creating a light source, and repairing things. Even though Harry used like 5 spells for most of the series. [compilation of expelliarmus]\n\nWands are owned by specific magicians\n\nSpells are usually spoken out loud unless the magician is very powerful\n\nSpells (in the movie) have a visual representation, sometimes lightning, sometimes looking somewhat like a sonic boom, sometimes being glowing light\n\nSpells (in the movie) range from being silent to sounding like an explosion\n\nSo if we were to think of this as an experiment, I guess we could call this the control set of data, but really I think it's a pretty basic depiction of magic that doesn't stray too far from stereotypes. So let's keep this set of descriptors in mind as we examine other depictions.\n\nTwilight\n\nSomething you might not remember being in Twilight is magic, but one of the members of the Volturi has powers that seem magical to me, and the sound her magic makes is what inspired me to make this video. Here's what I could gather from Jane's magic, and the other vampires' special powers:\n\nJane's magic is quite loud and its sound persists for as long as it is being cast\n\nJane's magic does not require a wand or anything to be said out loud, but she does sometimes say 'pain' as she casts it.\n\nJane's magic is unique to her being\n\nJane's magic serves one purpose, which is to torture people\n\nJane's magic can be interrupted by Bella, whose special power is to create a forcefield of protection\n\nThe Twilight movies and books are not known for being incredibly consistent, so I guess it makes sense that the magic or special powers depicted in the series doesn't really have a concrete set of rules.\n\nWizards of Waverly Place\n\nIn the iconic Disney sitcom Wizards of Waverly Place, magic is a supernatural energy that can subvert the laws of nature to allow scientifically impossible things to occur. Places where magic is strong tend to be surreal and strange. People can cast magic by posessing powers or a magical object. A lot of training is required for witches and wizards to perform magic well. Magical creatures such as angels, fairies, elves and dragons exist.\n\nThere are two main types of magic; spellcasting and powers. Powerful magical beings can use spells to allow them to do whatever they wish fairly quickly. Creative magic users are more likely to be able to invent a new spell in a desperate situation. Alex Russo often makes up spells when a problem appears - however her brother Justin has to rely on books to cast spells.\n\nPowers are magical abilities that do not require spells to be used. Powers are rare in magical beings and can be contained in physical objects. Powers can be removed with spells and passed down through generations with creatures like Werewolves and Wizards. Creatures like Vampires and Werewolves can give their powers to humans with bites or scratches.\n\nMagic appears visually and gives off a glowing light, sparks, or orbs. According to the episode Alex's Spring Fling, water can sometimes make spells wear off. Plastic is supposedly impervious to magic; at one point plastic balls are used to block Justin's magic; however Max used magic to put a plastic bag on a trash can in the episode Alex Gives Up, so the rules there are unclear.\n\nStar Wars - every little thing she does is magic\n\nI am probably gonna get someone in the comments arguing that The Force is not magic, but I thought it would be fun to examine it since it is an otherworldly power posessed by few and yet is never referred to as magic.\n\nThe Force is described by Yoda as energy around all beings, binding them together - so it's not drawn out of nowhere.\n\nThe Force is typically controlled via hand movements.\n\nThe Force does not require speech\n\nThe Force allows users to push and pull other beings and objects in a certain direction. It seems like users can also shift matter with it, there are some scenes of characters using it to break things. They can also use it to move their bodies.\n\nPeople often say \"may the force be with you.\"\n\nThe Force is described as something that can be weak or strong in certain beings, and \"the will of the force\" is sometimes mentioned.\n\nThe Force has whooshing noises associated with it.\n\nCount Dooku of the Sith has the ability to shoot lightning out of his hands\n\nPalpatine has the lightning power\n\nYoda has the lightning power too!\n\nSeasoned Jedi can apparently block the force with lightsabers...\n\nForce ghosts can interact with the living\n\nLord of the Rings\n\nIn the Lord of the Rings, we mostly see Gandalf use magic. I'm not an expert on Tolkien lore, but it seems like magic in this universe is reserved for especially powerful beings.\n\nGandalf uses magic for fireworks\n\nWhen Gandalf gets angry, the room darkens\n\nGandalf vs. Saruman - they use magic to throw each other around\n\nGandalf escapes from Isengard by turning into a bird\n\nBlack speech scene - uses some type of incantation in a foreign language\n\nBut also speaks spells in English sometimes, like at the bridge of khazad dum\n\nBrandishes his staff at Theoden to control his body in some way\n\nHe seems to not need his staff in order to cast some spells\n\nAble to resist fire using his power\n\nSaruman's broken staff robs him of his power\n\nThere are other magical items, like the ring\n\nHocus Pocus\n\nTo me, Hocus Pocus feels like one of the more logistically inconsistent examples of magic use. Which is fine because it's just a campy Disney movie that people still watch every Halloween for some reason despite it being, uh... pretty boring. Don't come for me.\n\nHocus Pocus has three witch characters known as the Sanderson Sisters and a pretty stereotypical picture of magic. A circle of salt protects people from the effects of magic. The sisters cast spells and create potions from a book. There is a scene where they cast a spell together, and that involves an incantation they share and hand movements. In another scene, witch sister Sarah sings the 'garden of magic' song to hypnotize masses of children. The witches can fly - on brooms and other objects like a mop and a vaccuum, which begs the question: are those objects just a prop? Because they all start flying before they put the household cleaning tool underneath them. I have questions.\n\nThe Owl House\n\nI am new to the Owl House, but I think their depiction of magic is pretty creative and unique amongst the other pieces of media we're discussing in this video. Magic apparently comes from a sac attached to a witch's heart, and spells are brought forth using spell circles. There are spells for cages, fire, electricity, reviving a plant, and putting creatures to sleep among others.\n\nThe show's magic beings also make use of glyphs, which are drawn and then activated through touch of various kinds including tapping and jumping. Placing paper over a burning glyph can copy it. Glyphs are said to exist in nature, which we see when Luz discovers snowflakes in the shape of glyphs.\n\nEda can create a magical forcefield, and at the school, magic is used to seal off doors or hallways.\n\nSpellbook compilation\n\nmagic comes from a sac attached to a witch's heart. Spell circles must be created to bring forth spells. There are spells for cages, fire, electricity, bring a plant back to life, put creatures to sleep,\n\nAt hexside school, magic can be used to seal off doors and hallways.\n\nEda can create some type of magical forcefield spell.\n\nLuz draws a light glyph\n\nIncantation said by several characters animates the house instead of a doll.\n\nIncantation to share pain\n\nLuz Spell/Glyph Video\n\nGlyphs - drawing a glyph creates an orb of glowing magic - it rises into the sky and shows in the stars - snowflakes are in the shape of glyphs and Luz realizes that magic is everywhere in the nature of the island.\n\nJumping, tapping, touching a glyph activates it\n\nPlacing paper over a burning glyph copies it, makes a fireball\n\nI like to feature fellow creators in my videos when possible and Chillixion knows a lot more than me about the Owl House, so I'm gonna pass it over to him for a more in depth look at the subject.\n\nFullmetal Alchemist\n\nSo it's not your typical spellcasting, but in Fullmetal Alchemist there is a skill called alchemy. Alchemy is an ancient metaphysical science that involves changing matter by using natural energy. This act is known as Transmutation and happens in three steps:\n\nComprehension; or understanding the molecular composition of the material being transmuted\n\nDeconstruction; using energy to break down the material into a malleable state\n\nReconstruction; using energy to reform the material into a new shape\n\nSome alchemists transmute using water earth, fire and air, while others use salt, sulfur and mercury. I don't know too much about this anime past the references I see on twitter and having seen the pilot, but I thought it would be interesting to bring up an atypical depiction and include anime in the conversation.\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch\n\nIn the 1996 live action series Sabrina the Teenage Witch, the depiction of magic is more standard, it being a supernatural force used to override the laws of physics. There are lots of magical creatures, and objects can be imbued with magical properties. Magic is an inborn attribute and those who can use magic are called witches, and magic is inherited genetically.\n\nFor full witches, magical abilities reveal themselves in early childhood, and for mortal/witch hybrids, powers awaken at the age of sixteen.\n\nWitches have to train their magic skills, and before it is trained, magic manifests itself in emotionally strong moments and hand gestures. Sabrina once brought a dead frog back to life on accident.\n\nMost magic is performed with gestures, typically by pointing the index finger, although on rare occasions magic is performed without any visible movement. Spells typically are poetic in nature and are cast in the witch's native language, but some spells are spoken in an ancient language similar to Latin. Spells can be spoken by another being as long as the witch casts it with her gesture. Spells can be custom crafted but must be spoken very carefully since they will be taken literally.\n\nSome spells, like the one to turn back time, require multiple witches to be cast, and others may require a tool or ingredient such as cat hair or tears.\n\nSpells often appear as a group of twinkling magical particles.\n\nPractical Magic\n\nLastly, let's throw it back to the 1998 cult classic film Practical Magic, a story about generations of witches cursed to have the men they love be doomed to an untimely death. The two main characters are sisters Sally and Gillian, sent to live with their aunts who are practicing witches. Also just a side note that I love the fashion in this movie, especially everything Sandra Bullock wears.\n\nThe entire town knows that their family is witches and is afraid of them, which is different than the typical 'practicing in secret' story that we see in magical media.\n\nThe first spell we see cast by their aunts involves a book and a sacrificed bird. Shortly after, we see one of the young girls cast a spell involving saying phrases handwritten in a book and gathering flower petals which are sent into the sky.\n\nThe blood moon seems to have an effect on the witches, implied to maybe be bad luck, but it's not entirely clear. At one point the sisters very casually cast a blood oath that they will see each other again, and that blood pact is performed a second time to save Gillian's life when her dead boyfriend is haunting her.\n\nIn this film spells seem to generally be more long term and meant to change lives. Spells to make people fall in love or stay out of love. The family's curse includes a beetle's chirp warning the women of their husbands' impending deaths. However, magic can also be used to do simple things such as stirring a teacup. [28:50]\n\nThe aunts' book of spells possesses a wide array of capabilities, including necromancy. The aunts refuse to practice such magic, but the sisters do it anyway. Their resurrections spell requires both of them doing incantations, drawing a pentagram on his chest - which they used reddi whip for, and pointing some sort of needles at the body.\n\nThere's also a ghost, ghoul thing in this movie that's repelled by a police badge, so the logic isn't the most polished here. I don't think Police badges are holy objects. I watched this movie for the video and it's very wacky and unique, and I can easily see myself doing a full review and analysis come next spooky season.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo, we've reviewed ten different depictions of magic. What can we gather about our society's vision of magic based on these examples? To me, it seems like we imagine the sound of magic to be anything from deep whooshing to twinkling chimes. We think that magic's physical form usually looks like clouds of smoke and sparkles. Magic being cast is imagined in many different ways, from spellbooks to improv. Sometimes magic is limited to specific families, and sometimes it can be performed by anyone possessing a magic object.\n\nSo basically, magic can do anything. laugh It's kind of a deus ex machina situation. But it's interesting to see the different interpretations even if no conclusions can be drawn.\n\nThat's all I've got for you today. Thanks so much for watching! This video was different than my usual content but I had a lot of fun making it and I hope you enjoyed watching it, too. I wanted to put this out before halloween, but my Invader Zim video took up all my time, so if you haven't seen it yet please go check it out.\n\nWhat's your favorite magical media?
