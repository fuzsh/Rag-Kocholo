        "text": "This past year saw cinematic highs for studio blockbusters like “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” while indie darlings such as “American Fiction” and “Past Lives” found a warm reception from critics and audiences. But not all films can make a mark at the box office or find a passionate fanbase (or obsessed critic) to champion their releases.\n\nThe content onslaught often makes it hard to find the hidden gems, which is what end of the year lists are for — so Variety asked writers and editors to suggest their lesser-seen favorite films of the year. And while you’re desperately searching for new content, check out Nida Manzoor’s jaw-dropping, action flick “Polite Society” or the tear-inducing animated feature “Robot Dreams.”\n\nDo not sleep on the middle-of-nowhere Australian crime documentary “Last Stop Larrimah,” centered around the mysterious disappearance of the local favorite, thus making everyone a suspect. If you’re looking for a thriller, check out the screenshot flick “Missing” that takes place entirely from a teenager’s laptop and phone, as she tries to uncover the secret behind her mother’s sudden and unexplainable disappearance (from the creators of “Searching”).\n\nAnd if you’re looking for something a little lighter, we suggest Peter Dinklage, Anne Hathaway and Marisa Tomei’s strange little comedy “She Came to Me,” about a composer who finds inspiration for his next musical masterpiece while cheating on his wife with a tugboat captain.\n\nInstead of re-watching “West Wing” or mainlining “The Sopranos” yet again, check out these movies you may have missed."
