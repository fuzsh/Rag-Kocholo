        "text": "After eight years of nomadic Austin screenings, Hyperreal Film Club is at work on a clubhouse of their own. The home base, located at 301 Chicon, is expected to open around September.\n\nTanner Hadfield, Jenni Kaye, and David McMichael launched Hyperreal, a volunteer-run screening program specializing in cult, genre, arthouse, and independent films, in 2016. The club currently shows one to two movies a week at venues across town, including Hotel Vegas, which hosts the Monday night Hyperreal Hotel series. According to McMichael, the trio always envisioned opening their own space, but thought itâd be impossible. âBut weâre very optimistic and kind of stupid sometimes about what we can do or not,â he quips.\n\nBolstered by a 2019-launched reviews website and sizable Discord and Instagram followings, the trio pushes their limits with the brick-and-mortar, planting a flag for their ever-growing community to assemble.\n\nâUs being Hyperreal Film Club, we always wanted to lean into providing space for people to hang out before and after the screening,â Kaye says. âWeâve had so many folks say that theyâve met friends or filmmaking partners through Hyperreal, and we just want to keep fostering that club mentality.â In addition to showing movies, the buildingâs upstairs loft will host filmmaker meetups and other events.\n\nOnce open, the co-founders plan to increase their screening schedule to show films from Tuesday to Friday, with Friday as their marquee night of programming. To keep their repertoire âradically accessible,â McMichael says the group will charge $8 to $15 for tickets on a sliding-scale, pay-what-you-can basis – up from the current $5 to $10 rate.\n\nEven as it levels up, the club maintains a scrappy, crowdfunded ethos. Before wrapping their Hotel Vegas residency in June (and moving only a few blocks away), the cinephiles will host a May 30 going-away party at the venue that also launches a Kickstarter campaign for building costs. Kaye promises a hoedown theme for the event – âreally country and sluttyâ – and teases, âIâm really working on a mechanical bull, but no promises. Theyâre way more expensive than you would think.â\n\nZooming out to recognize volunteer efforts, the co-founders shout out the Hype Council, a group of 11 unpaid helpers who consistently assist with events, short films, and the online film journal. One volunteer scored chairs for the new building from a closing movie theatre in Lockhart, while friends are helping the organization set up electrical wirings. Because of their efforts, Kaye says, âWe want it to feel like people have ownership over the space.â\n\nâ[The community] is one of the very real reasons that this is possible,â McMichael adds. âWeâre all a team together that is building this thing.â"
