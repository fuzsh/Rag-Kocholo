        "text": "After writing an article about a reunion of the show’s cast, Waters was inspired to write a fictional story about Buddy Deane, set in 1960’s Baltimore, when the show aired. In every film Waters has made up to this point, he featured the actor Harris Milstead, better known by his stage name, Divine. After writing this new screenplay, he asked Divine to appear in the film, and for the first time, he would not have the starring role.\n\nIn the late 1990’s, producer Margo Lion rented the movie and felt like it was perfect for a musical adaptation. She called up John Waters, who was interested to see how Broadway would interpret his story. They both knew that screen to stage adaptations aren’t always successful, especially when the stage version tries too hard to be the film. Lion wanted to find a way to make a musical that could stand on its own, while still holding onto the heart and soul of the original.\n\nThe “Corny Collins Show” in Baltimore is having auditions, and despite being overweight, Tracy Turnblad has her heart set on becoming one of the stars! Using some dance moves she learned from a new friend, Seaweed, she is able to earn a spot in the show and become an overnight sensation. Her father even helps keep her in the spotlight by selling Tracy branded merchandise at his joke shop! As Tracy navigates her new position in the group, she strives to change the popular structure set in place by using her platform to integrate “The Corny Collins Show.”\n\nAdam Shankman has a personal connection to Hairspray. He knew the original songwriters, and was even around when they were writing the tunes for the Broadway show. He attended Hairspray’s opening night on Broadway as well. Because of this Shankman begged to be a part of the production, but was turned down. He was crushed. His agent convinced him to try again, and Shankman said he would only meet with the filmmakers if he was guaranteed to get it. Thankfully, the producers ultimately decided Shankman was perfect for the job.\n\nJohn Waters gave Shankman advice on how to direct the film. He told Collider about the exchange, saying that: “John Waters, when I first got the movie said, ‘I'm so excited for you, you’re such a fabulous choice for this.’ And I was like, ‘Thought bubble, question mark, what?’ And he said, ‘My only advice to you is you have to do your own thing; you can’t do what I did, don’t do what they did. This story only works if it’s told from a really personal perspective, so don’t try to – in this case, imitation will not be flattery for you, so just go for it.’”\n\nOnce the movie began taking shape investors were needed and the majority that helped fund the movie came from China. In order to draw in these investors (and audiences!) the studio needed a big name. They decided this big name would be John Travolta, the once crowned prince of movie musicals. Although he had not done a musical in 30 years, they knew he would draw the crowds. Travolta, famous for his long deliberations for roles, was hesitant and made the filmmakers wait over a year before making a decision. Travolta in a New York Times interview after being asked about his hesitation said that, “Playing a woman attracted me, playing a drag queen did not. The vaudeville idea of a man in a dress is a joke that works better onstage than it does on film, and I didn’t want any winking or camping. I didn’t want it to be ‘John Travolta plays Edna.’ That’s not interesting. It had to be something I could go all the way with, disappear in, like I did in the Bill Clinton role in ‘Primary Colors’ or in ‘Saturday Night Fever.” When he finally agreed to the part he had one condition, that Christopher Walken play Wilbur so that he was not the only known star in the film. He also wanted an Academy Award winner to play his husband."
