        "text": "We secured the rights to Hairspray at the end of 2015 for our annual school production. Previously we had produced shows such as All Shook Up, Spamalot, Wizard of Oz and Little Shop of Horrors. Of the three school productions I directed, I was most proud of our Hairspray. It was the production where I felt like we got closest to the alignment of school values and the text’s purpose as well as being proud of the quality of what we created on stage. Over the past few months, my personal learning and reflection has led me to reevaluate many of the decisions I made during this time.\n\nThe decision making process undertaken each year to determine which annual musical we staged was complex. A consistent production team existed for the eight years I was involved, and often the process meant a group of us in a room after school on a Friday shortlisting options sourced from our individual musical knowledge, student requests, and online lists. The criteria was diverse. The chosen musical needed to have potential for a large chorus (so not Avenue Q), a number of lead roles for all genders (not The Producers), achievable music for student participation (not West Side Story), appropriate for the school community (not Rocky Horror Picture Show) and achievable design (not The Lion King). Not to mention that a production we were going to spend six months living and breathing needed to be liked by the teachers and students involved (so not Cats).\n\nThere is a established cannon of productions that work in a school production environment. Rights holders like MTI and Origin Theatrical have online libraries to peruse. There is buried treasure out there (like when we found the little known but school stage ready All Shook Up) but most of the time we come back to the well trodden cannon based on availability and the potential cast we are catering to. If we have some strong male performers we might look at Guys and Dolls or Jesus Christ Superstar; if we have strong female performance we might look at Chicago or Beauty and the Beast. A particularly talented group might call for Les Miserables (school edition) or failing that we might come back to Wizard of Oz or Grease. There is a shared shorthand of what shows work in a school environment and the longer you spend involved in these conversations the more the cannon becomes a natural reference point.\n\nHairspray was the most popular student request. Unusually for a modern original musical the music was already ubiquitous and well known, and the student knowledge of the text was already thorough thanks to the 2007 film. It came available for schools in NZ in 2016 and we were one of the first NZ schools to gain the rights.\n\nIn the perusal documents, Hairspray’s creators make it clear that in order for a wide number of communities to see and perform the show that “colour blind casting” and “suspension of disbelief” could be employed. Our student body was diverse: 42% Pākehā, 12% Māori, 9% Pasifika and a very small percentage of African descent. We knew we could cast in a variety of different ways and direct and design the production to make the ethnicity of the characters clear. The production documents also included a letter to the audiences that could be used:\n\nOver the summer holidays I led a process with some of the key production personnel to unpack a vision for the production. We started by examining the heart of the show, and exploring its messages of diversity and acceptance. As the vision developed we applied it to designing the process and the production. This included following the guidance of the Hairspray’s creators with colour blind casting. I tried to challenge the team at this point with different scenarios and identify how our biases would impact this process. One change that came out of this process is we identified the issue with the white saviour narrative and underhandedly reallocated some lines in a key scene so that Little Inez would be the character encouraging her black family and friends to protest injustice, rather than the white character Tracy Turnblad. We unpacked our approach to gender and what a male actor in drag would mean for our community. We examined what our approach to the size of the characters would be (what does ‘plump’ mean in the script?) and how costuming would approach the use of padding. At this point our decisions were highly derivative of the direction given to us by the creators of Hairspray, but the thing that feels very uncomfortable as I remember this process is that the people in the room were all male and white.\n\nUltimately our lead cast was consistent with our previous productions where the majority were students of colour. Some ‘white’ characters were played by students who were Filipino, Indian, and Pasifika, and all the lead ‘black’ characters played by ethnic minorities. I foolishly called this colour blind casting, but there was obviously unacknowledged prejudices behind these decisions. Our diverse chorus were randomly split and the colour scheme of the costume used to show the race of the characters along with clear direction largely through blocking. Over the course of the production process I made an effort to use the opportunity of teaching civil rights history with our 90 strong cast. This involved a lecture component to the first rehearsal where no script was touched, and significant time in other rehearsals committed to sharing contextual information mainly with the leads. This extended beyond the cast as well, as social studies classes in Year 10 looked at civil rights in America as a special topic – many of their projects were displayed in the foyer during the production for audiences to engage in. Furthermore, when advertising in assembly students learnt about blackface and heard about the real history on which the musical is based:\n\nThe Buddy Deane Show was not integrated. This means that white performers did not feature at the same time as performers of colour. In fact, only once a fortnight did we see black performers in their exclusive segment. This reflects the time, 1962. In this time racial segregation was common across America:\n\nPublic spaces had signs like “no colored allowed”, these could be seen in parks, beaches, cafes\n\nMovie theatres and buses had separate spaces to sit\n\nThe NBA had only just begun allowing interracial teams a few years earlier, previously there was a white league and a black league\n\nIn several states interracial marriage was still illegal.\n\nThis is only 54 years ago.\n\nThe Buddy Deane Show, in its 5 year run on TV attempted integration, by having white and coloured performers dance together. But the show didn’t last long after this decision was made. It was cancelled by 1964 because the audience and sponsors fell away. The Civil Rights Movement was yet to really take off, and this effort to change the culture was unsuccessful.\n\nThis learning was positively responded to by the cast, and many made mention of this aspect of the production process in the post-show review. For the director’s note, I adapted the creator’s message and tried to capture the vision that we had approached the text:\n\nIn producing Hairspray, the production team faced the challenge of casting for roles written for particular racial identities. In consultation with the writers of the show, we went into auditions blind to colour. We looked instead at the characteristics of each performer and found the qualities of characters in students where their racial identity did not match what was written. As a result with have a Filipino Tracy, an Indian Penny, a Tokelauan Motormouth, and a very diverse chorus. The clues on the race of the characters are in the costume, the direction and the language. We want you as the audience to view our production of Hairspray within the culture and values of Newlands College which align with the play’s messages of acceptance and not judging a book by its cover. The annual musical is an opportunity to celebrate the diversity of our community, the range of talents in the student body and most importantly the joy of collaborating together in a fun-filled musical theatre performance!\n\nThe response from the community and audiences that saw our production were overwhelmingly positive. But, I now understand with the benefit of hindsight and personal growth that approaching the production this way was complicit with systematic racism.\n\nAbout a month after our production closed, an article was shared with me: ‘Race row erupts over Christchurch performance of musical Hairspray‘ written after a theatre critic rightly called out the lack of black actors in the cast. The professional production “cast actors of Maori, Korean, Polynesian, Filipino, African and one of European descent in the African American roles”. The comments below the article defending the casting are terrifying.\n\nIn the discussion that followed I was congratulated by colleagues for leading the production proactively so that we did not face controversy. I no longer accept that praise, because now I recognise that I was leading a process to help justify and make myself and everyone involved feel comfortable with our approach. Enabled by the creator’s capitalist approach to selling the rights to the musical, I had avoided the tough questions that would have been too uncomfortable to address.\n\nBlack characters should be played by black people. The practice of allowing white people to portray people of colour in art is whitewashing away the diversity that we too rarely see in our theatres. I had ensured we conveyed the key messages of the heart of the text, but in doing so I perpetuated the dangerous myth that black erasure is acceptable.\n\nEarlier this year, in response to the increased awareness of the black lives matter movement, the creators of Hairspray updated their guidance in the production materials. It now reads:\n\nThe authors’ artistic vision requires that, in order to clearly and appropriately tell that story, the cast members in the show accurately reflect the characters as written. As such, this Production Contract requires that the cast members in your production of Hairspray accurately reflect the character descriptions contained in the script…In the past, performance licenses for Hairspray did not include this provision. However, the authors have determined that expressly stating this requirement is an important component of ensuring that licensed productions of Hairspray accurately reflect the authors’ intent.\n\nThe guidance is the same for professional and school productions – as so it should be. School and amateur productions should be held to the same standard as professional productions. We have to teach and model appropriately. The consequences within school and outside of school are different, but racism is still racism whether it is a school or a professional production.\n\nI used the context and the importance of sharing the story and message of Hairspray to justify our production. Teaching students about civil rights in American through Hairspray was powerful, but would teaching students why it was not right for our student body to produce a production of Hairspray have been more powerful?\n\nColour blind casting is an act that is rooted in systemic racism. It is akin to the claims of “not seeing colour” or “we live in a post-racial society”. Another approach that is becoming more popular to employ is colour conscious casting. This we could have investigated, but claiming this approach with Hairspray would be disingenuous within the limitations of casting from a school body. Furthermore, colour conscious casting is not possible if the people doing the casting are all white.\n\nThere are plenty of musicals that exist where the race of the characters is not part of the story and these are much more appropriate for most school productions. Otherwise, unless it can be cast with students who reflect the race of the characters on the page, it isn’t an appropriate text to select. Because our lead roles were played by predominantly people of colour, our approach did not draw the questions that it should have.\n\nOn a related note, I question what content we are providing our talented Maori and Pasifika performers that are edging towards careers in the arts. Is playing Belle and Danny really the best experiences we can offer these students? How can we support the creation of content to meet the real needs of New Zealand school productions?\n\nI have worked alongside some outstanding colleagues in performing arts who are doing admirable work decolonising the curriculum and making changes to their practice. My fear is that this exceptional practice is not common practice. Who is calling out teachers like me that plow through their blind spots without question? I think there is a real need for a layer of support to exist that could help teachers like me who were responsible for so many important decisions to help make better ones. School productions are wonderful features of the cultural life of the school and have so many benefits for the institution and the individuals involved, but they are so reliant on the goodwill of a handful of teachers. Most schools do not have the resources to hire professional support. Is there a role for the arts community to help support these individuals that are stoking the fires of the next generation of artists?"
