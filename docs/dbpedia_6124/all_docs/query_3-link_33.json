        "text": "A reader writes:\n\nI work in higher education, and something happened to me at my last job that never sat right with me.\n\nI was hired at a large research university to work in a specialized program providing one-on-one support for students. I was a tutor, and all the tutors in my center had terminal degrees and many years experience teaching at the college level. The person who hired me was our boss at the tutoring center, Amelia. Other than her, we had no direct supervisor and sometimes went whole semesters without much communication from any other adult at the college. Literally, we only saw students on a regular basis.\n\nAmelia was someone I had considered a friend before we worked together. We weren’t close, but we have a mutual friend who we are both very close to, and Amelia and I had hung out socially four or five times before I was hired. This was all fine.\n\nHowever, three years after I was hired, my husband and I adopted a teenager from foster care. I let Amelia know because it was a huge life event for me and my position offered no maternity leave and limited sick time. Amelia had been in the foster care system and had a rough go of it (the foster care system in the U.S. is horrifying, and our adoption does not mean that my husband and I support its policies in any way). She told me outright that she couldn’t spend any more time with me because hearing about my adoption process or even just the fact of my daughter was too difficult for her. I respected that.\n\nAmelia didn’t just stay away from me outside of work, though. She basically abandoned the tutoring center, focusing on other aspects of her job so much so that the other tutors and I often didn’t see her for the entire academic year, and just turned to whoever if we had a question or needed something.\n\nI worked there for eight years, and only saw her maybe four more times in person in the last five years I was there — so maybe two hours total. Once or twice a difficulty between tutors arose and she would come in to try to sort it out, but without any context whatsoever. I got along well with almost every single person I worked with over the years, except for one tutor who stayed for less than a year and who I found very difficult to work with, and had an excellent relationship with faculty and the program director.\n\nWhen I asked for a reference after more than eight years, Amelia refused to give me one, saying I did not work well with others. The other tutors were shocked.\n\nI did move on and am in a position I’m happy with now, but I never really got over this. It was a huge blow after eight years; even though my Big Boss gave me a great recommendation it was just … hard and made me question a lot of things about myself.\n\nIs this a case in which I was discriminated against as a person from a protected class (a mother)? Or just a hard thing because I know what trauma does to people and I just feel bad for my boss? I don’t know.\n\nNo, this isn’t okay!\n\nLook, the foster system is a sickening mess (and I say that as someone who has fostered kids); it often makes kids’ situations worse, and very little about it is designed in their best interests. There’s a ton of data showing kids on the whole do worse in foster care than they would if they stayed with family. It’s deeply, deeply upsetting.\n\nBut Amelia can’t completely abandon a central function of her job because of that — ever, really, but especially not when she manages a team and her abdication will affect her employees in such significant ways. I’m sure she knew this at some level because presumably she didn’t go to her boss and say, “My employee’s adoption from foster care is so painful for me that I’m not going to interact with that team anymore” because presumably she knew that wouldn’t fly. She just … did it on her own, and that wasn’t okay. It wasn’t fair to you or the rest of your team, and it wasn’t fair to the organization that thought she was still doing the job they had hired her for. (I’d argue the organization shares some of the blame, too, since they apparently had no checks and balances that would alert them that this was happening, and apparently no one ever checked in on your team or thought to create communication channels that would ensure they’d hear about something like this happening.)\n\nAs for Amelia refusing to give you a reference and saying you didn’t work well with others … that’s awful. I suppose it’s possible you really didn’t work well with others — I have no way of knowing — but I don’t see how she could conclude that, since she completely stopped interacting with you and all the other feedback you got was positive. (And if there were any truth to it, it would be an indictment of her too, since it would have been her responsibility to address it with you as your manager and she didn’t.) It would be bad enough for Amelia to simply decline to be a reference — you shouldn’t lose out on a reference simply because your boss found your daughter’s adoption too painful, so that’s yet another way this situation was unfair and wrong — but to then tack on a made-up reason is really unjust. It would have been better — although still problematic — for her to simply decline.\n\nAs for the possibility of this being illegal discrimination: Parents aren’t a protected class at the federal level, although some states do have laws protecting parents from discrimination, and you might live in one. But rather than pursuing it from a legal angle, if you had written to me at the time I’d have suggested bringing the situation to someone over Amelia’s head, like her own boss. It’s pretty likely they would have intervened — although whether that would have resulted in a better situation for you or not depends on how skilled and involved that person was. Ideally they would have made it clear to Amelia that she couldn’t just go AWOL and talked to her about whether she felt she could still do the job or not … and then, if she did, ensured she returned to managing you and did it fairly and objectively. But if they weren’t a very skilled manager themselves, it might have just resulted in Amelia being more involved in ways that made your life worse, rather than better — present as required, but letting her feelings affect the way she managed you.\n\nUltimately, the two things you asked about at the end of your letter can both be true at once: we can feel empathy for Amelia because she went through something awful that she still carries with her, and she also treated you really unfairly. Those two things intertwine in complicated ways, but you’re on solid ground if you look at this and say, “This was wrong, and I deserved better.”"
