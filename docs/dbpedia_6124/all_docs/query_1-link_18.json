Although production of musicals was never confined just to Hollywood by any means, and the genre is still a thriving format in other national film industries like Bollywood in India, during the past several decades its obituary has been written again and again – at least within the context of the film industry in the United States. But anticipation of a big revival for the genre has also persisted in the US during the past decade. As early as 2003, Variety noted that ‘Hollywood has expressed excitement that the long-dormant musical is ready for a comeback’.1 Two years later, the trade paper repeated how a ‘comeback [has] been rumored since “Moulin Rouge” and “Chicago” ’.2 Baz Luhrmann’s glitzy and self-consciously campy Moulin Rouge! (2001) was that exception to the rule for contemporary Hollywood: a moderately expensive (about $50 million) original musical produced by a major US studio, Twentieth Century Fox, albeit made at the Fox Studios in Australia. Moulin Rouge! grossed $57 million in the US and, to almost everyone’s surprise, slightly more than twice that amount from international markets, including the UK, so its popularity was thought to signal renewed interest in the genre globally.3 Yet what followed Moulin Rouge! were mostly filmic adaptations of big Broadway and West End stage musicals, with Chicago (2002) leading the way after being in development for over two decades. Each time a new adaptation of a stage musical was released, the advance buzz prompted the kind of speculation about a comeback for the genre that Variety had noted in 2003 and again in 2005. Whether or not these adaptations have actually made an impact on the fortunes of the musical as far as the major studios and audiences are concerned is still uncertain. Chicago, which won many year-end awards, including the Academy Award for best picture, and Hairspray (2007), based on Broadway’s musicalised adaptation of John Waters’s 1988 movie, were critical and popular successes, with the former taking nearly $307 million worldwide and the latter, $202.5 million. Both Dreamgirls (2006) and Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), a rarity in being a transfer to the screen of a Stephen Sondheim work, repeated the degree of success that Moulin Rouge! had achieved at the decade’s opening. While not wowing mainstream audiences, Dreamgirls and Sweeney Todd received their share of devoted cult appreciation, some year-end award recognition and decent grosses (each took in about the same amount as Moulin Rouge! and, significantly, in the same two-to-one proportion of international gross to that of the US). At the other extreme, though, were several equally big flops which have not been forgotten. The highly anticipated film versions of The Phantom of the Opera (2004), The Producers (2005) and Rent (2005) were major critical and commercial disappointments, to put it gently. Their failures beclouded the genre’s future yet again, causing the producer of Hairspray, Craig Zadan, to admit as his film began production in 2006: ‘I’m optimistic about future musicals, but I think we’re now in treacherous territory. … I think inevitably there will be a backlash.’4 According to industry wisdom at that time, the\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n2\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 2\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nmagic bullet was to use movie stars instead of the original stage cast or unknowns with a stage background. This solution appeared to work well for Hairspray and Dreamgirls and then even more so for Mamma Mia! (2008). Earning nearly $610 million globally despite getting mostly negative reviews, Mamma Mia! was a hit in the US and even bigger elsewhere, breaking records in Britain. However, casting stars does not automatically guarantee box-office excitement. Nine (2009), the most recently released film musical, has a much-hyped all-star cast in another adaptation from Broadway; yet based on its very weak US opening and downbeat critical reception, it was pulled from cinemas prematurely and looks to be another of those big disappointments. Whether succeeding or failing, none of these high-profile musicals has resulted in anything resembling a genuine comeback for the genre, certainly nothing compared to what happened in the US in 1933 when 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933 did apparently bring a dormant genre back to life for audiences. Nor did Variety itself actually predict the movie musical’s return seven decades later. When reporting on that rumoured comeback in 2003 following the successes of Moulin Rouge! and Chicago, Variety went on to observe: ‘While some hope the two hit tuners will open the floodgates, so far it’s a trickle. In fact, with rare exceptions, studio toppers don’t even want to talk about musicals, as though not to tempt fate.’5 Several small musicals released by independent or ‘niche’ distributors – such as Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001), an adaptation of the Off-Broadway hit The Singing Detective (2003), inspired by Dennis Potter’s 1986 television series in the UK, and Camp (2003), an original about a summer musical theatre camp – did nothing to change this viewpoint. Variety’s cover story on the musical’s rumoured comeback in 2003 nonetheless makes for interesting reading. It offers insights worth summarising as an introduction to some of the issues organising this book: the genre’s formal flexibility and varied histories, its currency for popular culture and global popularity beyond America, its contemporary reiterations and innovations. Writing from a perspective firmly located within the globalised Hollywood entertainment industries, the article’s two authors, David Rooney and Jonathan Bing, carefully outline reasons why the time may be right for the genre’s revival and, equally so, for why present conditions may be working against the genre’s comeback. On the plus side of the balance sheet are these factors: the youth audience has been raised on music videos and is therefore ‘accustomed to seeing music and dance as part of a story-telling fashion’; the international success of Moulin Rogue! indicated that there is a global market for the genre (as Mamma Mia! went on to confirm in spades); new technologies like digital cameras and editing not only enable the ‘machine-gun editing’ associated with a ‘cutting-edge, MTV-style aesthetic’ but also have cut costs without fully sacrificing lavish production values; fans of musicals tend to be repeat viewers, making DVDs a ‘robust after-market’; and ‘tuners are a perfect fit for the soundtrack album, radio play and music vids’.6 Apart from referring to the musical’s commercial attractions in contemporary terms (e.g. the MTV-styled aesthetic of rapid editing), this list happens to describe much the same conditions that drove the genre during the ‘classic’ and ‘new’ Hollywood eras. After all, Busby Berkeley and Bob Fosse alike staged numbers using their own versions of rapid editing before anyone had thought of MTV; music videos have liberally borrowed from old musicals in order to incorporate song and dance into their storytelling; and the genre has a long history of exploiting new technologies and developing new filming and editing strategies. For that matter, the significance of ‘soundtrack album, radio play and music vids’ reaches back to a time when film musicals fed (and fed off) earlier versions of those ancillary markets such as the sales of sheet music and vinyl recordings, the promotion of the big bands and the crossover of the genre’s big stars to and from network radio. The extrafilmic commercial value of musicals went hand in hand with its appeal to young moviegoers, moreover.\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 3\n\n3\n\nThe studio-era musical preceded television as the major venue for developing new musical talent aimed at the youth demographic (teen performers like Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Deanna Durbin, Jane Powell). Today one may not think of Rooney and Garland, in their youth a very popular costarring team in MGM musicals, as the entertainment idols for teens of the Depression and World War II eras, but they were in many respects the Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears of their generation. ‘So what’s the holdup?’ Rooney and Bing ask Variety’s readers. They cite several negative factors beclouding a future for musicals. First, for an industry ‘dominated by flashy tentpoles aimed at teenage boys’, musicals are ‘deemed negligible’ by the studios, and this attitude perpetuates the ‘conventional wisdom’ that ‘guys would watch volleyball on TV before they’d see musicals for free’.7 Second, recalling their earlier point about the former centrality of musicals to popular music, Rooney and Bing wonder if there is even a need for ‘tuners’ given the vitality of what they call ‘hybrids’ as sources of profitable soundtrack CDs. They point to films like What’s Love Got to Do with It (1993) and 8 Mile (2002) which feature characters who are singers yet do not ‘substitute spontaneous song and dance for dialogue’.8 Related to these ‘hybrids’ are those films lacking any characters who sing and dance ‘naturally’ but which have a continuous musical soundtrack; ‘music is crucial’ to these films, Rooney and Bing comment, ‘but few would define them as musicals’ (yet they supply hit CDs too).9 Referring to the Broadway theatre’s function as a bankable source of material for contemporary film musicals, the writers go on to observe that it has been many decades since stage musicals ‘dominated pop culture’ with their tune-filled scores. After the introduction of long-playing records, cast albums often reached the top of Billboard charts and, at the same time, their scores generated hits for singers performing cover versions of the most popular songs. Furthermore, the long-running stage mega-hits have slowed down the traditional pipeline moving properties from stage to screen, since the blockbusters have a much longer life in New York City and London than in previous decades.10 Finally, Rooney and Bing remind readers of the earlier trail of ‘clunkers’, some made by high achievers like Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese, following the gigantic successes first of The Sound of Music (1965), then of Grease (1978). The chequered history of those past revivals does not augur well for the present, leading to the sad conclusion that ‘perhaps most crucially, Hollywood is painfully aware that few people have the knack for making musical films’.11 The one type of ‘hybrid’ that has repeatedly produced winners of late, the authors note, are the ‘toon tuners’, the Disney animated features such as The Little Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991).12 I think the Disney animated features could successfully carry the banner of the traditional film musical during the 1990s, because their painterly two-dimensional animation and fairy-tale worlds worked in concert to make it easier for adult audiences to overcome their resistance, indirectly noted in the Variety cover story, to a cinematic genre that unabashedly allows characters spontaneously to burst into song or dance. The genre’s detractors tend to blame the incredulity of someone breaking out into a musical number for their laughter and consequent sense of alienation as spectators, but I think that misstates their problem. One of the film musical’s distinctive – and to my mind most thrilling – formal conventions as a genre derives from the ease with which it creates a dual register, thereby breaking with the cinema’s dominant codes of realism as a means of securing the unity of time and space for a film’s fictive world or ‘diegesis’. Consider the ease with which, through a frame narrative as in The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the fantasy ballet in An American in Paris (1951), the genre moves from waking reality to dream worlds and back again.13 This convention creates multiple diegeses, and it is not limited to when characters have fantasies or dreams. From its beginnings, the genre has sustained a long tradition of building ‘a\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n4\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 4\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nshifting and volatile dialectic between integrative and nonintegrative elements’: that is, of placing story and spectacle together in varying degrees of tension and harmony.14 Governed by their own spatialtemporal logic, Busby Berkeley’s numbers disrupt the diegetic unity of his musicals’ backstage narratives, to be sure; but in their visualisation of ‘configurations that are feasible only with a movie camera, or an editing table, or in a special effects lab and that would be either impossible or incomprehensible on a theatrical stage’, his numbers imagine a truly cinematic space.15 A dual register further manifests itself every time a musical uses direct address in a number: that is, when performers ‘cheat out’, as it is also called, by facing the camera and hence the audience directly. This convention engages audiences with a double sense of being addressed: directly and extradiegetically by the performer in the manner of a live performance and, simultaneously, by the performer’s character expressing herself in musical terms within the diegesis. As Jane Feuer explains: Musicals are built upon a foundation of dual registers with the contrast between narrative and number defining musical comedy as a form. The dichotomous manner in which the story is told – now spoken, now sung – is a very different mode of presentation from the single thread of the usual Hollywood movie. The narrative with its third-person mode seems to present a primary level. But unlike other kinds of movies, a secondary level, presented in direct address and made up of singing and dancing, emerges from the primary level. The first-person interruption disturbs the equilibrium of the unitary flow of the narrative but, as we have seen, in an entirely conventional manner. Proof that the break into song does indeed exist at a different level of reality may be seen in the way present-day audiences (if out of tune with the conventions) may greet with nervous laughter any transition between modes in the classic musical films.16\n\nWhile it may seem ‘unrealistic’ and hence laughable for characters to break the single register and ‘unitary flow of the narrative’ by breaking out in song or dance, especially when there is also a full orchestral accompaniment on the soundtrack, singing and dancing are central to the musical’s ability to represent a heightened sensibility attuned to the lyricism, pathos or joy of music. In musicals, the cinematic can be contemplative or boisterous, romantic or ‘torchy’ in the feelings being performed, filmed and then edited without diminishing the medium’s kinetic ability to ‘move’ the spectator. This is why the genre gives pride of place to performing; great stars like Fred Astaire, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand can hold one’s attention on screen while singing or dancing, even if their voices are pre-recorded and the sounds of their tapping feet achieved in post-production. All of that probably goes without saying to anyone who knows and enjoys the genre. Or does it? Even famed Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim complains about musical numbers in a film, since he believes they find a comfortable home on a stage but work against the cinematic medium. As part of the publicity for the release of Sweeney Todd, Sondheim told The New York Times that he finds the film versions of his stage musicals unsatisfying, including the Academy Award-winning West Side Story (1961), considered by many to be one of the all-time great film musicals. In ‘West Side Story’ you see a gang dancing down a real New York Street in color-coordinated sneakers, and you just don’t believe it. And then there are the songs themselves. The problem is, what do you shoot in something like ‘Tonight’? You get a close-up of him, a close-up of her, a medium shot of the fire escape. It’s the same problem with so many of those other movies. The director has to fill out three or four minutes of what is essentially a static song, which holds your attention on the stage because that’s part of the theatrical convention. Whereas for me, as a movie buff, I want the action to move forward constantly, and\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPage 5\n\n5\n\nit doesn’t. They have little camera diversions and a trick here or there, but they’re just filming a stage musical, and that’s not for me.17\n\nI am not going to defend West Side Story, which I agree has its share of problems – starting with the casting of Richard Beymer as the male lead. Rather, what I find significant about Sondheim’s complaint, at least in the careful way that he phrases it, is his notion that ‘as a movie buff’ he can only conceive of cinema as constant, forward-moving action. That is why, he reiterates elsewhere in this set of interviews, ‘The only kind of movie I didn’t like as a kid were musicals.’18 And that is the principle, he goes on to explain, by which he cut down the score of Sweeney Todd for its filmic version. Numbers that worked well as quiet moments on stage were eliminated for being too ‘static’ if filmed; most of the others were shortened. Sondheim’s attitude toward film musicals – expressed, he says, from his viewpoint ‘as a movie buff’ – is symptomatic of a widespread and more commonly held prejudice against the genre that arises, it seems to me, out of a naive or at least unwarranted sense of fidelity to cinematic realism. Tommy Tune, who directed the original stage production of Nine in 1982, appears to share Sondheim’s bias in his recent appreciation of Rob Marshall’s 2009 film version: ‘Today’s screen characters, rooted in a certain reality, can’t just burst into song when the temperature of a scene demands it. That could turn a heartfelt moment into a joke in these cynical times.’19 This way of thinking maintains that musicals are, in effect, incompatible with the filmic medium as experienced today; so unless, as in the ‘hybrids’, singing and dancing are naturalised within the fictive world or, as in Marshall’s Chicago and Nine, are represented as fantasies occurring only within a character’s mind (thereby reunifying the dual register according to a psychologically ‘realistic’ explanation for the genre’s doubting Thomases), today’s audiences are expected just as a matter of course to find film musicals laughable for being out of sync with ‘these cynical times’. Given, on the one hand, the film musical’s history of having once been popular and appreciated precisely for exceeding the single register of classic realism and, on the other hand, the contemporary moviegoing audience’s supposed postmodern sophistication in being able to see right through cinematic illusionism, this makes for a paradoxical state of affairs indeed. It helps to explain why speculation about the musical’s comeback in the twenty-first century is typically phrased as an improbable possibility.\n\nBack to School So how do you solve a problem like the film musical within the context of today’s tastes in popular entertainment? Rooney and Bing’s comments about the conditions favouring a comeback of traditional (i.e. not ‘hybrid’) film musicals can help us see how it is now taking place: not in the form of all those splashy star-laden Broadway adaptations, but as more modest home-grown fare aimed at the youth market. I am talking about the Disney organisation’s High School Musical (shown on cable in 2006) and its sequels, High School Musical 2 (on cable in 2007) and High School Musical 3: Senior Year (released theatrically in 2008). For starters, consider some statistics about the HSM juggernaut. High School Musical premiered in the United States on the Disney Channel on 20 January 2006 to an audience of 7.7 million viewers, at that point ‘the biggest audience’ in the cable channel’s history’.20 By September of that year, it had been seen by 37 million viewers in the US, sold 2.3 million DVDs and 8 million copies of the soundtrack album, and ‘occupied pole position in the iTunes chart’.21 Exploiting the musical’s success, Disney spun it off as a sing-along version on the cable channel, a touring concert with almost the entire cast,\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n6\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 6\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nan ice show, video games, and more than a hundred tie-in and souvenir products. In a stroke of merchandising genius, moreover, the screenplay was quickly adapted for licensing to high schools as an amateur stage version – there were nearly two thousand such productions in 2007.22 Additionally, the musical was amazingly popular globally. Following a smash roll-out in Latin America and Australia, Disney gave the film a red-carpet Leicester Square European premiere in London, after which it was shown across Europe and Asia.23 Local promotional events outside the US also indicated the musical’s immediate currency with youth: in India, ‘an online competition dubbed “My School Rocks” ’ was repeated across Asia; in South America, where a Spanish-language version of the musical produced for that market was later released in 2008, a live TV show aired for ten weeks and was planned for Spain. The musical created what Variety termed a ‘global ripple effect’ with ‘more than 170 million viewers … worldwide’ and equally strong DVD and CD sales. All told, it was estimated that High School Musical, shot in Utah on a budget of slightly more than $4 million, generated $100 million for Disney in 2006/7 alone.24 With a $7 million budget, the 2007 sequel, expected to be ‘the Super Bowl of kidvid’, rocked the Disney Channel with even stronger numbers than the first High School Musical had delivered, premiering to a ‘cable record-busting 17.24 million viewers’. Since nearly a third of this number comprised adults (eighteen years or over) – a surprisingly high figure given the franchise’s perceived ‘tween’ appeal – it was assumed that not all the viewers who comprised that ‘over-age’ demographic were parents watching with their kids.25 Needless to say, the sequel did as well globally, breaking records in Australia, doing ‘boffo’ in the UK and setting ‘a new high-water viewership mark’ in Southeast Asia. A week after its US showing, High School Musical 2 was ‘seen by more than 44 million viewers worldwide’.26 In next to no time, a third entry in the franchise was in the works and, given the popularity of the first two, this one was released theatrically. Again, filmed entirely in Utah but this time on a somewhat larger budget of around $11 million, the more lavishly appointed High School Musical 3: Senior Year had an opening weekend in the US of $42 million, remained the number one film at the box office in its second weekend and repeated its success in a concurrent international release, ‘whipping teens and tweens into a full-blooded frenzy’, as Variety put it. In Britain, where the first and second instalments had been ‘endlessly repeated to big viewership’, cinemas took $2 million in advanced bookings three weeks before the official premiere of High School Musical 3, and merchandising for the third entry in the franchise was considered to be ‘red hot’ in that nation. In fact, the High School Musical calendar was already the biggest seller in the UK by then, ‘beating out the ever popular Manchester United Football Club brand’.27 Because of its presence on the Disney Channel and sizeable fanbase of young females at the cusp of adolescence, the High School Musical trilogy has been written off as innocuous fare with ‘no double-entendres, visionary artistry, or adult appeal’, as Rolling Stone described the first entry. ‘It is not even bubblegum enough to be enjoyable on an ironic level. It is plain vanilla, no sprinkles …’28 No doubt that may be the level on which the large adolescent female audience watches these musicals repeatedly on cable and DVD. And to be sure, High School Musical and its progeny are neither stylistic game-changers as, say, Fosse’s Cabaret (1972) and All That Jazz (1979) were for their generation or generic reboots as the cycle of post-1980s international art musicals analysed by Jane Feuer in this book proved to be for theirs. However, contempt for High School Musical as simply bland ‘kidvid’ fare misses its generic smartness, which is just as evident in the two sequels. As Kim Edwards observes,\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 7\n\n7\n\nthe charm and artistic merit of the original HSM movie lies in its ability to consider a sophisticated theatrical and musical heritage and consequently revise it for a modern audience … it simultaneously conforms to genre expectations and pays homage to its textual influences while taking a postmodern delight in exposing its own limitations and playing with some gentle pastiche of literary and cinematic predecessors.29\n\nUnderscoring its self-reflexive use of pastiche and allusion, the first High School Musical follows the genre’s conventions almost to the letter, indicating director Kenny Ortega’s and writer Peter Barsocchini’s knowingness of the heritage of the traditional Hollywood musical which they are updating for the present-day youth audience. With its Sharpay and Ryan inject Broadway razzle-dazzle basketball-star hero Troy Belton (Zac Efron) and into their audition number in High School ‘brainiac’ heroine Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Musical (2006), whereas Troy and Gabriella just sing, bringing the crowd to their feet Hudgens), High School Musical faithfully unfolds according to the dual-focus structure analysed by Rick Altman in The American Film Musical.30 Similarly, the trilogy of films follow the genre’s convention of contrasting authenticity and spontaneity, which confirm the amateur’s love of singing for singing’s sake, with manipulated and engineered artistry, which depends upon the professional’s wellrehearsed labour and derives from a profit motive (a ‘profit’ that here takes the form of scheming to procure the lead roles in the school musical as a means of acquiring more cultural capital within the highschool social system).31 In all three of the films comprising the series, Troy and Gabriella are glossed as the extremely talented amateurs whose singing expresses their honesty and artlessness. In the first High School Musical, Gabriella compares singing with Troy to feeling like ‘a cool other person inside you just came out’; her experience of such intense emotional transparency, she explains further, is because ‘singing with you felt like you didn’t have to be anything but yourself’. On the other hand, Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) and her twin brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), are just as talented but they want to overwhelm their audience with wellrehearsed, professionally arranged, razzle-dazzling performances that rely on engineered stagecraft and backup singers. When Troy asks Sharpay in High School Musical 2 if she would ‘ever try just singing without the lights and sets and backup people?’, she fails to comprehend the value of artlessness. ‘It’ll be harder to get applause that way,’ she replies. Accordingly, each High School Musical moves toward\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n8\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 8\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nits conclusion in more or less the same way: a penultimate number, set in contrast with a preceding (and overly extravagant) one by Sharpay, who almost managed to steal the spotlight from Gabriella, reunites Troy and Gabriella on stage in a simple performance of ‘just singing’; their duet engages the diegetic audience’s participation – everyone claps and sways to the music’s rhythm – as proof of these two performers’ authenticity. In the first High School Musical, musical theatre introduces Troy and Gabriella to a space of difference – the drama club – that challenges their otherwise conformist and rigidly hierarchical high-school world. It is here, I think, that this musical opens itself up to something more than a ‘vanilla’ reading. Performing does not, as in the dual-focus template of older musicals, reconcile the opposition of masculine priorities (jocks, sports) and feminine ones (brains, science) so much as reject that opposition in the interest of embracing one’s difference through musical theatre to achieve a much fuller, more truthful expression of identity and desire. The number ‘Stick to the Status Quo’, moreover, recognises the possible queer signification of this theme. With Troy having in effect ‘outed’ himself by publicly signing up to audition with Gabriella for the school musical, other students confess their secret desires through this song. Their revelations challenge the apparent equivalence of stereotypical gender and social identities, musically reconfiguring the groups of jocks, cheerleaders, brainiacs, skater dudes and drama geeks who are all seated at separate tables in the school cafeteria, hanging out with their own pack, when the number begins. ‘If Troy can tell his secret,’ his teammate Zeke (Chris Warren, Jr) declares, ‘I can tell mine: I bake.’ As the number progresses, the social divisions fall apart vocally and choreographically. The nonconformist implications of Zeke confesses he likes to bake in ‘Stick to the being drawn to musical theatre invest it (and, by Status Quo’ from High School Musical, and by implication, the film musical genre) with connotations the end of this number the status quo has come of a progressive, utopian and – in the sense that it undone enables an alternative to rigid heterosexualised gender roles – queer politics. Such a resonance to Troy’s refusal to stick to the status quo explains why, throughout the trilogy, he is characterised as loving musical theatre yet, as a jock, experiences conflict about his passion. In the third entry, he still finds himself in this position. Gabriella tells him to stop fighting it: ‘You love it,’ she reminds him. He agrees but asks, ‘Why is it so hard to admit?’ The utopian politics I am attributing to the High School Musical trilogy also explains director Ortega’s handling of the big finales. Contrary to generic expectations for a backstage musical, these do not occur on a stage but instead take place in the gymnasium following the big basketball win (in the first HSM), then a country club swimming pool (HSM2) and finally the athletic field after the graduation ceremonies (HSM3). On the one hand, these finales unambiguously celebrate the value of everyone ‘getting along’, articulating the ‘vanilla’ theme of the series as directed to its target audience: ‘We’re All in\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 9\n\n9\n\nThis Together’, the entire cast sings at the close of the first High School Musical. On the other hand, the finales move musical theatre from its bounded space on stage in order to revel in its more carnivalesque energies. By the time the first High School Musical reaches its finale, Troy and Gabriella’s friends, once antagonistic to musical theatre in the interest of winning sports and science competitions, have all been converted themselves and are now performing alongside the couple. When everyone exclaims in choral unison that they ‘are all in this together’, the indeterminate ‘this’ has a double reference: their social cohesion as a democratised community and their joy in communally singing and dancing on the gym floor. Indeed, there would be no unified high-school community to celebrate without musical theatre’s transcendence of the jock/ brainiac opposition, which the film heterosexualises as male/female. In picturing such unity, ‘We’re All in This Together’ choreographs a successful takeover of the school gym – formerly the normalising yet The finale of High School Musical: ‘We’re All in restrictive space occupied by the jocks and their This Together’ coach (who is also Troy’s father) – by the utopian force of musical theatre. The finale of High School Musical so successfully puts forward musical theatre as the fulfilling and more ‘authentic’ alternative to the gendered opposition of jocks and brainiacs that the two sequels really don’t have much new work to do of their own in developing the series narratively or thematically. Consequently, the sequels simply replay the first film’s conflicts by contriving to obstruct the couple’s path with new obstacles that, as exploited by Sharpay, threaten to keep Troy and Gabriella from performing together in a show and temporarily break up the musicalised community. What is more revealing about the series’ commercial value for Disney and its import for our thinking about the genre’s comeback in the twenty-first century is that, with their successively larger budgets, the sequels are more stacked with musical numbers, reminding us that plot is often of secondary consequence in a musical. Whereas the first High School Musical has eight numbers, counting reprises the second features thirteen and the third, seventeen. Each sequel, moreover, pays progressively greater attention to the over-the-top camp style of Sharpay’s numbers (such as her rendition of ‘Fabulous’ in HSM2 and her duet with Ryan, ‘I Want It All’, in HSM3). These are paradoxically (in another truism of the traditional musical) at once ‘inauthentic’ according to their over-theatricality within the diegesis and yet genuine camp crowd-pleasers for the extra-diegetic audience at home or in the cinema. Just as crucially, the sequels openly build up and play to the spectacular appeal of star Zac Efron, whose singing is mostly dubbed in the first HSM but not in the two sequels. By the time we reach High School Musical 3, I think it is not entirely amiss to surmise that the whole point of this film may be simply to enjoy the spectacle of Efron singing and dancing, not only with Vanessa Hudgens in their love songs and the full company in big production numbers, but also with co-star Corbin Bleu in\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n10\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 10\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\na Michael Jackson-styled dance duet in ‘The Boys Are Back’ (which could stand alone as a music video) and in his own dance solo ‘Scream’ – in both numbers, the visual attention is directed squarely on Efron’s body. In the two sequels, the many musical numbers do little to ‘move’ the formulaic narrative forward, yet their dominance indicates the filmmakers’ realisation that they were the reason why so many millions of viewers were drawn to the first High School Musical more than once. I will also hazard a guess that the numbers are what enabled the trilogy to cross cultures so easily and as instantly. High School Musical and its sequels make an illuminating point of departure for musing about the film musical’s future in this century, particularly in contrast with the more highprofile adaptations of Broadway and West End blockbusters. Disney has been the one Hollywood studio persistently interested in reviving the original film musical on more than a one-off basis. Aside from its longstanding commitment to producing (and profiting enormously from) animated musicals, years before High School Musical, the studio had tried but failed with original youthoriented musicals: Newsies (1992), directed by Ortega nearly fifteen years before he would go on to do the HSM trilogy, and Swing Kids (1993) did little business. For its ABC television network, Disney co-produced remakes of Cinderella (1997) and Annie (1999), but the return of the star-vehicle musical to TV, anticipated ever since the Bette Midler remake Zac Efron with Corbin Bleu in ‘The Boys Are Back’ and of Gypsy for CBS in 1993, never happened. dancing his angst about his post-high-school future in The significant factor in the film musical’s ‘Scream’, both from High School Musical 3: Senior Year ‘comeback’ with High School Musical in (2008) 2006, I believe, was the Disney Channel sponsorship. In addition to the first and second High School Musical, the cable channel presented three Cheetah Girl TV musicals (2003, 2006, 2008), and, at the same time that the High School Musical franchise moved to theatrical release with the ‘senior year’ entry in the series, the channel spun off to cinemas a concert (2008) and movie (2009) incarnation of its enormously popular Hannah Montana series (2006–present). Furthermore, the new cycle of teen dance ‘hybrids’ encouraged Disney to produce for\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 11\n\n11\n\ntheatres Step Up (2006), which then spun off two sequels of its own, Step Up 2: The Streets (2008) and Step Up 3D (2010). Supporting the production of musicals, the studio has synergistically developed a cohort of young performers (The Cheetah Girls, Miley Cyrus, the Jonas Brothers, some of the High School Musical cast members like Ashley Tisdale) for its Hollywood Records label as well as its cable channel, launching their careers ‘in order to keep costs low and enable it to eke out more profits per project’. With the balance sheet in mind, Disney has retained few of its marquee names once their initial contracts expired and salaries increased, preferring instead to continue developing new, inexpensive talent.32 Accordingly, a fourth entry in the HSM franchise currently in development will feature a new freshman class and new group of contract players. Comparable to the production of musicals by the MGM ‘dream factory’ during the studio era, the Mouse House of today may be the perfect Hollywood home for the production of original musicals like the three High School Musical films, which ‘have low negative costs, good grosses and a healthy afterlife’ on cable, DVD, CD, iTunes, touring shows and all the mechandising (video games, books, calendars, toys, etc.) that the target youth audience gobbles up, with everything produced by Disney itself or licensed in its name.33 Its ability to profit from a ‘home-grown’ musical on so many levels sets Disney apart from other contemporary studios, and may explain why the newest corporate incarnation of MGM, severely scaled down and nearly bankrupt, tried to replicate the Disney success in 2009 with a remake of its 1980 musical hit Fame but flopped big time. On the other hand, the success of High School Musical clearly paved the way for the TV series Glee (2009–present), which is co-produced by Twentieth Century Fox television for the Fox network in the US. Still midway through its first full season at the time of writing, Glee has already turned into a critical and ratings success, quickly generating a sizeable fanbase that includes well-known performers (some of whom have asked to do guest appearances on the show) and the musical theatre community.34 Glee has more satiric edge (and more ironic perversity) than High School Musical and its sequels, but it follows the Disney franchise’s template in its similar projection of a show setting – here, the high-school Glee Club called ‘New Directions’ – as the utopian alternative to and contestation of the more rigidly hierarchical and heterosexual structuring of ‘normality’ as otherwise upheld by high-school culture and as personified by jocks and cheerleaders. Glee appears to confirm that several important lessons have been learned from the success of Disney’s High School Musical trilogy. Let me elaborate upon three conclusions I draw from their popularity. First, like High School Musical, Glee has successfully connected with popular music tastes in ways that other musicals have failed to do; after each weekly episode, cover versions of the three or four songs performed – which range from musical theatre anthems to pop standards, rock, even some rap – have continually been big sellers on iTunes, and the series has already generated two CDs from its soundtrack while still only in mid-season. The musical genre has usually been thought of as a family attraction, a gloss left over from the roadshow era and exemplified by the gigantic success of The Sound of Music, but historically it has thrived on forging its connection with youth audiences through popular music, as typified by the ominipresence of the big bands in the 1940s and the introduction during the following decade of rock ’n’ roll music and teen idols from the record industry like Elvis Presley, Pat Boone and Fabian. The ‘hybrid’ teen dance musicals make this kind of connection with their soundtracks, too. Any viable comeback for the genre needs to revive this contact with popular music even if, as in the High School Musical trilogy, the songs are noticeably derivative or, as in Glee, are slick cover versions from the pop songbook. Second, television may well turn out to be a key ingredient in any future revival of the more traditionally styled film musical on a large scale, especially when the significance of the youth market is\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\n12\n\nPage 12\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nfactored in. In other words, Broadway-styled, star-studded entertainment aimed at the same demographic that attends theatre (i.e. upper-middle-class adults or tourists) may not be the secret either to the genre’s longevity or to its bankable future. I suspect that in today’s world of convergent electronic media home video – whether cablecast, streamed via the Internet or played back on DVD – will be crucial in grounding the exhibition of film musicals for a contemporary audience whose relation to the cinema multiplex is not their only means of accessing entertainment forms. From another perspective, too, while I doubt that the success of Glee will inspire the other networks to proliferate the genre as series television on a wide scale, through the course of a season comprising twenty-two or more episodes, a series like Glee can – much like the franchising of High School Musical via the Disney Channel – develop its inexpensive young cast into a repertory company. The institutional setting of a television network duplicates the role that the old Hollywood contract system once played in supplying and training creative talent (performers, music arrangers, choreographers, directors), and in building stars and a reliable fanbase for the genre. Third, High School Musical’s projection of musical theatre as a progressive and liberating space of heterosocial nonconformity was fundamental, I think, to the trilogy’s success in engaging its main ‘femme’ demographic of ‘tween’ to college-age women. While this segment of the moviegoing audience is not ordinarily well served by theatrical film, that group has consistently been diehard fans of new and old musicals, as I know from first-hand experience of teaching the genre for the past dozen years. The predominantly female audience of High School Musical 3, along with that of Disney’s Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour and the theatrical spin-off of Sex and the City, finally caused Hollywood to acknowledge the ‘femme’ demographic as more than a specialised market, making 2008 a sort of turning point in the studios’ thinking: ‘For the first time that anyone can remember’, Variety reported, ‘three femme-driven films … opened to No. 1 at the B.O., making it abundantly clear that fangirls are every bit as important as fanboys.’35 It is probably no coincidence that all three ‘femme’ hits were derived from television antecedents. Of course, time will tell whether Hollywood remembers this lesson or has to relearn it again in two or three years, as has happened many times before. In any event, Glee is following the ground paved by High School Musical in addressing that same demographic of ‘fangirls’ – and some ‘fanboys’, too, it appears – while making much more visible the cohort of gay and lesbian fans that have always supported the genre.\n\nThe Sound of Musicals Although central to any consideration of the musical’s comeback in the US, the adaptations of big stage hits and traditional youth musicals obviously do not delineate the full range of the genre as it is currently produced globally; nor do the generic conventions which the adaptations and youth musicals draw upon capture the film musical’s rich and varied formal history in its entirety. Reflecting further upon the genre’s global variety and its varied history, this collection of original essays exemplifies the robust interest which the film musical continues to stimulate in scholars as well as fans. Part One of this volume, ‘Genre Matters’, contains four essays which re-examine broadly based generic traditions that have previously been identified with the film musical’s history in the United States, Britain and India. In the first chapter, ‘From Homosocial to Heterosexual: The Musical’s Two Projects’, Rick Altman returns to his influential argument about the dual-focus template of the American film musical in order to explore the tension between homosocial and heterosexual currents within the form. In Chapter 2, ‘British Gaiety: Musical Cinema and the Theatrical Tradition in British\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 13\n\n13\n\nFilm’, Lawrence Napper traces the Gaiety stage tradition in British musicals from the 1930s to the 60s, a period bookended for his essay by Jessie Matthews in Evergreen (1934) and Cliff Richard in The Young Ones (1961). In Chapter 3, ‘The Mellifluous Illogics of the “Bollywood Musical” ’, Bhaskar Sarkar reconsiders, from the perspective of their formal uses and historical antecedents, the cultural significance of song-and-dance numbers in Indian popular cinema throughout that thriving industry’s own history. And in Chapter 4, ‘The International Art Musical: Defining and Periodising the Post-1980s Musical’, Jane Feuer explores a cycle of films that flourished at the end of the last century and that ‘almost’ seem like musicals – such as the Japanese Shall We Dance (1995) and the British Billy Elliot (2000) – in order to propose how and why this group forms a subgenre that may be more respectful of the musical’s long-standing traditions than the model perfected during the heyday of classic Hollywood. The rest of this collection is arranged chronologically according to the chapter’s topic. Part Two, ‘Histories of the Hollywood Musical’, returns to the classic-era musical but looks at it from fresh historical perspectives. In Chapter 5, ‘Flirting with Terpischore: Dance, Class and Entertainment in 1930s Film Musicals’, Adrienne L. McLean examines how the multiple styles of dance on view in early musicals were streamlined and made more uniform by the end of the decade, in large part due to the success of the Astaire–Rogers series. In Chapter 6, ‘Star Spangled Shows: History and Utopia in the Wartime Canteen Musical’, Steven Cohan looks at the seemingly ill-shapen all-star musical revues of World War II in order to examine their grounding of utopian spaces in stardom as a refraction of wartime labour issues. Karen McNally in Chapter 7, ‘Sailors and Kissing Bandits: The Challenging Spectacle of Frank Sinatra at MGM’, discusses the star’s problematic image in 1940s musicals when, still the idol of bobby-soxers, he was a contract player at the Culver City studio and not yet the iconic ‘swinging’ Sinatra of the late 1950s and 60s. The eighth chapter, ‘Bloody Mary Is the Girl I Love: US White Liberalism vs. Pacific Islander Subjectivity in South Pacific’, is Sean Griffin’s case study of the labour strife complicating and indirectly texturing the production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical when on location in Hawaii. This chapter also inaugurates a shift toward the big-budget musicals of the roadshow era. In Chapter 9, ‘The Singing Sixties: Rethinking the Julie Andrews Roadshow Musical’, Brett Farmer historicises the elements that made Andrews’s musicals so popular with women and so industrially significant for their era; while in Chapter 10, ‘The Streisand Musical’, Pamela Robertson Wojcik turns our attention to the other female performer who achieved major stardom with her first musical film in the 1960s, analysing how the genre was significantly reshaped to fit the unconventional star image of Barbra Streisand. Part Three, ‘Beyond Classic Hollywood’, concentrates on alternatives to the way the genre has usually been viewed through the output of classic Hollywood. In Chapter 11, ‘The Music and Musicality of Bollywood’, Anna Morcom analyses the 1975 Indian film Sholay in order to illustrate within the terms of a single narrative how songs and musicality work differently in Bollywood cinema – bigbudget, star-laden Hindi films – compared to its western counterpart. In Chapter 12, ‘Robert Altman and the New Hollywood Musical’, Gayle Sherwood Magee looks at an auteur director one rarely thinks of in conjunction with the genre, examining Altman’s three musicals in the aesthetic and industrial context of 1970s New Hollywood. Kevin John Bozelka in Chapter 13, ‘The Musical as Mode: Community Formation and Alternative Rock in Empire Records’, studies this ‘hybrid’ from 1995 with two objectives: to argue for the musical form’s modality and to historicise the role of alternative rock in this film’s reception, accounting for its theatrical failure and cult fandom on DVD a decade later. In Chapter 14, ‘ “A Musical Dressed up in a Different Way”: Urban Ireland and the Possible Spaces of John Carney’s\n\nCohan Introduction\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:07 pm\n\nPage 14\n\n14\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nOnce’, Matthew J. Fee looks closely at this critically acclaimed musical from 2006 in terms of its aesthetic adherence to the genre and its significance for the Irish film industry. Chapter 15, ‘Christophe Honoré’s Les Chansons d’amour and the Musical’s Queer-abilities’, finds David A. Gerstner analysing the queer affect of this 2007 French musical while also identifying its continuity with the earlier musicals of Jacques Demy. Finally, in Chapter 16, ‘ “Dozing Off During History”: Hairspray’s Iterations and the Gift of Black Music’, Matthew Tinkcom compares John Waters’s 1988 original Hairspray and the Adam Shankman 2007 film adaptation of the fully musicalised stage version, tracing their different erasures of civil rights history in their representations of dance. Tinkcom’s chapter emphatically reminds us, as do all of these essays, that while the film musical may be the most escapist of genres, it never escapes its placement in history. My summary of the sixteen essays comprising this collection indicates how The Sound of Musicals tries to avoid rounding up all the usual suspects in its discussion of the film musical. Some essays in this volume return to the classic Hollywood era but do so in order to reconsider its generic historicity and cultural valences; others widen that lens to encompass national film industries beyond the US; and still others examine the US film musical in its many post-studio era incarnations, exploring how it intersects with social history, stardom, auteurist practices, the art film, alternative music, queer theory and camp. Yet while it aims to reflect contemporary scholarly interest in the musical from differing methodological, historical and global perspectives, this collection also makes no claim to be comprehensive in its coverage. The contents of an anthology like this one are always dynamically shaped by the current research of the contributing scholars as well as by the editor’s own expertise and by the various time constraints that arise when publishing a book, so there will inevitably be some regrettable omissions. In this regard, I think of this volume as a report from the field, reflecting where scholars of the musical – many of whom are well known from their previous work on this enduring genre – are directing their energies at the present moment.\n\nNotes 1.

I argue that existing treatments of the musical are so attendant to endings and to synchronic analysis that the beginnings of musicals have been lost in the shuffle. What we discover by transferring our attention away from repeated conclusions and stable structures is altogether surprising, and of more than passing importance for our understanding of the cultural projects at work in the musical. Assumptions regarding the relative importance of endings, as compared to beginnings, are widespread. From Frank Kermode’s classic The Sense of an Ending to the Conclusion (‘Endgames and the Study of Plot’) of Peter Brooks’s Reading for the Plot, academic critics have made a cottage industry of writing about conclusions.1 Not unlike the importance of deathbed conversions in certain religious traditions, endings somehow seem more meaningful, more important, more … final than other textual segments. There is a sense that endings have the power to transform all that came before. In terms of textual analysis, the danger lies not so much in the power of an ending to transform a beginning or a middle, but in the ever-present possibility that beginnings and middles will be forgotten or misremembered, hidden as they tend to be in the shadow of the ending. It’s not that endings are unimportant, it’s that the ending orientation of virtually all plot-based analysis enforces a sort of back-formation whereby beginnings and middles are read through endings, thereby robbing them of any potential independent importance they might have. Musicals offer particularly strong incentives to attend to endings. Virtually every musical ends with a show-stopping number, designed to attract attention. Many musicals substantially expand this strategy, offering not one but a whole series of final numbers. The list includes such varied films as Footlight Parade (Bacon, 1933), The Gang’s All Here (Berkeley, 1943), Thousands Cheer (Sidney, 1943), The Band Wagon (Minnelli, 1953), The Glenn Miller Story (Mann, 1954) and Woodstock (Wadleigh, 1970). It is hardly surprising that illustrations of these and other comparable films often privilege finales. Of the two full-page illustrations that Bruce Babington and Peter William Evans dedicate to their chapter-long exemplary treatment of Easter Parade, one is predictably of the film’s final scene.2 A similar effect is produced by the freeze-frame two-shots that end so many musicals; because they encapsulate the plot’s conclusion, while providing a convenient image of both male and female stars, final freeze-frames often find their way into printed or video references to musicals. Academic analyses of musical films also regularly stress the film’s plot and the couple’s final clinch.3 In fact, even the growing group of critics who actively champion alternative approaches to the musical typically begin by recognising the importance of endings for our traditional understanding of the genre.4 Critical attention to musical endings is not the only reason why the opening sections of musicals have been so regularly disregarded. An important contributing factor in the neglect of musical beginnings lies in the tendency of recent critics to apply the semiotics-inspired techniques of synchronic analysis to musicals. The more synchronic our analyses, the less access we have to the kind of diachronic concerns that might concentrate attention on the early portions of musicals.\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n20\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 20\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nA quick glance in the mirror reminds me that I am in all probability the culprit most responsible for skewing attention toward musical endings. A recent rereading of my book on The American Film Musical 5 convinced me that the analytical strategies presented there, while illuminating certain questions and portions of the text, left others all too much in the shadows. For example, in reading Chapter 3, on ‘The Structure of the American Film Musical’, I noticed a repeated tendency to consider the notion of structure as purely synchronic in nature. Through the use of section headings like ‘Each separate part of the film recapitulates the film’s overall duality’, and ‘The basic sexual duality overlays a secondary dichotomy’, I was able to describe several essential structural features of the musical, but only to the extent that they fit comfortably into my overall dual-focus approach to the form. Recognising the musical’s repeated pairing of opposite-sex stars, dual-focus analysis allowed me to show how the members of the primary heterosexual couple regularly serve as the repository of paired but opposed cultural values, ultimately united through the couple’s eventual mating. For all practical purposes, this pattern sacrifices chronological considerations in favour of spatial pairings. With the exception of the final resolution, usually achieved through marriage of the principals, musicals are seen in this approach as stable and unchanging. While this analytical technique may offer substantial insight into each film’s synchronic system, it virtually forecloses access to diachronic analysis, especially with regard to earlier portions of the film. My suspicions regarding the potential danger of an approach that closes as many options as it opens were compounded by the memory of a passage from an earlier article in which I made some quite specific claims about the relative importance of beginnings and endings. In response to David Bordwell’s claim that ‘of one hundred randomly sampled Hollywood films, over sixty ended with a display of the united romantic couple … and many more could be said to end happily’, I blithely affirmed – as part of a general claim that Hollywood beginnings are retrofitted to a pre-existing ending, to which the beginnings must appear to lead – that ‘it is safe to assume that, outside of formal similarities, the beginnings of Hollywood films have no such common content’.6 On what basis I made this claim I have no idea. Instead of contesting the apparent tyranny of endings by careful analysis of beginnings, I simply assumed that there would be nothing to be gained by looking closely at beginnings, of musicals or of any other Hollywood genre. The kind of synchronic analysis championed by The American Film Musical treats musicals as structured by a simple and thus mnemonically satisfying pattern. Individual films are thus seen through the regular alternation between the heterosexual partners whose union constitutes the text’s conclusion. Because the text’s closure mechanisms are all triggered by processes involving the primary heterosexual couple, other textual aspects tend to be excluded. Analyses of individual texts may well focus on details other than the central romance, but overall assessments of the genre regularly return to the fundamental dual-focus framework constituted by the romantic couple who carry both plot and thematic content. Whatever else may be going on in individual musicals, this approach affirms, the genre as a whole is about heterosexual partnerships. Without abandoning this basic claim, would it be possible to discover additional things that the musical is ‘about’? In order to do so, it seems evident, we would have to begin by turning our backs on the standard synchronic, ending-oriented approach presented in The American Film Musical. Were we to follow this path, what would we find? MGM’s classic 1951 An American in Paris offers a useful test case. For traditional musical analysis, Vincente Minnelli’s film is quite obviously about the romance between Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron, two dancers who discover each other thanks to the magic that is Paris. But if we were to break the film down into its successive scenes, we would find that only a small\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 21\n\nF R O M H O M O S O C I A L T O H E T E R O S E X U A L : T H E M U S I C A L’ S T W O P R O J E C T S\n\n21\n\nIn An American in Paris (1951), Gene Kelly dances with one ‘wrong’ partner after another, from men to children and old ladies. This dance with Leslie Caron is one of the few times when the romantic leads actually dance together\n\nportion of the text is specifically dedicated to presentation of the Kelly/Caron romance. A substantial proportion of the film details Kelly’s involvement with an older woman who offers to bankroll his painting. Apparently interested in much more than her younger charge’s artistic skills, Nina Foch is however consistently presented as an inappropriate match for Kelly. Her age, financial situation and scheming personality are a poor match for Kelly’s youth, poverty and all-American naïveté. Paralleling the many scenes devoted to Kelly’s mismatch are a series of episodes in which French chansonnier Georges Guétary is presented as a possible – but equally inappropriate – partner for Leslie Caron. Older by far than Caron, Guétary consistently displays feelings for her that are more paternal than romantic. Much of the film is thus more about ‘wrong’ partners than Kelly and Caron as ‘right’ partners. A closer look at the film’s song-and-dance routines confirms the sense that the film is just as much about alternatives to a Kelly/Caron romance than it is about the apparently central couple. As Stephen Harvey has pointed out, An American in Paris is ‘the only important musical of the era with an all-male vocal score’.7 To be sure, Kelly and Caron do engage in a memorable dance sequence on the banks of the Seine. But they never sing together, and – as in many of his films – Kelly does far more dancing with others than with his eventual romantic match. An upbeat version of George and Ira Gershwin’s ‘By Strauss’ offers Kelly an opportunity to waltz with a woman more than twice his age. Later, he involves a group of Paris street urchins less than half his age in a delightful rendition of the Gershwins’\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n22\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 22\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\n‘I Got Rhythm’. Soon Kelly will be involved in a still odder pairing. In what might easily seem an unlikely duet, he dances around and on Oscar Levant’s piano, to the tune of ‘Tra La La’. Before long, Kelly will be singing ‘S’Wonderful’ as a duet with Georges Guétary. When An American in Paris is configured as a traditional dual-focus musical, stressing the courtship of a young couple, these parts of the film receive relatively little attention. When we make a point of concentrating on scenes in which the successful couple are absent, however, something quite different appears. By far the majority of the film seems populated by mismatches, by potential couples that are unacceptable for one reason or another. Waltzing grandma: too old. Nina Foch: wrong age, wrong interests. Street urchins: too young. Oscar Levant and Georges Guétary: wrong sex. Even the culminating ballet, which gives Kelly and Caron the opportunity to dance together in what should be a final consecration of their romance, overwhelms couple-oriented considerations with Minnelli’s over-the-top recreation of the Paris art scene in the first half of the twentieth century. When understood as a traditional musical, using the tools provided by The American Film Musical, An American in Paris is clearly just as much about Kelly and Caron as Gigi is about Louis Jourdan and Caron or Top Hat is about Astaire and Rogers. However, a second look offers a different version of the film. Quantitatively, An American in Paris is apparently more about wrong matches than about the one right match that is usually stressed. Taken individually, each event involving a wrong match seems inconsequential. Taken together, the overall pattern of presenting one potential wrong match after another takes on greater importance. The obvious question that we must ask is this. If we were to apply the same kind of analysis to the genre as a whole, stressing beginnings and diachronic analysis rather than endings and synchronic analysis, what would we find? Would an attempt to consciously avoid synchronic analysis generated by a known and generically stable ending lead to a new understanding of the genre? Or would we simply find ourselves back where we started, with the ‘wrong couple’ syndrome simply serving as yet another way to draw attention to the central couple? The Astaire/Rogers classic Top Hat (Sandrich, 1935) offers an appropriate starting point for an alternative analysis of the musical, just as attendant to beginnings and wrong matches as to the more obvious pairing of the principals. As a consummate Astaire/Rogers vehicle, Top Hat has understandably always been analysed through the primary couple’s interaction. Typically, my own treatment of Top Hat8 begins with Astaire awakening Rogers through his tapped rendition of ‘No Strings’. Indeed, in terms of the Astaire/Rogers relationship, this is where the film starts. But the whole point of this article is to discover whether something is going on in Astaire/Rogers films that is not wholly dependent on the relationship between Astaire and Rogers. So where does Top Hat actually start? What images and sounds does the beginning provide us as a key to the rest of the film? True, the credits do offer images of Astaire and Rogers whirling to Irving Berlin’s music. But that’s not where the film’s narrative begins. Instead, we are treated to a series of all-male scenes. First we watch (and listen) while Astaire is repeatedly shushed at the oh-so-stuffy Thackeray Club. As he waits for impresario Edward Everett Horton, Astaire is cast as a young noise-maker by repeatedly contrasting him with the silent and staid – even doddering – members of the Thackeray Club. As he leaves, Astaire taps out a loud wake-up call to his slumbering entourage, definitively distancing himself from the age and silence of his all-male neighbours and clubby surroundings. The following episode continues the all-male motif, but in a different venue. Now located in Edward Everett Horton’s hotel room, Astaire witnesses a delicious reconciliation scene between the effete Horton and his sassy butler Eric Blore. Like the film’s audience, Astaire is more amused than interested by Horton and Blore’s quibbles over how to tie a tie and other vestimentary essentials. These are\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 23\n\nF R O M H O M O S O C I A L T O H E T E R O S E X U A L : T H E M U S I C A L’ S T W O P R O J E C T S\n\n23\n\nFred meets Ginger in Top Hat (1935) – but not at the film’s very beginning. By this point, he has already found time for an all-male scene at the Thackeray Club and for a hotel room haberdashery discussion with impresario Edward Everett Horton and his butler Eric Blore\n\nclearly men who are more interested in haberdashery than in women. The scene that follows neatly demonstrates Astaire’s quite different preoccupations. Though his encounter with Rogers is initiated by pure chance – sleeping in the room beneath, she is awakened by his tap dancing – the heterosexual nature of Astaire’s interests is immediately demonstrated both by his dialogue with Rogers and by the bit of dance business that has him catching and cradling in his arms the statue of a woman. Later segments of the film will repeat this motif. Astaire is regularly paired with a man – including a whole male chorus in ‘Top Hat, White Tie and Tails’ – only to leave all male partners behind in favour of a romance with Rogers. Rogers mirrors Astaire’s repeated pairing with a soon-to-be-abandoned partner. When she arrives in Venice, she is at first presented in the company of Horton’s wife (Helen Broderick). Later, Rogers will be followed around like a puppy by her prissy clothes designer Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes). Whenever Astaire or Rogers appears without the other, the film tends to be structured around the presentation of an inappropriate partner. As with Horton and Blore’s fascination with apparel, Rhodes’s effete attention to accoutrements and style makes him unacceptable as a partner for Rogers. The obvious way to read Top Hat is the traditional approach through the central couple. After all, Top Hat isn’t called ‘an Astaire/Rogers film’ for nothing. In one sense, the film is clearly built on alternation\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n24\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 24\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nand parallelism between Astaire and Rogers. Seen this way, every part of the film prepares and/or celebrates the union of the two principals. Yet if we look closely at the details of the film, we find something else going on. In addition to close attention to the ‘right’ couple – Astaire and Rogers – there would appear to be a studied attempt to define the nature of couples judged ‘wrong’ within the film’s dynamic. The members of the Thackeray Club are not a good match for Astaire because of their age and prejudice against noise (a situation partially remedied by a later change of attitude, marked by their attendance at Astaire’s stage show). The odd couple of Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore offers another unacceptable coupling choice – homosocial rather than heterosexual and overly attendant to vestimentary details. Eventually, we will witness the ultimate odd pairing: Horton and Astaire will (by this point, somewhat predictably) share the bridal suite. Rogers’s potential partners confirm the pattern established with Astaire. Neither a same-sex partner nor a man more interested in clothing design than in women will do. Viewed in this manner, the Astaire/Rogers couple seems almost like an add-on to Top Hat’s implicit discourse on proper partnerships. While Astaire and Rogers are clearly the ‘right’ match, they are only one of several matches considered (and, in all but this one case, clearly discarded) by the film. In suggesting that critical attention to the central couple has kept us from perceiving other important aspects of the musical, I am of course criticising the central argument of my own study on The American Film Musical. However useful my dual-focus approach may have been a quarter-century ago, what is now needed is something different. As a complement to the dual-focus strategies presented in The American Film Musical, I thus propose two new hypotheses. The first is conservative and easily demonstrated. The second is both more radical and more speculative in nature. Hypothesis number one: far from safely assuming that the beginnings of musicals have little in common, I suggest that the diachronic aspect of musicals is regularly characterised by a progression from presentation of a series of ‘wrong’ couples – typically including same-sex matches – to establishment of one or more ‘right’ couples. While musicals may be oblivious to the kind of psychological causality usually associated with classical Hollywood narrative, a substantial amount of development clearly takes place in most of them. As is common with dual-focus texts in general – a topic treated at length in my recent A Theory of Narrative9 – change in the musical takes place not through a traditional causal chain, but through a sequence of redefinitions or replacements, in this case eventually supplanting several wrong matches with the right one. Textual structures based on sequential presentation of a series of wrong couples followed by eventual exemplification of proper coupling are of course hardly unusual in the history of cinema – or of western literature, for that matter. From Greek ‘new’ comedy to British Restoration comedy and from classical French comedy to American screwball comedy, comic genres have often been built around the correction of romantic mismatches. Whether the mismatched partner is the wrong generation (as in Molière’s The Miser), lacking a sense of humour (as in Frank Capra’s It Happened One Night or Howard Hawks’s His Girl Friday) or the wrong kind of dancer (as in Charles Walters’s Easter Parade), the pattern varies little. In order to better define the ‘right’ type of couple, it is necessary to provide several contrasting examples of ‘wrong’ couples. In one sense, the successive presentation of unacceptable matches might be understood as an entirely normal aspect of the dual-focus process whereby concentration on the central couple is maintained or at least implied even when both members of the couple are absent. Seen in this manner, ‘wrong’ couples are interpreted as nothing more than an episode in the musical’s main project of championing the marriage of properly matched partners. The conservative nature of my first hypothesis is amply revealed by the ease with which attention to wrong couples can be interpreted as part of an entirely standard focus on the main couple.\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 25\n\nF R O M H O M O S O C I A L T O H E T E R O S E X U A L : T H E M U S I C A L’ S T W O P R O J E C T S\n\n25\n\nA second hypothesis goes quite a bit farther. Instead of understanding musical beginnings as an integral part of the standard dual-focus structure, this second hypothesis suggests that there may be a quite specific second project operative in the musical genre. In addition to the musical’s primary heterosexual project, which builds its structures and values around the romantic coupling of carefully paired opposite-sex partners, I propose that we recognise in the musical the operation of a carefully targeted homosocial project. When we look closely at the beginnings of musical films, we consistently find that at least one of the young lovers is initially presented in the company of one or more samesex friends. In Lubitsch’s Love Parade (1929), Maurice Chevalier is first presented in the company of his male servant and his male … dog. Broadway Melody (Beaumont, 1929) is built around the same-sex couple of Bessie Love and Anita Page. In Gold Diggers of 1933 (LeRoy, 1933), Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Aline MacMahon share an apartment. Broadway Melody of 1940 (Taurog, 1940) provides Fred Astaire with George Murphy as a constant companion. Before considering heterosexual partners, Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell are matched to each other in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (Hawks, 1953). Guys and Dolls (Mankiewicz, 1955) gives Marlon Brando an entire gang of male cronies. West Side Story (Robbins and Wise, 1961) works similarly. My Fair Lady (Cukor, 1964) matches Rex Harrison’s Henry Higgins with his friend Pickering (Wilfrid Hyde-White). As noted by Steven Cohan, virtually every film featuring Gene Kelly begins with a same-sex pair10 ing. Throughout substantial portions of Anchors Aweigh (Sidney, 1945), Take Me Out to the Ball Game (Berkeley, 1949) and On the Town (Kelly and Donen, 1949), Kelly is practically inseparable from Frank Sinatra, with Jules Munshin rounding out the trio in the latter film. Phil Silvers joins Kelly in Cover Girl (Vidor, 1944) and Summer Stock (Walters, 1950). Singin’ in the Rain (Kelly and Donen, 1952) provides Donald O’Connor as Kelly’s primary male companion. Brigadoon (Minnelli, 1954) pairs Kelly with Van Johnson. In It’s Always Fair Weather (Kelly and Donen, 1955), Kelly is partnered by Dan Dailey and Michael Kidd. Military musicals regularly offer a full company of compadres, as in Flirtation Walk (Borzage, 1934) and Shipmates Forever (Borzage, 1935). Serving as an appropriate theme song for these films is Nelson Eddy’s hearty rendition of ‘Give Me Some Men Who Are Stouthearted Men’ near the start of New Moon (Leonard, 1940). From Roberta (Seiter, 1935) to The Glenn Miller Story, musicals built around a band provide a ready-made male chorus for the central bandleader. Whether male or female, musical stars sometimes find homosocial society in the workplace, from The Harvey Girls (Sidney, 1946) to Pajama Game (Donen and Abbott, 1957). Often, it is a family that provides the same-sex matches, as in Meet Me in St Louis (Minnelli, 1944) and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (Donen, 1954). It would certainly appear that I was wrong – at least in the case of the musical – to claim that the beginnings of Hollywood films do not share the same level of commonality as endings. An extraordinary proportion of musicals commence not with the heterosexual couple that occupies the text’s later portions, but with one or more homosocial pairs. Just what is going on in these films? Why, when we concentrate on musical beginnings, do we see something so different from what we find when we attend to musical endings? Grease, Randall Kleiser’s 1978 portrait of high-school life, offers a particularly clear explanation of the stakes involved in the musical’s investment in homosocial relationships. From the outset, Grease presents its characters in unisex groups. The opening number (‘Summer Nights’) splits Rydell High into two separate worlds, with the Pink Ladies serving as a chorus for Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) and the Thunderbirds backing up Danny (John Travolta). By attributing the same lyrics alternately to the two groups (‘Tell Me More … Those Summer Nights’), the film forces us to compare men and women as separate entities. When Danny discovers that Sandy – the object of his\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n26\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 26\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nFrom the very start of Grease (1978), the guys hang out with the guys and the gals hang with other gals. Here, the guys sing their part of the opening song, ‘Summer Nights’\n\nsummer affections – has unexpectedly not left town, he at first reveals romantic emotions, apparently ready to bridge the gender gap, but the presence of his buddies soon forces him to adopt an entirely different approach. As Sonny (Michael Tucci) tellingly puts it a few minutes later, at the point where Kenickie (Jeff Conaway) deserts his buddies in favour of Rizzo (Stockard Channing), ‘When a guy picks a chick over his buddies, somethin’ gotta be wrong.’ The entire first part of Grease follows this logic of enforced sexual separation. As Frenchy (Didi Conn) insists, explaining why all-female activities are a necessary part of high-school life, ‘Men are rats. Listen to me. Fleas on rats. Worse than that. Amoebas on fleas on rats. The only man a girl can depend on is her daddy.’ For women as well as men, the early portions of Grease argue strongly in favour of homosocial relationships. But the film soon begins to push aside this logic of sexual separation. When National Bandstand comes to Rydell High, students are summarily informed that ‘all couples must be boy/girl’. Soon afterward, the strength of single-sex relationships is compromised by the limits imposed on Danny and Kenickie’s male bonding. In recognition of their longtime friendship, Danny agrees to serve as Kenickie’s second at Thunder Road, but the physical expression of this arrangement – a friendly hug between Danny and Kenickie – is rapidly disavowed as inappropriate. Guys, the film insists, mustn’t show emotional attachment to other guys. Danny takes great pride in fulfilling a leadership role within his all-male group. One aspect of that leadership involves knowing just what kind of relationships are appropriate among group members. Whenever Danny is tempted to reveal even the slightest level of affection for another male, he instantly draws back, simultaneously demonstrating both the temptation of same-sex bonding and its inappropriateness. Sentimentality is simply not suitable among men, Grease tells us loud and clear.\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 27\n\nF R O M H O M O S O C I A L T O H E T E R O S E X U A L : T H E M U S I C A L’ S T W O P R O J E C T S\n\n27\n\nWhile Danny is demonstrating both the importance and the dangers of male bonding, Sandy is being initiated into the parallel female group, where she learns both the pleasures of female togetherness and the potential dangers of heterosexual contact. On both sides of the sexual barrier, the characters spend substantial time and energy talking about the other group, but these conversations are consistently restricted to same-sex scenes. When the T-Birds turn their mechanical shop class into an ode to automobiles and the young men who drive and work on them, they are quite exceptionally accompanied by a woman – Mrs Murdock, the female shop teacher (Alice Ghostley) – but her entirely sexless demeanour only serves to prove the rule. Grease’s finale totally reverses the film’s earlier dedication to single-sex logic. After Sandy clearly demonstrates to Danny that he’s ‘The One That I Want’, we are subjected to an entire song explaining the diverse ways in which Sandy and Danny ‘Go Together’. After over an hour of a fundamentally homosocial approach to life, Grease now switches strategies, insisting instead that heterosexual pairing is the better long-term course. Not just Sandy and Danny, but also Rizzo and Kenickie and even Coach Calhoun (Sid Caesar) and Principal McGee (Eve Arden) are matched in the film’s final tableaux. A film that began by stressing homosocial relationships ends by vaunting heterosexual pairings. In addition, Danny’s conversion from the homosocial world of the Thunderbirds to a heterosexual couple with Sandy is paralleled by his switch from T-Bird leather to an athletic letter sweater. Danny has graduated, the film implies, not only from high school, but from the homosocial ties of his past to the heterosexual relationship that will define his future. When we concentrate on musical beginnings, we discover something quite different from familiar findings based on musical endings. Like Grease, many musicals appear under this new light to be about a\n\nAfter one homosocial scene after another, Grease finally resolves its ambiguities by permanently pairing John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John\n\nCohan Chapter 1\n\n9/8/10\n\n3:09 pm\n\nPage 28\n\n28\n\nTHE SOUND OF MUSICALS\n\nvery specific rite of passage. Homosocial relationships, dominant in musical beginnings, must be put away in favour of the heterosexual relationships that dominate musical endings. It is important to note the mismatch between these two terms. Musical beginnings are typically homosocial, while musical endings are almost always heterosexual in nature. Why this slippage from the social to the sexual? In an important sense, I would suggest, this apparently insignificant shift is what the musical is all about. Many other texts – from popular psychology primers to buddy films and novels of development – champion a maturation process involving graduation from a narrow homosocial group to the broader heterosocial community. In contrast, the musical’s insistence on a rite of passage that is specifically marked as progressing from the homosocial to the heterosexual has the effect of implicitly foregrounding the absent homosexual category. Whereas a movement from homosocial to heterosocial describes nothing more than the shift from childhood single-sex groups to mature mixed-sex society, the passage from homosocial to heterosexual specifically negates the alternative possibility of movement from relationships that are only homosocial to fully homosexual bonds. It would thus appear that the musical as a genre forwards two separate but coordinated projects. The musical labours to eradicate homosocial bonds – or at least to keep them from turning into homosexual ties – just as hard as it works to establish durable heterosexual relationships. In order to be a productive citizen, the musical argues, we must not only put away ‘childish’ same-sex relationships in favour of ‘mature’ mixed-sex society, but we must also avoid allowing homosocial connections to turn into homosexual ties, adopting instead the solution of heterosexual courtship that the musical works so hard to represent as ‘natural’. In this way, the musical imposes a restrictive ideology, offering implicit training in the conservative attitude that dominated American society during the decades when the musical thrived. Certainly, the restrictive nature of the musical’s twin projects helps to explain why so many critics have felt the need to develop alternative approaches to the musical, stressing spectatorship, style or a star persona as an appropriate alternative to the plot-oriented readings that long dominated the field.11 Stressing musical conclusions, we cannot help but attend to the genre’s familiar support of coupling between the sexes. But a closer look at the musical’s full agenda reveals a studied attempt to both present and reject the alternative of same-sex relationships. In order to understand the musical’s cultural strategies, we must broaden our approach, attending to both of the musical’s projects – the homosocial along with the heterosexual.12\n\nNotes 1.

This is especially true of the growing number of critics who see the musical as a potential repository of gay values and/or as an object of gay appreciation.

In order to stress his point that ‘there is more to the making of musicals beyond the plotline’, and that gay readings appropriately subordinate plot orientation to spectacle sensitivity, Matthew Tinkcom must first recognise the heterosexual and end-loaded nature of that plotline (Working Like a Homosexual: Camp, Capital, Cinema [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2002], p. 53). 5.
