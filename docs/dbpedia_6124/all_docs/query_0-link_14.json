        "text": "Michelle Pfeiffer has been away from the screen long enough to rate a mention in the Whatever Happened To? chart, though on this score she's still behind Joe Pesci, and a long way below that chart's all-time No 1 occupant, Nick Apollo Forte, the vanished star of Woody Allen's Broadway Danny Rose.\n\nBut anyway, after a five-year family break, Pfeiffer is back in a small and upstagable role in this curious, clenched new version of John Waters's 1988 movie Hairspray. Her presence provides one of its many minor points of interest, which don't add up to a satisfying movie. It is choreographed and directed by Adam Shankman and manages to be not completely outrageous, not completely relaxed and not completely funny, with daubs of satire applied with a paintbrush eight inches across.\n\nThe story is about a happy-go-lucky plump teenager called Tracy Turnblad in Baltimore in 1962, a terrific dancer who longs to be picked for a local TV pop show featuring neighbourhood kids jiving and bopping to the latest chart sounds. One day a month the programme nervously features something called \"Negro Day\", when black kids and black music are allowed on the air. The show is produced by the ruthless martinet and ex-beauty queen Velma Von Tussle, played by Pfeiffer with a barracuda-mouth and eyes like gimlets, and Velma is icily opposed to Tracy's secret plan to integrate blacks and whites on the show, a liberal enthusiasm shared, a little implausibly, by the show's squeaky-clean presenter Corny Collins (James Marsden). Tracy is played by 18-year-old newcomer Nikki Blonsky; her mom is wackily played by John Travolta in drag - it was Divine in 1988 - and dad is Christopher Walken. Ricki Lake, the star of the first movie, returns in cameo, as does Waters himself as a dirty-mac pervert.\n\nIt's actually not a remake of the film, but very much a heavy and untransformed version of the 2002 stage musical that grew out of the first movie, and has the same inert look as the 2005 screen version of The Producers. With the crisp-clean dance sequences, the refrigerated professionalism of the chorus, the Colgate smiles, the one-line zingers snapped out by the boys and girls, and everything spoken and acted slightly too loud and too big, as if to reach Row Z, it looks like a naff, old-fashioned coach-party stage show - or maybe an ultra-modern TV reality show, where the point is to cast the lead in an imaginary revival of Hairspray. And in fact the story is about TV viewers calling in to vote for their favourite dancer on the show. Watching the previously unknown Nikki Blonsky as the big teenager battling the show's Barbie-ist attitude, I couldn't help thinking of a real-world scenario: Jennifer Hudson, the young African-American singer and runner-up on TV's American Idol, who wound up winning an Oscar in Dreamgirls, stealing the scene from Beyonc√©. Hudson had a passion that Blonsky never shows, and never has an opportunity to show.\n\nGoofy teen princess Amanda Bynes plays Penny, Tracy's best friend, and does so her with her usual collection of quirky tics, pouting, grimacing, eyeballs twitching from left to right like some sort of out-patient. Allison Janney is her mother, and has one funny line, warning her wayward daughter not to get involved in pop music, or she will \"end up in prison, fighting whores for cigarettes\".\n\nThen of course there's Travolta dressed up as a big dumb woman, his great square jawline in powder and rouge, so lovably stupid and greedy that she can always be distracted from urgent business by doughnuts, chocolate brownies, etc. There are some chuckles. At first. Travolta is a good sport, but not a natural comic to say the very least, and there is something weird and disconcerting after a while in his failure to find any self-aware fun in the spectacle he is providing: the star of Grease and Pulp Fiction dressed up, in David Walliams's phrase, as a lady. He just plugs gamely away at the role, saying the lines, without much of a twinkle in those puffy eyes. Michelle Pfeiffer's Wicked-Witch-of-the-West act is hardly less of a panto turn. Perhaps the whole film is spiritually in drag: every female role should be played by a man. I wondered how Queen Latifah must have felt playing opposite Travolta: was she cast because Eddie Murphy wasn't available?\n\nAs for that racial integration storyline, it is laudable and worthy, but the real theme has been denied and displaced. The unacknowledged subject of Hairspray is sexual, not racial anxiety. Women with non-size-zero bodies very probably did feel excluded from pop culture happiness, then as now, but I suspect that what John Waters had uppermost in his mind was the secret of gay identity and gay feelings inside the teenagers of 1960s Baltimore - the time and place of his own early years. None of the characters in this campy film is gay; or, to put it another way, they all are. Hairspray looks like it's sending up the straight, heterosexual world, but it also resembles a big, brightly coloured closet which declines to reveal its contents."
