        "text": "MUSKEGON — Oneka Curry is 38 years old and has never been in a stage show. Until now.\n\nIn Muskegon Civic Theatre’s production of the musical comedy “Hairspray,” Curry belts out songs as Motormouth Mabel, an African-American radio disc jockey integral to integrating an all-white television teen dance show in 1960s Baltimore.\n\nThe musical, adapted from director John Waters’ 1988 movie of the same name, carries a theme of overcoming prejudices — not just racial, but also issues of people setting aside their differences and misconceptions by discovering what they have in common.\n\nThe primary story, by “Hairspray” book writers Mark O’Donnell and Thomas Meehan, concerns Tracy Turnblad (played by Kimberly Sorenson), a plump teenage girl with a bouffant hairdo and optimism to burn.\n\nTracy wants to dance on “The Corny Collins Show,” a program heretofore restricted to the “beautiful people,” and whites. Ignoring people who scoff at her physical appearance, Tracy accepts others for who and what they are, instead of how they look.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n\"Hairspray\"\n\n• What: First Muskegon Civic Theatre production of 2011-2012 season\n\n• When: 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 3 p.m. Sunday\n\n• Where: Frauenthal Theater, 425 W. Western, Muskegon\n\n• Tickets: $17-$20; available at the Frauenthal Box Office (727-8001) or any StarTickets outlet. Call the MCT office (231-725-3852) for group discounts.\n\nFiguring right makes might, she becomes an activist, campaigning to force the racially segregated program to also accept black teens on camera.\n\nUnder the direction of West Michigan stage veteran Jim Query, the biracial “Hairspray” cast brings together a cross-section of the local community. For Curry, it’s quite a way to break into show business.\n\n“I’m just glad to be in a play of this nature,” she said. “It already speaks to me, because I love that everybody, no matter what their race is, no matter what their differences are ... it’s just an honor to play a role in a play such as this.”\n\nThe main reason Curry is playing a feature role in “Hairspray” is that her son, Elijah, who has been in several MCT productions, insisted.\n\n“He’s the reason that I’m in it,” she said. “He just begged me to try out for the part. I was hesitant at first, because I had never done anything like this. I just gave it a chance and I got the part.”\n\nThat “Hairspray” brings together blacks and whites working towards the same goal — a good show — is something that fits MCT’s sense of community, said Ginny Sprague, the company’s managing director.\n\n“We try to do diverse casting wherever we can, Sprague said. “We’re a diverse community. We’re a community theater. We want our productions to reflect our community.”\n\nWhatever messages and lessons “Hairspray” might impart, its main purpose is entertainment.\n\nWith music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Shaiman and Scott Wittman, “Hairspray” is a whirlwind of energy and action, singing and dancing. A successful production, said Query, depends on “Hairspray” being a sprint that bursts out of the box and accelerates to the final curtain.\n\n“Hairspray” requires that most of its performers be young. Query’s cast also includes a number of adult theater veterans — notably Brian J. Reeds as Corny Collins, a character having more than a little in common with teen-dance-show pioneer Dick Clark; and Judy Johnson as an imperious meddler named Velma Von Tussle.\n\n“Right from the get-go, I’ve said that the two things we have to do is think about energy and pace, and lots of pop,” Query said. “The kids understand that. The adults are getting into it. Getting them (all) focused before we even start the prologue, that’s what’s important.”\n\nAmong the “Hairspray” actors who must be “on” from start to finish, one of the more unique is Jason Bertoia. He’s male. His character is not.\n\nBertoia, 32, costars as Tracy’s corpulent mother, Edna. The female role is written to be played by a man. In the ‘88 movie, Edna was played by the late Divine, an obese drag queen featured in many of Waters’ films. The 2002 Broadway adaptation of “Hairspray” co-starred Harvey Fierstein as Edna. Various other productions also have had men (Michael McKean, Bruce Viilanch, etc.) in the role.\n\nEdna got the superstar treatment by a fat-suited John Travolta in the 2007 movie version of the stage musical.\n\nOne key to playing a woman, said Bertoia, is to not settle for cliche, to not make Edna a drag act.\n\n“I try to not come at it as a man playing a woman,” said Bertoia, whose last stage experience was at Muskegon Catholic Central High School (class of ‘97). “I’ve had to think of it as a female character.”\n\nMCT’s “Hairspray” has a number of firsts. It’s the first time Bertoia has played a woman, and the first time Sorenson, as Tracy, has played a lead.\n\n“To be fulfilling the role of Tracy is a dream come true because, really, how many other roles are written where the underdog gets the guy and the happy ending?” said Sorenson, a 19-year-old Muskegon Community College student.\n\n“And really, who wouldn't want to play Tracy? She is spunky, full of life, confident, a little dorky at times; but who isn't? ... (She’s) passionate about following her dream to dance. And most important she sticks up for what is right, no matter how hard it may be. Playing Tracy has really taught me a lot, she has inspired me to be even more confident in my own skin and to never back down or give up on my dreams.”\n\nFor all the fun that “Hairspray” promises, the show carries the courage of its convictions. One subplot raises an interracial romance between Tracy’s bubbly white friend Penny (Erin Madalyn Mickelson) and Motormouth Mabel's son, Seaweed J. Stubbs (Davante Buie).\n\nResident hunk Link Larkin (Erin Robere) falls for Tracy but balks when the prospect of social change seems too risky.\n\nWhatever transpires, “Hairspray” finds its cast dancing up a storm. And, to put the matter mildly, not many community-theater dancers are accomplished hoofers in the mold of, say, Travolta.\n\nCo-choreographed by Julie Powell and Rhashika Lewis, MCT’s “Hairspray” has dance numbers straight out of the ‘60s, original steps molded to take advantage of the performers’ strengths and limitations.\n\nPowell and Lewis have worked to capture “the essence of the time, the feeling of change,” Powell said. “The key to making this work is to look and see what (the actors’) natural movement style is, and work with that, rather than trying to give them steps that get them frustrated and stressed. We want to showcase what they’re good at. Are they a strong singer that moves well? My job is to make them comfortable and to look great so that they feel good.”"
