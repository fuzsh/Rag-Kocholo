The critic/audience score is displayed as (75/63) (for example), and is the score at the time I am writing the rating.\n\nTo put the scale into the “stars system,” think 90–99 = 5 stars. 80–89 = 4.5 stars. 70–79 = 4 stars. 60–69 = 3.5 stars. Et cetera. Above a (60) = fresh. Anything below a (60) = rotten.\n\nEach review may have spoilers.\n\nEach review may have spoilers.\n\nEach review may have spoilers.\n\nSmash that “command+f” and search to see if I’ve covered any of your favorites or just see what I’ve rated most recently."
