        "text": "Disclaimer: This is an academic piece I wrote during my time at university. I have uploaded here to archive, along with some other work.\n\nHairspray (2007) offers a unique opportunity for analysis on how history is represented on film due to its status as a remake of a 1980s cult film centred on the 1960s Civil Rights Movement masked as a light-hearted musical. Hairspray’s nostalgic pastiche of the aesthetics and gleeful charms of the 1960s dwarves over its whitewashing and undermining of the nationwide Civil Rights Movement that highlights the films glamorised reflective nature on real-world events.\n\nThrough its passive portrayal of the black community, individualised focus on white girl Tracy Turnblad, and significant changes from reality, Hairspray’s depiction of 1960s Baltimore reflects modernity’s obsession with nostalgia and its ability to rework, reappropriate or rewrite history in a myriad of ways. This echoes Chapmans argument that historical film offers a mediation on history rather than a true reflection (Carlsten and McGarry, 2015). This flexibility with the past is a result of modernity’s desire to bring past and present together, and to reflect critically on the current state of modernity by reminiscing on a previous way of life (Clewell, 2013; Carlsten and McGarry, 2015; Pierson, 2014; Rosenstone, 2006). Hairspray encompasses several aspects of modernity, such as individualism, nostalgia, commodification, and revisionism.\n\nNostalgia has been consistently linked as a symptom of modernity that most scholars believe arose during the 17th century as a serious medical condition related to the longing for home (Clewell, 2013; Fritsche, 2001; Atia and Davies, 2010; Avestisjans, 2016). This longing for home has closely been related to migrants or displaced individuals and has roots dating back to the aftermath of the French Revolution (Fritsche, 2001). However, the notion of “home” has gradually become redundant due to the spread of globalisation post-Second World War (Atia and Davies, 2010; Clewell, 2013; Gkinopoulos, 2019) and nostalgia has come to be viewed more as an emotional bittersweet reaction to the memory of a previous life or time (Avestisjans, 2016), and in this case a less-globalised society (Fritsche, 2001; Atia and Davies, 2010; Avestisjans, 2016).\n\nThe spread of globalisation has worked in tandem with the overbearing presence of capitalism in modern society, as the spread and use of capital has stretched out to a global level, creating a worldwide playground for the owners of the capital (Collins, 2015). The rise of globalisation and capitalism has led to the rise in personal individualism and privatisation, where society has diminished the power of community and instead focuses on the goal of the individual for individual gain (Elliot and Lemert, 2006; Jameson, 1991; Avestisjans, 2016.). Furthermore, the increased presence of commodification since the rise of capitalism further benefits the capitalistic society as it strives to transform all things, such as goods, knowledge, or people, into something that can be bought and sold (Jameson, 1991; Clewell, 2013; Potts, 2014).\n\nNostalgic media is a place to reflect on past happier times and to critically analyse past failings to help better the present (Atia and Davies; Gkinopoulos, 2019; Clewell, 2013). In his study on television show Mad Men, Pierson (2014, pp. 139) argues that viewers find nostalgic imagery in the text as both “alluring and repellent” by finding comfort in the appealing aesthetics and the impending social change but are simultaneously dissuaded by the abundance of bigotry and immense consumerism. This highlights the reflective yet critical nature of the nostalgic audience, fondly reminiscing on certain aspects of the previous life but understanding the faults of the past to better the present whilst simultaneously finding comfort in past tendencies that the present has neglected or squandered, echoing Rosenstone’s (2006) argument about history on film:\n\n“It does not simply provide an image of the past, it wants you to feel strongly about that image – specifically, about the characters involved in the historical situations that it depicts… Film does more than want to teach the lesson that history hurts: it wants you, the viewer, to experience the hurt (and pleasures) of the past.”(Rosenstone, 2006, pp. 18)\n\nNostalgic media has been studied for its ability to portray historical events for a modern audience and has been praised for its pedagogic opportunities (Edney, 2017; Delmont, 2016; Atia and Davies, 2010) however a consistent critique is the eschewing of historical facts and individuals either due to dramatic effect or misunderstanding over someone else’s lived experiences (Thomas, 2017; Atia and Davies, 2010; Carlsten and McGarry, 2015; Gkinopoulos, 2019).\n\nThe reappropriation of collective memory in relation to the Civil Rights Movement is analysed in Thomas’ (2017) study on contemporary literature regarding the Boston Busing Crisis in the 1970s. Thomas’ study argues that the fictional literature, written predominantly by White Americans, failed to accurately portray the extreme institutionalised racism and segregation that caused the crisis with Thomas (pp. 266) concluding that it was more concerned “with resuscitating a nostalgic American heroism and white innocence than with reclaiming a historical memory based on black struggle and resilience”.\n\nThomas’ argument of nostalgic White American heroism can be levied against Hairspray and Tracy Turnblad. Like the Boston Busing Crisis literature, Hairspray is a Civil Rights story constructed by white creators; the original was written and directed by John Waters and its 2007 remake was directed by Adam Shankman, with Waters conceiving Hairspray (1988) as a nostalgic reflection on his youth and The Buddy Deane Show, which inspired The Corny Collins Show (Benson-Allott, 2009; Schrader, 2011). Hairspray offers a retelling of the integration of Baltimore daytime television, but instead of opting for accurately portraying pivotal moments of black integration, community, and freedom, it instead recounts its tale through the lens of white teenager Tracy (Benson-Allott, 2009; Schrader, 2011; Plant, 2014).\n\nHairspray promotes Tracy to the forefront of civil rights in Baltimore as she strives for integration on her favourite show, The Corny Collins Show, and relegates the black presence in the film to passive participants rather than active protesters and proponents for change, who follow Tracy in her individualised mission (Benson-Allott, 2009; Schrader, 2011; Plant, 2014). This dichotomy is evident when Tracy organises a march on the television studio, which strongly echoes the notoriously impactful, black-led marches of the Civil Rights Movement. The portrayal of the march as a white idea, with the black characters like Maybelle surprised at the notion, effectively highlights Hairspray’s problem as historical fiction (Benson-Allott, 2009; Schrader, 2011; Plant, 2014).\n\nMany scholars have discussed the rise of individualism and move away from community as a key factor of modernity (Elliott and Lemert, 2006; Jameson, 1991), which Tracy’s story exemplifies. Hairspray prioritises Tracy’s individual drive for integration on her favourite show, which she identities with due to her “othering” as a fat person in society which she believes is akin to racism towards black people, and her own personal “Cinderella story” (Benson-Allott 2009;Schrader, 2011), rather than focusing on the nationwide communal effort by the black community to fight segregation on an institutional level (Schrader, 2011; Benson-Allott, 2009).\n\nIt is apparent that Hairspray aims for a “feel-good” positive approach to the Civil Rights Movement (Benson-Allott, 2009; Schrader, 2011), but its individualised revisionist approach diminishes the historical significance of the real-world events which symbolises Carlsten and McGarry’s (2015, pp. 10) claim that “films do not represent reality but an interpretation of reality, and they very often reflect a hidden or not-so-hidden propagandistic, whether intentional or unintentional”. It is to be believed that Water’s had the correct intentions when conceiving his original story (Benson-Allott, 2009), but the execution has favoured his voice as a white man rather than the voices of the black community (Plant, 2014).\n\nFurthermore, in Benson-Allott’s (2009) study on Hairspray, she argues that the film strives for nostalgia due to its recreation of the decade and its artefacts through its costuming, set design, and styling, rather than accurately portraying the political landscape that grounds the film. Additionally, Benson-Allott claims that Hairspray’s representation of the Civil Rights Movement as the backdrop of a white musical love story “delegitimises contemporaneous debates around integration” and believes the film considers it a “fad”, there solely as a step in Tracy’s individual journey. By focusing on Tracy’s story, Hairspray fails to represent the black-led Civil Rights Movement accurately, instead positioning it as an individual white victory (Benson-Allott, 2009).\n\nHowever, while the films portrayal of history may lack depth to the time it is set, the urge to relive life in a different time, albeit through rose-tinted glasses, is a direct response to the destabilisation of society that has come with modernity (Jameson, 1991, Fritsche, 2001). Modernity scholars have discussed nostalgia as an escape from the perils of the current predicament, offering solace in the past and the “good ol’ days” (Jameson, 1991; Clewell, 2013; Pierson, 2014). Viewers of Hairspray can relish in its care-free utopian approach to civil rights, choosing to remember them as an easier, white-centric movement while enjoying the aesthetics and stylings of the time long gone, when America held itself up by its sense of community and neighbourly relations (Pierson, 2014, Thomas, 2017).\n\nHairspray’s utopian nostalgic history is evident by comparing it to the real-world events that inspired Water’s original story. Buddy Deane was never fully integrated; it received bomb threats after an interracial broadcast which led to the show’s cancellation. In contrast, Corny Collins becomes fully integrated at the conclusion of Hairspray with seemingly no racial outcry from the segregated Baltimore (Benson-Allott, 2009; Schrader, 2011). This exemplifies Jameson’s (1991, pp. 279) argument regarding nostalgia, claiming that nostalgia films discuss the past “not as a list of facts or historical realities… but rather a list of stereotypes, of ideas of facts and historical realities”.\n\nFurthermore, Delmont (2016) argues that Hairspray’s idealistic revisionism of racial tensions is a way for the audiences to criticise racial animosity, but it does not provide a way to confront or counter the layers of institutionalised racism that uphold segregation. Likewise, Gkinopoulos’ (2019) study into nostalgic memory and human rights states that the omission of concrete facts for an abstract version of events can undermine the personal nature of the events in favour of an easier narrative.\n\nHowever, Delmont (2016) understands the pedagogic appeal of masking a troubling aspect of history in a colourful, camp musical that many will watch, concluding his article by saying, “there is no guarantee that viewers will take up these discussions, but Hairspray offers plenty of material for those who choose to do so”. Hairspray offers an escape from the failings of modernity, providing solace in the aesthetics of a bygone era and by simplifying the contentious nature of the decade whilst offering the opportunity for a critical look at how things were, how it may compare to the present and how we can potentially learn from the past to better the present (Clewell, 2013; Gkinopoulos; Carlsten and McGarry, 2015; Edney, 2017). This is further argued by Gkinopoulos (2019) who believes that by looking at past experiences relating to human rights, one can seek to revive past accomplishments to advance human rights in the present. Gkinopolous concludes their study by saying:\n\nUnderstanding past experiences and the universal needs reflected in these experiences will help to define the future not as predetermined because of past traumas, but as “a space where everything is still to be won” (Hebdige, 1993, p. 278), where remembering acts in a constructive way to heal, restore, and transform past misdeeds. (Gkinopoulos, 2019, pp. 860) Whilst Hairspray may not offer the most accurate portrayal of segregation/integration, its discussion of these topics can still benefit the audience to reflect on the injustices featured in the film and to learn from them to benefit modern society (Delmont, 2016; Gkinopoulos, 2019; Carlsten and McGarry, 2015).\n\nUpon reflection, initially Hairspray may seem like standard nostalgic pastiche that has arisen from the modern desire to live in the past due to the destabilisation of modernity through capitalism and globalisation. However, Hairspray offers an insightful reflection on modernity’s relationship with past communal trauma from an outsider’s perspective.\n\nBy communicating the story of the Civil Rights Movement through the lens of the white saviour, the film highlights the problem with modernity’s desire to nostalgically recreate the past by omitting key voices and themes in favour of narrative structure. By commodifying a human rights movement, Hairspray, and other similar works related to the Civil Rights Movement, minimise the severity of the past in favour of promoting white individualism drenched in the allure of the aesthetic of the decade.\n\nNonetheless, it can be argued that Hairspray does not need to be historically accurate to offer pedagogical opportunities by enlightening the modern audience to the troubles of the past, potentially encouraging them to further develop their knowledge on the topic. In the modern desire to return to a past time, one may find answers to present issues with modernity located in these historical texts. Hairspray may not change the modern world, but it offers a unique opportunity to reflect on life as it was in the past and how this reflection may be utilised to better the present."
