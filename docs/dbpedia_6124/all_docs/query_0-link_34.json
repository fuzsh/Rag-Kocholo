        "text": "The movie version of the hit Broadway musical “Hairspray” is perfectly pleasant—I smiled to myself all the way through it—but it’s not as exhilarating as the show. For a subject like this—old dance crazes and pop styles—what matters is not so much the actual past but how we feel about it, and onstage David Rockwell’s sets and William Ivey Long’s costumes distilled our nostalgia for the candied years between Elvis’s early work and the arrival of the Beatles. Set in 1962, “Hairspray,” whose first incarnation was John Waters’s deadpan camp movie from 1988, celebrates a time when teen-agers, as a distinct consumer group with their own culture, were a fairly recent invention. The stage musical crystallized the euphoria of that period as naïvely eager commerce and irony-free fantasy; when the chubby young heroine, Tracy Turnblad, awoke in bed and sang “Good Morning, Baltimore,” she was surrounded by a pink shag carpet dotted with hair-spray cans and 45s, and the bouffant-and-beehive nuttiness of her world was buoyed by affection. The movie is a lovefest, too, but, this time, when Tracy (Nikki Blonsky) awakes, she jumps onto the streets of Baltimore and passes vermin, a drunk, and a creep. Later, she joins a civil-rights march that has a confrontation with the police. Many people love movies because they make sensuous contact with the surfaces of the world, but this material hardly cries out for realism. “Hairspray” doesn’t need to be “opened up”; it needs to be freshly stylized for the screen.\n\nThat hasn’t quite happened. The director, Adam Shankman, who has made comedies and family films, and the screenwriter, Leslie Dixon, have removed the traces of weird humor and Broadway blue that gave the show its happily knowing flavor. I admire John Travolta, but using this movie star, rather than the show’s Harvey Fierstein, as Edna Turnblad, Tracy’s hefty mother, is an idiocy on the same level as replacing Julie Andrews with Audrey Hepburn for the movie version of “My Fair Lady.” Both Fierstein and Divine, who played Edna in the original movie, worked as female impersonators who confidently let us in on the joke. In the show, when Fierstein held forth on life and love and the Gabor sisters in his basso absurdo—a testosterone-drenched Bensonhurst snarl—he was not a man pretending to be a woman; he was a man openly playing a woman and speaking in his own voice. But Travolta does a wistful imitation of the female sex. Buried in a full-body fat suit and various silicone prosthetic appliances, he looks rounded, smooth, and cute, rather like Miss Piggy, and he speaks in a light, high female voice—he sounds a little like Robin Williams in “Mrs. Doubtfire,” without the lilt. The role demands exaggeration rather than modesty, yet Travolta, with a misbegotten sense of duty, tries to give an authentic performance as a working-class Baltimore housewife of forty-five years ago—a shy, guarded woman who is embarrassed about her weight. It’s a touching attempt, but the lunatic joke that started with Divine has almost vanished.\n\nThe rest of “Hairspray” is less delicate and self-conscious. As before, Tracy lives to dance and to make out with the sweet, good-looking boy (Zac Efron) who’s the high-school king. “Hairspray” is geared to her energy and her triumph. At the local afternoon-TV dance show, she bursts through the ban on fat girls, frustrating the designs of the hypocritical, racist station manager, Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants her own untalented daughter to become Miss Teenage Hairspray 1962. Pfeiffer plays this vaudeville bitch to the hilt. Her Velma, however, is not a very formidable villain, and everyone else helps Tracy’s dreams come true, including the show’s slick m.c., Corny Collins (James Marsden), and the lead performer on the show’s monthly Negro Day, Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah). At school, Tracy falls in with the black kids, who admire her spirit and show her how to really dance. When Negro Day is booted off the schedule, Tracy goes to the black side of town, joins forces with her friends there, and fights to integrate the station. (The protesters show up with signs saying “Do the Checkerboard.”) In an amiably sappy way, “Hairspray” is offering a racial fable: blacks teach whites how to move, liberating their bodies, and whites help blacks gain their rights. It’s hard to take this message-movie stuff even half seriously: Shankman seems to think he has something important to say, but Marc Shaiman’s music (including a few new songs), with its homogenized Broadway sound, is not memorable enough to serve as a vehicle of political thought—or even genial political fantasy.\n\nThe rest is dance. The kids hold an endless platter party in the TV studio, school corridors, and classrooms, and it’s a relief to see their bodies whole, and not chopped into churning limbs in the Baz Luhrmann (“Moulin Rouge”) or Rob Marshall (“Chicago”) manner. But the routines, unfortunately, are nothing special—worked-up versions of popular dances of the time, with groups of girls in cone skirts and boys in cardigans and string ties dancing in rows, and the camera, for the most part, plopped down right in front of them. Shankman could use a little liberating himself: with few exceptions, he uses the camera stiffly; he doesn’t give us the concentrated essence of pop whimsy that we want. The finest moment is something very simple and straightforward: Christopher Walken, playing Tracy’s father, Wilbur Turnblad, coarsens his voice and gentles his manner and woos Edna with the lovely Old Broadway-style song “You’re Timeless to Me.” The number begins in the Turnblad living room, works its way down the back stairs, and concludes in the yard, amid hanging laundry. In the end, Shankman may feel a greater kinship with the old folks than with the pulsing kids.\n\n“There’s something about humans,” muses Remy (Patton Oswalt), the French country rat who is the hero of the animated gastronomic marvel “Ratatouille.” He goes on: “They taste. . . . They discover.” What Remy doesn’t say, though it’s implicit in his attitude, is that humans and rats are brothers under the fur: they alone, among all God’s creatures, eat everything. But Remy has his own version of the omnivore’s dilemma: he’s afflicted with a refined palate. Refusing the usual repast of garbage, he realizes that in order to eat well he needs to cook. “Ratatouille” starts out as a minor conceit about a rat who turns himself into a connoisseur, and becomes a gripping comic tale about the implacability of an artist. Washed into a sewer, Remy lands in Paris, and makes himself known to a young man, Linguini (Lou Romano), who has inherited a famous restaurant but cannot so much as crack an egg. Quietly, he rides under Linguini’s toque and pulls tufts of his hair, controlling his chopping and sauce-stirring techniques like a master puppeteer. A menacing challenge lies ahead: a visit from the annihilating restaurant critic Anton Ego (Peter O’Toole).\n\nThe animation gang at Pixar don’t settle for goosing old fairy tales and shining up media-weary jokes, as the DreamWorks folks do in the “Shrek” series. They create each movie afresh, and some of their productions, especially this one and “The Incredibles,” both written and directed by Brad Bird, have reached heights of invention, speed, and wit not seen in animation since the work done by Chuck Jones at Warner Bros. in the nineteen-forties. In “Ratatouille,” the level of moment-by-moment craftsmanship is a wonder. Keeping the space clear and coherent may seem an odd thing to praise in an animated film, but one of the marvellous things about “Ratatouille” is how well we come to understand the geography of the kitchen in which much of the movie takes place.\n\nThe point of view jumps to the top of cabinets and scampers beneath ovens and counters, but we always know where we are in relation to the rest of the kitchen and why it matters where Remy goes or doesn’t go. When he calls in his family and friends to help out in a crisis, the animals, who need to be sanitized, emerge from a dishwasher in a puff of steam and get assigned to their stations as sauciers, sous-chefs, and the like, where they crawl up ladles to the rims of soup tureens and send mushrooms cascading into a waiting boeuf en daube. Our knowledge of the kitchen makes the rapid-fire gags much funnier. Bird has turned disgust into a celebration of efficiency, and, on the fly, he offers the most detailed cooking lore and the most ardent celebration of the chef as artist since “Babette’s Feast.” Toques off to Mr. Bird. At a time when many Americans have so misunderstood the ethos of democracy that they hate being outclassed by anyone, when science is disdained as dangerous and expertise as élitism, this animation artist, working in a family medium, has made two brilliant movies that unequivocally champion excellence. “Ratatouille” suggests that some omnivores are better than others. There’s nothing to do but get over it. ♦"
