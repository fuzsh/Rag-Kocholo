        "text": "Brad Pitt‘s Formula One movie is racing toward a summer 2025 date, with Apple partnering with Warner Bros. on a wide theatrical release with IMAX screenings.\n\nThe movie will hit theaters in North America on June 27, 2025, and re-teams the filmmakers behind Top Gun: Maverick, including director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Internationally, the movie will begin rolling out on June 25.\n\nAs reported by The Hollywood Reporter, the movie landed at Apple under a deal that assured the film would receive a substantial theatrical release, with a window of at least 30 days, if not longer. At the time of the deal, it was clear that a distribution partner would need to come on board for the film. Apple has done such partnerships in the recent past, most notably working with Paramount on the wide theatrical release of Killers of the Flower Moon, and Sony on Napoleon.\n\nPitt will be joined onscreen by Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo.\n\nPitt stars as a former driver who returns to Formula 1 alongside Idris’s racer as his teammate at APXGP, a fictional team on the grid. The film was made in collaboration with ten Formula 1 teams, with scenes shot during real F1 races.\n\nKosinski produces the feature alongside Bruckheimer and Chad Oman of Jerry Bruckheimer Films; and Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner for Plan B Entertainment, and Lewis Hamilton under his Dawn Apollo Films banner."
