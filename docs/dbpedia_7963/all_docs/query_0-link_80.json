        "text": "The odds were ever in The Hunger Games’ favor. Based on Suzanne Collins’s best-selling novel, the film opened in March 2012 to $152 million domestically, topping opening-weekend totals for the first Harry Potter and Twilight movies. Lionsgate’s property would generate three more films based on Collins’s books—2013’s Catching Fire, 2014’s Mockingjay – Part 1, and 2015’s Mockingjay – Part 2.\n\nBut a decade after The Hunger Games’ release, it can safely be said that it was also the last successful Y.A.-targeted book-to-film franchise of its kind.\n\nUnlike the supernatural settings of its predecessors, The Hunger Games was a futuristic tale. Set in the fictional dystopia of Panem, children, or “tributes,” aged 12 to 18 were forced to participate in an annual fight-to-the-death competition. Two competitors from each of the country’s 12 districts would duke it out via live broadcast for the wealthy citizens of the Capitol, under the dictatorial gaze of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). This system would be rocked by District 12 tribute Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteered to compete in the games in place of her younger sister.\n\nOver the course of four films, The Hunger Games would gross nearly $3 billion worldwide, peaking with the $158 million domestic haul for Catching Fire—released the same year Lawrence won an Oscar. “I think one reason this franchise was so successful is that this generation feels they are fighting for their survival all the time—and that survival is far from certain,” The Hunger Games director Gary Ross told The Hollywood Reporter as his film reached its 10th birthday. “From climate change, to authoritarianism, their generation feels a real sense of dread and jeopardy.” He later added, “I think, sadly, the themes in this movie are only more resonant now than when we made it.”\n\nYet by the time franchise closer The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 hit theaters (Collins’s final book was split into two movies, following the money-making precedent set by Harry Potter and Twilight), the films’ box office draw had softened. The final chapter opened at $102 million domestically—$56 million less than Catching Fire—but still ranked as one of the year’s biggest movies.\n\n“For years everyone tried to have the next Harry Potter and no one managed to do so, but that didn’t stop companies from trying,” Craig Dehmel, then head of international distribution for Fox, told TheWrap in 2015. “And in a sense, the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises were both born out of that pursuit.”\n\nThe first film both rode and inspired a wave of similar films as studios began clamoring to find the next Y.A. juggernaut. In 2013 and 2014, there were no less than eight teen-centered sci-fi/fantasy films based on best-selling books crammed into theaters: Ender’s Game, The Maze Runner, The Giver, The Host, Beautiful Creatures, Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones, and Divergent.\n\nThese films all adhered to a similar formula: promising up-and-coming actors (Saoirse Ronan, Logan Lerman, Lily Collins) played heroic and/or divinely gifted teenagers with the power to stop a tyrannical leader and/or oppressive government structure. Some were set in the future, others in an alternate universe. Most lured in veteran stars for scenery-chewing supporting roles (Kate Winslet, Jeff Bridges, Viola Davis) or hedged in a watered-down love triangle. And all were angling for a piece of the Hunger Games pie.\n\nMost of those franchises came and went, either fading into the good night (Ender’s Game), forging ahead on sequels with diminishing returns (Maze Runner), or finding better luck on TV (The Mortal Instruments spawned the three-season Freeform show Shadowhunters). But it was the Divergent series, based on Veronica Roth’s popular books, that was best poised to become The Hunger Games’ successor.\n\nSummit Entertainment bought the rights to Divergent in 2011 while concluding Twilight. It would soon be acquired by The Hunger Games studio Lionsgate—merging the top companies responsible for the Y.A. trend. Given their track record and a cast led by J.Law manqué Shailene Woodley, the movie was expected to break through that year’s teen-dystopia noise. “We’re putting it out to our fans right now that we think this is the next big franchise,” Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said at the time.\n\nBut the copy-and-paste elements of the film’s source material hindered its reception. “This is plain generic-brand Hunger Games, and moves at a fatal creep because of it,” Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson wrote in his Divergent review, later adding, “With action scenes that can’t raise a pulse, an expectedly chaste romance, and plodding, formulaic expansion of its mythology, Divergent has the drab sogginess of something reheated. If this dystopic Y.A. stuff is really going to have a life after Katniss has loosed her last arrow, the genre is going to have to figure out some new moves.”\n\nStill, Divergent would go on to make $288 million worldwide, followed by $297 million for its 2015 sequel, Insurgent. While sizable hauls, the numbers paled in comparison to those of The Hunger Games. However, it was 2016’s Allegiant—the first half of a scheduled two-part finale—that delivered the franchise’s death blow. That film opened to a dismal $29 million domestically, coming in second at the box office behind Disney’s Zootopia.\n\nPlans for a series-ender called Ascendant, which was slated for release 15 months after Allegiant, were promptly scrapped. Instead, it was announced that the film would air on television as a Starz TV movie. “No,” Woodley told Vanity Fair when asked about the project at Big Little Lies’ premiere. “I’m not going to be on the television show.” Without involvement from its heroine or an outpouring of public excitement, the project stalled. A spokesperson for Starz (owned by Lionsgate) told BuzzFeed News in 2018 that the franchise was “no longer in active development.”\n\nThe obituaries began rolling in. “Are we witnessing the death of young-adult dystopia at the movies?” the Los Angeles Times asked in March 2016, just eight months before actual dystopia would creep in with the election of Donald Trump. Perhaps the genre’s death was hastened by viewers growing savvy to an oversaturated formula. Then again, when the genre was at its height, the threat of fascism and worldwide conflict felt further away for American audiences—like battles could naively be won by a single all-powerful person raging against the machine.\n\nThough the Hunger Games–esque dystopia has faded, the well for adolescent angst will never run dry. In 2017, Vox’s Constance Grady pointed to Netflix’s 13 Reasons Why and the Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen—a pair of projects about teen suicide—as the next Y.A. cultural wave. And even as The Hunger Games flourished, some studios ran in the complete opposite direction—adapting John Green books like The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns. Netflix has also redefined the teen rom-com for Gen Z, spawning trilogies off the Y.A. novels The Kissing Booth and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.\n\nDystopia has since largely transitioned to television, with The Handmaid’s Tale, Black Mirror, and The Walking Dead—shows that are less about a triumphant One changing the system than a collective group trying to survive it. Two of the past TV season’s most popular series—Netflix’s bingeable Squid Game and HBO’s watercooler hit Euphoria—cover both sides of the societal dystopia/teenage malaise coin. Oddly enough, 2021’s Dune—a burgeoning franchise based on a nearly 60-year-old novel—may be the closest spiritual cinematic successor to The Hunger Games, given its Chosen One narrative and fresh-faced cast that includes Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya."
