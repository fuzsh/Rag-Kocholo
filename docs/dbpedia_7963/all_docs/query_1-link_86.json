        "text": "This table contains data about book sales.\n\nIt has a column for the Genre of the books, the Date they were sold, the Sales Amount, and the Store where they were sold.\n\nBefore you create a PivotTable, the data you are going to use (referred to as Source Data) should be arranged correctly.\n\nAll the columns should have headings. The headings are used to name the fields in the PivotTable.\n\nEach column contains the same type of data, for example, text in one column and currency in another, and there should be no blank rows or columns.\n\nFor this PivotTable, we’ll use source data that is in a table.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be in a table, a range of cells can be used as well.\n\nFor information about using external data, see the article Create a PivotTable to analyze external data.\n\nFor information about using multiple database tables, see Create a PivotTable to analyze data in multiple tables.\n\nThere’s a link to both articles in the course summary at the end of the course.\n\nClick any cell in the data. Click INSERT and PivotTable. All of the source data is automatically selected. In this example, the entire SourceData table.\n\nWe recommend using a table because, if the table grows, the PivotTable will automatically include the new data when you refresh the PivotTable.\n\nFor information about creating a table, see the link Create or delete an Excel table in a worksheet in the course summary.\n\nBy default, the PivotTable will be created on a New Worksheet.\n\nIf you want, you can create it on an existing worksheet instead, by clicking Existing Worksheet and providing the Location. Click OK. In our example, a new worksheet with an empty PivotTable is created.\n\nIn the PivotTable Fields List, at the top, are the fields we’ll use to create the PivotTable.\n\nThey are the same as the column headings in the source data.\n\nAt the bottom are the four areas of a PivotTable; the fields can be added to: ROWS, COLUMNS, VALUES, and FILTERS.\n\nI check the Genre field and it’s added to the PivotTable as rows of text labels.\n\nBy default, text fields are added as rows and numbers as values.\n\nCheck the Sales Amount field and it’s added as a column of values that are added using the SUM function.\n\nRight-click a cell in the Sum of Sales Amount column, click Number Format, and click Currency.\n\nI don’t want any digits after the decimal place, so I set the Decimal places to 0, click OK, and we can see the total sales for the different genres of books.\n\nI click and drag the Store field to COLUMNS, and we can see the sales of genres for each store along with grand totals.\n\nAn important factor we don’t have in the PivotTable yet are dates. How do sales differ over time?\n\nI check the Date field and it’s added to the ROWS area. But this many rows of dates makes the PivotTable hard to use.\n\nLet’s group the list of dates. Right-click any date, and click Group.\n\nI'll use the default, Months, but you can select one or more options, such as Quarters and Years. Click OK.\n\nThe dates are grouped under the genres by month, much easier to work with. And we can see the sales of the genres over time for each store.\n\nWhen you click any cell in a PivotTable, the PivotTable Fields List and the PIVOTTABLE TOOLS tab appear.\n\nWhen you click outside of the table, they go away.\n\nUnder PIVOTTABLE TOOLS, click the DESIGN tab to change how the PivotTable looks.\n\nFor example, click Report Layout, click Show in Outline Form, and now Genre and Date are in separate columns.\n\nCheck Banded Rows to make it easier to read across the rows of the PivotTable.\n\nClick the down-arrow next to PivotTable Styles; there are many options.\n\nWhen you mouse over them, you get a preview of what the PivotTable will look like.\n\nClick the style you want to change the look of the PivotTable.\n\nWe’ll cover the ANALYZE tab in subsequent videos."
