        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe oral mucosal epithelium is a 40-50 cell layer called mucus that is made up of carbohydrates and proteins. The mucosal thickness at the mouth base, tongue, and gums ranges from 100 to 200 µm. The submucosal layer releases a small amount of gel-like fluid known as mucus, consisting of 90%-99% water, 1%-5% water-insoluble glycoprotein, and components such as proteins, enzymes, electrolytes, and nucleic acids. On the other hand, the salivary glands consist of lobules that secrete saliva and parotid from the salivary duct near the sublingual canals and submandibular teeth. Small salivary glands are most often found on the lips and cheek mucosa. The total amount of saliva secreted in 1 min is approximately 1-2 mL. Saliva is composed of mucus, water, amylase (enzyme), lysozyme, mineral salts, immunoglobulins, and blood clotting factors. Mucin and saliva also serve as a barrier for the oral mucosa.1,2\n\nThe mucosal epithelial structure contains two different areas, the membrane of the stratified epithelium, which is a lipophilic area and space between cells, and a more hydrophilic area.3 The oral mucosa has a capability between the intestinal mucosa and the epidermis in terms of permeability to substances.It is estimated that the permeability of the buccal mucosa is 4-4000 times better than that of the skin.2 The mucosal epithelium offers two main drug absorption pathways, the paracellular pathway (intercellular) and the transcellular pathway (intercellular) ( ). The lipophilic structure of the cell membranes facilitates the passage of molecules with a high partition coefficient through the cells, while the polar nature of the intercellular space facilitates the penetration of more hydrophilic molecules. The hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or amphiphilic nature of the drug molecule determines its absorption.2,3\n\nMany pharmaceutical preparations are applied in tablet, granule, powder, and liquid form. In general, a tablet design is in a form presented to patients to swallow or chew a precise dose of medication. However, especially geriatric and pediatric patients have difficulty chewing or swallowing solid dosage forms.4 Therefore, many children and elderly people are reluctant to take these solid dosage forms owing to fear of asphyxiation. Orally dissolving tablets (ODTs) have emerged to meet this need. However, for some patient populations, the fear of swallowing the solid dosage form (tablet, capsule), and the risk of asphyxiation remains despite short dissolution/disintegration times. Oral thin film (OTF) drug delivery systems are a preferable alternative under these conditions. The oral bioavailability of many drugs is insufficient due to the enzymes, common first-pass metabolism, and pH of the stomach. Such conventional drugs have been administered parenterally and have shown low patient compliance. Situations like these have paved way for the pharmaceutical industry to develop alternative systems for the transportation of drugs by developing thin dispersible/dissolving films in the mouth.1,5,6 Fear of drowning, which may be a risk with ODTs, has been associated with these patient groups. Rapid dissolution/disintegration of OTF drug delivery systems is a preferable alternative to ODTs in patients with fear of asphyxiation. When they are placed on the tongue, OTFs are immediately wetted with saliva. As a result, they are dispersed and/or dissolved to release the drug for systemic and/or local absorption. ODTs are fragile and can break during transport. Therefore, oral fast disintegrating/dissolving OTF drug delivery systems are developed as an alternative.7 Differences between OTFs and ODTs are given in .5,8\n\nOral disintegrating/dissolving films or strips can be defined as follows: “These are drug delivery systems that they are quickly releasing the drug by dissolving or adhering in the mucosa with saliva within a few seconds due to it contains water-soluble polymers when it placed in the mouth cavity or on the tongue”. The sublingual mucosa has high membrane permeability due to its thin membrane structure and high vascularization. Due to this rapid blood supply, it offers very good bioavailability.4,9 Enhanced systemic bioavailability is owing to skipping the first-pass effect and better permeability is owing to high blood flow and lymphatic circulation. In addition, the oral mucosa is a very effective and selective route of systemic drug delivery because of the large surface area and ease of application for absorption.6 In general, OTFs are characterized as a thin and flexible polymer layer, with or without plasticizers in their content. They can be said to be less disturbing and more acceptable to patients, as they are thin and flexible in their natural structure. Thin films are polymeric systems that provide many of the requirements expected of a drug delivery system. In studies, thin films have shown their abilities such as improving the initial effect of the drug and duration of this effect, decreasing the frequency of dosing, and increasing the effectiveness of the drug. With thin-film technology, it can be beneficial to eliminate the side effects of drugs and reduce common metabolism procured by proteolytic enzymes. Ideal thin films should possess the desired properties of a drug delivery system, such as a suitable drug loading capacity, rapid dispersion/dissolution, or prolonged application and reasonable formulation stability. Also, they must be nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible.10\n\nThe existence of a variety of biocompatible polymers and variability in production technologies has made it possible to develop a different variety of OTFs. For this reason, OTFs are gaining acceptance and popularity as a new drug carrier dosage form in pharmaceutical technology. A great endeavor has been made to formulate polymeric OTFs that can be delivered via the oral, buccal, sublingual, ocular, and transdermal routes of administration. Among these applications, the use of OTFs for drug delivery across the buccal or sublingual mucosa has gained great attention in recent years. Mechanical strength, related properties, mucoadhesive properties, and drug release rate can also be adjusted by using combinations of polymers, which are the basic structure of thin films, in different proportions. The pharmaceutical industry is affected by the attractive properties of OTFs, and as a result, they are developing thin-film technologies and are currently patenting these formulations.10\n\nAccording to the European Medicines Agency, a thin film that easily dissolves in the oral mucosa is often referred to as an orodispers film. Rapidly dissolving oral films are usually postage stamp-sized OTFs that dissolve/disperse in the oral cavity within 1 min of contact with saliva, resulting in quick absorption and immediate bioavailability of drugs.1,10 These innovative dosage forms are taken orally but do not require water for ingestion and absorption as do conventional drugs.11 OTFs should not be confused with buccal films that are designed to remain on the cheek mucosa for a long time.12"
