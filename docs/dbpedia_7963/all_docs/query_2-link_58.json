And your phony nostalgia about the good old days doesn't impress me.”\n\n\"The Formula\" is, no pun intended, a formulaic yet convoluted film about the Nazis creating an oil substitute. The secret has stayed with the big oil companies, represented by Marlon Brando's character, a bureaucratic heavy who looks like Charlie the Owl in the \"New Zoo Review.\" Lee J.
