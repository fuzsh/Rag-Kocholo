        "text": "F1 is cruising into theaters soon. Last year, Brad Pitt announced he was working on a Formula 1 racing movie—and boy, it looks like he’s about to deliver. The first teaser, which is streaming above, shows him burning rubber to the beat of “We Will Rock You.” In F1, directed by Joseph Kosinski, Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, a new member of the fictional APXGP team, which is led by Javier Bardem. The cast also includes Tobias Menzies, Damson Idris, Sarah Neils, Kim Bodina, and Samson Kayo.\n\nThe cast and crew were spotted at the 2023 British Grand Prix, where Pitt filmed scenes alongside Idris, who costars as fellow driver Joshua Pearce. According to , Kosinski’s production set up camp on the racetrack itself, whipping around an F2 car, setting up shop in its own garage, and trotting out both characters for the national anthem. “I’m a little giddy right now, I’ve got to say,” Pitt told Sky Sports. “It’s great to be here. Having such a laugh, time of my life.”\n\nThe film—which, by the way, has F1 legend Lewis Hamilton on board as a producer—is slated to premiere in North America on June 27, 2025. In the meantime, Pitt did divulge a few details about its plot. “So [Sonny Hayes] has a horrible crash, kind of craps out and disappears and is racing in other disciplines....His friend, played by Javier Bardem, is a team owner. They’re a last-placed owner, 21, 22 on the grid. They’ve never scored a point. They have a young phenom played by Damson Idris. He brings me in as a kind of Hail Mary, and high jinks ensue.”\n\nPitt also hinted that Kosinski will bring back some of his signature camera tricks, à la his last film, Top Gun: Maverick. “Tell you what’s amazing about it,” the actor continued. “You’ll see the cameras mounted all over the car. You’ve never seen speed, you’ve never seen the G-forces like this. It’s really amazing.”\n\nBut I don’t want you to think about that right now. At this very moment? I’d simply like to direct your attention to how damn cool—and believable!—Pitt looks in F1 gear. Look at the shot below. The man’s strutting across the grass in a white suit, which has ads for God-knows-what all over it, and he doesn’t care about the prying journalist and his newsboy cap. He even unzips his suit at the top, because the man is biologically flame-resistant! To hell with it! Sonny Hayes even wears little racing booties, which only Sonny Hayes can pull off.\n\nAnyway, Sonny, if you’re reading this, just know you’re my hero."
