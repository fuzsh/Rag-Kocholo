        "text": "The Formula 1 film currently in production starring Brad Pitt has officially revealed its title: simply, “F1.”\n\nThe Joseph Kosinski-directed film is still shooting — including at this weekend’s British Grand Prix — and being produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, Chad Oman, Dede Gardner, Jeremy Kleiner and Lewis Hamilton. With a release date in June 2025 recently confirmed the film’s name has also been announced, with the “F1” title also incorporating the sport’s official logo on the movie poster.\n\nThe first official teaser for the film will air during this weekend’s coverage of the British Grand Prix, going out at 9:33am ET on Sunday in the build-up to the race start.\n\nFilming has been taking place at multiple races throughout 2023 — the season in which the film will be set — including at Silverstone, Hungaroring, Spa-Francorchamps, Zandvoort, Monza, Las Vegas and Abu Dhabi, while this year races at Suzuka and Mexico City will be added to those locations.\n\nOriginally all filming was due to take place at races in 2023, but the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) strike last year has meant further scenes needed capturing in 2024, including live on-track runs from Pitt at Silverstone this weekend.\n\nFrom Apple Original Films, “F1” will see Pitt starring as a veteran driver who returns to the sport to help a fictional team — APXGP — alongside a teammate played by Damson Idris.\n\nThe film will be distributed in theaters around the world and in IMAX by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on June 25, 2025, and in North America on June 27, 2025."
