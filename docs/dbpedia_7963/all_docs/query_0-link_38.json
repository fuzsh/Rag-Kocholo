        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe low-budget sleeper It Happened One Night (1934), directed by Frank Capra (b. 1897–d. 1991) was the first film to sweep the Academy Awards by winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Writing/Adaptation, a feat that remains rare in Oscar history. However, the more substantial impact of It Happened One Night is evident in its legacy. Well into the early twenty-first century, mainstream cinema continues to reproduce this film’s formula of the unlikely couple who “meet cute” and bicker their way into happily ever after. It Happened One Night is considered the template for the romantic-comedy film and screwball comedy and is also an early “road” film, structured around the bus/car/hitchhiking journey of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) and unemployed reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable). Together they evade the authorities so Ellie can get from Florida to New York and consummate her ill-conceived marriage to a well-heeled playboy. The sexual tension between Ellie and Peter plays out as class conflict, resolved at the film’s conclusion when Ellie runs away from the altar at her high-society wedding, returns to Peter, and honeymoons with him at a humble motel cottage resembling the ones they used—illegitimately but chastely—during their journey. Ellie’s wealthy father, at first an antagonist, becomes the patriarch with the heart of gold who enables Ellie and Peter to unite. Because the 1930 Hays Code was in force while the film was being shot, its sexual innuendoes were primarily conveyed through the witty conversation. Screenwriter Robert Riskin adapted the script from “Night Bus,” a short story by Samuel Hopkins Adams that first appeared in Cosmopolitan magazine in 1933 and got the notice of Capra, who was the leading director at Columbia Pictures at the time. It Happened One Night was the first of several Capra films that secured his reputation as an auteur and as a “populist” Depression-era director. A huge moneymaker for Columbia, the film was rebooked in theaters continuously for nearly a year. It Happened One Night also dramatically enhanced the careers of Gable and Colbert, whose star value increased considerably following their roles as the original screwball couple."
