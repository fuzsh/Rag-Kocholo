        "text": "Start your engines: the teaser for a new Formula 1 racing movie starring Brad Pitt, aptly titled “F1,” has dropped. The Apple Original Films movie also stars Damson Idris.\n\nThe movie follows Pitt as former Formula 1 driver Sonny Hayes, who returns to the sport and partners with and mentors rookie teammate Joshua Pearce (Idris) on the fictional APXGP team. Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo round out the cast for the racing film. Bardem portrays the team boss of APXGP.\n\nFilming for “F1” has taken place at actual Formula 1 events, like last year’s British Grand Prix, the Rolex 24 at Daytona sportscar race this January and more.\n\nThe upcoming British Grand Prix on July 7 will see a special sneak peek, according to a tweet from the official Formula 1 account.\n\nPitt and Idris are also on-site for the July 7 British Grand Prix, where the fictional APXGP has a full hospitality unit in the F1 paddock. They both have driven racing cars as a part of filming, according to The Athletic.\n\nHamilton, who has won plenty of Formula 1 championships himself, has been involved in many aspects of the film, including scriptwriting.\n\nDirected by “Top Gun: Maverick” director Joseph Kosinski, the film is produced by Pitt, Formula 1 star Lewis Hamilton for his Dawn Appolo Films, Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman for Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. The film is made in collaboration with Formula 1. Ehren Kruger, who worked with Kosinski on “Top Gun: Maverick,” wrote the screenplay.\n\n“F1” is currently set to be distributed in theaters by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally on June 25, 2025 and in North America on June 27, 2025.\n\nWatch the trailer below:"
