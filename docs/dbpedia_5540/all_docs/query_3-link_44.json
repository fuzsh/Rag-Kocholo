Oscar translates to “deer lover” or “friend of deer” as derived from the Gaelic “os” (deer) and “cara” (friend).\n\nPatrick\n\nPatrick is the name of the patron saint of Ireland, of course. You know, the St. Patrick who has his own holiday on March 17?\n\nPatty or Paddy\n\nThese nicknames for “Patrick” both work as standalone names, too.\n\nReilly\n\nCalling all Chihuahuas and other ballsy breeds: This name is Irish for “courageous.”\n\nSenan\n\nThe Irish remixed the Latin word for senator to create this name meaning \"old\" or \"wise.”\n\nCute Irish Dog Names\n\nAngus or Aengus\n\nAccording to Celtic legend, the name “Angus” means “one strength” in Gaelic and belonged to the god of love. And what’s the thing that dogs are best at (besides sniffing out treats)? That’s right: love.\n\nBriley\n\nLet’s get technical here – this name literally means “descendant of Brolach,” maybe the perfect name for your bro of a pup?\n\nCarson\n\nThere’s nothing cuter than a dog with a regular human name, and this gender-neutral pick has Irish origins, too.\n\nCarrick\n\nIn Gaelic, this name means “rock.” It’d be extra-perfect for a Bulldog since they’re basically boulders on legs.\n\nColin\n\nThis name, a shortened form of Nicholas, means “pup” in Gaelic. How on the nose is that?\n\nConan\n\nThe name Conan (as in late-night host Conan O’Brien, who’s undeniably Irish) comes from the Gaelic word “con” which means “hound” or “wolf.” And the suffix “an” means “little warrior.”\n\nDarby\n\nWhat’s cuter than a little hound who thinks he’s a warrior?\n\nEiley\n\nThis Irish name sounds adorably quirky, but it has a serious meaning: “Liberty.”\n\nFaraday\n\nIf you have a little chirper on your hands, this name means “beautiful bird” and could easily apply to your dog!\n\nEileen\n\nThis name has such a prestigious ring to it, you better have a bowtie ready upon naming.\n\nFinn or Fionn\n\nAs you sing “Come On, Eileen” to your four-legged friend, know that her name means “desired.”\n\nFitzgerald\n\nFinn is the Anglicized version of Fionn. Both mean “fair-headed” or “white,” making this a precious choice for a dog whose hair is on the lighter side.\n\nFlynn\n\nThe name translates to “son of Gerald” in Gaelic. But more importantly, it sounds like the name of a classy dog who has a vast collection of argyle sweaters.\n\nIrish\n\nAlso the name of the hero in the Disney movie “Tangled,” this name means red, bright red or fiery red. A cute reference to your new dog’s ginger fur, perhaps?\n\nKassady\n\nFor the most Irish of pups, let’s get literal with the name, people.\n\nKegan\n\n“Clever and curly haired” is the definition here, so if it applies to your conniving pooch, go for it.\n\nKinley\n\nTranslating to “little flame,” this name is reserved for the spunkiest of the bunch.\n\nLiam\n\nSignifying “the daughter of the white warrior,” this one feels right for those purebred, solid white pooches.\n\nMadden\n\nLiam means \"resolute protection\" in traditional Gaelic. There’s no better name for a guard dog.\n\nMorna\n\nCalling all hounds! This one means “hound” and has a tough ambiance to it, too.\n\nMurphy\n\nThis name signifies “affection” and is a great pick for a snuggly girl dog.\n\nNuala\n\nMurphy is a common last name in the U.S. and in Ireland, and giving it to a dog adds a whole new level of cuteness. Plus, the name means \"sea warrior\" in Gaelic―perfect for a dog who loves to swim.\n\nO’Malley\n\nPronounced NOO-lah, this is the diminutive of the name Fionnuala, which means “fair shouldered.” Regardless of how attractive your dog’s shoulders are (we’re sure they’re stunning), we also love this name for its charming nickname, “Nu.”\n\nRoisin\n\nThis was an Irish clan surname, and doubles as a super cute first name for a dog.\n\nSullivan\n\nPronounced ROW-sheen, this name means \"little rose” ―a sweet name for a small-breed cutie.\n\nTaisce\n\nThis name is a common Irish last name in the U.S., but it’s also become a popular first name for pets and people alike.

Just don’t take it too literally; you should still keep your pup on a leash in most places.\n\nEnnis\n\nEnnis means “island,” so it’s a great name for an introverted doggo.\n\nGirvin\n\nThis Irish name means “small rough one,” which would be fitting for a Chihuahua with a sassy ’tude and small stature.\n\nMadigan\n\nMeaning “little dog,” this name just sounds like it’s begging for trouble.\n\nOdhran\n\nPronounced O-rawn, the name means \"little pale green one\" in Gaelic. Your dog probably isn’t pale green, but they’ll likely be the only dog on the block with this interesting name.\n\nOona\n\nQuirky and unique, Oona is pronounced exactly how you’d expect.
