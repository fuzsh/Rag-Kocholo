        "text": "A group that organizers say numbered 427 all did simultaneous handstands in Dolores Park on Saturday, attempting to break a Guinness world record set by 399 people in Belgium a decade ago.\n\nAs Mission Local reports, the group, called Handstand, initially came up short by about 50 people, but volunteers went around recruiting others from sunny day picnics in the park, and they now believe they've broken the record Â— they'll be sending footage they took of the event to the Guinness people for review and confirmation.\n\nThe group set up this website to help recruit volunteers and was recently giving handstand lessons as well. Says the website, \"Do you ever read those news stories about really successful 20 and 30 somethings and think 'Wow, what have I done with my life?' Well now you'll have an answer: you helped set a f*cking world record.\"\n\nFollowing the attempt, Handstand posted to Facebook that it was a \"massive success,\" and \"we couldn't have done it without all of you.\"\n\nNext up, on September 9, the group is running an app-based citywide scavenger hunt.\n\nPhoto: Handstand/Facebook"
