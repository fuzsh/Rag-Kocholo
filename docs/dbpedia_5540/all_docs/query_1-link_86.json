She also has a younger brother, Franz-Egon born 1939, and a stepsister, Betsy von Furstenberg, from her fathers previous marriage.\n\nThough some published sources have described Dolores von Fürstenberg as a countess and a princess, she is, in fact, a Freiin (baroness) by birth, according to the last published issue of the Almanach de Gotha. Children of the counts von Fürstenberg-Hedringen are known as Freiherr (baron) or Freiin (baroness), and the sons move up in rank to Graf (count) only if they inherit the primary title.\n\nLater life\n\nAt age 19 she married her stepbrother Patrick Benjamin Guinness[5] (1931–1965), son of Loel Guinness, on 22 October 1955 in Paris. Patrick was killed in a car accident in Turtig near Raron, Switzerland 1965.[6] Have issue:\n\nMaria Alexandra Guinness Cook (born 1956) married Foulques, Count de Quatrebarbes (born 1948) in 1979.

She often appeared on the International Best Dressed List during these years."
