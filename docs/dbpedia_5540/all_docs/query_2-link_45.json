        "text": "Bravo fans live for a good, old-fashioned love story. Thus is the case with Dolores Catania. Fans first met her on the Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 7 back in 2016. The mother of two was divorced from Frank Catania but living an unconventional life. She and her ex-husband decided to stay on good terms for the children’s sake even though the former lawyer cheated on his devoted wife.\n\nBut over the last two years, Dolores has found the spark of love again thanks to her Irish beau, Paul Connell. Fans haven’t seen Dolo any happier since she fell into this relationship. The entire family unit is still intact, and Frank has given his blessings, which is all we can ever ask for.\n\nThe meet-cute\n\nIn December 2021, news broke that Dolores had snagged herself a man. The two met the old-fashioned way, on a blind date. But coincidentally, both their phones broke three days prior to their date, and they ended up meeting at the phone store. The duo started to date during Season 12 filming, unbeknownst to producers. It makes sense that Dolores was nervous about bringing the Dublin native onto the famed series. I mean, there is the Real Housewives curse.\n\nValentine’s Day\n\nIn February 2022, Dolores made her love Instagram official with a gushy post. While posing together, the mother of two wrote, “Together is better always ???? Stay tuned.”\n\nOctober 2022\n\nWhile at BravoCon, Dolores’s son gave fans a much-needed update. Frankie Catania told fans, “I don’t know how great he fits in with my dad, and I’m just being honest here. They both have very manly, alpha personalities, you know? So, I don’t think they gel perfectly, but they’re settling the differences. They are both amazing people, so they’re kind of finding their way through that.” Even though the message seemed ominous, fans watched during Season 13 as the two macho men met up.\n\nPaul seemed a bit apprehensive about Dolores’ close friendship with her ex, not understanding why she would still want to depend on him. But after an uncomfortable dinner, the men seemed to find solid ground. Paul could see how important the family unit was to his girlfriend, and now fans can see the entire family taking snaps together and enjoying the blended family.\n\nIreland or bust!\n\nAt the end of 2022, Paulie took his beloved back to Ireland for a proper introduction to Dublin. Dolores posted multiple photos of their adventure, writing, “One of the best gifts in the world is a lifetime of adventures. What an amazing trip home.” Perhaps the most important part of the trip was when Dolores met Paul’s mother. The two hit it off immediately.\n\nSadly, Paul’s mother passed away this year. However, the Irish businessman made sure to acknowledge the special relationship she had with Dolores. The father of two wrote, most I am so happy she got to meet my rock, my support and my love who has been by my side #? and who she fell in love with just as fast as I did?My mam gained a new pal, someone she adored & loved and was so happy to be around ?”\n\nPaul appears on RHONJ\n\nWhen Season 13 premiered in February 2023, so did Paul. Fans finally saw the couple in all their glory. Even though a lot of conversations revolved around their relationship, Paul took it all in stride, even when a massive fight broke out at his home between the cast.\n\nSeason 14\n\nAs RHONJ fans might remember, Paul is still legally married despite being separated for 14 years. The sneak peek of the trailer shows Dolores and Paul having some hard-hitting conversations about the state of their relationship. However, during the Season 13 reunion, Paul noted that his ex “knows I would never bring someone around my children that I did not respect. And Dolores is the first woman that I’ve ever brought around my kids, and I have been separated for over 14 years.”\n\nSo, it seems like Dolores and Paul are still on the same path for love. Season 14 will show fans just how well they are getting along and how much they have progressed. Hopefully, Paul can still handle the heat and let this season’s drama roll right off his back because our Dolo deserves her happy ending!"
