        "text": "When Bob Hope looks back on the long lap of honor that is his life, he likes to tell a story about his vaudeville beginnings. In about 1928, not long after he’d started doing gags onstage, he was playing the Orpheum Theatre in Evansville, Indiana, and he noticed that his newly minted name had been wrongly billed as “Ben Hope, Comedian.” In Hope’s gruelling slog to stardom, which he didn’t reach until he was in his late thirties, his name underwent a number of transformations. He had entered the world, in 1903, as Leslie Townes Hope, but once he’d found the stage, as a song-and-dance man, the name changed from “Leslie” to the more masculine “Lester.” When comedy gradually emerged as Hope’s meal ticket, the name mutated again. Although his clippings have a few references to “Bill” and “Bobby,” he settled on “Bob Hope”—not just because it read well on a marquee but because it had, he said, “more ‘Hiya, fellas’ in it.” So when he saw the Orpheum’s misprint the cocksure young comic buttonholed the theatre manager and upbraided him for the mistake. As Hope recalls their exchange, on an A&E Biography film, “ ‘What’s your name?’ the manager said. I said, ‘Bob Hope.’ He said, ‘Who knows?’ ”\n\nHope, who has a self-confessed “hatred of anonymity,” kept a picture of the Evansville billing in his archive. “The fascinating thing to me is that he has a picture of it,” his elder son, Tony, told me about his father, who stopped performing in 1995 and for the past few years has not been up to giving interviews. “He knew that in twenty years it would be a historic picture. That’s his foresight. That’s his drive. ‘Everybody’s gonna know who Bob Hope is.’ ” Hope is unique among the great entertainers of the century in having been at some point in his long, well-organized career No. 1 in radio, in film, and in television. “I’ve a terrible fear of being hijacked to a country where they’ve never heard of me,” he joked in 1970. It was a nightmare that came to pass only once—when he visited Russia, in the late fifties. “I don’t mind being killed, but ignored—never.”\n\nSince the nineteen-forties, the name “Bob Hope” has been part of the Western world’s ozone. He has lived to see it not just in lights but in many other incarnations. There is the U.S.N.S. Bob Hope, the second-largest ship in the Navy; the C-17 jet fighter the Spirit of Bob Hope; G.I. Bob, a popular Hasbro doll; the Bob Hope/Chrysler Desert Golf Classic, in Palm Springs; Bob Hope High School for the physically handicapped, in Port Arthur, Texas; and the Hope Memorial Bridge, in Cleveland, Ohio (his father, who was a stonemason, worked on it). There are Bob Hope Theatres in Dallas and in Eltham, England, which was his birthplace; and a Bob Hope Street and Off-Ramp in Burbank, near NBC, where his sixty-year association with the network, which ended in 1997, has earned him a place in the “Guinness Book of World Records” for the longest contract with a single network. Hope’s name has even been affixed to the planet’s animal and plant life: the Bob Hope prize steer, the Bob Hope rose, the Bob Hope fern, which is green on top with black roots. “You’ve captured me completely,” he wrote to the Chicago Horticultural Society, which cultivated the plant.\n\nAt ninety-five, Hope is nearly as old as the century, and he personifies its brash deliriums. His obsession with output, aggrandizement, and fame belongs to the modern era, particularly in this country. Hope, who joked in the late sixties that he left England when he was four “because I found out I could never be King,” has established his own American kingdom. He still sends out six thousand Christmas cards a year. His 1998 press kit—“95 Years of Hope”—includes news of a congressional resolution making him an Honorary Veteran and of his receiving an honorary British knighthood; some publicity photographs; and a joke sheet about his getting old, which reads, in part, “It feels great to be 95. I mean, for those parts of me that still have feeling.” Nowadays, Hope can’t see very well and frequently refuses to wear a hearing aid (“They can hear what I’m saying,” he says), but the celebrity machine he put in place more than half a century ago grinds efficiently on. Hope appears in another “Guinness Book of World Records” entry, as the world’s “most decorated civilian.” “I feel very humble,” he said to President Kennedy when he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal in 1963, “but I think I have the strength of character to fight it.” His appetite for adulation remains unabashed; even in his dotage, he is still, as he famously sang, “Available”:\n\nIf you’re handing out a plaque Or a special little statue I’ll go home and pack And I’ll soon be looking at you!\n\nJust two years before a very young Hope arrived at Ellis Island, in 1908, dressed in two sets of clothes to save luggage, Henry Adams wrote in his autobiography, about the American century’s new dynamism and prosperity, “All the new forces condensed into corporations were demanding a new type of man—a man with ten times the endurance, energy, will and mind of the old type.” The great vaudeville clowns who preceded Hope—Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, Weber and Fields, Eugene and Willie Howard, Bobby Clark—acted out the deracinating momentum of the new century in their frenzy and their pratfalls. They were a noisy, rumpled, constitutionally unclubbable bunch. Their baggy excess and their dialects broadcast their separation from the mainstream: they were parodies of the new corporate energy.\n\nHope, on the other hand, personified it. He was a bright package of assimilated poise and pragmatism—the all-American average guy. There was no hint of the streets or the Old Country in his patter. “I simply can’t tell a dialect joke,” he says in his 1954 memoir, “Bob Hope’s Own Story: Have Tux, Will Travel.” In their manic bravado, the older generation of funnymen gave off a whiff of immigrant desperation and sadness at what had been left behind. Hope was all future. The wrinkles had been pressed out of his suits and out of his personality. He was an anxiety-free, up-to-the-minute, fast-talking go-getter on holiday. Dapper, streamlined, and cunning, Hope was the first corporate comedian. He gave what one NBC vice-president called “a lot of extra value for his money.” He attended sales conventions, schmoozed the press, golfed with the corporate bigwigs. In his radio days, between 1938 and 1956, he was usually photographed behind an NBC mike; he found a way of linking the sponsors’ brand names with his own (“This is Bob Pepsodent/Chrysler/Lever Brothers Hope”). Even in many of his seventy-odd films, Hope made sure that the jokes mythologized his corporate bosses. In “Road to Morocco” (1942), when he is perched on a camel behind Bing Crosby, singing the title song, it’s Crosby who boasts “For any villains we may meet / We haven’t any fear,” and Hope who invokes the blessings of management: “Paramount will protect us / ’Cause we’re signed for five more years.”\n\nWhen the Old Guard clowns, like W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers, were brought into the corporate fold, they fought with it continually or, like Keaton, were destroyed by it. Hope embraced the corporate idea and turned himself into a kind of comic franchise. “He discovered a formula for comedy that was better than what anyone else was doing, and he sought to expand it, not in depth, but in breadth,” Tony Hope wrote me. “He put together a machine that spread the word to ninety per cent of the globe that when you said ‘ad-lib’ or ‘standup’ you meant Bob Hope, or a cheap imitation of him.” As Hope said in the mid-fifties, “Between television, my daytime and nighttime radio shows, pictures, and personal appearances, I’m also working on a plan where, when you close your eyes, I appear on the inside of your eyelids.” NBC, Paramount, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and the United States military establishment were his co-producers, and those alliances made him a very rich man: conservative estimates of his wealth—at one time he owned a large portion of the San Fernando Valley, Malibu, and Palm Springs—are said to be between a hundred million and two hundred million dollars. (In 1983, Forbes put Hope’s worth at more than two hundred million dollars, a figure he loudly disputed.) His product, like the corporations he served, was efficient, mass-produced, omnipresent, iconic. In his hands, laughter became an art of non-friction; his jokes went down as easily as Coca-Cola, and he, too, was the pause that refreshed.\n\nLike any shrewd C.E.O., Hope believed in careful product planning. He employed as many as five press agents at a time, and he brought his particular combination of gall and good-enough looks onstage with a distinctive swagger: chest out, body pitched forward on the balls of his feet, hands cupped behind his swinging arms—as Jack Benny quipped, like a headwaiter trying to get a tip. “He came on as if he were carrying a great weight of almost civic dignity in front of him,” Sir Laurence Olivier once told the BBC. “It’s very amusing.” Hope also established a kind of joke factory, which has remained intact from the late thirties until today. (Even now, he keeps a skeleton crew of two writers on retainer.) “I believe I was the first of the comedians to admit openly that I employed writers,” Hope told William Faith in 1981, in “Bob Hope: A Life in Comedy,” which is perhaps the best book about him. “In the early years of radio, comedians fostered the illusion that all of those funny sayings came right out of their own skulls.”\n\nIn the course of the last half century, eighty-eight jokesmiths—sometimes as many as thirteen at a time—have been on Hope’s payroll, and have provided him with upward of a million jokes. (“Hope?” Groucho Marx once said. “Hope is not a comedian. He just translates what others write for him.”) “When you signed on for Bob Hope, you were at his beck and call seven days a week,” I was told by Melville Shavelson, one of his first joke writers, who later went on to co-write two of Hope’s strongest films, “Sorrowful Jones” and “The Seven Little Foys,” which he also directed. Hope’s reliance on writers became part of his shtick. “I keep an earthquake emergency kit in my house,” he said. “It’s filled with food, water, and a half a dozen writers.” Among the writers, one of Hope’s nicknames was Piggy. “Hope was a glutton,” says Hal Kanter, who wrote not only jokes but also seven movies for Hope. “ ‘More, more, more. I want more jokes. I want more dates to play. I want more ice cream. I want more women. I want more applause.’ ” Hope was notorious for calling his jokesmiths at any time of the day or night. The writers’ acronym for this sudden intrusion was “naft”—“need a few things.” Larry Gelbart, who began writing for Hope in 1948, at the age of twenty, recalls one style of Hope phone call: “ ‘Oh, you didn’t wake me, Bob.’ Four-thirty in the morning. He’d say, ‘Lar . . . ?’ ‘Yeah, Bob?’ Then, silence, silence, silence. These extremely long pauses, which made you feel you oughta say something. He had this very funny way on the phone.” In later years, when Hope was calling his writers he formed the habit of not identifying himself or saying “Hello” or “How ya doin’?” He’d just say, “Thrill me.”\n\nJokes were not merely Hope’s livelihood but a defining part of his identity. “Bob was a manufactured personality, constructed out of jokes,” says Sherwood Schwartz, another of his early radio writers, who went on to create and produce “Gilligan’s Island” and “The Brady Bunch.” In time, Hope’s writers were called upon to provide jokes even for his golf tournaments and his dinner parties. One recent writer, Martha Bolton, remembers a phone message from her boss: “Hi, this is Bob Hope. I’m trying to find my writers. Gene’s off speaking somewhere. Mills is golfing. Si and Freddie are gone and just have their answering machine on. And you’re probably out shopping. . . . Didn’t I used to have a career?”\n\nIn May of this year, Hope announced the donation of his archive of jokes, radio broadcasts, video master tapes, film and radio scripts, photographs, and clippings books to the Library of Congress, along with three and a half million dollars to preserve the collection and to outfit a thirteen-hundred-square-foot room in the Jefferson Building which is to be called the Bob Hope Gallery of American Entertainment. Hope is careful about the company he keeps: his gallery will be next to the Gershwin Room. Until recently, a good portion of his memorabilia was collected in an outbuilding that served as the office for Hope and his staff. It sits about fifty paces from his Toluca Lake home—a six-and-three-quarter-acre former walnut grove, on the wrong side of the Hollywood Hills, which Hope bought in 1937 for about forty thousand dollars. He and his wife of sixty-four years, Dolores, with whom he has four adopted children, have turned it into a luxuriant oasis of rolling manicured lawns, dominated by a one-hole pitch-and-putt golf course whose sand trap and green are visible from Hope’s three-room suite on the second floor. He spends much of his time there now, watching gigantic local crows mill around the orange-flagged pin.\n\nOn the surface, life at the Hopes’ home goes on as usual. Gardeners primp the hibiscus and rake the leaves in the shadow of towering redwood and eucalyptus trees, which block out almost all of downtown Burbank, except for the logo of the Texaco Building, which brands part of their blue horizon above the tree line. Employees bustle from the house past a fountain filled with an exotic carrotwood tree and into the office; Hope’s white German shepherds, Sno’el and Snowjob, Jr., prowl ten-foot-high hedges of blue-flowering plumbago which extend around the property and shut out the flat, blistering banality of the Valley streets. But over at the office, in the large mahogany study where Hope once met with his writers, an archivist has been at work since March cataloguing the trophies of Hope’s lifetime in entertainment: three warehouses full of memorabilia, including fifty-four honorary degrees, five hundred keys to various cities, a golf club inscribed from Lana Turner, a piece of Queen Elizabeth’s wedding cake, Eddy Foy’s dance shoes, the propeller of an enemy plane signed by the soldiers who shot it down, and an open pack of Vietcong cigarettes and matches—the gift of a P.O.W., and one of Hope’s most cherished mementos. For comedians like Hope, who have lived their lives largely in public, retirement is particularly poignant. Hope has not visited his old offices in a year, and his study has been denuded of its old sense of life and victory: the marlin over the fireplace is gone, the signed footballs from the N.F.L., the Big Ten, and the A.P. All-America teams are gone, and the four Emmy Awards have been packed away. In time, some of these artifacts will find their way to the Bob Hope Museum of Comedy, which will probably be built on a piece of property that Hope owns just opposite NBC.\n\nIn this divesting of corporate assets, the major one is the Joke File, which has been winnowed down to a select five hundred and twenty-eight thousand gags. This is Hope’s treasury, and he has put a huge emotional and financial investment into it; appropriately, it’s housed in an eight-by-five-foot Mosler bank vault. The archive comprises twelve four-drawer cabinets, five of them containing “keepers” that Hope has approved to be sent to Washington. It has a “Subject File for Gags,” which begins with “Academy Awards, Advertising, Agriculture, Airplanes” and ends, twenty-eight pages later, with “War, Weather, Weddings, Women, Writers.” Jokes are also cross-referenced within the categories. For instance, under “America” is printed: “Bicentennial, Constitution, historical American figures, progress over a hundred years, small towns, only in America, beginning. also see hope special routines (America Past, Present, Future).” Even though the contents are considered “Bob Hope jokes,” he wrote very few of them: he edited them, gave voice to them, and paid tens of millions of dollars for them over the years. (Recently, the going rate has been between fifty and seventy-five dollars for an individual joke; his staff writers make between a hundred and fifty thousand and two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year.) By contract, the jokes are Hope’s intellectual property—an expression of his will, if not of his self. “The way I justify that in my own head is that the jokes are the result of a character that Hope created,” says Gene Perret, who has written for Hope for nearly thirty years. “Many of the jokes that we do we wouldn’t do if there were no Bob Hope.”\n\nThe jokes have been retyped, without attribution, about seven to a page, onto quarto sheets of paper with the date, place, and subject in the upper left-hand corner. One picked at random from the “America” file reads:\n\nAmerica. Honor America Day, 7/4/70 Where else but in America could the Women’s Liberation Movement take off their bras, then go on TV to complain about their lack of support.\n\nFrom the outset, topicality was Hope’s trademark. Many of the files are devoted to historical and show-biz figures. One file—an entire ream of jokes—is about Bing Crosby, his comic sidekick in the “Road” movies and the butt of a long-running public slinging match. (“I’ve been getting more exercise from my golf recently. I used to play a round with Crosby, now I just play around Crosby.”) The files are also available on a computer database, so pages of jokes on a desired subject can be called up at the touch of a button. About certain recent historical figures, however, the system comes up curiously empty. There are no jokes in the file on Senator Joseph McCarthy, Malcolm X, or Martin Luther King, Jr., although Hope did joke about all three in their day, including one infamous gag at the 1968 Academy Awards ceremony, which had been delayed two days because of King’s assassination: “About the delay . . . It didn’t affect me, but it’s been tough on the nominees. How would you like to spend two days in a crouch?”\n\nIn raising a laugh, Hope’s jokes rarely raise ideas. Long before Vietnam, he was a kind of one-man pacification program who disabused both the public and himself of pain. “My youth was spent in a very tough neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio,” he said in a TV monologue. “If you didn’t get in three fights a day, you weren’t trying.” Jokes provided Hope, who left school when he was nine, with an upbeat life script from which he rarely deviated. “I don’t make a hobby of mental turmoil,” he wrote in “Have Tux, Will Travel.” “I don’t think most people want that.” Indeed, what the public wants is forgetfulness, and Hope, whose sharp comic persona came into focus in the thirties, at a time when America’s promise seemed dim, lightened grave times. As one early radio broadcast intoned, “Strike up the band! Bob Hope’s the man / Who ties the cans to woe!”\n\nHope was the fifth of six boys, whose parents, even before they emigrated, had been floundering for a decade. William Henry Hope, called Harry, had married Avis Townes, the daughter of a Welsh sea captain, in 1891. Harry was a drinker and a gambler, who dreamed of becoming an architect; he shunted his ever-increasing family around England, seeking stonemasonry work and a new beginning. The Hopes moved six times before and three times after Leslie was born, and ended up in Bristol before leaving for America. (The family became United States citizens in 1920.) Avis put all her energy into her family; while Harry tried his luck in Cleveland, where his two brothers had put down roots, she was essentially a single parent. “Believe me, Avis,” her profligate husband wrote to her about life in America, “when you get here, all you’ll have to do is sit on the front porch and chew gum.”\n\nBut Harry’s reports from the New World proved exaggerated. Steel, not stone, was the material of the century’s expansion, and Harry often had no work. He drowned his disappointment in drink while Avis rented out rooms in their house to make money. “I remember Dad saying, ‘The United States is a fine place for women and dogs. It’s a poor place for horses and men,’ ” Hope wrote. “He had trouble adjusting himself to this country. I don’t think he ever did.” Hope was the family optimist, but, according to Leslie’s sister-in-law Wynn Hope, who was the wife of his brother Jim, Harry Hope was the family funnyman. “The father was the original comedian,” she once told Mel Shavelson. “He drank too much, and when he didn’t come home for dinner the boys would go around and they’d find him entertaining in a bar. He had a wonderful sense of humor.”\n\nOver the years, as Harry continued to drink and grew increasingly pathetic and abusive, Avis turned to her boys for both financial and emotional support. She put them all on a pedestal; each son believed himself to be her favorite. (“Mother Had Hopes” is the piquant title of a memoir that Jim Hope wrote.) Avis took Leslie to see the legendary monologuist Frank Fay, who was one of the big comedy stars of his day, and who invented the profession of vaudeville master of ceremonies—a role that Hope later adopted. “He’s not half as good as you,” Avis said to her son loudly, forcing Hope to slump in his seat with embarrassment. But it was Avis’s fierce faith in her son’s ability which gave Hope the self-confidence that Fred Allen once observed he “reeked of,” and which kept him, one way or another, on that pedestal.\n\nEven when he was a kid, before the stage focussed Hope’s enormous, restive energy, action was the magical antidote to whatever weighed him down. (“It’s no coincidence that Bob Hope’s name consists of two verbs,” Larry Gelbart writes in his recent memoir, “Laughing Matters,” about Hope’s “incredible bursts of brio.”) The boy, who was a chronic sleepwalker and lived with the unhappy daily spectacle of his father cowed by fear and regret, would later be dubbed Rapid Robert. He had big ambitions but no stomach for work. As a bakery delivery boy, he shook down customers for extra cash. He hustled prize money at local footraces with a series of underhanded strategies (jumping the gun, bumping opponents), and also flirted briefly with boxing. Calling himself Packy East, he won his first amateur bout by hitting his opponent while the fellow was looking to his corner for instructions. In his next—and last—fight, Hope was knocked out. “This fellow hit me so hard I bounced right into dancing school,” he told the BBC in 1973. Hope studied dancing long enough to take over his instructor’s class and teach it for a while. (“Leslie Hope Will Teach You How to Dance—Clog, Soft-Shoe, Waltz-Clog, Buck and Wing, and Eccentric,” read some cards he had printed.) And dance was what put Hope onstage: he was hooked from the minute he got paid for the routine he’d worked up with his willowy blond girlfriend and first partner, Mildred Rosequist, in 1920. He wrote in “Have Tux, Will Travel,” “We’d make seven or eight bucks and I split it with her.” In fact, he chiselled her: according to Rosequist, he told her that their performances were for charity and pocketed the money.\n\nHope had larceny in his soul. As a teen-ager, he was jailed briefly for stealing tennis balls and racquets from a sporting-goods shop, according to Lawrence J. Quirk’s recent biography. “Like most kids today or any day, I had to make my choice,” Hope joked about his criminal record in a monologue for the Boys’ Club, in 1967. “Was I going to go out and get a job and earn a living, or was I going to spend the rest of my life stealing? I decided to forget the job and stay with show business.” To Hope, who referred to comedy as a “scam,” laughter was another way of getting away with something. When he first began making good money on Rudy Vallee’s “Fleischmann Yeast Hour,” in 1930, Hope recalled, “I used to get the money and run around the corner and count it. . . . Like I was stealing it. And with my act I think mostly of theft.” The shame and misery of Hope’s childhood had robbed him of pleasure, ease, and a degree of playfulness; in a way, Hope “lifted” his father’s sense of humor and reversed the vectors of their destinies. Harry, who worked in stone, had been overtaken by changing times, which made him obsolete; Hope, who worked in words, exploited changing times, which made him always up to date. In this psychological sleight of hand, lightness replaced gravity, profit replaced waste, and son replaced father as the family provider. As Hope’s act evolved over the decades, it became the slickest of cultural hustles. “What I really am is a liar,” Hope wrote in “Don’t Shoot, It’s Only Me,” a book about his comedy. In myriad rascal roles (Turkey Jackson in “Road to Morocco,” Painless Peter Potter in “The Paleface,” the eponymous “Lemon Drop Kid”), or even as himself, in “Welcome to Britain,” a 1943 instructional film for United States troops in England, wherein he explains English coinage to Burgess Meredith only to shortchange him, Hope enjoyed playing the impostor who admitted his larceny but still happily practiced it. Onscreen and off, he won the public’s heart and picked its pocket at the same time.\n\nOnce, during a rehearsal for “Roberta,” the 1933 musical that would make Hope a Broadway star, the show’s composer, Jerome Kern, turned to him and asked, “How the hell did you get this ease on the stage?” Hope answered, “Mr. Kern, you don’t know what I’ve been through.” What Hope had been through was thirteen years of vaudeville, which taught the lessons of free enterprise: thrift, self-reliance, perseverance, innovation, and ruthlessness. It was a paradigm of Darwinian struggle, in which only the fittest performers survived the schedule, the audiences, and one another. “You came out battling and you protected yourself at all times,” Hope said of vaudeville. With so many partings, disappointments, ambitions, and tempers, vaudevillians, who worked and lived in close quarters on the road, learned to keep to themselves. Hope’s guard was never down. To this day, he will frequently exclaim genially, “I’nnat great?” or “I’nnat something?” Steve Allen says, “You could have said, ‘I’m having a heart attack,’ and he’d say, ‘I’nnat something?’ To me that’s not an appropriate response.” But it’s the vestige of an old vaudeville stratagem: a show of interest which belies selfinvolvement. Hope was always watching himself go by: detachment added to his glamour onstage and to his solitude off it. “I don’t feel that I really know him,” his elder daughter, Linda Hope, who has been her father’s producer for more than a decade, told me. “That’s a kind of sadness for me, because I would have liked to know him better.” Linda’s former husband, the writer Nathaniel Lande, says of Hope, “You never get into the inner space. Too threatening. Too vulnerable. I don’t think anybody has ever gotten there. It’s undiscovered.” He adds, “And once you get there, there may be nothing there. We’ll never know.”\n\nHope was discovered in 1924 by the comedian Fatty Arbuckle, who got Hope into “tab shows”—minimusicals in which Hope and his third dance partner, George Byrne, toured small-town America, first in “Hurley’s Jolly Follies” and then in “Smiling Eyes” (both in 1925). “As far as stage presence and confidence, it did more for me than anything else,” Hope said later. Afterward, billing themselves first as Dancing Demons and then as Dancemedians, Hope and Byrne worked their way up the food chain of variety entertainment, which included dancing with the Hilton Sisters, Siamese twins of some notoriety (“They’re too much of a woman for me,” Hope joked), and, in 1927, talking their way into a Broadway musical, “Sidewalks of New York.” (This break turned into a bust when beefed-up production numbers by the show’s stars made the pair’s hoofing extraneous.) Before Broadway, Hope and Byrne had worked jokes in between dance; now they decided to work dance in between jokes:\n\nHope: Where do the bugs go in the wintertime? Byrne: I don’t know, you can search me.\n\nThe act bombed, and a William Morris agent told Hope bluntly, “You ought to go West, change your act, and get a new start.” Working their way back to the Midwest, the disheartened team accepted an engagement on a bill in New Castle, Pennsylvania, where the manager asked Hope as a favor to come out after the last act and announce the next week’s entertainment. One of the upcoming acts was a rube comic, whose stock-in-trade was tightfisted-farmer jokes. “Ladies and gentlemen,” Hope declared, “next week Marshall Walker will be here with his Big Time Revue. Marshall is a Scotsman. I know him. He got married in the back yard so the chickens could get the rice.” The audience roared; Hope’s standup career had begun.\n\nWithin a few months, armed with a small derby, a big red bow tie, white cotton gloves, and a cigar, he was working solo in blackface for a lowly “rotary unit,” which played a different theatre in Cleveland each night. “I scored well even if I was scoring in a minor league,” Hope said. Four nights into the gig, he missed his trolley, and rushed to the theatre and onto the stage without makeup. “Don’t ever put that cork on again. Your face is funny the way it is,” the manager told him. This unwelcome news was Hope’s first major comic discovery. “I’d thought my profile handsome in a dark, smoldering way, and discovering somebody thought it amusing was a shock,” he said. Hope’s lantern jaw and ski-jump nose—his slightly skewed good looks—made audiences more accepting of his brazenness. He soon got work in Chicago as an m.c. at the Stratford Theatre, where he stretched a two-week engagement into six months. “I worked fast, snappy, and impish,” he said. Hope’s jokes were not really trenchant, but his speed made up for it. By then he was earning three hundred dollars a week and was scrambling to find new material.\n\nAlthough Hope’s subsequent contracts with his writers would include paying them to come up with comic “poses,” his easygoing manner was one pose he evolved on his own, in vaudeville—his “sneak attack,” he called it. “I make a line seem like nothing. It’s the opposite of hitting a joke too hard,” he observed. In a way, Hope’s self-expression was not in what he said but in how he said it. In “Roberta,” for instance, he argued and finally won a battle with the librettist to change the segue into one of the show’s best songs, “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.” Otto Harbach’s book introduced the song with the line “There’s an old Russian proverb—‘When your heart’s on fire, smoke gets in your eyes.’ ” Hope’s contribution topped it with a laugh that caught the cultural mood of romantic disenchantment. “We have a proverb over here in America, too,” he said. “‘Love is like hash. You have to have confidence in it to enjoy it.’” The wisecrack and others like it defined him as that comic cousin of the American booster: the card, a glad-handing showoff eager to disguise his depths. Hope’s breeziness, which in later years he emphasized by walking onstage with a golf club, disguised the immodesty of his ego and the agility of his mind. When Hope was making his début as a solo performer in the revue “Ballyhoo of 1932,” the curtain was late one night because the chorus girls weren’t ready. In the midst of pandemonium, the producer Lee Shubert sent Hope out to calm the audience. “Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first time I’ve ever been on before the acrobats,” Hope began. He waved to someone in the balcony and said, “Hello, Sam.” He then explained, “That’s one of our backers up there. He says he’s not nervous, but I notice that he’s buckled his safety belt.” Hope stayed on for six minutes; by the time he was through, the producers had decided to let him warm up the audience every night.\n\nOn Broadway, Hope had some showstopping moments with classic songs—including Cole Porter’s “It’s De-Lovely,” with Ethel Merman, in “Red, Hot and Blue!” (1936), and “I Can’t Get Started,” with Eve Arden, in “Ziegfeld Follies of 1936”—but not with classic comic material. “Bob Hope has a slick, humorous style of delivery which ought to put him in the front rank of talking bandmasters as soon as he gets something to say which does not bring the blush of shame to his cheeks,” Robert Benchley wrote in these pages about “Roberta.” Hope’s onstage ad-libbing generated more humor and attention than the show’s lacklustre libretto. While singing a verse of “It’s De-Lovely” in “Red, Hot and Blue!” Ethel Merman was not amused to discover Hope lounging at her feet; she told the producer, “If that so-called comedian ever behaves like that again I’ll use my shoe to remodel his ski nose.” Later, Merman said, “I’d rather bed with a porcupine than share the stage with that bastard.”\n\nBy the mid-thirties, Hope had acquired a Pontiac with his name on it, a beautiful, devoted wife, and a high-powered agent, Louis Schurr. He had all the accoutrements of success except good material. One Broadway critic wrote, “Bob Hope has something, but you don’t notice it if you’re sitting five rows back”; even on radio, where he made frequent guest appearances, he was said by Variety in 1935 to be “easy to take, but hard to remember.” But Hope made up in perspiration what he lacked in inspiration. “I used to do four shows a day in vaudeville, then drop into a night club,” he said. “I might do thirty or forty minutes off the cuff. I thought nothing of working from twelve noon to one o’clock the next morning.” He did benefits, he networked, he developed material. Hope was never anybody’s first choice for the shows that became his triumphs. He was offered “Roberta” after William Gaxton turned it down; “The Big Broadcast of 1938,” which gave Hope both his theme song, “Thanks for the Memory,” and started his movie career, had been meant for Jack Benny; and “Road to Singapore,” which was the first in a fabulous string of “Road” movies, had been offered to Burns and Allen and then to Fred MacMurray and Jack Oakie before the producers hit upon Hope and Crosby.\n\nHope did have one piece of luck: he came into his prime just as the talking pictures and radio were demanding the posture of ease—the illusion of authenticity which was Hope’s biggest performing asset. Daniel Boorstin writes in “The Americans,” about the emergence of mass media, “Naturalness itself was becoming a rare commodity which individual citizens were willing to pay for, while being (or at least seeming) natural became a special political talent.” By 1941, when fewer than ten per cent of Americans were paying taxes on more than ten thousand dollars, Hope was earning about half a million dollars; both advertisers and statesmen were selling the system, and Hope’s jokes, which were sharp but not barbed, created a sense of happy cohesion. (Not surprisingly, Hope was once asked to run as a Republican candidate for President.) “You have a nice show here,” he told an audience in 1932, at a time when Hoover was using the motto “Prosperity’s just around the corner,” setting up the biggest topical laugh he ever got in vaudeville: “I was just standing out in front watching the other acts when a lady walked up to me in the lobby and said, ‘Pardon me, young man, could you tell me where I could find the rest room?’ and I said, ‘It’s just around the corner.’ ‘Don’t give me that Hoover talk,’ she said. ‘I gotta go.’ ” Hope’s gibes rarely drew blood. “I can’t afford to go out and start knocking Democrats and knocking Republicans, because I’m usually selling a product everybody buys and I don’t want to alienate any part of my audience,” he said. In the end, he found that audience not on Broadway, where he was just a local star, but on radio, where, after 1938, he was a national figure. Radio also provided Hope with the one crucial ingredient missing from his rapid-fire stage patter: a comic character.\n\n\"We should take care to prevent your being a smart alec,” Hope’s agent Jimmy Saphier wrote in a prescient 1938 letter about Hope’s upcoming Pepsodent radio show. “Let’s try to build a lot of sympathy for your character, and have the rest of the cast bounce their jokes off you . . . as only sympathetic comedians have a chance for long life on the air.” Unless Hope was carefully watched, his trademark brashness could seem like contempt. The character we know as Bob Hope grew over two years “like a weed,” according to one of his writers. “We never told Bob this,” Mel Shavelson says. “We took his own characteristics and exaggerated them. The woman chaser. The coward. The cheap guy. We just put them in. He thought he was playing a character. He was playing, really, the real Bob Hope.” On the day Shavelson arrived in Hollywood from New York, he found himself an apartment and went to meet his new boss. “He asked me if I was married,” Shavelson writes in an unpublished memoir, “How to Succeed in Hollywood Without Really Trying.” “I said, ‘Not yet,’ and that seemed to please him. There was no one to share my apartment with me that lonely evening? . . . Then he said, ‘You won’t mind if I borrow the key? I’ll leave it in the mailbox when I leave around midnight.’ ” Shavelson continues, “I never found out who she was. I had certainly found out who Bob was, though.”\n\n“He was a satyr,” Hal Kanter says about Hope’s not-so-well-kept secret. Hope’s vanity was also transparent. “He never walked past the mirror without looking at himself or smoothing his hair,” Frank Liberman, his publicist of forty-one years, says. Hope’s parsimony, however, was more confounding. Although at the beginning he spent a third of his salary on writers, Hope was still capable of telling Larry Gelbart, “Ten o’clock. My house. Tomorrow morning. Bring your own orange juice.” Hope liked to hustle his writers in pool, and also made bets on jokes that he didn’t like but the writers did. “We never won, because he would kill the laugh in order to win the bet,” Shavelson says. Even payday became a joke about Hope’s ambivalence. In a North Hollywood house he once rented, there was a circular staircase. “Every week we’d gather at the bottom of the stairs,” Shavelson recalls. “He would go up to his office, write out our checks, and make paper airplanes out of them. Then he’d yell out our names and throw them down. You had to jump up and catch it. He said he had to do it because it was the only exercise we got.”\n\nAt the same time, Hope was a terrific audience for jokes and a fine editor of his writers’ material. In the early days, according to Shavelson, “we’d meet at Hope’s office at 9 p.m. Hope would never show until about ten, eleven o’clock. What we didn’t realize for a long time was that it was Bob’s excuse for getting out of the house. So when he’d finished with the girl, he’d show up at the meeting and we would have all the jokes ready for him.” Shavelson adds, “Around one, when we’d all be starving, he’d send Sherwood Schwartz out for a quart of vanilla ice cream with pineapple syrup. Bob would go on with the meeting, eat the whole quart, never offer us anything.” Each writer wrote an entire script every week and read it aloud for the others; by the process of elimination, the strongest jokes survived. To winnow them down, Hope marked them with a special code: 1 (titter), 2-3 (fair), check (“boff,” as he called a big laugh), check with a line through it (super-boff), check with two lines through it (super-super-boff). He was always pushing for the big laughs. “We need a big kid at the back,” he would prod his writers, meaning a strong comic finish. An hour-and-a-half script was compiled and previewed in front of a live Sunday audience; it was then cut down to a half-hour performing script for the Tuesday-night radio show.\n\nThe opening monologue—or “mono,” as Hope always called it—was where his heart was. “He guarded the monologue like the Dead Sea Scrolls,” Liberman says. No monologue was ever allowed to be mimeographed, carbon-copied, or included in any final script except Hope’s own. In fact, in order to prevent the East Coast 10 p.m. audience from retelling Hope’s “nifties” to West Coast friends in the three-hour time lag between performances, Hope often instructed his writers to do a second monologue for his California audience. Unlike his competitors, who were gentle (Jack Benny) or folksy (Fibber McGee and Molly) or droll (Fred Allen), Hope performed the monologues in a steamrolling, staccato style that owed its inspiration to the gossip columnist and radio powerhouse Walter Winchell, whom Hope always wanted to play in the movies. “Winchell went so fast you couldn’t tell when he was lying,” Shavelson says. Hope, who crammed as many as twenty-three jokes into a seven-minute riff, used wit instead of tidbits to achieve a similar kind of authority. He called débutantes “barebacks with greenbacks”; sailors were “wolves in ship’s clothing”; a lorgnette was “a sneer on a stick.” Among the news items that were the staples of the radio scripts was regular news about his career:\n\nJane Russell: Bob, is it true . . . I hear “Paleface” got wonderful reviews. Bob: I’ll say. The critics raved about it. Walter Winchell gave it four orchids. Jimmy Fiddler gave it four bells.Whittaker Chambers gave it four pumpkins. (That’s the last time I buy a joke from Alger Hiss.)\n\nAnd Hope, who never worked dirty, had no qualms about working racy:\n\nDorothy Lamour: Don’t take me seriously, Bob. I was pulling your leg. Hope: Listen, Dottie—You can pull my right leg and you can pull my left leg. But don’t mess with Mr. In-Between.\n\n“No one else came on and did that much material in that short a time,” Larry Gelbart says. “It really was electric.” He adds, “It was electronic vaudeville.” The monologue was followed by skits and songs performed by regulars such as Jerry Colonna and by frequent visitors, like Doris Day and Frances Langford; the show culminated in a sketch with the whole company. “But what it mostly was,” Gelbart says, “was jokes, jokes, jokes.”\n\nBy 1939, Hope was fourth among the radio comedians; by 1940, he was second; and when, by chance, on May 6, 1941, Hope grudgingly agreed to leave the studio and perform for soldiers at March Field, in California, he discovered the joys of a captive, entertainment-starved military audience: a constituency that vaulted him into first place and kept him there more or less for a lifetime. According to Milt Josefsberg, who wrote Jack Benny’s signature gag (“Your money or your life”), the laughs in Hope’s first broadcast to an all-female audience of Wacs “were so loud and long that the writers cut out seven minutes of script while the broadcast was in progress so the show would not run longer than the half-hour time period.” From May of 1941 until June of 1948, Hope performed almost all of his four hundred radio programs at Navy, Army, or Air Force bases. Throughout the war and after it, Hope’s work for the armed services far exceeded that of any other American entertainer, and it gave his comedy something that it would otherwise never have had: a mission. He’d found an audience that desperately needed laughter, and, Shavelson says, “he tailored his material to them.” His entertaining of American troops was heroic and exhausting, and was also a brilliant and enduring advertisement for himself. He became the G.I.s’ friend: Uncle Bob (the stand-in for Uncle Sam) was the man who would go to any lengths to bring jokes, girls, and the whiff of paternalistic American swagger to the homesick troops. “He has caught the soldier’s imagination,” John Steinbeck wrote in the New York Herald Tribune, in 1943. “It is interesting to see how he has become a symbol.” Hope’s troop shows created a reservoir of cultural good will which was invoked subliminally every time in the next half century when, before his entrance, the orchestra struck up “Thanks for the Memory.” “I saw your sons and your husbands, your brothers and your sweethearts,” he wrote in the preface to “I Never Left Home,” an account of his Second World War barnstorming, whose dedication reads “B.H. to G.I.” “I saw how they worked, played, fought, and lived. I saw some of them die.” He added, “Dying is sometimes easier than living through it.” On the page, the sentiment seems dreadful; on the stage, detachment played better. In Tunisia, one disaffected member of the audience shouted, “Draft dodger! Why aren’t you in uniform?” Hope shot back, “Don’t you know there’s a war on? A guy could get hurt!”\n\nHope’s nonchalance broadcast to combat-weary soldiers the comforting notion that life wasn’t always to be taken seriously. This message was brought home most sensationally in the high jinks of his motion pictures, especially the “Road” movies that he made starting in the forties, in which cowardice was lovable and danger was without consequences. “Hokum” was Bing Crosby’s word for the loosey-goosey banter between him and Hope, which began when they shared a vaudeville bill at New York’s Capitol Theatre, in 1932. Crosby was romantic and cavalier; Hope was impudent and driven. “They were a great team,” says Norman Panama, who, with his partner, Melvin Frank, wrote many memorable Hollywood comedies, including Hope and Crosby’s “Road to Utopia.” “There was always something in front of Bob, whether it was a five-hundred-dollar suit or a three-hundred-dollar set of golf clubs. He used Crosby for protection, someone to share the responsibility for the laughs.” Walter Winchell’s ongoing mock war with the banana-nosed bandleader Ben Bernie had popularized the fashion of celebrity feuds; Jack Benny and Fred Allen, W. C. Fields and Charlie McCarthy, and Hope and Crosby—as Ski Snoot and Mattress Hip—soon followed suit. “There’s nothing of the sacred clown in them, the Don Quixote, Sancho Panza thing—they’re both Sancho Panza,” the film critic Andrew Sarris says. “What they do is not sentimental. There are no tears, and there’s no great joy, either. It’s just efficient laughter.”\n\nThe seven “Road” pictures built their parody of competitiveness into a lucrative running gag that played for more than twenty years, and continued until Crosby died of a heart attack on a Spanish golf course in 1977. Hope was so undone by Crosby’s death that, for the first time in his life, he cancelled a performance. “I met him at the airport,” Elliott Kozak, then Hope’s manager, recalls. “I drove him home. He was a basket case. I’d never seen him cry.” Kozak adds, “It wasn’t because he was close. I believe that Bob felt, Well, if it happened to Bing, it could happen to me.” But Hope and Crosby, who shared golf games and oil wells as well as films, rarely approached in private the rapport that their on-camera badinage suggested. “I don’t think Bob ever called Bing just to say, ‘Hey, how are you? How you feeling?’ ” Kozak says. Hope frowned on Bing’s drinking; Bing looked askance at Hope’s philandering. “Bing was a man with an education,” says Hal Kanter, who wrote for both stars, separately and together. “He had a good vocabulary and spoke with good grammar. . . . He used to poke fun at Bob’s lack of it. Bob, I think, resented it. He almost assiduously went around trying to improve himself.” Kanter adds, “Whatever Bing had Bob wanted.”\n\nAmong the other things that Hope envied were Bing’s Academy Award for acting and his reputation as a romantic leading man. This offscreen ambivalence added emotional vigor to their amiable onscreen jousting, which, as Pauline Kael once wrote, “took the thud out of the dumb gags and topical jokes.” Crosby recalled about their first movie, “Road to Singapore” (1940), “For a couple of days, when Hope and I tore freewheeling into a scene, ad-libbing and violating all the accepted rules of moviemaking, the director Victor Schertzinger stole bewildered looks at his script, then leafed rapidly through it, searching for the lines we were saying. ‘Perhaps we’d better do it the way it’s written, gentlemen,’ he’d say reprovingly, but then he’d notice that the crew was laughing at our antics.” At one point, Hope spotted one of the film’s screenwriters, Don Hartman, and shouted, “If you recognize anything of yours, yell bingo!” But Norman Panama, who directed “Road to Hong Kong,” says that Hope and Crosby’s ad-libbing was a myth. “Bing never wanted anything changed. That’s something everybody forgets. There were some ad-libs, but not nearly as much as the legend would have it.”\n\nOn the set, and in public together, Hope and Crosby were always “the boys”: their movies were really a sophisticated game of hide-and-seek with the occasional game of patty-cake thrown in each time the twosome combined to punch out the enemy. The “Road” movies also set the standard for the sexual fiasco that was Hope’s lifetime cinematic stock-in-trade; in some instances, Hope’s animal urges gave way simply to animals. In “Road to Bali” he’s almost raped by a gorilla; in “Son of Paleface” he beds a horse. The fact that Hope almost never seemed to get the girl didn’t spoil the happy ending for the audience; Hope always had himself.\n\nHope’s character—the coward’s coward—was balm to frayed wartime nerves, and a nice break from the usual strong, silent types. And yet release from the solemnity of self can’t completely explain the depth to which Hope, both plus and minus Crosby, was absorbed by the culture. (Between 1941 and 1951, Hope was among Hollywood’s ten biggest money-making stars, and in 1945, when Paramount announced there would be no more “Road” movies, it received seventy-five thousand letters protesting the decision, which it quickly rescinded.) In his many incarnations of braggadocio and cunning, Hope’s character was a direct descendant of Sam Slick (“We are born in a hurry, educated at full speed, our spirit is at high pressure, and our life resembles a shooting star”). A kind of Yankee peddler, Hope sold himself in one implausible imposture after another: photographer as gumshoe (“My Favorite Brunette”), huckster dentist as Indian fighter (“The Paleface”), tailor as Casanova (“Casanova’s Night Out”).\n\nIn life, Hope could be every bit as sly as his persona. In the first flush of his film popularity, in 1940, he pressed Samuel Goldwyn to raise his salary from fifty to a hundred thousand dollars a picture. Goldwyn refused, but this didn’t stop him from asking Hope, as a favor, to m.c. a gala première of “The Westerner,” in Fort Worth. At the event, after a bevy of stars, including Gary Cooper, had been brought onstage, Hope called Goldwyn out and gave him a flattering introduction. Goldwyn returned the compliment. “I haven’t made a comedy since Eddie Cantor left me,” he said. “I never found a comedian who I thought could do as well—until now. I finally found one in Bob Hope.” After the applause died down, Hope said, “That’s very nice, Sam. Now let’s talk money.” Goldwyn was nonplussed. “Later,” he whispered. “We’ll talk later.” “No, let’s talk about it here,” Hope said loudly. “These people won’t mind. Let’s get really comfortable. Why don’t we just lie down and talk things over.” With his audience howling with laughter in front of him, Goldwyn had no choice but to get down on the floor with Hope. “Now, Sam, about my salary,” Hope persisted. Goldwyn reached for the mike, but Hope refused to hand it over, and finally Goldwyn whispered something in Hope’s ear. Hope whispered something back, and they both got to their feet. “It’s going to be a great pleasure to make a picture with Mr. Goldwyn,” Hope told the audience. He had his deal.\n\nAlthough Hope won five “special” Academy Awards in his career, not one of them was for a specific acting role. “Welcome to the Academy Awards,” he began the Oscar ceremony in 1968. “Or—as it’s known at my house—Passover.” When, in later years, Tony and Linda Hope suggested that they option John Osborne’s “The Entertainer” as an Oscar-contending vehicle for their father, Hope demurred. “He always said he wanted an Academy Award for acting, but he also never wanted to get outside his persona,” Tony Hope says. “He knew where his audience was, and he didn’t want to risk it.” Hope was wedded to the joke. And his habit of letting his joke writers gang-tackle scripts and turn them into a theatrical hodgepodge didn’t help his artistic cause. In fact, Hope was at his tastiest when he danced. In a spoof of Al Jolson’s Southern smarminess, “Apalachicola, Florida” (“Road to Rio”), or in his tap contest with Jimmy Cagney (“The Seven Little Foys”), something quirky, passionate, and personal came through which a lot of his critics felt was missing from his well-worked-out shtick.\n\nBut Hope’s movie legacy lives on in the films of Woody Allen, who claims Hope as a seminal influence on his screen persona. “When my mother took me to see ‘Road to Morocco,’ I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life,” Allen says in the voice-over of his film homage to Hope, “My Favorite Comedian” (1979). Allen, a great writer of comic lines, admires Hope, a great reader of comic lines. “It’s a delivery that’s comparable to Groucho,” Allen explained to me. “It’s more realistic than Groucho, and so his range is much wider. Someone like Groucho, though he entertained, had a sense of deep surrealism or deep suffering. Hope’s persona is glib. He’s not concerned with suffering, but what he is concerned with is very, very amusing.” The best comedy is about transgression; Hope’s comedy was about conformity. He was a sheep in wolf’s clothing—an image that Allen overhauled, adding angst and intellect to Hope’s anachronistic glibness. But Allen’s admiration of Hope’s comedy is strictly in his films. “In other media, particularly television, he was not very good,” Allen says of Hope’s two hundred and eighty-four prime-time television shows, which began in 1950 and ended in 1997, and generally attracted a forty-per-cent share of the audience. “He was lazy, and nobody cared. He would come out and do these old-fashioned sketches, and after a while he was unashamedly reading from cards. It was just awful.”\n\n\"When vaudeville died, television was the box they put it in,” Hope joked a year before he went into TV. He turned television into his own personal vaudeville circuit. “Hope never developed a character in television, never,” Larry Gelbart says. But, as America split over the Vietnam War, it was Hope himself, not his comic character, who played most dramatically in the nation. Until Vietnam, Hope had been a Cold War wit, whose jokes confirmed America’s superiority. Russia? “Anybody without a stiff neck is a traitor.” Africa? “Texas with Arabs.” Korea? “Seoul has changed hands so many times the towels in the hotel are marked ‘His,’ ‘Hers,’ and ‘Who’s Sorry Now?’ ” Prodded by his liberal joke writers, Hope, to his credit, was one of the first comedians to take comic swipes at Senator Joseph McCarthy. “I have it on good authority that McCarthy is going to disclose the names of two million Communists,” he said in a 1954 TV monologue. “He’s just got his hands on the Moscow telephone directory.” Hope’s topical humor flattered as it teased, and this was the secret of his success as a court jester to eleven Presidents. “He’s been able to interject himself into the political arena without anybody getting mad at him,” Gerald Ford told me. “He liked to sort of stick the needle in a little bit, but do it in a very nice way.” (Hope said, “I love playing golf with Jerry Ford. If you beat him, he pardons you.”)\n\nIn his compendium of Presidential zingers, “Dear Prez, I Wanna Tell Ya!” (1996), Hope wrote, “Laughter is non-partisan.” But laughter is never non-partisan: even embracing the status quo is a political position. The Vietnam War made this paradox—and Hope’s deep-seated conservatism—transparent. He abandoned his posture of neutrality and began to take sides with his friends, who were known in other quarters as “the military-industrial complex.” He lent his joke writers to Spiro Agnew and his presence to Richard Nixon, and his own jokes increasingly turned from saucy to sour: “Students are revolting all over the world. I don’t know what they’re revolting about, I just know that they’re revolting.” He tried to define a middle ground for himself. “I’m a hawkish dove,” he said. “It’s nothing like a pigeon, but if I have to lay an egg for my country I’ll do it.”\n\nIn Hope’s role as G.I. Bob, it was business as usual. He continued to perform his troop shows, and his 1970 and 1971 Christmas specials from the war zone ranked among the all-time top thirty popular American TV programs and linked him inextricably in the public imagination to the Vietnam quagmire. “Hey, aren’t you the guy who sponsored the Vietnam War?” a Van Nuys teen-ager asked Hope in the early seventies as he was buying an ice-cream cone.\n\nIn putting his comedy in the service of the state, Hope, who was dubbed “a Pentagon clown” by Izvestia, had become a controversial force of divisiveness instead of unity. One night in 1973 at the NBC studios, Hope slipped into the audience to watch “The Dean Martin Show,” on which the comedian Don Rickles was appearing. The audience spotted Hope and started to applaud. Rickles waited for the applause to die down, and then said, “Well, the war must be over.” The howls of laughter acknowledged Hope’s dilemma. During the Vietnam War, Hope had found himself embattled and in the unusual position of occasionally being shouted down or at a loss for words. In 1970, at the Miss World contest, in London, he was interrupted by explosions and by the whirring of rattles in the audience, and hurled objects forced him to leave the stage briefly. According to General William Westmoreland, Hope did “more for the morale of the Armed Forces than any American that has ever lived.” But his hard work received more of a mixed reception in the field than his publicity machine would admit. At Long Binh in 1971, Hope’s show was met with banners that read “Peace Not Hope” and “The Vietnam War Is a Bob Hope Joke,” and he enraged the soldiers when he said, “You’re off the front page back home. The Vietnam War is now tucked away between ‘Li’l Abner’ and ‘Chuckle a Day.’ ” At the end of that show, when a general presented Hope with a gift—a “Ho Chi Minh bicycle”—G.I.s walked out. Hope was unnerved. He shouted back at the hecklers, “In my heart, you’re the guys that are against war because you’re the guys that are helping to end it! You’ve all listened to that garbage of the other cats. . . . What have they ever done for the world? They talk a lot about the My Lai massacre . . . but that’s a load of nothing, because they forget the good that we’ve done helping little kids and building orphanages.”\n\nIn 1972, on a U.S.O. tour, Hope was billeted in Bangkok, for security reasons, and flown daily to different military installations in Vietnam. He joked, “When I came out of a temple recently, I found two Thai families in my shoes who refused to evacuate.” The United States Ambassador to Thailand issued an official apology to the Thai government. “I get very little flak in the States, but when I do it makes good copy,” Hope said, adding insult to injury. “For instance, the gay-lib movement made a big protest to NBC when I said in a show that their demonstrations were the only ones on earth led by a cop riding sidesaddle.” Hope, who put such an emphasis on timing, seemed to have lost the pulse of his times. In fact, with twenty-five years of performing still left to him, he had lost something even more important: the allegiance of a younger generation.\n\nThese days, Hope pads about his rooms on the second floor of his Toluca Lake house, surrounded by autographed pictures of the war correspondent Ernie Pyle, F.D.R., General MacArthur, and the English Royal Family. “He’s whistling all the time,” Tony Hope says. “He’s singing old songs to himself. The ones that come up most are the ones that he used to sing with my mother. He’ll just sing his part to her if she’s there, or without her being there.” At dinnertime, Hope joins Dolores downstairs in the playroom, a large, informal second living room. They sit in the television alcove at a round maple table where Dolores likes to play gin rummy with friends. A framed sampler on the sideboard reads “O.K. So This Isn’t Home Sweet Home—Adjust.”\n\nFor sixty-four years, Dolores has had to do a lot of adjusting. “He’s a rover by nature,” Dolores told an interviewer in 1953. “The first year we were married, I saw so little of Bob that I wasn’t sure we’d make a go of it. Now, of course, I’ve gotten accustomed to his being away, and I couldn’t imagine life being any different.” Her Catholicism and her family helped Dolores fill Hope’s long absences. “There were times I wanted to pack it in,” Dolores told the gossip columnist Cindy Adams; and times, too, when Hope did. “Marilyn Maxwell was really serious,” Elliott Kozak says of the buxom blonde, who was known on the Paramount lot as Mrs. Hope in the early fifties. “Bob told me at one point he almost left Dolores for her.”\n\nBut Bob and Dolores were a good partnership; they shared not only a sense of humor but an almost Presidential faith in keeping up appearances. “There was a big social element to being successful as a standup comedian,” Tony Hope says. “You had to have the right wife and the right kids. . . . You had to have the total image. And she created that for him.” About her husband’s notorious womanizing, Dolores told me, “It never bothered me, because I thought I was better-looking than anybody else.”"
