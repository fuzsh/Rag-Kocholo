        "text": "A Spanish duke has recently welcomed his second child but may have to rename her because her 157-letter name is too long.\n\nFernando Juan Fitz-James Stuart y de Solís - the 17th Duke of Huéscar and heir apparent to the dukedom of Alba - and his wife Sofía Palazuelo, 31, have baptised their daughter but have been told that her name, which is made up of 11 different names, will need to be shortened in order to be accepted by the Civil Registry. As it stands, the girl's name is Sofía Fernanda Dolores Cayetana Teresa Ángela de la Cruz Micaela del Santísimo Sacramento del Perpetuo Socorro de la Santísima Trinidad y de Todos Los Santos.\n\nThe second article of the law on names and surnames, published in the Official State Gazette, says a child's name must contain \"no more than one compound name and no more than two simple ones\". According to reports, the girl's long name is a tribute to the deceased Duchess of Alba and other members of the family, including religious devotions.\n\nEl País reported that the duke's daughter's first name, Sofía, was chosen to honour her mother and grandmother, and the second, Fernanda, as a tribute to her father and great-uncle Fernando Martínez of Irujo, Marquis of San Vicente del Barco. The girl was born in Madrid on January 10, 2023, and was baptised on October 7 in the parish of San Román, in the historic center of Seville, and the family then had a dinner at the Dueñas palace.\n\nThe Spanish newspaper reported: \"The girl will not be able to be registered in the Civil Registry with a string of names that surpass all rules, even though it is a tribute to the deceased Duchess of Alba and other members of the family and includes religious devotions.\" So far, there has been no response from the Duke and Duchess of Huescar, according to reports.\n\nThe Duke, who is the eldest son of Carlos Fitz-James Stuart, 19th Duke of Alba and Matilde de Solís, already had a similar problem with his first child, called Rosario Matilde Sofía Cayetana Dolores Teresa - but everyone calls her Rosario. According to the Guinness World Record, the late Duchess of Alba, who died at the age of 88 in 2014 and was known as Spain's richest woman, was the most titled person in the world. Her full name was María del Rosario Cayetana Paloma Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Fernanda Teresa Francisca de Paula Lourdes Antonia Josefa Fausta Rita Castor Dorotea Santa Esperanza Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva Falcó y Gurtubay.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Huescar married in a lavish royal wedding in 2018. They exchanged vows in front of 300 guests at the majestic Liria Palace in Madrid."
