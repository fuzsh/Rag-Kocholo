        "text": "If you think learning to spell your name was a headache, spare a thought for Sofía Fernanda Dolores Cayetana Teresa Ángela de la Cruz Micaela del Santísimo Sacramento del Perpetuo Socorro de la Santísima Trinidad y de Todos Los Santos.\n\nHer name is so elaborate that her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Huéscar have been told it’s too long.\n\nFernando Juan Fitz-James Stuart y de Solís, 33, the 17th Duke of Huéscar and heir apparent to the dukedom of Alba, and wife Sofía Palazuelo, 31, baptised their daughter in Seville, Spain, on October 7.\n\nHowever, they ran into trouble when they went to register the birth.\n\nAccording to El Pais, she won’t be registered because of the length of the name, despite it being a tribute to other members of the family, including the late matriarch of the dynasty, the Duchess of Alba – aka Cayetana.\n\nShe holds the family record for the longest name which is María del Rosario Cayetana Paloma Alfonsa Victoria Eugenia Fernanda Teresa Francisca de Paula Lourdes Antonia Josefa Fausta Rita Castor Dorotea Santa Esperanza Fitz-James Stuart y de Silva Falcó y Gurtubay.\n\nThe newspaper added the civil registry rules mean the name given to a child must contain ‘no more than one compound name and no more than two simple ones.\n\n‘The girl has a few more than the five simple names allowed,’ it added.\n\nAccording to the Guinness World Records, Cayetana had more titles than any other noblewoman in the world.\n\nShe was five times duchess, 18 times marchioness, 20 times countess, viscountess, countess-duchess and constable, in addition to being Grande of Spain 14 times. She has no more and no less than 19 names and 46 titles.\n\nThis record is now held by Princess Victoria of Hohenlohe-Lagenburg, 20th Duchess of Medinaceli.\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page."
