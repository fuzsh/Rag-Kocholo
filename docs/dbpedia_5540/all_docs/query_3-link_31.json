She is also a member of the International Best Dressed List since 1970.[1] Her mother was the famous socialite Gloria Guinness.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Later life\n\n3 Fashion icon\n\n4 References\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn Dolores Maria Agatha Wilhelmine Luise, Freiin von Fürstenberg-Hedringen on 31 July 1936 in Berlin-Charlottenburg.[2] She is the second daughter of Franz-Egon Maria Meinhard Engelbert Pius Aloysius Kaspar Ferdinand Dietrich, 3rd Graf von Fürstenberg-Herdringen (1896–1975) and his second wife, Gloria Guinness (1912–1980). She also has a younger brother, Franz-Egon born 1939, and a stepsister, Betsy von Furstenberg, from her fathers previous marriage.\n\nThough some published sources have described Dolores von Fürstenberg as a countess and a princess, she is, in fact, a Freiin (baroness) by birth, according to the last published issue of the Almanach de Gotha. Children of the counts von Fürstenberg-Hedringen are known as Freiherr (baron) or Freiin (baroness), and the sons move up in rank to Graf (count) only if they inherit the primary title.\n\nLater life\n\nAt age 19 she married her stepbrother Patrick Benjamin Guinness[3] (1931–1965), son of Loel Guinness, on 22 October 1955 in Paris. Patrick was killed in a car accident in Turtig near Raron, Switzerland 1965.[4] Have issue:\n\nPhilip Niarchos in 1984, son of late Greek billionaire Stavros Niarchos. Have issue.\n\nAfter Patrick's death Dolores fell madly in love with Karim Aga Khan, the son of Joan Barbara Yarde-Buller (1908–1997) by her marriage to Aly Khan (1911–1960), and wanted to marry him, but nothing came of that eventually.[5]\n\nFashion icon\n\nDolores was often seen in Vogue (magazine), Harper's Bazaar,[6] Town and Country (magazine) and LIFE dressed in designer clothes from Givenchy, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga during the 1950s and 1960s, photographed by Cecil Beaton, Bert Stern, Henry Clarke, Mark Shaw (photographer), Richard Avedon and William Klein. She often appeared on the International Best Dressed List during these years.\n\nReferences\n\n^ Vanity Fair\n\n^ Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Freiherrliche Häuser, Band XV, Seite 135-177, Band 69 der Gesamtreihe, C.
