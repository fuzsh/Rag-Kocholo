        "text": "FIRST DIVISION POLITICAL HISTORY OF PALESTINE, FROM B.C. 175 TO A.D. 135 VOLUME I\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nÂ§ 1. SCOPE AND LITERATURE\n\nIN the fullness of time the Christian religion sprang out of Judaism; as a fact, indeed, of divine revelation, but also inseparably joined by innumerable threads with the previous thousand years of Israelâs history. No incident in the gospel story, no word in the preaching of Jesus Christ, is intelligible apart from its setting in Jewish history, and without a clear understanding of that world of thought-distinction of the Jewish people.\n\nThus it becomes the bounden duty of Christian theologians to examine into and describe that realm of thought and history in which the universal religion of Christ grew up. Nor is it enough to know simply that older literature which has been collected together in the canon of the Old Testament. On the contrary, the gospel of Jesus Christ is much more closely connected with its immediately contemporary surroundings, and the tendencies of thought prevailing in that particular age. The recognition of this has already led many investigators to devote special attention to the History of the Times of Jesus Christ. Besides such scholars as have continued the history of Israel in a comprehensive manner down to the period of Christ and His apostles, Schneckenburger and Hausrath, in particular, have treated separately of that era under the title, History of New Testament Times. The present work, too, in its first edition, was published under that designation. Though the name is now abandoned on account of its indefiniteness, the purpose and scope of the work remain practically the same. The task, however, which we set before us is more limited than that proposed by Schneckenburger and Hausrath. While Schneckenburger undertakes to describe the condition of the Jewish and Gentile world in the times of Christ, and Hausrath even adds to that the history of primitive Christianity, we shall here attempt to set forth only the History of the Jewish People in the Times of Jesus Christ, for this alone in the strict and proper sense constitutes the presupposition of the earliest history of Christianity.\n\nThe predominance of Pharisaism is that which most distinctly characterized this period. The legalistic tendency inaugurated by Ezra had now assumed dimensions far beyond anything contemplated by its originator. No longer did it suffice to insist upon obedience to the commandments of the scripture Thora. These divine precepts were broken down into an innumerable series of minute and vexatious particulars, the observance of which was enforced as a sacred duty, and even made a condition of salvation. And this exaggerated legalism had obtained such an absolute ascendency over the minds of the people, that all other tendencies were put entirely in the background.\n\nThis Pharisaic tendency had its origin in conflicts of the Maccabean age. During the course of those national struggles the legalistic party not only obtained the victory over those favourably inclined toward Greek learning and customs, but also secured the entire confidence of the people, so that they were encouraged to put forth claims of the most extravagant and immoderate description. The scribes were now the rulers of the people. No other intellectual or political force was sufficiently strong to counteract their influence in any appreciable degree.âThe battles of the Maccabean age, however, were also epoch-making in the political history of the Jews. By them was the foundation laid for the construction) of an independent Jewish commonwealth, and for its emancipation from the dominion of the Seleucidae. This deliverance was wholly effected in consequence of the Syrian empire. Judea became an independent state under native princes, and continued in this position until conquered by the Romans.âOn the ground, therefore, of spiritual development and political history, we are justified in beginning our exposition with the history of the Maccabean age.\n\nIn determining also the point at which we should close our investigations, a glance at the spiritual as well as the political history will lead to the same result. Political independence was in some measure preserved under the domination of the Romans. In place of the priestly dynasty of the Maccabees, the new order of the Herodians made its appearance. After this line of rulers had been set aside by the Romans, Palestine was for a long period governed by a series of imperial procurators. But even under them there was still a native aristocratic senate, the so-called Sanhedrim, which exercised most of the functions of government. It was not until the time of Nero and Vespasian that all political independence was taken from the Jewish people in consequence of the great revolt which they had endeavoured to carry out. The complete abolition of all Jewish national freedom was finally effected on the suppression of the outbreak under Hadrian.âAnd just as the concluding of our inquiry with the age of Hadrian recommends itself on outward or political grounds, so also it will be found to correspond to the course of the spiritual development of the people. For it was just during the reign of Hadrian that the Jewish scholars for the first time committed to writing the hitherto only really communicated traditional law, and in this way laid the foundation of the Talmudical code. With the age of Hadrian, therefore, a new epoch begins also for the intellectual and spiritual development of the people, the Talmudic, in which no longer the Thora of Moses, but the Talmud, forms the basis of all juristic discussion. All the same, this, too, is the period in which Pharisaism, in consequence of the overthrow of the Jewish commonwealth, becomes a purely spiritual and moral power, without, however, thereby losing, but rather gaining in its influence over the people. For with the overthrow of the temple the Sadducean priesthood was also set aside, and in the Dispersion the lax and inconsistent Hellenistic Judaism could not permanently maintain itself over against the strict and consistent Judaism of the Pharisees.\n\nThe state of the sources of information at our disposal makes it impossible for us to follow step by step the inner development of the people in connection with each particular institution that comes under consideration. We are therefore under the necessity of appending to the outline of the political history a description of the inner condition of the people in a separate division. The political history falls into two main periods: the period of independence, and the period of the Roman domination. In reference to the internal conditions, the following points should be kept prominently in mind.\n\nWe shall have to describe, first of all, the general character of the culture prevailing throughout Palestine, with a particularly careful account of the spread of Hellenism on the confines of the Jewish territory and within that territory itself (Â§ 22). Then, as supplementary to the political history, the church constitution of the Gentile communities of Palestine as well as of the Jewish people must be explained, which belongs to the inner or spiritual history, inasmuch as it brings into consideration the self-administration of the communities in contradistinction to the political schemes and undertakings of the whole land. The exposition of the Jewish communal constitution gives the opportunity also to add the history of the Sanhedrim and of the Jewish high priest (Â§ 23). The two chief factors in the internal development, however, are, on the one hand, the priesthood and the temple services (Â§ 24), and, on the other hand, the institution of Scribism (Â§ 25). Inasmuch as the priests occupying prominent and official positions during the Greek era were more absorbed by worldly and political than by religious interests, those who were still zealous for the law now formed themselves into an opposition party under the leadership of the scribes. The party of the Sadducees grouped themselves around the official priests, while around the scribes gathered the party of the Pharisees (Â§ 26). The erection of schools and synagogues served to preserve and spread the knowledge of the law among all classes of the people (Â§ 27). In order to give a general view of the results to which the efforts of the scribes and Pharisees led, we have sought in another section to describe life under the law (Â§ 28). Zeal for the law, however, has its nerve-centre in the Messianic hope. For the gracious reward of God, which one regards himself as being made worthy of receiving by a life in accordance with the law, is thought of pre-eminently as one that lies in the future and is heavenly (Â§ 29). Zeal for the law and the Messianic hope are therefore the two centres around which the life of the Israelite moves. Then, after the exposition of the inner conditions of the everyday Palestinian Judaism in its main features has been concluded by a description of those two powerful tendencies just mentioned, it remains for us to glance at the Jewish monastic institution of the Essenes (Â§ 30), and at the much more influential, and even for the early history of Christianity much more important, Judaism of the Dispersion (Â§ 31). Finally, we have to show from what remains of the Jewish literature of our period how, in spite of the predominance of Pharisaism, the intellectual interests and spiritual struggles of Judaism spread out in various directions. This is seen even in the Palestinian literature (Â§ 32), but in a still higher degree in the Hellenistic literature (Â§ 33); and last of all, though really belonging to this group just named, the Jewish philosopher Philo, on account of his very peculiar importance, may have his writings and his speculation treated of in a distinct section (Â§ 34).\n\nLITERATURE\n\nPRIDEAUX, The Old and New Testament connected in the history of the Jews and neighbouring nations from the declension of the kingdom of Israel and Judah to the time of Christ. 2 vols.

The Geography of Palestine. III. Jewish Chronology. IV. Jewish Numismatics. V. Jewish Inscriptions. The Geography and Chronology afford us the framework, not to speak of space and time, in which the history with which we are concerned is contained; the Numismatics and Inscriptions afford the original documentary materials.\n\nA.âJEWISH ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nA rich collection of older monographs on Biblical and Jewish Archaeology was made by Ugolini in his Thesaurus antiquitatum sacrum, in 34 folio vols., Venice 1744â1769. The shorter handbooks treat for the most part either of the whole range of âAntiquities,â or of particular departments, such as the religious worship of the civil law and constitution. The material of Archaeology is also dealt with in the various Biblical Dictionaries and Encyclopaedias. Finally, expositions of Jewish institutions and usages in post-Talmudic times afford supplementary details.\n\nA very complete list of the older literature is given by Meusel, Bibliotheca historica, i. 2. 118â207.

We distinguish among these two classesâ1. Comprehensive treatises by authors who have not been themselves upon the scene, but who work up the materials brought them; and 2. The researches carried on in the land itself. Under the former category there are two great works which stand out from all the rest in the rich abundance of their materials, Reland presenting the older material, and Ritter the more recent. These two works will long be indispensable to the student. A convenient handbook is that of Raumer, of which, however, we have no more recent edition than that of 1860. Among treatises that embody original research, mention should be made, first of all, of the American Robinsonâs epoch-making work, which furnished a profusion of new and important facts. Still more completely and systematically has the French scholar GuÃ©rin explored and described the whole of the country west of the Jordan from place to place. Both of these writers, along with a communication of the results of their research, give a very full account of the historical associations. The Memoirs, which accompany by way of explanation the large English map, deal simply with the Palestine of the present day. The topography of Jerusalem forms a science by itself.âTwo magazines, an English and a German, are devoted to the recording of the more recent discoveries.âAmong historical atlases which show clearly the political history from step to step, that of Menke is to be specially recommended. In the department of map-drawing, all earlier productions have been put in the shade by the great English map, in twenty-six sheets, produced on the spot by the Palestine Exploration Society during the years 1872â1877, according to exact topographical measurement of the country west of the Jordan. The English have also supplied the best groundwork for a topography of Jerusalem. In the years 1864â1865 Sir Charles Wilson made a topographical survey of Jerusalem, and in the years 1867â1870 the English Palestine Exploration Society conducted the most thorough excavations and measurements on the site of the temple, to which the labours of the Germans could only contribute some further details.\n\nA complete list of the older Palestinian literature is to be found in Meusel, Bibliotheca historica, i. 2. 70â118. A good survey of that literature down to 1840 is given in Robinson, Biblical Researches in Palestine, iii., Appendix A, pp. 1â28.âAn oppressively complete list of Palestinian literature is given in Tobler, Bibliographia geographica Palaestinae, Leipzig 1867. A yet fuller catalogue of the earlier travellersâ accounts down to the tenth century after Christ than is given there, may be found in Toblerâs Bibliographia geographica Palaestinae ab anno CCCXXXIII. usque ad annum, M. Dresdae, 1875 (reprinted as a separate monograph from Petzholdtâs Neue Anzeiger fÃ¼r Bibliographie und Bibliothekwissenschaft, 1875).âContinuations of and additions to Toblerâs work have been made by Ph. Wolff in the JahrbÃ¼cher fÃ¼r deutsche Theologie, 1868 and 1872; RÃ¶hricht and Meisner, Deutsche Pilgerreisen nach dem heiligen Lande, Berlin 1880, pp. 541â648; and Socin and Jacob in their yearly summaries and reviews, in the Zeitschrift des deutschen PalÃ¤stina-Vereins, Bd. iâix., by Socin; later volumes by Jacob.âA sketch and review of the literature is also given by F. W. Schultz, in article âPalÃ¤stina,â in Herzog, Real-Encyclopaedie, 2 Aufl. Bd. xi. (1883) pp. 800â804.\n\n1.

The non-Jewish Greek and Latin inscriptions from Palestine and neighbouring countries have been collected in the Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum, vol. iii., and in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, vol. iii. Both collections, especially the former, have meanwhile been largely supplemented by the discoveries of Wetzstein, Waddington, and others. The inscriptions referred to afford highly important information regarding the state of civilisation and culture in the pagan districts of Palestine (see Â§ 22). Besides the Palestinian inscriptions, many that have been found in other places are of interest in connection with the history of our period, as are also many Semitic inscriptions in Palestine and outside of it, among which the Nabatean inscriptions collected by De VogÃ¼Ã© and Euting are specially important.â2. Of the Jewish inscriptions, those in Hebrew have been collected by Chwolson in the Quarterly edited by him. More numerous are those in Greek and Latin, mostly epitaphs on tombstones in Palestine and outside of it; and most numerous and important of all are those taken from the Jewish catacombs at Rome.\n\n1. Non-Jewish Inscriptions\n\nCorpus Inscriptionum Graecarum, t. iii. 1853, n. 4444â4669.\n\nCorpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, t. iii. 1873, n. 86â211, 6027â6049.\n\nAdditional inscriptions from the HaurÃ¢n and the eastern desert of Syria, communicated by G. C. Graham, and edited with a preface and notes by John Hogg (Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature, second series, vol. vi., London 1859, pp. 270â323).\n\nALLEN, Greek and Latin inscriptions from Palestine (American Journal of Philology, vi. 1885, pp. 190â216).\n\nWETZSTEIN, AusgewÃ¤hlte griechische und lateinische Inschriften, gesammelt auf Reisen in den Trachonen und um das HaurÃ¢ngebirge (Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie, 1863, philol.-histor.

Theologie, 1873, pp. 248â255.âTo this collection may be added: Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum, t. iii. pars 1, 1878, n. 550, 551, 556.

Mittheilungen aus Oesterreich, viii. 1884, p. 189 f.=Zeitschrift des deutschen PalÃ¤stina-Vereins, vii. 1884, p. 121 f. (Agrippa II.).\n\nThe Roman inscriptions referring to the Jewish history from Vespasian to Hadrian have been collected by Darmesteter, Revue des Ã©tudes juives, t. i. 1880, pp. 32â55.\n\nThe Semitic inscriptions have been collected in the most complete manner in the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, which has been in course of publication at Paris since 1881.\n\nUp to the present only the Phoenician inscriptions have been issued. With reference to one of these, the inscription of Eschmunazar which gives dates important for the history, see Div. ii. vol. i. pp. 88, 89. The most interesting in relation to our subject of the non-Jewish Semitic inscriptions are the Nabatean, which have been made available to us in the editions of DE VOGÃÃ, 1868, and Euting, 1885. For further particulars regarding these, see Appendix II. at close of second volume.âIt is only the slightest possible sort of connection with our subject that can be claimed for the numerous Aramaic and Greek inscriptions of Palmyra (edited by DE VOGÃÃ, Syrie Centrale, Inscriptions sÃ©mitiques. Paris 1868), among which, especially the bilingual Tariff of Taxes of Palmyra, discovered in 1881, belonging to the age of Hadrian, is most important. The Aramaic text is edited in the best style by Schroeder, Sitzungsb. der Berliner Akad. 1884, pp. 417â436; the Greek text by Dessau, in Hermes, Bd. xix. 1884, pp. 486â533.\n\n2. Jewish Inscriptions\n\nMADDEN gives a list of Jewish Inscriptions in his Coins of the Jews, pp. 34â39.\n\nCHWOLSON, Corpus Inscriptionum Hebraicarum, containing epitaphs from the Crimea and other epitaphs and inscriptions in the old Hebrew square characters, as well as specimens from manuscripts of ninth and fifteenth centuries. St. Petersburg 1882.âBesides the epitaphs from the Crimea, it gives a collection of all inscriptions in the Hebrew square characters down to the eleventh century after Christ.âA partial list is also given by Merx, Archiv fÃ¼r wissenschaftl. Erforschung des A. T. i. 360â362.\n\nAmong the oldest inscriptions collected by Chwolson, the following are elsewhere treated of separately:â1. The epitaph of the BenÃª Chesir on the so-called tomb of St. James at Jerusalem, belonging to the Herodian period (de VogÃ¼Ã©, Revue archÃ©ologique, nouv. sÃ©rie, t. ix. 1864, pp. 200â209). Also: Le temple de JÃ©rusalem, pp. 45, 130 sqq., pl. xxxvii. n. 1. De Saulcy, Revue archÃ©olog., nouv. sÃ©rie, t. xi. 1865, pp. 137â153, 398â405. Merx, Archiv fÃ¼r wissenschaftl. Erforschung des A. T. i. 360 sq.).â2. Some Synagogue Inscriptions in the north of Galilee, from the time of the Roman Emperors (Renan, Mission de PhÃ©nicie, pp. 761â783). To these may also be added a similar one from Palmyra, which contains the beginning of the Jewish Schma Deut. 6:4â9 (Landauer, Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akademie, 1884, p. 933 ff.).â3. The numerous Jewish Epitaphs. Among the latter are those from the Crimea of a much later date than previously Chwolson, on the basis of false dates attached to them by Firkowitsch, supposed them to be (for the literature, see Div. ii. vol. ii. p. 219); the Palestinian inscriptions are older, but very short. On these, partly in. Hebrew, partly in Greek, the following authors, before and after Chwolson, specially treat:â\n\nCLERMONT-GANNEAU, Nouveaux ossuaires juifs avec inscriptions grecques et hÃ©braÃ¯ques (Revue archÃ©logique, nouv. sÃ©rie, t. xxv. 1873, pp. 398â414).âAlso: Ossuaire juif de Joseph fils de Jean (Revue archÃ©ol., nouv. sÃ©rie, t. xxxvi. 1878, pp. 305â311).

Greek.\n\nEUTING, Epigraphische Miscellen (Sitzungsberichte der berliner Akademie, 1885, pp. 669â688, Tafel vi.âxii.).âPrincipally Palmyrene inscriptions and Hebrew-Greek epitaphs from Palestine.\n\nApart from the epitaphs, Greek inscriptions of Jewish origin are rarely met with in Palestine. The most interesting are the Warning Tablet on the entrance to the Outer Court of the Temple (see Div. ii. vol. i. p. 266, note 16 and the Greek inscription among the ruins of the synagogue at Casiun (Renan, Mission de PhÃ©nicie, p. 774=GuÃ©rin, GalilÃ©e, ii. 447 sq.).\n\nThe extra-Palestinian Greek and Latin inscriptions, in so far as they are of any value at all, are given in Â§ 31, i. and ii. 1 (Div. ii. vol. ii. pp. 220â242). Special attention may be called to the great inscription of Berenice (Div. ii. vol. ii. p. 231). Something may also be learned from Caspari, Quellen zur Geschichte des Taufsymbols, iii. 1875, pp. 268â274âAmong these, too, the majority are epitaphs. Most numerous are the inscriptions from the Catacombs of Rome and Venosa, which, together with some others, are collected in the following works:â\n\nBURGON, Letters from Rome, 1862, pp. 168â174.

THE SOURCES\n\nTHE chief sources of information in regard to the spiritual and intellectual life of the Jewish people during our period must evidently be such literary works of the Jews as had their origin in that period, and have come down to us. In regard to these, we can here only refer to the accounts of that literature given in Â§ 32â34. Among these documents is included the New Testament, in so far as it was composed by Jewish writers or makes reference to Jewish affairs. The coins and inscriptions, of which the literature has been given in the last section, are also to be ranked among the documents of primary importance.\n\nAll these works and documents, however, would not afford us material for writing a history of our period if we had not been possessed of the two Books of Maccabees and the works of Josephus, which relate the main incidents in the course of events, and, indeed, often go into very minute details. They form the most important, yea, almost the only, source of information in regard to the political history. As supplementary to them, we have, on the one hand, the Greek and Roman writers, who treat in a comprehensive way of the general history of that age; and, on the other hand, the rabbinical literature, contained in Mishna, Talmud, Midrash, Targum, which sets forth the results and preliminary summing up of the work of the scribes, who were at the very height of their activity during this period, and is, in so far at least, an indirect witness to the state of matters at that time.âBefore considering the information supplied us by Josephus, we shall take a general view of the non-extant sources, partly in order that we may obtain a glimpse into the circumstances and conditions of an earlier age, partly and mainly in order to secure solid material for answering the question about the sources drawn upon by Josephus. This will give us the following five divisions:â1. The two Books of Maccabees; 2. The non-extant Documents; 3. Josephus; 4. Greek and Roman Writers; and 5. The Rabbinical Literature.\n\nA.âTHE TWO BOOKS OF MACCABEES\n\nThe First Book of Maccabees is the main source to be relied upon for the first forty years of our history, from B.C. 175 to B.C. 135. The second book treats only of the first fourteen of those years, B.C. 175 to B.C. 161; but in respect of credibility stands far below the first, and can scarcely be said to be of independent value except in regard to the period that precedes the rise of the Maccabees. On the character of both of these works and the circumstances of their origin, all that is necessary will be found under Â§ 32 and 33, in Div. ii. vol. iii. pp. 6â13, 211â216. All that we are required to do here is to determine what is to be regarded as the starting-point of the Seleucid era, in accordance with which both of these books fix their dates. The usual Seleucid era begins with autumn 312 B.C. But it is open to question whether in the two Books of Maccabees, or whether even in one of them, this usual starting-point is presupposed. In order to help to a decision, we set down in order the examples of dating by months given in the First Book of Maccabees:â\n\nChap.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1:54:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá¿ ÏÎµÎ½ÏÎµÎºÎ±Î¹Î´ÎµÎºÎ¬Ïá¿ á¼¡Î¼Î­Ïá¾³ Î§Î±ÏÎµÎ»Îµá¿¦.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1:59:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá¿ ÏÎ­Î¼ÏÏá¿ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Îµá¼°ÎºÎ¬Î´Î¹ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î¼Î·Î½ÏÏ.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4:52:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá¿ ÏÎ­Î¼ÏÏá¿ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Îµá¼°ÎºÎ¬Î´Î¹ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î¼Î·Î½á½¸Ï ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼Î½Î½Î¬ÏÎ¿Ï , Î¿á½ÏÎ¿Ï á½ Î¼á½´Î½ Î§Î±ÏÎµÎ»Îµá¿¦.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 7:43:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá¿ ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎºÎ±Î¹Î´ÎµÎºÎ¬Ïá¿ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î¼Î·Î½á½¸Ï á¼Î´Î¬Ï.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 7:49:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá½´Î½ ÏÏÎ¹ÏÎºÎ±Î¹Î´ÎµÎºÎ¬ÏÎ·Î½ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼Î´Î¬Ï.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 9:3:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î¼Î·Î½á½¸Ï ÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÏÏÏÏÎ¿Ï á¼ÏÎ¿Ï Ï ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î´ÎµÏ ÏÎ­ÏÎ¿Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ ÏÎµÎ½ÏÎ·ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿á¿¦.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 9:54:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Î¼Î·Î½á½¶ Ïá¿· Î´ÎµÏ ÏÎ­Ïá¿³.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 10:21:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá¿· á¼Î²Î´á½Î¼á¿³ Î¼Î·Î½á½¶ á¼ÏÎ¿Ï Ï á¼Î¾Î·ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿á¿¦ á¼Î½ á¼Î¿ÏÏá¿ ÏÎºÎ·Î½Î¿ÏÎ·Î³Î¯Î±Ï.\n\nÂ Â âÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 13:51:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ïá¿ ÏÏÎ¯Ïá¿ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Îµá¼°ÎºÎ¬Î´Î¹ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î´ÎµÏ ÏÎ­ÏÎ¿Ï Î¼Î·Î½á½¸Ï á¼ÏÎ¿Ï Ï á¼Î½á½¸Ï ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼Î²Î´Î¿Î¼Î·ÎºÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÎºÎ±á½¶ á¼ÎºÎ±ÏÎ¿ÏÏÎ¿á¿¦.

With him Ijjar or Zif is the second mouth (chap. 13:51); Tizri, therefore, the month of the Feast of Tabernacles, was the seventh (chap. 10:21); Chisleu is the ninth (chap. 4:52), and Shebat is the eleventh (chap. 16:14). The numbering of the months, therefore, begins with Nisan or Abib, that is, in the spring (see list in Appendix III. at the end of vol. ii.). From this it seems to be put beyond all reasonable doubt that the year by which the author reckoned also began in the spring season. But the Seleucid era, according to which he reckons, is usually supposed to start with autumn, just as it was customary in Syria generally to commence the year in the season of harvest. Among the Jews, too, it was the custom in very early times (Ex. 23:16, 34:22) to begin the year in autumn,âa custom older probably than that of starting with the spring. In the post-exilian times we certainly have both of these methods of reckoning the beginning of the year existing side by side. The cycle of religious festivals begins in the spring season; and so from it the months are counted in the First Book of Maccabees as well as in the Priestly Code. But just as even the Priestly Code could not prevent the celebrating of the new moon of the month Tizri with a religious festival (Lev. 23:23â25; Num. 29:1â6), in later times the beginning of the year came to be counted from that day, ×¨×Ö¹×©× ×Ö·×©Ö¸Ö¼×× Ö¸×. The Mishna, indeed, says distinctly that âfor the yearâ simply, therefore for the numbering of its months, the beginning is made with the 1st of Tizri. According to Josephus, too, the beginning of the year with Nisan, as ordained by Moses, holds good with reference only to sacred things; whereas, on the other hand, âfor buying and selling and other business,â the year begins with Tizri according to the more ancient pre-Mosaic ordinance. In these circumstances it is quite possible that the First Book of Maccabees too, notwithstanding the numbering of the months from the spring season, may have reckoned its dates from the autumn. We should indeed have felt ourselves obliged, if no very decided reasons could be adduced against such a supposition, to accept this as the most probable explanation, seeing that it is from autumn as a rule that the dates in the Seleucid era are reckoned. This is the view taken by Wernsdorff, Clinton, and myself in the first edition of this work. But now it seems to me that weighty grounds can be given for thinking that the era of our book begins with the spring.\n\n1. According to 1 Macc. 7:1, Demetrius I. withdrew from Rome in the year 151 of the Seleucid era, and became king of Syria. After this we meet with no other note of time in the First Book of Maccabees until we come to the 43rd and 49th verses of the 7th chapter, where we are told that Nicanor lost the battle and his life in fighting against Judas on the 13th Adar. The year is not thereby determined. But in chap. 9:3 it is further said that in the first month of the year 152 of the Seleucid era a new army was sent by Demetrius into Palestine. According to this statement, it must then be assumed that the defeat of Nicanor took place on the 13th Adar of the year 151 of the Seleucid era. Since, then, by the âfirst monthâ of the year 152, after what had just been stated, the month Nisan of that year must evidently be understood, and since, further, Nisan follows immediately after Adar, if we suppose the year to begin, not on 1st Nisan but on 1st Tizri, a space of three months would intervene between the one event and the other. But according to the context of the story it is much more probable that the one followed almost immediately upon the other, and that therefore the beginning of the year was counted from 1st Nisan.\n\n2. According to 1 Macc. 10:1, Alexander Balas raised himself to the Syrian throne in the year 160 of the Seleucid era. According to chap. 10:21, Jonathan put on the high priestâs garments for the first time âin the seventh monthâ of this same year 160 of the Seleucid era, at the Feast of Tabernacles, therefore on the 15th Tizri. If, therefore, the year had begun on 1st Tizri, it would follow that all the occurrences reported in 1 Macc. 10:1â21 would have taken place within fourteen days, which is impossible. Should we insist upon putting the beginning of the year in the autumn, we would be obliged to set it later than the Feast of Tabernacles, and then that festival would be thrown into the end of the year, as indeed is presupposed in the old legislation of Ex. 23:16, ×Ö°Ö¼×¦Öµ××ª ×Ö·×©Ö¸Ö¼×× Ö¸×. But after what has been said above about the New Year Festival on the 1st Tizri, on the supposition of the year beginning generally in the autumn, for our period only the 1st of Tizri can come into consideration.\n\n3. When in the year 150 of the Seleucid era, which date is given us in 1 Macc. 6:20 and 7:1, Antiochus V. Eupator and Lysias came into Palestine with a great army, the garrison of Bethzur was obliged to submit to them, and those besieged in the fortress of Mount Zion suffered the direst privations (1 Macc. 6:48â54). And both of these disasters happened from their being deprived of the means of sustenance on account of the Sabbatical year, âthe year of rest to the landâ (1 Macc. 6:49, 53). This seventh year of rest was counted from autumn to autumn, as is shown in the passage quoted above from Rosch haschana i. 1. The want of victuals, however, could not have been felt before the middle of the seventh year, after the stores of the previous year had been used up and no new fruits were coming in during spring and summer. On the other hand, at the time when these events occurred, the Sabbath year had not yet expired (chap. 6:49: ÏÎ¬Î²Î²Î±ÏÎ¿Î½ á¼¦Î½ Ïá¿ Î³á¿; 6:53: Î´Î¹á½° Ïá½¸ á¼Î²Î´Î¿Î¼Î¿Î½ á¼ÏÎ¿Ï Îµá¼¶Î½Î±Î¹). They must therefore have taken place in the period between spring and 1st of Tizri. But we know that the siege of Jerusalem by Herod and Sosius also occurred during a Sabbath year (Josephus, Antiq. xiv. 16. 2; comp. xv. 1. 2). That siege, however, is certainly to be dated in the summer of B.C. 37 (see below, Â§ 14). Thus the year B.C. 38â37 was a Sabbath year. If, then, we reckon back from this, we shall find that the year B.C. 164â163 reckoned from autumn to autumn was also a seventh year of rest. The occurrences in question must therefore fall to the summer of B.C. 163. But the year B.C. 163â162 corresponds with the year 150 of the Seleucid era. Had that been counted from autumn, this reckoning would not tally. It will agree only if the Seleucid era is made to begin with spring.\n\nAs a confirmation of our understanding of the Sabbath year, may be quoted the somewhat late rabbinical note that it was ××Ö¹×¦Ö¸×Öµ× ×©Ö°××Ö´××¢Ö´××ª when the temple was destroyed by Titus (Seder Olam, ed. Meyer, p. 91 ff.: ×××ª× ×××× ×××¦×× ×©××ª ××× ××××¦×× ×©×××¢××ª ×××ª×. So, too, Arachin 11b, Taanith 29a). By ××Ö¹×¦Ö¸×Öµ× ×©Ö°××Ö´××¢Ö´××ª, according to the well-established usage, is certainly to be understood the year after the Sabbath year (see Schebiith v. 5, vi. 4; Sota vii. 8; Machschirin ii. 11; comp. ×××¦×× ×©××ª, meaning the day after the Sabbath, and ×¢×¨× ×©××ª, meaning the day before the Sabbath, in Chullin i. fin.). Accordingly the year A.D. 68â69 was a Sabbath year. And if we reckon back from this, we shall find that also the years B.C. 164â163 and B.C. 38â37 were Sabbath years.\n\nOnly one historical date on a Sabbath year stands opposed to the views that have been here set forth. According to 1 Macc. 16:14, Simon Maccabeus died in the month Shebat of the year 177 of the Seleucid era. Since Shebat corresponds in part with our February, this date, whether one counts the Seleucid year from spring or from autumn, must be rendered February B.C. 135. But, according to the report of Josephus, after the murder of Simon, John Hyrcanus besieged Simonâs murderer in the fortress of Dagon, and was then obliged after some time to raise the siege when the Sabbath. year came round in which the Jews are required to rest. His words are these: âThe year of rest came on upon which the Jews rest every seventh year as they do on every seventh dayâ (Wars of the Jews, i. 2. 4). âThat year on which the Jews used to rest came on; for the Jews observe this rest every seventh year as they do every seventh dayâ (Antiq. xiii. 8. 1). The year B.C. 135â134 must therefore have been a Sabbath year, whereas according to our calculations we should have expected it to have been B.C. 136â135. The statement of Josephus, however, is open to suspicion on other grounds. The reason given there to show the necessity of raising the siege is that rest is enjoined during the seventh year as on the seventh day. This was indeed the idea that prevailed among Gentile writers. So Tacitus says, Hist. v. 4: dein blandiente inertia septimum quoque annum ignaviae datum. But in the Pentateuch rest in general during the seventh year is by no means enjoined, but only the leaving of the fields unsown (see Lev. 25:1â7). And so far as my knowledge goes, even the later refinements on the interpretation of the law have never gone farther than this. There is therefore good reason for the suspicion that Josephus, who is in this place following Gentile authorities, as is certain on other grounds, has simply transcribed without sifting the statements which were before him. It would also appear that the real occasion of the raising of the siege was not the coming round of the Sabbath year, but the failure of provisions during the course of that year of rest to the land. If this interpretation be accepted, then B.C. 136â135 will be the Sabbath year in full agreement with the other dates.âWieseler, who indeed places the Sabbath year in B.C. 136â135, sets down the death of Simon as occurring in Shebat, or February B.C. 136; and seeing that this, according to our reckoning, would be the Shebat of the year 176 of the Seleucid era, he makes the Seleucid year of the First Book of Maccabees begin in accordance with the Roman practice in January,âan eccentricity of view that need not now be seriously criticized.\n\nAgainst the cycle of the Sabbath year here adopted I argued in the first edition of this work that the year A.D. 40â41 could not have been a Sabbath year, as according to our cycle it must have been. For the Jews omitted to sow the seed in the last month before Caligulaâs death, during November A.D. 40, not because it was the Sabbath year, but because for weeks they were going in great crowds to lay before Petronius their complaints on account of the profanation threatened to the temple (Antiq. xviii. 8. 3; Wars of the Jews, ii. 10. 5). From this it would appear that the sowing of the fields during that year had been expected. But we are obliged to admit that this indirect argument, when put over against other possible explanations that may still be given, is not strong enough to overturn the very positive proofs that have been advanced in favour of regarding this year as a Sabbath year.\n\nCompare generally on the reckoning of the historically attested Sabbath year in our periods (which by many are made about a year later than by us): Anger, De temporum in actis apostolorum ratione, Lips. 1833, p. 38 (and the earlier works of Scaliger, Petavius, etc., there quoted).âGumpach, Ueber den altjÃ¼dischen Kalender, Brussels 1848.âHerzfeld, Geschichte des Volkes Jisrael, ii. 458 ff.âZuckermann, Ueber Sabbathjahrcyklus und Jobelperiode, Breslau 1857 (and the older literature quoted there, pp. 2, 3).âGrÃ¤tz, Geschichte der Juden, Bd. iii.

Even had it not been otherwise impossible to suppose that its cycle of years began in autumn, this circumstance would have caused very great difficulty, especially in those passages in which the name of the month is not mentioned, but only the number of the month and the year. Thus we read âin the first month of the year 152, â chap. 9:3, etc. This form of expression would scarcely have been adopted unless a uniform mode of determining the order of the month had prevailed.\n\nWe assume then, with the great majority of critics, that the Seleucid era of the First Book of Maccabees begins, not in autumn, but in spring. And however extraordinary it may at first sight appear that in Palestine they had a Seleucid era which differed to the extent of about half a year from that current in the rest of Syria, this will no longer appear extraordinary to one who is acquainted with the circumstances. Almost every one of the more important cities in the neighbourhood of Palestine had during the Graeco-Roman period its own era, yea, even its own calendar (see Â§ 23). It is therefore quite conceivable that the Jews on adopting the imperial era should modify it in accordance with their calendar. We find, too, that exactly this same era was in use in the city of Damascus. The year began in Damascus and in the Roman province of Arabia in the spring (see Ideler, Handbuch der Chronologie, i. 413, 437). But the coins of Damascus are dated according to the Seleucid era. And although on an inscription discovered in recent times a specifically Damascene era is spoken of, this can mean nothing else than the Seleucid era beginning in spring, just as in our book.\n\nBy all that has been said, the question is not yet settled as to whether the era of our book begins half a year before or half a year after the date usually assigned, whether in spring B.C. 312 or in spring B.C. 311. The French scholar Gibert pronounces in favour of the former view. But the opinion generally accepted, that spring of B.C. 312 is the starting-point, can be proved to be certainly the right one. It will be enough here, apart from all other grounds, to refer to the remarks made in reference to the Sabbath year. If the year 150 of the Seleucid era were to be regarded, as Gibert desires, as equivalent to B.C. 162â161, then the Sabbath year must be fixed a year later, which would be in direct conflict with the date of the siege of Jerusalem by Herod and Sosius, with which Gibert can reconcile himself only by very artificial and far-fetched reasoning.\n\nThe era of the Second Book of Maccabees is still more open to dispute than that of the first book. We have also an apologetic interest in determining the era, inasmuch as certain dates of the second book are reconcilable with those of the first only if the years in each era were reckoned according to different eras. And, indeed, the era of the second book seems to have a later starting-point than that of the first. But in regard to this matter, too, the most diverse opinions prevail. Some assume half a yearâs difference, some a whole yearâs, and some a year and a half. The last mentioned is the view of Ideler, who dates the epoch of the first from spring B.C. 312, and that of the second from autumn B.C. 311. The dates upon which arguments are based are indeed very few; practically only the following two:â1. The death of Antiochus Epiphanes is set down in 1 Macc. 6:16 at the year 149 of the Seleucid era; whereas, according to 2 Macc. 11:33, he must have died at the latest in the year 148 of the Seleucid era, for there a decree of his successor Eupator is quoted, bearing the date of that year. 2. The second campaign of Lysias, according to 1 Macc. 6:20, was undertaken in the year 150 of the Seleucid era; whereas, according to 2 Macc. 13:1, it is placed in the Seleucid year 149. But in reference to the former date, the facts of the case are different from what at first appears. The subject treated of in 2 Macc. 11:33 is not really the date of the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, but rather the date of the first campaign of Lysias. And although 2 Macc. 11:33 assigns that event to the Seleucid year 148, this is quite reconcilable with 1 Macc. 4:28, 52. The difference consists, therefore, not in a diverse mode of reckoning time, but simply in this, that the Second Book of Maccabees erroneously sets down the first campaign of Lysias after the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, while both books agree in assigning it to the year 148 of the Seleucid era. In the other pair of passages, however,â1 Macc. 6:20 and 2 Macc. 13:1,âwe actually do come upon a diversity of dates. But Grimm on 2 Macc. 13:1 has justly remarked, after repeating his own earlier opinion, that one âcertainly does too much honour to the abounding historical and chronological errors of which the author of the second book has been convicted, by a great expenditure of combinations either in reconciling diversities, or in seeking, by the assumption of a different beginning of the Seleucid era, to explain the chronological difference between him and the First Book of the Maccabees.ââThere is therefore no sufficient ground for assuming a special era for the Second Book of the Maccabees. We have therefore before us the choice of regarding the era of that book as the Palestinian Seleucid era employed in the First Book of the Maccabees, or as the Seleucid era prevailing throughout the rest of Syria.\n\nCompare on the eras of the two Books of Maccabees: Froelich, Annales compendiarii regum et rerum Syriae (ed. 2, 1750), Proleg. p. 22 sqq.âWernsdorff, De fide historica librorum Maccabaicorum, 1747, pp. 18â31 (contests the view previously maintained by Scaliger, Petavius, Usher, Prideaux, Foy-Vaillant, des-Vignoles, Froelich, and others, that the era of the First Book of Maccabees begins with a spring year).âGibert, MÃ©moire sur la chronologie de lâhistoire des MachabÃ©es (MÃ©moires de lâAcadÃ©mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, alte sÃ©rie, t. xxvi. 1759, pp. 112â156).âClinton, Fasti Hellenici, iii. 375â382.âIdeler, Handbuch der Chronologie, i. 531â534.âWieseler, Die 70 Wochen und die 63 Jahrwochen des Propheten Daniel, 1839, p. 110 ff.

All special works on the Jewish history of our period known to us only through quotations or fragments, whether they are used by Josephus or not; and 2. Those of the more general historical works now lost, to which the exposition of Josephus is directly or indirectly indebted. To one or other of these categories belong all the works enumerated in the following paragraphs:â\n\n1. Jason of Cyrene\n\nHe wrote a work in five books on the history of the Maccabean rising, from its beginning down to the victory of Judas over Nicanor in B.C. 161. All this period is treated of in one book in our so-called Second Book of Maccabees: âAll these things being declared by Jason of Cyrene in five books, we shall essay to abridge in one volume,â 2 Macc. 2:23. He is supposed to have lived not long after the events which he narrates, somewhere about the middle of the second century B.C.; comp. Div. ii. vol. iii. p. 211.\n\n2. The History of John Hyrcanus\n\nA history of John Hyrcanus was known to the writer of the First Book of Maccabees: âThe chronicle of his priesthood,â 1 Macc. 16:24. This book, in a style similar to that of the First Book of Maccabees, described his long and honourable career. It seems to have got lost at an early date, for it was evidently unknown even to Josephus. Comp. Div. ii. vol. iii. p. 13.\n\n3. Posidonius of Apamea\n\nThe celebrated Stoic philosopher and historian Posidonius, from Apamea in Syria, lived chiefly in Rhodes, where he founded a Stoic School. He is hence called âthe Rhodian.â Since he was also a scholar of PanÃ¤tius, who at latest must have died B.C. 110, he cannot have been born later than B.C. 130. In the seventh consulship of Marius, B.C. 86, he went as ambassador to Rome, and there saw Marius shortly before his death (Plutarchâs Marius, chap. xlv.). Immediately after Sullaâs death (B.C. 78), Cicero heard him in Rhodes (Plutarchâs Cicero, chap. iv.). Pompey visited him there repeatedly. During the consulship of Marius Marcellus, B.C. 51, he went once more to Rome (Suidas, Lexicon, art. Î Î¿ÏÎµÎ¹Î´ÏÎ½Î¹Î¿Ï). He may therefore be described as having flourished between B.C. 90 and B.C. 50. According to Lucian. Macrob. chap. xx. he lived to the great age of eighty-four years. Of his numerous writings, it is his great historical work that here interests us. It is frequently quoted in the historical sketches of AthenÃ¤us, Strabo, Plutarch, and others. From the criticisms in AthenÃ¤us it would appear to have consisted of at least forty-nine books. It is not, therefore, open to doubt that Suidas (Lexicon, under the word Î Î¿ÏÎµÎ¹Î´ÏÎ½Î¹Î¿Ï) has this work in view when he makes the erroneous remark about the Alexandrian Posidonius: á¼Î³ÏÎ±ÏÎµÎ½ á¼¹ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î±Î½ Ïá½´Î½ Î¼ÎµÏá½° Î Î¿Î»ÏÎ²Î¹Î¿Î½ á¼Î½ Î²Î¹Î²Î»Î¯Î¿Ï Î½Î²Ê¹. The extant fragments, too, make it probable that the work begins where Polybius ends, with B.C. 146. How far down it carried the history is uncertain. It went on, according to Suidas, á¼ÏÏ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÏÎ¿Î»Î­Î¼Î¿Ï ÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÎÏ ÏÎ·Î½Î±ÏÎºÎ¿á¿¦ ÎºÎ±á½¶ Î ÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÎ¼Î±Î¯Î¿Ï . MÃ¼ller (Fragm. hist. graec. iii. 250) believes that instead of this we ought to read á¼ÏÏ ÏÎ¿á¿¦ Î ÏÎ¿Î»ÎµÎ¼Î±Î¯Î¿Ï ÏÎ¿á¿¦ ÎÏ ÏÎ·Î½Î±ÏÎºÎ¿á¿¦, that is, down to PtolemÃ¤us Apion of Cyrene, who died B.C. 96. The fact, too, that the fragments that have been preserved from the 47th and 49th books refer to the period from B.C. 100 to B.C. 90, goes to confirm this supposition. But, according to a fragment of considerable extent quoted by AthenÃ¤us, it appears that Posidonius also gave a detailed account of the history of the Athenian demagogue Athenio or Aristion, B.C. 87â86. And further, according to a notice in Strabo (xi. 1. 6), he also treated of the history of Pompey: Ïá½´Î½ á¼±ÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ¯Î±Î½ ÏÏ Î½Î­Î³ÏÎ±ÏÎµ Ïá½´Î½ ÏÎµÏá½¶ Î±á½ÏÏÎ½. From this MÃ¼ller concludes that Posidonius had dealt with the period after B.C. 96 in a âsecond part,â or a continuation of his great work. This elaborate hypothesis, however, has no substantial support in the evidently corrupted words of Suidas. The fifty-two books may have quite easily embraced the period from B.C. 87â86, and the work, as Scheppig maintains, may have been brought down to that time. Arnold would have it carried down even to B.C. 82. Much further it certainly could not have extended, since in the 47th and 49th books the writer had got no farther than the period B.C. 100âB.C. 90. The history of Pompey must therefore have formed a separate work.\n\nThe great work of Posidonius was held in high esteem by later historians, who seemed to have used it as they did Polybius, as a principal source for the period of which it treats. It is certain that Diodorus has drawn upon it (MÃ¼ller, Fragmenta, t. ii. p. 20, t. iii. p. 251). But even Trogus Pompeius refers to it as an authority (see Heeren in: Com. Soc. Sc. GÃ¶tt. t. xv. 1804, pp. 185â245; Teuffel, History of Roman Literature, Â§ 258. 4, and the literature given there). And so probably it was used by most who treated of this period. It is therefore highly probable that the passages in Josephus which deal with that time are essentially based upon Posidonius,ânot indeed directly, but indirectly, as he had found him quoted and used by Strabo and Nicolaus Damascenus.\n\nJosephus used Strabo and Nicolas as authorities of the first order for the period referred to. That Strabo had made use of Posidonius in the composition of his history is abundantly evident, for he quotes him frequently and with great respect in his Geography (ii. 102, xvi. 753). In Nicolaus Damascenus, too, there are unmistakeable traces of use having been made of Posidonius (MÃ¼ller, iii. 415).âJosephus mentions Posidonius only once, in his Treatise against Apion, ii. 7. Strongly marked resemblances, however, are discernible between his exposition and that of Diodorus and Trogus Pompeius. Compare the account of the conquest of Jerusalem by Antiochus Sidetes in Josephus, Antiq. xiii. 8. 2â3, and in Diodorus, xxxiv. 1; and that of the Parthian war of Demetrius II. in Josephus, Antiq. xiii. 5. 11, and in Justin, i.e. Trogus Pompeius, xxxvi. 1. 3. If, then, these twoâDiodorus and Trogus Pompeiusârely upon Posidonius, then so also does Josephus. Further details in Nussbaum, Observ. in Fl. Jos.
