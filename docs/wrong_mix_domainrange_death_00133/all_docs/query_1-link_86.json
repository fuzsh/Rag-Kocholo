Edition originale. ---- EDITION ORIGINALE ---- BON EXEMPLAIRE ---- Hamburgi & Kilonii, Bohnii, 1778, un volume in 8 relié en pleine basane, dos orné de fers et filets dorés, filets dorés sur les plats (reliure de l'époque), (rousseurs, mouillures pâles dans les marges, petite piqure de vers sans gravité à un mors), (6), 178pp. ---- \"A NEW CONTRIBUTION TO INSECT SYSTEMATICS\" (DSB) ---- \"Fabricius was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished entomologists and ranks with Carl de Geer, P.A. Latreille, A.G. Oliver and other prominent specialists of earlier times. In many respects he surpassed them, especially as a theoretical natural scientist. Linnaeus, whose most important contribution hardly lay in the field of entomology, was full of admiration for him and his colleagues throughout the world expressed great respect for his work. Two basic principles guided Fabricius' approach to entomological systematics : he distinguished, on the one hand, between the artificial and the natural characters ; and, on the other hand, he stressed the importance of the various structures of the mouth. He founded his sytem on the genus and the species which in his opinion constituted the main bases. It seemed especially important to Fabricius that genera were the natural combinations of related species. He believed that \"classes\" and \"ordines\" were artificial concepts. He seems to have understood that even genera can be classified into the natural system - the nearest equivalent to our present \"families\" - but he probably understood that the time was not yet ripe, that scientific knowledge and general outlook were too narrow for such classification. He thought of one large system based on the structure of the mouth organs as being the natural system. It was Fabricius'greatest ambition to build a system based on the naturally defined genera, without doubt a definite and new contribution to insect systematics. He considered this more important than a dry description of the various species.\". (DSB IV pp. 512/513)**2023/ARM1D.\n\n[12], 178 pp. 1 vols. 8vo. First edition. First edition.

Fabricius first major work on the system and theory of entomology, and perhaps his greatest theoretical contribution to the science. \"Fabricius was undoubtedly one of the most distinguished entomologists and ranks with Carl de Geer, P.A.
