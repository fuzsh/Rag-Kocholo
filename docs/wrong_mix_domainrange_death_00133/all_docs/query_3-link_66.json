        "text": "Results of the search of the fi rst use of nominal family-group names of extant fi shes and fish-like vertebrates of the World (superclasses Myxinomorphi and Petromyzontomorphi, grades Chondrichthiomorphi and Teleostomi) are presented. Only additions, corrections, and commentary on published names and to the version 2 of “Family Group Names of Fishes” on the site “Catalog of Fishes” (W.N. Eschmeyer et al., Oct. 2, 2012) are provided. They concern 1135 names. The present paper contains 402 additionally uncovered names and 418 earlier publications of names. Availability or unavailability is demonstrated for 1068 names. Homonymy of 29 names, objective synonymy of 41 names, and objective invalidity of 83 names are established. Authorship, date and/or source for 314 names are defined more precisely. The grammatically correct stem for all mentioned available and potentially available family-group names is established. The version of the structure of the account of nominal family-group name is proposed.\n\nAddenda to and errata of: Van der Laan, R., W. N. Eschmeyer & R. Fricke (2014) (11 Nov.), Family-group names of Recent fishes. Zootaxa Monograph 3882 (1), 1-230. [article 2 in the header should be article 1] http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.3882.1.1 The family-group names are presented in the same way as in our article (please consult this article for more explanation): Original name and spelling [correction of obvious type-setting error] author year: page number [reference] (rank) type Genus [comments on spelling correction of the stem / availability / validity]\n\nThe family-group names of animals (superfamily, family, subfamily, supertribe, tribe and subtribe) are regulated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Particularly, the family names are very important, because they are among the most widely used of all technical animal names. A uniform name and spelling are essential for the location of information. To facilitate this, a list of family-group names for fossil fishes has been compiled. I use the concept ‘Fishes’ in the usual sense, i.e., starting with the Agnatha up to the †Osteolepidiformes. All the family-group names proposed for fossil fishes found to date are listed, together with their author(s) and year of publication. The main goal of the list is to contribute to the usage of the correct family-group names for fossil fishes with a uniform spelling and to list the author(s) and date of those names. No valid family-group name description could be located for the following family-group names currently in usage: †Br...\n\nThe family-group names of animals (superfamily, family, subfamily, supertribe, tribe and subtribe) are regulated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Family names are particularly important because they are among the most widely used of all technical animal names. Apart from using the correct family-group name according to the Code, it is also important to use one unique universal name (with a fixed spelling) to avoid confusion. We have compiled a list of familygroup names for Recent fishes, applied the rules of the Code and, if possible, tried to conserve the names in prevailing recent practice. We list all of the family-group names found to date for Recent fishes (N=2625), together with their author(s) and year of publication. This list can be used in assigning the correct family-group name to a genus or a group of genera. With this publication we contribute to the usage of correct, universal family-group names in the classification of, and for communication about, Recent fishes."
