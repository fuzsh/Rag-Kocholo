Fun Facts About Angela: üé∂ I find solace in melodies, and stitching stories through cross-stitching, sketching, and the artistry of cooking. üñåÔ∏è For me, art is a sanctuary, a release from the stresses of life. Life Motto: \"I am only one, but still I am one; I cannot do everything, but I can do something.\" This belief guides my every stroke and adds purpose to my creations.

Why must Basquiat only exist via his painting? As much as I love art, I may never be able to buy an actual paiting, but I will be able to have my piece of Basquiat via purchasing a t-shirt, a Basquiat-decorated bottle of rhum/whisky. Another reminder for artists to think, plan, map out their career in life and in death. https://lnkd.in/ePnE7e_f\n\nFancy painting a portrait with poison? Famous artists such as Michelangelo, Caravaggio, van Gogh, and Frida Kahlo did, using toxic lead paints in their artwork. It's suspected they suffered lead poisoning because they displayed a variety of disorders and serious health conditions, sometimes called ‚Äòpainter's madness‚Äô. Watch our final video üëá to learn more about the deadliest colour through the millennia. Read more about the varied history of lead on Science at work: https://ow.ly/3Gvc50Q1WOK Why is the EPA talking about lead? Because we want submissions about changes to rules for lead levels in paints, and in art materials such as chalk, crayons, and felt-tip pens. #sciencecommunication\n\nIn celebration of the artistic spirit, we at DailyArt are delighted to present a special feature on a remarkable female artist from the #FaroeIslands‚ÄìRuth Smith. Join us in an exploration of her life and learn about the masterpieces she crafted. Our focus here is on unraveling the essence of #RuthSmith‚Äìher Faroese identity, her #womanhood, and the sheer fabulousness that defined her. All three tie into the leading questions: What did it mean for her to be Faroese? To be a woman? And, how does that reflect in her #art?\n\nReflecting upon her childhood and showing you her grandmother's sketchbook, Adrienne tells you why art is so important to her and is a key part of her story. We want to know #WhatTellsYourStory Please take a photograph or video of you and your item, and tell us how it changed your life and tag @ButtleUK #WhatTellsYourStory\n\nüì∏ There are a heap of reasons you may want a portrait. ‚≠ê Personal or Family Legacy: To capture a moment in time and create a lasting legacy for family and friends to love for generations. ‚≠êGifts: Portraits can be given as gifts to loved ones, friends, or colleagues to commemorate a milestone, special occasion or to honor a relationship. ‚≠êMemorials: You may not have much time left with a loved one and a portait can serve as a meaningful tribute. ‚≠êProfessional or Public Representation: Business professionals, politicians, and public figures use portraits to enhance their public image. ‚≠êArtistic Expression: Individuals may commission a portrait as a form of artistic expression. ‚≠êHistorical Record: Portraits can serve as historical records, capturing the likeness of individuals for posterity. üì∏As you can see there are many reasons why people would commission a portrait.
