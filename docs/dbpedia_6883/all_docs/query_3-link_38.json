        "text": "Sibylle Szaggars is an accomplished painter and artist, skilled in oil sketches, oil paintings and watercolors. The German, who is also an environmental artist and whose work sheds light on the dangers of climate change, has had her work exhibited in various parts of the world, including Italy, America, Monaco, Japan, Germany and England.\n\nAside from her illustrious career, Szaggars is better known as the wife of acclaimed Hollywood actor and director Robert Redford. They tied the knot in 2009 after a relationship of more than ten years. Find out more about her here, including her bio and what she does for a living.\n\nSibylle Szaggar’s bio\n\nSibylle Szaggars was born on April 14, 1957 in Germany, specifically the city of Hamburg. There isn’t much information about her parents, possible siblings, or her educational background. However, what is known is that she is a natural born artist. She reportedly started drawing and painting when she was a child.\n\nIn her teenage years, Szaggars had the opportunity to travel to different parts of the world with her family. They lived in exotic places like Malaysia, Morocco and different parts of Europe. This gave the young girl the opportunity to learn about and appreciate other people’s cultures and traditions. It also provided her with tremendous raw materials that formed the subject of her art.\n\nSibylle Szaggars started her professional career in London in the 80s. She endured humble beginnings with her first studio being on the roof of a warehouse in London. Due to the fact that she was just starting out, her work has been limited to group exhibitions in galleries in the UK as well as in her hometown of Hamburg. She made London her home until she moved to Utah, USA, in the 1990s."
