        "text": "The artist and environmentalist is asking almost $4 million for the property near Redford's Sundance Resort, where they met in 1996\n\nSibylle Szaggars Redford is letting go of a home with sentimental ties to the early days of her relationship with husband Robert Redford.\n\nThe multimedia artist and avid environmentalist, who married the film icon, 87, in 2009, has listed her four-bedroom, five-bathroom home in Utah for $3,995,000, PEOPLE can exclusively confirm.\n\nThe property is located near Redford's Sundance Mountain Resort, where the couple met.\n\n“This home is truly near and dear to my heart,” Szaggars Redford tells PEOPLE. “It has been part of my story and a source of inspiration for my journey as an artist and an environmental activist. For years. I’ve relished in the sheer beauty of the setting, which is as serene and unspoiled as it is breathtaking.”\n\nRelated: Robert Redford Sells Picture-Perfect Napa Valley Estate for $7 Million-See Inside\n\nThe mountain home is perched in a forest of pines looking toward Mount Timpanogos. It is also near waterfalls, and all of the beauty of pristine nature.\n\n“Sibylle is selling the property because she is spending more time in Santa Fe, New Mexico, creating new art and focusing on her fine art gallery, Sibylle Szaggars Redford Fine Art,” Jaisa Bishop, listing agent with Windermere Real Estate/Luxury Portfolio International, tells PEOPLE.\n\nThe artist/activist is also concentrating on her Santa Fe based non-profit organization, The Way of Rain, which highlights educational and artistic performances to protect the environment and promote global conservation efforts.\n\nThe organization is named after a performance art piece of the same name that she debuted in 2013. Robert Redford is vice president of her board of directors, and told AARP, the Magazine in 2011, that his wife is a “very special person” who gave him a “whole new life.”\n\nThe couple, who share many interests, have spent a great deal of their relationship working together to protect the environment and advocate for change where needed.\n\nBishop says the home is a standout because it integrates nature’s glory through its architecture and designs, including the living room with its wall of windows and soaring, 27-foot ceiling; natural and elegant finishes; and the way it sits effortlessly in nature. There is also a grand wood fireplace for coziness on cool nights.\n\nRelated: Who Is Robert Redford's Wife? All About Sibylle Szaggars\n\n“This is one of the most majestic and serene environments that you can ask for as a creator and an artist,” Bishop continues. “It’s no wonder Sibylle found such inspiration and created such compelling pieces that inspire others to embrace nature conservancy in an elevated way.”\n\nIn fact, the three-level, 3,536-square-foot home is a showplace for some of her works of art. She has placed several around the rooms.\n\n“Just looking out the windows or standing on the terrace have become catalysts for the creation of a number of my most treasured paintings,” Szaggars Redford says of her landscapes, like nearby Provo Peak and another of Mount Timpanogos.\n\nFrom the main suite, she says she was able to gaze into the forest and listen to the summer rain. On the second floor, there are two guest rooms, each with its own bathroom. One has a private jacuzzi-sized patio.\n\nThe top floor is the artist’s retreat with unmatched views. The lower guest wing can be entered privately. It has a separate kitchenette, studio living area, full bath, and private deck providing plenty of space for the owner and for guests.\n\nThe sale includes the adjoining .62 acre lot which brings the total acreage offered to 1.43. The community is gated, and the home can be registered in the short-term Sundance Mountain Resort pool. It also offers easy access to the resort, which offers activities in all four seasons,\n\nGerman-born Szaggars Redford, whose work in different mediums has been displayed and performed around the world, used this home as a “jumping off” point by traveling to the Four Corners area to study American culture and landscapes, which also inspired her art. Paintings of a desert landscape and kachina masks were created in the basement apartment of the property (which was a studio).\n\n“My hope is that the next steward will love and enjoy this haven as much as I have,” Szaggars Redford says. “And even be influenced by its uniqueness.”\n\nRedford let go of a significant piece of real estate himself in recent years, selling his hilltop estate in California's Napa Valley for a reported $7 million in 2018.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
