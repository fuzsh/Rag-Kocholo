        "text": "Robert Redford is a famous American actor, known for his leading roles in movies such as \"The Great Gatsby\" and \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\" Redford was a prominent heartthrob among women in the 60s and 70s, despite being married to Lola Van Wagenen at the peak of his on-screen success.\n\nIn the past decade, Redford has turned his hand increasingly towards production credits behind the scenes. Most recently, he was an executive producer on CNN's \"Death Row Stories\" and AMC's upcoming tv show \"Dark Winds\" alongside \"Game of Thrones\" author George R.R. Martin. Redford's most recent live-acting role was in 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame.\" Perhaps Redford's openness to trying new things is linked to his philosophy on life, as he told Collider, \"I think I have always looked forward, so I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about the past unless there's some value in bringing the past forward in storytelling, but that's all.\"\n\nSo it's really no surprise that when Redford got divorced from Van Wagenen in 1985, he looked forward to a new love, remarrying Sibylle Szaggars in 2009. So who is Szaggars? We take a look into her background after the jump.\n\nBefore divorcing, actor Robert Redford and historian Lola Van Wagenen welcomed four children together — Scott Anthony, David James, Shauna Jean, and Amy Hart. Redford tends to be a private person, but he did discuss his divorce to The Guardian in 2004, saying, \"I got married very young, at 21. Obviously I don't want to denigrate the person I married, there were a lot of good reasons ... But when you ask me a question, like why? I have to say it was to save my life. That's what it felt like at the time.\"\n\nRobert Redford then met German painter Sibylle Szaggars at the Sundance festival in the late 90s, before getting married in 2009, per Reuters. Although the pair have no children together, they have been together ever since. The couple is quite private and not much is known about their marriage, with the closest details coming from a 2011 interview he did with AARP. Redford said of his second wife, \"She's a very special person... She's younger than I am, and European, which I like, so that's a whole new life.\"\n\nSzaggars also has a website dedicated to her art, where it details her various accomplishments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Szaggars also collaborated with her husband and composer Tim Janis to create \"The Way of the Rain – Reflections on Earth\" video series, which explores \"the issue of climate change resulting in rapidly changing weather patterns.\""
