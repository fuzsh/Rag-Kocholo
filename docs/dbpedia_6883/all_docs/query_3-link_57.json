        "text": "Robert Redford's costar Jane Fonda revealed that the actor didn't like kissing but was generally a good person with whom she had a good time.\n\nRedford is married to a visual artist. He calls his wife, Sibylle Szaggars, who he has known for over 25 years, his \"very special person.\"\n\nThe actor was previously married to Lola Van Wagenen, with whom he had four kids. Redford lost two of his kids, but he now finds joy in prioritizing his five grandkids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Redford is a legendary actor who has appeared in dozens of movies and TV series over 60 years. He made his TV debut in the 1960s.\n\nOne of his costars, Jane Fonda, recently revealed some intricate details about Redford. Redford and Fonda starred together in the movies, \"Barefoot in the Park\" and \"The Electric Horseman.\"\n\nRobert Redford's portrait in 1970 | Source: Getty Images\n\nFonda said she was in love with Redford when they worked together, but he didn't love hugging on-screen and never kept a positive attitude while filming. She remarked:\n\n\"He did not like to kiss. I never said anything. And he's always in a bad mood, and I always thought it was my fault.\"\n\nHowever, Fonda said Redford was a good person and that they always had a good time together. She noted that Redford's only problem was he had issues with women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Redford in Utah in March 1979 | Source: Getty Images\n\nFonda and Redford worked together again in their older years. They both featured in the film, \"Our Souls at Night,\" which was released in 2017.\n\nThis time, Fonda said she finally knew Redford's moods had nothing to do with her. She revealed that Redford would come to set three hours late and in a bad mood, but that never bothered her anymore.\n\nRobert Redford and Jane Fonda in New York City on September 27, 2017 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from acting, Redford is also a family man who has been married twice. The actor has been blessed with kids and is now a grandfather.\n\nRedford admitted that his child's death at such a young age created a scar that never healed because, as a parent, one ends up blaming themselves.\n\nRobert Redford and Jane Fonda pose for a studio portrait for the film \"Barefoot in the Park\" in 1967 | Source: Getty Images\n\nRobert Redford Is Married to His \"Very Special Person.\"\n\nRedford met his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, in 1996. The pair were in a relationship for years before they tied the knot in July 2009 in Szaggars' home country, Germany.\n\nThe actor's and Szaggars' relationship has lasted over 25 years. Redford is smitten with his wife as he said:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"She's a very special person. She's younger than I am, and European, which I like, so that's a whole new life.\"\n\nSibylle Szaggars and Robert Redford in Hollywood, California on March 24, 2002 | Source: Getty Images\n\nSzaggars is a creative like Redford, but she has taken a different approach. The actor's wife is a visual artist who works with varied styles to create her art.\n\nHer website indicates that she does oil painting and photography with the main aim of spreading environmental awareness.\n\nOn her website, the visual artist revealed that her art is created to speak to a profound universal consciousness that is connected and dependent on the earth and its environment.\n\nRobert Redford and Sibylle Szaggars in Cannes, France on May 22, 2013 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSzaggars has also created video and performance art. She collaborated with musician David Thor Jonsson to create a series called \"The Way of the Rain.\"\n\nShe then worked with composer Tim Janis to create video series titled \"The Way of the Rain-Reflections on Earth.\"\n\nSzaggars' work has been featured in the US Embassy in Suriname Bureau of Overseas Building Operation's \"Art In Embassies\" program.\n\nSibylle Szaggars and Robert Redford in New York City on April 27, 2015 | Source: Getty Images\n\nBefore Redford married Szaggars, he was married to a historian, Lola Van Wagenen, from 1958 to 1985.\n\nWagenen has a Ph.D. in American History from New York University. The pair got married when they were very young adults.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey were blessed with four kids throughout their relationship but unfortunately lost two.\n\nRobert Redford and Lola Van Wagenen 1981 in Los Angeles, California | Source: Getty Images\n\nRobert Redford Lost 2 Sons, but He Is Happy to Have Grandkids\n\nRedford and Wagenen welcomed their first child in Scott on September 1, 1959. Unfortunately, Scott died in infancy of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nRedford admitted that his child's death at such a young age created a scar that never healed because, as a parent, one ends up blaming themselves:\n\n\"We were very young. I had my first theater job, which didn't pay much. We didn't know anything about SIDS, so the only thing you think is that you've done something wrong.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Redford with Lola Van Wagenen and kids Jamie and Shauna in New York City on June 15, 1969 | Source: Getty Images\n\nThe ex-couple went on to have three more kids. Their second child Shauna was born on November 15, 1960, and James, in 1962, and their youngest, a daughter named Amy, was born on October 22, 1970.\n\nRedford's and Wagenen's kids grew into successful adults who pursued creative careers. James became a film director, and unfortunately, at the age of 58, he died after battling liver cancer.\n\nSadly, Redford and his ex-wife lost their second child in mid-October 2022. James's wife, Kyle Redford, eulogized his husband:\n\n\"Jamie died today. We're heartbroken. He lived a beautiful, impactful life and was loved by many. He will be deeply missed. As his wife of 32 years, I'm most grateful for the two spectacular children we raised together.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThroughout his career, James directed and wrote award-winning TV movies and series such as \"Toxic Hot Seat\" and \"The Big Picture: Rethinking Dyslexia.\" James and Kyle, whom he married in 1999, had two kids, Dina Redford and Lena Redford.\n\nRedford's representative, Cindi Berger, released a statement on his behalf after his son died. The statement noted:\n\n\"The grief is immeasurable with the loss of a child. Jamie was a loving son, husband, and father. His legacy lives on through his children, art, filmmaking, and devoted passion to conservation and the environment.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Redford and James Redford in Hollywood, California, during the screening of \"Spin\" | Source: Getty Images\n\nJames, who had health issues since he was young, was diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, a rare autoimmune disease affecting the liver. He received two liver transplants in 1993.\n\nThe film director then founded a nonprofit, the \"James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness,\" which educates the public about organ and tissue donations.\n\nSibylle Szaggars and Robert Redford in Flushing Meadows, New York, in August 2005 | Source: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRedford's first daughter, Shauna, didn't follow his father's career in Hollywood but is a successful painter. The artist is married to Eric Schlosser, whom she has two kids with, Conor Schlosser and Mica Schlosser.\n\nThe 86-year-old youngest daughter, Amy, is an actor, director, and producer. She made her debut in acting when she featured in \"Dellaventura\" in 1998. Amy has appeared in other movies, including \"Cry Funny Happy\" and \"When I Find The Ocean.\"\n\nThe director was married to Mark Mann from 2000 to 2004. She has a daughter, Eden August, with her partner Matt August.\n\nRobert Redford at Venice Lido on September 1, 2017 | Source: Getty Images\n\nRedford lost his two sons, but he enjoys being there for his grandkids. The actor told his grandson Dylan that as much as he was a celebrity, his role as a grandparent took priority over everything else.\n\nSubscribe to AmoMama on Google News!"
