They were wed six months later in October 1978, according to an announcement in The Lewiston Daily Sun.\n\nWhile it's unknown if they have plans to legally separate or divorce, the two have not been seen in public together since walking the red carpet of the 2018 Academy Awards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Jackman (née Furness) announced their separation in September 2023, five months after their 27th anniversary.\n\nPeople reported the news on September 15 with a statement from the former couple. They called their 27 years together a \"loving marriage\" and said their \"journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.\" They also said this would be their \"sole statement\" on the subject.\n\nJackman and Furness share two children, People reported.\n\nThe \"Logan\" star celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary in April 2023 on Instagram.\n\n\"Together we have created a beautiful family. And life,\" he wrote. \"I love you with all my heart.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDan Aykroyd and Donna Dixon announced their separation in April 2022 after 39 years together.\n\nAykroyd and Dixon got together in 1983, when they tied the knot after starring in \"Doctor Detroit,\" People reported. They appeared in multiple other projects together after their wedding, including \"Spies Like Us\" and \"Exit to Eden.\" They share three daughters.\n\nIn April 2022, the couple announced their split, but also their intention to stay legally married.\n\n\"After 39 years as a couple we are now on separate life paths. We remain legally married, co-parents, co-workers and business partners,\" the couple told People in a joint statement. \"This is our choice in loving friendship.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus and Tish Cyrus filed for divorce after 28 years of marriage, from 1993 to April 2022.\n\nThe Cyruses, who share five kids including Miley and Noah Cyrus, wed in 1993.\n\nThe estranged couple have filed for divorce before, in 2010 and 2013, but this time appears to be different. According to court documents obtained by People in 2022, the exes had been separated for two years.\n\nIn August 2023, Tish married \"Prison Break\" star Dominic Purcell, according to Vogue. Billy Ray has been engaged to Australian singer Firerose since August 2022, he told People.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner were officially divorced in 2015 after 24 years of marriage.\n\nThe Jenners' relationship was shown on \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" from the very first episode, though by that point they'd already been married for 16 years and shared two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.\n\nBut viewers watched their relationship slowly deteriorate on the show, and the two reality stars announced their separation in 2013, and Kris filed for divorce in 2014, The Guardian reported. The split was legalized by 2015, E! News reported.\n\nAfter the divorce, in June 2015, the former Olympic athlete announced that she is a trans woman in Vanity Fair and began going by Caitlyn.

Fans were shocked when they announced their breakup in 2009 in a statement to ABC News in December 2009.\n\n\"You can't do a meditation on death and stay in a situation that's not authentic,\" Sarandon told AARP Magazine in February 2014, about how performing in the play \"Exit the King\" made her question her life. \"It made me examine where I was in my union and in my life, and to have discussions about making changes.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Rock was married to Malaak Compton-Rock for 20 years, from 1996 to 2016.\n\nThe former \"SNL\" star and recipient of a certain slap married Compton a few years after he left the famous sketch show.

In total, they had been married for 35 years.\n\nDuring a Reddit AMA in 2014, Schwarzenegger said, \"I'm least proud of the mistakes I made that caused my family pain and split us up.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMorgan Freeman and Myrna Colley-Lee were married for 26 years before their split in 2010.\n\nSimilarly to other couples on this list, Freeman and Colley-Lee were separated for three years before their divorce was finalized — in this case, they separated in 2007, Today reported, and were divorced in 2010, according to an Associated Press report published by the New York Daily News.\n\n\"It was done without a trial,\" Freeman's lawyer William R. Wright told AP. \"Everybody is glad it's over.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAl and Tipper Gore were married for 40 years.

They were legally married for 20 years.\n\nFord wed screenwriter Mathison, who died in 2015, in 1984, right after his iconic role as Han Solo in \"Star Wars\" concluded. They had two children together.\n\nIn 2000, news broke that they had separated, reported ABC News, and Ford had been spotted with actress Lara Flynn Boyle.\n\nBy the time their divorce had been finalized in 2004, Ford had begun living with his now-wife Calista Flockhart, Today reported. Ford and Flockhart are now one of Hollywood's longest-lasting couples themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale were together on-and-off from 1995 to 2015, before finalizing their divorce in 2016.\n\nStefani and Rossdale met in 1995 when their bands (No Doubt and Bush, respectively) were performing for a local radio station. They dated for six years before getting married in 2002, Rolling Stone reported. The rock stars went on to have three sons together.\n\nHowever, in August 2015, news of their divorce broke with Stefani claiming \"irreconcilable differences,\" TMZ reported. Over time, it was revealed that the breakup was much messier than it appeared with allegations of infidelity against Rossdale, Us Weekly reported.\n\nThe divorce was made official in April 2016, TMZ reported.\n\n\"It wasn't until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, 'God gave me a gift. I'm going to use it now. Because if I don't, I'm going to die,'\" Stefani told Time in March 2016, on how her divorce helped her music.\n\nShe married Blake Shelton in July 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Redford was married to Lola Van Wagenen for 27 years, from 1958 to 1985.\n\nRedford is one of the most famous sex symbols of all time, but in actuality, he was married for the biggest parts of his career. He was just 22 years old when he married Van Wagenen in 1958.\n\nRedford and Van Wagenen had four kids together, including one son who died at 2 months old due to sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS.\n\nIn 1985, after almost 30 years of marriage, they split.\n\n\"It was mutual and it was right to move on,\" Redford told The Telegraph in 2001. \"We still have great love, great affection, great friendship. It is wonderful, and I think we probably deserve credit for it because the kids are great, they came through it OK.\"\n\nRead next\n\nCelebrities Celebrity Couples Dating\n\nAdvertisement"
