We travelled from Betmar to Silver Oaks and to Zephyr Park. Was surprised that Zephyr Park could hold a little more water than what is there. So according to the sources we talked to the pumping will continue but will go to Eiland Pond – West of Betmar, which will affect us, coming in off Dean Dairy, we just need to pray that any tropical storms don’t dump any rain our way. The properties team tested our pumps, and we are ready with 3 pumps should they be needed in the future. Thank you for all the support of the Betmarians.

Her instructor suddenly gets a heart attack and dies. “Mayday, mayday!! Help me, help me! My instructor pilot is dead, and I don’t know how to fly.”\n\nShe hears a voice over the radio saying this is air traffic control. ”We can hear you loud and clear. I will talk you through this and get you back on the ground safely. I have a lot of experience with this kind of problem. Now just take a deep breath. Everything will be fine. Give me your height and position.”\n\nMelinda replies, “I’m 57 and in the front seat.”\n\nAfter a long pause the air traffic controller says, “OK, now repeat after me… Our Father, who art in Heaven…\n\nANNIVERSARIES\n\nSandy and Dewey Coon will celebrate their 9th Anniversary on August 28th\n\nBIRTHDAY\n\nROB SHAFFER 62 YEARS AUG 26TH\n\nNEW RESIDENT\n\nNew Residents Joy, Richard, and Ryan Costa on Mary Street\n\nSICK BAY\n\nLORNA LODING\n\nTo Submit a Guest Announcement, Click HERE\n\nTo Submit a Birthday Announcement, Click HERE"
