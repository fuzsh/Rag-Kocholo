        "text": "The screen legend, once notoriously private about his personal life, has announced he is to wed long-term girlfriend Sibylle Szaggars, 19 years his junior.\n\nBut Redford, who was last married 23 years ago, does not seem to be in any great rush to tie the knot with the\n\n52-year-old German artist.\n\n“We are engaged and very happy with that,” the star told German magazine Bunte. “She [Sibylle] is my fiancee, and that says everything, doesn’t it?”\n\nRedford and his first wife, Lola Van Wagenen, divorced in 1985, but it took almost a decade for the world’s media to confirm the story, so determined was the star to protect his family from publicity.\n\nThe couple had a son, Jamie, now 46, and two daughters, Shauna, 48, and Amy, 38. They lost another son, Scott, to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.\n\nSibylle, who is said to have the full support of Redford’s children, has dated him since 1996.\n\nThey live at his 5,500-acre eco-friendly ranch in Utah and at his nearby mountain resort of Sundance. Sibylle has a studio there where she works on her Native American-inspired art.\n\nRedford was one of the greatest movie heart-throbs of the 1960s and 1970s. His most famous role was probably opposite Paul Newman in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. He named his ski resort after his character in the film.\n\nBefore dating Sibylle, the Oscar-winning actor and director was linked to actress Sonia Braga and costume designer Kathy O’Rear."
