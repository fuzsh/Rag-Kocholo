        "text": "LEGENDARY Hollywood actor Robert Redford has starred in some of the most critically-acclaimed and commercially successful movies of all time.\n\nBut away from the film industry, the Sundance Kid star has suffered a number of personal tragedies with his son James dying from liver cancer on October 17, 2020 - the second of his four children to pass away.\n\nWho is Robert Redford?\n\nRobert Redford was born in Santa Monica, California, on August 18, 1936.\n\nAfter graduating from high school he attended the University of Colorado for a year and a half before he was kicked out.\n\nHe travelled in Europe before studying painting in New York City, and went on to take acting classes at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.\n\nHis first acting roles were on stage, with Redford making his Broadway debut in 1959 with a small part in Tall Story.\n\nFrom 1960 he began starring in TV shows, earning an Emmy nomination for his performance in The Voice Of Charlie Pont.\n\nHowever, it was his starring movie roles that made Redford a global icon, winning a Golden Globe for best new star for 1965's In Daisy Clover.\n\nHis performance in Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid catapulted him into superstardom, and he went on to star in a series of blockbuster movies, winning a Best Actor Oscar nomination in 1973 for The Sting.\n\nRedford has also become a hugely acclaimed director, winning the Academy Award for Best Director for 1980's Ordinary People, which also scooped Best Picture.\n\nThe 84-year-old received another Oscar, a lifetime achievement award, in 2002, and was recognised with a Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2016.\n\nIn 1981, the screen legend founded the Sundance Institute, named after his iconic character in the movie which made him a global star.\n\nThe non-profit organisation is committed to the support and growth of independent artists, and spawned the massively successful Sundance Film Festival which takes place in Utah every year.\n\nRedford's role in championing independent film saw him labelled The Godfather of Indie Film by Time magazine, who named him one of the Most Influential People in the World in 2014.\n\nAway from the screen, Redford is an avid environmentalist and a supporter of Native American and LGBT rights.\n\nOn August 6, 2018, the icon announced he was officially retiring from acting after the release of crime comedy The Old Man & the Gun.\n\nWhat are Robert Redford's biggest movies?\n\nIn his long, illustrious film career Redford has starred in and directed some of Hollywood's biggest movies of all time:\n\nButch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid (1969)\n\nJeremiah Johnson (1972)\n\nThe Sting (1973)\n\nAll The President's Men (1976)\n\nA Bridge Too Far (1977)\n\nOrdinary People (director - 1980)\n\nBrubaker (1980)\n\nOut Of Africa (1985)\n\nA River Runs Through It (1992)\n\nQuiz Show (director - 1995)\n\nSpy Game (2001)\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)\n\nA Walk In The Woods (2015)\n\nEarth: One Amazing Day (narrator - 2018)\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2018)\n\nHas Robert Redford ever dated Jane Fonda?\n\nRedford has played the love interest of fellow Hollywood icon Jane Fonda in several movies, with the duo sharing some steamy on-screen moments.\n\nHowever, despite their sizzling chemistry, the acting legends have never dated in real life, despite Fonda cheekily admitting in 2017 that she \"lives for sex scenes with him\".\n\nShe told the Venice Film Festival: \"He’s a great kisser, so it was fun to kiss him in my 20s and to kiss him again in my almost 80s.\"\n\nRedford and Fonda have played lovers in The Chase, Barefoot In The Park, The Electric Horseman and 2017's Netflix romantic drama Our Souls At Night.\n\nWho is Robert Redford's wife?\n\nRedford married Lola Van Wagenen, who dropped out of college to tie the knot with the actor, in 1958 at her grandmother's home.\n\nLola became a historian and environmental activist - but the pair divorced in 1985.\n\nRedford married his second wife, longtime partner Sibylle Szaggars, in July 2009 in Hamburg.\n\nHow many children does Robert Redford have?\n\nRobert and Lola had four children - two boys and two girls.\n\nTheir first, Scott Anthony, suffered sudden infant death syndrome, passing away at just two-and-a-half months old in 1959.\n\nShauna Jean was welcomed on November 15, 1960, before David James was born May 5, 1962.\n\nBut James died on October 17, 2020, after a long battle with liver cancer.\n\nRobert and Lola's youngest Amy Hart was born on October 22, 1970, and is an actress, director and producer like her father.\n\nRobert also has seven grandchildren."
