        "text": "Marin County, Calif. – James “Jamie” Redford was on a righteous mission. The activist filmmaker created documentaries that spoke of the ills society is facing, including “Toxic Hot Seat” (chemicals in households), “Paper Tigers” (childhood psychology), “Resilence” (a deeper dive into Adverse Childhood Experience) and his recent “Happening: A Clean Energy Revolution.” Jamie Redford died of bile duct cancer on October 16th, 2020, at his home in Marin County, California. He was 58.\n\nDavid James Redford was born in New York City, the same month his father Robert appeared in his first film. Throughout his life he fought health issues, and was diagnosed with sclerosis cholangitis while in college, which led later to two liver transplants in the early 1990s. As a result, his father founded the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness. Also along with his father, Jamie co-founded The Redford Center, which uses impact-driven film and media to accelerate environmental and climate justice.\n\nJames “Jamie” Redford, a documentary filmmaker, activist and the son of actor Robert Redford, died of cancer on Oct. 16. He was 58.\n\nHis wife of 32 years, Kyle Redford, announced his death on Twitter, writing: “He lived a beautiful, impactful life and was loved by many. He will be deeply missed. As his wife of 32 years, I’m most grateful for the two spectacular children we raised together. I don’t know what we would’ve done without them over the past two years.”\n\nJamie died today. We’re heartbroken. He lived a beautiful, impactful life & was loved by many. He will be deeply missed. As his wife of 32 yrs, I’m most grateful for the two spectacular children we raised together. I don’t know what we would’ve done w/o them over the past 2yrs. pic.twitter.com/ynDN2jSZ04\n\n— kyle redford (@kyleredford) October 16, 2020\n\nIn an interview with the Salt Lake Tribune,...\n\nAt 10, Dylan Redford, grandson of Robert, could barely read or write. His story features in a revealing and touching documentary about the condition made by his father, James\n\nOn the face of it, Dylan Redford has everything going for him – he is a handsome, intelligent and artistic 22-year-old who happens to be the grandson of Robert Redford. But he is also severely dyslexic and, at the age of 10, could barely read or write.\n\nAt school in Marin County, California, he found it impossible to use the lockers. The combination of remembering a sequence of numbers and then twisting the padlock dial in the right direction proved difficult to master. \"It was just all bad,\" says Dylan. \"I had to ask my friends to do it for me.\"\n\nDylan's experiences with dyslexia are depicted in a new documentary, The Big Picture, directed by Dylan's father, James. After watching his \"intellectually curious...\n\nRobert Redford plays an ageing anti-war activist in his latest movie, The Company You Keep – just one more incarnation in an ever-changing image\n\nRobert Redford's new film sees the Hollywood liberal play a craggy radical, hiding away from a criminally subversive past under an assumed name. Once the FBI rumbles him, the agents on his trail spend some time comparing the image of his lined face to that of his much younger, 1970s, moustachioed self.\n\nCinema audiences across the world have travelled down that same long, ageing trail with Redford too, watching as his luminous youth in the role of Bubber in the 1966 film The Chase was gradually replaced, first by the poised cynicism of The Candidate and then by the stately leading man in Out of Africa or the worn-out sleaze of his Indecent Proposal to Demi Moore. Yet, as a man, Redford's radical zeal remains undimmed.\n\nThe Company You Keep,...\n\nRobert Redford has stated that he will never fully recover from the death of his infant son over 50 years ago. The 74-year-old screen legend lost 2-and-a-half-month-old Scott, his first child with ex-wife Lola Van Wagenen, to sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) back in 1959, a tragic moment that he likens to a \"scar\" that \"never heals\". He told Aarp: \"It was really hard. We were very young. I had my first theatre job, which didn't (more)...\n\nAs June is the month of the Sundance Directors Lab, the writers of The Film Stage saw this as being an appropriate moment to reflect back upon the early days of all things Sundance.The Sundance Film Festival occupies an interesting space in history, as it was the first film festival to focus specifically on American film, and it helped to escalate the American independent film movement. In 2009, the Sundance Festival celebrated its 25th anniversary, showcasing reflective trailers with images dating back to 1985. What is interesting about this is that the festival had actually started in 1978, and 1985 simply reflects the year in which the Sundance Institute took over its management. One might assume that in this take over was also a name change, and that 1985 reflects when it became known as Sundance. However, it was not actually renamed the Sundance Film Festival until after the 1990 festival, so the fact that...\n\nRobert Redford is a married man for one more time as it is reported that he has married his longtime girlfriend, Sibylle Szaggars. According to the Associated Press, the 71-year-old actor wed Sibylle in her native Germany this past weekend.\n\nRenate Massfeller of the St. Catherine Church in Hamburg confirmed Wednesday, July 15, Pastor Frank Engelbrecht officiated the wedding of Robert and Sibylle at the luxury Louis C. Jacob Hotel on Saturday, July 11. Local newspaper called Hamburger Abendblatt claimed the pair exchanged wedding vows in front of 30 friends and family members.\n\nA message sent to Robert's publicist in New York in a bid to obtain confirmation if a wedding did exist was not immediately replied. Should nuptials do take place, the wedding is a second one for Robert. He was previously married to Lola Van Wagenen. They have three surviving children; David James, Shauna, and Amy. Their oldest child, Scott, passed...\n\nForget Sundance. Robert Redford is the marrying kid. The Hollywood icon quietly tied the knot with his longtime companion, German artist Sibylle Szaggars, in Hamburg, Germany, over the weekend. Per the local daily, Hamburger Abendblatt, Redford, 71, and Szaggars, 51, swapped vows in a private affair Saturday afternoon before 30 family and friends at the ritzy Louis C. Jacob Hotel on the bank of the Elbe river. The groom reportedly wore a white suit while the bride donned a champagne-colored gown. This is the second marriage for the actor-director. He was previously hitched to Lola Van Wagenen, with whom he had four children from 1958 to 1985. (Their first child, a son, died of sudden infant death...\n\nBarbra Streisand enjoyed affairs with her movie co-stars Robert Redford, Ryan O'Neal and Kris Kristofferson at the height of her fame, according to the singer/actress' ex-boyfriend, Hollywood producer Jon Peters.\n\nPeters, who produced Superman Returns and Batman, claims in his upcoming memoir Studio Head that Streisand confided in him that she had \"life-imitates-art affairs\" with the actors.\n\nHer fling with O'Neal came after they met on the set of 1972 movie What's Up Doc?, shortly after her split from husband Elliot Gould, Peters alleges.\n\nAnd he claims she seduced Redford while he was married to Lola Van Wagenen on the set of 1973's The Way We Were. A romance with Kristofferson followed in 1976, according to the book.\n\nPeters writes: \"Barbra may have had her neuroses and insecurities, but getting men, the men every woman wanted, was not one of them.\"\n\nReps for Streisand, O'Neal and Redford had not responded to requests for comment as WENN went to press, while Kristofferson's spokesperson had no comment.\n\nPeters' memoir was bought by Harper-Collins Publishers in April for $700,000 (£462,350), reports the New York Post."
