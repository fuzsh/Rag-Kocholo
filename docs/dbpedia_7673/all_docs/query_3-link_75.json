Except for the first twenty years of my life, it's all I can remember being. I'm fortunate in the fact all my children are healthy, and pray to God every day that it stays that way. My mother and father are still alive too. I am also a lucky man to have five siblings that have families of their own. Between the six of us I'd say we have a small mountain of kid's...and the mountain rumbles with growth each year.\n\nI'm hoping this site is just one small nudge to bring us all closer together. I'd like to know my neices and nephews better. I'd like my kids to know their cousins and get close enough to each other to want to get together.\n\nThings seem to move so much faster as I grow older and I seem to be losing track of who's getting married and having babies...\n\n...any how, write me an email if you see this. Or write to someone you see on this site. I'm in the process of trying to compile an email list of everyone in the family that has one. If you have an email address and you know I don't have it, will you please email me?\n\nMay God bless every one of us!"
