The talented and dedicated Wallace played in four games last year and recorded one tackle. The redshirt junior cornerback missed most of spring practice with a slight injury, but is expected to be at full strength when training camp begins in August. Wallace is an accomplished musician and the past two years has helped the freshmen football players prepare for their dance routine for the student-athlete pep rally at the Penn State Dance Marathon. Wallace is an active participant in some of the squad[apos]s community service initiatives. The former Good Counsel High School all-met selection is one of 10 returning Nittany Lions from Maryland.\n\n2011 Junior Season\n\nWallace saw action in four games and made one tackle against Eastern Michigan. He recorded a pass breakup and was on the field for a season-high 11 snaps against Indiana State.\n\n2010 Sophomore Season\n\nIn his first season on the field, Wallace saw action against Kent State, Illinois, Indiana and Florida for the veteran and deep Penn State secondary.\n\n2009 Freshman Season\n\nRedshirt season.\n\nHigh School\n\nA three-year starter and letterman at Good Counsel HS, Wallace was named All-Gazette and honorable All-Met under Coach Bob Milloy.
