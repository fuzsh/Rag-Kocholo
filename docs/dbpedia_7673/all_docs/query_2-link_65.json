        "text": "Thomas “Tom” Roy Lombardo was born on March 14, 1943, and passed away on April 13, 2024, surrounded by his wife, Michele Lombardo and his children, Rachel Wallace, Steven Lombardo, and Jamie Lombardo. In addition to his wife and children, Tom is survived by his son-in-law, Gregg Wallace; daughter-in-law, Melissa Lombardo; grandchildren Ben, James, Caleb, Addie, and Ellie, who were all the joy of his life and who loved their “Paw Paw” dearly; brother, Roy Lombardo, Jr. and his wife, Dreda; and his sister, Anna Margaret Broz and her husband, Steve; as well as many nieces and nephews. Tom’s loving parents, Roy and Louise Lombardo, passed on before him.\n\nAfter graduating from Beaumont High and Lamar University, Tom met and married the love of his life and best friend, Michele. He then volunteered for the US Army Reserve where he served for 11 years before retiring as a Captain. Tom had a long career in sales before he returned to Lamar University earning his nursing degree. He worked as a nurse for 11 years at St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont on the Telemetry Floor before retiring. After retirement, Tom became a volunteer Chaplain at the Stiles Unit State Prison where he shared his faith with inmates and was honored to guide many on their path to find the same Christian faith he loved and lived.\n\nHe also partnered with his wife, Michele, in creating Primitive Passions, an arts and crafts small business where he utilized his woodworking skills to make one of kind primitive furniture. If you knew Tom and his passion for antique wood, you wouldn’t be surprised to find he and Michele driving around picking wood and junk that they would then turn into treasurers.\n\nHe was also an avid fisherman, teaching all his children and grandchildren to love to fish in the Gulf. Not only did he love fishing, but he also loved to cook his catch! Tom was passionate about food and cooking and could always be counted on to start talking about the next meal while eating the current meal! He inspired his grandsons to love cooking and many times shared his recipes over the phone with them.\n\nHis love of Christ led him to witness wherever he went – the grocery store, restaurants, the car wash – anywhere he went, he spread the good news of Jesus. More than his career or accomplishments, Tom was a joyful, kind, compassionate and humble man who loved his family and friends who loved and adored him in return and will miss him dearly.\n\nThe family has asked that in lieu of flowers, a donation in Tom’s name can be made to the Prison Ministry at River Point Church, 21000 Southwest Freeway Richmond, Texas 77469 (donate online) or Towers to Tunnels, 2361 Hylan Boulevard, Staten Island, New York (donate online), which were both charities Tom cared deeply about and supported.\n\nThe family would like to recognize Tom’s incredible care teams at both Enhabit Home Health and Trinity Hospice. Those care team members include Seykoya, Vincent, Phyllis, Maria, Deb, Sammy, Cindy, Huong, Desiree and Lori."
