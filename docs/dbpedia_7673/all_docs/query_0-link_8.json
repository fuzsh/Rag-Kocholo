        "text": "Mike Wallace died on April 7, 2012, just five months after his former 60 Minutes (1968) co-anchor Andy Rooney.\n\nLongtime friend of Nancy Reagan, having known her well before she married Ronald Reagan. Their friendship was strained when Wallace conducted critical interviews of Reagan after he became President, but the two reconciled after Reagan's death.\n\nBefore he was a successful news correspondent, he served as the announcer for ABC and Mutual Radio's \"Sky King\" (1946-1954).\n\nMet a young, unfamiliar singer, Barbra Streisand, on the set of PM East (1961). Exactly thirty years later, he would later interview her on 60 Minutes (1968).\n\n[on surprise expressed when he retired in 2006] Let's face it. I'm not 85 anymore."
