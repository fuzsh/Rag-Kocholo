        "text": "Aired on CBS since 1968, 60 Minutes is the most watched and profitable program in television history, known for its distinctive style of reporter-centered inquiry. The show is easily recognizable by its stopwatch logo, which Santore includes in his TV Guide cover. Ironically, this 1977 cover aligns with the current 60 Minutes logo, which debuted in 2006. The updated design features an upright stopwatch rather than a slanted one, white type, and a red background.\n\nMike Wallace (1918–2012) was one of the original reporters for 60 Minutes and spent thirty-seven years with the program; his last interview was in 2008. Morley Safer (1931–2016) joined 60 Minutes in its second year and was its longest-serving correspondent. He helped establish the show’s high professional standards. Dan Rather (born 1931) also contributed to 60 Minutes from 1975 to 1981 and again in 2005–6, but eventually left the CBS network after getting tangled in a controversial news report."
