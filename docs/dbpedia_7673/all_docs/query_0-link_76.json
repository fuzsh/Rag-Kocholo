Without him and his iconic style, there probably wouldn’t be a 60 Minutes’\n\n— President and CEO of CBS Leslie Moonves\n\n“His extraordinary contribution as a broadcaster is immeasurable and he has been a force within the television industry throughout its existence. His loss will be felt by all of us at CBS,” Leslie Moonves, president and CEO of CBS Corporation, said in the statement.\n\nWallace left his full-time role at 60 Minutes in 2006 after 38 years and was given the title correspondent emeritus and a part-time contributor role. His last interview was with Roger Clemens, the star baseball pitcher accused of steroid use, in 2008.\n\nA special 60 Minutes program dedicated to Wallace will be aired April 15.\n\nJust about anyone who made news during the past six decades – in the United States, but often abroad too – had to submit to a grilling by Wallace.\n\nIn almost 40 years on 60 Minutes, the ground-breaking investigative journalism program, he worked on some 800 reports, won 20 Emmys and developed a relentless on-air style that was often more interrogation than interview.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWallace also drew criticism for his go-for-the-throat style and the theatrics that sometimes accompanied it. He also became caught up in a $120 million libel suit that resulted in no judgment against him or CBS but triggered a case of depression that led him to attempt suicide.\n\n‘FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING…’\n\nWallace interviewed every U.S. president since John F. Kennedy — with the exception of George W. Bush — and dozens of other world leaders like Yasser Arafat, Ayatollah Khomeini and Deng Xiaoping.\n\nOther interview subjects included everyone from Malcolm X to Janis Joplin, Martin Luther King Jr., Johnny Carson, Vladimir Horowitz and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner.\n\nWhen Wallace prefaced a question with “Forgive me for asking …” or responded to a dubious answer with “Oh, come on,” 60 Minutes viewers knew he was about to get tough. His sometimes-abrasive manner resulted in the nickname “Mike Malice,” and some viewers will always remember him as the man who made diva Barbra Streisand cry on camera.\n\nIn a 2006 retrospective of his 60 Minutes career, Wallace summed up his interviewing technique as: “Let’s ask the questions that might be on the minds of the people looking in … ‘If I were there in that chair where Wallace is, here’s what I would want to know.”’\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nHe was more succinct in a 2005 interview with The Boston Globe when he said: “I determined when I started back in 1956 … there’s no such thing as an indiscreet question.”\n\nMyron Leon Wallace was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 9, 1918. He began calling himself Mike because he thought it was more manly than Myron. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1939, he worked as a radio newswriter in Chicago and also on radio quiz shows, talk shows, a soap opera and serials like “The Green Hornet.” He also acted on television and Broadway before joining CBS’s radio department.\n\nIn 1955 Wallace found his calling with a television show called Nightbeat, which featured Wallace asking pointed questions of writers, gangsters, artists and movie stars in front of a stark black backdrop.\n\n‘NASTY QUESTIONS, ABRASIVE QUESTIONS’\n\n“We were doing the kind of show that had never been done before,” Wallace said. “Nasty questions, abrasive questions, confrontational questions.”\n\nHe returned to CBS in the early 1960s and was onboard 60 Minutes for its Sept. 24, 1968, debut. The show broke new ground in broadcast journalism with its surprise interviews, undercover reporters, hidden cameras and one-way mirrors.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOne report for CBS sent Wallace into a personal tailspin. He worked on a 1982 CBS documentary that claimed the U.S. military conspired to misstate the strength of the enemy during the Vietnam War, which led to a $120 million libel suit from Gen. William Westmoreland.\n\nThe suit was dropped during the trial, CBS apologized and no money changed hands, but Wallace was traumatized by the accusations, which contributed to his depression.\n\nWallace’s depression grew so severe he tried to kill himself with a drug overdose in 1984. He was saved by his wife, Mary.\n\nWallace often spoke about his recovery from depression and said the years after his suicide attempt were some of the most productive of his life.\n\nWallace, who was married four times, had a daughter, Pauline, and son, Chris, also a television journalist. Another son, Peter, died in a mountain-climbing accident in 1962.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2012\n\nHighlights of the life and career of CBS newsman Mike Wallace: He was born Myron Wallace but changed his first name to Mike because he thought Myron sounded wimpy. He went to the same Brookline, Massachusetts, elementary school as John F. Kennedy. Wallace was on the premier of 60 Minutes in 1968 and stepped down as a full-time correspondent after 38 years in 2006. His final interview for the show was with Roger Clemens, the baseball pitcher linked to steroid use. Wallace told The Boston Globe the interview subject he most admired was Martin Luther King Jr. because King came out against the Vietnam War at the risk of alienating President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had worked with him on civil rights. General William Westmoreland sued CBS in 1984 because of a Wallace report that said the U.S. military had manipulated intelligence reports during the Vietnam War to show far fewer communist troops in South Vietname. The case contributed to Wallace’s depression. He tried to kill himself with a drug overdose in 1984. Wallace took the 60 Minutes job after turning down an offer to join Richard Nixon’s presidential campaign, which he had been covering for CBS. Singer-actress Barbra Streisand cried during a 60 Minutes interview as Wallace prodded her about her touchy relationship with her mother. Wallace wrote that the question was fair since she was portraying a therapist in her 1991 movie The Prince of Tides, but years later apologized to Streisand on the air. In 2004, Wallace was handcuffed and taken into custody on a charge of disorderly conduct for interfering with New York City law enforcement officers who were questioning his double-parked limo driver.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
