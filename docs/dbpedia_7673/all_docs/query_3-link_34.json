        "text": "​Early Life and Education\n\nWallace was born in Queens, New York, in 1942 and, after a stint (1943-1949) in San Francisco, where his father and his band leader uncle ran a record shop, the family returned to New York. Wallace grew up in Fresh Meadows, Valley Stream, and Great Neck. His father became a real estate salesman, then a real estate broker, moving his office eastward with the postwar suburban migration.\n\nWallace went to Columbia College in 1960. Like many others he came under the spell of master teacher James P. Shenton, and decided to become an historian. On graduating in 1964 he stayed on at Columbia for graduate studies. With historian Richard Hofstadter as his adviser, he worked on a dissertation about the emergence of the two party system, worked as Hofstadter’s research assistant, and in 1968 had his first article accepted by the American Historical Review.[1]\n\nIn 1968 Wallace took part in the student strike at Columbia University.[2] In 1969, Hofstadter, though opposed to the strike, proposed that they jointly produce a documentary history of violence in the U.S.[3] Wallace did the research; Hofstadter wrote the introduction; and Wallace published an essay with a different emphasis.[4] Arthur Schlesinger Jr. hailed the book in his New York Times review.[5] Wallace’s article was critiqued in a Wall Street Journal editorial.[6]\n\nIn 1970, the newly appointed president of Franconia College, 23-year-old Leon Botstein (currently president of Bard College) asked Hofstadter to recommend an historian. Wallace was hired, becoming the one-person history department.[7] Hofstadter died on October 24, 1970, at age 54, of leukemia; Wallace taught his Franconia students a memorial seminar called “Hofstadter’s History.”\n\nIn 1971, Wallace relocated to New York City, taking up a teaching position at John Jay College of Criminal Justice (City University of New York). He offered his students, all police officers, a course on the history of American violence.\n\nIn 1976, when John Jay and other CUNY colleges were threatened with closure during New York’s so-called fiscal crisis, students (including police students) and faculty demonstrated in the streets.[8] Wallace and other CUNY faculty colleagues had produced (in 1974) a pamphlet, Crisis at CUNY that set the contemporary struggle in historical context.[9]\n\nRadical History\n\nIn the early 1970s Wallace began working with other historians of his generation who were crafting alternative approaches to history, in tandem with activists in social movements who were challenging the established order by promoting civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights, and opposing economic inequality and the Vietnam War. The “young radical historians who burst onto the scene,” wrote one scholar, “presented a view of the past which emphasized class, and social and economic conflict,” and they “succeeded in broadening the scope of American history by adding the voices of those previously excluded, such as women, blacks and the working class.”[10]\n\nIn 1973 Wallace helped launch, and for the next ten years directed, the Radical History Forum. Presenters included such scholars and activists as Mari-Jo Buhle, Herbert Gutman, Jonathan Katz, Eugene Genovese, Paul Buhle, Harry Braverman, Dorothy Thompson, Peter Biskind, Frank Bonilla, E. P. Thompson, Eric Foner, Immanuel Wallerstein, Eleanor Leacock, Donna Haraway, Martin Duberman, Blanche Cook, Perry Anderson, William Appleman Williams, Harry Magdoff, Edward Said, Theda Skocpol, Sheila Rowbotham, Herbert Schiller, and Erik Barnouw.[11]\n\nWallace also participated in transforming the Radical Historians’ Newsletter, started in 1973, into the Radical History Review, by 1975. From then through the mid-1980s, he served as its editorial coordinator. Both the forums and the journal were housed in his office at John Jay College.[12] The RHR continues to this day, and is now headquartered at NYU, and published by Duke University Press.[13]\n\nPublic History\n\nDuring the 1980s, Wallace began writing about the ways history gets presented to the general public, outside of schools and universities. His first analysis of public history presentations came with a 1981 article on the history of history museums.[14] Essays followed on historic preservation, Ellis Island, Disney World, New York City history museums, historical rhetoric used by politicians (notably Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich)[15], science and industrial museums, TV shows and movies, and the fracas over the Enola Gay exhibition at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.[16] In 1996, these and other pieces were collected in a book called Mickey Mouse History and Other Essays on American Memory.[17] Michael Kammen, then president of the Organization of American Historians, wrote: “This book explains, better than any other, why history has been at the very heart of the culture wars in recent times.”[18] Wallace lectured widely in the 1980s and 1990s on the subject of public history.[19]\n\nWallace also fashioned autonomous projects, like Radical History Radio, which in 1982 produced shows for WBAI; and the New York Public History Project, which in 1984 produced walking tours, pamphlets, and slide/tape shows on subjects ranging from the history of Wall Street to the history of housing (funded by the New York Council for the Humanities and the J. M. Kaplan Fund). He collaborated on a series of walking tours with his then wife Hope Cooke.[22]\n\nNew York History\n\nIn 1976 Wallace applied for a grant from the Rabinowitz Foundation to write a history of the United States as a capitalist society. His proposal argued that insurgent historians were collectively rewriting the history of the United States, but the new history was not accessible to the general public, because it lacked a narrative overview that brought all the pieces together into a compelling whole. With support from E.P. Thompson, Herbert Gutman, Eugene Genovese, and others, the grant was granted.\n\nWallace now partnered with Edwin Burrows, with whom he had co-authored a 139 page article on the American Revolution.[23] They set to work, aided by a 1980 NEH grant for the project, then entitled “The Emergence of American Capitalism.”[24] In 1983 Wallace presented at Beijing University an overview of the work in progress.[25] But progress was slow. The outpouring of new studies was overwhelming. So Wallace and Burrows decided to downshift the enterprise and write the history of New York City, setting it in the global and national context they’d constructed. They tried out the new format at the 1985 American Historical Association[26] and, their approach having passed muster with commentators including David Gordon and Sean Wilentz,they began looking for a publisher. In 1986 they signed on with literary agent Frances Goldin. In 1987 the project was taken on by Jim Silberman, president of Summit Books, a Simon & Schuster imprint, as a one volume work. Over the next decade, it became clear the project would be a far bigger multi-volume project, and in 1996, the authors moved to Oxford University Press. In November 1998, Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898 was published. In April 1999 it won the Pulitzer Prize.[27]"
