        "text": "Mike Wallace was an American journalist, radio announcer, game show host, actor, and media personality. Known as one of the best broadcast journalists in America, he interviewed several celebrities in his illustrious decades-long career. He started as an announcer and news correspondent on radio, and subsequently transitioned to television doing talk shows, quiz shows, series, and news. He also served in the army during the World War II. Wallace rose to fame for hosting the 'CBS' talk show '60 Minutes.' In the latter half of his career, he was embroiled in several controversies for inappropriate conduct during his interviews. Due to his deteriorating mental health, he quit his work in 2006, but continued to make TV appearances until 2008."
