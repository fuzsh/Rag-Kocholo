When reviewing reels we look at the acting first.\n\nJohn Lasseter* A mosquito flies into the picture. It looks like an insect and at the same time like a human although it wears only a human hat and carries a bag, with big eyes that are neither human nor beastly but are part of the world of caricature. Interestingly enough, the character on screen, like many great cartoon stars, was based on a comic strip where it looked less human, had no hat, no bag: completely insect-like. “Its” or “his” cinematically changed personality is created by the way of acting, lifting the hat with one leg to introduce itself to the spectators, looking around gleefully for a victim that appears in the person of a well-clad, fat, tired, not really likeable gentleman. In anticipation of our spitefulness, we know that what’s going to happen serves this man right. The insect follows him to his apartment and gets inside an open door window to the man’s bedroom. While the unknowing man sleeps, the mosquito goes to work, sharpens its needle. The man snores. The mosquito sucks blood. Half-sleeping the man tries to catch it but the mosquito is persistent and escapes the man’s hand. Finally, the mosquito *\n\nJohn Lasseter, Pixar Lecture at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles on November 4, 1996.\n\nxiii\n\nis sucked full of blood, its body a balloon. But it hasn’t had its fill of body fluid. It’s still greedy, sucking more right under the man’s nose, scratching its head. The balloon circles above the man’s head, landing again, doing a handstand on the man’s nose, boisterously performing its antics for the audience expecting applause, sucking again and—exploding: boom!, having overdone its job. The whole animation industry as we know it today is based on that little picture because it’s the first time that not the novelty of movement and metamorphosis counts but the unique character itself. Not done by a computer but by ink and paint: consisting of more than 8000 drawings. Five minutes of first-class animation, more than a 100 years old and surpassing most of nowadays’ standardized animation. While the few animators in other countries, like Émile Cohl in France, were satisfied to have their simple Fantoche characters just moving around, pleased just by movement, Winsor McCay, the creator of Little Nemo (New York Herald, October 15, 1905) who did the mosquito in 1912, aimed for good caricatures, drawn in perspective, and above all personality. How a Mosquito Operates, a little silent film, nothing else than pencil and ink, never misses its effect on the audience up till today. The art of acting through animated characters lies in detail, in gesture, in little unexpected things that make a character memorable even after 100 years, maybe not so much the acting itself but rather personality. And these tiny gestures and unexpected movements reflect the personality of the animator as well. Let us quote the late Darlyne O’Brien, widow of the animator who brought King Kong to eternal screen life: Willis O’Brien. She told that she would recognize her husband in every gesture of the famous giant gorilla. Having been close to O’Brien’s protégé, stop-motion artist Ray Harryhausen, we only can confirm this sentiment. Having known Harryhausen for 35 years, we watched him mimic in a church in Bologna, Italy, and pounding against the huge gate like mighty Kong against the entrance of the native village of Skull Island. It was imitative behavior inspired by an unforgettable childhood experience. Sometimes, in very private moments, this great animator showed an infecting sense of humor and copied people. He was a fan of comedian Stan Laurel and revealed that at one time he and his lifelong friend and buddy Ray Bradbury planned a pilgrimage to Laurel’s home in Santa Monica. Germany lost a fantastic Hungarian actor in 1933 when the Nazis came to power. His name was Peter Lorre (1904–1964). He was the child murderer in Fritz Lang’s M and toward the end of his life acted in Edgar Allan Poe films directed by Roger Corman. Colleagues described him as a brilliant scene stealer. When he would walk over a bridge in the comedy version of The Raven (1963), accompanied by two other old timers, Boris Karloff and Vincent Price, all eyes would be on him, not on the fellows. Lorre was born with a face. It was director Howard Hawks who once said those actors make the best stars who are easily to be caricatured. Just see the caricatured star portraits (even in animation) of Clark Gable, complete with oversized ears, Katharine Hepburn or Peter Lorre who, alongside Bugs and Daffy, xiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nbecame a mad scientist character in Warner Bros. cartoons Hair-Raising Hare and Birth of a Notion. Character animation is about personality, no matter if it’s human, animal or, well, unearthly demon. Monsters, the bigger they are, remain uniquely memorable just for their proportion: Kong, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, the Ymir from 20 Million Miles to Earth, the intimidating, eye-rolling, nightmarish bugbear of a Cyclops in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Suffer the Little Children as Stephen King would put it: an extraordinary hybrid creature, goat-legged, lips of a camel, jagged teeth of a boar, nails of a lion, the horn of a unicorn. Doing research on a Walt Disney favorite, Fantasia, John Culhane interviewed master animator Vladimir “Bill” Tytla, called by his associate Lester Novros the animator, and asked him how he approached the animation of Chernabog, the powerful monstrous Devil on Bald Mountain. According to Culhane, Tytla would build himself up, like an actor getting back into an old role: “I imagined that I was as big as a mountain and made of rock and yet I was feeling and moving.”* Although he doesn’t do any evil in his scenes, the horned, giant Chernabog acts like evil supreme. He unfolds his enormous wings, stretches, summons fire, demons, and harpies. His eyes reflect satanic pleasure, but like Lugosi’s vampire the light of the rising sun forces him to retreat. In Culhane’s view, Bill Tytla shared with Disney an overwhelming empathy with all creation that was almost Franciscan. He once said that they approached things with a great deal of emotion. You have to feel yourself to make others feel the same. As an animator, you have to be an emotional character. Tytla was emotional and made us feel with the seven dwarfs, with Stromboli, Pinocchio’s puppet master, Dumbo the flying elephant, or Chernabog’s predecessor, the giant who rolled a cigarette from a haystack, used the roof of a house as a seat and was conquered by Mickey Mouse, the Brave Little Tailor. The greatest of animators, like Tytla, commanded two skills still highly important, particularly in the digital age: the skill of imagination and the skill to visualize this imagination. Actors act, according to their imagination, visual artists of course visualize it. Although being no professional actor, Tytla became the character, he felt and grasped the character and enthusiastically filled in, like diminutive Haruo Nakajima became a giant creature inside a Godzilla rubber suit at Toho Studios in Tokyo. Tytla maybe belonged to the first who truly understood the importance of acting in animation, sort of an heir to Winsor McCay’s legacy because it was one of McCay’s films, Gertie the Dinosaur, that inspired and started him on the road. Like McCay, Tytla did his job instinctively by balancing motion and emotion. *\n\nJohn Culhane, Walt Disney’s Fantasia. New York: Abradale Press/Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers, 1999, p. 194.\n\nIntroduction\n\nxv\n\nAnother of Disney’s master animators was even more aware of that art. His name: Milt (Milton Erwin) Kahl—and to many he was the best right after Tytla. To Kahl, who animated Pinocchio and Bambi, animation was a very difficult medium that requires pretty good craftsmen who are able to draw well enough to turn things at every angle. One has to understand movement and, Kahl adds, one has to be an actor, put on a performance, and be a showman. Animation has to do with acting, at least to some degree. But there is no true acting involved, of course not, as animators do not enter the stage themselves, but rather animate the character that acts, and if they are lucky they are able to avoid the standardized, mechanical mass production that Richard Williams once called just animating matches (but even cheap animation needs a certain amount of characterization). In the best case, actors as well as animators explore and develop characters thoroughly and become one with them. So both, acting as well as animation, is a highly creative process. This is what they have in common. And they have, as we will see, the same origins. But contrary to film stars who shine on the silver screen (and art that is exhibited in galleries and museums worldwide and sometimes sells to astronomical prices), animators in most cases remain in the dark. Their names are only known to insiders, and in the early years many spectators would naively speculate if Walt Disney was the artist who drew all his animated films himself. The same is true for actors used in motion or performance capture. Andy Serkis, an exceptional actor, may be the only one whose name is known to bigger audiences thanks to his performances as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or as Supreme Leader Snoke in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Vice versa, live actors who share the screen with animated characters have problems, too, to win the “competition.” In many cases, they won’t. A live actor simply cannot win against animals, kids, or cartoons. They just might catch up as the late Bob Hoskins did in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This book is divided into two parts: From film history we learn about the importance of actors and the range of personalities and related arts that goes into animation. Then we will turn to the animator’s, the writer’s, and actor’s point of view to describe the various techniques involved. There might be doubts about mixing history and technical guidance. Some might call the project too academic (don’t worry, it’s not), more appealing to film historians than animators themselves. Who is this book being written for? Is it for historians, film buffs, and fans? Is it for character animators? Is it for screenwriters? Is it for actresses and actors who might look to animation as an additional source of income? It seems to fall between all these stools. It is no history book in the proper meaning of the word. It is no manual. It is more like a brainstorm of facts and ideas that demonstrate the variety of animation. The reason for this kind of confusion has mainly to do with our relation to the science of history. Our fast-paced society considers it superfluous to look back to understand what we are doing today. To many viewers, everything that xvi\n\nIntroduction\n\nprecedes Avatar doesn’t simply exist. It is predigital, isn’t it? Black-and-white film and silent, in the worst case. They forget that animation techniques themselves do depend on neither film nor digital media. So past, present, and future have the same purpose in recording movement. We wouldn’t be able to judge and classify what we are doing without the knowledge of the history of moving images. If we don’t know where they come from, we don’t know where they go to. This prejudice against history transferred to the stage would mean that Shakespeare has no significance in theatre today. Animated images surround us since a Stone Age artist drew a wild boar with eight legs on a wall in the Cave of Altamira in nowadays Cantabria, Spain. Why did he do so? Because the very idea of animation is in our head, therefore, not necessarily tied to the silver or the computer screen: mentally saving, reconstructing, and re-enacting movement is the objective target. And by re-enacting telling a story. While we talked about the effect the shine of fire would have on these, thanks to stone protrusion, almost 3D cave paintings, Tommy Lee Jones, on a visit to Berlin’s Museum of Film and Television to promote Men in Black, all of a sudden gave a private performance and demonstrated to us how a Stone Age storyteller’s shadow would act while speaking and spinning yarns in the shine of fire. One can say that this was the first motion-picture theater. Since then the field is not exclusively reserved to professional cartoonists and animators (of course not), but in the digital age, in the realm of synthetic media where even acting is artificial, they come closest to the domain of actor-storytellers: from Stone Age right into the future of virtuality. Animators must bring drawn, sculpted, or digitally created figures to life. Actors must develop characters as well, but they draw on their physical body shape and their gender (although not in every culture: when male actors impersonate females). Animators can portray anything from plant life (Walt Disney’s Technicolor Silly Symphony Flowers and Trees) to animals, from humans to robots and non-humanoid aliens. For humans it’s rather difficult to portray goat-legged satyrs or multi-armed, sword-wielding horrors. When Hollywood planned to film Edgar Rice Burroughs’ John Carter of Mars stories in the 1960s, stop-motion artist Jim Danforth naturally pleaded for animation to portray the four-armed green giant barbarians who are part of Burroughs’ universe, but the VFX supervisor-to-be, Larry Butler, wouldn’t sympathize with that idea and would have handled the effect by tying two large basketball players for each giant and having a special headpiece made. The multi-armed silver maid from the 1940-Thief of Bagdad was choreographed in a similar way by the same Butler. (Ray Harryhausen would eventually animate the six-armed Kali in a swordfight sequence from The Golden Voyage of Sinbad.) Decades later, when John Carter of Mars was eventually produced by Disney, the computer would take over. Animation had become a major ingredient of most American blockbusters with a strong report to VFX. Genuine live-action scenes that hadn’t been pixel touched became scarce. Before the digital age, however, VFX and design people Introduction\n\nxvii\n\nantagonized animation, particularly stop motion, for being jerky. MGM’s chief production designer Cedric Gibbons despised the studio’s decision to have Willis O’Brien come down to Culver City to try a stop-motion adventure titled War Eagles, an epic that consequently never was. Of course, there was misunderstanding on both parts. Gibbons’ associate A. Arnold Gillespie, for many years in charge of models, ships, planes, and special effects at Metro studios, described the movement of the hanging miniature dolls that filled the stadium to watch the 1925 Ben Hur chariot race and were arranged like the tiny players of table soccer as—animation. There was not much love lost between live action and animated films. The heads of international film festivals would prefer to walk alongside live stars over the red carpet rather than present themselves with cartoon characters in silly costumes. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences rarely would acknowledge animated effects in live-action films up to the 1960s and only would award Mighty Joe Young in 1950. Ray Harryhausen, assistant to Willis O’Brien who received the Oscar, was present during the ceremony and felt the tension of the nominated O’Brien. But Ray himself had to wait a long time for his well-deserved Oscar. That signals that animation is different from all other cinematic experiences. Jim Danforth recalls that, in those days, even members of the VFX Academy Award committee didn’t understand the intricate Harryhausen process. The process of animation begins in preproduction with developing the character, a joint effort of specialized writers and skilled artists supervised not exactly by the director but by the producer who in most cases is the project’s driving force, in Europe (as we sadly had to learn) with a lot of unwelcome interference from TV editors and distributors, and with devising the model sheets that show posing and facial expression of the respective character. The livelier a single pose is the better. On stage there are art directors, set designers, costume makers, and make-up men who support actors in their performances. The actor himself will contribute what we call emotional expression, using his mimic art, voice, and body movement. But in animation everything depends on the animator provided he is going to work with a solid design of the character that means something to him, that inspires him. In TV mass production, the design is even more important as there is no ambitious detailed animation possible for budgetary reasons and time constraints. Actors have learned to express emotion by facial expression, gestures, breathing, and voice. The tools actors and animators use are basically the same: body talk, mood, and movement—with the exception that to them this kind of performing is an out-of-body experience. Animators and actors have at least one thing in common. Animators, like actors, are avid watchers. They carefully observe and study animals as well as humans. For Bambi, the popular cartoon version of Felix Salten’s 1923-book, Disney got real deer, two fawns, christened Bambi and Faline, to his old Hyperion Studios as reference for the animators where they could be studied. The same approach these writers noticed at the animation department of Beijing Film xviii\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcademy where they animated a feature about a dog and had a tiny puppy caged in the studio. Certainly both, animators as well as actors, have to watch. In fact, Augusto Fernandes, Argentine stage director, sent his actors to the zoo to study animal behavior. Animals and nature play an important part in the life of many animators in every country of the world, in every culture. Before animating Mighty Joe Young, Harryhausen did just that: going to the zoo and studying live gorillas. “I even became a vegetarian for some time,” Harryhausen would say. But contrary to the actor on stage, an animator is not only copying nature. He can change it. He is almost free from it and the limits of physics. In the world of animated characters, Béla Balázs wrote, nothing is impossible as miracles are part of the daily routine. The drawn lines function in accordance with the shape they assume. Saying that he referred to the antics of Felix the Cat, the screen’s first cartoon star that, by the way, was modeled after Charles Chaplin’s little tramp with certain characteristics that later were borrowed from and paid for by Buster Keaton. To a creature made of lines, Balázs observed, everything should be achievable. Felix the Cat, for instance, can roll his tail into a wheel and ride off on it as if it were a bicycle. In another case, Felix loses his tail. He wonders what to do and while he ponders, a question mark grows out of his head. Felix seizes it and sticks it on his rump. There you go. These images are absolute. There is no difference between appearance and reality.* With an uncertain nod to the future, Balázs wonders himself, what would be gained if this was to become reality? Above all technique, however, we must play. Play like children. That is being curious and imaginative and having fun doing so. As children we have looked up to the sky and imagined the clouds to be animals, giants, pirates, adventurers, cowboys, and Indians riding horses. The source of all inspiration is childlike imagination, and Pixar even devoted one of its shorts to simply that, Partly Cloudy, creating an anthropomorphic cloud character from pixel animation. It was Max Reinhardt, Germany’s great pioneer of the stage, who once said, “I believe in the immortality of the theatre, it is a most joyous place to hide, for all those who have secretly put their childhood in their pockets and run off and away with it, to play on to the end of their days.” The same should be true for animators. Children and animators are not necessarily acting. To them it’s all like truly playing. Playing is also dreaming: great dreams, wishful dreams, and occasionally, as part of the game, nightmares. Playing staggers the imagination. Hayao Miyazaki, the great Japanimator, echoes Reinhardt’s sentiments when he says that children aren’t interested in logic; to them, all is pure imagination.† It’s a dream that is best expressed in Peter Pan, James Matthew Barrie’s story of a mischievous boy who never grows up, who never will become an adult.

In Greek mythology, the god Pan, who idles in the countryside of Arkadia playing panpipes and chasing Nymphs, represents natural life that Barrie contrasts with the effects of civilization. Therefore, this book is more about Playing than about Acting in Animation. At least it should be. It’s about imagination and about the Pan-like figures that come out of those dreams and begin to live. It was Ray Bradbury, author and fantasist, who once remarked that Charles Laughton, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, Nero, Dr. Moreau, Captain Bligh and the Canterville Ghost in one and the same person, was the biggest child of them all.\n\nxx\n\nIntroduction\n\nPart I\n\nThe Story of Actors & Acting in Animation\n\n1 Time for Creation Homunculi\n\nActing and animating are arts of simulation and reproduction: the dream of creating animal and human life by means other than natural reproduction. The so-called Homunculus was the realm of Doctor Faustus, the legendary necromancer and astrologer who became a durable character in the literature where he sold his soul to the devil, a predecessor of Frankenstein, and it was the realm of the Swiss alchemist Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim, otherwise known as Paracelsus, a sixteenth century master of holistic medicine and natural healing, who is said to have been interested in artificially made human beings, a concern that in those days came close to black magic. In Universal’s The Bride of Frankenstein (1935), VFX experts John P. Fulton and David Stanley Horsley created such homunculi optically by miniaturizing live actors while an artist like Ray Harryhausen even animated a (winged) homunculus stop-frame, as an evil magician’s aid in his “super-spectacle” The Golden Voyage of Sinbad. Today’s alchemists who call themselves scientists create artificial life through genetic engineering and human cloning. Animators, however, accomplish the process in a much simpler way. They create their little men (this is what homunculi means translated from Latin) by using digital imagery or simply a pen. 3\n\nFacing auspicious occasions, animators will have a chance of not only acting but also creating. In some early animation, as in the Out of the Inkwell series by Max Fleischer, the hand of the animator appears and it looks as if the drawn character was touched by the hand of God. Animators invent characters that virtually do not exist. In such cases, some of them actually might feel like being God and say so. “Now I know what it feels like to be God!” Colin Clive screamed when portraying Frankenstein in front of James Whale’s camera. This attitude was parodied in Chuck Jones’ short cartoon Duck Amuck (1953) in which Daffy Duck fights the malicious hand of a mischievous animator who turns out to be Bugs Bunny. But sometimes the creations might be more powerful than the creator itself. They seem to develop a life of their own like Pinocchio did. In 1965, famed Czech stop-motion producer Jiří Trnka (1912–1969) wrote and directed an 18-minute short film, a parable titled Ruka (The Hand) that dealt with personality cult: A harlequin potter is happy to create his daily output of flower vases, but then a huge Stalinist hand appears that threatens and manipulates him to sculpt nothing else than memorials of a giant hand.\n\n4\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\n2 Chalk-Talking on a Vaudeville Stage\n\nAt the turn of the century, in vaudeville, caricaturists and show-and-swift cartoonists had to have acting ability as they presented their creations live on stage. They were in direct touch with the audience. They were true animateurs. The master certainly was Winsor McCay (c. 1867–1934), “America’s greatest cartoonist,” the famed creator of the strip Little Nemo in Slumberland and an accomplished entertainer. When he entered the art of animation, it was intended to become part of his live act on stage presenting his animation and interacting with it by giving a Brontosaurus lady named Gertie on screen commands that she would follow or not. This was one of the rare cases that a cartoonist and animator became a true stage actor. McCay had drawn his Gertie the Dinosaur in 1913, accordingly over a period of six months, starting with the key frames and filling in the “in-betweens.” He had brought the series of drawings to the Vitagraph Company of America in January 1914 to have them photographed frame by frame. The next month the film was premiered at the Palace Theatre in Chicago where McCay entered the stage, armed with chalk, and began sketching on a blackboard. Personal appearances of cartoonists on stage were part of many vaudeville acts. This was followed 5\n\nby a screening of How a Mosquito Operates, Gertie’s predecessor. Then McCay returned to the stage, cracking a bullwhip like an animal trainer to introduce Gertie, “the only dinosaur in captivity.” Gertie on screen would do, at least sometimes, what McCay ordered her on “tricks” to do on stage. “Gertie—yes, her name is Gertie,” McCay addressed his audience, “will come out of that cave and do everything I tell her to do.” Then, armed with his whip, he would turn to Gertie: “Come out, Gertie, and make a pretty bow. Be a good girl and bow to the audience. Thanks! Now raise your right foot. That’s good! Now raise your left foot.” A sea serpent rears its ugly head out of the water. “Never mind that sea serpent! Gertie, raise your left foot.” But Gertie is distracted. “You’re a bad girl, shame on you!” When scolded Gertie begins to weep bitterly. “Oh, don’t cry. Here, catch this pumpkin.” For the first time in imagery live action becomes an interactive part of an animated cartoon. Gertie opens her mouth to catch the pumpkin. “Now will you raise your left foot?” Gertie devours a tree and shrieks when a mammoth passes by. “Gertie, don’t hurt Jumbo.” Gertie tosses the mammoth in the lake. “Gertie loves music. Play for her and she’ll dance.” While Gertie dances to the music, standing upright on her hind legs, she gets sprayed with water by Jumbo and hurls a boulder at the vengeful mammoth that escapes. After such action, Gertie is tired and takes some rest until a flying reptile turns up. “Did you see that fourwinged lizard?” Gertie nods. “Sure? Are you in the habit of seeing things?” Gertie shakes her head. “Are you fibbing to me? Will you have a little drink? There’s a lake. Take a little drink if you want it.” McCay doesn’t have to tell her twice. Gertie cleans up the whole lake. At the end of the show, McCay goes one step further. He walks offstage and returns in drawn form: “Gertie will now show that she isn’t afraid of me and take me for a ride.” Gertie would open her mouth and the McCay cartoon character would step in to be lifted on her back swinging his whip while she exits. McCay’s Mosquito and McCay’s Gertie—they are both animals and they act that way. Gertie, however, is more animal than the Mosquito that is unnamed but, although it follows its instincts, has a human personality. It loves to be at the center of attention, and while Gertie bows to the audience at McCay’s command, the Mosquito pulls off a feat for the audience at his own request. Gertie is a showcase: the first animated stage personality, the Mosquito’s stage is man’s daily life. His natural goal: to make this life miserable by his blood-sucking antics. Humans have empathy for Gertie as you would have for an overgrown pet. The Mosquito is no pet, never will be, but we like that critter too. He—and it’s certainly him, not It!—behaves mischievously like a brat and has fun. We feel sorry for him when he explodes having sucked too much blood. We don’t feel sorry for the sleeper who lost a few drops of blood. The Mosquito is the first screen animal in animation history that evokes human feelings and true empathy. With the end of vaudeville personal appearances like those of McCay would become rare, and personalities like Walt Disney had to be prerecorded to appear 6\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nas a host on screen or television together with their cartoon characters. In these recordings you see, however, that Disney had enormous acting abilities. And that his animals, like McCay’s, make themselves understood by communicating on a wavelength with the audience. Not only their performances, it’s their personality that captures the audience.\n\n2. Chalk-Talking on a Vaudeville Stage\n\n7\n\n3 Magicians and Masquerades\n\nBesides the vaudevillian actor, early trickfilm refers to magic as an extension of similar stage presentations. The illusion to let persons and things appear and disappear could be easily accomplished cinematographically. Trickfilm pioneer Georges Méliès (1861–1938) was a proprietor of the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in Paris, where he developed and presented many stage illusions before he turned to filmmaking. In 1896, he used the stop trick (or substitution splice) to create the illusion of the Vanishing Lady (Escamotage d’une dame chez Robert-Houdin) on film. The Edison Manufacturing Company used the same trick one year earlier to substitute an actress’ head with a dummy to reconstruct The Execution of Mary Queen of Scots. It was more than just stopping the camera. The illusion was based on a seamless match cut that linked two separately staged shots. James Stuart Blackton (1875–1941), co-founder of the Vitagraph Company of America, started as a cartoonist and a chalk-talker like his client Winsor McCay. He seemed to have been one of the firsts to use the stop trick in combination with drawings: in The Enchanted Drawing (1900) and particularly Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (1906), where he did a lot of stop-framed transformation. The crude Gaumont-produced metamorphoses created by Émile Cohl (1857–1938), a French pioneer of animation and contemporary, even forerunner 9\n\nof Winsor McCay, showing faces that transformed from young to old, from beautiful to old hag, from human to animal, from 2D to 3D puppet, and from human to object to surreal hybrids, are certainly the prototype of the morphing techniques of the digital age, up to The Mask. To Scott Squires of Dream Quest, this show was another big step in CGI development. The Abyss, Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, and then The Mask took CGI another step the evolutionary ladder. Finally, he said, they were able to take surreal cartoon concepts and apply them to the real world. He was right but only partly. The concept of applying metamorphoses onto human faces is as old as cartooning itself. It’s not that revolutionary. It’s a magician’s illusion: just playing around with the novelty. And so even The Mask, although CG was used to transform Jim Carrey into that cartoon face, was only a step ahead in digital infancy. Masks are a key element in the art of performing. Two masks, dating back to the Greek theatre, symbolize the art of the stage: a comedy mask that was associated with Thalia, the muse of comedy and bucolic poetry, and the tragedy mask associated with Melpomene, the muse of tragedy. Stage and film director Peter Brook talks about a mask that is life giving. It affects a wearer and an observer in a positive way. On the other hand, he claims that there is a mask that can be put on the face of a distorted person and make him appear even more deformed. Watching this it creates the impression of a reality more distorted than the one seen ordinarily. Both go under the same name: “masks.” Even the everyday expression is a mask for it is either concealment or lie. In this regard, the ordinary human face might work as a mask.* The earliest type of mask, disguise and costume, a covering to hide or guard the face, dates back several millennia. It might have been taken from animals, but the human skull as found in skeletons must have been an inspiration too. The maybe oldest stone mask found so far dates to 7000 bc and resembles just that, a human skull. There are many ritual masks from all over the world that confirm that acting has a lot to do with religion, that it was kind of a ceremony. Theatre came in later. Right from the beginning, cinema loved the masquerade. Just think of the Alexandre Dumas’ novel Le Vicomte de Bragelonne, repeatedly filmed as The Man in the Iron Mask. Think of Fantomas and the ancestor of The Shadow: Judex, silent serials that were directed by Louis Feuillade for Gaumont in Paris, and of all those ugly horror masks: Frankenstein, Mummy, Wolf Man, and Creature from the Black Lagoon. Think of Zorro, Batman, and of Stan Lee’s menagerie of Marvel superheroes. The Golem of Jewish folklore, with a mask created by sculptor Rudolf Belling, became Paul Wegener’s most famous screen part in movies made in 1914 and 1920, respectively.\n\n* Peter Brook, The Shifting Point: Theatre, Film, Opera 1946–1987. New York: Theatre Communications Group, 1987.\n\n10\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\n4 An Actor’s Vision of Optical Poetry\n\nIn a 1915 lecture, Paul Wegener (1874–1948) was the first Berlin stage actor to dream of new developments in animation and an entirely new universe of synthetically created images. The fact that actors reflected synthetic images is unique. Georges Méliès found it easier to star himself in his films instead of hiring a comedian or an actor. These pictures seemed to be too tricky for actors. Wegener, on the other hand, became interested in trickfilm. He played a key role in German silent cinematography and he wasn’t even interested in the acting, just in technique and aesthetics: You have all seen films in which suddenly a line appears, curves, and changes its form. Out of it grow faces and the line disappears. To me the impression seems highly remarkable. But such things are always shown as an intermezzo and nobody has ever thought of the colossal possibilities of this technique. I think the film as art should be based—as in the case of music—on tones, on rhythm. In these changeable planes, events unreel which are partly identified with natural pattern, yet partly beyond real lines and forms. Imagine one of [Arnold] Böcklin’s sea paintings with all the fabulous tritons and nereids. And imagine an artist duplicating this work in hundreds of copies but with each copy having small displacements so that all copies revealed in succession would result in continuous movement. Suddenly we would see before our 11\n\nvery eyes a world of pure fantasy come to life. Such effects can also be achieved with specially constructed little models animated like marionettes—in this field there are great achievements nowadays. One also can change the pace of different movements by shooting too slow or too fast, developing a fantastic vision which will produce entirely new associations of ideas. We are entering a new pictorial fantasy world as we would enter a magic forest. We are setting foot in the field of pure kinetics—or optical lyric as I call it. This field will perhaps be of major importance and will open new beautiful sights. This eventually is the final objective of each art, and so cinema would gain an autonomous aesthetic domain for itself. A movie could be created which would become an experience of art—an optical vision, a great symphonic fantasy! That it will happen one day, I am sure—and beyond that, I am certain, later generations will look upon our early efforts as upon childish stuttering.*\n\nThis is a vision of a true parallel world created by the manipulation of a sequence of moving images, an illusion put together by the dream machine and mechanics of the cinema projecting a light beam, perceived by the human eye and transferred to the brain. Wegener foresaw a magic forest of optical lyric as he called it. All this was imagined, however, not by an engineering wizard or a technical visionary but by an actor coming from the legitimate stage. Paul Wegener had joined Max Reinhardt’s acting troupe in 1906 and got interested in the movies right before World War I. He understood that the movies were more than a novelty, more than an amusement attraction. It was a new art form and the manipulation of images was to be a part of it. With the end of the Great War, cinema hit puberty and was acknowledged as a new art. It was cinematographer Guido Seeber’s trick photography that enabled Wegener to act with his own doppelganger on screen in The Student of Prague in 1913 and transforming into the Golem in 1915, but it still was Wegener’s vision. The doppelganger topic seems to be quite important for understanding acting in animation. The character you are going to animate is not exactly you. It is like your doppelganger. Ray Harryhausen once said when asked how he would master stop motion art technically: It becomes your second nature. Once, on the quiet, an old-time animation producer told us: The ones who work behind the camera hate those who star in front of the camera. This type of envy shouldn’t be daily fare. Both can learn from each other. Both are filmmakers. Actors are no cattle. Neither are the drawn or digitized actors on screen. Paul Wegener and Walt Disney (with Fantasia) had similar dreams. Today, thanks to digital technology, these dreams come true, at least in terms of technology.\n\n* Rolf Giesen, Der Trickfilm: A Survey of German Special Effects. Cinefex number 25, February 1986.\n\n12\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\n5 Shadow Plays and Silhouette Films The Adventures of Prince Achmed\n\nAnother actress, who was encouraged and supported by the same Wegener, was Lotte Reiniger (1899–1981). She created the most wonderful silhouette films like the feature-length Adventures of Prince Achmed (Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed), which premiered in Berlin and Paris in 1926. Lotte adored actors and dancers, particularly dancers with whom she spent many hours watching them in their performances. She even had access to the private box of Wassily de Basil for the performances of his Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo. At a young age, Lotte had entered the Theatre School of Max Reinhardt, but only wanted to join the classes for the boys, because they did gymnastics. It was in Reinhardt’s school that she developed her paper cutting skills, producing tiny portrait figures with great accuracy, most notably the stars in order to attract their attention. Lotte Reiniger was the first-ever actress to turn her back on acting and become an animator. During Germany’s financial crisis, Louis Hagen, a banker acquaintance, had invested in a large quantity of raw film stock as a shelter from inflation, but the gamble hadn’t paid off—and so Lotte was allowed to use it to make Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, a Thousand and One Night Fantasy, in the magnificent tradition of the Shadow Theatre that originated from Asia, from China, India, and 13\n\nIndonesia, which in fact is one of the founding stones of intercultural synergy between the East and West.\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926). (Courtesy of Primrose Film Productions Ltd. [Caroline Hagen-Hall and Christel Strobel.])\n\nShadow puppetry may be as old as the discovery of shadows themselves. Folk tales, fables, and legends are favorite topics on the shadow screen in any culture and time period. Shadow puppets were first made of paper sculpture, and later on from the hides of donkeys or oxen. That’s why their Chinese name is pi ying, which means shadows of hides. Shadow puppetry was quite successful during the Tang and Song dynasties. Under the rule of Kangxi, the fourth emperor of the Qing dynasty, this folk art became so popular that there were eight generously paid puppeteers in one prince’s mansion. When the Manchu emperors spread their rule to various parts of China, they brought the puppet show with them to make up for the fact that they could not appreciate local entertainment due to language barriers. Only for a few years, the art of puppetry hit hard times in the Middle Kingdom. From 1796 to 1800, the government forbade the public presentation of puppet shows to prevent the spreading of peasant uprising at the time. It was not until 1821 that shadow puppet shows gained vigor again. Shadow puppets can be animals, heroes, or clowns. They can involve full orchestras and detailed settings or tell a story with only one or two props. Puppets can be moved with strings, rods, bamboo, or animal horns. And they can be smaller than the palm of your hand or larger than life. The stage for the show is a white cloth screen on which the shadows of flat puppets are projected. 14\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nIn shadow plays of the past, a candle or an oil lamp cast a soft golden but unpredictable light. Shadow puppets look similar to paper-cut except that their joints are connected by thread so that they can be operated freely. The scene is basic, simple, and almost primitive; it is the consummate performance that wins the spectators’ hearts. Nicknamed the business of the five, a traditional shadow puppet troupe is made up of five people. One operates the puppets, one plays a horn, a suo-na horn, and a yu-kin, one plays banhu fiddle, one is in charge of percussion instruments, and one sings. The singer not only assumes all the roles in the play but also has to play some of the instruments as well. In Germany, at the further end of the Silk Road, the art of the shadow play got from stage straight to the moving picture screen. The technique of this type of film is very simple. As with cartoon drawings, the silhouette films are photographed movement by movement. But instead of using drawings, silhouette marionettes are used. These marionettes are cut out of a black cardboard and thin lead, every limb being cut separately and joined with wire hinges. A study of natural movement is very important, so that the little figures appear to move just as men and women and animals do. But this is not a\n\nLotte Reiniger and assistants working on The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926). (Courtesy of Primrose Film Productions Ltd. [Caroline Hagen-Hall and Christel Strobel.])\n\n5. Shadow Plays and Silhouette Films\n\n15\n\ntechnical problem. The backgrounds for the characters are cut out with scissors as well, and designed to give a unified style to the whole picture. Describing the process of animation, Lotte Reiniger explained that before any acting there is a lot of technique involved to move the flat silhouette puppets around: When you are going to play with your figure seriously, make sure that you are seated comfortably. The shooting will take up a long time and you will have to keep yourself as alert as possible. Don’t wear any bulgy sleeves; they might touch your figure unexpectedly and disturb its position. If possible arrange to place an iron or wooden bar 5 in. above the set along your field of action and let your arms rest on it, so that you touch your figure only with the finger-tips, or with your scissors. […] The most cautiously executed movements must be the slow ones, where you have to alter the position only the fraction of an inch. A steady, slow walk is one of the most tricky movements to execute. Here the most frequent mistake at the beginning is to let the body lag behind the legs, so that they seem to be running away from under the body. If you touch the centre of the body first and move it forward, holding the legs in the initial position, you will notice that they fall into the next position almost by themselves. Tall, lean figures are more prone to these errors than round, short ones, which roll along easily, whilst the balance of the long ones is more difficult to establish. […] If a figure is to turn round it had best to do so in a quick motion. If you want the movement slower you might partly hide it in a convenient piece of the setting.*\n\nLotte’s interest in silhouette films matched perfectly with the fascination with shadows that she shared with Expressionist filmmakers like Fritz Lang, Robert Wiene, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, and Albin Grau who had designed both Nosferatu and Schatten (Shadows). Yet she pointed out that there is a difference between a shadow and a silhouette: From the early days of mankind shadows seemed to men to be something magic. The spirits of the dead were called shadows, and the underworld was named the Kingdom of Shadows and was looked upon with awe and horror. […] The essential difference between a shadow and a silhouette is that the latter cannot be distorted. A silhouette can cast a shadow. When you see trees or figures against an evening sky, you would say, not that they are shadowed against the sky, but silhouetted against it. The silhouette exists in its own right.†\n\n* Lotte Reiniger, Shadow Theatres and Shadow Films. London and New York: B. T.

The technique, originally developed by Max Fleischer (1883–1972), is basically known as rotoscoping. Fleischer who was Art Editor for the Popular Science Magazine felt intrigued by the new process of animation but thought that he could improve on the jerky movements of the early entries in this field. So he filmed his younger brother Dave in a clown’s costume, rear-projected the footage onto an easel covered by glass, and with a pen and some ink traced the photographed images frame by frame onto paper to capture the movement and action of the live actor. Out of Dave Fleischer’s vivid performance, a cartoon character named Ko-Ko the Clown evolved Out of the Inkwell. Fleischer first experimented with the technique in 1914–1915. On December 6, 1915, a patent was filed. Dave’s clown suit was chosen because the high contrast between the black cloth and the white buttons would be easy to trace. Dave owned that costume. For him a dream came true, although by a devious route, as he always had longed to be a clown. Now he was used in animation to answer his desire. For this early experiment, Max photographed Dave\n\n17\n\nsilhouetted against a white sheet, on the roof outside of his apartment. For the first time, animated movements were smooth, fluid, and absolutely lifelike. The premier film took over a year to make although it run only a minute but it was a breakthrough in naturalist animation (as was Eadweard Muybridge’s chronophotography). Fleischer’s cartoons were marvels of invention and imagination. His son Richard, who became a famous live-action film director and would later do 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for his father’s old rival Walt Disney, pointed out that Ko-Ko made his entrance in an almost infinite variety of brilliantly conceived ways: in one cartoon, a drop of ink would transform into the figure of the clown; in another, the clown, only half-finished, would grab Max’s pen and draw the rest of himself. Morphing was the key to this type of screen comedy.* For many years, rotoscoping was also used as a VFX tool in film series like the Star Wars saga. Today’s rotoscope is called motion or performance capture and is completely digitized, but the objective is still the same: to make humans animated actors and make cartoons more human. But even traditional 2D rotoscoping has been resurrected recently, for instance, in Alois Nebel, a 2011-Czech black-and-white film based on a shadowy Graphic Novel by Jaroslav Rudiš and Jaromír Švejdík: At the end of the Communist era, a train dispatcher somewhere at the Czech–Polish border encounters a mute stranger who confronts him with his own past and a murder that happened right after World War II. Alois Nebel was awarded a European Film Prize as Best Animated Film in 2012 but wasn’t selected for Academy Awards consideration. Low-budget filmmakers also used the process in the new film genre of ­animated documentaries and semidocumentaries. One who belongs to this group of animators is Ali Soozandeh who was born in Iran. His Tehran Taboo (2017), an evocative animated feature film, touches grave issues like self-determination, sexual fulfillment, loyalty, and the desire for freedom in a fresh view on Iran’s restrictive society. The picture centers on the lives of young Iran people—lives, in which breaking taboos is part of personal emancipation. All characters act on an awkward level of imprudence that may come as a surprise to Western audiences but is part of everyday life. Pari (32 years) is a single mother. She lives together with her mute little son Elias in a high-rise building in the center of Tehran. To pay her rent and to be able to divorce from her husband who is a convicted drug dealer, she offers sex against money. To keep up appearances, she pretends to be a hospital nurse. Pari’s neighbor Sara (28 years) is pregnant. She lives obediently together with her husband Mohsen and his parents. Patronized by her mother-in-law, she * Richard Fleischer, Out of the Inkwell: Max Fleischer and the Animation Revolution.

In the same area lives Babak (22 years). He studies music and scratches a living by giving music lessons while dreaming of a career as a musician. Because of a one-night stand with young Donya (20 years), he is in big trouble. Donya needs her virginity to be restored prior to her upcoming marriage and Babak has to pay for the illegal operation. Together with his best friend Amir, he tries everything to raise the necessary money. To peek behind the curtain of Iran’s split society, Soozandeh uses the stylistic devices of graphic novels and rotoscope: The fascinating imagery started with shooting real actors in a green screen studio. Then, in one year of hard work, backgrounds were generated and both characters and backgrounds were thoroughly sketched and painted. Finally, all layers were assembled and camera movements were applied in the process of compositing. But, historically speaking, we are ahead of time and have to return to more conventional, nevertheless highly entertaining cartoons.\n\n20\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\n7 The Peak of Character Animation Walt Disney\n\nLike Max Fleischer, Disney’s animators traced also directly over previously recorded live-action footage of actors and actresses thanks to the camera magic of Leonard Pickley—although they came to the conclusion that direct tracing as done in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (a young dancer named Marjorie Celeste Belcher, daughter of choreographer Ernest Belcher, who later would marry animator Art Babbitt, served as live-action model for Snow White, and Margie Bell volunteered to become the Blue Fairy for Pinocchio) looked stiff and unappealing, realizing that the action of the cartoon characters needed to be caricatured. So in the future, they solely referenced from but didn’t trace live-action footage one-to-one as Max Fleischer did. Disney’s animators would run live film sequences at half-speed in their action analysis classes to understand weight, thrusts, and counter thrusts, then for Snow White brought in burlesque actors like Eddie Collins who would do Dopey for them. They even started to act themselves. Art Babbitt would use fellow animator Dick Lundy as a role model for Goofy, film his antics with a 16 mm camera, and use the footage as a reference for his animation.\n\n21\n\nFor the sequence that featured Chernobog, the devil on Bald Mountain of Fantasia fame, Disney animation director Wilfred Jackson shot live action of Bela Lugosi, the screen’s famous Dracula, so that Tytla could study the movements of the devil, the same way Fleischer did with his brother Dave. But the way that Lugosi unfolded his “wings,” grimaced and gesticulated was not the way that the master animator imagined these movements. So after Lugosi left, Tytla had Jackson, who in comparison with the tall Hungarian actor was a skinny person, bare his chest and gesture the way that Tytla directed him. Tytla’s imagination transferred these movements to the monumental evil. Sure, the nightmarish devil was no game for kids. Walt Disney once said he didn’t make films for kids. He very well made kid’s films, but he succeeded in charming adults to become children again and go and see these films. And he wouldn’t be afraid to scare their pants off. The same is true for Jeffrey Katzenberg (who in 2016 left his position as CEO of DreamWorks Animation): …we make our movies for adults and for the adult who exists in every child.*\n\nAlthough he never took acting lessons, Walt Disney was an actor from early childhood on. Interviewed by David Smith, former Disney chief archivist, his cousin Alice Disney Allen recalled that young Walt, without permission, borrowed Brother Roy’s blue serge suit and did a Chaplin act in a local theater. Animator Les Clark said that Mickey was Walt: the laugh, the nervous characteristics at times. Walt would act it out for the animators by pantomime.† Disney was the only cartoon producer who was not only in animation but also, as we know, in live action too. It made no difference to him. If he could Walt Disney would prefer to do live action which, thanks to popular stars, was more prestigious and less time consuming in production. The proudest moment of his cinematic career might have been Mary Poppins (1963) that contained only a short animated segment. Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954) was first considered as animated feature before it became a live-action CinemaScope picture directed, as we have seen, by Max Fleischer’s son Richard. Except for James Mason’s Captain Nemo, all the other characters, however, Kirk Douglas as Ned Land, Paul Lukas as Professor Aronnax, and Peter Lorre as Conseil remain cartoons. The liveliest actor was a giant squid prop that didn’t work from the beginning but when they decided to place it in a storm sequence, it performed terrifically and stuck in audience’s memory as the highlight of the picture. * Joanna Moorhead, Jeffrey Katzenberg: How to Make a Perfect Family Film.

Bloomington: Xlibris, 2012.\n\n22\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nDisney’s forays into live feature and TV films included Guy Williams as Zorro, Fred MacMurray as The Absent-Minded Professor, and Peter Ustinov, signed right before Walt’s death, as Captain Blackbeard. (In September 1959, during the Cold War, when he visited Hollywood, Nikita Khrushchev eagerly hoped to go to see Disneyland but much to the Soviet Premier’s annoyance he was turned down for safety reasons. Ustinov, a thoroughbred comedian, suggested to Disney he would like to play Krushchev in a film and would use different disguises just to get into Disneyland. Alas, that movie was never made. It would have been a hilarious comedy.) Fess Parker a.k.a. Davy Crockett, who was the first actor signed to a long-term contract by Disney, however, was unhappy on the lot. He said that Disney treasured his great animators who were in effect the actors in his animated films but that it was baffling to him that Disney wouldn’t have had some of the same feeling about the most important actors in his live-action films.*\n\n* Fess Parker interviewed by Michael Barrier. http://www.michaelbarrier.com.

The Peak of Character Animation\n\n23\n\n8 Shamanism and Totemism\n\nWhat made people think that Disney produced shows for kids were not only his fairy tales but was his constant use of cute animals: mice, cats, dogs, horses, chicken, pigs… you name them: the whole barnyard ensemble up and down. Walt Disney was sort of a barnyard kid himself: A genuine country boy. His boyhood hometown was Marceline, Missouri. Some of his most famous cartoons are a mix of fairy tales with all kinds of rodents and farm animals on board, and a mix of European style with American rusticity. On his European trips, especially in 1935, Disney would buy all kind of reference books and ask one of his artists, Albert Hurter, who was born in Zurich, to do inspirationals that were authentic to the respective background. In the process of “(type) casting,” Donald Duck would be introduced to The Wise Little Hen (which was basically a Russian story), Mickey Mouse would star in The Barn Dance before he climbed the ladder of success and was cast as The Brave Little Tailor and The Sorcerer’s Apprentice, a cricket would co-star with Pinocchio, and Cinderella’s helpers would consist of a gang of mice. For regular actors, it is quite difficult to portray an animal. They need costumes but usually their anatomy is not built the way animals are and the result looks like Bert Lahr’s Cowardly Lion costume in The Wizard of Oz that was made 25\n\nby British taxidermist George Lofgren who came to America when he was 9 years old and would work with Willis O’Brien and Ray Harryhausen and for Alfred Hitchcock on The Birds. Some quadruped dinosaurs like Anguirus (Angirasu), the mutated ankylosaurus from Toho’s Gojira no gyakushu (Gigantis, the Fire Monster/Godzilla Raids Again, 1955), forced the bit players inside the rubber suits shamefully down on all fours, but what they did was more crawling than walking. Special makeup artists Charlie Gemora and Rick Baker came nearest to nature building the best gorillas in film business before the digital age for pics like Murders in the Rue Morgue and Phantom of the Rue Morgue, Gorillas in the Mist or Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. We know that shamans often disguised as animals too and looked like the hybrids of mythology. It was Ed Hooks who pointed out in his lecture tours that actors as well as animators might have the same ancestor: the shaman. A true priest, said Constantin Stanislavsky (also spelled Stanislavski), is aware of the presence of the altar all the time and the same way a true artist should react to the stage. Insiders say that to Eiji Tsuburaya, a technical creator of the Japanese Godzilla films, the movie studio was a sacred place. A shaman is a person who enters an altered state of consciousness to travel in a kind of parallel universe, similar of nowadays digital, virtual world. Their healing “shows” are regarded as a source of acting and storytelling. They used to sing, pray, drum, and dance. Animal spirits were their constant companions. As part of their animal worship they believed in the Power Animals that are around us all the time, that take pity on us when we are born, and protect us. Power Animals represent the ties of man with nature and document the human/animal dualism. Often the objective of early cultures was to lock horns with, say, a bull to kill the strongest or fastest animal of the country and drink the victim’s blood to absorb its strength and abilities: bear, deer, wolf, and snake. This mimesis and shamanistic transmutation that involved imitation of animals extended animal concepts into the social domain and is part of totemism that we find in traditional economies that rely on hunting and gathering. What you had killed you showed respect to because it was a living being and it feeds us. To a shaman everything is living, even a stone—and that is true for the animator too. The Power Animal becomes a protective spirit. In the Western film genre, although we notice it only subconsciously, the horse becomes the Power Animal of the Cowboy, for instance, Lucky Luke’s horse, Jolly Jumper. Actors are the direct heirs to shamanism while artists and painters are the ones to record what they did and, more important: what they saw. German anthropologist Andreas Lommel mentioned the man–animal picture known as “the Sorcerer” located at the Les Trois Frères cave in the Ariege. To him it is the oldest known portrayal of a shaman, maybe a shaman disguised in an animal suit. Thus, for the first time, the animal was humanized. 26\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nA shaman acts as a bridge between different worlds, just like an actor and an artist who guide audiences and spectators to another dimension, a dimension between life and death: to see, explore, and experience the things behind. Today, we have the media to revive and re-animate the souls of the dead. It is little surprise that the spiritists of the late nineteenth century, the heirs of the shamans, used man-made technology such as telegraphic and telephonic contact and photographic effects to establish a communication with the world beyond. Hayao Miyazaki’s Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi, 2001) is a truly Shamanic film. It shows us the things and ghosts that are behind reality. In the rational world of today, we are not allowed to do so. In children’s tales, films, and animation, and in video games where we actually take part in role games we are allowed. Humans are irrational. They need to believe in this other dimension. A shamanic play is like a healing ritual. After seeing a good movie or a good play, we feel cured too. Isn’t the Walt Disney Company, one of the world’s self-proclaimed leading producers and providers of entertainment, based on ancient animism and totemism: founded on the myth of a mouse? By definition totemism is a mystical relationship with a spirit being, with a powerful animal. Disney, however, is totemism that has lost its meaning. We experience it in the Magic Kingdom of Disneyland. In the Internet, we have found a fascinating little Japanese import, a totem pole mug set with Mickey, Minnie, and Pluto, and another one with Humphrey the Bear, Donald, Goofy, and Mickey. Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein wrote an essay about Disney in which he called the very idea of an animated cartoon a direct manifestation of the method of animism. In that regard, he said, what Disney does is connected with one of the deepest features of the early human psyche. So it is no wonder that Power Animals would early on transform into cartoon stars, with one exception, however: The strong animals of Shamanic visions and journeys, the mighty eagle, for instance, that took the visionary in his trance high above mountains and countryside, are merely supporting players in cartoons while the tiny ones, especially the mice, became the ones audiences would sympathize with. Occasionally, some animals are even used explicitly in the shamanic way as Power Animals in cartoon series and animated feature films: Sure Rémy the Rat of Ratatouille fame acts as such a power animal* to an aspiring young cook named Alfredo Linguini. More on Ratatouille, one of the best and most emotional cartoon films ever, later. Earlier Disney used the concept when he attributed a cricket conscience to marionette-to-become-a-real-boy Pinocchio. Disney heroines favorably respond to animal “sidekicks:” Cinderella befriends a gang of mice, Pocahontas has a pet raccoon named Meeko, Jasmine (Aladdin) * Not a classic power animal but thanks to cunning the rat finished in first in the Chinese zodiac and appeared on the back of a buffalo in front of Buddha.\n\n8. Shamanism and Totemism\n\n27\n\nis seen in the company of Rajah the tiger, Rapunzel (Tangled) has Pascal, a chameleon, as her best friend and confidante, and Mulan has a weird but tiny dragon called Mushu. In a recent series that premiered on Disney Channel in the summer of 2016, Elena of Avalor, the fox Zuzu—which acts as a link between the world of humans and ghosts and only can be seen by the heroine princess—is described as a power or a spirit animal by the series’ creator and executive producer, Craig Gerber.\n\n28\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\n9 Famous Cartoon Animals\n\nAnimism and animation have the same root. Let’s have a look at all those famous anthropomorphic cartoon animals that are indeed a reflection on shamanism and animism. Very often in the cartoons, humans are compared to animals, same as in the Shamanic vision. American cartoons most often used cute animals and upended nature to have sheep-loving little David win over the carnivorous barbarian, Goliath. Mickey Mouse has become a trademark although there are cartoon stars that are more popular. The mouse is seen as a wise animal: quiet, shy, understanding, invisible, stealthy, neat, meek and humble, scrutinizing, and paying attention even to the tiniest detail. In storytelling, the mouse reflects favorably the David and Goliath principle: In small we trust. Be faithful to the little things. In the great American tales, it’s quite often the underdog who is the hero while in real life we would consider him beneath contempt. And like Chaplin’s tramp, the early Mickey Mouse started out as an underdog but his optimism became a symbol of hope in the time of the Great Depression. One of the reasons is that Mickey came first, well, not exactly, not even in sound. Even Disney had another character before Mickey (and lost it to Universal): Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. But it was Mickey that fit the bill. Ub Iwerks was the 29\n\nfirst to draw him, construct him out of simple black circles and rubber tube arms and legs, but the personality was invented by Disney himself. Although Iwerks, for a while lured away from the Disney Studio by Pat Powers, tried on his own and invented Flip the Frog and Willie Whopper, he failed because, although these characters were equally simple, they lacked Mickey’s personality. But we shouldn’t belittle Iwerks’ part. Mickey’s sometimes raucous behavior—being very abusive to other animals, being an anarchist—seemed to have been a part of Iwerks’ character. Mickey started as an actor, as a parodist. In his first films, he parodied Charles Lindbergh (Plane Crazy), Douglas Fairbanks (Gallopin’ Gaucho), Al Jolson, and absorbed a little bit from everyone to fill his character. Acting and parodying was his forte because Mickey himself was a shy character haunted by the psychological problems of everyday America. One Walther Schneider would even go so far as to describe Mickey as mentally disordered: The chronic movie image of Mickey Mouse displays unmistakable streaks of a paranoid mental illness of its originator. A diagnosis of the spindle-shanked, hydrocephalic, astigmatic and neurasthenic Mickey Mouse reveals particularly disorders in the sphere of face and hearing (commonly called mental delusions). On closer examination, concerning these “pathologically changed perceptions of real objects”, one has to decide if this is a manic or paranoid case. […] Basically, this preposterous behavior (in kitchen, ice boxes, fortresses and deserts) is a kind of paranoia that is characterized by right logic under wrong prerequisites. The “distortion of space, time and causal connections” (in the film plot), the “blurred blending of various objects” (the car that transforms into a living being, the dancing piano stool), the “permanently erroneous repetition of perceptions” (multiplications of young Mickey Mouses) is indicative of youth madness. A psychiatric surveillance of Mickey Mouse that lasted over several screenings leaves no doubt of a serious case of paraphrenia as described by [Emil] Kraepelin (related to Dementia paranoids). The world of Mickey Mouse ideas, voluptuously equipped with fantasy and narrative streaks, represents a marginal case of lunacy psychoses that often leads to severe temper tantrums.*\n\nThis revealing “analysis” was published in 1931 in a respected Berlin magazine. Although it seems quite certain that it was maybe satirically meant, there are some words of truth. Even Disney, when he became saturated and conservative, had doubts about Mickey’s “mental disorder” and had the character change from sturm und drang, storm and stress to petit bourgeois. More and more, Mickey lost popularity and simply became a trademark. He had become a suburban citizen like so many of us. Like the viewers changed socially, a number of cartoon characters changed psychologically. In his early films, Mickey was a funny chap and sort of an adventurer, even a slob and rebel. But Disney realized that Mickey was primitive in animation and that made him order to re-design the character and make him more charming, not the animated stick he was in his first pictures. * Walther Schneider, Micky Maus ist geisteskrank. Der Querschnitt #10, Berlin 1931, p. 679. Printed with permission of J. P. Storm Collection.\n\n30\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nClothes made the mouse. The early Mickey was almost completely naked except for red shorts and big shoes. The later version was meticulously dressed. Some pictures even show Mickey in a tail coat. The pursuit of charm and personality, however, for anatomical correctness over cartoony action would change Mickey’s character completely and put him in the background. So Mickey became this uninteresting character, a shadow of his early popular self, with his dog Pluto destined to do all the funny things, provide the gags and bring Mr. Mouse in trouble. Disney story artist and director Jack Kinney called Mickey a bastard to work with: a Boy Scout but what the hell to do with a Boy Scout? Although simply constructed, the late Mickey was not easy to draw and certainly became boring to act. His formerly rebellious mind was projected onto a gang of sidekicks, like Donald Duck, that became more popular than the original creature. Disney didn’t exactly realize that the figurative simplicity was the key to success, but he had to change the caricature the more he was striving for naturalism. (As many actors were: for different reasons as we will see.) Just consider changing the design of the Simpsons or South Park kids of today’s television. Nevertheless, many cartoon characters, contemporaries of Mickey, remained zany and crazy. They are like bad-boy avatars of those who enjoy the movies and want to break out of their petty bourgeois existence but are unable to do so. Woody Woodpecker was nuts when he started out in a supporting part in a 1940 Andy Panda cartoon, Knock Knock. Producer Walter Lantz claimed that the crazy bird was based on a real woodpecker that was pecking holes in a cottage. The bird was so disruptive that Lantz’ wife suggested to turn him into a cartoon character. It was not Lantz who finished the job but one of his employees, story man Ben “Bugs” Hardaway, fresh from Warners, where he had worked on Bugs Bunny that was originally Bugs’ Bunny. Woody was terrible. He was rambunctious, highly aggressive, and had a crazy laugh that was adopted from Happy Rabbit, a predecessor of Bugs. In 1944, this hundred-percent insane character was transferred from the forest right into opera where he did The Barber of Seville. This was the first Woody Woodpecker cartoon to feature a refined version of the woodpecker that was designed by Emery Hawkins and layout artist Art Heinemann. The red belly had been altered to white. Then, however, a change occurred initiated by a shorts director who came straight from less anarchic or no-anarchic-at-all Disney, Dick Lundy, who would make the character more sympathetic. Out went the early day madness. Woody became rational, small, cute, and likeable in a complete turn-around of personality change. Each cartoon character seems to have two souls: an assimilated and an unassimilated. Cartoon aficionados seem to sympathize with the unassimilated, while cartoon producers usually will go for the assimilated. Bugs Bunny, on the other hand, was smart aleck, a pain in the ass to his adversaries like Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam: This means war. According to Frank 9. Famous Cartoon Animals\n\n31\n\nTashlin, one of his early directors, all of Bugs came from a 1934 Disney Silly Symphony, The Tortoise and the Hare. With one major difference, we might say: The Disney hare is incredibly vain and therefore not at all sympathetic. He is no role model at all. His antics are disgusting. Ten years later, Warners made a spoof of The Tortoise and the Hare called Tortoise Wins by a Hare, and one sees that Bugs doesn’t work very well in that context: being outsmarted by a turtle. Bugs works better as an avenger to those who interrupt his peaceful life. And that would mean that his personality was based on the witty dialogue. But even a character like him can vary from film to film and from director to director. Just compare the Bugs Bunny of Tex Avery to the one supervised by Chuck Jones, Robert Clampett, or Friz Freleng. Chuck Jones considered his Bugs quite different from that directed by Bob Clampett who resembled Woody Woodpecker or Friz Freleng. Freleng’s cartoons, like Sahara Hare (1955), were more physical, with things happening quickly. Jones’ version tended to think out his problems and solve them intellectually. But Jones saw his Bugs never as a revolutionary. He understood him as a counterrevolutionary. One of the best creations conceived by Chuck Jones and his main storyboard artist Michael Maltese was Wile E. Coyote. This character is its own worst enemy. He’d never ever catch the Road Runner. The more frustrated, the more wildly inventive he becomes. Santayana said that a fanatic is one who redoubles his efforts when he’s forgotten his aim. Wile E. is that kind of fanatic. The Coyote is a character not so much by acting but by definition as a complete loser who wouldn’t surrender and give up losing (as gamblers don’t give up gambling while they lose), enriched by the quality of accidents and Fast & Furryous gags. This is why we always identify with the pains the Coyote suffers. It is the same as in daily life: No matter how hard we work, no matter how clever our schemes, we invariably seem to get out-run by someone who hardly tries at all like Gladstone Gander, Donald Duck’s comic book nemesis. Upon leaving Warner Bros., Michael Maltese and Chuck Jones got a hold of Tom & Jerry after MGM had closed down their own cartoon department. Both decided to change the original design particularly of Tom Cat and out came a completely different character. Style changed personality and performance, not to the likes of outspoken Tom & Jerry fans. The facial expression, especially the eyes, produced a totally different cat. The same happened to Mickey Mouse, as we have seen, when he was completely clothed like a petit bourgeois and to the domesticated Woody Woodpecker. Daffy Duck was different than Donald, the proverbial black duck among the animated duck community: literally daffy, speaking in a lisping, spitting form, schizophrenic, considering himself witty to no end, and trying to outsmart smart aleck Bugs Bunny but failing constantly. But the same as with Bunny, his personality would change from director to director. Best he was portraying an anarchist. The Pink Panther started out as title character for Blake Edwards’ comedies to become a cartoon star in his own right. In pantomime, he equals Felix the Cat 32\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nbut, named after a jewel, he is more elegant. Dignified, cool, and most important: pink he is sure a ladies’ man. The Panther developed into a successful series character in television, one of the last famous cartoon animals. There is one single quality that many cartoon animals have. Regardless of whether they try to kill each other with sticks of dynamite or have themselves steamrolled, they always resurrect as if nothing had happened. They are cartoons and so they are immortal like Gods. They are shining stars and so we admire and envy them.\n\n9. Famous Cartoon Animals\n\n33\n\n10 Animators to Become Actors and Actresses (Sort of)?\n\nAn animator has to have not only acting and dubbing reference, but inwardly he has to have certain acting qualities himself. In the old days, animators had a mirror in front of their drawing board to study their own facial expression and grimaces. But when they call an animator an actor with a pen, it’s a misnomer. Inwardly, yes, as he might use techniques to put feelings into a character, but never ever will he equal a professional actor. There are young aspiring animators who say that they are afraid to act. They don’t have to. They never will be actors. They never should be. They are like puppeteers, remaining in the dark. Always will. They have to know about acting (as they have to know about film theory and film history) because they have to judge it. But they are certainly no actresses or actors themselves. They don’t have to be afraid; they don’t have to enter a stage. Vice versa actors won’t become animators. We only know about one Tom Holland, an actor who in the early 1960s would do some stop motion work for a Hollywood company named Project Unlimited, animating a boy and a caveman riding a Brontosaurus in Dinosaurus! (1960), Cormoran in a dance miniature (for reference he had himself filmed doing Cormoran’s dance steps), and some scenes with a two-headed giant and a 35\n\nharpy for Jack the Giant Killer (1962). In 2D animation we don’t know any, only ­d irectors who would move from animation to live action: Gregory La Cava, Frank Tashlin, Brad Bird, Andrew Adamson, Tim Burton, and Marjane Satrapi who went from co-directing Persepolis (2007) to Chicken with Plums (2011). However, the animator must become one with the image he creates. The image will absorb him mentally: According to a Chinese legend, there was an old painter who had painted a landscape that depicted a beautiful valley, with mountains in the distance. The painter liked the valley so much that he walked right inside the painting and disappeared into the mountains, never to be seen again. The issue here is very simple. The old Chinaman had simply used his brush to create reality. For that was the belief at the time: things are just as they appear to be. A picture is no longer a picture; it is a reality that can be entered into, something definitive and fixed. By using pencil, paint, clay, or pixels, the animator has to make an audience emphatically believe in a creation that was voiced for him by a professional actress or actor. Believable acting means that the audience will feel that the character’s actions are the result of his own inner emotions and not what the animator might pretend. It means that the character has personality and reflects, even in the tiniest gesture, mood. If the people could watch the faces of the best animators when caught up in the act of drawing an emotional scene, said Brad Bird, they would see artists as fully invested in the moment as the best live actors: The difference is that an animator stays in that moment, often working for weeks to express an emotion his or her character takes only seconds to convey on screen.*\n\nThe menagerie of anthropomorphized animals in animation based on the work of the great storytellers in history from Aesop to Jean de La Fontaine is impressive as we have seen: all these animal characters require from the animators the combined knowledge of human and animal behavior to express them in the great art of character animation. For actors, and particularly for animators, it is useful to develop a kinesthetic sense and a thorough understanding of music and rhythm. Frank Gladstone, the former Director of Training at DreamWorks SKG and CEO of his own ­company, Gladstone Film, feels that an animator is responsible for creating characters that not only fit their own voices but can perform without vocal cues as well. The more keenly developed a kinesthetic sense an actor, dancer, or animator has, the more capacity that artist has to portray various characters and exhibit organic nuances and gestures appropriate to that character. * Brad Bird, foreword to Ed Hooks, Acting for Animators: A Complete Guide to Performance Animation. Revised Edition. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann Drama, 2003, pp. vi–vii.\n\n36\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nIt’s mandatory that above good movement and fluid animation you feel personality. Therefore, in the old days, animators were often cast according to characters. At least that was Disney’s principle. Like actors particular animators can handle certain parts better than others. In most productions it is not possible to follow this principle, which means that one character might be handled by different persons. In such cases, there never will be outstanding character animation. First comes movement, then personality, and out of personality comes emotion. Animator Art Babbitt reminds a memorable scene from Disney’s Dumbo drawn by the great Bill Tytla, where he comes to visit his mother who is locked up in a cage. Babbitt recalls to have seen this picture in several places around the world and each time people in the audience would weep: It could have been so crude and maudlin but instead it was done with great sensitivity and taste. It’s assumed you can make somebody laugh with funny little drawings, but to be able to use these funny little drawings and to make a person feel so deeply that he weeps—in my estimation, that is true artistry.*\n\nFrom Tytla we know that he had read Polish actor-director Richard Boleslavsky’s book, Acting: The First Six Lessons (1933), and used the book’s principles in animation: concentration, memory of emotion, dramatic action, characterization, observation, and rhythm. Walt Disney said that their most important aim was to develop definite personalities, not just shadows, but something that would provoke emotional response from the public. They didn’t want them to parallel or assume the aspects of human beings or human actions. Instead they endowed them with human weaknesses, which they exaggerated in a humorous way. Rather than a caricature of individuals, their work was supposed to be a caricature of life. Disney was one of the first to enter television. Other animators would follow his example when the production of theatrical shorts became limited. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera had made the Tom & Jerry Cartoons for MGM. Now they had to confine to low budgets offered by Screen Gems, the TV arm of Columbia Pictures. They had to change the characters figuratively. Barbera recalled that it cost $40,000 to $65,000 to make one of the classic MGM Tom & Jerry cartoons. Screen Gems offered no more than $2700 for 5 minutes. Their secret weapon was the “limited” or “planned” animation technique that they had already used to create full-length trial runs of each MGM cartoon. A limited animation test required only about 1800 drawings instead of the 20,000 or 30,000 thousand for the finished product. For television, they needed to refine the technique and developed working procedures that used about 3000 drawings for a 5-minute cartoon. * Ed Hooks, Acting for Animators: A Complete Guide to Performance Animation. Revised Edition. Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann Drama 2003, p. 86.\n\n10. Animators to Become Actors and Actresses (Sort of)?\n\n37\n\nTelevision was just based on the arithmetic. In the early days, animation was designed on bodily motion and gestures as way to express individual personality. Even in the early sound films, there was only little dialogue. The tempo was defined by sound effects and music score. That happened at a time when even silent comedians had to tune into dialogue or have been reduced to become bit players. Some say that character and acting came in anyway by dialogue and that happened even before the feature films. It happened in one of Disney’s most beloved short films that became a highlight among the Silly Symphonies, in front of the background of Depression and New Deal: In the 1933 Three Little Pigs they had three characters that looked alike. So they had to differentiate them by the way they moved, by the way they acted, and the way they spoke and sang. Otherwise, the three of them would have been equal. Disney didn’t want his characters to be just something moving around on the screen and doing funny things, cartoon director Wilfred Jackson said. He would go for more and wanted the audience to care what happened to the characters, and to believe them as real, not just as a bunch of funny drawings. That was the time when several animators at the Disney studio even enrolled in acting classes. Generally, at that time, cartoon characters were stereotypes: Like for instance when they did The Tortoise and the Hare. It was clearly laid out to have the hare act the way he did, bombastic and boastful, yet talented. That was good, clear characterization. The tortoise was definitely staged as a stupid guy who could good-naturedly be taken advantage of. Actually he won by default. This was the kind of strong characterization that Walt always insisted on. If anybody else had done The Tortoise and the Hare it would have been a series of assorted gags about running, one after another.\n\nThey often wondered, Dick Huemer would add, if Disney could have been a great actor or a comedian. The acting in them was what made his pictures so great.* Most of his fellow students at Folkwang School in Essen, Germany, looked down on Andreas Deja. The young graphic designer was not interested in abstract animation but fascinated by Disney’s character animation, which he had literally inhaled studying Hans Bacher’s Super 8- and 16-mm prints of Disney animation frame by frame. Deja was insistent and applied to Disney. Everybody was flabbergasted when Deja was eventually hired on the strength of some pencil test animation that showed a witch having problems starting a broom and riding off. That means he was hired on the strength of his cartoon acting. During his long stay, he was lucky enough to animate some of the great 2D Disney characters: Roger Rabbit, Gaston in Beauty and the Beast, Jafar in Aladdin, Scar in The Lion * Joe Adamson, With Disney on Olympus. An Interview with Dick Huemer. Funnyworld No. 17, 1977, p. 38.\n\n38\n\nActing and Character Animation\n\nKing, and Lilo Pelekai in Lilo & Stitch. Deja was convinced that a sure feeling for acting is a vital prerequisite for outstanding animation. He knows that there are good animators around who do nice, polished drawings, but there is no emotion to come over. Some might need to attend acting classes, he says, others, him included, work intuitively. They watch people live and on screen. In television, however, with the zany action gone, there was no need for nuances in acting. Figures were characterized by more and more dialogue until it became illustrated radio. The classic cartoons had no or not much dialogue. They were based on the variations of a chase like that of a cat and a mouse. But with television, it had to be a human story because it would require dialogue to save action.\n\n10.
