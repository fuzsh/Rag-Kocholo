However, the people who were most responsible for this book’s being prepared in its present version are the following: Mark Kausler, Tim Walker, David Shepard, Ian Cameron, Tim Cawkwell, Bob Gitt, Mike Barrier, Richard Simonton, J. K. Morrow, Pat Sheehan of the Library of Congress, Roger Mayer of MGM, Erwin Ezzes and Eve Baer of United Artists, Rae Lindquist, Mike Barlow, Phyllis Lipka, David Colker, Barry Snyder, John O’Connor, Friz Freleng and Walter Lantz. Mention should also be made of Lindsay “P.” Doran, who researched many of the salient details in the Filmography and typed every single word of the manuscript, some of them three or four times, and only a few of them wrong. This book is dedicated to Lindsay Doran, by the way, and there’s no modesty on my part when I say she deserves better. Portions of Chapter V appeared under its present title, “You Couldn’t Get Chaplin in a Milk Bottle,” in TAKE ONE, vol. 2 no. 9, December 19, 1970. I fully intend one of these days to get around to asking Peter Lebensold, the editor of that fine publication, for permission to reprint this material. (Inci¬ dentally, this article was translated by Max Tessier for the French publica¬ tion Ecran 73, Janvier No. 11, under the title “Rencontres avec Tex Avery.”)\n\nI. OF MICE AND CRTS\n\nSide Streets Animation, as a subject, is far more interesting than Millard Fillmore, but historically it’s been given the same treatment. When a man goes about writing an inclusive history of film, throwing out cartoons seems to be the first order of business, right after rolling up the sleeves and clearing the desk of rubber bands. It all began with Lewis Jacobs, who, in 1939, gave Walt Disney credit for being some kind of an artist (something, at least, beyond the aesthetic level of a door-to-door salesman) and then made the state¬ ment with a frog in his throat: “Though active only in the sphere of the animated cartoon, he nevertheless is more significant as a film artist than any of his contemporaries,” said Mr. Jacobs in The Rise of the American Film. Why “though”? Whence “only”?? Wherefore “nevertheless”??? And on it’s gone since then, the obligatory passage early in the book explaining that, gee, with all there was to do we just couldn’t spend any time on animated cartoons, and they should really have a book of their own someday in the sweet bye-and-bye, but meanwhile we’ll expend a lot of verbiage on the documentary film, as if that some¬ how were in the mainstream of film history. And so the “book of their own” remains a fantasy, apologetic promontories go on gracing moun¬ tains of aesthetic discrimination, Robert Flaherty and Pare Lorentz become icons, and Tex Avery remains a shadow. Animators spend years drawing circles and drawing forth joy, but the historians are preoccupied with drawing lines. Film is too limitless an art to allow these artificial borders to stand indefinitely, of course, but as long as they do, the same cartoons that used to run ahead of the feature picture are furlongs behind in the Critical Evaluation Sweepstakes. Not only that, but their appreciation is subject to the same con¬ descension toward Popular Culture that once plagued their featurelength cousins. First, of course, comes the You-Can’t-Beat-the-Star-System Stage. The days when John Wayne was the Celebrity and John Ford the Obscurity belong to the distant past, but responsible adults who delight in the adventures of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the Roadrunner, put blank looks on their faces when you mention Tex Avery, Friz Fre11\n\nleng, or Chuck Jones—though they have probably read those names off screen credits more often than Otto Preminger’s or John Huston’s. When something actually does get into print about the subject, then the Pin-the-Tail-on-Aunt-Emily Effect usually comes into prom¬ inence: historians stabbing about in the dark, making any statement that sounds factual, and secure in the knowledge that few of their readers are equipped to prove them wrong. This once allowed people like Lewis Jacobs to scramble Griffith films and Chaplin titles with an abandon that a post-Sarris reader can only find hilarious, but to writers on Animation the faux pas is still de rigueur. In the presum¬ ably authoritative International Encyclopedia of Film, Roger Manvell typifies the style when he writes of “the traditional Tom & Jerry series of Tex Avery, the Cat and Mouse characters originated in the late 1940’s.” Even begging the grammatical question that wants to call Tex Avery a Cat and Mouse, there are almost more mistakes in this sen¬ tence than there are words: we find Mr. Manvell crediting Avery with the creation of characters he in fact never used even once (nearly all the Tom and Jerrys were directed by Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, who created the characters under Rudy Ising) and allowing their birth to follow their fifth Oscar (they were the star characters of the mid-forties and first appeared in a 1939 cartoon called PUSS GETS THE BOOT). He might as well have been talking about the “traditional” Myrna Loy Westerns of Alfred Hitchcock. Things go on in this way for several years before writers are willing to take the matter to the advanced stage called the Sociological Sidestep, whereby the films can be seriously discussed and with a cer¬ tain attempt at accuracy, but only through a point of view that seeks to diminish the individual filmmaker to the level of a pawn in the grip of massive social undercurrents, commercial trends, and class struggles. These people will find musicals of the early thirties interesting only for the light they may shed on the “manners and mores of the times,” and they will flock to wartime propaganda atrocities to watch “attitudes” being “reflected”—they speak constantly, in fact, of films as “mirrors,” without seeing the wonderland that resides just inside them. In the realm of cartoons we have a stab as blind as Richard Schickel’s in The Disney Version: Bugs Bunny is not the product of anyone’s imag¬ ination, he is the personification of The Free World’s resistance to Hitler; Mickey Mouse is not a screen personality, he is the very em¬ bodiment of the innocence and charm of Rural Americana. To this people perk up their ears. They pay attention and money. Simon & Schuster publishes the book, and people go around saying, “Richard Schickel wrote a book about Walt Disney.” But he didn’t. A popular subdivision of the Sociological Sidestep is the Propa¬ ganda Poop-Out: critics with an ax to grind and a nose for nothing but grindstones. Here we find the moralizing attitude that would cham¬ pion HIGH NOON and THE OX-BOW INCIDENT while ignoring RIO BRAVO and THE SEARCHERS. In Ralph Stephenson’s book The Animated Film (known among those familiar with it as “The Outrage of Ralph Stephenson” or, among the more familiar, “The 12\n\nOutrage of Ralph”), Hollywood animation is written off as pure mind¬ less violence while miasmas of praise are spun for European classics like George Dunning’s THE APPLE: . . a William Tell complex . . . hints at secret vices ... it is a mad, suggestive film.” Well, THE APPLE isn’t so bad, as cartoons of this type go. Observation, detail, creativity, visual excitement, and genuine humor are at a minimum, of course, but the pay-off is amusing and nice enough to nearly justify the time it takes to sit through the film. But one-liners like this are a frightfully limited way for an art form to spend its time; stories and characters with lifeblood in their veins are commodities harder to come by. (All of Avery’s films are mad and suggestive, if that’s what the critic is out for, and what they hint at goes way beyond vice or versa.) Stephenson’s book (also known as “An Ounce of Pretension”) is characteristic of another frame of mind, which might be called the I-May-Not-Know-What-I-Like-But-I-Know-Art Syndrome. By this ra¬ tionale, nothing performed in a given art form can be considered worthy until it closely resembles the entrenched techniques of some other art form. The feature film has long been out of the dark age in which essay¬ ists felt they had to call INTOLERANCE “the only film fugue” before getting around to saying something nice about it, and in which THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, because it used expressionistic paint¬ ings for backgrounds, was considered the solitary artistic venture of the flickering image. But it’s clear that animation is still back there when Ralph Stephenson can say of FANTASIA, “A section to Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring should be mentioned, because it was favorably received by the composer as a legitimate interpretation of his music.” As if that was within hailing distance of a criterion! The Zagreb school of anima¬ tion, with its Cubist features and its featureless cubes, joins UPA (United Productions of America, creators of Mr. Magoo and Gerald McBoing Boing) in enjoying the kind of recognition that smells of dank museum corridors, while screen cartoonists with inventiveness and orig¬ inality (whom the Zagreb animators would love to emulate, but simply haven’t got the budgets) have become the black sheep of the fold. Where feature film devotees meet, these narrow-minded attitudes have been banished to the remotest outposts of civilization, such as film appreciation classes in Idaho. But where animation, the new underdog of the arts, is concerned, the blinders are still on. You can see it happening. Some asthmatic college professor look¬ ing for attention one day decides that perhaps, yes, animation can be considered an art form. But only (the disciplinarian in him coming out) if it adheres to certain principles. And what does he pick for his prin¬ ciples? Personal expression, a living contact with people and their cul¬ ture, a dynamic use of the medium’s resources, a range of feelings that cannot be expressed in any other art form, the mystical impulse which turns the commonplace into art? No. It will be a decaying old precept left over from some other art form, and probably some other century. The golden mean, or unity of place and time. Well, there are a lot of us who think animation can be considered an art form, but we don’t go to Stravinsky for our guidelines. 13\n\n\"bugs bunny”\n\nAnimation, like film, is an art of images: moving, profound, hyper¬ bolic, or just funny, they are images that hopefully express something about their creators’ insides, about the conflict inherent in the story, or about life on this particular planet. As images, they have no more obliga¬ tion to resemble impressionist or cubist art than do the images in the great films to resemble Dore etchings or experimental theater. The an¬ cestors of the animated cartoon include all the visual arts, as well as the drama, the short story, and of course the movies, but it exists indepen¬ dently of these and at its best draws no more from them than inspiration. True, Hollywood rarely used the medium for anything other than to get a laugh (although proponents of UPA’s TELL-TALE HEART forget that Harman and Ising made a chillingly effective anti-war film called PEACE ON EARTH that owed nothing to anybody’s short story), but the gift of laughter never proved a handicap to Chaplin, Keaton, Fields, or Preston Sturges, and it didn’t seem to get in the way of Avery, Jones, Freleng, or Clampett either. What can animation do that ordinary film can’t do, besides get a dog to talk? Walt Disney said a lot when he said, “How does a human being react to stimulus? He’s lost the sense of play he once had and he inhibits physical expression. He is the victim of a civilization whose ideal is the unbotherable, poker-faced man and the attractive, unruffled woman. They call it poise.” By its very flamboyance, every aspect of the action in a good ani¬ mated scene shows up those real-life movies for the earthbound dol¬ drums they really are. An animated character seems unwilling to go from the corner of the room to the door without enduring dramatic trans¬ formations of form and texture, undergoing insidious insurrections in all known joints, losing and regaining a generous portion of his clothes, and assuming every split second a new posture more appropriate to some victim of a hard-boiled fit of the ague. He never just walks over, unless the guy at the drawing board has abandoned him. In the carefully ana¬ lyzed action you will find in a good Disney picture, the levels of subtlety and exaggeration, Of exuberance and grace, of action and reaction, of reality and fantasy, merge so harmoniously into a hymn to movement that repeated study in slow motion reveals endless marvels. But all of this, the intricacies and accuracies and hyperboles of a cartoon figure’s movement, means nothing without the spark of charac¬ terization that brings the movies to life. This is what separates a real animator from the day-to-day cartoonist: like some twentieth-century centaur, an animator must be half draftsman and half actor. Bugs Bunny is a case in point. Bugs Bunny does not exist! (Vir¬ ginia notwithstanding.) And if he is going to appear to exist, and engage in conflicts, and maintain an ascending and descending scale of emo¬ tions, and become a box-office attraction and a Hollywood legend, and be referred to in the third person, as “he,” it is going to take the con¬ certed efforts of a lot of talented people to turn him from a concept into a creation. No, Bugs Bunny does not exist. But he lives.\n\n15\n\nGertie and her Children The odyssey of the animation art, for all its obscurity, is a fascinating voyage, past Scylla and Charybdis, through underworlds, around lotus eaters—a journey with all the dramatic potential to inspire somebody to make a really bad movie out of it someday. After the early experimenters fiddled around, after Emile Reynaud, Wallace Carlson, J. Stuart Blackton, Emile Cohl, and several others who may or may not actually be called animators according to some definition or another, the first real giant entered this fledgling arena. It is a matter of more than mild histori¬ cal interest that the D. W. Griffith, the Thomas Ince, the Edwin S. Porter and the Maurice Tourneur of the art of animation were all one person, and did he have his hands full! Winsor McCay was a newspaper car¬ toonist whose elaborate, detailed drawing style was in no way suited to the sharp, clear lines demanded by conventional animation. However, as there was no conventional animation at the time, McCay didn’t let this bother him. When he came out with the five-minute GERTIE THE DINOSAUR in 1914, he created the first major animated cartoon. It had one major drawback, however, in that it made no sense without its creator there to explain it. This rather hampered its success as a box office attraction in the nickelodeons. When played in its intended form as a vaudeville act, however, with Gertie seemingly responding to every remark of her trainer McCay (“Never mind the elephant, Gertie.” Gertie hurls the elephant into the lake. “That wasn’t nice, Gertie.”), it was a smash. The precocity of this ambitious enterprise, in all its ramifications, is stupefying. It took 10,000 drawings to make Gertie go through her act. (And this was before the bright idea of drawing the characters on trans¬ parent cels, to be laid over permanent backgrounds, so McCay was laboriously tracing the same background on every one of his drawings.) Making 10,000 elaborate drawings sounds like an impossible task, but not nearly so impossible as it actually is! I wish I had a nickel for every film teacher who has told me he wished he had a nickel for every student who came up to him all dewy-eyed and said, “I want to make an ani¬ mated film. Oh, I know it’s hard work, but I want to do it. I’ll stay up late at night.” The poor student inevitably wilts before his time is half up and before his first scene is completed, the point at which the total 16\n\n17\n\nimpracticality of going any further, the overwhelming impossibility of the entire enterprise, and the general insanity of animation, in toto, de¬ feats him, and he takes the easy way out and makes a documentary. McCay’s achievement was both momentous and monumental, and his lumbering dinosaur first stunned, then mobilized an entire generation of animators, making Gertie the most successful reptilian proselytizer in any known art form. The fascination of moving drawings held hun¬ dreds of men spellbound enough to risk starvation, and most of them spellbound enough to endure it. Winsor McCay was the undisputed king of animation for twenty years, but he ruled over a troubled and plague-ridden kingdom. From 1910 till the breaking of the soundtrack barrier, one cartoon studio after another poked its way out of its inceptive egg, flapped and fluttered its hesitant wings, made one mighty swoop through the air, and buried its beak in the gravel forever. Animation started out, with GERTIE THE DINOSAUR, as a sideshow attraction, and for twenty years worked its way steadily downward. The pioneer animators were a hardy troupe, but most of them had McCay’s dedication without his talent, and McCay’s masochism without the entrepreneurial finesse to bring it off. Cartoons were made, one after another, on skimpy budgets, and were never able to command much of a devoted following. They might have attracted a wider audience if they had been somewhat more handsomely produced, but their budgets couldn’t be raised until they had attracted a wider audience. The finan¬ ciers of these operations were caught in a bind in which they were the victims of catch-as-catch-can distribution practices, hostile theater own¬ ers, and, finally, audiences who weren’t particularly amused. Producers were lucky to receive for their films what it had cost to make them. Dis¬ tributors, stuck with these things, gave them away with the features. Theater owners, with the cartoons plopped in their lap, often didn’t bother to run them. Audiences, having to sit through them, moaned audibly. And to glance at the cartoons of the teens and twenties is to explain everything. They were turned out weekly by a jolly team of animators who drew what they pleased based on a tenuous version of a “plot out¬ line” (i.e., Mutt and Jeff are painters this week). An onslaught of silly gags would follow, cleansed of all timing, pacing, or any form of comic logic. Each animator simply made everything up as he went along as if doodling his own comic strip, and then at the end of the week all the drawings were collected and photographed frame by frame, according to exposure instructions scribbled in the corner of the page. When the film was finished, it was considered very funny by the men who had spent the last week drawing it. And by no one else. Out would go these reels of film, to play to theater patrons who usually responded by being annoyed or confused. In this way, the early cartoons were among the first films whose chief object in life was to amuse their creators—a very expensive form of recreation later to be rivaled by home movies and the under¬ ground.\n\n18\n\nAnimated cartoons became primarily a medium to suit comic-strip characters who wanted to overextend themselves. They were a rich man’s comic strip in the same way that feature pictures were a poor man’s theater. The silver screen opened its arms to established characters like Maggie and Jiggs, Krazy Kat, Happy Hooligan, the Toonerville Trolley Folks, Jerry on the Job, and the Katzenjammer Kids. Mutt and Jeff, like Sarah Bernhardt, achieved their immortality. Krazy Kat hit the screen with the slogan “Envy me, Mice, I’m going into pictures,” but the mice signed contracts with Paul Terry and seemed to envy nobody. William Randolph Hearst financed an entire animation studio and ran it at a loss, just for the publicity value he could give his syndicated comic strips. (If you intended to lose money on your cartoon studio, you were home free.) From those animated characters not derived from the weekday fun¬ nies, the true cartoon began to evolve. Felix the Cat made some scant money for his creator, Pat Sullivan, but only by making Felix the Cat dolls and handkerchiefs marketable, and then only in Great Britain. Paul Terry got started early and established a recurrent character in Farmer Alfalfa, though this guy never turned out to be much more than a straight man for a lot of mice (if one can imagine a more degrading oc¬ cupation). The Fleischer brothers. Max and Dave, scored a considerable success with Koko the Clown and the “Out of the Inkwell” idea as early as 1915, and by the late 1920s were regularly disbursing dazzling dis¬ plays of their medium’s ever-expanding capacity for extorting wonder¬ ment. Interestingly enough, Koko the Clown was probably the only car¬ toon character in the history of the medium who really did exist. Through an odd device called the Rotoscope, the Fleischers were able to make their animation more lifelike, and at the same time com¬ bine cartoon characters with live action figures within the frame. It was chiefly the act of bringing things slightly down to earth that earned them their success (and, paradoxically, made their films cheaper to produce). The Rotoscope combined a film projector with a drawing board, making it possible to film an action with real people, then trace it, frame for frame, with pen and ink. Koko the Clown was simply a cartoon rendition of Dave Fleischer in a clown suit. Then, when the projector-plus-drawing board apparatus was combined with a camera, it was no problem to com¬ bine the cartoon drawings with a live-action accompaniment that was re¬ photographed under the drawings. For the entire duration of the longrunning “Out of the Inkwell” series, the older brother Max played the real-life cartoonist, while the younger brother Dave played his cartoon character. Audiences were at least able to make a granule of sense out of this arrangement. The Rotoscope outlived the inkwell and the clown. Eventually it was discovered that you could photograph a person prancing about in some peculiar fashion and magically transform him into any old thing. The movement of the dancing ghouls in the “Night on Bald Mountain” sequence of FANTASIA is Rotoscoped movement, but it was human men who acted out the required gyrations, while animators, Circe-like,\n\n20\n\n21\n\nmade them into monsters. Professional dancers provided the original footage for the “Dance of the Hours” segment, probably doing their best to forget that animators were going to spend months turning them into ostriches and hippopotami. The Rotoscope became a prime tool for re¬ inforcing the tenuous bridge between reality and a world of sheer imag¬ ination. Another technique that blossomed in the rocky soil of the twenties was the use of the in-betweener. It was practicality that hastened his ex¬ istence, and his task was a mighty lowly one, but he helped advance the art toward its most creative stages. It is simple fact that in an animated movement of twelve drawings, it is only the key drawings—say, draw¬ ings one, six and twelve—that determine the character and the nature of the movement. All the others are mostly filler. The animator does only the key drawings, and then turns them over to his underpaid flunky as¬ sistant to complete the action. This developed, in the more sophisticated animation studios of subsequent decades, into an imposing hierarchy of animators, assistant animators, in-betweeners, breakdown men, and cleanup men, and even—for those who went whole hog, like Disney—a separation between character animators and effects animators (to do splashes and wisps of smoke). Though the final result seems to be the reduction of the animator to one solitary post on an assembly line, the intended and usually effected outcome was to allow the creative aspect of animation to be separated from the mountainous drudgery. Even in these days of film societies and film archives, animation of the silent era is rarely in evidence. Perhaps it’s just as well. The deficien¬ cies of silent cartoons are weighty and depressing compared to the fancy flights of Walt Disney in the first decade of sound. Walt Disney did his first animating in the Midwest in a ratty ad¬ vertising outfit called the Kansas City Film Ad Company, which was also the starting point for his brother, Roy Disney; his musician, Carl Stal¬ ling; his first key animator, Ub Iwerks; the first directors of Warner Brothers cartoons, Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising; and the eventual nexus of the Warner organization, Friz Freleng. Among others. (There may be some reason why so many of the major names of animation emerged from this wholly forgettable flea-pit organization. Or it may be, like any resemblance to actual persons living or dead, purely a coinci¬ dence.) When Disney scored a smash with STEAMBOAT WILLIE, the first sound cartoon, it was against the shrewd business judgment of those who knew better. But the combination of sound and animation had al¬ ready proved itself irresistible at every transitory appearance it had gotten a chance to make. McCay’s GERTIE presentation had achieved this effect. A Mutt and Jeff entry entitled SOUND YOUR A caused a mild sensation with a conversation between Mutt, Jeff and the drummer in the orchestra in which the drummer got up and spoke and Mutt answered back in balloons. And when the first of the Bouncing Ball cartoons hit the screen in 1925, uniting moving images with the trilling of the audience, it got everybody so riled up that they wouldn’t sit still\n\n22\n\nfor the feature till they’d had a chance to go back and sing along again. (Years of ridicule and an unsuccessful attempt at revival have obscured the original popularity of the Fleischers’ Bouncing Ball series of the twenties.) The addition of sound turned animation into something more than moving drawing. It now had a measure of magic heretofore denied to it. A new outpost of reality was established. Disney capitalized on color as well as sound. He was not the first to make color cartoons, but he quickly secured the exclusive animation rights to Technicolor’s three-color process, and suddenly his Silly Sym¬ phonies looked remarkably better than anybody else’s color cartoons. Disney was privy to all the colors in God’s original spectrum, while any¬ body else in the business was stuck with orange and green, and varia¬ tions thereof (light orange, dark green). But Disney’s accomplishments were more than technical. He was the first in the nascent, uncertain art form to wage an all-out confronta¬ tion with the study of motion. His analysis of the real principles of mo¬ mentum and inertia, and his stylized adaptation of them to the realm of animation, elevated the movement in his films to previously unknown heights, and made it an element worth watching for its own sake. And, hand in hand with movement, came its Bobsey twin, the prob¬ lem of characterization. Disney was the first to face the problem of mov¬ ing each character in a way distinct enough to set him apart from any other character. When he made his own version of THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE it abounded not in stale, convenient jokes about run¬ ning, but in comic routines derived from the contrasting personalities of the two main characters. Perplexingly, the cartoon characters in the silent days were all puppets. The characters in Disney’s Silly Symphonies had the breath of life imparted to them. The whole animation industry, in fact, had new life after the ad¬ vent of Disney’s innovations. The animators who worked under him were suffused with an enthusiasm for their work and a sense of pride in their craft they had never known before. The established firms that had to compete with him were forced into an imitation of his care and per¬ fectionism. Disney kept his company running through the spare years of the Depression and managed to accomplish what devoted cartoon stu¬ dios had always tried for and never achieved. He reinvested all income to improve his films, rather than going home with a profit in his pocket. He gained control of his own distribution to foil the pirates and the prof¬ iteers. There were other cartoon studios in the thirties. Harman and Ising aped the Silly Symphonies with Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies for Warner Brothers, then switched over to Happy Harmonies at MGM (everybody apparently being firmly convinced that you weren’t a real Disney imitator until you’d copied the idea for his series title). Krazy Kat survived at Columbia for some time into the decade, though by this time he was neither Krazy nor Kat. The Fleischer brothers bought the rights to a comic-strip character named Popeye and enjoyed a fair amount of success. (And if anyone can think of a less promising idea for\n\n23\n\na cartoon character than a wizened old one-eyed sailor, I should like to hear about it.) But for an entire decade Disney eclipsed all other activity in the medium, and by the early forties was presumptuous enough to have several features in production at one time. The cuteness for which Disney is often taken to task sits, like Griffith’s Victorian sentimentality, at the basis of an overwhelming imagination, a precision sense of craft, a dynamic personality, and a filmmaking genius. When the emotion is genuine and talent is at its peak, as in BAMBI and FANTASIA, the result is absolutely brilliant. When neither of these conditions hold, as in 'PETER PAN and CINDER¬ ELLA, the result, as critics today are fond of reminding us, is appalling. Since the 1950s, Disney’s name has been inseparably wedded to a treacly concept called “family entertainment,” and that curse is not very easy to shake. Increasingly, animation at the Disney Studio became a matter in which craftsmanship replaced the artistry and excellence replaced the excitement. With the financial setbacks induced by the war, and the move to a sterile new studio in Burbank, an atmosphere of resentment consumed the love and devotion that had once been rampant, and the organization wound its inevitable way from an isolated congregation of devotees into a pretty ordinary bureaucracy. Many of the most talented people left, and Disney’s competitors found new sources of strength. Animators he had spent tons of money to train went on and did their best work for somebody else. There was now a managerial and pop¬ ular acceptance that made the production of cartoons a less chancy, if never a surefire, venture. A pattern was set in which good comedy, good animation and clever visual effects were expected and usually delivered. Eventually, Hanna and Barbera set the scene for doomsday with their television-aimed computer animation (HUCKLEBERRY HOUND was the first, in 1959). Great cartoons with care put into them became his¬ tory, like everything else with care put into it. But for twenty years be¬ fore that Disney’s short-subject rivals ran riot in the trails he had blazed.\n\n26\n\nMethods and Madness Many’s the time that a friend or acquaintance has come up to me and said, “But, Joe! What does a cartoon director do? Does he say, ‘All right, Bugs, let’s take it again from the top'? Ha ha ha ha ha.” I try to associate as little as possible with these people. The truth is that the men who made the drawings and the men who wrote the stories were all taking orders from a single guiding intelligence who was, in effect, the sole creator of these films to a greater extent than can be said of the directors of any other branch of filmmaking. The action in an animated cartoon is so completely under the direc¬ tor’s control that it becomes a medium in which the filmmaker’s imagina¬ tion not only can run absolutely riot, but genuinely has to, if his films are going to rise to the expectations of the art. The cartoon director is granted a level of freedom that extends in all directions in every dimen¬ sion in every frame—his territory ranges from fixing the dramatic con¬ flict to determining how the trees are going to look. But, like any free¬ dom, the freedom of the animation medium brings with it its own responsibility. The stylization, the exaggeration, the free-wheeling disre¬ gard for earthly reality, are all liberating enough for a scene or two, but it’s a thrill that can wear out pretty quickly, unless it’s given a steady guidance beyond the momentary. The liberation is inherent in the medium; the control is up to the in¬ dividual director. Most of them, of course, settle for the comfortable rut of the talking cats and mice, and the casual walking on air that comes to a halt when the character realizes the ground is gone. But the better directors don’t let unreality get off so easy. Each one of them, when he puts his mind to the task, manages to come up with a separate set of physical laws and behavioral properties that constitute his own world. Chuck Jones’ Coyote can fall five miles from a precipice and still be alive when he gets to the bottom. Tex Avery’s Wolf could probably endure such a fall, but he is more likely to develop brakes on the way down. It is the creation of the director’s own universe, and the maintaining of that universe, that makes animation a medium capable of individual, per¬ sonal expression, and what allows us to tell one animation director from another, even when some wiseguy has taken the credits off the film. In a good live-action film, one feels the presence of the director in 27\n\nevery frame. In even the most unremarkable animated cartoon of the 1940s and 1950s, the director has dictated the contents of every frame on a complicated chart, supervised the preparation of each, and com¬ pletely re-vamped any that didn’t meet his approval. In a good cartoon, the action is so meticulously worked out that the levels of expression are infinite. The methods by which the director achieved this control had mostly been developed since the days of the silent cartoon—the days when there usually was no director, and no guiding intelligence. They derived chiefly from the practical fact that all elements of an animated cartoon must be mapped out to a fraction of a second before anyone even considers the notion of putting film in the camera. Animation is probably the only known form of movie-making in which the actual employment of movie film can safely be classed as post-production work. First came the storyboard. The idea of paying separate individuals to do nothing but think up gags and stories and waste endless hours tin¬ kering with structure would have seemed like wastrel foolishness to the pinch-penny practitioners of the pre-Disney sub-subsistence animation economics. And it was of paramount importance that when story plan¬ ning did become a widespread habit, it took the form of hundreds of drawings, rather than a neatly typewritten script, so that story and gag construction were conceived and worked out with an eye for visual de¬ tail that would cover all contingencies. With all the drawings posted on a board, in sequence, it was possible to see the characters and their situa¬ tions interacting and resolving themselves before any actual animation was done. With the autonomy often granted to directors at the better car¬ toon studios, they had enough control over their material to wholly reject a finished storyboard, or to totally revise a satisfactory board in accor¬ dance with personal notions of the human comedy. But it was after the storyboard that the healthiest supplies of crea¬ tivity were demanded. The movement, the character expression, the whole tone of the film was to be determined by the rhythm and frequency of the drawings. And the precise number of drawings, and the length of time and degree of importance granted to each—all of this was deter¬ mined by the director on a complicated piece of paper called an exposure sheet. In Mickey Mouse’s time, it was done in a slightly different format on a bar sheet, and the chart’s necessity seemed determined only by the problems of synchronizing action with music, but the essence was gen¬ erally the same. The director needed some way to line up every note of music, every syllable of uttered verbiage, and every nuance of physical action; to tell the animators, frame for frame, what he wanted them to do. The timing, so crucial to animation and so essential to good comedy, needed to be fully worked out on paper. But even with this wholesale, programmed, before-the-fact calcula¬ tion, some room had to be made for error, some way had to be cleared to give the animator a rehearsal space. And this was the function of the pencil test. All the pencil test consisted of was the proper photography, according to the exposure sheet, of the animator’s drawings as they came\n\n28\n\noff his drawing board, before being traced onto transparent cels and painted in the proper colors. This gave everybody a chance to see the completed sequence as animation (and not as a series of drawings) be¬ fore the commitment to full and expensive production was made. In the heyday of theatrical animation, when they were working under tight bud¬ gets that today look like money to burn, it was customary to go back and change fifteen to thirty percent of the work after the pencil test had re¬ vealed its deficiencies. Again, the problem of hiring a separate man and a separate camera just to photograph pencil drawings all day seems like an expenditure vastly unjustified by this complicated mechanical pro¬ cess. But when quality and fidelity to a personal vision seem worth fight¬ ing for, the pencil test serves a necessary purpose for the perfection of smooth animation and successful comedy. The peculiar thing about it is that every one of the techniques en¬ abling the animation director to assume his place as the artistic center of his film was developed during the thirties at the Walt Disney Studios— the same studio which soon became notorious for never allowing a direc¬ tor to take any control. It was fully impossible to be a director, in the complete, dictatorial sense of the word, at a studio where every move anybody made was supervised and criticized by the man who became a legend.\n\nPersonal expression was less to Disney’s liking than analysis, re¬\n\nfinement and purification; and, in the end, he was the guiding intelli¬ gence behind everything that came out with his name on it. But it was Disney who paved the way for the brave men who followed, the he-man directors who shouldered the abundance of intricacies, responsibilities and metamorphoses this imposing medium demanded, and tasted of the joys of its flexibility and its range—Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, and, of course. His Satanic Majesty, Tex Avery.\n\n29\n\n2. RED-HOT RIDING HOOD MEETS THE300-LB. CANARY\n\nDaydreams No artist, in any century, on any continent, in any medium, has ever suc¬ ceeded in creating his own universe as thoroughly and overwhelmingly as Tex Avery. The action in his cartoons is not representational action, nor is it the kind of action one expects from an animated cartoon. Avery’s films will roll along harmlessly enough, with an interesting situa¬ tion treated in a more or less funny way. Then, all of a sudden, one of the characters will lose a leg. And hop all over the place trying to find it again. Or one guy will take off the other guy’s head and toss it out the window. Or his nose will jump off and run away. Or three characters will sprout where once there was one, and dance all over the frame in a frenzy. In SLAP-HAPPY LION, a kangaroo hops into its own pocket and disappears. In BILLY BOY a goat is rocketed to the moon and eats it. In NORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE, a fugitive wolf reaches\n\nSix heads to indicate horror in HAPPY-GO-NUTTY (1944).\n\n33\n\nA couple of Avery pretzels: LITTLE RURAL RIDING HOOD (1949).\n\n34\n\nhis hideout in the wilderness, slams eight different doors into the same doorway, then turns around and, without uttering a gasp, drops his jaw to the floor with a thud. In HOMESTEADER DROOPY, a pistol gets wounded in the midst of a gun battle, and its owner must send a bullet through it to put it out of its misery. In SENOR DROOPY a matador extends his cape for a charging bull, and the bull charges right into it and out of the third dimension. The matador plainly ex¬ hibits both sides of the cape to prove that the bull isn’t hiding up his sleeve. Then, from under the cape, he produces a small egg. When he hatches the life-size bull out of the robin-size egg, a roar goes up from the crowd, and the bull is suitably outraged. There are times when one feels sorry for Avery’s characters, for all the beatings, smashings, pulverizings, contortions, inflations and diminutions they are forced to undergo. But eventually one learns to nurture a high regard—even awe—for these beings who brave such punishment as this and live to tell about it. And they live, there’s no doubt about it. They may be chopped in half, beheaded, fragmented, burned to cinders, disemboweled, turned inside out or twisted into pretzels, but they are restored to normalcy within seconds, and maintain a vigorous vitality through it all. After the most horrendous and total demolition they are capable of leaping into action again at four frames’ notice. No other cartoon director has ever asked so much of his charac¬ ters; but then, no other director has ever allotted them such endless elasticity. Avery’s boneless, bloodless creatures seem to consist of some indefinable substance which allows them a physical liberty bordering on license. It is certainly not flesh or fur. but neither is it plastic or putty. Sometimes it bends in highly improbable places. Sometimes, when punctured, it deflates. Sometimes it stretches for miles. Sometimes it can be jammed into a container many times too small for it. Some¬ times, when hit too hard, it shatters and must be pasted together again offscreen. What is this miracle material of a thousand lives? We might call it Averex, and perhaps if we keep demanding it at our hardware stores and hobby shops they will put it on the market for us. Avery’s visual style has a multitude of associations, connected as it is with those he influenced as well as those he was influenced by. It appears today as a composite of the oblong blobs of Don Martin, the comic derangement of Virgil Partch and the bloodcurdling viciousness of Gahan Wilson. The violence in Avery's films comes in heavy, ba¬ roque doses, but it is an unobjectionable, distracted form of violence that is all joy and no pain. So long as all the bodily parts keep restoring themselves, like Prometheus’ liver, there is less a sense of destruction than of exhilaration. Avery has not only the daring and imagination to pull such outrageous gags, but the animation skill, the directorial finesse, the filmic logic and the comic sense to put them over so they are shocking and funny instead of just weird. And Avery’s cartoons are funny. If I have taken this long to get to that point it is because it goes without saying once you have seen a few. Some of them seem a little overdone, some of them are disappoint35\n\nBLITZ WOLF: No¬ body does anything in a small way in an Avery cartoon.\n\ning, some are repetitious, and some are so loud and brassy it’s annoy¬ ing, but they are all funny. Every one contains at least one parcel of comic genius, and often there are so many it’s uncanny. Avery can cram more things into seven minutes than most filmmakers get into an hour. His better films are hilarious and the best of the bunch are as funny as anything ever put on the screen. Avery’s sense of comedy presides over all the timing, delivery, sound effects, movement, mood, story construction, character development—over every minuscule step of the way from inception to execution, so that everything’s funny, even things that have no right to be funny. For instance: The gag in THE SHOOTING OF DAN McGOO where a man described as having “one foot in the grave” hobbles into the room with an entire plot of ground, an erected tombstone and a decorative tulip all cumbersomely attached to the end of his right leg. (In the next shot, of course, he is not described as having one foot in the grave and the plot of ground is not there.) The hombre sidles up to the bar and calls, “The drinks are on the house!” At which point everybody in the place dashes straight outside, hurries up the fire escape and stands around on the roof having drinks in the snow. The crux of this is not so much the particular gags, which are almost obvious, and sound like something you or I could have come up with at a party, but the brazen vividness of the presentation. With such enthusiasm this moron comes loping, CLUNK! CLUNK! into the bar, dragging this grave on his foot, and for what reason we’ll never guess. In accordance with all the standards of good comedy, the laughs are prompted just as much by the character’s reaction and attitude as by the action itself. The same goes for the utter joy of the barflies as they dash, to a man, out¬ side for their drinks, and the total silliness of their wanting to stand in the cold snow just to make it worth the first man’s while to have said his line. Or the gag in HOUSE OF TOMORROW, where it is finally revealed to all the world how that light goes off when you shut the refrigerator door. Just as you thought, a little man runs out and shuts it off. Again, this is the kind of gag you might expect your nephew to run up and tell you. And again, the genius of its execution is absolute. It’s a little gnome, with a funny hat and a beard that reaches to his toes, who toddles out of a little door (where you must surmise that he lives) and heads for the little lightswitch. He is just taller than a lump of butter but not quite so high as a pint of milk. Perhaps just the size of a good round egg. And he toddles past the groceries and back into his house. All the interesting little sidelights of an everyday absurdity are examined, worked out and paraded on the screen in front of us. An essential feature of Avery’s juggling with the laws of physics is that, like all things in the cinema, it was done before. In the ancestral twenties it was nothing for animated Mutt or animated Jeff to misplace his head and hardly notice. And Felix the Cat’s passion for detaching his tail and using it as a baseball bat was matched only by his fondness\n\n38\n\nOr the one about the fellow who checked the boxing gloves for horseshoes and uncovered a thoroughbred horse,LONESOME LENNY (1946).\n\nfor question marks and exclamation points as convenient props. Avery admits the similarity, but the difference constitutes a world. One is not surprised by such actions when they are carried on by spare little black and white drawings who speak in balloons and whose only audio im¬ pact is created by a convivial organist biding his time till the feature starts. One is simply not convinced of their presence. It was Disney who sounded the death knell for such loosely knit panegyrics in the interest of a more convincing set of realities. Once the new realities were established, and color and sound united to make the action con¬ vincing, the way was clear for Avery to introduce the absurdities again, this time into a whole new context. He does not abandon the reality of the self-contained cartoon world, he just extends the limits of reality beyond the bounds of credibility. His action is convincing. His cats and dogs prance around inside a definite physical dimension, and when their eyes roll out, or their teeth crumble, or their feet get punctured and shrivel to a shred, there is just no question but that this is really hap¬ pening up there. Though nothing is right, everything opposes contra¬ diction. He doesn’t ask you to believe it, you can’t help but believe it. This is a style that approaches surrealism, but deceptively. It ob¬ viously is not reality, but neither is it wholly illogical. Avery’s cartoons usually proceed in clear, Aristotelian fashion from first principles that are preposterous. Nor can this be fantasy, since the ruthless, boisterous nature of his humor is a far cry from the piddling sort of Peter Pan nonsense we associate with that word. Rarely does Avery address him¬ self to a sea of childish faces. There’s never a “let’s pretend” or a “make-believe” atmosphere to his cartoons. It’s always “This is it!” One cannot label his special brand of reality very conveniently. It is a unique and individual set of factors and circumstances that exists nowhere else on Earth or Venus. The biggest clue you will find, in fact, to the origin of the state of Tex Avery’s humor is the humor of the state of Tex Avery’s origin. It was Texas that gave birth to the most widespread and influential form of American folk humor, the tall tale. Look closely at these straight-faced stories of the ranch that was so big they used the state of New Mexico for a grazing pasture, or the man who dug the Rio Grande for himself because he was thirsty, or the bronco who bucked off a saddle so hard it landed in the middle of the week after next. Listen hard to these legends that provide their own parody and you will know where a man gets the nerve to come up with a gag like the one about the stubborn dog out to block up gopher holes as fast as they can be burrowed, until he has a paw over each of them, and still they are being dug, until there are eleven holes all over the yard, and damned if the old dog doesn’t come up with eleven paws to cover them all (GARDEN GOPHER). Or the one about the Western badman demonstrating his shooting prowess by blasting one little fly on one little hill on one distant cliff on the horizon—a hill so far away that he can only hear the echo of the insect’s scream reverberating through the neighboring canyons (DR AG ALONG DROOPY). Avery has the power of every great humorist, from Aristophanes 40\n\nto Woody Allen, to take a serious matter and keep blowing it up out of all proportion until its gravity begins to shrivel. Chaplin has said it is one of the great godsends to the sanity of the human race that if you exaggerate any hardship far enough it becomes funny. Avery, in his Rabelaisian zest for zaniness, exaggerates just about everything, and far enough to be hilarious. It’s not easy, to find a moral or a polit¬ ical point of view in films that are made up out of sheer comedic virtuosity. The only slant you will find him giving a subject is the ageold slant of the comic perspective: the idea that once you have been coaxed into laughing yourself silly at a serious concern, you will begin to see the real absurdity in taking it so seriously in the first place. It is the artist as magician, as visionary, as conjurer of unknown kingdoms, as creator of a new reality that is strongest in Avery: the expressionistic revelation of the inner self that characterizes von Stern¬ berg, Mumau, Fellini and Welles—along with Heller, Joyce, Barthelme and Tolkien. Avery’s personal form of madness made filmic adds a new dimension to the terrain of the film medium. Dimension Praecox.\n\n41\n\nTunes and Melodies It took Avery a long time to reach this pinnacle of omnipotence in his own distended universe, but it didn’t take him long to make funny cartoons. His first films were made for Warner Brothers in 1935 at Leon Schlesinger’s studio, and consisted of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies at a time when there was a difference between Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies. It must be said that the Looney Tunes, made in black and white with a different rationale and starring a primitive ver¬ sion of Porky Pig, gave him greater opportunities to develop a gag style than did the Merrie Melodies, which were mostly second-string imitations of the Silly Symphonies. When one is aware of the Herculean comedy Avery is capable of, it’s rather painful to watch the few good gags in the early Merrie Melodies, like I ONLY HAVE EYES FOR YOU, I LOVE TO SINGA and A SUNBONNET BLUE, battling against a storybook world of make-believe that is reminiscent more of something regressive than of something fun. The childish atmosphere of a thing like DON’T LOOK NOW, which asks us to get interested in a rivalry between Dan Cupid and an unbecoming sprite hoping to represent the babyhood of Beelzebub, makes its adult gags (the devil ruining a wedding ceremony by paying two kids to run in and yell, “Stop, Daddy!” right in the middle) look rather peculiar, and the com¬ bination only gives cause to stop and wonder which audience Avery thought he was aiming at. The free and eccentric nature of the Looney Tunes left room for more experimenting. There are some great moments, like the one in PORKY THE RAIN MAKER where one of Porky's barnyard geese waddles up, finds a “cyclone pill” lying on the ground, pecks at it uncomprehending, swallows it and is instantly hurled by his insides to all corners of the frame, at the conclusion of which he is startled enough to speak English and exclaim, \"Well! Imagine that!\" in a ster¬ ling tenor. In MILK AND MONEY the mortgage on the farm is being foreclosed by a Mr. Viper, a villain villainous enough to be identified as The Snake, who slithers his serpentine way back to his carriage, coils around the separate spokes of the wheel, describes an arc into the driver’s seat and takes off (a sublime piece of animation by Chuck Jones). Viper is vanquished in the final footage as Porky arrives with 42\n\nA barely recognizable Porky Pig (before a streamlining process gave him a new image) hanging around in the arms of his father.

(Nobody is anybody in an Avery cartoon until he can drive a car that’s two miles long.) Avery’s Warner cartoons are all amusing, but in general they are too tame in tone to engender much enthusiasm. Even when a burst of wild invention appears, like the silenced cuckoo in AIN’T WE GOT FUN who quietly produces a pocket watch which he shows around, it is marred by a slow, deliberate pacing that stretches things out too evenly for any momentum to be gathered. This is partly a result of the economy that had to be observed, whereby every drawing was milked for all the footage it was worth, every position was held for at least two seconds, and any actions that couldn’t be repeated till they grew stale and flaked away were better left undone. And you can just bet that all your favorite gags in any one Warner cartoon will be certain to pop up again in the next one. One of Avery’s Merrie Melodies is called OF FOX AND HOUNDS, and it is funny enough, but it’s not much more than the same gag repeated three times. Three times!\n\nWACKY WILD LIFE (1940). Also injurious to the overall effect are the double takes these in¬ credulous characters insist on doing to overemphasize all the good gags. The creation of an absurd universe is not quite possible so long as its characters continue to be stunned at every infraction of the rules of physics. Nor is it facilitated by inconsistencies developed inside the in¬ sanities. CIRCUS TODAY, for instance, features an act called the Flying Cadenzas, who proceed to flap their arms and fly to their respec¬ tive trapezes. Once there, a slipup sends a Cadenza hurtling to the saw¬ dust offscreen, leaving his brother to advertise for a replacement. One or 44\n\nGratuitous insanity in THE PENGUIN PARADE (1938). 45\n\nFor no particular reason, Egghead was a recurring character at this point in time. He is seen here tipping his head in CINDERELLA MEETS FELLA (1938). 46\n\nthe other of these gags is fine. The two of them in conjunction only can¬ cel each other out. This is the sort of trouble a man is just asking for when he refuses to abide by the laws of the universe he was born in. All that can be said of his Warner cartoons is that the best of them are consistently funny. Avery was soon to pass beyond that. Avery’s as¬ sociates at Warner’s recall that he was capable of acting out hilarious activities for his imaginary characters to imitate, but that the humor was easy to lose in the process of animation. Clearly, an approach would have to be uncovered that was suitable both to a prodigious comic mind and an extremely technical art form. But in his brighter flashes of novice inspiration he gave us glimpses of the havoc to come. THE PENGUIN PARADE, for instance, handles its swing music with a lively spirit, and it seems perfectly appropriate when a pleasant three-part harmony on “When My Dreamboat Comes Home” is abruptly cut off, for the duration of one beat, to allow the trio time to make gro¬ tesque faces at the audience. An announcer penguin comes on stage to tuuf\n\nn2-4-\n\nModel sheet for PORKY THE WRESTLER (courtesy of Bob Clampett).\n\n47\n\nintroduce a song-and-dance number in a magnificent speech that lasts a full minute in single shot, and it takes you nearly half that time to ascer¬ tain that he isn’t making a fragment of sense, except for an intelligible “Leon Schlesinger” stuck in the midst of the double-talk. In HAMATEUR NIGHT, a conductor stands up before his five-piece band to com¬ mence the overture, and suddenly he’s a one-man band and they five conductors. The curtain, rather than rising on the first act, just falls down on the stage. In DANGEROUS DAN McFOO (a comic rendition of Robert W. Service’s poem, “The Shooting of Dan McGrew”) Avery refreshingly provides no rational reason why the first round of a fist fight in a Yukon saloon should prompt a trolley car to storm through the swinging doors and clang its bell. Just as irrationally, the tough guy is not given a rubdown between rounds, but a shave and a haircut. Technical finesse and a respectful treatment afforded to serious mo¬ ments set off the comedy in THUGS WITH DIRTY MUGS, a neat parody on the gangster cycle, with quick cuts, interesting camera angles, and a sense of real authority to its series of ridiculous jokes. Killer Diller is shown systematically looting every bank in town, from the First Na¬ tional Bank to the Worst National Bank, in a succession of taut, brisk scenes which appear, montage fashion, to cover several months, until the ominous headline appears on the stands, “87 Banks Robbed Today.” Killer is a caricature of Edward G. Robinson, but he can also do an im¬ personation of Fred Allen, so he stands up and does one. The biggest heist provides the highest tension as the circle of Killer’s flashlight closes in on a safe in the dead of night. Killer is not fazed for an instant when the safe turns out to be a radio. He and his henchmen flop to the floor to listen to the “Lone Ranger Show” and are apprehended right in the mid¬ dle of the Ovaltine commercial. Technical finesse and the impressive handling of a serious moment also come to the rescue of CROSS COUNTRY DETOURS. (Perhaps the best of a bunch of travelogue and documentary parodies that Avery started with THE ISLE OF P1NGO-PONGO in 1938, and followed with A DAY AT THE ZOO, BELIEVE IT OR ELSE. DETOURING AMERICA, WACKY WILD LIFE, CEILING HERO and AVIA¬ TION VACATION. These films attempt to be more laughable than the short subjects they are making fun of, and a few of them actually suc¬ ceed.) A great job of dramatic animation underlines a stalking bobcat, while a narrator bewails the fate of the innocent baby quail about to be his prey. The intense drama shatters when the bobcat suddenly breaks down, pounds the ground with his fist, and admits between sobs that he hasn’t got the heart to go through with it. PORKY THE WRESTLER contains the first fully sustained come¬ dic elaboration of a surreal idea in an Avery cartoon, and seems to mark the first full-blooded unleashing of the Avery spirit into the cartoon world. Porky’s opponent in the ring swallows a pipe and begins chugging around like a train; Porky and the referee, trying to stay out of his path, end up following him around like railroad cars, and a succession of train gags follow: the bell is set up in one corner and begins clanging like a crossing signal, the water cooler rocks back and forth on a previously 48\n\nAn animation drawing from PORKY'S DUCK HUNT (1937) (courtesy of Bob Clampett).\n\nAll the model sheet there was for PORKY'S DUCK HUNT, done by Tex Avery himself (courtesy of Bob Clampett).\n\n49\n\nsteady floor, and one member of the audience looks out the window, and, seeing scenery go by, realizes he’s missed his stop(!) and runs out clutch¬ ing his suitcase. Pleasing as many of these are, there are only two Warner films, out of sixty made in six years, that are worthy of the name Tex Avery. One is PORKY’S DUCK HUNT and the other is A WILD HARE. One gave birth to Daffy Duck and the other spawned Bugs Bunny. One set the tone for all Tex Avery and all Warner Brothers cartoons to follow, and the other created the character that toppled Disney from his unassailable throne. Remarkable achievements, but neither Avery, nor the char¬ acters, nor the studio stopped there. PORKY’S DUCK HUNT, looniest of all Looney Tunes, arrived in the middle of 1937, Avery’s second year of cartoon-making, and it has all the self-assurance of a grand old master. “Be v-v-very, v-v-very, v-v-very q-q-quiet,” Porky tells us, lurking in the lilies. And no sooner does a single stray duck glide into sight than thirty-seven hunters spring up out of the neighboring reeds and fill the air with din and buckshot. And when the smoke clears, onward wings the solitary mallard, uncon¬ cerned. It is then up to one sharp-eyed shooter in the next marsh to bring him down. He aims, fires, and straight to the ground comes one small plane, with horrifying, realistic sound effects and a very confused pilot who sits cowering in his downed aircraft. Porky absently pulls a 180degree switch on the direction of his gun, which allows him to aim sky¬ ward, pull the trigger, and sink himself. Then a gang of trout get drunk and do a beautiful rendition of “Moonlight Bay.” With all this going on, it wouldn’t seem as if the duck had much of a chance to steal the show. And he doesn’t. He isn’t drawn with quite the flair you expect him to be, and his voice isn’t there yet, either. As a con¬ cept for Daffy Duck he’s not much more than germinal. About all that really strikes you about the character is his reaction to the deadly fact of his being the object of a hunt. He doesn’t care. He thinks it’s funny. And his cavalier attitude toward the earnest fellow who is supposed to be hunting him down really is funny. This is seven leagues from anything a cartoon character of the thirties was supposed to be, and just the sort of thing Disney would never let one of his directors try. In his best scene, the screwball duck does nothing more than dance away into the distance, in one long, mad shot—no camera movement, no great dialogue, just “Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Hoo!” and over he goes, hopping on the water, turning handsprings, bouncing on his head, tumbling in the air, sidling on his heel, splashing on the surface, skidding far out of sight, and then swooping back again for another round. A simple idea, but a fantastic shot, one that owes a lot to some graceful and demented anima¬ tion by Bob Clampett. Then, after the plain and predictable final gag, and you’re just in the act of telling yourself you’ve seen a pretty funny cartoon, on comes this maniac again, and sails over the production in¬ formation and the slogan “That’s all, folks” that comprise the end title, swinging on the T, spinning on the apostrophe, sliding on the folks, springing to the Warner Brothers, scooting over the Vitaphone. sallying\n\n50\n\nHARE-UM SCAREUM (1939) by Hardaway and Dalton.\n\nELMER’S CANDID CAMERA (1940) by Chuck Jones.\n\n51\n\nA WILD HARE(1940) by Tex Avery.

You get the same feeling out of A WILD HARE, but in a much calmer way. The breezy insouciance of the main character extends to the character of the whole film. WILD HARE was the fourth in a series of rabbit-hunting pictures, but the first to make such a hit in the theaters that there was cause for alarm, and the one that crystallized Bugs’ per¬ sonality for good (while PORKY’S DUCK HUNT was the first of all the duck cartoons and was instantly successful, though Daffy’s personality wasn’t fully developed until later). PORKY’S HARE HUNT, 1938, and HARE-UM SC ARUM, 1939, starred a fearless rabbit who bolixed up all attempts to murder him, on a design fashioned by Bob Clampett using leftover gags from PORKY’S DUCK HUNT. Both cartoons were directed by Ben Hardaway and Cal Dalton, who managed to misdirect the character so thoroughly that he was more annoying to the audience than he was to his antagonist. (In HARE-UM SCARUM he sings, “I’m so goony, loony tuney, touched in the head/Please pass the ketchup, I think I’ll go to bed.” Seeing a Looney Tune is cited as the cause for his dementia.) The third of the series was directed by Chuck Jones in 1940 and called ELMER’S CANDID CAMERA, and here the rabbit slowed down and became far less aggressive, though just as annoying. The Woody Woodpecker laugh (“Hee-hee-Jmft-hoo, Hee-hee-lw/i-hoo! ”), the Groucho Marx walk, the dopey voice, and the awkward character de53\n\nsign all combine to make him look pretty stupid, but Jones’ film has a tranquil, offhanded atmosphere that’s a distinct relief. Remarkably enough, A WILD HARE, also 1940, depends, point for point, on the same gags that make up ELMER’S CANDID CAM¬ ERA, and, magically, they’re all funnier the second time around. This is one cartoon in which the slow, deliberate pace of the Warner Brothers Averys really pays off, and seems to be exactly what the situation de¬ mands. There are only three or four gags presented, each one fully devel¬ oped into a nice little routine, and they all ripen beautifully. In the nicest of them (a gag pulled hundreds of times since, which hundreds of imitations don’t succeed in showing up) Bugs has Elmer Fudd convinced that he’s shot him, and the throes of his death spasms are so horrifying (screams of “Gettin’ dark! Dark!” and frantic cries of “Don’t leave me!”) that after he twitches to a convulsive conclusion, Fudd is aghast at himself for doing what he intended to do all along, and runs in terror to a tree, collapsing against it, sobbing, “I killed him! I’m a wabbit killer! I killed the cute little bunny wabbit!” Behind him, as he wails on, the cute little bunny wabbit stealthily approaches, cautiously folds back the flap of Fudd’s jacket, exposing him, then lets fly with a hefty boot. And just when you’re ready for Elmer to fall down, or jam his little red nose in the tree trunk, he sails, grandly, up the entire length of this mighty timber, meets a branch with a resounding gong, and comes smoothly and precipitously to his knees at the rabbit’s feet. Avery directed three more Bugs Bunnies while he was at Schlesinger’s: THE HECKLING HARE, TORTOISE BEATS HARE, and ALL THIS AND RABBIT STEW. Each one is marked with the solid, steady, self-assured rhythm of the first, a distinct divergence from the helter-skelter nervousness of the Duck. It took talent and imagination to sustain Bugs’ popularity and to make the great Warner Brothers car¬ toons of the forties and fifties, but a legacy like A WILD HARE and PORKY’S DUCK HUNT was just the head start the studio needed for the impending years of their supremacy. Avery was never again to create a cartoon character with the infinite charm and appeal of Bugs Bunny. But then, neither was anybody else.\n\n54\n\nBetween the Lions Avery’s development from this point on was centered around his own personality, which is even more rich and strenuous, if possessed of less commercial value on cereal boxes. From 1941 to 1954 he ran his own unit at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (though all the cartoons claim they are “Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.,” the MGM lot was in a dumpy old place called Culver City), where he replaced Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising, and was responsible for practically every MGM cartoon of the forties and fifties that did not star Tom and Jerry. Right from the start he began cooking up his intoxicating hyperboles, assuming outsized liberties, and\n\nWHAT’S BUZZIN’ BUZZARD (1943). 55\n\nTHE BLITZ WOLF (1942).\n\ntaking his characters shamelessly to pieces, and it’s here that the relation between his cartoons and the day-to-day world of theatrical animation began to grow more and more tenuous. His first film for the new studio, THE EARLY BIRD DOOD IT, looks like it could be one of the better Warner Brothers efforts, with typical Avery gags like peeking under the water in a lake as if it were a rug. But the black humor that had been bubbling under the surface be¬ gins to be increasingly in evidence. The story concerns a worm being chased by a bird being chased by a cat. In the end, the bird eats the worm, and the cat eats the bird. Not recommended for children.\n\nWHO KILLED WHO? (1943).\n\nThe second MGM cartoon, THE BLITZ WOLF, and the first to be released, is a wholehearted comedy on as unfunny a subject as Hitler. Avery seems to have gone all out on this one, stuffing it chock full of the kind of wild humor, gag upon gag, confusion worse confounded, and savage exaggeration that was later to become routine: a B-19!4 that looks like a 747, a militaristic Sergeant Pork, enormous phallic weapons that seem to extend forever, an opening pronouncement claiming, “The auto tires used in this photoplay are fictitious,” a Good Humor Tank carrying the slogan, “I don’t want to set the world on fire,” and an awful lot of noise. Which transmits to us practically no attitude toward Hitler. One-sided propaganda may befit a lesser talent, like George Dunning or Stephen Bosustow, but a demonic nature like Avery’s is not so easily confined to simplistic campaigns for the “good.” Then there’s BATTY BASEBALL, which races into its footage 59\n\n60\n\nEd Love is responsible for this dynamic animation from BATTY BASEBALL (1944) though the slingshot gag belongs to Ray A brams.\n\n61\n\nBATTY BASEBALL.\n\nAnimation drawing from WHO KILLED WHO?\n\nWHO KILLED WHO? Interrogating some slightly suspicious insiders.\n\nbefore the credits come on, and suddenly three wonderful gags are crowded into one hysterical minute before an outraged base runner stops everything and complains, “Who’s directing this picture? Where’s the MGM lion?” And they go back and start over. Things grow tragic as a heckler in the stands goes red in the face screaming, “Kill the umpire!”— and white and then gray when they actually do. But the gem of this early batch, the fifth of the sixty-six films made at MGM, is WHO KILLED WHO?, a relentless spoof that takes on ghost stories, horror stories, murder mysteries, and all other comers. Characteristic of its macabre lunacy are the two eyes, glaring in the dark, that turn out to be affiliated with no particular organism, and loom ominously out of their doorway, just farther than they should, only to get the door shut on them. The grotesque sight of a door opening to let a corpse drop past the camera and thud to the floor is somewhat qualified by the equally grotesque sight of another corpse directly behind it, and then, after it falls, another one behind that. The graphics and the anima¬ tion draw forth all the horror possible, and the effect is genuinely ghastly, but by the time seventeen of them in a row have hit the floor it’s just crazy. Finally, one of the cadavers pauses, in his drop, long enough to trill the words, “Ah, yes! Quite a bunch of us, isn’t it!” And down he goes, followed by seventeen more. At one mad juncture the detective, in his scattered search throughout the house, reaches a door labeled, “Do not open until Christmas.” As this seems relevant to nothing, he opens it 65\n\nto reveal a closet containing Santa Claus, waiting around for December. Mr. Claus is visibly disturbed and slams the door, leaving all logical questions unanswered. All this begins with the victim of the crime, sitting in his study in the middle of a lonely night, reading a book called WHO KILLED WHO—FROM THE CARTOON OF THE SAME NAME. He has a poster board sign on his chair establishing his identity: “The Victim.” “At the sound of the gun, the time will be exactly twelve o’clock,” in¬ tones the skeleton who inhabits the cuckoo clock, and into the room looms a pistol the size of a cannon which chimes the hour. The victim writhes and gesticulates through a great death sequence, hammed up for all possible, and impossible, histrionics, and instantly a detective bursts upon the scene. “Who done it?” he yells into the vacant room. “Every¬ body stay where you are!” The locale of all this is a grand, palatial layout, with great marble balustrade stairs, on which a chase takes place involving several Lovecraftian creatures, whose origins and eventual outcomes remain as much a mystery as Santa Claus. “Reach for the ceiling,” the detective is told, and the camera tracks back to take in the entire ballroom while the de¬ tective obligingly reaches the necessary three stories to get to the ceiling. The gags here annotated are not anything unlike what could have transpired in a Tex Avery Warner Brothers cartoon. But, in their abun¬ dance, in their adroit timing, and in the act of their impenetrable ac¬ cumulation, a new style is announced.\n\nThe detective demands that all weapons be put on the table and winds up with an arsenal in WHO KILLED WHO?\n\n66\n\nCharacters and Characteristics We now come to that stage in our narrative when Mr. Avery, in an at¬ tempt to recapture the success of his discovery of Bugs Bunny, endeavors to create exciting and lovable cartoon stars to gladden the hearts of youngsters all across America and to adorn comic books, soap dishes.\n\n67\n\nbeach balls, party cups, and vitamin pills for years to come. And it would have to be said that Avery’s talent was too great to allow him to fall into the “family entertainment” trap he practically aimed himself at. There are directors whose chief medium of expression on the screen is the face of their main character, but Tex Avery isn’t one of them. His effects— more distancing than endearing—come off more like Godard’s or Eisenstein’s than like Disney’s. He enjoys telling us it’s a cartoon we’re watch¬ ing—his cartoon. His feature players comment on the dialogue in prog¬ ress. In NORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE one fellow skids clean past the sprocket holes and off the celluloid in his attempt to scurry into a movie theater, where he catches the very picture he’s appearing in. Avery treats his characters with such a directorial distance that never once do any of them come across as the justification for having made the film. Most of them, like the detective in WHO KILLED WHO? or the penguins in THE PENGUIN PARADE, are only as interesting as they have to be to have funny things happen to them. They are simply pawns on a fascinating chessboard where Avery is king of both sides and cham¬ pion player. In 1944 and 1945 there is a concerted effort to get Screwy Squirrel crammed down our throats in four pictures in a row, SCREWBALL SQUIRREL, HAPPY-GO-NUTTY, BIG HEEL-WATHA, and THE\n\n3\n\n'\n\nScrewy Squirrel.\n\n68\n\nVi\n\nTHE BULL FIGHT - PROD.

Screwy Squirrel is Daffy Duck taken one step further than he absolutely has to. A funny character who is slightly insane, like a Harpo Marx or a Woody Allen, has a subversive sort of captivating quality, but a maniac who resolutely flaunts his insanity is little more than frighten¬ ing. His starring vehicles take a hardy constitution to endure, though they exhibit their creator’s comic genius all the same. In a burst of three quick cartoons, HENPECKED HOBOES of 1946, and RED HOT RANGERS and HOUND HUNTERS of 1947, George and Junior, a cartoon parody of MICE AND MEN, were born and died. George (nasty, brutish, and short) and Junior (brontosauric in size, Cro-Magnon in comprehension level; ever repeating George’s sentences in the misguided notion that this will help him to understand them; ever devoted to George and ever spoiling all of George’s plans out of an excess of devotion) are bears or dogs or some indefinite organism, and one is never very sure whether one wishes to see them achieve their professed goals or not. Their farewell appearance in HOUND HUNT¬ ERS, however, is a decided triumph—for Avery, if no one else. (And their attempted comeback in HALF-PINT PYGMY in 1948 is a decided disaster. Avery seems to have made this film for the sole purpose of proving that George and Junior are bears. So that’s all settled.) The most appealing of Avery’s MGM characters, and the only one that my readers are likely to remember—mostly because he managed to make it onto the inside covers of the Tom and Jerry comic books—is Droopy Dog. Droopy starts rather early on in Avery’s MGM days, and has a career spanning twelve years and sixteen films, ranging all the way from the inadequate and unimaginative DROOPY’S DOUBLE TROU¬ BLE to the incontestable and unimaginable DRAG-A-LONG DROOPY. An imperturbable semicolon surrounded by exclamation points, an emo¬ tional stoic in an epicurean universe, an understatement lost in the “valley of exaggeration,” Droopy is cute enough, and some of his car¬ toons are great. But there is just no denying that what you really remem¬ ber about them is the bad guy encountering a moose head who turns out to have been a whole moose hiding behind the wall, or the bad guy beck¬ oning a tuxedoed waiter out of God-knows-what-corner of a roughhouse saloon to usher Droopy offscreen. The bad guy. Droopy’s first appearance is in Avery’s fourth cartoon for MGM, DUMB-HOUNDED, in 1943, where he reworks a gag that wasn’t funny in TORTOISE BEATS HARE, an early Bugs Bunny attempt: one fel¬ low reappearing at every turn in the path of his frenzied opponent. The essential difference, of course, is that in the Bugs Bunny picture a lengthy explanation is provided for the continual reappearance, while by this time, only two years later, Avery feels the need for no such encum¬ brance—just wherever this escaped convict turns, there is Droopy, the police dog, who has gotten there first, and is asking him something like “What kept you?” There is no forgetting the first instance of this in DUMB-HOUNDED, where Droopy, standing at the door of the crimi¬ nal’s apartment, drawls out a precautionary, “You stay here while I go\n\n73\n\nGeorge and Junior in HALF-PI NT PYGMY (1948).\n\nDUMB-HOUNDED (1943).\n\nand call the cops. Now promise me you won’t move,” while the crook speedily whips down the fire escape, leaps in a cab which takes its curves on all four wheels on the neighboring walls, drives a scooter out of the cab and onto a train which goes from zero to 200 miles an hour in one frame, hops a motorcycle out of the train and onto an ocean liner that runs with its prow up like a motorboat, and drives a jeep out of the ship’s hold and into a plane before takeoff, and after landing emerges from the plane on a hardy steed which gets him to a tiny log cabin in the middle of the Northern Canadian woods, which he has no sooner entered than he faces Droopy standing there pointing an accusing finger at him and complaining, “You moved.” This situation, so inevitable it’s predictable, soon wears itself out, so that the main center of attraction gets to be the outlandish takes of the convict. A “take,” in Avery’s definition, involves screaming, yelling, fall¬ ing apart, hiding behind your eyeballs, making the noise of a locomotive\n\n77\n\nNORTHWEST HOUNDED POLICE (1946) amplifies the central idea from DUMB-\n\nHOUNDED. Droop \\\\ like Hope, springs eternal. The Wolf never ceases to be amazed.\n\nor a Stanley Steamer, turning your tongue into a stairway to your jaw, losing your pants, turning your horizontal stripes into vertical ones, and otherwise going on to prove that you can pass muster as a Tex Avery character. From 1949 on, Droopy pops up rather often, though his villains still succeed in stealing attention from him with stunning regularity. In DARE-DEVIL DROOPY he’s up against a colorful bulldog named Spike (all bulldogs are named Spike) in a competition for a circus job which quickly reduces itself to a series of manic blackouts, Droopy un¬ wittingly foiling all of Spike’s wicked schemes just by being innocent. Spike tries showing up Droopy’s dexterity with the 1000-pound barbells by putting stickers over all the zeroes. Droopy then hoists the object as if it were a one-pound toy. When Spike tries it, the stickers peel off, and the full tonnage of the barbell promptly crushes him through the floor of the stage. Droopy is fired out of a cannon and lands pertly in a safety net. Spike is fired out of the same cannon, and flies past the net, through the tent, across the sky, and into the ocean, where he sinks a battleship. Later, Spike falls through a safety net, and expires in a pile of cubes. Between THE CHUMP CHAMP and DROOPY’S GOOD DEED, two more from the same pattern, Spike gets bashed with a tree, flushed down a waterfall, eaten by beavers, burned to a cinder, blasted to a smudge, and cracked into tiny pieces like a china figurine, and each time it’s his own fault for being the villain. THE THREE LITTLE PUPS is the only cartoon in the world dar¬ ing enough to stand little Droopy up against an equally lackadaisical vil84\n\nlain, in the form of a slowpoke dogcatcher with a Carolina accent who gets all the laughs without going to all lengths and breadths to do it. The action in the film sort of erupts unintentionally, out of strange sources like the hand puppet of a kitten the dogcatcher tries to snare the dogs with (“Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow, man!”), which takes off like a shot after the toy mouse that Droopy tries to snare the kitten with, and drags the dogcatcher on a reluctant trip through several backyards. “If this don’t work,” says the Carolina hound of his final scheme, “I’ll. . . I’ll go into television!” The scheme doesn’t work, and within three seconds he has gotten himself into the movie Droopy is watching on television. In the incredible final shot, the animated dogcatcher swings into view riding a live-action horse and steals the scene again. But the piece de resistance of Droopy’s career, and a handsome enough entry for anybody’s pedigree, is DRAG-A-LONG DROOPY, of 1954. Here the villain is Avery’s old standby, The Wolf (no other name is provided), who devotes half his footage to various unsuccessful at¬ tempts at getting on his horse: falling on his face in the dirt, playing leap¬ frog with the dumb animal, and finally sliding with the saddle to a spot underneath the horse’s ribcage. The best routine in the film is one of the best in the world. Avery builds it up in good, methodical, silent-comedy fashion, and then uses as his topper one of those insane gags out of no¬ where that only he can do. The Wolf, in an upstairs room in a one-horsetown saloon, hops out the window and onto the porch in hot pursuit of an escaped Droopy, and hops from there onto his one horse—or toward his one horse, as he ends up landing on his chin just to one side of it. For his second try, he dashes, determined, into the saloon again, runs out the second-story window, leaps off the porch, and bites the dust in exactly the same spot. Getting wise now, he moves the horse over to where he keeps breaking his teeth, then runs into the saloon again, out the secondstory window again, off the porch again, and onto his head in exactly the spot the horse was standing before. Tiring of this, he gives up and calls a cab. As a climax to a beautifully constructed routine, this comes as both unexpected and inevitable. The plot concerns the familiar struggle between the ranchers and the sheepherders, taken to unfamiliar dimensions like the opening track across the Bear Butte Ranch: cattle to the left of you, cattle to the right of you, cattle on the homestead, cattle in the living room, cattle on the dinner table, cattle on the front porch, cattle hanging around on the roof. The cattleman, catching our wondering eyes, observes, “You know, uh, I raise cattle.” In all this nonsense, Droopy can hardly be accused of doing anything at all—even to the point of sitting there like a bump on a noggin, reading a comic book, while his enterprising pistols carry on the shoot-out for him—a perfect image for Droopy’s contribution to the re¬ markable films he was the almost incidental star of.\n\n85\n\nA Couple of Gems The best of Avery’s cartoons for MGM don’t even pretend to have an in¬ teresting character in them—just the usual assortment of nondescript cats and dogs and unctuous narrators that offer no interference to the director’s owlish eye. It is an extremely arbitrary cat who opens 1947’s KING-SIZE CANARY looking for food in a back alley in the middle of the night. But two nearby boxes come to his aid when he tries to crawl inside a kitchen window. Stacked on top of each other, they still aren’t high enough to let him in, but anxiously, desperately, he stacks them on top of the space they took up when they were stacked on top of each other, as if there were four boxes there, and they give him plenty of lee¬ way and he scrambles in. The two boxes hang suspended in air for a half¬ beat, then, the anxiety gone, they collapse, spent, to the ground. Like the baseball bat in EARLY BIRD DOOD IT which wilts in proportion to the dismay experienced by the bird who is holding it, the boxes demon¬ strate that the laws of nature in Avery’s universe are determined by the mood of the moment. The cat may not have much personality, but for a couple of old boxes these guys are real charmers. The foray for food uncovers nothing but a threadbare kitchen, and one mouse sitting in a cat food can who protests that it would be impru¬ dent of the cat to eat him just now, as he, the mouse, has seen KINGSIZE CANARY before, and knows that he saves the cat’s life in the end. “But there’s a mighty tempting canary in the next room,” says the mouse, “eat HIM!” Then the canary turns out to be about as juicy as a raisin. And this is where the central hub of a good Avery hyperbole begins to roll: the subconscious acceptance of a notion we know perfectly well to be wholly senseless. Avery cartoons probably wouldn’t be able to function if it weren’t for a whole team of crazy ideas that we insist on holding dear to our heads, all the while knowing that we would have to be idiots to really believe them. Once we have accepted the conventional cartoon world of hobo cats who need a shave and talking mice who have seen the movie before, then he can lead us to the main bypass—the little bottle of Jumbo-Gro, one of those patented absurdities adorned with be¬ fore and after drawings of a withered flower on the left and a sturdy, healthy flower on the right. Consciously, we are aware of this drawing as a device; we realize its presence on the label bears no relation to the 86\n\npotency of the liquid inside. Otherwise, we would be morons. But sub¬ consciously we will be subtly convinced that a miracle is somehow con¬ tained in the bottle, that this is an elixir worth spending money on. Otherwise, the advertising industry would have disintegrated eons ago. It’s just the fact that Avery uses, as the premise from which everything else takes off, a commercial product of the kind we have sold to us every day, rather than some fantasied “magic potion” we could only swallow against our better judgment, that makes the ensuing farcical situations seem so tangible and real. After a brainstorm (which rains all over the table), the cat pours Jumbo-Gro down the bird’s throat, hoping he can nurture the hapless withered thing into the semblance of a duck, or a goose, or, hell, maybe even a pheasant. His success is extraordinary. Before he can take the first bite out of the leg, there, sitting on the plate on the table before him, has sprouted a giant, seven-foot yellow ox. At that, the cat vanishes in re¬ treat, while the innocent canary spends some time getting properly ad¬ justed to the fact that he’s an ox now and gathering up the wherewithal to chase him. The stray bottle of Jumbo-Gro then goes on to enjoy a lengthy career of being tested out by a random sampling of neighbor¬ hood pets, each of whom suddenly discovers in himself an unmanage¬ able potential for turning into a monster. There is a double take every\n\nModel sheet for KING-SIZE CANARY (1947) with important details noted.\n\n87\n\nLouis Shmitt's sketches for BAD LUCK BLACKlE’sostensible hero.\n\ninstant, as one of the animals stops and comprehends that some new giant is here to be contended with. A bird the size of an elephant is chased by a cat the size of a truck, until they both stop and meet a woolly mammoth dog the size of a house. (And this is all from one bot¬ tle of the stuff. Which was half-used to begin with.) The stodgiest kind of representational drawing is used to good effect in the backgrounds: here, over houses and garages from a 1940s textbook in accounting, are clambering outlandish creatures out of some dietician's nightmare. The sun has come up by this time, and the chases extend downtown, where the four-story dog is hot on the trail of the two-story cat. Until they get to the corner and meet a seven-story mouse. So it came to pass. The mouse did save the cat’s life. (Although if he had really seen the cartoon before he must have realized his alibi was only half true, that there would have been no need to save the cat’s life if he had just let himself be eaten. There also would have been no car¬ toon. Creative, that mouse.) All this does is reduce the battle to a strug¬ gle for survival between the cat and the mouse, both of them grabbing the bottle of Jumbo-Gro from each other, sprouting into the clouds at every swallow, and stampeding all over the known universe. Off they go, one Gargantuan cat chasing one behemoth mouse, traversing whole states in a couple of paces, charging across the Grand Canyon in one leap and one bound, feverishly swallowing Jumbo-Gro until the bottle runs out, then turning and explaining to us that the movie’s over, em¬ bracing each other like pals, standing, two incredible giants, either one of them twice the size of the Earth, and both attempting to maintain a precarious balance on the skimpy planet, waving sweetly at the camera as it pulls back to the viewpoint of Saturn to get the whole thing in frame. Gradually, carefully, we have been led in a logical progression from one common, well-accepted absurdity, on into the outward regions of an absurd universe. The same careful progression is a hallmark of another acknowl¬ edged Avery jewel, BAD LUCK BLACKIE, of 1949. Here we’re deal¬ ing not with commercialism, but with “superstition,” that outmoded set of irrational notions whose medieval foundations and physical irrele¬ vance are well within our intellectual grasp. But that doesn’t stop us from reacting, if involuntarily, to these survivals of past religions. There are very few buildings with a thirteenth floor, or motels with a Room Thir¬ teen. (Texas, by the way, is crawling with such folk myths, all the way from a spider in your bedroom being a sign of good luck to a vision of your eventual spouse appearing before you at the inspiration of a thim¬ bleful of salt.) So if a black cat crosses your path you’re in trouble. OK. BAD LUCK BLACKIE kicks off with a short sequence of unbe¬ lievable cruelty, and just about the only instance of Avery violence that is actually painful. A vicious old dog is mercilessly maltreating a defense¬ less kitten, catching his tongue on a mousetrap in his milk, swallowing him and disgorging him again, that sort of thing. This is also one of the few cases of an Avery character successfully tugging at our heartstrings, and with an infallible comic sense Avery has managed to make this pain-\n\n89\n\nful spectacle an amusing (if uncomfortable) scene—mostly by punc¬ tuating it with the dog’s genial-malicious wheezy chortle, so that we laugh, not at the horrible gags perpetrated on the kitten, but at the dog’s warped notion that this is a funny thing to do.\n\nad Luck Blackie ‘Oi\\ecU'A V\\i\n\nx Avery\n\nA black cat comes to the rescue and, purely out of an altruistic love for cathood, sets up a deal with the kitten. Any time the kitten blows on an ordinary household whistle, the black cat will cross the old bulldog’s path. In return, the kitten will do nothing. That’s the deal. The first test of the arrangement turns up in just a few seconds. Accompanied by a sprightly rendition of “Cornin’ Through the Rye,” the black cat makes a mysterious entrance, dances in front of the dog, and makes a mysterious exit. And then, before you have time to get apprehensive about it, a flower pot has come crashing down on the dog’s head. (The camera as¬ cending to a slightly Olympian, sort of cosmic viewpoint to contain the catastrophe, then scooting down to a kitten’s-eye view for the conclusion of the negotiation.) So far, no problem. A flower pot can fall from a window any time, and we’re just expecting to see this villainous dog get beaned about now, black cat’s entrance or no. There is only the splitsecond timing of the two events to make this peculiar enough to be funny. But when this happens every time the whistle is blown and the black cat appears, and the flower pot is quickly followed by another flower pot, then a heavy trunk, a small bomb, a cash register, four horse¬ shoes (and a horse, looking extremely puzzled), a fire hydrant, a safe, enough bricks to form a wall (which they do), and then an anvil, we 90\n\nbegin to suspect that there’s something up there, and it’s not happy with that dog. We all know how any other director would have handled this situa¬ tion. Cut away to a construction site, and a closeup of a sign saying “Danger: Falling Objects. Keep Away!” Then a rope snapping on a girder, followed by an aghast foreman hollering, “The rope’s broken! Run for your life!” and a panic-stricken crowd fleeing the scene. Then, after that, maybe, the dog could stray into the area and meet his doom. Not Tex Avery. A few bars of “Cornin’ Through the Rye,” and CRASH! the dog is clobbered. When Avery described this cartoon to me, several months before I had a chance to see it, it was with the ac¬ customed amiable glee that precluded the idea of any damage being done to anybody. “The black cat would no sooner cross the dog’s path,” he told me, “Than WHAM! he’d be hit with a safe or something.” “Where does the safe come from?” I asked innocently, and not without naivete. Avery’s answer was a small stammer and a vigorous waving of the hand, as if I had asked the most irrelevant question in the world. Which, in a sense, I had. In the mechanical inevitability of these falling objects, in their escalating impact, in the wonderful absurdity that unites such illogical events with such seeming logic, the question of where the things may be coming from becomes totally irrelevant. They have to be there. The lampoon on a popular superstition can be taken just so far, and only when it’s coupled with this steadily increasing sense of vengeance is it capable of producing such perfect comic violence and the odd intuitive idea that fate is taking its inevitable course in dumping things on the dog. We begin to be convinced the whole cosmos has ganged up on him. (The dog, of course, reacts to having some of the heaviest objects that exist in the world falling from an unseen source, perhaps miles away, with a force strong enough to shatter granite, by being non¬ plused, and somewhat tipsy. At one point his head is blown away, and it takes him a whole fadeout to get it back again.) As if the main thread of the situation were not hilarity enough, it is embroidered with every variety of character interplay as a cat-and-dog game is played out by the principals, astounding us with: 1) the kitten’s resourcefulness in finding new hiding places, 2) the bulldog’s resource¬ fulness in getting the kitten in impossible spots, 3) the cat’s own brand of resourcefulness that tops both of them, appearing out of one place he couldn’t possibly be and disappearing into another where he couldn’t possibly go, and 4) the cosmos’ latest answer to the continuing hos¬ tilities. But, grand as it all works out for the cosmos, the divine retribution notion isn’t complete until the kitten can get his own licks in. A nearby mopful of white paint cancels out the black cat, and “Cornin’ Through the Rye” heralds nothing. While the dog takes his chance to engage in some fiendish torture with the white (nee black) cat, the kitten sees a chance to cover himself with black paint and perform his own strutting. At the same time, the full importan"
