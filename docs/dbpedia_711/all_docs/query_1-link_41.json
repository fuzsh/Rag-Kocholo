        "text": "In my opinion, all the WB directors. Friz Freleng, Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones, Robert McKimson, Tex Avery, Arthur Davis, Ben Hardaway. Friz Freleng was a great director. His WB cartoons from 1936 and on was great, and he rarely had a bad cartoon after that...but his 1930's period really bores me. His teamups with Harman and Ising are quite enjoyable, and I think his Captain and the Kids films for MGM were fine...but Friz's little 'musical' color Merrie Melodies fro the 1934-1936 years were terrible. This is once again my opinion, many people like those. I feel like a lot of people give Chuck Jones too much credit as a director. However, Chuck did make great WB cartoons like \"Rabbit of Seville\", \"Drip-Along Daffy\" and \"What's Opera Doc\" as well as the hunting trilogy WB cartoons featuring Bugs, Daffy and Elmer just to name a some, but what I feel about Chuck Jones has no bearing on the great cartoons he directed. Tex Avery was great as well. Unpopular opinion, but I did like some of Tex Avery WB cartoons like \"Land of the Midnight Fun\", \"Cross-Country Detours\", \"Circus Today\" and \"Wacky Wildlife\", but I do agree that they're nothing compared to his MGM cartoons. Robert McKimson and Arthur Davis, in my view, are perhaps both the most neglected talents from the \"Looney Tunes\" golden age. McKimson, after taking over Frank Tashlin's unit in 1945, continued to make strong, funny cartoons with Bugs, Daffy and Porky. McKimson, just like Tex Avery, caricatured Hollywood Celebrities as Dogs in \"Hollywood Canine Canteen\" and Abbott and Costello as Mice in the \"The Mouse-merized Cat\". Great cartoons. Even McKimson's 50's Sylvester, Sylvester Jr and Hippety Hopper cartoons were severely underrated in my opinion. A lot of people don't like McKimson much, and I don't know why. Come on, the guy who was practically\n\nTHE Bugs Bunny director of the early 1950's? I guess they don't like him for his work on the post-1964 cartoons, but I actually think his are the best of those shorts, and what could he do about the budget cuts at the time? \"The Hole Idea\" isn't a bad cartoon, it's not his best, but it's pretty funny. In fact, McKimson's only real turkies were from the 1963-1964 years, stuff like \"Dr. Devil and Mr. Hare\" and \"Strangled Eggs\". Arthur Davis, after taking over Bob Clampett's unit, after Clampett left Warner Bros, he continued Clampett's trend of wackyness, but added his own unique style to his cartoons by giving characters ridiculous sized bow ties. Lastly, I think Norm McCabe's early Daffy and Porky cartoons were entertaining. He was a short-lived director at Warner Bros, but \"Daffy's Southern Exposure\" was by far his best cartoon that had ever done in my view.\n\nI don't really know who is my favorite, so I'll just split the directors up into different categories:\n\nAMAZING:\n\n- Friz Freleng: You've got to hand it to him, he did the most consistent work. Even in 1963, cartoons like The Unmentionables were serviceable enough. He also had a great sense of musical timing and handled Bugs Bunny very well.\n\nFAVORITES: She Was an Acrobat's Daughter, Rhapsody in Rivets, Buccaneer Bunny, Bugs and Thugs, Birds Anonymous\n\n- Chuck Jones: He was also very consistent with his work. Although he made the character designs too cute later on, and a few of his early cartoons are nothing to write home about. Also handled Bugs very well.\n\nFAVORITES: The Dover Boys, The Rabbit of Seville, Rabbit Fire, Duck Amuck, Now Hear This\n\n- Bob Clampett: His early work was good, but you could tell he didn't really care about developing Porky's character. From 1940-1941, he made a string of mediocre cartoons, but from 1942-1946, it was just plain wild laugh-riots (although a bit too sloppy sometimes), which made up for his earlier work. Handled Bugs Bunny decently.\n\nFAVORITES: The Daffy Doc, Porky in Egypt, A Tale of Two Kitties, Buckaroo Bugs, Book Revue\n\n- Frank Tashlin: Again, his early work was good, but his 40s work was better. He used lots of interesting techniques like fast cuts, used lots of perspectives, and in general has a very distinct directing style. I can't really tell from 2 Bugs Bunny cartoons (he deserved more), but from what I've seen, he handled the character great.\n\nFAVORITES: Cracked Ice, Wholly Smoke, Porky Pig's Feat, Nasty Quacks, Hare Remover\n\nGOOD:\n\n- Arthur Davis: A very underrated director. Good work all the way through his career and should have stayed longer. Again, hard to tell, but he handled Bugs Bunny good.\n\nFAVORITES: Mexican Joyride, Catch as Cats Can, What Makes Daffy Duck? The Stupor Salesman, Bowery Bugs\n\n- Robert McKimson: His first 10 years or so of directing were hilarious, but he sunk into a sea of mediocrity after that, sadly. Handled Bugs Bunny very great.\n\nFAVORITES: Daffy Doodles, The Birth of a Notion, It's Hummer Time, A Fractured Leghorn, Design for Leaving\n\nMEH:\n\n- Tex Avery: His first 3 or so years were good, but then he devolved into making spot-gag cartoons that weren't all that great. His leave for MGM was probably for the better. Handled Bugs Bunny good.\n\nFAVORITES: Daffy Duck in Hollywood, Hamateur Night, Thugs with Dirty Mugs, The Bear's Tale, The Heckling Hare\n\n- Norman McCabe: Had some interesting premises, but he always felt the need to insert war references in just about every cartoon he made for some reason. Ending his career with Tokio Jokio wasn't exactly the best way to go out, too.\n\nFAVORITES: Robinson Crusoe Jr., Daffy's Southern Exposure, The Ducktators, The Impatient Patient, Confusions of a Nutsy Spy\n\n- Jack King: Decent director, but his stories sometimes came out boring. Porky was always treated weirdly in these cartoons for some reason.\n\nFAVORITES: Viva Buddy (for the ending, basically), Hollywood Capers, Shanghaied Shipmates, Porky's Pet, Porky's Moving Day\n\n- Ben Hardaway & Cal Dalton: Hardaway just wasn't that good of a co-director. Lots of not-very-good animation in their cartoons as well.\n\nFAVORITES: Porky the Gob, Count Me Out, Porky & Teabiscuit, Bars & Stripes Forever, Hare-um Scare-um\n\nBLECH:\n\n- any director I didn't list here\n\n???:\n\n- Cal Howard & Cal Dalton: All 3 of their cartoons showed promise, and I liked the loose, buttery style in them. However, I'm putting them here because I don't have enough work to judge them by.\n\nFAVORITES (by default): Porky's Phoney Express, Katnip Kollege, A-Lad-in Bagdad\n\n- Ub Iwerks: Seemed to be OK. Porky and Gabby was the better of the two he directed. Again, not enough work.\n\nFAVORITES (by default): Porky and Gabby, Porky's Super Service\n\n- Harman/Ising: Haven't seen enough of their cartoons to judge them by, but they look good.\n\nJones, without a doubt. He was a genius and his films were funny and brilliant.\n\nAnd as a response to superdude, Daffy had snippets of the \"a-hole\" personality long before Jones ever directed a Daffy short. You ever seen \"You Ought to Be in Pictures\"? So blaming Jones entirely for Daffy's personality change is stupid.\n\nI think it's the problem that Jones was VERY attached to formula. Once he found a shtick for a character he rarely deviated. EVER. Hence why a lot of his unit-exclusive characters ended up rather one note. Now don't get me wrong, a lot of them are GREAT cartoons, but they have a 'seen one, seen 'em all' feel a lot of the time. When Jones made his first 'Bugs vs Daffy' and 'Daffy as movie flop' cartoons, that's almost all Daffy ever did from that point on. A shame since some of his earlier 'greedy Daffy' cartoons had cool premises like Daffy Dilly or You Were Never Duckier's con-artist role.\n\nI think it's also that said formula tended to just be a variation of one the Looney Tunes series had already done to death by loads of other characters; another outclassed antagonist for Bugs. The jerk who picks a fight and never knows when to cut his losses. What I liked about earlier Daffy (or at least 40s era Daffy) was that his cartoons were suitably random, he could be a winner or a loser, a friend or an enemy, a troll or a well intentioned nut. With Jones' Daffy, you knew every punchline involved him acting like a jerk and getting hit. Funny but again, derivative.\n\nI think that's why I liked a lot of Mckimson's work since he was a pretty good mediator of the old and new formulas and thus often had the most versatile versions of the cast. His Daffy gained a lot of Jones' version's selfish ambitious qualities, but played him in lots of different situations, and wasn't afraid to revert him into the crazy little black duck of before if it made a funnier cartoon. Similarly his Bugs gained a bit of Jones' suaveness, but he could still be a bit of an obnoxious smart ass and even lose the odd cartoon like beforehand (I believe this was at McKimson's own choosing since he actually complained Jones had toned down Bugs to the point of making him bland). Also notice how Mckimson's own star, Foghorn Leghorn, despite often using the same farm backdrop, rarely kept to one same formula. They could have kept him against Barnyard or Henery non-stop but they kept trying very different foils and premises for him to bounce off of.\n\nThe only character that felt kinda typecast in McKimson's works was Sylvester, since he kept that same Hippety Hopper formula for him with little variation, though even then he did the occasional different cartoon with him such as the Speedy series.\n\nI think it's the problem that Jones was VERY attached to formula.

That's what made Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies very successful. Jones had a formula for Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny pairings as well as the Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner pairings. A lot of his Pepe Le Pew shorts also relied on formula.\n\nMcKimson used formula for his Foghorn Leghorn shorts with Henery Hawk and other characters who would torture Foghorn. The Sylvester/Hippety Hopper scene relied on formula to an extreme.\n\nFreleng used formulas with Tweety/Sylvester pairings. Tweety never gets harmed and Sylvester always loses. It's a formula. The Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam series was built on formulas. You have Yosemite Sam with his guns and then Bugs just comes and harasses him.\n\nThe only one I say who didn't use formulas were Tex Avery and Arthur Davis. Davis directed a lot of one-shots so he couldn't have access to a formula and Avery did the travelogue shorts, which were all different from each other, although most of them were American tours.\n\nClampett relied on formulas a lot through his Porky/Daffy pairings that he supervised. Most of them include Daffy teasing Porky. That's a formula.\n\nAlso, the one-shots between 1933 (after Harman/Ising left)-1935 were pretty boring. The ones I've watched between 1931-1933 are okay. I liked the Merrie Melodies series better when they swapped to 3-hue color in 1936. \"I Wanna Play House\" has awesome animation and light laughs. \"Plenty of Money and You\" is pretty interesting and \"My Little Buckaroo\" is a good one-shot short with a plot that would later form Yosemite Sam/Bugs Bunny pairings.\n\nIn fact, I liked the one-shots better than the black-and-white Looney Tunes shorts. I personally never enjoyed the black-and-white cartoons. They are the originals, but they were bland, and the animation directors were still learning their styles. There are a few exceptions: \"Porky in Wackyland\", \"Porky's Duck\", and \"Hare Hunt\", \"You Ought to be in Pictures\", \"Porky Pig's Feat\", and the wartime black-and-white shorts (except \"Tokio Jokio\") are good. Some of them I disliked: \"Tokio Jokio\", the one-shot black-and-white shorts between 1941-1943, and \"Porky and Gabby\".\n\nI personally think the formulas get tiring after a while, especially the Daffy/Speedy formula, (I think the downtime years of Looney Tunes,1930-1939 and 1964-1969, are still better than what is on most television today) but they are what made Looney Tunes successful."
