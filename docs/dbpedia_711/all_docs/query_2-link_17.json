Doc?” of Bugs Bunny.\n\nBlvd,\n\nFifteen thousand cards and letters came pouring in from children and adults both,\n\nr* i.,A 5U. ti ■M',\n\nOif\n\nJu' k\n\nfr!',t,r\n\n-.rU ‘iU\n\nlUauiy\n\nn-.'-'v Si.,in\n\nlike a thousand to one. The papers referred to him as the man of a thousand voices,\n\nsome addressed only to “Bugs Bunny, Hollywood, USA.” So many telephone calls wishing for Blanc’s recovery flooded the hospital switchboard that extra lines and operators had to be put on. Gifts of pennies, nickels, sticks of gum, and carrots arrived in the mail, with fervent prayers from every religious denomination, messages scrawled in crayon reading, “Please, God, let Bugs Bunny get well.” A human being was in critical condition, and the first thought on the minds of millions of people was that something might happen to Bugs Bunny. After twenty-one days and nights, and no amount of talking, pleading, whis¬ pering, or praying had succeeded in rousing Mel from his coma, his neurosurgeon. Dr. Louis Conway, got an idea. “How are you feeling today. Bugs Bunny?” he asked. “Eh, just fine. Doc. How’re you?” came the voice from the bandages. “Mel was dying,” said the doctor years later, “and it seemed as though Bugs Bunny was trying to save his life.” Defying the odds and his doctors, and delighting his family, his friends at War¬ ner Bros. Cartoons, and millions of fans all over the world, Blanc rallied and began a slow but steady recovery to total health. Bugs Bunny was going to be OK. Michael Maltese, one of Bugs’ writers, once said, “After a while. Bugs Bunny was so well loved by the audience that he could do no wrong. We had quite a few lousy Bugs Bunnies. We’d say, ‘Well, we haven’t got time. Let’s do it.’ And we’d do it, and the audience would laugh. They loved the rabbit, and what he stood for.”\n\nAbove; Even the press saw Mel Blanc’s devastating accident as something that had happened to Bugs Bunny. Right; A small bunny, Bugs casts a large shadow. Frame from Chuck Jones’ What’s\n\nOpera, Doc?, 1957.\n\n16\n\nIf that’s true, then what, exactly, did he stand for? If what we’re talking ^bout is an idea, then what’s the big idea?\n\nThe Real Bugs Bunny Bugs Bunny is that irrepressible rabbit who always chews nonchalantly on a car¬ rot and asks that impertinent question, “What’s up, Doc?” The real impertinence, of course, is in a writer’s trick like this, the pretense that a great character is reducible to a few words on a page. It actually involves a sort of double-edged literary conceit: that the writer can come up with the right phrase, and that a popular film character is predictable, easily categorized, and harmless. Any character who could be captured so easily is probably not a great char¬ acter, and so probably not worth capturing. Bugs is a character who’s spent fifty years proving he couldn’t be captured. “Even the people who write about animation,” complains Chuck Jones, “just don’t seem to understand that when you have a drawing, you don’t have a character. It’s like seeing a photograph of an actor and then saying, ‘We’re choosing this actor.’ I don’t understand these casting dire(jtors: What do you know when you look at him? OK, he looks the part, but until I see him move, I haven’t any idea whether he is the part or not.\n\nIf it’s anything, it’s the\n\nbodily style, bodily movement, gestures, mistakes that you make, that identify you, not what you wear, or the facial movements, or even the voice. Even with a talkative character like Bugs Bunny, we wanted to be certain that the action demonstrated what we were talking about—in other words, our characters were actors.” 3ob Clampett tried encapsulating the character in the first person to Michael Barrier in 1969: “Some people call me cocky and brash, but actually I’m just self-assured. I’m nonchalant, imperturb¬ able, contemplative. I play it cool, but I can get hot under the collar. And above all I’m a very ‘aware’ character. I’m well aware that I am appearing in an animated cartoon . . . And I sometimes chomp on my carrot for the same reason that a stand-up comic chomps on his cigar ... it saves me from rushing from the last joke to the next one too fast. And I sometimes don’t act ... I react. And I always treat the contest with my pursuers purely as ‘fun and games.’ When momentarily I appear to be cornered or in dire danger and I scream, don’t be consoined — it’s actually a big put-on. Let’s face it. Doc, I’ve read the script and I already know how it all comes out. “Of course,” he finally admitted, “Bugs Bunny is much too complex a personality for us to fully explore his ‘psyche’ in these few minutes.” The idea that a “cartoon character” like Bugs Bunny might be “too complex a personality” to describe in a few sentences might seem at first a contradiction in terms. After all, a character like Bugs exists for only seven minutes of screen time at a stretch, as opposed to characters in two-reel comedies, half-hour sitcoms, and full-length features, who must carry twenty, thirty, ninety minutes, or three or four hours. But a great series character has to pull off a neat trick: he has an identity made up of hundreds of sep-\n\nAbove.’ Robert McKimson’s wartime drawing of Bugs for a Los Angeles department store’s Easter show has since become a standard publicity pose. Left.’ Just a few of the many facets of Bugs Bunny, as illustrated by selected cels from his appearances: a clown in Chuck Jones’ Barbary Coast Bunny, 1956; a genial host on The Bugs\n\nBunny Show, 1960-62; a dashing sophisticate in Friz Freleng’s Slick Hare, 1947.\n\n1\n\narate episodes (about 175, in Bugs’ case) that must each stand alone, but all inter¬ connect strongly enough to establish a consistent personality in the minds of the audience. If he’s too schematic, he fades into nonentity; but if he’s too vague and illdefined, he never takes hold. Part of Bugs’ great achievement has been to establish a strong personality that can exist for seven minutes at a time, show us a facet of that personality, disappear for weeks, months, maybe years, then reappear and be rec¬ ognizable, familiar, a buddy, yet still surprise us enough to be entertaining once again. His possibilities are not exhausted by any single episode. (“And thank God,” adds Chuck Jones.) A certain amount of complexity, a whole other dimension, is required for that to work. The trick is not to sustain seven minutes, but to live for fifty years. Take Bugs’ ears. “Draw ears to suit mood,” says one of his early model sheets. This the artists did. Bugs plays piano with his ears in Rhapsody Rabbit, conducts a full orchestra with them in Baton Bunny, runs on them in A Hare Grows in Manhat¬ tan, and in both The Big Snooze and Slick Hare he dances on them.\n\nIn Rabbit of\n\nSeville, he massages Elmer Fudd’s scalp with them; in Rabbit’s Feat, he uses one as\n\na corkscrew to dig into his rabbit hole. In both The Wabbit Who Came to Supper and The Heckling Hare, Bugs’ ears are capable of operating autonomously and even develop\n\na pantomimic rapport with each other; they also operate like periscopes, implying that they are able to see. Bugs uses his ears for additional expression, for gags, for extra appendages, and the way a cat uses his whiskers—the way we used to use rabbit ears—as sensing devices tuning him in to his environment. They don’t sum him up, but graphically they point lOONEY\n\nin the right direction. Bugs enjoys being a rabbit, but he’s flexible. For a considerable\n\nCARTOON\n\nstretch of Rabbit Rampage he’s a horse; for a few seconds in Knight-Mare Hare he has\n\ntune\n\nto put up with being a pig, and in Transylvania 6-5000, a baseball bat. Bugs is an appealing force for good. He comes on television and sells the kids vitamins that are good for them; he instructs them about fire prevention and earth¬ quake safety. That overwhelming charm, Mel Blanc’s ear-nuzzling voice—syrupy smooth without getting sticky sweet—that face carefully input by skilled artists with TfCHNJCOLOft,\n\nevery time-tested element of eye appeal they can think of, after an evolution that took ■fteu*»s;\n\nyears—his ability to please, to be lovable and non-threatening—surely it’s that, in its purest and simplest form, which accounts for his success as a character. But when British documentarian John Needham interviewed moviegoers in line for The Bugs BunnylRoadrunner Movie, he found that more than one person singled out Bugs’ “anarchistic” qualities as the element they most responded to in the char¬ acter—especially one man who called him “sort of the major character influence in my life, basically being [an] anti-establishment, disrespectful, anti-authoritarian kind of character.” And Tom Shales of the Washington Post has explained his inordinate love for The Rabbit in pretty much the same way: “I love Bugs Bunny, because of his attitude toward the Establishment, his absolute refusal to take any . . . stuff. . . from anybodyf’ Franklin Rosemont, leading spokesman for the American chapter of the international Surre¬ alist movement, has written, “Bugs Bunny stands as a veritable symbol of irreducible recalcitrance . . . one can scarcely imagine a better model to offer our children than this bold creature who, with his four rabbit’s feet, is the good luck charm of total revolt.” This was basically the explanation for Bugs’ popularity offered by the motion\n\nAbove and opposite; A handful\n\npicture trade periodical Showmen s Trade Review in 1943: “The unpredictable antics\n\nof the nearly 200 episodes that constitute Bugs Bunny’s life,\n\nof this brash hare, his amazing contrast to other animated favorites, proved not a little\n\nseven minutes at a shot; publicity\n\nperplexing to adults and children alike . . . Why, when most spectators are inclined\n\nart distributed by Warner Bros,\n\nto sympathize with the underdog, should a presumptuous bumpkin like this win their\n\nfor theatrical cartoons directed by\n\napproval? The answer might well lie in the fact that the average person, in life a hard¬\n\nChuck Jones, Bob Clampett,\n\nworking introvert striving to get along, found in this character the nerve and bluster,\n\nFrank Tashlin, Bob McKimson,\n\nthe boldness and self-assurance, he himself would like to possess.”\n\nTex Avery and Friz Freleng from 1941 to 1964.\n\n18\n\nFor the people questioned in the C.A.

Robert McKimson, who saw it happen, said, “It’s toward the end of the ’50s and into the early 1960s, just before we closed down, that things got too subtle, with everything underplayed. He became too much of a suave character. You know, you have to progress, and this underplaying was a different way of doing things. Some¬ times you don’t always progress in the right direction.” It was because of that awareness that “you have to progress” that the Termite Terrace gang was able to keep Bugs hopping, to keep him funny, and to allow him to continue surprising us, for two decades. If that resulted in a mis-step or two some¬ where along the line, it only proves that they were human, and proceeding on instinct rather than formula. But the theatrical cartoon was heading into treacherous waters, where a single mis-step spelled death—heading, actually, in the direction of the two-reel comedy, another victim of neglect by theater owners, who refused pay the higher prices that quality demanded, and their patrons, who took them for granted as long as Holly¬ wood was turning them out and they were getting something for nothing. Animation crews who had made the adjustment to budgets that seemed less than ideal were now forced to try to adjust to budgets that were even less than that. The cartoons became even shorter than they had been before. Motion was a luxury to be indulged in only in moments of extreme duress. Characters who had been convinc¬ ingly three-dimensional for two decades were now quite evidently drawings, sliding back and forth across more artwork. What mattered most was that comedy conveyed through character and expressed through a delicate inter-working of tempo, mood, animated action, and vocal histrion¬ ics\n\nbegan to falter and lose its step. A fine line was crossed, somewhere between\n\nreversing, or even sending up, the old routines, and replacing them with cardboard substitutes. The result was not so much Bunny Ha-Ha as Bunny Peculiar. What was happening in Bugs’ case was really the disintegration of his collective personality. Termite Terrace had gained and lost personnel at a steady pace since 1940,\n\nTop.- “So what’s a rabbit to do?” Bugs seems to be asking in this cel from Friz Freleng’s Shishkabugs, 1963.

Above right; Color chart of Bugs and Daffy for The Bugs Bunny Show, which first aired in 1960.\n\n86\n\nbut some of the losses suffered in the late ’50s were crippling. The defection of War¬ ren Foster and Michael Maltese to the novelty (and higher salary) of television animation, the loss of Tedd Pierce, the death of Fudd voice Arthur Q. Bryan, the retire¬ ment of Carl Stalling, then the death of his arranger. Milt Franklyn, after he’d taken Stalling’s place—all these events within the space of a couple of years took their inevitable toll. “The day of one character chasing another, like Tom & Jerry or Elmer Fudd after The Rabbit, is kind of passe,” Freleng remarked in the ’60s. “The reaction used to be great, but your theater audiences today are different. The young kids see television and don’t go to theaters. They used to line up for the Saturday matinee; they don’t even have it anymore. And the older people stay home and watch television. That’s why we’ve got an entirely different kind of audience.” By this time Bugs had become, in effect, a television personality, having pre¬ miered as host of his own prime-time network television show in October of 1960, and having given the phenomenal hit Gunsmoke a run for its money in its evening slot. It was television that Warner Bros, seemed to see as the future of animation, and, for\n\nAbove.\" Pose from model sheet from The Bugs Bunny Show.

But then what can you expect? There are no rabbit screenwriters, no rabbit directors. If you ask me, I think the studios are afraid of us now that we’re not willing to settle for mere carrots.”\n\n—Bugs Bunny, quoted by Gregg Kilday in The Los Angeles Times\n\nIt was during this period that Bugs Bunny became The Rabbit Who Refused to Die. The trend in ’60s animation was away from the series that had served as enter¬ tainment for all ages and all levels of sophistication since 1940, and away from the characters who had been prancing across the screen since just about that time, toward . . . Something Else. Anything else, it sometimes seemed, just so long as it wasn’t The Cartoon as we’d gotten used to it, as Disney had created it, as Tex Avery had brought it to comic life, and as brilliant practitioners like Freleng, Jones, Jack Hannah, Ward Kimball, Bob Cannon, Paul Julian, and Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera had kept it alive. Animation critic Michael Barrier noted in 1969, “There’s an urge to grind Bugs Bunny and Donald Duck into the dust, not merely to do something that doesn’t much resemble Bugs Bunny or Donald Duck.” Above; Cel from a Tex Avery Kool-Aid commercial of the late ’60s or early ’70s.

Some enjoyed a brief television career, then faded even from that retirement home. As it gradually dawned on people that real cartoons were fading from the screen and being replaced by static, talky horrors (sometimes resembling cartoons for the blind, in their inclination toward describing every action prior to, after, during, or instead of, its actual performance), a powerful nostalgia developed for the Golden Age they had unwittingly experienced. Something we had grown up with had died! Bugs’ appeal worked, at first, against any comeback attempts. Because he was Warner Bros, star character, management preferred to leave him out of the low-budget efforts the studio produced, or caused to be produced, between 1964 and 1969. The Warner Bros. Studio itself changed hands several times during the ensuing years, and consistent policies were hard to come by. “We get one set of rules to go by,” Bob McKimson remarked in the 1970s, “and all of a sudden they sell the studio and we’ve got another set of rules and another set of people to cater to.” But Bugs lived on as a figure of nostalgia. When his voice artist established the Mel Blanc School of Voice and Commercials, it was chiefly known by its short title. Bugs Bunny Tech. Bugs sold Kool-Aid, in commercials made by Friz Freleng at DePatie-Freleng Enterprises and by Tex Avery at Cascade Productions. Avery enjoyed working with The Rabbit again, but dealing with a celebrity of this magnitude was a little awkward. He was continually astounded by the eternal popularity of his crea¬ tion. Coming home after a day of work on the Bugs Bunny commercials, he would pass out used Rabbit cels to the kids in his neighborhood. But the existence of a supply only increased the demand, and he found himself besieged by requests for cels long after he’d given away his last one. When he asked one little girl what happened to the batch of cels he’d already given her, she piped up, “My brother takes them to school and sells them for fifty cents apiece!” Bugs Bunny as a Name, rather than an animated character, appeared in revues staged by Rodger Hess with titles like “The Bugs Bunny Follies,” “Bugs Bunny in Space,” and “Bugs Bunny Meets the Super-Heroes,” in such locations as Madison Square Garden, the Chicago Opera House, and as far afield as Melbourne, Australia, and Caracas, Venezuela. But then, just as animation was becoming a Lost Art, it began to be appreciated for its own sake. Chuck Jones, who had been producing and directing successful ani¬ mated television specials since 1970, and had been campaigning during most of that time for the rights to the now-retired Warner Bros, characters, finally received per-\n\n88\n\nFriz Freleng with Bugs at\n\nChuck Jones,\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nat the Museum\n\nAnimation in\n\nof the Moving\n\nearly 1980s.\n\nImage, London, 1988.\n\nAbove: Newly-created limited edition cels, based on original sketches or frames from previous productions, have great value as collectors items and are sold through art galleries.

After their success, the viability\n\nof the television special as a vehicle for classic clips with freshly animated wrap¬ arounds was tested and proved by the Warner Bros, studio itself in a long-running series of new bottles containing vintage wine, starting with Bugs Bunny’s Easter Special in 1977, and running up to 1989’s Bugs Bunny’s Wild World of Sports. Brand-new sevenminute episodes directed by Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones, and animated by some of the old Warner gangsters, appeared in Bugs Bunny’s Looney Christmas Tales in 1979, and Bugs Bunny’s Bustin’ Out All Over in 1980. Although Bugs had never starred in any feature films while he was one of the leading performers in short subjects, he became the lead attraction in a number of compilation features which consisted basically of his best cartoons (what Variety called “the WB vanities”), thanks to the success of MGM’s compilation feature That’s Entertainment.\n\nThe first of these, Larry Jackson’s Bugs Bunny Superstar, was released by United Artists in 1975 and contained no new cartoon footage. But in Chuck Jones’ The Bugs BunnylRoadrunner Movie in 1979, Bugs appears as a charming host (in his own home,\n\nyet), something after the fashion of the Edward R. Murrow program Person to Per¬ son, which he’d spoofed when it was new as Person to Bunny, and talks us through\n\nsome retrospective glimpses of his, and Jones’, brighter moments. This let loose a succession of Bugs and Daffy features, pouring out regularly for a while to theaters, cable channels, and videocassette outlets, with titles like Friz Freleng’s Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie and Bugs Bunny’s 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales.\n\nr> e>ft\n\n>»»{>{»\n\no\n\nAbove and right; Publicity for recent Bugs Bunny compilation features released by Warner Bros.

And getting more active and more charming ever since. As the Video Age has unfolded, Bugs’ progress has been toward a more and more active life, with new specials, surprise appearances, and new theatrical cartoons once again being prepared for the big screen, to compete with the vintage material being discovered and re-discovered by a wider audience every day. Bugs’ chief supervisor today is Edward Bleier, President of the Animation Divi¬ sion for Warner Bros, in New York, and he was an ABC network executive when The Rabbit first went on the air in his evening time slot in 1960; he was in charge of Sat¬ urday morning programming when Bugs switched to that time period, and he built the network’s Saturday morning schedule around “that Oscar-winning rabbit” and his cronies; going to work for Warner Bros in 1969, “It was a simple switch,” he says, “to the opposite side of the desk.” It’s been his job since then to make sure that Bugs has stayed active—or, as he puts it, “to protect the legacy and make the most of it; but also to do what I could to create new material, to keep Chuck and Friz and Mel gain¬ fully employed, and also to develop a new generation of talents.” Bugs has nearly always been in the company of Freleng, Jones, and many of the other artists who originally nurtured him (such as Bob Givens, who designed him for A Wild Hare and went on contributing to the design aspect of many of the later com¬\n\nAbove; Studio politics: the Bugs-\n\npilation features).

Below: The current Bugs Bunny news¬ paper comic strip, written by\n\nKathleen Helppie-Shipley, Bugs’ immediate supervisor on the West Coast, remembers becoming acquainted with the character on his Tuesday night prime-time show, when it was still frequently possible to see cartoons in theaters. Hiring talented artists from the same age group with the same experience of the Warners menagerie and the same affection for it—fans-turned-animators like Darrell Van Citters, Terry\n\nBrett Koth, combines a contem¬\n\nLennon, and former animation historian Greg Ford—she is currently attempting, in\n\nporary look with a design based\n\nher words, “to bring the characters into the ’90s—not just update them, slap a guitar\n\non the classic theatrical cartoons.\n\non Bugs: he was hip and contemporary in the ’40s and ’50s, and we’re maintaining the character integrity and translating that to the ’90s.’” The Bugs Bunny daily newspaper comic strip, operated by its syndicate since the early ’40s as a separate enterprise from the cartoons, was eventually brought under the direct supervision of Van Citters at the Warner Bros. Animation Division, for an overhaul in which its graphics were improved and its humor made “more personalitydriven” than it had sometimes been in the past. And, as new projects are planned today, that is where the conentration has remained: keeping Bugs true to the character audiences know from a daily exposure and making him fresh for new generations who don’t live in the ’50s; keeping his ver¬ bal humor as acute as his sight gags, so that his appeal works on two levels and hits all ages simultaneously.\n\nDear Santa : I have been very gooc/ all year long.

Talks are under way to get Bugs back to the prime-time television spot he appears to deserve, and, says Bleier, “I have no greater ambition than to find the right idea for a theatrical feature. We can’t simply do a theatrical feature, because the cartoons are so ubiquitous; we have to find something that is sufficiently different and compelling to be a theatrical feature. We’re looking, and we’re looking hard.” Sometimes, out of the talent and enthusiasm involved, the ideas grow faster than the realities of the marketplace can encompass them. “I frustrate everybody,” Bleier admits, ‘‘because they still want to do even more production. And I keep saying, ‘I’m finding new markets. . . .” Through ongoing production that Bugs has clearly influenced (the Roger Rabbit films, for instance, and the upcoming Tiny Toons series, featuring the next generation of Warner cartoon characters) the Bugs Bunny legacy survives and endures. But more importantly, despite all odds. Bugs Bunny himself survives and endures. “When I started working with him,” confesses Bleier today, “I liked him; he was very good. But I had no idea that I was working with an American folk classic.” Yet that has become, year after year, the increasingly inescapable fact. Bugs Bunny, one character or many, foole or hero, cartoon or cartoonist, has survived the death of the medium that spawned him, to go on giving us pointers in being the best that we can be.

But, since Elmer had Maltese, Pierce, and Foster writing for him and making him look ridiculous was their job, he seemed to be going out of his way to put words in his mouth that would trip up his tongue. So it’s not enough that he’s got to shout, “You wascawwy wabbit!” at Bugs at every oppor¬ tunity; in Stage Door Cartoon he grows erudite enough to refer to him as “You tweachewous miscweant.” And his threat to Bugs and Daffy in Beanstalk Bunny, “I’ll gwind your bones to make me bwead” has enough trouble striking terror into the heart, without his topping it off, once he’s found a pepper mill that should do the trick, with the pleasantry, “This oughta gwind their bones vewy nicewy.” Elmer, like Bugs, was truly born and fully fleshed out in A Wild Hare, and so shares Bugs’ Jubilee celebra¬ tion with him. Polls have shown that Fudd is still a popular character, scoring higher with adults than most of the child-oriented imaginary characters like the Muppets and the Sesame Street bunch. In Friz Freleng’s estimation, “Elmer Fudd wasn’t really a villain. He was a pit¬ iful character. There was no credit to a guy who could outsmart Elmer Fudd. You wondered why you didn’t hate Bugs for doing what he did to him. You had to invent new opposition for Bugs, because Elmer was just a victim of a smart rabbit.” By 1942 the Warners Toonsmiths used him in reversals or spoofs of the familiar rabbit-hunter situation, as they did in The Hare-Brained Hypnotist, The Old Grey Hare, Hare Re¬ mover, Rabbit Fire, Hare Brush, and What’s Opera, Doc? Without changing the basic nature or concept of the character, Elmer’s directors and animators developed him into a creature capable of great elasticity, especially in Hare Remover and Hare Tonic. He eventually reached the point where his derby could become as expressive as Bugs’ ears if the occasion warranted it, hopping, bouncing, and twirling around when his face and body were incapable of communicating all of his inner turmoil.\n\nPreceding pages; Because every story requires conflict, and every Warner Bros, cartoon story required being pared down to two characters, max, all of Bugs’ “friends” are characters trying to do him in, as Chuck Jones illus¬ trates in a drawing created for this volume.

When Elmer was coerced into getting on a stage and performing in Any Bonds Today?, it was the start of a new lease on life for the character.

Finally, that became his only function, and, in cartoons like Wideo Wabbit and Person to Bunny, his roles became limited to performance situations in which\n\nhe only belonged because he didn’t fit, and Elmer became an unlikely Mr. Show Business, like Durwood Kirby, Ringo Starr, and Ed McMahon.

With Porky, Daffy is one of only two major Warner Bros, cartoon stars to be established before Bugs, rather than, like most of them, in the wake of his success. Daffy started life as the target of a hunter’s rifle, just as Bugs did, and became a comedian through a totally unexpected reaction to that fact. Daffy went on to become the lunatic fringe of his own cartoons, just as Bugs became the moral center of his. Before comic fireworks could be set off by a confrontation between them, one of the characters would have to undergo a reversal of comic sympathy, to go from being the character we laughed with to being the character we laughed at. And it was inevitable, in the combined process of development and deterioration that constitutes the life of a cartoon character, that it would be Daffy who would change, that he would become a parody of himself. As Tex Avery saw Daffy Duck in the late ’30s, he was the expression of raw, vital energies. As Friz Freleng and Chuck Jones see him in the ’50s, he’s just a maladjusted mallard.

So for these two to enter into any kind of conflict, it became necessary to make Daffy jealous of The Rabbit’s success, to turn him into a black lago duck. The BugsDaffy relationship is one that, like W.C. Fields’ famous hatred for Charlie Chaplin, started out in terms of the highest admiration (in Porky Pig’s Feat), and progressed easily and quickly into a feud. Like another famous Fields feud—his long-running battle with Charlie McCarthy—it was good for business. Daffy’s plots against Bugs could even backfire and trip him up, with no participation from The Rabbit whatsoever. Didn’t matter. Daffy would still snarl and mutter, “So that’s the way he wants to play, huh?” “He is a creature of infinite error,” says Chuck Jones of Daffy. “You have to draw him frame by frame, because with each frame he makes a different mistake. Daffy can be fawning and overbearing at the same time, which isn’t easy! He rushes in and fears to tread at the same time. To me, he’s the most complex character of all. I sus¬ pect that I am much more like Daffy than I am at all like Bugs. Within us dwell dreams and realizations. Daffy is a realization. Bugs is a dream. So you have recognition in one character and aspiration in the other.”\n\n103\n\nBugs and Daffy and Elmer 1951 1952 1953 1955\n\nRabbit Fire Rabbit Seasoning Duck! Rabbit, Duck! Beanstaik Bunny This Is a Life? 1956 A Star Is Bored 1960 Person to Bunny\n\nWhen Chuck Jones and Mike Maltese had their\n\nBig Yes meeting\n\nfor Rabbit\n\nSeasoning in November of 1950, they worked up the following dialogue for Bugs and Daffy to exchange after they had dived into Bugs’ rabbit hole for cover: DAFFY: BUGS:\n\nI wonder if Elmer is still around. I know a way to find out.\n\nDAFFY: Well, do it. BUGS HOLDS DAFFY UP THRU HOLE. THERE ARE SHOTS. DAFFY COMES BACK INTO HOLE AND SAYS: I asked for that. As the same sequence emerges in the completed film, it’s amplified in the fol¬ lowing way: BUGS: DAFFY:\n\n(Whispers) Take a peek up and see if he’s still around. (Whispers) Righto!\n\nDAFFY HOISTS HIMSELF UP UNTIL HIS HEAD IS ABOVE GROUND LEVEL. SHOTS ARE HEARD. HE DROPS BACK INTO THE HOLE. BUGS: DAFFY:\n\nIs he still dere? (Dazed, his beak blasted into a magpie schnoz, in a Mel Blanc fraz¬\n\nzled voice) Sthtill lurking about! BUGS: DAFFY:\n\nI tell you what: You go up and act as a decoy and lure him away! (No longer sure what’s being said) No more for me, thankth! I’m dri-\n\nvin’! (Drops) The first exchange was funny enough. As the scene finally reaches the screen, the basic comedy of the original idea is maintained, embellished with new jokes and new shadings on the original joke, so that three or four gags are going on at one time. This is the basic reason for the long-standing affection these cartoons have acquired over the years: the way that Bugs’ attitude. Daffy’s ineptitude, and Elmer’s naivetude highlight, overlap, intensify, and ricochet off each other. Rabbit Seasoning is the second entry (bracketed by Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rab¬ bit, Duck!) in a splendid series of cartoons written by Maltese and directed by Jones, chronicling the attempts by Daffy Duck to convince Elmer Fudd that it’s rabbit sea¬ son and that he’d better blast Bugs before his time runs out. Through machinations he initiates but can never quite keep track of. Daffy repeatedly winds up being the target himself, and has to keep retrieving his beak from the wrong side of his head. Somehow, this always prompts him to decide that it’s Bugs who is “desthp/'cable.” It is the most famous authentic trilogy in the history of American studio animation. As Bugs and Daffy shove the barrel of Elmer’s gun back and forth at each other, their gestures reveal their differences: Bugs is so definite about his position when he insists the season is “Duck” that his index finger judiciously applied is enough to steer the barrel appropriately; as Daffy yells “Rabbit!” he has to leap at the gun in a panic and shove it away with both fuss-and-feathered hands. Through insights like this, what becomes apparent is that Bugs is rooted in the forest, secure in his place there. Daffy is still trying to figure himself out. Each wants to be the object of whatever season it isn’t, but Bugs never loses sight of who he is. When Daffy does, he’s dead. Writer Richard Thompson sees the series this way: “Both Bugs and Daffy are con men and talkers, but Daffy talks too much . . . Bugs stands back from a situation, analyzes it, and makes his move; Daffy becomes emotionally involved, loses his dis¬ tance, and blows it.” The rooted Bugs soon figures out that there must be some root cause for Daffy to bring all this fire and brimstone upon himself, that maybe there’s something in him that likes this punishment. (“Shoot me again, I enjoy it!” Daffy screams in semi¬ confession at one point. “I love the smell of burnt feathers and gunpowder and cor¬ dite!”) Bugs quickly realizes that the easiest option is to get The Duck to prompt his\n\nAbove; Scenes from Jones’ Rabbit Seasoning; Bugs and Daffy try to play mind games on each other.

Just a little finagling, and he’ll have Daffy screaming, “I demand that you shoot me now!” And as long as Elmer’s around, he’ll get his wish. The comedy of Elmer, used simply as a dupe, is that he seems unable either to comprehend or to enter into the debate, and becomes a sort of reliable idiot automa¬ ton, firing on cue—like a computer that puts “gzortenplatt” up on the screen because the buttons for those letters were pushed. If Bugs can convince Elmer it’s baseball season, he’ll run off shooting at a baseball. In these conflicts, as Roger Bullis put it, the forest eventually “seems more like a vaudeville stage,” in which “the forest creature ends up pursuing the unsuspecting hunter . . . The woods has turned into a Never-Never Land where the hunter shoots when told to do so by the hunted creatures, where the animals delight in semantic contests, and where giant elephants appear at a moment’s notice.” Below.' Scenes from Chuck Jones’ Duck! Rabbit, Duck!, 1953. The proliferation of seasons grows truly Byzantine, with Elmer finally convinced by Bugs, as the most implausible game warden in the history of charades, that, in spite of snow on the ground, it’s really baseball season and he should be hunting baseballs. Daffy finds to his chagrin that it’s actually duck season, and comes to the conclusion that this makes Bugs “deshpicable!’\n\nLeft; Cameraman Ken Moore photographing Duck! Rabbit, Duck! in 1952, with a pile of Daffy Duck cels at the ready. Personality animation is still, in spite of years of technical advances, an irretrievably frameby-frame process, with the ani¬ mator making the key drawings for each movement—after scores of story, concept, and layout sketches have already been made and exposure sheets and! or bar sheets filled out, to indi¬ cate the way the writer, the director, and the layout person envision the scene, and model sheets have been prepared to demonstrate the way each char¬ acter should look in a variety of poses. The action will still not look smooth until the in-between drawings have been made by the animator’s assistant(s), linking up the key drawings in a com¬ pleted movement. These draw¬ ings are sometimes filmed, producing a pencil test, which can be projected and studied to ensure that the action is smooth and convincing; but this stage is often bypassed when the produc¬ tion is short on time and!or funds. The animation drawings are finally traced in ink on transparent sheets of acetate (celluloid at one time, giving rise to the name “cef’), then painted in color, or opaqued, on the reverse side. After that, they are ready to be photographed, one at a time, usually at the rate of two frames of film per cel over painted backgrounds, as Ken Moore is doing here.

In a move to counteract the insistent insipidity of Elmer Fudd, to find a char¬ acter explosive enough to engage in combat with the unfazable rabbit, Michael Maltese, Friz Freleng, and Hawley Pratt designed Yosemite Sam with an eye to making him as small a character with as big a voice as they could imagine, all noise and a yard high. Maltese remembered, “I was going to call him Texas Tiny . . . Wyoming Willie . . . Denver Dan. We were deliberately going for a location to make it Western. So I called him ‘Yosemite Sam.’ I had never been to Yosemite, but ‘Yosemite Sam’ sounded right. He could almost steal the picture from Bugs. His temper was larger than he was . . .” With characteristics attributed variously to Freleng and to The Terrible-Tempered Mr. Bang from the old “Toonerville Trolley” comic strip, Sam was an instant success. “We didn’t try to make him likable,” says Freleng, Sam’s exclusive director for most of Termite Terrace’s operation. “We did just the opposite; we made the meanest char¬ acter in the whole world. But they liked him in spite of that. Guys like Yosemite Sam snapped up your picture, because Sam was such a violent character, and he didn’t have to stop and think and plot, like Elmer did.” Freleng also confirmed what Mel Blanc always claimed about Sam’s voice being the “roughest, toughest” voice in his entire repertoire: “When he yells like Yosemite Sam, boy, he can tear the walls down!” Sam underwent perhaps less evolution than any other major character in car¬ toon studio history. As he appeared in his first film, Hare Trigger—roaring at Bugs, “I’m Yosemite Sam! The meanest, toughest, rip-roarin’est, Edward Everett Hortonest hombre, what ever packed a six-shooter!”—so he would remain, essentially unchanged, for the next forty years of his life. (Although his origins may precede his name and the proper color scheme: the Southern sheriff in Stage Door Cartoon is mighty close to the eventual Sam.) Once Bugs heard his opening line (or whatever variant was dreamed up for the adventure at hand), he sized up his opponent and figured out the most expedient line of attack. Sam would rage on, red hair ablaze, putting on a magnificent show; but as his dialogue revealed, as well as any explosion that blasted away his hat and singed his moustache (as in Buccaneer Bunny), there was very little underneath all that shrubbery.\n\nAnimation critic Greg Ford has described it best: “Yosemite Sam was risible and fallible by virtue of his over-aggressiveness, outwittable and outsmartable by virtue of his easily galled and consternated, anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better desire to prove his gumption and gusto; in High Diving Hare, Bugs Bunny can hornswaggle Yosemite Sam again and again to do those dare-devil, death-defying dives from the platform’s dizzying heights by simply daring him to ‘step across this line’ (‘Ah’m a’steppin’,’ Sam would foolhardily say, and down he’d go).” When Jailer Sam locks Prisoner Bugs in his cell in Big House Bunny, it takes little convincing on Bugs’ part to sell Sam on the idea that he’s locked Bugs out and himself in. He’s quick to reverse the situation—but too quick to pay attention to the fact that he had it right the first time. Sam too has been a victim of the studio’s penchant for self-satire, in scenes like the opening of Rabbitson Crusoe, where his serrated, unpolished voice is heard on the soundtrack, narrating the story of his shipwreck and survival on a South Seas island in the kind of florid seventeenth-century prose appropriate to Defoe’s original hero, doing what might politely be described as the most unsuccessful James Mason impression on record. Seemingly designed to show off the combined wonders of the Technicolor pro¬ cess and the RCA soundtrack, Sam came equipped with two built-in absurdities. Mel Blanc pointed out one of them: “He’s a little cowboy from Yosemite—which is in Cal¬ ifornia—but he talks like a Texan.” The other came about because he was conceived as a Western holdup man, and was given a black mask shading his eye area, with both eyeballs jutting wildly out from the shadows. But to keep the character from being trapped in the Western milieu. Friz and his story men in subsequent pictures put him on a pirate ship, south of the Mason-Dixon line, in the middle of the Sahara desert, in a medieval castle, and even in ancient Rome—and wherever Sam went, there went his Lone Ranger mask, however preposterous, incongruous, or anachronistic; the lit¬ tle guy’d look naked without it.\n\nAbove.’ Sam realizes the girl he was about to marry was Bugs Bunny in these great animation drawings by Virgil Ross for Friz Freleng’s Hare Trimmed, 1953.

Out of this thinking emerged the Martian who was eventually tagged Marvin, an alien equipped with firepower enough to blast the planet Earth out of his way on a whim, and with the strength and endurance of string cheese. Marvin never gets bombastic or pretentious about the bomb he plans to detonate and destroy Life As We Know It. He gets no surge of power contemplating the havoc he is capable of wreak¬ ing; he only fusses when his “Illudium Pew-36 Explosive Space Modulator” (which he over-articulates, as if we were likely to confuse it with a similar device) isn’t right where he put it—in a voice apparently borrowed from the scientist who fed Bugs his vitamin-fortified carrots in Super Rabbit. A pedantic Martian is the great concept here. Bugs is usually forced to conquer this extraterrestrial foe without the aid of impressive hardware or software, without the use of anything digital or anything with silicon in it. He fights back as the Brooklynese version of the Heckling Hare always did—with a sense of humor, Joie de vivre, and his spunky variety of Yankee ingenuity. And by turning his own weapons against him. Bugs has defeated Marvin as soon as he’s upset his concept of the universe. Bugs Bunny’s cartoons with Marvin raise the possibility that when we encounter alien life forms, we may have a thing or two to tell them, whether they are a more “advanced” race than we are or not.\n\nFrom Chuck Jones’ Hare-Way to the Stars, 1958.

Coyote 1952 Operation: Rabbit 1956 To Hare Is Human 1960 Rabbit’s Feat The Bugs Bunny Show: # 1595,# 1591 • 1961 Compressed Hare 1963 Hare-Breadth Hurry\n\nWhen trickster tales were told by the Southwest American Indians, it was the Coyote, not the Heckling Hare, who starred. But there was one important difference in the way the stories worked: in American Indian folklore, as in Warner Bros, car¬ toons, the Coyote had a tendency to get caught in his own traps. Wile E. Coyote is so clever that, when Bugs puts a combination lock on his rab¬ bit hole in To Hare Is Human, the Coyote erects a window near the spot, so that he can break in and pick the lock. Chuck Jones’ contests between his two favorite characters create not the comic combustion of a duo like Bugs and Yosemite Sam, but the static tension of a chess tournament between mismatched players. Bugs’ repeated “Checkmates”, delivered with express train speed and nitroglycerine force, highlight the comic counterpoint that is going on in this competition: between self-assurance and self-importance, between being centered and being self-centered, between a cool head and cold logic. This contest is no contest. As Bugs notes, “Even a genius gets the message after a while.”\n\nAbove; Wile E. Coyote is not quite certain how to react when Bugs greets him with “Daddy! You’re back from Peru!!” in this Chuck Jones layout for his cartoon Rabbit’s Feat, 1960.

The first is the search for ever more mindless, ever more ferocious antagonists for Bugs. If Yosemite Sam is a better answer than Elmer Fudd, then the next logical step is a growling beastie, viciousness unadulterated by awareness. The second is the quest for more and more remote, unpredictable cartoon characters, the attempt to get away from the endless cats and dogs and mice. As Bob McKimson remembered the genesis, “That was when Sid Marcus was writing for me, so we were kicking around different types of characters, and I said, ‘About the only thing that we haven’t used is a Tasmanian Devil.’ He said, ‘A what?’ He didn’t even know what they were. And so we just started talking about it and came up with this character.” The reason that McKimson did know what a Tasmanian Devil was had to do with the fact that he “worked a lot of crossword puzzles, and these things came up every once in a while . . .” This was the kind of quest that resulted, in the Jones unit, in the creation of the Roadrunner and the Coyote, and like those characters, “Taz Boy” has a name that is incidental, subordinate to his species. Baroque enough that there should be such a cartoon character as a Roadrunner or a Tasmanian Devil; a name would just be excess baggage. When Mel Blanc began to develop a voice for this new character, he asked, all innocence, “What does he sound like?” and was told, “Nobody has ever heard one.” So he was compelled to ad-lib some kind of guttural gravelly gargle, once transcribed as “—eccawchkupkekupke—.” Blanc testified that the experience of doing this one “doesn’t make me jump with joy. I’ll tell you that!” In a way, this sense of a primordial destructiveness made Bugs’ most ferocious opponent his biggest pushover, as well as the most graphic illustration of Joel Chan¬ dler Harris’ dictum that brains would always win out over brawn. Because “Taz Boy” falls for any ploy Bugs Bunny can think up. In Dr. Devil and Mr Hare, Bugs shows “Taz” an abstract painting and says, “Look at this mirror.” He wilts. There is no trick too obvious, no disguise too transparent, no gag too old to bring the Tasmanian Devil to a complete and utter halt, his drooling growl transformed into a look of absolute confusion, his Yosemite Sam ferocity instantly reduced to the most total be-Fudd-lement.\n\nElements from Robert McKimson’s Tasmanian Devil cartoons.

Junior Bear: Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears, 1944.\n\nI have chosen sixteen films, which for me capture just about everything that is great about Bugs Bunny as a character. This list has been compiled through careful consideration, the screening of every Bugs Bunny film at least once, and con¬ sultation with the present staff of Warner Bros. Animation as well as several outside experts. But, finally, it is my list. For every fan of Bugs Bunny there would probably be a different list of “Greatest Hits.” The fact that this list is being published in a book does not mean that its maker presumes it is the only such list possible, or that its maker is unaware that there are plenty of Bugs Bunny cartoons left over which have engendered more than their share of admiration and affection. One could just as easily include, for instance, Racketeeer Note-.\n\nRabbit, Gorilla My Dreams, Acrobatty Bunny, A Wild Hare, Long-Haired Hare,\n\nTor¬\n\ntoise Wins By a Hare, Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears, Stage Door Cartoon, Hare Trigger, Hare Tonic, The Big Snooze, High Diving Hare, A Hare Grows in Manhattan, Sahara Hare, Duck! Rabbit,\n\nDuck!, Broomstick Bunny, Rabbit Fire, AH Baba Bunny,\n\nand any one of about fifty other pictures. The Bugs Bunny car¬ toons are probably best remembered as the greatest and most prolific series of car¬ toons in the history of animation, and I have singled out a few isolated examples which, for me, indicate how great certain entries in that series could be. Description is my aim, not prescription. By leaving out what is perhaps your particular favorite Bugs Bunny cartoon I have not attempted to imply that your judgment is warped, or that you don’t know Bugs Bunny. I have said only, “I love these cartoons, I think they’re great films, and here’s my best explanation why.” And I’m sticking with that.

The teaming works perfectly. Bugs referring to his antagonist as “Gulliver” and “Shorty,” having a great time beating out solos on his eardrums and starting a fire at his hairline. The Giant can crush the little rabbit with one hand, but when he tries it. Bugs calls out from inside his clenched fist, “My! What an interesting palm you’ve got. Doc!” and the big oaf can’t resist it. Set in Giantland, a bizarre, surreal land¬ scape where it is night and day simultaneously, as in Lewis Carroll’s “The Walrus and the Carpenter',' Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk takes on the atmosphere not of a fairy tale, but of an\n\nallegory—a darkling plain where the picayune defeat the\n\nSupervision by I.

It’s not as if Bugs’ victory is cut and dried. “I’m so smart sometimes it almost frightens me,” he boasts when he talks the Giant into a duel, realizing that his oppo¬ nent’s twenty paces will take him halfway around the world and well out of his own harm’s way. But some earth-shaking tremors tell Bugs he’s miscalculated; the twenty paces are enough to walk the bozo all the way around the circumference of the globe, and he’s patiently counting out the last few steps as he looms on the opposite horizon. Whether Bugs can defeat this behemoth just by being a quicker thinker is pointedly the object of the game. “You think you’re pretty C-A-T smart, don’t ya?” the Giant taunts Bugs, trapping him inside what is for him a normal-sized drinking glass. But Bugs, hermetically sealed in this container, spontaneously generates not only\n\nFrames from the finished film.\n\nBelow; Bugs, faced with superior\n\nthe glass cutter that will save his life, but the showcards that will make it look like entertainment—the last one reads, “Back in 15 minutes,” a span the lummox pre¬\n\nstrength and firepower times\n\npares to time out with precision on his wrist-grandfather clock while The Rabbit makes\n\n100, gets the best of the Giant\n\nhis getaway.\n\nand has him enjoying it.

It’s become everything from a visual meta¬ phor for the nature of the American character, to a ritual test of manhood, to a path to immortality. Like the American West, the baseball diamond has charted out a cinematic territory of its own. So it’s a natural for the Great American Cartoon Star to take his turn at bat in the Great American Game, and just as natural for him to turn out one of his wildest pictures. The game between the Gas House Gorillas and the Tea Totalers is, perhaps inevitably, leaning toward the former, with an imposingly wide margin. In a gag that got laughs all over the Directed by I.

Bugs, wearing a straw boater and holding his carrot in a hot dog bun, tosses the Gorillas a heckle that he could beat them single-handed, and they take him up on it. After that, it’s Bugs Bunny in every position in the field, proving The Rabbit is quicker than the eye—and when he’s not, he’s got a trick to convince you he was. As usual, once he’s up against the brutes, all’s fair, and once he’s dazzled them with his footwork, his unearthly slow pitch leaves them stunned.

He throws in his glove to make the catch for him, his success called by the game’s umpire, who is clinging to the side of the Umpire State Building like he lived there, and by the Statue of Liberty, who chimes in with a radio tagline, and whose decision we must assume is final. This cartoon was completed and shipped to New York by the studio in June of 1945, before the end of World War II, but not seen on theater screens till February of 1946, after peace had been declared.

I said to my girlfriend just the other day, ‘Gee, I’ll bet mahnsters are innteresting,’ I said. The places you must go and the things you must see—myyy stars ...!’’ But taking this line out of context plunders it of most of its humor. It’s not a one-line zinger, it’s a brilliant bit of character development posing as satire. In Hair-Raising Hare, this line isn’t just said, it’s whined, in a nasal imitation of every small-talking shopgirl that still rings true forty years after its invention. It’s Mel Blanc doing Bugs Bunny doing a manicurist, and, true to form. Bugs is a manicurist. And part of the comedy is his sud¬ den decision to be a manicurist at just that instant: he’s in a castle ten times more evil than Macbeth’s, having just come so close to falling in a pit the depth of the Grand Canyon that he’s Directed by Charles M.

This is the moment he picks to make the beast self-conscious over, of all things, his unsightly fingernails, prompting Bugs to materialize a manicurist’s stand out of nowhere and provide, not just the manicure he seems so convinced this monster needs, but—as if it were one of the tools of the trade—the small talk to go with it. And aid¬ ing and abetting this unlikely strategem is the fact that it proves to be just the ticket, just bonkers enough to work, nothing this nightmare apparition has ever encountered before and so nothing he’s prepared to handle, and he’s flummoxed into submission like a doused firestorm. The moment when he first meets the monster (later named “Gossamer”) is another classic in personality and comic timing. Bugs has just come into this castle out of the night, bringing nothing with him, and heard the beast from behind a closed door. “Well, so long!” he replies, and proceeds to pack (an act which involves removing towels from a dresser and placing them in a suitcase, then putting a hat from a hatrack on his head and slinging a bag of golf clubs over his shoulder—all to the tune of “California, Here I Come,” of course). “And don’t think it hasn’t been a little slice of Heaven,” he declares for a parting shot, “’cause it hasn’t!” Then suitcase, hat, and golf clubs fly in the air, as he makes a mad dash for the front door. Hair-Raising Hare’s director. Chuck Jones, has singled out this cartoon as some¬\n\nthing of a milestone, in his own career at least: “I no longer drew pictures of Bugs; I drew Bugs, I timed Bugs, I knew Bugs, because what Bugs aspired to, I aspired to. Aside from a few stumbles. Bugs and I were always at ease with one another.” It’s the picture that Bugs opens by musing, “Did ya ever have the feeling you was bein’ watched?” Turns out he’s on television (in 1946, before anybody was on tel¬ evision, except Franklin Roosevelt). Being watched by Peter Lorre. And about to be lured to his Evil Scientist’s castle (with a blinking neon sign to put all doubts to rest: “Evil Scientist”). By a wind-up sex goddess. Whom he follows crouched like Groucho. The film’s pattern is to switch from terror to amusement repeatedly, and most of the jokes become media references. Before he’s through. Bugs begins to refer to himself as “Our Hero,” after the manner of dime novels, and to give himself stage directions. He calls his monstrous opponent first “Frankenstein,” then “Dracula,” finally scaring him away by making him self-conscious a second time—pointing out the peo¬ ple in the audience looking right at him. Then Bugs gets tamed himself, in a finale that has “Tedd Pierce” written all over it: another of those wind-up sex goddesses saunters by, and he’s a goner. “So it’s mechanical!” he exclaims, and shifts gears to follow her like a wind-up Bugs. Though the surface subject of this cartoon is a monster in a mad scientist’s lair, the hidden subject is play-acting—media figures and what they do to our heads.

It is incredibly sim¬ ple-minded: Bugs Bunny, interrupted by carrots and a mouse, gives a cut yet definitive performance of the most familiar of Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsodies (The Second) . . . The best of it goes two ways: one, very observant parody of concert-pianistic affectations, elegantly thought out and synchronized; the other, brutality keyed into the spirit of the music to reach greater sub¬ tlety than I have ever seen brutality reach before.

I have always very much liked this particular eruption of Liszt’s, and though it made me laugh, the laughter was without patronage, far less scorn. After seeing its guts torn out in this movie short I knew more about it, and liked it better, than ever.” As Freleng remembers doing this film, “I started with Bugs Bunny and a piano. I had Jakob Gimpel, the famous pianist, play ‘The Hungarian Rhapsody’ for me, but I really wasn’t sure what I was going to have Bugs do. To snap up my animation, I had Gimpel play this at a speed that he had never dreamed of playing it in his life. His fingers were bleeding by the time I got through with him. But he enjoyed doing it very much. “If there was a pause in the music, I had something happen there. I just kind of built this, like a guy making a painting. He keeps adding, and he keeps touching\n\n,/\n\nA\n\n11\n\nWHH\n\ndk spl ked\n\nthe blue here and a little green here, until he has a satisfactory painting. That’s the way I built a cartoon.” Terry Lind was painting the backgrounds for this production by April of 1946, at which point the animation tests had wowed the rest of the department, and it was already clear that a very special Bugs Bunny entry was on its way. The color spe¬ cialists at the Technicolor laboratory would at this time work closely with the layout people from the animation department to ensure that the colors coming up on the screen were a good match for the colors coming off the brush. Everyone at Termite Terrace was duly awed by the quality the lab was coming up with (and until you’ve seen one of the original theatrical three-color Technicolor “imbibition” 35-millimeter prints of one of these cartoons on a big screen, you haven’t really experienced them in their full majesty). But a logjam was being created by the amount of work that Technicolor was being saddled with—far in excess of what they were equipped to handle—cou¬ pled with drastic wartime restrictions on film stock, and it seemed to Warner Bros, cartoon staffers in this immediate post-war period that scenes they had animated or painted weren’t coming up on the screen until a year or so later. Tex Avery was a witness when the folks at Technicolor, evidently stressed out,\n\nAbove and next five pages: Ani¬\n\ndelivered one day’s Rhapsody Rabbit footage by mistake to the MGM cartoon unit,\n\nmation drawings by Virgil Ross.\n\napparently confusing it with a disturbingly similar Tom & Jerry cartoon, on which Bill\n\n140\n\nHanna and Joe Barbera were then pinning their Academy Award hopes for 1947. When Bugs Bunny came up on the MGM screen, it was Hanna and Barbera who were dis¬ turbed first: a project much like theirs was apparently closer to completion over at Termite Terrace, and it was clearly going to be an Oscar contender for 1946. The Tom St Jerry cartoon, finally titled Cat Concerto, was rushed through the studio’s produc¬ tion process and put up for Academy consideration in the spring. (It was not theatri-\n\n!\n\n\\\n\n\\ \\\"'skjiv\n\n''S\n\n3\n\nsy\n\n1\n\nt\n\nr\n\n\\\n\n(\n\nI\n\nt f\n\ni\n\nO\n\ns\n\n>\n\ncally released until April of 1947.) That year’s crop of animated short-subject Oscar contenders was screened for the Academy, and then it was Friz Freleng’s turn to be disturbed. “When they drew the rotation out of a hat,” he remembers, “my cartoon was run after theirs, unfortunately for me. And the audience thought / stole from them. They got a nomination for it, and I didn’t. But I felt that was one of the outstanding things I had done. I enjoyed doing it.” Hanna and Barbera got more than the nomination; they copped that year’s ani¬ mated-shorts Oscar. Friz had to content himself at the time with the personal con¬ gratulations of Jack Warner, relayed to him by Ed Selzer. But Rhapsody Rabbit is, in fact, generally recognized as one of the most enjoyable of all Bugs Bunnies and, in open defiance of the stuffiness of its setting, savagely funny.\n\n“Get your hot buttered popcorn, folks!” Bugs calls out in the middle of this cartoon. “Get it while it’s hot!

But this is championship boxing. Bugs Bunny style, and no trick is too low, no charade too preposter¬ ous to pull off in full view of a thousand spectators and for the benefit of a radio audience. Before the 110 rounds of this match are over, “Bugsy” has feinted fainting, spilled the horseshoes out of his gloves, cracked a plank to convince the Champ he’s cracked a leg, masqueraded as a doctor, slammed his opponent with a boulder in a slingshot, shot himself out of an archer’s bow, and, finally, cut the motion picture film he’s printed on. Much of this is not covered by the Marquis of Queensberry. He’s also pulled one of his cleverest bits of “stragedy”; slammed to the mat. Bugs grabs the sportscaster’s microphone and begins describing action that’s not taking place—all of it so much in his favor that it wears down the Champ’s resistance. “The Champ is confused,” says Bugs, and his description is get¬ ting warmer. “Bugs lands a beauty to the solar plexus!” calls Bugs, and the Champ tries to ward it off, flinching from its impact at the very thought. “The Champ is groggy!” shouts Bugs, getting more feverish, making up so many “rabbit punches” the Champ can’t figure out where they’re all coming from, and finally, “The Champ is down!” and he is. Apparently in an effort to save money, the artists have excluded the referee from all this, so no holds are barred in the Anything Goes rationale that is peculiarly War¬ ner Bros. But Chuck Jones and his animators treat these low proceedings in high style, putting a sleek, classy polish on the down and dirty action. When the Champ decides to call Bugs’ bluff, he hurls him in a Keatonesque straight line from his rabbit hole through the locker room—and apparently into the closest available pair of shorts— directly into the stool at the right corner of the ring, in four swift, stylishly angled, sharply perspectived shots of his aerial progress. In the impudence of adding artistic style to low-down comedy, it’s the dirtiest tricks that call for the cleanest action.\n\nFrames from Rabbit Punch. Bugs tries to get into the spirit of the thing, but the Champ is somewhat more experienced. Finally, using a few unconven¬ tional methods, he manages to stun the Champ and gain the advantage over him.\n\n147\n\nThe title derives from Jack Benny’s feature Buck Benny Rides Again, but the action has nothing to do with Jack Benny,\n\nor the bumbling Easterner caught with his chaps down that Benny plays in his comedy. Bugs starts this cartoon tall in the saddle (whether he’s actually on a horse is immaterial) and stays there till the end of its breathless but flawlessly timed seven minutes. Yosemite Sam bursts into the Western saloon and throws out his imposing (and totally unnecessary) challenge, “Now, be there any livin’ varmint as aims t’ try t’tame me??? Welllll, be there????\"\n\nAnd Bugs answers with a long, laconic roll of a cigarette, a droopy-lidded glance, and a self-confident “/ aims t’.’’ The roll of the cigarette was one of Freleng’s favorite stretches of per¬ sonality animation, performed by Virgil Ross for Hare Trigger, Featuring Yosemite Sam.

Then Bugs shouts back a challenge of his own, the old entertainer’s standard, “Take it, Sam!” and Sam, put on the spot, takes it—on the chin, finally, so whipped up by his own high spirits that he sends himself on a high-kickin’ grand finale barn¬ stormer exit, straight down a mine shaft. In a way, this whole cartoon takes off around that one gag, a series of dances out of nowhere, rhythms foolishly surrendered to, then cold-bloodedly cut off in mid-beat, first countered, then counterpointed, then contrapunted, then drop-kicked into left field. Bugs gets Sam to step over the edge of a cliff, then looks alarmed, races down the mountainside to reach ground level ahead of him, produces a mattress to cushion his fall. “You know,” he confides—the offscreen slide whistle telling us Sam’s still plummeting—“sometimes me conscience bodders me.” Then he removes the mat¬ tress, remarking, “But not dis time!”—and Sam’s a pancake.\n\nBelow and below right; Virgil\n\nHorses appear from behind rocks, and Bugs and Sam race back and forth across\n\nRoss does Bugs Bunny as Gary\n\nWestern buttes like pinballs across the table, set against “The William Tell Overture”\n\nCooper.\n\nand the Turneresque orange and purple skies of Paul Julian.

Galloping down canyon roads, the unusual tracking shot following first The Rabbit through a tunnel, then The Bandit into it, total darkness for a second, a quick shot of Bugs laying bricks not quite preparing us for the EXPLOSIVE two frames of Sam’s impact with a finished brick wall at tunnel’s end. More time to take in his stunned, protracted fall, as Bugs admires his handiwork. It’s Freleng and Freleng’s Bugs at their best, secure in their footing no matter how fancy their footwork.\n\nThis page; Frames from the fin¬ ished film: Bugs buffaloes Sam by going into his dance a little more vigorously than the badman had in mind, then coaxing\n\nhim into one even better; by has¬ tily erecting a brick wall at tun¬ nel’s end; and by getting him on the first train out of town—the Miami Special, full of bathing beauties.\n\nElmer Fudd walks grandly through Central Park, ignor¬ ing A1 Jolson, turning up his nose at Bing Crosby, waving Eddie Cantor on. But the next sight to greet his eyes brings the sparkle back to them. “Bugs Bunny!” he exclaims. “Why are you hangin’ awound with these guys? They’ll never amount to anything!” Self-parody in 1950. Documentary reality on TV today— Jolson, Crosby, and Cantor a conglomerate nonentity to most of the audience; Bugs the only celebrity left in the scene. Bugs and Elmer on a vaudeville stage.

Released as a Bugs Bunny Special in the Looney Tunes Series June 17, 1950.\n\nBut we do like it. “Gee, it floored ’em.” All part of legend now, like “You ain’t heard nothin’ yet” and “Come up and see me sometime.” Bugs’ theme song, “What’s Up, Doc?” was written by Carl Stalling by Novem¬ ber of 1944, and became the grand finale of this Robert McKimson cartoon in 1950. McKimson’s best Bugs Bunny is also the best of The Rabbit’s facetious “life stories.” At first glance, this cartoon has more than a little in common with Singin’ in the Rain, the great MGM musical of two years later: the same struggle to the top, heard in terms of “dignity, always dignity,” but seen as a series of camp indignities; the same air of cavalier mockery-as-tribute toward the last generation’s favorite hokum; the same idiotically pat climaxes, no less lovable for being idiotic, and no less idiotic for having the ring of truth. Could it be that someone at MGM’s Arthur Freed unit had a light bulb go on over his head when he saw this picture? Or was it just that, after a decade of Alexander’s Ragtime Band, Hollywood Cavalcade, The Al Jolson Story, Blue Skies, and Till the Clouds Roll By, parody was the next logical step? When they won’t accept the old corn anymore, give it a roast until it pops, and they’ll eat it up. Get it while it’s hot, get it while it’s buttered. In making What’s Up, Doc?, the boys at Termite Terrace were reconciling two absolute truths of show business: you must love the thing you’re lampooning, and all hokum must be played absolutely straight. Bugs’ story, told in the musical-comedy format that had become Hollywood tradition, is just like everything else about Bugs. It becomes something to cherish by starting out as a spoof of something we used to cherish—Once Upon a Time.\n\nRight.- Elmer waves on Eddie Cantor before discovering that he’s in the celestial presence of Bugs Bunny.

Lovers of film comedy everywhere find Rabbit of Seville something to get excited about, something worth keeping a copy of, worth savoring, worth sharing, worth learning from. We wish they wouldn’t cut it for television, and we hope the original negative is kept in good condition so that it will be around for our children, and for our children’s children. Animation historian Greg Ford has already amplified his admiration for a single moment from this masterwork in the magazine Film Comment, saying, “There was surprisingly little levity ever levelled at Fudd’s bald pate, but the baldness was as permanent a fixture in the weakling image of Elmer as was the timorous r’s-and-/’s-to-w’s ailment in the milksop speech of Fudd, and it must have been predestined that a note on Elmer’s hair¬ Featuring Elmer Fudd.
