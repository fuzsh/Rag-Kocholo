        "text": "@Daffyrocks That was a 1997 airing\n\nThe interesting part is they aired that one and Porky’s Ant in the kids block “Go Cart” along with Which is Witch and Caveman Inki, not in the adult targeted block “Cartoon Blob”. They were uncut. I also saw Wideo Wabbit with the Groucho Marx scene uncut before they replaced the print.\n\nAnother thing I want to point out, Chaser on the Rocks on Rai 2 was in English. On Italia 1 it aired with the m/e track (no beep beep). This before the early 2000s when they replaced the prints.\n\nI watched a lot of rare shorts like Shamrock and Roll, Big Game Haunt and such. Unfortunately I need explicit permission from WB in order to have a copy of the past airings. I hope to get it one day.\n\nFYI, Little Orphan Airedale, 1947 on Boomerang Streaming Service was released as an EU 1995 print (Note: English Audio Track has 1941-1955 MWRA unlike the US print, which has its original ending music cue retained)\n\nEDIT: There is also a second theory - the US print of this short may have also altered ending music cue on its original audio track.\n\nIn Polish TV channels, Crowing Pains, 1947 was aired in two different versions (one is slightly edited):\n\nBoomerang Europe / CEE had a minor cut in the final scene, when sun is rising: http://chomikuj.pl/mag341/filmy/baj...c+kto+pieje+ostatni+PL,5183653838.rmvb(video)\n\nTV Puls / Puls 2 meanwhile aired this short uncut and uncensored on its 1995 print: http://chomikuj.pl/izebel/Filmy/Ani...e*2c+kto+pieje+ostatni,1646498330.rmvb(video)\n\nFYI, Little Orphan Airedale, 1947 on Boomerang Streaming Service was released as an EU 1995 print (Note: English Audio Track has 1941-1955 MWRA unlike the US print, which has its original ending music cue retained)\n\nEDIT: There is also a second theory - the US print of this short may have also altered ending music cue on its original audio track.\n\nIn Polish TV channels, Crowing Pains, 1947 was aired in two different versions (one is slightly edited):\n\nBoomerang Europe / CEE had a minor cut in the final scene, when sun is rising: http://chomikuj.pl/mag341/filmy/baj...c+kto+pieje+ostatni+PL,5183653838.rmvb(video)\n\nTV Puls / Puls 2 meanwhile aired this short uncut and uncensored on its 1995 print: http://chomikuj.pl/izebel/Filmy/Ani...e*2c+kto+pieje+ostatni,1646498330.rmvb(video)\n\nI am just saying, but maybe the original USA Turner print had the original reissue end title theme kept as well. We know that the Brazillian copy from this video uses the 1946-1955 LT end music, but one theory I have is that the Brazillian dubbing was edited, and it is the only US Turner copy to have the LT end music. This particular Brazillian dubbing may have been done on an older print (with the \"original\" reissue titles intact), and then synced to the newer \"dubbed\" print. And that's why the end music doesn't match with the initial USA Turner print.\n\nAgain, this is all just an assumption of mine, but it could really be the case.\n\nAlso, who in their right minds would censor a few seconds from a fade-out scene?! (I am talking about the \"Crowing Pains\" print from Boomerang CEE). I just realised it now, as I never noticed the differences before.\n\nWhat a mistake (probably) did Canal+ when they aired Oily Hare. The opening and ending music cue were low-pitched on its PAL print (in 25fps, its runtime is 6:52), while everything between credits was played with correct high-pitched audio.\n\nThat happens on every redub (French one has it too)\n\nThe French redub of Frigid Hare, which has the old music-and-effects track, actually has micro-cues from the new one. (at 5:14 and 5:21)\n\nNow, I'm wondering: Why didn't they just completely use the new m/e track??"
