        "text": "^Let's not say this here\n\nBy the way, this could be unrelated, but Hop Skip and a Chump is absolutely the worst Dubbed print. It's like a 2 Strip Technicolor print with blue turning into red.\n\nThe second one was taken from my own Laserdisc transfer and it was the old a.a.p. print.\n\nSome of the awful ones are The Hare Brained Hypnotist, Gorilla my Dreams and A Wild Hare which luckily were restored.\n\nThe Unruly Hare, Along Came Daffy and Count Me Out are really good instead.\n\nDon't forget, some pre-48 cartoons with best-looking \"dubbed versions\" such as Bugs Bunny Rides Again, Birth Of A Notion and Acrobatty Bunny have been restored, fortunately.\n\nAll restored prints look far superior to the dubbed versions and any other unrestored transfers beforehand (MGM Laserdisc, Cartoon Festivals VHS, Oldest a.a.p. prints)\n\nHere's another 1945 Bugs short, this time it's \"Hare Tonic\" (Jones). Really bad print here. Also includes the Bugs in Drum signoff with dubbed notice.\n\n...it got deleted.\n\nI managed to get a glimpse of the video before it got deleted from Dailymotion; With the Dubbed Version print at its original pitch and length, and the 1992-2004 CN logo at the bottom right of the screen, it is definitely a US Dubbed Print. Another hint that it is a US print is the Bugs In Drum signoff with Dubbed notice has red border around it, since the EU Dubbed Print has the Bugs In Drum signoff with Dubbed notice without any borders.\n\nI agree with ya Nodog, Hare Tonic is one of the worst-looking Dubbed Version prints I have ever seen, since I still see a lot of bad red tints and disfigured colors in the print. Luckily this cartoon has been restored for DVD/Blu-Ray.\n\nLeft: US Dubbed Version/Right: EU Dubbed Version\n\nAttachments\n\nUS vs EU Hare Tonic.png\n\nSo in the Asia-Pacific countries they use the same transfers as for the MGM/UA Home Video tapes/laserdiscs - but on Cartoon Network and Boomerang they showed Dubbed Versions. On Cartoon Network Asia I saw a mix of USA and European Dubbed Version prints. And surprisingly the US Dubbed prints are time-compressed in the Asia-Pacific countries that use PAL format.\n\nDuring my childhood years when I saw Looney Tunes on Cartoon Network Asia before 2005 these are the following pre-48 shorts that I had seen (all are 1995 dubbed versions);\n\n1. Super-Rabbit (US Dubbed Version)\n\n2. Tom Turk & Daffy (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n3. To Duck Or Not To Duck (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n4. Toy Trouble (US Dubbed Version, without censorship)\n\n5. Elmer's Pet Rabbit (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n6. Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt (US Dubbed Version)\n\n7. Daffy Duck & The Dinosaur (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n8. Acrobatty Bunny (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n9. Along Came Daffy (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n10. The Cagey Canary (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n11. Rabbit Transit (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n12. Little Red Riding Rabbit (US Dubbed Version)\n\n13. Bugs Bunny & The Three Bears (US Dubbed Version)\n\n14. What's Cookin' Doc (US Dubbed Version)\n\n15. Hiss & Make Up (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n16. Bugs Bunny Gets The Boid (US Dubbed Version)\n\n17. Hare Ribbin (US Dubbed Version, without censorship)\n\n18. Hare Trigger (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n19. Trap Happy Porky (EU Dubbed Version, without censorship)\n\n20. Tweetie Pie (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n21. Catch As Cats Can (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n22. Hollywood Daffy (US Dubbed Version)\n\n23. Baby Bottleneck (Censored EU Dubbed Version)\n\n24. The Old Grey Hare (US & EU Dubbed Versions, alternated)[*b]\n\n25. Hare Tonic (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n26. Bugs Bunny Rides Again (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n27. I Taw A Putty Tat (Censored EU Dubbed Version)\n\n28. A Gruesome Twosome (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n29. Hare Conditioned (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n30. The Wise Quacking Duck (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n31. Sports Chumpions (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n32. Easter Yeggs (US/EU Dubbed Version)[*a]\n\n33. Flop Goes The Weasel (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n34. Hare Remover (EU Dubbed Version)\n\n35. Birth Of A Notion (US Dubbed Version)\n\n[*a] = The 1995 Turner dubbed versions for both the USA & European prints look identical.\n\n[*b] = CN Southeast Asia aired both the USA and European Dubbed Versions alternated with one another, no joke.\n\nWhen CN Southeast Asia re-ran Looney Tunes for a short while in late-2009, the channel aired remastered prints of Daffy Duck & The Dinosaur, Acrobatty Bunny, Bugs Bunny & The Three Bears, Baby Bottleneck, Hare Tonic, Bugs Bunny Rides Again, Hare Conditioned, Easter Yeggs, A Gruesome Twosome and Hare Remover, as opposed to the Turner prints previously used.\n\nSorry but the capture from the left looks a bit fake to me. Just look at the CN bug and you can see that it's clearly selected and pasted from the right capture shot. I may be wrong, thought.\n\nWell the thing is both captures were what I saw during my childhood on CN Southeast Asia, but since there is no PAL version of the US Dubbed Print of The Old Grey Hare video with the CN logo on the top right existing on the internet, the capture on the left would most likely be a re-creation of what I remembered from my childhood. I'm not sure whether its an accurate re-creation, though.\n\nSorry for the Double Post, but:\n\nFor unknown some undubbed shorts like \"Rhapsody in Rivets, 1941\", \"Double Chaser, 1942\" were aired with Turner Dubbed 1995 ending credits (despite the no dialogues used in those shorts).\n\nEvery pre-1948 Looney Tunes short is given a color-correction by Turner Entertainment in 1995 to make them more marketable for the modern television era (a similar treatment received to the MGM classic cartoons) since these pre-48 shorts probably were suffering severe film aging by that time, especially when Turner had no access to the more superior original negatives of the cartoons.\n\nThese dubbed versions use the 16mm dupe negatives of pre-48 Looney Tunes shorts that Turner have in the vaults. The best-looking dubbed versions (e.g. The Unruly Hare, Bugs Bunny Rides Again, Along Came Daffy, Ain't That Ducky) probably use the MGM VHS/Laserdisc prints as footage source. Some dubbed versions look horrible (e.g. Falling Hare, Hare Tonic, Plenty Of Money And You, Cross Country Detours) because they probably use the oldest a.a.p. prints as footage source. One particular short, Hop, Skip and a Chump, its dubbed version look as if it has been sourced directly form a very old a.a.p. print without any restoration work done at all."
