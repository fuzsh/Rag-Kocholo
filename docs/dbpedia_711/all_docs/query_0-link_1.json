        "text": "This is an incomplete list of Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies characters.\n\nA[]\n\nA. Flea[]\n\nA. Flea is a flea that appeared in two Merrie Melodies cartoons. He first appeared in An Itch in Time, and then in A Horsefly Fleas. He is often seen singing his famous \"Food Around the Corner\" song. As revealed in his second appearance, the \"A.\" stands for \"Anthony.\"\n\nAngus McCrory[]\n\nAngus McCrory is a kilt-wearing Scotsman who appears in My Bunny Lies over the Sea, who challenges Bugs Bunny to a game of golf, after he destroys his bagpipes.\n\nHe later appeared in The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries episode \"It's a Plaid, Plaid World,\" and made a cameo appearance in Space Jam, during the basketball playoff between the Monstars and the TuneSquad.\n\nAnother cameo made by McCrory was in a TV special about Merrie Melodies shorts that dealt with sports themes, where clips of My Bunny Lies Over the Sea were shown. McCrory, along with Bugs and Daffy, are candidates for an award of \"World's Greatest Sportsman.\" At a dinner presenting the award, they are told all have lost. All three are enraged at losing and for being the only three candidates for the prize and having traveled the world over to prove it, only to be told that a fourth candidate has won; that being Foghorn Leghorn, who won for playing every sport in his own back yard.\n\nHe was also seen in the Animaniacs episode \"Dot's Quiet Time.\"\n\nB[]\n\nBabbit and Catstello[]\n\nBabbit and Catstello are cats based on the comedic duo Abbott and Costello. Although the short, fat character calls the other one \"Babbit,\" the tall, skinny one never addresses his partner by name; the name \"Catstello\" was invented later. In their first three cartoons, the \"Babbit\" character was voiced by Tedd Pierce, and Mel Blanc performed \"Catstello.\"\n\nOriginally, the pair were cats in pursuit of a small bird for their meal in the 1942 Bob Clampett-directed cartoon A Tale of Two Kitties, a cartoon notable for the first appearance of the bird character, who would eventually become Warner Bros. cartoon icon Tweety Bird. The hapless duo fail in every attempt to capture the bird, establishing the pattern that would be used time and again in future Tweety cartoons.\n\nThree years later, Babbit and Catstello reappeared in the similarly named Tale of Two Mice, directed by Frank Tashlin. Though their characterizations were the same, the two were now mice, living in a hole in the wall of a typical cartoon kitchen. Their goal in this cartoon was the cheese in the kitchen's refrigerator, the only obstacle being the resident housecat. Babbit attempts to coerce Catstello (often by beating him up) into going after the cheese solo, using various methods to get it (which involved Catstello getting hurt). However, in the end, it is Swiss cheese, which Babbit can't stand. Angrily, Catstello beats him up and begins force-feeding the cheese, uttering one of his archetype Lou Costello's famous lines: \"Oh—I'm a baaaaad boy!\" (At one point in A Tale of Two Kitties, he similarly remarks, \"I'm a baaaaad pussycat!\")\n\nThe characters make a very brief cameo appearance in canine form in Robert McKimson's second Warner Bros. short Hollywood Canine Canteen released in April 1946. They play the pets of the real Abbott and Costello, Costello's dog, refers to Abbott's dog as \"Babbit.\"\n\nFinally, six months later in October 1946, Robert McKimson returned to the pair in The Mouse-Merized Cat, wherein Babbit uses a book to hypnotize Catstello. Babbit has Catstello believe he's a dog in order to scare off the cat so they can get to the food in the refrigerator. However, the cat soon studies hypnosis and is able to reverse Babbit's spell. This results in Catstello running back and forth between the two as they continue use hypnosis. Finally, Catstello becomes fed up with Babbit making him the fall guy, and turns the tables on both Babbit and the cat, hypnotizing them into believing they are, respectively, a cowboy and his trusty steed. Catstello trickes Babbit with his Yosemite Sam like voice makes Babbit utter a deliberately misworded variation on the Lone Ranger's classic catchphrase—\"Hi yo, Sliver, awaaayy!\"—before he and the cat gallop away. The final scene shows Catstello eating cheese and reading a book on living alone, before turning to the audience and once again reciting \"Oh—I'm a baaaaadd boy!\"\n\nThe pair have made few appearances since then, mainly cameos in modern Warner Bros. animated projects such as The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries voiced by Jim Cummings and Joe Alaskey.\n\nBarnyard Dawg[]\n\nMain article: Barnyard Dawg\n\nBeaky Buzzard[]\n\nBeaky Buzzard is a buzzard (although he more closely resembles a vulture or condor) with black body feathers and a white tuft around his throat. His neck is long and thin, bending 90 degrees at an enormous adam's apple. His neck and head are featherless, and his beak is large and yellow or orange, depending on the cartoon. Beaky bears a perpetual goofy grin, and his eyes look eternally half-asleep. His unnamed mother, who appears in Beaky's first two cartoons, appears similar to Beaky, though she is considerably larger than most Looney Tunes characters.\n\nBoth Beaky and Mama Buzzard first appeared in the 1942 cartoon Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid, directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon's plot revolves around the hopeless attempts of Beaky, here called Killer, to catch Bugs Bunny for his domineering Greek mother (voiced by Sara Berner) back at the nest. Beaky's voice was modeled after ventriloquist Edgar Bergen's character Mortimer Snerd, earning Beaky the nickname \"Snerd Bird.\" The voice itself was provided by voice actor Kent Rogers.\n\nClampett brought the characters back in the 1945 film The Bashful Buzzard, a cartoon that closely mirrors its predecessor albeit without the presence of Bugs. This time Beaky's hapless attempts to bring food back for his Mama (again voiced by Berner) continue until he accidentally targets a dragon. Rogers reprised his role as the character's voice for the film, but he died in a Naval aviation training accident at Pensacola before finishing all his dialogue, so Stan Freberg was brought in to finish the work (as was Eddie Bartell, according to some[who?] sources).\n\nWarner Bros. apparently thought they had something in the character, and Beaky was featured in much of the Looney Tunes Merchandising of the time. He also appeared in several issues of Dell Comics' Looney Tunes series of comic books, usually paired with another minor player, Henery Hawk.\n\nClampett left the studio in 1946, ending Beaky's career for a time. The character was eventually brought back in the 1950 Friz Freleng film The Lions Busy, now voiced by the versatile Mel Blanc. Freleng made the buzzard smarter, pitting him against a dim-witted lion named Leo. Bob McKimson also featured the character in a film that year, Strife with Father. McKimson's Beaky is again back to his idiotic self, this time under the tutelage of his adoptive father, a sparrow who is trying to teach Beaky how to survive in the wild.\n\nBeaky Buzzard had a cameo in the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"High Toon.\" He was also the basis for the series character Concord Condor (both Beaky and Concord were voiced by Rob Paulsen). He later appeared in the films Space Jam (1996, as a team player) and 2003's Looney Tunes: Back in Action (as an Acme pilot), and is voiced by Joe Alaskey in both films.\n\nBeaky (again voiced by Alaskey) and Mama (voiced by Tress Macneille) guest starred in the The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries episode \"3 Days & 2 Nights of the Condor.\" Sylvester attempts to steal Tweety from Beaky's family by disguising himself as a buzzard, but the scheme backfires when Mama Buzzard falls madly in love with him, chases him and finally subdues him in a mating ritual. Sylvester attempts to escape after Granny absent-mindedly leaves him behind at the airport, but Mama Buzzard catches him at the last second and embraces him into the credits.\n\nBeaky later appeared in Duck Dodgers (voiced yet again by Alaskey).\n\nBeaky Buzzard appeared in the video games Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time and Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 4.\n\nBeaky Buzzard appears in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"Ridiculous Journey\" voiced by Jim Cummings. He works as a rescue buzzard who rescued Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz from the desert and brought them to his slow-moving balloon. When Blacque Jacque Shellacque attacks and cuts the balloon, Beaky Buzzard tries to save Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz only to end up caught in one of Blacque Jacque Shellacque's nets.\n\nBeans the Cat[]\n\nthumb|180px|right|alt=A black cat in white overalls|Beans as seen in Hollywood Capers Beans the Cat was the third Looney Tunes cartoon character star after Bosko and Buddy. Created by Leon Schlesinger, Beans is most likely modelled after Waffles, a feline from the Van Beuren Studio, as both characters are black-furred cats in overalls.\n\nHe made his first appearance in the Merrie Melodies cartoon I Haven't Got a Hat (1935), along with Porky Pig who would have a much longer run in the series. He then made a cameo in The Country Mouse, another Merrie Melodies release that year.\n\nFinally, six months following his debut film, Beans starred in A Cartoonist's Nightmare which would be his first solo cartoon, followed by Hollywood Capers. Beans then began appearing with characters from the cast of I Haven't Got a Hat.\n\nFeatured on screen in only a couple of years, Beans appeared in just 9 shorts. His swan song was Westward Whoa in 1936. Before being retired completely, he made a brief appearance in Plane Dippy.\n\nBeans was voiced at first by Billy Bletcher and sometimes by Tommy Bond.\n\nBig Bad Wolf[]\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf is a character that appeared in numerous Looney Tunes shorts, in varying incarnation. He first appeared in Pigs in a Polka opposite his traditional foes, the Three Little Pigs, and also appeared in a jazzier version of the same story in Three Little Bops over a decade later.\n\nThree other shorts feature the character as \"Uncle Big Bad,\" with a young sycophant of a nephew. The three \"Uncle Big Bad\" shorts were The Turn Tale Wolf, Now Hare This and False Hare, the last two of which featured Bugs Bunny as the wolf's foil.\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque[]\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque was created by Robert McKimson. While similar in many ways to Yosemite Sam—both are short in stature and temper—Blacque Jacque possesses his own unique characteristics, not the least of which is his comically thick French Canadian accent, performed by Mel Blanc. Also, like Yosemite Sam and many other villains, Blacque Jacque Shellacque does not have a high level of intelligence, preferring to use force instead of strategy to fight Bugs.\n\nBlacque Jacque first appeared in Bonanza Bunny, which takes place in the middle of the Klondike gold rush. Blacque Jacque attempts to seize Bugs' bag of gold (actually \"a bunch of rocks and some yellow paint,\" according to Bugs) through card cheating, trickery, and out-and-out threats, but Bugs outwits him as always and defeats him by replacing his bag of gold with gunpowder while poking a hole in the bag and tossing a lit match on it causing a massive explosion.\n\nBlacque Jacque later clashed with Bugs in 1962's Wet Hare, in which his illegal damming of a river (\"Me feel like pezky little beav-aire!\") brings him into conflict with the rabbit—not only because he is committing a crime, but because he has blocked off the waterfall that Bugs uses as a shower. After demolishing several of Blacque Jacque's dams, Bugs turns the tables by damming the river upstream of Jacque's dam. Jacque, unsurprisingly, is enraged and wheels a small cannon along the riverbed to destroy Bugs' dam—but when he does he only reveals another dam further upstream. Jacque blows up several of Bugs' dams in succession and finally follows Bugs all the way to the \"Grand Cooler Dam\" (a pun on the name of the Grand Coulee Dam). Jacque tries to blow it up with his cannon, but the dam is so massive and thick that the cannonball he launches ricochets back into the cannon's barrel and the recoiling force lands both Jacque and the cannon into the back of a waiting paddy wagon and is arrested for trying to blow the dam.\n\nBlacque Jacque also appears as a common enemy in Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time.\n\nBlacque Jacque Shellacque appears in The Looney Tunes Show voiced by Maurice LaMarche. In this show, Blacque Jacque Shellacque is the cousin of Yosemite Sam. In the episode \"It's a Handbag,\" his picture is seen in a police notebook alongside the pictures of Baby-Faced Finster, Hugo the Abominable Snowman, Rocky and Mugsy, Yosemite Sam, two characters that resemble Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street, and mugshot cameos by Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone. In \"Ridiculous Journey,\" Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hunting Hugo the Abominable Snowman in Alaska when he turns his attention towards Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz and pursues them. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them on a train heading south and starts hunting them. Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz escape him by detaching the cars that are connected to the train. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then finds them in the cars of the Three Bears and tries to grab them until Baby Bear throws him out of their car and off the Golden Gate Bridge. Blacque Jacque Shellacque catches up to them in the desert when they end up in the desert and ends up cutting Beaky Buzzard's balloon. Blacque Jacque Shellacque then goes on the attack and manages to catch them. It turns out that Blacque Jacque Shellacque was hired by Bugs Bunny and Granny to rescue them upon the two of them being hooked up by Yosemite Sam.\n\nBosko[]\n\nMain article: Bosko\n\nBruno[]\n\nBruno is a gray dog who is Bosko's pet. He has a resemblance to Disney's Pluto.\n\nBuddy[]\n\nMain article: Buddy (Looney Tunes)\n\nBugs Bunny[]\n\nMain article: Bugs Bunny\n\nBunny and Claude[]\n\nBunny and Claude are two carrot-robber rabbits based on the real-life bank robbers couple Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow and the then recent film version that had been released by Warner Bros. They are a well-dressed rabbit male (Claude) and female (Bunny) duo who are always pulling off carrot heists, and their catch phrase is \"We rob carrot patches,\" based on the film Bonnie and Clyde's \"We rob banks.\"\n\nBunny was voiced by Pat Woodell and Claude was voiced by veteran WB voice actor Mel Blanc. They both speak with pronounced Southern accents.\n\nThey appeared in two cartoons produced by Warner Bros. Animation and released by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1968, titled Bunny and Claude: We Rob Carrot Patches and The Great Carrot Train Robbery (the latter was held over to 1969). Both films were directed by Robert McKimson, and were the first two cartoons he directed in his comeback to Termite Terrace.\n\nBunny and Claude were always chased by a stereotypical Southern Sheriff (also voiced by Mel Blanc, his voice sounding similar to Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam), who would always pursue them in his police cruiser even though the gangster rabbits would always foil his plans.\n\nC[]\n\nCecil[]\n\nCecil is a turtle. Though he made only three theatrical appearances, Cecil is remarkable in that he is one of the very few characters who was able to beat Bugs Bunny, and the only one to do so three times in a row and at the rabbit's own game.\n\nCecil was introduced in the short Tortoise Beats Hare, released on March 15, 1941. Even from the cartoon's opening titles, Avery lets on that Bugs Bunny is about to meet his match. Bugs wanders onto the screen munching his obligatory carrot and absent-mindedly begins reading the title card, grossly mispronouncing most of the credits, such as // for \"Avery\" rather than the correct //. When he finally gets to the title itself, he becomes outraged, tears apart the title card, and rushes to Cecil Turtle's house. He then bets the little, sleepy-eyed turtle ten dollars (equal to $160.88 today) that he can beat him in a race. Cecil accepts Bugs' bet, and the race begins several days later. Bugs races away at top speed just before finishing the shout of, \"Get on your mark, get set, go!\" Cecil quickly (for him, anyway) goes to a public telephone and calls up Chester Turtle. After talking to Chester about the bet, he tells him to call \"the boys\" (cousins), and tell them to be ready when he comes to their position, and to \"give him the works.\" Chester calls the relatives, all of whom look and sound like Cecil (some have deeper voices, some have higher voices), and relays the message. As Bugs runs relentlessly toward the finish line, Cecil and the other turtles take turns showing up at just the right moment to baffle the bunny. In the end, Bugs is convinced he has won, only to see Cecil (or one of his kin) across the finish demanding the money. Bugs suggests that he has been tricked, and all nine turtles approach and reply, \"It's a possibility!\" Voice actor Mel Blanc supplies Cecil's drowsy drawl.\n\nTortoise Beats Hare follows one of the many folk variants of the Aesop fable \"The Tortoise and the Hare\" in which the faster beast is deceived by look-alikes placed along the course.[1] More directly, it is Avery's parody of the 1935 Disney Silly Symphony, The Tortoise and the Hare. Avery left Warner Bros. before he could produce any new cartoons featuring Cecil. However, he introduced a similar character in 1943 named Droopy. Droopy would even take some of his tricks from his slow-and-steady predecessor, such as using his relatives to help him outsmart a wolf and a Bulldog.\n\nBob Clampett took Avery's scenario and altered it for his film Tortoise Wins by a Hare released on February 20, 1943. The title is an appropriate pun on \"hair.\" Bugs again challenges Cecil to a race after viewing footage from their previous encounter two years earlier (which seems to depict Cecil as having won fairly instead of by cheating Bugs with his cousins). Bugs then goes to Cecil's tree home disguised as an old man (a parody of Bill Thompson's \"Old Timer\" character from Fibber McGee and Molly) to ask the turtle his secret. Cecil, not in the least bit fooled by the disguise remarks, \"Clean livin', friend. Clean livin'....\" And then reveals his streamlined shell lets him win, and produces a set of blueprints for his \"air-flow chassis.\" The turtle ends the conversation with the comment, \"Oh, and another thing... Rabbits aren't very bright, either!\" just before slamming the door in the enraged bunny's face. Not getting the hint that the turtle's story is a humbug, Bugs builds the device and prepares for the race. Meanwhile, the bunny mob learns of the upcoming match-up and places all its bets on Bugs (\"In fact, we don't even think that the toitle will finish... Do we, boys?\" \"Duh, no, Boss, no!\"). The race begins, and Bugs still outpaces his reptilian rival. However, in his new get-up, the dim-witted gangsters mistake him for the turtle. Cecil reinforces this misconception by dressing in a gray rabbit suit and munching on some delicious carrots. The mobsters thus make the shelled Bugs' run a nightmare, ultimately giving the race to Cecil (in an aside to the audience, as the rabbits cheer him, Cecil remarks, \"I told you rabbits aren't very bright!\"). When Bugs removes the chassis and sobbingly reveals that he's the rabbit, the rabbit mobsters remark in mock-Bugsy style \"Ehhh, now he tells us!\" upon realizing their mistake and commit suicide by shooting themselves with a single bullet that goes through the sides of all of their apparently soft heads (the final gag is often cut when shown on basic cable television but can be found uncut on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1).\n\nCecil and Bugs would have one final match up in Friz Freleng's cartoon, Rabbit Transit, released on May 10, 1947. The title is a play of Rapid Transit. Unlike Tortoise Wins by a Hare, this cartoon presumes that Bugs and Cecil have never met before now. While relaxing in a steam bath, Bugs reads about the original fable and, as he did reading the credits of Tortoise Beats Hare, becomes incensed at the idea of a turtle outrunning a rabbit. Cecil, also in the steam bath, claims that he could outrun Bugs, prompting Bugs to challenge him to a race (again, as in Tortoise Beats Hare, although at least here Bugs receives some provocation). This time, Bugs and Cecil agree to no cheating. Cecil, however, quickly reveals that his shell is now rocket propelled, allowing him to go a surprising combination between fast and slow. Bugs does his best to steal, dismantle, and destroy the device, but all to little effect. In the end, however, Bugs does manage to top the turtle and crosses the finish line first. Nevertheless, it is Cecil who has the last laugh when he rooks the rabbit into confessing to \"doing 100 easy\"—in a 30-miles-per-hour zone. Bugs is taken away by two police officers that arrived at the scene. Cecil closes out the cartoon by saying Bugs' famous line, \"Ain't I a...um...stinker?\" Iris-out.\n\nThe Warners directors retired Cecil after his third showdown with Bugs. Nevertheless, Cecil made occasional cameos in later projects. His only notable Looney Tunes short cameo came in 1954's Devil May Hare, which was directed by Robert McKimson, Sr. and pitted Bugs against the Tasmanian Devil (who made his debut here).\n\nCecil later made a cameo in an episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, as well as a brief appearance in the 1996 film Space Jam. He also appeared in the 2003 DVD Looney Tunes: Reality Check where his voice now provided by Joe Alaskey. In addition, he appears some issues of the Looney Tunes comic book.\n\nCecil appeared in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"Customer Service\" voiced by Jim Rash. Bugs and Cecil are once again enemies like the classic shorts. He is seen as a customer service representative at the Trans-Visitron cable company. He ends up taking off the cable service from Bugs Bunny and ends up angering him more when he demands that the cable company restores his cable. This leads to Bugs Bunny to quote \"of course you realize, this means war.\" When Cecil goes out to work, Daffy tells him to be back by 2:30 or he'll be fired. Cecil finds Bugs Bunny disguising as a female worker at Coffee Hut and Bugs ends up doing comeuppance on Cecil as he tries to get back to work. Bugs even disguises himself as an elevator operator to delay Cecil. When Cecil makes it to his floor, Bugs Bunny disguises himself in a full costume disguised as a future being and tells him that he must restore Bugs Bunny's cable. After the ruse is done and Daffy Duck fires him, Bugs Bunny thanks Cecil Turtle for restoring cable service to him. This is the first time that Bugs is able to win against Cecil. Cecil Turtle makes a cameo in \"A Christmas Carol\" during the \"Christmas Rules\" song where he was punched by Tina Russo during her part of the song which states that \"New Year's was an awful scene.\" In \"The Shell Game,\" Bugs and Daffy accidentally back into Cecil where they find that his shell has cracks in it and he knows someone who can fix turtle shells. Cecil later calls up Bugs and tells him that the crack is worse while stating that he will need $2,000 to see how much can be dealt about the shells. Bugs goes to 4213 Helms Way to drop of the check for Cecil. Bugs arrives at Cecil's apartment and gives him the check. When Bugs asks Cecil what else he can do for him, Cecil asks Bugs to do his groceries. Unbeknownst to Bugs, Cecil is taking advantage of him. When Bugs returns with the groceries, Cecil is on the phone with his shell guy stating that he will need a new shell at the cost of $53,000.00. Bugs starts to get suspicious of Cecil and uses the internet to find that Cecil had been struck by cars many times. Porky comes in and tells Bugs about his encounter with Cecil. Bugs and Porky decide to visit Cecil to shut down Cecil's shell game. Cecil then holds them at gunpoint to keep them from turning the fake shell over to the police. Bugs tricks Cecil into sitting in Daffy's old recliner and is slammed into the wall enough to crack his shell for real. In the \"That's All Folks\" part of this episode, Cecil is in jail where he vows to have his revenge on Bugs Bunny.\n\nCharlie[]\n\nCharlie, Charlie the dog or Charles the Dog is an animated cartoon fictional character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes series of cartoons. Bob Clampett minted the scenario that Charlie Dog would later inherit in his cartoon short Porky's Pooch, first released on 27 December 1941. A homeless hound pulls out all the stops to get adopted by bachelor Porky Pig. Mel Blanc would provide the dog's gruff, Brooklyn-Bugs Bunny-like voice and accent which became Charlie's standard voice.\n\nHowever, as he did for so many other Looney Tunes characters, Chuck Jones took Clampett's hound and transformed him into something new. Jones first used the dog in Little Orphan Airedale (4 October 1947) which saw Clampett's \"Rover\" renamed \"Charlie.\" The film was a success, and Jones would create two more Charlie Dog/Porky Pig cartoons in 1949: Awful Orphan (29 January) and Often an Orphan (13 August). Jones also starred Charlie without Porky in a couple of shorts: Dog Gone South (26 August 1950) which sees Yankee Charlie searching for a fine gentleman of the Southern United States, and A Hound for Trouble (28 April 1951) which sends Charlie to Italy where he searches for a master who speaks English.\n\nIn these cartoons, Charlie Dog is defined by one desire: to find himself a master. To this end, Charlie is willing to pull out all the stops, from pulling \"the big soulful eyes routine\" to boasting of his pedigree (\"Fifty percent Collie! Fifty percent setter, Irish Setter! Fifty Percent Boxer! Fifty percent Doberman Pincher! Fifty percent pointer—there it is! There it is! There it is! But, mostly, I'm all Labrador Retriever!\") when reminded by others that he is not a Labrador retriever, his response would be, \"If you'll find me a Labrador, I'll retrieve it for you.\" —though in reality, he is just a slick-talking mutt who rarely realizes that his own aggressive obnoxiousness is sabotaging his appeal to any potential guardian.\n\nCharlie makes a brief cameo appearance (via re-used animation from Often an Orphan) in the Robert McKimson-directed short Dog Tales (1958). Jones shelved the Charlie Dog series of films in the 1950s, along with other characters he had introduced, such as The Three Bears and Hubie and Bertie. He was turning his efforts to new characters, such as Pepé Le Pew and Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner. However, recent Warner Bros. merchandising and series and films such as episodes of Tiny Toon Adventures, the film Space Jam (1996) in the crowd scenes (here performed by Frank Welker), and Tweety's High-flying Adventure (2000) in Italy have brought Charlie back out of retirement.\n\nThe Frisky Puppy character that Jones paired with Claude Cat in several '50s shorts bears a close physical resemblance to Charlie.\n\nCharlie Dog made a cameo appearance in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"Father Figures.\" He is seen at a pet store where he was attacked by Henery Hawk (who was looking for a chicken).\n\nCharles M. Wolf[]\n\nCharles M. Wolf (or as his wife calls him, Charlie) is a dimwitted wolf who appeared in only 1 cartoon in Hare-Less Wolf (1958).\n\nHis name is only given in the second feature and apparently spoofs Animator Chuck Jones, whose real name was Charles Martin Jones. His design was greatly simplified to make it look aardvark-like.\n\nClaude Cat[]\n\nClaude Cat (a pun on the homophone \"clawed cat\") had his origins in several other cat characters used by Chuck Jones from 1940 to 1945. These cats were mostly similar in appearance and temperament, with black fur and anxious personalities. For example, in the 1943 film The Aristo-cat (the character's first speaking role), Jones paired his unnamed cat against the mind-manipulating mouse duo, Hubie and Bertie.\n\nJones redesigned the neurotic feline for the 1949 film Mouse Wreckers (perhaps to distinguish him from Friz Freleng's popular puss, Sylvester). The short is another Hubie and Bertie vehicle, only this time, the antagonist they antagonize is Claude, drawn as he would appear in all future cartoons: yellow, with a red shock of hair and a white belly (his exact markings would vary from cartoon to cartoon). In this as in all future Claude Cat cartoons, Jones' careful attention to personality is easily evident. Claude is a nervous and lazy animal. His attempts to protect his home from the manipulative mice Hubie and Bertie prove futile as the rodents torment him by (among other things) putting aquariums in all the windows to make Claude think he's underwater or by nailing his furniture to the ceiling. Jones set the mice on Claude once more in the 1950 film The Hypo-Chondri-Cat. This time, the miniature Machiavellis convince the neurotic Claude that he's dead. Claude would run afoul of the mice once more in 1951's Cheese Chasers and against another mouse duo in Mouse Warming in 1952.\n\nJones added another idiosyncrasy to Claude's id in another 1950 film, Two's a Crowd. Here, Claude is scared out of his mind by a diminutive dog named Frisky Puppy, newly adopted by Claude's owners. The main theme, however, is jealousy as Claude's attempts to oust the intruder repeatedly fail due to the cat's intense cowardice - a running gag has Claude repeatedly shooting up and clinging to the ceiling after the pup playfully comes up behind him and barks. in a form of a series of loud yelps, in a high register. At the end, however Claude gets revenge by pulling the same trick causing the dog to comically leap up and cling to the ceiling. Jones repeated the scenario with slight variations in Terrier Stricken in 1952 and No Barking in 1954 (the latter featuring a cameo by Tweety Bird).\n\nIn future cartoons, Jones recast Claude as a silent villain, still possessing his full set of neuroses. This stage of the character's evolution is best exemplified by the 1954 film Feline Frame-Up. Here, Claude convinces his owner that fellow pet Marc Antony is trying to eat the precious kitten Pussyfoot. Marc Antony is tossed out, allowing Claude the run of the house. That is, until Marc Antony outwits the cat and makes him sign a confession admitting to his crimes.\n\nClaude was played by Voice actor Mel Blanc and after classic films, Joe Alaskey using a quirky, strangulated voice similar to that of Marvin the Martian (but without Marvin's precise enunciation).\n\nJones retired Claude in the late 1950s. He was concentrating on other characters, such as Wile E. Coyote and Pepé Le Pew. Nevertheless, the character enjoys some popularity as one of Jones' more humorous, if forgotten, creations.\n\nIn Bah, Claude Cat has a very brief cameo as an employee going home for Christmas.\n\nClaude Cat filmography (13 shorts):\n\nThe Aristo-Cat (1943) - with Hubie & Bertie & prototype-Hector; the feline's first appearance with the mice\n\nFin n Catty (1943) - Claude's first solo cartoon\n\nTrap Happy Porky (1945) - with Hubie & Bertie, prototype Hector, & Porky Pig; his only pairing with Porky Pig.\n\nRoughly Squeaking (1946) - with Hubie & Bertie & Hector the Bulldog; first time with Hector the Bulldog, & only cartoon where Claude doesn't use his familiar voice.\n\nMouse Wreckers (1949) - with Hubie & Bertie & Hector the Bulldog(cameo); Academy Award nominee.\n\nThe Hypo-Chondri-Cat (1950) - with Hubie & Bertie\n\nTwo's A Crowd (1950) - with Frisky Puppy; his first pairing with Frisky.\n\nCheese Chasers (1951) -- with Hubie & Bertie & Marc Anthony(cameo);his final pairing with Hubie & Bertie, & First pairing with Marc Anthony\n\nMouse Warming (1952) - with Hector the Bulldog(cameo); his final pairing with Hector & Claude's final solo cartoon.\n\nTerrier Stricken (1952) - with Frisky Puppy\n\nFeline Frame-Up (1954) - with Marc Antony & Pussyfoot; his first pairing with Pussyfoot & his final speaking appearance(at one line at the end)\n\nNo Barking (1954) - with Frisky Puppy, Tweety(cameo) & Marc Antony(cameo); his final pairing with Frisky\n\nCat Feud (1958) -- with Marc Antony & Pussyfoot; his final pairing with Marc & Pussyfoot & the final appearance of all three characters.\n\nClyde[]\n\nClyde is the nephew of Bugs Bunny. He has appeared in His Hare-Raising Tale, Yankee Doodle Bugs, and in the 1979 Christmas-themed short Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales.\n\nIn recent years he's been voiced by Joe Alaskey.\n\nColonel Shuffle[]\n\nColonel Shuffle is a character in the Looney Tunes stable, based in the Southern United States. He has been shown as fiercely loyal to this region and deeply offended by anything that he feels reminds him of the North.\n\nHe referred to himself specifically by name in Mississippi Hare (1949), following a game of poker in which he lost (three queens to four kings) and proceeded to let off a barrage of gunfire. Sometimes he is shown playing a banjo in classic Dixieland style.\n\nAmong his foils are Bugs Bunny (who defeated him) in Mississippi Hare and Charlie Dog (whom he defeated) in Dog Gone South (1950).\n\nShuffle played a prison warden in the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"Gang Busters\" voiced by Don Messick.\n\nConrad the Cat[]\n\nConrad the Cat starred in a few shorts in the 1940s all directed by Chuck Jones. He first appeared in the 1942 short The Bird Came C.O.D.[2] before featuring in Porky's Cafe (1942) and Conrad the Sailor (1942).[3] He was voiced by Pinto Colvig, the original voice actor of Goofy.\n\nCookie[]\n\nCookie was the flapper woman, who is a girlfriend for Buddy. Cookie may resemble the character Betty Boop. She has black hair and a white shirt and black shoes. She also has a baby brother named Baby Elmer (not to be confused with Elmer Fudd) who only made one appearance. In some shorts, Cookie has blond braided hair.\n\nCool Cat and Colonel Rimfire[]\n\nCool Cat is a tiger who wore a stylish green beret and scarf. Unlike most other Looney Tunes characters, Cool Cat was unapologetically a product of his time. He spoke in 1960s-style Beatnik slang and acted much like a stereotypical laid-back 1960s teenager — he was often seen strumming a Guitar or traveling cross-country in his dune buggy. One cartoon — McKimson's Bugged by a Bee — depicted him as an alumnus of \"Disco Tech\" playing varsity football against the long-haired team from \"Hippie University.\". He is voiced by Larry Storch.\n\nHowever, most of Cool Cat's cartoons dealt with his encounters with Colonel Rimfire (also voiced by Larry Storch), a fussy, British-accented big-game hunter armed with a shotgun. Rimfire essentially acted as the Elmer Fudd to Cool Cat's Bugs Bunny, but was used only by Lovy. Cool Cat bears the distinction of starring in the very last cartoon produced at the classic Warner Bros. Cartoons studio: Injun Trouble in 1969. Shortly after this cartoon was produced, the venerable animation studio shut down for good.\n\nHis cartoons can easily be distinguished from most of the other Looney Tunes cartoons, for they feature an updated Looney Tunes logo with stylized animation, a 1967 remix of \"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\" by William Lava, and featuring the then-current Warner Bros.-Seven Arts logo (a combination of a simple W and 7 inside a stylized shield outline).\n\nShorts (1967–1969):\n\nCool Cat\n\nBig Game Haunt\n\nHippydrome Tiger\n\n3-Ring Wing Ding\n\nBugged by a Bee\n\nInjun Trouble\n\nDespite their few cartoon appearances, Cool Cat and Colonel Rimfire have appeared in several other WB productions.\n\nThey both made appearances in the television series The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries.\n\nCool Cat appeared in the 2000 Direct-to-video movie Tweety's High-Flying Adventure voiced by Jim Cummings while Colonel Rimfire is voiced by Joe Alaskey.\n\nCool Cat and Colonel Rimfire are the only W-7 Arts characters to make any further appearances, beyond the classic era shorts, to date.\n\nCount Bloodcount[]\n\nCount Bloodcount (originally voiced by Ben Frommer) is a vampire from the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated shorts.\n\nThe Count's first appearance was in the 1963 short, Transylvania 6-5000.\n\nCount Bloodcount would reappear many years later in various Looney Tunes-related media. He was used as the final boss in the video game Bugs Bunny & Taz: Time Busters, and voiced by Joe Alaskey. He was also used as an enemy in Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle 4.\n\nHe appeared in the \"Fang You Very Much\" segment of the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"Stuff That Goes Bump in the Night\" voiced by Frank Welker. He is seen attempting (with hilariously painful results) to suck the blood of series regular Elmyra Duff only for any light to turn the Count into a bat.\n\nHe appeared in the The Oddball Couple episode \"Hotel Boo More,\" which was an almost exact copy of the Bugs Bunny's \"Transylvania 6-5000\" episode.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries called \"Fangs for the Memories.\"\n\nHe most recently appeared as Count Muerte in an episode of Duck Dodgers titled \"I'm Gonna Get You, Fat Sucka\" (voiced by Jeff Bennett) in which he aimed to suck the fat of the Eager Young Space Cadet. In the end Eager Young Space Cadet manages to defeat him by getting him to eat a pound of garlic shaped like himself causing him to disintegrate. In the episode, his appearance was based on that of Count Orlok, the vampire from the silent film Nosferatu. He also appeared in \"Till Doom Do Us Part\" as one of the members of The Legion of Duck Doom where he was somehow revived.\n\nThe Count's voice was sampled for the Gorillaz track \"Dracula,\" which features the lines \"Rest is good for the blood!\" and \"I am a Vampire!.\"\n\nThe Crusher[]\n\nThe Crusher is a brutish professional wrestler in 1951's Bunny Hugged (directed by Chuck Jones). He is voiced by John T. Smith. A similar character named The Champ appears in the 1948 cartoon Rabbit Punch. Crusher also appeared in a Tiny Toon Adventures episode featuring two songs by They Might Be Giants: \"Particle Man\" (as a wrestler) and \"Istanbul\" (as a henchman).\n\nCrusher also had a cameo role in Carrotblanca as a doorman, and appeared in an episode in The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries. He also appeared in two episodes of Duck Dodgers, voiced by John DiMaggio. Crusher appeared on the web show \"fast food\" on looneytunes.com.\n\nIn the 2003 film, Looney Tunes Back in Action, The Crusher makes a cameo as one of the judges on DJ's stunt performance.\n\nCrusher is a boss character in the Super NES video game Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage. Seen in the background are various Looney Tunes characters, and Pepe Le Pew is waving a pennant that reads \"Le Crusher.\"\n\nThe Crusher appeared in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"Jailbird and Jailbunny\" as an inmate at the prison where Bugs and Daffy are incarcerated. The Crusher next appeared in the episode \"Fish and Visitors,\" as a wrestler on television. He also appeared in two Merrie Melodies segments \"Blow My Stack\" (as one of the characters at Clarence Cat's anger management group) and \"Yellow Bird.\"\n\nD[]\n\nDoctor I.Q. Hi[]\n\nDoctor I.Q. Hi is a scientist who is the boss of Duck Dodgers and is mostly bald with some red hair on the sides. He appears in several classic shorts, also including the TV series Duck Dodgers. Doctor I.Q. Hi usually plays a supporting role, and was also featured in the Tiny Toons Adventures episode \"Duck Dodgers Jr.\" He first appeared in the 1953 cartoon Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century.\n\nDoctor I.Q. High is a supporting character in the Duck Dodgers TV series voiced by Richard McGonagle. In \"Of Course You Know, This Means War and Peace\" Pt. 1, it is revealed that he has a brother named Dr. Psy-Q. High (voiced by John Billingsley).\n\nDoctor Frankenbeans[]\n\nDoctor Frankenbeans is a mad scientist who only appears in Water as an enemy of Bugs. He went unnamed in classic cartoons, and was given his name in the video game Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal in which he was the main antagonist. He has a voice similar to that of Boris Karloff, and is the creator of Gossamer.[4]\n\nIn the Duck Dodgers episode \"Enemy Yours,\" Doctor Frankenbeans appears as Dr. Woe (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) who is one of the Martian Commander X-2's enemies.\n\nDodsworth[]\n\nDodsworth is a cat loosely based on W.C. Fields. He is depicted as a larger lethargic cat with marking almost identical to Sylvester. He was very lazy and was proud of that fact. His attempts to coerce a white kitten to do his work for him ultimately backfire. He was voiced by Sheldon Leonard.\n\nDaffy Duck[]\n\nMain article: Daffy Duck\n\nDrunken Stork[]\n\nThe Drunken stork is a supporting character in several cartoons in which, while drunk, he accidentally delivers babies to the wrong parents.\n\nBaby Bottleneck (1946)\n\nA Mouse Divided (1953)\n\nGoo Goo Goliath (1954)\n\nStork Naked (1955)\n\nPappy's Puppy (1955) - This was the only short in which the stork wasn't drunk.\n\nApes of Wrath (1959)\n\nThe stork also appeared in The Bugs Bunny Mother's Day Special (1979).\n\nE[]\n\nEgghead[]\n\nEgghead, who would evolve into Elmer Fudd, appeared in a number of shorts between 1937 and 1939, starting with Egghead Rides Again. Egghead did not have a speech problem, but had an egg-shaped head and a clown-like nose. The more recognizable Elmer Fudd did not appear until Elmer's Candid Camera.\n\nEgghead appears in the movie Daffy Duck's Quackbusters where he delivers a singing telegram to Daffy Duck about his \"Paranormalist at Large\" building getting repossessed due to unpaid rent.\n\nEgghead later made a cameo in Looney Tunes: Back in Action.\n\nEgghead, Jr.[]\n\nEgghead, Jr. debuted in 1954's Little Boy Boo, and made two subsequent Looney Tunes appearances in 1955's Feather Dusted and 1960's Crockett-Doodle-Doo.\n\nEgghead, Jr. is a large-headed and very intelligent baby chick and appeared in several shorts with bumptuous Foghorn Leghorn (also a character directed by McKimson and voiced by Blanc). The only child of Miss Prissy, a widow hen, Egghead, Jr. was bookish and never talked (though he mumbled when he counted playing hide-and-seek with Foghorn in Little Boy Boo). Foghorn would try to teach him to play games like baseball and cowboys and Indians, with the intent that he act more like a typical boy, but invariably resulting in bodily injury for Foghorn.\n\nIn 1991, Egghead Jr. appeared in the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"Hog-Wild Hamton\"; he's Hamton's neighbor and he doesn't like being disturbed, so when a wild party takes place at Hamton's house and the guests refuse to keep the noise down, Egghead takes matters into his own hands. Egghead Jr. also makes a cameo in Star Warners.\n\nElmer Fudd[]\n\nMain article: Elmer Fudd\n\nF[]\n\nFoghorn Leghorn[]\n\nMain article: Foghorn Leghorn\n\nFoxy[]\n\nMain article: Foxy (Merrie Melodies)\n\nFrisky Puppy[]\n\nFrisky Puppy is a young puppy who loves to play. He appeared in three cartoons, opposite Claude Cat, all directed by Chuck Jones. Frisky often sneaks up on Claude when Claude is trying to get rid of him, making the cat jump to the ceiling. With his loud barks and yelps, and obsessed with scratching himself because of fleas, Frisky seems to cause a lot of trouble for Claude. Since the puppy's first appearance, Two's a Crowd (1950), where Frisky was a present for the mistress of the house, Claude was always trying to get rid of Frisky, since the fact if Claude does not get along with the puppy then the cat can go. And it seems from the start that Claude hated Frisky, possibly due to Frisky's hyper active self. The Claude/Frisky storyline continued from Terrier Stricken (1952) to No Barking (1954). All the shorts portray Frisky winning over Claude, with the exception for Two's A Crowd, where the puppy loses to Claude in the end.\n\nG[]\n\nGabby Goat[]\n\nGabby Goat is a goat who was created by Bob Clampett to be a sidekick for Porky Pig in the 1937 short Porky and Gabby, directed by Ub Iwerks, who briefly subcontracted to Leon Schlesinger Productions, producers of the Looney Tunes shorts. The cartoon focuses on the title characters' camping trip, which is foiled by car trouble. Storyboard artist Cal Howard supplies Gabby's voice.\n\nGabby looks like Porky with a beard, horns, and scowl. The goat's chief characteristics are his irritability and short temper, traits that make him a natural foil for the shy, easy-going Porky. The concept didn't play out as well as the animators would have liked, however; audiences felt that the goat's behavior was too offensive to be funny. Gabby only appeared in two more cartoons. The first was Porky's Badtime Story (Clampett's first cartoon as director), where roommates Porky and Gabby are almost fired from their jobs for sleeping in and showing up late. They vow to get to sleep early that night, but various problems keep them awake all night. The cartoon was later remade in 1944 as Tick Tock Tuckered, featuring Daffy Duck in Gabby's role as Porky's co-star.\n\nThe third and final appearance of the character was in Get Rich Quick Porky, where Porky and Gabby dig for oil. Both Porky's Badtime Story and Get Rich Quick Porky were produced in 1937.\n\nRecently uncovered storyboards show that Gabby Goat was originally planned to appear in the 1938 short Porky's Party. However, that role was later filled by a penguin character with a similar personality.\n\nGiovanni Jones[]\n\nGiovanni Jones is an opera singer that debuted in Long-Haired Hare. He was singing \"Largo al Factotum\" from The Barber of Seville until Bugs playing his music at the same time disrupted Giovanni enough to confront Bugs and destroy his instruments. After the final attack, Bugs does various pranks upon Giovanni at his performance leading up to him disguising himself as Leopold Stokowski where he conducts Giovanni into holding a singular high G note until Giovanni can hardly endure the strain. His face turns different colors as he squirms and unravels his formal wear. Bugs leaves his glove hovering in the air and steps outside to order a pair of earmuffs which are delivered instantly after Bugs places the order in the mailbox. Bugs returns to the stage to find Giovanni has obeyed the glove and is still singing the high note but is now thrashing about on the floor banging his fists, his face still turning various colors. Finally, the top of the concert hall's shell shatters and tumbles down on top of Giovanni. For the encore, a roughed-up Giovanni appears out of the rubble to take a bow. Witnessing one last piece of the amphitheater balanced on a steel beam above Giovanni, Bugs again cues the singer to close out his performance with the high note so that the piece falls and crushes him off camera.\n\nIn The Looney Tunes Show episode \"Customer Service,\" Giovanni Jones' design is used to portray the unnamed manager of Copy Place. He first appears where he temporarily suspends Tina Russo after she snaps at a rude customer. However, he later reinstates her because he himself could not cope with the foolishness that came with working Tina's desk and admits that he had no idea what it's like dealing with those people. Especially since the customer he was having problems with at the time was Yosemite Sam who wanted Copy Place to print his money.\n\nGoopy Geer[]\n\nleft|thumb|200px|alt= Goopy Geer was the last attempt by Animator Rudolf Ising to feature a recurring character in the Merrie Melodies series of films. Goopy is a tall, lanky humanoid dog with scruffy whiskers and long, expressive ears. In all of his animated appearances, Goopy is depicted as light colored, but in an early promotional drawing for his first cartoon, he had black fur. A month after Goopy Geer's first cartoon had been released, Walt Disney released a cartoon with a character named Dippy Dawg—renamed \"Goofy\" in 1934, and notably referred to as \"G. G. Geef\" in 1950s shorts—whose overall appearance was very similar to that of Goopy Geer. Due to the proximity of the two cartoons' releases, there is little chance that either character was intended to be a copy of the other. Instead, both characters may have been inspired by earlier Ising drawings shown to Walt Disney, as with the Foxy - Mickey Mouse similarity.\n\nLike most other early sound-era cartoon characters, Ising's Goopy has little personality of his own. Instead, he sings and dances his way through a musical world in perfect syncopation. Ising only featured the character in three cartoons. In the first, Goopy Geer (April 16, 1932), he plays a popular pianist entertaining at a nightclub. In Ising's other two Goopy films, both in 1932, he cast the dog first as a Hillbilly in Moonlight for Two (June 11, 1932), then as a court jester in The Queen Was in the Parlor (July 9, 1932). All of these cartoons also feature Goopy's unnamed girlfriend who debuted without her gangly consort in the earlier Merrie Melodie Freddy the Freshman (February 20, 1932). Goopy would make a cameo in the Bosko cartoon Bosko in Dutch (January 14, 1933), but after Ising left Warner Bros. that same year, Goopy and other recurring Merrie Melodies characters were retired, to be later replaced by such recurring characters as Sniffles the Mouse, Inki and the Mynah Bird, the Curious Puppies, and, on two occasions, Porky Pig (a character who was certainly more prevalent in the black and white Looney Tunes) and Bugs Bunny. Many of the Merrie Melodies nonetheless remained high-quality one-shot cartoons, until 1943, when the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies merged and became generic.\n\nGoopy Geer had a small role in the 1990s animated series Tiny Toon Adventures. In the episode \"Two-Tone Town\" (September 28, 1992), Goopy (voiced by Robert Morse), reprising his role as the happy-go-lucky pianist from his first cartoon, meets the series' stars when they visit the \"black-and-white\" part of town. His appearance in this cartoon is updated somewhat, and seems to be based on early promotional drawings where his fur is black, rather than his actual cartoon appearances.\n\nGoofy Gophers[]\n\nMain article: Goofy Gophers\n\nGossamer[]\n\nMain article: Gossamer (Looney Tunes)\n\nGranny[]\n\nMain article: Granny (Looney Tunes)\n\nH[]\n\nHappy Rabbit[]\n\nHappy Rabbit was an early form of the character that eventually evolved into Bugs Bunny. In his first three appearances, the rabbit was all-white (the two later entries show a gray rabbit with a more recognizable resemblance to Bugs), and in all of his appearances, his voice was significantly different, not sporting the Brooklyn accent Bugs would develop later. Happy Rabbit was more of an aggressive character, choosing to fight instead of using his wits. Happy also seemed to be quite nutty, and his laugh was similar to that of Woody Woodpecker.\n\nHappy Rabbit cartoons:\n\nPorky's Building\n\nPorky's Hare Hunt\n\nPrest-O Change-O\n\nHare-um Scare-um\n\nElmer's Candid Camera\n\nHappy Rabbit appeared in deleted scenes of the 2003 film Looney Tunes: Back in Action.\n\nHam and Ex[]\n\nHam and Ex are happy-go-lucky St. Bernard twins as well as Beans' nephews. Their names are a pun of the phrase \"ham and eggs.\" The dogs made their debut in I Haven't Got a Hat. A year later, they reappeared in The Phantom Ship where they are fully clothed. The two would also have the lead role in The Fire Alarm. They had their final role in Westward Whoa. The two were part of experimental characters that Looney Tunes invented to try to create the next big stars in cartoons; however, they did not become a crowd favorite, and have not been seen since the very beginning of the Looney Tunes series.\n\nBoth are voiced by Bernice Hansen.\n\nHenery Hawk[]\n\nMain article: Henery Hawk\n\nHector the Bulldog[]\n\nHector the Bulldog is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of cartoons. Hector is a muscle-bound Bulldog with gray fur (except for A Street Cat Named Sylvester and Greedy For Tweety, where his fur is yellowish) and walks pigeon-toed. His face bears a perpetual scowl between two immense jowls. He wears a black collar with silver studs.\n\nThe concept started with an unnamed grey-furred bulldog portrayed as a background character to be a foil for various characters. This went from the cartoon Double Chaser (1942) up to the cartoon A Gruesome Twosome (1945)\n\nHector first appeared in 1945's Peck Up Your Troubles, where he foils Sylvester's attempts to get a woodpecker. He also appeared in A Hare Grows in Manhattan, leading a street gang composed of dogs in a Friz Freleng-directed short; this is also the first short where the dog speaks & the only cartoon where the dog also took the antagonist role. After those shorts, Hector is a minor player in several Tweety and Sylvester cartoons directed by Freleng in 1948 and throughout the 1950s. His usual role is to protect Tweety from Sylvester, usually at Granny’s request. He typically does this through brute strength alone, but some cartoons have him outsmart the cat, such as 1954's Satan's Waitin', wherein Hector convinces Sylvester to use up his nine lives by pursuing Tweety through a series of extremely dangerous situations. In most of his appearances, the bulldog is nameless, though he is sometimes referred to as Spike. Hector never got his name until Fowl Weather (which was also his first speaking role in a Tweety and Sylvester cartoon). Freleng probably did not intend the character to be the same bulldog as the Spike, he paired with Chester the Terrier in other cartoons.\n\nFans frequently confuse Hector for Spike or Marc Antony, but by right, the three bulldogs are actually not the same.\n\nHector mostly featured in cartoons directed by Friz Freleng. However, it made guest appearances in several cartoon shorts not directed by Friz Freleng (e.g. Mouse Wreckers; directed by Chuck Jones), usually as a background character. His colorization and character design varies in shorts not directed by Friz Freleng; e.g. in Cheese Chasers (Jones, 1951), Hector's character design and fur color looked prototypical to Marc Antony.\n\nHector’s most prominent role was as a regular cast member in the animated series The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries. In the cartoon, he plays Granny's loyal guardian. The show makes Hector's low intelligence his Achilles heel, as Sylvester is constantly outwitting him, and has him designed similar to Marc Antony. Originally played by Mel Blanc, Hector is currently voiced by Frank Welker. In most of his modern appearances Hector does not speak.\n\nHector made a cameo in Tweety's High-Flying Adventure as the Argentinean counsellor, dressed as a pirate. In the film, he was also voiced by Frank Welker.\n\nHector also appears in the video game Bugs Bunny & Taz: Time Busters where he guards one of the time gears in Granwich. He is a member of the studio audience in Sheep.\n\nHippety Hopper[]\n\nMain article: Hippety Hopper\n\nHoney[]\n\nHoney was the female counterpart to Bosko. Appearing in a white dress and polka-dotted bow in her hair, Honey first appeared in the first Looney Tunes short, Sinkin' in the Bathtub. She was originally voiced by an uncredited Rochelle Hudson, who was only 14 years old at the time the series began.\n\nHoney appears in the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"Fields of Honey\" voiced by B. J. Ward.\n\nHoney Bunny[]\n\nMain article: Honey Bunny\n\nThe Honey-Mousers[]\n\nRalph, Alice, and Ed are mice in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of animated shorts. They appear in the theatrical shorts The Honey-Mousers, Mouse Follies, and Cheese It.\n\nThey were meant as a parody of the television show The Honeymooners.\n\nHubie and Bertie[]\n\nMain article: Hubie and Bertie\n\nHugo the Abominable Snowman[]\n\nHugo is a large, rather naive, and easily fooled Abominable Snowman who really likes bunny rabbits. He likes to name his pets \"George\" and tried on two occasions to make Bugs Bunny his pet. He seems to be an actual snowman, as he melted when exposed to the sun too long. His character is a takeoff on Lennie Small in Of Mice and Men. \"George\" refers to Lennie's friend George Milton in the novel (and movie).\n\nHugo appears in the episode The Abominable Snow Rabbit when Bugs and Daffy Duck run into him after accidentally traveling to the Himalaya Mountains.\n\nIn Spaced Out Bunny, it was shown that he was captured by Marvin the Martian and brought to Mars, where Marvin attempted to give Bugs to him as a pet.\n\nIn both appearances, he was voiced by Mel Blanc.\n\nHe later made brief appearances in Tiny Toons Adventures and Tweety's High Flying Adventure, this time voiced by Frank Welker. In the latter, he had a different colour scheme here and was also shown to like cats as well as rabbits.\n\nHugo also appeared in Looney Tunes: Acme Arsenal.\n\nHugo was also a boss enemy in Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday at the end of The Alps where Porky Pig has to damage him by jumping on his head once he bends over to throw a snowball at Porky. Once he's defeated, he falls asleep. He is credited as Monster Max in the credits.\n\nHugo appears in The Looney Tunes Show voiced by John DiMaggio. In \"It's a Handbag,\" his picture is seen in the police notebook with the pictures of Baby-Faced Finster, Black Jacque Shellacque, Rocky and Mugsy, Yosemite Sam, two criminals that resemble Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street, and mugshot cameos by Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone. In \"Ridiculous Journey,\" Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz run into Hugo the Abominable Snowman who was running from Blacque Jacque Shellacque. Hugo tells the three of them to take the train tracks south while he heads north.\n\nI[]\n\nInki[]\n\nInki is a little African boy, who starred exclusively in the Merrie Melodies series of animated cartoons. Inki usually wears a simple loincloth, armband, legband, earrings, and a bone through his hair. He never speaks, is usually seen hunting jungle creatures, and is similar to the character \"Little Hiawatha,\" from the Silly Symphonies cartoons. He usually co-stars alongside the Minah Bird, a droopy, sad faced, silent black bird with an uncanny ability to overcome dangerous situations.\n\nInki filmography:\n\nThe Little Lion Hunter (1939)\n\nInki and the Lion (1941)\n\nInki and the Minah Bird (1943)\n\nInki at the Circus (1947)\n\nCaveman Inki (1950)\n\nInstant Martians[]\n\nThe Instant Martians are bird-like slaves of Marvin the Martian. They made their debut appearance in the animated short Hare-Way to the Stars, although a prototype appeared in Jumpin' Jupiter. They have made few appearances since then, including The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie.\n\nThey appear as enemies in the Area 52 stage of the Looney Tunes: Back in Action video game.\n\nJ[]\n\nJose and Manuel[]\n\nJose and Manuel are two slow-witted Mexican crows who starred in the Friz Freleng cartoons Two Crows From Tacos (1956) and Crows’ Feat (1962). Three years after their debut appearance, their personality would later be used for two cats, also named Jose and Manuel, in the 1959 Speedy Gonzales cartoon Mexicali Shmoes.\n\nK[]\n\nK-9[]\n\nK-9First appearance Haredevil Hare (1948)Created by Chuck JonesVoiced by Mel Blanc (Haredevil Hare) Frank Welker (Duck Dodgers)\n\nK-9 is a green cartoon Martian dog in the Warner Brother's Looney Tunes series of animated shorts. He is closely associated with Marvin the Martian as K-9 is Marvin's pet dog and sidekick in some Looney Tunes productions. He has a few resemblances to Disney's Pluto.\n\nK-9 premiered in the short Haredevil Hare, where he and his owner Marvin tried to thwart Bugs Bunny, who had stumbled on the pair's plans to destroy the Earth. He is given his first speaking role in this short, seeming quite unintelligent and gullible. That changes in later shorts where K-9 carries an air of superiority over his owner.\n\nIn recent Warner Bros. productions, K-9 only plays small cameo roles in video games and films, such as Sheep, Space Jam, and the 2003 film Looney Tunes: Back in Action.\n\nHe has a starring role in two episodes of Duck Dodgers: \"K-9 Quarry\" and \"K-9 Kaddy,\" in which he saves his master from dangers, and is berated by an oblivious Marvin, in a similar manner to the Porky and Sylvester shorts. The second of these episodes set him against Martian versions of the Goofy Gophers, in an obvious reference to Pluto's adversarial relationship with Chip N Dale.\n\nL[]\n\nLeo Lion[]\n\nLeo Lion made his debut in the Merrie Melodies short The Lyin' Mouse although unnamed.\n\nLeo's other two cartoons dealt with Bugs Bunny. In Hold the Lion, Leo Lion (voiced by Ted Pierce) tries to prove to a heckling giraffe, Hippopotamus, and monkey that he's still \"King of the Jungle\" by targeting a smaller animal. He chooses Bugs Bunny as his intended victim, but Leo soon finds out that, in a battle of wits, he's the defenseless one. However, Leo eventually gets Bugs under one paw while raising the other one, claws extended, and looking extremely angry where a truly frightened-looking Bugs could be facing his end. Just then, Leo gets a phone call on Bugs' phone from his wife Hortense and Leo immediately goes from ferocious to meek. After a brief conversation, Leo tells her he's on his way home. He apologizes to Bugs that he can't \"stay and kill him\" and dashes home to Hortense.\n\nIn Acrobatty Bunny, Leo Lion was renamed Nero at the time when the circus he was associated with has placed his cage over Bugs Bunny's hole..\n\nLeo's his forth & final short The Lion's Busy which proved that Leo is even dumber than Beaky Buzzard as he tries to avoid being eaten by Beaky which leads to him hiding in a cave within the moon while waiting for Beaky to leave. At the end of the short, Leo and Beaky are at an old age where Beaky can only eat marshmellows.\n\nLittle Blabbermouse[]\n\nLittle Blabbermouse first appeared in the 1940 Merrie Melodies short Little Blabbermouse. In this short Little Blabbermouse goes on a tour with other mice around a Drug Store where the products live up to their names. The annoying non-stop talking mouse after much pestering the tour guide mouse and a close encounter with a cat gets a mouthful of Alum making him speak gibberish.\n\nHis second was the 1940 short Shop, which has basically a similar plot except the scene is a grocery shop, they do not encounter a cat and Little Blabbermouse ends up gift wrapped. Little Blabbermouse has never been featured in any future short but Lil' Sneezer of Tiny Toons Adventures is somewhat based on him. experiment experiments 1 1 0 for the Lilo & Stitch franchise resembling Little Blabbermouse\n\nLittle Kitty[]\n\nthumb|180px|right|Little Kitty as seen in Hollywood Capers A nervous cat who serves as a love interest for Beans. Voiced by Bernice Hansen.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood[]\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood has appeared such shorts as The Bear's Tale, Red Riding Hoodwinked, Little Red Walking Hood, Little Red Riding Rabbit and Book Revue. Her appearance is slightly different in all of her Cartoons.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood appeared in The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries voiced by Tress MacNeille.\n\nLola Bunny[]\n\nMain article: Lola Bunny\n\nM[]\n\nMad scientist[]\n\nThe mad scientist was featured in different cartoons and is a caricature of Peter Lorre.\n\nHe first appeared in Hair-Raising Hare where he uses a wind-up rabbit to lure Bugs Bunny to his castle so that he can feed it to Gossamer. When Bugs ends up on the run in the scientist's castle, Gossamer is unleashed upon Bugs. In this appearance, the scientist is voiced by Mel Blanc.\n\nIn Birth of a Notion, Daffy Duck comes across the home of the mad scientist and his dog Leopold to evade flying south for the winter. The mad scientist wanted to harvest Daffy Duck's wishbone. When Daffy escapes from the Peter Lorre Scientist's house, Leopold is then targeted by his master who plans to use a dog's wishbone instead (though Leopold managed to escape as seen at the end of the episode). In this appearance, the mad scientist is voiced by Stan Freberg.\n\nIn the Tiny Toon Adventures episode \"New Character Day,\" a cartoon called \"The Return of Pluck Twacy\" has the mad scientist parodied as a criminal named \"Boxcars\" (voiced by Frank Welker).\n\nThe mad scientist appears in Looney Tunes: Back in Action voiced by Billy West. He appears as a minion of Mr. Chairman.\n\n[]\n\nMain article: Marc Antony and Pussyfoot\n\nMarvin the Martian[]\n\nMain article: Marvin the Martian\n\nMcKimson Cat[]\n\nA male black and white cat who appears in the shorts Paying the Piper (1949), Swallow the Leader (1949), It's Hummer Time (1950), A Fractured Leghorn (1950), Early to Bet (1951) and Leghorn Swoggled (1951). He is voiced by Mel Blanc. In the third and fifth, the cat is antagonized by a bulldog who gives him either humiliating or also painful sentences for bugging him in the second cartoon and for losing bets.\n\nMelissa Duck[]\n\nMain article: Melissa Duck\n\nMerlin the Magic Mouse[]\n\nMerlin the Magic Mouse is a nightclub magician (he usually preferred to be called a prestidigator, though he could never pronounce this correctly) who traveled around for work. Much of the humour of the character derived from the fact that, while he was often regarded as a cheap stage magician, he knew some very real and powerful magic tricks. His magic words were typically \"Atascadero Escondido!\" Merlin also has a sidekick, appropriately named Second Banana, which is a slang term for a magician's assistant.\n\nDaws Butler provided the voice of Merlin and Second Banana in the first short, Merlin the Magic Mouse; Larry Storch performed the voices for the other four films.\n\nMichigan J. Frog[]\n\nMain article: Michigan J. Frog\n\nMr. Hook[]\n\nMr. Hook is a character created by Warner Bros. studios, during the World War II era, along with Private Snafu, who became much more popular. Mr. Hook is a sailor in the army. He has appeared in The Return Of Mr. Hook, The Good Egg, and Tokyo Woes.\n\nN[]\n\nNasty Canasta[]\n\nMain article: Nasty Canasta\n\nO[]\n\nOliver Owl[]\n\nOliver Owl is a snooty owl who was first seen in I Haven't Got a Hat, as well as being a movie director in Hollywood Capers. His appearance is similar to \"Owl Jolson\" in I Love to Singa (1936). He finally appeared in re-designed version in Plane Dippy, where he and Little Kitty find a puppy, and they both teach the puppy to do tricks.\n\nHe was another one of Warner Brothers attempts to discover a new star in early Looney Tunes history.\n\nOwl Jolson[]\n\nOwl Jolson is an young owl that want to sing popular song against the wishes of his music professor father. After noticing Owl was a smash success in a music contest while performing his own brand of style, the elder owl relented. The character was based on Al Jolson in \"The Jazz Singer\". He made only 1 Cartoon in I Love to Singa.\n\nHe make cameos in Looney Tunes: Back in Action & the video game adaption.\n\nP[]\n\nPenelope Pussycat[]\n\nMain article: Penelope Pussycat\n\nPepe Le Pew[]\n\nMain article: Pepé Le Pew\n\nPete Puma[]\n\nPete Puma (Originally voiced by Stan Freberg) marked his first and only appearance in Rabbit's Kin (1952). Though Pete Puma made only two appearances, in Rabbit's Kin and in Pullet Surprise, he is often vividly remembered by cartoon fans, especially for his bizarre, inhaled, almost choking laugh, called \"ihhhhh\" (based on comedian Frank Fontaine's \"Crazy Guggenheim\" character). In Rabbit's Kin, Pete is chasing a young rabbit (named Buster Rabbit by some fans; and though he is called Buster at least once, in the cartoon Bugs repeatedly calls him \"Shorty\"), who asks Bugs Bunny for help. Bugs is eager to oblige, and subjects Pete to some of his trademark pranks.\n\nMore recently, he has made occasional appearances on Tiny Toon Adventures (as the Acme Looniversity janitor), episodes of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, co-starred with Foghorn Leghorn in Pullet Surprise (voiced again by Freberg in all of these appearances), made a cameo appearance in the crowd scenes of Space Jam, Carrotblanca (as a waiter), Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, Bah (in which he is once again a janitor), and is a supporting character in the Looney Tunes comic books.\n\nPete appears in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"Reunion\" voiced by John Kassir. He is shown to be a friend of Daffy Duck and Marvin the Martian. He also appears in \"Devil Dog,\" as a zookeeper. Then in \"To Bowl or Not to Bowl\" as Daffy's teammates. Also in \"Sunday Night Slice\" where he works at Speedy's pizza restaurant, which was called Giradi's, and once again in \"Working Duck\" where he was watching the cart of EnormoCorp's muffin man.\n\nPetunia Pig[]\n\nMain article: Petunia Pig\n\nPorky Pig[]\n\nMain article: Porky Pig\n\nPiggy[]\n\nPiggy first appeared as a fat, black pig who wears a pair of shorts with buttons on the front. His coloration and dress are identical to those of the Walt Disney character Mickey Mouse before the advent of color film. John Kenworthy argues that, considering the fact that some sketches of mice which Hugh Harman had drawn in 1925 were the inspiration for the creation of Mickey Mouse, Harman and Ising never intended to copy Disney.[5]\n\nPiggy's name came from one of two brothers who were childhood classmates of Freleng's, nicknamed \"Porky\" and \"Piggy.\"[6]\n\nAnimator Rudolf Ising introduced Piggy as a second character after Foxy to star in the Merrie Melodies series Ising was directing for producer Leon Schlesinger. Nonetheless, Ising had only made two Piggy shorts in 1931 before he went on to create Goopy Geer. The animators who took over the Merrie Melodies cartoons dropped the Piggy character (as well as his girlfriend Fluffy) and turned the series into a string of one-shots.\n\nDespite their clichéd lead character, Ising's two Piggy shorts are well received by some critics. The first is the 1931 short You Don't Know What You're Doin'!. Here, Piggy visits a surreal night club where he heckles and plays with the club's jazz band. This was followed by Hittin' the Trail for Hallelujah Land, also in 1931. Here, Piggy plays a steamboat captain who must rescue a drowning Uncle Tom. Due to its stereotypical portrayal of the Uncle Tom character, the cartoon is included among the so-called \"Censored 11,\" shorts that are withheld from circulation due to their heavy use of ethnic Stereotypes.\n\nIn 1936, animator Friz Freleng redesigned Piggy for colour film. Piggy was given lighter, more Caucasian-like colour with distinguishing birthmarks. The redesigned character appeared as a gluttonous child in a large family of pigs in At Your Service Madame (which gives his full name as Piggy Hamhock),[7] where he leads his fellow siblings in foiling a bum's attempt to rob their mother. A year later he starred in Pigs Is Pigs in which his gluttony takes center stage.[7] This would be his final appearance. After that he was discarded with his character traits transferred for a time to Porky Pig.\n\nPlayboy Penguin[]\n\nPlayboy Penguin is a character in the animated cartoon Looney Tunes, created by Chuck Jones in the late 1940s and early 1950s. He debuted in 1949's Frigid Hare and he re-appeared in 8 Ball Bunny. His feathers are dark blue and white, he wears a top hat and a black bow tie Bugs Bunny gave him (because it looked like he was in a tuxedo) and has big wide eyes. A running gag is that when he cries when he's sad and a running gag is that when he cries in cold weather his tears turn to ice cubes\n\nPlayboy Penguin is a mute skating baby penguin that seeks Bugs Bunny for help. From his debut episode, an Eskimo tries to catch him until the little penguin found Bugs Bunny and wants him to help avoid the Eskimo hunter. Then, in his second episode with Bugs, Bugs takes the penguin to Antarctica, but it turn out he wanted to go to Hoboken to perform in the show.\n\nPlayboy Penguin also appears on The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries and Space Jam. He also makes a cameo in the DS game Duck Amuck.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFrigid Hare (1949)\n\n8-Ball Bunny (1950)\n\nSpace Jam (1996)-appears as auditor\n\nBah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas (2006)-appears as customer\n\nMiss Prissy[]\n\nMiss Prissy or Prissy is typically described as an old spinster hen, thinner than the other hens in the chicken coop, wearing a blue bonnet and wire-rimmed glasses. The other hens describe her as \"old square britches.\"\n\nThe premise of her cartoons are centered around the fact that the other hens are ridiculing Prissy. Her first appearance was in the 1950 short An Egg Scramble, the only cartoon featuring her and Porky Pig together, in which the other hens are making fun of the fact that she cannot lay an egg (because she thinks it's embarrassing). Her next appearances are centered around Foghorn Leghorn. In Lovelorn Leghorn (1951), she is set on finding a husband and in Of Rice and Hen (1953) she is looking to have children. However, in Little Boy Boo (1954) she is depicted as a widow with a child Egghead Jr. and with a much more extensive vocabulary in long sounding words than her trademark \"yeeesss.\" A Broken Leghorn (1959) and Strangled Eggs (1961), featuring Henery Hawk. In these shorts, it is usually Foghorn who is pursuing Prissy for his own selfish needs.[8]\n\nMiss Prissy also appeared in the 1980 cartoon The Yolk's On You.\n\nMiss Prissy appears in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"The Foghorn Leghorn Story\" voiced by Grey DeLisle. She played Mama Leghorn in Foghorn Leghorn's movie called \"The Foghorn Leghorn Story.\"\n\nA prototype Miss Prissy named Emily appeared in Let It Be Me (1936) and A Star is Hatched (1938).\n\nPrivate Snafu[]\n\nMain article: Private Snafu\n\nR[]\n\nRalph Phillips[]\n\nRalph Phillips is an imaginative boy who likes to daydream about all kinds of things he sees around him. For example in From A to Z-Z-Z-Z, Ralph (while attending school) daydreams about flying in the air like a bird, fighting off mocking numbers on a blackboard and Indians (this scene was later edited because of some Native American stereotypes and some violence), dispatching a dangerous saber-tooth tiger shark, and finally punching out a huge opponent in the boxing ring and leaving the school for the day as Douglas MacArthur. From A to Z-Z-Z-Z was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nRalph appeared in a further Looney Tunes short, Boyhood Daze, where he was sent up to his room for breaking a window with a baseball, wherein he indulged in similar daydreaming, and in the theatrically diverted TV pilot Adventures of the Road-Runner. In more recent years he has figured in issues of the DC Comics Looney Tunes comic book as well.\n\nA more mature Ralph Phillips was also featured as an Army recruit in two cartoons produced specifically as military recruitment promotions, 90 Day Wondering and Drafty, both directed by Jones.\n\nRalph Phillips was voiced by child actor Dick Beals (who would later be known for playing young boys in future projects due to a glandular problem). The older version was voiced by Warner Bros.' regular voice actor Mel Blanc, in 90 Day Wondering, and by Daws Butler, in Drafty, Isn't It?.\n\nRalph Wolf[]\n\nMain article: Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog\n\nRoad Runner[]\n\nMain article: Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner\n\nRocky and Mugsy[]\n\nMain article: Rocky and Mugsy\n\nS[]\n\nSam[]\n\nSam is an orange cat that claims to be friends with Sylvester. But when it comes to food, they are deadly rivals. They fight over a mouse in Mouse and Garden and fight over Tweety in Trick or Tweet. His other appearances are The Spy Swatter & Merlin the Magic Mouse.\n\nSam Sheepdog[]\n\nMain article: Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog\n\nSlowpoke Rodriguez[]\n\nSlowpoke Rodríguez (\"Lento Rodríguez\" in Spanish, though some more recent translations call him \"Tranquilino\") is described as \"the slowest mouse in all Mexico\" from the country side of Mexico, and is a cousin to Speedy Gonzales, who is known as the fastest. However, he mentions to his cousin that while he may be slow in the feet, which he is best known for, he's not slow in \"la cabeza\" (the head). He speaks in a monotone voice and seems to never be surprised by anything. While he is the slowest mouse in all of Mexico, he has been shown to have certain other (more extreme) methods of protecting himself, such as being armed with a gun.\n\nSlowpoke only appeared in two cartoons alongside his cousin. The first, Mexicali Shmoes (1959), ends with two lazy cats, Jose and Manuel, failing to catch Speedy and suggested they try their luck on his cousin. Jose is convinced and Manuel tries to catch up to warn him about Slowpoke. Even though he was able to catch him, Jose learns the truth about Slowpoke the hard way: he carries a gun (though the gun bit has been edited out of this cartoon in recent years). The second, Mexican Boarders (1962), revolves around Speedy trying to protect Slowpoke from Sylvester the Cat, but in the end, Slowpoke demonstrates his ability to hypnotize Sylvester into becoming his slave. Despite his few appearances, \"Lento Rodríguez\" is an immensely popular character in Latin America.\n\nSlowpoke Rodriguez appears in The Looney Tunes Show episode \"The Black Widow\" voiced by Hugh Davidson. Besides being the cousin of Speedy Gonzales, he is depicted as the Sheriff of Tacapulco. After Daffy Duck and Porky Pig are arrested for streaking (which they had to describe the meaning of the word to the Tacapulco citizens), Slowpoke allows Daffy Duck to make one call. When Daffy Duck is unable to reach Bugs Bunny, he calls up Speedy Gonzales who races to Tacapulco and convinces his cousin to let them out. Slowpoke Rodriguez does let Daffy Duck and Porky Pig out of jail and allows them to take part in Tacapulco's festivities.\n\nSniffles[]\n\nMain article: Sniffles\n\nSpeedy Gonzales[]\n\nMain article: Speedy Gonzales\n\nSpike and Chester[]\n\nSpike is a burly, gray Bulldog who wears a red sweater, a brown bowler hat, and a perpetual scowl. Chester is just the opposite, a small and jumpy terrier with yellow fur and brown, perky ears.\n\nThe characters starred in only two shorts, both directed by Animator Friz Freleng. The first of these films was 1952's Tree for Two. In it, Chester tells his idol Spike that he knows of a cat that they can beat up. The cat is Freleng's own Sylvester, but every time Spike thinks he has the cat cornered, a runaway zoo black panther appears in Sylvester's place, thrashing the dog instead. Spike gets easily sent into a panic when he thinks Sylvester is going to kill him and runs away to hide, giving Sylvester the chance to get revenge. When Chester decides to have a go of it, however, Sylvester finds himself at the little dog's mercy. By the cartoon's end, Spike and Chester have switched roles; Spike is the fawning sycophant, and Chester the smug prizefighter.\n\nThe characters' second outing came in the 1954 film Dr. Jerkyl's Hide. Spike (here called \"Alfie\" and with an English accent) is once again after Sylvester, only this time it is Sylvester himself who pummels the poor pooch, thanks to a potion that transforms him into a feline monster. Chester, of course, never sees this transformed Sylvester, thinking his buddy is being beaten by the tiny tomcat. The final loss of face for Alfie is his being thrashed by a fly that has also been affected by the potion, as it occurs in front of Chester's eyes.\n\nIn both of these cartoons, Spike is performed by voice actor Mel Blanc, and Chester is performed by Stan Freberg. In modern Warner Bros. media, Spike's voice is provided by Joe Alaskey.\n\nFans frequently confuse Spike for Hector in a red sweater but by right they are actually not the same.\n\nThe pair also appear in the 1996 film Space Jam as a pair of paramedics during the basketball game.\n\nAnother bulldog character appeared in other cartoons with Sylvester and Tweety, but this character is not Spike; he is officially known as Hector the Bulldog. Several Tom and Jerry cartoons produced by MGM also featured a character named Spike the Bulldog (and his son, Tyke), Coincidentally, WB now owns the Tom & Jerry cartoons as well (through Turner Entertainment). This is another character, unrelated to the Spike used by Freleng. Also, several Tex Avery-directed cartoons produced by MGM also featured a different character named Spike the Bulldog, which also appeared in the Droopy series of cartoons. Again it is also unrelated to the Spike used by Freleng, too.\n\nSylvester[]\n\nMain article: Sylvester (Looney Tunes)\n\nSylvester Junior[]\n\nMain article: Sylvester Junior\n\nT[]\n\nTasmanian Devil[]\n\nMain article: Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)\n\nTasmanian She-Devil[]\n\nThe Tasmanian She-Devil first appeared Devil May Hare. Taz married a female Tasmanian Devil that he fell in love with. She appeared once again in Bedeviled Rabbit. She appeared in much Looney Tunes merchandise and coloring books.\n\nShe also appeared in the 2003 film Looney Tunes: Back in Action with her vocal effects provided by Brendan Fraser.\n\nThe Three Bears[]\n\nThe Three Bears are a family that consists of Papa Bear (sometimes called Henry), Mama Bear, and Junior Bear (sometimes spelled Junyer or Joonyer).\n\nAnimator Chuck Jones introduced the trio in the 1944 cartoon Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears. In the short, Papa Bear tries to feed his starving family by having them act out their roles in the traditional Fairy tale from which they derive their name. Unfortunately for them, when they were out of porridge, Mama substitutes carrot soup for it, and the \"Goldilocks\" they lure turns out to be none other than Bugs Bunny. For the bulk of the series, Voice actors Billy Bletcher, Bea Benaderet, and Stan Freberg played Papa, Mama, and Junior, respectively. However, in the initial entry Mel Blanc played Papa, and Kent Rogers played Junior (Freberg assuming the role after Rogers's death in World War II). After the classic shorts, Will Ryan and Joe Alaskey play Henry and Mama while Junior is still voiced by Stan Freberg.\n\nJones' bears as introduced in the short are perhaps the first film Satire of the American nuclear family and how its traditional roles were coming under increasing scrutiny in the 1940s. Papa is a loud-mouthed, short tempered and often abusive shrimp, while Junior is an oversized, muscular, buffoon. The two are constantly at each other (usually Junior at Papa's wrath), leaving Mama Bear as the innocent (and deadpan) middle-bear, although she often resorts to thwacking one of them with a rolled-up newspaper to keep the peace. As Jones himself was never shy to point out, this cartoon and others in the series anticipate the failings and foibles that would later make the Sitcom All in the Family such a success.\n\nJones brought back the Bears for his 1948 cartoon What's Brewin', this time sans Bugs. Here, alpha-male Papa Bear decides, after losing a card game, that it's time for the Bears to hibernate. Like any good family should, Mama Bear and Junior Bear obey, but Mama's snoring and Junior's creaky cradle keep Papa from getting the sleep he himself advocated. Junior's voice is here supplied by Stan Freberg, who would retain the role for all future Three Bears cartoons, including The Bee-Deviled Bruin and Bear Feat, released on Looney Tunes Assorted Nuts, both in 1949. Mama Bear made a cameo appearance in the 1950 Daffy Duck short The Scarlet Pumpernickel.\n\nThe 1951 cartoon A Bear for Punishment, the last film in the series, is often considered the funniest, and it is perhaps the most satirical. This time, it's Father's Day, and Mama and Junior's well-intended gifts do nothing but dishonor the perturbed Papa. Jones later stated that many of the scenarios in the short were derived from his own experiences.\n\nThe Bears' cartoons most significant impact was perhaps on Jones himself, as these films (along with the Hubie and Bertie and Charlie Dog shorts) represent some of Jones's earliest work.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Three Bears were brought back and featured several times in the TV series Tiny Toon Adventures with Papa Bear voiced by Frank Welker, Mama Bear voiced by Tress MacNeille, and Junior Bear voiced by Stan Freberg. Most famously, they appeared in an updated \"90's version\" of the classic Three Bears fairy tale (with Elmyra playing the part of Goldilocks), which parodied suburbia and the mass commercialism prevalent in American society. In the episode \"Prom-ise Her Anything,\" Mama Bear is seen as a lunch lady.\n\nThe design for Papa Bear was used in the Animaniacs episode \"Garage Sale of the Century\" as Vern Bear (voiced by Edward Asner).\n\nIn Looney Tunes: Back In Action, the Bears are tourists in Paris. They run into DJ Drake (Brendan Fraser), whose trousers have rocketed off into the air leaving him in his underwear. DJ steals Papa Bear's trousers so he can save Jenna Elfman's character from a villain.\n\nThe Three Bears appear in The Looney Tunes Show with Papa Bear voiced by Maurice LaMarche, Mama Bear voiced by Grey DeLisle, and Junior Bear voiced by John DiMaggio. They were seen on a road trip heading to the Grand Canyon when Baby Bear finds Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz. When Papa Bear finds them, Mama Bear convinces them to keep the three animals. Sylvester, Tweety, and Taz get out by pouring milk down Baby Bear's daiper causing the Three Bears to make a pit stop.\n\nTina Russo[]\n\nTina Russo is a female duck who is Daffy's girlfriend. She appeared on The Looney Tunes Show; Tina works at a copy store called \"Copy Place\".\n\nTweety[]\n\nMain article: Tweety\n\nTwo Curious Puppies[]\n\nMain article: Two Curious Puppies\n\nTyr'ahnee[]\n\nThe Martian Queen (AKA Queen Tyr'ahnee). The beautiful ruler of Mars from the Duck Dodgers tv series.\n\nW[]\n\nWeasel[]\n\nThe Weasel is a small, gnash-happy weasel, with the hyperness of the Tasmanian Devil. He craved chicken and was always after Foghorn Leghorn. He appeared in Weasel Stop, Plop Goes the Weasel, and Weasel While You Work.\n\nWile E. Coyote[]\n\nMain article: Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner\n\nWilloughby[]\n\nWilloughby is a hound dog created and voiced by Tex Avery for the 1940 cartoon, Of Fox and Hounds.[9] Willoughby is characterized by his below-average intelligence and overall gullibility. Willoughby later appears in other Warner Bros. animated shorts, including The Heckling Hare (1941), The Crackpot Quail, Nutty News (as the lead dog of a fox hunting party), The Hep Cat — as Rosebud (1942), An Itch in Time - as Elmer Fudd's dog Rover(1943) and Hare Force — as Sylvester the Dog (1944). Willoughby first appeared with brown-and-white fur in 1940, then redesigned with brown fur only in 1941. By 1943 the character was redesigned slightly. Marvin the Martian's dog, K-9, has many physical resemblances to Willoughby. According to Chuck Jones, the character was based on Lennie, from Of Mice and Men (1937).\n\nWitch Hazel[]\n\nMain article: Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)\n\nY[]\n\nYosemite Sam[]\n\nMain article: Yosemite Sam\n\nSee also[]\n\nMerrie Melodies\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography\n\nLooney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
