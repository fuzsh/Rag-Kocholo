        "text": "Friday, October 21, 2022.\n\nOnward I go to another incarnation of my Weblog. Previous incarnations of Kevin McCorry's Weblog are April 16, 2007-to-September 19, 2015, October 4, 2015-to-May 4, 2018, May 5, 2018-to-June 19, 2020, and June 20, 2020-to-October 19, 2022.\n\nThe Blu-Ray release of the 1932 Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde is now days away. No new reviews anywhere, though The Bugs Bunny Video Guide is now acknowledging \"Hyde and Hare\"'s release to Blu-Ray, repeating the caveats already noted elsewhere as regards the cartoon's picture quality. I do not imagine that I will have the Blu-Ray in my possession until several days after Halloween. If I could order it from Amazon.ca, I would have it within a week, but like all other Warner Archive Blu-Ray releases, it is not available at the Canadian branch of Amazon.com. And thus have I had to order it from Amazon.com in the U.S.. With luck, I may have it before the long Remembrance Day weekend. With luck.\n\nFront cover to MPI Home Video's release of THE LOST WORLDS OF GERRY ANDERSON, which includes The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\", that is, I can safely say, my second favourite Gerry Anderson production, Space: 1999 being my first favourite.\n\nI decided to buy The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" in its North American NTSC release from MPI Home Video. I wanted to see if the picture quality is better than that on the Network release. It is. Less digital \"noise\", less aliasing. I remember reading somewhere that this production is only archivally retained now on videotape, though I cannot recall if the videotape is PAL or NTSC. If NTSC, that would expain why it looks better on the MPI DVD, not having undergone a NTSC-to-PAL conversion and not needing to be subsequently converted back to NTSC by my player. The MPI DVD may also use less digital video compression, being as it is missing some content (disposable content, in my estimation) that is on the Network DVD.\n\nIt is such a pity that the original film elements to The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" are lost, as I am sure that it would be eye-poppingly gorgeous in High Definition. I think that I can safely say that it is second to Space: 1999 on my list of favourite Gerry Anderson works. Journey to the Far Side of the Sun would come in third place. And then, quite a ways below it, UFO.\n\nAll for today.\n\nFriday, October 28, 2022.\n\nMy Blu-Ray of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) is en route to me. The package cleared Canada Customs yesterday. My hope is that it will be delivered early next week. Maybe as early as Monday. Halloween. A perfect day to watch Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932), and the deficient rendition of \"Hyde and Hare\" on the Blu-Ray disc.\n\nWebsite updates. All of them to my Era 4 memoirs. Two additional images of the New Avengers episode, \"Hostage\", a new image quintet with images of Fahrenheit 451, Spiderman- \"The Evil Sorcerer\", \"Canned Feud\", \"Hyde and Go Tweet\", and A View to a Kill, and some new paragraphs remembering December, 1985, including a videotape that I received by mail with the \"Collision Course\" episode of Space: 1999 thereon, and two episodes of the U.K.'s Clapperboard One interviewing Space: 1999 producer Gerry Anderson, special effects master Brian Johnson, and model-maker Martin Bower. Era 4 has now pulled ahead of Era 2 by some margin with regard to length.\n\nI remember how happy I was to have \"Collision Course\" in its original episode form, not as part of the \"movie\", Journey Through the Black Sun, my having \"made do\" with \"Collision Course\" as it had been adjusted for that movie, for more than two years. I promptly rented a videocassette machine from Log Home Video in Devon, Fredericton North, combined it with mine, and made a burnished copy of the episode. And this was how \"Collision Course\" was best represented in my collection of videotape until YTV aired it in spring of 1991. Oh, I also had the SYBIL DANNING ADVENTURE VIDEO of Journey Through the Black Sun. But it was ancillary to the episode versions of \"Collision Course\" and \"Black Sun\".\n\nI treasured my videotapes of Space: 1999. Season 1. Season 2. All episodes. I loved both seasons, contrary to the popular opinion of me as a \"Year 1\"-hater, in Space: 1999 fandom. I am not anti-Season 1. I am against the weaponising of Season 1 against Season 2 and the wielding of Season 1 against ardent appreciators of Season 2 such as myself. I am against the wrongs perpetrated against me by the closed-minded pundits of Season 1, and the Calgary-based imperious leader of the Alpha League fan club, most especially. Him together with his compatriot in my \"cancellation\", the Reginan, and the louts at the Space: 1999 Mailing List who flung that \"cancellation\" at me and my indignation with it, as some sort of indictment against my mental fitness. There are some horrible people in the Season 1 \"camp\". Quite a plurality of them, actually. I cannot overlook that. But if I can divorce it from my history of appreciation and valuing of both seasons, I can sit and watch episodes of Season 1 without resentment hampering my viewing pleasure. It is easier to do this now, with just about every Facebook Space: 1999 group no longer accessible to me (I refuse to join them and can no longer see them, as their discussions are now private).\n\nCartoon fans who were, in the 2000s, dismissive of \"Hyde and Hare\" and of my article about it, lambasting it, and all other Friz Freleng works of the mid-1950s, as being scarcely any better than cartoons of the 1960s, and were participants in my \"cancellation\" in the Internet-based fandom for vintage cartoons, are now complaining about the ancient film-to-video transfer of \"Hyde and Hare\" used for the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) Blu-Ray. This raises an eyebrow on my part. Oh, I doubt most emphatically that those people gained any appreciation for \"Hyde and Hare\" in the years since I left the Golden Age Cartoons community, but it does stir my irony-noting tendency, and also invokes my capacity for sardonic perspective, to see them complaining that the cartoon they famously denigrated is not looking as sharp as possible. Maybe if those cartoon fans had treated the cartoon better, Warner Archive might have been more motivated to procure the restored, High Definition film-to-video transfer of \"Hyde and Hare\" from Warner Home Video, which might have also been more willing to be obliging of the request.\n\nI should know early next week exactly how awful \"Hyde and Hare\" is on the Blu-Ray of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932). I will, of course, provide a thorough review, of both the cartoon and the movie.\n\nMy Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) Blu-Ray was delivered at my door on the morning of Tuesday, November 1. A day too late for watching the Blu-Ray in celebration of Halloween. But I am exceedingly happy to have the Blu-Ray disc in my hands several days before the projected delivery date of November 7 provided by Amazon.com.\n\nThe package arrived when I had less than an hour before having to go to work, and I made the most of the time allowed to me to enjoy my latest acquisition before my earning of a living required me to depart my house. I popped the Blu-Ray disc into one of my machines and went first for \"Hyde and Hare\". Everything said in the review that I read weeks ago, is accurate. The cartoon is blurry. There is aliasing, especially on the names in the credits. The colours are inferior to those on same cartoon in LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION 2. But they were not quite as poor as I was expecting. And the Blu-Ray encode means that the cartoon is not marred with the conspicuous digital video compression artifacts that are very evident on the LOONEY TUNES GOLDEN COLLECTION DVD. Audio also is better than on the DVD, it not being quite so compressed here.\n\nFive images of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie of 1932, of which a Blu-Ray was released in October, 2022.\n\nAfter the cartoon, I proceeded to the movie, watching it with the new audio commentary activated. I watched it as far as Hyde arriving at Variety Music Hall. And then after work, I watched the balance of the movie with the same audio commentary selected, then listened to the Fredric March radio play, and then watched the whole movie with movie audio. All reviews of the movie in its Blu-Ray rendering are also accurate. It looks magnificent. A triumph in film restoration in the digital age. I have had Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) on VHS videocassette, laser videodisc, and DVD in the past thirty-one years since that visit to Suncoast Video in Bangor, Maine in July, 1991 that first brought me into range of the 1932 Fredric March Hollywood horror movie on home video. And for all of those thirty-one years, I have only known Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) as a sea of film dirt, hairs, film wear lines, et cetera. Every film frame seemed to have some blemish. Now, with the Warner Archive Blu-Ray, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) has been so restored as to look virtually pristine. Contrast levels and blacks are gorgeous. Detail in the image is astounding. And the picture is perfectly stable. No swaying back and forth. There are some missing film frames from splices to the film elements, but unless a Doctor Who Restoration Team sort of miracle can be applied to generate new frames based on information in adjacent ones, these flaws will always be in the movie. The missing frames are lost in the only known retained film elements of the movie's scenes. But they are few and far between. Mostly in the section of the movie focused on Jekyll's work at the charity hospital. And I would add that even the film splices heralding the missing frames are spotless.\n\nThe audio is a tad lower than I would expect, but still of a superlative quality. I heard none of the spittle-like sounds of old film.\n\nThe new commentary with Constantine Nasr and Steve Haberman is chalk-full of interesting discussion on the themes of Jekyll and Hyde, how various movie versions of it distinguished themselves from the others, what Robert Louis Stevenson wrote in his original draught, and even scenes known to be filmed and cut from the film before release, including one in Jekyll's first manifestation of Hyde in which Hyde trampled a little girl and provided money to the girl's parents to keep them quiet. The commentators remark about the expressive decor in the movie, the increasing ugliness of Hyde coinciding with his augmented brutality, Jekyll appearing to shrink while Hyde looks taller and taller, and, of course, the quality of the restoration. Many, many of their observations on the movie's artistry are very much on the mark, but they are incorrect when they say that Jekyll stays Hyde between persuading Ivy to come with him and Hyde coming into the Soho apartment while Ivy is talking with the landlady. It is very evident that Hyde looks much more advanced in his increased ugliness in the latter scene than in the former one. Every time Jekyll transforms to Hyde, Hyde's features look more repulsive. Therefore, he must have transformed into Hyde a couple of times that we do not see, between the two scenes. This is supported in the dialogue between Lanyon and Poole. Poole says to Lanyon that, during Muriel's absence, Jekyll has come and gone via the back door of the laboratory and that he, Poole, has tended not to see Jekyll for days at a time. So, Jekyll has transformed back to his better self a couple of times at least, for Poole to see him at those times of which Poole speaks. It is a weakness of the movie that we are only told by exposition that Jekyll transformed from Hyde back to himself and back to Hyde again a number of times during Muriel's absence. It would have been more interesting to show at least some of that. Jekyll endeavouring to do some doctor's duties while itching to be Hyde again, and Jekyll wrestling with his conscience and then relenting to the temptation of yet another drink of the potion. Maybe some of that was scripted, or even filmed. All in all, it is an outstanding commentary. I will return to it, I feel sure.\n\nThe radio play is amazing. Fredric March was in his fifties when he did the play. He sounds older, distinctly less effervescent as Jekyll than in the movie, while Hyde guffaws exactly as in scenes in the film. The play adheres to the Stevenson novella much, much more than the movie, Jekyll is the middle-aged men envisioned by Stevenson, and there are conversations between Jekyll and Hyde, as March alternates between the two personalities in them, Hyde tempting Jekyll with unrestrained indulgence in sinful pleasure, and Jekyll expressing revulsion to Hyde at Hyde's violent deeds. The Utterson character is significantly more significant than in the movie. And Lanyon dies after witnessing the Hyde-to-Jekyll transition. It is not a perfect audio capture of the play. Another radio station can be heard in the distance. But it is an awesome addition to the value-added material. I tip my hat to whoever supplied it for the Blu-Ray.\n\nThursday, November 3, 2022.\n\nSunday, November 6, 2022.\n\nMy computer hard drive had a catastrophic failure this past Thursday, and I purchased a new computer at Best Buy yesterday. All told, the transaction cost me upwards of $1100. I pray that this computer lasts longer than its predecessor, which was not operational for even five years, and was increasingly sluggish in the final two years of its use.\n\nWebsite updates of the past week were all to autobiographical Web pages, the addition to them of images of episodes of The New Avengers. The images of New Avengers episodes \"Sleeper\" and \"Gnaws\", long an inclusion in my Era 2 memoirs, are now accompanied by images of the titling of those episodes. Some new images of \"Hostage\" and a new set of images of \"Complex\" are now in Era 4, and I added a image of the titling to \"Dead Men Are Dangerous\" to a collage of images of that episode in Era 7.\n\nIf ever there comes a time when I feel motivated to add more Web pages to my Website, one on The New Avengers would be very near the top of the list of possibilities. I have always admired that television series' ingenious formula and its episode structure style (e.g. the use of prologue ending in freeze-frame, and the main introduction with the three heroes uniting into a coat of arms, and the episode title on top of same freeze-frame), music, and many of the story ideas and certain curiously recurring subject matter. I especially love the fantastic nature of several of its episodes (those of Season 1, mostly). It is so sad that the television show's presence on home video is so lacking in quality, even by DVD standards. Network Distributing was planning a Blu-Ray release, but for inability to come to some particular terms, that Blu-Ray release was abandoned. And the primary rights holder, StudioCanal, does not appear to be interested in itself releasing The New Avengers to Blu-Ray to go alongside the existing Blu-Rays of the original Avengers.\n\nAnother reason why I like The New Avengers is the number of Space: 1999 actors and actresses In it. Which is to be expected, one supposes, as it was made at Pinewood Studios, its first season before the cameras in the same year that saw the production of Season 2 Space: 1999. Gareth Hunt, who played third lead character Mike Gambit, was in Space: 1999. Other actors, and actresses, in both television programmes were Prentis Hancock, Peter Cushing, Michael Sheard, Roy Boyd, Kevin Stoney, Michael Culver, Stuart Damon, Yasuko Nagazumi, Pamela Stephenson, Peter Porteous, Ina Skriver, Gary Waldhorn, Roy Marsden, Eric Carte, and Jeremy Young.\n\nIn some of my more fanciful ruminations of late, I have been contemplating how The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" might fit into the universe and continuity of Space: 1999. In his book, Space: 1999- The Vault, Chris Bentley posits that the characters of The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" may be contemporaries of the Moonbase Alphans, venturing into space on the near-light-speed spaceship, the Altares, sometime before the Moon is blasted out of Earth orbit. He notes that the mission of the Altares would have to initiate before Space: 1999's opener, \"Breakaway\", as the Moon is shown being passed by the Altares after the latter's departure from Earth-orbiting Space Station Delta. Very true, this. The Moon is seen shortly after the Altares left Space Station Delta.\n\nThe Ultra Probe in 1996 needed a travel time of eight months to reach the outer Solar System. Light would reach that far from Earth within a range of five to six hours. To go from Ultra Probeship speeds to a drive capable of propelling a spaceship almost as fast as light is a leap that would seem highly improbable within a three-year window. But let one assume that a breakthrough in photon propulsion did occur in the mid-1990s. Would Cellini and his crew have been so enthusiastic about boarding one of the alien spaceships in the \"graveyard\" if near-light-speed technology were already a distinct possibility on Earth? Okay. Maybe the breakthrough was during the Ultra mission and Cellini and company were not told about it. But this is too short a time, I would think, to have a test craft ready to go, and to be considered safe enough for children to crew it, sometime before mid-1999. And the existence of Space Station Delta, the \"jump-off point\" for humanity's venture to the stars, is rather problematic. As is seen in both \"Dragon's Domain\" and \"Breakaway\", it is the Centauri Space Dock that is that \"jump-off point\". It and Moonbase Alpha itself. Centauri Space Dock looks quite unimpressive compared with Space Station Delta. If Space Station Delta exists at the same time as Centauri Space Dock and clearly has so much more to it, why not use it for the launching of the Meta Probe in 1999? It must have more facilities, surely, by dint of its size. Moreover, the crew of the Altares, if they were of the late 1990s, would be shuttled in an Eagle to Space Station Delta and not the spacecraft in which they are shown to be transported.\n\nI still very much like the idea of The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" being in Space: 1999's universe. Indeed, mention in The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" of the ecosystem of Earth being in a state of advanced deterioration would fit with what was shown to have become of Earth in \"Journey to Where\". The technology in The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" very closely resembles that in Space: 1999, though perhaps a decade or two more advanced in some respects. The clothing styles are remarkably similar. As is that of luggage.\n\nSo, how might I envisage The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" being in the Space: 1999 universe? How could I possibly explain the Moon being shown in Earth's vicinity if it is decades after \"Breakaway\" when The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" commences? Simple. It is not the Moon but a projection of an image of the Moon. After losing the Moon, the peoples of Earth craved the aesthetic of Moonlight. That and the illumination of the nighttime sky that the Moon had provided. So, after Space Station Delta was built to replace Moonbase Alpha as Earth's supreme achievement, a decision was made to astral-project an image of the Moon in continuous orbit, the source of astral-projection being Space Station Delta as it circles Earth. And now that this one item has been dealt-with, it is quite possible to position The Day After Tomorrow- \"Into Infinity\" somewhere in the early twenty-first century. Who knows? Maybe someday, the Altares may encounter Moonbase Alpha. Now, there is an idea for story material for fan fiction writers.\n\nImage of the front cover to the U.K. Blu-Ray release of Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, a movie produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson that may be said to be easy to fit into the universe of Space: 1999, also a production of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson.\n\nIt is easier still to place Journey to the Far Side of the Sun in Space: 1999's universe, for there is no sign of the Moon in Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. No mention. No visualisation. Indeed, with the discovery of the other planet, Earth's mirror image, the sight of an alternate, mirrored Moon would be a \"tip-off\" of the mirrored Earth notion quite awhile before Col. Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) comes to his realisation about the mirrored world. As there is no such \"tip-off\", no sighting of a mirror Moon in orbit around the mirror Earth, one can only conclude that the Moon is no longer in orbit about the Earth in Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. Logical, no?\n\nJourney to the Far Side of the Sun may therefore be posited to occur in a post-\"Breakaway\" time. A time wherein the governments of Earth all point fingers for the disaster on 13 September, 1999, with the World Space Commission soon becoming everyone's scapegoat, it having been overseer of the nuclear waste disposal programme. The World Space Commission loses public favour and government funding, and is disbanded. With public interest in space exploration still high, old national or regional space agencies begin to reassert themselves. Eurosec reaches dominance outside of the United States, and it is exceedingly security-conscious, as is N.A.S.A., with a Soviet space agency being of a concern. The U.S.S.R. may no longer be an expansionist, West-threatening country, but there are factions in that country that are determined to change this if they attain power. Eurosec chooses to eschew the old W.S.C. systems of technology in favour of new such systems of its own. The Eagle is \"mothballed\" at all space agencies, as it is most symbolic of the discredited W.S.C.. Work commences on replacing Moonbase Alpha with Space Station Delta, but until Space Station Delta construction is in an advanced stage, it cannot be a \"jump-off point\" for any exploratory space flights. Therefore, launches of such space flights from Earth, have to be done. So, this is the world as it is in Journey to the Far Side of the Sun in, say, the early 2010s. Sometime thereafter, space agencies converge again, maybe after photon propulsion is discovered, and there are preliminary plans to build the Altares, with everyone determined to work together on the awesome new project. Space Station Delta reaches completion of construction, and it replaces Moonbase Alpha as the \"stepping stone\" for expansion of humanity into the cosmos. Shortly after completion of Space Station Delta, the astral projection of the Moon starts to be cast.\n\nSome ideas to consider. I am not planning as yet to incorporate any of this into my Space: 1999 Chronology, but maybe if I feel so-inclined, I will do so. Someday.\n\nIt is the morning of 11 November, 2022.\n\nForty-five years ago to this day, my father and I embarked our car for a northbound trek, from Nashwaaksis, Fredericton to the village of Douglastown in New Brunswick's Miramichi region. From the new home that we had made for ourselves, for better or for worse, in a growing suburb of Fredericton, to the small community in which our former home had been situated. From a place in which I had as yet no friends, nor any prospective friends, to the surroundings in which I had had more than a dozen friends and where my closest friend, Michael, had invited me for a weekend stay. Michael was the only friend I have ever had, to extend an invitation to me for being a accommodated guest for a number of days (those people in Calgary and Regina in the mid-1990s are excluded from this as they were not my real friends).\n\nFour images of an episode of the television series, Logan's Run, that was titled as \"Crypt\", and which aired on CHSJ-TV in New Brunswick on the evening of Friday, November 11, 1977, when I was staying with my friend Michael, in Douglastown along the Miramichi River, and snacking, with Michael, on some Jiffy Pop popcorn.\n\nAll of the particulars of that weekend are chronicled in my Era 3 memoirs. But I will invoke most of them again here. November 11-13, 1977 being a weekend in which I was with a best friend after nearly three months of being without the company of any friend, and also the weekend on which I first saw the \"Dragon's Domain\" episode of Space: 1999, with Michael and his family watching it with me, it naturally has a very, very indelible imprint on my memory. I can still visualise everything in that weekend as clearly as if it all happened yesterday. Eyeing the central New Brunswick scenery from the windows of our car as it sped northward on a course of approximately a hundred miles under grey skies. The trees in their late-autumn appearance. The deciduous ones leafless, the evergreens in their most faded colour. Listening with amusement to a radio station's transmission of the Napoleon XIV song, \"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\" (the things that radio stations played back then!). Eating at the Newcastle Dairy Queen with my father. Having a hot dog there. Reuniting with Michael in front of his place as a light rain was starting to fall. My father bidding adieu to me before he left us to return to Fredericton. Michael and I playing Space: 1999 in his house, most memorably his parents' room, in the afternoon hours of that Friday. The two of us sharing Jiffy Pop popcorn as we watched an episode of Logan's Run called \"Crypt\" that evening. Watching Coming Up Rosie and Spiderman in between servings of Saturday morning breakfast. Later that morning watching The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams. Listening to my Power Records version of \"Dragon's Domain\" that I had brought with me, on Michael's living room stereo. Michael and I going with Michael's mother on a sunny afternoon shopping expedition in Chatham. Kraft Dinner for supper as the 6 P.M. airtime for Space: 1999 beckoned. An overlong college football game looking like it was going to cut into the alotted hour for my favourite space television programme and me preparing myself to cope with the frustration of that. And yes, it did occur. Space: 1999 would be joined already in progress at close to 6:05 (curiously, this was the only time in Space: 1999's full CBC television network run that it was joined in progress- in my part of the country, at least). I remember exactly when in the episode that was. When Helena said, \"Anything traumatic?\" to Tony Cellini.\n\nI remember every sight of the episode that did impact my eyeballs. I remember the awe that I felt at sight of the Ultra Probeship, its interior and exterior, and at sound of the music that I would eventually know was \"library track\" composition, Albinoni's Adagio in G-Minor. It was a magnificent series of scenes as the Ultra Probeship moved gracefully through space and reached its objective, the planet Ultra, and then \"veered off\" to investigate something else. I remember being too scared to watch the monster scenes. I remember where in the episode I needed to flip the sides of my \"compact cassette\" in my audiotape machine. During an exchange of dialogue in Commissioner Dixon's office. I remember the advertisement for CBC coverage of the next day's Toronto Santa Claus Parade, and that being before the episode began its second act, with the Ultra Probeship encountering the \"spaceship graveyard\". I remember every cut scene in the episode as it was shown that evening. I remember watching The Muppet Show and the \"Pigs in Space\" segment therein, that aired on CHSJ-TV from 7 to 7:30 that evening. Watching it as I read sections of the novelisation of \"Dragon's Domain\" that I had brought with me, and the synopsis of the episode in The Making of Space: 1999, which I had also had in my possession for my stay with Michael. I remember the audiotape-recorded interview that Michael did with me with regard to \"Dragon's Domain\" to fill my audiocassette (God, I wish I still had that!), that being done after The Muppet Show as Lou Grant was airing. I remember Michael sitting with me on the bed provided to me for my stay and trying to assure me that I would not have nightmares about the monster. It was futile, for I did indeed have nightmares, and not just on that one night. And I remember the bus ride back home on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Michael and his mother saying farewell to me as I boarded the bus. Sitting in the middle of the very back seat of the bus. The man to my left periodically wiping condensation from the bus window. Reading my books to pass the time on the more-than-two-hour return to Fredericton on that bus, it stopping at the usual places. Blackville. Doaktown. Boiestown. My parents collecting me at the Fredericton Queen Street bus depot as night was starting to fall. The images of all of these are as vivid in my memory as they ever were. I still have the books and the vinyl record that I had then. And I have the entirety of Space: 1999 on Blu-Ray, including \"Dragon's Domain\" (with no less than three audio commentaries and a \"Making-of\" featurette). But people who were part of that weekend are either dead (my parents) or far, far out of reach in the Earthly side of spiritual existence. Michael and I have not seen one another in forty-two years. I have not seen Michael's mother and sister since that weekend (I was in Douglastown again with Michael in May of 1978, but I do not remember seeing any of his family on that occasion). There are times when I find myself wondering if it all actually happened, or was a dream. Sometimes, it feels like my life these past ten, twelve years since my parents' passing, was always my reality. That I have always been alone in my house, devoid of the physical presence within and without the house's walls, of family and friends.\n\nI do not expect anyone to understand such a feeling, as my experience would seem to be unique. It does daunt me to think that it has been forty-five years since that memorable weekend. This is a feeling, at least, to which many a person of my generation, and older generations, can relate.\n\nAll for today.\n\nWednesday, November 16, 2022.\n\nFredericton is receiving its first late-2022 snowfall today. And there are no warm temperatures in the forecast for melting of the snow. Almost all of Canada is now north of the jet stream, with the country beset with waves of Arctic air. With the price of home heating skyrocketing, it is the worst possible time for Canada to have a longer, colder winter than normal.\n\nI am currently working on an assemblage of Rocket Robin Hood episode title cards, to put in my Era 4 memoirs. They are requiring some digital tweaking to remove digital compression artifacts. The third season episode title cards all have slanted text of variable size, and I lack software for correcting that. I do not remember ever seeing a third season Rocket Robin Hood episode with perfectly set text in its title card. Ralph Bakshi and team may have been working so fast on Rocket Robin Hood that precision work on titles was not \"on the cards\", the pun be pardoned. All film prints of the episodes may show the same flawed titling.\n\nSecond volume in the DVD release of Rocket Robin Hood.\n\nIt has been twelve and thirteen years since the DVD release of Rocket Robin Hood. Even for DVD of 2009 and 2010, the look of Rocket Robin Hood in its imprinting on DVD platters was quite deficient, and was criticised by many a DVD collector at the time. If indeed the best possible masters of the television series were sourced for that release, it would seem that Rocket Robin Hood has not received the best archival care since its heydays on Canadian television. I watched \"Who'll Kill Rocket Robin?\" last evening, and on my sixty-three inch High Definition television, and it looked exceedingly tatty. Colours having a bleached look. An abysmal paucity of detail on everything other than character close-ups. A pasty mess of artifacts on the blacks that are far from being inky. And portions of the lower frame at top of screen, and of upper frame on at screen bottom. I had over-scan on my televisions of the 1970s and 1980s, to be sure, and it may have hidden the flaws to the film framing, on broadcasts of Rocket Robin on ATV, CHSJ, and MITV. But something could have been done to compensate for this issue. Blackening the bottom and top inches of the frame, maybe, to cover over the flaws.\n\nOh, I know any new product involving Rocket Robin Hood is a forlorn hope. The world was fortunate to have had a DVD release of it, whatever the picture quality. But on a television screen of current standard, it is light-years away from premium image.\n\nSpiderman, on the other hand, looks magnificent upscaled to High Definition on my home theatre screen. The 2004 Spiderman DVD box set continues to be a winner.\n\nThe Golden Age Cartoons Facebook group has been inactive since mid-August. It is a record amount of time for that particular Facebook group to be devoid of activity. I am not going to hazard a guess as to why this is the case. I am just noting the lack of any postings these past three months.\n\nMore addendum to my autobiographical Web pages on the subject of Tony. Some weeks ago, I was musing about considering him to be an associate rather than a friend. My thinking since then has gone further along that particular train. I am more sanguine than ever about utilising the associate designation where Tony is concerned. But still, I balk at doing a comprehensive revision of my life's story to make alterations to incorporate my new perspective.\n\nWith the benefit of 20/20 hindsight of several decades now, I perceive that Tony's interest in me was not friendship, but close association, association in the appreciation of works of imaginative entertainment. I was perhaps the only person he knew who liked everything that he did, and who expressed that liking in ways that were of appeal and inspiration for him. And we collaborated in the making of audiotape-recorded renditions of our own of Star Wars and other movies, basement clubs dedicated to entertainment favourites, showings on audiotape and RCA VideoDisc and videotape of our favourite works, and we compared collections of toys, books, magazines, bubble gum cards, and RCA VideoDiscs, and conversed on these items at my place and his and while en route to and from school (in school years 1981-2 and 1983-4, and in afternoons in 1979 when he met me on my way to home from school), and we combined videocassette recorders for the copying of videotapes and partook in neighbourhood baseball games. And we did go to several movies together. We did all of this. As close associates. Essential parameters of friendship, \"having my back\" when I was under verbal attack, i.e. telling my attackers to \"back off\", being someone with whom I could confide about hurt feelings, being morally supportive at times when I felt beleaguered, inviting me to birthday celebrations when everyone else in his and his brother's social life was invited, speaking of me as friend, buddy, pal, and sometimes being demonstrably affectionate, that is in a tactile way, were all absent. Yes, he resisted the allure of Andre, my sworn enemy, when David B., Eric, and Mike J. flocked to that person of clear antipathy for me. But Andre was not Tony's kind of person. Andre did not care for science fiction/fantasy. He liked sports that were mostly not Tony's cup of tea. So, Tony's continued association with me when the others were leaving me aside, was logical, within the context of an associate. Tony was annoyed with Joey calling at my door in late summer of 1979, but his annoyance was with me putting on pause something on which Tony and I were working, to go outside with Joey for awhile. It was not a friend's jealousy. The concept of that was anathema to Tony.\n\nI did not think any of this back in the day. I considered Tony a friend. Even after he moved to Moncton and returned to our Nashwaaksis neighbourhood a year later and my expectations from him were limited, I still applied the word, friend, to him, in my thoughts. To be sure, Tony was the only person with whom I had occasion for videocassette-recorder-combination. And through him, I had connection to his brother, Steven, and to all of Steven's friends, and thereby had successful runs of video shows and such, and participation in baseball games with four, five, six persons on each team. My association with Tony had practical value. In addition to his having interests kindred with mine.\n\nBut, yes, Tony did \"let me down\" that awful evening in April of 1979. He did so again and again when he was dismissive of me in presence of others. And when he had no time for me on his cousin's August of 1979 visit. And when he had me be one of the last people to sign his ankle cast. And when I was kept away from the birthday parties (do I mention that in my memoirs?). And when he did not tell my detractors on the baseball field, one of them his own brother, to desist from the verbal slings and arrows. On the basis of all of this, plus the lack of any reference to me with the word, friend, or words of the same meaning, I must decline the designation of friend for Tony. Again, I am not about to undertake a revision of several of my autobiography's eras, to incorporate this therein. Not today. But maybe tomorrow. Yes, maybe tomorrow.\n\nI do not remember writing of the non-invitations to Tony and Steven's birthday party, in my life's story. I think that I did make mention of some baseball games turning ugly. But I think that I preferred to skirt that particular matter because my intention back in 2005 in the writing of my Era 4 memoirs, was to cast Era 4 in a mostly positive light, in a largely rosy mental picture. But now, today, I am more inclined to facing and writing about all truths of the eras of my life, including those of which my recall is one of fondness. The majority of the baseball games that I played in Era 4 were enjoyable. Less so when I lost, of course, but if I was respectfully treated in losing a game, I would accept the loss with dignity and concede to having had a good time. And in Era 4's first half, most especially in 1983, I won most of the games that I played. But if I was losing, and was losing in the midst of a slump, my armour had gaps that could be penetrated to hurtful purpose. Such was the case in the latter years of Era 4. Steven, sometimes with the collaboration of Craig and his party, and oftentimes with the participation of one or two of Steven's brigade, would lead the charge to subject me to derogatory taunting, \"gaslighting\", \"rubbing my nose in\" my imminent loss as though it were an indictment against my worth or lack thereof as a player of baseball and a person of any respectability in the neighbourhood. I was goaded into departing the game, with disparaging remarks flung at my back. Tony was always, always present during these incidents. And never did he intercede in my favour. He did not come after me after I left the game, to offer consolation. There are no criteria in this for Tony to qualify as a friend. Eventually, Steven and company banned me from participating in their games. Did Tony partake in those? I think so.\n\nIt is difficult for me to invoke these memories. They underscore how devoid of real friends that I was in even my best Fredericton years, those of Era 4. No one who was present during those baseball games gone awry and said nothing in my support, should be regarded as a friend. Craig, however, did have a few moments where he did \"stand up\" for me, putting him in temporary, on-again/off-again friend territory. He was most definitely off-again at those adverse times on the baseball diamond. And Steven could be rather kind to me from time to time.\n\nWhy was Steven so nasty to me during those baseball games? It probably had to do with Steven's disliking of Joey and of Joey and I being friends. Probably. Very probably. It was Steven's opinion, I feel sure, that Tony was my friend and my best friend and that Joey's presence in my life as a friend was an intrusion on my connection with Tony. And Steven would not accept Joey being my assistant-partner in a video show. Some days after Joey was such for my showing of Superman in August of 1982, Steven cornered me and expressed his disagreement and disapproval with my opting for close friendship with Joey. No doubt that Superman video show was what sparked Steven to make known to me how unpopular with him my close friendship with Joey was. My not ceding to Steven's stance on the matter of me and Joey, no doubt irked him. Striking at me through the baseball game unpleasantness followed from that, I do believe. Particularly at times I was vulnerable (i.e. when I was losing). And yet, Steven had moments of respect and kindness toward me. Even in the weeks, months, years after my close friendship with Joey had become evident. This may have had some connection with the times of friction for Joey and I, Steven approving of Joey and I being separate from each other. Yes, if my memory serves me correctly, Steven's niceness toward me did tend to coincide with the times when Joey and I were not on best of terms.\n\nMy revised perspective on Eras 3 and 4 is that Tony was a valued associate, but far short of the definition of friend. Steven, likewise. Craig by and large an associate only, and almost totally for purposes of playing baseball, with some rare instances of friendship. Joey. He was a friend. A friend who frequently had umbrage with me and my ways, and therefore not guaranteed to be always of favourable bearing toward me. But a friend, all the same. My best friend, certainly, after summer of 1982. And I would say that Tony being just an associate in Era 3, the position of my best friend was open in those years to anyone who was interested in being best friends with me. Joey did not replace Tony, as the best friend position in had been vacant, vacant in Fredericton since 1977, and vacant comprising both Douglastown and Fredericton, since Michael and I had had our \"falling out\" in 1980. I would say that Joey actually replaced Michael.\n\nJoey was not present on any of the occasions when I was taunted and prodded into quitting a playing of baseball. I think that if he was, he would have been on my side and at my defence. Perhaps Steven and the others knew this and did not trouble me if Joey was present. They did not want to see Joey coming to my defence, and did not want for me to see that, for if I did, the friendship between Joey and I would be closer than it was.\n\nI was able to have a sizable number of quality times in Era 4 under the conditions that existed. I guess that this is what matters, ultimately. If I divorce them from memory of the unpleasant experiences on the baseball diamond and in some other locations, I can, in my mind, put myself back to those quality times and still have a feeling of satisfaction. Like a certain September of 1983 baseball game in which I was team captain, pitcher of decision, and victorious. In which people wanted to be on team Kevin. In which Joey, my teammate and best buddy, \"had my back\" after someone on our team leapt onto it when our opponents were starting to close the run gap between theirs and ours. If Steven or perhaps even Tony himself, do not like my changing of the designation of Tony from best friend of Era 3 to associate then and in Era 4, I cannot recant that. All that I will say is that their presence in my life as associates had value and was appreciated for the quality times that their presence did foster. And I will also note that they did not disparage Space: 1999 or my affection for it. I appreciate that greatly. Though they did not ever defend it or me for liking it, when it or I were being verbally attacked.\n\nTo be sure, the years of my life's third era would have been socially much emptier for lack of the presence of Tony. I would have been totally alone in my following of Cosmos 1999 in 1979 and at most of the movies that I went to see from 1978 to 1982, including The Empire Strikes Back. And I expediently left aside some of Tony's problematical deeds, including those of 12 April, 1979, because I knew this. The bottom line is that I can be appreciative of Tony and others as associates and not friends. But of course, I should desire to have friends, too. Associates alone are insufficient for a thoroughly fulfilling social existence. Which is maybe why I am cold, in the main, toward Era 3.\n\nAll for today.\n\nSunday, November 27, 2022.\n\nTim Beddows (1963-2022).\n\nSad news to report. Tim Beddows of Network Distributing, the man responsible for that U.K. company's restorations and releases onto home video media of vintage television programmes, has died at the disturbingly early age of 59. Just three years senior to me, he was. Mr. Beddows' name can be seen on the opening to the \"These Episodes\" documentary on the Space: 1999 DVD and Blu-Ray sets of Network Distributing and also of North America's Shout! Factory, as Executive Producer of that documentary. Mr. Beddows was the man who green-lit every release of Space: 1999 by Network, including the DVD Special Edition for Season 1 in 2005, the Blu-Ray release of Season 1 in 2010, the Blu-Ray and DVD release of Season 2 in 2015, the complete television series Blu-Ray sets of Space: 1999 under the Network label, and the Super Space Theatre project of last year. I do not believe it to be hyperbolic to say that without Tim Beddows, Space: 1999's only kick of the can in the digital video disc formats of home video media would have been the very deficient releases on DVD by A & E and Carlton of the very early 2000s. Space: 1999 would not have looked as magnificent as it does on my sixty-three-inch television were it not for Tim Beddows. I tip my hat eternally to him and will be forever grateful for all that he has done for my favourite television programme. I would say that Space: 1999 is the crown jewel in all that he achieved in his tenure at Network Distributing. But then, I would, would I not? I am certainly not unbiased. But the restoration of Season 2 and the Blu-Ray release of same was voted the Network effort of the year in 2015. May Mr. Tim Beddows so rest in peace.\n\nI have to say also that I applaud Mr. Beddows' decision to not commission any of Kindred's Space: 1999 Documentary for the Season 2 release. I made the unwise decision to sit through it again last evening. The cranky whinging about Fred Freiberger and the decisions made for second season just goes on and and on and on and on. One person after another. No counter-opinion. Was any effort even made to find one? I could say the same thing for the AlphaCon documentary of 1991. Erwin Stank was there to offer some commentary for Season 2 being funny, and to say that he liked it \"a lot\" for the \"bug-eyed monsters\", before remarking that he \"grew into\" first season some years later, the implication being that Season 2 was nothing but un-serious \"kiddie stuff\". And outside of him, there was the usual nose-in-the-air derision and the tired, old (old even for then) complaints. But in the old Space: 1999 Alliance, and less so in the monumentally skewed Alpha League, there were some people who had time enough for second season to offer some artwork or fan fiction. And there were in the mid-1990s, when the documentary was produced, still some fans who were complimenting of at least some of Season 2. \"Journey to Where\". \"The AB Chrysalis\". \"Seed of Destruction\". \"The Bringers of Wonder\". There was a fan club for Catherine Schell as Maya. To be sure, John Hug was quite praising of the production in an interview that he did for Starlog. Kevin Connor has only good things to say for the episodes that he directed. Terrance Dicks was reportedly happy with how the one episode that he wrote, \"The Lambda Factor\", was produced. And I know that a latter-day interview with Fred Freiberger was not sought, for him to respond to the scathing criticisms, one after the other, in The Space: 1999 Documentary. He was not aware of the documentary's existence until I mentioned it to him. Johnny Byrne particularly comes across in the documentary as an exceedingly bitter old man with scarcely any professional courtesy. Someone told me that Mr. Byrne was critical of how his contributions to the documentary were handled in the editing. I do not know. I do not know if different editing choices would have diluted his clear invective for Fred Freiberger and the twenty-four episodes of Season 2. Bottom line is that there were people other than me (I do not count; I am garbage) who might have been sought for alternative viewpoints on Season 2, in the interest of fairness.\n\nNow, of course, every fan hates everything from the opening of \"The Metamorph\" to the close of \"The Dorcons\". The bandwagon against second season became an everyone-aboard steamroller after I left Alpha League in 1995 to many a jeer at my back, the Internet Mailing List became the primary forum for hate for Season 2, and the documentary was held high in the air as the definitive \"take\" on everything to do with Space: 1999 and its production. That was before the Facebook years, which have to be acknowledged as the nadir of fan discourse. I am happy that most of that discourse is closed to the general public, now that the majority of the Space: 1999 Facebook groups are private.\n\nAs I say, I do applaud Mr. Beddows for avoiding use of the documentary's second half (that which lambastes Season 2 and denies the existence of any appreciative following of it) for the Season 2 Blu-Ray set. Of course, value-added content on later releases, those of Shout! and, yes, Imprint, do \"pick up the slack\" for repudiating of Season 2 and telling of people how awful that it is and how foolish people must be, to want to watch it. But anyway.\n\nI have been doing some work on my Website. New to my autobiography are images of the cartoons, \"Wet Hare\", \"Big House Bunny\", and \"Mad as a Mars Hare\" (in Era 2), images of Rocket Robin Hood title cards and some additional Doctor Who memories of 1986 ( in Era 4), and a new image of Doctor Who- \"The War Games\" ( in Era 6). There is a High Definition video of \"Wet Hare\" on Dailymotion in fully restored form (\"Wet Hare\" was one of the Bugs cartoons left off of the Blu-Ray set of 2020), from which I was able to do a screen capture. After some tweaking to remove digital compression artifacts, I added that screen capture to an existing assembly of images of Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour episode nine.\n\nI wish that I had a means of preserving these High Definition videos of unreleased-on-Blu-Ray cartoons and burning some Blu-Rays of my own, but I lack the software and a Blu-Ray burner. Is someone out there in the world doing this? I sure do hope so. Physical media does not appear to have much time left. Companies like Warner Brothers would love for no one to possess physical copies of anything and to have to pay for ephemeral enjoyment of them on an Internet \"streaming\" service. Only the more steadfast collectors such as myself want to possess their entertainment favourites as personal property, anymore. A day or two ago, I saw some executive saying that people only pay for the enjoyment of the material being watched and not the physical product itself, when they do purchase a DVD or a Blu-Ray. And that therefore it would be allowable for a person to own nothing, enjoy something provided on demand for a single viewing, and be happy with that. No, I most emphatically say. When I buy a Blu-Ray, I am buying it to possess the entertainment as a physical property on my shelf in my home. A sizable amount of my satisfaction in watching that entertainment, comes from the knowledge that I own it. That it is mine. Not unusual, this. It is the mindset of the collector. And I am damned well not going to be propagandised or indoctrinated out of it. I pray that there are enough collectors like me to \"push back\" against any effort to divest us of our prized possessions. Own nothing and be happy, eh? Bull's excrement! I will never, ever, ever be happy owning nothing.\n\nWhile I am on the subject of owning entertainment on physical media, there is some Blu-Ray release news to report.\n\nFront cover to the Imprint Blu-Ray company in Australia's February of 2023 release to Blu-Ray optical disc of the third Bad News Bears movie, The Bad News Bears Go to Japan.\n\nImprint has announced its February, 2023 Blu-Ray releases, and among them is The Bad News Bears Bears Go to Japan. So, I was right that the last entry in the original Bears series of films would eventually be on Blu-Ray. It was a logical thing to suppose, given that the first two Bears movies were released by Imprint, in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Of course, I will buy the Blu-Ray of The Bad News Bears Bears Go to Japan and retire the DVD that I have had of same since 2002. I do not remember watching that DVD more than twice. The Bad News Bears Bears Go to Japan is, by all objective measure, a dire Bears movie, and a deficient example of cinema in general. Tony Curtis' character is an unlikable donkey's derriere from the start of the movie to the end, and the movie is a protracted rendition of the \"old hat\" fish-out-of-water trope. A series of unfunny clashes between cultures strung along by a dull, dull Kelly Leak romance. The pacing is leaden. There is almost no baseball played in it. Two of the Bears whose presence was vital to the appeal of the previous movies, Tanner and Lupus, are absent without mention. Which is unforgivable, as Tanner wanting to win the big game for \"the Looper\" so that the two of them could go to Japan was a major component to the story of the movie prior to this one. And some other bears fall by the wayside, too. Moreover, the Bears winning the game in the Astrodome in the prior movie was said to be rewarded with a game in Japan. The game in Japan ought therefore to be guaranteed. So, why are the Bears looking at start of this movie for a sponsor for them to go to Japan? Why is Lazar (Curtis) their manager in addition to being their sponsor? What baseball coaching experience does he have? The cardinal sin of the movie is that it is boring. There are some beautiful visuals of Japan sprinkled here and there, between a wrestling (yes, wrestling!) scene involving Lazar and a love scene between Kelly and his Japanese girl-friend. But is one watching this movie for a travelogue or for baseball action with a favourite Little League team? As I say, I only watched the DVD of it twice. I never had it on VHS videocassette. I did have it on open-reel audiotape to go with its two predecessors, which I also had on open-reel audiotape. All three having been captured on audiotape from broadcasts on television. I remember doing the audiotape-recording of an ATV Saturday late-night telecast of The Bad News Bears Bears Go to Japan. Unlike the two previous Bears movies, it was not included in my roster of entertainments for Cine-Audio showings. Anyone who might have come would doubtless have \"bailed\" on it less than a half-hour into it.\n\nRumour is that the Doctor Who season to be released after Season 2 next month, will be Season 9. Not my favourite of the Jon Pertwee seasons, but definitely one that can benefit from new restoration work combining NTSC video and telecine recordings, as a few other serials of the Pertwee years have. I will welcome it, but as I have said before, with the pace at which seasons are now being released, I doubt that the entirety of the library of existing episodes of Doctor Who will be on Blu-Ray, and I do not believe that Season 13 will be released before Blu-Ray manufacture is suspended. Sometime around 2025, I expect.\n\nAll for today.\n\nWednesday, November 30, 2022.\n\nFrom time to time, I Google \"Hyde and Hare\", out of curiosity on whether or not my article on the cartoon is receiving recognition, and also on whether there might be some gorgeous new works \"spun off\" from the cartoon, its elements, its aesthetic, and occasionally, as this Weblog has shown, I come upon something very impressive, so much so that I choose to acknowledge it and post an image of it to this Weblog. Such is the case today. And without further adieu, here is what someone somewhere has produced. By far, the most stunning cartoon character statuettes that I have ever seen. Outstanding craftmanship!\n\nOne imagines the hours of intricate labour that was put into this project. In clear contradiction to the dismissive attitudes of legions of cartoon fans at discussion forums where \"Hyde and Hare\" is concerned, the Bugs Bunny cartoon about the doctor with the chemically induced split personality, cannot be said not to imprint itself on some people's psyches, to such a degree that such people are motivated to bring that imprinting into some tangible reality. My imprinting begat my article. This person's imprinting has yielded an awesome pair of carved-from-clay statuettes. I cannot laud his or her work more highly than I now do. Magnificent! I wish that I could have one to sit alongside my Funko Pop figures of Bugs Bunny and Mr. Hyde (which still are pristine inside unopened packaging, by the way).\n\nAnd this superlative work of art is not all that I found in my Google search for \"Hyde and Hare\".\n\nA Podcast shortly before Halloween this year contained a discussion on Friz Freleng's three cartoon shorts employing the Jekyll-and-Hyde concept. It does meander into some other topics, and one has to be patient and stay with it until the conversation returns to the aforementioned subject, but it is a discourse that brought smiles to my face at numerous times. One of the participants even quotes some of my writing, though not my article on \"Hyde and Hare\", rather my tribute to Friz Freleng. The discussion on cartoons focuses mostly on \"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\", actually. Mention of \"Hyde and Hare\" and \"Hyde and Go Tweet\" is tangential to the attention given \"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\". The participants do offer some interesting new perspectives on \"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\". One of them saw that cartoon recently for the first time, and on a movie theatre screen, yet. He was struck at the core of his soul at how violent and how graphic in violence and intensely disturbing that some of the scenes are, most especially the one wherein the Sylvester monster emerges from a second transformation, i.e. the one that occurs in the private room with the table trunk, and surgically claws a petrified-with-terror Alfie into chunks, and Alfie soon falling to pieces in front of Chester.\n\nHere is the Hyperlink to that Podcast.\n\nhttps://thismeanspodcast.podbean.com/e/hyde-no-more-friz-freleng-s-dr-jekyll-adaptations-plus-james-gunn-takesleadership-at-dc-studios/\n\nDespite proclamations by my detractors at the Golden Age Cartoons discussion forum that I am totally alone and therefore of no value, eminently dismissible, in appreciation for \"Hyde and Hare\" and the other two Friz Freleng-directed nods to \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\" (such obvious efforts at \"gaslighting\" by people who reject the idea that anything not directed by Clampett, Avery, Jones, Tashlin could possibly garner valid, upholdable accolades), there continue to be people who prove that I am not the only person to whom \"Hyde and Hare\", and the other two, commanded recognition, aesthetic attention, and left some substantial impression.\n\nWhy, why, why cannot we have a Blu-Ray with all three of these cartoons? To date, \"Dr. Jerkyl's Hide\" is not on digital videodisc at all, \"Hyde and Go Tweet\" is on DVD only in a late 1990s film-to-video transfer, and almost all of its footage used in Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, is on the DVD of that movie. And \"Hyde and Hare\" is on DVD in Standard Definition and on Blu-Ray in an upscaled 1998 film-to-video transfer.\n\nSunday, December 4, 2022.\n\nSome warmer weather and some rain has rid Fredericton of the snow that it received in the third week of November. Hopefully, there will be sight of green grass and brown sand for another few weeks, and maybe, just maybe, it will be a green Christmas this year. Before the grip of winter tightens around New Brunswick as it has done in the Canadian western provinces.\n\nI came upon some magnificent art based on an episode of Spiderman (1967-70). Not an episode of the first season, which tends to receive the lion's share of Spiderman (1967-70)'s accolades, but one from Season 2 and the production team of Ralph Bakshi. Here it is.\n\nAs 2022 is approaching a close, I thought that I would mention, if I have not done so already, that 2022 marks twenty-five years since I began hosting my own Website. It is a remarkable achievement, maintaining a Website for so long, and continuing to add to it, while others went the way of the Do-Do or have been totally lethargic for many years. I remember very vividly the zeal, indeed the euphoria, that I felt as I pounded off of my keyboard paragraph after paragraph of text, and Web page after Web page pertaining to my favourite entertainments. The words flowed off of my fingers. I do not remember a single instance of \"writer's block\". And I was actually receiving positive feedback. Some. More than I can say that I ever had in my years of involvement in Space: 1999 fandom. Of course, accolades for my work vis-a-vis good old Space: 1999 were among the least abundant in those times (between 1997 and 2001) of daily incoming Internet communiques. Spiderman and Rocket Robin Hood, and The Littlest Hobo, were the subjects of most of the gratifying communication that I received in those days. I was rather dismayed not to find as much interest in my many Web pages on the Warner Brothers cartoons, which were, of everything about which I wrote, the most mainstream and most popular. In those years, at least. I was not full-time employed then and had ample time to add to my Website and \"keep up\" with every e-mail. I answered every e-mail, even the ones that scarcely acknowledged my work and asked me for something that I was unable to provide. Ignorant, rude e-mail in regards to my Website was rare. The bulk of the invective that I received was on Internet message forums. Though I did occasionally receive a communication from someone saying that I was wrong to write anything at all complimentary about Season 2 Space: 1999 (oh, of course). I also received an e-mail from someone supporting my campaign (in 2002) for a DVD release of Spiderman, who proceded to tell to me that my autobiography as it then existed, was unsatisfactory in that I failed to adequately outline the experiences with entertainments and social life, that shaped me. His criticism was rather undiplomatic, abrasive. But whether or not my life's story was inadequate in reportage of the formative experiences with entertainments, was a matter that I \"took to heart\", and I did a thorough revision of my autobiography, rewriting it almost \"from scratch\", hopefully sufficiently addressing the criticism. I did not arrogantly dismiss it \"out of hand\", much as it was lacking in diplomacy.\n\nMy long tenure on the Internet brought me into conflict with a number of persons and with groups of persons. One of those instances of strife led to my departure from the Internet community of cartoon fans at around the same time (in 2009) that my Internet site provider, Geocities, was abandoning its Website services. For some time, about eighteen months, I refrained from seeking another vendor of Internet space for my Website, and the Website was not available anywhere on the World Wide Web. The denunciations of me and my work in my confrontation with the league of detractors of my favourite cartoons, my work, and me, personally, had been deeply discouraging and upsetting (and for the bulk of the latter half of the 2000s correspondence on my Website had been sparse and seldom containing words of appreciation), and it was not the first time such an incident had occurred. As usual for most of my life, consoling friends were nowhere following the unpleasantness. I was quite unmotivated to seek out another provider of a niche in Cyberspace and return my Website to the World Wide Web. My mother's final words to me brought me to a decision to reconsider, and I eventually put almost all of my Website of old back on the Internet, through Webs.com. Thereafter, and especially after my father's death, I set to work on improving the look of the Website, vastly increasing and improving images. The work on such a project helped me through the weeks of lonely bereavement after my father's passing. And brief time periods of lethargy aside, I have not since then desisted from my Website work. There is almost always some project on the go, or in a queue to begin. I am not the sort of person who builds a Website and then does nothing more with it. The desire to improve, and to strive toward perfection, is always with me.\n\nAlas, these projects combined with full-time work, plus the responsibilities of maintaining a home all by myself, exercise, and the need for some relaxed time in front of my home theatre screen in evenings and on the weekends, has these past ten years drastically limited the amount of time that I have had for correspondence.\n\nI made the mistake some nights ago of watching a group review of the Space: 1999 first season episode, \"Ring Around the Moon\". I was only about ten minutes into the video before I sighed, fretted, and directed my computer mouse arrow to the top right corner of screen to \"close window\". I was subjected to some smug jokes about (who else?) Fred Freiberger. Some cantankerous huffing at mention of \"All That Glisters\", and David Hirsch (who worked with Gerry Anderson on the \"Space Report\" column in Starlog magazine back in 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981) referring in exasperation to \"the stupid rock episode\" in some disparaging commentary about the season that evidently no person of any consequence favours. I heard not a single observation on the episode that was supposed to be being discussed, before I decided that I had heard enough. No doubt, it was just going to be a litany of, \"At least it isn't 'Year 2', thank goodness,\" said with regard to quibbles with \"Ring Around the Moon\".\n\nI am not going to launch into yet another long defence of \"All That Glisters\". I have done that enough. But what is stupid about it? Really. What is stupid about it? Is Star Trek's living, intelligent rock episode, \"The Devil in the Dark\", widely dismissed as stupid? Or Doctor Who- \"The Stones of Blood\"? Living rocks were established in the Space: 1999 canon in \"Year 1\". In \"End of Eternity\". Intelligent life without anatomical brains was broached in \"Year 1\". In \"Alpha Child\". Possession of an Alphan for procurement of something was also done in \"Year 1\". In \"Force of Life\". Is all of this declared stupid in \"Year 1\"? Of course not. Like it or not (and if not then I do not care to know such a person), Season 2 with all of its otherworldly phenomena, fits in the Space: 1999 universe as it was established in Season 1. Only the style is different, and the different styles can be appreciated as long as one is not blinkered for life to the merits of Season 2. Is it the Dave Reilly character that is the source of the alleged stupidity? So, he's an Alphan of Irish descent with a quirky affection for old Texan lore. So, what? That is part of his character. Did not Barry Morse once say that he wished for there to be more quirky individuality in the characters? Okay. So, Reilly could be something of an arrogant jerk. Some people are like that. And his attraction to Maya and his seeing of Tony as a rival, fuels his tending toward being less than sympathetic as a character. He is an antagonist, and Koenig \"puts him in his place\". That and his revulsion at discovering what Maya thinks of him. He has some redemption by the end of the episode, becoming a less immodest character. He also seems to accept that Tony and Maya belong together and \"backs off\". But enough on this. I have defended \"All That Glisters\" much, much more cogently elsewhere on this Weblog. Suffice it to say that I am way, way, way, way, way past \"putting up with\" bellicose or smugly comical, derisive commentary on Season 2. I would rather sit in total silence and count the cracks on the wall of my now forty-five-year-old house, than subject myself to listening to, or reading, such commentary.\n\nAll for today.\n\nChristmas Eve, Saturday, December 24, 2022. Forty-five years ago, on a Christmas Eve also on a Saturday, I bought a Space: 1999 Moonbuggy toy, at Sobeys, of all places. I was also at my grandparents' place for dinner and a most unusual (for our family) Christmas Eve opening of gifts. And I also brought my audiocassette apparatus with me to capture the sounds of the CBC and CHSJ broadcast of Space: 1999- \"The Infernal Machine\", in which most of the advertisement intervals were stuffed by CHSJ with Christmas greetings from various businesses. Happily, CHSJ did not truncate the episode in any way with an excess of commercials.\n\nMy Doctor Who Season 2 Blu-Ray box set arrived ten days ago, and I have been watching the Blu-Ray discs in that, in what time to myself apart from Website work, that I have had in the past ten rotations of our planet Earth. For upscalings of film recordings of black-and-white television video material of the early-to-mid-1960s, the serials look as good as can be expected, I suppose. No news next on what is coming next on the Doctor Who Blu-Ray schedule. Seasons 9, 20, and 6 are being rumoured. 2023 being the sixtieth anniversary of Doctor Who, I would have hoped to see a fourth set, to compensate for the mere two sets that were released this year.\n\nIn a surprise move, Network Distributing has released a fiftieth anniversary Blu-Ray set of The Adventures of Black Beauty. An early 1970s television series that I have been watching in recent years on YouTube. It would be interesting to see how a new remaster in High Definition will look. I have a certain amount of time for The Adventures of Black Beauty. For nostalgia, of course, it having been a television offering during my cherished Douglastown years. And also for its Space: 1999 connections. Charles Crichton and Ray Austin, later to be Space: 1999 directors, helmed a sizable number of the Adventures of Black Beauty episodes. And in The Adventures of Black Beauty there were such Space: 1999 actors as Stacy Dorning and Michael Culver, as second season Black Beauty regulars, and Michael Sheard, Maxine Audley, Geoffrey Bayldon, Leigh Lawson, Patrick Westwood, Peter Bowles, and Stuart Damon, as guest stars. Actors from Doctor Who are even more replete. And the visuals of the English countryside, are gorgeous, as is the music. I have purchased a set and would encourage others to do same. Hopefully if vintage television continues to be lucrative for Network, we might see in 2023 a box set of Return of the Saint, it, too, sporting quite an impressive series of Space: 1999 associations. And being quite appealing as escapist, stylish, action-adventure entertainment.\n\nIt will this year be another traditional Kevin McCorry Christmas post-my-father's-passing. A turkey dinner and a quiet day at home watching Blu-Rays and DVDs.\n\nFinal day of the Year of Our Lord 2022.\n\nFront cover to the Network Distributing Blu-Ray set of the early 1970s television series, The Adventures of Black Beauty, released in December, 2022. And which I purchased in same month.\n\nI now have the Adventures of Black Beauty Blu-Ray set and have watched numerous episodes.\n\nSadly, the restoration for High Definition is not to Network Distributing's usual high standard. Detail is lacking, as is contrast. Colours are faded. The picture has a \"washed-out\", soft, even blurry look in places, especially in some of the end credits, and blacks are not inky. There is also juddery movement at times, suggesting that I am watching High Definition up-conversions of PAL masters. I am not informed as to the particulars of this particular release. It could be that the original camera negatives of the fifty-two episodes no longer exist, and that all that are extant are 16-millimetre film prints that have seen better days. Perhaps only transfers of them to PAL video. Network may have done some digital clean-up of old PAL video masters (those originally made for DVD from 16-millimetre prints), and this was all that could be done. It is disappointing, to be sure. The first season episodes look better than those of the second. Perhaps different film stock was used for the two seasons, that of the second season being of an inferior quality.\n\nUnlike most other Network Blu-Rays, this set is multi-region. A, B, and C. So, if anyone wants the set and does not have multi-region playback, he or she should be able to purchase it with confidence. Based at least on what the Blu-Ray discs all say. Zones A, B, and C.\n\nThere are bonus features. Talking-head interviews, and accompanying clips from episodes, with actress Judi Bowker, actor Stephen Garlick, and some of the production crew. Many entertaining anecdotes about the making of the television series. Alas, neither Stacy Dorning nor Michael Culver participated in the value-added content. And all of the other regular cast members are, sadly, deceased. Amongst them child actors Roderick Shaw and Tony Maiden. Photograph galleries, including one dedicated to merchandise, are very good value. I was not aware that there were Black Beauty paperbacks, Annuals, View-Master packets, and 8-millimetre films.\n\nAll for today.\n\nJanuary 1, 2023.\n\n\"The Trouble With Tribbles\", an episode of Star Trek that is highly acclaimed and popular amongst aficionados of the created-by-Gene Roddenberry space opus. I have never been a fan of it, however.\n\nI am going to begin 2023 by criticising the Star Trek episode, \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". Arguably (for me, at least) one of the more overrated episodes of the original Star Trek television series. I cannot say that I have ever been a fan of it, though for some reason I had an inclination to watch it a few nights ago. It actually has a Blu-Ray disc all to itself and some of its \"spin-offs\" in later works of Star Trek. How wildly extravagant is that?\n\n\"The Trouble With Tribbles\", together with \"I, Mudd\" (which was made immediately before it), is, in my view, the closest that Star Trek ever came to being a situation comedy. Season 2 Star Trek did have a tendency to veer into comedy for its epilogues and some mid-episode conversations, but at least the stakes in those episodes tended to be greater than what is to be found in the premise of \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". In \"The Trouble With Tribbles\", we are expected to be concerned about the developing of one Sherman's Planet (or, as it is often jokingly called, \"Sherman and Peabody's Planet\"; funny!!!). A planet that we never see and only hear about in reference. A planet that is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingons. Big deal! Just find another planet. In \"By Any Other Name\", Kirk says that there is a multitude of worlds in the Milky Way galaxy that are suitable for colonisation.\n\nWilliam Schallert, in his trademark \"sitcom\"-esque hyper-fastidiousness, is pressing Kirk to \"take seriously\" the matter of Sherman's Planet and shipments of grain to it. And Kirk has antagonism played rather light-heartedly with two Klingons, Koloth and Korax, the former portrayed by the same actor who was Trelaine in \"The Squire of Gothos\", and with scarcely much difference betwen his two roles in effusive acting performance. The Klingons in this episode could not be more comedically \"arch\" if they twirled moustaches. And they exit at the end of the episode as though they had defecated in their pants. After the Klingon gambit in the episode had been exposed, exposed almost Scooby-Doo-like, some two years before Scooby-Doo was even a thing.\n\nThe episode's prologue consists of little more than expository dialogue betwen Kirk, Spock, and Chekov in the Briefing Room, in which Chekov comes across as nothing more than a buffoon who thinks Russians to have been responsible for every great discovery and invention. And we later learn that he believes Vodka to be superior to all other alcoholic beverages. Okay. I can accept a bit of character quirkiness. But what I am noting here is something of a departure from Chekov's usual dependability in the delivery of accurate information.\n\nTwo episodic acts end on a comedic note. The second act comes to an end with a barroom brawl. A barroom brawl in Star Trek? Okay. Whatever. Human frailty still exists in the twenty-third century, as was established in Season 1. But the brawl itself is played for laughs, as, too, is its aftermath with Kirk questioning Scotty. And as it is in progress, the focus is on the comedic Cyrano Jones being silly as he downs drinks while avoiding the fracas as much as possible, with accompanying music denoting silliness and \"twee-ness\" as the act all too slowly comes to an end and the fade to black finally happens. And the third act ends with tons and tons of Tribbles pouring onto a hapless Kirk, as more comedy-expressing music plays.\n\nWhat of the Tribbles themselves? Cute, fuzzy, adorable. As much as can possibly be conveyed without their having a face and a pair of eyes. But from where did Cyrano Jones acquire them? How come they did not multiply out of control on his spaceship before he came to the Space Station? I suppose that he must have very, very recently procured his samples of the furry creatures. Okay. whatever. We have to accept that just as we must accept that Jones was not aware of how rapidly Tribbles do multiply. Even though it should have been very obvious in almost no time at all.\n\nThe main antagonist in the episode is revealed to be the Schallert chartacter's assistant, Darvin, who is a Klingon in human guise, who poisoned the grain intended for Sherman's Planet. The grain is evidently easily replaced, as no one seems to be very protractedly concerned about how the loss of the first grain shipment will impact the development of Sherman's Planet. How is it that Darvin's true Klingon nature was not detected before this point in time? All that McCoy needs to do is to run a medical scanner over him, to determine that he is Klingon. Would not a physical examination have been required before Darvin first boarded a Federation spacecraft? As per standard procedure. How did he acquire and carry the poison? Would it not have been detected on his person, or on the person of his Klingon contacts on the space station? Pretty lax security, considering that Kirk is supposed to be protecting the grain.\n\nBut the most cogent indicator of situation comedy, or of farce, yet, is the epilogue. Scotty says that he transported every Tribble on the Enterprise into the Klingons' engine room where, \"...they'll be no Tribble at all.\" And everyone laughs. It is absurd on its face. Why would Kirk be laughing? What Scotty did was unauthorised. And it could be construed by the Klingons as an intrusive, aggressive act. An act of war, even. And after Kirk expresses revulsion at the possibility that Scotty \"beamed\" the Tribbles into space, what do he and Scotty and the others on the Bridge think the Klingons would do with the Tribbles after finding them in the engine room, multiplying profusely and screeching ear-piercingly? The Klingons would act post-haste to dispose of them, of course. And being that Klingons are ruthless and pitiless, they would have no compunction over killing the Tribbles in the vacuum of space. Scotty condemned them to death as surely as if he himself had \"beamed\" them into the void. Ah, but everyone has a laugh and the episode is concluded. Concluded most absurdly.\n\nAnd this is not all on the absurdity angle. Kirk assigned Cyrano Jones to \"pick up\" every Tribble on the Space Station. \"Pick (them) up\" and put them where? On Jones' spaceship? Surely by the time that he had \"picked up\" every Tribble (some seventeen years hence, per Spock's calculation) they would have multiplied to such prolific numbers that even the Space Station could not contain them, to say nothing about the smaller capacity of Jones' spaceship. Ridiculous. Absolutely, patently ridiculous.\n\nDavid Gerrold became the science fiction \"guru\" that he is based on this one episode of Star Trek that is demonstrably not unassailable. Mr. Gerrold famously bristled at Fred Freiberger having had the temerity to opine that Star Trek should not be a comedy, and that \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" was too comedic for his taste. Indeed, \"Spock's Brain\" aside, third season Star Trek, under Freiberger, made a conscious effort to steer itself toward serious renderings of science fiction/fantasy, with a minimum or no trace at all, of funniness. \"Spock's Brain\" was a Gene Coon-penned left-over script of Season 2, and Freiberger did declare the episode that came of it to be a misfire. Farce was avoided in all other third season episodes. Even the \"space hippies\" episode was serious in tone, and sad in its ending. There was in Season 3 the occasional smidgen of humour between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy stemming out of their interesting dynamic as a threesome. \"The Tholian Web\" had some of that in its epilogue. Likewise \"The Lights of Zetar\". But most episodes ended on a serious, wistful, sometimes even grim, note. Third season Star Trek \"played it straight\", as first season mostly did.\n\nDavid Gerrold did some superlative work, to be sure. His Logan's Run episode, \"Man Out of Time\", is excellent. Though his arrogance when he was writing for Starlog was irksome, to say the least. I was quite aware of his negative assessment of Space: 1999. I think that his vitriol toward Fred Freiberger was wrong, as, too, was his disdain for Season 3 Star Trek. He could, however, occasionally say things that had merit. I would never say so back in the day, but now I do acknowledge that he was sometimes \"on point\", most particularly in his observations on the nature of science fiction/fantasy fandom. Several of his criticisms of The Empire Strikes Back were \"bang on the money\". But all of this aside, the work that won him his fame, is, in my estimation, far short of being the ne plus ultra of the Star Trek canon. Though I am sure there is no shortage of people who will declare Space: 1999 to be execrable drivel while holding \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" highly above their heads as the pinnacle of scripts for the most praiseworthy opus of imagination ever lensed by the U.S. and British entertainment industries. They will not respect my appreciation for Space: 1999, and I do not feel at all compelled to kowtow to them and their often-sung favourites. And in the immortal words of Mr. Cronkite, that is the way that it is.\n\nAs I have said before, there are faults in everything if one is searching for them. People are imperfect. Yet Space: 1999 and most especially its second season are not granted the same allowance to be imperfect as countless other works of science fiction/fantasy are. And not given licence for \"economy of detail\" while other works receive a \"free pass\". While this injustice persists, I shall continue to call attention to imperfections in highly esteemed productions.\n\nOh, and by the way, the comedy of \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" has fellowship not only with \"I, Mudd\", but also with \"A Piece of the Action\". Another Season 2 Star Trek episode. Though the resolution of that episode may not be quite so ridiculous.\n\nBecause I have self-awareness and always have an internal dialogue, I can anticipate criticism, or \"comebacks\" from people having umbrage with my preferences in imaginative entertainment.\n\nMy rather biting review of \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" probably had some people saying, \"Well, what about 'Year 2' of Space: 1999? What about 'The Taybor'? Huh? Hmmm? It has a Cyrano Jones-like trader character. Some people consider it to be something of a 'romp'. What about that, Kevin, you hypocrite, you?\"\n\nFirst of all, I do not deny that \"economy of detail\" might be used to defuse some of my issues with \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". Darvin might have been able to bribe his way onto a Federation spaceship without the requisite medical examination. He might also have been a skilled enough chemist to synthesise his own poison for the grain without needing to carry the poison on his person until it was time to administer it. He might then have been able to somehow avoid observation by Security of his nefarious activity has he is \"carrying out\" that activity in the storage compartments. Kirk might have arranged a gigantic space freighter for the Tribbles being \"picked up\" by Jones. Of course, one has to overlook the fact that the Federation convieniently has life-form-scanning and matter transportation technologies and that every Tribble on the space station could easily be detected by scanners and promptly transported off of the space station and into a hold on the freighter, making Jones' task of \"picking up\" every Tribble quote unnecessary. This being the case, seventeen-some years of labour by Jones might be more than a tad excessive. Or maybe not. Depends, I guess, on a person's point of view. But \"economy of detail\", if it is to be used for one opus, must in all fairness be used for another. If Space: 1999's second season is not allowed it, than neither should \"The Trouble With Tribbles\". Or, if one is allowed it, then so should the other. Mind, it still does not mitigate the absurdity of Scotty's solution to the Tribble trouble on the Enterprise and Kirk's reaction to it.\n\nBut what of \"The Taybor\"? First of all, Taybor is a trader like Jones. And he is fat, gluttonous. Definitely a lover of drink. Like Jones. But he is devious, calculating, and cunning, determined to have what he wants by fair means or foul, whereas all that Jones is, is a swaggering peddler who lacks the motivation to do research on the commodities that he carries and is only criminal by negligence. Not by ill intent. There are similarities. There are differences. I think that this is fair to say. And yes, \"The Taybor\" does have a scene of the trader drinking, to humourous effect. Even becoming drunk, belching, and \"passing out\". It is a nod to humour, to be sure. But as the scene of this does reinforce the symbolism of Tony's beer and therefore serves an artistic purpose, I propose to grant to it a pass. And besides, the episode thereafter returns to being \"played straight\" and stays on that course. Until the convivial spirit of the epilogue, which contains a valuable lesson for Alpha and is not merely a witty wordsmithing based on a patently absurd, unauthorised action, with a laugh all around. The stakes of the episode through the bulk of it are quite clearly germane to the television-series-encompassing predicament of our heroes. The jump drive is the McGuffin that makes Koenig eager to deal with Taybor. At stake is Koenig's wish to secure for his people long-term survival somewhere. Quite serious, that. We have a moment of dejection when Taybor is unable to pinpoint Earth's location based on Alpha's available information, an instance of solemnness at Taybor's comment about the universe being a lonely place to wander in, and a scene of sadness as Maya faces again the fact that her home world of Psychon is gone. The first act ends with Koenig evidently being abducted into Hyperspace by Taybor. Played dead serious by everyone in Command Centre as they see Taybor's spaceship vanish from the Lunar surface. Act 2 ends with Taybor revealing to Koenig what, or, rather, who, he wants in trade for the jump drive, as we see Koenig looking perplexed, revolted, and aggrieved. Definitely not a comedic moment. And Act 3 finishes with Taybor hypnotising Maya and teleporting her and him out of Alpha, evidently intending to bid adieu to Alpha with Maya with him in his spaceship, and, with Hyperspace inaccessible by Alpha's Eagles, he and Maya will be out of the Alphans' reach. Another quite serious ending to an act.\n\nMaya is able to defeat Taybor through trickery, through some dishonesty (she is unable to \"lock\" herself in a form as she claims to do) as desperate times do sometimes call for desperate measures. She \"takes advantage\" of Taybor's fixation on beauty and his corresponding revulsion at ugliness. Taybor returns Maya to Alpha and repossesses the jump drive master diagram and all of the wares that he had bestowed upon Alpha in gift or in barter. Koenig observes that Taybor is a \"sore loser\", Tony describes Taybor as nothing more than a \"con man\", and Helena states that it is prudent to beware traders bearing gifts. Maya and Tony share some of their good-natured \"ribbing\" as a challenge to their future together as a romantic couple has been overcome. The ending is effective, rational. It is upbeat, effusive even, but not going for the \"sitcom\" group laugh over a play on words and an absurdity, as the ending of \"The Trouble With Tribbles\" chooses to do.\n\nYes, I know. It is not clear how the Limpet Transmitter attached by Koenig to Taybor's spaceship allows Alpha contact with Taybor's spaceship in Hyperspace. \"Economy of detail\" is needed here. Technical may have been able to determine the transmission frequency used for Taybor's spaceship to have communication with Alpha from Hyperspace and program that into the Limpet Transmitter. I can \"buy that\". Besides, I am not sure that it was essential for story resolution for Koenig to talk to Maya through the transmitter. Maya would eventually come to her own conclusion about what she needed to do to thwart Taybor and have him return her to Alpha.\n\nAs to the duplicate Maya. How is Alpha able to provide that? Well, it is just a computerised, talking mannequin. Or as Tony calls it, \"A waxworks dummy with a computer voice.\" Surely something like that could be possible in 1999 as that year was envisaged in 1976. Maybe with some help by Maya with her Psychon technical knowledge.\n\n\"The Taybor\" is not even a favourite episode of mine, but I am very fond of it, nevertheless. It provides some commercial flavour to the stunning aesthetic of Space: 1999 universe, and a fair bit of otherworldly pizzazz in Taybor's merchandise and his beautiful spaceship. I will go for that any day over a Tribble, Mr. Jones. McCorry, out. Wednesday, January 4, 2023.\n\nAnother year older. Another year greyer. Another year wrinklier.\n\nMy fifty-seventh birthday was Thursday. I am now three years away from being a sixty-year-old. And when I look in the mirror I definitely see my father. As he looked in the mid-1980s when his health started to deteriorate.\n\nI am not a young man anymore. Due to stresses and anxieties of the past three years, I am now looking my age. I used to look younger than my years. Always did until this decade began.\n\nA caveat that I must provide after watching the Adventures of Black Beauty Blu-Rays. I tried watching them on a Region A player. They would not play. No \"region code error\" message. Nothing. I suspect that there is PAL content on the Blu-Ray discs that my Region A player rejects, and it therefore rejects the Blu-Ray discs in total. One will therefore still need a Region B or multi-region Blu-Ray player to watch these Blu-Rays. At least where SONY models are concerned. Other makes of player may respond differently to these Blu-Ray discs. I cannot say for sure.\n\nI have in recent days been busily working on improving two cartoon title cards on The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour Page, specifically those for \"Rabbit of Seville\" and \"Rabbit Every Monday\". The labour continues, but the most recent upgrades to those images are now available on said Web page.\n\nSome interesting news on the subject of the Warner Brothers cartoons on home video. Some 2023 product listings have surfaced showing plans for release of a ten-movie Looney Tunes DVD set and something called LOONEY TUNES COLLECTOR'S CHOICE VOLUME 1 on Blu-Ray. Fans of cartoons are speculating on what will comprise these releases. The most likely scenario is that the DVD set will be reissues of DVDs containing The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie, The Looney, Looney, Looney Bugs Bunny Movie, Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island, 1001 Rabbit Tales, Daffy Duck's Quackbusters, the SpaceJam movies, Looney Tunes Back in Action, and some direct-to-home video movies. The only one of these that I would be interested in buying, on Blu-Ray not on DVD, would be Daffy Duck's Quackbusters. As I have Daffy Duck's Quackbusters on DVD, why would I buy it again on the same home video format? And what of this COLLECTOR'S CHOICE thing? What might that be? The most logical inference, given Warner Brothers' tendency to simply repurpose old glass masters, is that COLLECTOR'S CHOICE will just be reissues of THE LOONEY TUNES PLATINUM COLLECTION. The same Blu-Ray discs right down to the menus. I am not going to raise my hopes with expectation of anything else. With the vast majority of the Warner Brothers cartoon library now restored in High Definition, it would be an easy business to produce compilations of never-before-on-Blu-Ray cartoon shorts. But it would be easier still, to just go back to the existing Blu-Ray glass masters. No need to do any work on menus and so forth and pay for new glass masters. And this is what I expect that Warner Brothers has in mind. I would be exceedingly happy to be wrong.\n\nLoath as I am to go back to defending Season 2 Space: 1999 against hate-filled sorties at various places on the Internet, I feel compelled this morning to comment on some particular assailings of Season 2 that are blighting the comment section of Chris Dale's YouTube video, \"Space: 1999's Scariest Moments\".\n\n\"Yeah, I was a big fan of the show and really looked forward to season 2. At first, the changes seemed kinda cool, but, while season 1, though occasionally wonky, kept up a high level of quality throughout, never compromising its vision, Season 2 just seemed like a sensationalistic, steadily downward slide as it progressed, culminating with the final episode about the, haha, 'Dorcons'.\"\n\nWhat gibberish. Fans are so arrogantly confident in the verity of their confounded opinions that they do not bother anymore to furnish substantively articulated examples of what they allege. As to the assertion of this particular indivdual, surely there is no shortage of fans who contend that Season 2 was rotten \"right out of the gate\" with \"The Metamorph\", and that it had no vision to be compromised. \"Steady downward slide\", huh? So, that would mean that \"The Seance Spectre\" is worse than \"Catacombs of the Moon\", that \"Dorzak\" is worse than \"The Mark of Archanon\", and that \"The Dorcons\" is the worst episode of all. What is so laughable about \"The Dorcons\"? Do tell. Of course it does not behoove me to engage in any discussion of anything in Season 2 being worse than something else, or to use pejorative language at all in regards to anything in Season 2. I am just doing so here to show the nonsense in this person's sad excuse for an argument. How is Season 2 any more sensationalistic than Season 1? Quantify it. Give examples. Stop being so Goddamned lazy. Stop assuming that everyone is going to be in agreement and that examples are unnecessary. One could say that focusing on Joan Collins' legs in Season 1's \"Mission of the Darians\" is sensational. Or that Catherine Schell's outfit in Season 1's \"Guardian of Piri\" is sensational. Or that Zienia Merton's Stone Age garment in first season's \"The Full Circle\" and the \"horny\" reactions of the savages to it, is sensational. Or that \"blowing up\" just about everything, \"killing off\" characters, wreaking destruction on a planetary scale, and then doing a reset and restoring everything on some stated-in-dialogue contrivance, done not just once but twice in Season 1, is sensational. Or that explicit gore here and there to \"gross out\" the viewer, is sensational. One could purport that the gore in Star Trek II- The Wrath of Khan is sensational. I could go on all day. Why \"pick on\" Season 2 Space: 1999? Why, indeed. What is it in people's collective subconscious that disposes them to everlastingly \"dish out\" invective targeted at Season 2 Space: 1999?\n\n\"That would be Freddie Frieberger, who also was credited with destroying the original Star Trek. My beef with him is that he also destroyed another favorite show of mine when he became executive producer for the last 2 seasons of The Wild Wild West, trying to twist the seminal Steampunk inspiration into a conventional western.\"\n\nFront cover to the DVD box set of the first season of the 1965-9 television series, The Wild Wild West. Fred Freiberger, who would later produce the final seasons of Star Trek and Space: 1999 and some of the last season of The Six Million Dollar Man, was producer of the first season of The Wild Wild West, including its most inceptive episodes. People routinely ignore the presence of Season 1 of The Wild Wild West on the Curriculum Vitae of Mr. Fred Freiberger, in their haste to slander or libel him as \"killer\" of every television show upon which he laid his hands.\n\nOh, good bloody grief! For the last \"frigging\" time. Fred Freiberger was producer of Season 1 of The Wild Wild West and not Seasons 2, 3, or 4. He did not destroy The Wild Wild West. He produced some of the most inceptive episodes; he did not destroy it. Saying that he did destroy it, saying so without bothering to do the most basic of research on the topic, is inexcusable. How, pray tell, could Fred Freiberger have produced the final season of The Wild Wild West in 1968-9 at the same time as he was producing Season 3 of Star Trek? Ridiculous! And does anyone in the discussion bother to correct this person. Of course not. If it slanders \"old Freddie\", it is perfectly acceptable- even if it is patently false. Do not tell me. Let me guess. This person's truth is not my truth. He experienced things differently, is all. His point of view is as valid as mine. No, more so. Because his has majority backing. Oh, yes. Of course. I am in the minority; therefore, my opinion does not count. Of course, of course, or course. I am being sarcastic here, if anyone does not already know that.\n\nAnd the statement of Mr. Freiberger destroying Star Trek is at best hyperbolic, if not outright false. I would say the latter. NBC disliked Star Trek and Gene Roddenberry intensely and wanted Star Trek \"canned\". The television network cancelled Star Trek after its second season and relented under pressure from Bjo Trimble's letter campaign and granted a reprieve to Kirk and company, only to put the television show in a horrible airtime guaranteeing that ratings would be low enough for another letter campaign to have zero credibility in arguing for a continuation of the missions of the Enterprise. Star Trek was condemned by NBC, not by alleged deficient quality in a majority of the third season episodes. I would argue that the majority of Star Trek's third season's episodes were imaginative, entertaining, and true to the Star Trek concept. Examples? \"Spectre of the Gun\", \"Elaan of Troyius\", \"The Paradise Syndrome\", \"The Enterprise Incident\", \"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\", \"The Tholian Web\", \"For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky\", \"Day of the Dove\", \"Wink of an Eye\", \"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield\", \"The Mark of Gideon\", \"Requiem For Methuselah\", \"All Our Yesterdays\". These are some of the more accepted ones in some circles. I would contend the same for numerous others. Oh, some story technicalities may be questioned, but as I am fond of saying, this is common to just about everything, if one is willing to cast an equally critical eye over other works.\n\n\"Season 2 was so bad that Martin Landau was incapacitated out of it.. or not in a lot of it... and people think the Sybil Danning intros were cheesy? Well, especially with the insipid silicon rock episode that made up things as it goes along, and even worse than the worst science fiction made today (not that it takes much)... horrid episode but still influenced other shows made slightly later that used s"
