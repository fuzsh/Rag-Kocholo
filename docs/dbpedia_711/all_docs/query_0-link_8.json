        "text": "In the film production industry women are underrepresented in almost all production areas around the globe. Numbers show that female directors are similarly marginalized in Europe (films directed by women reached 19% in 2017 1) and in the United states (14% of the directors that worked in the 500 top movies of 2019 were women 2). This shortage of women in audiovisual production occurs not only in large industries, but also in the most emerging ones, remote places like Chile have numbers as low as only 5.7% of women directed films between 2011-2016 3. The marginalization of women in creative production spaces is not a new and it has had social consequences that affect the perception of women in their societies, perpetuating stereotypes and restricting the creative diversity that would be undeniably beneficial to the film and audiovisual industry worldwide. From this statement, I ask the following questions: Why do women occupy such a limited space in industries such as film? What would be the impact on society if more female voices were made known and recognized in the same way as their male counterparts? If we review the history of cinema, women have been part of its evolution from the very beginning. Unfortunately, there is not much information about their participation in general, but especially after the first two decades of its existence. It is as if they were never written into history, but they were there. Prejudices, responsibilities, social and cultural pressures could be attributed to this absence in books and classrooms. It was probably a process of segregation that relegated them to the limited and caring space in which they remain majority to this day (this happened not only in the cinema, but in many other male dominated work environments ).\n\nCourse Description: Throughout this semester, we will examine the development of the film industry from its inception until the 1950s. Our focus will primarily be on American cinema, but we will discuss important foreign works that had great influence on the industry as a whole. Scholars approach film history from a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives such as economics, aesthetics, cultural theory, audience studies, production studies, technology, and many others. Our readings, assignments and discussions will touch on these various ways to explore film as we learn about the trajectory of the film industry and its vast influence on other media as well as our culture. We will consider how films serve as historical artifacts that inform and enlighten us about the socioeconomic and cultural along with important national and world events. In this class, you will be required to critically examine complex issues in writing and will further develop your research an analytical skills as media scholars. Assignments will test your knowledge and challenge you to put the course concepts into practice as you develop your own theories about films and how the film industry works.\n\nThe second volume in the series Bloomsbury Research Skills for History, Histories on Screen provides general readers access to concepts, historiography, and debates on the history of film and television. Focusing mostly on popular British films and including a few pieces that also engage debates on American cinema and British television, the book can help undergraduate students enter the burgeoning field of film history without the challenges of intensive jargon and advanced historical theory. Edited by Michael Dolski, Sam Edwards, and Faye Sayer, the volume involves discussions on historiographical contributions regarding film studies from Robert Rosenstone, Jeffrey Richards, and Michael Paris and the modern theories of New Film History often derived from the works of James Chapman, Thomas Doherty, Mark Glancey, and Mark Connelly. These deliberations enlighten individual chapters without overburdening the introductory reader with the complexities implicit within much media theory from scholars like Hayden White, Fredric Jameson, and Noam Chomsky.\n\nThis essay reflects on the pedagogical value of integrating nontheatrical and useful cinemas into a standard film history survey course. It takes as its example my experiences teaching a one-semester survey titled, “International Cinema to 1960,” at a university in the United States. The essay suggests how looking beyond the narrative feature reorients film history in several ways: first, by highlighting alternative film production practices (such as government- and corporate sponsored nonfiction); second, by offering generative context for specific national film movements (such as the Golden Age of Mexican cinema and Italian Neorealism); and third, as a lens to contend with the history of European imperialism and the colonial gaze (i.e., travelogues, colonial film units). It argues that putting nontheatrical and useful cinemas in conversation with classic survey content offers a more dynamic history of cinema and becomes a vehicle for organically sparking important conversations about the Eurocentric, racial, and gendered limitations of the film canon—especially prior to 1960. Integrating nontheatrical cinemas creates a survey that actual surveys the scope of film history."
