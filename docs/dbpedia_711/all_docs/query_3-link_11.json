        "text": "The classic Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies theatrical shorts have given birth to some of the most recognizable and popular animated characters of all time, including such favorites as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Tweety Bird, Porky Pig and Sylvester. However, these characters weren't to appear for a number of years after the release of the first Looney Tunes cartoons in 1930.\n\nThe Looney Tunes shorts began as a vehicle to promote Warner Brothers vast music library. Each release highlighted one or more of the songs they owned. The first cartoons featured Bosko, a character similar to Mickey Mouse from the Disney studio, but without the ears. In fact, for the first couple of years Looney Tunes closely resembled the Disney style in both storytelling and animation. This is no great surprise, given that work on the cartoons was done by ex-Disney animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising.\n\nIn 1931, Warner Bros. commissioned a second series - Merrie Melodies - which fell under the same basic format as Looney Tunes. The Merrie Melodies line differed in that it used one-shot or lesser know characters for its stories rather that relying on a single character as its major star. The other difference was that from 1934 to 1943 Merrie Melodies was produced in color and Looney Tunes in black and white. Both series were produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions until 1944, when Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros.\n\nHarmon and Ising left for MGM in 1933, and with the influx of new talent that replaced them the Warner cartoons soon broke from the Disney style. Names that would become synonymous with the Looney Tunes era began their journey towards animation immortality. Bob Clampett and Isadore \"Friz\" Freleng were two animators who were promoted to director, and in 1935 Tex Avery and Chuck Jones joined the team. Chuck Jones began as an animator, but was directing by 1938.\n\nPorky Pig was the studio's first major cartoon star. His first appearance was in the 1935 short \"I Haven't Got a Hat.\" Other major characters making their first appearance were Daffy Duck in \"Porky's Duck Hunt\" (1937); Elmer Fudd in \"Egghead Rides Again\" (1937) (Elmer was called Egghead in his first few appearances); Bugs Bunny in \"Porky's Hare Hunt\" (1938) (Bugs was as yet unnamed and only loosely resembled his later character); Sylvester in \"The Hep Cat\" (1941) (the character was as yet unnamed); Tweety Bird in \"A Tale of Two Kitties\" (1942); Yosemite Sam in \"Hare Trigger\" (1945); Pep√© Le Pew in \"Odor-able Kitty\" (1945); Foghorn Leghorn in \"Walky Talky Hawky\" (1946); Marvin the Martian in \"Haredevil Hare\" (1948); Claude Cat in \"Mouse Wreckers\" (1948); Hippety Hopper in \"Hop, Look and Listen\" (1948); Road Runner in \"Fast and Furry-ous\" (1949); Wile E. Coyote in \"Fast and Furry-ous\" (1949); Speedy Gonzales in \"Cat-Tails for Two\" (1953); and the Tasmanian Devil in \"Devil May Hare\" (1954).\n\nAfter 1943, both Merrie Melodies and Looney Tunes were produced in color. By that time the star characters were also appearing in both series, and the only real difference between the two were their titles and theme music. In the years since, both titles have collectively come to be known and referred to as Looney Tunes.\n\nBy 1964, the era of theatrical shorts was coming to a close, and Warner Bros. made the decision to shut down its animation studio. They did, however, commission DePatie-Freleng to continue producing the cartoons until 1969. The DePatie-Freleng cartoons are easily identified because they used a different opening sequence and theme music than those that had been produced by the Warner studio.\n\nThe cartoons and the characters lived on past 1969, gaining their greatest exposure when they began airing on television. Pre-1948 Warner Bros. cartoons first aired in the mid-to-late 1950s by means of direct distribution to individual stations. In the fall of 1960, The Bugs Bunny Show debuted in prime time on ABC network television. The half-hour program was a compilation of post-1948 Warner shorts with newly animated wraparounds featuring host Bugs Bunny. It lasted only one season in prime time before it was moved to Saturday mornings, but there the cartoons found a home for four decades, packaged in similar compilation programs under a variety of different titles. The major compilation series to show Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts were:\n\nThe Bugs Bunny Show - 30 minutes - (1960 - 1968, ABC)_(1971 - 1973, CBS)_(1973 - 1975, ABC)\n\nThe Porky Pig Show - 30 minutes - (1964 - 1967, ABC)\n\nThe Road Runner Show - 30 minutes - (1966 - 1968, CBS)\n\nThe Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour - 60 minutes - (1968 - 1971, 1975 - 1978, CBS)\n\nPorky Pig and His Friends - 30 minutes - (1971, syndicated)\n\nThe Sylvester & Tweety Show - 30 minutes - (1976 - 1977, CBS)\n\nThe Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show - 90 or 120 minutes - (1978 - 1985, CBS)\n\nThe Daffy Duck Show - 30 minutes - (1978 - 1981, NBC)\n\nThe Sylvester & Tweety, Daffy & Speedy Show - 30 minutes - (1981 - 1982, CBS)\n\nThe Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes Comedy Hour - 60 minutes - (1985 - 1986, ABC)\n\nThe Bugs Bunny & Tweety Show - 60 or 90 minutes - (1986 - 2000, ABC)\n\nLooney Tunes on Nickelodeon - 30 minutes - (1988 - 1999, Nickelodeon)\n\nMerrie Melodies: Starring Bugs Bunny and Friends - 30 minutes - (1990 - 1992, syndicated)\n\nThat's Warner Bros.! - 30 minutes - (1995 - 1996, WB)\n\nThe Bugs n' Daffy Show - 30 minutes - (1996 - 1999, WB)\n\nThe Daffy Duck Show - 30 minutes - (1997, WB)\n\nIn 2000, Warner Bros. made the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies film library exclusive to the Cartoon Network, and the cartoons ceased to be a staple of regular network television programming."
