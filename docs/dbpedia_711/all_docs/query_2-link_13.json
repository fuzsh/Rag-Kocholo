        "text": "391. Case of the Missing Hare (1942)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 390.\n\nRelease date: December 12, 1942.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Chuck Jones.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny / Ala\n\nBahma).\n\nStory: Ted Pierce.\n\nAnimation: Ken Harris.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown.\n\nSynopsis: Bugs Bunny vows revenge on magician Ala Bahma for invading his property by nailing show posters on his home.\n\nOne of the niceties of John McGrew's layout work is that he doesn't restrict himself to a certain style. In each Chuck Jones cartoon he's always experimenting new boundaries; whether certain styles work together or not - like trial and error. In this cartoon, he takes a completely different approach to the point where he has as little background as possible.\n\nAnimation by Ben Washam\n\nThe opening sequence is the only piece in the short which requires a little detail - like the multiple posters and the background scenery surrounding Bugs' home. Gene Fleury restraints the colour choices to three: yellow for the sky, pink for the soil, and blue for the shrubs and leaves; with different subtle shades for each colour evidently.\n\nThe interior shots of the stage however, limits the background work as much as possible - ranging from blank or crossover colours which vary from shot to shot. Only the hat on a prop table gives any indication that the scenery is on stage. Fleury has an excellent taste of color styling for certain shots where he wisely chooses particular colours for particular sequences to match the right atmosphere - without looking ugly and unfitting.\n\nFor the majority of Bugs' cartoons - he was typically portrayed as a menace who took pleasure at bullying his vulnerable opponents. Ted Pierce on the other hand, takes the formula to a different dimension.\n\nThe opening status quo establishes the first of a handful of Bugs Bunny cartoons where he vows revenge on the antagonist. As seen in the opening scene, magician Ala Bahma (pretty lame pun on the Southern state) is busy nailing show posters of his upcoming theatrical posters - and nails them at every nook and cranny, including Bugs' home.\n\nAlthough an uncanny choice to feature Bugs' home in a tree; he responds angrily to the magician's vandalism on his own property: \"Look doc, do I go round nailing signs over your house? Do I? There's still such a thing as private property, y'know!\"\n\nNot listening to Bugs, Ala Bahma entices him to a blackberry pie and tricks him with the commonplace pie-in-the-face act. Only Blanc could make the dialect sound hilarious at the delivery of: \"What a dumb boonie!\". Reacting to the pie-face, Bugs utters the infamous words: \"Of course you realize, this means war!\". This wasn't the first time Bugs said the memorable Groucho Marx quote as it traces back to the first proto-Bugs short, Porky's Hare Hunt. However, it has never been uttered to carry out an entire cartoon - giving Bugs a motive to get even with the magician.\n\nThe obstacle starts once the scenario changes to Ala Bahma starting his performance inside a theater. Starting with the old rabbit in hat trick , Bugs immediately sabotages the act by replacing his ears with a carrot which he unveils - much to the audience's laughter.\n\nThen, Bugs crawls up the magician's sleeve and slides his head up to his neck collar. So, he glares right at his face, indicating a threat and breathing heavily with anger - while the magician reacts with slight embarrassment to his presence.\n\nThe line \"Ya didn't expect to see me again, eh svengali?\" which itself is a witty insult toward Ala Bahma. 'Svengali' meaning a person who deliberately controls and manipulates a person, like an actor - which itself is a metaphor on Bugs' career.\n\nIn what seems like a an act of threat - Bugs manipulates Ala Bahma into believing he will assist him with his acts. His revenge starts when he sabotages the rabbit trick again - diverting the attention from the magician to himself. He does so by performing the trick himself without any assistance whatsoever - creating an applause from the audience.\n\nBobe Cannon's masterful animation is put into great use when Bugs' bow to the audience and Ala Bahma paces quicker with an emphasis of smear animation. Reacting angrily to his sabotage; the magician attempts to grab Bugs and rid of him, but to no avail. In a hilarious Bugs Bunny characterization - he responds to that he kissing him on the lips and tying his mustache into a knot.\n\nFrustrated at Bugs' upstaging - Ala Bahma is determined to get him out of the hat. Bugs places a sign on top of him, reading \"Why not tempt me with a carrot?\". In the following scene, the magician becomes completely distracted from his trick act, as he plants a carrot on the hat while hiding a mallet behind - sadistically intending to strike him.\n\nA number of times the gag of Bugs locating the carrot of his fingers has been featured - and this time Chuck attempts to refresh the gag by making it surreal but believable. This feat is left to the animator whose job is to give Bugs' hand the mannerisms of a dog with the middle finger tracking the scent.\n\nBluffing, Bugs unexpectedly grabs the mallet off Ala Bahma and strikes him with it - creating a remarkable effect. To give the smash more attention and prominence; the background shaped colours (yellow-and-blue) immediately reverse. Chuck couldn't go wrong when making an anticipation look comical and artistic together.\n\nWith Bugs Bunny nailed and trapped inside the rabbit hat - Ala Bahma can proceed with his performance without further ado - the basket trick act. Little does he realize that that Bugs Bunny is disguised as a little boy when the magician calls out for volunteers.\n\nThe sequence is an excellent showcase in ridiculing Ala Bahma at the expense of damaging his reputation and career - fooling the off screen audience that he enjoys murdering innocent children.\n\nAs he starts the basket trick act, he forces the knife inside the basket trick - with an unseen Bugs making gagging, agonizing noises. Chuck Jones' master use of expressions and posing on the magician reacting to the gagging noises is priceless; and yet very human. The poses alone speak for themselves. It's a top-rate piece of personality animation which captures the intensity and anxiety of Ala Bahma perfectly.\n\nIn what looks like a suspenseful, doomed moment for Bugs - the camera pans to the rabbit who is standing at the right corner of the stage making the noise. This builds up the rising action as Bugs can't escape inside the sealed magician's hat - calling for further strategies.\n\nThe magician has been humiliated to the point of insanity - where he takes his full drive in murdering Bugs Bunny as he advances towards him. At the climax of Bugs' dilemma - he quickly takes advantage of the situation with more trickery. As a direct parody of a popular school-game, he tricks the magician into playing \"red-light\".\n\nBugs quickens the pace of the game by counting faster - which adds even more intensity to the speed and energy of the magician's anticipation.\n\nChuck's direction and Bobe Cannon's animation work wonderfully to create such effect. Once again, Cannon uses smear animation for Bugs to hit the accent as he shouts \"red-light\". On one occasion Ala Bahma freezes in mid-air - making the scenario even more hilarious.\n\nManipulating him completely - Bugs disguises himself as a fencer as he attempts to participate in the activity. Ala Bahma frantically swings his sword around in a duel - where Jones creates an elaborate, distortion effect of the magician fighting on different levels - to make the duel panicky.\n\nBugs shouts on top of the balcony, \"What a performance!\" and laughing at him to the point where Ala Bahma is fuming red and ready to finish him - by grabbing his shotgun and firing at him.\n\nThe final gag is a great pay-off and vengeance on Bugs' behalf. Engaging him with an explosive cigar, Bugs finally has the last laugh as he smacks him with a pie - echoing an earlier action by Ala Bahma. Bug' innocent pose, mimicking the Mean Widdle Kid features some hilarious posing animated masterfully by Ken Harris. At anticipation he says, \"If I dood it, I'd get a whippin'. I'll dood it!\" - and henceforth striking him.\n\nIt's another decent change at giving Bugs more motive and reason to perform his mischievous antics which otherwise would make him brash and cocky. As a \"This means war\" story, it's an excellent bracer for what lies in store...such as the likes of Bully for Bugs and Hair-Raising Hare. McGrew and Fleury's background work as usual work right down to the frame. Their good judgement in colour styling and innovative ideas of scenery prevent the cartoon from being distracting, allowing the short to flow normally. Chuck keeps his timing and pace to the standard of a hilarious Warner Bros. short while getting away with his use of experimentation.\n\nAs this short wraps up 1942; and even though it has taken me almost forever to get there: the progress made throughout the entire from the Warner crew is extroadinary - especially in Chuck's case. From the start all directors turned out hit-and-miss entires - Clampett was filling in loose ends for unfinished Tex Avery shorts, Friz Freleng was still keeping to the standards of everyone else, and of course, Chuck went from green to professional. By the end of the year, they all proved themselves professional cartoon directors by pushing the boundaries further and further. 1943 should be off to an excellent start...\n\nRating: 4.5/5.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n392. Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (1943)\n\n\"Well, hallelujah!\"\n\nWarner cartoon no. 391.\n\nRelease date: January 16, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Bob Clampett.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Dwarfs, Worm), Leo \"Zoot\" Watson (Prince Chawmin'), Vivian Dandridge (So White), Danny Webb (Queen), Lillian Randolph (Mammy, Honeychil').\n\nStory: Warren Foster.\n\nAnimation: Rod Scribner.\n\nMusical Score: Carl W. Stalling. (Additional scoring by Eddie Beal Trio - uncredited).\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Charming parody on the Grimm brothers fairy-tale; where So White flees from the\n\nWicked Queen and enlists in the U.S. army as a squad\n\ncook.\n\nOne of the most controversial shorts ever made to the point where Bob Clampett refused to screen the film in recent years, at the cost of his own life - as witnessed by Milt Gray. Despite the current age where \"political correctness\" had taken its toll; it still remains one of Clampett's true masterpieces.\n\nIn no way does Clampett intend to discredit or ridicule the African-American race. By all means, he intends to celebrate their culture after being inspired by Duke Ellington's musical revue, Jump for Joy.\n\nHe celebrates their jazz culture and camaraderie spirit to the extent of hiring black performers to contribute to the cartoon to play an integral part. Schlesinger brought them to the studio to consult on story and character development, and not forgetting Eddie Beale and his orchestra to provide additional music for the cartoon's significant climax.\n\nThe only trace of the stereotypes that might be considered unsettling are the character designs themselves and some of the dialect; which was itself an animation cliche of the time. It's intelligible as to why it might offend some viewers - distinctly seen on another principal character: the zoot-suited Prince Chawmin', who wears \"pair o'dice\" on his frontal teeth, and the remainder of his teeth adorned in gold.\n\nMichael Barrier writes it best the 100 Greatest Looney Tunes book, \"Clampett uses those stereotypes so inventively, though, that the cartoon almost transcends them.\" A case of Clampett and Warren Foster inventively portraying the stereotypes is evident in the poisoned apple scene.\n\nIn an iconic part of the tale, the Queen pumps the apple with poison; morphing in a fetid effect. A group of stereotyped worms escape from the rotten worm, complaining it \"smelt like Limburger cheese.\" As they escape, one carries a sign reading \"refoogies\", written in dialect. For a gag behind a creative drive like Clampett or Foster; the stereotypes are surpassed by Clampett's genius timing on the apple effect and Mel Blanc's hysterical delivery on the worms.\n\nWhat makes Coal Black a delightful cartoon is not just the excitement and celebration of the African-American culture; but the wonderful parody of the Grimm brothers fairy tale; which itself hilariously executed - all in a seven-minute cartoon.\n\nSolid character personalities also play an integral part, including the heroine herself, So White. It's an incredible feat for any professional animator to handle a character with realistic human proportions; and animate her with monument energy and edginess all under one roof.\n\nSo White is stereotyped not because of her race, but because of her sexuality; which plays a plot device throughout the short - including how she cheated death, won the heart of the seven dwarfs and how she was revived from her state of unconsciousness.\n\nIt's a hilarious parody directed that fairy tale heroine, Snow White. In the original fairy tale, Snow White was admired for her apparent beauty; including a hired assassin who couldn't find it in his heart to kill her. Clampett takes this sequence by pushing the boundaries. In the sequence where the hired \"Murder, Inc.\" capture So White - her freedom is earned by sexual overtones. The establishing shot features the company van parking discreetly in an isolated woodland. Mike Sasanoff nails the layout to a tee - stipulating that So White has been murdered as they prepare to \"set the body down easy.\" Only Clampett's abrupt pacing could make such a gag work.\n\nFittingly, some shots in the cartoon are a direct ode to the popular Walt Disney feature. In it's original run, Snow White was a smash hit and remarkably influential amongst moviegoers and especially the animation industry. Clampett, who strongly admired the feature, without doubt pays homage to some iconic scenes; but sets the tone and atmosphere very differently.\n\nA striking example occurs in the wishing-well reflection shot, which in both versions symbolise the heroine's dreams of a handsome prince. Like the Disney film, the prince arrives unexpectedly albeit vigilantly. In the Clampett short, the tone and pacing is much more wilder: making Prince Chawmin's presence more boisterous.\n\nSnow White's escape through the spooky forest was remembered for its sharp and scary atmosphere; which reportedly frightened young children in its initial run.\n\nA sequence which indicated Snow White's vulnerable moments; the atmosphere in Coal Black is once again toned down and somewhat rushed. The most revealing reference in the scene are the luminous eyes appearing in the bleak eyes - which momentarily scares So White. The delivery of the owl noises themselves has a hammy effect, that the scene itself succeeds in keeping with the right tone for an animated short.\n\nWithout any intent to accuse Clampett for borrowing visuals - his crew create some really innovative arrangements of mise-en-scene and tackling pieces of staging which is seldom explored. So White and the prince's wild jitterbug is lush with its strong silhouette and innovative art direction which sets the chemistry beautifully.\n\nBob McKimson's animation on the sequence reads beautifully. His posing features a beautiful line of action and read clearly in silhouette. McKimson keeps the arms away from the character's bodies as much as possible to avoid confusion on the posing - showing he has a strong sense of graphic clarity.\n\nOther small shots which are difficult to pull off as far as accents and mechanics goes is the extreme-close up of Prince uttering \"Rosebud\". A direct reference to the infamous \"Rosebud\" quote from Orson Welles' then highly controversial Citizen Kane - it's a feat to pull off the lip-syncing accurately as in that camera angle; it's accurate lip sync that is the prime goal to achieve successful animation.\n\nThe opening and closing shot of the film of a Aunt Jemina-like woman narrating the story to her child by a nicely lit fireplace is lovely abstract visual. It is a beautiful perception of cinematography which is uncanny for a Warner Bros. cartoon to tackle, let alone Clampett's. To keep within the studio's budget constraints, the animation has a graceful use of follow-through action on the \"mammy\".\n\nIn creating hilarious personalities out of the iconic fairy tale villains; Warren Foster succeeds in making a hilarious and sometimes dangerous personality on the Wicked Queen. Instead of the vanity side of the queen in the Grimm story - Foster adapts a different motive for her. She wished to her magic mirror for a \"prince abou' six feet tall!\", only to discover the Prince has the hots for So White instead.\n\nAs indicated by the narrator; \"she was just as rich as she was mean: she had everything!\" which is ironically evil from a different point of view. The pan shot of her treasure collection quickly panned on delivery to reveal she literally had everything - like hoarding car tyres, sugar, coffee, which was heavily rationed during the war. Sweets too, were heavily rationed in the war as she Indulges herself with \"Chattanooga Chew-Chews\", which itself is direct pun on the popular song: Chattanooga Choo Choo.\n\nUpon her discovery of seeing the Prince and So White dancing outside the castle; she reacts angrily: \"The gal, and the Prince! What a sickenin' sight!\". Immediately she dials the phone to hire an organised crime group Murder Inc. to \"Blackout So White!\" where the words visually rise out on delivery - creating a comical and potent effect on the Queen's wrath. If the racial stereotypes are considered offensive - take a gander at the advertisement of the company van.\n\nIf there was a man who could adapt the spirit and excitement of the African-American jazz culture into Clampett's cartoon believably - it's no surprise that Carl Stalling was fit to the task. Although more comfortable with adapting popular music into animated cartoons - Stalling's versatile talent of giving We're in the Army Now a jazz vibe towards it.\n\nThe dwarfs have little personality in the short (excluding the \"Dopey\" persona dwarf), they recruit her in the army as their squad cook as So White is turned on by their uniform in her swing-style voice (\"I'm wacky over khaki now!\").\n\nThe morning bootcamp sequence perfectly captures the enthusiastic jazz spirit; thanks to Stalling and Clampett's collaborations who really have a ball celebrating and worshipping the jazz culture. The sun rise jiving shot adds a real hip vibe to it. So White's cooking scene while singing Five O'Clock Whistle is altogether fitting - and spoilt in animation riches in an elaborate piece of effects of a bacon strip cooking in rhythm to the song's melody.\n\nClampett's innovative imagination and inventive timing all appear at the right moments. One early scene in particular is a Clampett mini masterpiece alone. At the arrival of Prince Chawmin's car - the wheel breaks to a halt - with the wheel rapidly circulating and morphing into five different sneakers, tapping the car to a rhythmic beat.\n\nThe imagination and rhythmic beat alone is a perfect warmup for what lies in store for the cartoon. As far-out and outlandish Clampett's directorial work is on it; some areas feel somewhat clumsy.\n\nBuilding up to the short's suspense; So White has eaten the poisoned apple by the barely disguised 'Durante' Queen. The scenes of So White's collapse has a rather abrupt and strange edit which suggests a continuity clip. I'd nominate the \"buck-buck-bucket\" hen-cackle scene as the funniest piece of dialogue in this short.\n\nThe action scenes of the dwarfs pursuing the Queen follows some of the wildest, frantic pieces of animation in any cartoon. Gags within the sequence are superfluous in a remarkable way where everything moves, indicating panic and order. So many gags are fired altogether like the \"Jeep, Beep, Peep\" gag and the likes of a \"rear end\" gag just as the cannon is loaded - which results in the \"Dopey\" dwarf knocking the Queen out-cold with a mallet.\n\nThe dwarves walk over to So White's dead body - remarking that only Prince Chawmin's \"dynamite kiss\" can revive her. At that moment, the prince arrives at the spot and boasts: \"I'll give 'er a kiss and it don't be a dud, I'll bring 'er to life with ma special: rosebud!\".\n\nThe Prince attempts to revive So White with his kiss, but to no avail. He tries with all his drive and force to the point where he rapidly ages. Praise must go to Eddie Beale, who provided the music for the sequence. Beale's trumpet solo provides the right motivation for the character; and yet maintaining it's jazzy, catchy rhythm. [Correction: It was Leo Watson who played the trumpet solo, while Beale leaded the jazz trio, playing piano and contributing to the score with Milt Frankyln. Thanks to Keith Scott for the information.]\n\nFor the remainder of the cartoon, Rod Scribner takes control on a real tour-de-force of character animation that has yet to be matched. As exaggerated and over-animated it is, the scene is still believable, breathtaking and astounding. The Prince's determination to bring So White to life has incredible monument weight to it - comparable to the great talents like Bill Tytla.\n\nOnce the prince has failed, the \"Dopey\" dwarf takes his chance and lays a kiss on So White where she wakes up so dynamically and broadly she bursts wildly in mid-air. As wild as Scribner could animate on So White's awakening; it's remarkable at how solid his drawing maintained - by drawing the dwarf's head in a difficult angle so believably.\n\nPerplexed, the aged prince asks the dwarf: \"Man, what you got that makes So White think you're so hot!\". The dwarf responds in another hinted sexual overtone: \"Well, dat is a military secret!\" and lays another kiss on So White - causing her pigtails to sail and turn into American flags.\n\nCoal Black has all the elements what every animated cartoon should have: top-notch direction, excellent story, outlandish animation and gags - not forgetting: believable characterisation. This is perhaps the short where Clampett was the most visionary, with an excellent combination of lap lyrics and tropical parody. Now considered taboo for public showing - the short does everything to honour and dedicate the African-American jazz culture. It even strifes for its recognition by hiring African-American performers like Watson and Beale to put their talents to excellent use - making it the masterpiece it always was. As subtle and cheeky Clampett's humour is, his parody on the fairy tale is still in fine taste. Suppressed as it may be, the short remains a beacon for animation scholars and enthusiasts, including Bob Clampett who would move on to many greater shorts.\n\nRating: 5/5.\n\n↧\n\n393. Confusions of a Nutzy Spy (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 392.\n\nRelease date: January 23, 1943.\n\nSeries: Looney Tunes.\n\nSupervision: Norm McCabe.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Porky Pig / Missing Lynx).\n\nStory: Don Christensen.\n\nAnimation: Izzy Ellis.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Constable Porky and his dog, Eggbert, are on the lookout for a German spy: Missing Lynx, who aims to blow up a railway bridge.\n\nAs competent as Norm McCabe might be in presenting stylish backgrounds with some innovative staging - he never seemed to have played an influential role as far as story goes. As often, he was lumbered with cartoons with dated wartime references and heavy propaganda - much like Confusions of a Nutzy Spy (title parodied from the 1939 film - Confessions of a Nazi Spy). Occasionally, he takes the material together and turns them into a near-masterpiece like The Ducktators. As confident and professional McCabe was in giving the right personality for Daffy Duck - Porky seemed an awkward character in the hands of McCabe, much like how Clampett would interpret him in his weakest cartoons.\n\nThe opening pan shot of the interior police station ranges from hit to miss. On the hit side, it is a astonishingly complicated piece of layout of the camera panning back, forth and through the hall of assorted things like various criminal practices and exhibits. Only a strong, experienced layout artist like Dave Hilberman could've designed and coordinated such an ambitious exercise; not forgetting the craftiness of Johnny Burton's camera department.\n\nOn the miss side, the gags on the elaborate opening shot is saddled with unfunny visual puns that Tex Avery himself, even on his bad days, would mock at.\n\nGags like the the finger print department lack any creativity or coherence, as they are literally printed all over the wall; with no impact or pay off whatsoever. Lest not forget exhibit A of a model of the letter \"A\". Ho-hum. Then, there are a few display gags which is more adult oriented. In one gag, the camera pans to a jar displaying a \"sure cure for criminal tendencies\" with a hangman's noose attached to it. As sadistic as the gag implies, it's worth the chortle. The wanted posters exhibit has a cheeky pay-off towards it. The camera panning on generic posters, one-by-one on criminals who are wanted for arson and fraud. Then, the camera pans to a wanted poster of an attractive woman posing in a bathing suit - with a tongue-in cheek message by the U.S. Army.\n\nAreas where McCabe could be visionary with his timing is evident in Eggbert's establishing scene. He is snoozing on a box, with the radio on. As he snores, he breathes \"z's\" literally in and out his mouth - a la comic strips. It's a creative, visual gag combined with graceful timing which is hardly practiced in classic Golden Age animation.\n\nAnimation by Art Davis.\n\nAwakened by the radio; Eggbert slowly reaches his paw to turn off the radio causing the announcer to break forth-wall within the short: \"Don't touch that dial!\", a likely reference to the CBS radio programme, Blondie, based on the comic strip. The paw trigger effect has an effective piece of timing. Afterwards, Eggbert grabs a mallet and smashes the radio.\n\nMcCabe's visionary timing is put into good practice in a fine scene of the \"Nutzy\" spy: Missing Lynx - a lame parody on the description 'missing link'. The lynx, who is voiced hilariously in Mel Blanc's Germanic dialect is discreetly watching Porky and Eggbert's moves.\n\nMcCabe takes advantage on a cliched gag of a cartoon villain peeking in and out of a tree at different direction. As the spy's peeking becomes quicker - he unknowingly splits into another pair - with one and the other at a different position of the tree. The lynx double-takes at the surreal gag and both of them collide; morphing back into one figure. It's a clever piece of reverse animation that coincides with the original - which makes an oddball of a gag work effectively. The double-take and the spontaneity of the second figure makes the gag all the more merrier.\n\nIf there are weak spots as far as characterization goes - look no further than the sequences where the Missing Lynx attempts to fool Porky. While Porky and Eggbert snoop around the woodlands; Eggbert stops at a dead end of a foot blocking way - the Lynx disguised as an elderly dog.\n\nThe sequence itself would've been more passable had the lynx been under disguise the entire time - making Porky's gullibility seem more believable. As Porky inquires, \"Have you seen a spy around here?\". Afterwards, the spy removes his disguises and bluffs, \"Does he look like this\", maintaining a strikingly similar pose as seen in the poster.\n\nOnce Porky nods, in the hope of gaining information - the lynx responds: \"Nope, I have not seen him\" and zips out of the scene - confusing Porky. Just in time we feature a \"Hitler is a stinker\" gag as Eggbert pulls a Hitler mask out the spy's suitcase during investigation - until he discreetly retrieves it.\n\nAs a sequence, it's very clumsy in its own execution and handling on Porky's personality. Being gullible is one thing, but it's incredibly out of character of Porky to fall for a trick when the spy isn't making any effort to disguise himself. For a Bugs Bunny cartoon, the scenario is different in a significant way; but since the personalities in this short are undeveloped: it flaws.\n\nProven the previous sequence was weak in execution - the bridge sequence is hardly better. The spy reaches his destination to plot his terrorist act: a railway bridge. Just as he's about to adjust and plant the bomb; Porky has him cornered at gunpoint.\n\nImmediately, the apparent master of disguises slips into a Porky Pig disguise. He interrogates: \"Vell, I'm-a not so sure that you're Porky Pig either!\" and furthermore mocks his stutter. He moves Porky away from the railway, causing him to ponder: \"I'm really gettin' suspicious of that guy!\"\n\nThis is most likely the weakest spot of the entire cartoon. Porky's personality is incredibly underplayed as he has nothing more to do than feel suspicious and getting interrogated by the spy. It's a completely ridiculous concept at attempting to bluff Porky Pig by disguising as his own self! So many missed opportunities run together.\n\nOn a positive note, the bridge scene has some very choice, dynamic staging as well as some rich point-of-view shots which adds to McCabe's reputation as a stylish director. In Missing Lynx's POV shot, he holds out the bomb from his suitcase; and sets the time on it accordingly. For a description of action so simple; the work on the hands is incredibly rich in detail; with an amazing use of perspective.\n\nAs far as Eggbert's role plays in this short; his role is mainly used for recurring gags and little of personality. The recurring gag is focused on Eggbert's violent sneezing habits which appear frequently. Some of the gags pay off wonderfully. During their investigation in the park, the dog almost experiences an episode - but spontaneously the spy's arm holds his nose whilst hiding in a tree. The unpredictability of the gag alone, is hilarious.\n\nOther areas the sneezing gags build up tension and suspense; such as when Porky and Eggbert find themselves barely dangling from a root attached to the edge of a cliff. It appears story man Don Christensen intended to use the gag as a plot device; which supposedly becomes key to the flaw in Missing Lynx's terrorist plan.\n\nThe recurring gag itself hardly has much pay off at all; as his sneeze only plays a main role when his sneezes forces the spy out from the cave. Not a complete waste of a concept; it could've worked so better as well as a much better payoff which is somewhat lacking for a potential cartoon finale. Once again, another missed opportunity.\n\nAlthough the action sequences might be the usual standards for a Warner Bros. short; some shots have some outlandish. The lynx's double take upon discovering the bomb-in-a-briefcase has been retrieved by Eggbert has some effective use of smear animation which captures the panic episode he is facing.\n\nThe cave sequence is in the style of McCabe's innovative sense of mise-en-scene. Capturing the complete darkness of the cave; only the eyes are seen luminously. A typical style for animated cartoons, McCabe takes the opportunity to plan the action with the panic depicted by their eyes.\n\nBoth characters believing they are safe from the bomb-in-a-briefcase; they take at the sound of a ticking noise. Porky lights the match which reveals Eggbert has followed them, retrieving the briefcase again - Porky shouts \"Yipe!\" creating another panic situation as the characters run frantically around the cave in complete darkness.\n\nDespite moments of weaknesses evident in the short - Christensen finishes the cartoon with a sense of cruel irony. At the cartoon's climax, the cornered Nutzy is quivering scaredly as he awaits the moment for the bomb to detonate. As depicted in a close-up shot, the bomb distinguishes; creating no effect whatsoever.\n\nEnraged, the spy complains: \"I knew it! I knew it! Oh, this goldarn imitation ersatz ding. It never vorks!\". He bangs the bomb to the ground with frustration, when at the wrong moment: it explodes.\n\nA lot about the final shot is depicted with cruel irony. The Nutzy is dancing happily around the clouds of heaven, under the impression his plan had worked after all - and without realizing he is dead. And another thing, it seems very ironic for a terrorist spy to spend eternally in heaven. The cartoon draws to a fade as the spy salutes, \"Sieg Hiel\" and faints onto the clouds.\n\nFor a director who proved capable of turning out some occasionally very good cartoons; this short ranges in the 'hit-and-miss' category. McCabe seemed uncomfortable in giving further character personality on Porky Pig; which Chuck Jones achieved brilliantly in My Favourite Duck. Instead, he is given the persona of a clueless idiot who is gullible and vulnerable, which seems a no brainer to that effect. While this short is war-themed; it surprisingly holds very little wartime references; excluding the Nazi parody and the Hitler mask reference - and instead functions like a generic Porky short. Had McCabe continued to direct after the end of the war, it's almost impossible to determine whether he could've really established himself as \"one of the greats\".\n\nRating: 2.5/5.\n\n↧\n\n394. Pigs in a Polka (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 393.\n\nRelease date: February 6, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Friz Freleng.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Wolf narrator, 3rd pig), Sara Berner (1st and 2nd pig).\n\nStory credit unknown.\n\nAnimation credit unknown.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\n(based on the Brahms Hungarian Dances).\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Hilarious parody of the infamous \"Three Little Pigs\" tale told by the \"Hungarian Dances\" piece.\n\nOriginal cartoon titles.\n\nA quote repeated several times before, but worth another mention to fit with the theme of today's review. Friz Freleng explains his love for music in animated cartoons, and why he uses it regularly in Leonard Maltin's Of Mice and Magic:\n\n\"I love music. I can't read it, but I can feel it. When I hear it, I see things in my mind. Music inspires my visual thinking. I time my cartoons to music, and I find it helps me. Everything is done rhythmically.\" After a successful feat in Rhapsody in Rivets (which earned the Studio an Oscar nomination); Friz leaps at another chance in tackling classical Eastern European music: Joannes Brahm's Hungarian Dances - telling it in a form of a well-known fairy tale (and in the public domain). One challenge after the other; Friz's incredible vision takes the opportunity to parody Disney; primarily The Three Little Pigs and not forgetting the then fairly recent Fantasia.\n\nAnimation by Dick Bickenbach.\n\nThe opening sequence is a direct parody of Fantasia itself - with the staging and art direction similar to the Deems Taylor footage. Replacing Taylor, is a wolf narrator - depicted with a Brooklynese accent. Mel Blanc gives the wolf some added character as he has struggles pronouncing \"interpretation\" during his narration. It's a clever parody indicating how establishes critics can make mistakes.\n\nSome scenes during the musical show direct references to the popular Silly Symphony short. Released only a decade earlier, Disney's Three Little Pigs was very popular in cinema during the Great Depression as it helped raise spirits during dark times while it revolutionised the standards of character animation.\n\nFriz Freleng takes some iconic moments from the short and pays homage to it as featured the two procrastinating pigs dancing merrily, whilst the smart pig takes no chances by continuing work on his bricked home. It's a funny little parody where it perfectly harmonises with Brahm's musical piece. It recurs a second time later in the cartoon; becoming a motif for the two pigs who ignore the potential peril they're in.\n\nThe Hungarian Dance No. 5 perfectly indicates each pig's personality during their introductory scenes. For the first two pigs they have the same theme. Their actions are a cutting match to the music; as their construction of their homes is rushed and inadequate, as depicted within the music. The rushed quality of the house results in the second pig having to reconstruct his collapsed matchstick home.\n\nFriz Freleng nails the timing right down to every frame; as the timing of the rushed construction is conveyed beautifully in animation - such as the first pig frantically raking the hay. It's the only sequence where the rules are violated within the musical classic standards. Each pig has a simple line of dialogue only intended as exposition.\n\nFor the practical pig - the pig is given a different theme compared to the first two. The music is much slower and steady; compared to the previous energetic theme, thanks to Friz's remarkable vision. This conveys the pig's meticulous nature wonderfully; as carefully he spreads the cement on layer and stacks the bricks in an assembly line, one-by-one.\n\nIt's a fitting motif for the third pig, as it distinguishes his own personality from the previous two pigs. To close the sequence with a gag - a nested crane oversees the construction of the house roof. Seeking an opportunity of a new residence, unexpectedly he plants his nest on top of it and resides there; much to the annoyance of the smart pig.\n\nThe wolf's introduction is a bizarre yet still suitable dance as the dance number goes into a different theme. To capture the dance believably while synchronised accurately to the music; Freleng has the wolf perform a Cossack dance as he travels through the woodlands.\n\nThe wolf, who is caricatured and illustrated as a villain; appears to be law-abiding enough to signal a left-turn in traffic - which is a decent, spontaneous touch. To keep with budget constraints; Freleng cuts down on animation footage while maintaining the accurate synchronisation to the piece.\n\nPhil Monroe, the animator on the sequence animates only two poses of the wolf discreetly sneaking up on the tree; and using those poses for consistency. A difficult feat to meet with Freleng's high standards. The gag itself pays off as the wolf unknowingly falls into a pond; but crosses his way through underwater and back onto soil.\n\nFriz never loses focus on the narrative as he builds further on zanier ideas to have the pigs in peril. Spontaneously, the wolf leaps from the rock disguised as a gypsy dancer playing a tambourine, whilst dancing in rhythm to Brahm's dance number. The wolf entices the two pigs to the point where they rotate their bodies; turning their legs in a knot - a very subtle gag thanks to the convincing charade of the wolf.\n\nEnticing the pigs once more with his tambourine, they walk into a trap - creating an obstacle in the story whilst still perfectly blended with the music. Freleng's delivery and timing couldn't be topped any further when he pigs unexpectedly beat up the wolf off-screen and leap out the rock in gypsy costumes and dancing to the music; the faster it becomes.\n\nA very unpredictable move by the pigs, making the sequence itself more entertaining - indicating they were bluffing the entire time. Gerry Chiniquy's animation of the pig dancers features great staging skills and hilarious caricature on their faces. Their fun is almost over when the wolf reveals his true, sinister nature - making the pigs more vulnerable. Cornered, they run from the wolf to hide in the straw home.\n\nAnimation by Gerry Chiniquy.\n\nAfter encountering with the pigs with a plan flawed - the wolf sticks to a different strategy; to mercilessly trap and kill the pigs without further ado. The suspense blends well to the music as the action of the wolf advancing further helps build up the pace to the score.\n\nFreleng takes an alternate approach by finding different ways for the wolf to destroy their homes. Instead of \"blowing the house down\" as typically told in the story; the gags are much wittier and broad.\n\nFor the house full of straw; the wolf lights a match and has the home destroyed in seconds. For the house of matchsticks, the wolf observes the delicate balance it stands and adds another matchstick on top to make it collapse. The gags work greatly even for economical reasons; as the wolf's intensive blow wouldn't have fitted with the music synchronisation; so different strategies make the scenes funnier that way. During the chase; the pigs safely make it into the bricked house.\n\nFriz's extroadinary vision of music and storytelling combine a great result where a string of recurring gags fit appropriately during the No. 6 dance; which features the wolf constantly slamming onto a door, with his head triggering as he faints.\n\nThe following scene is a great tour-de-force of Friz's timing and Chiniquy's animation. The wolf attempts to strike the house down with his puffing, but to no avail. Milt Franklyn's orchestration fits the right atmosphere of the wolf's action.\n\nThe heavy, suspenseful music adds to the determination and struggles of the wolf. There is even enough time for a hilarious mouthwash gag (in a lame pun known as Lusterine), a subtle insult on the wolf's bad breath. Following that, the wolf stands back quite a distance in hopes of breaking down the door - it couldn't have been timed and synchronised any better, As he makes a run for it; the pigs cunningly open the door to let him in - so he can fall for the old gag routine. The practical pig shuts the back door in time so the wolf smacks right into it; and then gets dumped at the backyard,\n\nSafe inside the bricked house, the two pigs dance and celebrate to Hungarian Dance No. 7 (repeated animation from earlier). The practical pig is annoyed at their own presence as he watches them frustratingly.\n\nThe following sequence is a great showcase at where Freleng wisely selects the nature of the music to create a suspenseful sequence. Outside, the pigs hear sad violin music (Hungarian Dance No. 17) and look out the window to find the wolf disguised as a poor, old babushka.\n\nThe wolf's disguise is evidently revealing as he is supposedly covered in a storm of fake snow (seen from the pig's POV); when really he has talcum powder dispensed from a contraption attached to his back. Animator on the sequence Phil Monroe gives some added character to the wolf as he shakes the powder to make his disguise more convincing; whilst still successfully timed to the music.\n\nIt's a clever scenario choice as the music helps emphasise the pigs' sympathy for the disguised wolf. Ignoring the protest warning of the practical pig; the two pigs push him aside from the door and let the disguised wolf inside for some shelter. The following shot is very ironic for its gag pay-off. The wise brother is suspicious of the disguise; and discreetly lifts the cloak up from back to discover a record player - implying that Brahm's music is being played within the actual dance number. The pig turns the record to the other side to the wolf's motif. The wolf can't help himself but perform the Cossack; which unveils his disguise.\n\nFor the final climax; Friz Freleng wisely selects the Hungarian Dance No. 6 to sync with the action scenes, which he uses as a motif for the short. The classical music is played so inventively in the final sequence to the point where the music overlaps the contradiction of the house's architecture.\n\nSeen from the exterior as a one-story house. The action shots of the pigs upstairs indicate the house is somehow larger than it looks. The music and action are synchronised so brilliantly and innovative that one would completely overlook the idea that the house has an elevator; causing the wolf to fall down several floors; leading him supposedly down to the basement.\n\nOnce again, Friz Freleng exceeds in mastering in synchronising classical music into gag animation which he achieved in Rhapsody in Rivets - and earning the Schlesinger studio another Oscar nomination. Whereas Rhapsody focused on a construction site followed by a string of gags to blend in with Franz List's Hungarian Rhapsody; this is the first where Friz blends classical music while telling a story altogether. The character personalities are wonderfully depicted with the various choices of music in the dance number. It's a pity the story credit today is now a mystery; due to the cartoon being \"Blue Ribboned\" and no credits recorded in the copyright category. It's a safe bet that either Ted Pierce or Mike Maltese wrote the short; leaning more towards Maltese. Whoever wrote it deserves praise for an incredible vision in conceiving the appropriate gags and material to the Brahms piece. All in all, a Freleng masterpiece.\n\nRating: 5/5.\n\n↧\n\n395. Tortoise Wins By a Hare (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 394.\n\nRelease date: February 20, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Bob Clampett.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny / Cecil Turtle / Mrs. Cecil Turtle / Narrators / Rabbit Bookee / Dumb Rabbit at Finish Line), Kent Rogers (Dumb Rabbit with Telescope).\n\nStory: Warren Foster.\n\nAnimation: Bob McKimson.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Refusing to admit defeat; Bugs Bunny challenges his racing opponent Cecil Turtle for another race - this time with more conniving tricks.\n\nHow often is Bugs Bunny portrayed as a loser? Rarely. As mentioned in the original Tortoise Beats Harereview; Tex Avery had already begun experimenting with Bugs' personality from his standard streetwise persona. Once Tex left the studio and Bob Clampett inherited his Merrie Melodies unit, Clampett takes the opportunity to reuse Bugs'\"sore loser\" personality and take it to different heights - thus, creating a sequel from Tex's fable parody.\n\nThe opening sequence has a combination of fresh and reused material. Much of the opening is stock footage from the previous Cecil Turtle short, which observes the race between the two opponents as well as the petty tricks the rabbit performed. Not only does it cut corners and keeps within budget constraints - but it also creates good exposition for what is yet to come - and the frustration Bugs Bunny feels.\n\nAdditional narration masterfully voiced by Mel Blanc is kept to the style and energy of Clampett's direction as he excitedly commentates on the race which makes up for the more conservative pacing from the original Tex short.\n\nUp until the closing of the commentary - it's interesting to see how the footage had been deliberately manipulated by removing Cecil's cunning tricks as indicated in the original ending - therefore replacing it with new animation of Cecil boasting about his triumph.\n\nFollowing that - Rod Scribner delights the viewer with a tour-de-force piece of character animation that helps convey Bugs' frustration and confusion perfectly. It's no easy ride for any animation professional to animate a character whose goes through a wide range of emotions and mood swings. Bugs finishes watching the reel outraged and astonished: \"How does he do it?\" as he spits out bites from his carrot and vigorously kicks the projector away.\n\nBugs paces around his home, bewildered: \"I can't understand it! It's against the laws of nature. We just ain't in the cards! A toitle beatin' me, a rabbit?!\". Then his emotions switches to arrogance and pride: \"Yeah, I'm an athlete. I've got an athelete's physique. Sure! I got an athlete's legs. Coitenly, I even got an athlete's foot!\" and shows off his foot - with the proportions of a human foot.\n\nThe opening sequence is an excellent piece of exposition that reveals Bugs' motives and a rare observation of his true colours - or at least how Bob Clampett interprets him. His soliloquy indicates that he feels threatened and disgraced of being outwitted, and is determined to restore his pride: \"How does that moron do it? I'll find out his secret, if it's the last thing I ever do!\"\n\nThe subtle animation switch from Scribner to Bob McKimson in the dialogue (\"And I will, too\") creates the perfect mood change, as McKimson could capture that appeal into Bugs' sudden relaxed attitude - while Scribner could push the poses and hit the accents abruptly to express his temper in an over-animated way.\n\nFor a character whom the audience have grown to love for his streetwise, mischievous nature - Clampett's meddling of his standard personality gives him a dark side that movie-goers hadn't likely experienced, and perhaps feel empathy for. Since Cecil Turtle is portrayed with low cunning that drives Bugs to insanity - the audience would root for Bugs' second chance to win that race.\n\nTo get what he wants - Bugs takes every chance possible by disguising himself to get information out of Cecil Turtle - which eventually created identity confusion from the rabbit population. Determination for Bugs to win is not only centred on the rabbit himself - but the majority of rabbit spectators who are willing to cheat, putting their arrogance above everything.\n\nBugs' optimism and motivation to win has poisoned his mind, to the point he overlooks the subtle tricks Cecil planted on him. This is evident when he designs the \"modern design and streamline\" shell. Once he dresses behind a curtain, complete with a swim cap on his head - Bugs could become a victim of his own disguise. This indicates that Bugs thinks he's becoming craftier than before by learning from his mistakes; but is oblivious to the potential traps Cecil has lied in store for him.\n\nCecil's superior craftiness is essential in the sequence featuring Bugs' disguise as Bill Thompson's Old Timer character from Fibber McGee and Molly. Bugs disguises himself as an elderly critter in an attempt to seek information out of Cecil's secret method for beating Bugs Bunny, as asked: (\"Tell me, Johnny! How come you always beat dat rabbit!\").\n\nAnimation by Bob McKimson.\n\nCecil, who can see through his disguise, deliberately gives him a false answer - hinting he has another cunning trap set for Bugs Bunny. Cecil claims: \"The secret is modern design, y'know, streamlinin'\". He reveals a blueprint of his \"air-flow chassis\" - which is very clearly a design of a turtle shell, which Bugs dimly sees past.\n\nA masterwork of character animation and story arcing - Clampett's bad habits of abrupt cuts are revealing in the part where Cecil explains his comparison to how \"rabbits are built all wrong for racing\" compared to turtles. Whether it was an intended cut or a deleted piece in-between - it's a mystery.\n\nTaking advantage of Bugs' unintelligence, he carries on further by criticising the \"ridiculous ears\" as just \"wind resistors\". Clampett's timing has a funny touch to it as Bugs attempts to discreetly write the information in a typewriter hidden under his heard - indicating that Bugs' disguise and role play has no subtlety at all. Before leaving, Cecil makes one cutting remark which foreshadows the rest of the short: \"Rabbits aren't very bright, either.\"\n\n\"Rabbits aren't very bright\". Warren Foster takes advantage of the quote and builds it as a running gag and a recurring problem for Bugs. While Bugs is winning at the start of the race, the rabbit spectators mistake Bugs'\"modern design\" costume as the turtle. In an attempt to sabotage the race - the rabbits paint the road lines to a corner facing a brick wall; giving Bugs an accident.\n\nAssaulting Bugs, he protests: \"Toitle Shmoitle! I'm the rabbit!\" - but the close-minded rabbits are too ignorant to see past the disguise and continue attacking him. So, Cecil reinforces the misconception by disguising himself in a rabbit costume and munching a carrot, staying in character: \"Yup, that's the turtle alright!\". So, the rabbits allow the disguised turtle to continue the race freely while Bugs fights his way to finish the race.\n\nThe problem worsens as when Bugs speeds past the rabbits to outrun the turtle. The muddle between both identities thus turn Bugs' race into a nightmare as the mobster rabbit shoots at his shell - where the ricocheted bullets spare him, followed by underground explosives that delay his speed.\n\nFoster's genius at conceiving misunderstood situations results in Cecil winning the race and once again - outsmarting the rabbit.\n\nThe misunderstanding between the identities plays a key role in a mini sub-plot that centres on a group of rabbit gangsters. Prior to the race, an exposition sequence reveals that Bugs isn't alone in his motivation to win the race. The rabbit bookie comments, \"We bettin' everything we got on that rabbit to win. In fact, we don't even think that the toitle will finish, do we boys?\" - hinting a devious plot that would foreshadow Bugs' foiled disguise.\n\nBuilding up to the cartoon's climax - Bugs overtakes the turtle in the race and wins again. By a twist of fate, the gangsters hide behind the finish sign - mistaking Bugs as the turtle. At his near moment of triumph; it's crushed as he is pounded by the mobsters; while the other rabbits give the race to Cecil.\n\nDefeated and confused, he finally cracks as he shreds his disguise away and cries out: \"You fools! Whatt'ya doin'? I'm the rabbit! The rabbit! Look, I'm the rabbit!\". The finale is another beautiful showcase of Rod Scribner's over-animating that nails Bugs' devastation perfectly - expressing a lot of imagination in Bugs' shape to get a performance out of it. Upon realisation, the gangster rabbits say: \"Meh, now he tells us!\".\n\nKnowing they've lost their entire fortune on gambling; they take a pistol to their temples simultaneously and commit suicide right at the finish line as the short abruptly cross-dissolves. Their suicide at the finishing line itself is a visual metaphor - marking where their lives will \"finish\". A cynical, dark ending itself - Cecil's comments on rabbits being unintelligent and his trickery had lost to several lives.\n\n(For those interested in the hidden gags; the newspaper scene is full of it - though WWII-related. Perhaps the most alarming in the shot of the front paper is the mini-headline reading \"Adolph Hitler Commits Suicide\"- a fact which was foreseen two years later. Ironic, how the petty race tournament makes bigger headlines than the suicide headline. In the close-up of Cecil and Bugs, he shows off his \"A\" and \"C\" ration cards - hinting it's his \"secret weapon\").\n\nAnimation by Virgil Ross.\n\nWhat also makes the short so rich asides from characterisation and storytelling - is Clampett's take on speed and energy compared to Avery's fable. Whilst Avery had Tortoise Beats Hare built towards a gradual climax rather than speed; Clampett takes complete advantage of that. The energy helps convey Bugs' arrogance and pride perfectly throughout the race sequence.\n\nJust prior to the race, there is a great piece which captures the arrogance persona. This is evident when Bugs slaps Cecil's face into a tangle - to emphasise he is the dominant bully, and brawny - compared to the brainy Cecil.\n\nBugs'\"modern design\" costume also helps capture the energy and speed of the race - as Bugs runs a big streak by easily outrunning the turtle. He bursts with excitement as he shows off his costume and goes into funny poses, which displays too much confidence in his part. Clampett even manipulates the speed to the point where Bugs' speed goes completely out of frame. This example occurs as Bugs speeds close to the finishing line as he races rapidly past to the point where the camera loses track of him.\n\nComparing the sequel to it's original predecessor - it's remarkable to see the major difference in the Warner short's sharp-timing and broader energy in a span of just two years. The sequel is completely focused on frustration and motivation; which is blended perfectly altogether in every department. Clampett's energy and timing is spiced up wonderfully. The time period couldn't have been more perfect; as it was made during the Second World War - when animation from the major studios became more cynical and vibrant due to that effect. Warren Foster couldn't have depicted a more compelling and hilarious scenario to indicate another of Bugs Bunny's failure. The characterisation and circumstances scattered in the cartoon is incredibly well founded, it's easily up a couple of notches from Tex's animated short. For an animated short, Cecil has so much character written around him: a conniving trickster who takes Bugs Bunny to a level or degree that audiences hadn't considered or experienced before.\n\nRating: 5/5.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n396. The Fifth-Column Mouse (1943)\n\nOriginal title card.\n\nWarner cartoon no. 395.\n\nRelease date: March 6, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Friz Freleng.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Dumb Mouse / Cat / Other mice), Michael Maltese (Strategy Mouse) \\ Sportsman Quartet & Sherry Allen Group (Vocal singers).\n\nStory credit unknown.\n\nAnimation credit unknown.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: The mice of a house prepare for war as their appeasement policy fail to end the menace of a cat.\n\nThe cat wipes the condensation from\n\nthe window and peeks through - an\n\nallegorical representation of Hitler.\n\nAs World War II had hit hard at the United States - it gave the opportunity for many animation studios to make satirical anti-Nazi cartoons to mock the enemy. At Warner's, Norm McCabe made an allegorical short depicting Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo as ducks in The Ducktators. Friz Freleng pulls it off similarly in this cartoon; but told from a cat-and-mouse perspective.\n\nThe short itself is a satire depicting the cat's low cunning; which parallels Hitler's double-crossing schemes against the Allies; the most infamous being the non-aggressive pact made between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the summer of 1939.\n\nAnother notable example occurred with British Prime Minister's Neville Chamberlain's \"peace in our time\" speech, concerning the Munich Agreement. Remembered for it's ironic value, Adolf Hitler's continued dictatorship and the invasion of Poland followed with declarations of war from France and the United Kingdom. Whoever wrote the short (Mike Maltese or Ted Pierce?), it's an innovative portrayal of two feuding sides, like the mice and the cat, attempting make an appeasement without decreasing the enemies' power. After being double-crossed, the Allies are forced to declare war.\n\nOriginally, a line was sang by the mice:\n\n\"Down with the Axis / We're glad to pay\n\ntaxes\" as part of the chorus - but was later\n\nomitted in its re-release; as it was\n\nconsidered dated. The original audio used\n\nto exist online years ago.\n\nThe opening sequence establishes a fitting exposition of the mice's peaceful times. Raiding the kitchen; they celebrate their carefree liberties by singing Ain't We Got Fun? as they engage in several activities around the room - like skiing down window blinds.\n\nAnimation by Dick Bickenbach.\n\nTheir fun is at the brink of danger when a snooping cat observes them through the window. One timid mouse notices the cat's presence and panics as he takes caution to the grey mouse.\n\nThe grey mouse responds with an imprudent attitude: \"Aww, there's nuthin' to be afraid of. He can't hurt us. He can't get in here!\". A moment later; the grey mouse's words are eaten as the cat effortlessly makes it into the kitchen - creating a panic across the kitchen. The attitude itself reflects the behaviour of other Allied countries who overlooked Hitler's wicked policies. This resulted in the majority of Europe invaded by Germany at the start of the war. To some extent; it can be linked to the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbour - which immediately followed on the nation's declaration of war.\n\nUpon the invasion of the kitchen, the mouse watchman cries: \"The cat! Lights out!\"; creating a blackout across the kitchen - another key element of the Second World War. The mice run across the rooms in an attempt to save themselves from the cat and back to their mouse-hole.\n\nThe grey mouse, however, walks into a trap as he finds him approaching into a set-up mouse hole, masqueraded as the cat's mouth. Whoever painted Friz Freleng's backgrounds on this short (most likely Paul Julian - 13/04 edit: I stand corrected; it was Lenard Kester - see comments) - the blackout scenes create a very subtle tone to make it not completely dark on screen - but by adding value blends to interpret the actions happening. The silhouetted mice in the background helps fit the mood and effect required for the scene.\n\nThe conference between the cat and the grey mouse is very compelling in developing characterisations. The personalities read very clearly: the cat is conniving; while the grey mouse is cowardly and greedy. Once the mouse is cornered by the cat; he entices the grey mouse by acting friendly (\"What's the rush? I'm not going to hurt you\") and offers him a slice of cheese.\n\nAnimation by Gerry Chiniquy.\n\nImmediately, the mouse is enchanted by the appetising piece of cheese as he attempts to take a bite. Graciously refusing him a piece; the cat manipulates him by making an appeasement: by offering him an endless supply of cheese in exchange for the mice to serve for him. The grey mouse, initially reluctant, is once again distracted by the scent of cheese which the cat uses as bait to manipulate and control him.\n\nIt's a great satire on dictatorship as the cat plays all the elements of a dictator: full of low cunning and manipulation. Henceforth, the mouse lives up to the title: becoming a 'fifth-column' as he cowardly agrees to side with the enemy for his own desires.\n\nIn a bid to portray a seminar as riveting and innovative - and yet advancing the story: the solution is answered. Instead of a hearted argument which is typically portrayed in conference sequences for war films; the mice's two leading arguments are dealt in a song battle. The feud sung in the melody of Blues in the Night is itself a bizarre, uncanny concept - but it's hilariously executed that it's accepted easily.\n\nThe grey mouse sings to the mice committee in an attempt to convince them to fulfil an appeasement policy with the cat. The alternate lyrics are written with little references to the song like: \"Dat catty done told me / out there in the kitchen\" or \"that cat is a two-face / A treacherous thing who will leave us to sing 'the blues in the night'\". The parody is so inventively written that the sequence itself surpasses without being too corny or in bad-taste.\n\nAnimation by Phil Monroe.\n\nThe right touches are blended well in the sequence as Friz Freleng's right frame of mind of dynamic staging comes together neatly that would otherwise be difficult to pull off in animation. An example appears like the rear shot of the grey mouse appealing to the mice committee. It's a great piece of composition that captures the rally-like appearance as well as its charismatic nature.\n\nThe shots also cut to the cat who eavesdrops the song battle - nodding with approval over his crooked plan working accordingly. The cat's take at the defending mice rebelling against him (\"That cat's a rat just the same!\") has a nice touch to it.\n\nAnd reluctantly, the mice agree to the appeasement. Falling under the power of the cat; he has their rights breeched as he enslaves them so he can live luxuriously and pampered. Some reluctant mice attempt to revolt, with one deliberately filing his nail hastily - but this results with a flick on his head.\n\nLike Hitler, the cat's two-faced backstabbing persona is revealed as he starts to take complete advantage of the mice's fear and oppression. Whilst ordering from the menu, he slyly remarks: \"Did you ever have a feeling that you a--wanted something, and...but you didn't know what it was?\".\n\nMaking up his mind, he asks for a \"nice, fat, tender mouse\". Alarmed, the majority of the mice make a run and retreat back to their holes. The grey mouse, attempting to remain the cat's good graces, finds himself a victim of circumstances. The cat hungrily glares: \"You're a nice, fat, tender mouse. You'll do\". The grey mouse makes a lucky escape and returns to his hole - resulting in the rest of the group to declare war on the cat.\n\nThe grey mouse's fifth-column personality appears to play a key identity; as he's the only grey-coloured mouse compared to the other brown mice - hinting he's the outcast and likely traitor of the group.\n\nAs the mice prepare for war; the allegorical satire turns to a more patriotic and hopeful note. As the war wouldn't end for another two years - it's ideal that Friz would have the Allied mice win for the sake of sticking to its principals and patriotism.\n\nAn amusing blueprint depicting the cat\n\non the attack.\n\nFriz Freleng's montage sequence of the mice troops is heavy with war propaganda. Not only is it evident in the off-screen chorus singers singing We Did It Before (And We Can Do It Again); but the \"Buy Bond\" posters, too - a common propaganda poster for animated cartoons.\n\nGags that are standard to the style of Warner Bros. coincide with the nationalistic sequence; as evident in the shot of an assembly line of mice troops having their troop hats installed. The machine appears to be out of action, as one mouse unexpectedly gets a boater placed on top of his head.\n\nFor the battle sequence; it's a fitting combination of great gagwork and what Friz Freleng's masterful direction of comic timing and staging has in store. The cat is being chased by a mechanical-like bulldog; controlled by the mice. To keep it inventive and entertaining; Freleng includes a great POV scope shot of the cat's ambush - while the mice off-screen are trying to coordinate the target at the right position.\n\nTo make the mechanical-bulldog come across as great effort; the mice pull an extended pair of false teeth to bite the cat's tail. Stalling's frame of mind for action fits accordingly as he uses Johann Strauss'Perpetual Motion for the battle sequence.\n\nFreleng's staging ideas makes the chase all the more exciting to watch - as the cat and the mechanical-bulldog run at different perspectives animation-wise. The cat finally surrenders when a mouse finishes him by turning on an electric razor to trim almost all of his fur.\n\nVictorious - the mice troops finish into a finale of We Did It Before. Their victory is almost marred when the uncooperative grey mouse cuts in, attempting to claim partial credit: \"We dood it!\" (quoting Red Skelton). In response to his starting of a war; the mice throw a piece of cheese at him.\n\nAlthough it might be a tad dated with its patriotic overtones and it's allegorical message - its satire depicting the cat-and-mouse routine shows it remains an all-round creative, prescient effort. The characterisations of the cat and the grey mouse are convincingly portrayed that the dictatorship satire can go almost unnoticed by a modern or younger viewer. To some extent, the short is a throwback to the earlier Warner Bros. shorts of the 1930s; like Bingo Crosbyana or A Sunbonnet Blue where a group of allied small animals work together to defeat a bigger foe. Except in the case of Fifth-Column Mouse, the short has tempo and magnetism that the source material can be reworked to fit with a new audience compared to a decade earlier.\n\nRating: 4/5.\n\n↧\n\n397. To Duck...or Not to Duck (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 396.\n\nRelease date: March 6, 1943.\n\nSeries: Looney Tunes.\n\nSupervision: Chuck Jones.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Daffy Duck / Larimore / Duck Referee), Arthur Q Bryan (Elmer Fudd).\n\nStory: Ted Pierce.\n\nAnimation: Bobe Cannon.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Daffy Duck challenges Elmer to a boxing match; to prove he's more vulnerable without a weapon.\n\nAnimation by Bobe Cannon.\n\nBy this point at the Schlesinger studios; Daffy Duck or Elmer Fudd had become so established it gave the writers an opportunity to expand their roles in the Looney Tunes universe. In this case, Ted Pierce takes the chance of penning the first Daffy/Elmer collaboration. It makes a fitting combination to expand Elmer's activities as a hunter, asides from hunting \"wascally wabbits\".\n\nAs far as colour styling goes; it's an unusual blend. The sky colour has a sepia wash look to it; which is seen all through the short with Technicolor-painted characters like Daffy or Elmer applied to the backgrounds. Another example of experimenting with layouts and colour styling; this short's takes on a dangerous task to pull it off accordingly; that only Gene Fleury could tackle.\n\nChuck Jones was still heavy with smear animation in light of The Dover Boys. The opening sequence of Daffy flying up the sky is an example alone. Humming to himself casually; he narrowly misses the gunshots fired by an unseen hunter. He uses the clouds to protect himself.\n\nAs he carries on, he makes a snide comment on the shooting: \"Confidentially, those hunters couldn't hit the broad side of a duck.\" As he eats those words; a bullet strikes Daffy's tail-feathers - he them hams it up reacting melodramatically and falls.\n\nBobe Cannon does a stellar job on a complex animation assignment as the scene shows how involved Daffy is, as well as the various actions he pulls across the scene (like his \"invisible bicycle\" trick). Daffy falls to the ground; but lands safely by the softness of a pillow and is retrieved by Larimore, Elmer's hunting dog. Daffy's brief \"resurrection\" on lecturing Larimore on how to retrieve a duck adds to the touch and charm of Daffy's persona.\n\nAnd so, Elmer apologises to a motionless Daffy Duck, but proudly acknowledges he's a \"gweat sportsman\". Daffy retorts to Elmer's comment and slowly awakens, offended by his biased comment (\"Listen, sport! You don't know the meaning of fair play!\"). Daffy bullies and dominates Elmer further on, by removing his hunting equipment and stripping him to his boxer shorts. He proves Elmer's weak without his weapons, and so challenges him to a \"fair\" fight.\n\nThe sequence proves that the Elmer/Daffy alliance in the short has merit. It sheds more light on Daffy, and Ted Pierce's writing works so well around his character it would seem slightly out of character in 1943 for Bugs Bunny to perform.\n\nDaffy's domineering is elegant and spontaneous, especially as he strips most of Elmer and cornering him. It's a funny foreplay of a smaller, defenseless character bullying a bigger, equipped man so effortlessly and entrancing.\n\nAnother tough but effortless piece of animation by Ken Harris; who nails Daffy's domineering personality. Both characters express a lot of personality on screen; and their actions read very clearly - especially the vulnerability on Elmer. Harris navigates through Chuck Jones' and John McGrew's layouts beautifully - particularly in the scene of Daffy cornering Elmer to a wrestling ring, which for some reason is located in the middle of a swamp - and already surrounded by duck spectators.\n\nDaffy's unconstrained personality is nailed milestones ahead in the sequence showing the start of the fight. Both the duck referee and Daffy are in league together in making it a very unfair fight for Elmer.\n\nBefore the match begins, the referee exhorts the two opponents to \"fight clean\". His forth-wall \"wink\" is a fitting touch to indicate his conniving trick. The referee carries out the rules of the game; and asks for \"no rough stuff\".\n\nSo, the referee uses Elmer as an example by punching and assaulting Elmer each time he demands: \"None of THIS! Or THAT! Or like so!\". Ted Pierce takes advantage of his interest for violent, physical gags; and uses them comically and appropriately to make the fight unfair on Elmer's behalf.\n\nTo be reassured; Daffy recites the off-limit rules of the fight by repeating the referee's actions and regulations and injures Elmer even further. It's a hilarious piece of action by Daffy; as Mel Blanc's delivery on the character makes him appear law-abiding and innocent, which is of course contradictory. It's a hilariously conceived gag implies the ducks are hypocritical and unfair, much like Elmer.\n\nMore of Ted Pierce's physical ideas kick into gear that fit into Daffy's spontaneity. An example occurs once Elmer is knocked out at the corner of the ring; encouraging him to fight back: \"Give it to him, champ! Let him have it, champ!\". Spontaneously, Daffy feels the bald texture on Elmer's head. He suggests, \"How about a little somethin' to stimulate the scalp?\". He produces a hair tonic bottle, and knocks him out-cold again.\n\nA cross-dissolve manipulates time as a weary Elmer walks over to shake Daffy's hand before another fighting round. With the mannerisms of a screwball; Daffy plays on Elmer's mind asking \"Which hand do you take?\"...resulting in a little game of guessing the right hand.\n\nOnce Elmer picks the hand; Daffy reassures him before he smashes him with a mallet. Although the gag is a tad predictable; Daffy breaks the forth wall prior to the outcome, commenting: \"Ain't he a dope?\" which obviously implies Elmer's falling into a trap; but it's his gullible nature what makes the delivery of the gag work. It's a funny little sequence that conveys Elmer's naiveness wonderfully, and Ted Pierce's good gag sense forth-wall lines blend together.\n\nDespite funny characterisations and gag sense in the cartoon; Chuck Jones' direction still has flaws that adorn the short. His pacing is a little sloppy in the sequence where the referee introduces the two opponents. First, the transition from a threatening Daffy to the announcement of the fight is too fast-paced and abrupt; as it doesn't manipulate time with a cross-dissolve. The sloppy timing is evident from Daffy taking Elmer to the ring; that cuts right to an establishing shot of the duck spectators surrounding the arena.\n\nAs the duck referee is about to introduce Elmer; he laughs mockingly at his appearance: \"He's a dog! You can have him! What a trap!\" and breaks into hysterical laughter, and hangs onto the rope to control himself. Mel Blanc's delivery on the laughs is irresistible and entertaining; although it slows down the sequence slightly.\n\nThe following scene where the duck referee introduces Daffy Duck, paces slower than the laughing sequence. The duck referee looks at Daffy with absolute admiration. He admirably caresses and snuggles onto a pampered Daffy as he announces him as: \"Daffy 'Good to His Mother' Duck\".\n\nIt's a funny sequence alone to express an obvious comparison: the referee shows strong favouritism towards his own specie, being Daffy. But as part of the story, the sequence is slightly over-written with a little too much filler that doesn't quite fit the tone with the rest of the short.\n\nThe gags in the short that are probably the most innovative and better accomplished are the gags focused on Elmer's dog, Larimore. Between the introductions from the referee; the duck spectators boo in unison at Elmer; while Larimore cheers on Elmer - which results in brickbats getting thrown at him by the duck spectators. The reactions reverse after Daffy's introduction; with the ducks cheering on him, while Larimore boos at him - getting the same reaction from the spectators.\n\nChuck's layouts and Ted Pierce's writing create a hilarious visual juxtaposition that fits the cynical humour in the Warner Bros. shorts. The duck spectators are a large crowd adorning the arena; indicating the number of support Daffy has. Meanwhile, Larimore is the only supporter of Elmer - and sits in a completely isolated stand. Chuck's timing on the objects flying at Larimore couldn't have been executed better or funnier.\n\nAnother great little line occurs when Larimore spectates the wrong-doings in the fight. Breaking the forth wall, he observes: \"Y'know there's somethin' awfully screwy about this fight...or my name isn't Larimore. And it isn't\". Of course, he's been called that all through the picture.\n\nAfter being knocked out again from Daffy's mallet; the referee unfairly declares him knocked-out by rapidly counting to ten. He declares Daffy Duck the winner, where he receives a standing ovation from the duck spectators.\n\nElmer, regaining consciousness, steps in and complains about the violations of the rules. Finally getting even with the two ducks; he recites the rules of the game and performs similar violent actions towards them, as he makes his point.\n\nA decent closure gag for the short; the abrupt ending and sloppy pacing around the short has marred the cartoon slightly. The fight sequences aren't paced or executed very well as it shows little or no build up to a climax; as it's merely a string of gags of Daffy tricking Elmer Fudd. While Elmer gets even with the ducks - the ending gag feels somewhat rushed and out of place - given that the short has a slightly smaller running time compared to the average animated short.\n\nTo Duck or Not to Duck contains some funny elements of characterisation with the occasional perfectly-executed gag; but putting it altogether it's a slapdash effort for Chuck Jones. With a decent introduction and a great build-up that leads Elmer and Daffy to the wrestling ring; most of the short's problems are laid on the fighting scenes. The pacing is very inconsistent and unorganised that was sometimes sluggish or too abrupt. It appears Ted Pierce was more interested in conceiving physical gags rather than fixing the structure of the plot. Pacing problems asides - it points out the potential and opens the possibilities the Elmer/Daffy Duck pairings that resulted in far superior cartoons which later followed. Audiences might've taken it for granted upon its first release; but today - Jones' short doesn't hold up too greatly as a first effort of a Daffy/Elmer pairing. In all, the cartoon is passable and an innovative effort of pairing the two iconic characters.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.\n\n↧\n\n398. Flop Goes the Weasel (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 397.\n\nRelease date: March 20, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Chuck Jones.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Baby Chick / Weasel), Ruby Dandridge (Mother Hen).\n\nStory credit unknown.\n\nAnimation credit unknown.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: A weasel steals a newly-hatched egg; where the chick mistakes the weasel as his mother. Desperate to eat him, the weasel plays along.\n\nFor the sake of \"politically correct\" readers; let's brush this out of the way. The short is perhaps known today for its racial imagery and stereotypes: especially on the mother hen and her newly-hatched chicken. The mother adorns the stereotype, as she wears a kerchief and speaks in a Southern accent.\n\nHowever, as a reviewer: it's important to understand the cultural context of the era it was produced - as it's otherwise ignorant to write off the past as if it's never happened. The stereotypes themselves aren't the central focus of the short: which more importantly deals with the antics of a baby chicken and a weasel.\n\nThe stereotypes themselves are so subtle, especially on the baby chicken that it goes inconspicuously throughout the short - as the funny portrayals of a baby chick outwitting a foxy weasel makes it stand out. Enough of the malarkey and on with the cartoon:\n\nThe opening status quo reveals a mother hen awaiting for her child to hatch as she knits and hums tenderly to Mammy's Little Coal Black Rose. The mother feels a rhythmic tapping from the egg; and leaps happily of a seemingly merry moment. She temporarily leaves her coop for the lookout of a \"southern fried worm\". As she leaves; a foxy weasel takes his chance to steal the egg himself to eat.\n\nThe weasel's introduction is a broad, exaggerated portrayal of his characterisation and discreet nature. He hides at various spots surrounding the coop to reassure himself he is unseen; and the gag overplays that nicely. As seen in his opening scene - the weasel hides behind the coop and peeks his head back and forth at different positions. Then he quietly hides at different spots like a fencepost, dustbin, and a tarnished stove.\n\nFinally he returns to the coop he had already started and steals the hatching egg. It's a funny, colourful scene that gives his personality too much paranoia and suspicion.\n\nChuck Jones' timing and John McGrew's layout mechanics are a perfect blend altogether; as Jones has to time the weasel's peaking here and there briskly in accordance to McGrew's complex staging.\n\nIt would seem unethical for the reviewer to completely overlook the forward-looking art direction of McGrew's layouts underneath Jones' vision. A common analysis for a Jones-McGrew cartoon of the era; each short they worked on is always unique from the other - by not following the standard \"classic\" formula often associated with other studios.\n\nFor Flop, McGrew gives the backgrounds a non-traditional, slanted view which is used creatively in animation rather than just a decorative function. Perhaps the most striking of McGrew and Fleury's work in the short is the scene of the weasel attempting to trap the chicken in the basement.\n\nThere is a strong emphasis of low-key lighting and silhouette which works effectively and perhaps an attribute to the lighting style of live-action features of the era. As the baby chick is hiding inside a lightbulb, the weasel attempts to reach after him by foolishly placing his hand inside the socket - creating an effective, bold electric shock which is prosperous in colour and outcome.\n\nChuck's explorative ways of advancing comic timing is put to good use for throwback gags. A golden oldie, the baby chick gives the weasel a hot-foot when the weasel attempts to sabotage a hide and seek game - which results in him to reacting hysterically. Chuck makes the reaction more advanced - as the weasel shoots up like a rocket and runs around the house in a very complex layout setup.\n\nA very courageous move from Johnny Burton's camera department who nail the camera mechanics - up to the finishing close-up of the weasel's foot. Alas, Chuck nails the expressions of the weasel's easing face as his foot is resting in a bucket used \"in case of hot foot only\".\n\nOther times in the short, Chuck's experimenting doesn't quite meet great results. A striking example occurs in the sequence of the weasel hiding behind a wall, waiting for an unsuspecting chick to be smashed by a cleaver. Unbeknownst to the weasel, the chick is standing on the shelf and strikes him with a mallet.\n\nFor the gag; Jones channels a little of Frank Tashlin as the anticipation and the weasel's collapse occurs in five separate shots lasting a total of five seconds. It's an imaginative effort but Chuck's timing is a tad sloppy as the rapid-pacing feels sluggish and forced.\n\nAs far as writing and story goes; it's a great showcase of the struggle for identity - a regular formula from the Schlesinger staff. As the baby chick is newly hatched, he immediately mistakes the weasel as his mother - delaying his chance to eat the chick.\n\nThe weasel responds: \"Ain't that touchin'? The kid thinks I'm his mother. It kinda gets you here\", and then reveals his true colours: \"Too bad I'm so fond of, um, chickens.\" The role-play is extended as the weasel disguises himself as a \"mammy\" by wearing a kerchief. Here, the embracement of the stereotype is used cleverly.\n\nMel Blanc exceeds in both performances; as he nails the inquisitive chick who asks: \"What is we mammy?\" and impersonates several animal noises; while also giving the weasel some added character with the Southern falsetto. Blanc's range and ability at cartoon acting gives the weasel two different voices (his own - and the falsetto) which really gives it a personality of its own.\n\nHis quick wits are put to great use when he swiftly tricks the baby into thinking he's a weasel. He manipulates him into believing he's seeing a reflection of himself from a infant photo of the weasel; and places the sailor hat to add the right touches. As a result of being \"Blue Ribboned\" in recent years; it's a pity there is no available information on the short's writer...who develops the characterisations and role-play of the weasel so creatively. To hazard a guess, it's most likely Ted Pierce (Chuck's regular writer then), or perhaps Michael Maltese - who would sporadically write a short for Chuck before becoming his principal story man in the late 40s.\n\nWithout doubt - the most fulfilling and executed sequence in the short is centered on the weasel's violent sneezing. The weasel foolishly tosses pepper across the room to distract the chick, who as a result accidentally turns on a fan - causing the pepper to ricochet and land on the weasel's face. This results with an abundance of violent sneezing completed with a string of visual gags.\n\nThe visual gags are very innovative and hysterical in delivery - it's a sample of how capable Chuck Jones could be in pulling off far-out gags which is otherwise out of his usual tastes. He takes complete advantage of his comic timing gift to make particular gags have great effect.\n\nJones pulls this off beautifully in the teapot scene. The weasel has his head caught inside a teapot; and builds up to another violent sneeze. as a result: the teapot reacts violently from the sneeze and spikes upwards, in the shape of a crown.\n\nThe gag is built up further as the weasel's sneeze causes him to crash several objects like a stove and a rug - and rolls out dressed like a king sitting on a throne. As inventive and outrageous the gags are - the sneezing fits get carried away as it clocks in for almost two minutes. It builds up from gag to gag making the action feel anti-climatic and choppy in pacing. The chick's mistake for the pepper as smelling salts however, has a hilarious delivery to it gag-wise.\n\nA couple of wartime references in the short which are worth the mention. A gag which can go completely oblivious to a contemporary viewer is centred at the weasel's kitchen. The weasel sings the recipes as seen in a close-up of the list. One of the recipe lists \"an ounce of sugar\" which the weasel hesitates at the indication of sugar on the paper.\n\nThe weasel abruptly pauses, and then sighs \"Oh well\" as he carries on with the recipe. A very dated gag by today's standards; sugar was rationed during World War II, which is what's hinted in the subtle delivery of the off-screen weasel.\n\nAt the climax of the short - the weasel is defeated while suffocating in a wringer washer. To admit defeat, he holds a white flag to show his surrender - as evidently written. It's possibly a subtle indication of the audience's desires for peace from their enemies during the war.\n\nAnimation by Bobe Cannon.\n\nBack home safe to his mother, he recounts the story on how he outsmarted the weasel. \"But ah fooled him mammy, ah fooled him good!\", the chick boasts. The mother cuts in, responding skeptically of his story: \"Tellin' such big lies!\". The chick insists he's telling the truth, with an injured weasel stepping in to back him up, in the hilarious closing lines: \"He ain't just whistlin' Dixie, mammy!\". Animator Bobe Cannon adds to the right touches with some exaggerated animation poses of the weasel's anticipated sneeze fit; which wouldn't likely appear under Chuck Jones' direction and character layouts.\n\nFlop Goes the Weasel is a great representation of some of Chuck Jones' underrated works. The stereotypes are a possible factor to why the short hasn't been released to home media as well as being rarely seen in general. Despite the stereotypes outdating the short; there are still great elements altogether. The weasel shows a lot of entertainment and personality under one roof; and the newly-born chick's innocent nature creates a great foreshadowing of the weasel's fate. Chuck Jones completely went to town as far as experimenting with layouts and comedic timing goes: which is altogether a mixed blessing. The sneezing fits itself is a great example. Whilst the gags are very creative and full of energy; it is slightly padded to add up its running time.\n\nRating: 3/5.\n\n↧\n\n399. Hop and Go (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 398.\n\nRelease date: March 27, 1943.\n\nSeries: Looney Tunes.\n\nSupervision: Norm McCabe.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Pinto Colvig (Claude Hopper), Mel Blanc (Scottish Rabbits).\n\nStory: Melvin Millar, Don Christensen (unc.)\n\nAnimation: Cal Dalton.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Two Scottish rabbits attempt to challenge Claude Hopper's statement as the greatest hopper in the world - even going so far as to cheat.\n\nNorm McCabe rarely had the opportunity to develop a personal style like Chuck Jones or Bob Clampett; as he was typically lumbered with war-themed shorts. However, McCabe's take on a one-shot cartoon with a plot not heavily reliant on wartime references states his potential.\n\nMillar and Don Christenen's story is in the same vein of a standard Warner Bros. short: a dim-witted kangaroo named Claude Hopper boasts about being \"the best darn hopper in the whole world\"; and two eavesdropping Scottish rabbits decide to use him for their own amusement.\n\nThe opening sequence indicates no sign of McCabe's lowering standards. For example an impressive camera shot features the camera hopping in rhythm to Claude's hopping action - an effect used similarly in Friz Freleng's Hop, Skip and a Chump.\n\nCarl Stalling composes a little hopping rhythm which gives some added personality on Claude, and of course, Pinto Colvig's singing voice in the persona of Goofy is always entertaining to hear. The layouts on the opening shot and Claude Hopper hopping in perspective indicate Dave Hilberman's enjoyment of problem solving on complex layout work.\n\nCharacterisations and personas are also typical in the spirit of Warner Bros. in this short. Claude Hopper is portrayed as ignorant based on his heavy size and Pinto Colvig's Goofy persona. There's also a subtle reference of Colvig, too.\n\nClaude brags to the rabbits about his hopping by declaring, \"I've got a certificate to prove it\", with the certificate reading \"This guy is a goof\" - a possible reference to Colvig known as the original voice actor for Disney's Goofy.\n\nThe Scottish rabbits, on the other hand are depicted as much smaller and slender in size - adding some craftiness to their low cunning. Mel Blanc is always reliable for giving some added personality (like the Scottish dialect on the rabbits) to characters who are portrayed as conniving, if nothing else.\n\nTheir contrasting size and personalities are put to good use in a sequence involving Claude Hopper's attempts of accomplishing the longest jump. As Claude leaps; the rabbits are hanging onto the end of his tail. Once Hopper lands, they leap from his tail and land on the ground in front of him. So, the rabbits take advantage of his gullibility by measuring the other rabbit in front - deceiving Claude into thinking he's been narrowly beaten.\n\nAstonished, Claude attempts the jump once more but finds he's landed in the exact position as before. In an attempt to break the record one last time; Claude empties various heavy objects from his pouch to reduce the weight. The scottish rabbit takes his chance by placing a piece of bubble gum underneath Claude's tail.\n\nMcCabe's comic timing plays along nicely by giving impact and weight to the strength of the gum. Treg Brown's resourceful sound effects add to the right touch, also. Falling back from the stretchiness of the gum; Claude falls backwards and crashes onto a pile of junk that had fallen from his pouch - once again, outsmarted by the rabbits.\n\nAt the same time, Norm McCabe continues to fulfil his potential as a director - by using dynamics and uncommon styles of pacing and shot angles for sequences requiring it. Dave Hilberman's layouts are better appreciated in scenes involving Claude hopping on the branch of the tree, and landing backwards on a birds nest - resulting in the birth of a baby bird screeching \"Mammy!\" to Claude.\n\nMcCabe's use of dynamics are most revealing in the sequence where the rabbits attempt to loosen a giant boulder. The boulder is intended to land at one end of a log - in hope for Claude to have a grand leap.\n\nNot only are the great compositional shots effective but also appropriate in its visual storytelling. For the scenes of the boulder falling - McCabe channels a little of Chuck Jones from this era (see My Favourite Duck and Flop Goes the Weasel).\n\nThe falling boulder is witnessed by each character with the aid of rapid pacing and several quick shots to make the anticipation gag more effective and dynamic. A daring feat to accomplish, McCabe's timing proves competent as he navigates through Hilberman's layouts wisely and effectively.\n\nThe boxing match sequence is another example of depicting both character personalities and use of creative pacing, as analysed earlier. Although the payoff itself is a little weak in creativity and execution.\n\nThe rabbits speed past Claude, creating him dizzy spells. Out of nowhere, one of the rabbits pulls out a fighting canvas effortlessly. This is also an occurrence with Claude's \"goof\" certificate.\n\nClaude's bragging and boasting continues to do no favours as he considers himself an athlete. A taste of cartoon logic is taken for granted as one of the rabbits unexpectedly pulls out a switch from the fighting pole - causing one of the ropes to arise; causing Claude to spin around the rope in the style of an acrobat. The execution feels a little weak as the sudden appearance of a switch seems to not depict the rabbit's slyness as seen in the long jump sequence which follows after.\n\nSome gags use some cliches typical of the Warner Bros. style of humour. This is evident in the sequence of Claude Hopper after being rescued from his collision with a tunnel.\n\nHe is brought back from the river, where one rabbit uses his tail like a hand pump; while the other rabbit rinses himself (with the dripping water coming from Claude's soaked hair) whilst singing Singin' in the Bathtub - a popular song choice whenever a character showers or bathes. The scene of the principal rabbit washing his hands on the water's pouch like a sink is a decent visual gag itself; and the unexpected delivery of the rabbit pulling the plug out for the water to fade is hilarious itself.\n\nLike many McCabe shorts; the finale sequence is heavy on war-related references. Although some of the gags have aged overtime; some of the visual effects work still hold up well. Claude has begun his long continuous leap and on the way he encounters several war planes, as well as references to food rations - like the bizarre \"price ceiling\" pun.\n\nMcCabe completely manipulates time and length of his leap as the sequence cross-dissolves into nighttime. The colour styling and tone of a silhouetted Claude beneath a night sky is incredibly stunning and rich in style. As Claude strikes a match - the light reflections on Claude enhances the quality.\n\nClaude encounters a calamity as beam lights flash right at him; as an unseen enemy targets and attempts to fire ammunition at him. A silly, funny little gag in the style of Avery or Clampett occurs in between as Claude attempts to shout, but to no avail due to the loudness of the firing. Then, he bellows: \"Sorta noisy, ain't it?\" as the firing halts momentarily.\n\nUnaware that he is carrying a box of dynamite the rabbits planted underneath his pouch - he panics as he begins to lower at the ground. And so, Claude successfully hops out of sight as the box of dynamite detonates - creating mass destruction of the site.\n\nAs the smoke unveils - a smug Claude remarks, \"Well folks, I guess we know who's champeen now!\". In the following long shot; it's revealed that Claude placed the dynamite in the city of Tokyo - making him a hero for unintentionally causing destruction for the enemy. Without doubt, a hysterical ending for war-time audiences and film enthusiasts although the gag would date very quickly once the Japanese surrendered only two years - making the ending seem out of plate for contemporary standards.\n\nA good change from Norm McCabe's usual war-related plots - although Hop and Go only contains some good elements in vein of the definitive Warner Bros. humour. Although the characters are stock personalities - they work well enough to create elaborate, dynamic sequences like the boulder and Claude's enormous leap finale. McCabe continues to expand and search for his personal style. It's a real pity this became McCabe's second to last short for Warners; diminishing his chance of being in the spotlight of other Warner stalwarts like Freleng or Jones. Despite such elements, McCabe's use of war-time references have dated the short and making the short underrated.\n\nRating: 3/5.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n400. Super-Rabbit (1943)\n\nwith BUGS BUNNY\n\nWarner cartoon no. 399.\n\nRelease date: April 3, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Chuck Jones.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny / Cottontail Smith / Various voices), Kent Rogers (Professor Canafrazz), Ted Pierce (2nd observer).\n\nStory: Ted Pierce.\n\nAnimation: Ken Harris.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Bugs Bunny develops superpowers and goes on a mission to challenge Cottontail Smith - a cowboy who despises rabbits.\n\nAnimation by Ben Washam\n\nIn the early 1940s, the Superman franchise (who debuted in Action Comics #1, 1938) had become incredibly popular - even so, that the Schlesinger Studio leapt at the chance of producing a parody of their own. Due to Chuck Jones' success of his Rover Boys parody a year earlier - he becomes an obvious candidate to conceive a Superman take-off.\n\nThe franchise had also been very popular on radio, as well as a series of animated shorts produced by the Fleischer Studios - which is arguably their most elaborate work. The shorts were popular enough that their opening montage sequence for each short were directly spoofed shot-by-shot in Jones' parody.\n\nA still from the Superman series -\n\nseen at the opening of each short\n\nfrom 1941 and 1942.\n\nIts infamous opening narration which establishes Superman goes: \"Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!\" were presented in a montage form in the Fleischer shorts.\n\nHowever, Jones and Ted Pierce visually lampoon the opening with their Warner Bros. style - to some extent they channel the same level of humour Tex Avery used for his late 1930s shorts.\n\nInstead of a dry-brushed bullet zipping past the screen; a cork gun is replaced. A streamlined locomotive in the Fleischer short is replaced with a fatigued steam train - a visual contradiction the \"faster than a locomotive\" statement. Finally, the leap to the highest building gag is topped - with Bugs accidentally trips his foot on the pointy top of the skyscraper, causing him to fall.\n\nTo make the parody more conspicuous; John McGrew sticks to a similar style to the Fleischer shorts in order to take advantage of Jones' direct parody on the montage. Alas, Bugs Bunny channeling the iconic Clark Kent/Superman image has a nice touch to it - as Bugs retains his own personality while still posing as a superhero. He is partly animated in the scene as his legs are held while he munches his carrot.\n\nTed Pierce also conceives certain gags directly spoofing recurring elements in Superman. Once Bugs Bunny reads a cut-out newspaper article of Texan cowboy Cottontail Smith's plan to eradicate all rabbits in the laboratory; he declares: \"This looks like the job, for Super-Rabbit!\".\n\nHe hops into a booth to change into his costume but finds himself dressed as the wrong alter-ego - as Bo Peep. Bugs quickly returns to the booth and comes back with the correct superhero costume. A nicely executed gag by Pierce full of spontaneity while maintaining Bugs' characteristics of being in drag.\n\nAnimation by Ken Harris\n\nThe seq"
