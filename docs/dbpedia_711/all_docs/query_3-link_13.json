        "text": "In April 1943, Film Daily announced that due to World War II, Leon Schlesinger and Warner Bros. were to re-release previously produced color cartoons to theaters; both to save costs and because Schlesinger was under contract to release 39 reels annually. The printing of these reissues (dubbed \"Blue Ribbon\" prints from their content) came with the cost of cutting the original main titles from not only the negatives but most other studio masters as well. With the trimming of the titles also came the cutting of credits, leaving several directors, animators, and artists robbed of their proper credit for nearly 80 years. Furthermore, the original opening cues from Norman Spencer and Carl Stalling were also lost in the process.[1]\n\nNot only is recovering these elements important in figuring out just who did what, but it’s also a critical issue in regard to seeing these films the true way they were intended.\n\nSome directors (like Tex Avery) often did gags and unique animation (such as a book opening) in the beginning and end titles. Because of these reissues, several of these unique and clever sequences may be lost to time. Sometimes, reissues would also cut out scenes from a cartoon, such as a tobacco-based gag from \"Farm Frolics\", or many dated gags from \"You're An Education\".\n\nIn 1956, due to further budget cuts, new reissues would keep their main titles and credits, with only the color rings being replaced (the sole exception being \"The Ducksters\")\n\nSeveral reissues in the '60s did not alter the title sequences whatsoever.\n\nThe original opening cues for many of the cut titles are known, courtesy of Danial Goldmark.[2]\n\nReissues which cut the credits (1943-1956)\n\nOriginal release Film
