I think he tries to eat Bugs Bunny, but I can't remember.\n\nSmunkeeville\n\nare you talking about the weird monster guy (http://www.inetres.com/gp/anime/bb/bb_hrh05.jpg)in the old bugs bunny cartoons?\n\nif so his name is Gossamer\n\nJenrak\n\nHe's a big hairy furball. Nothing else.\n\n[NS]Bazalonia\n\nThe only thing that I can think of is the creature when MArvin the MArtian steals Bug's and theres that creature says \"I'm going to hug him, and squeeze him and call him George.\"\n\n... Unfortunatley that's all the help I can give\n\nPensychylvania\n\nHis original name was Rudolph - it was changed later on, in the late 70's or so, to Gossamer.\n\nHe appeared with Bugs Bunny in two theatrical cartoons - \"Hair Raising Hare\" (1946) and \"Water, Water Every Hare\" (1952). Both directed by Chuck Jones. He appeared with his new name, Gossamer, in 1980 with a cartoon called \"Duck Dodgers and the Return of the 24th 1/2 Century\" which was part of a TV special - also directed by Jones.\n\nSmunkeeville\n\nHis original name was Rudolph - it was changed later on, in the late 70's or so, to Gossamer.\n\nHe appeared with Bugs Bunny in two theatrical cartoons - \"Hair Raising Hare\" (1946) and \"Water, Water Every Hare\" (1952).

One person's obscure notion is another person's area of study.\n\nNew Stalinberg\n\nwikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossamer_(Looney_Tunes)) much?\n\nforgive me for not knowing the \"original\" name, I was born in 1981, so I didn't really watch cartoons before that........go figure.\n\nThat means your 9 years older then me which makes you...\n\n24-25!!!\n\nUpwardThrust\n\nwikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossamer_(Looney_Tunes)) much?\n\nforgive me for not knowing the \"original\" name, I was born in 1981, so I didn't really watch cartoons before that........go figure.\n\nwow you only got 2 years on me (83 jan) I always pictured you as older\n\nPensychylvania\n\nwikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossamer_(Looney_Tunes)) much?\n\nforgive me for not knowing the \"original\" name, I was born in 1981, so I didn't really watch cartoons before that........go figure.\n\nI got the cartoon dates from \"Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons\" by Jerry Beck and Will Friedwald. It's a very handy book with plot descriptions and credits for every WB cartoon made through the late 80's.\n\nAnd I watch a lot of cartoons:D\n\nSmunkeeville\n\nI got the cartoon dates from \"Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros.

Sorry about that, I was stressed out last night, and I thought \"wow, I know the answer I am going to look so smart\" and then you come along with a better answer (even though mine was still right-ish) and I was like \"now, I don't look smart\"\n\nUpwardThrust- Yes, I am only 24, I get the \"I pictured you older\" thing a lot, I have no clue why. IRL people see me and assume 19-20, but once they get to know me they think I am about 35, more than once I have had to show my ID to prove I wasn't in my mid-thirties.\n\nMurderous maniacs\n\nUpwardThrust- Yes, I am only 24, I get the \"I pictured you older\" thing a lot, I have no clue why.

By the time I turned 18 and was old enough to \"bar hop\" I was too mature to want to go. I met my husband, and he was what I wanted so we went on about 4 dates and got married. Everyone said \"you are too young, it won't last 6 months\", 5 years later they still think I am going to get bored or something :rolleyes:\n\nMurderous maniacs\n\nI think I was forced to \"grow up\" too fast, I had my own apartment, and a full time job by 16.

You mean I saw that movie when I was 4? O_O\n\nMaineiacs\n\nwow you only got 2 years on me (83 jan) I always pictured you as older\n\nAnd I've got 14 years on her.
