        "text": "No philosophy, sadly, has all the answers. No matter how assured\n\nwe may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful\n\ninconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions. This is true in religion\n\nas it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the\n\nna√Øve.\n\nAs for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be\n\nadvised to leave them to heaven. They will not, unfortunately, do us the\n\nsame courtesy. They attack us and each other, and whatever their\n\nprotestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear\n\nthat they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.\n\nMy own belief in God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not\n\nknowledge. My respect for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems\n\nto have been the most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth. But even\n\nwell-educated Christians are frustated in their thirst for certainty about\n\nthe beloved figure of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the\n\nscriptural record. Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics,\n\nbut every recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it. Some\n\nChristians, alas, resort to formal lying to obscure such reality.\n\n--Steve Allen [Stephen Valentine Patrick William Allen](1921-2000)\n\n\"The Courage of Conviction\", in But Seriously . . .: Steve\n\nAllen Speaks His Mind. Buffalo NY: Prometheus Books, 1996, p.114\n\n(essay originally appeared in Phillip L. Berman [Editor]. The Courage of\n\nConviction. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1985)\n\nWhen A Father Prays (full text)\n\nBuild me a son, oh, Lord, who will be strong enough to know when he is\n\nweak and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid. One who will be\n\nproud and unbending in defeat but humble and gentle in victory.\n\nA son whose wishbone will not be where his backbone should be; a son who\n\nwill know that to know himself, is the foundation stone of all true knowledge.\n\nRear him, I pray, not in the paths of ease and comfort but under the\n\nstress and spur of difficulties and challenges. Here let him learn\n\nto stand up in the storm; here let him learn compassion for those who fail.\n\nBuild me a son whose heart will be clean, whose goal will be high.\n\nA son who will master himself before he seeks to master other men.\n\nOne who will learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep. One who will\n\nreach into the future, yet never forget the past.\n\nAnd after all these are his, add, I pray, enough of a sense of\n\nhumor so that he may always be serious, yet never take himself too\n\nseriously; a touch of humility, so that he may always remember the\n\nsimplicity of true greatness; the open mind of true wisdom;\n\nthe meekness of true strength.\n\nThen, I, his father, will dare in the sacred recesses of my own heart\n\nto whisper, \"I have not lived in vain\".\n\n--Anonymous\n\nas published in Anthony Wons, Editor. Tony's Scrap Book: 1932-33 Edition.\n\nChicago: Reilly & Lee Company, 1932, p.45\n\nusually credited to Gen. Douglas MacArthur (1880-1964) as a prayer\n\nwritten for his son, Arthur IV; MacArthur often quoted it in his speeches,\n\nincluding a famous one on 12 May 1962, when he addressed the corps of\n\ncadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York,\n\na speech in which he modified the \"Prayer\" to describe the\n\nattributes of the ideal soldier\n\n(keytlaw.com/f-4/general-macarthurs-duty-honor-country-speech/)\n\nIf I were a child of about eight years old, at dinner tonight\n\nI would report to my family, \"Our new teacher is so pretty!\n\nShe let me hand out the papers today\". If my new teacher\n\nwas a composite of all the young men, I should report to\n\nmy family, \"Our new music teacher is nice!\n\nHe had on a red tie today!\"\n\nOn such foundations would my judgment be made -- almost\n\nentirely on appearance and personality because, being\n\nso young, it would never occur to me that my pretty teacher\n\nor nice man also had to be proficient, and that\n\nmy future growth depended almost entirely on how\n\nseriously they regarded their responsibilities or how\n\nthoroughly they planned for me. No, if I thought of it at\n\nall, I would be certain that they know everything that they\n\nneed to know -- and even more! I would be confident they\n\nwould do everything for me that needed to be done. You\n\nsee, I am eight years old, and grown up people never\n\ncheat little children.\n\nIf I were a teen-ager in junior high school, I would take\n\na long, quiet look at you. You are neither women teachers\n\nor men teachers. You are just teachers.\n\nI would call my crowd together and in a tone of real concern\n\nwarn them, \"Could be we're headed for trouble. We gotta\n\nstick together\". And how surprised I would be to find that\n\non the very first day you disarmed me so completely!\n\nYou kept me so busy! Your poise, your charm, your\n\ndignity, your tremendous ability -- your quiet assurance,\n\nyour control of the situation, your infectious\n\ngood humor -- I forgot you were supposed to be my enemy.\n\nI did not recognize your weapons because my own weapons\n\nhave always been so different.\n\nIf I were a teen-ager in senior high school, I would level my\n\nlook at you with my head held high. I can wait. Since\n\nyou are only a very few years older than I, it could be\n\nthat you are not really much more competent. If you can prove\n\nyour ability so completely that I cannot ignore it, I shall\n\ngive you my allegiance -- every ounce of it! If I do not\n\nrecognize my progress, or the progress of the organization\n\nwhich you direct, I can ignore you completely,\n\nand my life will be just as happy without you.\n\nIf I m a boy, I may even flirt with you, kid you along.\n\nIf I am a girl, I may bedevil you by making mooneyes\n\nat you! But whatever I am, and however I behave, you really\n\nmatter to me only when you have commanded my respect for\n\nyour leadership and your adulthood! When this has\n\nhappened, I shall elevate you to the rank of an idol, and I\n\nbeg you not to betray my action. Will you, please, not have\n\nfeet of clay.\n\nI shall adhere to your tastes wholeheartedly in whatever you\n\ngive me to do. Your judgment will be superior to that of\n\nany other, even to that of my parents. I shall remember\n\nyou through all of my life because you have provided my first\n\nreal experience of aesthetic exaltation -- my first realization\n\nthat there is something in the world much bigger than I have ever\n\nknown, and because you have opened up this world to me -- a\n\nworld of beauty, of taste, of discrimination, of tremendous\n\nsatisfaction -- because you have thus turned me toward the\n\nway of emotional maturity, I shall never forget you.\n\n--Oleta Albertson Benn (1904-1991)\n\nspeaking to a convention of new music teachers in 1954\n\n(references to music edited)\n\nGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day.\n\nShow him how to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\n\nvariants:\n\nGive a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day.\n\nGive a man a religion, and he'll starve to death while praying for a fish.\n\nGive a man a fish, and you feed him for a day.

Within the walls of our\n\nclassrooms we will weave threads of knowledge into the pattern\n\nof our destinies. From deep within us we will forge the faith\n\nthat may someday shine with beauty and usefulness in the darkened\n\nbyways of time.\n\nBecause of the skill that we capture now, a train, a ship, an airliner\n\nmay come into being and reach safe harbor guided by hands grown strong.\n\nThere are bridges to build, and we will build them. There are homes\n\nto make, and we will light their windows. There are those who suffer,\n\nand we will ease their sorrow. There is a God to find, and we will\n\nseek Him with all the power of our hearts and minds.\n\nLike the seedling that finds root in the wind and rain, we will grow\n\nsturdy until our arms reach out into the skies.\n\nWe are the men of tomorrow.\n\n--Lt. Wilfrid Dellquest\n\nMt Lowe Military Academy, Altadena, California\n\n\"Boys' Creed\" was copyrighted on 22 December 1944,\n\nrenewed 22 January 1972\n\nIf one inquires why the American tradition is so strong against any\n\nconnection of State and Church, why it dreads even the rudiments of\n\nreligious teaching in state-maintained schools, the immediate and\n\nsuperficial answer is not far to seek. . . . The cause lay largely in\n\nthe diversity and vitality of the various denominations, each fairly\n\nsure that, with a fair field and no favor, it could make its own way;\n\nand each animated by a jealous fear that, if any connection of State\n\nand Church were permitted, some rival denomination would get an\n\nunfair advantage. . . .\n\nAlready the spirit of our schooling is permeated with the feeling that\n\nevery subject, every topic, every fact, every professed truth must be\n\nsubmitted to a certain publicity and impartiality. All proffered\n\nsamples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to\n\ncommon tests. It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that\n\nany such \"show-down\" is sacrilegious and perverse. The characteristic\n\nof religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually\n\nsecret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;\n\nauthoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary\n\nways. . . . It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is\n\nconceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,\n\nthere is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in\n\nreligion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics\n\nwhere the method of free inquiry has made its way. The \"religious\"\n\nwould be the last to be willing that either the history or the\n\ncontent of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those\n\nto whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,\n\nbut is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against\n\nits being taught in any other spirit.\n\n--John Dewey (1859-1953)\n\n\"Religion in Our Schools\", Hibbert Journal Number 6, 1908,\n\npp.796-809; often reprinted\n\nA Parent's Prayer\n\nI pray that I may let my child live his own life,\n\nand not the one I wish I had lived. Therefore,\n\nguard me against burdening him with doing what\n\nI failed to do.\n\nHelp me to see his missteps today in perspective\n\nagainst the long road he must go, and grant me\n\nthe grace of patience with his slow pace.\n\nGive me the wisdom of knowing when to smile\n\nat the small mischiefs of his age and when to\n\ngive him the haven of firmness against the impulses\n\nwhich he fears and cannot master.\n\nHelp me to hear the anguish in his heart through\n\nthe din of angry words or across the gulf of\n\nbrooding silence, and having heard, give me the\n\ngrace to bridge the gap between us with\n\nunderstanding warmth.\n\nI pray that I may raise my voice more in joy at\n\nwhat he is, than vexation at what he has done; so\n\nthat each day he may grow in sureness of himself.\n\nHelp me to hold him with a warmth that will give\n\nhim friendliness toward others; then give me\n\nthe fortitude to free him to go strongly on his way.\n\n--Dr Marion B. Durfee (fl. mid-XXth century)\n\npublished in part in Saturday Evening Post, Volume 244 Issue 3, September 1972, p.137\n\nmany variations of this \"Prayer\" can be found on the Web,\n\nthough there seems to be no definitive, original version available;\n\nauthor was medical director of the Pasadena (California) Child Guidance\n\nClinic from the late 1940s to the early 1960s\n\nDesiderata\n\nGo placidly amidst the noise and haste, and remember what peace\n\nthere may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender\n\nbe on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and\n\nclearly; and listen to others, even the dull and the ignorant;\n\nthey too have their story.\n\nAvoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexatious to the spirit.\n\nIf you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter;\n\nfor always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.\n\nEnjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in\n\nyour own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the\n\nchanging fortunes of time.\n\nExercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full\n\nof trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many\n\npersons strive for high ideals; and everywhere life is full of heroism.\n\nBe yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical\n\nabout love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is\n\nas perennial as the grass.\n\nTake kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the\n\nthings of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden\n\nmisfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.\n\nMany fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.\n\nBeyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a\n\nchild of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars;\n\nyou have a right to be here.\n\nAnd whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is\n\nunfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you\n\nconceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the\n\nnoisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its shams,\n\ndrudgery, and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.\n\nBe cheerful. Strive to be happy.\n\n--Max Ehrmann (1872-1945)\n\nwritten in 1927, published posthumously in The Poems of Max Ehrmann.\n\nBoston: Bruce Humphries Publishing Company, 1948\n\nwidely believed to have been written in 1692, the date of the founding of\n\nOld St Paul's Church in Baltimore, since the church's rector (1956-1961),\n\nthe Rev.

New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1923, pp.17-18\n\nMyself\n\nI have to live with myself and so\n\nI want to be fit for myself to know.\n\nI want to be able as days go by,\n\nAlways to look myself straight in the eye.\n\nI don't want to stand with the setting sun\n\nAnd hate myself for the things I've done.\n\nI don't want to keep on a closet shelf\n\nA lot of secrets about myself\n\nAnd fool myself as I come and go\n\nInto thinking that nobody else will know\n\nThe kind of man I really am,\n\nI don't want to dress myself in a sham.\n\nI want to go out with my head erect\n\nI want to deserve all men's respect;\n\nBut here in the struggle for fame and pelf\n\nI want to be able to like myself.\n\nI don't want to look at myself and know\n\nThat I'm bluster and bluff and empty show.\n\nI never can hide myself from me;\n\nI see what others may never see;\n\nI know what others may never know,\n\nI never can fool myself and so,\n\nWhatever happens I want to be\n\nSelf-respecting and conscience free.\n\n--Edgar A.
