They accomplished those goals, but at the same time planted the seeds for a longrunning series of animated films which would delight the entire world, creating a menagerie of characters that would surpass Disney's in popularity and win six Academy Awards. Animated cartoons had always been a popular part of the complete movie program,but never more so than in the early days of sound motion pictures. Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse had caused a sensation. A moving cartoon with synchronized music and funny sound effects was pure magic to the depression-era audiences of the late 1920s. Warner Bros., having made sound movies popular with The Jazz Singer, saw a good thing when producer Leon Schlesinger brought the first all \"talk-ink\" cartoon character to them. Ex-Disney animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising had created a pilot film featuring their speaking character,a black boy named Bosko. The test film wasjust that, all talk. Warner Bros, suggested they make the character less ethnic, more like Mickey Mouse,and more musical,incorporating popular songs from the studio's new feature musicals. With that,Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies were born. And though the road was a bit bumpy in the 1930s, the films eventually settled into a style which nurtured many top animation talents (Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones,Tex Avery,Bob Clampett, Frank Tashlin,Bob McKimson,etc.)and created many superstars (including Bugs Bunny,Daffy Duck,Porky Pig,and the Road Runner)and\n\nhundreds of lesser lights(Egghead,Charlie Dog,Marvin Martian,et ^). Most importantly,the studio created an attitude in animated films. From the late Thirties onward,there was only one kind of Warner Bros, cartoon—/unny ones. Disney may have had the beauty and polish, but Warners had the laughs. A sense of humor in writing and drawing,even in the music and sound effects was the bottom line goal. More often than not, that was the result\n\nIt was also the key to their popularity. Leon Schlesinger was not interested in the little details of cartoon production, but the overall product,and his philosophy was humor.\"The public still likes to laugh and the cartoon is still the perfect meduim for comedy,\" Schlesinger said in 1940.\"Our policy has always been laughs—the more the better.\" Schlesinger didn't care what his boys came up with,as long as there were plenty ofjokes in it Sadly,the cartoons produced by this studio between 1940 and I960 represent a situation which may never occur again:a group of zany artists given total freedom to make funny cartoons and invent funny characters— with complete access to the talents and facilities of a major motion picture studio. The studio produced cartoons because there was a market for them,and because they needed product for their new theaters. This was a time when the general public regarded animated cartoons as they did newspaper comic strips—good clean fun for all ages. And when unique talents behind the screen—writers,artists,and musicians—cared about making good funny films and dared to push this medium to extremes. Carl Stalling,the musical director from 1936 onward, was invaluable. Formerly with Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks,and before that a Kansas City theater organist. Stalling took the scoring of each cartoon as seriously\n\nas he had a Buster Keaton two-reeler or a Tom Mix western. And where would Warner cartoons be without its ensemble cast of voice\n\nactors. Led by Mel Blanc,the one man responsible for the majority of starring character voices(Bugs Bunny,Daffy Duck,Porky Pig,and more) and joined by Arthur Q. Bryan (Elmer Fudd),Stan Freberg (Junior Bear, Pete Puma)Bea Benaderet,Daws Butler,June Foray, and others—this talented troupe gave these cartoons a unique sound and fury. Of the muny great art talents—including layout and background artists, effects and character animators—there are five directors who deserve\n\nspecial mention:five different styles,five different approaches,five who set the standard we have come to expectfrom a Warner cartoon. TexAvery brought the satirical edge to Warner cartoons in the late 1930s and experimented with new screwball characters seen in such cartoons as Porky's Duck Hunt and A Wild Hare and stretched the cartoon boundaries with films such as Page Miss Glory and Porky's Preview. Robert Clampett defined the personality of Porky Pig,created Tweety,and found animators to create animation as funny as the jokes they were trying to tell, especially in films as great as Book Revue and Coal Black.Friz Freleng masterfully combined music and humor in such cartoons as Back Alley Oproar and The Three Little Bops,and created Yosemite Sam as well as masterpieces like You Ought to Be in Pictures and Tweety Pie. Frank Tashlin brought a live action director's sense of perspective to the Looney Tunes universe,a frantic energy in cartoons including Porky's Romance, Porky's Pig Feat,and Stupid Cupid. Chuck Jones experimented with stylized art, backgrounds,and movement and created characters like Pepe Le Pew,the Road Runner,Wile E. Coyote,Inki, Marvin Martian, Charlie Dog,and the Three Bears,and acknowledged classic cartoons such as What's Opera,Doc?,One Froggy Evening,and Duck Dodgers in the 24V2 Century,to name but a few.\n\nAbout this filmography:Yes, we have watched every cartoon listed in this book—and it has been a labor of love. Our biggest problem was obtaining all the screen credits, a chore made difficult by the old Warner Bros, policy\n\nof reissuing earlier cartoons and replacing the original credits with a new \"Blue Ribbon\" main title. For example,eilmost all prints of the Looney Tune Book Reuue(1946)that exist today are \"Blue Ribbon\" prints—which call the film a \"Merrie Melodie,\" list no credits, and misspell the title as Book Review. We found a print with original titles at the UCLA Film\n\nArchive in Hollywood and thanks to the University are able to provide the credits for this film and many others(but not all). By the way,the \"Blue Ribbon\" reissue print also removed the Porky Pig \"That's all.\n\nFolks\" end tag as well. If credits are missing from an entry,then it was nowhere to be found.\n\nThe credits that.are listed here have been standardized. For example,\n\nCarl Stalling's credit on the cartoons varied from Musical Supervision to Musical Direction to just plain Music; we've listed him under \"Musical Direction.\" Robert Clampett has been billed as Bob Clampett,FYank\n\nTashlin occasionally used the name \"Tish Tash.\" We have tried to remain true to the on-screen titles, but some standardization was necessary for convenience.\n\nMany cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s contain characters and situations which today would be considered racist and/or sexist. Films like Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips and Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs play on ethnic stereotypes,a common practice in comedy films of that period. Many of these cartoons are no longer shown on television, but history\n\ncannot be ignored. In our efforts to be complete,we have included these entries,and we hope that you will view them in their proper historical context\n\nWill FriedwEdd wrote of the cartoons of the 1930s and 1950s,Jerry Beck covers the 1940s and 1960s and compiled the sections on TV series, specials,feature films and miscellaneous information. Obviously,this book could not exist without the cooperation of Warner Bros. lnc„ and particularly the Warner Bros. Animation Department We are grateful to Steven S. Greene and Kathleen Helppie-Shipley for encoureiging this project Their staff was especially helpful and we would like to thank Chris Walsh,Rick Gehr,Jim Cheunpin,Terry Lennon and Greg Ford for their knowledgeable assistance. The UCLA Film and Television Archive was an invaluable source in\n\nresearching many of the pre-1948 titles, and special thanks are due to Jere Guldin and Ed Carter, who shared their enthusiasm during our many marathon cartoon screenings.\n\nFor helping us fill in the gaps, providing stills,films, and general moral support, we would like to thank Gary Schwartz,John Cawley,Tony Eastman,Dwayne Dimock, Mark Mayerson,Rick Scheckman,Kit Parker, P.A. Carayannis,Herb Graff,John Kricfalusi,Bruce Goldstein,Jim Korkis, David Mruz,Harry Fisk, George Woolery,Paul Merle Wise,Jim Benson, Harry McCracken, Mike Kazaleh,Will Ryan,John Sammis,Lori Stein,Don Hutter,David Wilkerson,Bill Lorenzo,Susan Neri, Libby Simon,\"Uncle\" Wayne Daigrepont,\"The New York Cult,\" and the gang in Apatoons. Special thanks to Chuck Jones,Friz Freleng,Leonard Maltin,Steve Schneider,and Richard H. Thomas,true experts on the history of Warner Bros, cartoons, who provided answers to our most trivial questions. And finally,for special efforts above and beyond the call of duty, we are indebted to some good friends without whom this book would not be as complete. We are thankful for the research assistance provided by Mark Kausler,Greg Duffell, Collin Kellogg,Steven \"Doc\"Ferzoco,and Kevin Wollenweber.\n\nA last note: watching over 1,000 Warner Bros, cartoons is educational. We learned four rules which have enriched our lives and we will never\n\nforget:\n\n#1:Hippety Hopper is not a giant mouse. #2:Always get a warranty from ACME. #3: Never let Bugs or Daffy shave youl #4:The little light—it stays onl Jerry Beck Will Friedwcdd\n\nApril 1989\n\nNote:In the credits in the following filmography,\"LT\"denotes Looney Tune and\"MM\"denotes Merrie Melodie.\"2/C\" stands for Two Strip\n\nTechnicolor(red and green hues), used in 1934-1935 Merrie Melodies; \"3/C\"indicates Three Strip Technicolor(full color) which was used from 1936 onward. Hugh Harman and RudolfIsing supervised all cartoons unless otherwise credited through 1933. Frank Marsales,likewise,scored the music.\n\n1930 SINKIN'IN THE BATHTUB\n\nBosko, Honey;Sept; LT;Supervision by Hugh Harman and RudolfIsing; Animation by Isadora Freling; Music by Frank Marsalas.\n\nWe open on Bosko, the Tal k-ink Kid, allegedly bathing, but really giving far more attention to music-making than to cleaning himself, as he turns his feet, his nose, and streams of shower water into musical instruments. Even Bosko's\n\nbathtub gets into the act and does a gay dance with the towel and toilet paper (to Mendelssohn's \"Spring Song\")! After dressing, Bosko summons his car from the outhouse and the two go tip toeing through the tulips over to see his girlfriend. Honey. She, too, is singin' in the bathtub, and modestly closes the blinds and dresses when Bosko calls to\n\nher. Despondent when a goat consumes the tulips he has brought his sweetie, Bosko bawls until Honey reassures him \"Ah still loves yo'\" and he serenades her with an ad-hoc saxophone and her front steps used as a giant xylophone. Then they're off together for a ride that starts out unpleasantly as they encoun ter a fussy bespectacled cow whose powerful expectorations threaten to annihilate their engine. The ride soon becomes downright harrowing when a bump knocks Bosko out of the car as they start to climb slowly up a moun tain. Eventually, they reach the top, but the car starts rolling down. Bosko chases after it as Honey screams,\"Ooh,\n\nCONGO JAZZ\n\nBosko; Oct; LT;Animation by Max Maxwell and Paul Smith; Music by Frank Marsalas.\n\nBosko, first shown with pith helmet and elephant gun, goes stalking wild game in the jungle, although any intention of hunting the jungle animals soon van ishes as Bosko makes music with them.\n\nFirst he produces a flute in the face of a hungry tiger. Then, once the beast is sufficiently charmed, he kicks it off a cliff. Next, a father gorilla (addressed by our hero as \"Mr. Ape\")catches Bosko spanking one ofhis offspring, and Bosko cools him down by turning chewing gum into a harp string and plunking out a tune. Soon, Bosko finds himself conducting an entire orchestra of not-so-wild animals, each playing either an instrument, a piece ofjungle scenery transformed into an instru ment, or another animal whose body is used as an instrument. Fade out on\n\nBosko laughing merrily with a trio of hyenas. The animators seem uncomfortable\n\nwith quadruped animals, so most of the Congo critters walk around ont their hind legs.\"When the Little Red Roses Get the Blues for You\" serves as the\n\nchewing gum harp solo. HOLD ANYTHING\n\nBosko, Honey; Nov; LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Norm Blackburn. Bosko as a riveter on a construction\n\ncrew consisting mainly of Mickey-like mice, all of whom show more interest in\n\nEee, Ah! Ooh! Eee! Ah! Ooh! Eee!\n\nmusic than in their labors. Bosko whis\n\nAh!\" Bosko grabs onto a rope extend ing from the car, only to have his crotch dragged over a succession of boulders, trees, and telephone poles. Eventually car, Bosko, and Honey wind up plum meting off the mountain, luckily land ing in a lake below, which immediately\n\ntles and operates his machinery in time to the score, the mice march in musical formation, and when Bosko discovers the sound a mouse makes bouncing on a saw, he proceeds to use the mouse and saw as an instrument, still smiling cheerfully as he decapitates the help less rodent. He hi..llers to the gound crew (the re-capitated mouse and a goat)to send up a beam, and just when we think he's actually going to do some work, he turns the wire cables into harp strings and calls out to Honey, typing away in the office of a nearby building. She responds by typing,\"Gee You're Swell!\" and Bosko goes into a\n\nbecomes an enormous bathtub for them\n\nto sing in—lily pads and ducks joining\n\ntap dance on the swaying beam. Far\n\nfrom being afraid offalling, he contin ues his terpsichory on a line of musical\n\n1931\n\nnotes that appear. He then converts Honey's typewriter into a piano as\n\nBOX CAR BLUES\n\nHoney tap-dances and scat sings on the ledge. When the goat swallows the steam whistle and inflates, Bosko uses him as both a balloon and an instru\n\nment as Honey continues her dance.\n\nThe goat-balloon carries Bosko into the air, and he falls onto a brick wall, breaking into a half-dozen miniature Boskos(Fred Astaire would do this in live action in Blue Skies), who dance in\n\na chorus line, turning the bricks into piano keys. They reassemble into one normal-size Bosko, who tips his hat. THE BOOZE HANGS HIGH\n\nBosko;Dec; LT; Animation by Isadore Freleng and Paul Smith. Barnyard humor. Bosko and miscella neous smiling cows, horses, and pigs engage in a bizarre juxtaposition of musical interludes and gross gags: a horse's behind becomes an arco bass\n\nfiddle; a family of skipping ducks inter rupt their merry prancing about so that\n\none little duckling can go to the bath room; a trio of swine wallowing in a particularly disgusting trough of slop happen upon a bottle of hooch, get thoroughly plastered, and the biggest, most drunken porker vocalizes as he regurgitates(a gag cut from most TV prints). Though the score(and selection of specific tunes)is hardly tangential to any of the Harman-Ising Warner films,\n\nBosko;Jan; LT;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Max Maxwell.\n\nBosko and a fellow hobo, a cute but sleazy-looking fat pig with a banjo, are bumming on a train, entertaining each other with \"Cryin'for the Carolines.\" The train's somewhat perilous ride sup\n\nplies most of the story line when it goes uphill. The train becomes an inchworm that scurries up the back of the moun tain; then it becomes human and its\n\n\"pants\" start to slide off. On reaching the top, the last box car breaks off from the rest of the train and goes rolling down with our hapless heroes aboard. On top, Bosko yells for help as the car rolls topsy-turvy over treacherous hills (getting his head temporarily lopped off in the sliding door at one point), in and out of pitch-black tunnels, though even fear of death doesn't prevent him from going into an impression of Jolson doing \"Mammy!\" The boxcar tangles with a cow on the tracks and Bosko\n\nfinds himself being dragged over the same boulders, trees, and telephone poles as in Sinkin'in the Bathtub. After a crash, which results in several minutes of falling rubble, Bosko and the pig end up once again on a hand car with their banjo. They continue their singing. Appropriately, the music in the open ing shots is \"Alabamy 'Bound.\"\n\nhere it supplies the film's strongest\n\nBIG MAN FROM THE NORTH\n\npoint of humor. The soundtrack con\n\nBosko; Feb; LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Robert Edmunds. Bosko is a rather sheepish Northwest Mountie whose short-tempered Sar gent orders him \"Get your man!\" He mushes his dog sled over a few hills\n\nsists almost entirely of quotes from Song ofthe Flame, a rather bourgeois Oscar Hammerstein operetta, filmed by War ners in 1930, concerning the French Revolution. The cartoon climaxes in\n\nthe basso profundo intoxication aria, \"One Little Drink,\" reducing it to a series of piggy squeals and oinks. We end on Bosko and the pigs doing a cossack-dance to \"Song of the Flame.\" It opens when the blackness of the title card becomes the back of a cow's\n\nudder, as in Disney's 1928 Plane Crazy, which Harman and Ising had also worked on.\n\nuntil it crashes into the side of a build\n\ning(merging all three dogs into one three-headed conglomerate pooch). Bosko enters after reaching into his pocket and drawing out two guns, each as big as he is. He is in a saloon, and the delighted Bosko discovers Honey entertaining therein (scatting the 1930 pop song \"Chinnin' and Chattin' with May\"). As you might expect, Bosko temporarily abandons his \"Get your man\" mission to join Honey in enter-\n\ntaining the crowd, a mixture of bearded prospectors and beavers. Bosko then starts to play a piano solo, abetted by beavers and pelicans who emerge from a spittoon, but is inter rupted by the peg-legged villain whom he has been assigned to apprehend. Summoning up his courage, Bosko pulls his pistol; it fires only a cork and a string. Thinking quickly, Bosko douses the lights with some well-aimed saliva and the darkness blazes with\n\ngunfire. When the lights come on, Bosko has a machine gun to use on his adversary and tricks him into getting caught up in the saloon's swinging doors. Bosko then delivers the finishing blows, a jab deeply and violently in the rump with a sword, then a huge rifle blasting off the villain's fur, leaving one rather scrawny animal behind to run off to the other other animals' applause. Other song:\"Looking For the Love Light in the Dark.\"\n\nIt's the day of the big horse race and the animals are arriving in droves. Bosko is a hot dog vendor with dancing weinies. He sells one to a dog character who recognizes it as his long lost \"Sonny Boy\" and the two go off together to the tune of the Jolson song. While the other horses train for the\n\nrace like boxers, Bosko produces his own steed, a mechanical horse. The gun goes off and Bosko's horse goes in reverse, crashing against a wall. Bosko repairs him by mixing him up in a cocktail shaker. Once this mechanism\n\ngets going, there's practically no stop\n\nping it, even when the bad guy's black saliva threatens to reverse Bosko's\n\nhorse-rider relationship. Bosko wins the race by stretching out the robot horse's neck in front of his adversary.\n\nAIN'T NATURE GRAND?\n\nBosko; Mar;LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Norm Blackburn. Kindhearted Bosko goes fishing but is much too humane to subject his worm to the hook and lets it go free(while his story is interrupted by a lengthy birdchasing-worm episode). Bosko catches a fish only to fondle it as he asks the audience,\"Ain't dat cute?\" In return the fish spits in his eye. Bosko contin ues frolicking in the great outdoors, gaily following a butterfly, admiring and joining a pair of dancing bees in front of a waterfall, then doing a chorus line with four gung-ho frogs who emerge from the mouth of a pelican. Other woodland creatures get into the act, including a spider whose body turns into a maypole. Two little bugs convert a dragonfly into a bombing warplane from which they drop rocks and shoot bees at the screaming Bosko who ducks into a fountain for safety, posing like a sprouting statue for the fadeout.\n\nUPS'N DOWNS\n\nBosko; LT;Supervision by RoIIin Hamilton and Paul Smith.\n\nMusic by Frank Marsales\n\nDUBIB PATROL\n\nBosko; May;LT;Animation by Isadora Fralang and Max Maxwell. An explosion here, a burst of gunfire there, and the screen is filled with warplanes, soaring, shooting, flaming. We dissolve to Bosko, the Talkink Kid,\n\ncheerfully whistling \"Get Happy\" in the middle of the war as he lovingly oils his little airplane(and blows its nose). When one particularly gnarly enemy flyer nearly kayos them with a bomb, Bosko and plane take to the air and follow in hot pursuit. Bosko takes aim on the villain, but the cad reduces Bosko's plane to rubble with shots from a monstrous cannon. Bosko crashes in the ruins of a house where he encoun\n\nters Honey, no more upset about the war or the destruction of her home than\n\nBosko, and the two \"parley-voo.\" She's indignant when he steals a kiss, so he makes up for it by entertaining her at the piano. Their merrymaking gets interrupted by more death from the skies. Bosko improvises an airplane from a broomstick, a board, and a dachshund, and turns a fence into a\n\nmachine gun which hurls planks at his adversary who fires real bullets back. Our hero sends both bullets and a\n\nbomb speeding back, reducing the enemy to a bunch of little flies.\n\nWith Bosko losing some of his timid ity, his creators have begun to expand the range of possibilities. The plot has become more fleshed out and the vis\n\nual effects, using black-and-white and the same Bosko-style pie-cut eye design are quite impressive. Back ground music includes \"Shuffle Your Feet\" and \"Just Roll Along.\"\n\nHe drives over to Honey's, strumming his banjo. It is in need of a new string so Bosko grabs the tail from a mouse that happens to be posing as his hood ornament. He takes Honey out for a ride. Her little white dog follows, and the unwelcome pooch distracts Bosko just when he's trying to push the car over a hill. The dog inflates as it bkfes into one the auto tires. The two go on their picnic, skipping to a pond that shines with their reflections. In the\n\nwoods, Bosko whispers a fresh sugges tion in Honey's ear and she is indignant until he makes a great show of liking\n\nYODELLING YOKELS\n\nher sandwiches(\"Dat sho'is fine!\").\n\nBosko;June; LT; Animation by by\n\nJust as he's won her over again, the pesky pooch licks her right smack on\n\nRollin Hamilton and Norm Blackburn.\n\nNow we have alpine antics, Bosko glee fully yodelling and playing his concer tina as he frolics when he encounters an\n\nowl who can out-yodel him. Bosko's answer is to shoot the bird and laughs uncontrollably at the singed, featherless creature. Bosko and Honey yodel back and forth for a while, then they go out to play. As he leaves her, a little mouse eeks timidly out of his hole. Now the cartoon becomes a sort of animated\n\nIntolerance, cutting back and forth between two stories: Bosko and Honey on skis falling down a snow-covered alp, the mouse sneaking across the floor; Honey in a giant snowball that smashes against a boulder and sends her flying, the mouse using a piece of Swiss cheese as a golf course with a pea as a ball; Honey landing on an iceflow in an icy river and heading towards the falls as Bosko and a convenient St. Ber\n\nnard dog speed to the rescue, the mouse still trying to play golf with the cheese.\n\nBOSKO'S HOLIDAY\n\nBosko;July; Animation by Isadore Freleng and Paul Smith. Bosko, asleep in bed, is awakened by the telephone clobbering the alarm clock, which in turn pounds on Bosko's bedpan and jabs him with its pointy arm. It is a call from Honey. Hysterical dialogue follows; the upshot is Honey inviting Bosko to a picnic. Leaping into his clothes, he calls his car from the garage (it's followed by a litter of baby cars that Bosko tells to \"Go Home\").\n\nthe behind, and Honey, thinking Bosko is responsible, gives him a rocking slap and leaves in a huff. Bosko faces the\n\ncamera disgruntedly. Nlusic includes \"I Can't Give You\n\nAnything But Love, Baby\" and \"It's a Little String Around Your Finger.\" THE TREE'S KNEES\n\nBosko; Aug;LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Rollin Hamilton. Bosko returns to the forest primeval(as in Ain't Nature Grand) but here it's\n\ntrees who beg for humanity, with sur prising combinations of the cute and the grotesque. A family of baby trees silently begs Bosko not to chop down their mother. Instead of killing them, Bosko whips out his harmonica and plays a tune for the trees(each now with two legs)to dance to. When one baby tree razzes Bosko, he rips off its bark, but then returns it to the tree, which continues to slight him.\"Well shut my mouth!\" exclaims Bosko, find ing a mother bird and a tree that rockabyes out buckets. Then Bosko chases after a butterfly and turns a bunch of small trees into harp strings on which he plays \"Dancing with Tears in My Eyes.\" A stately older tree makes like a concert violinist; other trees, especially the weeping willow, bawl hysterically and pussy willows meow in tempo. One mouse saves another from drowning, then the two of them form an impres sion of a phonograph player as another tree goes into a Spanish dance.\"Trees\" also turns up on the soundtrack.\n\nLAD7PLAT YOUR BIANDOLIN\n\nFoxy; Sept; MM;Supervision by Frank Marsales; Animation by RoHin Hamilton and Norm Blackburn; with Abe Lyman and His Brunswick Recording Orchestra.\n\nA jazz-hot cartoon set in a south-of-theborder saloon. The music is so hot and infectious that all distinctions are\n\nblurred as pertain to morality and sobriety. Lyrics keep dwelling on the\n\nthe car. Foxy obligingly deflates her with her own hat pin. Next his girl friend boards the car, and the two indulge in a chorus of the title song, accompanied by the train's advertising, which comes to life. The obstacles they must surmount as the train trudges across the countryside begin with a stubborn cow, lazily chewing its cud on the tracks, and a quartet of hobos who mock him with a chorus of the same\n\nline \"When you sing your song of sin/ I'm a sinner, too.\" The whole joint\n\nsong(when their partially cooked chicken joins in the music, one of the\n\ndances to the music, even hat racks, tables, and a customer's beard. Foxy, a new character resembling Mickey Mouse with pointy ears and a bushy tail, gets ticked at his horse for wanting to prance around on two legs and whoop it up with everyone else. The horse gets woozy from Foxy's blow to his head with a hooch bottle and stag gers about the place in a stupor, making\n\nbums entreats it to \"Boil, darn ya,\n\nnoises like a live trombone and halluci\n\nnating nightmarish monsters in mir rors. His antics get so hot he spontaneously combusts, burning much of his body to an ash. Meanwhile, Foxy does Jolson impressions and sings Frank Crumit's \"The Gay Caballero\" while his girlfriend on stage does her act as the original lady with the man dolin.

When Foxy is unable to stop it, he wakes up from his dream and clobbers his radio, which is in the middle of a final rendition of\"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!\"\n\nThis early Merrie Melody is more valuable for its historic significance than as a cartoon, and for its themesong inspiration to Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\n\nBOSKO SHIPWRECKED\n\nBosko;Sept 19; LT;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Larry Martin. The plot thickens. Although there's\n\nnothing wrong with purely visual and musical cartoons, the animated cartoon in the talkie era generally developed toward fuller narratives, more believa ble characters, and graphic realism (or at least a particular interpretation of realism). For once there's precious little song and dance, as Bosko gets washed up on a deserted island by a terrible storm. As he naps, a couple of monkeys engage in amusing antics with his hat, until they accidentally spill,an egg on him, which inspires a wiseguy parrot to crack,\"The yolk's on you.\" A lion comes lunging after Bosko(he sees the shadow first), who high-tails it to a lagoon. Bosko leaps onto what he thinks is a rock but turns out to be a\n\ncrocodile. Unwittingly, the lion leaps into the croc's mouth; Bosko is saved. Finding a rowboat, Bosko tries to anchor to a piece of land that turns out\n\nto be a hippo that drags him to a native camp. Burning his behind on a red-hot caldron, Bosko flees the tribe of canni-\n\nbals coming after him. Bosko drives on to what he thinks is a hoat, hut discov ers is a rhinoceros. No matter, the heast\n\ngives Bosko armored protection from the natives, helping him get away. ONE MORE TIME\n\nFoxy; Oct 3; MM;Animation by Isadore Freleng and Paul Smith; with Abe Lyman and His Brunswick Recording Orchestra.\n\nThe song is ahout a separated sweet heart who pleads \"One more time/let me do the things that I used to do/let me sit down to some tea for two.\" Here\n\nthe lyric is altered to describe Foxy's dilemma as a police officer walking his heat, constantly harassed by nervy law breakers. In tempo with \"One more time,\" he vows that the next guy who\n\ndoesn't watch his step will get it hut good. The transgressors range from gangsters who ambush Officer Foxy with machine guns out of garbage cans to the lady hippo(from Smile, Darn Ya, Smile and Bosko's Soda Fountain)\n\nhauled in by Foxy on an automobile charge. The hippo weepingly pleads in song with Foxy not to be given \"One more fine.\" Soon after. Foxy runs into\n\nhis girlfriend and her dog, and the two stage an impromptu concert, using a\n\npiano as well as the dog's teeth. The music is interrupted by the noise of tiny bird hoodlums robbing a wealthy hippo at machine gun point. Foxy and a wagonful of cops go after what soon is a whole carload o' crooks. Foxy is nearly done in by one of the bad guy's rather\n\ncharges this way, another attacks that way, and it's deliberately unclear who's fighting whom and which side Bosko's on. The whole point of the film is get ting off on the way the cute and round Harman-Ising approach circa 1931 surprisingly suits the horrors of war, the Bosko philosophy, as well as the visual style. Their standard elements, in fact, assume new meaning in this setting: Bosko's ability to make music in any situation becomes intense when he and a pal timestep together in a fox hole bombarded by a rain of bombs. In every Harman or Ising film up through the 30s, characters are always finding uses for objects that are very different from what the objects were intended for (improvising). In this cartoon, you real ize these cartoon characters are devis\n\ning funny and cute li'l ways to kill each other, it becomes morbid humor in the\n\ntrue sense. It almost seems like a par ody when inanimate objects mimic the human action of dying. Whether the best parts of the film's humor are intentional or otherwise, this remains one of the strongest of the Boskos.\"Am 1 Blue\" figures on the sound track.\n\nYOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOIN'\n\nP'iiy!

The band sounds pretty good to the audience at large\n\nBOSKO THE DOUGHBOY\n\n(now as then), but Piggy takes umbrage with the musicians, telling them they\n\nnasty expectorations.

On stage, it's Piggy's turn to be heck led; three drunks who become a vocal\n\ntrio take on the assignment. They and Piggy sing the title song back and forth\n\ncheerful on the Western Front. There is\n\nat each other. One wino falls out of his\n\nsome plot, meaning any nonmusical\n\nbox and onto the stage, and his breath instantly intoxicates Piggy. The two go\n\ninterlude.

Music by Frank Marsales\n\nby Frank Marsales.\n\nOne of the more event-packed Merrie Melodies, with more plot going for it than the usual boy-girl-villain formula. Piggy is a riverboat captain whose boat is the stage for a band of black musi\n\ncians and dancers. Piggy picks up his girlfriend, who was driven to the dock by the old reliable servant Uncle Tom. Piggy's dance on the boat rail ends when he falls into the river where he\n\ngets knocked about by the paddlewheel and then tangles with a crocodile.

A dachshund has the mis fortune to devour a row of five-cent sandwiches and becomes an accordion\n\ngraves and threaten to send Uncle Tom\n\nthe river, and starts to drown. While\n\nPiggy jumps in to help (\"I'll save Uncle Tom!\"), a black-hatted villain tries to.\n\nget fresh with the girl(\"Me proud beauty!\").

Honey orders one from Bosko via phone, who has a tough time biking over and not spilling it. He is rewarded by Wilber screaming \"I don't like vanilly!\" and blowing it in his face. Bosko then chases Wilber around\n\nthe house. This is truly a lad after Bos-\n\nacross the forest, the central thread in\n\nthis collection of horse-and-hunt gags. Bosko's on a droopy horse whose mid dle sags under his weight. Bosko, show\n\ning his usual selflessness, shoves a log down the horse's throat to prop him up. The fox avoids the pack of dogs and hunters by dodging into a hollow log.\n\nko's heart; he's even crueler than\n\nWhen he sees Bosko on his trail he\n\nBosko, kicking him in the face and arranging for him to slide down a ban\n\narranges for hero and horse to go splashing into a muddy puddle.

Producing an enormous rifle out of nowhere,\n\nBosko fires on the fox, as Bruno chases after it. Bruno sniffs the trees in search of the fox but one tree kicks him for fear that Bruno will... The fox turns\n\nthe tables on his hunters, biting Bruno in the rear and twisting Bosko's gun so he fires on himself. The fox hides in a\n\ndark cave, and Bosko goes in after him, soon coming out with what he thinks is the fox but is really a colossal wild boar with nasty-looking tusks. Now it's Bos\n\nbacked by two Black dollies. The Boswell Sisters-inspired arrangement\n\nthey sing, however, is hipper than any thing Midler's done. For a couple of toys, these two have a pretty adult relationship.\n\n1932 BOSKO AT THE ZOO\n\nBosko, Honey;Jan 9; LT; Animation by Isadora Freleng and Larry Martin. \"Won't it be fun, Bosko?\" asks Honey as the two are about to enter the zoo.\n\nOf course, Bosko is going to have a\n\nko's turn to be chased.

You can guess what happens: the toymaker goes to sleep, and all the lit tle characters come to life and go into a\n\nproduction number. Carmen-like, the Red-Headed Baby doll of the title finds love in 32 bars with \"Napoleon,\" the\n\ncommander of a troop of toy soldiers. A monstrous spider tries to carry her off on a toy train and knocks the stuffing out of a plucky soldier trying to defend her. The soldier inflates himself and\n\narranges for the \"Lousy Scoundrel\" to get a hot foot—but not on his foot, no sir! Then the Red-Headed Baby and the other toys go into a reprise of the title song, so infectiously hot that even the toymaker wakes up and gets in the act.\n\nThe Red-Headed (in black and white\n\nno less) Baby comes off like a 30s counterpart to Bette Midler, especially\n\nwhen shaking her thighs wildly (\"Snakehips!\" the appreciative Napoleon\n\nyells) or in the final number in a trio\n\ngood as they get. A vignette in the fish and Honey on the outside rendered in squiggly lines to indicate water distor tion) sets up the usual parallel of the cute and the crude: cute little fishies\n\nplaying leap frog and using an obliging octopus for a maypole dance share their tank with a snarling, sharklike fish that\n\ngrowls at both our heroes and the audi ence. An ostrich then swallows Bosko's\n\nderby and he rather roughly forces the big bird to return it by laying an egg that contains the hat. Bosko then\n\ncheers up the dejected bird with a little tune on his flute, which sets off a brief musical episode wherein beavers beat their tails in tempo and two little mon\n\nkeys scratch to the beat. This leads to a gross scene in which the monkeys gree dily eat one of the bugs and stab each other with forks, for which Bosko scolds and spanks one of them. An enormous\n\ngorilla, presumably a parent, catches Bosko in the middle of thrashing his\n\noffspring, and Bosko high-tails it out of there! Running from the ape, every thing goes wrong for Bosko. He grabs a snake instead of a vine and falls onto a\n\nlion. Soon the lion is chasing after him as well, while the ostrich and a seal get in the act. It ends with the ostrich, the seal, and the lion crashing into a brick wall and emerging from the accident mish-moshed into one bizarre, chi\n\nmera-like amalgam with three heads. More sophisticated visuals: the gorilla and the lion moving towards the\n\ncamera with the background moving in perspective behind them. In the begin ning, Bosko and Honey la-Ia-la \"TaRa-Ra-Boom-De-Ay\" on a bicycle.\n\nchamp,the gorillalike \"Gas-House Harry,\" is as much a musical event as a sporting competition. There is the rhythm of the crowds approaching the stadium and their cheers, Bosko's\n\nPAGAN MOON\n\nJan 31; MM;Animation by RoIIin Hamilton and Norm Blackburn.\n\nHappy Hawaiians! A ukulele-playing boy(who also scats like Cliff Edwards and Bosko)and a hula girl are our her oes. As they dance and sing the title number, other tropical fauna(a chimp who plays coconut percussion, a little bird who has to go the outhouse)and flora(a femme tree with coconut\n\nbreasts) get in the act. The boy saves his uke from a hungry croc and then gets the razz from a turtle. When the instrument falls in the lagoon, he dives to the bottom (avoiding the hungry fish from Bosko at the Zoo.)To appease an angry octopus, he plays an underwater piano on a shipwreck and is soon sur rounded by fish trumpeters, trombon ists, and clarinetists, with a spittoon serving as a snare drum. Not only does the octopus like music, he plays piano himself and sings in a basso voice. Then a carnivorous fish comes by, scar ing the boy and all his new fish pals away. The boy escapes in a bubble that carries him above the surface and into\n\nboasting in song of his macho prowess to both Honey and the crowd at large, his tap dance on the ropes, and an interruption by the referee(an ostrich), which becomes a gay \"Dance of the Cuckoos.\" Honey, seated at her piano, listens nervously to the broadcast, reacting as though she can actually see Bosko being clobbered. When the ref starts to count Bosko out. Honey and her dog run to the arena and manage to make it to Bosko's side while the count\n\nis still going (although by that point it's reached 13 instead of ceasing at the customary ten). She implores Bosko to get up and fight, but he declines, wrap ping himself up in the canvas as though it were a blanket and yelling,\"Ah utsnay!\" Other music:\"Turkey In the Straw\" and \"The Shanty Where Santy Glaus Lives.\"\n\nFREDDY THE FRESHMAN\n\nFeb 20; MM;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Paul Smith.\n\nAnother \"period\" location, the vigorous college atmosphere depicting the Har\n\nthe air, where his hula girl rides a peli\n\nold Lloyd-ian 20s(Freddy wears genu\n\ncan to his rescue.\n\nine \"Joe College\" glasses). There's not a villain in this one,just a party\n\nsequence, with the expected quota of singing and dancing, and a football game. The game is clever, Freddy win ning by carefully circumnavigating the various duck ponds and clotheslines covering the field (in the days before astroturf). The musical number is the\n\nhighlight, with the irresistibly peppy title song being broken down line by\n\nBATTLING BOSKO\n\nBosko, Honey; Feb 6;LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Paul Smith. If there's brutality in Bosko's music (such as his use of animals as instru\n\nments), then, all things being equal, there's also music in his brutality. A boxing match between Bosko and the\n\nline to be sung by various entities, from four cats who comprise Freddy's \"raccoon\"-skin coat to a little Mickey-influ enced mouse who pops out of a spittoon and sings in falsetto. On campus, a cou ple of owls cheer about Night School. Other music includes the Warner's\n\nperennial \"It Looks to Me Like a Big Night Tonight\" and several college cheers, among them Harvard (\"Boola, Boola\")and Georgia Tech(\"A Heck of an Engineer\").\n\nand-bouncing animals get off on the new music via a cathedral radio. There\n\nalso is a babbling brook that sounds like Bing(\"Many Happy Returns of the Day\")and a bear that does a Rudy Vallee impression (\"This Is My Love Song\"). Soon all the other Indian kids join in the fun, which is interrupted only when the brave takes a few sec onds off to play Smokey the Bear and put out a runaway fire by spitting on it. Other music:\"Pale Moon.\"\n\nBIG-HEARTED BOSKO\n\nBOSKO'S PARTY\n\nBosko, Bruno; Mar 5;LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and RoIIin Hamilton. Not three men and a baby, but a man, his dog and a baby. Bosko and Bruno amuse themselves atop a frozen pond, with Bosko doing stunts while Bruno tries(without success)to avoid getting\n\nBosko, Honey; Apr 2;LT;Animation by Isadore Freleng and Larry Martin.\n\ndoused in the ice water. The two stum\n\nble on a mysterious yowling basket that turns out to contain an orphaned baby.\n\nThey take it home, and the objective becomes to pacify the lad's caterwauls somehow. Bosko's violin solo, per formed as Bruno gently rocks the babe in a cradle (fortunately, Bosko hap pened to have a cradle), does no good. Bruno accidentally sits on a stove and sets his fanny afire, temporarily turn ing the orphan's cries into shrieks of laughter. Finally, Bosko resorts to what his fans knew would work all along: he sits down at the piano and breaks into a hot jazz number. Bruno gets in the act by slipping on a lamp shade and mak ing like a shimmy dancer. Bosko then dances about the house, the cartoon ending when he bumps into a goldfish bowl that lands on his head.\n\nCROSBY,COLUHBO AND VALLEE\n\nMar 19; MM;Animation by RoIIin Hamilton and Max Maxwell.\n\nDisappointing in that the title song, though perhaps not a very good song, could certainly have been given better treatment. In a war dance, a tribe of\n\nIndian braves complain about the three paleface crooners who get their women all upset. Meanwhile, a little boy brave and his sweetie \"Minniehaha,\" com\n\nmuning with a forest-full of smiling-\n\nWhile Honey puts on her makeup and dresses, Bosko and friends prepare a surprise party. She applies her cake mascara (with a little saliva) on her\n\nfalse eyelashes and tastefully dresses behind a transom. Meanwhile, down stairs, funny animal types of all description (but usually round and with pie-cut eyes)scurry about looking for hiding places. Bosko helps an obese swine cram his carcass under the bed (where he discovers a little animal hid\n\ning in a chamberpot) by deflating him, and then shoves a flower pot on top of the little cat character(named \"Wil-\n\nber\" in Bosko's Dizzy Date). They all \"duck\" before Honey enters the room and then surprise her with a chorus of '\"Happy Birthday.\" Bosko presents Honey with her gift, a ukulele, which she uses as backing for a duet on \"Sugar\"(not the jazz standard but a'31 pop tune with the same name), as the other animals cheer. Unnoticed in their\n\nrevelry. Little Wilber has been unable to get out from under the flower. When\n\nhe finally succeeds he goes straight into a mousetrap. Through a Rube Gold berg set of circumstances, the little cat winds up falling into the cake and\n\nsplashing Bosko with icing. GOOPYGEER\n\nApr 16; MM;Animation by Isadore Freleng and RoIIin Hamilton; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nIn a crowded nightclub, everyone is asking for Goopy Geer, the star per former. Goopy, a piano-playing dog character, comes on stage and performs the number \"I Have Not Studied\n\nMusic.\" He sees three cats eating spa ghetti and accompanies them to the tune of\"The Sidewalks of New York.\"\n\nGoopy next performs \"Tiger Rag\" four handed—his two hands and his two\n\ngloves!\n\nA waiter orders a bowl of soup, which is prepared by a chicken that swims in a pot. Goopy is joined on stage by a girl singer who croons,\"I Need Lovin.\" Goopy then does a soft shoe that starts the whole club dancing, including a performance by a pair of coat racks\n\nfew eggs. This escapade soon escalates into Bruno chasing a chicken riding a lawnmower. Suddenly, the irate farmer comes charging after them with his shotgun. The two get away by leaping onto a box car, which turns out to be the same free-wheeling, no-stopping-it box car that had given Bosko such a hard time in Box Car Blues(1930). They hold on for dear life as the car goes tearing around a treacherous mountain pass. Protagonists, train, and a foldable cow crash into a tree and the\n\nthat dance with hats and canes. A horse\n\ncartoon abruptly ends.\n\ngets drunk, looks in the mirror, and starts to see horrible images of mon\n\nIT'S GOT MB AGAIN EE'\n\nsters. The horse begins to spit fire, which destroys Goopy's piano, ending the cartoon.\n\nNo story,just music and dance. This was Harman-Ising's way to end the depression blues. The crowd scenes are lifted from Lady Play Your Mandolin (1931).\n\nMay 14; MM;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Thomas McKimson.\n\nNine years later, an Ising-produced cartoon(Puss Gets the Boots M-\n\nG-M)would give birth to Tom and Jerry; this more primitive cat-andmouse episode has appeal of its own.\n\nThe mice share Mickey's circular ears and bulbous shoes, but notably they're more interested in making music than in stealing food: instruments, phono graphs, and metronomes serve equally as attractions, musical devices for the\n\nrodents(a piano serving as a backdrop for an Apache dance, the tune plunked out by the dancers' feet). All have a\n\nfine time until a cat appears and breaks up the party. When he corners a rodent it squeaks out the title song, a Jolson singspiel in falsetto.

There, they go into a few steps, both the music and the dance deriving\n\nmore from Tin Pan Alley than the Ozarks. The point becomes moot as the scene is quickly stolen by, of all things, a pot-bellied stove that becomes the most important character in the flick!

As with most of the Ising Merrie Melo dies, we get some gags based on the locale(a medieval castle with kings and knights), a song, and then the usual boy-saves-girl-from-villain plot. As usual, the \"plot\" doesn't merit distract ing us from the music and the shtick. The first bit involves the unpretentious pig king, who arrives in his castle on the back of a donkey, inquires as to the whereabouts of his missus and is\n\nBOSKO'S DOG RACE\n\nBosko;June 25;LT; Animation by RoIIin Hamilton and Norm Blackburn.\n\nThe opening sequence has Bosko(singing \"Are You from Dixie?\")frying an egg on a campfire and chasing after a Mickey Mouse-ish squirrel that has made off with the egg. Bosko and\n\nBruno come across a poster advertising a \"Whippet Race\" with a purse of $5,000, and Bosko declares, \"Bruno, you're gonna run in this race and you're gonna win!\" Dissolve to Bosko putting Bruno through the paces of\n\nanswered by a trio singing the title song.

Bosko\n\ndives to the rescue. Bruno rides out to\n\nBosko and Wilber on a log with an electric fan attached for propulsion. They ride back to shore, a triumphant ending. I LOVE A PARADE\n\nAug 6; MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Tom McKimson; Music by Frank Marsales. Fun and frolics at a circus opening on a quartet of ecstatic onlookers who hap pily harmonize on Arlen and Harburg's marchlike \"I Love a Parade\" as they watch the circus parade go by. A tum bling clown appears several times as a sort of visual reference point, though the focus is on the musicians and an unenthusiastic street cleaner who\n\nwould rather their parade were rained on. The next segment dwells on the acts in the sideshow, which include a savage wild man,\"Gumbo,the India Rubber Man,\" who can transform him self into a tire and jews harp, piggy Siamese twins who do the old joke about one inhaling on a cigar and the other blowing out smoke, a tough, then effeminate tattooed man, an exoticdancing lady hippo, and the \"Skinny man from India,\" Mahatma Ghandi. Inside, the horse of Mam'selle Fifi the bareback rider(another of those obese\n\nlady hippopotomi that Harman and Ising often employ for humor)eventu ally turns the tables on her while a Honey-like girl cat walks the high wire while singing how she, too, loves a parade. Then, the lion tamer sticks his head in the big cat's mouth, and the lion does the same. The lion then has\n\ntrouble with some unscratchable fleas, who finally go away when he removes his teeth and puts them on this tail. BOSKO'S STORE\n\nBosko; Aug 13; LT; Animation by Isadora Freleng and Bob McKimson. Shenanigans in a grocery store with\n\nBosko as proprietor: a dachsund eating sliced baloney becomes an accordion, a little mouse with big round ears phones Bosko(by riding around on the dial), asks if the store has dried fish, and then demands,\"Well, why don't ya give 'em a drink?\" but mainly it's Bosko taking care of business in time to the music. Honey and Little Wilber show up across the street, and she suggests, \"Let's make whoopee, Bosko!\" But as they execute a unison dance to a player piano version of\"How Can You Say No (When All the World Is Saying Yes?)\" Wilber proceeds to demolish the store. Bosko tries to stop him, but only gets a banana in his face, his body stuck in a mess of molasses and, in the concluding gag, barbed wire scraped across his torso.\n\nBOSKO THE LUMBERJACK\n\nBosko, Honey; Sept 3; LT; Animation by Isadora Freleng and Max Maxwell. First, a succession of animals-chopping-down-trees gags, then Boskochopping-down-trees gags, then Bosko having lunch with Honey(the same messy chomps as in Bosko's Holiday 1930). Then we then get around to the chase melodrama: Bosko has to rescue\n\nHoney from the clutches of a hulking French-Canadian lumberman who's\n\njust as brutal as he is big. Thrown backward on to one of those enormous\n\nPearl White-style conveyor belt saws, Bosko nearly gets his backside sliced in two, is knocked down all the rungs of a ladder, and has a treeful of sap shpritzed at him, as the villain carries Honey off in a canoe. He hides in a\n\ncabin, and Bosko fires his rifle through the standard stuffed wild game animal head mounted on the wall, to make for a truly bizarre image. Forced to con front the brutal villain, Bosko catches\n\nhim with a barrel. He gets a kiss from Honey and then looks stunned when a painting falls off the wall onto him, thereby putting his head on Napoleon's body for the closer. The action sequences have a good sense of momentum and timing. On the soundtrack:\"I Wish I Had Wings\" and \"How Can You Say No(When All the World Is Saying Yes?).\"\n\nYOU'RE TOO CARELESS WITH TOUR KISSES\n\nSept 10; MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Larry Martin. A domestic comedy about a comic drunkard husband and his plucky wife who has to go out and bring home the bacon when he comes home sloshed at\n\nthe crack of dawn. Unfortunately, both the musical angle (a dreary waltz whose only distinction is this film) and the boy-girl-villain triangle interfere with a potentially more sophisticated story line. Husband and wife are bees, and the villain is a monstrous spider (who informs the audience,\"They tell me I'm crazy, but I'm not... much!\").\n\nThe spider chases the girl bee all over his haunted house when she comes in\n\nfrom the rain. Luckily, her ne'er-dowell husband, still in his top hat and spats, hears her shrieks, snaps out of his intoxicated stupor, and rallies all the other insects to her rescue.\n\nThe old drinking song \"The Bear Went Over the Mountain\" serves as theme music.\n\nI WISH I HAD WINGS\n\nOct 15; MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Paul Smith; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nagain, he maneuvers the scarecrow to a kerosene lamp and burns its stuffing. A GREAT BIG BUNCH OP YOU\n\nNov 12; MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Thomas McKimson; Music by Frank Marsales. It's junkyard jive, with a wonderful song used as the basis for a swell pro duction number that consists of seven\n\nminutes of dancing refuse in a junk yard led by a discarded department store mannequin in 1890's clothes. The mannequin comes to life when the junkman tosses him into the city dump and immediately does a Bosko step and sits down at the piano(using a set of bedsprings in place of the origi nal strings). Other junk gets into the act as he sings(including a pair of shoes that stick their tongues out at each otjier), and the junk characters applaud wildly when he does impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Ted Lewis. A\n\ngrandfather clock does a spry dance with the picked-clean skeleton of a chicken in a pot and a sextet of baby clocks, and then a miniature troop of toy soldiers fires their pop guns at dis carded bottles and sinks the ship in a painting of Washington crossing the Delaware.

He hears the sound of sleigh bells and says, \"Santy Claus!\"just as jolly old Saint Nick bursts through the door, singing the title song. When they get to the bridge the kid sings,\"Oh Boy! I'd like to go with you,\" and Santy answers, \"You've been so good, you'll have that wish come true!\" They ride off together in Santy's sleigh to his North Pole workshop where dozens of \"living\" toys entertain him (and us) with an irresisti\n\nbly peppy version of the title song, bounced back and forth between a\n\nfemale trio(Red-Headed Baby-like dolls) and a hot band, represented visu ally by a wind-up \"Sambo jazz band.\" For a bit of tension near the end, the Christmas tree catches fire, and all the toys cooperate to put it out, and the kid\n\nBosko;Jan 16; LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Norm Blackburn.\n\nFramed visually by the light of the pale western moon and musically by howling coyotes, our cowboy hero Bosko croons, \"While the Bloom is on\n\nthe Sage.\" He rides into Red Gulch, a rough, tough town described by an\n\nintertitle card as \"Where men are men^ nine times out of ten.\" Bosko's friends are so tough they \"welcome\" him by riddling his hat with bullets. In a com paratively tame saloon (for Red Gulch)\n\nBosko does a soft shoe dance in spurs (\"Comin''Roun'the Mountain\"), while the piano player downs a drink so dev\n\nastating it reduces him to a simpering sissy. Bosko takes his place at the piano as the others square dance. Meanwhile, the \"free wheeling\" Deadwood Stage (so named because no axles or spokes are shown), containing Honey as its sole, passenger is besieged by a bunch of blood-thirsty bordertown bandits, lb make things more harrowing, they chase the coach down a precarious mountain pass.

Warner's first literary variant on the midnight-in-a-toyshop format with his\n\ntorical and fictional characters leaving their books to indulge in music and comedy, applauding one another. Alice (of Wonderland fame)turns on the\n\nradio to hear Art Jarrett singing Johnny Green's \"Three's a Crowd,\" his chorus followed by one of the Three Musket eers and Robinson Crusoe's Man Fri\n\nday, who join forces to become a surrogate set of Mills Brothers. Then\n\nMarc Anthony (the Roman, not the bulldog) introduces Emperor Nero, who\n\nfiddles accompaniment to a genuinely sexy dance by none other than Cleopa tra, and Uncle Tom offers a mournful\n\n\"Got the South in My Soul.\" Next it's time for the villain, in the form of the apelike Mr. Hyde, to make his appear ance and then make off with little\n\nAlice. The other characters gang up on him, using human-sized desk para phernalia as weapons: pipes, paper clips, fountain pens, pencil sharpeners. They eventually do the bad guy in and ceremoniously dump his body in the waste basket.\n\nMore music:\"One Step Ahead of My\n\ntional Chinese band, he decides to show\n\nthem '\"melican way!\" As the boy and girl come inside, the Mandarin and band go into a mock-Chinese-cum-hot version of\"One Step Ahead of My Shadow,\" with nonsense syllables that serve both as scat phrases and phoney Chinese talk. Meanwhile, nearby, a captive dragon breaks out of his cage by melting the bars with his fire breath and sneaks up on our party, chasing them all over until the boy gets the wise idea of shoving a box offireworks in the dragon's mouth, leaving a skele ton that gallops away.\n\nShadow.\"\n\nBOSKO'S DIZZY DATE\n\nBosko, Honey; Feb 6;LT;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Bob McKimson.\n\nnSpol' ONE STEP AHEAD OF MY SHADOW\n\nFeb 4; MM;Animation by Isadore Freleng and Max Maxwell; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nA first-rate Warren and Dubin song that got pretty much crowded out of Footlight Parade, here at last is given the chance to be featured in a full pro duction number. Another location pic ture, like most of the other Merrie\n\nMelodies, this opens with general gags on topical American cultural references placed irrespectfully in an exotic setting (old China, but with American-style traffic cops, outhouse-rickshaws, Toon-\n\nerville Trolleys, and Amos'n' Andy impersonators). Our boy hero paddles up to his girl's house on his miniature\n\njunk, singing the title song in a mockChinese accent. Upon greeting each other they swing it, not musically, but\n\nFor once, no elaborate settings or occu pations,just a sort of slice of life, Bosko style. Honey, getting nowhere with a bratty little kid (identified as \"Wilber\") to whom she is giving violin lessons, telephones Bosko. On the other end, Bruno answers and, at Honey's request, wakes up Bosko by dragging him out of bed. Honey entreats Bosko to \"come on over,\" and, following a slightly turbulent bike ride, he arrives at her doorstep. They go into one of their famous duets,\"(We've Got lb)\n\nPut that Sun Back in the Sky.\" They then go off bicycling together, Bosko pedaling and Honey atop the handle bars. They travel through a farmyard, and Bosko laughs hysterically when Honey gets caught on the back of a cow. When a storm besieges them and Bosko gets drenched, it's her turn to laugh at him. Other music:\"Shade of the Old\n\nApple Tree\" and \"It Ain't Gonna Rain\n\nNo' Mo'.\" Gags of note: Bruno getting struck by lightning directly on his butt and Bosko's song climaxing in his nearly getting drowned by a bucketful\n\nof soapy washwater hurled at him by the obnoxious Wilber.\n\non a real swing in the backyard. Cut to a Mandarin approaching the house on a rickshaw.

In the beginning, it is the noisy exuber-\n\nquite modem. Upon hearing a tradi\n\nBosko; LT;Animation by Isadore Freleng and Bob McKimson.\n\nance of the stadium before a big game, spectators noisily crowding in, the marching band and cheerleaders get ting everybody in that rah-rah spirit. Inside, Bosko, the football hero,\n\nBOSKO THE SPEED KINO\n\nreceives a killer rub-down. Bosko leads the team onto the field and the referee\n\ncould easily imagine this one almost gag for gag. That doesn't make it any less exciting a cartoon. Bosko finds himself in an auto race, his principal competition being an especially vile cur who takes cruel delight in scarring\n\nfires the gun (or rather fires out an egg that contains a bird who blows a whis\n\ntle) and the game begins. The game action serves only as a centerpiece for other activity: cheering fans in the bleachers, a nervous sportswriter who pounds his typewriter so hard it finally punches back. When the writers can't think of good visual football gags(how many players does it take to tackle each separate section of a centipede?), they resort to puns that will appeal to sports trivia fans. Eventually, they cut to a running gag about an eagle who sits atop a flagpole and hatches the tip. Music:\"This Is the Missus,\"\"One Step Ahead of My Shadow.\" TOUNG AND HEALTHY\n\nMar 4;MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Larry Martin; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nIn 18th-century France, fat King Louis is bored to tears with the doddering old fogies who comprise his court(\"balls, parties, and picnics, bahl\"). A Jimmy Durante-in-a-box provides his only amusement. When the Durante doodad\n\ndies(\"Am I mortified!\"), the king walks dejectedly to his balcony and finds what he's looking for, a group of ecstatic little kiddies frolicking joyfully in the royal yard.\"Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!\" He slides down a bannister and joins them, being thoroughly delighted with their playful pranks. All go into the 42nd Street number, and then he gives them the run of the pal ace to romp and play in, getting a big kick out of their terrorizing the old hag-queen. Finally, they accidentally knock him down the main steps, and he rolls into the pond in front, squirting water and fish out of his mouth. In addition to chorus after chorus of\n\n\"Young and Healthy,\" you also hear \"Let's Put Out the Lights and Go to Sleep,\" sung by the King, and \"Am I Blue?\"\n\nBosko, Honey; Mar 22;LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Paul Smith. If you were told there was a Bosko car toon with an auto race theme, you\n\nthe polished finish on Bosko's car. Many of the gags are at least original,\n\neven if they're not side-splittingly funny, the best being Bosko's \"tuning up\" of his car as if it were an instru ment and his transformation of a cat\n\ninto a jack to hold his car up when he changes tires. We also get a trio of off beat \"fourth wheel\" substitutions: one\n\ncar hobbling on a crutch where the fourth wheel ought to be, another (piggy)driver using a roll of salamis in place of the tire, and the next carrying the fourth wheel along in a wheelbar row. The villain knocks nearly every car off the road with a well-tossed box\n\nof tacks, but Bosko's car cleverly bites the villain's vehicle on the behind and\n\nzooms ahead to victory! All draped in Harman and Ising's increasingly sophisticated visual style, the cartoon gives us the onslaught of the automobiles from all sorts of inter\n\nesting angles. The villain is even smarmier than usual, so one takes particular pleasure in his downfall. Music:\"Meow.\"\n\nBOSKO'S WOODLAND DAZE\n\nBosko; Mar 22;LT;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Paul Smith. A plotless romp in the forest with Bosko and Bruno. Bruno gets too turned on by certain trees, and Bosko still gets vines and other nasty things dragged across his bottom. There is a Rip Van Winkle-like dream in which gnomes fete him with bubbles rather than booze and a trio of semi-realistic femme fairies harmonize. Bosko lands\n\non a giant piano and performs a vigor ous ragtime solo by waving his hands and feet all about and swimming across the keyboard. All at once, a gruesome giant appears and chases Bosko across\n\nmodern entertainment, shaking his\n\nthe floor of a cave, catches him, and shoves him between two giant slices of bread, dousing him with mustard.\n\n\"little can\"(both the real and the tin one)in a dance that also involves doing\n\nBosko wakes up just in time to grin broadly into the camera for the iris out.\n\nimpressions of Harpo Marx, and Laurel and Hardy and playing two pianos at once. This is followed with a one-man-\n\nBOSKO IN DUTCH\n\nBosko, Honey; Mar 22;LT;Animation by Isadore Freleng and Thomas McKimson.\n\nThe setting dictates the narrative: a duplistic effort, cramming in as many Dutch cliches as possible and, at the same time, offering a full supply of the usual Bosko (albeit doused in Hollandaise sauce). The central scene takes\n\nplace in a windmill instead of the cus tomary cottage, and Bosko and Honey's tap dance is replaced by a woodenshoed clog dance, while their duet is something called \"When It's Tulip Time in Holland.\" This sequence is preceded by an opener with lots of animals-on-ice gags(another little baby duckling who has to go to the outhouse, which is, naturally, a miniature wind mill), followed by an episode in which Bosko rescues two little ice-skating cats that have fallen in a river. For the\n\nrecord, there are no gags concerning Dutch cleanser, Dutch doors, Dutch uncles, Dutch elm disease, my old Dutch or Dutch Reagan. It's up to the viewer to determine if this effort ranks as a Dutch treat or a Dutch cheese.\n\nGoopy Geer makes an unbilled guest appearance, ice-dancing to his theme song. Title music:\"Ach Du Lieber Augustine.\" THE ORGAN GRINDER\n\nApr 8;MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Tom McKimson; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nForeign locales are not the only ones subject to ribbing: here are parodied local American ethnicities, mostly Ital ian-Americans. The Italian organ grinder and his monkey slowly stroll down the street, entertaining the nice people and passing the cup as they go. First, the grinder charms two middleaged housewives who interrupt their washes to sing a refrain or so of the title song. When neighborhood kids crowd around the organ man for cheap thrills, the monkey gets hot with some more\n\nband performance of\"42nd Street\" and ends with a nonmusical interlude\n\nthat becomes musical again, as the\n\nmonkey gets stuck in a car that goes out of control, crashing into an Italian's fruit wagon and a Chinese man deliver\n\ning laundry. Then it lands in a music store, and the monkey and the organ drive out with the car having been transformed into a sort of mobile mechanical orchestra.\n\nBOSKO IN PERSON\n\nBosko, Honey; Apr 10; LT; Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Bob McKimson. Np plot, no setting, no costumes,just Bosko and Honey on stage doing their vaudeville act. It's quite an act, open ing with Bosko at the piano playing his theme,\"Whistle and Blow Your Blues Away\" Honey enters, and the two duet on \"Hello, Baby,\" first as a vocal with Harry Barris-like scat interjections galore, then as a precision tap dance. Next, in an Eddie Cantor up tempo number, Bosko defines his relationship with Honey(\"I Love Her and She Loves Me/And Everything's Okay, You See?\"). Back at the piano, Bosko dem onstrates some tricks that would shame even Chico Marx as he rolls off his\n\nglove and goes into a Senor Wencestype act, the glove bashfully reciting \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" via a squeaky violin for a voice. More com edy: Bosko trying to execute a particu larly difficult shuffle step and landing on his backside. Time for a few quick impressions: Honey, in a sheer, trans parent gown, does Aunt Jemima(Tess Gardella) asking the musical question, \"Was That the Human Thing to Do?\" and Greta Garbo in oversize shoes.\n\nBosko next sticks out his lower lip to do a Chevalier impression (singing, \"Whistle and Blow Your Blues Away\") and affixes a balloon to his nose to\n\nmimic Jimmy Durante(\"I know I'm not good-lookin', folks, but what's my opin ion against a million?\"). Is there no end\n\nto his talents? He grabs a trumpet and plays a hot solo on \"Sweet Georgia\n\nBOSKO'S KNIGHT-MARE\n\nBosko;June 8;LT;Animation by Bob\n\nBrown,\" leaps around the stage in a feat\n\nMcKimson and Robert Stokes.\n\nof acrobatic skill, plays a drum solo with his feet while standing on his\n\nBosko dozes off reading a book of medieval lore and dreams of being a knight in King Arthur's day, although his fantasy includes too much '30 car\n\nhands, swims across the floor while\n\nsimultaneously playing chimes and the whole percussion kit, makes like Ted Lewis in a clarinet solo, buck-andwings into a kettle drum(Honey, mean while, undulates her body and her ton sils and dances in front of strobe\n\nlighting). For a conclusion a bass drum with the image of President Roosevelt holding a stein of beer to celebrate the end of prohibition exits the stage as Honey waves the flag. WAKE UP THE GYPST IN MB\n\nMay 13; MM;Animation by Isadore Freleng and Larry Silverman; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nAlthough Harman studied Pudhovkin, he and Ising probably never realized how well the Merrie Melodies format\n\nsuited Russia as a potential back ground. It's easy to perceive the little guys who gang up on the villain as true Soviet mass-heroes! But that's getting ahead of our story. First, the Russian peasants make merry and do Cossack dances over what is basically 1933style American hot-pop(one of the musicians uses a herring for a balilika pick). A Paul Whiteman caricature leads a few Ruskies in \"Rhapsody in Blue.\" The quartet that sings the title number feels no need for even a minor\n\nbow to authenticity, their number being joined by a little gypsy gal, tambourine in hand. Meanwhile, cut to some antics by funny anarchists instead of funny animals, an assassin who tries to sneak\n\nup on Rice-Pudin' the Mad Monk, who (in addition to playing with a jigsaw puzzle and cheating)in turn has one of his Cossack cronies capture our hero ine. Just as he corners her, he finds that the peasants are revolting (!), and with their hammers and sickles, they oust the Mad Monk from his palace and run him out of town, shoving a bomb in his pants for good measure. The force of the explosion turns him into a Ghandi caricature.\n\ntoon shtick to convince us that Bosko is\n\ncompletely committed. Atop his steed in a suit of armor he gives out with \"Young and Healthy\"(his voice in this one being more tenor than falsetto)and does a rhumba(\"Peanut Vendor\") with\n\nout having to remove his armor. Arriv ing at the castle, he greets his fellow Knights of the Round Table—you know, Groucho, Harpo, Chico, Zeppo, Ed Wynn,Jimmy Durante, Mahatma Ghandi, Oliver Hardy(Bosko obliges with a Stan Laurel impression and a few Cab Calloway slogans). After a few obligatory stanzas of some chivalrous, stately-sounding \"Knights Were Bold,\" Bosko goes into a tap dance to \"42nd Street\" accompanied by various suits of armor, both inhabited and otherwise!\n\nCut to the evil Black Knight trying to get friendly with the damsel-about-tobe-in-distress Honey. She resists(\"Poo! I don't like that old meanie!\"), but the villain comes after her, so she yells for help. Bosko comes running(authentic olde-English dialogue:\"Stop! You mug!\")but the bad guy makes off with her. Bosko follows them to the Black\n\nKnight's, there showering the no-goodnik with bullets from a convenient\n\nmachine gun, but all to no avail. About to be pummelled senseless by his foe, Bosko awakens from his dream.

This follow-up variant to Three's a Crowd,the original books-come-to-life cartoon, has magazine covers(midnight in a magazine rack)replacing literary characters, and villains and famous fic tional characters initiating the every-\n\nbody-gang-up-on-the-bad-guy theme. Cowboys from a western mag (includ ing one with gay guns and another who rides a concertina like a bronco)do the\n\ntitle number, interrupted by gags from Eddie Cantor and Will Rogers. A rela\n\nbeehive into a bagpipe, and they have\n\nluiich, reusing the sandwich sequence from Bosko's Holiday. A wolf stalks the flock. Donning a convenient piece of sheep's clothing, the wolf infiltrates the flock and makes off with a lamb. Bosko\n\ntively realistic ice ballerina skates on a\n\nand Bruno rally to the rescue, chasing\n\nmirror for ice and talcum powder for\n\nthe wolf into a cave. Off-screen a tre\n\nsnow, followed by Hawaiians who dance\n\nthe cover of \"Crime Stories\" loots the\n\nmendous fight ensues, and Bosko comes out carrying the sheep and leav ing us to wonder how Bruno will make out against the wolf. When the figure of the wolf emerges, Bosko thinks the worst has happened. But it turns out to be Bruno wearing the skin, once more faking Bosko out. Ending: both Bruno and the lamb lovingly licking Bosko's\n\ncash register, pursued by Sherlock\n\nface.\n\nHolmes and Watson. Then comes the\n\nBackground music includes the everpopular \"I Like Mountain Music.\"\n\nand sing, \"It's Time to Sing 'Sweet Adeline' Again,\" while a svelte coed in a diaphanous dress from the cover of \"College Rumor\" flirts with a Swiss yodeler from the cover of \"Travel.\"\n\nWhen they get around to the robbery and chase bit, a bunch of fugitives from\n\nworst impression of Edward G. Robin son ever heard. After that, it's every body: squad cars from \"Police\n\nGazette,\" fascist troops under the com mand of Mussolini, and, lastly, the\n\ngiant ape \"Ping Pong\" from \"Screen Play,\" who makes short work of the bad guys, trapping one under the soda\n\nfountain and relentlessly squirting razz-berries at him.\n\nBEAU BOSKO\n\nBosko;July 1; LT; Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Norm Blackburn. Death to the infidels! This is Harman\n\nand Ising's most serious adventure car toon at Warner's, possibly the only one with no singing, dancing, or impres sions, a well-balanced mixture of adventure and comedic elements in a\n\nIHi mmm\n\nForeign Legion setting. We open with a funny series of \"reveille\" gags: the gnarly-looking troops greet their ser geant with an effeminate chorus of \"Good Morning to You,\" Bosko's uni form having to wake him up when he doesn't hear the bugle. In formation. Legionnaire Bosko opens the backpack of the soldier in front of him as it con tains a faucet and sink for him to wash in. The commandant orders Bosko to\n\nBOSKO TBUB SHEEP-HERDER\n\nBosko;June 14; LT; Animation by Roliin Hamilton and Max Maxwell.\n\nHere's a promising premise: Bosko minding a flock of sheep and unable to suppress his urge to use them as musi cal instruments. A few minutes are\n\nused with a little lamb chasing after and devouring a couple of insects(the second is a grasshopper that chews tobacco and uses a flower for a spit toon). Bosko and the lamb frolic. Unaf\n\nraid of the consequences, he converts a\n\napprehend the Desert Scourge, Ali Cop. Bosko mounts his camel and rides into a nearby city. After a bit of local color (they can't resist having a snake indulge in a scat break), Bosko encoun ters Honey in see-through harem-girl garb just in time for Ali Cop and his band of cut-throats to attack the town.\n\nA shoot-out follows, and, though the bullets seem real enough, there's more dropping ceramic jugs on people than bloodshed. Finally, Bosko catches Ali Cop by throwing spears around him that become an ad-hoc cage. We end with Bosko, Honey, and camel carrying off their prisoner.\n\nSHUFFLE OFF TO BUFFALO\n\nopens, and the heads on the coins sing,\n\nJuly 8; MM;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Paul Smith; Music by Frank\n\n\"We are the money.\" A mannequin rolls around the store,\n\nMarsales.\n\nHere's a novel setting: Heaven, although never strictly named as such, the place where babies come from. An Old Man(who could be Father Time)\n\nprocesses the requests for children that come from couples around the world. When Mr. and Mrs. Nanook order a\n\npair of twins, our Old Man retrieves a couple of baby Eskimos from the refrigerator and gives them to the stork (in an upper and lower \"birth\" instead of berth) to carry to the North Pole. The next request, written in Hebrew, is passed along to the stock room. Back comes a little baby with curly black hair and big nose (would you believe \"Abie Baby\"?)on whose diapers he stamps \"Kosher for Passover.\" Together, Old (3oy and Baby duet on the title number(from 42nd Street). Moving into the nursery proper, they're joined by a whole choir of inkblot babies, including a pint-sized Chevalier. Then we see the baby factory in action, with an assembly line operated by bearded gnomes washing, drying, powdering, and diapering the babies. In the nurs ery one gnome tries to appease the yowling brats who demand,\"We want [Eddie]Cantor!\" They get Cantor (doing his Palmy Days razz), and the musical antics including Ed Wynn, \"The Gold Dust Twins\" and a final hot\n\nchorus of\"Shuffle\" by a gnome jazz band for the ecstatic toddlers.\n\naccompanying himself with a trio of mirror images. The dummy then plays every piano in the store, spins around, and finally knocks himself out as he crashes into a shelf, and dozens of hat boxes fall on him.\n\nBUDDY'S DAY OUT\n\nSept 9; LT;Supervision by Tom Palmer; Animation by Bill Mason; Musical Supervision by Norman Spencer and Bernard Brown.\n\nOpening title cards introduce Buddy, our hero; Cookie, his girl; Elmer, the baby; Happy, his dog(credited as \"Buddy's Pal\"). Warner's first cartoon without Harman and Ising is a typi cally crude cartoon of the early '30s. Basic plot: Buddy, Cookie, and friends go on a picnic. Cookie is washing the naked little Elmer; Buddy is washing his car. Cookie shouts,\"Yoo-hoo Buddy, I'm ready!\" Buddy's car goes in reverse, smashing though a greenhouse and covering the car with flowers, which delights Cookie. They travel to the country and set up their picnic. Buddy asks Cookie,\"Wugee, Wugee, Wugee?\"(which must mean \"Wanna neck?\"); Cookie replies,\"No Wugee, Wugee, Wugee! The birds, bees, and frogs are having the same luck. Baby\n\nElmer teases pet Happy and gets food all over himself. Elmer gets into car and accidentally starts it going. Buddy and Cookie chase after it in a baby car riage. The car goes out of control and\n\nWE'RE IN THE MONEY\n\nlands on a railroad track headed\n\nAug 26; MM;Animation by Isadora Freleng and Larry Martin; Music by\n\nstraight for an oncoming train. The baby carriage gains wings after crash ing into a house, and Buddy flies it to the scene. Using a ladder as spare train\n\nFrank Marsales.\n\nAt midnight, the old nightwatchman turns off the lights in the department store and leaves. When he's gone, all the toys come to life, run to the music department, and play, \"We're in the Money.\" There's lots of merriment here: toy soldiers pump air into a trum pet to play it; a beaded doll does a xylophone solo; socks jump rope using shoestrings. Even the store cash register\n\ntrack, he veers the locomotive into a\n\nbarn. Rejoining Elmer, Buddy asks, \"Wugee, Wugee, Wugee?\" The baby squirts him with milk! End title: Buddy says,\"That's all. Folks!\" arising from behind a fence with the \"Looney Tunes\" logo on it. BOSKO THE MUSKETEER\n\nBosko, Honey; Sept 16;LT; Animation\n\nhy RoIIin Hamilton and Robert Stokes. Bosko is a song-and-dance man who flashes back to the France of Alexander Dumas's time. He duels with about four\n\nopponents at once, then heads for the local pub to join his buddies,\"The Three Musketeers\"(so identified by an intertitle), Porthos, Amos, and Andy. Though the Musketeers hold swords, they're good for little more than scat\n\nsinging and quaffing the ale that Bosko pours into their mouths(actually, one drinks it, the second licks his lips, and the third burps). When Bosko has to defend Honey from the usual villain, his pals are nowhere to be found. The fight itself is a highlight: the plume on Bosko's hat is revealed to be part of a live chicken. When the bad guy breaks his sword, he yells for the caddie to come in and replace it, and Bosko fixes his sword point in a pencil sharpener. Bosko finally does him in by hurling hot coals into the seat of his pants. In the wind-up, Bosko and Honey flash forward to the present, and when Honey doesn't believe any of this story, Bosko responds,\"Was you dere, Charlie?\"\n\nWhen Honey cleans the house at the beginning, she dusts off her goldfish and does an impression of Mae West (\"You can be had!\"). In the pub she introduces herself with \"Here I am, you\n\nlucky people!\" her dance looking as if it were lifted from Bosko in Person.\n\nchased by an ax-toting Adolf Hitler. This is only the beginning, Bosko tells us. Next up is a short comedy, \"Haurel & Lardy in 'Spite of Every thing,\"' wherein the title is better than either the gag or the caricatures. Finally, we get the feature presentation, \"T-N-T Pictures Present He Done Her\n\nDirt (And How!).\" Apparently, a gay 90s melodrama, with audience partici pation. For the first part we keep cut ting to Bosko's reaction to the characters and events. Honey rides along on a bicycle, accompanied by the Marx Brothers(again!) as a chorus of admirers sings \"Bicycle Built for Two,\" unknowingly followed by the cur. Dirty\n\nDalton (described by Bosko as' The dirty fox\"). The villain runs off with the girl, shouting,\"Aha! me proud beauty!\" as he takes her on top of a train. She cries for help, and Bosko responds,\"I'll save you!\"He leaps into the screen, and when we expect to have him enter the action a la Buster Keaton\n\nand Sherlock Junior, he tears right through the screen itself, which pro duces the desired effect of stopping the bad guy. I'VE GOT TO SING A TORCH SONG\n\nSept 23; MM;Supervision by Tom Palmer; Animation byJack King; Music by Bernard Brown and Norman Spencer. A gently-satirical paean to the most effective means of world communica\n\nBOSKO'S PICTURE SHOW\n\nBosko; Sept 18; LT; Animation by Isadora Freleng and Max Maxwell.\n\nBosko is a combination organist/emcee for a program of shorts and a feature at a movie house. First, he leads the audi ence in a sing-a-long to \"The Goldigger's Song\"(from Goldiggers of1933) with the lyrics on screen to follow\n\nalong. The program begins with the \"Out-of-Tone News(Sees All—Hears\n\nAll—Smells AID,\" a pretty lame bunch of blackout gags, one being a dog race scene taken from Bosko's Dog Race in which the Marx brothers appear as dog catchers, and one intertitle that announces \"Famous Screen Lover on\n\nEuropean vacation,\" before cutting to a hysterical shot of Jimmy Durante being\n\ntion: commercial radio programming. Hands all over the world turn on their\n\nradios first thing in the morning,from all walks of life; even such world lead ers as Shaw (George Bernard, not Artie) and Mussolini do their exercises\n\nin time to it. Chinese police tune it in and tune it out, African cannibals get ting ready to dine upon Wheeler and Woolsey listen to it for recipes, Arctic whales swim happily to the beat, and Arab sheiks prefer the antics of Amos n' Andy to their scantily-clad harem girls. Movie stars also need the radio. Jimmy Cagney and Joan Blondell push each other around a la Blonde Crazy, Ben Bernie and \"Cros Bingsby\" croon \"Why Can't This Night Go On For ever?\" A gang join forces for the title\n\nGold Diggers of1933 ballad: the Boswell Sisters (closer visually than\n\nBOSKO'S BIECHANICAL HAN Bosko;Sept 27; LT;Animation by\n\nvocally), Garbo (for once they lay off her pedal extremities), Zasu Pitts, and\n\nIsadora Freleng and Thomas\n\nMae West all sing a torch song. Only the ending falls flat, Ed Wynn getting blown through a roof and landing in a\n\nbed containing his Wynn-like wife and kiddies.\n\nTHE DISH RAN AWAY WITH THE SPOON\n\nSept 24; MM;Animation by Rollin Hamilton and Bob McKimson; Music by Frank Marsales.\n\nHere the cast consists of chinaware and\n\ncutlery. We open on the happy little plates and silverware swimming and bathing in the sink, washing the soap off in meat grinders, using seltzer as showers, and drying themselves in a waffle iron and a toaster. A bushy dus ter uses a case of knives as a piano; ceramic salt, pepper, and sugar shakers sing in a trio. Mister Spoon proposes to Miss Dish in song (using \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\"). When she accepts, he expresses his rapture by playing a per cussion solo on a row of baking tins as a chorus line of tea cups dances, and a bottle of bluing,joined by a potato with tears in all of his eyes, sings\"Am I Blue.\" If that isn't enough, an egg falls and breaks, releasing a newborn chick, which sings,\"Young and Healthy.\" Revelry is interrupted by a doughy behemoth who consumes yeast to make\n\nhim grow and tries to make off with the dishy heroine. Then it's the usual col lective heroism, lots of little guys gang\n\ning up on the big bad guy. In this case, dishes throw other dishes at the mon\n\nster, graters grate at him, other utensils hurl popcorn missiles and flatten him with a rolling pin. Eventually, he falls into an electric fan that chops him up and distributes the dough into tins for\n\nbaking cookies and cakes. All the kitchen characters cheer as Mister\n\nSpoon rakes,\n\nMcKimson. This was Warner's entry in the cycle\n\n| I ' |\n\nof '30s robo-toons, following on the heels of Fleischer's The Robot(1932),\n\nIwerk's Techno-Cracked,(1933)and Disney's Mickey's Mechanical Man (1933). There was also a sub-cycle of robot cow cartoons, including Lantz's Mechanical Cow (1932)and Clampett's Porky's Poppa(1938). \"Oh, Bosko, you fulfill my wishes,\" Honey tells Bosko,\"You're just in time to do the dishes!\" They wash and dry the chinaware(Honey trying to sing \"Ain't We Got Fun\" but forgetting the words). Bosko winds up dropping and\n\nbreaking the entire lot. Undaunted, he stumbles across a newspaper that head lines, \"Robot Will Do Work of Hundred Men Say Technocrats,\" which gives him the idea of building a mechanical man out of pipe and a pot bellied stove, powered by an automo bile engine. Unlike most other cartoon Frankensteins, this one doesn't even wait for something to happen before it\n\ngoes on a berserk rampage. Bosko and Honey are occasionally able to pacify the monster through musical means. At one point. Honey turns it gay by spray ing it with perfume, causing it to exclaim \"Oh swish!\" do a little spring dance with a roll of toilet paper. Soon it's chasing Bosko and Honey all over the place. Honey inserts a phonograph and record of\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" into its hollow torso, which\n\nworks until the record skips! It chases\n\nBosko and Honey out of the house and down the street, finding time to elec trocute Bruno on the way. Bosko finally\n\nstops the monster by hurling a load of explosives into its open mouth. The final Harman-lsing film for Warner's, this was certainly a respecta\n\nble showing, with enough good gags and spirit to make up for trend-follow ing unoriginality. A peppy sound track contains \"One Step Ahead of My Shadow,\"\"From Me to You,\"\"1 Like Mountain Music,\" \"Let's Put Out the Lights and Go to Sleep.\"\n\nBUDDY'S BEER GARDEN\n\nBuddy; Nov 11;LT;Supervision by Earl Duvall; Animation byJack King and Tish Tash; Music by Norman Spencer. What better way to celebrate the end of Prohibition than with your favorite car toon character adopting a German accent and passing out huge steins of beer to customers, with a dachshund serving pretzels? While a tough cus tomer downs one glass after another, the evening's entertainment includes a\n\nGerman band playing oom-pah\n\nat the poster of\"Mile. Cookie, the Showboat Star.\" Buddy calls Cookie and kisses her through the phone wires. When the deckhand tries the same\n\nthing, the phone slaps him. At showtime. Buddy and Cookie per form \"Under My Umbrella,\" and do a soft-shoe routine while a chorus line of\n\nscantily clad dancers high kicks. Buddy then presents the next act.
