        "text": "This true-crime documentary on '90s-era serial robber Scott Scurlock, nicknamed \"Hollywood\" (for his penchant for ideas from movies like a latex Richard Nixon mask from \"Point Break\") challenges a lot of popular notions, including the Robin Hood trope (i.e., taking from the rich to give to the poor, an idiotic notion according to his accomplices Steve Myers & Mark Biggins, along with friends & relatives who knew him best). Because somebody has fancied himself a hippie environmentalist (living in his elaborate, remote treehouse) and had donated some of his filthy lucre to \"Earth First\" in support of the banning (or at least, the limiting) of logging in the Pacific NW, uh, does not a modern-day Robin Hood make! I heard that he may even have loaned his friends some funds in a pinch, but so they'd owe him future favors! This may seem an obvious point, but the success (and odd-to-me, the on-going popularity) of the meth-amphetamine producing character, Walter White, in \"Breaking Bad\" means documentaries such as this one must now make all of these obvious points both crystal clear in a perfectly overt manner. Still, some reviewers are posting that this movie tries to make a hero out of Scott Scurlock; I would argue that we hear and see someone tortured by the vicissitudes of modern life, including its rejection of (and frankly total contempt for) nature, and its absurd, limitless worship of capitalism (which, by robbing at least 19 banks over 4 yrs, he thoroughly inanely and naively perpetuated!). So, whether you believe the official Seattle PD story of one single shot ringing out from the camper as Scott committed suicide, or you believe the subsequent barrage of 76 bullets riddling it (and the two-hour \"stand-off\" with a dead guy?) may have had as much or more to do with his death, it's surely an inevitable but not a happy ending. Overall, I rate this a 7 out of a maximum 10 stars.\n\nTrue crime doc based on a string of bank robberies in 90s Seattle, this is a decent show coming in at 86 mins. Anything more would have been too drawn out, glad they decided not to go the three episode route with this story.\n\nThere's not much to watch visually; while there are some old clips and photos used, the doc mainly uses old audio and interviews from the present time. Several motion posters have also been used. So, you can either play it in the background or if you'd rather 'watch this as a podcast', that'll work too. If you have 1.5 hrs to spare and aren't sure what watch as a true crime content enthusiast, this should be on your list.\n\nI wonder if Netflix true crime docs are all beginning to look and sound the same.\n\nA very good crime documentary, and a story that holds you from start to finish. From Olympia, Washington, home of Nirvana and grunge music, the bank robber dubbed \"Hollywood\" was born.\n\nAfter reading Ann Rule's book \"The End of the Dream, The Golden Boy Who Never Grew Up\" I was fascinated with the story of Scott Scurlock and his band of merry cohorts. You can learn how his friends grew to love him and were prepared to be a part of his plans. Much more in depth, especially his early years in college. I don't condone what he did by any stretch of the imagination, but his story is a very compelling one."
