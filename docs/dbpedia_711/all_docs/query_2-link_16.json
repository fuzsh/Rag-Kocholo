        "text": "SNAFU: The Goldbrick (1943)\n\nDirector: Frank Tashlin.\n\nRelease date: September 1943.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Snafu / Goldie the Goldbrick).\n\nMusic: Carl Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown.\n\nSynopsis: Fed up of his daily routine - a fairy appears and encourages Snafu to goldbrick from his duties.\n\nAnimation by Cal Dalton.\n\nLike Gripes, this short is based primarily on the importance on army duties. While Snafu previously griped about army training by wishing to change the system - here, his desires are to simply avoid his duties lazily. Snafu is a solid representation of army soldiers who don't fully understand the purpose of war duties - making him homesick of comfort and luxury.\n\nThe short's opening scene briskly but clearly represents his loathing for duties. The scene opens with a peaceful Snafu snoring away in his bed - complete with a visual gag of Snafu's snores blowing up a pinup poster of a woman's dress, revealing her blouse. An unseen cadet blows his bugle into Snafu's ear - awakening him with force and disturbance.\n\nAwake, Snafu complains \"Another day, nuts! If I could only get out of drill.\" At this moment, a drill fairy puffs into appearance, but bears a chunkier resemblance of the Technical Fairy. The fairy introduces himself as Goldie the Goldbrick, with visual puns to show he has a \"heart of gold\" (made of 14 karats), and a \"backside of lead\". Could you trust a fairy whose body is made up of chemical elements?\n\nGoldie then entices Snafu to goldbrick, in a song sequence that parodies the song, Tit Willow, from the Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Mikado. It's fascinating to see how Carl Stalling could apply different ranges of musical songs into the Snafu cartoons, that was otherwise not featured in his Warner Bros. cartoon scores.\n\nThe parody lyrics, possibly written by Theodore Geisel, are witty with a lazy-like quality that could easily get Snafu in the mood.\n\nThe song follows into a montage sequence that supposedly benefits the possibility of goldbricking - such as laying in a sick bay, or finding a stooge to carry out Snafu's duties for him.\n\nFrank Tashlin uses the montage effectively with his great use of mise en scene and composition, as seen at the sick bay scene. The scene features a silhouette of army recruits marching in a rainstorm, underneath a macabre atmosphere. The camera trucks back to reveal a comfortable Snafu lying in bed, as he's cared for by an attractive nurse. It's a great use o pathetic fallacy set outside in comparison to a more homely, warm hospital bay - achieved by innovative layout work and Tashlin's great judgement in directing.\n\nOnce Snafu is ready for combat - time passes by where he is fighting in a Southern Pacific island. Frank Tashlin's cinematic touches fit appropriately with this sequence. For cartoon animation, he's very daring by experimenting lighting and composition. It's also clear that Tashlin takes inspiration from film-noir movies that took the Hollywood industry by storm in the early 1940s, utilising such styles of the genre like low-key lighting.\n\nIn several long-shots, soldiers are seen running up a hill, whilst exploding gun shots and explosives in their way - all achieved in silhouette. It's fascinating to see how Frank Tashlin (as well as the other directors at Schlesinger) were still at the top of their game - even when they had to work extra on Snafu cartoons to fit into the studio's curriculum and schedule.\n\nTashlin's unit also apply the stark contrasts of black-and-white very intelligently and subtly. In a scene of a tired Snafu climbing the hill, Goldie reappears in silhouetted form but within a luminous glow.\n\nHe further reminds Snafu to goldbrick, while in combat - which is the start of Snafu's undoing. Not only is the use of black-and-white applied appropriately, but a silhouetted appearance of Goldie also calls for visual appeal. And so, Snafu decides to goldbrick inside an unsuspecting hospital trap; set up by the \"honourable\" Japanese army. As he bunks on the bed - a hand device marks a cross on Snafu's helmet, which is followed by a mallet that strikes Snafu's helmet down to his waddling feet.\n\nAnd so, Snafu is ambushed by an incoming Japanese tank, adorned by the Rising Sun symbol. In an attempt to save himself by digging up a trench; Goldie reappears and corrupts his mind by goldbricking on the digging, to only \"dig a few inches and crawl in and sleep.\" Goldie's ideas of slack grows hilariously absurd throughout the cartoon, to the point where digging a trench for defence doesn't require effort whatsoever.\n\nAfter only a digging a few inches and falling asleep, Snafu's rear end is still sticking about; noticeable enough for a Japanese tank to ruthlessly crush it to his death. Tashlin's timing and visual presentation of Snafu's death is innovative, by portraying a cloud of dust that unveils to reveal Snafu's grave.\n\nGoldie appears atop of Snafu's tombstone. He removes his mask, revealing himself to be a caricatured Tojo in disguise. In his finishing words, he sings: \"Here lies the goldbrick / I now go find more. If find enough goldbrick / Japan could win war!\".\n\nFor a cartoon ending that's built on morales - it's entirely built around dark comedy. Snafu's mistakes is so severe, that he doesn't get the chance to learn from it; making the overall ending morale rather biting in context. It's a nice little use of irony from an American perspective to present a Japanese victory in a derogatory fashion. I'm sure the army recruits had second thoughts on goldbricking upon seeing this Snafu short.\n\nIn comparison to Snafu's Gripes, the short is an articulately funny portrayal on an army soldier's desire for comfort. Desire is crucial for an individual aiming for something, but Snafu is after the wrong desires. The Snafu cartoons are not only brilliant in providing sharp lessons to recruits via comic timing and adult humour, but they also excellently (and exaggeratedly) portray the worst consequences possible. This cartoon is a prime example of that. The cartoon's ending represents the utmost liberties the Schlesinger studio had from studio censors. Not only is the dark comedy used so savagely, but I'm sure Production Code censors would've heavily frowned upon on a Japanese victory - that's only applied as a potential threat if army recruits try to go the same way as Snafu.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSinkin' in the Bathtub revisited...\n\nI've completely revised the first Looney Tune cartoon, Sinkin' in the Bathtub, which you can now view here. I'm hoping to improve the quality of my very old posts, to keep it up to standards - alongside my current reviews, of course. I've been wanting to do this for quite some time. Further reasons are explained in the post.\n\n↧\n\nSNAFU: The Infantry Blues (1943)\n\nDirector: Chuck Jones.\n\nRelease date: September 1943.\n\nVoices: Mel Blanc (Private Snafu / Technical Fairy).\n\nMusic:Carl Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown.\n\nSynopsis:As Private Snafu complains about being assigned to infantry. With help from the Technical Fairy, Snafu's new duties such as fleet or tank duty turn out to have different kinds of challenges.\n\nGrumbling and complaining about his war duties - wasn't it a one time formula on Gripes or The Goldbrick? Quite the contrary. One of Private Snafu's characteristic traits involves dissatisfaction and little understanding of the importance of duty - especially in a time of war. As mentioned beforehand, Snafu is a key example of not only showing incompetence whenever training or in combat; but also his lack of understanding on the army.\n\nThe Infantry Blues is another Snafu cartoon that's part of the assembly line on griping Snafu shorts. Snafu expresses desire for change - with the Technical Fairy to respond to his wishes. Snafu experiences his impractical fantasy that eventually leads to disaster.\n\nThis short, on the other hand takes a slightly different turn on Snafu's mistakes that becomes a nice change for the Snafu series. Chuck Jones has the highest output for Snafu cartoon than any other Warners director and yet he provides his versatility in this Snafu short alongside his regular Warner Bros. work.\n\nIn my previous review on The Goldbrick, I spoke very highly of Frank Tashlin's understanding of shot composition and colour. Chuck Jones' dynamic ideas on Snafu's opening exposition are on par with Tashlin's creativity. For example, the opening shot of an assembly line of soldiers marching features strong silhouette. The silhouette of Snafu struggling behind, reads clearly by contrasting fit soldiers against sleazy Snafu.\n\nThe camera trucks in on Snafu's slumpy walk - followed by a double-exposed shadow of Snafu's enlarged face, expressing resent towards his physical duties. Not only is the layout compelling in visual style; but it's an unorthodox portrayal of expressing emotion and melancholy in Snafu.\n\nTheodore Geisel's use of wit and rhyme works alongside his frustrations as said: \"Oh, the air force gets the glory an' the Navy gets the cheers. / But all the dogface ever gets is mud behind ears.\"\n\nSnafu's complaints are dragged out in an entertaining montage of the private's journey travelling through walls of snow, and treacherous jungles. In one gag, Snafu walks past a steep river, but comes out inside a crocodile's belly. While the gag itself has been used several times in animated shorts (Major Lied Till Dawn comes to mind); it's a funny portrayal on the burden Snafu has to suffer from being \"dogface\" - a military slang for a U.S. foot soldier during World War II. Although Snafu has griped previously on duty - he complaining about the disdain he feels about infantry; in contrast to the navy or the air force; which he sees as more honourable positions.\n\nOnce Snafu discovers that the nearest rest room happens to be a 18,000 mile trek - Snafu immediately expresses desire to change his army duties to the tank corp. Why would Snafu wait another 18,000 mile while he has an opportunity to use an empty pathway as a toilet? Perhaps Snafu's too stupid to think that way.\n\nSo, the Technical Fairy appears and answers to Snafu's wish to switch corps. The Fairy's incantation is a pretty amusing parody of the Sold American jingle, which finishes with: \"Sold to the tank corp.\" The fairy shouts out the spell each time Snafu wishes to change corps throughout the short. It also works as a nice little personal touch from the Schlesinger studio.\n\nSnafu's first exposure with the tank corps allows Chuck the opportunity to go broad with his comic timing and posing. To start off, Snafu expresses satisfaction of his tank riding through a smooth trail. Unbeknownst to Snafu, the tank jumps across treachery rocks causing him to bump vigorously inside the tank.\n\nA close-up of Snafu reveals his eyes jumping all over the upper half of face - which is surprisingly very broad of Chuck Jones. The gag is then topped with more hilariously executed bumping action on Snafu.\n\nIt's an example on how Chuck had improved so much in achieving better comedy, and showing the ability to explore broader gags. I can't imagine him allowing a shot like that pass in a lavish Sniffles cartoon, only a few years earlier.\n\nThe military tank shots are wonderfully executed too, not just in timing but in animated form. Animating vehicles is a challenge; but to see squash and stretch applies to the tank skidding to the edge of a cliff, and balancing perilously at the edge creates a beautiful result. The layout work of Snafu climbing out of the cannon, and hopelessly holding onto the edge is great in capturing perspective. Unimpressed by the dangerous duties of the tank corp, the Technical Fairy arrives to reassign Snafu to the navy.\n\nOnce again - Snafu expresses further satisfaction towards the navy, as said: \"Heave ho, me hearties - you're home for the open sea / This is twice as easy as the poor old infantry.\" And so, Snafu underestimates the burden of being a navy sailor. War-time threats for the navy like Kamikaze pilots or torpedo submarines are deliberately left out - while the perilous aspects are focused on nature.\n\nSnafu experiences another bumpy ride as his vessel skimps across choppy waves. This leads to Snafu being washed out of the ship, and water-skiing by standing on a pair of fish. The sequence largely consists of effects animation, which is more ambitious than character animation. The effects work such as water, are effective enough to enhance the dangers of naval services.\n\nDr. Seuss cleverly inserts a pun of Snafu shouting, \"Give me air!\", after coughing up sea water - once again dismissing the notion of working in the navy. At the arrival of the Technical Fairy - Snafu is once again reassigned to the air corp.\n\nBased on his previous discomfort with the tank corp and the navy; Snafu establishes his own comfort flying an airplane - which he considers \"the softest job of all.\" However, Snafu's incompetence makes the air corp a very difficult for him. He drives the plane with great speed - to the point where he travels above Earth, beyond his control.\n\nThe sequence calls for some daring layout work, such as the use of vertical pans as well as a close-up of Snafu's plane turning upside down. Jones' use of fast-cutting also works effectively in creating the atmosphere of fear from Snafu's perspective.\n\nLike the tank gag; Chuck's unit effortlessly pull of animated gags such as the plane twisting into knots, and unwinding itself. Snafu's plane leads him to fall back to Earth, and crashing onto the summit of a pointy mountain. Snafu falls off his damaged aircraft, and lands right back to where he was originally: a 18'000 mile restroom sign.\n\nWith the return of the Technical Fairy; Snafu has a change of opinion, and he reforms back into his infantry duty. Snafu's morale has proven that all wartime services have their own difficulties - however different they may be. And so, Snafu happily marches on; marching with pride to the service he feels fit for.\n\nWhile we're used to watching Snafu end up in tragedy from his mistakes; this is a rare occurrence of Snafu learning from his errors without proving fatal. The short ends on a more light-hearted approach compared to the dark comedy that's set around the Snafu series - which is a nice change. It's one of a few occurrences where a light-hearted ending in a Snafu cartoon is actually called for.\n\nThe Infantry Blues is not only built on a solid morale; but it's also a clear presentation on how each military service having their own individual hardships. Snafu experiences each perils; and is given the chance to change his mind before it's too late. Not only does Chuck Jones pull it off comedically; but also ambitiously. The perils and hazards are done justice through inventive layouts, and Jones' timing. It's still astounding to see how Chuck could still produce high quality material, despite the Snafu shorts being extra credit to their schedule.\n\n↧\n\n413. A Corny Concerto (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 412.\n\nRelease date: September 25, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Bob Clampett.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Arthur Q. Bryan (Elmer Fudd), Bob Clampett (Vocal effects). (Thanks Keith Scott).\n\nStory: Frank Tashlin.\n\nAnimation: Bob McKimson.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Parodying Fantasia, Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig perform ballet; followed by a musical story about an ugly duckling.\n\nDisney's Fantasia became controversial since it first opened at New York in November 1940. Critics were polarised by the film. Some praised Walt Disney for making \"motion picture history\", while others critics associated with classical musical roots, openly criticised it. Soon enough, Fantasia proved a disappointment at the box office. It was without a doubt, Disney's most ambitious feature at the time, while some argue it was Walt at his most pretentious. Ambitious or pretentious (I personally love it), it held quite an impact amongst the Schlesinger staff - so much so that they went on to parody the film - using two infamous pieces of music by Johann Strauss - Tales from the Vienna Woods and Blue Danube.\n\nIt so happens that Frank Tashlin is credited for story work in this cartoon. Tashlin spent some years at the Disney Studios during the late 30s, but left in 1941 after a quarrel with Walt. He returned to the Schlesinger Studio in September 1942 in the story department, before taking over Norm McCabe's unit. A part of myself suspects whether or not Tashlin wrote the cartoon as a snide towards Disney?\n\nWhile Tashlin may have blueprinted the cartoon, the feat had to be met by a director with a great understanding of classical music, and how to combine it within animation. One would suspect Friz Freleng would be equal to the task, which I don't doubt, but instead the short fell into the hands of Bob Clampett.\n\n\"Fantasia\" - except in Clampett style.\n\nClampett has directed several cartoons beforehand which were heavily themed on music - like his success with Coal Black. According to Bob Clampett in Michael Barrier's 1973 interview with Wilfred Jackson, Bob attended the Carthay Circle Theatre premiere of Fantasia, and vividly recalled the audience's reactions to the use of Fantasound: \"the whole audience [at the Carthay Circle] kind of gasped, or oohed and ahhed.\"\n\nWhile other Schlesinger employees may have attended the Fantasia roadshows - it appears Bob Clampett was the right candidate to take on the parody.\n\nFor the most part; Clampett's parody of the Disney masterpiece is well executed right down to the frame. Clampett's excellent use of parody couldn't have been more perfectly fulfilled by casting Elmer Fudd as Deems Taylor. Not only is Elmer the perfect option as far as speech-impediment exploitation goes, but both he and Taylor have similar looks - with a five o'clock shadow and glasses for the right touches. Fudd could easily pass as Deems Taylor's animated counterpart.\n\nThe scene begins with an establishing shot of a sound stage orchestra - with colour styling and staging almost comparable to Fantasia. Clampett applies a great gag of a large shadow walking up to the podium - suggesting a well-built person is about to make an appearance. Then, the shadow reveals to be meek Elmer Fudd. It's a great gag that contrasts size and personality comedically.\n\nClampett applies some charming touches to Elmer's awkward personality. Elmer announces to the audience of an orchestration of Johann Strauss'Tales from the Vienna Woods - but at the same time, Elmer has difficulty of keeping control of his tuxedo shirt, which constantly springs out from his tucked in suit.\n\nElmer's tuxedo shirt becomes a great annoyance of Elmer; that he tears it apart. Later on, when Elmer introduces the Blue Danube - Elmer finds new difficulty with his pants - which drops at its own accord. Both Bob McKimson and Rod Scribner were assigned the animation of Elmer's scenes - and both excel in capturing the timing and humanistic approach of Elmer's embarrassment.\n\nArthur Q. Bryan's vocal delivery is sublime, especially his use of awkward laughter, and the classic line, (quoting the popular song The Music Goes Round and Round): \"Wisten to the wippwing whythm of the woodwinds, as it wolls awound and awound, and it comes out here...\". Personally, I wish the cartoon ended, after the Blue Danube segment with another payoff of Elmer struggling with his starched tuxedo. So much potential for so little time.\n\nClampett's unit also come close to matching the beautiful artwork and colour styling that embellished Fantasia. A lot of it appears throughout the cartoon; but its most revealing for the introduction shots of each musical score. The opening pan shot of Vienna Woods, featuring a stylised woodlands background holds as a reflection to the elaborate Multiplane camera shots in the feature.\n\nDespite budget constraints from a studio that couldn't afford to build a camera as elaborate as Multiplane, or let alone, shoot entire pencil tests; Johnny Burton's camera department achieved the effect by using an overlay which was moved by the cameraman differently from the background.\n\nOne of the more subtle references to Fantasia appears during the title card of the Blue Danube. The titles are followed by a falling flower landing in water - creating a beautiful ripple effect. The scene itself is lifted from The Nutcracker Suite segment in Fantasia; so it's nice to see Clampett subtly insert a reference without a forced gag in sight. It's a rare privilege to see how artistic and lavish how the Schlesinger studio could be - evident of the meticulous ink and paint work on the flower. The colour styling, probably by Mike Sasanoff, is also comparable to the Disney feature - as Sasanoff's work expresses a carefree quality, too.\n\nExcluding Elmer Fudd's scenes; the remainder of the cartoon is dialogue-free - save from the occasional vocal effects provided by Bob Clampett. This is already established in the opening scenes of Porky Pig as a hunter in the Vienna Woods segment. The premise is a throwback to the early Bugs Bunny cartoons, that followed a hunter pursuing rabbits. While Elmer Fudd might've been more suitable for the role; Porky Pig is cast instead.\n\nVisual pantomime plays a key role within the cartoon; but sometimes Clampett would cleverly insert sign gags, like Porky Pig holding a sign, reading: \"I'm hunting that (explicit) rabbit.\"\n\nNot only does pantomime allow other forms of communications, but it works as a funny parody; mocking the sophisticated Fantasia, by being unsophisticated - such as suggested blasphemy on the sign.\n\nDeliberately, Clampett creates a clash between fantasy and reality; as he doesn't hesitate to include cultural references, such as an Emily Post etiquette book. Porky's hunting dog points towards Bugs Bunny's rabbit hole; but Bugs opens the book to a certain page which bears the pun: \"It ain't polite to point!\".\n\nFor the most part, Clampett articulately takes advantage of animated action to the classical music - tenderly and comedically. Clampett's skill is evident at the opening segment of the Blue Danube. The waltz has been parodied several times in animated cartoons, and it certainly never lost its popularity overtime. In popular culture it's widely recognisable today for its usage in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nThe staging might seem a little jarring in\n\nthis frame grab, but thankfully, the scene\n\nflows without being too noticeable for\n\nthe average viewer.\n\nLike the previous segment, the premise is also kept facile: an ugly duckling tale - featuring a black duck, who closely resembles a baby Daffy Duck. The opening scene features a mother swan and her baby cygnets; swimming in a lagoon, as well as quacking in synchronisation to the music's most memorable motif.\n\nThe layout staging of this scene is a tad sloppy and not well coordinated (at several points, the swans appear to swim through a tree or a piece of grass). However, the beautiful timing of the swans moving in tempo to the music as well as the charming use of quack sound effects makes up for it.\n\nClampett's sense of creativity and timing is used to its fullest advantage of baby Daffy, following the flock underwater. Bubbles arise at the surface, popping in synchronisation to Strauss' elaborate piece. It's also ambitious to pull off the timing by relying on effects animation, and Treg Brown's sound effects. The gag is topped in some hysterically loose animation by Rod Scribner of the mother reacting to the bubbles arising underneath her.\n\nAnimation by Bob McKimson.\n\nDespite the challenges of finding an appropriate story that could be taken advantage of by classical music; extra elements are added to the Blue Danube segment like developed characters, to make the action more compelling. Daffy Duck as an ugly duckling is established enough as an outcast; making it more beneficial for gags.\n\nIn a scene of the vulture kidnapping the cygnets one by one; Daffy arrives last from the flock - only to be thrown away by the vulture. Clampett provides added character to the scenario as a 4F rating is plunged on Daffy's rear end.\n\nDaffy's relationship with the mother swan expresses some humanistic qualities; such as the mother's disapproval of an outcast joining the family. Early on in several closeups; the mother glares at Daffy disapprovingly until she strikes the duckling out of her sight.\n\nThe mother's neglect of the Daffy duckling is briefly but hilariously executed in one energetic sequence. Leading to the segment's crisis; the mother swan has discovered her cygnets are missing. She reacts in a panic-stricken state; with unparalleled energy made justice through smear animation.\n\nAt one point, she picks up a big rock, and finds the Daffy duckling sitting underneath it - only to slam the rock on top of him again until she faints. Not only is the delivery nailed right down to the timing and vast energy, but also based on how subtle it is. Their share of eye contact is very brief, adding extra personality to the judgemental mother.\n\nApplying sound effects would've be an obvious violation to Fantasia - with only two exceptions heard in the Dance of the Hours segment. Nevertheless, it never went as broad as Treg Brown's marvellous effects.\n\nBrown sporadically is given the feat of applying sound effects in synchronisation of both of Strauss' pieces. For one scene in the Vienna Woods segment, Bugs Bunny is heard munching carrots until he places his foot on the pedal of a rubbish bin, and disposing the finished carrot.\n\nOther places, applying cartoon sound effects is almost logical. In one scene, the vulture's hand lurks behind a rock; kidnapping the cygnets - with a \"whish\" anticipation effect applied in rhythm to the Blue Danube. One of them is even propelled an outboard motor, indicating slack.\n\nWhile sound effects are applied to deliberately parody the artistically demanding Fantasia, Clampett and Tashlin are faithful enough to its source material that dialogue isn't exchanged at all during the segments.\n\nInstead, Clampett cheats a little by applying his own voice effects (based on Keith Scott's research) on some comedic scenes. In a scene of Bugs Bunny supposedly dead; Porky's dog is heard bawling as he brings out his first aid bag. In one scene of the Blue Danube segment; the vulture shakes pepper on each individual cygnet. One cygnet is about to anticipate a large sneeze fit, but the vulture's finger holds her nose momentarily. Afterwards, the cygnet sneezes very lightly. Rod Scribner's tour-de-force character animation blends well of a seemingly huge build-up of a sneeze, that's ends deliberately anti-climatic.\n\nTo pull off a Fantasia parody convincingly; one must observe the film and divert what goes with it. So, applying cartoon sounds into classical music creates a funny juxtaposition - whilst still maintaining an artistic quality.\n\nAlthough Bob Clampett pulls off music timing, for the most part, at times he doesn't take advantage of it completely. Had Friz Freleng directed the cartoon, he'd meticulously find methods to incorporate animated action to fit with classical music, without any minor exceptions that may feel less tangible.\n\nOnly Clampett could pull off a dangerously\n\nflexible gun gag; and yet the anticipation\n\nfeels real!\n\nAt times, Clampett appears to struggle to fulfil that completely - especially in elements of the Vienna Woods segment. In one scene, (animated by Virgil Ross) Bugs Bunny has some fun with Porky's dog, by tying its tail to a tree as he runs off. The music is played in a fast-paced fashion, but the movement doesn't blend as solidly as other parts of the piece.\n\nLater on in the segment, an angry squirrel fires his gun towards Bugs, Porky and the hound. This is followed by a melodramatic, hammy performance of Porky, Bugs and dog supposedly reacting to a gunshot wound.\n\nPorky and his hound discover they're wound free - whilst Bugs Bunny supposedly discovers his own wound and collapses - with his \"corpse\" looking like squeezed toothpaste.\n\nAlthough Rod Scribner never fails to pull off a funny acting performance; again, the music feels out of place compared to the cartoon action - with an exception being Bugs pirouetting next to the dog. The atmosphere feels wrong, unless Clampett deliberately depicted it that way - but either way his intentions aren't fully realised. Conceiving gags to fit with piece music is difficult enough so direction-wise, you've got to give Clampett credit for trying.\n\nTo some extent, at times Clampett gets a little carried away, not only in consistency, but also in taste. At the end of the Vienna Woods segment, Porky attempts to undo the fingers around a mortally wounded Bugs' chest. He pulls them apart, to reveal an exposed bra - riddled with Clampett's risque humour of Bugs shrieking horrifically as sexual harassment is implied.\n\nBugs finds himself in ballerina forms, slaps Porky and ties his bra on Porky and his hound's head, before he pirouettes away into the distance - and collapses as the finale draws to a finish.\n\nA favourite amongst Clampett fans for its shock value, the gag is too crude and juvenile for my liking. Bob was much funnier when he was subtle in his approach - at least for me, anyway.\n\nFor the climax during the Blue Danube segment; Clampett goes a tad too far in a sequence of the Daffy Duck duckling pursuing the vulture kidnapper. While wartime references such as Daffy momentarily morphing into a P-40 Warhawk fighter work; the chase scenes feels too much like a farce that feels like its sidetracking from the musical piece.\n\nIn Clampett fashion, the vulture falls from a cloud after Daffy provides him a barrel of TNT; which results in his demise and ascendent to heaven. The overall cartoon finishes with the baby Daffy Duck finally accepted into the mother's family - as they quack away happily to Blue Danube.\n\nFor what it's worth, A Corny Concerto is a milestone in Warner's history. For the first time, several star characters appear within the same cartoon - Bugs, Porky, Elmer and arguably Daffy. The studio, by that point, had established their stars to popularity and recognition. A parody of a feature as grand as Fantasia welcomed the opportunity to use their main stars altogether. This trend would appear several more times in later shorts like The Scarlet Pumpernickel or Beanstalk Bunny. Bob Clampett showcases his versatility not only for his energetic timing, but also his ability to time musical classic into animation - which he executes well. While Clampett uses the opportunity to recreate the artistic spirit of the Disney film; he never overlooks entertainment values which are all put to great use. Clampett might not be as skilled at timing music compared to Friz Freleng, but he approaches the challenge well, making it a fine effort for what it is.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.\n\n↧\n\nSNAFU: Fighting Tools (1943)\n\nDirector: Bob Clampett.\n\nRelease date: October 1943.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Snafu / various voices).\n\nMusic: Carl Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Private Snafu brags about the U.S. having the greatest artillery, if properly cared. Once he approaches a Nazi - Snafu's incompetence and poor handling of fighting tools becomes unpromising.\n\nTo some extent, the cartoon is both propaganda and satirical. It has propaganda elements incorporated into it - such as: a U.S. front headline bragging about their soldiers having the best artillery in the world. However, there is a hint of honesty in the article - perhaps, to prevent unwanted arrogance from army recruits. It's reported that the U.S.'s fighting tools are superior - but only if they're handled properly. Bob Clampett has Private Snafu as a guide on how to screw up.\n\nThe propaganda tendencies are fairly deliberate - in order for satirical sequences of Snafu's arrogance and incompetence. Watch out for the small Hitler suicide headline on the front page, a hidden gag which Clampett appeared to take pride with - by using it previously on Tortoise Wins By a Hare and again in What's Cookin, Doc?\n\nBob Clampett applies an attractive montage of the different fighting tools the U.S. army have - with images of the artillery split between illustrations and photographs. Although the effect was used for propaganda purposes, it's a intentional setup on how Private Snafu would react to the news - with arrogance.\n\nIndeed he does, the scene cuts to animated form of Snafu bunking in his tent reading the same newspaper. The ultimate comedy of errors sings with pride and arrogance, \"I'll be the world's greatest hero - with these guns, I've have nuthin' to fear-o!\". Throughout the short, Dr. Seuss' rhyming scheme is sung in the style of The Gay Caballero. A part of me ponders on whether the choice of melody was Clampett's or Theodore Geisel's vision.\n\nThe following scene cuts to a shot of Snafu's tent - surrounded by various fighting tools - like his gun and cannon, indicating his assurance of safety and invincibility. The scene features beautiful posing and animation acting by Schlesinger's master animator Bob McKimson.\n\nMeanwhile, a mean looking Nazi soldier is crawling across the field, with a hand grenade attached to his hand. His offended reaction to Snafu's line: \"My wonderful guns, will moider dem bums! / an' I'll bury them in their latrin-o!\" is priceless in both caricature and exaggeration.\n\nOnce Snafu finishes his little song, he senses presence in the wilderness and pulls his shotgun digged in soil - the first sign of inadequate care on weaponry. Similar to Chuck Jones'The Infantry Blues, a comedy rule of three is utilised throughout this cartoon to showcase Snafu's incompetence and his struggle to maintain his confidence.\n\nAs \"cheeky\" as Clampett goes, Snafu prods his gun right at the Nazi's rear end, yelling: \"Stick 'em out, or I'll blow ya brains out!\". Got to love the irony of Snafu's dialogue, as Snafu's gun is pointed elsewhere besides his brains.\n\nThe Nazi soldier reacts wildly to the weapon as he raises his arms, staggering. Watching the soil dripping from Snafu's gun, the Nazi regains his courage, commenting/singing: \"That rifle looks just a bit goo-ey / If you 'tink I'm scared you're plum-screwy!\".\n\nA close-up diagram of Snafu's bullet desperately trying to shoot away from the bloated soil, shows controlled, solid timing - followed by an amusing squirt effect justified by Treg Brown's sound work. Intimidated, Snafu gives the soldier a Warner-esque sheepish grin (animated by Rod Scribner), until he bashes him with his gun, without second thoughts.\n\nThe following sequence of Snafu's attempt to frighten the Nazi soldier with a machine gun; is structured similarly to the previous sequence. Snafu will at first, intimidate the Nazi. At a moment of arrogance, he'll fire the machine gun at him. He'll keep doing so at the cost of overheating the gun into deteriorated condition.\n\nSo, the German soldier would return and sing: \"That gun was neglected - no water connected!\". Snafu's characterisation is established well by enhancing a morale that arrogance can be a factor of inadequate care.\n\nThe Nazi points out how their weaponry also work fine and are given the proper treatment and care. From what appears to be a rare insight on Nazis' strengths by American propaganda - it ends up poking at them, by revealing a close-up of a Nazi revealing a rusty pocket knife.\n\nWhile the propaganda is still fairly biased, the timing of the Nazi revealing the pocket knife is effective and daring - with Treg's \"boing\" effect to enhance some comedy. Snafu timidly comments, \"Yipe\" - until he runs away from the Nazi - and onto Snafu's last chance of treating artillery with proper care.\n\nAnimation: Virgil Ross.\n\nLike the previous two sequences; the following follows a similar structure. This time, the Nazi encounters a much more threatening weapon, the cannon. Notice how in each sequence; the weapons become more threatening.\n\nClampett's sense of comedy saves the German soldier from doom, as we encounter a hysterically camp-ish mouse - with sublime work by Virgil Ross and Mel Blanc's delivery. Ross adds some wonderful touches of the mouse swiping the dust from the cannon with its finger.\n\nThe Nazi learns further about the cannon's unstable condition as a group of ducks (resembling Daffy Duck), fly away from it - complaining about its stench. Clampett's charm is also enhanced as a baby duck, impersonating Katherine Hepburn, comments \"Rally they are!\" on the cannon's rusty state.\n\nIn response, the Nazi blows inside the cannon - causing the dust and debris to fly inside Snafu. Realising, all his tarnished weaponry is hopeless against the Nazi - he attempts to make an escape on his Jeep, but struggles to start the engine due to low car battery.\n\nClampett applies some nice dynamics of close-ups with the angry Nazi, that inter-cuts with a frantic Snafu struggling to start his Jeep. At that moment, he tosses the hand grenade - which meets Snafu's doom - but not by death.\n\nThe closing scene features a full-frontal naked Snafu held captive at a Nazi concentration camp. Clampett exploits the freedom he has from Production Code censors, by applying his juvenile tastes into nudity. The Nazi soldier has the last laugh, singing: \"Like all careless gents / He vinds up behind fence / Snafu is the vorld's greatest zero!\".\n\nEnding with an Axis victory - Snafu looks at his buttocks, which morphs into a mule's rear end. The lesson learnt, to treat your fighting tools with the right care. While Private Snafu meets a tragic consequence as per usual - at least it's more light-hearted and humorous a la Bob Clampett.\n\nThis Snafu cartoon represents one of only two that were directed by Bob Clampett. I'm curious whether it's attributed by Clampett's habits of falling behind schedule - indicating his minimal output on Snafu shorts. Even so, he remains faithful to the series' premise, by offering his directorial talent to create more innovative disasters for Snafu. Although the Snafu shorts are built largely on dark comedy and morale - Clampett appears more interested in entertainment value and toilet humour. At the same time, he creates a fair balance of cartoon action and morale. Despite his low output on the Snafu shorts, it remains a fine effort.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n414. Fin 'N Catty (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 413.\n\nRelease date: October 23, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Chuck Jones.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Robert C. Bruce (Narrator).\n\nStory: Michael Maltese.\n\nAnimation: Ben Washam.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: A goldfish loves his water. But, a cat who wants to eat the fish hates water and exhausts several attempts to retrieve it.\n\nMichael Maltese was very fond of exploring cartoon stories based on animal nature and their instincts. His shorts range from the Coyote and Road Runner, or one-shot masterpieces like Much Ado About Nutting. For the most part, Maltese took advantage of the mannerisms of domestic animals for endless story and gag opportunities. Easier to access and observe in comparison to a zoo visit.\n\nFor Fin 'n Catty, Maltese plays around with animal nature and logic - by portraying the natural enemies surrounding a domestic cat and a pet goldfish. As indicated by Bob Bruce's narration, \"goldfish must have water in order to exist\", but \"cats hate water, but must have goldfish in order to exist.\" Maltese's use of exposition sets up an entire cartoon effortlessly.\n\nThe concept of how cats \"must eat goldfish in order to exist\" is quite perplexing, especially when taking into account that fish isn't a natural diet for cats. An alternate line, \"cats must eat in order to exist\", would've been more justified, if more obvious. A minor flaw, but either way the cartoon premise is firmly established - with Maltese's creativity and character driven gags to benefit the short.\n\nChuck Jones' vision and attention to detail would also carry out the cartoon. An example of that is featured on interior scenes of the fish bowl, of a distortion effect achieved by Johnny Burton's camera department to create the illusion of underwater.\n\nAlthough Michael Maltese used cliched formulas; they were always character driven and unconventional. Maltese creates a funny personality of the cat, based on his extreme dislike of water. In an early scene, the feline dips his claw on top of the fishbowl but turns horrified at the slightest touch of water.\n\nThis results in a recurring gag of the cat frantically running towards a toilet paper holder to dry himself. This is accompanied by Chuck's fast-cutting and wonderful facial expressions that gives the cat some added character.\n\nAlthough the cat's extreme phobia of water is comedically executed for the most part, sometimes it's flawed. In a later sequence of the goldfish outside his fishbowl looking for water, he finds a sink tap dripping with water.\n\nThe goldfish leaps over to rinse himself, but finds the faucet completely plugged by the cat's finger. Despite having a dislike of his claw touching water - the cat still would've gotten wet from the tip of his finger. A minor flaw, but earlier scenes highlighting the cat's fear of water, work broadly through Maltese's knack for creating humorous characters and Chuck's posing combined.\n\nAnimation by Ben Washam.\n\nBesides a brief bit of narration, the rest of the cartoon is presented through pantomime - which I'm sure Chuck greatly enjoyed. Chuck Jones' use of strong character animation and comedy blend together wonderfully during a sequence of the cat attempting to siphon the fish's water with a hose. On the cat's first attempt, he watches the water siphon through another bowl - but finds the goldfish missing from his original bowl.\n\nFrustrated, the cat attempts to siphon the water back the other way; without realising that the goldfish has plugged its finger on the hose. The fish responds back by blowing the water through hose, drenching the cat's face.\n\nBen Washam's animation throughout the sequence is wonderfully executed in portraying determination of a tenacious cat. Washam enhances Chuck's posing hilariously during the cat's reaction to water splashed on his face.\n\nJones' timing is put to great use in the following scenes, of the cat sucking in and blowing through the hose. The air ascends through the hose to the fish's end, causing the goldfish to blow up to the shape of the fishbowl, all puffed up. It's beautifully subtle in execution, that's not overdone whatsoever. The gag is topped once the fish blows back - causing the cat to blow up like helium, and then exhale like a balloon.\n\nCharacter animation is further showcased in visual gags - as seen earlier when the cat attempts to trick the goldfish with a rubber glove. The cat uses his hands to create an unconvincing human figure representing a Fuller brush man. Some clever posing is conceived in order for the animator to animate a challenging hand walk.\n\nSome of Chuck's most hilarious comic timing appears in a frustration gag sequence involving flypaper. The conniving goldfish has replaced towel paper with flypaper; resulting in an episode of the cat's struggle to remove it.\n\nFlypaper gags in cartoons are perhaps best remembered in the Disney short, Playful Pluto, featuring a sequence with Pluto battling with one. Although it's celebrated for taking character animation to a new level; the sequence lasted over a minute and the gags were fairly conservative for Warners' standards.\n\nBy the early 40s, many animations studios had developed a fast-paced style for gags. In the case of flypaper, Chuck times it so broadly and rapidly; it creates an opportunity for more outlandish gags - like a Turban hat, and even more bizarrely, a piece of luggage. Bobe Cannon's animation in the sequence demonstrates great weight on the character's struggle, as well as an inventiveness in broad animation to interpret such far-out gags.\n\nAs per usual, one of the key highlights of Chuck's wartime cartoons is the 'avant-garde' layout styling of John McGrew, which varied from short to short. Sometimes they're either colourful, like in The Aristo-Cat or graphical like in Dover Boys. For this short, the stylistic approach is almost entirely abstract.\n\nThe background work for the house, like as the floor or ceiling, are entirely interpreted through shapes. In many shots, the backgrounds lack constructed lines to graphically clarify the locations. It's a very similar background style used previously in Jones'The Case of the Missing Hare.\n\nMcGrew and background artist Gene Fleury (was he still employed at Schlesinger by this point?), compose very daring angles in an attempt to create clarity of that style. The colour styling of the backgrounds are deliberately kept inconsistent in order to convey mood, which is more forgiving.\n\nThe simplistic, abstract approach works well enough to the point where background interference isn't an issue. Chuck Jones was blessed with having solid animators like Ken Harris and Bobe Cannon, whose animated performances kept the audience's attention.\n\nParts of the abstract layout styling are best highlighted in a series of fast-cutting shots of the cat exhaling from the siphon gag.\n\nAfter a string of gags focusing on the cat's failure to catch the goldfish - the plot then takes a different spin. At one point after the fish's antics; he hops back into his fishbowl - only to discover the hole is blocked by a dinner plate. The fish realises he's finally being outwitted. This soon follows through several attempts to find water - only to be blocked by the cat's presence.\n\nSome intriguing dynamics and staging are explored; showcasing the fish's struggle to survive without water. A scene dissolves to the fish supposedly stranded in the middle of a canyon; but the poster trucks back to reveal a poster of the Ace Insurance Co.\n\nIt's then revealed that the cat is manipulating the scenario, by holding a lamp on top of the fish and moving the beams as the fish crawls. Soon afterwards, the fish starts to experience hallucinations.\n\nThe fish spots a swimming pool outdoor location. Once he climbs the ladder and jumps off the diving board - the board match dissolves to the cat's claw, whilst the swimming pool dissolves to the cat's mouth. After a close call - the fish zips out of the cat's body. It's a creative portrayal of hallucination that serves as a compelling piece of suspense as well as a sinister portrayal of the cat.\n\nAnimation by Ken Harris\n\nFollowing the cartoon's climax - the goldfish hides inside a shower, and desperately turning on the taps - which soon overfills with water. The cat, unknowingly aware he is under water - watches the goldfish smugly as he swallows the key. After the cat watches the bubbles arise from his fingers - he double-takes and realises the predicament he's in. The bubble effects spelling \"Water?\" from his mouth is a beautiful touch, and yet it doesn't violate the pantomime effect.\n\nDesperately, the cat attempts to break away from the overfilled shower - kicking and screaming. Soon, he completely overcomes his dislike for water, as he starts to swim like a fish inside the shower room.\n\nThis is soon followed by the closing shot - revealing a twist to end the cartoon. The narrator concludes, \"As we were saying, cats hate -- er, (clears throat) cats love water!\", as the shot reveals the cat happily snoozing inside a fishbowl - whilst the fishbowl scowls inside a claustrophobic glass cup.\n\nIt's an amusing twist to the entire concept of \"cats hating people\", but admittedly, I feel the overall cartoon ending is a little unjustified. Call me sadistic, but personally I feel the payoff would've worked better with a darker ending - with explanation to WHY cats hate water. After all, the cat was certainly the antagonist of this cartoon.\n\nAn ending like that might've been too dark for Chuck Jones; but it's certainly not unheard of (i.e. Angel Puss) - and there could always a light-hearted approach to it. A morbid ending might've been too predictable for Michael Maltese; but either way, the twist works fine for how it is - making it less upsetting.\n\nFin 'n Catty remains a fine effort from both Michael Maltese and Chuck Jones; despite the fact I feel some elements could've been more justified. Maltese takes on what could be a formulaic plot, which eventually leads to an unpredictable yet humorous twist ending. Jones takes full advantage of Maltese's character personalities through his believable facial expressions that read clearly. Occasionally, characterisation is sometimes flawed within the cat; as analysed earlier. Asides from that, the short features enough gag material and strong visualisation which makes up for some of the cartoon's faults.\n\nRating: 3/5.\n\n↧\n\n415. Falling Hare (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 414.\n\nRelease date: October 30, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Bob Clampett.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Bugs Bunny / Gremlin), Bob Clampett (Vocal effects) (Thanks Keith Scott).\n\nStory: Warren Foster.\n\nAnimation: Rod Scribner.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Bugs Bunny becomes tormented by a war-time gremlin who attempts to sabotage an aircraft.\n\nHow do a lot of people perceive Bugs Bunny generally? A carefree rabbit with a trickster personality. A cartoon involving Bugs Bunny becoming a victim would be entirely out of the question. In the hands of Bob Clampett, it is so the case - and how he approaches it.\n\nMaking Bugs Bunny a victim of another foil is an extremely dangerous feat; as it depends entirely on who Bugs' opponent is - based on potency and wit. Bob Clampett's choice of candidate is much more amusing and in context of his cartoon style - by having Bugs run afoul of an unseen power - a fictitious gremlin.\n\nThe origin of gremlins go back to the myths of airmen from the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the United Kingdom - the myth that gremlins are impish creatures who have the ability to sabotage aircrafts. In 1943, Welsh author Roald Dahl (best known today for a highlighted career writing children's books) was perhaps first attributed for making the myth known worldwide, by writing his first children's book for the Walt Disney Studios simply titled The Gremlins.\n\nRoald Dahl had served in the RAF during World War II, explaining his awareness of the myth amongst airmen. For what it's worth, Dahl himself was involved in a plane crash during his post at Libya in September 1940.\n\nReportedly, the concept created a lot of superstition amongst many airmen. And so, it enhanced further possibilities for wartime animated cartoons. By placing Bugs Bunny in that environment, Clampett and Warren Foster don't shy away from limiting the possible consequences Bugs would face once he encounters a gremlin.\n\nBob Clampett must've taken a liking to the Dahl story, as well as the gremlins concept - enough so, it warranted another directed-cartoon, Russian Rhapsody which was released shortly after this cartoon.\n\nThe opening sequence has a very satisfying yet unpredictable tone. From any first-viewing experience, it's difficult to determine what Clampett has lied in store. For much of the short's first minute of running time; it's animation free - which is possibly attributed by Clampett's careless management skills.\n\nA Clampett-esque sign gag is featured as the cartoon's establishing shot which is followed by a slow pan shot of an air base, whilst Carl Stalling plays We're in to Win in the background.\n\nThe lack of new animation is soon compensated in the following scene - which features some of the most beautiful character animation ever conceived by the studio. Bob McKimson's work of Bugs' introduction is usually hailed as a tour de force piece of animation - and rightfully so. Not only is Bugs drawn very appealingly in proportions; but he feels very human. It also serves as a welcoming opening for what's yet to appear.\n\nBugs is seen as his standard self - sitting on top of a blockbuster bomb, eating his carrot and reading a book which title plays on Alexander P. Seversky's book, Victory Through Air Power. Bugs chuckles over a page he's reading on gremlins - followed by a point of view shot, featuring an illustration of the creatures, along with their descriptions.\n\nMel Blanc adds some wonderful touches to Bugs' delivery as he reads the text, such as Bugs' misreading on \"dia-boo-lickal saa-boh-tay-jee\". Bugs laughs mockingly over the notions about gremlins - utilised beautifully by McKimson's acting. Bugs' mocking gesture from his line, \"Oh, murder\" reads beautifully.\n\nBugs continues to laugh skeptically about gremlins (\"Gremlin! What a fairy tale! Little man. Oh brother!\") - until one passes by him. And so, Bugs feels an unusual strike coming from the nose of the blockbuster bomb, causing his body to vibrate broadly. He timidly laughs until he feels another strike.\n\nAfter a surprisingly calm opening sequence for Bob Clampett - the cartoon effortlessly moves forward.\n\nSo, Bugs watches the gremlin attempting to strike the nose of the bomb with his large mallet - in synchronisation to I've Been Working on the Railroad. Bugs is completely unaware of who he's conversing with. The gremlin reveals to Bugs, \"The blockbuster bombs don't go off 'til you hit 'em just right!\" - broadening Bugs' entranced amazement.\n\nAnd so, Bugs Bunny is deceived by the gremlin into testing the blockbuster bomb, by borrowing the mallet: \"Hey, Mac. Let me take a whack at it\". McKimson animates Bugs with an extreme anticipation - causing Bugs to twist his body several times; until he violently halts, hollering \"What am I DOING?!\".\n\nClampett's sheer energy begins to kick in a close-up of Bugs Bunny animated by Rod Scribner. Bugs stutters and speculates, \"Hey, I bet that was a -- Say, do you think that--? Hey, could that have been a...gremlin?\". The gremlin, standing on top of Bugs' whiskers yells in Bugs' ears: \"It ain't Wendell Willkie!\".\n\nScribner's timing of Bugs reacting to the holler is excellent in its frantic delivery. The use of layouts and colour styling in Clampett cartoons is always intriguing. Note how in the close-up; Mike Sasanoff only uses one colour to signify suspense. It's quite a risk in changing backgrounds very drastically; but it works well effectively.\n\nBob Clampett conceives some of the most surrealistic gags surrounding Bugs Bunny ever turned out by the studio. Clampett's energetic gags are typically far too broad for Bugs Bunny - and yet, he experiments with it with surprisingly great results.\n\nOnce Bugs Bunny chases after the gremlin, he strikes Bugs on the head with a monkey wrench. After an assembly line of inventive smear animation by Virgil Ross, Bugs momentarily alters his persona to dim-witted Lennie from John Steinbeck's novella, Of Mice and Men.\n\nHe dimly asks the Gremlin, \"Which way did we go, George?\" before collapsing frontwards. Mel Blanc provides a dim-witted voice for Bugs Bunny, to enhance the absurdity of the scene. In the following close-up animated by Rod Scribner, Bugs' posing and expressions are outrageously broad and hysterical as drawings.\n\nThe Gremlin pulls open Bugs' eyelids, checking to see if he's fine. Bugs responds, quoting Lou Costello \"I'm only three-and-a-half years old\" (Correction: See Yowp's comment below), and then flaps his lips in a screwball fashion. Typically, such a scene like this would be completely out of character for Bugs Bunny. Bugs' typically suave disposition would normally deprive from such boundaries. Only Clampett's boyish charm and Scribner's wild animation could bring make a feat pass. The sequence still has shock value today, taking into consideration that Clampett's perilous take on Bugs Bunny hasn't been paralleled.\n\nClampett's broadness and dangerous experimentation don't end there. Extensive exaggeration is highlighted in a scene of a vertigo Bugs Bunny, whose heart pumps out a 4F rating. Following that, the cartoonish energy is topped as Bugs slams into the wall of the plane. His body compresses into a flat penny - and gracefully shimmers.\n\nAnimation by Phil Monroe.\n\nOnce the gremlin boards an aircraft to sabotage it; Bugs ambushes him - in a desperate plea for retribution. Bugs, unaware that the gremlin has already started the plane, looks out for the creature by deceivingly calling after him whilst holding onto a monkey wrench. The gremlin appears but kicks Bugs' rear end; whilst hiding behind the aircraft door - laughing the the first few notes of Yankee Doodle. Typical piece of added character from Clampett.\n\nAngered, Bugs attempts to strike the gremlin with the monkey wrench - only breaking the window. This follows in a wonderfully timed, suspenseful piece of action featuring Bugs attempting to run into the aircraft doors - taking a step back farther each time, hoping for greater impact.\n\nThe action gets broader to the point where Bugs begins to violate the laws of physics. His feet start up with great anticipation, to the point were the weight of his feet causes the aircraft walls to tilt back. Phil Monroe's animation shows a great use of weight that makes a seemingly preposterous gag look believable from impact.\n\nCarl Stalling's use of the Russian folk song, Dark Eyes fits effectively to build suspense whilst timed accordingly to Monroe's animation - which is now considered a dead art. At the right moment, the gremlin opens the aircraft door - but Bugs' impact is too great as he zips out to an open sky.\n\nOne of the short's highlights, asides from observing Bugs Bunny getting tortured, is the animation itself. Arguably some of the most inventive, outlandish pieces of animation ever cranked out by the studio. A scene worthy for analysis is seen in Virgil Ross' animation of Bugs' visual concussion from the monkey wrench that struck his head.\n\nSmear animation dominates a large chunk of the cartoon. Some of them are more conventional, like the smear frame of Bugs, as indicated from the frame grab. Others are more far-out and brave. It's astounding how animators and assistants were able to creatively invent new kinds of smear animation - by still keeping the cartoon action maintained. At times, the stars truly have aligned when it comes to an artistic venture. From a casual viewing experience, the smear work doesn't scream for attention - but it evidently shows the enjoyment and endless possibilities of animation.\n\nFrom a cartoon standpoint, a lot of the gags conceived are fairly standard - but Clampett's animators enforce so much energy to make results more effective than what would be typically acquired. In a repeated gag of the gremlin striking Bugs with the monkey wrench on his foot - another inventive smear is thrown into the action.\n\nThe cartoon even features one of the oldest, and most cliched of slapstick gags - the banana peel. It's one of the rarest of occasions when a banana skin gag is actually inventive and hilariously executed.\n\nBugs Bunny zips back inside the plane after his exposure towards an open skylight. As he reenters the aircraft, he slips on several banana skins planted by the gremlin as sabotage. The action is very quick and energetic. The staging shows some strong dynamics that blends with Clampett's brisk timing. Notice how very daring the animator is on moving perspective within a a couple of frames. Both scenes provide an excellent showcase on how broad animation can improve generic gags.\n\nFor the cartoon's climax - Clampett builds up the suspense as Bugs and the gremlin race towards the earth in a diving bomber. Not only is the sequence a masterpiece in dynamics and ambitious staging - but also in comic delivery.\n\nA speed meter that channels\n\nTex Avery.\n\nThe climax is kept exciting and nail-biting. Bugs Bunny has been terrorised by a gremlin throughout this short. It gets to the point where Bugs' fate becomes unpredictable based on Clampett's uncanny handling of the character.\n\nThe layout staging and fast cutting are potent in execution. The shots cut back from a diving aircraft, that's animated beautifully as its body begins to strip apart from impact. Hilarious shots cut back to a nauseating Bugs - burdened by fate and sickness.\n\nThe pacing and suspense feels like a throwback to Tex Avery's cartoon The Heckling Hare; except in Clampett's cartoon, the pacing and camera staging has far advanced.\n\nOnce the moment of impact is present - the aircraft engine sputters; causing the plane to completely halt in mid-air, barely just above the earth. The unpredictable delivery and absurdness of the punchline makes its payoff the more hysterical. In the closing shot, the gremlin reveals that the plane has run out of gas. Bugs confidently eats his carrot whilst confiding to the audience, \"You know how it is with these 'A' (gasoline ration) cards\" - revealing an 'A' card next to him. Although the gag itself has aged over time, there's no denying that Clampett's hilarious punchline couldn't have been outmatched.\n\nPerhaps my favourite Clampett-directed Bugs Bunny cartoon - Falling Hare is a home run! It's wonderfully thrilling and inspiring, and yet downright hilarious. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the savage-like persona Bob Clampett later gave Bugs in Hare Ribbin'or Buckaroo Bugs; but his experimenting on characterisation remains unparalleled. Admiration for Clampett continues to escalate by astonishingly observing the risks he took and his fearlessness. Other cartoon directors would shy away from such an ambitious experiment, but Clampett's confidence shines. As a director, he took great pride by the creative freedom he was blessed with. It remains a wonderful insight in seeing somebody outwit Bugs Bunny to terrorising levels. At the same time, Clampett remains faithful to its source material - by restoring Bugs' charisma at the cartoon's end. Overall, an excellent cartoon that holds a testament to why Warner Bros. cartoons are exciting to watch. They're original and spontaneous.\n\nRating: 5/5.\n\n↧\n\nTom Palmer revisited\n\nYou can find rewritten reviews of Buddy's Day Out and I've Got to Sing a Torch Song, directed by the short-lived Tom Palmer, here.\n\n↧\n\n416. Inki and the Minah Bird (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 415.\n\nRelease date: November 13, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Chuck Jones.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStory: ?\n\nAnimation: ?\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Inki runs into a hungry lion whilst hunting with a spear. However, the lion has difficulty when he encounters the mynah bird who challenges him.\n\nCourtesy of Heritage Auctions.\n\nBy the time Chuck Jones was achieving better comedy for his animated cartoons; he still hadn't quite withdrawn from his Disney-esque characters which held back his true talents during his first few years as a director. He previously attempted to broaden Sniffles in The Unbearable Bear, which worked fine by underplaying his position and altering his cutesy persona.\n\nChuck Jones' Inki cartoons remained firmly consistent during his reform - with the exception of his broader timing. Jones would continue to sporadically make Inki cartoons until 1950 - at a time when he was reaching the pinnacle of his powers. Inki is probably the least diverse character from Chuck Jones regarding formula. While the Coyote & Road Runner cartoons feature a great variety of hysterical gags within the same premise - the Inki shorts are restraint from that. The premise is almost entirely centred on Inki hunting a mynah bird whilst endangered by a hungry lion. Only occasionally does the locale change, especially in later cartoons like Inki at the Circus and Caveman Inki. For such differences is for the review to uncover.\n\nThe animation is far broader in Inki than Chuck Jones wouldn't dare to do in his earlier cartoons centered on the character. In the opening scene Inki attempts to stab a worm with his spear, but narrowly misses. The spear vibrates vigorously that once Inki grips his hands onto the handle - he begins to shake violently.\n\nIn a following close-up; Inki's shaking action is matched by some wild smear animation. By the time the spear relaxes; Inki's hair bun is unloosened with wild long hair falling over his face. For a character we're used to seeing in slower paced cartoons - it's a pretty farfetched gag.\n\nShortly after, Chuck Jones appears to channel the likes of Tex Avery in a scene of Inki attempting to hunt the mynah bird. Inki's hair bun appears above the water, signalling the bird's location. Upon finding it Inki's hair bun travels its way through soil and digs up the surface. Inki grabs out his spear lying by the ground and proceeds to follow the bird.\n\nThe gag itself has been used several times in Avery's cartoons like The Crackpot Quail and The Heckling Hare. It was also used similarly in the Donald Duck cartoon, The Hockey Champ.\n\nThe gag standalone might be a throwback to earlier animated shorts, but the action of Inki digging through soil goes up a notch. Inki's hair bun creating wild subtle twists enhances some charm to Jones' timing.\n\nCarl Stalling's music typically requires a lot of direction from Chuck Jones for his Inki shorts. Most evident is the infamous motif for the mynah bird's hopping action synchronised to Mendelssohn's Fingal's Cave. Although Stalling took credit for the accompanying motif in an interview; he added, \"it went over so well that we had to use it every time.\" While it's one of the few remaining identities surrounding the character - it magnifies the bird's vague nature.\n\nOther uses of music timing blended into animation is utilised well in the cartoon's opening scene. A green worm hops rhythmically to Stalling's beats - including the worm's wriggling action. The hopping action continues until the worm has a close call to Inki's spear slammed to the ground.\n\nIt's a great showcase of how Stalling and Jones were both creative when it came to timing animated action through tempo. The scene itself has great staging and layout work - most likely by Art Heinemann. Keeping the worm the main focus until a spear shoots ahead of him is a nice case of unexpected delivery. The absence of Inki in the shot makes the spear all the more threatening. While the opening operates as a formula to previous Inki shorts - Chuck's pacing and use of dynamics had advanced to that point.\n\nThe sequence of Inki and the lion fighting inside a barrel showcases some of Chuck's experimentation with timing. Inki frantically hides inside a barrel after a close encounter with a hungry lion who antagonises Inki throughout the cartoon. The lion lifts the barrel upwards licking his chops, indicating he ate Inki - without realising he's now hiding on top.\n\nThis follows by a frenzy attack inside the barrel. The action is interpreted as frantic and wild as indicated by the barrel exaggeratedly twisting and changing volume, pulled off by Chuck's fun timing and the clarity of the cartoony animation.\n\nA very intriguing piece of timing follows immediately afterwards. The mynah bird suddenly hops out of the barrel and zips out of scene - leaving a cloud of dust. Then, Inki and the lion leave their clouds of dust as they zip out of shot.\n\nBut, the dust unveils to reveal the trio standing in their same positions - except this time the lion is ready to eat up Inki. The timing is wonderfully innovative in its presentation of speed. Very few directors like Chuck Jones could time a gag that requires so much subtlety surrounding the mystery of the mynah bird.\n\nIn previous Inki shorts, a hungry lion played an antagonist role. As a personality the lion was always intended to be fearsome and dangerous - likely a past attempt to make audiences take the lion seriously. For this cartoon, the lion is portrayed with a foolish characterisation; much in vein to the rest of the Warner Bros. product.\n\nIn one scene, the lion skids broadly to a halt upon seeing a juicy steak Inki holds. However, the mynah bird swallows the steak whilst hiding inside the jaws of the lion's mouth. Upon realisation that his steak is gone; the lion ends up bawling his eyes out, banging on the ground like a child.\n\nChuck Jones adds a hilarious touch by having the lion eyeing towards the audience - and quickly returns to his fearsome image - which is already tarnished. The gag works fine in creating an obvious contrast between size and behaviour.\n\nSuch characterisation remembered fondly by animator Shamus Culhane - a veteran animator who briefly worked at Schlesinger during this time. He recalls in his autobiography: \"I especially working on the lion because he was a dumb, raggedy coot who didn't remember that he was supposed to be the king of beasts.\" Culhane's descriptions perfectly matches with the scene. Culhane also wrote that the majority of the animation was split between himself and Bobe Cannon. Cannon's animation adorns this cartoon but whatever animated scenes Culhane worked on, I'm not certain.\n\nIn several sequences; Chuck Jones' character layouts come to advantage - notably when Inki first encounters the lion. Animating pantomime is challenging enough in terms of capturing clarity, but in the hands of Chuck Jones it's put to good use. Chuck's posing works effectively during Inki's double-take when he glares directly into the lion's eyes.\n\nBeautiful touches are added when the lion drums his fingers which delays Inki's take comedically. Inki's hair bun forming a question mark wonderfully communicates through pantomime. As the lion roars menacingly at Inki; he zips out of the shot - causing the lion to bump his head on the ground - adding character to his clumsy persona.\n\nIn a later sequence, the lion pounds furiously at a palm tree with child-like behaviour after failing to eat both Inki and the mynah bird. Coconuts drop from the tree but one drops in the lion's hands which morphs back to Inki's proportions.\n\nInki looks at the lion bashfully by which the lion responds with an even goofier grin. Inki leaves the scene - leaving the lion's hands empty. Chuck's expressions are fitting towards the lion's inept personality.\n\nThe mystery of the mynah bird typically becomes repetitive when the character sporadically hops into scene with the same Mendelssohn music and bringing curiosity towards Inki and the lion. In some cases; the mystery of the mynah bird actually becomes intriguing and ambiguous.\n\nIn one scene; the mynah bird hops inside a clump of hay whilst the lion anticipates a pouncing action towards it. As the lion follows the bird - the straw gradually reduces in size until it completely vanishes into thin air.\n\nLater on, the lion encounters a single piece of straw hopping into scene, but gradually grows larger and larger until the mynah bird reemerges. It's an intriguing piece of ambiguity surrounding the character - indicating a supernatural force in a cartoon environment. Jones' cartoons never reveals the mynah bird's true nature - perhaps a deliberate suggestion that the mynah bird is an unknown power towards mankind that can't be understood. The greater the mystery the more illuminating.\n\nThe mynah bird soon plays a more active part at the cartoon's climax when the bird challenges the lion. Earlier cartoons never featured the mynah bird's actions when defeating a lion; as it took place entirely off-screen. In this occasion, we are blessed to see the mynah bird engage in an effortless fight with the lion.\n\nHe picks up the jungle giant by the tail and whirls him around until the lion falls inside a lump of hay - which dwindles until it vanishes out of sight. Soon afterwards; the lion reappears when the mynah bird gives Inki a few pieces of straws.\n\nThe cartoon's ending commences once the mynah bird takes down the lion again - but this only, interpreted by some elaborate drybrush work and Treg Brown's use of comical sound effects. Inki quietly exits the scene during the brawl.\n\nOnce the drybrush whirlpool wears off; the lion discovers his jaws are missing from his mouth. He turns his eyes towards the mynah bird furiously - who then reveals to be wearing the lion's teeth inside its mouth.\n\nI don't consider myself a fan of the Inki cartoons, primarily based on its stale, repetitive formula. The cartoon's title itself doesn't strike me as anything different in comparison to The Little Lion Hunter or Inki and the Lion as those cartoons have a primarily similar structure. Although this cartoon might be another replica, it's much more engaging than the previous instalments. Chuck Jones' pacing and innovative use of timing makes the short a more intriguing viewing. It's evident that Chuck was attempting to utilise comedy for the Inki shorts; and to some extent it worked well for the lion characterisation. The minah bird's role in this cartoon adds some depth to the mysterious nature, and he's a lot more active than beforehand. This short doesn't represent the very best of Chuck Jones by all means, but it's certainly a step up from Jones' painfully slower cartoons.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSNAFU: The Home Front (1943)\n\nDirector: Frank Tashlin.\n\nRelease date: November 1943.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Snafu).\n\nMusic: Carl Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown.\n\nSynopsis: A homesick Private Snafu complains about the easy life of civilians like his family. However, he discovers they're also contributing to the war effort as he does.\n\nWars have the tendency of highlighting soldiers fighting combat as well as bearing the burden of military life. It's a pivotal example of war duty - but so is the home front. For civilians who are uninvolved in combat (whether it concerns the elderly or folks with 4-F ratings), society can contribute to the war effort through various kinds of factors. It ranges from various resources such as industrial or human, so the home front is still significant to a cause. The Snafu cartoons themselves were a contribution to the war effort. Every bit helps!\n\nIn this entry, Private Snafu underestimates how other forces contribute to the war effort besides armed forces. With magical guidance from the Technical Fairy, Snafu observes the various home front duties that's all beneficial for the war effort.\n\nAn intriguing element in this short that's set apart from a lot of Snafu cartoons is the character's relatively passive role. A chunk of the cartoon focuses on Snafu's family, based on what he thinks they're doing in contrast to what they're really up to. Instead of calamities that characterises Snafu; he is portrayed as an observer in this cartoon instead.\n\nNevertheless, Snafu's presence is felt during the cutaway sequences surrounding his family. Each of his family members are stereotyped based on Snafu's observations. He assumes his father is casually playing pool at Kelly's. His mother is portrayed as gossiping away with her lady friends whilst playing bridge.\n\nFrank Tashlin uses sight gags as little touches to personify their apparent nature. His father uses his cigar smoke to push a cue ball that's standing at the edge of the pocket. His mother and her friends visually dissolve into a flock of hens. Such gags are amusing in Snafu's unfair interpretations of their family.\n\nPerhaps the most hilarious observation from Snafu is seen from his interpretation of his grandfather - who he claims, \"never did a day's work in his life\". He is stereotyped as a perverted old coot who pleasures himself of using his binoculars to watch stripteases at a burlesque show. Some great lustful exaggeration is prominent in a shot of his eyes erecting through the binoculars.\n\nA more personal perspective from Snafu is his girlfriend, Sally-Lou. His paranoia kicks in at the thought of her already having an affair with a sophisticated philanderer. All those stereotypes are funny interpretations based on Snafu's homesickness - which makes him relatable as a character.\n\nBy the time the Technical Fairy arrives - he gives Snafu a special insight of his family's current activity through a telelvisor - which today, is a dated noun for a regular television set. Since television was a relatively new invention in 1943 - it's exaggeratedly portrayed as a magical device to watch people's current lives. As Snafu discovers; his father and grandfather are both contributing to industrial resources, his mother is planting a victory garden and Sally-Lou is working as a WAC. By the end of the short, Snafu comes to his senses when he realises his family are all \"working in the old home town\" - sung in the style of Tenting On the Old Camp Ground.\n\nFrank Tashlin utilises some his knowledge of camera panning during the opening scene of Snafu inside a shelter during a blizzard. His only source of comfort is a phonograph ironically playing Home Sweet Home. The camera pans to the record player, then pans towards a miserable Snafu attempting to keep warm by sitting on a stove. The camera pans back to the record player, which violently malfunctions and breaks apart.\n\nThe camera pans back to Snafu when he expresses his homesickness by complaining about a possible luxury his family are having back home: \"They don't even know there's a war goin' on!\".\n\nIt's a complex use of camera pan that's consistently kept busy throughout the sequence. If you're aware of how cels, backgrounds and camera stands compile together, it's a great deal of effort. Frank Tashlin is fearless when it comes to taking the liberty of moving the camera much more freely. This allows the scenario to have more space instead of a claustrophobic atmosphere.\n\nFrank Tashlin appears to approach some economic tactics in his direction - likely attributed by the smaller budgets the Snafu shorts provided. Economical or experimental, Tashlin utilises both in scenes that contain little or no animation.\n\nTashlin explores his timing abilities in sequences that contains no animation. This is especially evident during the victory garden sequence dug up by Snafu's mother and her pets. After ploughing the garden and planting the seeds; the crops grow rapidly to great effect.\n\nThis is achieved with no animation and the crops are likely drawn on separate levels. The effect would've been heavily reliant from the skills of Johnny Burton's camera department - who \"animated\" the crops growing. Not only did the department have to carefully time the effect; but also in rhythm to Beethoven's 5th symphony.\n\nSnafu's girlfriend in a figment of the nightclub scene is drawn as part of the background. Only the seductive gentleman is completely animated in the shot. One could say it's merciful in sparing the animator from painstaking drawing skills. However, she is very passive and aloof to the gentleman during the scenario; so full animation would've been unnecessary. It showcases Tashlin's judgement of using economical factors to good use.\n\nElements of risqué humour are no secret in Snafu cartoons. Some of the more edgier gags surface in this short. For example, in the opening shot of a blizzard, the narrator says: \"It's so cold, it would freeze the nuts of a Jeep!\". The context needs no explanation, but effects animation is applied to feature two nut bolts from a Jeep actually drop and fall to the ground. Keeping the context subtle makes the delivery all the more hilarious.\n\nThe burlesque sequence probably has the biggest shock value in this cartoon. Snafu's grandfather is watching a trio of young ladies performing a saucy strip tease on stage. Stripteases have proven a fun source for gags in several Warner Bros. cartoons; but never as indecent or obvious in this Snafu cartoon.\n\nThe trio strippers are seen completely bare; save their breasts and genitalia which are covered. Sometimes Frank Tashlin underplays the racy scenario as the camera trucks in on a girl's leg whilst undoing a bra. The assistant and drawing work in those scenes are a tad sloppy, but otherwise the clarity's all there. The series of shots featuring full-frontal nudity indicates the freedom the Schlesinger studio enjoyed from the Snafu shorts.\n\nThe Home Front is an intriguing approach for a Snafu short that doesn't follow a story arc. The first half of the cartoon features Snafu's interpretation of how he sees his family back home; whilst the second half features them contributing to the war effort. Frank Tashlin would be an appropriate candidate for a cartoon that doesn't rely heavily on formula or structure. Not only is this cartoon one of the rarest occasions where Snafu doesn't meet disaster, but also the downplaying of his role. It's takes a different spin on the premise's usual formula, but it manages to clarify its message just the same.\n\n↧\n\n417. Daffy - the Commando (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 416.\n\nRelease date: November 20, 1943.\n\nSeries: Looney Tunes.\n\nSupervision: Friz Freleng.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Mel Blanc (Daffy Duck / General Von Vulture / Hitler).\n\nStory: Michael Maltese.\n\nAnimation: Ken Champin.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: Commando Daffy Duck raids enemy lines - creating trouble along the way.\n\nBy the time of the cartoon's release; Germany were already starting to lose the Second World War. Western Allied countries were still a far cry from conquering the D-Day operation, but the short's premise suggests a speckle of optimism. The premise is centred on American commandos successfully breaking into German soil. Daffy Duck is portrayed as an American commando whose mission is to infiltrate a Nazi bunker, headed by colonel Von Vulture.\n\nDaffy Duck is a fine candidate of an animated character challenging the Axis of WW2, comedically. Already he's dealt with a Nazi billy goat in Scrap Happy Daffy - and would go on to become a messenger in the showpiece, Plane Daffy.\n\nFriz Freleng, perhaps the funniest of the Warner Bros. directors and Michael Maltese; the wittiest of the studio's writers, produce their take on Daffy's infiltration of a Nazi zone.\n\nFriz Freleng might not have been as visually innovative as the likes of Bob Clampett or Chuck Jones; dynamic staging and striking composition was never unheard of from Friz. Daffy - the Commando is certainly no exception. The opening establishing shot of a Nazi trench is a beautiful piece of mise en scene, with a Nazi flag waving.\n\nThe colour styling is kept intentionally dark to indicate a macabre atmosphere. It's interesting to see the locale looking more like a World War I trench - perhaps to make the identity of a trench more familiar with audiences.\n\nA dissolve in reveals Colonel Von Vulture pacing restlessly across his bunker, muttering in German. The indistinct German language might be ambiguous a general American audience, but the character's uneasiness is well clarified. The introduction is a solid example of exposition done right.\n\nOther beautiful uses of colour styling is evident during the blackout sequence. The layout work, likely done by Owen Fitzgerald, features objects drawn with basic outlines that has great graphic clarity. The shot of Schultz operating the searchlight is an example of that. The characters are shown entirely in silhouette - except momentarily when Schultz clumsily shines the beam across the vulture's face. An example of how the inking and painting department would have to follow timing to remove Von Vulture's silhouette form.\n\nAnimation by Gerry Chiniquy.\n\nFriz Freleng's timing is put to entertaining uses in several elements of the cartoon. The introduction of Von Vulture's henchman, Schultz, displays some marvellous characterisation blended with Freleng's timing when he goose-steps inside the bunker. Gerry Chiniquy applies a hysterical characteristic walk of Schultz that indicates an inept personality.\n\nCarl Stalling's cartoon touches are greatly applied through music. For Schultz's hasty walk; rapid drum beats enhances the characterisation. Schultz's stupidity is further showcased as he unintentionally kicks Von Vulture behind his rear during his uninterrupted goose-step inside the bunker.\n\nThe vulture calls him a \"dumkompf\", and strikes his helmet with a mallet. Despite Schultz's helmet compressed down to his feet; he still marches outside of the bunker, at one point momentarily crashing into a wall - as his busy legs does most of the action. Freleng's understanding of comic timing and personality blended together makes this little sequence a gem of its own. Not only is Schultz presented as a buffoon - but also the Nazi realm.\n\nThe blackout sequence showcases some gags that only work in animated form - with Freleng's unit pulling it off profoundly. In Daffy's opening shot, he is floating by a parachute whilst shun by a searchlight. He casually sings the British song She Was Poor but She Was Honest in a Cockney accent, before yelling \"Put out that light!\".\n\nIn the following shot; Schultz foolishly turns off the searchlight, until he is further abused by Von Vulture. Once again, the use of mise en scene can play a crucial role in achieving better comedy. Both characters don't appear in the shot; but Mel Blanc's delivery of \"Schultz\", the interpretation of sounds and imagery proves a very striking effect.\n\nOnce the searchlight reappears - Daffy Duck has some fun with the searchlight's lens to create shadow finger puppets. At first, the shadowy puppets looks like an amateurish effect - but it immediately morphs into an elaborate form of can-can dancers.\n\nThe transition from simple puppetry to the form of dancers is beautifully subtle in timing - and it reads well in animated form. After Daffy's fun; he pulls an asbestos curtain out of nowhere. Von Vulture unwinds the curtain - revealing Daffy pulling a stereotypical Japanese face and scaring the vulture off.\n\nAnimation by Gil Turner.\n\nAs far as Daffy's zany antics are concerned - it's surprisingly underwhelming in some parts. In one sequence, Daffy tricks Von Vulture in giving him a \"going away present\", of a clock - despite being an obvious time bomb in disguise. After Daffy's exit; Von Vulture double takes and passes the bomb over to Schultz - who flies upwards after the impact.\n\nAlthough the delivery highlights the colonel's naivety; the gag itself is predictable and somewhat unambitious as a concept. The execution feels more in the style of Ted Pierce instead of Michael Maltese.\n\nThe beginning showed some comedy potential - such as Von Vulture informing Daffy Duck the time, in the style of a talking clock device. The vulture calls for Schultz who marches over to strike his helmet, for the \"tone\". Once Daffy Duck turns away to adjust the clock bomb - the sequence loses some of its potential and spontaneity.\n\nMussolini crossed out of \"The Apes\n\nof Wrath\" - reflecting his 1943 defeat.\n\nMichael Maltese's witty use of languages is put to great use for gags requiring English translation. A close up shot of a telegram features some funny usage of puns written in German dialect, such as \"it's your ka-rear!!\" - which can mean two different things: his career or his ass.\n\nA sequence that best utilises some of Maltese's creativity is seen during the German speaking/translation sequence between Daffy Duck and Von Vulture by a phone booth - animated by Ken Champin.\n\nDuring a chase sequence, Daffy hides from the vulture colonel inside a phone booth. He reappears by confronting Von Vulture in German, and holding out a card of the English translation, reading: \"Can't you see this telephone is busy? Wait your turn\".\n\nSoon, the gag gets amusingly absurd as Daffy uses American slang speaking in German lingo; as indicated from the title card: \"Got a nickel, bud?\". Von Vulture hands over the nickel to Daffy. After a few moments, Daffy exits the booth and responding in English: \"It's all yours, von Limburger!\" - holding out a German translation card. The real translation is, as follows: \"I'm done with the telephone, Herr von Limburger\". Michael Maltese demonstrates a fun parody of translations - that's both ridiculous and funny in its portrayal.\n\nFor the cartoon's climax - both suspense and comic timing pay a key part. Daffy attempts to escape by jumping on board an unoccupied aircraft. Once he skyrockets up in the air; he is immediately trapped by a circle of Messerschmitt planes - as exclaimed by Daffy: \"Messerschmitts. A whole mess of Messerschmitts.\" Quite a tongue twister.\n\nAnimation by Phil Monroe.\n\nDaffy manoeuvres his plane to dive downwards - causing the Messerschmitt planes to accidentally fire at each other. After a few seconds of effects animation adorns the entire screen - the pilots find their aircrafts completely tarnished to fragments, leading to their 'downfall' - (a bad pun intended).\n\nOnce Daffy travels at full speed on his aircraft - he discovers his craft is being shot to smithereens, by Von Vulture's machine gun. Daffy continues to resist by holding onto the engine, until it sputters and becomes fatigued.\n\nAnimator Phil Monroe appears to struggle in capturing the timing of an engine malfunctioning with friction - all timed to sound. The animation isn't as crisp as it could've been. And so, Daffy Duck hides himself inside a large cannon - until he realises he's entered a dark corner; and trapped by Von Vulture.\n\nMuch of the animated cartoon serves its purpose to ridicule the Nazis in whatever crude approach. The crudeness might be lacking in contrast to shorts like Russian Rhapsody, but the mockery is still there. Not surprisingly; the Fuhrer himself is ridiculed the harshest.\n\nIn a short scene during a chase with Daffy Duck; Von Vulture momentarily halts and shouts, \"Heil Hitler!\"; by saluting a skunk passing through the trenches. A visual metaphor of the man, who shared such contempt from the general public.\n\nDuring the cartoon's resolution; Daffy Duck is fired out of a cannon, bearing a 'human cannonball' costume. He reaches his destination at a city rally conducted by Adolf Hitler. Hitler is crudely rotoscoped for the most part during his speech - likely lifted from stock footage in newsreels. The following scene is perhaps one of the most satisfying cartoon gags surrounding the dictator; Daffy Duck striking Hitler on the head with a mallet. For the ending pay-off, Hitler yells \"Schultz!\" as the cartoon closes.\n\nThe locale and theme is largely a product of its time; but it remains a relatively enjoyable cartoon. Fun, but it's a relatively standard Warner Bros. cartoon. The translation sequence features is wonderfully executed in its silliness and wit - done in the fine hands of Michael Maltese. Friz Freleng doesn't have too much opportunity to showcase his abilities; but when he does it's put to memorable use - such as the humorous characterisation of Schultz. More could've been explored creatively with Daffy's infiltration of a Nazi colonel - as the bomb clock sequence is arguably the weakest element of this short, gag-wise. The ending provides a hilarious payoff for an otherwise conventional short.\n\nRatings: 3/5.\n\n↧\n\n418. An Itch in Time (1943)\n\nWarner cartoon no. 417.\n\nRelease date: December 4, 1943.\n\nSeries: Merrie Melodies.\n\nSupervision: Bob Clampett.\n\nProducer: Leon Schlesinger.\n\nStarring: Arthur Q. Bryan (Elmer Fudd), Mel Blanc (Cat / Dog), Sara Berner (A. Flea) (Thanks Keith Scott).\n\nStory: Warren Foster.\n\nAnimation: Bob McKimson.\n\nMusical Direction: Carl W. Stalling.\n\nSound: Treg Brown (uncredited).\n\nSynopsis: A dog must resist himself from scratching; despite been tortured by a hillbilly flea.\n\nAn admirable quality of Bob Clampett is his ability to turn basic narratives into something innovative and spontaneous; which is conspicuous in An Itch in Time. The short follows a relatively straightforward scenario: a dog must resist himself from scratching, or otherwise, he'll be given a flea bath - much to the dog's heartfelt dislike.\n\nSuch a concept might be beneficial for a Disney cartoon featuring Pluto - except it'll likely be hampered by awkwardly slow-paced sequences of Pluto struggling. In the hands of Clampett, not only does he feature the dog's burden but also some insightful perspective of the flea - in wild and unconventional ways!\n\nOf the Looney Tunes cast; Elmer Fudd takes the role of a housemaster - but he's rather underplayed throughout the cartoon. Elmer sporadically appears throughout the cartoon to keep a watchful eye on his dog. Elmer's supporting role still plays a pivotal part in the narrative's angle - as his intimidation is shown from the dog's viewpoint.\n\nThe principal character of the short, is A. Flea; whose characterisation fits perfectly with Clampett's outlandish style. The flea is portrayed and dressed like a country bumpkin and consistently sings the irritatingly catchy song, Food Around the Corner. Written by Bob Clampett himself, its intentionally unsophisticated by adding character to the unrefined flea.\n\nSara Berner, whose voice is sped-up for the character, provides an obnoxious performance that fits with Clampett's vision of the character. Such a personality makes the dog's heavy burden all the more hilarious in scenario.\n\nThe flea's main desire is to find food; as seen from his actions and his song. He uses the dog's skin as an opportunity to find some meat - which he discovers through a telescope by yelling \"T-Bone!\" in Mel Blanc's voice. Not only is Blanc's delivery sublime - but the extra touch of the flea applauding in a juvenile fashion fits with the unsophisticated persona to a tee! The memorable appearance of the flea would eventually merit a second appearance in the Bob McKimson short; A Horsefly Fleas (1947).\n\nRod Scribner was always a reliable choice to embellish Clampett's zaniness on the screen. His talent is utilised uniquely in several close-ups of the dog, earlier in the cartoon. For example, when the flea leaps on top of the dog's snout - his nose bounces and jiggles vigorously; unparalleled by Clampett's wild timing.\n\nTo escape from a vulnerable position; the flea softly sings a lullaby inside the dog's ear. The following close-up is a greater contrast of the wild animation seen in the previous shot. The close-up of the dog drifting off sleepily from the flea's lullaby contains much slower action.\n\nSuch subtleties would be a challenge for any skilled animator. Rod Scribner not only pulls off the slow movement convincingly - but even uses the opportunity to draw exaggerated poses of the dog yawning - featuring Scribner-esque teeth. There's also a lolw-key background colour change; as indicated from both frame grabs. The second close-up enhances the sleepy atmosphere fittingly.\n\nElmer going by the book!\n\nBy the time Elmer enhances the bath caution; the dog attempts to put up with the escapades from the flea. Clampett's exploration of dynamics and struggle are priceless right down to the frame. The dog anticipates a scratching action several times, but only to be watched over by Elmer. A striking close-up of Elmer reading a Looney Tunes comic book is lavish not only in detail, but by emphasising his warning.\n\nAnimation by Phil Monroe.\n\nIn a short sequence; the dog attempts to cheat his way from scratching, by strategically kicking a domestic cat to clawing his back. Animator Phil Monroe displays sharp timing on the clawing action - as well as some very funny poses of the dog at a climax of relief. But, such luxuries aren't possible when Elmer Fudd glares down at the pets.\n\nBob Clampett experiments with gags of the dog's torment from scratching - that he takes an approach that's outlandish and absurd; but also bizarrely believable from that standpoint. Not only is the dog's burden beautifully captured in painstaking drawing seen in several close-ups; but also in scenes that's dependent on the ink and paint department.\n\nThe dog's resistance from scratching becomes increasingly difficult, to the point when the dog starts to change colour. At first, the dog's body turns blue - until the colours get more absurd in the process; including a tartan look.\n\nThe more painful it becomes for the canine; the crazier the colour choices get. The animation itself is primarily secondary in comparison to the ink and paint work. It's a very unorthodox method - but Bob Clampett enhances the pain convincingly.\n\nClampett's cutting style is used to an advantage as the shots of the dog struggling coincides with the flea's antics in the jungle of fur. The gags involving the flea searching for meat are hysterical in its execution. To begin with, the flea harmlessly pours ketchup and mustard on the dog's skin.\n\nOver the course of the cartoon; the gags become more sadistic and silly - that the result is riotous. Whilst searching for more meat inside the dog's fur; the flea uses tools such as a pickaxe and a jackhammer. Whilst intercut with the dog's reactions; his struggles are much more justified.\n\nIn preparation for the cartoon's climax; the flea begins to use explosives inside the dog's fur. The gag becomes far-out when the dog scents smoke rising from his rear end. This results in a series of airbrush fireworks rocketing from his bottom - a Clampett approach of a gag indeed.\n\nClampett's love for edgy albeit juvenile humour goes unnoticed in a lot of his cartoons. One of his more famous dirty gags appears during the dog's frantic scratching frenzy across the living room. At one point, he halts and informs the audience, \"Hey, I better cut this out. I may get to like it.\" Such a kinky confession is a symptom of Clampett's boyish charm.\n\nOne of Clampett's more obvious samples of juvenile humour appears early in the cartoon - during the flea's introduction. The flea pulls out a telescope to scout for potential flesh. The following shot is point-of-view from the telescope.\n\nThe flea moves across to discover a lavishly drawn rear-end of the dog. The effect of the flea double-taking and vibrantly looking back at the dog and whistling features some nice timing. An intriguing assignment I imagine for a character layout artist drawing out such lavish albeit crude detail.\n\nSome samples of Clampett's timing blending neatly with comical action is evident during the scene of the flea escaping the dog's biting chops. The action itself is timed to Raymond Scott's Powerhouse - which was becoming a trendsetter of Carl Stalling's musical compositions.\n\nMuch later, during the dog's scratching spree - Clampett explores some fast intercutting - of an approaching Elmer Fudd. This follows into a hilariously exaggerated skid; that's so intense the dog ends up gripping its nails onto the rug.\n\nThe dog backs away as Elmer advances towards him. Once the characters are off-screen; an unseen crash is interpreted through a camera shake. Elmer walks back into the scene; with the reluctant dog attached to a door ripped off its walls.\n\nAnd so; the cartoon reaches an incoherent ending. Elmer ends up scratching himself, presumably from the flea, which follows up some smear animation of Elmer scratching himself pose-to-pose.\n\nAfter both characters end up slipping inside a bathtub - they are unexpectedly carried away by the flea onto a dinner plate; labelled as a blue-plate special. This leads to the flea: \"They'll be no more Meatless Tuesdays\", in the same rhythm of his song - delighted over not having to ration.\n\nSuch a spectacle comes as a complete surprise to the domestic cat - seen earlier in the cartoon. Losing the will to live, the cat remarks: \"Well, now I've seen everything\" - and commits suicide on the spot. This holds my nomination of one of the nuttiest endings in a Clampett cartoon. The gag itself has been used several times, like Horton Hatches the Egg, but ending the short abruptly during that scene - is both dark and hysterical in shock value.\n\nFor a relatively basic narrative, Bob Clampett is always full of surprises! His carefree, wild approach to cartoon filmmaking are exceeded here. His exploration of angst on the dog is a personal highlight - from both an artistic and comical perspective. The characterisation of the flea is ingenious albeit deliberately cor"
