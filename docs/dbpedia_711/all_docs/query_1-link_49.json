        "text": "If you want to search a specific cartoon, press CTRL+f and type its title.\n\n1930-1934\n\nThe beginning of Looney Tunes by producers and directors Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising.\n\nFrank Marsales becomes the main composer of this era.\n\nApril 30th, 1930: Bosko‘s debut in Sinkin’ in the Bathtub.\n\nJuly 25th, 1931: The Tree’s Knees = last short directed by both Harman and Ising.\n\nAugust 2nd, 1931: Lady, Play Your Mandolin! = first Merrie Melodies short, directed by Ising. Harman would direct Looney Tunes shorts only.\n\nJanuary 14th, 1933: Bosko in Dutch = first cartoon directed by Isadore ‘Friz’ Freleng.\n\nAugust 26th, 1933: Bosko’s Picture Show = last appearance of Bosko (and Honey).\n\nAugust 26th, 1933: We’re in the Money = last WB cartoon produced by Harman and Ising and composed by Marsales.\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1933: Buddy’s Day Out = Buddy‘s debut, first cartoon produced by Leon Schlesinger, composed by Bernard Brown and Norman Spencer.\n\n(Director Tom Palmer’s brief output in WB was a total disaster).\n\nNovember 11th, 1933: Buddy’s Beer Garden = first cartoon directed by Earl Duvall.\n\nJanuary 27th, 1934: Pettin’ in the Park = first cartoon directed by Bernard Brown.\n\nFebruary 17th, 1934: Honeymoon Hotel = first WB cartoon in color.\n\nApril 14th, 1934: Buddy’s Garage = last cartoon directed by Earl Duvall.\n\nMay 26th, 1934: Buddy of the Apes = first cartoon directed by Ben Hardaway.\n\nJune 23rd, 1934: Buddy’s Bearcats = first cartoon directed by Jack King.\n\nOctober 20th, 1934: Rhythm in the Bow = last b&w Merrie Melodies cartoon.\n\nNovember 10th, 1934: Those Beautiful Dames = first WB cartoon produced in 2-strip Technicolor.\n\n1935\n\nMarch 2nd: I Haven’t Got a Hat (Freleng) = first appearance of Beans, Little Kitty, Ham and Ex and most of all, PORKY PIG.\n\nAugust 24th: Buddy the Gee Man (King) = very last appearance of Buddy (thank you).\n\nNovember 2nd: Gold Diggers of ’49 = first cartoon directed by Fred ‘Tex’ Avery.\n\nNovember 9th: Billboard Frolics (Freleng) = first cartoon to use the Merrily We Roll Along song (Merrie Melodies theme).\n\nNovember 20th: Flowers for Madame (Freleng) = first WB cartoon in 3-strip Technicolor.\n\n1935 is a very unripe year, with very few interesting things and TOO MUCH SINGING, as if it tried so hard to mimic Disney shorts.\n\n–I HAVEN’T GOT A HAT (Freleng): definitely his best cartoon of the year, even though it’s not particularly great. It’s got a few nice bits like ‘white as cornflakes’ and Porky Pig’s very first appearance.\n\n–A CARTOONIST’S NIGHTMARE (King): although King’s cartoons aren’t generally exciting, this one is interesting, as it’s basically Duck Amuck before Duck Amuck. My issue with this is King’s inability to make violence funny, as it looks way too sadistic and takes itself way too seriously.\n\n-Hardaway’s got NO good cartoons, as he stuck to Buddy’s cartoons, which pretty much suck because Buddy is lame.\n\nAvery cannot be rated, since he only supervised one cartoon, Gold Diggers of ’49. Even so, it already shows why he’s the director with the most potential, as he’s able to deliver clever visual gags and subvert tropes, like the ‘How to find gold’ book and the entire segment of Beans telling everyone he found gold.\n\nVirgil Ross, Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones and Sid Sutherland are some of the animators of his unit.\n\n–LITTLE DUTCH PLATE (Freleng): super forgettable cartoon, with a pretty weak plot, a nasty ending and WAY TOO MUCH SINGING.\n\n–BUDDY’S BUG HUNT (King): to King’s credit, his Buddy cartoons are nowhere near as awful as Hardaway’s, but they’re still mediocre. His 1935 output is meh, overall.\n\n–BUDDY OF THE LEGION (Hardaway): directionless, predictable and boring. I had to choose between this one and Buddy in Africa, which is also pretty bland and boring.\n\n1936\n\nJanuary, 11th: I Wanna Play House (Freleng) = first WB cartoon to use the opening rings and the closing rings.\n\nMarch, 9th: Page Miss Glory (Avery) = first cartoon to use the zooming WB opening shield.\n\nApril, 11th: I’m a Big Shot Now (Freleng) = last cartoon composed by Bernard Brown.\n\nApril, 25th: Westward Whoa (King) = last appearance of Beans, Little Kitty, Ham and Ex.\n\nAugust, 22nd: Porky’s Poultry Plant = first cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin and composed by CARL STALLING.\n\nAugust, 29th: At Your Service Madame (Freleng) = last cartoon composed by Norman Spencer.\n\nSeptember, 12th: Porky’s Moving Day = last WB cartoon directed by Jack King.\n\nSeptember, 19th: Toy Town Hall (Freleng) = last MM cartoon to use ‘I Think You’re Ducky’ as the opening theme.\n\nOctober, 10th: Boulevardier from the Bronx (Freleng) = first MM cartoon to use Merrily We Roll Along as opening theme.\n\nDecember, 5th: The Village Smithy (Avery) = first LT cartoon with Porky’s opening theme.\n\n1936 is a slight improvement over 1935, but it’s still kinda hit and miss. There’s a lot less singing, at the very least. The entry of the composer Carl Stalling is the main event of this year.\n\n1936 is a mediocre year for Freleng, pretty decent for Avery, very forgettable for King and also a decent debut for Tashlin.\n\n-It’s pretty tough to find Freleng’s best of 1936, because it wasn’t a fortunate year for him. The Cat Came Back is kinda okay and The Coo Coo Nut Grove has a few good jokes, but his musical numbers are getting kinda tedious and out of touch.\n\n-Yet, it’s even harder to pick King’s best of 1936. Unlike Freleng, his cartoons aren’t even that well-directed, his timing is completely off and tends to depict violence as more sadistic than funny. His last year at WB isn’t that satisfying, he’d try to find better fortune at Disney, with gigantic animators narrowly concealing his considerable gaps. Porky’s Moving Day, his very last cartoon, is okay-ish and Porky’s Pet does kinda resemble his own 1937 short Donald’s Ostrich.\n\n-It’s no surprise Avery pops up as the supervisor with the highest potential. Even his worst entries got some clever jokes, through simple and casual puns or break of the 4th wall, which are extremely common throughout his career. Plane Dippy and The Blow Out are both solid cartoons for its time, Page Miss Glory with the irreverent olive scene and The Village Smithy with the convenient narration at the beginning and the darn memorable callback to the camel of Tashlin’s Little Beau Porky (innovative meta-gag for its time). As for I Love to Singa, his most notorious cartoon of 1936, the concept of a jazzy owl being born in a family of classical owl-musicians is interesting, but I feel this is probably the farthest from Avery’s ideas this far. It ends in a way too peaceful note for being Avery’s best of the year. On top of that, I don’t care for occasional characters, unless they support the big ones.\n\n-Tashlin’s debut is indeed decent in Porky’s Poultry Plant, which is pretty action-packed and shows a darker plot involving a flock of hawks kidnapping and slaughtering chickens.\n\n-Most of Freleng’s 1936 cartoons are pretty middle-of-the-road, but Sunday Go to Meetin’ Time gets the cake of the worst one. I’m not keen on racist content.\n\n-As for King, there’s an embarrassment of riches: The Phantom Ship is very boring with a lame cast, Shanghaied Shipmates is unfunnily aggressive and Fish Tales doesn’t have a proper direction. The latter cartoon is probably the worst of King, because its violence is just for the sake of it, comedy timing is non-existent and the ending is incomplete. It manages to become a pretty unsettling short and not in a positive way.\n\n–Don’t Look Now is a bit dull for Avery’s standards. I can only appreciate Cupid and the devil’s totally opposite daily routines (the latter’s fiery shower), because the rest is meh. Page Miss Glory is a mixed bag, as it’s got a few clever and absurd gags, but also dragged out bits like the leaf ballet or the elevators segment. I don’t consider it a masterpiece like someone else would, as it’s got aspects I both enjoy and absolutely don’t care for.\n\n1937\n\nMarch, 27th: The Fella with the Fiddle (Freleng) = first cartoon where MEL BLANC receives on-screen credit.\n\nApril, 3rd: Porky’s Romance (Tashlin) = first appearance of Petunia Pig.\n\nApril, 17th: Porky’s Duck Hunt (Avery) = first appearance of DAFFY DUCK and the first cartoon to slim down Porky.\n\nMay, 15th: Porky and Gabby = first WB cartoon directed by Ub Iwerks and first appearance of Gabby Goat.\n\nJuly, 3rd: Porky’s Super Service = last WB cartoon directed by Ub Iwerks.\n\nJuly, 17th: Egghead Rides Again (Avery) = first appearance of Egghead and first cartoon to use the zooming sound effect in the ‘Merrily We Roll Along’ opening theme.\n\nJuly, 24th: Porky’s Badtime Story = first cartoon directed by Robert ‘Bob’ Clampett.\n\nAugust, 21st: A Sunbonnet Blue (Avery) = last MM cartoon to end with stock music.\n\nAugust, 28th: Get Rich Quick (Clampett) = last appearance of Gabby Goat and first LT cartoon to use The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down as opening theme.\n\nOctober, 9th: Rover’s Rival (Clampett) = first LT cartoon to use Porky’s drum ending ‘That’s all, folks’.\n\n1937 manages to be even more hit and miss than 1936, but at least showcases some changes. Interesting how the best new character they created appears only in ONE cartoon, whereas Gabby Goat and Petunia Pig receive far more screen time, despite being underwhelming attempts to give Porky a supporting character. Fortunately, the following years are giving this character the relevance he deserves. Of course I’m talking about Egghead.\n\n1937 is another mediocre year for Freleng and a sheer disaster for Iwerks, but is fairly satisfying for both Avery and Tashlin and also a solid debut for Clampett, promoted as a director after working in Avery and Iwerks’ units.\n\n-While Freleng knows how to handle comedy and music and his animation staff is also quite competent (Paul Smith, Cal Dalton, Bob McKimson, Ken Harris… art looks ugly and out-dated, though), this still remains another underwhelming year. His cartoons are passable at most, they’re nowhere near as compelling as his ’40s-50s ones. They might showcase nice gags, but they’re not that entertaining overall, like the rich/poor wall swap in The Fella with a Feedle, the dog show of Dog Daze or the time staggering in He Was Her Man. Visual puns out of context aren’t sufficient to hold a short on their own.\n\n-Avery keeps on demonstrating his growth as a supervisor (in spite of some avoidable duds), his animation staff is very strong (Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, Virgil Ross, Sid Sutherland, Cecil Surry, Bobe Cannon… and also Paul Smith and future MGM legend Irv Spence) and his performance is fairly solid. Porky’s Duck Hunt is easily his best cartoon of the year, which marks Daffy Duck’s debut. Very solid entry: Daffy fixing Porky’s gun is funny, the intoxicated fish gag is also funny, yet a bit long and the ending is a tad weak (by now I guess Avery enjoys making specific segments as frustratingly long as possible). Little Red Walking Hood (Cal Howard) is rather enjoyable, filled with constant 4th wall breaks, Porky the Wrestler is okay with the build-up of the train segment and Porky’s Garden has the umpteenth Popeye reference of all things.\n\n-As for Tashlin, he mostly handles Porky’s shorts. He’s possibly the most consistent supervisor, since his lows aren’t THAT low compared to Freleng and Avery. Animation-wise, his staff may not be as strong as Avery or Clampett’s (Robert Bentley, Joe D’Igalo, Volney White…), but it’s not unusual to view big names like Don Williams, A.C. Gamer, Paul Smith and McKimson himself. The Case of the Stuttering Pig (Melvin Millar) has got a solid plot and a pretty eerie and sinister atmosphere, Porky’s Building is fairly okay with a dark and cruel dynamite gag… I personally love it and Porky’s Romance also relies on some gratuitous and functional callousness, which also makes the ending extremely satisfying.\n\n-1937 is the year of Clampett’s debut as a supervisor in Porky’s Badtime Story. He’s maybe the closest to Avery when it comes to humor, wackiness, casual and crafty comedy and quirky expressions. No wonder the likes of Chuck Jones, Bobe Cannon and John Carey get to participate in his unit.\n\n-Fortunately, Freleng would improve dramatically later on, because his cartoons are so boring. Even if we pretend the racist clichés didn’t exist, September in the Rain and Clean Pastures still don’t work that much for the lack of plot solidity and for relying on SO MUCH SINGING (mentioning the racist content would be such an easy target), She Was an Acrobat’s Daughter is so forgettable I mistook it for a Tashlin cartoon, maybe due to looking so different from the Freleng I’m more reminiscent of.\n\n-Retrospectively, 1937 isn’t a stellar year for Avery, either. Although it’s the year of Porky’s Duck Hunt and Little Red Walking Hood, it’s also the year of the forgettable Ain’t We Got Fun, of the boring I Only Have Yawns for You, of the “slavery is funny” Uncle Tom’s Bungalow, of the unnecessarily mean-spirited Egghead Rides Again and the abominable A Sunbonnet Blue, which is probably the worst thing Avery ever made up. I’d rather rewatch a loop of Pre-Hysterical Hare over this, it’s a disaster: singing is annoying and plot is too simplistic and sugary for Avery’s standards.\n\n-Tash’s lows aren’t as problematic as Avery’s, maybe because even at his worst he’s able of suggesting interesting ideas, such as giving magazines life in Speaking of the Weather and the book gag of The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos (Melvin Millar). Too bad said cartoons are all boring.\n\n-Former Disney legend Ub Iwerks only directed two cartoons, which are all but good. Both Porky and Gabby and Porky’s Super Service attempt to recreate the Mickey-Donald-Goofy fail compilations of the mid ’30s, whose device feels so worn-out and repetitive by now. The presence of Gabby and that annoying kid clearly doesn’t improve the situation, either. He truly wasn’t that successful as a supporting character… the ‘shall I tell him’ line is great, though.\n\n1938\n\nMarch, 19th: Porky’s Phoney Express = first cartoon directed by Cal Dalton and Cal Howard.\n\nApril, 2nd: A Star is Hatched = last cartoon directed by Friz Freleng before joining MGM.\n\nApril, 30th: Porky’s Hare Hunt (Hardaway, Dalton) = first appearance of Happy Rabbit.\n\nMay, 28th: The Isle of Pingo Pongo = first of Tex Avery’s travellogue (documentary) shorts.\n\nJuly, 23rd: Cinderella Meets Fella (Avery) = last MM cartoon with the mid-1938 opening theme.\n\nNovember, 5th: You’re an Education = last cartoon of the ’30s directed by Frank Tashlin.\n\nNovember, 19th: The Night Watchman = first cartoon directed by Charles M. Jones, taking over Tashlin’s unit.\n\nDecember, 12th: Daffy Duck in Hollywood (Avery) = first solo Daffy Duck cartoon.\n\nA lot of events occurred in 1938, such as Freleng and Tashlin’s departures, the rise of the strange Hardaway-Dalton duo, Chuck Jones’ promotion as a supervisor and Bob Clampett’s forthcoming explosion. That’s a peculiar year indeed, the most satisfying of the decade by a landslide.\n\n-Freleng decides to leave Leon Schlesinger’s studios to start a new project at MGM, the not-so-successful Captain and the Kid cartoon series. MGM would also give him a higher wage. In any case, his WB cartoons are far from great. A Star Is Hatched (Tedd Pierce) is an okay short and My Little Buckeroo has got a few funny moments.\n\n-This was a pretty difficult year for Avery, as most of his experiments fell terribly flat. His staff may still be his splitting image (Paul Smith, Irv Spence, Virgil Ross, Sid Sutherland…), but some of the writing choices leave to be desired. At the very least, the experiment of giving Daffy Duck his own cartoon totally works, as seen in Daffy Duck in Hollywood (Dave Monahan). Daffy is already proving to be a well-developed character, he’s already got an insane personality, which makes him stand out strongly. It’s not a surprise to consider Daffy Duck and Egghead (Ben Hardaway) another enjoyable example, as well. I mean, what else should we expect from a cartoon beginning with both characters coming out from their nutshells? Why is Daffy so victorious? Why does Egghead lift the lake like a rug? Why is Daffy shaking hands with his own reflection? Nothing about this makes sense, that’s why it’s amazing.\n\n-If Tashlin was very consistent in 1937, here his cartoons look kinda jarring. For instance, I feel there’s an evident gap between his Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons, with the latter looking more refined and polished than the former, possibly due to the presence of Bob McKimson, Phil Monroe, Ken Harris and A.C. Gamer (former Freleng animators) in his MM entries, whereas his Porky cartoons don’t get the same treatment. His layouts are still pretty cool, though. Tash reuses the idea of giving life to inanimate objects (magazines in Speaking of the Weather) with books in Have You Got Any Castles and brochures of different countries in You’re an Education (Dave Monahan), both of which eventually get less fresh and more tedious due to a feeble plot. I actually enjoy Porky the Fireman (Melvin Millar) way more, it’s got some hilarious bits like the sigma fireman and the old man “go save grandpa”. Much like Freleng, he’d leave WB after You’re an Education.\n\n-In my opinion, Clampett is the true star of 1938. He seems to fully understand the concept of “wacky” in a differing way from Avery, because unlike him, Clampett doesn’t compromise and doesn’t want to betray his thoughts and tends to exceed the hysterical tone of his cartoons. Even smaller details manage to sound hilarious, like the timing of the silkworm’s theme in Porky’s Party, a very enjoyable cartoon, or the nipple-funnel gag of Porky’s Poppa, pretty solid one, too. Animation-wise, I, too, used to underestimate his pre-McKimson staff. I regret that because Chuck Jones himself, John Carey, Bobe Cannon, Izzy Ellis and Norm McCabe also contributed to Clampett’s success. Injun Trouble and The Daffy Doc are definitely solid, Porky and Daffy is extremely entertaining from start to finish (with Daffy being the driving force, this is such an underrated gem), but it’s Porky in Wackyland (Warren Foster) which takes the cake of the best of the year. Interesting how it’d take so much time for huge directors like Jones and Freleng to create their own milestones, whereas Clampett accomplished that only a year after his promotion. This is one of his quintessential cartoons, pure nonsense and zaniness from start to finish, in spite of Jones’ departure from his unit. The first breakthrough of WB in chronological order.\n\n-Speaking of Jones, 1938 is the year of his official debut as a supervisor, after working in Avery and Clampett’s units as a key animator. He only directed one cartoon, The Night Watchman (Tedd Pierce). Passable debut animated by Tashlin’s former team (Bob McKimson, Ken Harris, Phil Monroe, A.C. Gamer + Ben Washam and Rod Scribner).\n\n-After Clampett and Jones, Cal Dalton is also promoted as a director after being one of Freleng’s main animators, but he’s backed up by Cal Howard first and Ben Hardaway then. Even though their animation staff isn’t so bad (Herm Cohen, Rod Scribner, Gil Turner…) and shorts like Porky’s Hare Hunt (Howard Baldwin) and Porky the Gob (Melvin Millar) are alright (Porky stuttering while singing is kinda funny), most of their cartoons lack comedy timing and substance, and don’t look very pleasing in terms of visuals. If anything, Porky’s Hare Hunt introduces Happy Rabbit, who does the groundwork of one of the most influential cartoon characters.\n\n-Why does Jungle Jitters (George Manuell) even exist? Do I even have to explain why it sucks? Racist, shallow, dull, with an abrupt ending.\n\n-I don’t really appreciate most of Avery’s experiments of this year, because he sometimes tends to give up his humor in favor of safe setups or shallow or sappy stories. Such a compromise doesn’t give me a positive opinion on his 1938 output: The Isle of Pingo Pongo (George Manuell) actually starts off solidly, until it results in racist content, I don’t really care for The Penguin Parade (Ben Hardaway), too simplistic for my taste, Cinderella Meets Fella (Tedd Pierce) is a mixed bag, filled with a few funny gags and cheesy moments and The Mice Will Play (Jack Miller) sucks, too schmaltzy and boring. More or less on the same level of awful as A Sunbonnet Blue.\n\n-Not the best year for Tashlin, either. Little Pancho Vanilla is very boring, I’m not into bullfighting, Porky’s Spring Planting (George Manuell) is a weak cartoon, Now That Summer Is Gone (Fred Neiman) is stupid and as for Wholly Smoke (George Manuell), I get the message it tries to spread, but it feels so bizarre and awkward.\n\n-Overall, Clampett’s 1938 was positive, despite a few weaker entries, like Porky in Egypt (Ernest Gee), which isn’t terrible, but feels under Clampett’s usual standards (the Lew Lehr caricature is the best part, but Clampett’s formula is slowly showing signs of decrease, which may also have something to do with Jones’ departure), and Porky’s Naughty Nephew (Warren Foster) being a mediocre cartoon. Kids ruin everything and quite fairly, Bernice Hansen’s shrill voice is more or less like hearing a drill while you’re trying to sleep in the weekend.\n\n-As for Dalton, I personally like him a lot more as an animator. A-Lad-In Bagdad (Dave Monahan) is very boring, Love and Curses (Melvin Millar) got a character dressed like Peter Griffin (white shirt and green pants), but apart from it, it’s nothing worth to talk about and Katnip Kollege makes Pluto’s Blue Note look like The Band Concert in comparison: it’s downright awful, it’s got no plot and once again, I hate this kind of musicals lacking substance, which were already out of touch in early ’30s, so just imagine how they’d fare in late ’30s. Thankfully, entertainment is progressing during this very period, thus we’d eventually encounter far better music-centered cartoons, which would look so authentic and unique, unlike this feline garbage.\n\n1939\n\nJanuary, 14th: Dog Gone Modern (Jones) = first appearance of The Curious Puppies.\n\nMarch, 25th: Prest-O Change-O (Jones) = last cartoon with the white design of Happy Rabbit.\n\nApril, 22nd: Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (Jones) = last WB cartoon to open with VITAPHONE.\n\nMay, 20th: Naughty but Mice (Jones) = first appearance of Sniffles.\n\nJune, 3rd: Believe It or Else (Avery) = last appearance of Egghead.\n\nAugust, 12th: Hare-um Scare-um (Hardaway, Dalton) = first use of Happy Rabbit with the grey design.\n\nAugust, 26th: Detouring America (Avery) = nominated for an Academy Award for best animated film of 1939.\n\nOctober, 7th: Naughty Neighbors (Clampett) = last appearance of Petunia Pig.\n\nOctober, 7th: Little Lion Hunter (Jones) = first appearance of Inki & the Mynah Bird.\n\nThe ’30s end with the beginning of WWII, which must’ve conditioned the production of this era. Otherwise, I’m not able to find any other reason for such a drab year, because after a long decade, scripts are losing its freshness and WB is suffering the consequences of questionable choices, such as the use of bland characters like Petunia and Sniffles, the infamous Hardaway-Dalton duo mostly being unremarkable and Chuck Jones’ poor Disney impression. 44 shorts were released, but felt like a hundred for how tedious and worn-out most of them were. It’s kinda disappointing to view everyone producing below their actual standards. Fuck, what a bad year.\n\nThe best thing out of 1939 isn’t even a short, it’s just Porky saying ‘Son of a bitch’ multiple times. Just imagine how bland this year was.\n\n-If Avery’s 1938 was pretty much of a mixed bag, his 1939 is surprisingly impersonal. Each one of his cartoons either involves one-hit characters (why not Daffy Duck?) or relies on the documentary formula, whose idea was original at first, but now feels a bit too worn-out because of the same damn old puns. Either way, A Day at the Zoo (Melvin Millar) is a serviceable documentary, with plenty of funny gags like the pack of camels and monkeys feeding visitors, Screwball Football (Melvin Millar) is decent, with a kind of ending which would eventually influence Clampett in his edgelord years. Overall, observing how many documentaries Avery made in 1939, like Fresh Fish (Jack Miller), Detouring America (Jack Miller) and Land of the Midnight Fun (Melvin Millar), makes me realize he was probably struggling to find fresh ideas, since it’s not a particularly elaborate format and it’s very easy for me to lose interest in it.\n\n-Speaking of losing interest, Clampett is clearly fed up with Porky Pig, since he’s only made Porky cartoons so far. His output indeed suffers an evident decrease compared to his accomplishments of the previous year, most of his Porky cartoons feel a bit too drained and uninspired due to his very interest diminishing. Sometimes he isn’t even the protagonist of his own cartoons, like in Jeepers Creepers (Robert Gee) or The Lone Stranger and Porky (Warren Foster). On top of that, Daffy Duck is unreasonably used with less frequency than 1938, which is a pity since Wise Quacks (Warren Foster) is quite solid with the hilarious gag “Me drinking? Yes” and Scalp Trouble (Ernest Gee) is also pretty passable. The rest is either okay or plain boring, since Clampett’s gags may usually land, but his setups aren’t as crafty and effective as they used to, despite a solid animation staff without Chuck Jones and Bobe Cannon, too (John Carey, Izzy Ellis, Norm McCabe, Vive Risto and Dave Hoffman). What a nosedive after only a year.\n\n-As for Dalton and Hardaway, they may be the first ones to use Happy Rabbit’s grey design in Hare-Um Scare-Um (Melvin Millar), which is a relevant phase for Bugs Bunny’s creation, but overall I’m not totally convinced by their outputs. They’re not as bad as Jack King, but they’re still middle-of-the-road, albeit with bits of nice animation by Herm Cohen, Gil Turner, Rod Scribner and Dick Bickenbach. That said, Porky and Teabiscuit (Melvin Millar) has a better second half than the first and Bars and Stripes Forever (Jack Miller) has actually a quite solid setup.\n\n-Jones’ first full year as a supervisor… on a positive note, he definitely wants to astound more than to entertain. His cartoons look downright gorgeous, given a great animation staff (Bob McKimson, Ken Harris, Phil Monroe, A.C. Gamer, Rudy Larriva and Rod Scribner), but at the same time their slow, like SUPER SLOW pacing and scarce entertaining mood make them plain unwatchable. How is that a Daffy Duck cartoon manages to flow so slowly? Daffy Duck and the Dinosaur (Dave Monahan) isn’t even that bad, but pacing is so slow it butchers every single gag, even if it involves Daffy of all characters. Little Brother Rat (Rich Hogan) is… okay, but I don’t think this is the right paragraph where Sniffles is to be described.\n\n-Avery’s year is so forgettable I can hardly find a particularly flawed cartoon of his. Most of them aren’t even as bad as The Mice Will Play and A Sunbonnet Blue, but again, I’m losing interest in his documentaries, since they’re getting kinda repetitive with those same old puns. Fresh Fish (Jack Miller) is the perfect example, you know you’re running out of ideas when you make random fish the protagonists of your short. Documentaries aside, Hamateur Night (Jack Miller) is mostly boring, but the Eggheaded ending kinda saves it.\n\n-It’s not the best year for Clampett, either: Porky’s Picnic is unnecessarily mean-spirited, but I can save the ending for its comeuppance, Polar Pals (Warren Foster) is oddly schmaltzy, Jeepers Creepers (Ernest Gee) is pretty bland, but Naughty Neighbors (Warren Foster) manages to be worse than all of them, by portraying a feud for the sake of a pointless romance. I cannot accept such schmaltzy nonsense from the director of Porky in Wackyland. He totally jumped the shark.\n\n-As for Dalton and Hardaway’s mostly mediocre output, Porky the Giant Killer (Jack Miller) is bland with a few tips of annoyance, Sioux Me (Melvin Millar) doesn’t even try not to rip off Avery’s Porky the Rain-Maker and Fagin’s Freshman (Jack Miller) is THAT trite kind of plot we saw billions of times.\n\n-Jones’ Disney bootleg era is plain unwatchable, content-wise: Robin Hood Does Good (Dave Monahan) is too slow and dull, The Good Egg (Dave Monahan) is inevitably boring with a poor attempt of a suicide joke, which manages to look disturbing in a slow-paced cartoon and Old Glory… is probably necessary for the sake of reiterating some pure patriotism in view of WWII, but 9 minutes of uncle Sam’s condescending narration of the whole American history in slow-mo are a complete waste of time. Calling it boring would be a compliment, it’s unwatchable and pretentious garbage. As for Inki’s character, I can at least appreciate the fact he’s treated as a character, and not as a floating stereotype. Pretty progressive for its time.\n\nIt’s not over, yet, since I got to address the elephant in the room, or better, the mouse in the room, Sniffles.\n\nHe’s not a bad character.\n\nMuch worse, he’s pointless. He’s NOTHING. What does he do? How is he like? What’s his utility? Is he entertaining? FUCK NO. I’ll never like him, he fucking SUCKS.\n\n1940\n\nFebruary, 10th: Busy Bakers = last cartoon directed by Ben Hardaway and Cal Dalton as Friz Freleng returned in late 1939.\n\nMarch, 2nd: Elmer’s Candid Camera (Jones) = first appearance of ELMER FUDD and last appearance of Happy Rabbit.\n\nMarch, 30th: Confederate Honey = first cartoon directed by Friz Freleng, started by Hardaway and Dalton.\n\nMay, 18th: You Ought to Be in Pictures = first cartoon directed by Friz Freleng since returning to Leon Schlesinger’s studios, taking over Hardaway and Dalton’s unit.\n\nJuly, 27th: A Wild Hare (Avery) = first appearance of BUGS BUNNY, first pairing of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, nominated for an Academy Award for best animated short film.\n\nDecember, 7th: Of Fox and Hounds (Avery) = first appearance of Willoughby.\n\nDecember, 21st: The Timid Toreador = first cartoon directed by Norman McCabe.\n\nAlbeit not a memorable decade prologue, 1940 has far more things to recall than 1939. It’s the year of Freleng’s necessary return from his disappointing experience at MGM and also of the birth of a new character, who would quickly become an animated icon, Willoughby.\n\nAfter a decade, the audience is drastically losing interest in stale characters and stale stories, Porky Pig’s mild contribution isn’t sufficient to improve the situation and Daffy Duck is still underused for some reason. Schlesinger’s studios needed another icon like… that other studio with Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, thus they decided to fix Happy Rabbit to create the ultimate icon, who officially appeared in late Summer 1940 and would change WB completely.\n\nFreleng’s return is indeed a welcome one, since Hardaway and Dalton’s output wasn’t really on par with their senior [their only yearly contribution is Busy Bakers (Jack Miller), which is nothing special] and WB desperately needed the veteran’s comeback to rise again after a very difficult year. His animation staff is basically the one left by Hardaway and Dalton (Dalton is back as an animator, Herm Cohen, Gil Turner, Dick Bickenbach and Gerry Chiniquy later).\n\n–YOU OUGHT TO BE IN PICTURES (Jack Miller) is easily his best cartoon of the year, the perfect metaphor of his return at Schlesinger’s studios, starring Daffy and Porky interacting with Schlesinger himself. Very good cartoon, in which we see a more deceiving and manipulative side of Daffy’s character compared to Porky’s milder personality. One of the earliest instances after times of screwball Daffy hegemony.\n\n–Porky’s Baseball Broadcast (Ben Hardaway) is decent, even though building up a cartoon around visual puns is kinda getting stale and predictable.\n\n–Little Blabbermouse (Ben Hardaway) is a mediocre one and its “sequel” Shop, Look and Listen (Dave Monahan) isn’t much better: there’s a talkative mouse, like THAT talkative duck from It’s an Ill Wind, which is very original (I wonder if they’re going to use this trope in the future) and a boring dancing/singing segment. So uninspired and dull.\n\n–Malibu Beach Party (Jack Miller) is incredibly boring. I honestly don’t really care for these shorts involving celebrities, because there’s too many. At least they can be considered caricatures, unlike modern Simpsons constantly giving BJs to their V.I.P.\n\nAvery’s 1940 can be considered an improvement over an actual year of nothing, even though there’s still too many documentaries, this format is so repetitive. Animation-wise, there’s indeed a massive change in his cartoons: animated objects shouldn’t always look zany, but also showcase some finesse. In spite of Irv Spence and Cecil Surry’s departure to MGM, he still manages to build up a powerhouse unit (Bob McKimson from Jones’ unit, his younger brother Chuck, Virgil Ross, Sid Sutherland, Paul Smith and Rod Scribner).\n\n–The Bear’s Tale (Ben Hardaway) is a welcome return to form for Avery, a return to fable parodies like Little Red Walking Hood or upcoming Red Hot Riding Hood at MGM. Good cartoon with Avery’s classic metahumor, like the written reading time on the letter. Papa Bear’s laugh is amazing.\n\n–A WILD HARE (Rich Hogan) is a highlight for Avery and also for WB. At first, it may look far too simple and extraneous from his humor, why should a hunter trying to catch a wild hare be entertaining? Because Avery put another milestone after Porky’s Duck Hunt, that is the birth of Bugs Bunny. While it’s true this cartoon may be a bit too simple compared to his future shorts, it’s still enough to be considered the best one of 1940.\n\n-Avery’s documentaries are okay, they’re not terrible, but they’re too predictable and repetitive. Sometimes the setup may be different, be it a circus in Circus Today (Jack Miller), planes in Ceiling Hero (Dave Monahan) or involve a sexualized deer and a lizard shedding her skin like a stripper in Cross Country Detours (Rich Hogan), nevertheless it’s only about the same old gags and puns.\n\n–A Gander at Mother Goose (Dave Monahan) isn’t bad, either, but it’s basically another documentary disguised as a fable anthology. What’s the purpose considering The Bear’s Tale had already been released?\n\n–The Early Worm Gets the Bird (Jack Miller) is Avery’s worst cartoon of the year. So boring, so trite, there’s nothing innovative or creative about it.\n\nKinda mediocre year for Clampett (John Carey, Izzy Ellis, Norm McCabe, Vive Risto, Dave Hoffman). You can deduce he actually tried to revive his Porky series, by borrowing Avery’s documentary format for shorts like Africa Squeaks, whose results are still insufficient to recover some of his interest in Porky’s character. In fact, he doesn’t even get to appear in his own cartoons that much, like in Slap Happy Pappy, in which he’s not even the protagonist.\n\n-Although, THE SOUR PUSS (Warren Foster) is rather funny, with moments like Porky mimicking a fish or the classic Lew Lehr ending (probably one of my favorite cultural references of WB). Slight, yet not absolute return to 1938 Clampett, with one of the many suicide gags of his edgelord era.\n\n–Prehistoric Porky (Melvin Millar) is also pretty alright, with a great beginning and a few solid gags, like the twist around Porky’s “doggo”.\n\n–Porky’s Poor Fish (Melvin Millar) has the main flaw of being downright predictable. Nothing bad, but I’ve seen better. Also, another Porky cartoon, in which he gets little screen time.\n\nAnother pretty bad year for Jones. It’s quite a bitter irony the McKimson era helped Avery and Clampett’s careers grow, whereas it managed to impress ONLY in terms of visuals in Jones’ case, because comedy is non-existent, gags lack proper timing and the constantly sluggish pacing makes irrefutably gorgeous cartoons UNWATCHABLE. I mean, his staff is still strong (Bob McKimson momentarily before joining Avery’s unit, Ken Harris, Phil Monroe, Rudy Larriva and also Bobe Cannon and Phil DeLara), but his cartoons still struggle to convince due to said reasons.\n\n–Elmer’s Candid Camera (Rich Hogan) is kinda alright, if we pretend it wasn’t that soporific. Elmer crying after apparently smothering Bugs Bunny’s dumb cousin is so sluggish it’s unironically hilarious. Not to mention Elmer’s pedo expression at the beginning, which is funny for the opposite reasons.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Good Night Elmer (Rich Hogan) isn’t even that terrible. Sure, its flaws are so evident, starting with the excessive slowness and repetitiveness, but at least it’s watchable. Curiously enough, I also expected far worse from Bedtime from Sniffles (Dave Monahan), which is actually another watchable cartoon. Nothing stands out about it, but it’s pretty much harmless. If I got to give credit to Jones’ 1940 cartoons is for his post-McKimson entries being actually watchable, which isn’t much of a compliment, but it’s still something.\n\n-However, Stage Fright (Rich Hogan) stars the curious puppies, who didn’t really bring solid memories in 1939, and here’s no exception. There’s barely any plot, these dogs are as dull as Pluto and gags aren’t too effective.\n\n–Sniffles Takes a Trip (Dave Monahan) is embarrassing for how slow it is. Animation is exceptional, backgrounds look wonderful, but there’s no substance whatsoever. Sniffles is unable to hold up an animated film all by himself, he just can’t. The Egg Collector is basically Little Brother Rat 2.0.\n\n-Even so, we only reach the bottom with Tom Thumb in Trouble (Rich Hogan), which is just awful. Once again, it’s irreproachable animation-wise, but everything else is so unqualifiable it makes us wonder if it belongs to WB, because this is the most anti-WB content I’ve ever watched. Of course it’s possible to try something different, but this feels more like a tease. It cannot even be qualified as a parody, because it takes itself way too seriously. It has NO gags, NO comedy, characters have NO personality and overall, Tom Thumb is more like a sore thumb and his father’s design looks abysmal. Wagner’s compositions are memorable, but this is worse than Old Glory, which says a lot. Tom Thumb is unforgivably terrible, it’s utter garbage.\n\n1941\n\nJanuary, 4th: Elmer’s Pet Rabbit = first Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Chuck Jones and also the first cartoon in which Bugs is given his name.\n\nMarch, 1st: The Cat’s Tale (Freleng) = special ending cue.\n\nMarch, 15th: Tortoise Beats Hare (Avery) = first appearance of Cecil Turtle.\n\nMarch, 29th: Porky’s Bear Facts (Freleng) = first LT cartoon with the faster and brassier version of the opening theme.\n\nApril, 19th: Porky’s Preview = last Porky Pig cartoon directed by Tex Avery.\n\nApril, 26th: The Trial of Mr. Wolf (Freleng) = first MM cartoon with the brassy version of the opening theme.\n\nJune, 7th: Hiawatha’s Rabbit Hunt = first Bugs Bunny directed by Friz Freleng, nominated for an Academy Award for best animated short film.\n\nJuly, 5th: The Heckling Hare (Avery) = first Bugs Bunny cartoon to use Bob McKimson’s shield intro.\n\nAugust, 30th: The Henpecked Duck (Clampett) = last cartoon to use the Porky in a drum opening.\n\nSeptember, 13th: All This and Rabbit Stew = last Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Tex Avery.\n\nSeptember, 27th: The Brave Little Bat (Jones) = last Sniffles cartoon of the Disney bootleg era.\n\nOctober, 25th: Robinson Crusoe, Jr. = first cartoon directed by Norman McCabe alone, taking Clampett’s older unit.\n\nNovember, 22nd: The Cagey Canary = cartoon started by Avery and completed by Clampett.\n\nDecember, 6th: Rhapsody in Rivets (Freleng) = nominated for an Academy Award for best animated short film.\n\nDecember, 20th: Wabbit Twouble = first cartoon directed by Bob Clampett with Avery’s old unit, first Bugs Bunny cartoon directed by Clampett and first use of fat Elmer.\n\nDecember, 27th: Porky’s Pooch = last cartoon directed by Bob Clampett with his old unit.\n\n1941 is a further improvement over 1940. Whilst not the best year, its highs are still more numerous than 1940 and overall, WB is gradually finding its identity. It’s year of Bugs Bunny being used more frequently (either as a wild and slick trickster or as a pet…), of Freleng’s consecration, of the infamous quarrel between Avery and Schlesinger, which caused the former to leave the studio for good, of Clampett launching his Clampett 2.0 era. So… several events occurred this year.\n\nStarting with Freleng, he’s constantly showing his directing skills, his comedy and music timing. Speaking of which, he finally finds a way to make music-centered shorts interesting, that is building the plot around music instead of arranging prosaic mini-skits like he used to. So, this is a good year for the veteran, whose cartoons are often written by Mike Maltese. We’re definitely going to write down his name quite often from here onwards. Dick Bickenbach, Cal Dalton, Gil Turner, Gerry Chiniquy, Manny Perez and Herm Cohen compose his unit.\n\n–The Trial of Mr. Wolf (Mike Maltese) showcases the notorious fable from the wolf’s standpoint, which is a quite fresh idea for its time. This is by all means a good cartoon, with plenty of nice gags, like the wolf gaily picking flowers, the door scene (which will be seen in an even better cartoon) and the details around the wolf’s compass.\n\n–Notes to You (Mike Maltese) has Porky getting annoyed by a random cat at night, whose singing doesn’t make him sleep. Even though its 1948 remake, with different characters, would be massively better, this one is still solid. Maybe that nameless cat isn’t a very convincing foe for Porky.\n\n–RHAPSODY IN RIVETS (Mike Maltese) is a music-centered cartoon done RIGHT. The main protagonist here is neither the conductor, nor the workers. The main protagonist is Franz Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody no. 2, which won’t be used this time ONLY, seamlessly timed with the various building segments. Almost every visual gag works, Stalling’s arrangement is terrific and Freleng is basically unrivalled when it comes to match up music and animation.\n\n–Rookie Revue (Dave Monahan) MAY provide a few amusing bits, but also reminds me I HATE DOCUMENTARIES. They’re so goddamn lazy. I don’t care for these undeveloped NPCs, either.\n\n–Sport Chumpions (Mike Maltese) is ANOTHER DOCUMENTARY. Skip it.\n\n-Quite absurd Avery’s last year at WB is actually his best. By now even his own animators get to receive specific roles in his cartoons, since there’s Sid Sutherland, Rev Chaney, Chuck McKimson and then THE BIG THREE… Virgil Ross represents FINESSE, Rod Scribner represents ENERGY and Bob McKimson is Bob McKimson. Everyone in the studio acknowledges McKimson’s skills, someone even projects him as Avery’s successor for how dominant he’s proven to be. While it’s too soon for him to be a full-fledged supervisor, he still happens to act as an additional supervisor under Avery, too, much like Chuck Jones while in Clampett’s unit.\n\n–TORTOISE BEATS HARE (Dave Monahan) is more or less like 1936’s The Blow Out, with Cecil Turtle instead of Porky and Bugs Bunny instead of the villain, only much better. Unlike A Wild Hare, everything about this smells like Avery from start to finish. Literally from the start, as Bugs reads the opening credits and the full title, and complains about a tortoise beating a hare as a WB employee. He constantly breaks the 4th wall throughout the whole picture and Cecil always appears to have the upper hand over Bugs, whose trickster personality doesn’t get to shine due to his rival’s cleverness. Avery does definitely enjoy the hounding formula he’d take it up to eleven at MGM, with 1943’s Dumb-Hounded, which would provide an even more absurd and hysterical setup.\n\n–All This and Rabbit Stew (Dave Monahan) is easily the best one of the Censored Eleven, even though it’s pretty simple to cross the line with racist content. It actually has some funny moments, like the bear bit and the notorious log segment, which would be reused by Clampett later on.\n\n–The Heckling Hare (Mike Maltese) represents the quintessential Bugs Bunny outsmarting his hunter. Every bit of this cartoon is great, from Scribner’s specular expressions to the incredible tomato scene (also mostly Scribner), from McKimson making a simple bit like Bugs putting on his swimming cap look mindblowing to the infamous ending, which cost Avery’s stay at WB.\n\nSchlesinger didn’t appreciate the original ending so much that Avery accused him to interfere with his job. The rest… we already know.\n\n–Hollywood Steps Out (Melvin Millar) involves celebrities. Not the most exciting idea on paper, in fact the first half isn’t that great. Thankfully, the cartoon picks up with the ball dance, Peter Lorre’s comment and a pretty funny ending.\n\n–Porky’s Preview (Dave Monahan) is a mixed bag. Decent beginning and decent ending, middle is way too repetitive. I know what they wanted to recreate, but gets tiresome too quickly.\n\n–The Bug Parade (Dave Monahan)… I suppose even Avery’s last year at WB isn’t exempt from lousymentaries, is it?\n\n–Aviation Vacation (Dave Monahan)… COME ON. The election gag is kinda funny, but I can’t simply bear any more of this format. THREE YEARS OF IT ARE TOO MUCH.\n\nTo be honest, nobody knows what would’ve happened if he’d stuck to Warner. Stuff like Red Hot Riding Hood obviously wouldn’t exist, maybe in favor of more dull documentaries. Nobody will ever know the answer. Then again, I feel he eventually found his real identity at MGM, since his cartoons feel far less restrained than those from his WB period. In fact, after rewatching each one of his shorts, I admit I was kinda underwhelmed by his output, due to weak plots and those cursed documentaries.\n\nClampett’s year has been pretty strange. On one hand, he partially moves away from Porky cartoons and attempts something different.\n\nUnfortunately, if THAT something different happens to be a documentary, it’s obviously going to fail. His unit isn’t much different from the previous year (Izzy Ellis, John Carey, Vive Risto and Norm McCabe), the latter of whom would supervise Robinson Crusoe Jr. (Melvin Millar), a pretty meh short, taking over Clampett’s former unit.\n\n-I never got the hype behind The Henpecked Duck (Warren Foster). It’s not very heavy on jokes, but I suppose it’s passable. The doorknob gag is quite humorous, though.\n\n–A Coy Decoy (Melvin Millar) is also pretty alright. Books would eventually get a bigger role in an upcoming cartoon.\n\n–Porky’s Snooze Reel (Warren Foster) is pretty decent and Porky imitating Lew Lehr is hilarious.\n\n–Porky’s Pooch (Warren Foster) features Cal Dalton in Clampett’s unit. Likeable cartoon, whose plot would be reprised by Chuck Jones later on.\n\n–Meet John Doughboy (Warren Foster) is another poor excuse of a WWII documentary. Skip this.\n\n–Farm Frolics (Warren Foster) is the umpteenth NPC anthology. Repetitive, we watched too many of these.\n\n-As for Goofy Groceries (Melvin Millar), it’s like a ’30s cartoon and it’s no compliment, sadly. Only singing and dancing in 1941 is insufficient entertainment.\n\nThen, Avery left Schlesinger’s studios. He’d also started a few cartoons such as The Cagey Canary (Mike Maltese), Aloha Hooey (Mike Maltese) and Crazy Cruise (Mike Maltese), which were all completed by Clampett with Avery’s former unit. This was the right occasion for Clampett to shine, since he was pretty much considered Avery’s natural successor. As a result, this event definitely brought us a new Clampett, more vivid and footloose than the Clampett 1.0. of the Porky era, taking over Avery’s unit (McKimson and the others) and leaving his former one to McCabe. And thus Clampett 2.0. was born, the one people remembers the most.\n\n–WABBIT TWOUBLE (Dave Monahan) was, too, begun by Avery, as seen by Bugs’ design changing in the two halves. It’s the first cartoon to feature fat Elmer Fudd, as a caricature of his voice actor, Arthur Q. Bryan and also the first time Bugs Bunny appears in a Clampett cartoon. This is the reason why he’s the only one who could replace Avery, because they share a similar approach to humor, as there’s no serious difference between Avery’s part and the rest of the short. Visual gags are strong, like Elmer’s pajamas under his clothes, Scribner’s grin of Elmer after being smooched by Bugs (amazing expression) or Elmer casually uprooting a tree while escaping. Another gimmick, typical of Clampett 2.0., would also be switching animators in the same scene, as he decides to swap Ross and McKimson back and forth during Bugs’ bear impression. Never understand why he’d do it, this new Clampett follows no rules, and if he does, they’re his own rules.\n\nNevertheless, it’s definitely a milestone for his career and no, I still don’t know how Bugs mocking Elmer would ever become a meme.\n\nJones’ year is mostly bland, albeit not as bad as the recent past. His unit is great and all (Ken Harris, Rudy Larriva, Phil Monroe, Bobe Cannon, Phil DeLara and Ben Washam), his cartoons are watchable at the very least, but he’s still seeking a precise and unique identity. Unlike the other supervisors, he’s struggling to leave an impression, even if he’s been slightly drifting apart from his Disney approach in a while.\n\n–Elmer’s Pet Rabbit (Rich Hogan) features Jones’ alternate view of Bugs Bunny, in his 2nd appearance overall, as a pet without his frontal tooth and yellow gloves. No deceiving pray this time, what we do get is a pampered pet. Kinda questionable characterization, to be fair. While its pacing is no butcher like Tom Thumb, its gags are still kinda weak, this Bugs isn’t an entertaining jerk like he should, but more like a grumpy douchebag. The only funny bit is hearing Milt Franklin’s score of To Hare is Human (the carrot patch scene) when Elmer turns on the radio in the dubbed version.\n\n–Sniffles Bells the Cat (Rich Hogan) is way too slow, but it’s not the worst Sniffles cartoon.\n\n–Inki and the Lion is a Little Lion Hunter replica. Once again, props to Jones for not treating a black character like a joke, but this isn’t a massively successful series.\n\n–Snow Time for Comedy (Rich Hogan) indeed, it’s no time for comedy with the curious dummies. Meh.\n\n–The Brave Little Bat (Rich Hogan) is meh, filled with NPCs, including Sniffles. ESPECIALLY Sniffles. I guess the talkative flying mouse foreshadows Sniffles’ future characterization…\n\n–Saddle Silly (Rich Hogan) isn’t terrible, again, but it’s so bland I literally got nothing to discuss about. It’s not even hilariously awful like Tom Thumb or Old Glory, it’s watchable but leaves zero impression. These NPCs clearly don’t help Jones improve his cartoons and Hogan-Jones isn’t a very good duo.\n\n1942\n\nMarch, 14th: Crazy Cruise = last WB cartoon started by Tex Avery.\n\nApril, 25th: Dog Tired (Jones) = last appearance of The Curious Puppies.\n\nMay, 2nd: The Wacky Wabbit (Clampett) = features a special 1941-45 MM ending theme.\n\nJune, 6th: Hold the Lion, Please (Jones) = no Bugs intro, Bugs becomes shorter in this short.\n\nJuly, 11th: Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid (Clampett) = first appearance of Beaky Buzzard.\n\nAugust, 8th: The Squawkin’ Hawk (Jones) = first appearance of HENERY HAWK.\n\nAugust, 22nd: Fresh Hare (Freleng) = last use of fat Elmer.\n\nSeptember, 5th: The Impatient Patient (McCabe) = last LT cartoon to use the ‘Porky on a fence’ intro and the 1939-1942 Porky in a drum outro.\n\nOctober, 3rd: The Hep Cat (Clampett) = first LT cartoon in technicolor.\n\nOctober, 24th: The Daffy Duckaroo (McCabe) = first LT cartoon with the Daffy-Porky intro.\n\nNovember, 21st: A Tale of Two Kitties (Clampett) = first appearance of TWEETY BIRD.\n\nDecember, 5th: My Favorite Duck (Jones) = first LT cartoon in 3-hue technicolor.\n\nIn spite of some duds, this is possibly the year in which WB finally found its identity, laying the groundwork for the upcoming years: more spotlight to solid characters rather than forgettable NPCs. Of course, mistakes had to be made, but the main fault of 1942 isn’t focusing on WWII too much, but the exact opposite, that is continuing its obsession with the past. The sooner WB gets rid of documentaries, the sooner it’ll take off. This isn’t a very gloryfying year, overall.\n\nDick Bickenbach, Gerry Chiniquy, Manny Perez, Gil Turner, Ken Champin and Phil Monroe (from Jones’ staff) are still in Freleng’s unit, whereas Herm Cohen joined the army and his former successor Cal Dalton would permanently join McCabe’s unit in the same year. Even though no cartoon of his managed to be nominated for an Oscar, this was still a rather solid year for the veteran, albeit with some mishaps.\n\n–The Wabbit Who Came to Supper (Mike Maltese) might be a rollercoaster in terms of visuals, since Dalton’s expressions on Elmer look hilarious, whereas Turner draws a very poor Bugs Bunny (he looks really bad), but I guess it’s a solid cartoon. I’m not too fond of Bugs’ character here, who’s shown as quite submissive at the beginning and pretty annoying later on, but the nickel scene is strangely overlooked (it’s a great gag in its subtlety) and the “lingerie door” is hilarious. This so-called inheritance plot would be developed in a simpler, yet more effective way in MGM’s The Million Dollar Cat two years later, with Jerry constantly putting Tom to a severe test throughout the whole picture, until the MEMORABLE ending. On the other hand, this ending over here has nothing to do with the entire plot. It happens. Just like the weird swap between Turner and Bickenbach during the melodrama scene.\n\n–Fresh Hare (Mike Maltese) is an average Bugs-Elmer cartoon, with a pretty questionable ending. And no, I’m not saying this because it’s animated by Gil Turner.\n\n–The Hare-BrainedHypnotist (Mike Maltese) is easily his best Bugs-Elmer entry of the year. First time for a (momentary) role reversal between the two, with Elmer becoming the rabbit and Bugs being the hunter. THIS should’ve deserved to become a meme, more than Big Chungus. One of the funniest expressions ever created.\n\n–Porky’s Pastry Pirates (Dave Monahan) wouldn’t even be so bad, but that bee is downright obnoxious and Porky is no Bugs, unfortunately.\n\nOnto his worst entries, which are quite a few.\n\n-If Rhapsody in Rivets was a music-centered cartoon done right, Lights Fantastic (Dave Monahan) is the total opposite: back to outdated mini-skits because… ’30s nostalgia? Very hit and miss.\n\n–Foney Fables (Mike Maltese) is the umpteenth lousy anthology with a recurring gag. This format felt stale with Avery, with Clampett, with McCabe and also with him… basically with ANYONE. It’s better to stick with ONE organic plot rather than many lazy mini-plots.\n\n–Ding Dog Daddy (Tedd Pierce) involves a horny dog with Goofy’s voice having a statue fetish. Nothing interesting about it, it’s bland and dull.\n\n–Saps in Chaps (Dave Monahan)… documentaries in 1942. Fuck this.\n\nI kinda expected a bit more from Clampett’s year, to be honest. While he had far worse times as a supervisor in the recent past, his experience has definitely been a rollercoaster this year. He ranges from unquestionably good, maybe even great cartoons to incomprehensible and searing bombs.\n\nAnimation-wise, Bob McKimson, Rod Scribner, Virgil Ross, Sid Sutherland and Rev Chaney compose his unit. Just like Cohen, McKimson’s younger brother was drafted for WWII.\n\n–Horton Hatches an Egg (Mike Maltese), Clampett’s rendition of Dr. Seuss’ tale. All in all, it’s a good parody, well-animated but quite light on jokes. Then again, I guess he couldn’t take so many liberties here.\n\n–The Wacky Wabbit (Warren Foster) is the exact opposite, as Clampett takes as many liberties as he can, starting with the humor, which is founded more on situations than on slapstick: why would Bugs join Elmer’s singing while wearing a skull? Why wouldn’t Elmer pickax the spot marked X? Why would Elmer wear a girdle? Why would Elmer lose his colors while he’s scared? Nobody can give an answer to these, but the last question, since Scribner is gradually becoming a protagonist in Clampett’s unit. If he felt a bit restrained with Jones and started getting the hang of it with Avery, he’s finally met his consecration with Clampett, through amazing expressivity and aggressive timing much like John Carey during his black and white era. No matter how much importance McKimson possesses, lots of people would link Clampett’s cartoons with Scribner for his artistic impact. Overall, it’s a classic cartoon. Not the best, but still solid.\n\n-I suppose we could say the same about Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid (Warren Foster) to an extent, despite some Averyesque idle time, especially during Bugs’ melodrama. It’s another pretty solid cartoon, Beaky Buzzard is an entertaining character, some gags are indeed hilarious, like Beaky disturbing Bugs’ shower or the casual dance (amazing bit animated by Virgil Ross), but the ending kinda diminishes the whole effort. Not the best.\n\n–A Tale of Two Kitties (Warren Foster), the first time Tweety Bird appears, as well as Babbitt and Catsello (this time as cats). Personally, I sometimes prefer Clampett’s “pinker” Tweety more than Freleng’s “helpless” canary bird, since he’s probably involved in less predictable situations (or maybe because these nameless cats cannot be sympathized like Sylvester), or his trickster attitude disguised as a pray makes him as likeable as Bugs, for example. Less cute than Freleng’s Tweety, but more functional to comedy. He’s way more independent as a character.\n\n–The Hep Cat (Warren Foster) involves a horny cat having a fetish for a puppet. Much like Ding Dong Daddy, this is nothing special. Even masters like McKimson, Ross and Scribner can’t do much if the content is THIS poor. Willoughby is back… big deal, it’s a forgettable cartoon.\n\n–Aloha Hooey (Mike Maltese) is one of those few shorts Avery didn’t get to complete, which is a pity since we could easily do without it. Story is boring, filled with clichés, characters are NPCs, ending is too schmaltzy. Skip it.\n\n–Crazy Cruise (Mike Maltese) is another one of those shorts begun by Avery, which happens to be a documentary. Next.\n\n–Wacky Blackout (Warren Foster) is another sloppy anthology. Moving on.\n\n–Eatin’ on the Cuff (Warren Foster) is a very poor attempt to unite live-action footage with animation, which would actually be interesting if the animated plot wasn’t such a bore. Once again, dealing with NPCs, with stale setup and uninteresting situations. Moths as protagonists? Are we in the ’30s???\n\nThis year has been quite different for Jones. For the first time, his cartoons finally got an identity and actually started being funny. Animation is slightly more limited and smeary, but feels far more functional in order to create a smoother pacing and more natural comedy. On top of that, his animation staff (Ken Harris, Rudy Larriva, Bobe Cannon, Ben Washam, Phil DeLara) also gets its own identity, as each animator now has his own recognizable style, instead of that McKimson’s carbon copy feeling. At long last we get one of the first running gags, the ‘annoyed glare’ which would be so frequent in these early cartoons. However, mistakes had to be made, as this wasn’t properly a very good year.\n\n–MY FAVORITE DUCK (Mike Maltese) is Jones’ best of the year and one of the earliest collabs of the Duo. On paper, the plot may look similar to The Wabbit Who Came to Supper (same writer), minus the estate, but works a lot better, since Daffy fits that role way more than Bugs, since he’s the screwy and bothersome character, who constantly torments Porky just because. Speaking of Porky, he’s not the same “fluffy” and easygoing character of Clampett’s black and white series. This Porky is actually IRRITABLE, as Daffy constantly puts him to a test, until he regrets giving him a shotgun once duck season opens. In fact, unlike Wabbit, the last segment is what makes this cartoon satisfying, not only for its climax, but also for the ending breaking the 4th wall. Pretty substantial cartoon, with some funny scenes like the baby eagle’s gibberish after its parent slams the frying pan on Porky’s face.\n\n–Case of Missing Hare (Tedd Pierce) features one of the earliest instances of the “Bugs getting his revenge” plot, which would become a cornerstone for the studios. Solid cartoon with some funny gags like Ala Bahma’s sword performance.\n\n–The Draft Horse (Tedd Pierce) is Jones’ first cartoon in chronological order to make room for entertainment and comedy. It’s indeed a decent short with its moments, like the brush scene and the colonel’s emotional reaction after the horse’s melodrama.\n\n-As for The Dover Boys (Tedd Pierce), I definitely understand its importance in terms of animation, but it’s a mixed bag in terms of EVERYTHING ELSE. A few scenes do work, like the “removing young lady from a tree” instructions, the Dover Boys’ excessively shocked reaction and the young lady’s super strength. Unfortunately the rest is pretty much back and forth of corny and cringy moments involving NPCs, because let’s face it, the Dover Boys are NPCs anyhow. They try so hard to be entertaining, but they kinda aren’t. Not a cartoon I’d willingly rewatch.\n\n–Conrad the Sailor (Dave Monahan) is also pretty much decent. I’d like to appreciate it a bit more if Conrad the Cat wasn’t such a shitty character, but Daffy is fantastic as ever.\n\n–The Bird Came C.O.D. (Rich Hogan) a.k.a. the mistake that didn’t have to be made. Apparently, the bird gag from 1939’s Stage Fright was so great it needed to reappear here and if Conrad the Cat sucked as a supporting character, he’s even shittier as a main character. Then again, this kind of experiment is still more admirable than creating a lazymentary.\n\nUnlike the other supervisors, McCabe stuck to Looney Tunes only. His staff is the one left by Clampett (Izzy Ellis, John Carey, Vive Risto and Cal Dalton), so it’s no surprise to watch solid-looking cartoons, animation-wise. In terms of content, he ranges from lousymentaries to Daffy Duck shorts, therefore you might easily deduce the inconsistent nature of his cartoons.\n\n–THE IMPATIENT PATIENT (Don Christensen) has a quite oddly sinister atmosphere therein, possibly not even the closest setup to average WB, but Daffy is good as ever, the dance number is a great scene (I like Daffy being happy to dance with Mr. Hyde) and overall, it results in a rather solid cartoon.\n\n–The Ducktators (Melvin Millar) has probably the most faithful representation of Mussolini. I like how they make him so dumb, fully reflecting reality. More educational than entertaining, in actuality.\n\n–Daffy’s Southern Exposure (Don Christensen) is another solid cartoon, featuring the most evil-looking Carmen Miranda ever drawn. Because Cal Dalton.\n\n–The Daffy Duckaroo (Melvin Millar) is definitely the weaker among McCabe’s Daffy cartoons. Mediocre at most, with not the most creative plot.\n\n-Be free to call it either documentary or narrated anthology, but at the end of the day Hobby Horse-Laffs (Melvin Millar) still blows for how unimaginative and lazy it does appear. Once Warner gets rid of this pitiful format, it’ll inevitably improve. For now, I’m still convinced documentaries suck.\n\n1943\n\nJanuary, 23rd: Confusions of a Nutzy Spy = last Porky Pig cartoon directed by Norm McCabe.\n\nFebruary, 2nd: Pigs in a Polka (Freleng) = nominated for an Academy Award for best animated short film.\n\nFebruary, 20th: Tortoise Wins by a Hare (Clampett) = first short with Bob McKimson’s Bugs Bunny design, sequel of 1941’s Tortoise Beats Hare.\n\nMarch, 6th: To Duck or Not to Duck (Jones) = first cartoon to pair Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd.\n\nApril, 17th: The Unbearable Bear (Jones) = first cartoon with talkative Sniffles.\n\nMay, 15th: Tokio Jokio = last cartoon directed by Norm McCabe.\n\nJune, 19th: The Aristo-Cat (Jones) = first appearance of Hubie and Bertie and Claude Cat.\n\nJuly, 17th: Porky Pig’s Feat = first cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin since his departure in 1938, final black and white appearance of Porky Pig.\n\nAugust, 21st: Scrap Happy Daffy (Tashlin) = final black and white appearance of Daffy Duck.\n\nDecember, 11th: Puss n’ Booty (Tashlin) = last black and white WB cartoon.\n\nIf WB found its identity in 1942, 1943 is the year of its ultimate maturity, of the birth of edgelord Clampett, of Tashlin’s return and the long-awaited goodbye to lazy documentaries. Good riddance. All in all, it’s been a pretty solid year for the studios (2nd half is probably better), albeit with an inferior number of released cartoons.\n\nWhile Freleng’s staff didn’t change that much from the previous year (Bickenbach, Chiniquy, Perez, Champin, Turner and Monroe), what did actually change in this year was the presence of music-centered cartoons, which were totally absent in 1942. Overall, this is another solid year for Freleng, maybe slightly more consistent than his 1942.\n\n–Pigs in a Polka (Mike Maltese) has been Freleng’s first music-centered cartoon since Rhapsody in Rivets. While it’s not innovative as the latter short, it’s definitely a solid addition to his roster. Sure, the three little pigs and the wolf may be NPCs, but Freleng’s capable staff and his timing skills give value to an otherwise average cartoon. I suppose this is when Gerry Chiniquy’s “performance quirk” shone for the first time.\n\n-You know who’s not a NPC? Bugs Bunny. And while Jack-Wabbit and the Beanstalk (Mike Maltese) isn’t among my favorite cartoons, I don’t mind rewatching it. It’s got a few amusing tips, like the giant’s wrist pendulum clock or Bugs’ duel trick backfiring.\n\n–Yankee Doodle Daffy (Tedd Pierce) isn’t terrible, but… where’s the plot? It’s only about Daffy performing, much to Porky’s annoyance. His performances are even quite long, too. Then again, I suppose it tries to imitate Avery’s hounding formula after the Carmen Miranda callback, but doesn’t work sufficiently because Freleng couldn’t be more different from Avery. Daffy annoys Porky over and over again and the story offers nothing else. Not the proudest effort.\n\n–The Fifth-Column Mouse (Mike Maltese) is definitely Freleng’s worst of the year. Once again, it’s not that bad, but that cat is obnoxiously boring and the mouse army is filled with NPCs. Regardless of the cat being a subtle Nazi reference, the plot is still uninteresting, visual gags aren’t the best, the cat has as much personality as my shoes and the mice are generic. Period. Weak entry.\n\nAfter a rollercoaster year, Clampett immediately decides to change his approach. And by immediately I mean RIGHT FROM THE START. In fact, the year begins with Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs, which already shows a brand-new Clampett, the Edgelord with his loud, rapid-fire, non-stop, often borderline gags, filled with lots and lots of incomprehensible switches. No joke here, anything about this era of his is hard to decipher, starting with his animation staff. Apparently, only McKimson, Scribner and Ross get to be his regulars, whereas Tom McKimson, Manny Gould, Phil Monroe and even Disney veteran Art Babbitt appear in rotation (Bob McKimson would often correct their artwork). Trying to guess the animation staff of a Clampett cartoon is nearly IMPOSSIBLE, because he doesn’t certainly make the thing much easier, especially due to his switches getting more and more cryptic. Nonetheless, it’s still a crucial year for Clampett’s formation, as the edgelord era is the one people remember the most.\n\n–Tortoise Wins by a Hare (Warren Foster) is the sequel of 1941’s Tortoise Beats Hare by Avery. Is it a better cartoon? Well, it’s visually more courageous, since Bugs has never been THAT expressive up to that point. Scribner’s notorious segment is a scene everybody remembers for a very good reason, since his expressions look so wild and aggressive and key animation is basically perfect (then McKimson pops up to end things because Clampett’s logic). It totally describes Bugs’ mood, as he’s uncharacteristically more competitive and resenting than usual, willing to get his win against Cecil at all cost. If I understand why he’d act like that, I do believe he’s kinda out of character, since he seems to be more like Chuck Jones’ Daffy Duck than actual Bugs Bunny. Which is a bit too convenient, especially considering that Cecil is depicted for what he isn’t, charismatic. Which he really isn’t. He kinda sucks, he’s really nothing special and the fact Bugs lost to him TWICE in a row doesn’t make me appreciate this cartoon like I should. And the final suicide gag is gratuitous edgelord Clampett humor just because. I wonder if Rabbit Transit will fix these issues.\n\n–The Wise Quacking Duck (Warren Foster) is such a great cartoon, starring a great Daffy Duck and a funny sidekick. Also featuring Daffy’s awkward striptease animated by Disney legend Art Babbitt, because Clampett follows no logic.\n\n–Falling Hare (Warren Foster) is another instance of Bugs actually being overwhelmed by his foe to the point of humiliation. Unlike Tortoise Wins by a Hare, it actually works here because size doesn’t always matter and smaller ≠ dumber, I guess. It won’t be the only time Foster writes Bugs as more short-tempered and aggressive than usual. Powerhouse is featured in this cartoon.\n\n–A CORNY CONCERTO (Frank Tashlin) is the first anthology done correctly. Only two segments, few but good, quality over quantity. Maybe I like the Bugs-Porky segment better than the Blue Danube one, as it’s got THAT memorable climax by Scribner, involving Bugs passing out, the dog’s crying literally HARMONIZING with Stalling’s score (terrific detail) and the final twist around Bugs wearing bra, tutu and ballet shoes. Everything about this is amazing. The Blue Danube segment is less impressive, it’s got its moments like the motorboat duckling, Stalling’s score sounds likewise sublime, but… is it me or that swan is nearly Censored Eleven-like racist? I don’t know, something throws me off.\n\n-Speaking of Censored Eleven, Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs (Warren Foster) is loud and outdated at parts, but at least it tries to subvert classic fable tropes in a clever way. It’s quite progressive to hear black people voice black characters.\n\n–Tin Pan Alley Cats (Warren Foster) is loud and outdated, too. On top of that, at some point the short forgets what it is and suddenly believes it’s Porky in Wackyland. It’s indeed so lazy it reuses a considerable portion of the 1938 cartoon, completely out of nowhere.\n\nNot only Jones’ supervision is constantly growing, but he actually seems to have learned from the Conrad mistakes, thus providing a more consistent year than 1942. Either Tedd Pierce or Mike Maltese writes scripts and his staff is also evolving, since Lloyd Vaughan joins Harris, Washam, DeLara and Cannon, while Larriva leaves at some point, perhaps after Super-Rabbit.\n\n–To Duck or Not to Duck (Tedd Pierce) provides an alternate method to depict Daffy and Elmer’s rivalry, as a boxing match. Interesting how Jones likes to emphasize Daffy’s annoying attitude so that the audience would empathize with Elmer better. That ref is so impartial, isn’t he?\n\n–Super-Rabbit (Tedd Pierce) is a good cartoon, albeit not necessarily a sheer classic. The first encounter between Bugs and Cottontail Smith is a highlight, ending with Bugs casually feeding him with fodder, which is a very funny bit, and the whole Bugs playing basketball with a cannon ball is such a great segment, mostly animated by Bobe Cannon and Ken Harris (on Bugs cheering for himself). The ending is a clever reference to WWII heroism.\n\n–WACKIKI WABBIT (Tedd Pierce) involves spoofs of writers Pierce and Maltese as hungry castaways, willing to eat human knees, feet and rabbits, too. It’s got some funny moments, such as the tribal dance animated by Cannon, which is amazing because 1) no frame is recycled during the ritual, 2) Bugs’ angry eyes make it even more hilarious and 3) that tribal music is incredible, and the detail of the castaway’s menu (MENU:RABBIT, only ONE meal in a menu which is funny enough). Needless to say, Ken Harris is so great he can give life to a chicken. Another great bit. Overall, one of Jones’ earliest gems.\n\n–The Unbearable Bear (Mike Maltese) is a rather well-structured story, with some funny bits like the sleepwalking laundry and the bear defying the shelf gravity. It’s also known for featuring Sniffles’ return after a couple of years, this time as a blabbermouse… which is still an improvement over the Disney bootleg era, because any natural number > zero. Despite my general bias towards Sniffles, it’s not sufficient for me to consider this the worst of the year. Surprisingly solid cartoon.\n\n-On the other hand, Flop Goes the Weasel (Mike Maltese) is faithful to its title, because it’s the flop of the year. Conceptually similar to Avery’s The Sneezing Weasel, which already wasn’t too unforgettable, only with a pretty obnoxious Henery Hawk lookalike instead of Avery’s contagious laugh. I don’t really like this.\n\n1943 is especially the year of Frank Tashlin’s return after 5 years, and he’s back with a BANG in terms of everything. He takes over McCabe’s unit, which is already pretty strong, composed of Art Davis, Cal Dalton, Izzy Ellis and Disney animator Ray Patin (WB has been quite appetizing lately and Walt Disney wasn’t a very philanthropic boss…) (Phil Monroe appears in Porky Pig’s Feat), his layouts are as stunning and dynamic as ever and he doesn’t take much time to show why he’s an underrated supervisor. He only provides three cartoons, but sometimes quantity isn’t everything.\n\n–PORKY PIG’S FEAT (Melvin Millar) is a strong welcome back. Daffy is the driving force of this cartoon, the cinematography is excellent, the animation is simply impressive, as viewed in the elevator scene, animated by Cal Dalton, which isn’t cut because it doesn’t deserve to be cut, and the rope bit, tackled by Art Davis and Ray Patin, dynamically framed to perfection. This is also the first time Powerhouse has been played, which we’d hear lots and lots of times in the following media, and it’s quite interesting how Daffy’s opinion on Bugs Bunny was actually wholesome before Jones put up some antagonism. Great cartoon, strong comeback for Tash.\n\n–Scrap Happy Daffy (Don Christensen) may conceptually not be too far away from McCabe’s WWII-themed cartoons, but looks definitely more refined and less rough thanks to Tash’s supervision and layouts, which stand out tremendously during Daffy’s number. This results in a very solid short with its moments, like the clever helmet trope subversion, Daffy’s glasses on his rear and the whole Super America climax (the second Super Man parody of 1943 after Super-Rabbit). Each animator’s style emerges so easily, each of them is instantly recognizable: Davis is wild, Dalton is “overweight snobbishness”, Ellis is “slimness” and Patin is the Disney guy. No wonder his Daffy tends to look like a black-skinned Donald Duck.\n\n–Puss ‘n Booty (Warren Foster) is the weaker of the bunch. It’s still pretty decent, but not as compelling as the other two. Maybe Rudolph isn’t a particularly good character, kind of a NPC, to be fair. The ending is a bit grotesque.\n\nOkay, I suppose I have to talk about McCabe’s minor contribution, as well.\n\n–Confusions of a Nutzy Spy (Don Christensen) is an okay attempt to give one last chance to Porky to shine alone.\n\n–Hop and Go (Melvin Millar) is nothing special and unforgettable, minus the incredibly edgy ending with Tokyo in ruins, because U.S. never hold a grudge.\n\n–Tokio Jokio (Don Christensen) is the perfect demonstration of U.S. never holding grudges. I mean, they didn’t even try to mask their blatant racism towards Japan a little bit, did they? Merely a Japan-bashing propaganda from start to finish. Naturally the worst of the year.\n\n1944\n\nJanuary, 1st: Little Red Riding Rabbit (Freleng) = first cartoon to credit Mel Blanc on-screen.\n\nFebruary, 26th: Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears (Jones) = first appearance of The Three Bears.\n\nApril, 8th: Tick Tock Tuckered (Clampett) = color remake of Porky’s Badtime Story (1937).\n\nApril, 22nd: Bugs Bunny Nips to Nips (Freleng) = last Bugs Bunny cartoon with McKimson’s intro.\n\nMay, 6th: Swooner Crooner (Tashlin) = nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nJune, 17th: Slightly Daffy (Freleng) = color remake of Clampett’s Scalp Trouble (1939).\n\nJune, 24th: Hare Ribbin’ (Clampett) = with two alternate endings.\n\nJuly, 15th: Brother Brat = last Porky Pig cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin.\n\nAugust, 19th: Birdy and the Beast (Clampett) = last MM cartoon to credit Leon Schlesinger.\n\nAugust, 26th: Buckaroo Bugs (Clampett) = final WB cartoon to be produced by Leon Schlesinger and first LT cartoon to feature Bugs Bunny.\n\nSeptember, 2nd: Goldilocks and the Jivin’ Bears (Freleng) = first MM cartoon produced by Eddie Selzer.\n\nSeptember, 16th: Plane Daffy (Tashlin) = first LT cartoon produced by Eddie Selzer.\n\n1944 represents the end of an era, the epilogue of Leon Schlesinger studios officially becoming Warner Bros studios. Eddie Selzer becomes the new producer, who is just as “ignorant” as Schlesinger when it comes to animation. According to Jones’ thoughts, while Schlesinger pretty much tended to give staff some more liberties, Selzer wasn’t too enthusiastic and clung on some shortsighted ideas, involving some new characters and bullfights (we’ll get to it).\n\nOverall, it’s a good year in spite of several evitable duds.\n\nAfter 4 years, Gil Turner leaves Freleng’s unit to join Clampett’s, which isn’t really a huge loss considering his output getting iffier and iffier. On the flip side, former Clampett animator Virgil Ross happens to join Freleng’s unit permanently (alongside Chiniquy, Bickenbach, Perez, Champin and former Disney animator Jack Bradbury), where he’d regain his Avery-era finesse, after struggling with Clampett’s excessive modus operandi.\n\nFreleng’s 1944 output has been solider than 1943, he’s a very consistent supervisor.\n\n-So, Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips (Tedd Pierce) provides as much anti-Japan content as McCabe’s Tokio Jokio, but fortunately the cartoon is mostly decent with a pretty meh ending. We’d better overlook Bugs calling a Japanese soldier ‘monkey-face’.\n\n–Duck Soup to Nuts (Tedd Pierce) is a better Daffy-Porky cartoon than Yankee Doodle Daffy, for sure. It’s got some funny stuff, like Daffy’s sensual pose inside Porky’s rifle, Porky emptying an entire lake with a bucket and the eagle-pig charade. Good episode.\n\n–Hare Force (Tedd Pierce) is solid enough, mostly known for the electric chair reference. The ending got a nice twist.\n\n–Stage Door Cartoon (Mike Maltese) is his only Bugs-Elmer pairing of the year, but it’s still a pretty good one. I guess Freleng doesn’t consider Elmer an intimidating antagonist, which would explain the birth of another supporting character. It’s the very first cartoon to feature the Bugs Bunny dance (with a Greek temple behind, because yes), here animated by Chiniquy. I do like how the setting ranges from woods to an actual theater, from nature to civilization, which definitely gives more dynamism to the story. The ending surprises us with not one, but TWO twists, around the sheriff arresting Elmer and Bugs’ shenanigans. Elmer’s striptease is already far less awkward than Daffy’s in The Wise Quacking Duck and the audience actually applaudes it. They enjoyed it.\n\n–LITTLE RED RIDING RABBIT (Mike Maltese) is a great Red Riding Hood parody, subverting fable tropes. Starting with Red, who’s portrayed as a very lumbering, loud and annoying character, but that’s why it works. She’s funnily annoying, much to the wolf’s impatience and at some point even Bugs can’t put up with her, which eventually brings up a great ending. There’s lots of funny moments, like the pan of the shortcut to grandma’s house, the door segment and the copycat scene, handled with mastery. Easily the highlight of the cartoon, with the wolf being fooled by Bugs and getting annoyed by Red’s burst in, resulting in the wolf resuming his singing and dancing. Why would he do it? I don’t know, that’s why it’s a great scene. Freleng’s timing is seamless and Chiniquy is the master of performance.\n\n–Meatless Flyday (Mike Maltese) involves a jolly spider willing to eat a fly. That’s pretty much it, it’s a pretty meh cartoon, and a desperate attempt to bring back a NPC with Avery’s laugh.\n\n–Slightly Daffy is the remake of 1939’s Scalp Trouble by Clampett. There was no such need to bring it back, since 1939 was a very underwhelming time for WB to begin with. Trite content.\n\nEven though McKimson and Scribner are the only animators left from Avery’s final unit after Ross’ departure, Clampett’s staff never ceases to maintain its solidity, thanks to fresher entries like Manny Gould and former Disney animator Basil Davidovich, or momentary wingmen like Tom McKimson, Phil Monroe (his experience with Clampett has been very short, corrected by McKimson at parts) and Gil Turner (often corrected by McKimp) from Freleng’s unit. Clampett’s 1944 has been good overall, but the strength of his staff kinda makes up for some poor writing at times, which does indeed happen with Lou Lilly’s scripts.\n\n–Tick Tock Tuckered (Warren Foster) is the remake of his own 1937’s Porky’s Badtime Story, his debut as a supervisor. Unlike Slightly Daffy, a few changes occurred, such as Daffy taking Gabby’s place, which is a huge improvement, the better animation (the boss looks so much angrier here than in the original, thanks to McKimson), Daffy shooting at the moon out of sheer Scribneresque frustration and a more fitting ending for edgelord Clampett’s standards. Although, the way that clip from Freleng’s Notes to You is used is kinda jarring.\n\n–THE OLD GREY HARE (Mike Sasanoff) features a simple plot for a great cartoon, with severely aged Elmer attempting to catch old Bugs once and for all. It’s got Clampett’s trademark timing bounces, ranging from calm scenes like McKimson’s melodrama and rapid-fire gags like the baby chase and the final explosive gag. This is to be considered a classic. Scribner is just perfect at dealing with wrinkled expressions and McKimson is always charged with melodrama.\n\n–Buckaroo Bugs (Lou Lilly) is thoroughly carried by Clampett’s team, otherwise its lack of plot would stand out much easier. Red Hot Ryder may be a milder and mustache-less version of Yosemite Sam, but he’s never been a challenge for Bugs, whose superiority is never questioned throughout this cartoon. It’s a good one with some reservations, since Lilly’s plot is non-existent.\n\n–Birdy and the Beast (Warren Foster) is the second appearance of Tweety. Rather solid entry, not among my personal favorite. First time for Tweety’s BOOM catchphrase.\n\n–Russian Rhapsody (Lou Lilly)… okay, I suppose gremlins from the Kremlin is a cool pun and are rather entertaining, mostly thanks to Clampett’s animators, and overall, they had a lot of fun mocking and hurting Hitler, which is also okay. I’m definitely okay with the Lew Lehr gag comeback after three years, but there’s barely no plot. On top of that, the unsanitary Italian boot is racist imagery, regardless of its historical context, almost on the same level as anti-Japan propaganda.\n\n–Hare Ribbin’ (Lou Lilly) features a Russian Willoughby as Bugs’ antagonist. It quite feels like Avery’s The Heckling Hare, from the beginning to Bugs and the dog going underwater… for the rest of the entire cartoon, which Avery never came up with. Not only Lilly defies storytelling, but also physics, since non-aquatic mammals can apparently breathe underwater. Please don’t give me “it’s a cartoon” excuses, because it’s possible to a certain degree, even in a bloody cartoon. Lilly is such a questionable writer, totally unable to create a plot, yet once again he’s saved by Clampett’s animators. I don’t even mind the two controversial endings, involving edgelord suicide jokes, since my issue with this is Lou Lilly. Period. Either way, you can’t miss with a staff like Clampett’s, it’s a decent short with a massive flaw.\n\n-Yes, despite all of this, I can hardly find Clampett’s worst of the year, since his cartoons are decent at the very least. In fact, Lilly manages to be even worse than this.\n\nFor some reason, Jones’ 1944 isn’t as compelling as the past two years. His output may not be as troublesome as his early ’40s, but feels like his growth stopped abruptly. His staff features some changes, as Dick Thompson joins Harris (Thompson was his former assistant), Washam, Cannon and Vaughan, while DeLara leaves at some point. It’s also possible former Disney animators Shamus Culhane and Ray Patin joined his unit.\n\n–Tom Turk and Daffy (Maltese and Pierce) isn’t my favorite Daffy-Porky short, but it’s still quite solid. One of the first Jones entries written by the Wackiki Wabbit duo.\n\n–Lost and Foundling (Tedd Pierce) is a pretty decent Sniffles cartoon, which is the best compliment I can give. Maybe a slight step back over Maltese’s The Unbearable Bear, which was better structured and had more gags than this one.\n\n–Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears (Tedd Pierce) introduces the three bears, who are certainly solid characters, but their screen time is so copious it makes the action too hasty and inaccurate. This makes Jones’ only Bugs Bunny cartoon of 1944 kinda abrupt and unimpressive, even though the casual way Junyer gives Bugs ketchup is very funny (albeit with a weird switch between Vaughan and DeLara). The parody is decent enough, the final segment is very weak, with a pretty strange door gag (possibly animated by Culhane) and overall, I cannot view this as a quintessential Bugs Bunny cartoon, as it’s too flawed.\n\n–From Hand to Mouse (Mike Maltese) is okay, yet a bit too repetitive. Formulas would eventually become one of Jones’ biggest fortunes, but this would not be the case.\n\n-Of course he, too, had to try a documentary by himself. The Weakly Reporter (Mike Maltese) isn’t as boring as the past attempts, but I still don’t positively care for this format.\n\n–Angel Puss (Lou Lilly) is amazing. It’s got anything you WOULDN’T want in a cartoon: lack of story, racism, unnecessary cruelty, NPCs. I’d rather suggest a wall of text of Lilly saying “I’m sorry” as the ending theme, because this cartoon is fucking garbage and Lilly’s gaps stand out too easily without Clampett and his animators. How sick can you be if you want to drown your own fucking cat???\n\nTash’s 1944 has been definitely a positive one. His humor is oddly overlooked, as he actually proposes more mature… innuendos at times, in a more subtle way than Clampett would usually do. Davis, Dalton, Ellis and former TerryToons animator George Cannata are part of his staff, while it’s still unknown what happened to Ray Patin.\n\n–I Got Plenty of Mutton (Melvin Millar) is a decent short, despite the first section being a bit too long. I do like how Tash doesn’t hesitate to hint at more mature gags, like the billy goat’s horny reaction at the wolf’s disguise. The ending is LGBTQ+ friendly before LGBTQ+ friendliness, quite progressive.\n\n-Even though a henhouse isn’t normally a great setting for cartoons (1941’s Golden Eggs was a boring short, for example), The Swooner Crooner (Warren Foster) makes an exception. Tash somehow manages to make egg production interesting, through a solid production line and Powerhouse, and hens’ infatuation, which could’ve killed a short if done wrong, is treated in a hilarious way, with Frankie literally melting them down with his voice. Once again, where would Tash insert pseudo-sexual gags? During the challenge between Crosby and Frankie, with hens literally squirting eggs. Their singing works on Porky, too. Very good entry.\n\n–The Stupid Cupid (Warren Foster) is about Elmer wearing a diaper who bothers everyone by flinging Cupid arrows. This hysterical scenery gives fairly funny moments, like Dalton’s evil-looking bird or Daffy basically acting like Pepé le Pew towards an unfortunate hen. Okay, this sounds wrong nowadays, since sexual assault isn’t funny in the slightest, but to Daffy’s credit, he was actually manipulated by Cupid and the cartoon itself actually puts him in a bad light once the rooster appears, as Daffy is rightfully in the wrong. That said, it’s a pretty great cartoon, featuring one of Elmer’s most diabolically humorous role and such priceless expressions by the likes of Davis or Dalton.\n\n–PLANE DAFFY (Warren Foster) is one of Tash’s strongest cartoons: well-developed plot, mature content (unique depiction of WWII scenery), great animation, Daffy at his best and effective gags. The door scene from Freleng’s The Trial of Mr. Wolf reappears, but done a lot better with a more realistic and far less linear perspective, as Daffy has to run down to reach the trapdoor in order to escape. Curiously enough, Dalton animated both scenes. As for the rest, clever use of the pigeons being aroused by a waving picture of Hata Mari “shaking her hips” and not even Daffy’s immunity to women can prevent him from appreciating a nice leg. Fair enough. Tash also borrows Clampett’s suicide gag near the end, but unlike the latter, he doesn’t use it just because. Gem.\n\n–Brother Brat (Melvin Millar) isn’t as compelling as The Swooner Crooner, as that fucking kid sucks in all the comedy and Porky is way too passive to stand up against him. Cannata’s Porky looks very TerryToonesque, with those massive eyes… not too fond of his style, whereas Dalton draws a solid, snobbish alpha woman. Two things I enjoy, Winston Churchill’s cameo and the satisfying ending. However, I’m never a massive fan of the annoying child trope.\n\n–Booby Hatched (Warren Foster) is the weakest Tash cartoon of the year. Despite a quite promising beginning, the rest of the short is very uninteresting and once mama duck starts screaming ‘ROBESPIERRE’ over and over, it goes downhill further. That sounds so fucking obnoxious. I don’t like the second act, either, since it’s a bit light on jokes, which don’t always land, and the ending is incomplete and not very satisfying. Without a doubt Tash’s low point in a still good year.\n\n1945\n\nJanuary, 6th: Odor-able Kitty (Jones) = first appearance of PEPÉ LE PEW.\n\nFebruary, 10th: The Unruly Hare = one of the two Bugs Bunny cartoons directed by Frank Tashlin.\n\nMarch, 24th: Life with Feathers (Freleng) = first appearance of SYLVESTER, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nMay, 5th: Hare Trigger (Freleng) = first MM cartoon with the abridged version of the opening theme, first appearance of YOSEMITE SAM, first pairing of Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam, first Bugs Bunny cartoon to use Art Davis’ shield intro.\n\nJune, 9th: A Gruesome Twosome = last Tweety cartoon directed by Bob Clampett, last appearance of Tweety without feathers.\n\nJune, 30th: Tale of Two Mice (Tashlin) = first LT cartoon with the abridged version of the opening theme.\n\nJuly, 28th: Wagon Heels (Clampett) = color remake of Injun Trouble (1938).\n\nSeptember, 15th: The Bashful Buzzard (Clampett) = sequel of 1942’s Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid.\n\nOctober, 20th: Peck Up Your Troubles (Freleng) = first appearance of Hector, features a special 1941-45 MM ending theme.\n\nNovember, 10th: Hare Tonic (Jones) = features Ken Harris’ Bugs Bunny drum outro.\n\nDecember, 1st: Nasty Quacks = last Daffy Duck cartoon directed by Frank Tashlin.\n\n1945 is a strange year, a good one yet a lot shorter than the previous. Only 18 short films were released. WWII officially ended, but hasn’t really stopped being a topic of a few cartoons, as addressed in Draftee Daffy and Nasty Quacks. It’s the last full year for Tashlin as a director.\n\nFreleng supervised 5 shorts out of 18, two of which introduce the very first important characters ever created by the veteran, Sylvester the often misused, underrated character, and Yosemite Sam as a new foe for Bugs, more short-tempered and aggressive than Elmer. Not his most memorable year, with Dick Bickenbach leaving his unit after Ain’t That Ducky to join Tashlin. Nevertheless, Chiniquy, Perez, Ross, Champin and Bradbury create a pretty strong team.\n\n–Herr Meets Hare (Mike Maltese) is mostly known for Gerry Chiniquy’s Wagnerian scene, which I think it’s a better What’s Opera Doc than the real What’s Opera Doc, but we’ll get to it. Also the first cartoon to feature the ‘left turn to Albuquerque’ running gag.\n\n–HARE TRIGGER (Mike Maltese) is a great debut for Yosemite Sam, one of my favorite LT characters for being likably short-tempered and more evil than Elmer, who wasn’t really considered an actual threat by Freleng himself, due to his more laid-back attitude. Without a doubt Freleng’s best short of the year, it’s got the classic Maltesesque setup, the amazing draw a gun scene by Virgil Ross (gotta love the piano going off-key every time Sam fails his drawing) and the Bugs on Sam’s head by Chiniquy, not to mention the 4th wall break in the end.\n\n–Ain’t That Ducky (Mike Maltese) isn’t really among my favorite Daffy Duck material, since that duckling is a pain in the ass and the hunter is a pretty generic enemy. All in all, decent cartoon with a neat 4th wall break.\n\n–Peck Up Your Troubles (Mike Maltese) features the same problems as Ain’t That Ducky: great character (Sylvester) chasing a generic woodpecker. Once again, it’s got its moments like Sylvester defying gravity because anything is possible in a cartoon, but I feel it’s kinda predictable in its decency.\n\n–Life with Feathers (Tedd Pierce), a.k.a. Sylvester’s debut, is by no means a bad cartoon, but I consider it sort of a mixed bag. My complaint doesn’t stand upon WHY the lovebird wants Sylvester to eat him, but rather upon WHY his wife is so mean-spirited towards him. It’s never explained why the lovebird lives in such a toxic relationship, we never know whether he’s in the wrong or not. However, what we do know is that his spouse is an abusive bitch, as the ending is way too mean-spirited and ruins a mostly okay cartoon. As for Sylvester, he’s definitely got a personality unlike the previous feline NPCs, as he even suspects the suicidal bird might be poisoned, which dissuades him from eating it. I wish this short were better than this.\n\nOn the other hand, Clampett released only 4 shorts out of 18, which feel like a solider output compared to Freleng’s 1945. His unit is tremendous, with the likes of McKimson, Scribner, Gould, Davidovich and later on Bill Melendez, Scribner’s former assistant being the core of his cartoons. Even after Turner and Davidovich’s departures (the latter would join Jones’ unit), his animation staff maintains its strength, which I suppose it’s always been Clampett’s main quality in WB.\n\n–DRAFTEE DAFFY (Lou Lilly) may not be perfect, but it’s extremely enjoyable from start to finish. Of course the story isn’t the most stable, but the rest is great so I can’t complain too much. Clampett’s rapid-fire gags and his animation staff are just too good, from Gould’s over-the-top reactions to McKimson’s melodrama. Lilly ends his unmemorable career at WB on a rather positive note.\n\n–A Gruesome Twosome (Warren Foster) is the third and last appearance of pink Tweety before Freleng’s “restyling”. Nothing much to say, it’s quite solid and features one of the many callbacks to Jimmy Durante. Not the most outstanding stuff, though.\n\n-Let’s put it this way, trying to imitate the Italian accent has always been quite cringy, and Beaky’s mother is no exception. That said, The Bashful Buzzard (Mike Sasanoff) is a welcome sequel of 1942’s Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid, and dare to say, it’s also a better cartoon. I do like Beaky, he’s an entertaining character, and the fact he’s so inefficient compared to his siblings makes him even more likeable. While the others catch lambs, a dog, a cow and an entire circus (no Dumbo, though), he doesn’t even get to catch a tiny bee. So, it’s a good one.\n\n–Wagon Heels (Warren Foster) is the remake of his own 1938’s Injun Trouble, and while there are actually some differences from the original, such as Scribner’s shrinking weeping bear and Gould’s last scene, I don’t really consider this one that necessary. Again, nothing too bad, but it remains a recycled short.\n\nJones’ 5 shorts can be considered a step up over a not so exciting 1944, two of which are far better Bugs Bunny shorts than the sole Bugs Bunny and the Three Bears. Just like Freleng, he creates a new character, Pepé le Pew, who would eventually get his formulaic plot in a couple of years. His main quality is being a horny skunk with a French accent, that’s pretty much it. Script-wise, he’s supported by the Wackiki duo, also separately, and at some point Basil Davidovich leaves Clampett’s unit to join Jones’ (which already has Harris, Washam, Cannon, Vaughan and Thompson in it, a quite strong staff).\n\n–Odor-able Kitty (Maltese and Pierce) features Pepé’s debut, who has a crush on a male cat painted as a polecat. Once again, pretty progressive for its time, even though we’re not sure if it was deliberate. However, unlike the following entries, the story isn’t set in France and Pepé’s French accent is only a gimmick to pick up, nothing else. In fact, he commits adultery since he already got wife and kids. All things considered, it’s a solid cartoon which demonstrates us Pepé is horny regardless of the gender of his crush. His classic sigma hopping compared to the cat’s desperate escape would become a running trope in his series.\n\n–Trap Happy Porky (Tedd Pierce), the one with the intoxicated cats singing. Even though by now Porky is way too mild compared to Bugs and Daffy, the ending is what makes this cartoon, not only thanks to resigned Porky joining the inebriated choir, but also thanks to Ken Harris providing a quite impressive ending, as he never repeats a frame while animating the cats’ performance. Yes, Cannon manages to do it in his own section, as well, but Harris’ looks cleaner and less blobby altogether.\n\n–Hare Conditioned (Tedd Pierce) is pretty good, quite close to become a Jones classic. It’s got Cannon’s Gilder Sneeze, the elevator segment and the highlight, the department scene by Basil Davidovich. Jones’ animation staff has finally achieved his own identity, by now you can easily tell whether it’s a Jones cartoon or not. (I might remake the animation breakdown in the future…)\n\n–HARE TONIC (Tedd Pierce) is his second and last Bugs Bunny entry of the year, which features a classic Bugs-Elmer pairing, actually been missing since 1941’s Elmer’s Pet Rabbit. As a matter of fact, the beginning kinda resembles said short, only made 1000x better with Bugs closing Elmer in his own basket. The story is also superior, with the classic Bugs fooling his foe trope, in this case Elmer, whose gullibility could’ve easily become an issue if portrayed in a contrived way. Thankfully it wasn’t, as this short is quite strong with some funny bits, like the water bill, Washam’s maniacal expression on Bugs inside Elmer’s clothes or Cannon’s absurd final section. Very enjoyable altogether, as Jones started building his own career around Bugs Bunny’s character and the next years would only confirm his accomplishments.\n\n-On the other hand, Fresh Airedale (Mike Maltese) isn’t a proud attempt and the fact it was created by the Jones-Maltese duo doesn’t bring me to like this one not one bit. I seem to understand what they wanted to accomplish in the first place, by suggesting an intentionally mean-spirited plot around Shep acting like a callous douchedog and the cat being the blameless victim. First of all, NONE of these characters is likeable, since Shep’s master is an abusive bitch, Shep ALWAYS gets away with his evildoing, in fact he even gets fucking rewarded without any credit and the cat is ALWAYS punished for fucking nothing. On a more positive note, animation is great because Jones’ staff has amazing people in it, but that’s about it. This is one of the worst entries of the successful Duo.\n\nTashlin supervises 4 shorts out of 18 in his last full year at WB, even though his very last cartoon, Hare Remover, would only be released in 1946. Compared to the other directors, his year isn’t the most memorable, but still mostl"
