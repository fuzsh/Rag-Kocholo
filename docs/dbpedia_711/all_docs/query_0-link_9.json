Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is often called the first, but there were several precedents in cut-out and stop-motion animation. The earliest known surviving animated feature is Germany’s cut-out The Adventures of Prince Achmed in 1926. By a happy alphabetical accident, it is the first entry in this book. There were also several lost films from Argentina which were probably feature length, starting with El Apostol (1917) by Quirino Cristiani. From 1937 until the 1990s, animated features around the world were dominated by Disney. Of course, other films and other kinds of film were made in this time. Some were critically acclaimed, or were local hits, or gained loyal fan followings. Some were truly alternative visions, such as Jirí Trnka’s balletic stop-motion A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1959); Ralph Bakshi’s coarsely drawn Fritz the Cat (1972); and Katsuhiro Otomo’s future epic Akira (1988). But these landmarks were separated by language, generations and cultural expectations. When it came to feature animation, Disney was the world’s denominator.\n\nThe Mouse Between 1937 and 1942, Disney released five enduring classics of feature animation: Snow White (1937), Pinocchio, Fantasia (both 1940), Dumbo (1941) and Bambi (1942). Yes, these films can be cute and mawkish, most notoriously in the characters’ cartoon-saucer eyes. At their best, though, they use their cuteness as a starting point in works of cinema bravado, thematic power and spiritual depth. Following Bambi, Disney had several years of commercial decline, caused by the war and Walt’s over-ambition. The studio returned to prominence with 1950’s Cinderella, but Walt himself was less involved as he moved into live-action films, TV, theme parks and even town planning. He died in 1966, while his studio was in production of what would be one of its most enduringly popular animated films, The Jungle Book. The Disney animated films over the next twenty years are often only mentioned in bad-old-days contexts. Many young animators were hired by the studio in this time; many bailed or were dismissed. The drop-outs included some of the biggest future names in animation: John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Henry Selick, Tim Burton and Don Bluth. Contrary to some accounts, though, these films were still enjoyed by children. The first Disney I saw myself, aged five, was 1977’s The Rescuers. In 1982, Disney was subject to a boardroom coup, leading to a new Disney regime led by Paramount’s Michael Eisner. He tasked Jeffrey Katzenberg, also from Paramount, with overseeing the animation department. At first indifferent to the medium, Katzenberg became fascinated by it and began exerting a creative influence of his own. The story of this time is well told in the 2009 documentary feature, Waking Sleeping Beauty. The Eisner regime saw an upswing in Disney’s prestige through the successes of The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992) and The Lion King (1994). Was this ‘gold standard’ on 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 1\n\n1\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\na level with Snow White or Bambi? Not to an adult sensibility, but then Disney also released The Nightmare before Christmas (1993), a Gothic stop-motion film different enough to appeal to people who disliked the new Disney style. Two years later, the studio released another ‘unDisney’ film by an outside party. It was Toy Story, the first computer-animated feature.\n\nRises and Falls Made by the young Pixar studio, Toy Story was visually kinetic, with a buddy-film dynamic, and very funny. It was also a better Disney heir than The Prince of Egypt (1998), a Bible epic from the rival DreamWorks studio. DreamWorks was co-founded by Katzenberg, whose Disney career had ended acrimoniously. The establishment of DreamWorks confirmed there were now several animated games in town. Feature animation was no longer just a fight for Walt’s legacy. In fact, it was as much a fight for the legacy of The Simpsons. The animated TV sitcom débuted in 1989, and quickly changed expectations of what animation could offer in terms of jokes for adults. Coincidentally or not, The Simpsons’ knowing, audience-flattering tone was mirrored in features as early as Disney’s Aladdin, then fed into the first batch of computer-animated films: Toy Story, DreamWorks’ Antz (1998) and, most successfully, Shrek (2001). By the 2000s, Disney’s animation was declining, unable to compete with Pixar, DreamWorks and other computer-animated studios. From 2002, Michael Eisner began shutting down Disney’s traditional animation units, even before the costly flop of Treasure Planet (2002). But as traditionally animated features faded at Hollywood, they were imported from overseas. France’s very unDisney Belleville Rendez-Vous (2003, aka The Triplets of Belleville) won critical attention; so did the Disney-distributed Spirited Away (2001), by Japan’s Hayao Miyazaki. Both were marginal at the Western box office, but they had cultural cachet in an increasingly glutted market. Eisner left Disney in 2005, having mothballed hand-drawn features and alienated the Pixar studio. However, his replacement Robert Iger secured a rapprochement, then bought Pixar out in a $7.4-billion deal. John Lasseter, the director of Toy Story, became Chief Creative Officer of both studios. One of his first moves was to revive Disney’s traditional animation, greenlighting The Princess and the Frog (2009). Yet Disney Animation still looked like a fading force. In 2010, I wrote an article in Sight & Sound in which I claimed, ‘perhaps the next few years will see the final, quiet death of Disney animation.’ I predicted the studio’s new CGI film, Tangled would be eclipsed by Pixar, as The Princess and the Frog had been in 2009. I also cited what Don Hahn, who’d produced Disney’s Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, had told me in the early 2000s: that if Disney stuck to fairy tales, ‘the animated form will wither and die’. ‘For all (Tangled’s) pleasures’, I wrote in Sight & Sound, ‘I think many of the young adult demographic who cheered (Pixar’s) Toy Story 3 wouldn’t be caught dead going to this pretty princess Disney; any more than Spielberg fans in the 1980s would have gone to The Fox and the Hound (1981).’ Instead, Tangled – which was Disney’s first ‘princess’ musical in CGI – was a global hit, surpassing the box-office of any of the studio’s cartoons since Lion King. Three years later, Lion King’s record was toppled by Disney’s phenomonally popular Frozen. Perhaps more importantly, Frozen also outgrossed Pixar’s Toy Story 3. 2\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 2\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nDisney Animation had survived another downturn, and some of its 2010s films would outperform Pixar’s critically and commercially. Today, Pixar is still identified as the CG pioneer, while Disney highlights its far older heritage in drawn animation. From 2007, Disney Animation’s production logo incorporated a whistling Mickey Mouse, taken from the studio’s 1928 landmark, Steamboat Willie. But by then, most Disney Animation features were in CGI, and in the 2010s, ‘most’ became ‘all’. As of writing, it’s been a decade since Disney’s last ‘traditional’ cartoon feature, a 2011 revival of Winnie the Pooh. The unit which had made it and Princess and the Frog shut in 2013. Some traditional animation was used in 2018’s Mary Poppins Returns, but its animators were obliged to use the Pasadena studio of Ken Duncan, a former Disney artist. Drawn animation was once Disney’s whole identity. Now it wasn’t even a part of the studio. Inevitably, Pixar and Disney Animation felt less different; after all, their CG films looked similar. Even their stories started to cross, as discussed in the entry on Pixar’s Coco. The same entry also references the fall of John Lasseter, following reports of his personal conduct. From 2018, his former role was split between Pete Docter, director of Pixar hits including Inside Out (2015), and Jennifer Lee, one of the directors of Frozen. There were rises and falls elsewhere. In 2009, DreamWorks confidently announced it was planning to release five animated features ever two years. By January 2015, it was shutting one of its two main bases (PDI/ DreamWorks near San Francisco) and laying off 500 people. As of writing, the studio’s recent box-office has been far from the highs of the Shrek franchise. Jeffrey Katzenberg left DreamWorks Animation in 2016, when the company was acquired by NBCUniversal. At first, it was announced he would be replaced by Chris Meledandri, the CEO of another of Hollywood’s main CG animation studios, Illumination. Originally Illumination Entertainment, it debuted with the hit Despicable Me in 2010, followed by films that often outperformed their rivals. In 2017, Despicable Me 3 beat Pixar’s Coco and Cars 3, to say nothing of Warners’ The Lego Batman Movie, Blue Sky’s Ferdinand and DreamWorks’ Captain Underpants. In fact, Meledandri declined to helm DreamWorks as well as Illumination, which would have given him power comparable to Lasseter. As of writing, the President of DreamWorks Animation is Bonnie Arnold, who’d been a producer on Pixar’s first Toy Story; she also oversaw DreamWorks’ How To Train Your Dragon trilogy. Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks and Illumination account for the bulk of the most lucrative animated films this century. The other big CG player, Blue Sky, burst on the scene in 2002 with its prehistoric adventure Ice Age. It would release a dozen more features; its biggest box-office hit was the third Ice Age in 2009. It was closed in 2021 by Disney, which had acquired it two years earlier. Other CG companies kept afloat with less stellar box-office (mostly under $500 million worldwide), but with generally lower budgets. Sony Pictures Imageworks animated such CGI films as Arthur Christmas (2011, co-produced with Aardman); Hotel Transylvania (2012) and its sequels; and the acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse (2018), which won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. (The same unit had provided effects for live-action Spider-Man films, going back to Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man in 2002.) Spider Verse used playful ‘cartoony’ effects as emotional punctuation; they were just as evident in the studio’s 2021 animated comedy, The Mitchells vs. the Machines. 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 3\n\n3\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBoth Spider Verse and Mitchells were produced by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Lord also co-wrote Spider Verse). They had previously been the writer-directors of 2014’s well-received The Lego Movie. That film and its sequels were animated by Australia’s Animal Logic studio for Warner Brothers.\n\nOther formats, other countries In 1977, Bruno Edera’s book Full-Length Animated Feature Films surveyed the field as it seemed then. In Edera’s view, the stop-motion puppet film, exemplified by France’s Le Roman de Reynard (1937) and the Czech A Midsummer Night’s Dream (1959), had probably had its day. ‘None of the new (animated) film-makers will make much use of puppets’, Edera wrote, ‘and it remains to be seen what will happen to this particular branch of the medium.’ But stop-motion lasted. In 2005, Britain’s Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit won the Best Animated Feature Oscar, beating another British-animated stop-motion film, The Corpse Bride. The latter was co-directed by Tim Burton, whose Disney film Frankenweenie (2012) was also made in Britain. Both Burtons were animated at London’s 3 Mills Studios, which later hosted Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) and Isle of Dogs (2018). The latter came out the same year as Aardman’s plasticine Early Man, animated in Bristol. By then, stop-motion had also returned to America. The Laika studio in Portland, Oregon, launched a series of critically favoured films with the scary Coraline (2009). Meanwhile, the live-action writer and director Charlie Kaufman had his voice-play Anomalisa turned into stop-motion at Burbank. Released in 2015, Kaufman’s film wasn’t for kids; it dealt with middle-aged angst and had a (moderately) explicit sex scene. Anomalisa was low-budget (reportedly $8 million) but it flopped in cinemas, earning just $5.7 million. It highlighted the vast contrasts in 21st-century animation, between the Hollywood franchises and the experimenters trying to open up the medium. Other stop-motion features cost and earned more, but rarely broke $100 million at the box-office. Laika was hit by variable returns; its 2019 comedy Missing Link was a dangerously costly flop. In March 2021, the studio announced it was expanding into live-action. Many animated films from outside America were in a comparably precarious position in the world market. At least they were easier for Anglophone viewers to access than they had been in past decades. For example, in 2021 a British viewer could watch any of India’s Bombay Rose (2019), Hungary’s Ruben Brandt, Collector (2018) and Saudi Arabia’s Masameer: The Movie (2020) on Netflix. In America the distributor GKIDS was founded in 2008 and built its name promoting international films. These included Brazil’s Boy and the World (2013), the Swiss/French stop-motion My Life as a Courgette (2016), and the work of Ireland’s Cartoon Saloon, starting with 2009’s The Secret of Kells. These were all nominated for the Best Animated Oscar, though none of them won. Some earned almost nothing in cinemas – the superb Boy and the World reportedly earned under $300,000 worldwide – but they may have paid off on other platforms. The nominations did give these films a few moments of global presence, beside the Hollywood CG blockbusters. An Oscar voting rule change in 2017, meaning that nominees could be voted on by all Academy members, not just by a specialist few, caused animation fans to worry that non-Hollywood cartoons would be excluded. Two years earlier, the Cartoon Brew website had quoted an anonymous member of the Academy. He expressed outrage that The Lego Movie wasn’t nominated for the Best Animated Feature, while two ‘smaller’ films were. 4\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 4\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\n‘Those two freakin’ Chinese f--- things that nobody ever saw… Most people didn’t even know what they were!’ the Academy member declared. He was referring to Japan’s The Tale of the Princess Kaguya (2013) and Ireland’s Song of the Sea (2014). Nonetheless, international films have continued to be nominated by Academy voters since the rule change. As of writing, the highest-grossing non-American animated feature is China’s Ne Zha (2019). This CG action-fantasy made over $700 million in 2019, mostly in China alone. (This book has an entry on Ne Zha’s hand-drawn predecessor, Nezha Conquers the Dragon King, 1979.) Time will tell if this more than a fluke. As of writing, the only country producing a volume of animated features to rival America is Japan. While the future of Studio Ghibli, which had made Spirited Away, looks uncertain as of writing, other Japanese creators were stepping up. In 2016, Makoto Shinkai’s bodyswap fantasy Your Name threatened the record of Spirited Away, which was then Japan’s most successful film. The record was finally broken in 2020 by Demon Slayer: Infinity Train, a TV cartoon spinoff. These commercial triumphs were set against depressingly unchanging stories of abysmal pay for many Japanese animators. A New York Times headline in February 2021 was typical: ‘Anime is booming. So why are animators living in poverty?’ The studio Kyoto Animation, whose work included the feature A Silent Voice (2016), was a shining exception. Its employment ethos was much-praised; for instance, its artists were salaried rather than being paid by the drawing, as was the norm in anime. In April 2019, Kyoto Animation was attacked by a lone arsonist. Thirty-six people died in the fire. Yet since then, the studio has rallied and is making animation again.\n\nDefining issues and Avatar’s children As of writing, the top-grossing animated film worldwide is Disney’s 2019 remake of The Lion King. It was made in ‘photo-real’ CG animation, if talking and singing animals can be photo-real. The lead animation/VFX house was the British-headquartered Motion Picture Company (MPC). However, the remake was officially assigned to Disney’s ‘live-action’ division, and it wasn’t entered for the Best Animated Feature Oscar. This was part of a bid by Disney to redefine animation. Sean Bailey, president of Disney’s Motion Picture Production, claimed the new Lion King was ‘a new form of film-making. Historical definitions don’t work.’ The remake’s director Jon Favreau told the Slashfilm website that it was misleading to call the film animated, ‘as far as what the expectations might be’. For Favreau, these expectations were the key. He suggested that if Lion King wasn’t classed as animation, it would cause audiences ‘to be present and mindful and pay attention because you’re trying to figure out what you’re looking at.’ Favreau seemed to want to cast his audience back to the innocence of the generation who saw the first Jurassic Park (1993), which replaced stop-motion monsters with CGI ones. Or perhaps Favreau was thinking of the viewers who saw the early stop-motion creatures in The Lost World (1925) and King Kong (1933). But those films are now accepted as part of animation history; and unlike them, the Lion King remake has only one live-action shot in its entire running time. (It’s the first shot, of a sunrise in Africa.) At Cartoon Brew, editor Amid Amidi pointed out that Disney had recently remade several of its cartoons in live-action (for 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 5\n\n5\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nexample, 2017’s Beauty and Beast), and presumably didn’t want to complicate its marketing categories. As such, Disney’s sophistry may be confined to Lion King and its sequels, unless the studio tries for a photo-real Bambi or Zootropolis. Back in 2009, James Cameron had released Avatar. Like Favreau, he refused to class it as animation. As of writing, there have been many heavily virtual blockbusters since then, but few as virtual as Avatar. Aside from the new Lion King, the main two were Gravity (2013) and Disney’s 2016 remake of The Jungle Book, the latter by Favreau. Like Avatar, both films put real actors into virtual spaces. You can see them as digital descendants of Walt Disney’s 1923 short Alice’s Wonderland, which placed a girl in a drawn landscape. Other films used Avatar’s second big trick, transforming actors through CG animation techniques. (Of course, Avatar wasn’t the first to do it; a major precedent was set by The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in 2002, which foregrounded the slithering character of Gollum, played by Andy Serkis.) By 2019, Alita: Battle Angel was turning Rosa Salazar into a huge-eyed android, while Captain Marvel de-aged Samuel L. Jackson by 25 years. Many viewers were less convinced by the rejuvenated stars in another 2019 film, Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, who had to sustain far more screen time. Uncanny Valley problems still endure – one of Alita’s fascinations is how it embraces that uncanny, with a naïve, huge-eyed, mannequin-gaited heroine, who may be based on a manga character but recalls nothing so much as Disney’s Pinocchio.\n\nThe Future In the 2010 edition of this book, I wrote optimistically, ‘The animated feature has rarely been as celebrated, or enjoyed such a high profile, as it does today. There’s a high awareness among cinemagoers that it’s not a genre but a diverse medium; that it doesn’t always come from Disney, Pixar or America; and that it’s not necessarily aimed at children or family audiences.’ However, I also acknowledged that animation may have been stunted by the world’s most powerful studios, whether Disney or Ghibli. The animated feature has had a long succession of counterculture icons. Yellow Submarine, Richard Williams, Ralph Bakshi, Jan Svankmajer, Ghibli, Cartoon Saloon and even The Lego Movie have all been framed as alternatives to the stultifying cartoon establishment of the day. In 2020, for example, the New Yorker ran a long article, ‘Cartoon Saloon and the New Golden Age of Animation’. But what keeps the field alive is a continuing series of alternatives, not a lone vision. In the first edition, I cited the ‘new pluralism’ of such 2000s films as the British/French The Illusionist, France’s Persepolis, Japan’s Spirited Away, Israel’s Waltz with Bashir and Ireland’s The Secret of Kells. Eleven years on, the situation seems unchanged, neither better nor worse. A few studios still dominate the field commercially, yet the variety remains. For the list above, one could substitute France’s The Red Turtle, Japan’s Your Name, Brazil’s Boy and the World, Poland’s Loving Vincent and Ireland’s Wolfwalkers. All were made in the 2010s. As of writing, there’s a surge of international animated films depicting real wars and oppressive regimes, following Persepolis (2007) and Waltz With Bashir (2008). There are more details in the entry on Cartoon Saloon’s The Breadwinner (2017). A drama set in Afghanistan, this film was aimed at a wide audience, though it earned very little in cinemas. The chances of a Hollywood CG animation tackling a similar subject seems slim. 6\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 6\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAnother development does not relate to cartoon features directly, but rather to series for television and streaming. Since The Simpsons, there’s been a steady evolution in Anglophone ‘adult’ animation series. The Simpsons’ descendants are still comedies, but now they can be tragicomedies or comedy-dramas, sometimes with longform storylines. BoJack Horseman (2014-20) felt closer to Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa than to Springfield. Perhaps this TV adult animation boom can never be replicated in cinemas, but it’s a mirror to an alternate world. Animation fans have asked for decades if an ‘adult’ animated feature could be commercially mainstream – a film not just enjoyed by adults, but aimed primarily at them, perhaps excluding children altogether. Such films have always been made, from Fritz the Cat to Anomalisa, but nearly always on the margins. Today, of course, there’s a bigger concern: the marginalising of adult live-action films in a cinema of fantasy blockbusters, using techniques that originated in animation. Japanese animation is often cited as containing adult themes. However, most anime films are commercially marginal even in Japan. True, there are domestic ‘blockbusters’, such as Princess Mononoke (1997) and Your Name, and they do play differently from Hollywood’s CG mainstream. They’re less reliant on jokes, and have fewer moral binaries. Hollywood animation seems to be learning from them – see the entry on Moana. However, even Princess Mononoke and Your Name use young protagonists and fledgling romances, as do most anime. It’s rare to find an anime protagonist over twenty, let alone twenty-five. Your Name had wistful interludes, and a story that resonated with Japanese trauma, but it’s still an anime equivalent of Back to the Future (1985). It’s far from the middle-aged concerns of Anomalisa, The Illusionist (2010), The Congress (2013) or Rocks in My Pockets (2014). The chances of that kind of animation reaching the mainstream seem remote; but it’s likely such films will continue to be made, and still find followings. In this new edition of 100 Animated Feature Films, there are slightly fewer American titles and more international films. Many of the latter are from Japan, but there are entries from China, Hong Kong, Czechoslovakia, Brazil, Britain, Ireland, France, Latvia, Russia, Italy, Israel, Hungary and Germany. Thirty-five entries are new, while several of the others have been updated or amended. Thirty-five entries from the first edition had to be retired. The 2010 book included entries on Avatar and 1933’s King Kong to make a point about how the definitions of ‘animated’ film could be extended. (King Kong may seldom be called an animated feature, but it was the first feature with an animated star.) This point felt like an indulgent stretch this time around, though I was tempted to include Scorsese’s The Irishman. Other creators and studios have matured. The 2010 edition included The Secret of Kells, Cartoon Saloon’s debut feature. This new book has entries on the burgeoning studio’s three later films to date. In 2010, I included Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence (2004), which I felt was much underrated, rather than the first film. However, the original’s cultural presence has grown in the interim, as witnessed by the controversial Hollywood remake in 2017. For that reason, a switch felt mandatory this time. I’ve added in some other older films that I reluctantly omitted from the first edition but still seemed to deserve a place in 2021. These include Satoshi Kon’s Perfect Blue (1997), Disney’s The Little Mermaid (1988), Hayao Miyazaki’s Nausicaa (1984) and Lev Atamanov’s The Snow Queen (1957). In the first edition, I wrote: ‘The selection is shaped by my own tastes, as the entries make clear, but I hope it is not wholly capricious.’ That still holds true now. 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 7\n\n7\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed Germany, 1926 – 66 minutes Lotte Reiniger [Cut-out silhouettes] DIRECTOR/ANIMATION\n\nLotte Reiniger SCORE Wolfgang Zeller\n\nThe making of the world’s oldest surviving animated feature was seen at first hand by a boy called Louis Hagen. (As an adult, he would flee to England as a Jewish refugee, become a decorated glider pilot and write a bestselling war memoir, Arnhem Lift). Hagen could hardly not have seen the production of The Adventures of Prince Achmed. It was made at his German family villa, by his beautiful art teacher, Lotte Reiniger. Hagen’s father, who shared his name, was a bohemian banker who chose to support Reiniger, an artist trained in theatre and film. Reiniger had studied under Max Reinhardt and Paul Wegener, but found herself drawn to silhouettes, shadow plays and animation. The senior Hagen proposed that Reiniger should animate a feature, financed by himself (money had little worth during German hyperinflation) and made in an attic studio over the garage of his Potsdam villa. Here Reiniger animated her characters, which appear on screen as black cut-out silhouettes, while her husband Carl Koch operated the camera. (Koch later worked with Renoir on La Grande Illusion, 1937, and La Règle du jeu, 1939.) Different layers of animation were shot on vertically stacked glass sheets, an ancestor of the multiplane camera. Berthold Bartosch, who would later make a celebrated French political animation, L’Idée (The Idea, 1932), handled the special effects involving wax, sand and soap. His partner on Achmed was Walter Ruttmann, the future director of Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (1927). Walter Turck arranged the brightly tinted, print-like backgrounds, in a film taking its hero from Arabian minarets to Chinese mountains. The junior Hagen remembered that when his villa’s lunch-bell rang, We heard all kinds of moans and groans, as if they had been in a torture chamber … . The studio wasn’t very high and all the animation work had to be done at floor level, so they worked on their knees. You can imagine, if you spend hours crawling, it’s bound to be painful when you get up.\n\nIn Achmed’s story, a composite of Arabian Nights tales, the Prince contends with sorcerers, spirits and monsters, and eventually teams up with Aladdin (who in this version loves Achmed’s sister). Ruttmann complained about the fantastical material – ‘What has this got to do with 1923?’ he asked – but the film was timely. Achmed’s production overlapped with Hollywood’s The Thief of Bagdad (1924), starring Douglas Fairbanks, and anticipated such cartoon-feature landmarks as The Thief and the Cobbler* and Disney’s Aladdin*. Achmed, like all Reiniger’s silhouette animation, is tactile à la stop-motion. There’s a physicality to the opaque figures’ filigreed outlines, their frilly dresses, unkempt beards and jointed limbs, which the viewer can imagine manipulating. There’s also a palpable electricity between the characters. An evil wizard grasps the hand of a princess; the taboo in this touching feels greater played out by silhouettes. Later the heroic Achmed woos a 8\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 8\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\ncowering girl, their motions of longing and repulsion framed in a grove with seashell curves. The eroticism is plain, as it is when Achmed finds a bawdy bevy of man-hunting maidens (snaffling a last kiss from them as he flees) or steals the wings from a faunlike fairy bathing nude (the same girl he woos later). Achmed never subverts the fairytale convention of princesses as prizes for heroes, but nor does the film hide its sexual tensions. The BFI DVD of Achmed also includes a striking extract from Reiniger’s 1935 short, Galathea, in which a woman statue ferociously rejects her Pygmalion. Within Reiniger’s innately magical animation, a capering simian sorceress commands the elements like Mickey Mouse in Fantasia*. The rival wizard creates a flying horse from primal liquid shapes. The horse bears Achmed helpless into the starry heavens in a thrilling 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 9\n\nbut scary scene, while the heroine’s bird nature foreshadows the oeuvre of Hayao Miyazaki. The villain folds origami-style into a bat; a tree unfolds into a man-eating monster; and a mountain vomits up enough creepy crawlies to populate Skull Island. Another BFI DVD, Lotte Reiniger – The Fairy Tale Films, focuses on the children’s shorts which Reiniger made in England. Two of them, Aladdin and the Magic Lamp and The Magic Horse (both 1954), combine Achmed footage with new animation. Far stranger is Reiniger’s 1928 The Death Feigning Chinaman, which is also included on the fairytale DVD. Originally planned as an episode of Achmed itself, the short features a comedy corpse, gallows humour and a gay theme. Reiniger explained that she wanted two men to kiss, ‘so children – some of whom would be homosexual and some who would not – could see it as a natural occurrence and not be ashamed’. 9\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAkira Japan, 1988 – 124 minutes Katsuhiro Otomo [Drawings (with brief CGI)] DIRECTOR Katsuhiro Otomo PRODUCER Ryohei Suzuki,\n\nShunzo Kato STORY Katsuhiro Otomo, Izo\n\nHashimoto SCORE Shoji Yamashiro DESIGN Kazuo Ebisawa, Yuji\n\nIkehata, Koji Ohno ANIMATION Takashi\n\nNakamura, Yoshio Takeuchi, Hiroaki Sato\n\n10\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 10\n\nIn July 1988 – both the real date when Akira opened in Japan and the fictional dateline at the start of the film – Tokyo was burned away by a great sphere of light. But in Katsuhiro Otomo’s epic animation, creation and destruction are part of one organic process. Our first sight of Akira’s city, Neo-Tokyo, is of a bleeding red shape, suggesting a heart, lungs or guts. Teen gangs, the city’s true life-blood, rule the streets on huge phallic motorbikes, blurring into neon speedlines down tarmac veins between skyscrapers. Armed police battle rioters, terrorist gangs adding to the mayhem. And in a giant-sized nursery, housing a top-secret state project, three withered children await the return of their divine brother, Akira … . Otomo’s film was a cult hit in the West because of its stunning spectacle and shocking images. For all its political subtexts, Akira is a visceral trip which became a punkish piece of British pop culture and a midnight movie in America. Harry Knowles, the founder of the Ain’t It Cool News website, remembered, ‘College theatres got hold of that film and just played it over and over and over.’ Its cartoon violence looked transgressive to everyone who hadn’t seen Ralph Bakshi’s early films (see p. 54) or the more recent Heavy Metal (1981). Akira’s\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nmost nakedly exploitative moment, reminiscent of Robocop the previous year, comes during the manic opening scenes where an already horribly maimed man is shredded by bullets. From there on, though, bloodletting is secondary to Otomo’s grander vistas of destruction. Considered as a Japanese animation, Akira is a fluke. Director Otomo was primarily a creator of comic strips (his Akira manga, unfinished when he made the film, would run to 2,000 pages). When Akira entered production, Japan was in its booming bubble years. The film had an unprecedented budget of around $10 million (huge for anime), a seventy-strong staff, technology allowing for character lip-synch, and the resources to make ‘full’ animation on twelve or twenty-four frames a second. Even Studio Ghibli films use semi-limited character animation, which is why they’re less smooth than their Hollywood counterparts. Akira’s characters also move far more individually than Ghibli’s, though their explosive fury rarely modulates into anything like pathos. Otomo’s vision was inspired by 1970s Tokyo. ‘There were so many interesting people … . Student demonstrations, bikers, political movements, gangsters, homeless youth … . In Akira, I projected these elements into the future, as science-fiction.’ Halfway through the action, a colonel character brings about a military coup, echoing an actual (failed) insurrection in 1936. A universe is born in an Olympic stadium, as the 1964 Olympics had heralded the rise of post-war Japan. The images of tanks on ‘Tokyo’s’ streets – as in films such as The Flying Ghost Ship (1969) and the later Patlabor 2 (1993) – reflect the fears of another militarisation in the ‘pacifist’ country. ‘We’re in East Ginza’, a soldier reports, placing the action in Tokyo’s best-known shopping district. The film compresses Otomo’s manga into two dazzling but confused hours. Subplots and support characters are truncated or forgotten: plot points are vague or contradictory. The abridged story is in line with earlier SF anime films, such as Space Battleship Yamato (1977) or the Mobile Suit Gundam trilogy (1981–2), though these were edited down from TV cartoon serials rather than comic strips. And yet Akira’s messy plot and information overload are its fascination. More than any SF film since Blade Runner (1982), Otomo’s film hurls viewers into a world bleeding from the screen in multiple hinted backstories.\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 11\n\nThe round-faced boy leads, the cocksure Kaneda and the monster-victim Tetsuo, are believable teenagers, oscillating between sentimental comradeship and murderous hate. The other characters are under-explained and under-developed, but they’re solid on-screen presences, especially the commanding, bull-like colonel who knows Akira’s secret. The spectacle is driven by the explosive breathing and clacking percussion of the musicians Geinoh Yamashirogumi, as Tetsuo mutates into a killer teen demi-god, fighting through tanks and helicopters, then battling a supergirl on a huge metal globe while giant pipes and energy beams take out the infrastructure. ‘It would be great if a film were just one big scene, with no divisions’, Otomo said. But Otomo also stresses Tetsuo’s enraged vulnerability. We’re shown the boy’s nightmare, a ghastly, beautiful scene where he crumbles into rubble in a playground while Kaneda smiles obliviously. Even when Tetsuo wakes, he’s attacked by the psychic kids disguised as childish toys. In another scene, he can’t save his girlfriend from a sexual assault, which is brutal and believable without a trace of exploitation. Afterwards, the boy is shown flailing and staggering screaming on the street, clutching his head, a terrible portrait of teen impotence. The blipvert images that punctuate his fit – flashforwards to the end of the film – include a subliminal glimpse of the girl’s death, which he’s doomed to cause. Finally, Tetsuo’s puberty sends him back to babyhood as he swells into a liquefying giant, mewling, puking and excreting its way into oblivion. The coda is a New Age trip through a vortex of smashed skyscrapers, book-ending the film with twin Armageddons. Even the destruction is beautiful: the buildings buffeted by roiling winds, the sea pouring through concrete wreckage, the sky reflected in a thousand dead-eyed windows. Akira takes place in the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In 2013, the film’s fans were impressed when Tokyo was indeed chosen to host the 2020 Olympic Games. But in Akira, the games are derailed by catastrophic events, something else that Otomo got unnervingly right.\n\n11\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAladdin US, 1992 – 87 minutes John Musker, Ron Clements [Drawings with CGI] DIRECTOR/PRODUCER John\n\nMusker, Ron Clements STORY John Musker,\n\nRon Clements, Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio SCORE Alan Menken DESIGN R. S. Vander Wende ANIMATION Glen Keane,\n\nEric Goldberg, Mark Henn, Andreas Deja\n\n12\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 12\n\nDisney’s hit Aladdin, made on the upswing of the studio’s fortunes in the 1990s, skewed Hollywood cartoon features in new if not necessarily artistic directions. Its star turn, though, was a one-off. Aladdin’s Genie, an S-curved blue stream of cacophonous consciousness, was realised by animator Eric Goldberg and perpetually psyched comedian Robin Williams. ‘The frame speed of animation guarantees that where Williams goes, an instantly compatible image follows’, wrote Sight and Sound’s Farrah Anwar. ‘If he chooses to shoot from a glitzy chat-show host to a heavyweight political figure via a mischievously shaded Jack Nicholson, the film stays with him and has the temerity to ask for more.’ The character’s introduction would have made Walt proud. ‘The ever-impressive …’ (Genie is Schwarzenegger from Pumping Iron, 1977) ‘… the long-contained …’ (Genie strains against the cube that’s trapped him) … ‘often imitated …’ (Genie ventriloquises a dummy) ‘… but never duplicated-duplicated-duplicated’ (Genie throws up a swirl of doubles) … ‘Genie of the LA-AMP!’ (The duplicate Genies applaud, while the original turns into TV host Ed Sullivan.) It might not have moved fans of the wildest Hollywood animators – Tex Avery, for example, or Bob Clampett – but its self-promotion was flawless. In a flash, Disney cartoons had gone from fairytale to Friday night, swimming in a soup of catchphrases and celebrity lookalikes. As with Shrek*, one of Aladdin’s progeny, the film was only doing what cartoons had done decades before. Bugs Bunny, for example, had faced off a caricatured Edward G. Robinson and Peter Lorre back in 1946 (a Friz Freleng short called Racketeer Rabbit). Classic Disney features had one-liners for grown-ups; in Pinocchio*, Jiminy Cricket demands, ‘What does an actor want with a conscience anyway?’ Aladdin, though, made these gags a talking and selling point of a family blockbuster, much as The Simpsons (1989–) had done for a family sitcom. The directors claim the humour was guileless, without commercial agendas. However, it’s hard to believe Jeffery Katzenberg, Disney’s Chairman, didn’t know what he was doing when he aggressively overhauled Aladdin in development. Originally, Aladdin would have been young, not much older than The Jungle Book*’s Mowgli, and his main concern would have been to please his mother, with a tent-pole song called ‘Proud of Your Boy’. This young Aladdin is visible in the film; freeze the moment in the ‘Friend Like Me’ song when the hero is pressed down by Genie’s finger. Legend has it that Katzenberg’s reaction to the young Aladdin was a curt, ‘Eighty-six the mother. Mom’s a zero.’ The mother was utterly erased from the film. From then on Aladdin’s themes shifted from parent–child to buddy-bonding, even keeping in a homoerotic Williams quip: ‘Oh Al, I’m getting kind of fond of you, kid; not that I want to pick out curtains or anything.’ We’re told that Aladdin has layers and esteem issues, which is something that cartoons convey best when the characters are middle-aged and ugly (the Beast, Buzz Lightyear, Mr Incredible, Homer Simpson), though not always even then (Shrek). But Peter Schneider, Disney’s BFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nhead of feature animation, conceded that Aladdin was courting teens, with a buffed-up hero they might want to sleep with. Note the way that Aladdin suddenly gains a mature cheekbone when he first kisses his love interest, the voluptuous Princess Jasmine. Many reviewers thought Aladdin and Jasmine fared about as well against the Genie as Snow White did against the dwarfs. In some scenes, the pair seems almost drawn for mockery – look at their shiny-sappy expressions in the ‘Whole New World’ song, though in fairness that’s followed by some of their best animation, when Jasmine challenges Aladdin while they rest on China’s Forbidden City. Sensibly, their romance is told as a story of escape, discovery and adventure, the film pitching between exuberant and crass. There are theme park rides (a zooming magic-carpet dash was inspired by Disneyland’s ‘Star Tours’ flight simulator), shouty scenes (a parrot sidekick is deafeningly voiced by comedian Gilbert Gottfried), and TV toon pacing (the frantically busy last act). 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 13\n\nWhen I saw Aladdin at a London retrospective screening in 2010, the print had the controversial version of the opening song, ‘Arabian Nights’, including the notorious lyric, ‘They cut off your ear if they don’t like your face.’ (The first draft had been, ‘They’ll hack off your lips if they don’t like your smile.’) In 1992, Aladdin’s panto-burlesque Arabia, chock-full of harem dancers, pointy Viziers and ape-like palace guards, was denounced by Arab groups, and the ‘ear’ line removed from British prints. Given the stink, it’s poignant to watch Genie animator Eric Goldberg on the Aladdin DVD. He explains that he took Williams’s Yiddish exclamations (the Genie’s first word is ‘Oy!’) to mean that what the film is really all about is the friendship between an Arab and a Jew.\n\n13\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAlice Czechoslovakia/UK/Switzerland/West Germany, 1988 – 84 minutes* Jan Svankmajer [Live-action and stop-motion] DIRECTOR/STORY/DESIGN\n\nJan Svankmajer PRODUCER Peter Christian-Fueter ANIMATION Bedrich Glaser\n\nThe avant-garde Czech artist Jan Svankmajer has been in many animation books before this one, a fact he may view with annoyance or amusement. For Svankmajer insists he’s not an animator at all. ‘Animators tend to construct a closed world for themselves’, he says, ‘like pigeon fanciers or rabbit breeders. I’m not interested in animation techniques or in creating a complete illusion, but in bringing life to everyday objects. Surrealism exists in reality, not beside it.’ Svankmajer was influenced by Georges Méliès, and like Méliès he spent decades channelling his ideas through short films, dating back to 1964. In Svankmajer’s usually stop-motion masterpieces, clay heads eat each other; shoes and socks gain eyes and teeth; and stones and dolls perform intricate ritual dances.\n\n* Shown on British television in six segments.\n\n14\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 14\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nReleased under the suspicious gaze of the Communist authorities (which penalised Svankmajer more than once for his works’ suspect content), his films do less to bring the inanimate alive than to breach the barriers between living and unliving. Svankmajer respects dreams, pre-rational childhood and the magical properties of objects and structures, down to the living textures of raw stone, which people imbue with consciousness over years and centuries. By the 1980s, Svankmajer had a world festival following, and Alice, his first feature, found backers outside the Iron Curtain. Britain’s Channel 4 contributed nearly half the budget. As Clare Kitson recounts in her book, British Animation: The Channel 4 Factor, Alice was an underhand production, passed off not as a film but as an ‘audiovisual display’. At the first full screening, the foreign backers were met by angry Czech officials insisting, too late, that a feature film was forbidden. Alice (called Something of Alice in Czech) interprets Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland as a violent, solipsistic nursery game. Much of its action takes place in stone passages (it was shot at a former Prague bakery) or in doll’s houses that shrink outside and in. Apart from a glimpse of Alice’s sister, her face unseen, the sole human is Alice herself, played by a blond, blank-faced little girl. Even she becomes a stop-motion doll for long sequences, while her Wonderland adventures continue without a break. (Svankmajer directed them first, while he was looking for his human actress.) The doll’s face is immobile, yet seems more expressive than the real girl’s. Mercifully it’s the doll-Alice, not the real one, who’s attacked by skullheaded chimeras in a stomach-churning scene whose imagery recalls Starewitch’s The Mascot (see p. 148). Svankmajer’s creations (designed by him and animated by Bedrich Glaser) blur the line between affectless characters and uncanny effects. You may feel more fleeting empathy with a bit of ambulatory meat (a Svankmajer motif) or with a heap of leaves rushing into a desk drawer, than you do with the madly chittering White Rabbit, puckish and malign. (Alice chases him into the story after he escapes a taxidermist’s\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 15\n\nvitrine.) Carroll’s Caterpillar becomes a sock-puppet, building itself with dentures and eyeballs. The Mad Hatter is a Czech marionette, tea dribbling from its wooden torso, as sawdust does from the White Rabbit’s stitching. (Tragically, Svankmajer doesn’t do the Cheshire Cat.) All these creatures are Alice herself – she says their lines, the camera focusing on her lips, or rather another girl’s lips, as ‘Alice’ herself lost a tooth during the shoot. But the child’s transformations mean she herself is another bit of Wonderland, just one more figment of dream. The New Yorker’s Terrence Rafferty deemed Alice a film for children of a certain kind, for the quiet solitary ones who spend hours in conversation with their dolls … whose play will, over the years, perhaps turn into a lonely, obsessive craftsmanship, of the sort animators have.\n\nAmusingly, Svankmajer claimed that Swiss parents dragged their children out of the cinemas, threatening to sue the distributors for such a disturbed and disturbing film. In Britain, Channel 4 serialised Alice at lunchtimes over a holiday week. As Kitson says, it was arguably a better way to see Alice than watching its one-note strangeness straight through. Svankmajer replaces the charm of Carroll’s prose with savage Punch and Judy violence (a slapstick siege of a doll’s house goes on forever). The music-free soundtrack consists of harsh creaks and bumps, while dialogue is atomised into Alice’s flat, piecemeal line-readings (‘‘Your hair needs cutting’, said the Mad Hatter’), around compulsively repetitive action. At times, it’s reminiscent of early computer text adventures, with their atonal pseudo-narratives. The end departs from Carroll, with a mischievously political moment where Alice won’t read a scripted confession, but she’s last seen becoming a tyrannical Queen of Hearts. Svankmajer firmly believes that kids are cruel. In one of his later features, Little Otik (2000), a carved tree-trunk comes to life and devours a hapless social worker, the monster’s baby coos and chuckles punctuated by the splat of human organs against a door.\n\n15\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAllegro non troppo Italy, 1977 – 85 minutes Bruno Bozzetto [Live-action and drawings (with brief stop-motion)] DIRECTOR Bruno Bozzetto STORY Bruno Bozzetto, Guido\n\nManuli, Maurizio Nichetti ANIMATION Bruno Bozzetto,\n\nGiuseppe Lagana, Giancarlo Cereda, Guido Manuli, Paolo Albicocco\n\n16\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 16\n\nIn music, ‘allegro non troppo’ means ‘fast, but not too much’. It’s a modest title for a reckless-seeming homage, a response to the most hubristic cartoon ever made. Like Disney’s Fantasia*, this Italian film sets classical music to animation, so why not call it Fortissimo, or Vivacissimo? Perhaps director Bruno Bozzetto was banking on the audience’s love of underdogs. Fantasia began with the black-jacketed Philadelphia Orchestra sitting down to play, so Allegro non troppo starts with a cleaning lady wiping down the stage. Such is the place of the non-Disney animator; but it also reminds us of Disney’s Snow White and Cinderella, before their fairytale rags became riches. Bozzetto’s film is less a spoof than a humorous commentary, extending the adult content in Fantasia that Disney cloaked in fantasy, and injecting a European pessimism which Walt wouldn’t have tolerated. What Allegro non troppo is not is anti-Disney, in the manner of Tex Avery or Shrek*. Bozzetto saw Fantasia eleven times: ‘Walt Disney left an indelible mark on my childhood.’ Before Allegro, Bozzetto had made a slew of cartoons and features, many starring the hapless Mr Rossi, who was created as a cipher for the Italian Everyman. Rossi cameos in Allegro, where he’s drawn as a doodle on paper, then blithely burned to a crisp. Much of Allegro is live-action (the animation lasts about fifty minutes). The live-action framework is a slapstick, occasionally Pythonesque farce as the film-makers struggle to make their picture with a geriatric woman orchestra and an enslaved animator. (The latter is played by Bozzetto’s collaborator Maurizio Nichetti, who would later direct The Icicle Thief, 1989, and co-direct the part-animated Volere Volare, 1991.) Many reviewers found the live-action obnoxious, and it was reportedly trimmed on some prints. The purpose of these ‘shabby and wacky’ scenes, Bozzetto said, was to counterpoint Fantasia’s over-dignified interludes with Leopold Stokowski and Deems Taylor. Allegro’s live-action is in black and white, so that the colour animation stands in the same relation to it as Oz does to Kansas in The Wizard of Oz (1939). There are seven cartoon segments in the film, three of them outstanding. The first uses Debussy’s ‘Prélude à l’après-midi d’un faune’, a languorous stroking of lust in an unserious Arcadian mythoscape that inevitably recalls the coyly sexualised world in Fantasia’s ‘Pastoral Symphony’. Bozzetto’s twist is to make the faun an ageing roué whose spirit can’t lift his flesh. When he sees a nude nymph, he’s so excited that he stands upside-down, and his tummy puddles round his head. In a landscape flowering with double entendres, there’s no smutty happy ending; the faun shrivels into his dotage. There’s more lust in a lesser segment which uses Stravinsky’s ‘The Firebird’ (later animated in Disney’s Fantasia 2000). Here, hell is endless pink-hued pornography, as giant breasts pour from TV screens. The remarkable ‘Bolero’ sequence took a year to create. Astronauts discard a Coke bottle on a barren planet and life evolves, at first undulating over the landscape as bubbles with eyeballs before chimeric creatures emerge, flowers billowing into dinosaurs. Gradually a villain is glimpsed in the fauna, a sneaky serial-killer ape. It’s a misanthropic joke, more savage than any of Hayao Miyazaki’s eco-fables, though perhaps BFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nto balance it, we see an angelically innocent Adam and Eve in the ‘The Firebird’ episode. The sequence parodies Fantasia’s ‘The Rite of Spring’ and the start of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), but the beautiful morphing images, intelligently built through Ravel’s repeated theme, are a paradigm of animation as a rhythmically sustained, narratively muscular conceit. The film’s most iconic piece, though, is set to Sibelius’s ‘Valse Triste’. A mangy, saucer-eyed cat, its stripes straining against its haunches, skulks around the remnants of its home. Despite, and 100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 17\n\npartly because of, its Margaret Keane-esque eyes, the cat’s face and body are enormously expressive, while the timeshifting scenario anticipates the operatic ‘Magnetic Rose’ in the Japanese Memories. As with the best Disneys, the art is good enough that the manipulation (lazily equated with kitsch) feels like a by-product – surely Bozzetto’s tribute to the Disney of his youth. At the segment’s end, we cut to the live-action orchestra of hag ladies dabbing their eyes and wailing ‘Bravo!’ It feels less like smugness than the self-conscious harrumph of a director shyly trying on Walt’s mantle. 17\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAnimal Farm UK/US, 1954 – 72 minutes John Halas, Joy Batchelor [Drawings] DIRECTOR John Halas,\n\nJoy Batchelor PRODUCER Louis de\n\nRochemont, John Halas, Joy Batchelor STORY Lothar Wolff, Borden\n\nIn the British cartoon of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, the word of Communist revolution is spread by a jowly Old Major pig, who looks and sounds like Winston Churchill. Orwell might have liked that irony, if not necessarily the cartoon (he died before its release). The actor Maurice Denham, who provided the film’s barnyard vocals, claimed the voice fitted the ‘lovely old pig’. But it seems to reflect how even a cartoon that was funded by the CIA wouldn’t conform to straightforward rhetorical agendas. After the Churchillian Major is killed by his own oratory, and collapses and dies on screen, the film’s sparse dialogue is dwarfed by a cacophony of brays, squawks and squeals, a mass of individuals who’ll never surrender.\n\nMace, Philip Stapp, John Halas, Joy Batchelor SCORE Matyas Seiber ANIMATION John F.

Moysey\n\n18\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 18\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nPremièring in New York in 1954, Animal Farm came from Britain’s Halas and Batchelor studio, named for its married founders John Halas and Joy Batchelor. The Hungarian Halas had worked with a pre-Hollywood George Pal. Batchelor was an illustrator-animator from Watford. Before Animal Farm, their studio was known for its government-sponsored shorts, such as 1949’s The Shoemaker and the Hatter, a political fairytale about the virtues of free trade. Amusingly, Animal Farm is equally energetic in showing the exploitative trade between humans and pigs. Animal Farm is often called the first British cartoon feature, though there are two other contenders. In 1927, the director Anson Dyer completed a forty-minute film, The Story of the Flag, about the history behind the Union Jack and other British flags, but his producer sliced it into six shorts. It was Dyer’s later studio in Stroud, Gloucestershire, described as a ‘drab, colourless, three-storey Victorian house’, would become the base for Animal Farm’s production. (The film employed seventy people, when there were fewer than 200 working in British animation.) Before Animal Farm, Halas and Batchelor’s studio made ‘instructional’ feature animations for official use, starting with Handling Ships (1945) for the Admiralty. In Orwell’s Animal Farm, the animals revolt against their tyrant farmer and establish a Communist-style state. However, they’re betrayed by their leader, the sly pig Napoleon, and they end up worse off than ever. An allegory for the Russian Revolution and the rise of Stalin, the tale was subtitled ‘A Fairy Story’. Many critics saw a similar irony in Animal Farm’s adaptation as a cartoon. The Animated Bestiary by Paul Wells quotes a contemporary journal, Cine Technician, on the film: ‘The incongruity of recognisable horrors of some political realities of our times are emphasised and made more troubling by the apparent innocence of the surrounding frame.’ The cartoon draws on Disney’s lyrical and dramatic tropes, stretching them into new territory. If Disney’s first bold run of films hadn’t stalled in the 1940s, perhaps it might have made Animal Farm\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 19\n\nafter Bambi*, which was at least figuratively red in tooth and claw. But for contemporary viewers, Animal Farm was showing things Disney would never have dared to, such as the shocking animal executions or the cruel fate of the Herculean horse Boxer, last seen still struggling for freedom as he’s carted off to the knacker’s yard. Such scenes would have had a terrible extra meaning for the half-Jewish Halas, who lost a brother and other relatives in the Holocaust. The film’s painterly backdrops make surfaces into colours, often speckled, splotched or daubed. The animals’ faces are less expressive than their bodies, which vividly highlight what it is to have four legs. When the pig Snowball (Orwell’s analogue for Trotsky) runs frantically for his life, his plump back becomes a jiggling curve. The horse Boxer’s pathos is inseparable from his burdened bulk, but the most expressive face-acting comes from his donkey ally, Benjamin. A moment when Benjamin regards his stricken friend in a storm stands comparison with Disney. The lighter, more cosily Disneyesque sequences, led by a cute duckling, are only interludes. (The credited animation director was John F. Reed, who’d worked at Disney, but who later broke with Halas and Batchelor on bad terms.) The film starts and ends in the heat of anger, more visceral than Orwell’s prose. Animal Farm’s secret funding by the CIA as Cold War propaganda is detailed in Daniel Leab’s book, Orwell Subverted: The CIA and the Making of Animal Farm. Yet, while there are changes to Orwell’s text – for example, the film reduces the evil Napoleon to a greedy thug – the streamlined story inadvertently deepens the lament that the revolution didn’t work (and might it have, had Snowball guarded himself better?). The changed ending, where the animals enact a counter-revolution, muddies the moral ground, but it’s hard to imagine any film catching the despair of Orwell’s last lines. Even so, the very last frames in the film show Benjamin stepping slightly forward from his allies. A hint, perhaps, that the ‘hero’ donkey is doomed to become the next animal tyrant?\n\n19\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nAnomalisa US, 2015 – 90 minutes Charlie Kaufman, Duke Johnson [Stop-motion] DIRECTOR Charlie Kaufman,\n\nDuke Johnson STORY Charlie Kaufman PRODUCER Rosa Tran, Duke\n\nJohnson, Charlie Kaufman, Dino Stamapoulous SCORE Carter Burwell DESIGN John Joyce, Huy Vu ANIMATION Peggy Arel,\n\nRichard Kent Burton, Sergio Lara, Timothy Reckart\n\n20\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 20\n\nStanley Kubrick’s The Shining (1980) presented the vast, remote Overlook Hotel which isolates people, nurtures the dark in their souls, and drives them to murder. But from an existential point of view, the Fregoli hotel in Charlie Kaufman’s stop-motion Anomalisa is worse. It already reflects the soul of the protagonist Michael, his life, his world, his feelings. He’s beige, bored, listless beyond the expression of misery. ‘My face squeezes into the crying contortion, but nothing comes out; I need tears’, Michael declares. ‘Like not being able to come.’ Michael’s sad story – sad for him, though you may struggle to feel sympathy for the guy – is set mostly over one night. Voiced by David Thewlis, he’s a middle-aged customer service specialist checking into the Fregoli, due to speak at a conference. He has a wife and young son, but neither truly exist to him. No-one in Michael’s world exists to him. Every person he meets or speaks to, stranger or family, speaks in the same soft male voice, regardless of their age or gender. The voice is of actor Tom Noonan. The critic Robbin Collin called it ‘affectless, margariney blither’, but I found Thewlis’ Lancastrian tones more unpleasant within the film, their querulous entitlement so undeserved by the wretch he plays. Trying to break his spiritual fug, Michael rings an old girlfriend, but their meeting in the bar is toe-curling. Michael doesn’t recognise her at first; when he hugs her a moment later, it just feels cruel. Disaster follows. But later that evening, Michael is stunned to hear a new voice, a woman’s voice arising from the Fregoli’s monotony. It belongs to a shy, pretty, very young woman called Lisa, voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. By chance, she’s also in customer service, and she loves Michael’s motivational writing. His fantasies and libido aflame, Michael persuades her into his room… but there’s no redemption for him. Anomalisa’s puppet characters have minimal caricature. There’s just the slight oddness of their perceived proportions. Your eyes go to Lisa’s oversized-seeming hands as she gestures happily. You wonder at how shrunken, how doll-like, Michael looks from the back. The faces can be comical – a hilariously passive-aggressive motormouth taxi driver who drives Michael to the hotel could have fitted into Aardman’s Creature Comforts (1989). But more often, the faces look heartbreaking. Watch Lisa’s expressions when Michael takes her to his room, her smiles showing her fears, or rising over them. Sixteen years before, Kaufman scripted the live-action fantasy, Being John Malkovich (1999), directed by Spike Jonze. It was Kaufman’s break-out. Among other things, Malkovich was an ode to puppetry, showing puppets as a liberating force; ‘being inside another skin, thinking differently, moving differently’. Anomalisa reverses all that. Its puppets are shells, emptied of their illusory egos. Even Michael’s face is a detachable mask, with ever-visible black seams. And of course, Anomalisa subverts the liberating powers of animation. You could easily imagine Kaufman’s scripts for Malkovich or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (filmed by Michael Gondry in BFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\n2004) as animated fantasies, full of limitless mindscapes. Instead, Anomalisa takes place in one drab building, with the pacing of an indy-film chamber piece. An animation of alienation, the film recalls Richard Linklater’s A Scanner Darkly (2006) whose rotoscoping suggested a reality forever hidden from its drug-addled players. As a portrait of midlife male depression, Anomalisa overlaps with the adult animation series BoJack Horseman, which began in 2014. BoJack, though, had an ensemble of lively characters around its star misogynist. Some reviewers found Anomalisa’s focus on Michael unbearable, with his cheating and delusions and selfishness and self-pity. But the animation lets the women’s tender humanity shine: the ex-girlfriend’s sad self-consciousness, the fragile cheer of Lisa. A scene where she launches into an a capella rendition of ‘Girls Just Want to Have Fun’, imbuing the song with her hesitant hopes, will remind any\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 21\n\nGhibli fan of the ‘Country Road’ violin performance in Whisper of the Heart*. But in Anomalisa, Michael interrupts the song at exactly the wrong moment, smashing the magic back down to awkwardness, just when we think he deserves this crumb of happiness. Oddly enough, Anomalisa has a happy end. Joy comes to Lisa, who deserves it, overturning the film’s male solipsism. Lisa’s happiness is something Michael will never know about, and rightly so. Initially funded by Kickstarter, Anomalisa was animated at Starburns Industries in Burbank. The film had originated as a voicebased play in 2005, performed by Thewlis, Leigh and Noonan. ‘It was designed to be seen, but what you were seeing was not what you were hearing’, said Kaufman, who wrote the play under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli. Fregoli, which is also the hotel’s name, is a delusion; its sufferers believe different people are really the same people.\n\n21\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nApril and the Extraordinary World France/Belgium/Canada, 2015 – 106 minutes Christian Desmares, Franck Ekinci [Drawings with CGI] DIRECTOR Christian Desmares,\n\nFranck Ekinci PRODUCER Mark Jousset,\n\nFranck Ekinci, Brice Garnier, Denis Delcampe STORY Franck Ekinci,\n\nBenjamin Legrand SCORE Valentin Hadjadj DESIGN Franck Ekinci, Tardi ANIMATION Guillaume\n\nBourachot, Lionel Marchand, Davy Durand, Thomas Charra\n\n22\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 22\n\nSteampunk is a science-fiction sub-genre which celebrates the past. It’s rooted in the adventure stories and fabulous inventions of vintage fiction, especially Jules Verne and his illustrators. Hollywood has dabbled with steampunk, but its high-profile efforts are often disappointments (2007’s The Golden Compass) or commercial disasters (2018’s Mortal Engines, Disney’s animated Treasure Planet, 2002). Yet animated steampunk has flourished outside America. Invention for Destruction* (from Czechoslovakia) and Laputa* (from Japan) are both in this book. Beyond Laputa, there are umpteen other steampunk anime, including Steamboy (2004), a joyous spectacle by Akira*’s director Katsuhiro Otomo. A year later, Anthony Lucas directed the Australian silhouette animation The Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morella. Running 26 minutes, it was nominated for the Best Animated Short Oscar. A decade further on, the excellent April and the Extraordinary World returned steampunk to France – its arguable birthplace, given the Verne connection. Unlike many steampunk works, the film carefully explains its alternative history. In a prologue, Emperor Napoleon III goes to a sinister laboratory which accidentally explodes, the kind of cataclysm which used to end Universal’s horror movies. Consequently, the FrancoPrussian war of 1870 doesn’t happen, and world history changes. Later, scientists from Einstein to Marconi are mysteriously abducted, locking humanity in a world of soot, steam and clanking Jules Verne machinery. But for all the detailed backstory, the focus is on its title character. April is a young woman runaway, the child of scientists and a brilliant chemist herself, experimenting in a secret room at the top of a giant military statue in Paris. Voiced in the French version by Marion Cottillard, April is headstrong, practical, sharp-tongued and completely sympathetic. For a while, her only companion is an ailing talking cat – the fruit of a family experiment – whom she treats brusquely but who she’s desperate to save. Later a young man turns up, whom April treats with glowering suspicion – rightly, as we’ve seen he’s in the service of her enemies. April is often very funny, but it doesn’t go for pulp-pastiche archness. The stakes are clear and the adventure is expertly constructed, as April and her companions are chased by multiple factions (including a corpulent bowler-hatted policeman with a decades-long obsession, a la Javert in Les Misérables). The film is intelligent within its genre. Viewers may spot a seeming plot hole in the first act to do with a MacGuffin serum, but it sets up a smart twist later. Non-human characters eventually appear, allowing for some good silly comedy, but they’re not a homogenous mass; indeed, their conflicts are their undoing. As steampunk, the film glories in its fantasy machines, especially its vehicles. There are giant elevated trams, an underground monorail, and an innocent-looking castle that grows legs and walks around. Co-director Christian Desmares acknowledged Hayao Miyazaki as ‘a big inspiration’, and fans of Miyazaki may find a few too many borrowings. For example, the walking castle recalls the one in Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle (2006), another steampunk adventure. BFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBut the self-reliant April herself feels like a riposte to Miyazaki’s classic Laputa, which played shamelessly to boys’ hero fantasies of protecting pretty girls. Then again, Desmares said his own favourite scene is when April awkwardly wears a dress for the first time, uneasy with her femininity. Her animation here is about her hands, arms and elbows, not knowing what to do with the dress or themselves. April’s graphic style is based on French comics. The simple, earthy colours aren’t far from Laputa, but April is much more a celebration of the line, with characters and objects defined by thick black borders with felt-tip tactility. The look recalls Disney’s One Hundred and One Dalmatians*, but with even thicker lines. ‘Graphic Direction’ is credited to Jacques Tardi, a famed French comics artist. However, April wasn’t based on his strip, contrary to some reports.\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 23\n\nEven so, this is a better animation of European ligne claire (clear line) comics than The Adventures of Tintin (2011), Spielberg’s awkward and ludicrous effort to translate Hergé into motion-capture. April is also superior to 2010’s The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec, a live-action version of Tardi’s own comics by Luc Besson. Je Suis Bien Content, April’s studio, had form in adapting French comics, having made Persepolis*. Sadly, April flopped terribly; it earned about half a million dollars in cinemas, against a budget of around ten million dollars. But it had glowing reviews, unlike another commercial disaster which opened almost exactly the same time – Tomorrowland, the live-action Disney blockbuster by Brad Bird (The Incredibles*). Coincidentally, the two films have extremely similar images of rockets rising through the Eiffel Tower – though it’s a double Eiffel tower in April’s extraordinary world.\n\n23\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBambi US, 1942 – 70 minutes David Hand [Drawings] DIRECTOR David Hand STORY Perce Pearce, Larry\n\nMorey, George Stallings, Melvin Shaw SCORE Frank Churchill,\n\nEdward Plumb\n\nBy 1942, Disney was at war. On the day of Pearl Harbor, the studio’s sound-stage had been commandeered by the US army for vehicle and anti-aircraft gun maintenance, with three million rounds of ammo stored in the parking lot. Mickey and Donald were starring in public-information films about chemical warfare, while propaganda shorts included a resprayed Three Little Pigs (1933) with a Nazi wolf. Of Bambi’s cast, Friend Owl, who swoops through the softly radiant forest at the film’s start, appeared on an army-commissioned insignia … wielding a machine gun. Flower the skunk popped up on another, in a gas mask. At Bambi’s world première in London in August 1942, the climactic forest fire must have struck\n\nANIMATION Frank Thomas,\n\nMilt Kahl, Eric Larson, Ollie Johnston\n\n24\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 24\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\na chord with the Blitzed audience. A film with no on-screen humans was now attached to humanity’s greatest conflict, whether Walt and his audience liked it or not. Bambi: A Life in the Woods was written in 1923 by the JewishAustrian novelist and playwright Siegmund Salzmann, writing as Felix Salten. Disney was introduced to the book in 1935 by MGM director–producer Sidney A. Franklin, who’d purchased the rights but was flummoxed by how to turn the deer drama into live-action. Walt announced the project days after Snow White’s triumphant première, by which time Salzmann’s book had been banned by the Nazis. It was the headiest time in Disney’s history, of unbelievable creative ambition and fecundity. Not content with one feature follow-up to Snow White*, Walt ploughed ahead with three: Bambi*, Pinocchio* and Fantasia*, while he was also developing Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). But the golden period ended when war broke out in Europe. The foreign markets vanished and Pinocchio and Fantasia, released in 1940, both flopped. In 1941, a bitter strike soured the studio and coloured Walt’s reputation ever after. Bambi’s core animators were unaffected, but the strike delayed the later stages of an already sluggish production, even before Pearl Harbor. Bambi made extensive use of the costly multiplane camera, giving depth to scenes such as the glorious opening forest reverie. Meanwhile, artists struggled to give the cartoon animals realistic anatomies (Snow White’s deer were flour sacks in comparison). The deer’s faces, they learned, did not squash and stretch; those principles were better applied to their haunches, ‘shoulders’ and toe-tips to convey a ‘massive swelling and thrusting up in the body’, as Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston put it in their book, The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation. While the picture men studied fawns in a purpose-built studio zoo – and a deer carcass in a noisome art class – costs rose and nerves frayed. Walt made swingeing cuts to the film, reducing the animators to tears, but the last-ditch economies weren’t enough. Bambi was yet another flop, and Disney entered what Walt reportedly called its ‘mashed potato and gravy’ phase of cheaper films, until Cinderella* in 1950.\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 25\n\nTo say that Bambi is about frolicking woodland animals is like saying The Lord of the Rings is about little men with hairy feet. Everyone knows the cute scenes; baby Bambi stuck on a fallen treetrunk (one of the test animations that convinced Walt to make the film) or the rabbit Thumper’s seduction by a girl bunny, his libido displaced to a helplessly pedalling paw. The children, led by Thumper, are all stumbles, laughter and chatter. The adults move cautiously and speak sparsely, sometimes with devastating weight: ‘Man … was in the forest’; ‘Your mother can’t be with you any more.’ The focus is squarely on the beautifully drawn animals, their surroundings pushed back into pearly mist and negative space. The backgrounds were inspired by Tyrus Wong, whose sketches encouraged his fellow artists to soften and blur the branches and grasses of Bambi’s world. Impressionism blends with expressionism in bursts of colour. The forest fire is a shivering yellow painting, towering over the trees; the screen brightens to red-orange as the deer herd flees man; Bambi’s fight with a rival stag is all struggling silhouettes, rimmed by livid golds and icy blues. Scene flows to scene with absolute simplicity; the dance of Fall leaves links the film briefly to Fantasia. The terrible human villain is never seen, and the death of Bambi’s mother – one of cinema’s alltime traumas – is restricted to a gunshot, the bleakest of snowscapes and a heartbreaking tear. That Walt cuts from this to the silliest of spring-themed symphonies (with twittering bluebirds modelled on a 1933 short, Birds in the Spring) shows his trust and mastery of a medium that turns on a dime in a way unthinkable in live-action. The majestic final hero shot, of a stag standing proud and his father retreating, is Disney masculinity at its most iconic. We laugh and we grieve, but mostly we marvel, at a faun’s blinking introduction to a little April shower, to the miracles of snow and ice, to the magnificent herd representing the mystery of adulthood, bounding over Bambi’s head with the clash of cymbals. Disney’s point, admirably unspoken but transparent to a child, is that the fun and fear, the silliness and heartbreak, are all of a piece. This is a real grown-up cartoon.\n\n25\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBeauty and the Beast US, 1991 – 84 minutes (extended to 91 minutes in the 2002 Special Edition) Kirk Wise, Gary Trousdale [Drawings with CGI] DIRECTOR Gary Trousdale,\n\nKirk Wise PRODUCER Don Hahn STORY Linda Woolverton,\n\nBrenda Chapman, Burny Mattinson SCORE Alan Menken ANIMATION James Baxter,\n\nMark Henn, Glen Keane, Andreas Deja\n\n26\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 26\n\nDisney’s Beauty and the Beast is a tale of transformation, narrated in the overtly stylised fashion of Broadway. Accounts of the film’s production tend to foreground not directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale, but animator Glen Keane, who supervised the reforming Beast, and lyricist Howard Ashman, who directed the singers from his sick-bed as he lay dying from AIDS. The musician Alan Menken deserves equal credit, but his lush style, unlike Ashman’s pawky lyrics, was sadly institutionalised in subsequent Disney films. Following 1989’s The Little Mermaid* (everyone seems to forget about The Rescuers Down Under in 1990), Beauty and the Beast cemented Disney’s ‘return’ as an animation studio. Until Up (and arguably Avatar) in 2009, it was the only animated feature nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, losing to The Silence of the Lambs in 1991. For sceptics, though, the new Disney was already brand-Disney. Beauty and the Beast was supposed to have been directed by London animators Richard Purdum and Jill Thomas, whose studio employed, among others, a young Michael Dudok de Wit, the future director of The Red Turtle*. The Purdums wanted a non-musical film, ‘something not in the Disney mould’, according to producer Don Hahn. They were let\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\ngo, and Ashman and Menken brought aboard to repeat their musical success from The Little Mermaid. However, Jill Thomas claims that Dudok de Wit’s storyboards for a forest chase found their way unacknowledged into the final film. Beauty and the Beast’s first screening was in a uniquely metamorphic state at the 1991 New York Film Festival. This ‘Work in Progress’ (included on the DVD) interleaves pieces of finished animation with moving pencil sketches, static concept art and rough blockings, with the liquid mystery of Cocteau’s La Belle et la bête (1946). In the giant ballroom, the titular dancers (hand-animated in the finished scene by James Baxter) are wire-frames moving in staccato, clockwork increments against the monochrome geometries of early CGI. The Beast – shown mostly in naked pencil tests – is a mass of snarling lines, dissolving into ensouled shades and scribbles, like Forbidden Planet’s (1956) Id monster. The finished film lacks these dimensions, but it has a freshness and energy palpable in Belle’s first swinging steps as she walks ‘towards’ camera with the presence of Julie Andrews, cueing her small provincial town to wake up and sing. Her song, ‘Belle’, is the radiant flipside to Menken and Ashman’s tragicomic ‘Skid Row’ in the stage musical The Little Shop of Horrors nine years before. Even the villainous Gaston, a preening Adonis, is first seen uplifting the chorus with his chauvinist baritone. Some of the animated crowd shots are trite and mechanical by classic Disney standards, especially in the finales to ‘Belle’ and ‘Gaston’, but they’re easily outweighed by the flair of a jaunty, stand-shuffling French candlestick introducing the next number (‘The dining room proudly presents … your dinner!’), or by the ballroom’s swirling camerawork. This same flair makes Belle’s overstated feistiness continually charming, now that its counter-stereotype has been thoroughly outmoded by the post-Disney heroines of Belleville Rendez-Vous*, Persepolis* and Sita Sings the Blues*. Back in the day, academics argued if Beauty and the Beast might be feminist (the man must reform to be fit for the woman; the woman’s gaze is balanced against the man’s in the ‘Something There’ duet) or not (it’s still a fairytale marriage plot, and Belle happily loses herself\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 27\n\nagainst the Beast’s chest or paw). Perhaps inadvertently, there’s some looking-glass recursion about Belle’s place in the story. We and the Beast know Belle is the answer to his predicament (‘Who could ever learn to love a Beast?’). But the story is told through Belle, a wideeyed adventuress and dreamer who might have almost conjured up the Beast, castle and all. These entwined framings add piquancy to the moment of (ostensible) free will when the Beast spurns their predestined story and frees Belle, sacrificing himself for love of her. The critic Marina Warner wrote of Keane’s Beast as ‘male desire incarnate; he swells, he towers, he inflates, he tumesces’. But it’s a displaced, sublimated desire beside Cocteau’s literally smouldering Beast, or the throbbing cartoon Wolf of Tex Avery’s Red Hot Riding Hood (1943). Disney’s Beast hates and fears his monstrous body, like the incontinently ballooning boy in Akira*. When he doesn’t get his way, his roars give way to confused petulance in a snappy scene when he argues through Belle’s door. (Keane based the Beast’s comedic moments on Jackie Gleason in The Honeymooners, 1955.) Then he’s coaxed into bathing, table manners and dance steps. In one sight gag, he’s made up like the Cowardly Lion, though that’s the limit. His manly honour is restored in a stormy rooftop battle, causing his saintly death and transfiguration in a crescendo of arched limbs and billowing linework. His human form is striking in the first reveal, until he speaks. Keane drew another muscled Disney hero in 1999’s Tarzan, but that character’s physique outstripped his personality. CGI films tend to relegate monsters to comic or cuddly duties, while Shrek* tried revising Beauty and the Beast by turning a beautiful princess into a homely ogress. Hayao Miyazaki’s Howl’s Moving Castle (2004) countrasted its hero’s monstrous transformations with a girl’s empowering human changes, from young to old and all points between. Another Japanese film, Mamoru Hosoda’s Belle (2021) reworked some of the central images from Disney’s film, including the ballroom dance. Hosoda’s purpose was neither subversion nor parody, but rather an earnest reinterpretation in which a new Belle – a schoolgirl who wears a digital avatar in a cyber-universe – determines to save her Beast without needing to fall in fairy-tale love.\n\n27\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBelladonna of Sadness Japan, 1973 – 87 minutes Eiichi Yamamoto [Drawings] DIRECTOR Eiichi Yamamoto STORY Eiichi Yamamoto,\n\nYoshiyuki Fukuda ANIMATION Tsueno Maeda,\n\nShinichi Tsuji\n\n28\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 28\n\nIt’s 1973, and the studio Mushi Production, which did much to propel Japanese animation, is bankrupt, collapsing and dying. Just before the end, it releases a last film… Belladonna opens with a twangy guitar, a rousing folk chorus and sketchy pictures that do not move but scroll from right to left (the reading direction for Japanese audiences, and for today’s Western manga fans). Colour is added and the pictures become more refined, but it’s more than a minute before there’s any animation. Indeed, much of Belladonna is ‘still’ pictures, even if those pictures are scrolled, zoomed or oth-\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nerwise jerked around. Belladonna alternates between lambent static watercolours, scratchier scrolling tableaux and unbridled runway animated orgies. The story plays as a gender-swapped Faust. In medieval France, virginal Jeanne is wed to her strapping beau Jean, ‘smiled upon by God’ as the song lyrics tells us. Moments later, she’s raped by the local lord, symbolised by her body being chainsawed, then pumped by a monstrous hypodermic. After her ordeal, Jeanne returns to Jean, the blood fresh on her legs. Her husband talks to her gently, then nearly strangles her as damaged goods. So much for God’s blessing. That’s when the phallus-shaped Devil appears to Jeanne, initially as a cute flesh vibrator (he rubs himself on her palm, the cheeky fellow!). Later, he gets much bigger. He guides Jeanne to both power and self-destruction, yet he’s more honest and loyal to her than her cruel world ever is. Jeanne’s last, seemingly nonsensical acts make symbolic sense if we accept what the Devil says repeatedly; that he is her, she is him, and they are not just the walrus but every creature on this godless earth. That idea is illustrated through one of the film’s psychedelic animated sequences, as Jeanne is blasphemously born again. That process involves Jeanne having, or imagining, a tsunami of sex on a mountain with a mountain. Her climax is accompanied by jangly cymbals and guitars, and also by crowds of Yellow Submarine* cartoon zanies, as time rewinds to the Big Bang. After sex comes death. Bubonic plague bugs zing round the screen, annihilating the world to further funky music beats, as screaming skeletons crumble into sand. Those animated moments can dazzle, especially in the film’s second half where they rise to match an increasingly wild story. As cashstrapped as Belladonna was, the filmmakers put their money where it mattered. Even so, you’re still often watching static illustrations, ‘animated’ only by music and voice-overs. The experience would seem less strange to fans of a later Japanese industry, Visual Novels. Played on computer, Visual Novels are interactive picture stories, with anime-style static art and frequent sexual content. Ironically, Belladonna, their ancestor, doesn’t use anime-style pictures. Belladonna’s artwork is often compared to Gustav Klimt’s paintings, especially in the abstract compositions. But the imagery\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 29\n\nalso recalls French comics, the more erotic of the bandes desinées, popularised in the 1960s by Barbarella. Older British readers might also think of the picture-storytelling series Jackanory… but this a Jackanory whose pictures are filled with pulsing penises and vaginas, and where one of the main characters is a laughing, rampant Satan so throbbingly priapic he makes Giger’s Aliens shy prudes. He’s brilliantly voiced by actor Tatsuya Nakadai, who’d play the King Lear figure in Akira Kurosawa’s Ran (1985). Like Belladonna’s near-contemporary, the American adult animation Fritz the Cat*, the film looks remarkably unsexy, considering that its heroine spends much of the time naked and moaning. But it’s a fine complement to another film made the same year – Britain’s The Wicker Man (1973), another vision of pagan liberation with a folkish score. Disney revelled in women’s satanic sexuality decades earlier; witness the she-devils in the ‘Bald Mountain’ climax to Fantasia.* But Disney never suggested a raped woman could be empowered by conjuring her own mountain-sized phallus. Belladonna’s studio Mushi Production was founded in Japan by the nationally famed comics artist Osamu Tezuka. In 1963, Mushi began the TV series Astro Boy, which helped define the postwar anime industry that followed. Astro Boy was aimed at children, but Mushi later released adult features, of which Belladonna was the third, last and best. It didn’t involve Tezuka, who’d left by then. Instead, the film was directed by his long-time associate, Eiichi Yamamoto, who said he wanted an animated vision to challenge Britain’s recent Yellow Submarine. Belladonna played at the 1973 Berlin Film Festival – where Spirited Away* would triumph twenty-nine years later – but the film bombed in Japan. Yamamoto was shocked to see a tag on Japanese posters, ‘From Astro Boy to Belladonna’, ludicrously linking his erotic opus with kids’ fare. Belladonna would finally enjoy a 4K restoration in 2015. To watch it now is to see a doomed studio’s tale of a doomed woman, ravishing itself back to life. Mushi Production reassembled in 1977 and operates today, but according to animation historian Fred Patten, ‘it was an entirely new studio with a different staff’.\n\n29\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBelleville Rendez-Vous (The Triplets of Belleville)* France/Canada/Belgium, 2003 – 80 minutes Sylvain Chomet [Drawings with CGI and brief live-action] DIRECTOR/STORY\n\nSylvain Chomet PRODUCER Didier Brunner SCORE Benoît Charest DESIGN Sylvain Chomet,\n\nEvgeni Tomov ANIMATION Nicolas Quéré,\n\nEmmanuel Guille, Antoine Dartige, Jean-Christophe Lie\n\nIn 2009, I interviewed Pete Docter and Jonas Rivera, director and producer of Pixar’s Up.

Maybe I’m sexist, but it just didn’t seem appealing as an old woman, someone who would slam the door in people’s faces.’ Rivera concurred. ‘It’s almost movie logic; an old man gets more licence than an old woman.’ Six years earlier, though, the French director Sylvain Chomet made an Oscar-nominated feature about a dourly heroic granny. In the film, she odysseys to the towering city of ‘Belleville’ (a Frenchified New York) to save her kidnapped grandson, and encounters a benign three-crone coven of witchy musicians. Given the way Up goes, it’s funny to see Belleville’s granny bop a boy scout painfully on the head. Madame Souza, as our heroine is called, has a firm, querulous presence that’s charismatic in itself. She only speaks three times, and we don’t see her speak, which would be as wrong as Nick Park’s dog Gromit suddenly growing a mouth. Souza’s whiskery mouth is an obstinate line, contrasting with her busy black eyes. The comedy has minimal dialogue, taking its lead from Jacques Tati (there’s a live-action clip from Jour de Fête, 1949) and the only significant speech is at the beginning and the end. We start in France, where Souza adopts her orphaned-waif grandson, Champion. The grief is lower key than in Up, but no less believable. A moment where Souza tries teaching Champion to play the piano is moving; Champion shakes his head helplessly and flees, while Souza plays a sad bottom note. She brightens him up by getting him a dog and bicycle (a reminder of his cyclist parents), and training him for the Tour de France. For a while, she communicates by blowing an insistent trainer’s whistle. That and her huge orthopaedic shoe suggest the props of a clown whom no one would dare call funny. The film is funny, of course, but Chomet doesn’t indulge us; he spaces his gags out for the biggest laughs, and sprinkles them with vinegar. Disrespecting human dignity is one theme. Souza loves her grandson, but she has a unique way of showing it, toning his legs with a vacuum and egg-whisk and making him into, as critic Nick Bradshaw put it, ‘the racing cyclist equivalent of a prize ox, all piston thighs and baleful eyes’. One villain is a human mouse, with a squeak and Mickey ears. The exhausted cyclists are compared to slaughtered pigs and horses. In the nastiest scene, a clapped-out cyclist (not Champion) is casually murdered. We see the victim trembling, his eyes huge and rolling … and then, before the shot, Chomet throws in a whinny.\n\n* The film was released in British cinemas as Belleville Rendez-vous, the name of its opening song. It was issued on UK DVD under the same name but also as The Triplets of Belleville, a translation of the French title, Les Triplettes de Belleville. It had the Triplets name in America. 30\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 30\n\nBFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nThe misanthropy is lightened by Souza’s mini-heroics. When Champion is kidnapped by the killers (wine-swilling Mafiosos), Souza chases them on a pedalo. We see the indomitable granny surmounting huge ocean waves in the film’s defining image, accompanied by Mozart’s C-Minor Mass. Even the bovine cyclists’ purposeless pedalling is more authentic than the traffic jams and ceaselessly rattling trains of Belleville’s world. The climactic chase is built round the joke of the villains driving stretch-limo 2CVs which can barely turn corners and flip backwards on slopes like dominos. The aged ‘triplettes’ whom Souza meets make STOMP-style music from fridges, vacuums and newspapers (Souza adds a bike wheel). The unplugged ethos is mirrored in the low-tech animation. Belleville opens with a bouncy, fantastical homage to Fleischer’s 1930s ‘Talkartoons’, which included surreal classics such as Minnie the Moocher (1932) (see p. 126). In Chomet’s tribute, Fred Astaire\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 31\n\nis devoured by dance shoes, banana dancer Josephine Baker is mugged by monkey-men, and the average viewer wishes it could go on longer. (Who Framed Roger Rabbit* had the same problem: both films open too well.) The prologue is in scratched monochrome, while the film proper consists of scratchily elegant drawings in brownish palettes, suggesting earth and sepia. The kooky players include coffin-shaped gangsters (who slot together like lego) and a literally spineless maître’d. The cute characters soon drop out, barring a grossly fat and lovable dog who takes some of the sting out of Chomet’s insistence that Americans are all supersized barrage balloons. (‘Because they are!’ he snapped at one interviewer who asked.) The last scenes sum up the film; a comic climax, a belly-laugh, a bittersweet coda consigning the tale to nostalgia, and a deadpan gag for viewers who wait through the credits.\n\n31\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nBoy and the World Brazil, 2013 – 80 minutes Alê Abreu [Drawings with live-action] DIRECTOR/STORY/ANIMATION\n\nAlê Abreu SCORE Ruben Feffer,\n\nGustavo Kurlat ANIMATION ASSISTANTS\n\nBruno Coltro Ferrari, Daniel Puddles, Diogo Ni Cavalcanti, Erika Marques de Lima\n\n32\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 32\n\nThe title hero of the wonderful Brazilian film Boy and the World is drawn with so few lines that you can almost count them. The boy’s head is a lightbulb with thick vertical plug-lines for eyes, cute red cheek blushes and three tuft-hairs. His shirt is an accordion of red stripes. His arms and legs are sticks. A few reviewers found him hard to care about, especially as he gasps and chuckles but never says a word. For everyone else, he’s Us from the moment he appears. The boy, called Cuca in the press materials, goes on a journey to find his lost father, who took a train to the city and never returned. Cuca’s journey starts in hope and wonder and ends with visions of an eco-Armageddon. But there’s still hope at the end, though viewed through sadder adult eyes. The whole story is told without dialogue; a few lines of Brazilian Portuguese are spoken backwards. A brilliant soundscape drives the film, in which the sound ‘effects’ and the music – from sweet pipes to layered alt-pop vocals to reverberating choruses of doom – are integrated as a whole. The film’s world is much less minimal than Cuca. Sometimes the film presents us with extremely complex visions, lovely or ugly. The ugly city, especially, is obsessively overbuilt… and yet there’s always a delightful simplicity beneath. It could be the paper the film was drawn on; many of the shots have bare white backgrounds. In fact, the animation was first created on computer, then redrawn on paper with pencils and chalks. Repeating visual patterns are used spectacularly, evoking child’s-eye infinities. Then a carnival of new characters stride on, all different shapes and colours that we barely see before they’re gone again. There are Alice shifts in reality. The characters can be on a bumpy line that represents a road; then rain falls and that line’s a stormy sea. Even when we reach the huge mountain city that’s plainly ‘evil’ within the film’s moral compass (as was a similar city in France’s The King and the Mockingbird*), there’s room for cartoon pleasures. Cuca and a grown-up mount a bike and zoom bumpily down the city’s endless steps. An oblivious Cuca is lifted up on construction girders, falls into a grid of cargo crates and nearly get squashed – comedy business from any classic Hollywood cartoon. Though feature-length, Boy and the World feels like the short films shown at animation festivals, especially in the agitprop-style messaging that rises from a whisper to a crescendo. It conflates eco-destruction with advertising, automation, capitalism, fashion and fascist violence. Machines are monsters. A giant angel bird, representing the people’s true will, defies them but is blasted by tanks and helicopters with beady eyes. In comparison, Japan’s Hayao Miyazaki – who’s sometimes accused of haranguing audiences with ecothemes – is more nuanced; he can sympathise with even nature’s despoilers. Of course, Brazilian audiences who’ve lived through despotic regimes and extreme inequities will see bitter, bloody allegories in the film, though it sheds no blood at all. BFI SCREEN GUIDES\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nOn first viewing, I missed the story’s last twist, which is poetic, but could have easily been clearer. Spoiler: the two men who help Cuca are both Cuca too. By implication, the oldest Cuca may be dreaming the story, wondering what his child self would make of the adult world. The writer-director Alê Abreu studied the work of Andrei Tarkovsky while making his film, which has traces of the non-linear Mirror (1975). The twist changes the film on rewatching; but more crucially, it changes the perspective of the narrative. No longer is this about a plucky child who we expect to save the day, or the world, as in so many cartoons. Yet new children will still be born, and they won’t give up.\n\n100 ANIMATED FEATURE FILMS\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 33\n\nWhile the film is truly singular, it has animated relatives. Some portions, such as a sequence where Cuca explores a cotton field, recall Japan’s Night on the Galactic Railroad*, another boy’s fantasy journey. At the film’s most violent moment, animation gives way to live-action, as it did in Waltz with Bashir*, though here the picture is literally burned away. On the joyful side, the opening sequence has Cuca exploring a verdant forest, playing many tricks with ‘flat’ perspectives. It recalls the films of Ireland’s Tomm Moore (see p. 164), especially The Secret of Kells (2009). The visuals were mostly created by Aberu alone, though with about twenty assistants who finalised the drawings.\n\n33\n\n17/02/2022 11:08\n\nThe Breadwinner Ireland/Canada/Luxemborg, 2017 – 94 minutes Nora Twomey [Drawings] DIRECTOR Nora Twomey PRODUCER Paul Young, Tomm\n\nMoore, Anthony Leo, Andrew Rosen, Stephen Roelants STORY Deborah Elllis SCORE Mychael Danna,\n\nJeff Danna ANIMATION Andrzej Radka,\n\nGeoff King, Sean McCarron, Diane Coat\n\n34\n\n100_Animated_Features_NewEdn.indd 34\n\nHollywood cartoon studios rarely depict real-world war; nor do they usually show people in oppressive real regimes. But there are exceptions. In a remarkable Disney propaganda cartoon, Education for Death (1943), an innocent German boy has his soul destroyed by the Nazi machine. At the end, he joins ranks of goose-stepping German soldiers (‘heiling and marching, marching and heiling’, pronounces the voiceover), dissolving into an image of a war cemetery. The first Hollywood cartoon feature to do anything similar was 1986’s An America Tail by Don Bluth (see p. 150). In it, the mice characters plainly stand for persecuted Jews, anticipating Art Spiegelman’s strip, Maus. American Tail kept its allegory implicit and its rodent cuteness extreme. It was a mainstream hit, though it dismayed the critic Roger Ebert, who called it ‘a tragic, gloomy story… written by people who want to prepare kids for the worst.’ Animators outside America dealt with such subjects directly. Sarah (1982) was an Australian cartoon by Yoram Gross (Dot and the Kangaroo), about a refugee girl in World War II. Japanese kids saw more horrific cartoons about the same war, often at school: 1983’s Barefoot Gen, about Hiroshima, and 1988’s Grave of the Fireflies*, about starving children. Amusingly, Ebert championed Fireflies as ‘an emotional experience so powerful that it forces a rethinking of animation.’ What Ebert saw as too gloomy for American animation, he deemed art when it came from Japan. The 2000s saw two acclaimed animated films about newer conflicts. France’s Persepolis* (2007) could be cal"
