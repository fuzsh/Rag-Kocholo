For a while, I'd heard of Robert McKimson's "Birth of a Notion" but never seen it. Until now. What a treat! In this one, Daffy eschews flying south for the winter, opting instead for staying in a house. The only problem: he chooses a house occupied by a sarcastic dog and a Peter Lorre-resembling mad scientist! What I found really interesting wasn't necessarily the plot or characters - although there were certainly some funny ones - but the setting. The house seems more like the sort of dwelling that belongs in an Indiana Jones movie! As Daffy puts it: "The only thing missing is a pair of hands coming out of the wall...like those up there." The dog, meanwhile, breaks the fourth wall, complaining about the lesser role that he's gotten in the cartoon. I actually thought that the voices of both the dog and the scientist sounded like Vito Corleone in "The Godfather".

All in all, this is one of the many classic cartoons from the Termite Terrace crowd. There will probably never be another cartoon series like this in our lifetime. I definitely recommend it.
