        "text": "Disney executives “wouldn’t change a thing” about “Camp Rock” — except who played the leading lady.\n\nSelena Gomez’s on-screen dad claims the former Disney Channel star turned down the role that eventually made Demi Lovato a household name.\n\nDavid DeLuise, who played Gomez’s father in “Wizards of Waverly Place,” said the character of Mitchie Torres in “Camp Rock” was originally offered to the “My Mind and Me” documentary star.\n\n“I’ve never really said this story but they offered Camp Rock to Selena … and she knew that if she passed on it, Demi would get the part,” the actor, 50, revealed in a resurfaced clip from his 2020 interview on the “Wildchat Sports” podcast.\n\n“So, she passed on it, which was very nice to do,” he continued, noting that the former child stars were close friends at the time. “And they were friends. They were on the show Barney together.”\n\nThe 2008 film, which also starred the Jonas Brothers, was released one year after Gomez, 30, secured her big break as Alex Russo in “Wizards of Waverly Place.”\n\nLovato’s career, however, was yet to reach the same heights, and DeLuise appeared to be suggesting that Gomez was giving Lovato’s career a nudge.\n\nThe “Skyscraper” singer’s turn in the Disney Channel Original film was swiftly followed up by a sequel, “Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,” her own TV show, “Sonny With A Chance,” and a recording contract with Hollywood Records.\n\nFans were divided over the revelation, which came back to light when the “Wildchat Sports” podcast shared a clip to TikTok on Monday.\n\n“that’s so sweet,” one fan wrote, while another commented, “Selena is such a great friend.”\n\nOthers were quick to point out they couldn’t imagine anyone besides Lovato, 30, in the role.\n\n“Demi ate it up tho,” one person commented.\n\n“Demi’s vocals were made for that movie,” another fan wrote under the podcast clip, while a third person chimed in, “I love them both, but I can’t picture anyone other than Demi to play Mitchie!!!!”\n\nThe two Texas natives slowly drifted apart over the years, with Lovato admitting in 2020 that the pair were no longer friends.\n\n“When you grow up with somebody, you’re always going to have love for them. But I’m not friends with her,” she said in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar at the time.\n\n“I will always have love for her, and I wish everybody nothing but the best.”"
