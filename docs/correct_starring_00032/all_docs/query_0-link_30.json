        "text": "On top of that mini-reunion at this year's Vanity Fair Oscars after party brought back a lot of memories, Joe Jonas is here to help rekindle our hopes for a Camp Rock.\n\nThat's right, the DNCE frontman recently told Marie Claire that if he had things his way, a reunion would definitely be in the cards.\n\n\"If it made sense, sure. For all of us — Demi, Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it,\" he said. \"Do the graduating days, make it kind of dark. An adult film. Well, not an adult film. An R-rated film. We've joked around about the idea a couple times.\"\n\nIt's not exactly what you'd expect, but there's no denying that an on-screen reunion between the three of them and (hopefully) their oldest brother Kevin would be everything. And with nostalgia making a full-on TV comeback via Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life and Fuller House, we vote for a reboot of the trio's camp classic next! At this point, it's your move, Disney or perhaps Netflix.\n\nRelated: Joe Jonas Has Some Harsh Words for His Camp Rock Performance\n\nCheck this out:\n\nPolitics\n\nWhat Are Democrats Going to Do About Joe Biden?\n\nAfter a disastrous debate performance, there are real questions about finding a new nominee.\n\nPolitics\n\nInside the History of State Suppression of Abortion in the U.S.\n\nCommon pregnancy outcomes, like miscarriage and stillbirths, are now potential criminal offenses.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe Crackdown on the Stop Cop City Movement Is a Warning Sign\n\nStop Cop City protesters are being charged with domestic terrorism."
