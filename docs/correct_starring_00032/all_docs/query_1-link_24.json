The Jonas Brothers originally started as an attempted solo singing career for Nick, but the record producer liked the sound when his brothers sang backup for him.It has been said that the Jonas Brothers originally called themselves Sons of Jonas. He previously starred in the Disney Channel original series JONAS L.A. as Nick Lucas, alongside his brothers. He also starred in the Disney Channel original movie Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. He formed the band Nick Jonas & The Administration, which released its only studio album in 2010.\n\n\"Live like your at the bottom even when you're at the top.\"-Nick\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nNick was born in Dallas, Texas, on September 16, 1992. He is the son of Denise (née Miller) and Paul Kevin Jonas. Jonas' father is a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God church while his mother is a former sign language teacher and singer. Nick has two older brothers, Kevin Jonas, and Joe Jonas, and one younger brother, Frankie Jonas.\n\nCareer[]\n\nCareer beginnings: 2000-2005[]\n\nJonas's career started when he was discovered at the age of six in a barbershop, while his mother was getting her hair cut and was referred to a professional show business manager. At the age of 7, he began performing on Broadway. He had acted in several plays, including A Christmas Carol (in 2000 as Tiny Tim and Scrooge at eight), Annie Get Your Gun (in 2001 as Little Jake), Beauty and the Beast (in 2002 as Chip), and Les Misérables (in 2003 as Gavroche). After Les Misérables closed, he performed in The Sound of Music (as Kurt) at the Paper Mill Playhouse.&nbsp {C In 2002, while performing in Beauty and the Beast, Jonas wrote a song with his father called \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer).\" With background vocals from the Beauty and the Beast cast, Nick recorded the song on the 2002 annual Broadway \"Equity Fights AIDS\" album, Broadway's Greatest Gifts: Carols for a Cure, Vol. 4. In November 2003, INO Records received a demo copy of \"Joy To The World (A Christmas Prayer)\". The label released the song to Christian radio, where it quickly became popular on Record & Radio's Christian Adult Contemporary Chart. By September 2004, an executive at Columbia Records discovered Jonas' song. He was soon jointly signed to INO Records and Columbia Records and released the single \"Dear God\". A second single, \"Joy to the World (A Christmas Prayer)\" (a re-recorded version), was released on November 16. It was supposed to be followed by a December release of a self-titled solo album Nicholas Jonas, but the album was pushed back. It did, however, get a limited release. Nick, along with his brothers, Kevin and Joe, co-wrote songs for the album. In early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, heard Jonas' record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. &nbsp {C Jonas Brothers: 2005-2010 {C Main article: Jonas Brothers {C After meeting with Jonas and hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine\", written and performed by the brothers, Daylight/Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group activity.
