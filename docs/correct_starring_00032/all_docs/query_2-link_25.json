I really expected more from the JoBros, because I like them a lot. But...no...I was mistaken. The dialogue sucked, the acting sucked, the characters sucked, there was never any rock...I won't even try to say how much I hated it.\n\nSo? Has anyone else seen it?\n\nI could have told you that...\n\nI really hate the genre that the Jonas Brothers sing, and to be honest, I hate their music...\n\nStill I respect them for making it so far...\n\n^^^^^\n\nThats what I thought before camp rock...\n\nIt seemed like a HSM rip-off to me...and I have to say, HSM...*eye twitches, almost kills self*\n\nwas better.\n\nI saw it because I was kind of curious but that storyline is so over-uused:\n\nA girl who wants to be popular but she doesn't succeed because she is different and in the end,she's the kewlest gurl around evar!! and enemies change their mind drastically and is friends with the kewlest gurl aroundz and she gets the HAWT guyz and is accepted by everybody .\n\nYeah,I'm really tired of that plot :I but I agree with Sab,the songs are kind of catchy.\n\nNick Jonas,I'd tap that. (Yes,I am ashamed)\n\nWow, you guys really thought it was that bad? Okay, sure, the storyline was a little... overused. But I thought it was a pretty good movie, nonetheless. I've been waiting for it to come out for quite a while now and I saw it on the day it came out. Even though it wasn't rock, I still really liked the music (I'll listen to almost anything ^^) And the acting was pretty good. It got me laughing at some points, even.\n\nAll in all, I really liked this movie... ^^ Mitchie's song is now stuck in my head and has been for three or four days now... lol...\n\nAnd also... I <3 Nick... :3\n\nIt really wasn't as good. The songs...didn't catch on for me honestly. Except the one that girl sang on the Piano and then one of them Jonas bros sang it on the guitar. I think his name's Joe...lol. I don't know their names and all that.\n\nIt could've been better, and overused plot. It...seemed like one of those old typical Disney Channel movies. Nothing big =\\"
