        "text": "In June 2008, Disney Channel released Camp Rock just in time to get the kids pumped up for summer! The DCOM starred the then-rulers of Disney Channel, Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers. Yes, all three Jonas Brothers, Nick, Joe and Kevin. Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) is an aspiring singer-songwriter who is a little shy, but has always dreamed of going to Camp Rock. Mitchie’s family can’t afford to send her to the prestigious music camp, so her mom (played by Wizards of Waverly Place’s Maria Canals Barrera) takes a job at the summer camp as their caterer, but in order to attend the camp with her mom, Mitchie must help out in the kitchen. Enter Shane Gray, played by Joe Jonas. Shane is an already famous front man for a musical group of brothers called Connect 3 (can you guess who the other two members are?). He’s let fame get to his head and is not excited to be an instructor at the camp he was sent to in order to get rid of his attitude. All caught up? So what exactly makes this camp better than your average summer camp? Well, you’re about to find out.\n\nJoe Jonas teaches your classes\n\nYeah, he really does. He teaches campers all about being a performer, including a hip hop dance class which includes some microphone handling. It really is kind of cute, but not very good. Horribly entertaining to watch, though.\n\nYou get to hear ‘Connect 3’ perform what is probably one of my favorite Jonas songs ever.\n\nYou have Demi Lovato as a BFF…\n\nYou get to dance with Alyson Stoner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Jonas Brothers are around, literally all the time.\n\nYou get to look at Joe Jonas’ atrocious hair EVERY.DAY. You’re welcome.\n\nYou don’t have to deal with the summer heat too much…\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeedless to say, we can all agree that Camp Rock is every Demi/Jonas fangirl’s dream camp. I mean, where do I sign up? I don’t mind Joe’s bad hair days all that much."
