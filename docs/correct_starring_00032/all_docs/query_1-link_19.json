        "text": "Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam will forever be beloved Disney Channel Original Movies. They introduced the world to the gem that is Demi Lovato, and brought about her wonderful friendships with Joe Jonas and Nick Jonas, so you know, we're eternally grateful. And Camp Rock just turned 10 years old, which is so beyond wild to believe. Joe even took to Twitter to let everyone know his true thoughts about the drama that went down in the sequel.\n\nSame Joe, same. Clearly two DCOMs simply weren't enough for fans or even the cast though. Whatever happened to Shane and Mitchie's love story? Is Connect 3 still going strong as a band? Did Camp Rock stay open after almost not having enough campers to continue? So. Many. Questions.\n\nWell, in an interview with Marie Claire, Joe had spoken about a possible Camp Rock 3 movie and he basically confirmed the OG squad would be down for another one — and Demi did the same.\n\n\"If it made sense, sure. For all of us — Demi, Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it. Do the graduating days, make it kinda dark… We've joked around about the idea a couple times,\" Joe said.\n\nOK, let us just process the fact that Joe, Demi and Nick talk about Camp Rock when they're hanging out.\n\nJoe did say in the past that he was slightly embarrassed of his dance moves, singing voice and overall look in both classic DCOMs, but clearly he wouldn't mind revisiting this era.\n\nAfter the DNCE singer's big reveal, Demi also confirmed that she wants another Camp Rock movie. When Entertainment Tonight asked the pop star about the possibility, she spilled that she actually came up with the concept herself.\n\n\"[It was] my idea! My idea! Yes, and we're totally gonna do it…It's going to happen,\" she said.\n\nAnd when the \"Confident\" singer just stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show, she once again said that she, Joe and Nick are completely on board with making this new movie, except it's definitely not going to air on Disney Channel like the first two. Demi admitted their aim is to create a more grown-up version that would be rated R.\n\n\"We want to come out with a R-rated Camp Rock 3. All of our fans have now grown up, and so anybody who watched Camp Rock is older and can appreciate [this new] version,\" Demi explained. Hmm, we can't help but wonder if this was the concept she already had in mind all the way back in 2014 when she took to Twitter to let Kevin Jonas know not only that she missed and loved him, but that she had an amazing idea he had to hear about.\n\nPerhaps this version of Camp Rock has been brewing for quite some time and we just didn't even know about it! And while Demi and her former co-stars might've moved on from their TV musical days, the songstress proved the movie will always mean something to her when she was asked to pick between CR and her role on Barney & Friends.\n\n\"Definitely Camp Rock. There's at least some sort of substance. Barney was fun, but the songs and the dancing – it was just too much,\" she explained to Rolling Stone. Fair enough, that means it wins in our hearts. So what does Kevin think about this? Well, he made it clear that this more scandalous version of a movie is something they were all about, but might just be an idea that stays forever in our hearts, although the OG stars still seem to be totally game for it.\n\n\"We talked about it for a minute doing something ridiculous like an R-rated version now in our life, like a going back to camp kind of thing,\" Kevin said to E! News. \"It just has to be the right thing. I can't believe 10 years has actually passed. It makes me feel like I'm getting old. [But] never say never.\"\n\nAdding more fuel to the CR 3 fire was when an official IMDB page appeared, listing the television movie for a 2019 release and a cast list that included Demi, Joe, Kevin, Roshon Fegan — who played Sander — and Daniel Fathers, who played Brown, the director/owner of the camp.\n\nCUE MAJOR FREAKOUT.\n\nNow just because there is a page up on IMDB about the movie, this doesn't actually mean the movie is 100 percent going to happen, which is obvious. Anyone can edit this page, meaning people who don't have any real authority on the project, and it has Walt Disney Television as the production company, something that is highly doubtful to happen since the cast wants this movie to have a much darker tone to it. Plus, Joe and his DNCE band members caught up with J-14, and Joe admitted everyone would love to do the movie, if their schedules allow it, so right now nothing is planned. He would, of course, need to have his bandmates in the movie too.\n\n\"The movie couldn't happen without them [DNCE]. If it happened. I think as of right now it's just talking about it. We think it could be really fun to do it and play on the movie in some way. If there was a universe where everyone's schedule lined up we could do it. As of right now, we're all pretty busy,\" Joe said.\n\nSo what about Nick? Well, he's all about this new movie too, as long it stays loyal to the fans who love it so much.\n\n\"If the right thing comes together, I think that’d be fun,\" he said to People. \"It’s a really delicate thing because [they’re two films] really beloved by fans. So I think for it to work, it’d have to be some creative new version where we get a writing team and do something special. But I absolutely love working with Demi and my brothers.\"\n\nThe JoBros back on-screen with their BFF Demi again? We are here for it. Nothing is set in stone quite yet, so it's safe to say this IMDB page might just be a bit ahead of itself. This is not the first time Joe has teased fans about a possible reboot though. Just last month, he shared a stunning selfie along with Demi and simply wrote, \"CR3?\" in the caption.\n\nThat photo nearly sent everyone into a total freak out because Joe and Demi not only look amazing together, but it really gave a glimpse into what a new CR movie could look like. Since the main stars are all grown up now, it would be interesting to see how exactly their \"darker\" take on the movie would be, but we have a feeling they wouldn't mind breaking out the guitars for a \"Gotta Find You/This Is Me\" performance again, since they performed it a few times together. The new and improved music that would come out of this musical would be nothing short of legendary too. OK Joe and Demi, you've got our vote so time to get this movie going.\n\nBut these two aren't the only ones who are down for another one. Chloe Bridges, who CR fans know as Dana, exclusively told M Magazine she would be interested in reprising her role.\n\n\"I would do it. I mean, realistically is it going to happen, I don't know but hey if that's a thing we're throwing around and talking about — sure,\" she told us.\n\nFellow Disney Channel alum Alyson Stoner who played Caitlyn in the movies, chimed into this long-standing conversation as well by writing a message alongside a throwback clip of her iconic \"and you're watching Disney Channel\" commercial on Instagram.\n\n\"Because Camp Rock 3, right? #bangleonmybicep #camprock3 #areyousureyouwantthat,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nActress Arisa Cox, who played the role of Georgina Farlow in Camp Rock 2, is also simply waiting on the call.\n\nWelp, this is looking like more and more of a reality, maybe one day. Time will tell, that's for sure, but it's nice to know no one is too cool for a reunion.\n\nThis post was originally published on March 7, 2017 and has since been updated."
