        "text": "The stage musical, which will include songs from the two Disney Channel \"Camp Rock\" original movies and a story based on \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam,\" will be available for professional, school and community theatre stagings through a special agreement between Disney Theatrical Productions and licensing company Music Theatre International. This partnership also brought about the Disney Channel movie-inspired High School Musical: On Stage and High School Musical 2. Camp Rock: The Musical will feature a book by Faye Greenberg and Robert Freedman (adapted from the teleplay by Dan Berendsen, Karen Gist and Regina Hicks). David Lawrence will adapt, orchestrate and produce the score, which will consist of four songs from \"Camp Rock\" (which premiered on the Disney Channel in 2008) and ten from \"Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam\" (which will debut Sept. 3).\n\n\"This summer at camp was supposed to be all about the music and having the time of their lives,\" according to press notes. \"But the new, flashy Camp Star across the lake now threatens Camp Rock's very existence. To keep the doors open, Mitchie steps up, rallies her fellow Camp Rockers, and gets them into top shape for the ultimate showdown! This new musical based on the hit Disney Channel original movie 'Camp Rock' and upcoming 'Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam' will fire up your stage with over a dozen songs, including 'This Is Me,' 'Can't Back Down,' 'It's On' and 'We Rock.'\"\n\nFor more information visit disneymusicals.com or mtishows.com."
