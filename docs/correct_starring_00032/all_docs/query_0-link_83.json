In recent years, though, the two seem to have largely been out of touch.\n\nJoe continued the DCOM theme with his costume, which was Paolo from The Lizzie McGuire Movie â€” alongside Sophie Turner as Isabella.\n\nThe party everyone was at was, unsurprisingly, a star-studded affair, with Ashley Benson and Paris Hilton also in attendance.\n\nI guess this is a sign I should stay in and watch DCOM movies...?\n\nShare This Article"
