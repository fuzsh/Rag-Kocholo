After Joe Jonas starred in Disney Channelâ€™s Camp Rock films, the singer got to see plenty of dolls representing his character Shane Gray on toy shelves everywhere. However, the singer noticed that Barbie also took inspiration from Shane.

Jonas took to Twitter to post a striking resemblance between a Barbie character named Ryan and the Jonas Brother himself back in the days when he straightened his hair. The similarities between the two are creepy.

The Twittersphere exploded with humor over the comparison, and fans commented everything from identity theft jokes to all the scenes imaginable from the Camp Rock films. See their reactions below.
