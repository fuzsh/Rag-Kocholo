About

Joe Jonas rose to fame alongside his brothers Nick and Kevin, forming the Jonas Brothers in 2005. The trio became Disney Channel icons after starring in two Camp Rock movies and on their own show titled Jonas.

The Jonas Brothers went on hiatus in 2011, and Jonas released his debut solo album, Fastlife. He later formed the dance-rock band DNCE with his friends JinJoo Lee, Jack Lawless and Cole Whittle, dropping “Cake by the Ocean” in 2015. The Jonas Brothers eventually reunited, going on to release Happiness Begins in 2019 and The Album in 2023.

Jonas dated Taylor Swift in 2008 and Demi Lovato in 2010. He was romantically linked to Ashley Greene, Blanda Eggenschwiler and Gigi Hadid before he married Sophie Turner in 2019. The couple welcomed daughters Willa and Delphine in 2020 and 2022, respectively, before Jonas filed for divorce in 2023.
