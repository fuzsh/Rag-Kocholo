An 88th-minute goal by the substitute Leandro Tatu earned the bottom club in Group E, Steaua Bucharest, a 1-1 home draw against Basel and a first point at the National Arena on Tuesday.

Basel took the lead three minutes after the interval when the Chilean midfielder Marcelo Diaz gave the goalkeeper, Ciprian Tatarusanu, no chance with a delightful curling shot from outside the area after a blunder by Iasmin Latovlevici.

The Swiss club, who beat Chelsea in their opening game, are now third in the group with four points, two behind Jose Mourinho's team and Schalke 04.
