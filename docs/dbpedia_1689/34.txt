BUCHAREST (Reuters) - An 88th-minute goal by substitute Leandro Tatu salvaged a 1-1 home draw for bottom club Steaua Bucharest in their Champions League Group E match against Basel at the National Arena on Tuesday.

Basel had taken the lead in the 48th minute when Chilean midfielder Marcelo Diaz gave keeper Ciprian Tatarusanu no chance with a delightful curling shot from outside the area after a blunder by Iasmin Latovlevici.
