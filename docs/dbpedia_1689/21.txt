Good team. Now we can hope only for 3 rd place. The next match it's crucial.

Well, I was not amused about the 88th minute equalizer, although I think you might have a different notion there

Murat Yakin made the same mistake he did in other matches that went wrong - he decided to sub in more defensive players. And as one could expect it was Arlind Ajeti who just came on in the 87th minute who lost the player he should have looked after and so the goal happened.

I'm really looking forward to that match, although I'm a bit torn - I would have loved both Basel and Schalke to proceed, and now one of them will miss out

Re: FC Basel

by rwo power Sun Feb 02, 2014 11:36 pm

Swiss Raiffeisen Super League is back after the winter break, and FC Basel is back in action after the loss of Mohamed Salah to Chelsea FC and the loan (with option to buy) of Marek Suchy from Spartak Moskau. As you can see, Basel kept up with their habit of signing mainly players whose names start with either "S" or "D".

Wow Suchy at Basel, huh. Intresting.

Surprised to see that Stocker is still at Basel. I thought he would've been playing at the Bundesliga by now.

Re: FC Basel

by rwo power Thu Feb 06, 2014 8:10 pm

Well, Basel have no need to sell, so they usually ask a healthy price for players with a still valid contract. I assume that in summer they might lose several players (Valentin Stocker, Fabian Schär and Yann Sommer), though.

Oh, by the way - Basel won their Swiss Cup match against Le Mont 6:1. Germano Vailati was in goal as usual for the most Cup matches. ^^

Re: FC Basel

by Lord Awesome Thu Feb 06, 2014 8:27 pm

Basel just seem to win everthing nawadays in the Swiss Tournaments. They're starting to remind me of Lyon in the past decade. Defo a big club ATM.

Almost forgot about Sommer. Where would he go if he leaves this summer?

Re: FC Basel

by rwo power Thu Feb 06, 2014 9:18 pm

How could you forget about the cutest goalie ever?

Well, I hope that he'll go to Borussia Mönchengladbach. The coach is Lucien Favre, his former team mate Granit Xhaka is already there and it is BMG who are interested in Schär and Stocker, too.
