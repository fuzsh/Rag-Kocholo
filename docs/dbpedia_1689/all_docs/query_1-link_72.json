        "text": "KARL HEIN - 6: The Estonian started in top form with a wonder save from Amad, but he looked to be at fault for Hojlund’s near post opener.\n\nBEN WHITE - 6: Relatively quiet game for Arsenal’s ever-reliable right-back. That is not a bad thing – just means he did is job effectively and did not make any mistakes.\n\nAYDEN HEAVEN - 5: Another solid overall display by the teenager. May come in for criticism when he is older if he lets Hojlund burn past him to score, but he simply is not big enough or strong enough yet.\n\nJURRIEN TIMBER - 7: The Dutch defender was billed as the answer to their left-back problems, but it looks like he can play anywhere and play anywhere well too.\n\nOLEKSANDR ZINCHENKO - 6: The versatile Ukraine man was back on the left hand side of defence, having started as a sub against Bournemouth in midweek, and looked much improved and fitter going forward.\n\nJORGINHO - 6: Rarely puts a foot wrong and made the most of his chance to get some minutes under his belt after not starting the midweek match against Bournemouth. Took time to look after Heaven after his error for United’s opening goal.\n\nETHAN NWANERI - 8: Once again showed that he is the kid to watch at Arsenal. The Premier League’s youngster ever player when he was 15 is now so much better and stronger at 17. Looked more than at home against United’s more established stars.\n\nMARTIN ODEGAARD - 6: Clearly fitter than most having missed the Euros after Norway’s failure to qualify. The Arsenal skipper once again showed his leadership qualities on and off the ball.\n\nLEANDRO TROSSARD - 6: The versatile Belgium forward has sussed that Arteta likes players who work very hard for the team and then have some stardust talent to sprinkle on top. He showed a bit of both on the night, without doing anything spectacular.\n\nREISS NELSON - 6: No faulting his effort playing in the Bukayo Saka on the right hand side of the Arsenal attack, but he will have to do more to prove he can fill on for the England international on a regular basis when the season starts.\n\nGABRIEL JESUS - 7: Fit again, for now at least, he is making the most of a restful summer after missing out on selection for Brazil’s Copa America campaign. A menace to the United backline and took his goal well.\n\nSUBSTITUTIONS\n\nJAKUB KIWIOR - 6: Came on for Heaven at half-time and Arsenal instantly looked more secure at the back\n\nSALAH-EDDINE OULAD M'HAND - 6: Looked so comfortable as another half-time introduction – for the impressive Nwaneri.\n\nJOSH NICHOLS - 6: The pint-sized full back was one of five subs introduced during the second period after he seemed to struggle against Bournemouth last time out,\n\nMYLES LEWIS-SKELLY - 6: One of Arsenal’s big hopes for the future replaced Jorginho and did not look out of place in midfield.\n\nGABRIEL - 6: Big Gabi came on for his first pre-season appearance to try to make Arsenal more defensively secure. It worked.\n\nFABIO VIEIRA - 6: Replaced Trossard and played mainly on the right. Had a hand in Martinelli’s winner.\n\nTHOMAS PARTEY - 6: Again looked the part in midfield after coming on for Zinchenko.\n\nEDDIE NKETIAH - 6: Steady Eddie came on for Jesus but hardly had a touch.\n\nGABRIEL MARTINELLI - 8: Wasted no time impressing after taking over from Nelson. Some great runs down the wing and a well taken goal.\n\nKAI HAVERTZ - 6: Arsenal fans will be pleased to see their favourite German back in action and looking fit after a busy summer on international duty with his country."
