        "text": "Player Profile\n\nName\n\nMohamed Elneny\n\nSquad number\n\n25\n\nBorn\n\nJuly 11, 1992/El-Mahalla El-Kubra, Egypt\n\nHeight/weight\n\n179cm/72kg\n\nArsenal debut\n\nv Burnley (h), FA Cup, January 30, 2016 (won 2-1)\n\nFirst goal\n\nv Barcelona (a), Champions League, March 16, 2016 (lost 3-1)\n\nPrevious clubs\n\nEl Mokawloon, FC Basel, Besiktas (loan)\n\nTwitter\n\n@ElNenny\n\nLast season was a tough one for experienced campaigner Mo, who had started the campaign with high hopes after producing some commanding displays in the middle of the park – notably in successive victories over Chelsea and Manchester United – towards the end of 2021/22 and signing a contract extension last summer. Sadly he was able to make just eight appearances and score one goal, in the 3-0 win over Oxford United in the FA Cup third round, before sustaining a knee injury in January that ended his season early.\n\nThe gifted midfielder, who is tidy in possession and adept at keeping the ball moving, is one of the longest-serving players in the squad, having signed from Swiss side Basel in January 2016, and he has twice won our Goal of the Season awards, in 2016/17 and 2020/21, for super strikes against Barcelona and Dundalk respectively.\n\nHe collected four league titles during his time in Switzerland, having started his career with Egyptian side Al Mokawloon.\n\nHe has long been a key player for his country and was a standout performer at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations – helping Egypt reach the final, being named in the tournament’s Best XI and receiving a nomination for the 2021/22 CAF Men’s Player of the Year."
