        "text": "SEVILLA FC vs FC BAYERN MUNICH\n\nKEY INFO:\n\n1st Leg: 03/04/18 @ Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan\n\n2nd Leg: 11/04/18 @ The Allianz Arena\n\nThe first of our four quarter final clashes begin on Tuesday as Sevilla and Bayern Munich go head to head for the first time in their respective histories. The two club’s could not have had a different weekend, with Bayern Munich dismantling Borussia Dortmund 6-0 at the Allianz Arena, while Sevilla took a shock 2-0 lead at home to Barcelona, only to see Lionel Messi, and Luis Suarez steal a late point for the de-facto La Liga champions. Had Sevilla inflicted Barcelona’s first defeat of the league season, I might very well been have writing that a potential upset, at least in the first leg, may have been on the cards. Alas, despite the conquering of Manchester United in the round of 16, Sevilla will be nothing short of underdog’s against the 5 time European Champions. Vincenzo Montella is a polarizing figure to say the least; his resume includes 3 successive 4th place finishes while in charge of Fiorentina, Europa League semi-final finish with Fiorentina back in the 2014-15 season, a Supercoppa Italiana win with Milan over Juventus last season, as well as steering the club to their highest league finish since the 2012-13 season. His brief time at Sevilla has already seen his team secure a Copa del Rey final place alongside Barcelona, while defeating Atletico Madrid home and away at the quarter final stage, not to mention the fine elimination of Manchester United that included a 2-1 win at Old Trafford which has consequently led Sevilla to the Champions League quarter final for the first time in their history. Those accomplishments however only go on to mask how poor Milan were at times last season, and in honesty, their 6th place finish came more as a result of how poor Inter Milan, and Fiorentina were at the climax of the season. Additionally, his spell at Sampdoria entirely forgettable, while spats with key personnel, and poor decision making with substitutes have also long been a trademark of the former Italian front man during his managerial career. While Sevilla’s unlikely title charge last season, was ended well before the round of 30; Montella’s side are some 12 points shy of the points total they accumulated at the same juncture last season, furthermore, the Andalusian side are some 13 points adrift of the last Champions League place in La Liga, so unless Sevilla win this season’s tournament, they will likely not be playing Champions League football next season. Still with that being said, Sevilla find themselves in the quarter final of the Champions League for the first time in its current format, and although the stature of the clubs will suggest it was an upset; to the contrary Sevilla’s elimination of Manchester United was thoroughly deserved. The first leg at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan ended 0-0 on February 21st, however the story of the fixture was David De Gea, and yet another spectacular performance from the Manchester United shot-stopper as his spectacular save denied Luis Muriel what seemed a sure fire goal. The return leg at Old Trafford a fortnight later looked set to be the 2017 Europa League winner’s coming out party, however the pre-match would be dominated by Paul Pogba’s place on the bench. Wissam Ben Yedder who was kept on the bench, would be introduced on the 72nd minute mark, and within 6 minutes of his arrival, he would have a brace to his name as Sevilla led 2-0 with less than 15 minutes to play! Romelu Lukaku would pull a goal back, but it was hardly a volcano of pressure aimed at the Sevilla goal; in fact Ben Yedder should have had a hat-trick! Nevertheless, Sevilla would prevail, and even if their European adventure ends at this juncture, that night at Old Trafford will live on eternally in the club’s history…\n\nLike Sevilla, Bayern would of course change managers earlier this season and Jupp Heynckes picked up exactly where he left off in 2013, with his team now just a matter 2 games away from winning the Bundesliga for a 7th straight season, not to mention having a DFB-Pokal semi-final and a favourable Champions League quarter final draw to look forward too. Their 6-0 destruction of Borussia Dortmund just underlining how far off the pace any of their contemporaries are in the German top flight. Back in Heynckes’ last spell in charge, Jurgen Klopp and Borussia Dortmund were out of sight be match-day 28 as their 20 point lead at the top ensured Bayern were league champions by April 4th. This time however, they may have to wait until the round of 30, at home to Borussia Monchengladbach on April 14th. Last season, Bayern took on the defending European Champions: Real Madrid at the stage of the last 8 in the Champions League, and a 2-1 defeat at home to the Spanish side all but condemned Bayern to a an early exit from the tournament. The 2 sides would engage in a war of attrition in the second leg, with Bayern winning 2-1 after 90 minutes, however an Arturo Vidal dismissal would pave the way for Real Madrid to win 4-2 after extra time. Luckily for the Bavarian side, Sevilla find themselves more in the bracket of previous last 8 opponents: Olympique de Marseille, FC Porto, and Benfica, rather than Manchester United, Juventus and Real Madrid, and as long as the German champions do not overlook their opponents, they should likely be in the last 4 for the 6th time this decade. There should be no shortage of confidence on Bayern’s part either, having disposed of Besiktas in the last round by an 8-1 aggregate score! Respective braces from: Thomas Muller, and Robert Lewandowski, along with a Kingsley Coman effort ensured that Bayern had the tie wrapped up in the 1st leg, as they destroyed the Turkish champions 5-0 at the Allianz Arena. At the Vodafone Park on March 14th, Bayern Munich would prevail 3-1 in what was the formalities of an already forgone conclusion.\n\nOne omen that will be in Sevilla’s favour shall be Bayern’s horrible record against Spanish opposition in the knockout stages since winning the Champions League in 2013; after disposing of Real Madrid, and the Barcelona in the 2012, and then 2013 semi-final’s, Bayern have since been eliminated in the European Cup by Spanish opposition in the each of the four season’s since that season (Real Madrid 2014, Barcelona 2015, Atletico Madrid 2016, Real Madrid 2017). Additionally, we cannot discount that Sevilla did win the Europa League 3 times in row between 2014-2016, and in defeating Manchester United in the last round, they defeated the team who won the 2017 Europa League title! Interestingly, while Wissam Ben Yedder is Sevilla’s top scorer this season with 18 strikes in all competitions, he only has 6 to his name in La Liga, while the 8 he has registered in Europe this term places only Cristiano Ronaldo above him in the top goal scorer’s chart. Furthermore, we saw in the elimination of Manchester United that when given space and time with the ball; Ever Banega is as good as anyone in the world in his position, while Joaquin Correa was a menace that tormented Antonio Valencia and a very immobile back line. If he can conjure a similar performance against the likes of Rafinha, and a notoriously slow Bayern centre back pairing, Sevilla will certainly get chances to score. Unfortunately for Sevilla, Bayern, unlike Manchester United, are not lacking in a defined set up, system, plan, or motivation; to the contrary, Bayern Munich are very much the antithesis of ‘The Red Devils’; unified, organised, confident, fluid, and on a mission, the German giants are not lacking in identity, nor in confidence, and they will likely very much make of Sevilla every inch of the underdog’s that the bookmakers have them as coming into this last 8 clash.\n\nThe first leg of this clash emanates from the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Tuesday, where the proprietors have only lost once in European competition since November 2016, and just 4 times since March 2014 in both the Europa League and Champions League combined. Adversaries during this time have included: FC Porto, Valencia, Real Madrid, Borussia Monchengladbach, Villarreal, Barcelona, Zenit Saint Petersburg, Fiorentina, Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk, Lyon, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool, and Manchester United in both league and European competition, so there is an excellent pedigree of whom Sevilla have held their own against in recent years. On that same token however, Sevilla had to come from 3-0 down to salvage an unlikely 3-3 draw against Liverpool, not to mention receiving 5-3, and 5-2 humbling’s against Real Betis, and Atletico Madrid respectively this season. Impressively, in 20 competitive games against German opposition, Sevilla have only lost 3 times; Bayern Munich however will bring with them a different level of intensity, and quality; hitherto seen amongst their peers in the Bundesliga. Jupp Heynckes’s side have lost just once in 2018, and you would have to go back to April 26th 2017 to recall the last time that ‘Die Rotten’ lost a game at home. Moreover, in Robert Lewandowski, Bayern have one of the most in-form striker’s in world football at their disposal, and to put the Pole’s goal threat into perspective; he has 23 league goals, while Sevilla as a club have scored just 39 in La Liga. Even without ‘Lewy’ in the starting line-up, Bayern were still able to brush Besiktas aside 3-1 in Turkey! With all of the above in mind then, I am going to suggest that the German champions claim a 2-1 triumph at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan on Tuesday. Sevilla will then have a fixture away to Celta Vigo to come on April 7th, while Bayern meet Augsburg on the same date. The Celta fixture will likely propose more difficulty for Sevilla, than Augsburg will for Bayern; in fact, do not be surprised to see an altered Bayern take the field on April 7th, before finishing the job off at the Allianz Arena on April 11th in the form of a 2-0 win, and ultimately a 4-1 aggregate triumph to take their place amongst the semi-final of this season’s UEFA Champions League.\n\nJUVENTUS vs REAL MADRID\n\nKEY INFO:\n\n1st Leg: 03/04/18 @ The Allianz Stadium\n\n2nd Leg: 11/04/18 @ Santiago Bernabeu\n\nFor the 3rd time in the last 4 seasons, we have a repeat of the previous season’s Champions League final in the knockout stages; as a mouth watering clash of European superpowers take place between: Juventus and Real Madrid! Ordinarily, I would have used this entry to go over the prestigious history of this fixture, however this was explored in some incredible depth ahead of the 2017 Champions League final last June, and you can read all of that here:\n\nhttps://aragami2236.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/origami-with-aragami-125-the-champions-league-final-preview/\n\nIn this preview, I will be reviewing the events of the Cardiff showcase leading to this 2-legged rematch, beginning on April 3rd…\n\nSo the day of destiny had finally dawned upon us! Under the closed roof of Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium; Gianluigi Buffon, and Sergio Ramos led out their respective outfits onto the field for the 2017 UEFA Champions League final. There were no surprise inclusions in either sides starting line-up; after being a doubt, Dani Carvajal had shaken off the knock he sustained in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final with Atletico Madrid, and Isco (as expected) was given the starting nod ahead of Gareth Bale, while Juventus went with their tried, and tested 3-4-3. The game’s opening exchanges while a tad cagey, did see Juventus emerge as the dominating force; preventing Toni Kroos, and Luka Modric from seeing much, if any of the ball, and starving the supply line to the Real Madrid front 3. In the black and white stripes of Juventus: Dani Alves, and Miralem Pjanic enjoyed plenty of possession, however bar a couple of Paulo Dybala dribbles, and a long range Gonzalo Higuain effort; Keylor Navas and the Real Madrid backline remained largely untroubled, even if the midfield battle was in the favour of their opponents. Needing 15 minutes or so to settle down, Real Madrid began to get into the game, and consequently, the game’s first goal was scored, as a fine interchange between Dani Carvajal, and Cristiano Ronaldo, ended with the Portuguese rifling home a fantastic first time hammer blow, that would deflect off of Leonardo Bonucci, before defying the outstretched arm of Buffon to give Real Madrid the lead. With that goal, Ronaldo would join Lionel Messi on 11 Champions League strikes this season, and for the 5th meeting in a row, find a way past Buffon in the Juventus goal, with his record against the Italian champions now standing at 6 goals in 5 meetings. The goal would not perturb Max Allegri’s side, and in a fantastic display of aerial ball control; Alex Sandro would ping Bonucci’s cross at the chest of Gonzalo Higuain, before he cushioned the ball and tee’d up Mario Mandzukic who scored one of the greatest ever goals that the competition, let alone the final has ever seen. Controlling the ball on his chest facing Keylor Navas’ goal, he turned his back to goal, uncorking a stupendous volley with his right foot, which looped over the outstretched Navas to make it 1-1. With Real Madrid’s lead lasting just 7 minutes, Juventus once again resumed control of the contest leading into half-time, extracting bookings out of both: Sergio Ramos, and Dani Carvajal, while reducing the defending champions to just the 1 shot on target, as an excellent first half ended on level footing. Who knows what was said in each of the respective dressing rooms, however the second half was a story of total domination for 35 minutes in favour of Real Madrid, as they crusaded to the defence of their crown. Exhibiting the fatigue you would expect from a siege battle in the 70th minute; the Juventus game plan went to pot, as Real Madrid’s creative men (Isco, Toni Kroos, and Luka Modric) began to exhibit sound control of the contest. The breakthrough for Zinedine Zidane’s side came shortly after the hour mark when a long range effort from Casemiro took a wicked deflection off the foot of Sami Khedira to elude Buffon in the Juventus goal to make it 2-1. The dejection and despair was there for all to see on the faces of the Juventus charges, and in vintage Real Madrid style, they would add a quick-fire 3rd to all but end the contest. The best side in the world at doing this; Real Madrid this season have become the masters of smelling blood, and while Juventus were too busy feeling sorry for themselves, Real hunted more goals, and 4 minutes following Casemiro’s strike, Luka Modric would seize the ball at the by-line before delivering an inch perfect cross in the path of the oncoming Cristiano Ronaldo who steered the ball past Buffon to make it 3-1. With the tie all but lost, bookings would follow, with Miralem Pjanic’s 66th minute caution giving Allegri the chance to introduce Juan Cuadrado in place of Andrea Barzagli, 4 minutes later, Alex Sandro would also go into the referee’s book, and with a lack of match winning options to choose from on the bench; Allegri would install Claudio Marchisio in place of Pjanic, a move which sadly did nothing to alter the course of destiny, as wouldn’t the prior arrival of Cuadrado, who already gotten himself booked as well. Speaking of destiny, the time would be nigh that the hometown homecoming of Gareth Bale would take place, as the Welshman replaced Karim Benzema to a rousing ovation. Allegri’s last roll of the dice would be in the form of Mario Lemina, as he replaced Paulo Dybala with just over 10 minutes to play. The evening would go from bad to worse for the Colombian, Cuadrado, as a brief altercation with Sergio Ramos, ended with him being given his second booking of the evening, and sent off as a result, becoming the first player to be dismissed in a Champions League final since Didier Drogba was back in the 2008 final for Chelsea. Marco Asensio, and Alvaro Morata would be introduced in place of Isco, and Toni Kroos, and the former would add his name to the scoresheet in the 90th minute, to wrap up a comprehensive second half performance for Real Madrid, and deservedly become the 2016/17 UEFA Champions League winners, and in doing so, became the first ever side to retain the title in its current format, and the first to win the European Cup in back to back seasons since the legendary AC Milan side did in 1989, and then 1990.\n\nFollowing on from that humbling 4-1 defeat, Juventus it seemed were going to be on the way down, and into transition, while Real Madrid would be the standard bearers at the envy of the football world. Instead, it is Juventus who currently lead the way in Serie A, and have a Coppa Italia final to look forward too, while Real Madrid’s defence of La Liga was as good as over before 2018, and while the Supercopa de Espana, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup were secured, there is still an air of this season being a disappointment. The turning point for their fortunes in 2018 likely coincided with their fine pair of victories over Paris Saint Germain. Going a goal behind to Adrien Rabiot’s 33rd minute strike on February 14th at the Santiago Bernabeu; the defending European champions were patient, and on the brink of half time, Cristiano Ronaldo would equalise from the penalty spot to level proceedings. Unai Emery’s side would then be punished late on in a vintage Real Madrid performance, as Ronaldo, and Marcelo completed a fine 3-1 win for Real Madrid. The second would be no different, despite PSG’s incredible record at home; Ronaldo and Casemiro’s goal’s either side of Edinson Cavani’s 71st minute goal, ensured that Real Madrid progressed to the last 8 with an emphatic 5-2 aggregate score-line. I would go on to suggest then, that should Zinedine Zidane’s side however pip Atletico Madrid to 2nd place and win the European Cup for a 3rd season in a row; the Frenchman will likely be spared an axe which seemed so close to his neck at the start of the year. Take the Copa del Rey exit out of the equation, this season continues to mirror the 2012-13 season, with Real Madrid, after enduring a terrible first half of the season, have since collected more points than any other side in La Liga in 2018, just as they did in the 2013 portion of the aforementioned 2012-13 season. Moreover, their masterful disposing of Paris Saint Germain in the round of 16 was not too dissimilar in effect as to how they eliminated Manchester United at the same juncture of that very season, and in Cristiano Ronaldo, they possess the World Player of the Year in red-hot form with some 21 goals in his last 11 appearances. Seemingly described as being ‘set to decline’ at the start of each season; Ronaldo has been a force of nature in 2018 netting 18 of his 22 league goals this season before January 21st! Moreover, he has scored in each of his last 7 UEFA Champions League knockout ties, and thus, it is no surprise to report that he stands atop of the Champions League scoring charts with 12 strikes. Goals across the team however has not been so fruitful, with just 14 other goal scorers (not including own goals) whereas last year they boasted 21, with their next highest scorer being Gareth Bale, who has 14 in all competitions, some 23 shy of Ronaldo. Real Madrid have scored 46 of their 76 league goals in 2018, with a return to their ‘Blitzkreig-ing’ ways central to their return to winning ways, and in each of their last 23 Champions League games, ‘Los Blancos’ have found the back of the net, and in the 28 which have been overseen by Zinedine Zidane, they have netted in all but 2; away to Wolfsburg, and Manchester City back in 2016. If their run to the 2016 title was a tad fortuitous in the knockout draw, their 2017 run was anything but as they had to see off: Napoli, Bayern Munich, Atletico Madrid, and then Juventus in order to secure ‘La Duo-Decima’, and with PSG, and now Juventus; it’s clear that the road to Kyiv is going to be even harder than the road to Cardiff was for the defending European champions!\n\nUnbeaten since losing to Sampdoria on November 19th, Juventus have remained unbeaten in each of their last 25 games in all competitions; winning 21 out of those 25 clashes, conceding just 5 goals along the way. A run of 10 games without conceding a goal in Serie A recently met its end this weekend against AC Milan, with former stalwart: Leonardo Bonucci scoring past his former side to end a run of some 968+ minutes without conceding in the league. Juventus would still prevail 3-1 on the night to move 4 points clear of Napoli. Much like their quarter final last season against Barcelona, they have the chance to make amends against the side to beat them in their most recent Champions League final appearance. Defeating the only other side in Serie A to have gone unbeaten in 2018 will be a huge morale boost as they rub shoulders against the side that humiliated them on June 3rd 2017. Juventus were not too far from a humiliation against Tottenham Hotspur; having gone 2-0 ahead at the Allianz Stadium within 10 minutes courtesy of a Gonzalo Higuain brace, Spurs would overwhelm the home side, with Harry Kane pulling a goal back for the visitors before the break. Higuain should have had a first half hat-trick; alas, he would miss a penalty on the cusp of half time to ensure that the visitors went into the break in the ascendency. A Spurs’ dominated second half would rightly see the visitors equalise through Christian Eriksen’s crafty free kick to see the game end 2-2, and with Spurs with 2 away goals going into the second leg. Despite Paolo Dybala back in the starting line-up for Juventus, it was Tottenham who continued the second leg in the same vein that they ended the first, and Son Heung-Min would be rewarded with a 39th minute goal to put Spurs ahead. A tactical reshuffle from Allegri would pay dividends in the second half, with Kwadwo Asamoah’s introduction paving the way for: Gonzalo Higuain, and Paolo Dybala to turn over the deficit. Defending their 2-1 lead for the next 25 minutes or so; their second half display at Wembley Stadium will go down as one of the finest defensive and tactically astute knockout stage performances in recent times. Did Juventus use all of their good fortune in their triumph over Tottenham Hotspur in the round of 16? It’s arguable that on any other evening, it is likely that Spurs would have ran roughshod over Juventus, especially given the disparity between the two sides in the second half of the 1st leg, and first half of the 2nd leg, however on how many other occasions would Juve’ have squandered a 2-0 lead, not to mention, missing out on making it a 3-0 lead courtesy of a missed Gonzalo Higuain penalty coming after he had already scored 2 goals? This 2-legged offering against Real Madrid also offers the likes of: Paolo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain, Miralem Pjanic, Juan Cuadrado the chance of atonement following dismal, and anonymous displays in the final in Cardiff last year.\n\nSince being rebranded as the ‘UEFA Champions League’ Juventus have eliminated Real Madrid in 4 respective 2-legged knockout ties: 1995/96, 2002/03, 2004/05, and 2014/15, and bar the 2004/05 season, Juventus would go on to reach the final; only to win the title on just one of those occasions! Moreover, in the 2 clashes in the final itself between the two sides, Real Madrid have gone 2-0. I firmly believe that the team that eliminates Real Madrid will go on to win this season’s competition, and what greater poetic justice would it be for the Italian champions to oust Real Madrid, and then go on to win the title itself? Blaise Matuidi, Douglas Costa, and Federico Bernadeschi have all been drafted in to make up for where they were exposed in the final, with Matuidi making his presence felt in the engine room, and in Costa, they have a speed and dribbling wizard who was a ball of fury in the 2nd leg against Tottenham Hotspur. Paolo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain have 22 goals each in all competitions, with Dybala set to have his best season in front of goal as a professional. Juventus will have to show the mental maturity they displayed as they went a goal behind against Tottenham at Wembley, and then some, if they are to defy the reigning champions. While it was unfortunate that 2 deflected goals found their way past Gianluigi Buffon in the final last year; Max Allegri’s side immediately dropped their heads as they were quickly swarmed upon by the opportunistic ‘Los Blancos’. Zinedine Zidane’s side were patient, calculated and brutally efficient as they dispensed of Paris Saint Germain over 2 legs, both home and away; they made it painstakingly obvious the term ‘levels’, as one side, despite a record summer spend, looked every bit inferior to the defending European champions whom were seemingly engulfed in a ‘crisis’. Unlike that tie, they will start the 1st leg away from home, just as they have done in each of the last 3 seasons, however only in the tie with Bayern Munich last season, have Real Madrid one the 1st leg of those quarter final’s as they would be upset by Wolfsburg in Germany in 2016, and held to a goalless draw by Atletico Madrid in 2015. Real Madrid have also never beaten Juventus in 2 prior attempts at the Allianz Arena, in fact ‘Los Blancos’ record against ‘I Bianconeri’ is pretty dismal in Turin, having won just once, back in 1962, in fact it took until 2013 for them to arrest a run of 6 straight defeats in Turin against Juventus, when they claimed a 2-2 draw in the 2013/14 season, before on the receiving end of a 2-1 defeat there the season after. While Gianluigi Buffon has only conceded 4 goals in 2018, Ronaldo, as we have discussed earlier, has scored 21, and has scored in his last 5 appearances when confronted by the legendary Italian shot stopper. On the flip side, Juventus are on course to register their most fruitful season in front of goal since the 1959-60 season, with a projected 88 goals they should end the league season with based on their average of 2.33 goals per game. The upshot of this is that this tie is guaranteed goals! In fact there has never been a goalless draw between these 2 sides in the 19 prior meetings between the two outfits; with that being said, I am backing Juventus to pull off a fine 2-1 win at the Allianz Stadium on Tuesday. Their combination: experience, modus operandi, team spirit, and fortress at home should likely give them the edge in what will be a tense 1st leg. From there, Juventus will make the trip south against relegation threatened Benevento, where they can afford to rest key players and still likely move 3 points closer to retaining their Serie A title.\n\nFore Real Madrid, the stakes are significantly higher, with the Madrid Derby against Atletico Madrid making their next fixture in La Liga after the first leg in Italy. A 2-1 defeat would represent damage limitation as far as Real Madrid were concerned, and with an away goal, they will more than fancy their chances to overturn the deficit in Madrid next week. The aforementioned Madrid Derby will be a war of attrition no doubt, but with Atletico Madrid only losing away from home in La Liga this season, and coming from a Thursday night Europa League game of their own; I believe that the ‘Rojiblancos’ will be there for the taking late on, and should Real Madrid get the 3 points, they would move within a point of their rivals who are stationed in 2nd place, and have more than enough confidence to believe that they can defeat Juventus on April 11th. Ironically, last season Real Madrid had to partake in the Madrid Derby just 4 days before the 1st Leg of the Champions League quarter final against Bayern Munich, and while it was an admittedly bigger squad last year, they had no difficulty managing the abundance of daunting fixtures that week in April 2017. Despite Juventus’ defensive record this season, the Champions League has seen that they can be gotten at by more adventurous outfits, and why Tottenham did not use the low cross based blueprint to beat Juventus that Real Madrid set last year will always continue to baffle me, nevertheless, Real Madrid will test that blueprint to no end as they seek to recover a 2-1 deficit, and it will pay off in the form of a 3-1 win at the Santiago Bernabeu, and incredibly, an 8th consecutive Champions League semi-final appearance; this time by way of a 4-3 aggregate score line.\n\nFC BARCELONA vs A.S. ROMA\n\nKEY INFO:\n\n1st Leg: 04/04/18 @ Camp Nou\n\n2nd Leg: 10/04/18 @ The Stadio Olimpico\n\nIt’s Spain vs Italy once more, albeit in more of a mismatch than European Super-Clasico, as A.S. Roma in their first quarter final appearance in 10 years meet a club whom have won the Champions League some 4 times in that 10 year period: Barcelona. The winners of Group’s B and D respectively; these 2 sides actually share 3 common opponents this season in: Chelsea, Juventus, and Atletico Madrid. Still unbeaten in La Liga after 30 rounds remarkably, Barcelona diced with death in their last outing away to Sevilla, and needed a late intervention from Luis Suarez, and crucially: Lionel Messi from the substitutes bench to come from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 on Saturday night. Roma themselves could only collect a point away to Bologna, and Wednesday night could very well see them not with a deficit to claw back in this tie, but usurped of 3rd place depending on the result of the Milan Derby which also takes places that day. Interestingly, these two sides have met in this competition previously and in 4 games; both sides own a win each, either side of 2 draws. The first time they met came back in the 2001/02 season, in the 2nd Group Stage of that season’s competition. If Roma could repeat these heroics they would be in the semi-final for the first time since the 1983-84 season! The meeting at the Camp Nou on February 20th 2002 would end 1-1 with Patrick Kluivert’s late goal cancelling out Christian Panucci’s opener. At the Stadio Olimpico 6 days later however, a fine 2nd half showing from Fabio Capello’s side saw: Emerson, Vincenzo Montella, and Damiano Tommasi give Roma a 3-0 win over ‘Los Cules’. While Fabio Capello may have once again gotten one over Barca’ following the infamous 4-0 win he guided Milan to over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final; it was the Catalan’s who had the last laugh, as they and Liverpool prevailed to the last 8 at the expense of the then defending Serie A champions. The 2 clubs would not meet again for some 13 years later in Group E of the 2015/16 Champions League group stages. A match-day 1 meeting at the Stadio Olimpico would also end 1-1 with Luis Suarez giving Barcelona the lead after 21 minutes, only for Alessandro Florenzi to score one of the greatest ever goals in the history of the sport when he bested Marc Andre Ter-Stegen from some 50 yards out to equalise. The return at the Camp Nou however would be a different matter entirely, as the former coach of AS Roma: Luis Enrique, guided the then defending European Champions to a 6-1 mauling of ‘I Giallorossi’ on November 24th 2015. A Luis Suarez brace, and Lionel Messi goal put Barcelona 3-0 to the good before half time, another Messi goal, supplemented by goals from: Gerard Pique, and Adriano, gave Barcelona a 6-0 lead before Edin Dzeko’s consolation goal. Remarkably, Roma would still qualify from the group, despite amassing a paltry 6 points from their 6 group games.\n\nAs far as this season is concerned, Barcelona would again top their group, beating Juventus 3-0 along the way, while Roma would come out of one of many ‘Group of Death’s this season; finishing in 1st place ahead of both Atletico Madrid, and Chelsea to reach the last 16. As Roma were drawn with Shakhtar Donetsk in the Last 16; Barcelona were given Chelsea; such was the cost of finishing 2nd in Group B. While Roma would predictably fall short in Eastern Europe in the 1st Leg; Cengiz Under’s away goal on February 21st, set the stage for Edin Dzeko to score the games only goal at the Stadio Olimpico, and send Roma to the last 8 on March 13th. On February 20th, Barcelona would come away from Stamford Bridge as the favourites to prevail to the quarter final, with Lionel Messi netting for the first time ever against Chelsea to cancel out Willian’s fine opener. Messi and co would then run roughshod over ‘the Blues’ on March 14th at the Camp Nou; winning comprehensively 3-0 thanks to a Messi brace, and Ousmane Dembele thumper. When the draw was made on March 16th, it was definitely Barcelona who were the happier of the 2 sides when their respective numbers were called. Is it fair however to have Roma written off in almost the same way as Sevilla are?\n\nFirst, let us assess their records against their common opponents this season: In 6 games, Barcelona have beaten: Juventus, Chelsea, and Atletico Madrid at the Camp Nou, and drew the corresponding away fixtures, Roma meanwhile lost to both Atletico Madrid and Juventus away from home, while drawing with Diego Simeone’s side at home, they would also secure a draw at Stamford Bridge, before securing a 3-0 win of their own against Chelsea at the Stadio Olimpico. In reaching the quarter final of Europe’s premier club competition for an 11th straight season; Barcelona will be meeting Italian opposition at this stage for just the 3rd time, previously eliminating AC Milan in 2012, before falling to Juventus last season. Ironically, they would also fail to win La Liga in each of those seasons, however they have no such worries this season given that they have yet to lose a single La Liga game this season, and their nearest challengers: Atletico Madrid are 9 points adrift of them in 2nd. As I touched upon earlier, this is Roma’s first appearance in the quarter final of the Champions League since a 2008 exit at the hands of eventual winners: Manchester United. They would be spectacularly eliminated by ‘the Red Devils’ 12 months earlier as they suffered an 8-3 aggregate elimination. In their only other appearance at this stage of the competition prior to that, Roma would defeat Dynamo Berlin, en route to the 1984 European Cup final, where they would fall on penalties to Liverpool. Roma have gained plenty of respect on the European stage with their performances this season, and while I expect a spirited performance from the Italian outfit, however their lack of experience at this level will likely be their undoing, not to the mention the fact that they are standing in the way of a possessed Lionel Messi! While Cengiz Under is set to miss out with injury, Radja Nainggolan has been cleared to play after being substituted after just 17 minutes against Bologna, while Messi will likely start after missing out in Argentina’s defeat against Spain last week, and only making the bench against Sevilla. Had the first leg been at the Olimpico, I may have given Roma a better chance of progression, as such, Barcelona will have the benefit of the home advantage in the 1st Leg, and I expect them to see off last season’s Serie A runners up 2-0 on Wednesday evening. Barcelona will then host Leganes on Saturday, and much like Bayern Munich; expect the changes to be rung in, especially as they look forward to their 2 nearest rivals: Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid to tear 7 shades out of each other 24 hours later. Roma meanwhile face a resurgent Fiorentina at home in the battle to finish in the top 4. Fiorentina have won each of their last 4 games in the league, they have lost in each of their 5 league visits to the capital against Roma, nevertheless, it will be a game that tests all of Roma’s resources ahead of the April 10th 2nd Leg. I don’t expect Eusebio Di Francesco’s side fortunes to change that much at home, and ergo, I expect Barcelona to once again prevail; this time by a 2-1 score-line as Barcelona reach the semi-final of the competition for the first time since 2015, and for just the second time in the last 5 seasons, by virtue of a 4-1 aggregate victory.\n\nLIVERPOOL FC vs MANCHESTER CITY\n\nKEY INFO:\n\n1st Leg: 04/04/18 @ Anfield\n\n2nd Leg: 10/04/18 @ The Etihad Arena\n\nFor the 4th time since 2008, we have a pan-English affair in the quarter final of the Champions League, and it what should be the most thrilling of all the quarter final match-ups: Liverpool take on Manchester City! In the league outings between these two sides this season, we have seen 12 goals scored, with Manchester City winning a controversial clash 5-0 at The Etihad Arena on September 9th. That win would form the 2nd of what amounted to an 18 match winning streak in the league. When the two sides met again on January 14th, Liverpool would claim a fantastic 4-3 win over the Premier League leaders; ending Manchester City’s 30 match unbeaten league run. That defeat remains Manchester City’s one, and only Premier League blemish this season. Following on from that juncture, Manchester City would claim the EFL Cup on February 25th after defeating Arsenal 3-0; both sides however would suffer the ignominy of early FA Cup exits against: Wigan Athletic, and West Bromwich Albion respectively. Manchester City currently sit 22 points clear of 3rd placed Liverpool, and if they can defeat Manchester United this weekend at the Etihad Arena; they would set the record for winning the Premier League with 8 games still to spare. With all of that said however, since arriving in England ahead of the 2016/17 season; Pep Guardiola has only claimed 1 win in 4 attempts against Jurgen Klopp, and Liverpool. In fact, the former Borussia Dortmund coach owns the highest winning percentage against Guardiola, and given that Klopp has led Dortmund and Liverpool to European finals more recently than Guardiola has led a club to a European final makes this a mouth watering tie for the ages.\n\nBoth teams got to the last 8 in similar circumstances, with their place in the quarter final all but ensured at the end of the 1st leg. On February 13th, while most of the attention was on Juventus vs Tottenham; Manchester City descended upon St. Jakob-Park, and crushed FC Basel 4-0 in Switzerland thanks to an Ilkay Gundogan brace, and supplementary goals from: Bernardo Silva and Sergio Aguero. 24 hours later, again whilst eyes were elsewhere, Liverpool lit up the Estadio do Dragao; destroying FC Porto 5-0 with Sadio Mane scoring a fantastic hat-trick, along with goals from: Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah. An uneventful second leg unfolded at Anfield in the form of a goalless draw on March 6th, and then a day later, Manchester City would surprisingly fall to a 2-1 defeat against FC Basel, with Gabriel Jesus’ opening goal being cancelled out; nevertheless, City would vanquish their demons from last season when they bowed out at the last 16 against Monaco. Their appearance in this season’s Champions League quarter final is just their second appearance in the last 8 in their 7 successive seasons in the competition. The last time Liverpool reached the quarter final of the Champions League was one of the aforementioned, all English affairs at this stage; that was of course the last their legendary series against Chelsea, where between the 2004-05 season to the 2008-09 season; they played against each other in every Champions League campaign. Times were such, that during April of 2009, Liverpool were still the most successful side in England, Rafa Benitez was their manager, their squad featured the likes of: Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso, Javier Mascherano, Dirk Kuyt, and Fernando Torres, while Manchester City on the other hand were in the midst of a first, and mostly disappointing debut season under the ownership of Sheikh Mansour and the Dubai group. Their foray in the last 8 of this season’s competition represents their farthest progression in the tournament since then fateful season, and also have the distinction of being the competition’s top scorers this campaign with 28 goals in their 8 game played in the Champions League proper. In the Premier League stakes however, Manchester City have scored 13 more goals than Liverpool despite having played a game less, in fact only Paris Saint Germain have scored more goals than Manchester City throughout Europe’s top 5 leagues.\n\nGuardiola and Klopp first crossed paths in the 2013/14 Bundesliga season, when Guardiola stepped into the Bayern Munich hot-seat, and he would be given a rude awakening in 2013 German Super Cup, as Borussia Dortmund claimed a superb 4-2 win in the German curtain raiser. The two rivals would meet 3 more times that season, with each side exchanging 3-0 wins in the league, while Bayern got the last laugh as they captured the 2014 DFB-Pokal 2-0 after extra time, not to mention winning the Bundesliga title by some 18 points. Guardiola would fail to avenge their defeat to Dortmund in the German Super Cup, as ‘Der BVB’ claimed a 2-0 win on August 13th 2014. Bayern and Guardiola would net home, and away victories over Klopp and Dortmund in the league, and while Bayern won the league for a 3rd straight season; Jurgen Klopp’s stint as Borussia Dortmund head coach ended rather unceremoniously as they finished in a dismal 7th place. They would even see off Bayern 2-0 in the semi-final of the DFB-Pokal, only to be beaten 3-1 by Wolfsburg in the final. With a 4-4 perfect record against one another, their first meeting in charge of Liverpool, and Manchester City respectively came on December 31st 2016, and Liverpool would triumph 1-0 on New Years Eve. Their second meeting came on March 19th 2017 where a 1-1 draw panned out. Taking this season’s clashes into consideration; Klopp owns a remarkable 6-5-1 record in 12 games against Guardiola, making him the only manager to own a 50%+ winning percentage against the Catalan tactician.\n\nI have earmarked the rivalry between Manchester City and Liverpool to be the battle for 1st and 2nd next season in England, and this intriguing knockout tie will lay the foundations for this rivalry to fully peak next season. Beginning at Anfield tomorrow, Liverpool can ill afford to lose, and will likely have to accept that the concession of an away goal is a given against the marauding league leaders. If the Anfield faithful can help conjure the classic European atmosphere synonymous with the club, then I can see Liverpool striking early, and going as far as taking a 3-2 win; especially with Sergio Aguero ruled out of the game with injury, the fact that City have not won at Anfield since May 2003, and with the electrifying Mohamed Salah in the form that he is in. Both sides have taken an identical 25 points in the league in 2018, and as Liverpool have been the only team to defeat ‘the Cityzens’ in the league this season; this tie is a lot more evenly poised than people would have you believe. If reports are correct that Pep Guardiola is prepared to field a significantly altered side against Manchester United this Saturday in order to preserve the vitality of his troops ahead of next Tuesday’s 2nd Leg, then I will presume that a draw unfolds at Eastlands, with City having to wait another week to wrap up the title, while Liverpool themselves will have a fierce Merseyside Derby against Everton earlier that day. In 5 bouts managing against Everton; Jurgen Klopp has won 4 and drawn 1, however I wouldn’t be surprised to see changes also rung in from the Liverpool boss, and another draw to unfold at Goodison Park. That then brings us to the April 10th showdown at the Etihad Arena, and it will most likely be a war of attrition; I ultimately see Manchester City prevailing 2-0 on the night to win the tie 4-3 and match their 2015-16 season milestone of reaching the Champions League semi-final, with a treble still on the cards!\n\nThat took a lot longer than expected!\n\nSo here we are less than an hour before kick-off on the Tuesday clashes, I’m rushing to get this thing posted!

After 3 months away from the blog game, the flame on the Charmander’s tail was once again stoked, as the Champions League group stages kick off in just 5 days’ time! Originally I had intended to replicate my piece from last year, however after realising that I had already exceeded 5,000 words at the conclusion of Group D; I felt it wiser to split this up into 2 offerings, so here’s to another season of the greatest club competition in the world, hope you all enjoy…\n\nGROUP A:\n\nBENFICA, MANCHESTER UNITED, CSKA MOSCOW, FC BASEL…\n\nUnited look to vanquish their enemies of awry groups of years gone by…\n\nManchester United return back to the Champions League after a 1 year absence, this time as the 2017 Europa League winners, and while they would have been happy to dodge any of the ‘big boys’, they have been drawn with a series of tricky opponents, all of whom have been present in the 3 times in which Manchester United have been dumped out of the competition at the group stage during the 21st century. The most recent of those foes would be CSKA Moscow, and while Jose Mourinho’s side are unbeaten in 4 games with the Russian outfit, a draw in the Russian capital on match-day 3 of the 2015/16 season’s group stage would accelerate the 3 time winner’s descent into the Europa League that season. FC Basel, and Benfica however will conjure up more disdainful memories to the United faithful, as the 2011/12 group stage saw the 3 sides pit together, and it would be the respective Swiss, and Portuguese clubs that would progress at the English giant’s expense. An FC Basle side featuring the likes of: Alexander Frei, Marco Streller, Xherdan Shaqiri, and Granit Xhaka would secure a fantastic 3-3 draw at Old Trafford, before stunning ‘the Red Devils’ 2-1 at St Jakob Park in the second-place finish eliminator in what is one of the club’s most famous (if not the most famous) ever victories. Benfica would ultimately top the group by virtue of their 2-0 win over Basel on match-day 3 in Switzerland, along the way however, they would battle Manchester United to 2 draws in a season that saw them reach the quarter final of the competition. Of course Manchester United and Benfica’s history extends as far back as the 1960’s, where Sir Matt Busby’s side would defeat ‘the Eagles’ and Eusebio in the 1968 final. Benfica would gain a measure of revenge by eliminating United out of the 2005/06 season’s group stage, before Sir Alex Ferguson’s side secured the double over the Portuguese side the following season.\n\nThe Benfica side, then led by Jorge Jesus, was an almighty outfit on paper; fielding the likes of: Joan Capdevila, Ezequiel Garay, Jardel, Luisao, Pablo Aimar, Nico Gaitan, Javi Garcia, Nemanja Matic, Maxi Pereira, Axel Witsel, Oscar Cardozo, Rodrigo, Nolito, and Javier Saviola, it is no surprise that the Portuguese side reached the quarter final, moreover, only the eventual winners: Chelsea would oust them that year. Back to the present day, this group is most certainly Manchester United’s to lose; boasting one of the most physically imposing, and gifted sides in the competition, not to mention being led by one of the sport’s greatest ever minds in Jose Mourinho, anything less than a first place finish would be a disappointment for this United side. While the calibre of opposition they have played in Europe over the past 2 seasons has hardly been the elite, Mourinho has showed no signs of letting up as he manages in the Champions League for 14th season. On that basis, that leaves Basel and Benfica to battle it out for second place; and while Basle looked set to become one of the break out European sides; claiming fine wins over: Manchester United, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, as well a semi-final finish in the 2012/13 Europa League; poor performances in the last 2 seasons itineration of the competition have seen that notion dismiss. I am backing Benfica to breach the group stage along with Manchester United, while Basel drop into the Europa League. Despite featuring in each of the last 4 group stages, CSKA have an abysmal record in the Champions League at this juncture, claiming just 3 wins in 24 games.\n\nI have picked out the 2 clashes between Benfica, and Basle as the key affairs in this group; beginning on match-day 2 at St Jakob park; I am going to side with the Portuguese champions to win both affairs, however a tricky game in the unforgiven Russian winter awaits on November 22nd, a game where I see points being dropped for Benfica; thus giving Basel the opportunity to bridge the gap between the 2 sides. Last season, Benfica made a mess out of their group, before finally finishing second as Besiktas spectacularly collapsed against Dynamo Kyiv in a 6-0 thrashing on the final match-day. While their 1-1 with the Turkish champions at the Estadio da Luz was nothing out of the ordinary despite Talisca’s dramatic late goal; the 3-3 draw in Istanbul, that saw Benfica surrender a 3-0 lead was nothing short of bizarre. I wouldn’t be surprised to see Rui Vitoria’s side involved in another series of puzzling results, against the elite however, Benfica have shown their mettle in recent seasons; claiming wins over: Borussia Dortmund, and Atletico Madrid, as well as holding Pep Guardiola’s Bayern Munich to a draw in the 2015/16 quarter final, and it is these successes, that leads me to believe that Benfica will claim a stunning 1-0 victory over Manchester United in Lisbon on match-day 3, before the finishing the job with a cool win at home to Basel to certify their place amongst the last 16. In another twist of fate, I am also backing CSKA to end their 6 year long wait for a win in the group stage, by defeating Basel in Moscow.\n\nGROUP B:\n\nBAYERN MUNICH, PARIS SAINT GERMAIN, ANDERLECHT, CELTIC…\n\n2003-04 echoes for Bayern Munich as the spectre of PSG looms large over former favourite Ancelotti…\n\nIt is crazy when one thinks that this time a decade ago, Bayern Munich would not be involved in the 2007/08 Champions League competition, PSG had finished 15th at the conclusion of the 2006/07 season, while Carlo Ancelotti would enter the 2007/08 season having just led his AC Milan side to the 2006/07 Champions League title. 4 years prior to that, Carlo Ancelotti would again the latest itineration of the European Cup as the manager of an AC Milan side whom had just won the competition the previous spring, more ironically however would be the hand that Bayern Munich were dealt; as that season, their group stage contemporaries were none other than: Glasgow Celtic, Anderlecht and then French champions: Olympique Lyonnais. Ahead of the 2017/18 competition, Bayern, Celtic, and Anderlecht are all drawn together once more, while the former champions of France: Paris Saint-Germain join them in what should be a thrilling group. Of course the favourites to progress will be: Bayern and PSG, however as Celtic, and Anderlecht showed against Manchester’s City and United last season; despite their lesser esteemed statuses, they are more than capable of springing an upset, or throwing a spanner into the works. Celtic famously held Bayern Munich to a draw at Celtic Park that season back in 03/04, and along the way their famous ground has seen the likes of: Barcelona (03/04, 12/13) Villarreal (03/04, 08/09), Milan (04/05, 06/07, 07/08) Manchester United (06/07, 08/09), Benfica (06/07, 07/08, 12/13) Atletico Madrid (11/12), Ajax (13/14, 15/16) Inter Milan (14/15), Fenerbahce (15/16), & Manchester City (16/17) all return back to their respective homes unable to beat the Scots at their fabled ground. In my opinion, only Anfield may carry a more magical atmosphere than Celtic Park on a European night, and much like their brethren from the docks of England, challenging the bigger teams has never been as much of an issue as being beaten by sides of their own stature. Anderlecht themselves boast a fine history of wins at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium during the 21st century; defeating the likes of: Manchester United, PSV Eindhoven, Lazio, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Hamburg, Zenit Saint Petersburg, Galatasaray, Tottenham Hotspur, as well as holding: AS Roma, Bayern Munich, Lyon, Paris Saint Germain, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, AS Monaco to draws.\n\nCeltc Park, and Belgian romanticism aside, the real narrative of the group is going to be who will emerge superior between the 2 footballing super powers: Bayern Munich & PSG, in what is one of the more refreshing pairings in recent Champions League history. The current Bayern head coach: Carlo Ancelotti was somewhat controversially appointed as PSG head coach back in 2011 shortly following the QSi takeover, as the previous incumbent: Antoine Kombouare was removed from his post despite his side being at the top of Ligue 1. While that season, PSG would ultimately be pipped to the title by the surprise package of Montpellier; Ancelotti’s PSG would soon make their presence felt in the 2012-13 season, winning the Ligue 1 title, and earning universal plaudits for their performances in Europe as they bowed on 3-3 on away goals to Barcelona in the quarter final of the Champions League. Ancelotti would of course trade the French capital for Madrid, before being appointed as Pep Guardiola’s successor at Bayern Munich in 2016, and after an artistically disappointing maiden campaign in Bavaria; the pressure will be on this season for the Italian to return Bayern Munich amongst the elite of Europe. While the 10-2 aggregate demolition of Arsenal was nothing short of impressive, defeats (& a second place group finish) to Atletico Madrid, Rostov, and then 2 a legged drubbing by Real Madrid in the quarter final left the Italian with more critics than admirers at the end of the season. His blushes may have only been spared by his opposite number in the PSG dugout: Unai Emery. The Spaniard was drafted in to replace Laurent Blanc, the mastermind of back to back domestic trebles, as his historic 3 successive Europa League wins with Sevilla was supposed to lay the foundations for better fortunes in Europe for the Parisiens. After a group stage that saw them finish in 2nd place thanks to a match-day 6 draw with Ludogorets, their reward was a last 16 tie with Barcelona. After winning the first leg 4-0 in Paris, they fell victim to the greatest comeback in football history in my opinion, as a Neymar Jr inspired Barcelona stormed back to win 5-1 in the Camp Nou. Taking heed from that night in Catalonia, the PSG owners went out and smashed the world transfer record to source the Brazilian from Barcelona, throw in the purchases: of Kylian Mbappe (who will become the 2nd most expensive ever transfer in world football when his purchase is made complete next year) and Dani Alves, and the message from Paris is clear: All or nothing for the Champions League! Unlike last season, the French side have begun their season with 4 wins out of 4 in Ligue 1, netting 14 goals along the way.\n\nBayern Munich have seen a huge summer of change as the influential: Philip Lahm, and Xabi Alonso retired from the sport, Douglas Costa and Renato Sanches departed on loan, the likes of: James Rodriguez, Niklas Sule, Sebastian Rudy, and Corentin Tolisso were drafted as replacements. Robert Lewandowski continues to prove himself as one of the world’s top 5 strikers; already netting 6 goals in just 4 games this season. The 2 sides have played each other 6 times in the competition in the past, with PSG edging the Germans 4-2, with that being said however, the last time they were drawn together was in the 2000/01 season, the season which ironically Bayern Munich would go on to win the Champions League. The key clashes in the group will be the meetings between the 2 sides in question; match-day 2 see’s Bayern go to the Parc de Princes where I believe that honours will be even. Interestingly, I am going to tip Celtic to upset Bayern Munich on October 31st, conversely however, a Neymar inspired PSG I believe will trounce the Scots at Celtic Park on match-day 1. Anderlecht have quietly gone about their business over the last 3 seasons; improving on their finish in the Europa League with each passing season, and it is those improvements which leads me to believe that they will ultimately edge out Celtic in the race for 3rd place, and while I predict that Bayern will defeat to PSG on match-day 6, they will have to settle for 2nd place in the group for a second year running, as Unai Emery’s side make their presence felt in Europe with a fine 1st place finish.\n\nGROUP C:\n\nCHELSEA, ATLETICO MADRID, AS ROMA, QARABAG…\n\nGroup of death looks set to be a fight to the finish as Italians: Conte & Roma battle for continental credence against the perennial masters: Simeone & Atletico Madrid…\n\nWhile Group B contains just 2 elite outfits battling for supremacy, the first official ‘Group of Death’ was undoubtedly this draw, as: Chelsea, Atletico Madrid, and Roma were drafted against one another. ‘I Giallorossi’ have finished runners up in Serie A in 3 of the last 4 seasons, and boast more 2nd place finishes in Italy than any other side in the country this century; their performances in Europe during that time have been underwhelming to say the least, making no higher than the quarter final of the Champions League, the last of which will be a decade ago come the end of this season. This summer rang a series of huge changes for the club from the Italian capital with Luciano Spalletti moving on to Inter Milan, and on the pitch: Mohamed Salah, Antonio Rudiger, Leandro Paredes were all sold, while the legendary Francesco Totti bid farewell to the game. Off the pitch, new Sporting Director: Monchi, was sourced from Sevilla, while Eusebio di Francecso the Roma alumnus was drafted in as the clubs new manager. The ‘Monchi Effect’ was in full motion during the Transfer Window, with 9 signings being made, most notably: Patrik Schick, Gregoire Defrel, Aleksandar Kolarov, Cengiz Under, Maxime Gonalons, Lorenzo Pellegrini, Rick Karsdorp, and Hector Moreno. While a combination of inconsistency, and being shown up by the ‘big teams’ have always dogged Roma in Europe, wins over: Villarreal, Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Arsenal, Real Madrid, Valencia, Lyon, Manchester United, Ajax, Barcelona, and Liverpool in Europe since 2001 do show that they are capable of huge result. Sadly, the lion’s share of those wins all came pre-2010, and just as famous are the hidings that they have been on the receiving end of, such as losing: 3-0, 3-0, 4-2, to Real Madrid (2002-03, 2004-05, 3-1 to Arsenal (2002-03), 7-1 to Manchester United (2006-07), 3-0 to Shakhtar Donetsk (2010-11), 7-1 to Bayern Munich, (2014-15), 3-0 to Fiorentina (2014-15), 6-1 to Barcelona (2015-16), not to mention embarrassing cup exits to the likes of: Middlesbrough, Shakhtar Donetsk, Real Madrid, FC Porto, and Olympique Lyonnais over the years as well. Although long regarded as one of Italy’s most attacking and attractive sides to watch, as Spalletti, and Inter Milan exposed on match-day 2 of Serie A; their ongoing defensive and profligacy issues, and susceptibility of the counter attack will make them utterly vulnerable against the ultra-opportunists which are: Atletico Madrid, and Chelsea. Roma begin their campaign at home to Atletico Madrid, and will look to the 1-1 draw that they held Barcelona to at the Stadio Olimpico on match-day #1 of the 2015-16 season. The last time Roma, and Atletico Madrid played each other was in the 1998/99 UEFA Cup quarter-final, where the Spaniard’s won 4-2 over 2 legs. Luckily for them, they are the first side to make the draining journey to Azerbaijan, that fixture with competition debutants: Qarabag takes place on match-day 2, and while I believe they should come away with 3 points, it will be just to draw level with the likes of Atleti’ and Chelsea, who I reckon will already have 3 points each by match-day 2.\n\nAtletico Madrid and Diego Simeone need no introduction to this competition; in the last 4 seasons, ‘Los Colchoneros’ have been involved in 2 finals, 1 semi-final, and 1 quarter-final; only Real Madrid boast more consistency over that period, and unsurprisingly, only Real Madrid have knocked out Simeone’s side during those 4 seasons. During those 4 seasons: AC Milan, Benfica, Bayern Munich, Bayer Leverkusen, Barcelona, Juventus, PSV Eindhoven and Chelsea have all been beaten by the ‘Rojiblancos’, a phenomenal statistic to say the least. Unlike those previous 4 campaigns, Atletico Madrid have to enter this season’s competition with no re-enforcements due to a FIFA imposed transfer embargo, and will also be playing in the newly built: Wanda Metropolitano, moving away from their previous home: the Vicente Calderon. A throwback to stadia of old; the Calderon created an utterly intimidating atmosphere for visiting sides to play in, and in the final European clash to be held at the old ground, Diego Simeone’s side finally secured a victory over Real Madrid in European competition, in an electrifying performance which ended up as the only game that the defending European champions would lose en route to defending the crown. Despite the complexity of the group, Atletico Madrid have previously topped groups that also featured Juventus, and Bayern Munich; the common denominator? Both sides were coached by Italians, as are Roma, and Chelsea! Of course, while I am speaking with tongue in cheek there, I still believe that Atletico Madrid shall inevitably top this group, doing so for what would be the 5th season in a row. I wouldn’t be surprised to see their group stage pan out as it did last season; winning all 5 of their opening matches, before ultimately being defeated in match-day 6, which this season shall be at Stamford Bridge against Chelsea. The last time Atletico Madrid and Chelsea butt their heads was in the 2013/14 semi-final, where after a goalless draw in Spain, Atleti’ came from a goal behind to defeat to Chelsea 3-1 to reach that season’s finale. Diego Simeone’s side would show up ‘the Blues’ again in the 2012 UEFA Super Cup as they romped to a 4-1 win over the then defending European champions. The 2 sides were drawn together in the 2009/10 group stages, and Chelsea remained unbeaten against the eventual winners of that season’s Europa League; drawing 2-2 in Madrid, the English side romped to a 4-0 win at Stamford Bridge on 21/10/09.\n\nAfter a one year absence from the competition, Chelsea return back to the Champions League, and what a hand they have been dealt! Between 2004-2009, ‘the Blues’ reached 4 semi-finals, 1 last 16 finish, and 1 final, before finally capturing Europe’s grandest prize in 2012. Despite winning the trophy, their form this decade has not shone with the consistency that preceded 2010, and with a group stage exit coming in their defence of the crown in the 2012-13; the English champions are sadly now burdened with having the worst Champions League title defence in the modern format of the competition. Ironically, that season they were drawn with a Juventus side managed by Antonio Conte, who made their return to the Champions League after a 1 year absence from the competition. Conte of course is now the man tasked with making the 5 time Premier League winners a force on the continent again. Interestingly, Conte’s record in Europe is underwhelming in light of his domestic dominance; a respectable quarter final finish with Juventus in 2012-13, made way for a disaster of a 2013-14 campaign, where his side were dumped into the Europa League after finishing 3rd in their group, before being upset in the semi-final of the Europa League by Benfica; a defeat made even more bitter given that the 2014 Europa League final was to be held at the Juventus Stadium. The goalless draw with the Portuguese champions on 01/05/14 was the last time Conte coached a side in a continental club clash, and given that host debutants Qarabag on match-day #1; it will likely be a successful return to the Champions League for both coach, and club on September 12th. The back to back games with Roma on match-day’s: 3 & 4 will likely decide who of those 2 sides go through to the next round, and it is my opinion that Chelsea will progress at Roma’s expense. The last time the 2 sides met came in the 2008/09 season, and both sides shared a win apiece, upon reaching the last 16.\n\nAlthough I have ear marked both Atletico Madrid, and Chelsea to qualify, there are still some x factors that could influence proceedings; namely: how will Atletico Madrid deal with their new surroundings, and a squad that has been denied any reinforcements? There is also the Qarabag factor; the first to ever from the nation of Azerbaijan to compete in the group stages, no side will be looking forward to the long distance journey to far eastern reaches of the continent, in fact Atletico Madrid will remember a visit to Kazakhstan to meet Astana back in 2015 which ended a goalless draw. While all is seemingly asunder at Chelsea, are the cracks in the relationship between manager and club just being papered over? His plea’s and cries for reinforcements, despite the final day acquisitions of: Davide Zappacosta, and Danny Drinkwater, will be either validated or dumbfounded as the group stage progresses. In the 6 respective bouts between: Atletico Madrid, Chelsea, and Roma; I see Atleti’ claiming a 2-1 win in Rome, before making 2 wins in a row with a 1-0 win against Chelsea at home. ‘The Blues’ and Roma then meet in back to back clashes, and I think the affair at Stamford Bridge will end 2-2, before Chelsea claim a decisive 3-1 win in the Italian capital on match-day 4. Roma’s trip to Wanda Metropolitano on November 22nd may be the game that ends Roma’s qualification hopes, as I see Diego Simeone’s side winning 1-0 at home, before Chelsea defeat Atletico Madrid 2-1 at Stamford Bridge on match-day 6.\n\nGROUP D:\n\nJUVENTUS, BARCELONA, OLYMPIACOS, SPORTING LISBON…\n\nRoles reverse as it is Barcelona who are the hunted; can the vulnerable Blaugrana vanquish the Bianconeri demons from last season…\n\nUnthinkable that Barcelona go into a group stage NOT as the favourite to win the group, however such was the magnitude of the defeat that they suffered against Barcelona in last season’s quarter final, that it is now Max Allegri’s Juventus who are the team to beat. For a detailed history of Allegri vs Barcelona, I implore you to read my Champions League quarter final preview from last season (https://aragami2236.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/origami-with-aragami-107-the-champions-league-quarter-final-preview/). Instead of repeating that history, let us look at the state of the 2 outfits here in September 2017. Badly beaten finalists in last season’s Champions League final; for 45 minutes Juventus looked as though they were on their way to finally ending the 19 year wait for a UEFA Champions League win; Mario Mandzukic’s ‘golazo’ cancelled out Cristiano Ronaldo’s opener, and just as they had looked throughout the competition, Juventus were looking tactically spot on as the 2 sides headed into half time at 1-1. The second half performance of Juve’ will remain one of football’s great unsolved mysteries, as the usually ice cold ‘Bianconeri’ fell to pieces in one of the most spectacular unravelling’s that I have ever bore witness too, in the end, they would be reduced to 10 men, and lick the wounds of a 4-1 defeat that night in Wales. Then came the disaster that was the Patrik Schick medical, and the shockwave inducing transfer of Leonardo Bonucci to AC Milan. The loss of arguably the best centre back in world football after Sergio Ramos may still very well be tipping point in the end of this Juve’ dynasty, however the Juventus board, arguably the most studious in football today, have ensured that every department of their squad has been bolstered, bringing in: Wojciech Szczesny, Mattia De Sciglio, Benedikt Howedes, Blaise Matuidi, Rodrigo Bentancur, Douglas Costa, and Federico Bernadeschi to compensate for departures of: Neto, Dani Alves, Bonucci himself, Mario Lemina, and Tomas Rincon.\n\nThe same unfortunately cannot be said of Barcelona, and their board, as the club endured a nightmare summer of PR, and activity in the transfer market. Tito Valverde arrived at the Camp Nou, surely expecting a player in the mould of either: Marco Verrati, or Philipe Coutinho to arrive, alongside a host of fringe players who knock on the door for contention. The re-signing of Gerard Deulofeu, and the capture of Nelson Semedo at right back seemed to indicate that all was going in the right direction, however by the 20th of July, it was Paris Saint Germain relentlessly pursuing a player in the blue and red of Barcelona; that man being none other than Neymar. The Brazilian was in nothing short of scintillating form during pre-season, however on August 3rd, the French club made the Brazilian captain the most expensive ever transfer in the sport’s history; triggering a reported €222 million release clause. The transfer that changed the sport as we know it as far as transfer fees are concerned left ‘the Blaugrana’ in a precarious situation; despite receiving a world record transfer fee, they were forced to relinquish ties with one of football’s most commercially, and artistically successful footballers, and in turn, strengthen a European rival. Moreover, the timing of the transfer left the club in a panic mode, as a whole host of names from: Ousmane Dembele, Philipe Coutinho, Paulo Dybala, Kylian Mbappe, Jean Michael Seri, Angel di Maria, and Antoine Griezmann were touted as new arrivals. In the end, the club made the most bizarre of signings, as Paulinho was drafted in from Guangzhou Evergrande for a whopping €40 million. Not discounting the quality of the player, however for a side that is more than stocked in the department of industrious central midfielders, the 2013 Confederations Cup winner is hardly an improvement on the likes of: Arda Turan, Denis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic, or Andre Gomes, thus begging the question: if he is not an immediate starter, how is the €40 million outlay vindicated on a 29 year old who has been plying his trade in China since 2015? Then came the ill-fated Supercopa de Espana, after the heroic 3-2 win at the Santiago Bernabeu in April, the defending Spanish, and European Champions, Real Madrid made an utter example of Barcelona, crushing them 5-1 over 2 legs to leave no doubt as to whom the best side in the country was at this time. Sadly, that harrowing pair of results would not force the hand of the Bartomeu cabinet in re-enforcing the squad. With that being said, Barcelona have 2 wins from 2 in their opening 2 La Liga games, and Ousmane Dembele was eventually signed for a whopping €105 million from Borussia Dortmund, Liverpool’s resolve however was not to be broken, where despite reports of bids being tabled as high as €135 million, the English side would not negotiate whatsoever with Barcelona, as far as Philipe Coutinho was concerned.\n\nNaturally, one expects both: Barcelona, and Juventus to reach the last 16, the order in which they shall finish however will be telling factor in this group. The 2 sides clash at the Camp Nou in what is undoubtedly the match-up of round 1, and you can expect that Barcelona will be hungry for revenge, following their elimination last season at the hands of Juventus. Despite both sides winning their opening 2 fixtures in their respective leagues, neither side has been truly convincing thus far. Juventus had to come from 2 goals down to eventually down Genoa 4-2, while Barcelona have kept 2 clean sheets, better finishing from the opposition they played against would have left a need for a greater inquisition. This will be the exhibition of 2 Argentine super-stars wearing the #10 shirts for their respective clubs: Lionel Messi, and Paolo Dybala. While of course Dembele hasn’t yet featured for his new club, Messi is already showing that is likely to be Barca’s difference maker again this season, having found the net 3 times already, and hit the woodwork 5; you get the impression already that his presence will be the difference this season between a winning Barcelona side, and a horribly average side; such is the sphere of influence, and quality possessed by the 5 time Ballon d’Or winner. Dybala has 6 goals to his name already, including a fine hat-trick to dig his side out of the 2-0 hole that Genoa left them in; clearly he is embracing the #10 jersey that has been handed to him this season. Juventus became the first side in 4 years to prevent Barcelona from scoring at the Camp Nou in the Champions League, a feat that I do not see being replicated on Tuesday. I am backing a 2-2 draw to unfold in Barcelona, with both the Argentine hot-shots netting a brace each.\n\nThis then leaves the other 2 participants in the group: Sporting Lisbon and Olympiacos to steal a lead on the group favourites. Neither side has a remarkable history in this competition, in fact Sporting Lisbon are more infamous for their 2008-09 campaign where they lost 5-2 to Barcelona, before suffering a 12-1 aggregate humiliation against Bayern Munich. Jorge Jesus’ side were valiant in defeats to both: Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund in last season’s competition, and have managed to keep hold of Bas Dost, and seemingly Adrien Silva, while bringing in: Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Acuna, alongside the experienced: Fabio Coentrao, and Jeremy Mathieu; and thus far the club have gone 4/4 in the win column in the Primeira Liga. Olympiacos return to the competition after missing out last season, and while they are Greece’s most successful club, have never built on their appearance in the 1998/99 Champions League quarter final. English clubs have always been their bane it seems; with Arsenal pipping them to the last 16 on goal difference back in 2015/16, and a Robin van Persie inspired Manchester United overturning a 2-0 deficit to oust them 3-2 in the 2013/14 last 16. Just the season before, ‘The Gunners’ once again edged them in the battle for second place, before missing out on second place again in 2011/12, in a group that once again featured Arsenal. Interestingly, they would meet Arsene Wenger’s side again in the 2009/10 campaign, although they would reach the last 16 that season, however an appearance in the last 16 in 2007/08 saw their campaign end at the hands of Chelsea. If you go back to 2004-05, Liverpool would stand between the Greek side and the last 16. They have also had their fair share of run-ins with Juventus along the way as well, losing in all 4 games against ‘I Bianconeri’, most recently in the 2014-15 season. While this will be their first ever meeting with Sporting, Olympiakos are unbeaten in 10 of their 15 clashes with Portuguese opposition; defeating Arouca in a Europa League play-off last season, as well qualifying ahead of Benfica in the 2013/14 Champions League group stages.\n\nUltimately, I see Juventus topping the table with Barcelona just behind them in second; as the November 22nd clash at the Alianz Arena (in my opinion) will end in the favour of the home side, in the form of a 2-1 win, as Juve’s fabulous record at their fortress of a home ground continues in Europe. With Juventus’ qualification already assured by match-day #6; I will predict that Olympiakos ultimately edge out the Italian side in Greece, while Barcelona will see off Sporting Lisbon to condemn them to a 2nd successive December exit from Europe.\n\n5318 words and counting…\n\nSo at the 5318 word mark, I conclude the Groups: A-D! I will be publishing Episode #127 on Monday evening most likely; rest assured however, this year I’m not going to cover each and every match-day, rather, I shall do a review, and preview of every epoch i.e the review of the group stages, the preview of the last 16 etc. It won’t just be football, everything from: Japanese chambara movies, MMA, football, you name it, will be covered as I intend on bringing the blog back to its roots again. Let me know what you think of the new graphics as well, I hope that you enjoyed the read, as always hit me up on social media: @aragami9x on both: Instagram & Twitter, and head over to www.foreverfootballshirts.co.uk for your football shirt needs! New arrivals from: Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Barcelona, and the Czech Republic will be on sale tomorrow; and remember the code: FFS10 gets you 10% off your 1st order! Until the next episode;\n\nGood night, and God bless,\n\nSteven,\n\nOSSUUU!!!\n\nHere we are back again! Can you feel it? Can you sense it? That’s right! It’s now time to draw the 2016/17 European football season to a close, and what greater curtain closer is there than a Champions League final between Real Madrid and Juventus to look forward too! If it isn’t apparent already, it shall be now; this is the Origami with Aragami UEFA Champions League final preview! In this edition, I will be reliving the 18 game history between the 2 sides, relive classic ties, look at both side’s run to the final this year, and then what I believe will materialise on June 3rd…\n\nJuventus\n\nVs. Real Madrid\n\nKey Info:\n\n03/06/17 @ The Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, Wales\n\nThe European Cup years…\n\nSo after a gruelling season, the 2016/17 champions of Italy, and Spain (just as they did in 2015) will come together in a clash to determine who shall be crowed the kings of Europe. Juventus were of course beaten by Barcelona that night in Berlin, this time however they will meet a foe that they have played 18 times in the past, a side that they defeated in the semi-final of that very itineration of the competition: Real Madrid. A true European Super-Clasico; the 2 sides first met in the quarter final of the 1961/62 European Cup, and in the days of when a 3rd leg if you will, was required instead of extra-time; Real Madrid armed with Alfredo di Stefano in their ranks would eventually defeat Juventus in the tie breaker in Paris, by 3-1, after respective 1-0 wins in favour of each side. It would end in heartbreak ultimately for ‘Les Merengues’ as Benfica defeated them in the final to retain the European Cup in Amsterdam. 24 years would pass before the 2 sides were re-united, as the last 16 of the 1986/87 European Cup brought them together. In the time that had passed since the last meeting, saw Real Madrid win the 1965/66 competition, and as a result were now 6 time winners of the trophy, and had been winners of the UEFA Cup for each of the last 2 season; however Juventus had just won their first European Cup in 1985, defeating the all-conquering Liverpool in the infamous final in Brussels that year. Real Madrid were armed with legends: Manuel Sanchis, Jose Camacho, Chendo, Michel, Jorge Valdano, Hugo Sanchez, and Emilio Butragueno, while Juventus had amongst their ranks: Stefano Tacconi, Antonio Cabrini, Sergio Brio, Michael Laudrup, and of course 3 time Ballon d’Or winner: Michel Platini. Again, the 2 sides would split respective 1-0 wins over both legs, and again, it would be ultimately Real Madrid who would progress at the expense of ‘I Bianconeri’, this time in the form of a penalty shootout, where Real Madrid won 3-1 again ironically. In another ironic occurrence, a Portuguese side would ultimately be crowned as European champions that season, as FC Porto stunned Bayern Munich to lift their 1st European Cup; Real Madrid incidentally were defeated by Bayern Munich in the semi-final as their long wait for a 7th title continued.\n\nThe Juventus glory years…\n\n10 years later, the European Cup would be rebranded as the UEFA Champions League, still though, neither Juventus nor Real Madrid had come any closer to winning the trophy; Juve’ however were beginning something of a dynasty as they captured the 1990, and 1993 UEFA Cup’s, while finishing runners-up in the 1995 edition. By the 1995/96 season, Marcelo Lippi’s forces saw bigger fish to fry in the form of the Champions League, standing in front of them in the quarter-final however would be Real Madrid. Michael Laudrup who once proudly wore the black and white stripes of Juventus, was now amongst the Real Madrid starting XI that welcomed Juventus to the Santiago Bernabeu on March 5th 1996, however it was Real Madrid’s young assassin: Raul, who would score the decisive goal in what was a 1-0 win in favour of ‘Los Blancos’, the 5th score-line of that kind in the space of 6 meetings together. At Stadio Delle Alpi, Juventus would not be stopped as their own young assassin: Alessandro Del Piero got the home side on level footing on aggregate, before Michele Padovano scored the winner, in a game that ended with both teams having a man sent off. Juve would ultimately line up against Louis van Gaal’s Ajax in the May 22nd finale in Rome, and 21 years after first winning the European Cup; Juventus would once again sit atop of the football world, as they dethroned the pride of the Netherlands by way of a 4-2 penalty shootout win, after the scores were tied 1-1 after 120 minutes.\n\nRecognised as the most feared side on the continent; Juventus were the envy of a Real Madrid side who fell to a disastrous 6th finish in La Liga at the end of the 1995/96 season, meaning that they would not be playing any European football in the 1996/97 season. Sadly for Marcelo Lippi, and his charges, they would reach the 1997 final in Munich, as Borussia Dortmund stunned the defending European champions 3-1 in the finale. On a domestic level however, both Juventus, and Real Madrid were crowned as the champions of their respective leagues, and fate would conspire to bring the 2 European powerhouses together for that seasons Champions League final in Amsterdam. Juup Heynckes side’s season rested on lifting ‘La Septima’ after another disappointing league tenure. In the semi-final, Real Madrid would defeat the defending champions: Borussia Dortmund, in order to contest their first final since 1981; while Juventus in now their 3rd straight final, and 6th overall, eliminated Monaco (just as they would do 19 years later) to reach the final. The last bastion of the Juve-era in the 90’s would end once in heartbreak as Real Madrid won by would you know it, a 1-0 win to become 7 time European Champions. A look back at the squads that evening really illustrates the quality on display, with Juventus boasting: Angelo Peruzzi, Paolo Montero, Mark Iuliano, Angelo di Livio, Didier Deschamps, Zinedine Zidane, Edgar Davids, Filippo Inzaghi, and Alessandro Del Piero in their starting line-up, while Real Madrid’s side featured: Roberto Carlos, Fernando Hierro, Manuel Sanchis (who of course played in the 1986 meeting), Christian Panucci, Fernando Redondo, Clarence Seedorf, Christian Karembeu, Raul, Fernando Morientes, and the match winner: Pedrag Mijatovic.\n\nThe Real Madrid glory years…\n\nAlthough the final Champions League of the 20th century would see neither side in the final, as Real Madrid bowed out in the quarter-final, while Juve’ fell in the semi-final; Real Madrid’s 1998 glory would begin a reign of European dominance for the Spanish side, as they captured the title in both the years: 2000, and 2002; defeating Valencia, and Bayer Leverkusen respectively to become a record 9 time winners of the title. At the start of the new millennium, Fiorentino Perez’ appointment as the club’s chairman, saw the club’s ‘Galactico’ recruitment policy take shape, and after the capture of Luis Figo shattered the world transfer record, just over a year later, that record would once again be decimated as Real Madrid purchased Zinedine Zidane from Juventus in the summer of 2001 for a fee of €77.5 million, and ‘Zizou’ would seal Real Madrid their Champions League triumph in Glasgow in 2002. The summer Zidane left Turin, would also see the return of Marcelo Lippi in the Juventus dug out, and after narrowly missing out on the Serie A crown for each of the 3 seasons under Carlo Ancelotti, Lippi returned Juventus to the summit of Italy as Roma were dethroned in 2002, and as I’m sure you can imagine, the next step for ‘I Bianconeri’ was an assault at the Champions League. The semi-final of the 2002/03 competition would bring 2 old foes together once again for their respective 8th, and 9th clashes in the Champions League, and for a 3rd straight collsion at the Santiago Bernabeu; Real Madrid would prevail, however David Trezeguet’s away goal in Spain, laid the foundations for a virtuoso performance in Turin, where a seemingly possessed Pavel Nedved inspired Juventus to a 3-1 win over Vicente del Bosque’s side, to reach the Old Trafford final. In another stinging twist of fate for Juventus, they would suffer more heart-break in the final of the Champions League, as AC Milan, now coached by Carlo Ancelotti, defeated them in a penalty shoot-out after a goalless 120 minutes; Juventus’ run in Champions League final now stood at 2 wins and 5 losses; furthermore, neither themselves, nor Real Madrid would reach another Champions League final for 11 long, and hard years for both clubs.\n\nThe years in perdition, followed by a return to glory…\n\nIt wouldn’t take long for the next Real Madrid vs Juventus pairing to take place, as they were reacquainted in the round of 16 in the 2004/05 campaign. Now under Fabio Capello’s tutelage; the former Real Madrid manager’s side were favourites against a Real Madrid side who were now under the command of Wanderlei Luxemburgo, the clubs 3rd appointment that season. The first leg ended again with the victory of Real Madrid, as Ivan Helguera’s first half header was enough to separate the 2 sides at the Santiago Bernabeu. Real Madrid came with 15 minutes of sealing a goalless draw that would have taken them to the last 8, however David Trezeguet’s effort would level proceedings, before Marcelo Zalayeta’s extra time winner condemned Real Madrid to the first of 6 straight last 16 exits in the competition. Juventus would suffer a much worse immediate future however, after winning the 2005-06 Serie A (a season that saw Arsenal knock-out both: Real Madrid and Juventus that season en route to the Champions League final), the club found themselves in the eye of the Calciopoli Scandal; the fallout of which saw them stripped of both titles won under Capello, as well as the indignation of relegation to Serie B. Exploiting the scenario; Real Madrid pried the signatures of Capello himself, as well as Fabio Cannavaro, and Emerson ahead of the 2006-07 season, and while Real Madrid reclaimed La Liga glory, Juventus, under the stewardship of their former midfield lynchpin: Didier Deschamps, would win Serie B, and return to the Italian top flight for the 2007-08 season. The 2008-09 season would see both sides paired in Group H of the Champions League, and with Claudio Ranieri at the helm, Juventus would finally beat Real Madrid both home, and away, with Juve’ winning 2-1 at the Olimpico in Torino, before an Alessandro Del Piero masterclass at the Santiago Bernabeu earnt him a round of applause from the ‘Madristas’ for his fantastic brace which led them to a 2-0 win in Spain. Both sides would ultimately qualify from the group with 12 points, only to meet their demise in the last 16 at the hands of: Chelsea, and Liverpool respectively.\n\n5 years would pass until the next time the 2 proud clubs would clash swords, in those ensuing years: Real Madrid had disposed of: Berndt Schuster, Juande Ramos, Manuel Pellegrini, and then Jose Mourinho after a 3 season spell, before appointing Carlo Ancelotti ahead of the 2013-14 season. Finally snapping their run of last 16 exits, Real Madrid were beaten semi-finalists in each of the last 2 seasons, and the Italian with his 2 previous Champions League triumphs with AC Milan, was charged with delivering ‘La Decima’, 12 years after last winning the European Cup. Juventus, had overseen 2 seasons of transition where after Claudio Ranieri left: Ciro Ferrara, Alberto Zaccheroni, and Luigi del Neri could only muster 2 7th places finishes each, it was time for a change, and like a phoenix from the flames; Juventus would become the standard bearer for Italian football again with Antonio Conte at the helm. Real Madrid began the 2013-14 Champions League campaign with a 6-1, and 4-0 win over Galatasaray, and FC Copenhagen respectively, while Juventus could only muster draws with both of those sides, before ultimately falling 2-1 at the Bernabeu on October 23rd 2013. In their first taste of the fury otherwise known as Cristiano Ronaldo; the Portuguese scored a fine first half brace in Madrid, either side of Fernando Llorente’s 14th minute strike to claim the 3 points on an evening that also saw Giorgio Chiellini sent off for Juventus. A fortnight later at the Juventus Stadium, a thrilling 2-2 draw played out, with Arturo Vidal giving Juve a lead just before half-time, before Ronaldo, and Gareth Bale had Real Madrid 2-1 ahead on the hour mark, only for Llorente to strike 5 minutes later as Juventus’s qualification hopes were reduced to a canter following the draw. As Real Madrid emphatically won the group, Juventus were forced to play Galatasaray on a Thursday afternoon, after snow in Turkey postponed the clash. The final match-day would see Wesley Sneijder, formerly of Inter Milan, score the winning goal for the Turkish side as Juventus were relegated to Europa League football for the remainder of the 2013-14 season. Juve’ would reach the semi-final before being defeated by Benfica 2-1 over 2 legs. Real Madrid on the other hand would achieve ‘La Decima’ under the most dramatic of circumstances; having drawn inner-city rivals Atletico Madrid in the Lisbon finale; Diego Simeone’s side were moments away from being crowned as European champions for the first time, before Sergio Ramos’ stoppage time equaliser dragged the time into extra-time, where Gareth Bale, Marcelo, and Cristiano Ronaldo scored to condemn Atletico Madrid to a 4-1 defeat, and more importantly secure that elusive 10th European title for Real Madrid.\n\nAs Real Madrid were the toast of the football world, Juventus would be rocked by the unexpected departure of Antonio Conte that summer, and in what looked at the time as an arrangement inspired by haste; Massimiliano Allegri was appointed as the Juventus manager, much to the behest of the Juventus faithful. Fast forward to May 2015, and his Juventus side were closing in on a 4th straight Serie A title, had a Copa Italia final to look forward too, and after eliminating both: Borussia Dortmund, and AS Monaco, found themselves in the semi-final of the Champions League for the first time since 2003, I wonder if you can guess who would be opposing them? That’s right, it was Real Madrid. The defending European champions began the 2014/15 season in devastating fashion; sweeping up the: UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup; however the 2015 portion of the season would see a downslide in form as Barcelona overtook them at the top of La Liga. After scraping past Schalke in the round of 16, they would eliminate Atletico Madrid in the quarter final, they would battle Juventus for the opportunity to defend their title in the Berlin final that year. Alvaro Morata, a Champions League winner with Real Madrid just 12 months earlier, now of Juventus, would give his new side a 9th minute lead, before Ronaldo equalised less than 20 minutes later for the visitors. In the end, a Carlos Tevez penalty would swing the tie in the favour of the Italians, however with Real Madrid in possession of the away goal, the defending European champions were still in pole position to meet Barcelona in Berlin on June 6th. Ronaldo would score for a 4th straight game against Juventus, with his 23rd minute penalty putting Real Madrid ahead on the night, and on away goals; however Morata would prove to be the scourge of Real Madrid’s ‘Un-Decima’ dream, as his equaliser ensured that the game ended 1-1, and more importantly, 3-2 on aggregate in favour of Juventus, sending the ‘the Old Lady’ to an 8th European Cup final. In another story of sorrow; Juventus would be outclassed by Barcelona that night in Berlin, and although Morata scored in the final to briefly level matters at a goal apiece; Barcelona would eventually triumph 3-1 to become 5 time European champions, while Juve’ were now a 4 match final losing streak., however on Saturday evening, they have the chance to end 21 years of agony.\n\nThe following season saw Real Madrid replace Carlo Ancelotti with Rafa Benitez, while a series of changes at Juventus saw: Arturo Vidal, Andrea Pirlo, and Carlos Tevez leave the club after the final. A final match-day defeat to Sevilla for Juventus meant that they would finish second in their group, and as a result, draw Bayern Munich in the last 16 of the competition, and in the end Juventus would be eliminated by the German side for the second meeting in a row, this time in a 6-4 aggregate defeat in what was truly a war of attrition between 2 of the continents 5 best teams. Real Madrid by contrast would reach the final for the second time in 3 years; taking out a relatively easily stream of: AS Roma, Wolsfburg, and then Manchester City, before defeating Atletico Madrid once again in the Milan finale, albeit this time by virtue of an intense penalty shoot-out. La Un-Decima was achieved! The newly minted 11 time European champions, after 12 years of separation from the continents greatest crown; Real Madrid had now won the tournament twice in the space of 3 years; echoing their great run of 3 Champions League titles between 1998 and 2002. The achievement was made even sweeter not only due to the win coming over their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid; more so however because the man who led them to glory was none other than their former ‘Galactico’ extraordinaire: Zinedine Zidane, with the Frenchman taking over in January from Rafa Benitez, he steered the club to within a point of upsetting Barcelona in La Liga, however more impressively was his masterminding of the knockout stages, and capturing the European holy-grail.\n\nThe Road to Cardiff: Juventus…\n\nJuventus’ journey to the Cardiff finale really began last summer, shortly after the close of the 2015/16 season. Knowing that Paul Pogba would than likely be on his way out of the club, the ever shrewd businessmen that they are, ensured that Manchester United would be forced to break the world transfer record to land the Frenchman back, and €105 million later, Pogba would bid farewell after 4 hugely successful seasons in Turin. His departure was overshadowed however (at least at the Juventus Stadium), by the recruitment policy that summer; in one of the best examples of a masterful summer transfer window; Juve invested in all areas of their squad, signing: Dani Alves on a free transfer from Barcelona, as well as weakening their 2 biggest rivals in Roma and Napoli by securing the services of: Miralem Pjanic, and Gonzalo Higuain respectively, the latter becoming the clubs most expensive ever purchase at a staggering €90 million. Moreover, Juan Cuadrado’s ‘loan’ spell was extended for another season, while Medhi Benatia was also sourced from Bayern Munich on loan. I truly believe, that it was after being beaten by Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, that Max Allegri and Juve brass identified the need to have a huge squad that is bustling with talent, quality, and experience in every department, and now 13 months after that realisation, we see the bearing fruit of that epiphany. The club would also learn the value of ensuring they finish at the top of their group after last season’s draw with Bayern, and after being drawn with: Sevilla, Lyon, and Dinamo Zagreb; nothing less than an emphatic finish was expected. A match-day 1 goalless draw with Sevilla was somewhat disappointing, however back to back away wins against Dinamo Zagreb, and Lyon followed. A second home draw would unfold as Corentin Tolisso secured a late equaliser for Lyon at the Juventus Stadium on match-day 4, however an emphatic 3-1 win over Sevilla at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, meant that a win at home to the Croatian champions on the final match-day would secure them 1st place in the group. Gonzalo Higuain, and Daniele Rugani ensured that in a 2-0 win, however with: Paris Saint Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Manchester City all finishing 2nd in their respective groups, a scrap with one of Europe’s elite potentially lay in wait for the Italian champions in the round of 16.\n\nFortuitously, Juventus would avoid any of those 4 European juggernauts, and instead draw FC Porto in the last 16. The Portuguese side, despite being restricted to 10 men after 27 minutes, would hold out until an inspired double substitution which saw: Dani Alves, and Marko Pjaca enter the fray, and subsequently, both men would score a goal apiece with 2 minutes of each other to give Juventus a 2-0 win at the Estadio do Dragao. A Paulo Dybala penalty would be enough to seal a 1-0 win in the 2nd leg, however their reward in the quarter final would be a tie against none other than their vanquishers in the 2015 final: Barcelona. The football world was gushing after Barcelona’s legendary comeback against Paris Saint Germain, however to those in the know, they knew that Barca’ were on the ropes, none more so than Allegri himself, who managed an AC Milan side that were on the receiving end of a Barcelona comeback story back in 2013. Progression to the semi-final over Barcelona would be akin to hitting 2 birds with 1 stone, as it would not only extract a measure of revenge for the 2015 Champions League final defeat, but also lay a marker of their intent as far as their Champions League aspirations were concerned. April 11th would represent all of that and then some, as Juventus throttled Barcelona 3-0 at the Juventus Stadium in an exhilarating display, before becoming the first side to stop Barcelona scoring at the Camp Nou in the Champions League since Bayern Munich did back in 2013, as they secured a 0-0 draw in the second leg, to reach the semi-final. Standing between them, and a place in Cardiff where a maverick Monaco side looked to avenge to previous knock-out losses to ‘I Bianconeri’ from the 1997-98, and 2014-15 seasons, ironically both seasons in which Juventus reached the final and lost.\n\nNot even the swashbuckling forces of the French champions with: Kylian Mbappe and Radamel Falcao could do anything the Juventus juggernaut, as a masterful return to a 3-5-2 nullified the Monaco threat, while Gonzalo Higuain, still facing criticism from certain critics after his huge move from Napoli, vindicated every penny of Juve’s outlay, as he notched a classy brace at the Stade Louis II to give his side 2 away goals to take back to Turin for the second leg. 6 days later, Juventus would cement their place in the final as they defeated Monaco 2-1 at the Juventus Stadium on May 9th. Wrote off by Barcelona as being over the hill, Dani Alves continued to prove his former employers wrong; firstly scoring in Portugal in the last, and then keeping Neymar at bay in the quarter-final, Alves would net a scintillating strike to put Juve’ 2-0 ahead just before half-time. The only blemish would be that Gianluigi Buffon would finally concede a Champions League goal after nearly 700 minutes without being breached. It mattered not however, as he would be getting a 3rd chance to win the UEFA Champions League, come June 3rd…\n\nThe Road to Cardiff: Real Madrid…\n\nWas Zinedine Zidane the next coming of Pep Guardiola, or was he just going to be another Roberto di Matteo? However the season was going to unfold, ‘Zizou’ was going to do it on his terms, and it was going to be his way. The summer’s spend went exclusively on sourc"
