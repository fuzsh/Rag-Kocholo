But your argument is totally off chart!\n\nNow let me explain the FACT (about your \"friendly goals\" of Pele)\n\nPele was the ONLY player that FIFA had granted the label 1000's goals scored (out of 5 names who did accumulate that number: Sr Freidenrich, Biscan, Muller and Romario) . WHY?\n\nFirs and foremost, it's NOT because FIFA loved Pele NOR they tried to promote a \"black guy\" like many \"ignorant\" claimed around, but there are several reasons:\n\n1- Those friendly (like Greg did a good sum up) games were happened in a TENSION and PRESSURE ambiance (not like any friendly games now aday) . For most Euro teams at time were so curious to challenge the so called \"King\" who they did not really buy into! Also, that era (60's) there are NO LAWS to protect attackers and most DF were ready to DETHRONE Pele's label.\n\n2- At that time, Pele had won WC58 (and 2nd in 62), and a few Paulista (unofficial best team in Brazil) and not every players teams (at time) had chance to watch him or Santos playing! So the Euro teams were ready to DEMOLISH a (no name) club with a so called \"best player\" from the other half of the Earth! (note that in that era no law of protection for Attacker so DF had all MEANS to disturb/chop down the KID (he was only 17-20)\n\n3- Beside those scenarios, Pele was PROVEN with his STATS (>1.2GPG which was great and RARE at time ) for whole 10 consecutive years, against any teams (SA or Europe) , in any tournaments (Brazil Euro Copa WC) = meaning regardless friendly or not, PELE will SCORE goals!\n\n4- LAstly, moving on , Pele won 2 libertadores and \"demolished \" two best EC winners to win 2 intercontinental cups, and by 70, his STATS presented a 1.4 GPG vs 40+ European teams (from EPL, Liga, Hungary, SerieA, Bundesliga, Hungary, Greece, Austia ....)\n\nBased of those 4: FIFA ACCEPTED those \"extra 200+ goals\" (from friendlies) to Pele's 800's official goals = 1000+goals career!\n\nJamesBH11's views make a lot of sense.Back then both America and Europe represented two rather markedly different footballing cultures.They had their own playing styles,tactics,there were even differences over which tackle qualified as a foul.\n\nThey had their own set of top teams,great players,legends and so on.Both sides would have been a proud lot of their footballing standards/accomplishments.Hence a game between Pele's Santos and any Euro team would definitely have evoked a lot of curiosity/interest not just amongst the people of either continent but also amongst the players too.The organizers just tapped into this.That's why Euro tours by Santos and other Brazilian club teams including Bota of Garincha happened in the first place.In the event of such a match,friendly or official,there would have been a healthy rivalry/competition between the teams/players.An opportunity to test skills for both sides\n\nTherefore the backdrop was quite different from what it is now when a friendly happens between two Euro club teams.\n\nThis point leads to a question.If the defence wasn't serious enough to stop the attackers then the same should apply for the attackers too.They too wouldn't be seriously motivated to score.By this logic it would mean that this good showing of Pele against Euro teams was that of a non serious Pele.By extension,it would mean a serious Pele would have done far greater damage.\n\nHere is my short take in all of this.\n\nMany people cannot, for whatever reason give players from earlier generations their just due. I have often listened to many people say that Pele played against farmers in South America and with the statistical proof here against European clubs the argument against his greatness has to degrade to the opposition never tried.\n\nPlayers of beltgone eras are never given credit for their skills or athleticism since it is not possible to some they could ever compete today though these people never take into consideration the rules that change to make the game safer and easier to score.\n\nPelé was great no matter what the era. I saw him play when he was old when he played for the Cosmos. He was still great. Give him credit or just leave it alone. Nobody ever wins an argument on the Internet.\n\nThat turned out longer than I suspected."
