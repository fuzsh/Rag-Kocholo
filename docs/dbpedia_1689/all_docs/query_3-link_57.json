        "text": "Nicolas Anelka gave Chelsea the lead in the 49th minute, before Didier Drogba marked his return from suspension by converting a penalty he won 13 minutes later.\n\nDefender Branislav Ivanovic headed a third in the 66th minute and concluded the scoring with a neat turn and shot in injury-time. Nikita Bazhenov's 86th-minute goal was little consolation for Spartak.\n\nThe victory was a fourth in four games for Carlo Ancelotti's team, all but assuring top spot in Group F with two games to spare.\n\nMarseille produced the performance of the night to boost their hopes of qualification with a stunning 7-0 away win against MSK Zilina, with Andre Pierre Gignac's hat-trick the highlight.\n\nGignac scored twice inside the first 21 minutes and further efforts from Gabriel Heinze (24) and Loic Remy (36) made it 4-0 at half-time.\n\nLucho Gonzalez got a fifth six minutes after the restart, Gignac wrapped up his treble with a 54th-minute header, before Lucho completed the scoring in the 63rd minute.\n\nThe French side now face a fight with Spartak Moscow for the second qualifying spot with both spots locked on six points.\n\nGroup H is a much tighter affair with Shakhtar Donetsk ending Arsenal's domination of the group and Braga sealing hapless Partizan Belgrade's fate in the competition.\n\nTheo Walcott gave the Gunners a 10th-minute lead but Craig Eastmond's own goal levelled matters in the 28th minute, then former Arsenal favourite Eduardo sealed a 2-1 win just before half-time as the Ukrainian side join Arsene Wenger's men on nine points.\n\nThe result gives Braga hope of qualifying - they owed their 1-0 win in Serbia to Moises' 35th-minute goal.\n\nReal Madrid lost their 100 percent record in Group G - but an injury-time goal goal from substitute Pedro Leon earned them a 2-2 draw with AC Milan which carries them into the last 16.\n\nGonzalo Higuain's goal on the stroke of half-time gave Jose Mourinho's men the lead but Filippo Inzaghi netted twice in the space of 10 minutes to turn things around at the San Siro.\n\nHowever, Leon's late breakthrough make sure of Real's progress, leaving the Italian giants facing a tense bid to qualify.\n\nAuxerre defeated Ajax 2-1 to keep alive their hopes of an extended run in the competition - and dent the Dutch side's hopes of progressing.\n\nFrederic Sammaritano scored the night's fastest goal in the ninth minute and although Toby Alderweireld levelled 10 minutes from time, Steven Langil got the French side's winner four minutes later.\n\nMario Gomez impressed as Bayern Munich made sure of top spot in Group E with a convincing 4-0 defeat of Cluj.\n\nGomez scored a hat-trick, netting in the 12th, 24th and 70th minutes, before Thomas Muller rounded off a fourth success in as many games for the visitors.\n\nRoma are best placed to join the German side in the last 16 after prevailing 3-2 in an entertaining game with Basle.\n\nJeremy Menez (16), Francesco Totti (26, penalty) and substitute Leandro Greco (70) netted for the victors, with Alexander Frei (69) and Xherdan Shaqiri (83) replying for the Swiss hosts, who had Valentin Stocker dismissed in injury-time when he picked up a second yellow card.\n\nGroup A\n\nFC Cluj 0\n\nBayern Munich 4 (Gomez 12, 24, 71, Muller 90)\n\nFC Basel 2 (Frei 69, Shagiri 83)\n\nAS Roma 3 (Menez 16, Totti 25p, Greco 76)\n\nGroup B\n\nChelsea 4 (Anelka 49, Drogba 62p, Ivanovic 66, 90)\n\nSpartak Moscow 1 (Bezhenov 86)\n\nMSK Zilina 0\n\nMarseille 7 (Gignac 12, 21, 54, Heinze 24, Remy 36, Gonzalez 51, 63)\n\nGroup C\n\nAC Milan 2 (Inzaghi 68, 78)\n\nReal Madrid 2 (Higuain 45, Leon 90)\n\nAuxerre 2 (Sammaritano 9, Langil 84)\n\nAjax 1 (Alderweireld 79)\n\nGroup D\n\nPartizan Belgrade 0\n\nBraga 1 (Moises 35)"
