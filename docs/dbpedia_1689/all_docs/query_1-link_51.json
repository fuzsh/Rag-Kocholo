        "text": "Former Liverpool starlet Liam Millar is expected to leave Basel this summer - and the Reds are set to profit\n\nLiverpool could pocket a small windfall this summer as one of the Reds’ former academy stars eyes a return to England.\n\nLiam Millar left Liverpool this summer to join Basel in a £1.3m move in July 2021, having made just one appearance for the Reds after joining from Fulham in 2016. Signing a four-year deal, he shone in his first season in Switzerland as he returned 10 goals and five assists from 46 appearances and also caught the eye in the Europa Conference League.\n\n‌\n\nHowever, he’d struggle to replicate such returns during the 2022/23 campaign. And while he’d represent Canada at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, he went on to spend last season on loan with Preston North End.\n\nREAD MORE: Mohamed Salah signed for Saudi club leaving Brazilian team-mate confused\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool announce major new sponsorship deal after five year absence and £272m milestone\n\n‌\n\nLiverpool Echo Icon\n\nSign up to FREE email alerts from Analysing Anfield\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you’ve consented to and improve our understanding of you.

More info\n\nThe 24-year-old, who is currently away at the Copa America and started Canada’s opening defeat to Argentina, impressed with the Championship side as he returned five goals and five assists from 36 appearances. And such displays have earned him further Championship interest with a return to England on the cards as a result.\n\nWith a year left on his Basel deal, the Athletic reports that Millar has a release clause in his contract and a move seems ‘all but a sure thing’ as a result. While Premier League sides are claimed to have expressed interest, they report that Championship sides Burnley, Leeds United and Sheffield United are among those tracking Millar heavily through Copa America.\n\nShould Millar make such a transfer this summer, Liverpool would be set to profit. When selling the Canadian to Basel, the Reds received roughly £800,000 upfront with the rest payable in performance-related add-ons.\n\n‌\n\nMeanwhile, Michael Edwards negotiated a 20 percent sell-on clause as part of the deal, ensuring the Reds would receive a significant proportion of any profit the Swiss club made if they ever sell Millar.\n\nWhile Basel won’t receive a ground-breaking fee due to his expiring contract status, they can expect to make a profit on the forward. However, the unspecified release clause would seemingly limit how much they can expect to pocket, with Liverpool in line for a small windfall from any sale as a result."
