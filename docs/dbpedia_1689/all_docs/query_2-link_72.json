        "text": "EuroFootball/Getty Images\n\nAfter a furious two days of soccer, Matchday 3 of Champions League play saw a few groups tighten up.\n\nIn Group E, Chelsea's big 3-0 win over FC Schalke 04 has the two clubs locked with six points at the top of the table, and that isn't even the tightest race in group play.\n\nSurging Arsenal fell to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. Both now have six points. Along with Napoli, there is now a three-way logjam at the top of that group.\n\nGet a closer look at those two groups and all the rest in the complete Champions League standings after the completion of Matchday 3.\n\nGroup A Pos.TeamPointsGD1Manchester United732Bayer Leverkusen633Shakhtar Donetsk4-24Real Sociedad0-4\n\nManchester United is scuffling in Premier League play, but a 1-0 win over Real Sociedad on an own goal by Inigo Martínez keeps the Red Devils atop the Group A table.\n\nHowever, the Red Devils remain just a point clear of Bayer Leverkusen after Leverkusen cruised to a 4-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday.\n\nGroup BPos.TeamPointsGD1Real Madrid9102Galatasaray4-33Juventus2-14FC Copenhagen1-6\n\nCristiano Ronaldo picked up a brace on Wednesday while lifting Real Madrid to a 2-1 win over Juventus. Los Blancos remain in full control of this group with a perfect record and a five-point lead over Galatasaray.\n\nGalatasaray ensured their deficit would not grow with a dominant 3-1 win over FC Copenhagen.\n\nGroup CPos.TeamPointsGD1Paris Saint-Germain9112Olympiacos403Benfica4-14Anderlecht0-10\n\nZlatan Ibrahimovic picked up four scores on Wednesday, as he led PSG to a easy 5-0 win over an Anderlecht side that is still looking for their first points.\n\nMeanwhile, with Benfica and Olympiacos battling to a 1-1 draw on Wednesday, PSG's lead in the table has extended to five points.\n\nGroup DPos.TeamPointsGD1Bayern Munich9102Manchester City623CSKA Moscow3-34Viktoria Plzen0-9\n\nManchester City and Bayern Munich both took away three points on Wednesday to keep Munich three points clear of City in the table.\n\nMunich cruised to a 5-0 win over Viktoria Plzen. This improves the German's side goal differential to plus-10.\n\nMeanwhile, City fell behind 1-0 after Zoran Tosic got CSKA Moscow on the board first. City fired off two unanswered goals, both by Sergio Agüero, to take the 2-1 win.\n\nGroup EPos.TeamPointsGD1Chelsea662FC Schalke 04613FC Basel404Steaua Bucuresti1-7\n\nChelsea jumped to the top of the table with a statement 3-0 victory over Schalke on Tuesday. Chelsea has been offensively explosive in recent play and Schalke felt the brunt of that. Fernando Torres netted two goals in the contest—the first coming just five minutes in.\n\nMeanwhile, Basel blew a chance to join the pack with six points after a late goal by Leandro Tatu allowed Steaua Bucuresti to earn a draw.\n\nGroup FPos.TeamPointsGD1Borussia Dortmund632Arsenal623Napoli604Marseille0-5\n\nA loaded Group F got even tighter after Tuesday's play. Robert Lewandowski netted the winning goal for Borussia Dortmund in the 82 minute to send red-hot Arsenal to a 2-1 defeat. This was a nice away win for Dortmund. It gives them the inside track in the group, but this tight race is just getting started.\n\nWith Napoli pushing for a 2-1 win over Marseille and moving to six points, there is a logjam at the top of the table.\n\nGroup GPos.TeamPointsGD1Atletico Madrid962Zenit St. Petersburg4-13FC Porto3-14Austria Wien1-4\n\nAtletico Madrid has yet to drop a point and is in commanding lead of this group after a 3-0 victory over Austria Wien on Tuesday.\n\nZenit St. Petersburg earned three points to move into second after Aleksandr Kerzhakov scored the only goal of the match in the 85th minute to lead his side to a 1-0 win over FC Porto.\n\nGroup HPos.TeamPointsGD1Barcelona752AC Milan523Celtic3-24Ajax1-5\n\nAfter goals by Robinho and Lionel Messi in the first 23 minutes of action, Barcelona and AC Milan played the rest of the match scoreless. Playing in San Siro, AC Milan needed three points to put the pressure on Barcelona for the remainder of group play, but they sit just two points back and in second place."
