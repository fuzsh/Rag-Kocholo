        "text": "Premier League target settled in homeland.\n\nCheck in to Transfer Window: Done Deal Alerts\n\nInternacional striker Leandro Damiao has said that he is happy to remain in Brazil beyond the summer despite interest from overseas, Sky Sports reports.\n\nAll throughout the transfer window the 24-year-old has been linked with a move to the likes of Tottenham, Southampton, Arsenal and Liverpool, with Brendan Rodgers’ men being the latest to show an interest.\n\nBoth Spurs and Southampton have tried unsuccessfully to work deals for the Brazilian international, and he has now hinted that it would take a huge offer to get him to even consider leaving his current club now.\n\n“The first time I was sounded out, I was happy, but I have to overcome that now – I am focused on Internacional – it has to be a good offer for me and the club,” he told UOL.\n\n“A lot was said. I am calm, nothing has come and I am still focused on Internacional and in the Brazilian Cup.\n\n“If a very good offer comes, then maybe it could happen.”\n\nInternacional president Giovanni Luigi also spoke about the striker’s future, insisting that the club had not received any recent bids.\n\n“There have been no contacts in the last 15 days, not even speculation,” said Luigi.\n\n“Many times an agent comes and tries to make conversation between the clubs but we haven’t even had that.\n\n“Everything indicates that Leandro Damiao will stay.”"
