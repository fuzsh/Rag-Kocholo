        "text": "PREFACE\n\nWhat is it like to support a team that never wins?\n\nI asked this question to football fans all around Europe during a 50-day trip attending games. However, what I quickly discovered is that there is no single answer. And perhaps, more importantly, there is no perfect answer. When we fall in love with a team, normally when we’re young, it’s for a combination of reasons. These reasons may disappear as we get older: supporting a football team is a lifelong commitment that most people are not keen on. However, sometimes those reasons grow even bigger, and they develop into fervent passion. That’s when we’re ready to have our hearts broken.\n\nThe act of supporting a team is not rational, just like when you fall in love with someone. People tend to look for their soulmates through common tastes, in music, movies, books, or even a compatible lifestyle, like if the other person is a night owl or not. And all of a sudden one finds the perfect person, who happens to like fuckin’ James Blunt and Jennifer Aniston movies, while one would rather listen to Slayer all day and watch all the Mad Max sequels. Just like sometimes the football team that you love happens to be absolute shite. True love is like that.\n\nI know how this analogy sounds long-winded to some of you, but diehard football fans will refer to their support as love, which is not something objective that can be explained. Neuroscientists have tried to, and poets have dedicated their lives to it, so I’m guessing you will not find the answers to love in a football book. Nonetheless, here I am and nobody can stop me from trying.\n\nThere is a substantial difference, though, when it comes to loving a football team. It doesn’t require retribution. All the things that we do – attending matches, collecting jerseys, suffering when they lose – revolve around the idea that our team will always be there for us no matter what. Especially during their big losses, that is, when we’ve earned the badge of a true fan. When one is committed to teams that constantly fail, there is a bigger sense of pride, of not jumping on the team bandwagon only when they’re winning.\n\nHowever, this is the trickier part in terms of fan culture. There are fans that beg for retribution. One can even argue that the majority of football fans want retribution. Winning titles is a major factor for so many fans to pick a team to support, especially, but not exclusively, at a young age. Even when we start supporting a traditional club being seen as a sleeping giant. Eventually many of us will ask for something back and there is no shame in admitting it. Regardless of the particular situation, it is the optimism to win one day that keeps us going.\n\nI have chosen small teams from Europe because the leagues’ winners are extremely scarce when compared with others. In Brazil, six different teams have won the league since 2010, for example. Eight different teams have won the Argentine league, and nine different teams have won the Copa Libertadores in the last ten years. Meanwhile in Spain, Real Madrid and Barcelona have won nine of the last ten titles; PSG have won seven of the last eight in France; Bayern Munich won eight straight in Germany; Juventus nine in a row in Italy. Even the English ‘Big Six’ has been reduced to three champions in the last decade. It is unlikely that any of these teams will ever spend more than a couple of seasons without celebrating a trophy. Their fan base is plentiful.\n\nThis is the part of the story where I remember supporters that I spoke with at every stadium. They chanted, and cried, and took me to drink beer so they could endlessly talk about their teams, their fan bases, their region and friends. They could not talk about any titles. It is a very different experience from supporting a big club, where defeats are regarded as humiliations. These fan bases see football through the pain that accompanies the losses. There are millions of people supporting a small team, even if we barely notice them. When someone supports Rayo Vallecano in Madrid, to name just one club that I visited, their choice is not only born out of passion, but an act of resistance. It’s like surviving in a place where they have been left to die. These fan bases are holding an umbrella during a hurricane.\n\nNot only do they support a small team, but the economic gap in modern football has significantly increased in the last years. The difference in budgets has made people adopt slogans such as ‘Against Modern Football’, or to believe that it is ‘more than just football’. However, many of these fan bases covered in this book are not against the modernisation of football per se. It is not only nostalgia. This is literally the only alternative left.\n\nAll the clubs in this book come from cities where they have a much bigger neighbour; they are in the shadow of giants. Clubs like Espanyol, also known as ‘the other team from Barcelona’; Rayo Vallecano, Madrid’s working-class football club; Belenenses, from the historic village of Belém in Lisbon. I have visited three different clubs in London: Millwall, due to their reputation for hooliganism; Fulham, due to their reputation as being a ‘friendly club’; and Leyton Orient, due to their reputation for … well, they have no reputation.\n\nThen I visited Red Star, a traditional and decadent team from Paris; Sparta, a traditional and decadent team from Rotterdam; and 1860 Munich, a traditional and decadent team in Munich. I finished this trip in Turin, where Torino is definitely a club full of glories and tradition, but in a constant fight with their tragic past, and present days of voilà decadence.\n\nI added three more clubs almost literally while packing, either because I heard a fascinating story or – let’s be honest – they were geographically too close to resist attending a match. I visited Queen’s Park from Glasgow, the oldest club in the country; Union Berlin, a former East German team with a legacy of resistance to the socialist regime and the Stasi; and in Hamburg, I went to St. Pauli, a notorious Antifa-supported club.\n\nI spent 1,440 minutes inside football stadiums, watched 15 games and 35 goals scored, with a total attendance of 275,000 fans. This is the equivalent of spending 24 hours straight watching football on TV (and I’m not talking about UEFA Champions League level). I travelled 11,000 kilometres (6,835 miles) on buses, trains, planes and cars, a longer distance than my original flight from São Paulo to Madrid. During the coldest evenings, watching some matches reminded me of how I used to feel when I needed to work extra hours after a long carnival weekend of drinking and partying, that feeling of ‘I really want to go home’.\n\nAnd why did I do it exactly? Well, because I am a football fanatic capable of watching Tahiti vs New Caledonia at 4am for no reason. Moreover, however, I am a diehard fan of a football team. Don’t get me wrong, but enjoying the beautiful game and supporting a team is not the same thing. There is a subtle but fundamental difference when we feel like we are part of the game, like the indescribable anxiety before a penalty shoot-out only when our team is involved.\n\nI don’t support a small team myself, in case you’re wondering. I grew up in the Porto Alegre area as an Internacional fan following in the steps of my father, who passed away when I was little. Recently, Inter won the Copa Libertadores twice, and they won three leagues in the 1970s. When I began attending games aged 12, however, this success was remote. The team was rubbish for more than a decade and I felt trapped, with my entire youth supporting a team with useless hope, and to make matters worse, our biggest rivals in the city, Grêmio (argh!), had won everything that was possible. Eventually all that misery and suffering was reversed, as we started winning titles and Grêmio were relegated to the second division twice (too bad, too bad), but all those years I spent attending rainy evening games that we lost to lower-division teams in the Brazilian Cup is what really moulded me into the supporter I am today.\n\nThe entire concept of this book came about as a curiosity to understand the resilience required to support a team that never wins. Where your fearless rivals are Goliath, and you can’t even brag about being David. However, and this is really important, I don’t see these fans as freaks, as though they like to suffer and lose. At the end of the day, they are football fans and support their teams exactly the way I support mine, and some of you who are reading this book would probably do the same. They just happen to support a very small team.\n\nA significant part of the project was to attend games, since watching football at the stadium is where the heart really pulses faster, a feeling that cannot be replicated on live TV. Travelling to watch football games live in the flesh – what a glamorous life! But no, not really. I had a very small budget to begin with, and the original publication in Portuguese was only possible after a successful crowdfunding. (What you’re reading has been translated with small modifications. I have to thank Pitch Publishing for making it happen.) The book was the result of meticulous saving, planning, organisation and, of course, a crazy idea to throw caution to the wind.\n\nBefore and after the trip, I spent countless hours doing research, reading everything possible about these clubs, as I reached out to contacts across the globe. The entire concept – and I must say this again – is to write about fans and their experiences. I did not request press accreditations, but instead I wanted to watch the games where the regular people watch the games. Tracking these fans down was anything but easy, but a fundamental part of this project. The supporters are of different ages and social status, and might be part of ultras groups or not. The stories were written as told by the people, but I’ve included my personal observations. There was a considerable amount of research taken from newspapers, magazines, books and the Internet, and I conducted follow-up interviews with local journalists.\n\nAs this book was first published in Brazil in December 2017, some facts have changed since then (e.g., Queen’s Park are no longer an amateur club, and Union Berlin now play in the Bundesliga) but I preferred not to alter the stories to reflect the sentiments of those fan bases at that particular time (sentiments that might persist even after aspects of their clubs did change).\n\nI did not see any historic games. There were no celebration parades, or players signing multi-million contracts afterwards. These clubs are usually battling against relegation rather than chasing promotion or a title. However, what I’ve learned for sure is that nothing will stop these guys from supporting their teams. I went there to find out why. And hopefully you will enjoy what I uncovered.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nESPANYOL AND THE WONDERFUL MINORITY\n\nReal Madrid 2-0 Espanyol\n\nEstadio Santiago Bernabéu\n\nSaturday, 18 February 2017\n\nLa Liga (First Division)\n\nAttendance: 72,234\n\nThe avenue was blocked for vehicles with barricades and mounted policemen. It is adjacent to the Santiago Bernabéu, and everyone wears a Real Madrid jersey, except for one person. On the pavement, amongst an ocean of white shirts, he seemed to know what nobody else there could: the bus that was about to appear in front of us was not bringing Cristiano Ronaldo, but a large blue coach with the less glamorous Espanyol players instead. Carlos Iglesias, 19, wearing a blue and white jersey with the number 21 on the back, raised his team’s scarf above his head, and then put his fist in the air towards the bus, a powerful gesture.\n\nPeople come from all over the world to see Real Madrid play, which makes the stadium’s surrounding area full of tourists with no clue from where their team’s bus will come. Iglesias was not in Madrid to see the multi-champion Galacticos, but his beloved Espanyol from Barcelona. He lives in Salamanca, a two-hour trip from the capital, where he studies, and this is the first time he will watch an away game at Santiago Bernabéu. ‘I’m here to support Espanyol and Espanyol only, but obviously Real Madrid is normally the team responsible for taking the league title away from them [FC Barcelona],’ he says. ‘I think that being an Espanyol fan is also being anti-Barça because they mistreat us. We need to celebrate when they suffer.’\n\nEspanyol fans hate the big club of Barcelona almost more than they like their own. There is a widespread theory in football circles that Espanyol supporters represent an alliance with the Spanish monarchy (and Madrid) while the FC Barcelona fans are mostly Catalan separatists. Of course, RCD Espanyol’s official name can be translated into English as ‘Royal Spanish’ and the club’s crest is literally a crown, like many other clubs in Spain. However, this is not as simple and binary as it seems and many fans agree to disagree. Espanyol fans have two mantras.\n\nThe first mantra is that they support an apolitical football club. They claim that FC Barcelona use politics as a marketing tool, portraying Espanyol as the city villains. ‘They are obviously a bigger club, but the problem is that our media in Catalonia is all about Barça, Barça and Barça,’ Iglesias says. ‘When it comes to Espanyol, they always have something negative to say, as if we are not a Catalan club. Barça is a very political club and everyone bought into their agenda.’ Iglesias, nevertheless, believes that Catalonia is part of Spain.\n\nThree hours before kick-off, I waited in front of Espanyol’s hotel, a 15-minute walk from the stadium, to meet and greet some fans. There was not much action, but I was able to talk to a group of three students coming from a city outside of Madrid. They wore Espanyol jerseys and also carried a Spanish flag with them, even posing for a photo in front of the parked bus. The bus driver, Jose Manuel Martín, 49, himself a fanatic perico (the Espanyol fans’ nickname, meaning parakeet), was also around smoking, a grey-haired man of few words. He was born and raised in Barcelona and he’s firmly against Catalonia’s independence from Spain.\n\nIf that was only a myth, all the Espanyol supporters that I came across up until that point proved the opposite. At the same time, this is an away game, at the epicentre of Spanish administration. These days in Barcelona there is a vocal group of pro-independence pericose. However, it is inconceivable for them to even be associated with FC Barcelona fans, even though some of them may share the separatist cause. They don’t consider Barça fans as the spokesmen of the movement. Most supporters would not even admit that FC Barcelona is a local club. This is the second Espanyol fans’ mantra right here: RCD Espanyol is the real Catalan club.\n\nWhen I asked Martín, the grumpy bus driver, about this topic, he had a speech ready. ‘Espanyol was founded by a Catalan student, while Barcelona was founded by a Swiss man with English players,’ he says. ‘We don’t buy successful foreign players to win titles. They [Barcelona supporters] call us anti-Catalonia, but what do they really do for our community instead of just talk?’ This is not as simple and binary as he says either, although he is correct about some FC Barcelona historical facts. It was founded by Joan Gamper, a former player from FC Basel, Switzerland, from whom the club might have taken its iconic colours of blue and garnet (blaugrana) and the crest (the balón). The blue and white from Espanyol, on the other hand, are the colours appearing on the shield of a soldier from the Catalans’ army.\n\nIn terms of historical players, FC Barcelona had László Kubala (Hungary), Johan Cruyff (Netherlands), Ronaldinho (Brazil) and Messi (Argentina). But when we think about Espanyol greats, everyone always has a Catalan player in mind. ‘When you talk about Tamudo then you are talking about Espanyol and vice versa,’ Carlos Iglesias says. The retired striker Raúl Tamudo holds the record for the most goals and appearances for Espanyol. He was not only born in Catalonia, but he is the Catalan-born footballer with the most goals scored in Spanish La Liga history with 146.\n\nTamudo and Espanyol were predestined for each other. He scored in his first professional game at the age of 19; he scored in two Copa del Rey Finals (a cup title ending 60 years of drought); he scored in all three stadiums that Espanyol has called home. And he scored a goal that made him revered by any perico supporter. That goal he scored against Barça.\n\nEspanyol faced their local rivals at Camp Nou in June 2007, and with only two games left to play in the league, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona were level on points. Barça led Espanyol 2-1 after two goals scored by a 19-year-old Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid trailed Zaragoza away. Then in the 89th minute, Raúl Tamudo received a ball close to the FC Barcelona box and waited for the goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to come out to meet him, so he could slip the ball home. Real Madrid eventually tied against Zaragoza and became champions in the final round. Raúl Tamudo’s goal was ultimately what really sealed the deal. It has become known as Tamudazo.\n\nThe last-minute goal he scored against Barça was exactly what Tamudo needed to become Espanyol’s top goalscorer in history. Every Espanyol supporter will tell this story as if it was an epic battle from the movie Braveheart. He became a legend not only for his accomplishments wearing the Espanyol jersey, but for taking FC Barcelona’s league title away. Before I even asked, Carlos Inglesias told me why he supports a club that barely fights for big trophies.\n\n‘When you support a club in a city with a gigantic monster on your doorstep, you get to really appreciate the small victories,’ he says. ‘A goal like that one [against Barcelona] is perhaps not much when you support a team that wins the league every year, they [a Barça fan] would forget a week later. But for us that memory [of Tamudo’s goal] is forever.’ At the time I met Carlos, I didn’t have a name for this book, but his speech about the giant stayed with me.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Espanyol began using their motto La força d’un sentiment (The strength of a feeling) in their stadium’s decor, marketing products and a documentary film released in 2011. The idea behind it was to show that their passion is not dependent on championships. They admit that their club is not as big as their rivals, but when Espanyol wins, it is always something special for them. Note: the slogan is in the Catalan language.\n\nIt always seems like Espanyol fans are fighting against their inferiority complex. A tourism campaign made by the regional government of Catalonia sparked a lot of controversy in 2016, after a promotional video ran with the tag line, ‘If you feel FC Barcelona, you feel Catalunya’. Los pericos promptly launched a social media hashtag stating, ‘We feel Samoa’. This is what they must deal with for supporting the other club from Barcelona: it’s anything but easy.\n\nNot long after that video aired, FC Barcelona beat Paris Saint-Germain 6-1 at home, which became a historical comeback in the UEFA Champions League (they lost the first leg 4-0). The president of La Generalitat de Catalunya (head of the regional government), Carles Puigdemont, would say that FC Barcelona’s triumph was an inspiration in Catalonia’s fight for independence. ‘Nothing is impossible,’ he wrote. ‘Barça have just demonstrated this playing football. And Catalonia will demonstrate this by deciding its future,’ he wrote in his Twitter account. In election campaigns, it is totally normal to see politicians wearing Barça jerseys, as if Espanyol voters did not exist.\n\nThe two largest sports"
