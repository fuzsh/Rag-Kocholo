lost to Manchester City.\n\nThe popular duo were spotted preparing at pitchside before kick-off and were met by two content creators.\n\nThe media duo initially approached Wright who greeted them with a big hug and a nice chat.\n\nThey then met Keane who shook their hand in another relatively friendly meeting.\n\nBut one of them tried to get a little too personal to the hard Irishman's liking and went for a hug.\n\nHowever, the legendary United midfielder wasn't as keen and that led to an awkward exchange.\n\nEddie Nketiah offer\n\nMarseille continue to monitor Arsenal ace Eddie Nketiah during

benefit Arsenal, who are chasing Dan Bentley.\n\nSolanke's a Gooner\n\nDespite signing for Spurs, Dominic Solanke once revealed he was an Arsenal fan.\n\nHe once told Match of the Day: \"It would have probably been Arsenal. My Dad was an Arsenal fan, so I used to follow them.\n\n\"I went to a few Emirates Cups back in the day!\"\n\nMerino riddle\n\nMikel Merino was rested from a preseason friendly for Real Sociedad against Union Berlin.\n\nHowever, a day later he was spotted in full training for the LaLiga club.\n\nReports said that it was because he was unfit.\n\nHowever, a conflicting note from Fabrizio Romano suggested he wasn't risked because he's in talks with joining Arsenal.\n\nKiwior interest\n\nJakub Kiwior is a wanted man.\n\nThe Poland defender could find game time hard to come by after the signing of Riccardo Calafiori.\n\nNow Sport Italia report that Inter Milan are interested in signing the Euro 2024 star.\n\nThe move is proposed as a loan - with an option to buy.\n\nToney price\n\nArsenal are now able to buy Ivan Toney for a cut-price £30million, according to reports.\n\nThe Times claims his club Brentford have significantly reduced his fee as his contract runs down.\n\nThe Bees are reluctant to lose their star man for nothing next summer.\n\nMan Utd and Chelsea will also be watching his situation closely, having been previously linked with the England striker.\n\nOx on the move\n\nSHEFFIELD UNITED are making an ambitious move to take Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on loan from Turkish side Besiktas.\n\nThe former Arsenal and Liverpool midfielder, 30, was looking for a Premier League return but may now be open to a top Championship move.\n\nThe Turkish club is reportedly willing to let Oxlade-Chamberlain leave this summer.\n\nEx-England ace Ox played 30 times last term for the Istanbul side after arriving in August.\n\nHe scored four goals and provided one assist during his first year as Besiktas finished sixth in the Super Lig last season.\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain reportedly earns approximately £2.2million per season in Turkey, equating to around £42k per week.\n\nMerino request\n\nAccording to reports, Mikel Merino has asked Real Sociedad not to price him out of a move to Arsenal.\n\nThe Gunners are willing to pay around £25million for the 28-year-old.\n\nHowever, his club are said to want more.\n\nMerino has been left out of Sociedad's recent friendlies, with discussions ongoing.\n\nArteta's role on transfers\n\nIt's Mikel Arteta who plays a vital role on who Arsenal bring in, according to reports.\n\nThe Athletic claim the Spanish boss is a driving force when it comes to transfers, although Sporting Director Edu is in charge of scouting and negotiations.\n\nThe report adds that Riccardo Calafiori was a player Arteta was a fan of.\n\nNelson\n\nReiss Nelson has reportedly been asked to play for Jamaica.\n\nThe Arsenal winger has been capped by England at youth level, but never in the seniors.\n\nNow Steve McLaren is hoping to take advantage of that by asking Nelson to represent the Reggae Boys.\n\nHITC add that the wideman could be tempted.\n\nMerino deal 'imminent'\n\nIt won't be 'if' but more 'when' Mikel Merino will join Arsenal.\n\nFootball.london claim: \"It looks to be a matter of when, not if Arsenal complete the signing of Merino. Though an agreement is yet to have been reached between the two parties, the Spain arriving at Emirates Stadium looks to be close following this major breakthrough.\n\n\"Though there is over 20 days left for a deal to be agreed, the Gunners will be adamant for some major progress to be made over the next 48 hours in order to have Merino in the building before Saturday, August 17.\n\n\"Though Merino actually making his debut in that game is unlikely, given how Arteta has carefully bedded in Riccardo Calafiori, though seeing him in training and helping him develop relationships with his new teammates will be important to achieve as soon as possible.\"\n\nArsenal \"can't win the league without a striker\"\n\nMan Utd legend Dwight Yorke claims Arsenal need to be a striker if they have designs on winning the league.\n\n\"Without a proper striker, Arsenal won’t win the Premier League,\" he told Champions League Betting.\n\n\"Arsenal haven’t been able to finish above Manchester City in the last two years because they haven’t got someone who can stick the ball in the net on a regular basis.\n\n\"If you look throughout the history of the Premier League, the teams who win the league have always got somebody who’s scoring 20 plus goals. It’s not rocket science for Mikel Arteta.\n\n\"They’re supposed to be the experts and have all the data and the know-how and the breakdowns of all the teams that have won the Premier League.\"\n\nZubimendi interest\n\nArsenal were never interested in signing Martin Zubimendi, according to reports.\n\nThe Real Sociedad star is currently in talks with Liverpool over a move.\n\nThe Gunners were said to be interested, but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano suggests that wasn't this summer.\n\nHe said: \"Many clubs tried to convince Martin Zubimendi in the last couple of years - Barcelona, Bayern, Arsenal, many clubs spoke to the player, he wasn’t keen on the move.\n\n\"It’s important to clarify that Arsenal were NEVER negotiating for Zubimendi this summer.\"\n\nMore Arsenal training\n\nSome more pictures from Mikel Arteta's training session as the Gunners prepare for their final pre-season friendly tomorrow.\n\nArsenal take on Lyon at the Emirates Stadium tomorrow afternoon in the Emirates Cup.\n\nCherry picking\n\nTBR Football claim that Bournemouth have made enquiries about Eddie Nketiah with a view to jumping in on his proposed move to Marseille.\n\nNketiah looks set to call time on his spell with Arsenal and it seems the French giants are his most likely destination.\n\nDespite Bournemouth's interest, it's claimed that Nketiah is focused on joining Marseille with boss Roberto de Zerbi pushing hard for the deal.\n\nGunners give Nketiah green light\n\nArsenal are continuing negotiations with Marseille over Eddie Nketiah.\n\nThe Gunners are in talks with the French giants over a season-long loan move with an obligatory fee of around £25m.\n\nMarseille are yet to agree to those terms with discussions ongoing – having initially made an offer of around £17m for the player last month.\n\nPersonal terms are believed to already be in place on a five-year deal.\n\nArteta very involved in transfer dealings\n\nIt was revealed in the Athletic that Mikel Arteta is the driving force behind transfers at Arsenal.\n\nWhile Edu takes charge of most of the scouting and negotiations, the two need joint sign-off on incomings.\n\nCalafiori was a player that Arteta liked greatly and was instrumental in bringing him into the club."
