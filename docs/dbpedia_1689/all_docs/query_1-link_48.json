        "text": "Liverpool are reportedly interested in signing the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Leandro Paredes.\n\nAccording to a report from 90min, the Argentine international is on Jurgen Klopp’s radar, who could look to send Roberto Firmino to the French club as a part of the deal.\n\nIt is no secret that Liverpool will have to improve the midfield options before the summer transfer window closes but Paredes could be an underwhelming signing for them. The Argentine has not been at his best for a while now and he is unlikely to be a massive upgrade on the likes of Jordan Henderson and James Milner.\n\nThe likes of Thiago Alcantara and Naby Keita have been struggling with injury issues ever since they joined the club and it is clear that the Reds cannot rely on them to play on a weekly basis. The Reds will have to bring in more quality and depth at the middle of the park and it remains to be seen whether they can sign a quality midfielder before the window closes.\n\nMeanwhile, Paredes is a target for Italian club Juventus as well and it will be interesting to see where he ends up.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe Argentine is not the only central midfielder Liverpool have been linked with in recent weeks and the likes of Konrad Laimer and Frenkie de Jong are thought to be on their radar as well.\n\nDe Jong was previously linked with a move to Manchester United but the player decided to turn them down because of the absence of Champions League football. Such a problem won’t arise if Liverpool comes calling as they will be able to offer him the chance of playing in Europe’s premier competition this season.\n\nWith just a few days left in the transfer window, the Reds will need to act quickly and strengthen their central midfield department. The injuries have depleted their midfield severely in recent weeks and Liverpool have managed to pick up just one win from four league matches so far.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that they will be able to challenge Manchester City for the Premier League title if they do not strengthen their midfield considerably before the transfer window slams shut."
