        "text": "The verdict is in on Leandro Trossard's Arsenal debut.\n\nIt's been somewhat of a whirlwind past few days for the Belgium international as his £21m transfer from Brighton & Hove Albion was made official on Friday afternoon and around 48 hours later he was named amongst the Gunners' substitutes for the 3-2 win over Manchester United.\n\nIn fact, Trossard played a role in Eddie Nketiah's 90th-minute winner as it was he who played in Oleksandr Zinchenko down the left prior to the Arsenal number 14 showing great improvisation to flick the ball past David de Gea and ensuring the home side emerged victorious.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal's triple boost confirmed after beating Manchester United and Premier League rule reset\n\nJudging by some of the responses on Twitter, Trossard certainly impressed supporters even if he was limited to a cameo role off the bench, whilst he scored a 7/10 in football.london 's player ratings for a solid debut as he produced some 'great dribbling in the build up to the winning goal and showed some quick feet to help Arsenal keep it up the pitch late on'.\n\nMeanwhile, Mikel Arteta - who appeared to drop a major hint about the imminent arrival of Jakub Kiwior - was also pleased with what he saw from the club's first major signing of the January transfer window.\n\n\"Just in terms of numbers, we had 15 or 16 outfield players and it wasn’t enough,\" the Spaniard told Sky Sports. \"They are going to help us. You saw Trossard is composed and confident already.\"\n\nAnd it would appear that it's not just Arteta, Arsenal fans and media alike that have heaped praise on Trossard as a couple of his new teammates have taken to Instagram to deliver their verdict.\n\nHaving posted a message that reads: \"Glad to meet you, Gunners! Big three points and amazing atmosphere out there!\", Gabriel Magalhaes responded by saying: \"Welcome bro!!!! Letsssssgooooo\", whilst captain Martin Odegaard used three 'Top' emojis to get his verdict across.\n\nIt remains to be seen when Trossard makes his first start for Arsenal, but having netted seven goals for Brighton already this season, he has already said he's at the peak of his powers: \"This has been my best season in the Premier League,\" he told the club's official website. \"We did a great job at Brighton and my form there has been really good.\n\n\"After the World Cup, I didn’t play much because of the situation but I’m just so excited to start here with Arsenal and show myself on the biggest stage for a top club. [The club] has so much history and I want to be part of that history going on. That’s why I joined this project. I’m really excited to be here. I want to show myself to all the fans and on the biggest stage.\"\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nWhat Bukayo Saka did to Luke Shaw after England comments as Arsenal transfers give title boost\n\nEvery word Mikel Arteta said on Eddie Nketiah's form, title hopes and Jakub Kiwior transfer\n\nWhy Oleksandr Zinchenko was not offside for Arsenal winner despite Man Utd complaints over VAR\n\nFind the footballs on the football.london website to win cash prize, vouchers and TV worth £3,000"
