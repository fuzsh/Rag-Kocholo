        "text": "Mireya Casta�eda\n\nWITH fine sagacity, the Teatro Papalote (Kite Theater) of Matanzas has announced that it is \"making its August\" in Havana�s Gui�ol Nacional Theater. This popular refrain is convincing because both children and adults in the capital are aware of this puppet group�s excellent performances and that every one of its functions becomes an instant success.\n\nThe Matanzas Papalote is taking over Havana�s summer, presenting three of its most applauded pieces: Una cucarachita llamada Martina, Little Red Riding Hood and Tres somos tres, all directed and written by the maestro Ren� Fern�ndez, National Theater Prize 2007.\n\nThis version of the classic La cucarachita Martina, is from 1991 and during it, live actors alternate with puppets designed by Zen�n Calero.\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood (2009) is a very Cuban vision of the story by Charles Perrault. This fifth version, which Papalote has created from the classical children�s story proposes, according to the program, \"to talk in the voice of new times.\"\n\nAnother innovation in this production is the introduction of Little Red Riding Hood�s father. Design is by Jacqueline Ram�rez (puppets) and Ren� Fern�ndez (scenery), with music by Ra�l Vald�s.\n\nThe third piece, very much a puppet show, full of oral and scenic games, is Tres somos tres, likewise an extremely Cuban version of the story The Three Little Pigs. Its staging once more appeals to the recourse of theater within theater, which identifies so many Papalote works, and has received prizes in the UNEAC Caricato and the Small-Format Festival.\n\nTeatro Papalote, founded in 1962, has brought more than 100 works to the stage, both Cuban and foreign, with their origins in themes of universal classical literature and popular traditions.\n\nExamples of this wide-ranging and large repertoire are: Pedrito y las semillas m�gicas, 1967; The Pied Piper of Hamelin, 1967; Convocando a Carilda. Leyenda de una mujer, 1994; El Poeta y Platero, on the works of Juan R. Jim�nez, 1993. Quimera, La zapatera prodigiosa and Amor de don Perlimpl�n con Belisa en su jard�n, by Federico Garc�a Lorca, 1963; Ensayando a Moli�re, 2002; Ugly, based on The Ugly Duckling, by Hans Christian Andersen, 1999, and Danilo y Dorotea. Otra historia de amor, inspired by Ibsen�s The Doll�s House, 2005.\n\nCritics place Papalote \"among the most outstanding groups in the Cuban children�s theater movement, given its innovative theatrical language and puppetry in which dramaturgy, music, design and staging are all combined.\" The group has performed in Mexico, Colombia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Sweden, Russia, Spain, France and Venezuela.\n\nIt took its name in 1971, based on the text El papalote que lleg� a la luna, by Ren� Fern�ndez himself, premiered in 1970 in the Sauto Theater, Matanzas. In 1984, the group definitively assumed the name Teatro Papalote.\n\nRen� Fern�ndez (Matanzas, 1944), its general and artistic director, is also president of the UNIMA (International Marionette�s Union) of Cuba.\n\nTeatro Papalote is having a season at the Gui�ol Nacional and, with its puppetry art is \"making its August\" in Havana. It is taking advantage of an opportune moment and making use of an old Cuban saying (formerly \"making one�s August and grape harvest)."
