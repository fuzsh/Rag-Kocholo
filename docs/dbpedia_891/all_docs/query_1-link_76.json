The art was so impressive to the public, people began to collect the posters as soon as they went up, which is why they are so scarce today. Artists such as Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Alphonse Mucha, Jules ChÃ©ret, ThÃ©ophile-Alexandre Steinlen, Pierre Bonnard and EugÃ¨ne Grasset contributed to the creative body of work that became what some called âa free museum for the massesâ. The craze for collecting these examples of modern art was even given the name, \"affichomanie\", meaning âartistic poster maniaâ. Collectors today pay hundreds, if not thousands for original prints of these rare posters.\n\nWe offer these exceptional vintage poster reproductions in the highest possible print quality. Superior to most reproductions currently available on the market, our gallery quality prints are suitable for display in an art gallery or museum.

Posters are available printed on museum quality archival paper or on repositionable media that allow you to plaster your walls with the âAffiche Artistiqueâ, just as they were originally intended to be displayed.\n\nAbout the artist:\n\nAlphonse Mucha\n\nCzech, 1860-1939\n\nAlphonse Maria Mucha was born in IvanÄice, Moravia. As a young man, he was sponsored to study at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts before arriving in Paris in 1887, where he continued his studies at AcadÃ©mie Julian and AcadÃ©mie Colarossi.\n\nHe volunteered his services when he happened to hear of an urgent need for a poster to advertise a new play at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de la Renaissance. He seized the opportunity and completed the project within two weeks. Muchaâs poster for Sarah Bernhardtâs Gismonda in 1894 launched his career as a successful artist in Paris. Sarah Bernhardt herself was so pleased with his artwork that she began a six-year contract with Mucha to produce her posters.\n\nMuchaâs designs began to be applied to jewelry, carpets and wallpaper as well as posters and illustrations in books and advertisements. His use of pale pastels and classically styled beauties became known as the Mucha Style, and then as Art Nouveau (New Art).\n\nMucha was dissatisfied that his commercial work achieved such success, while he desired to communicate a spiritual message through art. After marrying MaruÅ¡ca ChytilovÃ¡ in Prague in 1906, Mucha and his new bride traveled to the U.S., where they remained for four years. Mucha became devoted to promoting Slavic nationalism and returned to Prague, where he was commissioned to decorate the Theatre of Fine Arts. Mucha designed the new postage stamps, banknotes and other documents for the newly independent state of Czechoslovakia after World War I.\n\nMuchaâs final fine art masterpiece, The Slav Epic, took many years to complete. It is a series of twenty large paintings that depict the history of the Slavic people. A lifelong dream of Muchas to create, he presented his masterpiece to the city of Prague in 1928.\n\nMucha was one of the first arrested by the Gestapo when Czechoslovakia was occupied by German troops in 1939. Eventually released, he died the same year of pneumonia, possibly weakened by the events of his arrest and interrogation.\n\nSarah Bernhardt\n\nFrench, (1844 -1923)\n\nRosine Bernardt, the woman who was to be introduced as âthe most famous actress the world has ever knownâ began life as the illegitimate child of Jewish mother Julie Bernardt, who worked as a courtesan in Paris. Sarah Bernhardt added the âHâ to her last name and took the name Sarah as her stage name, beginning her acting career in 1862 while a student at ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise. She traveled to Belgium where she became the mistress of Henri, Prince de Ligne. Sarah gave birth to the princeâs son, Maurice, in 1864. Although the prince wanted to marry her, his family was against the union and convinced Sarah to end their relationship.\n\nBernhardt began performing at the ThÃ©Ã¢tre de LâOdÃ©on in 1866. In 1870, when the Franco-Prussian war began, Sarah is credited with converting the theatre into a makeshift hospital and taking care of wounded soldiers there. Throughout the 1870âs Bernhardtâs success climbed. She traveled all over Europe and even to Cuba, where she performed in Matanzasâ Sauto Theater in 1887.\n\nIn 1899, Sarah Bernhardt opened the ThÃ©Ã¢tre Sarah-Bernhardt on the Place du ChÃ¢telet in Paris. She earned the title âThe Divine Sarahâ following the premiere of her performance in the title role of âHamletâ. The play was four hours long and received rave reviews."
