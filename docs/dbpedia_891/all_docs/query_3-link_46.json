        "text": "Before booking your holiday to Cuba, how about we brief you on some historical sites, architectural monuments, and exceptional tourist attractions to make your visit worth the while?\n\nThe history and culture of Cuba and it’s cities offer lots of stories and opportunities for adventure, making this part of the Caribbean one of the most visited by international guests. Here are a few facts about the Cuban archipelago.\n\nHavana: Havana La Habana\n\nHavana La Habana (translated as “The City of Columns”) is the capital and heart of Cuba. As the largest city and Cuba’s main commercial region, Havana is packed with fascinating sites of historical importance. The culture-rich Caribbean city is home to hundreds of historic forts, globally competitive restaurants, and multiple wildlife reserves.\n\nOld Havana (also a UNESCO World Heritage Site), El Capito (National Capitol Building), and Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts) are a few attractions to visit if you are into 17th to 18th-century colonial architecture. Not to mention the numerous cultural practices from the 17th century with symbolic demonstrations of Cuban heritage all over the city.\n\nBaracoa, Guantanamo: Ciudad Primada\n\nBaracoa, a current municipality city, used to be the first capital of the country. Attractions like Maguana Beach and the 575m high El Yunque mountain peak serve as recreational spots for both locals and tourists visiting Baracoa.\n\nBaracoa is known for its ancient culture of religious activities as the people sought refuge in cathedrals like Catedral de Santa Catalina de Ricci and Catedral de Nuestra Senora de la Asuncion centuries ago. The initial inhabitants of Baracoa were the indigenous people of Taino who left a wealth of oral history, religious practices, and cultural ceremonies. You can learn more about their life in pre-colonial Cuba by visiting the Cuevas del Paraíso Archaeological Museum.\n\nBayamo: La Ciudad Primera\n\nVisitors who plan to get first-hand experience of Bayamo should stop by Buey Arriba, Sierra Maestra, and Yara. Just like the popular mountain ranges in Sancti Spiritus, the Sierra Maestra range spreads across the entire south areas of the old Oriente. That’s enough landmass to enjoy the green and nature’s beauty of Bayamo.\n\nGet prepared to tap into the cultural heritage of the 31,327+ Buey Arriba residents while enjoying their local dishes and lifestyle. In Taino dialect, Yara means “Place”, making the city a symbol of diversity, peace, culture, hospitality, and love from the people.\n\nCiego de Avila: The Pineapple Town\n\nEven after decades of colonization, Ciego de Avila still keeps the evergreen colonial architecture the city is known for. As one of the most sought-after tourist destinations in the Caribbean, the pineapple town boasts culture, heritage, and sustainable tourism.\n\nTourists get to enjoy the sight of magnificent historical pieces and eclectic architecture in the Decorative Arts Museum. There are also other numerous attractions like the Leche Lagoon, Coco Cay, Playa Pilar Beach, and Guillermo Cay to help you have an exceptional holiday weekend.\n\nCienfuegos: La Perla del Sur (Pearl of the South)\n\nThe Provincial Museum would be a great place to start your adventure of exploring Cienfuegos’ colonial history. Till date, two-thirds of the city’s architecture still retains the colonial-era buildings from centuries ago. What a magnificent sight to behold!\n\nVisitors can access the ferry transport, which crosses the 18th-century fortress — Castillo de Jagua. From most restaurants and hotels in Cienfuegos, you could sight Cuba’s largest natural bay at your comfort. Never leave Cuba without visiting Teatro Tomás Terry (Theatre), which showcases the historical heritage of Cuba by putting up plays and performances.\n\nCamaguey: The Maze\n\nHere’s an intriguing story about the city of Camaguey. Back in the 16th century, Camaguey’s architecture was built haphazardly to confuse attackers, hence the nickname — “The Maze.” From mass sugar production and cattle breeding in the 17th century, Camaguey witnessed a major economic breakthrough. The sugar-producing factories are opened to tourism as well.\n\nAs Cuba’s third-largest city, Camaguey is full of museums like Ignacio Agramonte Birthplace, Plaza San Juan de Dios Square, and the Jover House of Art. Book a guided tour to experience and learn the intricate details of Camaguey’s history.\n\nHolguin\n\nThe Finca Mayabe Ranch in the south-eastern part of Holguin attracts numerous visitors across the globe every year. Tranquil fields, gorgeous views of the Mayabe Valley, and locally sourced dishes will make you appreciate this gem in Eastern Cuba. The natural wonders of the area have no end —anyone who enjoys the feel of white sands and azure waters would enjoy relaxing at the Playa Pesquero, Playa Esmeralda, or Playa Don Lino beaches.\n\nHolguin is also the birthplace of several notable Cubans, such as Jorge Nunez Asencio — a chess master who has won competitions across the globe. Although not as big as Cuba, the city is easily accessible to travellers from Europe thanks to the Frank País Airport (HOG/MUHG). While you are there, go for an adventure and climb Loma de la Cruz’s (Hill of the Cross) 450+ stairs.\n\nSanta Clara: Ciudad Liberal (The Free City)\n\nWould you like to peek inside Cuba’s oldest and biggest convent? Then visit the Convento de Santa Clara (Santa Clara Convent) located in Plaza Vieja Square (Havana). Get the full story behind the Loma del Capiro Hill — a strategic part of Santa Clara that was of significance to the victory of the Battle of Santa Clara in 1959.\n\nLike the U-shaped 775-seat Sauto Theatre in Matanzas, Santa Clara showcases its heritage and historical culture through arts in Teatro La Caridad (La Caridad Theater). Enjoy the peaceful sight of nature’s green by visiting the El Bosque Zoological Garden (Camilo Cienfuegos). It’s the perfect place for couples on a date out or group hangouts.\n\nSantiago De Cuba\n\nAnimal lovers will enjoy the explicit sight of fascinating creatures like crocodiles, wild dolphins, and the autochthonous fauna of the Baconao Lagoon in Santiago de Cuba. For a token, visitors can access boats and sail across the coasts of the Lagoon. You could also catch a glimpse of over 1800 species at the 800km2 Parque Bacanao Biosphere Reserve.\n\nCalle Heredia Street in Santiago de Cuba is one of the liveliest streets in the country. The street gets crowded with lots of people from all parts of the world partying, dancing, and having fun every night. You truly do not want to miss the “Saturday Night” saga when you visit Santiago de Cuba on your holiday trip. It promises lots of wild fun!\n\nTrinidad: Land of the Hummingbird\n\nTrinidad is home to Casa de la Trova House — one of the best music houses in Cuba. Both locals and visitors enjoy the melodious and indigenous sounds of Cuban music while having a nice time out. The city also used to be a major artisanal hub as a lot of Cuba’s pottery history can be found in Casa del Alfarero’s workshop, built in the 19th century.\n\nThe Benito Ortiz University Art Gallery in Trinidad displays key ancient artwork connecting several Cuban practices and cultures to their stories and structures. If you can, take a drive through The Plaza Mayor of Trinidad for the most alluring sight of ancient and strategically designed buildings of the colonial jewel of Cuba.\n\nSancti Spíritus\n\nNarrow winding streets, preserved colonial houses, and Cuba’s oldest church are just a few things you will find in Sancti Spíritus. Founded in 1514 by the conquistador Diego Velázquez, the city was one of the original 7 cities built in Cuba by the Spanish. Since then, it has been a centre for agriculture and commerce, thanks to the abundance of tobacco and fresh produce in the Sancti Spíritus province.\n\nIts proximity to Trinidad makes Sancti Spíritus a perfect destination for a day trip. Surprisingly, the city is not sprawling with tourists, so you will be able to walk along its cobbled streets without dodging the crowds. Pay a visit to the open-air agricultural market to try freshly picked guavas or go to the Colonial Art Museum, housed in a lavish colonial mansion.\n\nRemedios: Cradle of the Parrandas\n\nNestled near Cuba’s northern coast, San Juan de Los Remedios charms its visitors with elegant plazas, opulent churches, and a long history of pirate raids. As the eighth-oldest European city in Cuba, its foundation date is said to be between 1513 and 1524. In the following centuries, Remedios was known for its flourishing cattle and sugar cane industries. The wealthy families who benefited the most from the trade in Remedios lived in luxurious colonial houses, which can still be seen today.\n\nThe 17th-century Spanish architecture of the town is best represented by the Iglesia Mayor of San Juan Bautista — a church where you can marvel at 13 gold-decorated altars. Remedios is particularly vibrant around the Christmas period, thanks to its famous Parrandas festival. The oldest Cuban festival boasts firework shows, huge processions, music, and art.\n\nPinar del Río: The Capital of Tobacco\n\nThe last major city founded by the Spanish was called Pinar del Río because of the pine forests along the Río Guama river in the region. Initially known as Nueva Filipinas, or New Philippines, due to the inflow of Asian workers, the city gained a reputation for its Tobacco production.\n\nYou can learn why Pinar del Río is often dubbed the Mecca of Tobacco by visiting the Francisco Donatien Cigar Plantations or getting real Cuban cigars from the company shop. Venture into the eclectic neoclassical building of the Guasch Palace, which houses the Museum of Natural Sciences, to view its impressive collections of Cuban flora and fauna. Another must-see neoclassical building is the Milanese Theatre — one of the eight big theatres built in Colonial Cuba.\n\nMatanzas: the Athens of Cuba\n\nIn the Bay of Matanzas, on Cuba’s northern shore, lies a hidden treasure of culture, Afro-Cuban folklore, and colonial architecture. Matanzas, the capital city of the eponymous province, has many nicknames — the “City of Bridges” and “Venice of Cuba” because of its 17 bridges over the three rivers that run through the city, or “The Athens of Cuba” for its poetic and artistic scene.\n\nA walk along the plazas and streets of this truly romantic city will take you on a journey through centuries of Cuban architecture. The Sauto Theater, also a National Monument of Cuba, features statues of Greek goddesses, neoclassical balconies, and painted ceilings. The marvellous building dates back to 1863 and has hosted plays, operas, ballet performances with actors and singers from all over the world. Don’t forget to also visit the Cathedral of St. Charles Borrome, which has a beautiful interior with frescoes on the ceilings, walls, and central dome.\n\nThe history and culture of Cuba are rich with colonisation, export, and politics. The periods of turmoil and calm have painted a colourful picture over its urban and natural landscapes, creating a piece of living art. The symbolism and meaning behind Cuba’s colonial artefacts can only be deciphered by chatting to knowledgeable locals or taking in its beauty with one’s own eyes.\n\nFor more information, please feel free toContact Us any time, one of our team of dedicated Cuba specialists will be happy to create a tailor-made holiday just for you so that you can discover more about this fascinating country."
