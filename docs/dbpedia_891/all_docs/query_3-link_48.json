The city was founded in 1693 under the name of San Carlos and San Severino de Matanzas. French immigration at the end of the 18th century turned Matanzas into a rich and cultured region, the most prosperous inside the country. It was proclaimed âAthens of Cubaâ in 1860 and has always been a reason of inspiration for painters, musicians and poets.\n\nTo the excellent natural conditions and its extraordinary beautiful landscapes, we should add its advantage and strategic location. The city is surrounded by a beautiful bay and well conserved architecture expressing itself in an eclectic style. Matanzas treasures a number of museum and several places of interest like the Pharmaceutical Museum, the only French drug store of the 19th century conserved in the world; the Junco Palace Provincial Museum; the famous Sauto Theater, National Monument; the San Carlos de Borromeo Cathedral built in 1878; the San Severino Castle, the homes of the Catalanes of Montserrat among other cultural and historic values.\n\nMatanzas is proud of its bridges and rivers whose outlets is to the bay: San Juan river that travels from the valleys of the south; Canimar river which travel through cannon between hills from the east and the Yumuri river that brings along waters from the neighboring west valley of the same name. From these rivers there are a number of bridges which are emblematic to the city like the called Concordia of 1878; the enormous Guiteras over the Canimar that dates back to the 20th century which gave way to tourism for Varadero.
