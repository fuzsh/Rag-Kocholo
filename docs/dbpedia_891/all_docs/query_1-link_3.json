        "text": "The Sauto Theater opened in 1863 in Matanzas, Cuba, and has when you consider that then been a proud image of the metropolis. The U-formed 775-seat theatre is almost absolutely included with wood-panelling. It has three balconies, and its ground can be raised to convert the auditorium right into a ballroom. The unique theater curtain is a painting of the Puente de l. A. Concordia over the Yumuri River. The foyer is graced by way of Carrara marble statues of Greek goddesses and the principle hall ceiling bears artwork of the muses.\n\nWhen it opened in 1863, it turned into named Teatro Esteban, after the Civil Governor of Matanzas at the time, Pedro Esteban y Arranz. But soon it adopted the last call of Ambrosio de l. A. Concepcion Sauto, a patron of the humanities who contributed tons to its construction and splendour. Due to the proximity of Matanzas to Havana, the cultural consciousness of its people, and the solvency of its rich landowners, the Sauto Theater turned into visited frequently by means of the first-rate performers who regarded in Havana."
