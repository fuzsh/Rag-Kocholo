        "text": "Another edition of Matanzas’Spring Choral Concerts was opened with a speech by PhD. José Antonio Méndez Valencia, this time at Matanzas’ Baptist Church.\n\nThe event, a tradition deep-rooted among the inhabitants of the city, had a happy beginning in charge of two children’s choirs directed professors Vanesa Herrera andVaniaFundora.\n\nI have to confess that, with all the experience I have gained over the years, I felt like alittle girl again and I wanted to be one of those girls in Vanesa’s choir, who made such good interpretation of Vitier’s and de Brahms’ pieces, and of the Mexican or Italian repertoire.\n\nThen, when Vania’s students performed, I was able to see myself again playing children’s games between songs. The work carried out by these two professors, friends, is an invitation for children to enjoy their childhood through singing and for adults to never letting their inner children go away.\n\nA lot has been said about providing children and teenagers with music and songs in accordance with their age. This is an endless struggle in the midst of so much mediocre material bombing us on a daily basis from loud speakers, tape recorders, etc. in homes, taxis, buses, cafeterias, bars, restaurants or the cell phones of some individuals who consider themselves the center of the universe and invade our auditory private space which should be respected by everyone, even just for common sense.\n\nThe successful performancesby these two popular children’s choirs from our city confirmed that children act according to the education they receive and they can add their life good music, which has nothing to do with fashions or a specific period of time.\n\nThe white voices of children interpreting choral music with innocence and a happy childhood, was the best possible opening for this Spring Choral Concert. I, as well as the audience, appreciate the work developed by Vanesa and Mendez; thank Matanzas’ Baptist Church and the Kairos Center for possible for the city to celebrate this year’s event while the Sauto Theater and the former Liceoand the White Theater continue with their restoration works. As the grandmother of one of those girls who sing like angels, I thank lifefor the opportunity of seeing me reflected in their vocal chords, singing songs I still listen to from a small device called cell phone, which sometimes I wish I could play at full blast so that everyone can listen to good children’s music from all times, which is translated into life, joy and innocence.\n\nChoral singing is celebrating in this city of music and poets. On forthcoming days there will be further important performances in the same place this beautiful and healthy event was opened. The choir from the Church of Christ and the Ecumenical Choir performed last Tuesday 27 and the Choir from the Higher Institute of the Arts and the Girls’ Choir from Matanzas’ Music Conservatory will perform on May 29. The event will come to an end on Friday 30 at 8 pm with a concert by Matanzas’ Choir.\n\nAt the top of the church wall there is a slogan that invites believers and non-believers to open up to music, which, as Marti once said: is the soul of men that has escaped from them.Cantadalegres a Dios habitantes de toda la tierra (Earth inhabitants sing joyfully to God). Leaving aside the religious symbolism, if you wish to, this slogan is an invitation worth taking.\n\nAuthors\n\nNester Núñez,"
