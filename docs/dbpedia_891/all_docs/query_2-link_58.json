        "text": "At most, the salon was a one minute walk from my casa. But about halfway there I could hear the faint sound of live drums beating out a rhythm completely unfamiliar to me. I was so intrigued that I decided to ditch my plan and follow my ears instead, down a side street to the weatherworn door of a nearby casa. As I stood there trying to peek through the cracks, I heard a voice call to me from across the street “Te gustaria entrar?” (Would you like to enter?). Pilar, as it turns out, was the owner of the casa and she was neither surprised nor offended at my nosiness. I hesitated for about three seconds while I recalled my son’s pre-trip advice to not follow strangers into their homes, but that sentiment was quickly overridden by my curiosity and I followed my new friend through her front door.\n\nIt was as though I was walking onto the set of an old war movie – crumbling stone walls, no roof, spare auto and appliance parts and miscellaneous rubble laying everywhere on the dirt floor. In the middle of all the decay were seven Cubanos sitting in a circle with congas, cajones (box drums) and other peculiar percussion instruments, playing and singing a genre of music unknown to me. This was my introduction to real street rumba in its raw and primal form. Rumba is a traditional form of Afro-Cuban music involving dancing, drumming and singing, the roots of which are believed to have originated in the streets of Matanzas and Havana. Without skipping a beat, the rumberos (rumba players) pulled up a chair for me, un-phased by the fact that I was a complete stranger, and I sat, listening and learning and appreciating being immersed in one of the most distinct elements of Cuban culture.\n\n30 minutes into the impromptu performance, it started to pour – not just outside but inside the house (did I mention it was May and the start of rainy season?). All instruments and people were moved in unison to the only room which had a roof, the single bedroom. But the rumba continued, and Pilar’s young son Kenny bounced around the bed hamming it up for my camera while the adults passed around a bottle of Havana Club Rum taking turns with a single shot glass. I did make an earlier attempt to leave when one of my hosts urged me to stay and wait out the deluge. At first I declined … after all, I am Canadian and we are a hearty bunch. With a shake of his head and a deep sigh, he gestured “OK, suit yourself” and opened the door. It was immediately apparent that I wasn’t going anywhere without a flotation device. The streets and sidewalks had completely disappeared and everything had been transformed into a fast-flowing river. Perfect for a white-water rafting expedition, but a walk home in flip-flops against the current? Not so much. Old leather shoes, cardboard boxes, bags of garbage, and other unidentifiable objects went rushing by as I stood there stranded and helpless. So I did the only thing possible under the circumstances – I re-joined the fiesta.\n\nI eventually returned to my casa looking like a drowned rat, absolutely soaking wet to my core. But I had a bit of a Havana Club buzz, a rumba CD in my pocket, and a shear sense of delight at being welcomed into the fold by the resident Rumba band.\n\nIn this place, you need to embrace the opportunity to create your own detour because sometimes, the best experiences are those which happen while we’re on our way to doing something else.\n\nIf you plan to explore this area, here is a list of some of the significant landmarks and features you won’t want to miss:\n\n1. Puente de la Concordia was the first iron bridge constructed in the city. It was inaugurated in 1878 and was built to provide a permanent and reliable conduit from central Matanzas to Versalles over the Yumurí River. Her columns are one of the city’s most recognizable features and the bridge itself has become a symbol of Matanzas.\n\n2. If it’s a Sunday morning and you start your tour early enough, you can be at the Calle Arostegui Street Market (between Calles Navia and Rieche) in time to blend with the locals. This is a great place for mingling, people-watching, and being in the midst of everyday life in action.\n\n6. Another symbol of the city, Iglesia San Pedro Apóstol is an elegant neoclassic church designed by the same architect as Teatro Sauto - Danielle Dall’Aglio – and constructed between 1867 and 1870. Beautifully restored in 2005, her pink steeples rise so high that she’s like a beacon of sorts, making her easy to spot from a distance. I haven’t been inside this church yet, but I do know tours are available.\n\n7. Although Hershey Station now stands idle, a casualty of Cuba’s crumbling infrastructure, the Hershey Train was a primary means of transportation for locals commuting between Matanzas and Casablanca, Havana. This electric railway was built in 1920 by sugar baron Milton S. Hershey, to service the sugar industry and to transport his workers. It eventually became a tourist attraction as well, for those wanting to experience local transit while travelling through the small towns and villages in the Yumurí Valley. The train itself still runs out of the station in Havana but it currently only comes partway through the Valley, at least until the tracks further east can be repaired. Even though this building is closed, it’s still an interesting area to wander around, including the dirt road that runs parallel to the tracks.\n\n8. Castillo de San Severino is the absolute highlight of Versalles, and it’s a place you’ll want to stop for at least an hour. One of the very few structures still standing from the time the city was founded, it was built between 1693 and 1750 (enduring delays in construction between 1695 and 1737) to protect the Bay of Matanzas and aid in the defense of Havana. It was purposely destroyed in 1762 to prevent it from falling under control of the British, and was reconstructed between 1772 and 1789. It was used as an off-loading point for slaves, and in the 19th century it became a prison for those captured in the fight for independence from Spain. San Severino is included in the World Heritage Site of ‘Old Havana and its Fortifications’, and was declared a national monument in 1979. Today it is a museum not only honoring Matanzas’ military past, but also representing her significant role in the history of slavery as the Museo Nacional de la Ruta del Esclavo. It also has a gallery with AfroCuban art on display. I recommend taking a guide to assist with translation.\n\nThe map below should come in handy when you’re planning your route. Make sure to allow time for aimless wandering - you never know what you might discover on your own.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nI’ve been to el Morrillo twice, and I remember wishing that the state of the exhibits themselves – the lighting and the layout in particular – were a little more conducive to the importance of the artifacts and the stories behind them. The ongoing challenge with Cuba’s museums, especially those outside of major tourist centres, is the shortage of resources required to keep up with the ongoing restoration and conservation of their properties and collections. However, slow-but-steady improvements have continued over the last few years, and I’ve learned that there are more significant efforts being carried out now, in preparation for a return to tourism once the country opens to foreigners again.\n\nRegardless, the best part of the tour on both occasions were the ladies who worked at the site. Acting as guides, they were clearly proud of their heritage, committed to their work and completely engaged in telling the story behind this piece of Cuba’s revolutionary past. As usual, it’s the human element that has the power to either make or break an experience.\n\nIt was rainy that day, the air was damp and the interior smelled of musty old book bindings and antique wood. There were a handful of aged wooden library stacks, beautiful ornate columns and chandeliers hanging from the high ceiling. Down the centre of the room was a row of tables piled high with hundreds of very old books that looked like they’d been untouched for decades. They were covered in cobwebs and insects and bird feces. The guard watched me closely as I took out my camera to snap a few photos of the architectural details, but he gave me an emphatic finger-wave when I asked permission to include the tables in the frame.\n\nThe magnificent Carrara marble staircase leading to the second floor was sandwiched between two walls which I’m certain were not integral to the original design. Whatever retrofit they were part of did more to hide the beauty of this incredible feature than to enhance it. The second floor was similar to the first in terms of space and function – there were books, shelves and a few tables where a handful of people were reading and working quietly.\n\nI wanted to know the history, but nobody I knew at the time could provide it. It’s remarkably difficult to find good information about Cuban cities, outside of Havana and a few of the more popular tourist destinations, online or anywhere else. After mining for details, I was finally able to piece together a snapshot of the back story behind Casino Español.\n\nInitially called Principe Alfonso XII Casino, it was constructed around 1864 as a single storey building in the Neo-Renaissance style. With a grand ballroom and several galleries leading off of it, a billiards room and balconies overlooking the hall below, it served as a meeting and entertainment venue for the wealthy members of society at the time. It was a place where distinguished Matanceros could indulge in events which kept them culturally connected to their homeland of Spain.\n\nIn 1897, the building was destroyed by fire but was rebuilt in 1901. This time it had a second storey, topped with the royal Spanish Coat of arms cast in stone and flanked by two terra cotta lions brought from Barcelona.\n\nThere’s a hint of sadness at the thought of all of that beauty in decay.\n\nHowever, being present in such a grand space and surrounded by architectural details of the period, something else comes to mind as well. Imagine the ballroom filled with elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen gliding across the marble floors to Miguel Failde’s famous danzón composition ‘Las Alturas de Simpson’. That’s how the high society of Matanzas would have rolled back in the early 1900’s.\n\nThis historic site has been in a constant state of repair and renovation for at least the past six years. If there is a timeline for completion, and if it’s anything like that of Teatro Sauto, it will be another three or four years before we’re able to enjoy the finished product.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t stop and wander around inside if you’re walking by someday and the door happens to be open. If nothing else, it will always be a beautiful work in progress.\n\nNow, after spending time working my way into the fold here, it’s become clear that each one has unique and defining characteristics. Each has their own distinctive vibe. I suppose that’s a testament to the virtues of travelling slowly.\n\nDowntown has a typically noisy urban buzz, with its cars and motos racing around Parque de la Libertad, and its patios alive with music and people. La Playa is the coastal neighbourhood in the east end, with pretty houses perched on rocks lining the bay, and quiet streets where many expats reside. Los Mangos is at the top of the city where you’ll find the absolute best view of the Yumurí Valley, and where it always seems to be 5 degrees hotter than anywhere else in Matanzas.\n\nThen there’s La Marina. It’s the gritty barrio which lies between the main street of Contreras and the Río Yumurí, and where the pulse of AfroCuba resonates loudly and everyday life vibrates at a little higher frequency.\n\nCommunity\n\nOne of the most endearing aspects of Cuba is the undeniable sense of community that seems to be present everywhere. People know their neighbors, they help each other, they look out for each other’s children and care for their elderly loved ones. Sharing a common struggle is something that binds a group of people (or an entire island) together, and people tend to struggle just a little more in La Marina than elsewhere in the city. Perhaps that’s the reason why the sense of community seems particularly strong here. With the presence of organizations like the Nelson Barrera Cultural Centre, which promotes an inclusive approach to the maintenance and development of AfroCuban culture, the community is actively engaged in efforts towards making everybody feel like they matter.\n\nAs grimy and dishevelled as parts of it may be, there is no denying that La Marina is one of Matanzas’ richest neighborhoods culturally-speaking. Wander it slowly, explore it with open eyes and an open mind. You’ll need this essential piece of the puzzle in order to understand and appreciate the city beyond its surface.\n\nI could write/talk/listen/think on this subject for hours at a time.\n\nWhen Sarah from Havana Adventures Day Tours invited me to ‘takeover’ their Instagram account for a few days (to collaborate by way of sharing my own content through their feed), I jumped at the chance.\n\nHere, I string all five entries together, with some minor revisions for the purposes of flow, as a way of highlighting a handful of the most endearing features of this gritty and engaging city.\n\n1. THE HOOK\n\nThe thing that initially drew me to Matanzas in 2014 was the fact that it wasn't yet on the map as a place of interest to tourists, but it was easy to get to because of its proximity to both Varadero and Havana. What keeps me going back is the fact that it's so easy to feel like a local there, and the opportunities to connect with local people - to hear their stories, to exchange ideas, to expose yourself to all of the layers of real Cuban life - require almost no effort beyond a simple 'Buen día'. Locals like Armando, working in his family's stone fabricating shop along the Hershey train tracks, are almost anxious to invite you in and not only tell you about themselves and their work, but also to hear about you and your family and your life back home. Matanzas is also very rich in terms of arts and culture, even more so now that the core has been revitalized with a focus on venues for live dance, music and theatrical performances, as well as art galleries and photography exhibits. There is a very large creative community here, which is why it’s often referred to as The Athens of Cuba.\n\nIt seems to be a universally enjoyed pastime. Whether you only have five minutes to spare while waiting to meet a friend for coffee, or a two-hour wait at the airport gate before your flight takes off, there’s something about standing back and observing people going about their daily business that’s somehow soothing, therapeutic even.\n\nIt’s like watching a bonfire.\n\nIt’s no different when we’re travelling, except for the uniqueness factor. Passing time on a curb/bench/stair, with our eyes peeled to the street life before us while being immersed in a culture very different from our own is like levelling-up in that respect.\n\nEvery city has its areas where people-watching is particularly interesting on certain days and times of the week. For those of you spending time in Matanzas and looking for those hot spots, I’ve put together the following list of the five best places to check out:\n\n#5 - Calle Narváez\n\nThis area of the city has undergone huge changes in the last few years. Once just a decaying road along the river with a break wall to match, and nothing to see except for a single art gallery near the end of Calle Jovellanos, this is now a beautiful walkway along Rio San Juan. You can find art galleries, outdoor sculptures, bars, an ice cream shop and a gallery-café along here, and the prettiest night view of Puente de Tirry (also known as Calixto García Bridge). The section close to the bridge is often used as an outdoor music and dance venue during festivals, and on most evenings all of the benches and the reconstructed break wall are covered with locals sitting and enjoying the evening with friends. Friday and Saturday nights see a younger crowd because of the bar scene here so if you fancy a few cocktails with your people-watching, that would be the time to go. But this is a lovely spot with lots of places to sit regardless of which day and time you’re there.\n\n#4 - Las Cuevas de Bellamar\n\nA couple of years ago, before the revitalization, I wouldn’t have recommended this plaza for anything other than a visit to the fire station and museum, and the outdoor music and dance performances that would happen on occasion. Teatro Sauto didn’t re-open until late this year, the traffic zooming through here made it absolutely perilous to cross the road, and the El Vigía bar was a popular hangout for a seedier element of the local populace. But all of that has changed. Teatro Sauto is finally open and grander than ever, with performances in full swing. The ice cream shop and Cafe Atenas Restaurant have been renovated, there is an art/photography gallery and a sweet little coffee shop attached to the theatre with tiny tables sitting outside on the cobblestones in the square. The entire area has been blocked to motorized traffic save for a few lanes necessary for vehicles to get from one side of downtown to the other. Plaza Vigía is now a giant outdoor performance venue where the community comes together regularly to celebrate the outstanding musicians, dancers and other artists that make Matanzas so special.\n\n#2 - La Feria\n\nReferred to as “The Fair’ by the locals, this is the big Sunday market that takes place in a large empty space next to Victoria de Girón baseball stadium. It’s within easy walking distance from downtown along the San Juan River, and it’s where many of the locals come to shop for their meat, cheese and fresh produce for the week. I sometimes skip breakfast at my casa and opt for a fresh ham or roasted pork sandwich here instead, enjoying the salty smokey goodness while meandering around all of the lineups, the longest of which always forms in front of the meat and the cheese vendors. The best time to go is early in the morning around 7:30, if you want to have some time to enjoy before the blazing sun and heat make it a challenge for you to move around. And as with so many other events in Cuba, be prepared to do your people-watching with some background noise in the form of reggaeton music blaring from the speakers at the little bandshell. That shouldn’t detract from the experience though, it’s merely a reminder that music is an inherent part of the culture here.\n\n#1 - Calle Medio (#85)\n\nThis is the main shopping district in Matanzas and there are several blocks which are now closed off to motorized traffic, making it easier and safer for pedestrians to mill about. Some sections of the street are still under construction, evidence of the ongoing revitalization project happening around the city. But much of it has been completed and this street is chock-full of little shops, a large department store (Variedades), banks, cafés, bars, restaurants, street vendors and LOADS of people. Saturday is typically the busiest day, but weekday mornings are equally bustling and frenetic. This is the place in the city where, if you’re a local or a frequent visitor, you will run into somebody that you know. Calle Medio is absolutely the best place in Matanzas for people-watching.\n\nThere are a lot of other great spots in the city where you can park yourself and just watch life happen for a few hours, like in the lobby of Hotel Velasco, or on one of the benches in Parque de la Libertad right across the street from it. The list I’ve provided here is of places where I believe there is the highest concentration of locals at a given time, for optimum people-watching purposes.\n\nMy hope is that you don’t just watch, but that you engage with them as well, levelling-up yet again on your travel experience in general.\n\nMy amigo texted me, not from Cuba but from Chile, to inform me that he’d left the island (legally…I think) to go work in South America for a while, to make some money so that he can support his four children back in Cuba. He doesn’t know when he’ll be able to return, but it’s what he needs to do in order to put food on the table. I’m sappy, so I cried when I imagined him separated from his family for an indefinite period of time. But for him, this is what the locals refer to as ‘la lucha’ (the struggle). It’s not something you cry about -- it’s just something do.\n\nThankfully, for every story like this, there’s another that shines a light and brings perspective. When I first met my amiga Daymi in 2015, she was living in the small farm town of Manguito where there is almost zero to do and even fewer job opportunities. Not surprisingly, life in rural Cuba is much more difficult than in the city, and she was struggling to support herself and her son. But her desire to achieve something meaningful and to move forward in life propelled her to a much better situation. Today she’s a formally-trained and certified tour guide living near Varadero, she speaks three different languages (I believe she’s working on her fourth), and she’s happier and more vibrant than ever. Considering where she began, she’s a bit of a superstar in my books.\n\nAnd then, of course, there are times when being in Cuba leads to overwhelming joy – the kind that makes you feel like your heart will explode out of your chest. I was lucky enough to be in Matanzas for the 4th International Dance Festival “Miguel Failde in Memoriam”. I’m accustomed to free concerts in the streets of Matanzas, they happen all the time -- it’s one of the best things about the city. But this was unlike anything I’d seen there before. An entire plaza filled with 1000+ people (not sure of the exact number but I know it was a LOT), all ages, and every single one of them was either dancing or moving their body in some way. It wasn’t just people and music that filled the plaza that night – there was an incredible celebratory energy and a sense of community, two trademark characteristics of every Cuban festival.\n\nIf you travel with eyes wide open here (which you absolutely should), it’s sometimes impossible to avoid getting frustrated and downright p***ed at the state of things. But if you know and love Cuba, you also accept that it’s a love/hate thing, and you know that the unwavering Cuban spirit has a way of bringing everything back into check…big time.\n\nYes – you heard me right.\n\nMe, the person who promotes getting as local as possible when traveling, who prefers non-touristy things, and who is likely one of very few Cuba junkies on the planet who couldn´t care less about chilling on the beach -- I´m showing some love to Varadero.\n\nNo, I’m not losing my marbles, and I’m not promoting all-inclusive resort-style travel (I grapple with sustainability issues on that front). But I am a little fired up, because I’ve had my fill of the snickers and jeers and sometimes downright mockery directed at Varadero fans, by those who claim that it’s somehow less-Cuban than other destinations. How can that be? It’s in Cuba!\n\nOne of the most important lessons I’ve learned after many trips off-the-beaten-path on this island is:\n\nAuthentic Cuba is NOT about location – it’s about ENGAGEMENT.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying Varadero isn’t full of tourists because that would be just…well…loony. But guess what? It’s also full of Cubans.\n\nWe don’t need to talk about how stunning the beach is – it’s Varadero; enough said. But what is worth mentioning is the fact that during the winter months when the resort beaches are crowded, the section in town near the end of Calle 43 is practically deserted. In other words, if you’re staying at a casa particular, you’ll be close (or even on) a far-less populated slice of paradise. Even if you’re staying at a resort, you don’t need to go far to get away from the crowds and still be on one of the best beaches in the world. And if you go during June, July or August, it will be packed with local families enjoying their summer vacations. How is that not ‘real Cuba’?\n\nIf you love nature, you can snorkel just a little bit further west at Playa Coral, or check out the caves at Bellamar (sometimes touristy, but always totally worth it). For die-hard hikers, the incredible Yumuri Valley is just up the Via Blanca on the north edge of Matanzas, where you can try your luck at reaching the summit of Loma del Pan. It’s not for the faint of heart, but the tranquility and the views of the valley on the way up are un-be-lievable. Skip the jeep tour and arrange for your own transportation, or take a private tour so that you can enjoy the drive and explore the quaint little villages that dot the valley on your own terms.\n\nIs it nightlife you’re after? Varadero is chock-full of great restaurants and bars with live music and dancing, like Calle 62 or Casa de la Musica for example. And guess what? There’s no shortage of both tourists and locals patronizing those places. In fact, when my Cuban friends want a crazy night out, the strip in Varadero is often the destination of choice. Dancing, socializing and la fiesta has been an integral part of their culture forever — it doesn’t get more authentic than that.\n\nAre you an arts and culture buff? No hay problema. You can attend performances by Ballet Nacional de Cuba as well as Lizt Alfonso Dance Cuba on a day trip to Havana (or in nearby Matanzas, once renovations at Sauto Theatre are complete). And there’s no denying that the talent performing at some of the resorts is spectacular in their own right. Rumba and Santeria can be experienced all over the island but they’re prevalent in Matanzas and the surrounding area (i.e. all around Varadero) because, as some people believe, that part of Cuban culture originated there. If museums are your thing, take a short side-trip to the city of Cárdenas where you can visit Museo Oscar María de Rojas, one of the most interesting I’ve ever been to.\n\nIf I keep going, this list will be three miles long. My point is, ALL of the things I’ve mentioned are no less real or authentically Cuban than those you can experience in a non-resort area. And they’re all accessible if you’re staying in Varadero – that’s what makes it a super cool place to use as a home base. Travelers can enjoy one of Cuba’s most stunning beaches, with so many of the other goodies practically within arm’s reach.\n\nVaradero isn’t just a stretch of land filled with all-inclusive hotels…it’s also a town full of Cuban people living, working, shopping and spending time with friends and family. At the very least, tapping into a local vibe here can be as simple as having an engaging conversation with the bartender serving your mojitos, or the person cleaning your room. It’s possible you could end up with a glimpse of everyday Cuban life without ever stepping off the property, although I highly recommend doing so. When it comes down to it, meaningful interaction is what counts — not your address.\n\nThose who swear by the mantra “Varadero isn’t real Cuba” should think again, because authentic Cuba is anywhere the locals are. And there are plenty of them in Varadero, which makes it a perfectly acceptable choice as a home base for visitors to Cuba.\n\nHey — now there’s an idea for a nickname…Base Camp Varadero.\n\nYep, I like it.\n\nWhich begs the question – why do I scratch my head whenever someone asks me to recommend a list of things to do and see there? The truth is, the most interesting and moving experiences happen when and where we least expect them to.\n\nAccording to Trip Advisor and Airbnb Experiences, there are a lot of boxes to check on the list of interesting tourist sites in Matanzas. Some of those include Las Cuevas de Bellamar, one of the best examples of Cuba’s massive cave system complete with some very impressive stalactites and stalagmites, and Museo Farmacéutico, the beautifully preserved 19th century French Pharmacy in the centre of the city. Another interesting site is Castillo de San Severino, a fort built in 1735 on the Bay of Matanzas which also serves as a museum for both the history of slavery and Santeria (a personal favorite of mine which is usually deserted).\n\nThose are certainly some of the worthwhile highlights of the city, especially for people with limited time and an agenda to keep. But if you’re fortunate enough to be able to linger for a while – a few days or maybe longer – and you want my honest opinion on the best way to experience Matanzas, I would simply tell you this:\n\nKeep it simple. Meander through the streets and talk to people. Look, listen and engage.\n\nBecause what’s really special about Matanzas isn’t something you’ll find on a menu of points of interest promoted by a tour company, or written about in a review on a booking website.\n\nThere’s a special vibe there. It’s everywhere – in the streets, in people’s homes, in the markets and cantinas – and if you’re moving too fast because you’re focused on completing all of the items in your itinerary, you’ll miss it.\n\nYou’ll miss the inherent AfroCuban elements -- not those on display at the museum, but those happening all around you in the neighborhoods you’ll pass through on your way there. For example, at Rumba Park in La Marina, a little triangle-shaped, tree-covered patch of concrete at the junction of Calles Manzano, Matanzas and 278, it’s common to see street performances by local rumba groups such as Los Muñequitos de Matanzas or Grupo AfroCuba de Matanzas. And travelers can also miss the fact that if they listen carefully, they can often hear conga or batá drums beating somewhere in the distance, signifying either a toque (a Cuban version of a jam session) or perhaps even a Santeria ceremony taking place in the vicinity. If you happen to encounter one of these while you’re exploring the city, don’t be afraid to stop and observe.\n\nThere’s also a vibrant street market scene -- almost every neighborhood has one early on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with extra-large markets located next to Estadio Victoria de Giron baseball stadium (meat, cheese and fresh produce vendors) and Playa Tenis (same items, but on a smaller scale). These are all great places to people-watch and engage with everyday life in Cuba.\n\nFor me, the most indelible memories have been forged during very casual and unplanned events, such as the rumba practice session at a private casa which I discovered while taking street photos (they saw me standing at the doorway with camera-in-hand and invited me to sit in). On another occasion, while exploring the area around the Hershey Station, my friend and I were invited to step into a unique little stone fabricating shop owned by a local named Armando, a business which has been in his family for generations. There have also been numerous times when I’ve been invited to indulge in whatever a local family might be cooking for dinner over an open fire in the street, such as a bowl of steamy caldoza (stew), or my favorite – chicharrones (delicious little chunks of deep-fried pork belly).\n\nYou can view the valley from above from several different points including El Mirador, the snack bar on the west side of the Bacunayagua Bridge, and Iglesia de Monserrate, the church on top of the cliff overlooking the city of Matanzas. But to really discover the true beauty of what lies within, you’ll want to get right down into it and meander through the countryside and the tiny villages. The Hershey train runs through the Valley from Matanzas to Havana and you may have time to take a few photos as it makes its scheduled stops (especially if the train breaks down, which is a distinct possibility) but you’ll be at the mercy of the train schedule. Your best bet is to hire a taxi to take you through at your own pace and if you split the cost with a friend, you can probably do this for under 50CUC each, for a few hours of exploring. I was lucky enough to have my amigo Jorge Felix, a local photographer who's passionate about showing Cuban life through his lens, accompany me. Not only was he a wonderful guide but he offered tips on how to take better photos as well.\n\nThe highlight of our drive was stopping at Casa Ophelia – a sprawling ranch on a lovely large property which included a small lake complete with grazing cows, and piglets and chickens running amuck. Her yard was littered with old appliance and car parts, miscellaneous construction material and an old rusty jeep, which I’m certain will be put back into commission someday. Ophelia is the matriarch of the family and the original owner of the home where she lives with her son and grandson. After some gentle coaxing and a dose of Jorge’s charm, she felt comfortable enough to allow us to take photos and to share a few stories about her rural life. Even though Cubans are known for their openness and willingness to share, it's still such a privilege to be allowed into their personal space and to record what we find there.\n\nNearing the end of our drive, we made a stop at a little souvenir stand and “typical Cuban ranch”, as described by the State-run tour companies promoting Yumuri Valley jeep excursions. We had the place to ourselves (the bonus of doing your own thing off the tourist trail), so we had time to chat with the locals working there about life and business in the valley. I had my first taste of Piña de Raton, a delicious type of mini-pineapple, and had just enough time to chase it down with a glass of guarapa con ron (sugar cane juice with rum) when we heard engines in the distance. It was the sound of the jeep caravan ten or twelve vehicles long, carrying a throng of sunburnt tourists to their last stop after a marathon day of boating, snorkelling and horseback riding. That was our queue to make our exit.\n\nThe Yumuri Valley may not have any of the mogotes (unique, steep-sided hill formations) which draw so many travelers to Viñales, arguably the most famous valley on the island. But Yumuri possesses its own indelible charm -- winding roads (some no more than a dirt path), quaint villages, sprawling pineapple fields, guajiros riding their horses and carts, and tons of shades of green in every direction. A much slower pace than that of the city, it’s peaceful and serene, and definitely worth taking a private tour to observe life in the Valley and experience real tranquility.\n\nWhile there are many lessons from daily Cuban life which may serve us well (ie their coffee-brewing expertise or the ingenuity with which they re-use and recycle items we would normally throw in the trash), their ability to exercise the patience required to stand in very long lineups has been perfected into an art form. I’m not talking about waiting ten minutes behind five people for a fresh omelet at the buffet. I’m talking about really long lineups waiting for ordinary things that we take for granted, like buying a block of cheese or hopping on a bus or buying a SIM card for a cell phone. These are often epic endeavors for the average Cuban, requiring a mountain of both time and fortitude. For example, on a recent trip to the bank in downtown Matanzas, I was told by the crowd of locals gathered on the sidewalk that the power had gone out (a regular occurance) and they had closed the doors until it could be restored. I waited there for over 30 minutes under the blistering sun -- sweat literally coursing like a river from my neck to my belly button -- until the doors opened again. It was another 30 minutes before I was allowed to take care of my business with the teller. But this is normal everyday stuff for a Cuban.\n\nSo I was ready to pounce on the guy standing behind me as I waited to pass through Customs in Toronto after a recent return flight from Cuba. Stressing about the 200 people in line, he could not stop complaining. “Ya know, the airport and the damn government just don’t care about people anymore. Don’t they realize everyone is just tired and we want to go home? Why do we have to wait in such a long lineup to deal with a crappy machine instead of a live person? This is just f***ing ridiculous!” The interesting thing is, it only took about 15 minutes to get from the end of that line all the way to the baggage claim. 15 MINUTES!! The kiosks they’ve installed to scan passports and print customs cards have sped up the process significantly, making it all remarkably efficient. One is hard-pressed to use that adjective – efficient -- to describe anything in Cuba.\n\nFor a quick second I felt compelled to turn around and say “Hey buddy, you just came from a place where people wait in line for an hour behind six people at the bank, and there's a guard at the door telling them when to enter, where to sit, and when they are allowed to approach the counter. And because almost nobody can afford their own wheels, they wait at the bus stop with 200 other locals prepared to pack themselves like sardines into an already jammed, stinky, stuffy, dirty bus in order to get to their unairconditioned office or school. I didn’t hear any of those people complain. Please sir, recognize how fortunate you are to have the freedom to travel at will in the first place, and then do everyone a favor and shut your pie-hole.”\n\nBut no. Instead, I remained tranquila like a Cubana who knows there are things in life that we simply can’t change, such as the lineup at airport customs or the bad attitude other people have as a result of their ignorance. We can, however, improve upon some of our own personal deficits by observing other cultures and people who happen to be better at certain things than we are. Cubans are better at patience, hands down."
