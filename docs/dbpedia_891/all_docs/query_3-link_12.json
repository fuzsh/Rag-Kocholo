        "text": "Theater\n\nMatanzas City has a strong theatrical tradition, highlights the Seasons Theater, founded in 1994, which is a puppeteer group that remains at the forefront of the movement of figures in the Island. His work is characterized by the rescue of the universal and national puppeteer playwright.\n\nThe Sauto Theater stands out, it opened in 1863 and since then it has been a proud symbol of the city. The 775-seat U-shaped theater is almost completely covered with wooden panels. It has three balconies and its floor can be raised to turn the auditorium into a ballroom."
