        "text": "Day 1 USA- Havana\n\nArrive at Jose Marti International Airport (airport transfer included)\n\nVisit the house and grounds of Ernest Hemingway, Finca Vigía, on your way into Havana (time permitting)\n\nIn 1940 Hemingway, with his new wife Martha, purchased a home outside Havana, where the couple lived for the next twenty years. The Hemingway’s named the site Finca Vigía, or “lookout farm,” and shared their home with dozens of Hemingway’s beloved cats, as well as trophies from many successful hunts and fishing expeditions. During their time at the Finca, Hemingway became a fixture of Havana, and stayed in the country longer than many Americans chose to after relations between Cuba and the United States began to deteriorate. He fished extensively aboard his boat, Pilar, and enjoyed the island lifestyle, hanging out in Havana, penning some of his signature works, and entertaining guests. His home, with many original furnishings and personal artifacts can be viewed today.\n\nHead to lodging for check in and orientation\n\nExperience a ride in a classic convertible car around Havana City\n\nHavana is beloved by American visitors with its collection of thousands of vintage American cars, manufactured before the Revolution and subsequent US embargo in 1960. In the absence of automobile imports, these living relics are preserved by Cuban mechanics or improvised fixes by the owners themselves. Experience an hour in a classic convertible Chevy, Ford or Oldsmobile.\n\nEnjoy a welcome rooftop dinner at paladar La Guarida with a live concert\n\nDAY 2 – Havana\n\nVisit Old Havana and learn about Havana’s world-renowned UNESCO heritage designated architecture on an expertly guided walking tour (2 hrs)\n\nThere is no better introduction to Havana than a walk through Old Havana. On this walk you will explore Old Havana’s five major plazas and see the interiors of cathedrals and other important buildings. UNESCO designated Old Havana as a world heritage site in 1982. Although today Havana is a sprawling metropolis of more than two million people, the old center retains an interesting mix of Baroque and neoclassical monuments, beautiful balconies and courtyards.\n\nLunch at El del Frente paladar (a staff and client favorite – try the daiquiris!)\n\nVisit the National Lyrical Theater, one of the oldest buildings in Havana, for a private recital\n\nOn this exclusive visit, Pacheco will introduce you to his father, Maestro Pacheco, and have you sit in on one of his classes. Maestro Pacheco was the director of the Cuban National Opera for six years. He is also the only Cuban opera singer to graduate from the prestigious Tchaikovsky Conservatory in Moscow. You will enjoy a 30 minute concert by his top students singing classic Cuban works as well as Cuban opera\n\nExperience a private concert with Vocal Leo choir, directed by Corina Campos, one of the most important choir directors in Havana—and Pacheco’s beloved mom.\n\nNighttime concert with Pacheco’s favorite Salsa Orchestra (TBA)\n\nDAY 3 – Havana\n\nVisit famed Abdala Studio, where many famous Cuban records were recorded, and enjoy a private concert\n\nVisit two prestigious music conservatories where Pacheco studied, Caturla and ISA (Instituto Superior de Arte) and enjoy a brief concert by students.\n\nThe sprawling campus of the Instituto Superior de Arte was originally a golf course frequented by Havana’s elite. In the 1970s, the Cuban government built an arts institution here, with vaulted brick and terra cotta structures. Today it is the most prestigious college in Havana for music, painting, and ceramics.\n\nLunch at Casa Mia paladar\n\nEnjoy an afternoon of live music performance with Pacheco’s hand-picked Cuban All Stars\n\nVisit Fabrica de Arte Cubano , The hottest club in Cuba and one of Pacheco’s favorite places to perform and go see the hottest new talent perform\n\nHavana’s hottest spot for nightlife, this converted warehouse features a four story art gallery/film space with multiple stages for live music and outdoor/indoor bars.\n\nDAY 5 – Matanzas or Las Terrazas Biosphere\n\nLunch at Bistro Kuba paladar\n\nEnjoy an exclusive concert by the Failde Orchestra in the historic Sauto Theater\n\nConsidered one of Cuba’s most important orchestras, the Failde has dedicated itself to rescuing the danzón genre. The danzón was first popularized in the 1800s, and today is still the official music and dance of Cuba. In this special presentation the director of the orchestra will explain how the danzón was originally danced, and a pair of dancers will demonstrate. Though their specialty is the danzón, the orchestra performs a variety of other genres as well; through this unique musical performance you will experience a master class of the history of Cuban popular music.\n\nReturn to Havana"
