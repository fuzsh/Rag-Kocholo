        "text": "The third edition of the Varadero Josone Rumba, Jazz & Son Festival kicked off to the rhythm of good Cuban music at Sauto Theater in this western city, which enters its second day on Tuesday.\n\nFor the first time in the event’s history, a venue other than Josone Park in the seaside resort of Varadero is hosting performances as a sub-venue of the festival. The Sauto Theater, a National Monument, propitiated a special opening with Los Muñequitos de Matanzas, one of the legends of rumba music in Cuba.\n\nDiosdado Ramos, director of the rumba band founded in 1952, told Prensa Latina that it is a pleasure to participate again in this event, especially when we begin the concert program with our music that will bring together musicians from Cuba and other nations.\n\nRamos thanked musician Issac Delgado, director of the Varadero Josone Rumba, Jazz & Son Festival, for all he does to contribute to the development of Cuban culture by organizing an event of such importance that fills with joy all the artists who participate in it. Until August 27, Matanzas province will be the epicenter of a festival that features excellent Cuban musicians who, along with international artists, will guarantee exceptional evenings to show Cuba’s ability to host events.\n\n(With information and photos Prensa Latina)"
