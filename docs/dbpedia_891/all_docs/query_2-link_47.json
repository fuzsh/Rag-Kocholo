It features an exterior mosaic mural by Amelia Pelaez.\n\nCoppelia was built in 1966. This popular ice cream parlor composed of flying saucer pods was designed by Mario Girona.\n\nHotel Riviera (Polevitzky, Johnson and Associates, 1957) was built by Meyer Lansky as the flashiest of the 1950s casino hotels.\n\nWe’ll also see important examples of Art-Deco-style architecture such as:\n\nLopez Serrano Building, with its strong reminiscence of American Skyscrapers, resembles a miniature Empire State Building with the bottom 70 floors chopped off. The López Serrano building is Vedado’s most distinctive Art Deco architecture example. It was built in 1932 by Mira & Roisch Architecture Firm, it was the highest residential building in Havana for many years.\n\n​\n\nThe House of Catalina Laza was built in the 1920s by Juan Pedro Baro. This beautiful mansion features Art Deco interiors by Rene Lalique and gardens by J.F.C. Forestier. The house has a fascinating love story. Married socialite Catalina Lasa fell in love with landowner and widower Juan Pedro Baró in 1905. Cuba had no divorce laws at the time, so the lovers escaped to Paris to continue their affair. On their return, Baro built this outstanding mansion for the beautiful Catalina Laza.\n\nWe are now entering Fusterlandia, the studio, residence, and wild kingdom of José Rodriguez Fuster, one of the most important Cuban ceramists and painters today.\n\nFuster has turned an entire neighborhood in western Havana into a giant art installation that involves locals and their homes as part of the exhibit. He engaged and trained many neighborhood residents as artisans, especially youth. This is art for and by the people on an epic scale!\n\nLunch hosted by Jose Fuster.\n\nAfternoon: Visit to Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA), the country's top art academy. School departments include Music, Modern Dance, Drama, and Visual Arts. The schools were designed and built by architects Cuban Ricardo Porro and the Italians Roberto Gottardi and Vittorio Garatti from 1961 to 1965, in the former affluent neighborhood of Country Club Park (today known as Cubanacán), specifically on the grounds of the Havana Country Club golf course.\n\n​\n\nToday the buildings are considered Cuba's best example of post-Revolutionary architecture but at the time they were thought too sensual and avant-garde. The project was halted, though the school did open. The complex fell into ruin and amazingly, in 2001 the Cuban government approached the three architects and asked them to complete the project. The restoration was completed in 2009.\n\nEvening: Farewell dinner at one of Havana's very best paladars.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nDAY EIGHT Saturday, November 22 - B7 - Good Bye Cuba!\n\n*Breakfast included"
