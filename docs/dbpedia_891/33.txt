MATANZAS, Cuba, Oct 12 (ACN) The emblematic Sauto Theatre, National Monument, will host this Friday night the Solemn Assembly of the People's Power that will greet the 325th anniversary of the city of San Carlos and San Severino de Matanzas, the first modern city in Cuba.

To develop a Solemn Assembly for the anniversary of the foundation of the city constitutes a traditional gesture of respect for local history, an act whose realization in the Sauto Theater, a space of high identity and patrimonial value, is an awaited event, Maritza Castillo Díaz, told ACN.

La Vigía, the city's founding square, will also be the venue this Friday for Gala Matanzas 325, a three-beat concert by the local Concert Band, Los Muñequitos de Matanzas, and the Compañía Danza Espiral.

The Matanzas Chamber Choir, directed by maestro José Antonio Méndez Valencia; the wind quintet Atenas Brass Ensemble, Afrocuba, Conchita Torres and their group, and repentistas such as Orismay Hernández and Ricardo González, will also participate in the cultural gala, among other artists.

New will be the use, during the show, of video mapping, technology based on the use of video projectors to display images on real surfaces and achieve an artistic effect out of the ordinary, based on the movements created by animation.

Noslén González, specialist of the provincial Direction of Culture in Matanzas, explained that schools, cultural, educational and social institutions, streets and squares will become active stages to profess respect and love towards the city of José Jacinto Milanés and Carilda Oliver Labra.
