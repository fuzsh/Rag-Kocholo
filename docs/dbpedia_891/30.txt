One of the most famous Cuban theaters of the 19th century. It still preserves interesting samples of mural painting. A jewel of neoclassical architecture, with excellent acoustics, the Sauto was built by Italian architect Daniel Dal'Aglio, who also painted the frescoes on its inner walls. It was first opened in 1863, and scores of nationally and internationally renowned figures have performed in the ballets, operas, musical comedies, concerts, variety shows and plays that have been presented on its stage. It has now been declared a national monument.
