Swayze took lessons at his mother’s Houston dance studio and later studied at the Harkness and Joffrey Ballet schools in New York City. He began his professional career as Prince Charming in Disney on Parade and appeared briefly as Danny Zuko in the original Broadway production of Grease. In 1979 he made his film debut in Skatetown, U.S.A. and subsequently appeared in a series of television projects. He returned to the big screen in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders (1983). That film—which also starred Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon, and Diane Lane—was a critical and commercial success.
