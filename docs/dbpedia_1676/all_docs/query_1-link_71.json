        "text": "Last night I met a truly unique individual who introduced me to something called The Swayze Method. It’s kind of like The Star Wars Machete Order or the Pixar Universe Theory, but way more creative.\n\nThe Swayze Method consists of watching the following Patrick Swayze movies in order: Point Break, Roadhouse, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything- Julie Newmar, and Ghost.\n\n“My friends and I would do this thing in college where we would watch a bunch of movies starring the same actor,” this individual said. The narrative goes like this:\n\n“Patrick Swayze quits his hustle as a bank robbing surfer because it’s too hard on his body. He gets a job as a cooler to keep himself clean. He uses the skills he learned as a criminal to bring order to a Midwestern town but when things go south, he goes on the run, becomes a woman and dies.”\n\n“Point Break and Roadhouse are interchangeable,” this person adds.\n\nThere you have it. The Swayze Method, starring Patrick Swayze: a whole new way of enjoying Patrick Swayze movies."
