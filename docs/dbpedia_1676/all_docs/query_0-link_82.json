        "text": "This, the first full-length feature film from the young American writer/director Greg Marcks, looks at a moment in time — 11.14pm, when a car crash occurs at a small-town intersection — from a series of different perspectives. What fascinates Marcks is the million and one little things that lead up to one devastating moment. His is an interweaving narrative driven by chance, accidents, collisions and failed cover-ups. 11:14 boasts a talented cast that includes Barbara Hershey, Hilary Swank and Patrick Swayze, and all are put to good effect. Marcks keeps up your curiosity and has a nice line in black humour, including a running gag about a penis that has gone missing. An intriguing mix of the absurd and the macabre. Four stars Cosmo Landesman"
