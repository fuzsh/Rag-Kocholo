        "text": "As part of my ever-expanding Point Break “research,” I decided to fill a gaping hole in my personal film history. I’d somehow reached my 40s without ever watching the Patrick Swayze cult classic Road House, which suddenly felt like a critical absence. How can I truly opine on Swayze’s scene-stealing turn as adrenaline junkie Bodhi if my closest frame of reference is a dead guy in a tearjerker (Ghost) and a charismatic, quasi-predatory dance instructor (Dirty Dancing)?\n\nIf you’ve never seen Road House, here’s a quick synopsis: It’s the bar scenes from Over the Top plus the vigilantism of Out for Justice, with mullets, amazing one-liners, and casually stupid villainy.\n\nRoad House is famously a bad movie that’s sneakily good. I think it might just be a bad movie, period, with just enough good stuff to make it entertaining. The good stuff:\n\nSwayze posted up at the bar, cool as you like, while all hell breaks loose\n\nSwayze’s general “you won’t like me when I’m angry” vibe\n\nSwayze cracking heads\n\nLines like, “nobody ever wins a fight” (whoa!)\n\nSam Elliot, playing Swayze’s older mentor (has Elliot ever not been the old guy?)\n\nI was entertained, but when the credits rolled, I mostly had a lot of questions.\n\nSwayze plays Dalton, a famous bouncer and bad ass. And there begins our inquiry.\n\nThe film establishes Dalton’s bonafides in vague terms—we don’t know exactly why he’s revered, just that everyone is awed by him. Which felt super weird honestly. Is there such a thing as a famous bouncer? Like ever, in the history of the world?\n\nRoad House literally begins with the owner of a Jasper, Missouri bar traveling to New York City—a distance of 1,172 miles—to recruit Dalton because his bar is so out of control, only one man can possibly fix it. What?! The nearest equivalent I can think of is a terrible NFL team—like, for instance, my historically-bad Detroit Lions—trying to turn things around by signing Tom Brady at his peak. And then Brady leads them to the Super Bowl while ripping out a guy’s throat.\n\nBut how does a bar owner from Podunk, Missouri hear about Dalton in the first place? Is there a bouncer version of Sports Illustrated? It defies all logic. Especially in a pre-Internet era. I could see word getting out after Dalton bounces someone on TikTok. But not in 1989.\n\nThe thing is—Dalton isn’t even the only Hall of Fame bouncer in this movie. Wade Garrett (Elliot) is even more famously bad ass than Dalton!\n\nAlthough I just compared Dalton to an athlete, a coach is a more fitting analogue. Because Dalton isn't your garden variety bouncer, checking IDs and tossing drunks. Dalton's an uber bouncer known as a cooler. The cooler tells the regular bouncers what to do—usually with a jerk of the head—but also basically runs the place. Dalton fires several people once he gets to Missouri and also somehow resupplies the bar with liquor once the local muckity-muck (Ben Gazzara) makes things unnecessarily difficult.\n\nDalton conquers the rowdy bar through the use of three rules:\n\nExpect the unexpected.\n\nTake it outside.\n\nBe nice.\n\nI guess this is the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) method of bouncing.\n\nI’m not old enough to have hung out in bars in the 80s, but I have a hard time believing they were as out of control as Road House would have us believe. Then again, I’ve never been to Jasper, Missouri.\n\nEveryone is spoiling for a fight in this movie. Not just a brawl though—guys pull knives at the slightest provocation. They aren’t shy about cutting people, and have no fear of the consequences. Jasper, Missouri is apparently a lawless watering hole on the order of Deadwood or Mos Eisley. There’s a passing reference to the police—the muckity-muck has them in his back pocket—which I guess is code for Anything Goes. Vic Vega’s song and dance in Reservoir Dogs was the last time I saw violence this casual (also featuring a knife, come to think of it).\n\nAll this just gives our hero license to fight fire with fire. Which is good, because the brawls are the second best thing about this movie (the first being the really choice bits of dialogue). It’s just how we get there that has me scratching my head.\n\nJasper, Missouri—I don’t know why I keep using the full name, it just feels appropriate—is run by a business man, the aforementioned muckity-muck, with deep pockets and an entourage of muscle. (His character has a name but it honestly doesn’t matter. Muckity-muck imparts the right degree of clout and self-importance.) This guy runs a protection racket over the entire town. Businesses that don’t pay end up trashed.\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what the mafia would look operating in Missouri, this isn’t it. In one scene, the muckity-muck has a monster truck destroy a car dealer showroom while a crowd looks on and he stands around cackling. There are people in the showroom at the time. Attempted murder much?\n\nThe reasons he orders the hit aren’t exactly clear. Nor is his complete disregard of any potential consequences. The police may be in his pocket, but what's to stop someone from going to the FBI or a regional newspaper? At the very least, wouldn't the insurance company have questions? (This don't look like an act of God to me, Earl.) The only logical explanation is that Jasper, Missouri exists on an alternate plane of existence, completely cut-off from our own and also inescapable.\n\nThe only time the police show up is at the very end of the movie, literally after the smoke clears. There’s a dead guy laying in a bloody heap, surrounded by a bunch of guilty-looking people. Here’s the dialogue, verbatim:\n\nSheriff: “Alright, who’s gonna tell me what the hell happened here?”\n\nThe guilty parties, one by one: “I didn’t see anything.”\n\nAnd that’s that! Nobody is arrested and no further questions are asked. I guess it’s just another dead body. It’s nothing Jasper, Missouri hasn’t seen before.\n\nRoad House is an entertaining watch, but it’s not a good movie. It’s not even in the same league as Point Break, which has its own B-movie qualities.\n\nRoad House is worth watching for fans of:\n\nSwayze\n\nSwayze’s naked butt\n\nSwayze shirtless and glistening\n\nSwayze quietly menacing\n\nSwayze busting skulls\n\nSam Elliot as a long-haired silver fox\n\nReally great dialogue, mixed in with lines that have you go, huh?\n\nIf any of that tickles your fancy, Road House is currently streaming on Netflix."
