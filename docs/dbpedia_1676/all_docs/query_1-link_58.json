        "text": "Lionsgate announced the sequel to \"Dirty Dancing\" in August 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, John Feltheimer, CEO of Lionsgate, announced that a sequel to the classic 1987 film \"Dirty Dancing, which starred Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze, was in the works at the studio.\n\n\"And to reveal one of the worst-kept secrets in Hollywood, we're pleased to confirm that Jennifer Grey will both executive produce and star in a new 'Dirty Dancing' movie for Lionsgate,\" Feltheimer said according to \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"It will be exactly the kind of romantic, nostalgic movie that the franchise's fans have been waiting for, and that has made it the biggest-selling library title in the company's history,\" he continued.\n\nSince the 1987 film there has also been a related film, titled \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,\" and a made-for-TV remake.\n\nThe film's director confirmed that the story would take place at Kellerman's resort.\n\nThe original \"Dirty Dancing\" took place at the fictional Catskills resort Kellerman's. Grey played Francis \"Baby\" Houseman, who went there on vacation with her family and fell in love with dance instructor Johnny Castle, played by Swayze.\n\nIn May 2022, Lionsgate announced Jonathan Levine would direct the new feature. He told Deadline at the time that the new film would take place in the 1990s and that Grey would reprise her role as Baby, who returns to Kellerman's to reflect on her romance with Johnny.\n\nLevine said the movie would also feature a new young couple falling in love at the resort in a similar manner to Baby and Johnny. He added that Baby's story would overlap with the couple's in some way.\n\n\"This film exists in a dialogue with the original. We want to introduce this story to a whole new generation,\" Levine told Deadline.\n\n\"The most important thing for us was having Jennifer on board,\" he added. \"She is an invaluable collaborator.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to collaborate with Jennifer to bring this beautiful story of summer and romance and dancing to a generation of new fans. And to the longtime ones, I promise we will not ruin your childhood. We will tackle the assignment with sophistication, ambition, and, above all, love,\" the filmmaker said.\n\nPatrick Swayze will not be replaced in the new film, but producers are hoping the late actor will be part of it somehow.\n\nSwayze died of pancreatic cancer in 2009 at the age of 57. In an interview with People about the \"Dirty Dancing\" sequel in November 2020, Grey was clear that no one would be trying to replace the actor as Johnny Castle.\n\n\"All I can say is there is no replacing anyone who's passed â€” you never try to repeat anything that's magic like that,\" she said. \"You just go for something different.\"\n\nIn his interview with Deadline, Levine said that \"Johnny's absence looms large over the story\" and he is in talks with Swayze's estate about the film because \"Johnny is a part of Baby's journey in the story.\" It's unclear how the film might incorporate Swayze at this time.\n\nAudiences will be introduced to new characters and other original characters might return.\n\nLevine told Deadline in May 2022 that he wanted to \"involve as many people from the original as is appropriate\" in the sequel to \"Dirty Dancing.\" But he confirmed that there would be new characters starring in the film as part of the multi-generational approach to the romance in the film. The younger actors hadn't been cast at the time of the interview.\n\nIn her November 2022 interview with Extra, Grey appeared to confirm that she's not the only original cast member who will reprise their role.\n\nShe said the film will include \"other characters that are from the original\" 1987 film and called the preproduction process of the sequel \"tricky and also exciting.\" It's unclear which other original characters will appear in the new film.\n\nThe soundtrack will pay homage to the original \"Dirty Dancing\" but also feature new era-specific music.\n\nOf course, \"Dirty Dancing\" is famous for its musical soundtrack as much as its dancing and the iconic love story it tells. The most memorable song from the film, \"(I've Had) The Time of My Life,\" originally performed by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, is still a staple at weddings and family parties.\n\nIn his interview with Deadline, Levine said that \"Dirty Dancing 2\" would include music from the original film (\"Hungry Eyes\" will reportedly return) and new, '90s songs. Deadline reported that the new movie will feature '90s hip-hop and potentially include songs from artists who were popular at the time, like Alanis Morissette and Liz Phair.\n\n\"Dirty Dancing 2\" is eyeing a 2024 release, according to Variety."
