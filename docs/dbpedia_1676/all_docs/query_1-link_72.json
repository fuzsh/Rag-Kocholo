        "text": "When we were coming up with the top 100 sports movies, we were tasked with nominating certain films before voting on them. It was a fun exercise, and I loved seeing the creativity and knowledge of my co-workers. For whatever reason, “Point Break,” the 1991 action movie starring Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, Gary Busey and Lori Petty — also directed by future Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow — came to mind.\n\nRelated: The Athletic’s Top 100 Sports Movies of All-Time\n\nWhy? It’s not a sports movie in the traditional sense, but there are scenes with surfing — lots of them. There’s a skydiving scene. Not to mention one of the most famous beach football games in movie history.\n\n“The beach football scene tells a story of local know-how versus talent and discipline,” actor Freddie Prinze Jr. told The Athletic’s Andy Kamenetzky. “Johnny Utah’s talent allows him to dominate a local beach football team with years of experience even with a bum knee. It’s classic Pro versus Joe and a reminder not to dick around with college athletes.”\n\nThough sports wasn’t the actual theme of the movie, which was about Reeves’ character, Johnny Utah, infiltrating a gang of bank robbers (who love to surf and do other extreme sports) and trying to take them down, sports have a direct influence in the film: There are several thrilling surfing scenes. (Surfing is indeed a sport and a difficult athletic accomplishment to master). Also, skydiving is a sport, and football — obviously a sport.\n\nAdditionally, there’s a lot of “research” that can be done on this film that lends to it being a sports movie. For one, the physical nature of the roles in “Point Break” required some level of athleticism.\n\nPer IMDb, which I trust when it comes to filmmaking:\n\nReeves “practiced with UCLA quarterback coaches, to help with the football scene.”\n\nThe actors themselves “trained with former world-class professional surfer Dennis Jarvis on Kauai, Hawaii.”\n\nSwayze “was an accomplished skydiver and took part in the big skydiving scene. He made 55 jumps in total.”\n\nAnd lastly, the football scene was filmed at the same location where the soccer scene was filmed for “The Karate Kid,” a movie that made our list. (That’s just a random — yet important — note I wanted to throw out to you, our faithful subscribers.)\n\nOne fact that seems to get glossed over by those who don’t see this as a sports movie has to do with Reeves’ character. Johnny Utah was a former quarterback at Ohio State before he was an FBI agent (“FBI” said with extreme emphasis), so that’s sports in the traditional “big four” sense.\n\n“I think Johnny Utah is one of the most underrated southpaw QBs,” said Greg Sestero, who co-wrote “The Disaster Artist” and co-starred in the cult-classic “The Room.”\n\nJake Weisman, co-star, co-writer and co-creator of Comedy Central’s “Corporate” — you should watch it; it’s beyond hilarious, and we went to college together — thinks sports is a central theme to the film on so many levels that maybe aren’t easily apparent on the first watch.\n\n“As I get older, the more I realize that playing sports as a kid prepares you for life. The repetition and desire to not fail necessary to be good at sports is perfectly applicable to adult life, where you can only get something you really want if you work your ass off for it,” Weisman said. “In that way, I absolutely see ‘Point Break’ as a sports movie. The way Bodhi and his gang attack the ocean is the same way they attack the art of bank robbing. The intensity and passion they show for life makes them good at what they do.\n\n“Same goes for Johnny Utah. He was a great football player, and the dedication he showed to football prepared him for his extremely difficult job hunting down criminals.”\n\nSestero agreed with this sentiment.\n\n“I’d go with yes,” he said when asked if it was a sports movie.\n\nPlus, “The Big Lebowski” — and I do love this movie, so it’s not a knock on this film — might have amazing scenes involving bowling, but it should fall in the same category as “Point Break” for this exercise. What is “The Big Lebowski” about? The first Iraq War? The first Bush administration? Living in Los Angeles in the ’90s? Creedence Clearwater Revival? Hating the Eagles? It’s mega re-watchable and has a cult following, but is it a sports movie? You can say the same about “Point Break.”\n\nThat is not a takedown of “The Big Lebowski” but more an example that “Point Break” can be a sports movie if you look at it through a different lens, like my amazing co-workers did with “Lebowski.”\n\nTo solidify my, Weisman’s and Sestero’s points, I took to Twitter and polled the faithful. It did not go well.\n\nA large majority said no, so I guess I have to go with the consensus. But I could see it either way.\n\nPrinze Jr. doesn’t, though.\n\n“Definitely not a sports movie,” he said. “Action film all day long.”\n\nPaul Scheer — friend of The Athletic, comedian and co-host of the popular movie podcast “How Did This Get Made?” — agreed with Prinze Jr. via Twitter DM to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha.\n\n“LOVE Point Break but Point Break isn’t a sports movie. If you think it is then you must think ‘Donnie Brasco’ is a movie about Italian food or ‘Blue Crush’ is a movie about hotel management. Sports movies are normally about someone or a group of people overcoming insurmountable odds to achieve a dream, win a championship or play baseball with ghosts,” Scheer said. “‘Point Break’ is a crime movie that just happens to involve robbers that are surfers. They aren’t even pro surfers. They are just recreational surfers. If they were stealing money to enter a contest then maybe you have a point. But these guys have one need and it’s for speed. Not sportsmanship or winning.”\n\nL.A. Kings president Luc Robitaille, a Hockey Hall of Famer whose acting credits include “Sudden Death,” “Arli$$,” “D2: The Mighty Ducks” and “Bones” was even more definitive in his opinion as to whether “Point Break” is a sports movie.\n\n“Bank robbing,” Robitaille said, “is not a sport.”\n\n“Point Break” wasn’t the only movie we discussed — debated? Argued? Arm-wrestled? — in regard to its sports movie bona fides. Here are some additional flicks that were offered as sports movies. We can see why, but we say, no, they’re not sports movies. (Or are they?)\n\n“Fletch” (1985): No, it is not a sports movie, but it does have lots of Lakers references. The specific scene would be Fletch’s dream sequence in which he’s a member of the team and has Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Chick Hearn swooning about his skill. It’s a comedy that centers around journalism but not much more. — Josh Cooper\n\n“Finding Forrester” (2000): This is a film about a young man finding his identity and learning about life from an old mentor. Just because the Jamal Wallace character (played by Rob Brown) happens to play basketball doesn’t mean it’s a sports movie. Brown, though, would later go on to play Ernie Davis in “The Express” and Kenyon Stone in “Coach Carter.” So if there’s a sports movie acting Hall of Fame, Brown should get consideration. But not for “Forrester.” — Cooper\n\n“Fresh” (1994): In this gem from Boaz Yakin, who directed “Remember the Titans,” the philosophy behind chess plays a huge role in propelling the story forward. After seeing a tragedy on the streets, Fresh, the 12-year-old protagonist who does work for two drug dealers, uses the lessons his dad, a drunken street chess player (Samuel L. Jackson), imparts to pit the two dealers against each other. It’s a fascinating film, and when we had “Searching for Bobby Fischer” on the list, this movie popped up in discussions. Is it a sports movie? Ultimately, no it isn’t. But it is well worth seeing. — Rob Peterson\n\n“Lucas” (1986): A nerdy, bullied 14-year-old who loves observing insects goes out for the football team “because the males who demonstrate physical prowess are the most attractive to the females.” His football equipment doesn’t fit, and as one coach pointedly notes, neither does Lucas. He finally talks his way into a game. He’s not good, but he’s spirited. The game ends poorly when Lucas ends up at the bottom of a pile going after a fumble, but the movie ends with one of the more famous slow-clap scenes in the teen movie genre. But is “Lucas” a sports movie? That’d be stretching it. — Peterson\n\n“Take Me Out to the Ball Game” (1949): It has Gene Kelly! Frank Sinatra! Esther Williams! It also has a baseball theme, and Kelly and Sinatra are players who, according to IMDb “run into trouble with their team’s new female owner and a gambler who doesn’t want them to win the pennant.” So, it’s like “Major League” plus “The Natural” with crooning and dancing. This clearly makes it a … musical with a sports background, but not a sports movie. — Peterson\n\n“The Naked Gun” (1988): The baseball scene at the end with Leslie Nielsen as the umpire/Enrico Pallazzo and Reggie Jackson is beyond funny, but it doesn’t qualify this film as a sports movie. And O.J. Simpson being in the movie DEFINITELY doesn’t qualify it as a sports film. — Cooper\n\n“The Running Man” (1987): Set in the dystopian future of 2017 (!), it’s like “The Hunger Games” in spandex (!!). In “The Running Man,” convicted criminals have the choice to “do hard time or prime time!” The cons, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, run for their lives from “American Gladiator”-like foes with weapons out to kill them. And it’s all done before a live studio audience and is the highest-rated TV show in history. It’s a game, all right, but is running for your life a sport? Probably not, but I wouldn’t be surprised to find something like this on Netflix in the next decade. — Peterson\n\n“The Sting” (1973): As I was rattling off names of sports movies to a friend of mine, I mentioned this one.\n\n“The Sting?”\n\nYeah, it’s —\n\n“You know, I love that movie,” my friend said. “But never have I considered it a sports movie.”\n\nIt has —\n\n“Cards and horse racing,” my friend noted, “but definitely not a sports movie.”\n\nBut the card scene is great, Lonergan.\n\n“Yes, but not a sports movie.”\n\nStill —\n\n“Nope.”\n\nIf you squint real hard, maybe you could see “The Sting” as a sports movie. But I had to agree, though it would have been fun to put the 1973 winner for Best Picture and six other Oscars on the ballot to see how it would have done in the rankings … or if it would have just ticked people off. — Peterson\n\nAre there others that could be considered sports movies? Let us know in the comments below.\n\n(Photo of Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze: Richard Foreman / Fotos International / Getty Images)"
