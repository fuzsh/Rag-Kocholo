        "text": "Patrick Swayze (born August 18, 1952, Houston, Texas, U.S.—died September 14, 2009, Los Angeles, California) was an American actor and dancer who was perhaps best known for his performances in Dirty Dancing (1987) and Ghost (1990).\n\nSwayze took lessons at his mother’s Houston dance studio and later studied at the Harkness and Joffrey Ballet schools in New York City. He began his professional career as Prince Charming in Disney on Parade and appeared briefly as Danny Zuko in the original Broadway production of Grease. In 1979 he made his film debut in Skatetown, U.S.A. and subsequently appeared in a series of television projects. He returned to the big screen in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Outsiders (1983). That film—which also starred Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Matt Dillon, and Diane Lane—was a critical and commercial success.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAfter appearing in Red Dawn (1984) and Youngblood (1986), Swayze had a major breakthrough with his performance as a seductive dance instructor in the hit romance Dirty Dancing (1987). The film became a cult classic and earned Swayze a Golden Globe nomination. He next starred in a series of action films—including Road House (1989) and Next of Kin (1989)—before being cast as the romantic lead opposite Demi Moore in Ghost, a supernatural drama that was a box office sensation.

His later films included Point Break (1991); To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar (1995), in which Swayze played against type as a drag queen; Donnie Darko (2001); and Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004)."
