Harrold and Emily Gravett's The Imaginary novel announced additional cast on Tuesday.\n\nThe newly announced cast includes (pictured above from left to right):\n\nTeiya Ichiryūsai as Honneko Garigari\n\nMitsuaki Kanuka as Koyuki\n\nIkue Ōtani as Doron\n\nKokoro Hirasawa as Julia\n\nEito Kawahara as John\n\nThe film's main cast includes:\n\nKokoro Terada as Rudger\n\nRio Suzuki as Amanda\n\nSakura Andō as Lizzie\n\nRiisa Naka as Emily\n\nTakayuki Yamada as Jinzan\n\nAtsuko Takahata as Downbeat Grandma\n\nIssey Ogata as Mr. Bunting\n\nAkira Terao as Old Dog\n\nHana Sugisaki as Aurora\n\nStudio Ponoc stated it will have more announcements soon for the film, including the English voice cast.\n\nThe film will open in Japan on December 15 with the title Yaneura no Rudger (Rudger in the Attic).\n\nStudio Ponoc delayed the film last year from its original summer 2022 release date due to \"new challenges\" stemming from the film's production methods and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nYoshiyuki Momose (\"Life Ain't Gonna Lose\" short in Ponoc's Modest Heroes anime anthology, Ni no Kuni film, Ponoc's Olympic Games short \"Tomorrow's Leaves\") is directing the film. Yoshiaki Nishimura — a producer on numerous Studio Ghibli films, as well as Ponoc films Mary and The Witch's Flower and Modest Heroes — is producing the film.\n\nA Great Big World (\"Say Something\") featuring Rachel Platten (\"Fight Song\") are performing the theme song \"Nothing's Impossible.\"\n\n-Bloomsbury Publishing released A.F. Harrold's original The Imaginary novel in 2001 with illustrations by Emily Gravett. The publisher describes the novel:\n\nRudger is Amanda Shuffleup's imaginary friend. Nobody else can see Rudger--until the evil Mr. Bunting arrives at Amanda's door. Mr. Bunting hunts imaginaries. Rumor has it that he even eats them. And now he's found Rudger.\n\nSoon Rudger is alone, and running for his imaginary life. He needs to find Amanda before Mr. Bunting catches him--and before Amanda forgets him and he fades away to nothing. But how can an unreal boy stand alone in the real world?"
