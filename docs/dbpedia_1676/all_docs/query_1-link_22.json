I think that that is so perfect and amazing as it is.\n\n\"We just wanted to, you know, do a couple of shout-outs, have some throwbacks [and] pay respect to that movie and to Patrick Swayze first and foremost, because he's a legend.\"\n\nSpeaking further about the late actor, he added: \"You know, we wanted to do him proud. And, obviously, if he was still around today, we would want to make him happy if he saw this movie.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nGage added that they tried to keep the film \"current\" and \"different\" and pointed to the inclusion of musician Post Malone and MMA fighter Conor McGregor in the ensemble cast.\n\nRead more:\n\nRoad House review: Jake Gyllenhaal is a class act in slick remake\n\nDrive-Away Dolls stars: \"It was a safe place to get horny!\"\n\n\"Musicians and actors and fighters mixed together, it's just a completely different… I would like to say it's a reimagining and not a reboot,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Daniela Melchior – who plays Ellie, the love interest of Gyllenhaal's character – also pointed out how the film differed from the previous version, praising director Doug Liman for putting his own stamp on the material.\n\n\"It's Doug's take and he's very unique as a director, so of course the story is totally different just because of that,\" she said.\n\n\"And then the biggest difference I would say is the diverse cast, the different ages as well of the cast, and then the music. I think everything is different in this one - this is, like, its own thing, for real.\"\n\nRoad House is now available to watch on Prime Video – try Prime Video for free for 30 days.\n\nCheck out more of our Film coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on."
