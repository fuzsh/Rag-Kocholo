        "text": "Story Behind the Song: 'She's Like the Wind'\n\n\"Dirty Dancing\" is one of the most successful movie soundtracks of all time â€” and Patrick Swayze's \"She's Like the Wind\" almost wasn't part of it. The late movie star originally wrote the tune with his friend Stacy Widelitz for another movie he was starring in: 1984's \"Grandview, U.S.A.\" Luckily for them, it didn't make the cut.\n\nIn an interview with Bart Herbison of Nashville Songwriters Association International, Widelitz recalled \"Wind's\" journey to \"Dirty Dancing,\" and the cultural phenomenon that followed.\n\nTake us back to 1984 and tell this story.\n\n(Swayze and I) became friends in his acting class and discovered that we lived right around the block from each other. So we became fast friends and started hanging out together. He was a very musical guy, and we had talks about music. He was doing a movie called \"Grandview, U.S.A.\" with Jamie Lee Curtis and C. Thomas Howell. He called me up because he knew I was writing music for TV at the time. He said, \"I have this idea for a song. I've been kicking it around for a while, and I can't get anywhere with it, and they're looking for songs for 'Grandview.' Do you want to work on it with me?\" I said, \"Yeah, sure. Come on over.\"\n\nSo he came over with his guitar, and I was at the piano at my apartment. He started playing the same chords over and over: C to E-minor, C to E-minor, and he had these opening lines that I liked, which were: \"She's like the wind through my tree/ She rides the night next to me.\" I found (that) intriguing. Then the third and fourth lines I didn't like. He said, \"Well, what do you hear?\" And I just blurted out, \"She leads me through moonlight / only to burn me with the sun.\" He said, \"What does that mean?\" I said, \"I don't care. Let's just write it down and move on from here.\"\n\nI said, \"It's got to go somewhere musically,\" so we worked out some different chord changes, and over the course of two or three days we hashed out the song ... anyway, ultimately it was not used in \"Grandview, U.S.A.\"\n\nAren't you glad? ... There are three movies, \"Urban Cowboy,\" \"Saturday Night Fever\" or \"Dirty Dancing,\" that you want to get a song in.\n\nRight, or \"Flashdance.\" Yeah, it's true. It was unexpected.\n\nHad you forgotten about it?\n\nPretty much. It was off my radar. We knew that it was there, but it was two years later that I had met, through Patrick, the writer of this script called \"Dirty Dancing,\" and I met the choreographer. We were all talking about music, and they said, \"Well, we're looking for songs.\" We were trying to write something especially for it and didn't really come up with anything. And then Patrick called me from North Carolina, where they were shooting the film in '86, and said \"I played the demo of 'She's Like the Wind' for the producers of 'Dirty Dancing,' and they really like it, and they want to use it.'\n\n... The word on the street was this was a very low-budget movie that was going to go straight to video after one week in the theater. They also had very little money to pay for (the song's usage), so my music agent made the deal for Patrick and I, and as a result, we retained 100 percent of the publishing. We've always owned the copyright, which has turned out to be a blessing.\n\nWe recorded the final version of the song with Michael Lloyd producing it, and he was the only one. I remember the morning of the recording session ... he walked up to me and said, \"Do you know what we're doing today?\" And I said, \"Yeah, we're recording 'She's Like the Wind.' \" He said, \"No! We are recording a major hit song.\" I said, \"Call my mother and let her know because she won't believe it, either.\"\n\nAfter it was recorded, the movie was shot, and it still didn't come out for almost another year. Then it was really off my radar ... then the movie came out and it debuted at No. 4 at the box office, but the next week, it started going up. And they released \"Time of My Life,\" the first single from the soundtrack, and that shot to No. 1 in a matter of weeks. All of a sudden, the ground was starting to shift under all of us. I remember Michael Lloyd called me and said, \"Hey, you're getting a gold record.\" ... A couple of weeks later, I called him and said, \"Do you know when I get the gold record?\" He said, \"You're not getting a gold record. Now you're getting a platinum one.\" It just took off, and he even said, \"We're riding a phenomenon.\"\n\nAbout the series"
