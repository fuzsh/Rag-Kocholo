        "text": "0\n\nShare this\n\nFirst, I want to admit I’ve never seen the original 1989 Road House film with Patrick Swayze. Just never got around to it but I don’t know why. That said, this is a review of the new Prime Video remake, Road House starring Jake Gyllenhaal, despite not having watched the original.\n\nRoad House follows Dalton (Gyllenhaal), an ex-UFC fighter who has been asked to be a bouncer at a Florida Keys bar called ‘The Road House’. Little does Dalton know, he’s stepped into the middle of a feud over the bar between the owner, Frankie (Jessica Williams), and a wealthy man who wants the bar for land development.\n\nI like the simplicity of the screenplay, and the story gives us plenty of info without out shoving too much exposition down our throats. I believe Dalton as both mild mannered and just as stone cold.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is on point with his acting, as always. He brings a softness and good hearted nature to Dalton that a lot of actors couldn’t bring. He is probably the funniest person in the film, not to mention doing his own fighting stunts and scenes, as well as getting as ripped as Hugh Jackman in later X-Men movies.\n\nKnox (Conor McGregor) is like a rabid dog on steroids. He’s easy to hate and helps build up Dalton’s yin to Knox’s yang. He is a bit much but that also works for this movie because everything, including the camera work, is a little over the top.\n\nThe action and camera work in this movie is quite unique. The techniques they used were fresh and made the fights feel very real. In fact, in some cases we are right in the action. The sound design helps a lot here as well. The impacts and flat fist to face packing sounds were well done. Go Foley Crew!\n\nI like the cast of Roadhouse beyond the leads. Daniela Melchior is always great. She holds her own with Jake Gyllenhaal on screen. Her character also holds her own by fighting back. Billy Magnussen plays the “douchebag” rich boy perfectly and his acting makes it easy to hate him. Acting veteran, Joaquim de Almeida plays the sheriff, and as an actor he always seems sinister, but that works well in films like this.\n\nOf the supporting cast, Arturo Castro (who you may know from ‘the Menu’) steals the show as Moe. I love Moe and his character type. You just like him right away even though he’s not on our side.\n\nDoug Liman delivers another great action flick. You may know Liman for his work on films like Go, The Bourne Identity, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Edge of Tomorrow. Liman’s blend of over the top action and comedy usually hits. Road House is no exception.\n\nI would also argue that having the legendary producer Joel Silver on this film didn’t hurt, especially having produced the original Road House film. Silver is also known for classics such as The Warriors, 48 Hours, the Lethal Weapons film series, and even The Matrix franchise. Silver’s credits as a producer are extensive and many of them smash successes.\n\nOverall, Road House is Over-the-top, funny, ridiculous with bits with heart.\n\nOh and yes I will watch the original as I’d like to have something to compare this version to now."
