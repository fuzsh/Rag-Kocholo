        "text": "John Leguizamo says he still remembers how hard it was to work with Patrick Swayze.\n\nThe duo co-starred alongside Wesley Snipes in “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! July Newmar” (1995), a comedy about three drag queens on a road trip. When asked if the late great Swayze was the “angel” he’s remembered as, however, Leguizamo kept it real.\n\n“It was difficult working with him,” he recalled Thursday on Sirius XM’s “Radio Andy.”\n\n“[He was,] I don’t know, just neurotic, maybe a tiny bit insecure,” Leguizamo added, when host Andy Cohen asked for details. “And then Wesley and I, we vibed because, you know, we’re people of color and we got each other.”\n\nLeguizamo was already an established comedian when he was cast in the part, which he said Thursday he “rewrote” because “that role was nothing.” While that creativity landed him his first Golden Globe nomination, Leguizamo said it made Swayze “mad and upset” on set.\n\n“I’m also an improviser, and [Swayze] didn’t like that,” Leguizamo said. “He couldn’t keep up with it. He’d be like, ‘Are you gonna say a line like that?’ I’d go, ‘You know me. I’m gonna do me. I’m gonna just keep making up lines,’” Leguizamo recalled. “He goes, ‘Well, can you just say the line the way it is?’ I go, ‘I can’t,’ and the director didn’t want me to.”\n\nSwayze revealed in his 2009 memoir, “The Time of My Life,” that this bickering began as early as rehearsals for the film. He recalled Leguizamo’s “hyperactive” horseplay driving him so “crazy” that he screamed at his energetic co-star to “shut the fuck up for once.”\n\nSounds like a clash if acting styles...and on hearing the facts, some of us would side with Patrick as he never pretended to be Robin Williams and let loose. If, in a movie, about backstage Hollywood, the way to show us, the audience, thar the actor is annoying, would be to have him constantly offer ideas that he believed were better than the script or better than directed. If you look at Joey in Friends, in one episode he tells a journalist that he basicly rewrites his scripts his character then falls down an elevator shaft. In another episode, he's on a stretcher dying, but each take he tries it differently eventually he's made play it as already dead...cutting his screen time.\n\nI did a movie with John very early in his career. One scene, maybe a dozen lines. Scheduled as a one day shoot. Three set ups (master, reverse and coverage). My call was for 4:00, as I remember. Wardrobe and makeup, on set at 5:00 to start. Improviser doesn't begin to cover it. The master, which should have taken 90 minutes tops , to shoot, took us from 5:30 to somewhere around 11:00. This is basically as a result of the fact that John never did the scene twice in the same way. He would add a line here, do a bit there...all of it funny, but the DP obviously saw trouble ahead. When we were lighting the reverses set up, they took John off by himself and made him watch the master....or masters( who could tell) in the hopes that he would \"match\" the master in reverses and coverage. \"Cut..no John, remember, you did...XXX in the master. Everybody back to one.\" Same when we went to shoot coverage. Not only did I get two days pay out of it (at midnight, as I remember, we rolled in to day two) but overtime on the eight hours on day one. That one scene provided the down payment on mycondo. Needless to say, I am a BIG John Leguizamo fan."
