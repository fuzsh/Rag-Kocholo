        "text": "Mercer County is a great filming location with its stunning scenery and historical sites!\n\nFrom dramas to indie horror films, you can see a variety of sites throughout Mercer County that have been featured in films, such as:\n\nTiger Warsaw\n\nThis 1988 film, directed by Amin Q. Chaudhri and starring Patrick Swayze, features the charming town of Sharon, PA. Swayze’s character Chuck “Tiger” Warsaw shot his father, turning him into a semi-invalid.\n\nFifteen years after the incident, he returns home to seek forgiveness from his family. Some of the featured sites in the movie include King’s Music, Buhl Farm Park Casino, and the former George Boyd mansion.\n\nAn Unremarkable Life\n\nDirected by Amin Q. Chaudhri, An Unremarkable Life was filmed mainly in Mercer and Sharon, starring Patricia Neal, Shelley Winters, and Mako.\n\nThis 1989 drama is about two sisters who have put aside their differences to set up a comfortable life together. When one sister falls in love with an East Asian mechanic, her intolerant sister becomes enraged, threatening to destroy their relationship.\n\nThe diner and adjacent gas station featured in the movie were refurbished for the film. The diner used for the set was sold a few years after filming to a buyer in Germany, dismantled, and shipped over. The gas station featured in the film has been torn down.\n\nBlood Woods\n\nReleased in 2017, Blood Woods is an indie horror film about a group of criminals who stumble upon a lodge after a bank heist.\n\nWhile they hold the owners of the lodge hostage and plan their next move, they encounter a vampire lurking in the Mercer County woods.\n\nVisit Mercer County Today!\n\nIf you’re ready to see the sites where movie magic has happened in Mercer County, plan your visit today. From great restaurants and outdoor adventure opportunities, Mercer County is a fun-filled place for a weekend trip!\n\n[addtoany]"
