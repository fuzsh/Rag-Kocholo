        "text": "The cult classic 1989 movie \"Road House\" is getting a sunny remake.\n\nThis time, Dalton is heading down to clean up the Keys.\n\nThe first version, long considered a \"so bad it's good\" classic, starred Patrick Swayze as Dalton, a professional and incorruptible \"cooler\" who gets hired to clean up a rowdy and violent honkytonk bar in a small Missouri town.\n\nIn the Amazon Studios remake directed by Doug Liman (\"The Bourne Identity,\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\") and starring Jake Gyllenhaal (\"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Donnie Darko,\" \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\"), the new Dalton is a former UFC middleweight fighter who gets hired to clean up a roadhouse in the Florida Keys but (big shocker) finds out that \"this paradise is not at all what it seems.\"\n\nWait, what? There's a 'Road House' remake?\n\nYep. There's been a remake in the works since 2013. UFC fighter Ronda Rousey was cast as the gender-flipped lead in 2015 with Nick Cassavetes (\"The Notebook\") writing and directing but the movie was put on hold for six years and then brought back with Liman directing, a script by Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry, and Gyllenhaal as the star.\n\nThe new \"Road House\" was produced by Joel Silver, the same guy who produced the first one. The trailer dropped this week.\n\n\"'Road House' is a homerun for us,\" said Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke. \"Not only is it a nod to fans of the original but it is also a big, fun, broad audience movie.\"\n\nWhat's different in the new 'Road House' remake?\n\nFor one thing, someone says Dalton's first name now: Elwood. (Swayze's Dalton remained simply Dalton throughout, although a closeup look at his medical records revealed him to be a James.) He's a UFC fighter who's had a few too many hits and is now fighting in underground clubs when a Florida bar owner (Jessica Williams) finds him living out of his car.\n\n\"A friend of mine suggested I come talk to you,\" she tells him in the trailer. \"I own a roadhouse out in the Florida Keys. Lately, it’s been attracting the wrong clientele. I can pay you good money. Judging by your car, you need that s--t.”\n\nNo rustic apartment in the country over the cows for this Dalton, he lives on a boat. But he still shows bouncers and barbacks how to watch for danger and put it down with style.\n\n'Road House' revisited: How Jake Gyllenhaal remake compares to Patrick Swayze cult classic\n\nInstead of an evil rich guy running the town (RIP Ben Gazzara), here it's an evil developer who wants the land under the roadhouse to build a resort, and he throws increasingly aggressive people at the bar (and Dalton) to run them out of town. No sign of Sam Elliott, sadly. And this time the hyperaggressive bar floor foe is Knox, played by a grinning UFC superstar Conor McGregor in his first acting role.\n\nViolence, you may be surprised to hear, ensues.\n\nExpect lots of callouts to the original (\"No one ever wins a fight\") but substantially more boats, Hawaiian shirts and maritime explosions.\n\nWho stars in the 'Road House' remake?\n\nGyllenhaal is Dalton, of course, bringing to the numerous brutal fight scenes his calm, charming and almost apologetic demeanor that moviemakers are probably hoping will soothe the outrage of devoted fans of the first movie.\n\nDaniela Melchior (\"Fast X\") replaces Kelly Lynch's role in the Swayze version as Dalton's medical love interest, now named Ellie. The bad guy is Brandt, played by Billy Magnussen (\"Game Night\"). Jessica Williams (\"Shrinking,\" \"The Daily Show\") is the bar owner and Conor McGregor is Knox.\n\nOther actors include Joaquim de Almeida, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Lukas Gage, Hannah Love Lanier, Travis Van Winkle, B.K. Cannon, Arturo Castro, Dominique Columbus, Beau Knapp, Darren Barnet, Kevin Carroll, J. D. Pardo and Bob Menery.\n\nWhere is Glass Key, Florida? Jake Gyllenhaal’s Dalton cleans up fictional key in ‘Road House’ remake\n\nWas the 'Road House' remake filmed in Florida?\n\nBarely. While the story is set on the fictional Glass Key, most of it was shot in the Dominican Republic, according to Florida Keys Film Commissioner Chad Newman.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the movie is filmed in the D.R.,\" Newman told keysnews.com.\n\nFilming in Florida has dwindled since state lawmakers ended the tax incentives for film production in 2016, although Brad Pitt has been spotted filming a Formula 1 racing movie in Daytona Beach.\n\nBut one scene featuring a local celebrity was filmed there: at the beginning of the movie when Dalton arrives in the Keys, he'll pass beloved local landmark Fred the Tree on the Old Seven-Mile Bridge.\n\n\"Don't fret my friends,\" \"Fred\" posted on his Facebook page in 2022. \"I will be decorated this year for the holidays - the elves’ plans are bigger and better than ever! Buttttttt, it will be a little later in December than normal because I heard Jake Gyllenhaal wants me in his new movie and I gotta be naked.\" Hashtags included #moviestarlife and #themostfamoustree.\n\nWhen and where can I watch the 'Road House' remake?\n\n\"Road House\" will debut on Amazon Prime on March 21, 2024, 35 years after the original movie debuted.\n\nThe movie will premiere at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas in March, but Doug Liman announced he will not be attending in protest of the movie not getting a theatrical release.\n\nEditor's note: Dalton's first name in the original movie has been added."
