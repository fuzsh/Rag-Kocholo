        "text": "He’s having the time of his life.\n\nIn the new TV adaptation of “Dirty Dancing,” premiering Wednesday at 8 p.m. on ABC, actor Colt Prattes dons the tight, black tank top of Johnny Castle, the role made famous by Patrick Swayze in the classic 1987 film.\n\nIt’s a major moment for the first-time movie actor.\n\n“You get aunts and uncles and cousins that you haven’t seen since you were 6 saying, ‘I always knew [you’d be famous]!’ ” Prattes told The Post. “Everybody I know has made jokes, like, ‘Get ready for your social media to skyrocket.’ ”\n\nHowever, despite his rippling abs, “[My Instagram] is usually just pictures of me, my dog and my wife.”\n\nThe pressure that comes with playing the late Swayze’s part — the heartthrob of an entire generation — isn’t lost on Prattes.\n\n“I used to watch ‘Dirty Dancing’ with my stepmom every weekend. And I just remember watching her smile so much,” he recalled. “Now that I’m an adult, I realize she had a crush on him.”\n\nPrattes’ life up until now has been filled with more hardscrabble hoofing than leading-man glamour. On Broadway, he performed in the chorus of “How To Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” starring Daniel Radcliffe, and the most recent revival of “West Side Story.” He also high-kicked around the country in “A Chorus Line.”\n\nBefore “Dirty Dancing,” his most high-profile achievement was as a dancer in Pink’s 2012 music video “Try.”\n\nBut Prattes was no dance prodigy.\n\n“I was a late bloomer,” he said. “One of my teachers very early on told me, ‘You’re never gonna catch up to the real dancers, so you’d better learn how to do tricks.” But Prattes was defiant, declaring: “ ‘No, I am gonna catch up!’ ”\n\nAs a teen in Marietta, Ga., he decided to attend a performing arts high school 90 minutes away from home after watching his friend Billy Tighe — who has since performed in “Pippin” on Broadway and “Finding Neverland” on tour — act in a production of “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” at the school.\n\n“I had never seen that kind of happiness,” he remembered. “And it was something I wanted to be a part of.”\n\nPlus, he added, “Somebody told me you can meet girls.”\n\nIt worked. Today he is married to an actress, Angelina Mullins, who’s currently on tour with “Aladdin” in Chicago. The two live in LA.\n\nWhile filming “Dirty Dancing,” Prattes formed a lasting friendship with co-star Abigail Breslin, who plays Baby, the role originated by Jennifer Grey.\n\n“Abby’s my girl!” Prattes said. “We talk every day now. She’s become a very close friend.”\n\nThe duo quickly discovered that their characters — Johnny, a professional dancer, and Baby, a naive novice — paralleled their real lives.\n\n“Abby had never danced before, and she openly said in an interview about how nervous she was about whoever her Johnny was gonna be. Because if you haven’t danced, you haven’t been lifted,” Prattes said, alluding to the famous scene where Baby runs to Johnny and he hoists her over his head.\n\n“And if you haven’t been lifted, when your eyeline goes from 4 or 5 feet off the ground to 10 feet off the ground, it’s terrifying.”\n\nPhoto: John Chapple; Grooming: Stephanie Navarro using Skinn Cosmetics; Stylist: Cody Jones; Location: APEX Photo Studios."
