        "text": "If you grew up in the 80’s, you were most likely a big fan of Patrick Swayze. Girls drooled over him, guys wanted to be him. He was the man!\n\nHis life was cut short due to pancreatic cancer at the age of 57 but his legacy lives on. The guy could do it all! He could act, sing, dance, and yeah… He was darn good looking. So good looking that he won People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive in 1991. He started his acting career very early and learned to dance at a very young age. His mother Patsy Swayze was a dance choreographer so that explains the moves you saw in Dirty Dancing.\n\nHe gained Hollywood notoriety in the film “The Outsiders” which featured a bunch of young Hollywood actors at the time. They all became very famous including Patrick Swayze. Tom Cruise, Rob Lowe, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, and Diane Lane. This movie helped spark The Brat Pack of the 1980’s.\n\nHis Hollywood breakthrough role came when he starred as Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing. If you are above the age of 35, you have seen this movie and most likely have tried to do the iconic dance lift that Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey did at the end of the movie. This movie is iconic! He put on a heck of a performance not only showing his lead acting chops but also his dance moves. This was one of the biggest movies of the 80’s and still remains a classic to this day.\n\nAfter Dirty Dancing, you have Road House which is the best bad movie of all time. This role is the exact opposite of his Dirty Dancing role. He shows his super tough side as a bouncer of a rowdy bar.\n\nI don’t want to keep giving away his roles because the 3 I mentioned already definitely made the list… Let’s take a look at the list before I spoil the whole thing."
