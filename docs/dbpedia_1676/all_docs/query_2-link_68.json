        "text": "The live-action Until Dawn movie is bringing back actor Peter Stormare (Fargo, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4) to reprise his role as Dr. Hill.\n\nHis return to the Until Dawn universe, as well as more cast additions, was revealed by a report from The Hollywood Reporter. Dr. Hill is a psychiatrist and appears throughout the original game during segments that see players making decisions that influence the overall experience. It’s unclear if Stormare’s part will see him periodically showing up to analyze the story’s characters as he did before as plot details are still under wraps.\n\nStormare will be joined by newcomers Maia Mitchell (The Fosters, Teen Beach 2) and Belmont Cameli (Saved by the Bell, Based on a True Story), whose roles are being kept secret for now. All three actors add to a cast that already includes Ella Rubin, Michael Cimino, Ji-Young Yoo, and Odessa A’Zion.\n\nThe Until Dawn movie was announced earlier this year and aims to bring Supermassive Games and PlayStation’s choose-your-own-adventure horror experience to the big screen. Though it’s unclear how it will tackle the more interactive elements players know the franchise for, Dr. Hill’s presence suggests there will at least be some ties to the 2015 video game. The original story follows a group of friends who take a snowy vacation out into the middle of the woods but find their fates intertwined with a masked terror and other supernatural beings. Its original cast includes Hayden Panettiere, Rami Malek, Brett Dalton, Jordan Fisher, Meaghan Martin, and more.\n\nThe Until Dawn movie has big shoes to fill, but is quickly assembling a team ahead of plans to start shooting later this month. It’ll be directed by Shazam! Fury of the Gods and Lights Out leader David F. Sandberg, with Annabelle: Creation scribe Gary Dauberman writing the script. Dauberman is also producing alongside Mia Maniscalco via Coin Operated, with Sandberg and Lotta Losten also attached to produce. Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan will produce for PlayStation Productions, along with Vertigo Entertainment’s Roy Lee.\n\nUpcoming New Video Game Movies and TV Shows: 2024 Release Dates and Beyond"
