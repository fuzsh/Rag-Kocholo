While in school, Swayze pursued his love for ballet but soon set it aside when Swayze got into high school to pursue athletics like swimming, football, and gymnastics. He also delved into martial arts and practiced skills like Wushu, Aikido, and Taekwondo. After graduation, he was offered some dance and athletic scholarships. He chose to study gymnastics at San Jacinto College. After two years, he toured as Snow White’s Prince Charming with the Disney on Ice Parade show. He relocated to New York City to perfect his dance skills at Harkness Ballet and Joffrey Ballet Schools and was given a job as a principal dancer for Eliot Feld Ballet Company. Soon after, his knee injury from high school affected his career, and he had to quit.\n\nSwayze began his acting career in 1976 by making his Broadway debut in “Goodtime Charley.” In 1979 he made his first on-screen debut as Ace in an American comedy musical film, “Skatetown U.S.A.” In 1981 he made acted in “Return of the Rebel” and “Blood Brothers” whereas, in 1983, he played the role of a gang leader called “Bandit” in the American action crime drama “The Renegades.” Swayze’s celebrity status became well established in 1983 when he acted in the coming-of-age drama film “The Outsiders.” He became Hollywood’s heartthrob in 1987 when he acted in the romantic drama “Dirty Dancing.” He acted in the highest-grossing film of 1990, “Ghost,” where he starred as Sam Wheat. Swayze’s role in the movie earned him a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nSwayze was named “The Sexiest Man Alive” by “People Magazine” in 1991. In 1997, he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2003, he co-produced and starred in the dance film “One Last Dance” along with his wife, Lisa Niemi.\n\nSwayze lived an extraordinary life as he won awards during his career and was a two-time Golden Globe Nominee. He was married to actress Lisa Niemi, but they had no children. He claimed Niemi inspired his 1987 song, “She’s Like the Wind.” Sadly, in January 2009, he was admitted to hospital due to complications with Pneumonia and was also diagnosed with cancer. In April of that same year, the doctors informed him his cancer had spread to his liver. At 57, he died with his family by his side on September 14, 2009. Swayze was cremated, and his ashes were distributed over his New Mexico Ranch."
