        "text": "I just saw the sweetest video of Patrick Swayze dancing with his wife at the 1994 World Music Awards to Whitney Houston’s All the Man that I Need. It was the first time the couple danced together on international television. It’s a moving performance. You can feel the love between them. It reminded me of Patrick Swayze’s extraordinary talent and charm. And it reminded me of how much I loved his movies. So I thought I’d share my 5 favorite Swayze films.\n\nDirty Dancing. Patrick Swayze will always be Johnny Castle to me – strong, handsome and a fantastic dancer. I remember seeing it at the Colony movie theater on 82nd Street in Jackson Heights. I must have been in the 7th or 8th grade and I went with my friends. (My mom took us and I made her sit behind us.) I know everyone quotes “No one puts Baby in a corner” but my favorite Johnny line is: Look, spaghetti arms. This is my dance space. This is your dance space. I don’t go into yours, you don’t go into mine. You gotta hold the frame.\n\nTo Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar. This is actually my favorite Swayze film. He’s brave, beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and feminine. Vida is EVERYTHING. I didn’t see this in the movies, my mom actually suggested I watch it and she loaned me tape. Remember that? When movies were on tape?\n\nGhost. The ultimate love story: Sam and Molly. I know it’s cheesy and completely over the top. But it’s romantic. And it makes me cry. I tell Joseph that if something like this ever happens to me, he better avenge me Sam style. AND – Carl (Tony Goldwyn) is Fitz from Scandal.\n\nThe Outsiders. I remember watching The Outsiders as a tween and being all about Ralph Macchio and Rob Lowe – obviously. But looking back, I admire Darry’s character. Patrick Swayze is perfect for the role actually.\n\nPoint Break. This is a cult classic. I mean, the movie is kind of ridiculous. How can anyone possibly take this movie seriously. I think that’s what I love about it. And I love Swayze in it. My favorite Bodhi line is when he gets all sentimental about Tyler (played by Lori Petty – P.S. I think she is so annoying) and he’s like “She was my woman…we spent time.” I burst out laughing every single time.\n\nWhat’s your favorite Patrick Swayze movie/role?\n\nAnd this was the video that made me all nostalgic for Patrick Swayze.\n\nRelated"
