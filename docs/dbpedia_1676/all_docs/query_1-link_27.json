        "text": "This 1983 movie was based on the award winning book, The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton. This movie made or boosted careers of the cast including from left to right Emilio Esteves, Rob Lowe, C. Thomas Howell, Matt Dillon, Ralph Macchio, Patrick Swayze and Tom Cruise (not pictured Diane Lane.)\n\nThe 1985 and 1986 miniseries, based on Novels by John Jakes, had an all-star cast. It was well received and highly rated both years. Starring alongside Swayze was James Read (Charmed and Days of our Lives) and Kirstie Alley (Charmed and Veronica's Closet.) There was however a third miniseries in the trilogy, it did not include Swayze and was unsuccessful.\n\nThe 1987 iconic movie, Dirty Dancing is the movie that everyone most associates with Patrick Swayze. Along with Jennifer Grey, (Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Amazon Original Red Oaks) Swayze danced his way into the hearts of America and many other countries as well. 29 years later it continues to be a success with multiple generations and it has been made into a TV show, given a sequel (of sorts,) made into a musical and a remake is in the works. Also starring, Jerry Orbach (Law and Order and Beauty and the Beast) and Cynthia Rhodes (Flashdance and Staying Alive)\n\nAlthough he wasn't known for his singing he did manage to make it to the music charts. His song was included in the Platinum soundtrack record and it remains as one of the most successful albums of all time.\n\nIn 1989, Road House appealed to a male and female audiences. It taught the audience to be nice until it was time to not be nice. It also had a famous scene that sent the ladies to pause their VCR's. Although it may not be his best acting but it is still televised today.\n\nIn 1989, Swayze starred in Next of Kin with Liam Neeson (Taken,) Adam Baldwin (Firefly and Chuck,) Helen Hunt (Mad about You and Twister,) and Bill Paxton (Aliens and Apollo 13) It wasn't as well received as others but is a must see for true Swayze fans.\n\nThis duet with Larry Gatlin may have cheesy lyrics but it does have some beautiful harmonies. Patrick had to have been thinking of his own brothers, Don Swayze (True Blood and The Bridge) and Sean Swayze.\n\nThe 1990 SNL hosting gig and this skit with Chris Farley, who died in 1997, was very popular. It still ranks in the top ten SNL skits in the series 40 plus years.\n\nIn 1991, Keanu Reeves (Matrix and John Wick,) Gary Busey (The Buddy Holly Story and Sharknado 4) Lori Petty (A League of Their Own and Orange is the New Black) star in the 1991 Blockbuster with Swayze.\n\nFor those who haven't seen it you may not have even heard it before. The 1995 comedy was way different than anything Patrick Swayze had done before. Wesley Snipes (Blade Trilogy), John Leguizamo (Ice Age movies and Moulin Rouge!,) and Stockard Channing (Grease and Six Degree's of Separation) also star in this amusing and touching tale.\n\nThis 2009 series is arguably the best acting performance of his life. It also launched the career of Travis Fimmel (Vikings and World of Warcraft.) Also in the show is Lindsay Pulsipher (True Blood and The Oregonian) and Lawrence Gillard Jr. (The Wire and The Walking Dead.)"
