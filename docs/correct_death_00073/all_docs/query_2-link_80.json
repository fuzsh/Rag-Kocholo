        "text": "Full Name: George de Valero\n\nProfession: Revolutionary and President of Ireland\n\nBiography: Éamon de Valera is one of the most significant figures in modern Irish history His long career as a revolutionary then statesman dominated Irish politics throughout Ireland's struggle for independence.\n\nDe Valera was the only leader from the 1916 Easter Rising not to be executed by the British, partly due to his joint American, Irish citizenship. After being imprisoned, he was released in 1917 and elected president of Irish political party Sinn Féin. The party went on to win the majority of Irish seats in the 1918 UK general elections.\n\nInitially de Valera rejected the treaty signed to end the Anglo-Irish War and create an Irish Free State, because of its allegiance to Britain component. He established a new political party Fianna Fáil and joined the Dáil Éireann, (Irish parliament) in 1927 and began working to sever further ties with the UK.\n\nIn 1937 de Valera helped introduce a new Irish constitution with himself as Taoiseach (Prime Minister). In 1939 he declared Ireland neutral in WWII. De Valera served two further terms as Taoiseach (1951-54, 1957-59) and was Ireland's third president in 1959, holding office until he retired in 1973.\n\nBorn: October 14, 1882\n\nBirthplace: New York City, New York, USA\n\nStar Sign: Libra"
