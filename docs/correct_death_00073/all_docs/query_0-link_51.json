Dr. Prasad is considered to be one of the architects of the Indian Republic, having drafted its first constitution and serving as the first president of free India.\n\n4. During the independence movement, he left his law work and joined the Congress Party, playing a prominent role in the Indian Independence Movement. He served as the president of the Constituent Assembly that drafted the first constitution of the Republic, which lasted from 1948 to 1950. He also briefly served as a cabinet minister in the first Government of the Indian Republic.[1] Early life Dr. Rajendra Prasad, son of Mahadev Sahai, was born in Zeradei village, in the Siwan district of Bihar, on 3 December 1884. He was the youngest in a large family, & was close to his mother and eldest brother. He was known as \"Rajen\" to his family and friends. His father, Mahadev Sahay, was a scholar of both the Persian and Sanskrit languages, while his mother, Kamleshwari Devi, was a religious woman. Zeradei's population was diverse, with both Muslims and Hindus living in relative harmony. [edit] Student Life When Rajendra Prasad was five years old, his parents put him under a Mawlawi, an accomplished Muslim scholar, to learn the Persian language, followed by Hindi and arithmetic. After the completion of traditional elementary education, Rajendra Prasad was sent to the Chhapra District School. At the age of 12, Rajendra Prasad was married to Rajavanshi Devi. He, along with his elder brother Mahendra Prasad, then went on to study at T.K. Ghosh's Academy in Patna. Since childhood, Rajendra Prasad was a brilliant student. He placed first in the entrance examination to the University of Calcutta and was awarded Rs.30 per month as a scholarship. In 1902, Rajendra Prasad joined the Presidency College. He was initially a student of science and his teachers included Jagadish Chandra Bose and Prafulla Chandra Roy. Later he decided to focus on the arts. Prasad lived with his brother in the Eden Hindu Hostel. A plaque still commemorates his stay in that room. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was instrumental in the formation of the Bihari Students' Conference in 1908. It was the first organization of its kind in the whole of India, which would later produce many of the premier figures of Bihar like Bihar Vibhuti Dr Anugrah Narayan Sinha & Bihar Kesari Sri Krishna Singh. In 1915, Rajendra Prasad graduated with a Masters in Law, passing his examination with honors. He then went on to complete his Doctorate in Law. Career [edit] As a teacher Rajendra Prasad served in various educational institutions as a teacher. After completing his MA in economics, Dr. Prasad joined as a professor at the Bhumihar Brahman College in Muzaffarpur, on July 1908 and later went on to become the principal. However later on he left the college for his legal studies. In Kolkata too he worked as Professor of Economics. [edit] As a lawyer Rajendra Prasad practiced law and pursued studies at Bhagalpur in Bihar and eventually emerged as a popular and eminent figure of the region. In 1916, Rajendra Prasad joined the High Court of Bihar and Orissa. Such was\n\n5. his intellect and his integrity, that often when his adversary failed to cite a precedent, the judges would ask Rajendra Prasad to provide a precedent. [edit] During the Independence Movement Jawaharlal Nehru, Bhulabhai Desai and Babu Rajendra Prasad (Center) at the AICC Session, April 1939 Dr. Prasad was drawn into the Indian independence movement soon after starting his career as a lawyer. During one of the fact-finding missions at Champaran, Mahatma Gandhi asked him to come with his volunteers. Rajendra Prasad was so greatly moved by the dedication, courage, and conviction of Mahatma Gandhi that he quit his duties in the university to aid the movement. He also responded to the call by Gandhi to boycott Western educational establishments by asking his son, Mrityunjaya Prasad, to drop out of his studies and enroll himself in Bihar Vidyapeeth, an institution he along with his colleagues founded on the traditional Indian model[2] . During the course of the independent movement, he formed a friendship with Dr. Rahul Sankrityayan, the great Indian writer, freedom fighter, and polymath. In many of his articles he mentioned about his meeting with Dr. Rahul Sankrityayan and narrated about their close friendship and Rahulji's love toward his nation. He wrote articles for the revolutionary publications Searchlight and the Desh and collected funds for these papers. He toured widely, explaining, lecturing, and exhorting the principles of the independence movement. He took an active role in helping the affected people during the 1914 floods that struck Bihar and Bengal. When the earthquake of Bihar occurred on 15 January 1934, Rajendra Prasad was in jail, During that period, he passed his responsibility to his close colleague and eminent Gandhian Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha.[3] He was released two days later, and set himself for the task of raising funds to help the people. The Viceroy of India had raised his own fund, though Rajendra Prasad's fund collected over 38 Lakhs (Rs. 3,800,000), three times what the Viceroy raised. During the 1935 Quetta earthquake, when he was forbidden to leave the country, he set up relief committees in Sindh and Punjab. He was elected as the President of Indian National Congress during the Bombay session in October 1934. He again became the president when Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose resigned in 1939. After India became an independent republic in 1950, he was elected as the first President of India. Prasad acted independently of politics, following the expected role of the president that the constitution set down. Following the tussle over the enactment of the Hindu Code Bill, he took a more active role in the affairs of the nation. He set several important precedents for later presidents to follow. In 1962, after twelve years as the president, he announced his decision to retire. He was subsequently awarded the Bharat Ratna, the nation's highest civilian award. Rajendra Prasad died on 28 February 1963 [4]\n\n7. Sir Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan BR Kt. OM FBA 2nd President of India In office 13 May 1962 – 13 May 1967 Prime Minister Gulzarilal Nanda (1st term) Lal Bahadur Shastri Gulzarilal Nanda (2nd term) Vice President Zakir Hussain Preceded by Rajendra Prasad Succeeded by Zakir Hussain Born 5 September 1888 Thiruttani, Madras Presidency, British India Died 17 April 1975 (aged 86) Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India Political party Independent Spouse(s) Sivakamu\n\n8. Children Five daughters and a son Occupation Politician, Philosopher, Professor Religion Hinduism Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (Telugu: సర్వేవ్వేపల్లిల్ల్వే ర్వాధాకృష్ణ్వే (OM, FBA 5 September 1888 – 17 April 1975) was an Indian philosopher and statesman. He was the first Vice-President of India (1952–1962) and subsequently the second President of India (1962–1967). One of India's most influential scholars of comparative religion and philosophy, Radhakrishnan is considered through his efforts to have built a bridge between the East and the West by showing that the philosophical systems of each tradition are comprehensible within the terms of the other. He wrote authoritative exegeses of India's religious and philosophical literature for the English speaking world. His academic appointments included the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta (1921-?) and Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University (1936–1952). Among the many honours he received were a knighthood (1931), the Bharat Ratna (1954) and the Order of Merit in 1963. His birthday is celebrated in India as Teacher's Day on 5 September.

His mother tongue was Telugu.[1] His mother's name was Sitamma. His early years were spent in Tirutani and Tirupati. His father was a subordinate revenue official in the service of a local Zamindar (landlord). His primary education was at Primary Board High School at Tirutani. In 1896 he moved to the Hermansburg Evangelical Lutheral Mission School in Tirupati.[2] Dr. Radhakrishnan was awarded scholarships throughout his academic life. He joined the Voorhee's College in Vellore but switched to the Madras Christian College at the age of 17. He graduated with a Master's degree in Philosophy from the Madras Christian College in 1906, being one of its most distinguished alumni.[3] Radhakrishnan wrote his thesis for the M.A. degree on \"The Ethics of the Vedanta and its Metaphysical Presuppositions\".[4] He was afraid that his M.A. thesis, \"The Ethics of the Vedanta\" would offend his philosophy professor, Dr. A.G. Hogg. Instead, Dr. Hogg commended Radhakrishnan on doing an excellent job.[citation needed] Radhakrishnan's M.A. thesis was published when he was only 20. Dr. Radhakrishnan studied philosophy by chance rather than by choice. Being a financially constrained student at the time, when a cousin, after graduating from the same college, passed on his textbooks in philosophy to Radhakrishnan, it automatically decided his academic course.[5][6] Later on he felt deep interest in his subject and wrote many acclaimed works on philosophy, both eastern and western. [edit] Marriage Radhakrishnan was married to Sivakami, a distant cousin, in 1904 at the age of 16. As per tradition the marriage was arranged by the family. The couple had five daughters and a son, Sarvepalli Gopal. Sarvepalli Gopal went on to a notable career as a historian. Sivakami died in 1956. They were married for over 51 years.[7] Career Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan drawn by Bujjai and signed by Radhakrishnan in telugu as \"Radhakrishnaiah\".\n\n10. In 1918 Radhakrishnan was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore. By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He also completed his first book, The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore. He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the \"genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit.\" Dr. Radhakrishnan's second book, The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy was published in 1920. In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta. Radhakrishnan represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the Hibbert lecture on the ideals of life which he delivered at Harris Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as 'An Idealist View of Life'. In 1929 Dr. Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter in Manchester College, Oxford. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by the British Government in 1931, but did not use the title in his personal life, preferring instead his academic title of 'Doctor'. He was the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. In 1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU). [8] He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948. When India became independent in 1947, Dr. Radhakrishnan represented India at UNESCO (1946–52) and was later Ambassador of India to the Soviet Union, from 1949 to 1952. He was also elected to the Constituent Assembly of India. Dr. Radhakrishnan was elected as the first Vice President of India in 1952.[7] He was elected as the second President of India (1962–1967). When he became President, some of his students and friends requested him to allow them to celebrate his birthday, 5 September. He replied, \"Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if 5 September is observed as Teachers' Day.\" His birthday has since been celebrated as Teachers' Day in India.[9] Along with Ghanshyam Das Birla and some other social workers in the pre-independence era, Dr. Radhakrishnan formed the Krishnarpan Charity Trust. [edit] Philosophy Dr. Radhakrishnan stated that Western philosophers, despite all claims to objectivity, were influenced by theological influences of their own culture.[10] He wrote books on Indian philosophy according to Western academic standards, and made all efforts for the West to give serious consideration to Indian philosophy. In his book \"Idealist View of Life\", he made a powerful case for the importance of intuitive thinking as opposed to purely intellectual forms of thought. He is well known for his commentaries on the Prasthana Trayi namely, the Bhagavadgita, the Upanishads and the Brahma Sutra. “ It is not God that is worshipped but the authority that claims to speak in His name. Sin becomes disobedience to authority not violation of integrity. ”\n\n11. [edit] Awards Dr. Radhakrishnan was elected Fellow of the British Academy in 1938. He was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954 and the Order of Merit in 1963. He received the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1961 and the Templeton Prize in 1975, a few months before his death. He donated the entire amount of the Templeton Prize to Oxford University. In 1989, the Oxford University instituted the Radhakrishnan Scholarships in his memory. The scholarships were later renamed the \"Radhakrishnan Chevening Scholarships\".[citation needed] Radhakrishnan was nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature for five consecutive years from 1933–1937, although he did not win. His nominator was Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, father of Dag Hammarskjöld.[11] [edit] Works by Dr. Radhakrishnan • The Hindu View of Life (1926), 92 pages • An Idealist View of Life (1929), 351 pages • Review: E.A.

He was the first elected Muslim president of India. He was awarded the highest Indian national honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1963. Contents [hide] • 1 Early life and background • 2 Career • 3 References • 4 External links [edit] Early life and background Hussain was born in Kaimganj, India. Zakir Hussain was an ethnic Afridi (Pashtun). His family had migrated to Hyderabad from Kaimganj, district Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh. His father died when he was ten years old, and his mother died in 1911 when he was fourteen years old. He attended Islamia High School, Etawah, and was then educated at the Anglo-Muhammadan Oriental College (now Aligarh Muslim University, where he was a prominent student leader).[1][2] [edit] Career Hussain, then only 23, was among the small group of students and teachers who founded a National Muslim University, first founded in Aligarh on Friday 29 October 1920 then shifted to Karol Bagh, New Delhi in 1925, then after shifted again on 1 March 1935 in Jamia Nagar, New Delhi and named it Jamia Millia Islamia (a central university). He subsequently went to Germany to obtain a PhD from the University of Berlin in Economics. While in\n\n16. Germany, Hussain was instrumental in bringing out the anthology of arguably the greatest Urdu poet Mirza Assadullah Khan \"Ghalib\" (1797–1868).[3] He returned to India to head the Jamia Millia Islamia which was facing closure in 1927. He continued in that position for the next twenty-one years providing academic and managerial leadership to an institution that was intimately involved with India's struggle for freedom from the British Rule and experimented with value base education on the lines advocated by Mahatma Gandhi and Hakim Ajmal Khan[4] . During this period he continued to engage himself with movements for educational reforms in India and was particularly active in the affairs of his old alma mater the MAO College, now the Aligarh Muslim University. During this period Hussain emerged as one of the most prominent educational thinkers and practitioners of modern India. His personal sacrifice and untiring efforts to keep the Jamia afloat in very adverse circumstances won him appreciation of even his arch political rivals like Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Soon after India attained independence, Hussain agreed to be the Vice chancellor of the Aligarh Muslim University which was facing trying times in post partition India because of active involvement of a section of its teachers and students in the movement for creation of Pakistan, where incidentally Hussain's relatives brother Dr. Mahmood Hussain and nephew General Rahimuddin Khan would migrate to and achieve eminence. Dr Hussain, again, provided leadership during a critical phase of the history of the University at Aligarh from 1948-1956. Soon after completing his term as Vice Chancellor he was nominated as a member of the Upper House of Indian Parliament in 1956, a position he vacated in 1957 to become Governor of the State of Bihar. After serving as the Governor of Bihar from 1957 to 1962, and as the second Vice President of India from 1962 to 1967, Hussain was elected President of India on 13 May 1967. In his inaugural speech he said that the whole of India was his home and all its people were his family. Hussain died on 3 May 1969, the first Indian President to die in office. He is buried on the campus of the Jamia Millia Islamia (or Central University) in New Delhi.\n\n19.

Reddy was born in Illur village of district Anantapur in the State of Andhra Pradesh. He had his primary education at the High School run by Theosophical Society Adyar, Madras. The spiritual atmosphere of the school left a deep impact on his mind. He joined the Government Arts College at Anantapur for his higher studies. Mahatma Gandhi's visit to Anantapur in July 1929 was the turning point in Reddy's life. He came under the profound influence of Gandhiji's thoughts, words and actions. He discarded his foreign clothes and took to Khadi as his dress. He gave up his studies and joined the Indian Independence Movement. In 1931 he left his studies to join Congress Party. He was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly in 1946 and became the Secretary of the Madras Congress Legislature Party. In 1947, he became a Member of the Indian Constituent Assembly.

He was elected Speaker of Lok Sabha on 17 March 1967, where he won unprecedented acclaim and admiration. In 1969, following the death of Dr. Zakir Hussain, then President of India, Sanjiva Reddy was nominated as the official candidate of Congress party. Even before the election he resigned from his Lok Sabha speakership in order not to take advantage of a position while contesting for another as a party candidate. However Indira Gandhi, knowing that Sanjiva Reddy was too independent a person to toe her line, took the stance of allowing the party electors to vote according to their conscience, rather than asking to vote for the party candidate. This actually implied her support to V.V.Giri and Sanjiva Reddy lost the election. He retired from active politics, returned to his native village Illuru to take up what was always close to his heart, and his fore-fathers occupation of farming. He entered active politics again in 1975 along with Shri Jayaprakash Narayan. In March 1977, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Nandyal constituency in Andhra Pradesh as a Janata Party candidate.

During his tenure,\n\n44. he is believed to have worked with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to promote the personality of Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale at the expense of the Shiromani Akali Dal leadership. [edit] President of India With the retirement of Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as President of India, the members of the Congress Party on 15 July 1982 unanimously nominated Giani Zail Singh to fill the largely ceremonial office. In the general vote, he received almost unanimous support, including even the members of dissident parties such as Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab (India)and the Communists in Bengal. Nonetheless, some in the media felt that the president had been chosen for being an Indira loyalist rather than an eminent person. “If my leader had said I should pick up a broom and be a sweeper, I would have done that. She chose me to be President,”[6] Singh was quoted to have said after his election. Giani Zail Singh took the oath of office on 25 July 1982. President Zail Singh served in a largely ceremonial capacity beside the shrewdly political Prime Minister Gandhi, though protocol dictated that he should be briefed every week by the prime minister on affairs of state. The day before the army was sent into Amritsar to attack the holiest shrine of the Sikhs, the Golden Temple, Mrs. Gandhi and the president met for more than an hour, but she omitted even sharing a word about her plan.[7] . In the anti-government sentiment that followed, many Sikhs called on Giani Zail Singh to resign his post. On advice from Yogi Bhajan that the situation for Sikhs would only deteriorate if he were to quit, Zail Singh kept his position. However he was subsequently called before the Akal Takhat to apologize and explain his inaction at the descration of the holy site and killing of innocent Sikhs. At the death of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Zail Singh in his role as President appointed her surviving son, Rajiv Gandhi successor. Theirs was an uneasy relationship[citation needed] . Giani Zail Singh served as President of India until 1987.[8] [edit] Death Whenever Giani Zail Singh was in Punjab or close to it, he rarely missed a chance of paying his respects at the shrine of Anandpur Sahib. On one such pilgrimage, he was involved in a serious auto crash near Kiratpur Sahib in Ropar district on 29 November 1994. He subsequently died at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Chandigarh on 25 December 1994 and was cremated at Ekta Sthal in the Raj Ghat area.[9]\n\n46. R.
