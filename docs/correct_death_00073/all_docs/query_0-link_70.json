        "text": "Margaret Buckley (née Goulding) (1879 — 24 July 1962) was an Irish republican and president of Sinn Féin from 1937 to 1950.\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 President of Sinn Féin\n\n3 References\n\n4 Sources\n\nEarly life\n\nOriginally from Cork, she joined Inghinidhe na hÉireann, which was founded in 1900, and was involved in the War of Independence in Cork.[1] She was involved in anti-British royal visit protests in 1903 and 1907 and was among the group that founded An Dún in Cork in 1910. In 1906, she married Patrick Buckley, described as \"a typical rugby-playing British civil servant\". After his death she moved into a house in Marguerite Road, Glasnevin, Dublin. Later, she returned to Cork to care for her elderly father.\n\nArrested in the aftermath of Easter Rising she was released in the amnesty of June 1917 and played a prominent role in the reorganisation of Sinn Féin.\n\nAfter the death of her father, she returned to Dublin. In 1920, she became a Dáil Court judge in the North city circuit, appointed by Austin Stack, the Minister for Home Affairs of the Irish Republic.\n\nShe opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and was interned in Mountjoy and Kilmainham, where she went on a hunger strike.[1] She was released in October 1923.[1] During her imprisonment, she was elected Officer Commanding (OC) in of the republican prisoners in Mountjoy, Quarter Master (QM) in the North Dublin Union and OC of B-Wing in Kilmainham. She was an active member of the Women Prisoners' Defence League, founded by Maud Gonne and Charlotte Despard in 1922.\n\nIn 1929, she served as a member of Comhairle na Poblachta which unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the differences between Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army.\n\nBuckley was also an organiser for the Irish Women Workers’ Union.\n\nPresident of Sinn Féin\n\nAt the October 1934 Sinn Féin ardfheis, she was elected one of the party's vice-presidents. Three years later in 1937 she succeeded Cathal Ó Murchadha who was a former TD of the second Dáil Éireann as President of Sinn Féin,[1] at an ardfheis attended by only forty 40 delegates.\n\nImportantly, when she assumed the leadership of Sinn Féin, the party was not supported by the IRA, which had severed its links with the party in the 1920s. When she left the office in 1950, relations with the IRA had been resolved.\n\nIn 1938, her book about the experiences of Irish Republican women prisoners interned by the Irish Free State forces was published, called The Jangle of the Keys. In 1956, her Short History of Sinn Féin was published.\n\nShe served as honorory vice-president of Sinn Féin from 1950 until her death in 1962. She was the only member of the ardchomairle of the party not to be arrested during a police raid in July 1957.\n\nShe died on 24 July 1962 and is buried in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n\"Margaret Buckley, president of Sinn Féin\", Saoirse Irish Freedom, July 1998."
