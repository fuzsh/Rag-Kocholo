Cryan, Sr. who was born in Lowell, Massachusetts on June 25, 1911, died in the same city today, October 15, 2001.\n\nThankfully he had ninety good years and a few bad weeks. He was conscious and aware until the end. After his most recent stroke which left him unable to communicate, he became somewhat frustrated with his inability to speak or write and stopped eating. He died peacefully this morning at 6:30.\n\nIn keeping with his wishes, there will not be a wake. There will be a memorial service at St. Patrick's church in Lowell this Saturday, October 20th, at 9:00am.\n\nHis fervent favorite charity was the St. Vincent de Paul Society at St. Patrick's. Donations in his memory can be sent to: St. Vincent de Paul Society, c/o Fr. Spagnolia, St. Patrick's Church, 282 Suffolk Street, Lowell, MA 01854.\n\nThere will be a gathering of friends and family at the home of Terry and Peter Cryan, 56 Century Mill Road, Bolton, Mass. after the memorial service. Driving from Lowell take I495 South to exit 27, Rte. 117 Bolton/Stow. Turn right toward Stow at the bottom of the ramp on 117. In a quarter of a mile turn right on Rte. 85 toward Hudson. Exactly one mile from the start of Rte. 85 you will find Century Mill Road on the right. 56 is a third of a mile down the road on the left. Call 978/779-0723 if you need help.\n\nHope to see you on Saturday.\n\nHis family.\n\nFrom: Fatarm@aol.com | Block Address | Add to Address Book\n\nDate: Fri, 2 Nov 2001 08:51:50 EST\n\nSubject: [Cryan et al.] Useful resource list for Roscommon researchers\n\nTo: CRYAN-L@rootsweb.com\n\nThe following was recently posted to the Roscommon County mailing list\n\non\n\nrootsweb and may prove of use to someone on our list, so I thought I'd\n\nrepost\n\nit here.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nSubj: ROSCOMMON-D Digest V01 #172\n\nDate: 11/2/01 4:12:04 AM Eastern Standard Time\n\nFrom: ROSCOMMON-D-request@rootsweb.com\n\nFrom: HMWEBBER@aol.com\n\nTo: ROSCOMMON-L@rootsweb.com\n\nSubject: [Roscommon-l] Co.

The oldest was Bridget, baptized in May 1826.\n\nThen\n\ncame Winifred, Sarah, Patrick, Mary, Mark, John, Timothy, Michael and\n\nJames\n\n(not necessarily in that order). Sometime between 1846 (when the\n\nyoungest\n\nchild was born) and 1848, John died. Atty took the kids and emigrated\n\nto\n\nAmerica on the ship Epaminondas, landing at Boston in June of 1848. In\n\n1850,\n\nshe and her brother-in-law Mark Cryan and the kids were in Leominster,\n\nMassachusetts, and by 1855, the whole crowd was settled in Wisconsin,\n\nwhere\n\nthey flourished.\n\n-- Except for Bridget. We never found any more evidence of Bridget's\n\nlife\n\nbesides her baptismal record. We thought that perhaps she too died in\n\nIreland, or that she married and stayed there with her husband. No\n\nclues.\n\n-- Until this week! One of our cousins visited another recently-found\n\ncousin\n\nand they went through the old family Bible. Listed in the family Bible\n\nis\n\nthis: Bridget Crain McDonough, died Boston, November 22, 1849. Her\n\ndaughter,\n\nSara Jane, died Leominster, Mass., July 15, 1850. We don't have an age\n\nfor\n\nSara Jane.\n\n-- Anyone have any info about a marriage between Bridget\n\nCrain/Crane/Cryan\n\nand a McDonough/McDonagh in Ireland? Maybe a baptismal record for Sara\n\nJane?\n\n-- Every clue brings more questions!\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to all,\n\nA.

We don't have an age\n\nfor\n\nSara Jane.\n\nI think that I have already given to you the baptism dates of all\n\nAtty's\n\nchildren except Timothy which I do not have. I also have an Anne (bapt\n\n10\n\nOct 1837) which you do not mention. If any of your dates are missing do\n\nlet\n\nmet know and I can sent it to you.\n\nI do not have a marriage of a Bridget Cryan McDonough (or variations in\n\nspelling) of the right age. I would have expected that Bridget(Atty's\n\ndaughter would have been at least 15 on marriage and therefore the\n\nmarriage\n\nwould be after 1841.\n\nHowever I do have a child of a marriage Crine/McDonogh from Aghanagh\n\nparish\n\nwhich could be of either a sister of John (Atty's husband) or a brother\n\nof\n\nAtty or both.

You must have been like a\n\nraging lion when your own brothers had to hold you.\n\nHugh Rorke, the complainants father, deposed that he\n\nsaw the stream of blood coming down his sons face\n\nwhen Cryan struck him.\n\nMr McMorrow - You swear more than your son; he did not\n\nswear that.\n\nJames Cryan was examined in this cross-case and said\n\nthat Hugh Rorke would not allow him drive the bullock\n\nout on the gate of the field where he was trespassing.\n\nThe Rorke family then ran out with stones in their\n\nhands and surrounded him, and he defended himself with\n\na loy. Hugh Rorke gave the calf such a welting that he\n\ndid not believe the calf would do any good.\n\nYoung Rorke pointed to a mark he had got on his\n\nforehead.\n\nCryan - On your oath was it I put that on you?\n\nRorke - You renewed it.

Beirne.\n\nMr MacDermot, solicitor, appeared for the defence.\n\nOld Beirne deposed that his son, Malachi Beirne, who\n\nwas assaulted, could not attend as he was at\n\nStrand-hill. He and his son were cleaning a bank on\n\nthe 6th of June, James Lowe and John Lowe came and\n\nbegan to remove the turf. His son went to prevent\n\nthem. James Lowe rushed at him and knocked him down.\n\nJohn Lowe struck him with a spade on the side of the\n\nhead inflicting a deep wound from the effects of which\n\nhe lay for some weeks. James Lowe caught him\n\n(witness) by the throat, and having thrown him kicked\n\nhim in the face.\n\nCross-examined by Mr MacDermot  I did not know\n\nwhehter the place where I was cutting was within\n\nLowes boundary as both claimed it.\n\nBridget Cryan was examined for the defence. She\n\ndeposed that she saw the Lowes throwing Beirnes turf\n\nback from where it was. Beirne came over with a slane\n\nin his hand. Lowe met him and caught hold of the\n\nslane. Four men then came on the scene, and from that\n\nshe did not know who was striking. She saw a cut on\n\nLowes breast aftewards [sic] as if from the wing of a\n\nslane.\n\nPatrick Lowe and Michael Cryan gave similar evidence.\n\nIt was mentioned that the money which Beirne was to\n\nreceive from Lowe was in bank.\n\nCapt. McTernan suggested that the case be adjourned\n\nfor a fortnight.\n\nMr MacDermot requested that no more petty evidence be\n\ntaken.\n\nCapt.

There was also a cross-case.\n\nMr MacDermot appeared for Rorke, and Mr Robinson for\n\nCryan.\n\nHugh Rorke deposed that on the 21st of April James\n\nCryan threw his mearing on his crop. He also\n\nattempted to throw a stone on him 2 1D 2 cwt weight.\n\nCryan threw stones on his (Rorke s) oats and potatoes.\n\nThe mearing between them was divided eighty years\n\nago. Cryan had no reason to interfere with it only\n\nfor his bad temper.\n\nJohn Rorke, Pat Rorke and James Rorke gave\n\ncorroborative evidence.\n\nMrs Cryan deposed that the gate on her mearing wall\n\nwas thrown by the Rorkes. Her husband always made up\n\nthe fence. There was a wooden post put down as a\n\npier, and Rorke took the whole thing away. The\n\nmearing was hers, and on a former occasion Rorke\n\nsummoned her for sheep crossing it.\n\nMr MacDermott [sic]  And take it for granted that it\n\nis your mearing, your son was not justified in\n\nthrowing stones into the mans crops.\n\nMr Bull said Cryan should pay 5s fine, 10s\n\ncompensation and costs.\n\nThe cross-case was then gone into when it was shown\n\nthat the Rorkes maliciously broke the capstone of the\n\npier.\n\nDenis Loughna, Boyle, deposed that he was at the\n\nplace. There was nothing injured but the capstone of\n\nthe pier. The gate was a little injured.\n\nJames Beirne deposed that half the gate was broken.\n\nTo Mr MacDermot  I live nearly three miles from the\n\nplace. I am a brother to Mrs Cryan.\n\nMr MacDermot  She went far to get a witness. Your\n\nevidence will be taken for what it is worth.\n\nThe Bench imposed a fine of five shillings, ten\n\nshillings compensation and costs.\n\nAssault\n\nArising out of the above case, James Cryan summoned\n\nJames Rorke for assaulting him on the 21st of April.\n\nCryan deposed that when he was going to remove the\n\ncapstone Rorke jumped on his hand, and assaulted him.\n\nRorke followed him to his own door wanting him to\n\nfight, and he had nine others with him.\n\nTo Mr MacDermot  I would have summoned him before\n\nthis but my attorney was away. I was bound to the\n\npeace the last court day and fined.\n\nSeveral witnesses were examined for the defence.\n\nAn old man named Rorke deposed that defendant did not\n\nput hand or foot on Cryan. Cryan would swear the\n\nsowl [sic] out of his body to get satisfaction\n\n(laughter).\n\nThe case was dismissed.\n\nDate: Sat, 29 Dec 2001 15:30:34 +0000 (GMT)\n\nFrom: \"Caoimhghin O Croidheain\" <caoimhghin@yahoo.com> | Block Address | Add to Address Book\n\nSubject: [Cryan et al.] Hi\n\nTo: CRYAN-L@rootsweb.com\n\nHi\n\nHappy Christmas and New Year to everyone.

Off A34 &\n\nM6 (01922 613100)\n\nThe Wharf has won a rare award -- top in the 1998 'New\n\nBuild' category in the annual Pub Design Awards run by\n\nEnglish Heritage and the Campaign for Real Ale. The\n\naward is rare, for it's the first time in 14 years\n\nthat a prize for a new pub design has been made. As\n\none of the judges, Dr Steven Parissien of the Paul\n\nMellon Centre, said in his citation: 'Most new pubs\n\nwere either couched as veneered bunkers or heritage\n\nhorrors. This past year, however, some pub owners\n\nappear to have summoned the courage and foresight to\n\ncombine the familiar virtues of the public house with\n\nthe best of modern design.' The pub is owned by the\n\nlocal Highgate and Walsall Brewing Company, run on a\n\nshoe-string following a management buy-out from mighty\n\nBass, and the new owners richly deserve the award. For\n\nthose steeped in mock-Tudor and fake beams, the Wharf\n\nwill come as something of a shock. It stands in the\n\nrevitalised waterside Wharf area of Walsall and is\n\nalongside the new Lottery-funded Art Gallery. The pub\n\nis single storey with a large pitched roof, tiled\n\ngable ends and plain windows giving good views of the\n\nwaterfront. Dr Parissien says the interior is 'defined\n\nby a Scandinavian-style use of pale wood and by a\n\nback-to-basics approach to fixtures and fittings.\n\nThere are no heritage blackboards, only graphics\n\npainted directly on to wood, brick or glass, while the\n\nseating is simple, honest and functional'. It's an\n\nopen-plan pub and landlord Kevin Cryan says it was\n\ndesigned to be multi-functional, with a mobile stage\n\nfor live music at weekends and intimate areas during\n\nthe week. 'We wanted to break down the barriers that\n\nexist in most pubs,' he said. 'It's female-friendly\n\nfor a start and it's popular with students who drop in\n\nto do their homework over a coffee. Others play\n\nchess.' The Wharf opens at 10am for late breakfast and\n\nthere is bistro-style food during the rest of the day\n\nwith such dishes as lamb cutlets in a silver onion\n\nsauce, pan-fried cod on potato cake, and whole baked\n\npeppers with mushroom risotto. The Highgate Brewery\n\nbeers include its famous Dark Mild, plus Saddlers\n\nBitter and such seasonal beers as Breacais, a beer\n\nbrewed with whisky malt.\n\nFrom: \"Helen Cryan\" <HCRYAN@MN.RR.COM> | Block Address | Add to Address Book\n\nTo: \"Caoimhghin O Croidheain\" <caoimhghin@yahoo.com>\n\nSubject: Cryan Genealogy\n\nDate: Sun, 30 Dec 2001 20:33:52 -0000\n\nDear Kevin,\n\nI am indeed interested in doing some research, especially about my family and if possible, my family history.

If de Valera made a\n\nspeech it was reported verbatim but if the Taoiseach\n\nmade a speech and paragraphs were cut nobody noticed.\n\nIndeed, accompanying de Valera on the campaign trail\n\nwas a well-recognised occupational hazard for Burgh\n\nQuay [quay in Dublin where office of Irish Press was\n\nlocated] journalists. This job usually fell to the\n\nperson then regarded as the political correspondent of\n\nthe Irish Press, Sean Cryan, who was regularly given\n\nthe task of accompanying de Valera to various\n\nspeech-making ceremonies. Not only was Cryan the\n\npapers fastest shorthand taker but he could also\n\ntranslate the Irish parts of de Valeras speeches into\n\nshorthand:\n\nCryan accompanied de Valera on most of his trips and\n\nde Valera would tend to go off the script or not have\n\na script at all, so it was critical to have him\n\nverbatim. The chief was very conscious of that. If you\n\ngot a quote wrong there would be inquiries all the way\n\ndown. In those days, all copy would be bagged for a\n\nperiod, day-by-day, week-by-week, big envelopes full\n\nof copy used to stretch all around the walls of the\n\nnewsroom. So if anyone were pulled on anything, they\n\nwould go back to the copy, see who subbed it and find\n\nout who made the mistake - whether it was the reporter\n\nor sub-editor or both. Then youd have inquiries\n\ncoming down the line from the likes of the managing\n\ndirector, Bill Redmond asking How was it that you got\n\nthis quote wrong?\n\nNotes\n\n1951 30 May Election: Government - Fianna Fáil with E.\n\nde Valera.\n\n1954 18 May Election: Coalition - Fine Gael/Clann na\n\nPoblachta with J.
