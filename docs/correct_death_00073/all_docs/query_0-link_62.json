CJatks Insurance Company of North America PHILADELPHIA _, Mnin Office : Central Office : I mrd and Walnut Streets Real Estate Trust Building Year Book a Time Saver Necessity may or may not be \"the mother of invention,\" but it called the Philadelphia Year Book into being. Time lost looking up facts or figures about the city which were nowhere assembled for handy consultation induced the compiler to gather into a comprehen- sive volume the statistics, chronology and history of Philadelphia arranged for instant use. At first the book was neglected, while the same spendthrift course of wasting time to look elsewhere for facts required continued. A few experiences of this kind were enough to convince even the skeptical that the Year Book should always be consulted first. That was the experience in one large establishment which main- tained an extensive reference library. The Year Book is now a habit there. As with the typewriter and the calculating machine, the Year Book's use has to be learned. The alphabetical arrangement and the cross-reference system make learning easy.

EUGENE F, NICE Philadelphia, Pa. U.S.A. Camden, N.J COPVRIGHT 1920 BY JOSEPH F. A. JACKSOJ Style and arrangement of this volume are protected by the general copyright PRIX Ten BY PA l rERSON 4 Will rE c >. PHIL*., PA. nwjoii FOREWORD This issue of the Year Book will be found to he a considerable improvement over the Year Book for 1919, both for compre- hensiveness arid for the timeliness of its information. The change of date of publication made necessary this year on ac- count of the change not only of the personnel of the City Government, but of the City's Charter, has shown the advis- ability of keeping the date of publication in March. At the time the Year Book goes to press the Census figures for the city are not available, but the estimates hinted at by the local supervisor of the Census is warrant for the statement that the figures will be found to he approximately 2,000 ,000. This means that there are in Philadelphia more people than were in the whole of the United States at the outbreak of the Revolution. Some of the other figures to he found in the Year Book this year will be of more than ordinary interest ; for sake of brevity they will here be summarized : Bank clearings for 1910 totaled $22,049 ,588, 655 , or about four times that of the entire country in 1861. Exports for the year 1919 amounted to $522,391,091, and imports, $153,874,515, the largest in the port's history. Of the exports, $88,698,423, or more than the whole volume of exports in any year before 1915, went to Latin-American coun- tries. The imports from these countries totaled $5,489,796. Shipbuilding on the Delaware retained its prominence ; 135 ships, of a total tonnage of 1 ,097,535, were, launched for the Government's programme of cargo carriers. In addition there Were six torpedo boats launched. Business failures, shown by 159 petitions in bankruptcy, were the lowest in number for many years. The Mint of the United States made five-sevenths of the coinage produced in the country in 1919 , amounting to a total of 501,000,000 pieces, being greater than the production of any mint in the world. Public bequests for the year totaled $6,413,850. A traffic census showed that on one square on Broad Street, from Filbert to Arch Streets, 17,000 vehicles passed in a day of sixteen hours. Real estate assessments showed a total assessment of $2,140,614,928, of which $282,401,928 is exempt, and conse- quently much below the market value. The death rate of the city was the lowest over a period of years. The Bureau of Vital Statistics, estimating on a popu- lation of 1,781 ' ,225, gives it as 14.52 per 1000. As the popula- tion is obviously more than this estimate, the figures should be even lower.

Most ancient and honored scientific organization in the United States. Founded at the suggestion of Franklin, in 1743. As it also is a direct descendant of Franklin's Junto, which he formed in 1727 or 1728, the society might permissibly regard that time as the date of its beginning. The Junto was re-organized in 1766 as The American Society held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowl- edge. In 1769 the two organizations were merged under its present title, which, in full is, \"The American Philosophical So- ciety held at Philadelphia for Promoting Useful Knowledge.\" Franklin became first president of the society thus conjoined, and his successors have been David Ritten- house, Thomas Jefferson, Dr. Caspar Wis- tar, Dr. Robert Patterson, Chief Justice Tilghman, Peter S. Du Ponceau, Robert M. Patterson, Dr. Nathaniel Chapman, Dr. Franklin Bache, Prof. Alexander Dallas Bache, Judge John K. Kane, Dr. George B. Wood, Frederick Fralev, General Isaac Wistar, Dr. Edgar F. Smith, and Dr. W. W. Keen. President, William B. Scott, Prince- tor., N. J. Secretary, I. Minis Hays, M.D. Treasurer, Flenry LaBarre Jayne. In the society's hall is a museum of literary and scientific relics and a valuable library. Its remarkable manuscript collec- tions include the Franklin Papers, Jeffer- son's Draft of the Declaration of Indepen- dence, and the field note books of Lewis and Clark, the explorers of the northwest. Among its art treasures are Houdon's bust of Franklin, Stuart's portrait of Washing- ton, painted for the society; Sully's por- trait of Jefferson, painted from life, and portraits or sculptured busts of all the former presidents of the organization. The society has in its care for awards for recognition of scientific discoveries and as prizes for essays, the funds eiven by Ma- gellan, by Miss Emily Phillips and by Michaux. The Michaux fund was partly iised to plant a fine collection of oak trees in Fairmount Park, and also to defray the cost of lectures on forestry about thirty- five years ago. These lectures laid the foundation for virtually ail that has been done toward conservation and forestry in this country. At the annual meetings of the society, usually held in April, and last four days, the best scientific workers in the United Suites read important papers, and PHILADELPHIA YEAR BOOK, 1920 usually important contributions of this kind are sent from scientists in other parts of the world, where members of the society are to be found. It has occupied its pres- ent hall on Fifth Street since 1790. having had the ground on which it is built pre- sented to it by the State of Pennsylvania. It is proposed by the municipality to ex- change a plot on the 1'arkway for the Fifth Street site and there the society may have a newer and larger home. See Li- braries.

Araming'o — A borough created out of the township of the Northern Liberties, incorporated April 11, 1850. It was shaped something like a broad V reversed. It was bounded on the northeast by a portion of ;he borough of Bride-burg and the Frank- t . r ri Creek, which divided it from a por- tion of Oxford township and Frankford; on the northwest the Unincorporated North- ern Liberties and the District of the Northern Liberties were boundaries, the bitter partly on the southwest; and Rich- mond district on the southeast and south- west. The name is an abbreviation and alteration from the Indian name of the stream adjacent, called, by the Swedes and English, Gunner's Run. The original name was Tumanaranaming, the meaning of which is not known.

By provision of act \"no work of art shall 1 ecome tiie property of a city of the first class by purchase, gift or otherwise, unless such work of art or design for the same, and the proposed location of such work of art shall first have been submitted to and approved by the Art Jury of said city, nor shall any work of art, until so approved, be erected or placed in any building, highway, stream, lake, square, park or other public place be- longing to or under the control of said \"No construction or erection, in a city of the first class, of any building, bridge, or its approaches, arch, gate, fence, or other structure or fixture, which is to he paid, for, either wholly or in part, by ap- propriation from the city treasury or other public funds, or for which the city or other public authority is to furnish a site, shall be begun, unless the design and proposed location thereof, shall have been submitted to the jury at least sixty davs before the final approval thereof, by the officer or other person having authority to contract therefor.

February 2d. — Designs for two stations on the Frankford Elevated line, prepared by the Department of City Transit, rejected by Art Jury. ■ February 8th.— Contracts for the stations at Kensington and Allegheny Avenues, ami Kensington Avenue and Somerset Street awarded, despite the rejection of the plans. March 2Sth. — Controversy over the Frank- ford Elevated Station plans settled by the Art Jury approving the drawings. April 19th. — In its Eighth annual report the Art Jury warned of unfit war me- morials. It also recommended the. forbid- ding of billboards on all properties fronting on Parks and Parkways. June 24th. — Judge Finletter filed an opinion granting the Southwark Realty Company an injunction against the city and the Chief of the Bureau of Highways, re- straining the defendents from removing a marquise, or iron awning on an apartment house at Sixteenth and Spruce Streets. In his opinion the Court said: \"The issuance of his permit depends legally in no way upon action of the Art Jury. The ordinance of 1915 confers upon the bureau chief, and upon him alone, the discretion to issue permits. It is obvious that he has no power to delegate that dis- cretion to the Art Jury nor to any one else. \"And it is equally plain that he is not to be considered as possessing an arbitrary' discretion. But even if he did, he is bound to exercise it, and exercise it himself. It the proofs in a given case showed an ap- plication for a permit and mere inaction by him he could without doubt be compelled to act and either grant or refuse the permit. In a case like the present, where he has expressed himself as quite willing to grant the permit and has said that he would be fully justified in doing so, and where he declines to do so because of a mistaken deference which he insists upon showing the Art Jury, we think it is an abuse of discretion to refuse to grant the permit.\" Art Museum— This building, intended to house the municipal collections of paint- ings and other art works is to occupy the old Fairmount Hill, on which stood for a century the Fairmouut reservoir. It is designed to be the crowning architectural achievement in connection with the Parkway. In 1S94 the Commissioners of Fairmount Park asked City Councils to appropriate $25,000 for the purpose of securing designs and plans for the erection of a museum and art gallery in Fairmount Park. On De- cember 31, 1894, councils appropriated $15,000 for the procurement of designs by competition for \"Fine Art Building, to be located near Lemon Hill.\" The Judges in 1895 accepted the design of Brite & Bacon. but the project proceeded no further until the Parkway improvement was reviewed, partly because the Parkway had been stricken from the city plans in December 1894. The original, or prize design, has been superseded by those of Jacques Greber and Horace Trumbauer. It is estimated that the museum will cost $5,000,000, when the first contracts for the work were let in July, there was $1,800,000 available. An injunction was asked by a taxpayer against the Fairmount Park Com- mission on the ground that the contract was not given the lowest bidder. On July 2Kt, Judges Audenried and McCullen refused the injunction, it being held the Commission was supreme in such case, the act quoted not applying to that body. On August 11th, the work of constructing the basement and tunnels was begun by the Frank Mark Con- tracting Company, whose bid was 8621,350. Fairmount Hill, the site of the museum, had already been granted, at a cost of $200,000. By will of George W. Elkins, the city- became possessor of his collection of paint- ings, valued at $2,500,000, including 110 masterpieces gathered by his father, Wil- liam L. Elkins, and 20 others collected by himself, which are to tie placed in a room or rooms in an art gallery erected and maintained by the city within five years c 1 the testator's death.

It included portions of the ground north and south of Woodland Avenue, and was principally settled by Swedes. Asoepek — This name is placed on Lind- strom's map of 1,654-55 west of Aleskins Kjlen (Frankford Creek), and was prob- ably an Indian village upon the site now occupied by Frankford. Assemblies, Dnneiiift\" — These social functions are among the most ancient and honored in Philadelphia, and to be distin- guished by being a subscriber to them has been regarded as a mark of social distinc- tion. Two dances are held each winter, and since the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel has been built the exclusive functions are always held there. For many years previously they were held in the foyer of the Academv of Music. None were held in 1918 or 1919, but were resumed January 2, 1920, when, for the first time since the establishment of the Assembly no wine was served at supper. The Second Assembly was held February 13th. The_ Dancing Assembly seems to have been founded in 174S, when the heads of the first families of Philadelphia at the time subscribed their forty shillings. The earliest subscription list contains fifty-nine names. In those days_ the dances were held every Thursday night from January 1st to May 1st and began precisely at six in the evening. Later, it became the rule to hold the dances every two weeks. The rule for many years past has been to limit the dai.ces to two in a season, usually the first Friday in January and the last Friday before Lent. The first assemblies are said to have been given in Hamilton's stores, or warehouse, in W.i'er Street, south of Dock. Later thev were held in the City Tavern, Heller's Hotel. Musical Fund Hall, and the Academy of Music. When they wore held at the Academy they ended, at three in the morning, but at the Bellevue-Stratford the hours for closing were later: At first five o'clock in the morning, but subsequently closed at four.

February 7th. — Announced that war con- tracts approximating $250,000,000 were ex- ecuted and delivered by the Baldwin Loco- motive Works and its associated companies during the war. The material consisted chiefly of locomotives, and included shells, munitions and gunmounts, which were de- livered to all of the belligerent nations. including the United States. The associated companies were the Stand- ard Steel Works, the Eddystone Ammuni- tion Corporation and the Eddystone Muni- tions Company. A total of 5651 locomotives of all gauges and types were turned out by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. They comprised 3246 broad-gauge and 1146 nar- row-gauge steam locomotives of various types, 20 broad-gauge gasoline locomotives and 113'} narrow- gauge gasoline locomotives. February 25 th. — Annual report showed that in 1918 there were constructed 3532 locomotives. 11 railway mounts for four- teen-inch guns. 16 caterpillar mounts for seven-inch suns, the total having a value of $109,515,970; other regular work was completed amounting to $13,663,281.

The surplus, after the preferred dividend payments, was $4,352,295, equal approximately to $21 a share on the $20,000,000 common stock; but as $2,500,000 has been appropriated for plant improvement, which is still unex- pended, the surplus for the year was re- duced to $1,852,295, equal to about $9 a share on the common stock. The amount set aside for taxes, $6,500.- 000, was unusually large when compared with $1,750,000 set aside for that purpose in 1917.

Banks — There are forty-four banks in Philadelphia, exclusive of trust and other companies doing a banking business, and exclusive also, of 9»vings institutions. The Federal Reserve Bank for the Third Dis- trict is located in Philadelphia. Bank of North America, 307 Chestnut Street, is_ the oldest in the country. The idea of its formation was presented by Robert Morris during the most depressing period of the Revolutionary War, when the country was _ in distress upon account of the depreciation of the Continental money. Tt had been preceded by the Bank of Pennsylvania, established by subscript;on in Philadelphia of ninety-three individuals and firms to the amount of £300,000, Penn- sylvania currency, payable in gold and sil- ver. The object was \"to support the credit of a bank to be established for fur- nishing a supply of provisions for the armies of the United States.\" This bank went out of existence upon the establish- ment of the Bank of North America, which was really the same institution, being in great proportion composed of the same shareholders. Congress chartered the Bank of North America December 18, 1781, and the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1782. The latter was repealed in 1785, and the bank acted under the Congresssional charter. _ In 1787 a new state charter was obtained, and since that time until the passage of the national banking act the bank was a state institution. The bank has occupied its present site almost from the time of its formation. The pres- ent building was erected in 1893. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia — 925 Chestnut Street. Organized under the provisions set forth in an act of Congress dated December 23, 1914, known as the ''Federal Reserve Act.\" Its charter was issued by John Skelton Williams. Comp- troller of the Currency under date of No- vember 14, 1914, and the bank opened for business November 16, 1914, with Charles J. Rhoads as governor. The Third Federal Reserve District, min- istered to by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, comprises 48 counties of Penn- sylvania (the 19 counties in the western part of the state belonging to the Fourth Dis- trict), the eight lower counties of New- Jersey and the entire State of Delaware. The capital stock of the bank is held by the member banks only, each bank upon becoming a member being required to sub- scribe for stock in the Federal Reserve Bank to an amount equal to 6 per cent, of its own combined capital and surplus. This stock carries a cumulative dividend of 6 per cent. Thus far on!v 50 per cent, of the par value of the s'ock has been called, the remaining 50 per cent, being subject tr. immediate call at any time at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board. The stock of the Federal Reserve Rank cannot be sold or hypothecated. There are now in die district 678 member banks, made up as follows: National Banks 640; State Banks, 6; Trust Companies, 32. The bank now has a paid-in capital if $7,884,150, surplus $8.805. 132.41 and earn- ing assets of $247,104,400.92. ft employs a force of 636 persons divided into 23 department This includes four separate departments handling Liberty Loan Bonds PHILADELPHIA YEAR BOOK, 1920 17 and War Savings and Thrift Stamps with a fnrce of 70 clerks.

La Bold; Comttroilcr, Robert D. Stockton. The fourth annual report of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for the year 191S shows a great increase in operations over the previous year, and reflects the effect of the war on financial operations. The ease with which this district absorbed its allotments of the great Government loans and financed the industries engaged in war work, was due to the great avail- ability of the credit resources of the country made effective through the Federal Reserve System. The resources of the bank more than doubled during the year and are eight times greater than Che figures for the close of 1916. On December 31. 1914, less than two months after the bank opened fur bus- iness, the resources amounted to $21,- 501,000. Compared with December 31, 1917, figures at the end of 1918 indicate an in- crease of $}2,068,4gQ in the gold holdings and an increase of $144,544,990 in the amount of Federal Reserve notes in cir- culatinn. The work of gathering in the gold in circulation throughout the district, which had been begun in the previous year, was continued, and the increase noted aliuve is due largely to this work. The paid-in capital increased $1,420,300 during the year. This was brought about principally by the admission of State Banks and trust companies, having combined capital and surplus of $38,812,017. Xet earnings reached the large amount of $3,270,824, ur 46 per cent, on the aver- age paid-in capital stock for the year. Arter payment of dividends of $366,383.14 covering the period from, Fulv 1, 1917, to June 30, .1918, and $216,825.56 covering the period .from July 1, 1918, to December 3 1, 1918, there remained in the profit and loss account $2, 603,343^91, one-half of which was placed to surplus account, the remainder, under the terms of the act, ig to the Government a- a franchise tax. \\\\ iide deposit liabilities of die bank have remained fairly steady, liabilities for Fed- eral Reserve notes have- increased from 597,325,755 to $241,870,745. The percent- ■k<- of reserve against combined liabilities Jeii from t>v7 at the beginning of the year to 44.6 at the close. The lowest^ point reached was 39.6 per cent, on Xovem- 1 er 2 2d. The discount facilities of the bank were used extensively, loans increasing contin- ually throughout the year. Total opera- tions, exclusive of purchases of Government .securities, amounted to $1,977,660,746, of which 77 per cent, represented paper se- cured by obligations of the Government. ' The largest amount of borrowing at any one period occurred in connection with the issue of the fourth Liberty loan, earning assets increasing from $118,694,530 on September 28th, the opening date of the campaign, to $209,449,707 on December 3d. Total earnings from investments amounted to $4,230,955, compared with $9S7.057 the preceding year. The average rate of return from all classes of investments was 4.19 per cent., compared with 3.32 per cent, in 1917, and 2.42 per cent, in 1916. Federal Reserve notes outstanding reached the high mark of $243,142,700 on December 26th. The act now provides for the issue of Federal Reserve notes in the denominations of $500, $1000. $5000, and $10,000, but so far none have been issued. The required gold reserve of 40 per cent, against Federal Reserve notes in actual cir- culation ■ was maintained throughout the year. Third Federal Reserve District. While the area of the Third Federal Re- serve District is only 1.2 per cent, of the entire area of the country, the population is more tHan 6 per cent, and the resources of , the member national banks more than 8 per cent. The total resources of national and state banking institutions in the district, not in- cluding trust funds, are $2,702,193,000. The member banks have maintained strong reserve positions. On September 12, 1914, two months prior to the inauguration of the Federal Reserve banking system, the banks held excess reserves of only $22,000, 000 above the then required reserve of $1 \"5,000.000. whereas the Federal Reserve Act released $50,000,000 of the reserves when it went into operation. The law now requires reserves of member banks to be deposited entirely with the Federal Re- serve Bank. The amendment lowered re- serve requirements and released a large amount of loanable funds. The Federal Reserve Bank has acted as fiscal .\"'g<-nt of the Government in the placing of the Liberty Loan bonds and Treasury certificates of indebtedness, war savings certificates, thrift stamps, etc. in this District 314 institutions were appointed Government depositories for the proceeds of the war loans. 15 PHILADELPHIA YEAR BOOK, 1920 for new Bank at Tweirb ItrinU Chronology In 1919 — Jan- uary 21st. — Samuel S.

This club later had its club house and ball field at Twenty-fifth and Jefferson Street?, but it did not adopt what was known as the National Association's game of baseball until 1860. The Olympic Club was an active organization for many years. The Minerva Baseball Club was formed in Philadelphia in 1857; The Keystone Base- ball Club, in 1859; The Athletics, in I860; Equitv Club, in I860; and the Swiftfoot Baseball Club, in 1866. Of these early baseball clubs only the Athletics survives, the oldest ball club in the country. Shibe Park, Twenty-first Street and Le- high Avenue, opened April, 1908. Cost, $650,000. Capacity, 24,000. Home of the Athletics (American League). Philadelphia National League Park, Broad and Huntingdon Streets, opened 1887. Cost. $275,000. Capacity. 18,000. Home of the Philadelphia Baseball Club (National League). Bastile Day — July 14th. While the fall of the Bastile has been commemorated by the French citizens of Philadelphia for more than a century, the day was first observed here generally in 1918, in response to a proclamation by the President and by a proclamation by the Governor of Penn- sylvania. In 1919 there was no general observance but the occasion was as usual celebrated by the French Societies of the city. Public— See Play- Bath-houses, grounds. Bath Town — A settlement in the Northern Liberties, established in the year 1765, and situated near the Germantowfl Road, between the Cohocksink Creek and trie Globe Mill. John White established the cold bath in the town of Bath in the Northern Liberties in the year named, and published a long e;say in the newspapers upon the virtues of cold bathing. Upon Hill's trap of 1808 the town of Bath is hid down in the neighborhood mentioned. The western boundary of Bath Town was between Pitt Street (afterward called St. John Street) and Third Street. Itehtterstovrn — Commonly but improp- erly caile d \"Beggarstown,\" was before the Revolution a part of Gemiantown, in the upper portion of the village, near the Mennonists' Church. It received its name from Mathias van Bebber, an early settler and landholder in the neighborhood. Belgians in Philadelphia — See Foreign Population. Bellevue — The name given to the sec- tion in the vicinity of Nicetown Lane and Westmoreland Street, in the 38th Ward. A pleasure park in the neighborhood once bore the name which soon spread to the settle- ment. In the early eighties sporting events and picnics were held there. A station on the main line of the Reading Railway for- merly was located at the Park. Belmont — A district created by Act of April 14, 1353. It embraced that paj\"t of Blockley Township which lav along the Schuylkill River from the northern, bound- ary-line between Philadelphia and Mont- gomery' counties, and had also its western boundary on that line. This district had scarcely time to be organized before the Act of Consolidation of February 2, 1854, put an end to its franchises. The name was derived from Belmont, the country-seat of the Peters family, which is now a portion of Fairmount Park. The mansion was erected by William Peters about 1743, and the name was descriptive of the fine posi- tion of the property, and suggestive of the beautiful views of the river and valley of the Schuylkill visible from the site. The property became the estate of Judge Richard Peters of the United States District Court in 1786, and he lived there until his death, which happened August 22, 1828. See Fairmount Park. Belmont Mansion — West Fark, half a mile from Forty-fourth Street entrance. One of the historic estates acquired by the Park Commissioners under the act of 1867, by which most of the West Park was added to the nucleus on the left bank of the Schuylkill. As the home of Judge Richard Peters, who was born and died there, and lived to be 84 years old, the place derives its fame. No part of the original house, erected in 17-i3, is standing, the old wing having given way to improvements made in 1876. William Peters, brother of the Rev. Richard f'e*ers, purchased the plantation, as it was called, in 1742, and the name survives to this day in E'eters Island, one or the few remaining islands in the two rivers. The plantation, which was :n Blockley town- ship, contained 220 acres, and was pur- chased from the widow of Daniel Jones, one of the early settlers. During the first year the estate was oc- PHILADELPHIA YEAR BOOK, 1920 21 cupied Judge Richard Peters was born. He was in many ways a remarkable man, famed for his wit and for his rare knowl- edge. Toward the end of the eighteenth century the present building was erected. It must have been an earlier building which the French traveler. Chastelleux, described as a \"tasty little box in the most charm- ing spot nature could embellish.\" At Belmont, which was occupied by Judge Peters only during the summer season, Washington, while President, was a fre- quent visitor. He planted a Spanish chest- nut tree in the grounds, and Lafayette, during his visit in 1824, planted a white walnut. Neither of these mementoes of the great survives. Belmont had as guests some of the great- est Americans and the most distinguished foreigners who visited the United States. Jefferson, the Adamses, Hancock and vari- ous members of Congress were entertained at the famous place, and here, too, came Baron Steuben, Kosciuszko and Pulaski, among foreigners identified with the Amer- ican cause. After the place was added to Fairmount Park a restaurant was established there by Adolph Proskauer, which about 40 years r>go was the most famous in the city. During the Centennial Exposition Pros- kauer's was a busy place. A large pavilion was built on the grounds, and in it notable banquets were given. During the summer season there are band concerts. The mansion is reached by Park Trolley. November 12th. — The Fairmount Park Commission gave permission for the erection of a restaurant on Belmont Plateau to cost S500.000 to a syndicate headed by W. J. Ostheimer. The building was to be opened July 4, 1920. November 20th. — City Councils by a resolution asked the opinion of the City Solicitor as to the powers of the Commis- sion to grant such permission. Ilelt Line Railroad Company — Chartered in 1889 to provide transportation facilities along the water front of the city, open to all railroads on equal terms. It operates under ordinances of Councils passed in 1890, 1S93, 18-4 and 1896. Its c imnWn stock, constituting 51 per cent, of the total capital, is held in trust jointly hv the Board of Trade and the Chamber '•} Commerce. Its franchise covers prac- tically the entire frontage of the city on the Delaware Fiver and a portion of the Schuylkill. There are two sections in opera- tion, one extending from Allegheny Avenue to Bridesi.urg (operated physically by the Reading Railway), and one' from Callow- hill Street to Tasker, on Delaware Avenue (operated by traffic agreement by the Penn- sylvania Railroad), about six and a half miles of track in all. Under an agreement between the city and the railroads, in 1914, the Belt Line is ultimately to be greatly extended. Bequests, Public, during 1919 January 2d. — Eliza L.

It has a large Sunday-school building, regarded as one of the largest in the country. It has accommodation for nearly 3000 scholars. Bethany Church is the home of many help- ful agencies, educational and charitable, as well as religious. See First Pcnnv Savings Bank. Bethany Church is one of the fruits of Bethany mission, established at 2133 South Street in 1858 by John Wanamaker, who gathered 27 children together in an upper story room for the purpose of instructing them in the Bible. The Bible class soon outgrew their modest quarter and a tent was erected for it on a neighboring lot. October 19th. — Rev. Dr. (\",. Campbell Morgan, of London, preached at Bethany. October 29th. — Sessions of the Inter- church Missionary were begun at Bethany. The studies were divided into groups for pastors, business men, Sunday-school officers and teachers. 26 PHILADELPHIA YEAR BOOK, 1920 Betsy Koss Honse — 239 Arch Street. This ancient and picturesque building is believed to have been the scene of the manufacture of the iirst American flap, and on Flag Day, June 14th, each year there is a public celebration in front of it. It has been shown, however, that Mrs. Ross, who is said to have made the first flag, did not live in this house but in one that stood on the site of the present building at 233 Arch Street. The building at 239 was purchased some years ago by an associa- tion, which is reported to have acquired more than S100.000 from the sales of cer- tificates of membership. The membership was more than 1,000,000. The project is believed to have been started in good faith, but the house had not been regarded as a historical site until about the year 1870, when the Betsy Ross tradition first was given to the world. This subject was thor- oughly discussed in the Public Ledger, for November 30, 1913. Beversrede — A fort erected by the Dutch about 1645 on the east bank of the Schuylkill River. It was so named on account of its being well situated to carry on a brisk trade in beaver-skins with the Indians.
