(Extract only)\n\nChristmas programmes Broadcast, Just a sample, below.\n\nO’Reilly’s Opera.” The programme includes a compact version of Wallace’s charming opera, sung by the Choir of the Christian Brothers’ School, Great Strand St., Dublin. This choir, trained by Rev. Brother Fitzgerald, is the one which went to Rome early in the year, at the invitation of ‘Les Petits Chanteurs a la Croiz de Bois, and its quality is altogether outstanding. The orchestra is the Radio Eireann Light Orchestra .\n\n“Cuimhni Nollag,” which starts at 6.30, is a special Christmas feature in Irish and consists of a series of four short talks by people prominent in the Irish language revival movement. “The Ballad Makers’ Christmas,” at 7 o’clock, is the first of a new series of programmes of a kind which were very popular with listeners some years ago. It will include such lovely ballads as “My Colleen Rua,” and the more modern “The Valley of Knockanure,” as well as rollicking ones such as “The Song of Puck Fair” and “Bould Thady Quill.” The singers will be Nellie Walsh, Sean O Siothchain and Joe Lynch, and the linking script has been prepared by Bryan Mc Mahon, the well-known Kerry writer and ballad maker , who has also selected the ballads. Other “Ballad-omanes” will introduce their favourite ballads in future programmes.\n\nImmediately following “The Ballad Makers’ Christmas” Radio Eireann will be presenting Saunders Lewis’ Nativity play, “The Christmas Candle.” This play,\n\nLimerick Leader 1905-current, Saturday, May 03, 1952; Page: 11\n\nEasier Week And I.R.A.

This will, no doubt, be an incentive to the first class football, one expects from such famed counties as Kerry and Mayo.\n\nMuch credit is due to the Abbeyfeale Old I.R..A. Veterans and, Vice-Chairman of the Abbeyfeale G.A.A. Club, Mr. Tommy O’Connell for their unsparing efforts in the organisation of this attraction, and every effort will be made to cater for the many thousands who will throng to Abbeyfeale to witness this match, organised for such a noble cause.\n\nLimerick Leader 29 March 1954 p1\n\nThe Society for the Modification of Steeplechasing and Grand National Reform has decided to write to the British Home Secretary calling for an inquiry Into the death of four horses in the Grand National on Saturday, (See paper for more on Shaw also)\n\nBACK after 43 years, Mr Edmond Dalton of Coole, Athea, is paying his first visit from Ciicago. He is a retired official of the Chicago Street car Company. (Edited) Break.\n\nMr. Dalton was again deeply moved when, on the night before his return to the United States, after a rather brief holiday, he was the guest of honour at an American “Wake” given at the home of his brother, Dick at Coole In accordance with an old local custom friends and neighbours gathered to wish him well and bid him a safe journey. The traditional programme of Irish music song and dance Included the fine rendering by a local tenor of that ever, popular ballad, “The Valley of Knockanure .” which recalls in touching words and plaintive melody the tragic story of one of the blackest nights In the history of the fight for freedom in West Limerick. For the first time in over half a century the veteran 65 year old American exile visibly broke down as the singer, with deep emotion, recalled the sad home coming of the remains of young Dalton to his broken hearted mother, who had since gone to join her dead patriot son.\n\nPLEASANTLY SURPRISED\n\nBut it wasn’t all tragedy for the welcome visitor from far off Chicago, whose visit also enabled him to renew acquaintances with four surviving brothers and two sisters Mr Dalton was very pleasantly surprised with the remarkable improvement in conditions In this country since he left home in 1911 Most, if not all, of his youthful acquaintances were dead or gone but there were quite a few happy family reunions, with numerous friends and relatives to share In the rejoicings And imagine Mr Dalton’s pleasant surprise when he came across an old friend and former fellow employee of the Chicago Street Car Company, Mr, Michael Hanley, a native of nearby Rooskagh, and now, In his retirement, farming near Knockaderry. The occasion, needless to add, called for a happy reunion between the two old friends in a well-known Knockaderry establishment, with old Chicago as the main topic of conversation.\n\nHOPES TO PAY FURTHER VISIT.\n\nMr Dalton has now returned to Chicago via Shannon but he hopes to pay a further and longer visit within the next three or four years so as to learn more about the old country from which he has been exiled for most of half a century. A widower, he served for three years with the American forces in France during World War No 1. He has four brothers and two sister’s still living in this country, which he still loves with all the ardour of his patriotic family.\n\nLimerick Leader 1905-current, Wednesday, April 18, 1956; Page: 3\n\nWest Limerick Folk Songs The Less Known Ditties, (By T O’C.)\n\n‘Sing them upon the sunny hills. When days are long and bright, And the blue gleam of shining rills Is loveliest to the sight; Sing them along the misty moor, Where ancient hunters roved, And swell them through the torrent’s roar, The songs our fathers loved.”\n\nThe above lines come to mind as I take a glance back through the years gone by and begin to rake out some of those grand old songs—those songs our grandparents and ancestors cherished, and those ditties they used to sing in such graceful and jovial style. THE LESS KNOWN SONGS, When referring to the grand songs of our past. I don’t really mean such airs as: “The West’s Asleep” or “The Rising OfThe Moon,” and as a matter of fact I don’t mean ones like “Bantry Bay” or ‘ The Stone Outside Dan Murphy’s Door” either. These are fine songs, no doubt; songs that our Irish people are virtually proud of, but still they are not even half as popular nowadays as they were in the days that used to be. However, they are still patronised by a good many people throughout the country, and it can be safely said that there is not a single one of those songs that Is not awakened and sung again on some occasion or other at the present day. Still, they deserve to be sung oftener than that. But there are other songs that are practically never heard in this age. They are in existence alright, but only half-alive, as it were, and they lying covered with the dust of time in some part of the old kitchen; in the cranny near the fireside maybe, or on the shelf of an old book-case Well, these are the songs I am concerned with on this occasion.\n\n(Break see paper for a long account of different types of songs)\n\nLOVE SONGS\n\nAs already mentioned, love songs of all themes are to be found in abundance in every county, and indeed. Limerick has its own galaxy of them. Strangely enough, love songs In West Limerick are not as numerous as those at the other end of the county. However, whatever few the Western side has to display, are of an excellent standard and are among the best to be found in the entire country. From the Castletown Conyers-Ballyagran district comes a really fine specimen of such, in “The Lily of Rossmore.” Three of our best love songs seem to belong to the south-western corner; that colourful landscape, watered by the lovely silvery Feale that flows by the towering heights of Mullaghareirk and Taur. The grand trio of love-songs — “At the Foot of Rooscagh Hill,” “My Sweet Little Girl from Barnagh,” and “My Maid of Inchibane,” all belong to this area of such fine traditions. Father Casey, of Abbeyfeale, the great land League priest and patriot, was almost Inseparably linked with this vicinity, and it Is only fitting we should be left a few fine songs In his memory. And speaking of these songs in tribute to this illustrious pastor, I cannot help being reminded of that lively ditty in praise of Father O’Flynn, which was rather strangely but truly written by one A.P. Graves, who was a son of the Protestant Bishop of Limerick.\n\nSONGS OF THE EXILES. Exile songs are also to be found in rich abundance around County Limerick, and from the spacious parish of Athea comes one of our best in ‘The Vales of New Dirreen.” The man mentioned in this song was not its composer as many people think. It was written by a man named Downey, from whoso pen also came a satire entitled “Snuff and Cut Muggin.” Its title is a bit quaint, but the song itself just describes the character and antics of a stingy and morose old farmer, nick-named “Snuff and Cut Muggin,” who lived a few miles to the east of Athea. There is a great tradition of all kinds of songs (together with music, dancing and even storytelling) in that stretch of hills and glens along the Kerry border, from the Shannon to the Feale, and this corner is particularly rich in ballads of the satirical type. . , From this locality came Michael Druery, a poet of the real natural type, who was certainly one of the best writers of folk-songs to be found anywhere. Druery was the son of a small farmer, himself being a wandering labourer, and was held in high esteem by all who knew him. His songs were of the real sentimental quality, being simple, humorous and witty, and evidently enough they captivated the admiration of everybody, no matter to what society they belonged. Druery compiled a large number of songs, but only a mere few of them seem to have appeared in print. His two best known ones are: “The Yorkshire Pigs” and ” Foley’s Jack Ass.” According to the former ballad, when the Yorkshire pigs were first introduced into the land, they caused much comment, particularly along the Limerick-Kerry border Everybody for miles around were talking and marvelling about them (even the priests and schoolmasters) while the people nearly went mad celebrating. Even the girls began to wear new fashions—ones that were unknown so far In the Limerick-Kerry border. However, our friend, Mick Druery did not seem to approve of this nonsense and so chided them in his satire when he wrote:\n\n“Ah but they’ll regret their conduct yet with their higheeled shoes and sprigs,\n\nThey’re too grand for to talk, as home they must walk for to fatten those Yorkshire pigs.”\n\nBut despite all their attention to these new pigs, the people soon realised their folly, when the store-keepers were pressing them to pay their bills. In conclusion to his satire on the Yorkshire pigs, Druery says: “Aroon, aroon, o blithe garsoon, brush the tears from your weary eye,\n\nFor the men of the meal In Abbeyfeale are building their castles high;\n\nDown with all the tyrants, and success to the man who digs\n\nMay we all live to see ould Ireland free and to hell with the Yorkshire pigs.”\n\nMick Druery also wrote a brief satire about Knockanure and its people; a matter that was never taken seriously, however. On one occasion he was hired by a very stingy individual. Dinner-time came along, with Druery and three other workers seated at table, when a large junk of a boar was placed before them. Anyway, the meat mustn’t have been very edible, because when Druery tasted it, he was heard to exclaim, in a loud firm voice: “O God above look down on us, and take pity upon us four, Give us mate that we can ate , and take away this boar.”\n\nOTHER SONGS OF THE LIMERICK-KERRY BORDER Perhaps few districts in any part of Ireland have housed such a nest of Gaelic poets as the Glin parish has. However, their story must await the telling on some other occasion. This parish has produced some fine songwriters also, foremost amongst them being Michael Stackpool, Who was a school-master and taught in Glin school during the earlier half of the last century. His beautiful lyric, ” The Humors of Glin,” is, perhaps, one of the loveliest of its kind ever written. When merely reading through the golden lines of this song, one could not help imagining himself hearing the captivating notes from the clairseach, falling so soft and sweet like petals from blown roses Two other lovely songs of sentimental nature, in praise of this old historic town, are “Gleann Corbraighe” and “Dear Old Glin.” The other side of the Limerlck-Kerry border is equally rich in song, and here we meet Mick Taylor, a postman, the fame of whose compositions has spread far and wide. He has given us one of the finest rebelly songs of all: “The Valley of Knockanure,” and also that lively ballad. “The Irish Rover.” And speaking of Mick Taylor, I cannot help being reminded of another postman, young Leo Carthy from Broadway, Co. Wexford, who is one of our greatest song-writers of today. Some fine compositions have come from his fluent pen, while his song, “The Rosslare Lifeboat Crew,” written in December, 1964, has become world-famous.\n\nWell, there is a feast of all kinds of songs on the western side of the Limerick-Kerry boundary From this sphere comes another rousing rebelly ballad, ” Duagh Volunteers,” and a very sentimental love song entitled “My Maid of Sweet Coolard.”\n\nAll these are fine songs, surely; songs of such a simple nature, but yet so sentimental and fascinating that they would warm the hearts of anybody. The only pity is that they are allowed fall into disuse, and that most people know so little about them. And by the way, I have only recalled a mere few of them here. Yes, those grand old folk-songs of West Limerick are in existence alright but they need to be reawakened. God grant the day when we may hear them sung again.\n\nIrish Independent 8 Feb. 1956 p16\n\nH. J. Gordon does it again. The Valley of Knockanure, One hour of tense drama. Terms £1 per performance.

STARS OF YESTERYEAR] THADY AND JIMMY O GORMAN OF KERRY\n\nThe “Up Kerry” team of 1903 Championship left a bigger mark on the character of Gaelic football than any other team in the game’s long history. This was a remarkable side—17 athletic men and every man a stylish, polished footballer. That epic series of three games against Kildare, played in 1905, set Gaelic football on a new plane The all in rough and tumble game that proceeded it was gone forever. In all four provinces, every ambitious footballer sought to copy the Kerry style\n\nThady O’Gorman, who captained the winning Kerry side in 1903 and his brother Jimmy were two typically Kerry footballers. They fielded smoothly and with confidence. They played cool collected and thoughtful football. They were stylish punters of a ball with both left and right feet. They combined with great skill. So much did this team mean to Gaelic football that the names are worth recording.\n\nKerry 1903 — T O’Gorman (capt). J O’Gorman, D Curran. Mce McCarthy. J Buckley. C Healy. A Stack. R. Fitzgerald, P Dillon. W Lynch, D McCarthy, J Myers. D Kissane. F O’Sullivan, R Kirwin, D Breen, and T Fitzgerald.\n\nThe O’Gormans were born in Tralee and learnt their football in a capable school. The brothers were very much alike in build and features. On the occasion of one of their All Ireland victories the whole Kerry team and friends went by the Lartigue train to Ballybunion for a quiet celebration. Their first\n\ncall was To the welcoming hotel of William O’Sullivan, famous sportsman and wit.\n\nTaking Thady O’Gorman by the hand, William congratulated him on his fine team that brought such honour to Kerry.\n\nThen suddenly, Willam sharply looked into Thady’s face and pulled the arm towards him “Maybe I’m making a mistake” says William. ” tell me am I talking to you or to your brother!” The rogue knew quite well, but we all laughed heartily as William wanted\n\nThe OGorman brothers were above middle height and very symmetrically built. They usually played in close company on Kerry’s half-forward line, where they had splendid support from Austin Stack and the incomparable Dick Fitzgerald of Killarney, who finished many of the O’Gorman movements for scores. The brothers had a splendid sense of direction and drove few wide’s. What impressed me most was the neatness of their footwork, and their accurate punting off a taunt instep. They won the All-Ireland title in 1903, and followed with the splendid series of 1904 which brought the Kerry side to a splendid victory over Kickhams (Dublin) selection. This game was played in Cork and Kerry won by five points to two.\n\nThe O’Gorman pair shone also in 1905 when they lost (1-7 to 0-5) to their Kildare rivals at Thurles. Like all Kerry All-Ireland men that I have studied, the O’Gorman brothers held closely to the rules — they were masters of clean football and held their tempers in good control They could play strong, vigorous football on demand.\n\nWestern People 1889-current, 12.09.1964, page 4\n\nNew Irish dance to be performed on TV entitled The Bridges of Ballina.

On Shrove Tuesday night the annual pre-Lenten dance was held at the Country Club and proved once again an outstanding success.\n\nOn last Friday night the Kerrymen joined forces with the Macroom and Uibh Laoire association, in the city in a friendly inter-association song contest, at the Country Club, At the end of a great contest the Kerrymen emerged victorious.\n\nFor Kerry Cathal O Corcora gave an outstanding performance and put his side away to a good start. Then came three songs of the modern type in which Kerry was worthily represented by Miss E. Roche. The first half concluded with a humorous selection and Frank Lyons brought, down the house to give Kerry a slight lead at this stage.\n\nThe second half opened with three songs dealing with the respective associations and Kerry’s representative Mrs, Carroll carned prolonged applause for a beautiful rendering of “The Kerry Dances.” Then we switched to light opera and Mrs Tangney was a worthy representative In this section.

Lyons brought a tear to the eyes of many a fellow Kerry man with a most spirited and appropriate rendering of the famous “Valley of Knockanure.”\n\n‘The spirit of friendship and comradeship displayed between the three associations augurs well for the future and the unanimous feeling among the spectators was that the venture proved a huge success and must be followed by many of its kind.\n\nThe teams were as follows: Kerry, Mrs. Carroll (Lixnaw); Mrs. Tangney (Farranfore); Miss E.

Collected and annotated “by Colm O Lochlainn.\n\nWith woodcuts from various sources. (Three Candles; 21/-).\n\nIRELAND in the years before the Great Famine was packed with people, full measure and pressed down and shaken together and overflowing. These teeming but deprived millions produced a vigorous popular culture before the hunger and emigration of the middle years of the nineteenth century killed or dispersed half of them. They had no access to the usual modes of expression of cultivated society—architecture, social organisation, high literature—and one of their most enduring monuments is the street-ballad, a flimsy strip of paper with a crudely-printed text and perhaps a coarse and Irrelevant woodcut as ornament. Colm O Lochlainn has long been the acknowledged leader of the movement to keep the street-ballad and its music alive and vivid.\n\nNo orthodoxy\n\nLike his earlier collections of songs in Irish and English, Colm’s latest volume is notable for his consummate taste, both as editor and publisher, and his easy scholarship. He is full of knowledge of songs and their music, and full of sympathy, too, for their singers in all ages and the society in which they flourished, but he imposes no rigid orthodoxy. Not for him the acrimonious but sterile discussion about the authenticity of the folk tradition of any particular song. Of course, he pays tribute — who does not?—to those songs which, without benefit of known author, have been refined by passage through the generations until there is in them only what is pleasing, in words and music, to the great body of the community in which they are sung. Such songs acquire special value and often special musical and literary excellences.\n\n(Break, see paper for much more)\n\nOf course, readers browsing over his latest collection will quarrel good-humouredly with him about some of the versions he gives. My version of “The Boys from the County Cork” is, I think (naturally!) better than his, containing a couplet which perhaps by its histories! inaccuracy reveals a foreign origin for the song: “For the boys who made the history of the orange white and green/ were the boys who licked the black and tans in nineteen-six teen.” And I have heard better verses of “The Valley of Knockanure”—among thousands of inferior ones.

The story of how it is being tackled was unfolded last week when I toured Kerry last week with the Team Secretary Bobby Buckley, and saw or heard of the projects and plans motion already.\n\nThe urgency of development, which I had previously known to be falling population, low incomes and lack of job opportunities, was brought to life as I sheltered with John B. Keane under a dripping thorn hedge in the Valley of Knockanure.\n\nWe had walked up the pass where Con Dee made his famous run from the Tans after they had shot his colleagues Dalton and Walsh. “A wonderful place to run in or hide in but there its value nearly ends,” commented John B. “I remember a hundred people living along that lane. Now there are 8 and only one of them is young. They succumbed in the struggle with nature. They had to fight nature every step of the way and with the old techniques nature won.”\n\nSaddest reflection\n\nThe saddest reflection on the situation is that the “eight” who remain are no better off for having more farming elbow room. No machines came in to replace the men who left and the odds were simply increased in nature’s favour. This is one of the fields in which Kerry needs economic development.\n\nUlster Herald 1901-current, Saturday, December 10, 1966; Page: 14\n\nA SPLENDID 1916 JUBILEE COMMEMORATIVE ISSUE\n\nIN THIS JUBILEE YEAR OF THE 1916 RISING INNUMERABLE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES HAVE APPEARED AND MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN OF AN EVENT AND ITS SEQUELAE STILL AFFECTING THE OUTLOOK OF EVERY CITIZEN IN THIS LAND.\n\nNOW, TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF A MEMORABLE YEAR A C.B.S. 1916-1922 C.B.S.

PADRAIG UA CEALLACHAIN, a retired national teacher, who taught Tomas MacDonogh, one of the 1916 leaders and was co-author, with Listowel author-playwright, Bryan McMahon of the ballad, “The Valley of Knockanure,” died at his home at Knockanure, North Kerry, last Saturday.\n\nBorn at Murreigh, Ballydavid, the late Mr. Ua Ceallachain was educated at Dingle CBS.. De La Salle College, Waterford and University College, Dublin. He was father of Rev. Fr. Austin Ua Ceallachain, C.C., Beaufort: and Rev. Fr. Brendan Ua Ceallachain, Nottingham and also is survived by his widow, Mrs. Bessie Ua Ceallachain: his son. Tony, N.T. Listowel: his daughter, Mrs. Maighread Scanlan, N T., Knockanure: his brother, Tomas, Dingle; daughter-in-law, Mrs. Tony Ua Ceallachain, and his son-in-law. Mr. Tony Scanlon, Knockanure.\n\nIt was while he was teacher of Irish in the Fermoy area that Tomas MacDonagh was one of his pupils. The late Mr Ua Ceallachain taught in his native Murreigh and in Kilquane before being appointed principal of Knockanure School in 1919. For a number of years he was Professor of Irish in Dingle Irish College. A pioneer in the movement for the restoration of the Irish language and an organiser of the National Volunteers, the years of Ireland’s travail were for him personally a most agonising time. Imprisonment and hunger-strike were followed on release by dismissal and imprisonment once more. He was interned in Tralee. Limerick, Harepark, Cork and Arbour Hill. He was chairman of the North Kerry Memorial Committee and under his chairmanship memorials were erected to all those who died in active service in North Kerry from 1916-’23. The funeral took place to the new cemetery, Knockanure on Sunday after Concelebrated Mass.\n\nKerryman 1904-current, Saturday, October 11, 1969; Page: 11\n\nLate Padraig O’Ceallachain, Knockanure\n\nA TRUE Gael of the old stock was laid to rest in the cemetery at Knockanure recently. Padraig O Ceallachain had answered the final rollcall and the large gathering at his graveside had come from far and near. His past pupils were there in number, his teacher-colleagues of former days and his comrades-in arms of soldiering times. Dignitaries of the Church officiated at the funeral and all had come to pay their last respects to a man they held in very high esteem.\n\nSome years after his retiring from the principal ship of Knockanure National School he went to his eternal reward. Padraig, who was a native of Dingle, was a fluent Irish speaker and his love of Ireland fired him, not alone linguistically, but prompted him to take his place with our freedom fighters of “The Troubled Times”. He spent a term behind bars for his efforts, since love of Ireland was a bad crime indeed.\n\nHe settled in Knockanure and with his wife Eilis, raised an illustrious family of priests and teachers but his influence was felt by a greater family—his pupils in whom he instilled a love of faith and homeland. Their adviser and confidant he took a fatherly pride in their achievements great and small.\n\nThese pupils are now scattered all over the globe, many labouring in Mission fields, many educating the youth of Ireland and many keeping the home-fires burning on the hillsides and in the valleys of Kerry. The love “The Master” gave his boys and girls was returned a hundredfold and justified for him his firm conviction that “A man could not wish for better than to live and die in the famed Valley of Knockanure.”\n\nAt dheis De go raibh a anam dilis. —PAST PUPIL.\n\nIrish Press 1931-1995, 03.01.1970, page 9\n\nCaint Runda na dtinceiri.\n\nSang, Valley of Knockanure, from Glimpses, History by Hugh Grant.\n\nDeath of Johnny Doran and BBC wanting to meet him, a short while earlier.\n\nJohn Wilson, met him and do not know, whether he is dead or alive.\n\nLeitrim Observer 1904-current, 20.03.1971, page 9\n\nAt a commemoration concert the Valley of Knockanure was sang by Mrs T Harte of Keadue, many other patriotic songs were sung also.\n\nIrish Press 1931-1995, Monday, October 23, 1972; Page: 7\n\nConvent band of 150 tunes\n\nBy CORMAC MAC CONNELL\n\nTHE HILLS of Kerry come alive to the sound of music when Sister Consolata of the Presentation Convent in Listowel puts her huge musical group — surely one of Ireland’s largest school bands — through their paces.\n\nSister Consolata, music teacher in the local convent school, is a Kerrywoman. All the 70-odd children are from the Listowel area. And all the songs they sing and the tunes they play are the songs and tunes of the Kingdom. The group began as one of the school’s contributions towards Bishop Casey’s “Full Life For Youth” project. Sister Consolata a native of Cahirciveen, and her pupils decided that they would collect the music of Kerry and learn to perform some of it.\n\n150 pieces\n\n“In the beginning,” said Sister Consolata, “they went home and asked their parents for the words and music of Kerry songs, ballads, and tunes. This led to them being directed to other people for more songs.\n\n“Eventually through tape recordings, and through written requests to all parts of the county, we had a collection of 150 pieces, many of them not well-known at all. We had to hand the project in for the exhibition but the songs are still coming in.”\n\nIn addition to compiling the formidable library of the Kingdom’s own music, the Listowel girls and their teacher set about forming a group to play and sing some of the pieces. By now, with a rapidly enlarging repertoire, almost 100 Listowel schoolgirls can come together and perform some of their county’s own airs.\n\n“Some of the girls already had instruments. Others were encouraged to get them. And then they began to learn some of the county’s music,” said Sr. Consolata. “We are not all that good yet, but we are rapidly improving.”\n\nRare titles\n\nThe songs collected include Bryan McMahon’s “My Silver River Feale”, beside which Sr. Consolata and her musical pupils were pictured at rehearsal recently; a little-known Dingle song “Beir Mo Dhuracht”; “The Bay of Valentia” song from South Kerry; “My Native Brosna Town”: “An Ait Ud Claodhach” from East Kerry; “My Native Sneem” (not composed by P. J. O’Brien apparently!), and a better known list of titles including “Banna Strand”, “The Rose of Tralee” and “The Valley of Knockanure”.\n\n“I’d like to emphasise,” Sr. Consolata added, “that what was collected is only the nucleus of what is there. Yes, we do hope to enlarge the collection.”\n\nAs a fitting tribute to the Listowel girls and their teachers the Muckross House Trustees have stated this week that they will publish the songs collected by them in book form.\n\nKerryman 28 July 1973, page 27\n\nConcrete City\n\nWe have Joe Ruane convinced at last, he admitted, to me after the show: “Those Kerry girls’ are dynamite!” Last year it, was Fiorenza Nolan with, “Blow ‘ The Candles Out”, now Nora Relihan with “I Am Ireland”. ‘I gave Joe the name of a Kerry girl he should Invite over for next year’s celebration.

It recalls an incident towards the end of the Irish War of Independence in which four members of the Republican Army were captured by Black and Tans in the Valley of Knockanure.\n\nWithin hours the valley and all, of North Kerry were thrown into mourning when it was learned that three of the men had been shot, dead. Captain Con Dee, of Ballylongford, though shot, in the leg. had managed to escape. Now known as the Gortaglanna Tragedy, the killings inspired the well-known ballad, The Valley of Knockanure.\n\nIt recalls the killing of Gerry Lyons. Duagh, Paddy Dalton, Athea and Paddy Walsh of Ballydonoghue. “We started the film eight months ago and drew the cast from, the village of Knockanure,” said Leo Finucane. “We decided to do it now because in five or six years’ time we mightn’t be able to find a thatched cottage. And some of the dirt roads we used have been tarred since.”” Leo, who holds a diploma in Physical Culture from the Swedish School in Dublin and is a qualified welder, returned home three years ago.

Mention Drury’s name to older folk around Knockanure, Athea or Moyvane; and you are likely to be greeted with a smiling face and a little laugh of pleasure. The memory of the man, who died over 40 years ago, is still treasured in these parts as his unique caustic rhymes entertained generations.\n\nThe sad thing is that most of his material has been lost. The man was only semi-literate and never wrote his material down so he has rarely been written about.\n\nJohn Moloney knew him intimately and passed on some of Drury’s memorable material. Christine Sweeney and Patsy Lynch of the Bog Lane, Knockanure, and Kate Fltzmaurice of Coilagurteen, recall some of his rhymes.\n\nDrury’s answer to the nagging women and the Holy Joes of his time in Knockanure was:\n\n“Knockanure both mane and poor A Church without a steeple And bitches and hoors Hanging out of half doors Criticising the dacent people.”\n\nHe is well remembered in Knockanure for that piece and more. To this day, incidentally, the Church in Knockanure has no steeple. The village’s modern structure was built in 1962 with a flat roof.\n\nOne of the best known legends about Drury is that when stopped by the Black and Tans coming from the railway station in Listowel with barrels of porter for his employer, Morgan Sheehy, he answered in rhyme:\n\n“My name is Paddy Drury I come from the boggy lane I am employed by Morgan Sheehy Drawing porter from the train.”\n\nHe was employed by Morgan Sheehy, a liquor retailer, for many years and on another occasion while coming down William Street with his ass and cart the Tans asked him in a Jeering manner where he was going with the ass. He replied: “I am taking him to Join the British Army,”. When working for a farmer he was so exasperated at getting the tail end of the meat, mostly fat and gristle, he said in the presence of the farmer, his wife and a servant girl, lifting his eyes to Heaven:’\n\n“Oh Lord on high who rules the sky Look down upon us four And give us mate that we\n\ncan ate, And take away the boar.”\n\nAnd when faced with working with another mean and tight farmer’s wife who was very loath to put meat on the table, as fish was cheaper and easier to get, he commented on a plate full of two pints of gravy and a tiny piece of fish that he was not eating as he was waiting for the tide to go out.\n\nHis comments on Abbeyfeale, Ballygologue, Listowel and Cahirmee are summed up in these lines:-“Abbeyfeale for flour and male Cahiramee for horses Ballygologue for thieves and rogues And Listowel for kiss me arses.”\n\nA reporter, living in Listowel, used to Jibe at Drury in his column and the man’s answer to him was:\n\n“There is a man lives in this town He’d sell his soul for porter Sullivan John he is that man, A dirty mane reporter.”\n\nDrury was a short, stocky man with smiling eyes and bushy eyebrows. He spent most of his life working as a farm-hand and he dressed carelessly. He was fond of porter.\n\nHe was beloved in the Athea area and when he lived in a council house he is alleged never to have paid any rent. Apparently Government orders and rents didn’t mean much to him. He was a free soul.\n\nHe was born in the latter part of the 19th century but by the time he died about 40 years ago his fame had spread as far as New York where Listowel man, Freddy Hassett of Bridge Road was fond of reciting his rhymes in a pub in the Bronx.\n\nAccording to those who remember him, he was full of devilment and he was loved for it. He never went to school and all his rhymes came straight out of his head.\n\nThey are best recorded in the colloquial idiom of North Kerry but the sad fact is that most of his songs and poems are lost forever. He is credited with the version of the song “The Valley of Knockanure” recorded by the Wolfe Tones and one verse of this shows the genius of a man who was only semiliterate.\n\n“In Gortaglanna’s lonely glen, Three gallant men took shade And in the soft young summer wheat The gentle breezes played.”\n\n© Additional material for this article supplied by Sean McCarthy of Finuge.\n\nAnglo-Celt 1846-current, Thursday, December 29, 1988; Page: 10\n\nCHRISTMAS IN LONDON (By: Maureen O Dwyer) (See Paper for full article)\n\nTORE AT MY HEART\n\nI went to Midnight Mass on Christmas Eve as I would be working on Christmas Day, every one of those hymns tore at my heart, recalling the choir practices I had done back home with Mrs, Meachan over the years, I wondered what Santa Claus would bring to my nine younger brothers and sisters that night or if they had got the few toys which I had sent earlier. The little bedsitter which I had rented in Stockwell was owned by a Polish landlord he was a very honest man who had escaped from Warsaw just before the end of the war with his brother and had never been able to return there again, he came with gifts for all his tenants on Christmas Eve and wished us all a merry Christmas. I found it very unusual to hear everyone wish a merry Christmas instead of a happy Christmas. Most of the tenants in the house were Irish or Scottish, one particular Kerry man used to sing the ‘Valley of Knockanure” all through the Christmas holiday. The Banshee cried when young Dalton died, in the Valley of Knockanure.

Listowel.\n\nThe return match between the Tralee and Listowel Lawn Tennis Clubs took place on the Tralee grounds on Friday last, when the home team defeated their opponents with comparative ease by eight events to one. As the Listowel team won the first match on its own ground, it is to be hoped that a deciding contest, may be arranged before the end of the season. On Friday the weather was most unpropitious, but the meeting was both spirited and enjoyable. Mrs. Johnston, entertained the members of the club and their guests at tea, and the afternoon, was further enlivened by the strains of the Kerry Militia Band, which was greatly appreciated. This unexpected and most pleasant departure will, we trust, by the courtesy of Viscount Castlerosse and officers of the Militia, be renewed on many an occasion, for we do not often hear a military band at Tralee. At 7.30 the visitors were entertained at dinner at Benner’s Hotel by the Tralee Club, and it is much to Mrs. Benner’s credit, in catering for the party, that at such short notice a most excellently served, and sumptuous repast was provided for the guests, numbering 40. .Mr F M’G. Denny proposed the health of the Listowel Club in a very excellent speech, which was equally well responded to by Mr F Creagh, (the secretary). Mr Creagh then proposed the health of the Tralee secretary (Colonel Johnston), and shortly afterwards the party adjourned to the commodious ball-room, and danced till the small hours, thus ending a most enjoyable evening. The following are the scores: Gentlemen’s Singles. Captain Boger (T) beat J Creagh (L), 6-3, 6—2.\n\nR White (T) beat J Hughes (L), 6—2, 6-4.; A Bent (T) beat C French (L), 6—3 ,6—2.\n\nGentlemen’s Doubles. Capt.

At a meeting of the County Board, Mr J Moynihan, Vice-President. presided. The other members present were—Messrs Maurice Moynihan, and T Slattery, Tralee ; J M’Quinn , and J Clifford, Ballymacelligott; J P Sullivan Firies ; J Brosnan, lrremore. The first business disposed of was the consideration of an objection lodged on behalf of Firies against the referee’s decision in awarding the matches, Portmagee v Firies, to the former team. It was decided to uphold the referees decision. Mr .J P O’Sullivan dissenting. The Ballymacelligott second team objected to the match played between themselves and Valentia being awarded to, the latter team on various grounds, the principal of which was the unfair constitution of the Valentia team. It was alleged that a member of the Caherciveen team played with Valentia, and on the suggestion of Mr Moynihan, it was decided to adjourn the consideration of, the matter pending a statement from the referee, Mr M McGillycuddy, as to whether the Valentia team was illegally constituted. An objection was lodged by Listowel against lrremore. Mr T F O’Sullivan, S Dalton and T Somers, appeared in support of the objection.\n\nEvidence having been heard, it was decided to uphold the decision of the referee, and to suspend Simon Seward, one of the lrremore players , who, it is alleged, attacked Devereux, captain of the Listowel team, with a stick. The suspension was made subject to the identification of Seward as his-aggressor by Devereux.\n\nOn the proposition of Mr Moynihan, seconded by Mr J P Sullivan, it was decided to co-opt Mr O’Sullivan, Listowel, a member of the County Board. The meeting adjourned to the 24th inst, when further matches in connection with the county championship will be arranged.\n\nKerry Weekly Reporter 1883-1920, Saturday, September 03, 1898; Page: 5\n\nDIED.

I trust that Tralee will keep up the most enviable reputation for prowess in this admirable game, which her sons have already gained for her in the world’s arena-; and I hope that your new court will be the nursery of many a champion in the years to come.—Faithfully yours, ” JOHN McGILLYCUDDY. ”\n\n“Mr Michael Jones, Secretary, Tralee Handball Court, Tralee.”\n\nKerry Weekly Reporter 1883-1920, Saturday, August 19, 1899; Page: 3\n\nDear Sir—I am not surprised that the generous offer of Captain McGillycuddy in aid of a town hall for Tralee, has been enthusiastically taken up, but I regret to be forced to the conclusion that the-munificent gift has been to my mind misdirected. The reading of the report of the meeting held in the Concert Hall clearly proves this. The speakers were all loud in their praises of Captain MacGillycuddy; but, notwithstanding his princely generosity, even if they got the opportunity would not have him on any of their boards. One of the speakers objected to Government buildings, so full was he of bubbling patriotism. I noticed with satisfaction that the ratepayers of the town were absent from this meeting, thereby proving that like myself they did not want to tax themselves for a building that would be likely to be controlled by people of the narrow-minded, intolerant type, who are in Tralee seeking to control everything.\n\nThe County Council-would be acting very wrongly if they encouraged the expenditure of the rates for such a purpose. The respectable ratepayers would be ignored and the red-hot patriots would have the place all to themselves. If a hall is to be built, let it be built by a company as you suggested in your last,- and then there would be some guarantee that a narrow-minded clique would not control and render it worthless. —Your truly, OBSERVER.\n\nKerry Weekly Reporter 1883-1920, Saturday, October 21, 1899; Page: 3\n\nTHE OBSEQUIES OF THE LATE SISTER MARY MERCY.\n\nThe obsequies of the late Sister Mary Mercy took place at the Mercy Convent, Balloonagh, on Wednesday mornings Solemn requiem High Mass was celebrated in the Convent Chapel at 10-30 a.m., the celebrant being the Rev F McDonnell , Adm, Tralee; deacon , Rev Fr T Griffin, C C T, Tralee; sub deacon Rev Fr D Murphy, C C, Tralee; and master of ceremonies, Rev Fr J Buckley, B D , President Intermediate Schools, Tralee.

He invented the flashing, system of signals known as the ” Morse,” and devised a system of steam tactics, both of which are in use to this day. He also invented the system—the only existing alternative o which electricity—of the internal lighting of war ships.

However, that demand was afterwards reduced to .25d. in the £. Mr. McCowen represented the deputation on the occasion, and put forward a very lucid statement, and, as he (chairman) thought, a very convincing one. He (Mr Trench) then explained what had happened at the County Council meeting, a report of which had already been published. Their (society) first impression was that, the decision of the County Council , that they get no grant, would be fatal to the holding of the show that year. They would have to decide that day whether they would hold a show entirely dependent on voluntary subscriptions.\n\nAfter some discussion, it was decided to’ hold that show this year on the 2nd and 3rd August.\n\nMr Watson asked was it a fact that Captain Magill was getting £75 a year from the society?\n\nThe Chairman said that Captain Magill had not got a penny for the last four years—not even to pay his expenses, and he thought it should be publicly known.\n\nAfter some discussion Mr Watson was appointed assistant secrteary in room of Captain McGillycuddy.\n\nKillarney Echo and South Kerry Chronicle 1899-1920, Saturday, January 05, 1901; Page: 2\n\nTHE SOLICITOR TO THE COUNCIL. Dear Sir: I see in a Tralee paper a very long and somewhat involved letter from The McGillycuddy on this subject. So far as any one may gather any meaning from it, I take it that the letter means that The McGillycuddy, as a Nationalist is trying to guide the Nationalists in the County Council in the straight path. I don’t propose to enter into the controversy at all, but I do propose to emphatically object to The McGillycuddy, whom your paper showed up some time ago cheering the Queen and the British generals in a certain gathering at Trinity College, posing as a Nationalist. Let The McGillycuddy recommend the candidate of his choice to his brother landlords and loyalists on the County Council, and then he will be on firmer ground. Perhaps, however, he has done so already. -Faithfully yours, PADDY FROM THE REEKS.\n\nKerry Weekly Reporter, 7 Sept. 1901\n\nA TRADES AND LABOUR FEDEBATION AT TRALEE\n\nA meeting of trades and labour bodies was held on Friday evening at Mr John O’Connor’s, Castle street, for the purpose of forming the above.

Mr. McGillycuddy was the third son of Richard McGillycuddy of the Reeks, and Anna, daughter of Captain John Johnstone, of Mainstone Court, Herefordshire, and was representative of the oldest stock both in Ireland and England. On his father’s side his descent traces directly back to the Kings of Munster and to Milesius. While his maternal pedigree- connected him to Robert the Bruce of Scotland on the one side, and to Alfred the Great of Saxon England on the other. He was educated at Marlborough and later at Trinity College, Dublin, where he studied law, and was subsequently called to the Irish Bar. During his University career, he represented Ireland in the first International Rugby Football match against England. In the early eighties he went to Canada, where he acted as Secretary to the Arts Association of Montreal for several years. He married in 1890. Emlly daughter of R. S. Hudson. Esq of Bache Hall, Cheshire, and resided at Aghadoe House, Killarney. During this period he twice contested the East Kerry Division in the Unionist Interest. He filled the office of High Sheriff, was a Justice of the Peace, and one of His Majesty’s Deputy Lieutenants for the county. He joined the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers in 1893, but retired in 1909. He re-joined in 1914. and served with the Battalion at Cork and Aghada during the war. The last ten years of his life were spent at Flesk Castle.\n\nMajor MacGillycuddy was essentially Kerry; he lived in and for the county, and devoted his life to the welfare of its people. He took a deep interest in every form of social betterment and was untiring in his efforts to forward any charitable movement which was brought to his notice. His last days were concerned with the inception of a pension fund for the Jubilee nurses, and his illness was clouded by the thought that he would be unable to bring the project to a final and satisfactory conclusion. His unobtrusive kindnesses were without number, and many are the homes in Kerry which have tided over a difficult day with his help and sympathy. A good friend, a delightful, well-bred and cultured companion, and a courteous gentleman, he will be sadly missed as an example of what the best type of Irishman should be. He is succeeded by his only son, Anthony John MacGillycuddy.\n\nCORBETT.\n\nCorbett Surgeon Dentist March 1874; Mr William Cochrane Corbett will visit Tralee Professionally on second Monday and Tuesday of each month, at 27 Denny Street also at 11 Morrison’s Quay Cork.\n\nKerry News 30 Aug. 1912;\n\nDeath of young girl Barbara Mulally, Boherbee\n\nChief mourners, Mr Michael Mulally (Father); Mrs Mulally, Sarah, Josephine and Michael.

CLONMEL ASSIZES—FRIDAY, Aug. 28.\n\nFrom the Tipperary Free press\n\nThe King v. Pierse.\n\nWilliam Henry Pierse was indicted for the murder of Paul Slattery on the 8th of July last, at Carrick on-Suir. This case excited very great interest in consequence of the defendant being a chief constable of police, and because the Crown allowed the friends of the deceased to select their own Counsel, and to conduct the prosecution. Mr. Sheil, as leading Counsel, directed that a mixed jury of respectable Protestants and Catholics should, if possible, try the case ; and accordingly the challenges of the Crown were directed with that view, and a jury composed of seven Catholics and five Protestants, were sworn. The following gentlemen composed the jury;—William Lonergan, Robert Shaw, jun., Hugh Lloyd, Wm. O’Neill. James H. Shee, John Lonergan, Sam. Bradshaw, John Chaytor, Clement Carroll, John Dunphy, Patrick Corcoran, and William Henry Car, Esqrs.\n\nMr. Sheil, after the jury were sworn, stated the case for the prosecution. He said—I am Counsel in a case which the gentlemen to whom the Attorney-General habitually confides the enforcement of the law, have permitted me at the instance of the persons interested in the prosecution to conduct. I trust that I shall not abuse the license which has been accorded to me. I feel that I am invested with a triple trust—the first is, that which I owe to my client, for whom I do not come to demand vengeance, but that retribution for which the instincts of nature make in the bosom of a parent their strong and almost sacred call. My client is the mother of the poor boy, for whose death the prisoner at the bar stands arraigned before you. I owe the next duty to Mr. Pierse himself. If I be asked in what particular I am bound to him, I answer, that I cannot avoid entertaining for him that sentiment of commiseration, which every well-minded man will extend to one who may be wholly innocent of a crime, the imputation of which, in itself, is a species of misfortune ; and I do assure (he will permit me, I hope, to extend the assurance to himself) that it is with an emotion of melancholy sympathy, that at this moment I raise my eyes, and see him occupying a place where guilt and misery are accustomed to take their stand. To him I owe it as an obligation, that I should not abuse the advantage which I possess, as counsel for the prosecution, of delivering a statement against a prisoner, to which his own advocates cannot make a reply. The scriptural inculcation inscribed above that seat of justice admonishes me that I ought not to make any appeal to your passions or prejudices against a man whose mouth is closed, and to whose counsel the right of speaking is, by an equally cruel and fantastic anomaly, refused. ” Aperios tuum muto” is written therein golden characters, not only to suggest to your lordship a duty of judicial interposition on behalf of the silent, but also to warn the advocate not to avail himself in any merciless spirit of his forensic prerogation against the man to whom the privilege of speech is denied, and whom the law has stricken dumb. But it is not only towards my client, and towards the prisoner that I have this double, but not incompatible duty to perform. The trust which is reposed in me extends to the public; and I owe it to that common interest in which we are every one of us concerned, in a case where a guardian of-the peace is accused of its unwarrantable violation, to enforce as far as it lies in me a strict, but. at the same time, a calm and unimpassioned assertion of the law, taking care that while I do so, I should not be instrumental in making a baneful augmentation to that excitement which unhappily prevails in this county, and that I should not culpably administer to those vehement feelings, which have so strongly and so disastrously possessed themselves of the public mind ; the fountains of justice should not be made contributory to that deep current of popular passion which rolls with as turbid, although I trust that I may add, with as transitory a force as those waters, which, in this inauspicious season, descend from the elevations that surround your town, and swell the stream on which it is situated beyond its ordinary useful channels. Let me be permitted to pursue the illustration, and to express a confidence, that as the torrent of popular emotion does not flow from any deep and lasting source, but owes its increase to temporary circumstances, it will not be permanently disastrous, and will speedily subside. Gentlemen of the jury, it is right that in every outset of this case I should do an act of justice to Mr. Pierse. I shall make it superfluous upon the part of his counsel to produce evidence in favour of his character. He is a man of worth and honour, and until the fatal event for which he stands indicted, has enjoyed a reputation for peculiar kindness of heart. I think it also right to add, that the police who were stationed in Carrick-on-Suir in his district were exceedingly popular; that a perfect amity exists between them and the people; and that they are looked upon by the latter as their natural and legitimate protectors. This fact is the more valuable because it proves that by wise and salutary arrangements, by proper selection of individuals, and above all, by avoiding an infusion of party into the constabulary force, it may be rendered substantially efficient, and that a reconciliation between the people and the police may be readily effected; I have thus much conceded to the prisoner at the bar as a man of merit; it is therefore-the more to be lamented that in an instant, pregnant with fatality, and, as I am instructed, without provocation, he should have been the occasion of death to an innocent and unoffending boy, and thus committed a deviation from his general habits, which, from the authority of his example, is calculated to be extremely pernicious. The disastrous event in which Mr. Pierse had the misfortune to bear so huge a part, took place on the 8th of June last in the town of Carrick-on-Suir. On that day a division of the 65th regiment marched into the town, the 76th regiment were quartered there, some of the soldiers of both regiments met in a tavern. The question which has agitated the parliament and the palace, but which I scarcely thought would have found its way into the canteen was brought into discussion, and the merits of Catholic emancipation went through a process of military review. The statesmen of the 65th regiment differed from their competitors of the 76th regiment, one regiment having adopted the present, and the latter still adhering with an insubordinate pertinacity to the former opinions of the Duke of Wellington.— You will readily anticipate the figure in logic to which, these dialecticians resorted. The controversy assumed, a form which entitles it, in the strict sense of the (Check Paper for full report)\n\nKerry Evening Post 1813-1917, Saturday, January 12, 1833; Page: 3\n\nLimerick Political Union. Monday\n\nJeremiah O’Sullivan, Esq. In the Chair. Mr, T.F. Mahony regretted that their Secretary was so indisposed, that he Was unable to attend ; and he therefore requested Mr. P. Goulding would be good enough to act for him, to which Mr. Goulding instantly assented.\n\nThe Rev Mr. Braham then addressed the Chair, to state that he had been favoured with a letter from the Rev. Mr. Coll, conveying his acknowledgments to the Union for the vote of thanks passed to his friend the evening he. (Mr. B) had the honour of presiding in that Chair.\n\nMr. T. F. Mahony said, that they all recollected that on the last evening of meeting, the standing order had been suspended, for the purpose of carrying without delay a resolution appointing a deputation to wait upon Mr Richard Kenny, the Stamp Distributor, to request that he would say whether the report was true or false, that he distrained his tenants because they in the exercise of their constitutional rights and privileges, thought it to vote contrary to his wishes at the late election. (Here Mr. Mahony produced a paper, at the time requesting the Reporter to be very accurate in taking down the contents, as it involved a subject of great importance.) After receiving the deputation with great courtesy, Mr. Kenny said “he was happy in having the opportunity of repelling that charge, and of vindicating the character, and that it was not the only false report circulated against him for it had been lately said that he had Received a thousand pounds from Pierce Mahony, for his support which, if necessary, both he and Mr. M., could prove on oath to be a falsehood. Mr. K. then spoke of-his obligations to Mr. Rice, and his friendship to that Gentleman; -that he (Mr K ) was Provost in Ennis, when Mr. Rice induced him to come to Limerick and accept of the the office he now holds. He then alluded to the part, he took with the Citizens in the struggle for independence, and of his having thereby! forfeited the friendship of Lord Gort and the Corporation.— After some further conversation he stated that when Mr Mahony had come to seek the representation of this City he promised him his support as a schoolfellow and an old friend but would not dispose of his votes until Mr. Rice was retuned for Cambridge.— About this time he had a communication from Lord Hill and was waited on by his wife’s uncle, Captain Browne, both soliciting his vote and interest, for the nephew of Lord Gort- but he (Mr. K ) replied, that having been one of those instrumental in establishing the independence of Limerick, he could never think of supporting-a Corporation Candidate. When Mr. Rice was returned for Cambridge, he (Mr. K.) then promised Mr. Mahony his votes, and it Was after that he met in the shop of Mr. Clarke, confectioner, with Mr, Vokes Chief Magistrate of Police, who told him that Mr. M. Barrington, Crown Solicitor, was about to offer himself for the City, and that Mr. B. was going to Dublin to meet Mr. Stanley, with whom he was going to dine at the Castle; and .that as Mr. Barrington was to be the Government Candidate, he (Mr. K) had no business but to give him every support, or else his situation under government Would be endangered. Mr. Kenny replied, that he would support Mr, William Roche and Mr. Mahony, that he was particularly pledged to the latter, and Would keep his, word at any hazard.—When Mr. Mohony declined the contest: he (Mr. K,) met by invitation, Mr Samuel Dickson, at the house of Mr. Boyse, and promised to support him, but on the second day, of the election, finding Mr. Dickson had no chance of success, he, with other friends advised Mr, D, to give up agitating the City, and accordingly he (Mr. K.) took Mr. Dickson’s resignation to the Chronicle office in the meantime Mr, Vokes called on Mr. K. and showed him a letter, he had received from Government ordering him not to support Mr David Roche, or any Repealer, but to be sure, to support, as far as lay in his power, Mr. Vereker, the Corporation Candidate. (Here Mr. _Mahony asked Mr. Kenny did he read the letter—had-he that letter in his hands.) Mr. Kenny said, to be sure I had it in my hands: was it not abroad therein my own parlour, read it ? and now what would you have me to do; don’t you see my situation was at stake.\n\nOur space will not allow us to go into, the lengthened defence Mr. Mahony entered into to shew that the chages brought against Mr- K. were unfounded and he further regretted that this explanation could not have accompanied the observation recently made respecting these reports.\n\nIn the meantime, it was moved by, Mr. James O’Neil, that the statement now read be inserted on the minutes of the Union. Thanks’ having been returned to Mr.O’Sullivan, the Union adjourned—Limerick Evening Post.\n\nFreemans Journal 1763-1924, Friday, August 02, 1833; Page: 4\n\nPOLICE.
