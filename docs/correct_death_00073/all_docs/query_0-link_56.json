The present list is published to meet the demand of the many library patrons living in outlying districts, who are not able to consult the catalogues in the Central Library- To anticipate possible surprise at the exclusion of important works, it must be understood that in order to make the list workable and especially to make a \"live\" list, it was found necessary to confine its scope to definite limits. The period since the intro- duction of the first Home Rule Bill may be regarded as covering the important recent development of Ireland, in its political and economic aspects, and, above all, its literary revival. Modern works, however, on older history, art, and literature, are included; but for earlier books the catalogue in Bates Hall must be consulted. All books in the list having shelf-numbers beginning with letters, as \"A.\", \"Cab.\", are restricted to use within the building; and on account of the difficulty of procuring some of these publications, it becomes imperative to restrict many more books than is customary. Since among these are numerous works of historical fiction, it is well to emphasize the fact that when books are so restricted to \"Hall Use\" it will be impossible to make excep- tions in issuing them for use elsewhere. The list was prepared by Mr. Lucien E. Taylor, of the Cata- logue Department. A List of Books Relating to Ireland Since the First Home Rule Bill GENERAL WORKS. Barker, Ernest.
