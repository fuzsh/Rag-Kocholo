        "text": "I’m over half way through Trinity College Dublin’s 6-week online course on Irish history called “Irish Lives:1912-1923”. It is not part of any degree but being free and having 17,000 participants it sounded intriguing. I learned about it a week after it started so I’m still wading through Week 4 as this week 5 ends.\n\nI wasn’t sure I needed a third history project to go with my study into an Australian Treaty with its Indigenous People, and a biography of Irish-Australian James Dalton. The Treaty is something I’ve come to believe in while Dalton had an amazing life surviving orphanhood in the Irish famine before arriving in gold rush Australia and ending up one of the wealthiest and most influential Catholics in New South Wales. I thought the Trinity course might offer perspectives on Dalton because his son-in-law John Redmond was so important in Ireland from 1912 to his death in 1918. A Wexford man, he represented New Ross in parliament before moving to Waterford. Brother Willy later became MP for Wexford and he was the only MP to be killed in action in the First World War.\n\nJohn and Willy’s 1883 visit to Australia brought the Dalton and Redmond families together. Dalton was Redmond’s biggest supporter in Australia and paid a heavy price, losing a magistrate position over claims of treason. The Redmonds repaid their support in kind. John married Dalton’s half sister Johanna, Willy married Dalton’s daughter Eleanor. I wondered if Redmond’s Australian family influenced his thinking as he took thousands of Irish to war in 1914.\n\nI am enjoying Irish Lives immensely, despite playing catch up. The video lectures make us think about individual motivation and there is much digitised primary material to study. The Bureau of Military History is full of great stories from the era. I’ve really enjoyed Muriel MacSwiney (Terence’s widow on how she got into politics through nationalist newspapers and the conviviality of a Cork bookshop), Ned Broy (on the organisation of the DMP and the looting during the 1916 Rising) and some Waterford ones John Riordan and Paddy Paul who both fought continuously in wars from 1914 to 1923 (both ending up as Free Staters).\n\nPaddy Paul followed the wishes of his local MP. When John Redmond said they should go to England’s war for Ireland he went to that war. Paul was in an Irish regiment in Macedonia during Easter 1916 and Ireland’s Rising was never far from their minds. All the men openly cheered for good news from the rebels, who fought against the army they were serving in. Most of the Irish soldiers abroad joined the Volunteers in 1919. By then Redmond was dead and his dream of Home Rule dashed. Paul came back to fight the British in Waterford.\n\nThere was a second semi-related reason I took on Irish Lives. I hoped the 1912-1923 period in Ireland might also inform my thinking about treaties in Australia. Most people in Ireland accepted the Treaty process was legitimate even though they were split by the outcome. The most interesting thing I’ve found is the full text of Robert Brennan’s book “Allegiance”. Brennan was an important Sinn Feiner and undersecretary for foreign affairs 1921-1922 as well as being the fledgling regime’s publicity officer.\n\nBrennan reminded me of another Irish Treaty, The 1691 Treaty of Limerick, that confirmed Protestant rule in Ireland. Brennan quotes Erskine Childers saying the Irish underestimated the British who always found ways “to repudiate their signatures”.\n\nBrennan also speaks of a meeting he had with Eamon De Valera and Michael Collins in 1921 as Ireland and Britain looked for a way out of the war. Brennan said a man wanted to meet them, believed to be British spy, Tom Jones. Brennan told De Valera and Collins that Jones said he knew people in London who could bring a settlement. Collins replied eagerly that they should meet him and find out his game. De Valera said no, he didn’t want to meet a spy. Instead he told Brennan to give Jones a message.”The British should offer to negotiate a Treaty with Ireland as a separate state. We can meet on this ground”.\n\n“Meet on this ground”. So Dev, so devious, so delicious. De Valera wanted to meet as equals, a respect the British rarely accorded the Irish. Nor could British acolytes in Australia offer that respect either. John Redmond had suffered great abuse from the press when he visited Australia back in 1883. Redmond told Australia he wanted what the Australian colonies already had: a home parliament within the empire. The newspapers would have none of it. Australia was too far away and rule from London was impractical. Ireland on the other hand, the Brisbane Courier said, “was an integral part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain”. It was preposterous, the paper said, “to suppose any Englishman loyal to his country can sanction the disintegration involved in any national Home Rule for Ireland.”\n\nBritain was at the height of her imperial powers in the 1880s and Australia wanted reflected glory as a Little Britain of the South Seas, Its humble beginnings as a prison colony among a native of “savages” was deliberately forgotten in this new narrative. White colonists ruled by the gun and never had to treat with the Indigenous people it encountered in Australia. By the time of the events of Irish Lives, the colonies had come together in a white federation. The Aboriginal people were written out of the young nation’s constitution, forgotten and expected to die off.\n\nThough things have improved, Australia has never offered to treat Indigenous people for its thefts. They need to do as the English did with De Valera, negotiate as a state and “meet on this ground”.\n\n(Photo of de Valera with Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies in London, 1941.

He was influential on both sides of the border, a thorn in the British side for most of that time and also had a massive impact on American affairs between 1918 and 1945. Ireland was such a pain to White House administrations, the country was eventually punished for war neutrality by being left out of the Marshall Plan that revitalised allies and enemies alike.\n\nBy the late 1950s de Valera’s economy naivete had landed the Irish economy in deep trouble. By then he was an almost totally blind caricature of the remote and exotic president of the Irish Republic he helped create and shape in his deeply religious image. Yet he clung onto power until 1959 when aged 76 he was forcibly retired upstairs as president in “the Park”. There in a supposed ceremonial role, he wielded enormous influence for 14 more years in two terms. He died in 1975 aged 92.\n\nFor one day short of 65 years he was married to Sinead de Valera who predeceased him by three months. Sinead brought up a large family by herself and held enormous power over her husband. They met through mutual love of the Irish language and Gaelic was their lingua franca. De Valera’s surviving letters to Sinead in English sent from overseas show a passion he kept mostly hidden.\n\nEamon de Valera owed his astonishing longevity of power to a combination of luck, charm, ruthlessness and bastardry. His Irish mother Cate Coll sent her Brooklyn-born boy to Ireland after his lothario father, Spanish artist Vivion de Valero, left them. Cate’s son grew up in Bruree, County Limerick, steeped in Irish culture fused with a British-style education. De Valera became Irish to his bootstraps, changing his birthname George to the Irish Eamon but he used his American birthplace to great effect.\n\nGifted in mathematics and strikingly tall, he won a scholarship to one of Ireland’s premier schools, Blackrock College. His leadership qualities stood out and he was a natural captain of the rugby team. He also forged lifelong alliances with important Catholic prelates who later ruled the country with their croziers as he would with his political cunning.\n\nAn avid student of Machiavelli and deeply Catholic, he grappled with changing Irish political conditions. Queen Victoria was dead and although the Irish respected the monarchy there was a desire for change. As the home rule movement grew in the south, a Loyalist force in the north grew in opposition. The Loyalists had the support of the British Army top brass and the Conservative Party and grew in belligerence and strength as the first decade of the 20th century ended. “Ulster will fight and Ulster will be right,” was the battlecry.\n\nThe cries reached fever-pitch when Westminster declared home rule for Ireland in 1912. As the north armed with impunity, the South reacted to defend a Dublin Parliament. De Valera joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913. The First World War broke out a year later putting arguments on hold. The Irish on both sides signed up in large numbers to fight for the Empire in Flanders and Gallipoli.\n\nDe Valera did not put on a uniform. With the Volunteers falling under the influence of the Irish Republican Brotherhood secret society, a split began and de Valera joined the side pushing for aggression. De Valera rose quickly through the ranks and though suspicious of the IRB, he approved of an uprising in Easter 1916. De Valera was not one of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of Independence but was a key military leader and one of the last to surrender when the Easter Rising failed.\n\nBecause he was among the later captives, he was held in a different jail to where the other leaders were summarily executed. The Irish Independent newspaper bayed for blood and De Valera was sure he was next. By the time of his court martial, the revulsion at 15 executions in nine days swung public opinion against the policy. His American roots and humble “school-master” occupation saved him and he was jailed in Dublin and then in Britain. At Dartmoor he was greeted by the Irish as their “Chief” and most senior rebel to survive the Rising.\n\nHis rival, organisational supremo Michael Collins, was determined not to repeat the open warfare tactics of 1916. De Valera wanted political status and within a year the British Government released all the Irish prisoners. They went home and organised politically as Sinn Fein. With the First World War going badly and Britain considering conscription in Ireland, Sinn Fein won most Irish seats in the 1918 Westminster election. De Valera was elected member for Clare.\n\nThe British became convinced Sinn Fein were in league with Germany and swooped against its leaders in May 1918. Collins’ spy network had advance warning but most leaders including De Valera ignored it and were arrested. De Valera was sent to Lincoln Prison while Collins began asymmetric war against Britain.\n\nCollins’ biggest coup was springing de Valera from Lincoln Prison. He spirited De Valera back to Ireland where the pair argued about tactics. Dev’s primary value was as a propaganda weapon and he was smuggled to America where the “First Minister” spent 18 months on a fundraising campaign.\n\nIrish Americans treated him as a hero and his title was inflated to President of Ireland. But he blundered in US politics. He supported the isolationists because President Wilson would not recognise Ireland as a participant in the Versailles Peace Conference. He split Irish-Americans by not realising they were Americans first and Irish second. Yet he raised large amounts of money and valuable publicity as the war raged in Ireland.\n\nWhen de Valera came home both sides were wearied into stalemate. Protestants used the chaos of the south to form their own northern administration. Partition of Ireland was first mooted in 1912 by Liberal Unionist T.G.R. Agar-Robartes but its time had now come. In 1921 a new parliament in Belfast was given the blessing of George V.\n\nIn his speech the King appealed for “forbearance and conciliation” in the South. De Valera went to London to meet Prime Minister Lloyd George. They discussed a peace treaty possible only because de Valera gave defacto approval to partition. But he knew the Irish would have difficulty accepting this position. He deliberately stayed at home for the treaty discussions which Collins led with full plenipotentiary powers.\n\nCollins knew the compromise on offer. In December 1921 he signed a Treaty with Lloyd George that confirmed the existence of Northern Ireland and a new parliament in Dublin with wide powers but an oath of allegiance to the crown. Collins called it the “freedom to achieve freedom”. At the signing ceremony British Minister Lord Birkenhead told Collins he (Birkenhead) may have signed his political death warrant. “I may have signed my actual one,” Collins replied prophetically.\n\nWith Collins and his network exposed, a return to war against Britain would have been doomed to failure. De Valera was livid with Collins for signing the Treaty to create the Irish Free State. Arguments raged over the Oath while the more substantive matter of partition was ignored. The IRA rejected the treaty while the Church, the newspapers and most of the population wanted peace. De Valera refused to see it as a stepping stone and lent his considerable weight to those against it.\n\nWhen the Treaty was narrowly carried in the Dail, de Valera resigned as President and offered himself as the leader of the “true Republic”. Within months Dublin was ablaze again in civil war. The war was hopeless with Republican idealists no match for British artillery in the hands of Collins’ new army. Collins was assassinated in County Cork by a sniper’s bullet while De Valera hid near by.\n\nDe Valera never admitted he was wrong but when he indicated the struggle was unwinnable it quickly ended. Another year in jail made him realise he could not win by revolutionary means. He renounced the IRA and Sinn Fein and set up Fianna Fail “the soldiers of destiny”.\n\nHe took the Oath in 1927 and entered parliament with his new party. Fianna Fail established itself quickly as a force. Remembering the lesson of the Irish Independent, de Valera went to the States again on another fundraising mission. On his return he created a new newspaper, the Irish Press.\n\nWith the power of his name and his new propaganda machine, he was able to form government in 1932. Bitter enemies peacefully handed over power though fascist movements like the Blue Shirts were less accommodating. De Valera ruthlessly dealt with them and later destroyed the IRA. He used Collins’ stepping stone approach he hated so much in 1921 to remove the Crown from Irish affairs.\n\nAt the peak of his powers, De Valera was Prime Minister (Taoiseach) and Foreign Minister, ably representing the “Irish Free State” at League of Nation conferences. De Valera used the constitutional crisis in England over the abdication of Edward VIII to give Ireland a new constitution in 1937. It stamped Ireland as a Catholic nation and formally claimed the North as part of Ireland. But like China over Taiwan, this was a fight Dev never wanted to win, he just wanted to keep it going.\n\nIn the 1930s he declared an Economic War with Britain refusing to pay land annuities to buy out absentee landlords. It lasted six years crippling the Irish economy. In 1938 he agreed with Chamberlain (whom he admired) to end the war and resume payments. Ireland got back three ports it had given the British Navy in the Treaty. Churchill (who sparred with Collins in 1921) condemned the deal which he knew could keep Ireland out of the war with Nazi Germany.\n\nWhen war did arrive, it wasn’t just the British that were exasperated, US President Roosevelt was equally unhappy. He sent Eleanor Roosevelt’s uncle David Gray as American Minister in Ireland for the duration of the war. Gray made no bones about openly supporting Britain. De Valera hated him and wanted him replaced. Roosevelt refused.\n\nDe Valera never called it a war. It was an “Emergency” and his young state was on life support. He knew Ireland would have no chance against Nazi bombardment and watched as Belfast suffered in the Blitz. De Valera sent the Dublin fire brigade to help put out the fires but never complained to Germany about bombing “Irish soil”.\n\nDe Valera refused to bend to Churchill and Gray, and Ireland became less strategically important as the war developed. The US left Ireland to muddle economically through the post-war years. De Valera was an economic illiterate who promoted hardship as necessary to wellbeing.\n\nBy the 1960s he was yesterday’s man despite enormous status. Managerial types like Sean Lemass and T.K. Whitaker took Ireland in a new direction that eventually led to the Celtic Tiger in 1990s. The success of the south steered the north in the path of peace. Today conditions in the Republic of Ireland are not dissimilar to what de Valera faced as Taoiseach: rising unemployment, a stagnant economy and mass immigration. But expectations have changed drastically.\n\nThe Civil War generation are now dead. The Irish Press is gone and the Catholic Constitution is discredited. Fianna Fail is in decline but clings to power 85 years after Dev founded them. Partition is entrenched with no prospect of change. Yet though littered with pettiness, failure and missed opportunities, Eamon de Valera’s legacy is immense. Almost single-handedly he developed a positive sense of being Irish to the world that millions in Ireland and the diaspora now take for granted. For that and his sheer longevity he remains an unrivalled giant of Irish politics."
