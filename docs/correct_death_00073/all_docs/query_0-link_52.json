Unlike Counihan, no reference was made to Treacy in any police report and months later the registrar, Daniel Reidy, simply recorded that his death was the result of 'carcinoma of stomach'. Treacy had suffered for nine months and towards the end of his life was bedridden for some time. Weeks earlier, as violent raids intensified across north- east Clare, British forces arrived at his thatched home close to the River Shannon, where he lived with his wife, Margaret, and five children. During the raid, despite his obvious frailty, James Treacy was manhandled and viciously thrown out of his bed, while the British forces searched for guns or evidence of republican activity. It is difficult to dismiss the obvious impact of such an attack on an already feeble man. His daughter Mary, who was there during the raid, spoke often of 'how weak and frail he was and how cruel they [British forces] were...\n\n...Among those who drove to Killaloe was twenty-seven-year-old Patrick Treacy from Meenross in Scariff, whose father had died only weeks before hand, a death expedited by a vicious attack by British forces during a raid on his home...\n\nMacConmara, Tomás (2021) The Scariff Martyrs: War, Murder and Memory in East Clare.

They had a son, Thomas, in 1922. It looks like Mathew was in his mid 40s when he married. I have come across two Bridgets. One would have been about 49 in 1920, the other 19, and I'm not sure which one married Mathew. I'm guessing the 19 year old, but the age gap would seem a bit too much.\n\nMathew was my grandfather's brother. My grandfather was Patrick Quirke.\n\nSean July 22, 2023\n\n22nd March 1903 The New York Times\n\nMarch 18. at 42 Hunter Avenue, Long Island City, Michael Tracey, native of Whitegate, County Galway, Ireland.\n\nBroadford Graveyard\n\nIn loving memory of Very Rev.
