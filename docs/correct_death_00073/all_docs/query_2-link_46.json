        "text": "The Collection\n\nThe Eamon de Valera collections consist of books and pamphlets formerly owned by Eamon de Valera (1882 â 1975). It comprises of two collections of separate provenance.\n\nThe first collection was given to the Irish Franciscans by De Valera and transferred to UCD in 2006 under the auspices of the UCD-OFM partnership along with the De Valera papers and the Irish Franciscan early printed book collection.\n\nThe second collection was donated by Ann Bonar in 2018. Ann Bonarâs father BrendÃ¡n Mac CnaimhsÃ­ was given the books by De Valeraâs former secretary MÃ¡ire NÃ­ Cheallaigh who had been gifted the collection by De Valera himself.\n\nCollection highlights\n\nA small number of books awarded to De Valera as school book prizes.\n\nIrish language books, including Irish language lesson books.\n\nIrish history books with particular regard to the Irish Revolutionary period, and the leaders of the Easter Rising, including biographies of himself.\n\nBritish and American history books including books presented to De Valera from Jacqueline Kennedy and Edward Kennedy.\n\nReports of the Irish Government, Northern Irish Government and British Government reports concerning Irish and Northern Irish politics.\n\nFianna FÃ¡il pamphlets, and a collection of pamphlets published by Cumann LÃ©ighachtaÃ­ an Phobail, launched in 1921, under De Valeraâs presidency.\n\nA number of items were added to the collection posthumously.\n\nBiographical history\n\nDe Valera was born in New York on the 14th of October, 1882, and at the age of two and a half years was brought to Ireland. He studied mathematics at the Royal University, and later became a mathematics teacher. In 1908 he joined the Gaelic League/Conradh na Gaeilge, where he would meet SinÃ©ad NÃ­ FhlannagÃ¡in, whom he would marry in 1910. He joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and during the rebellion of 1916 commanded the 3rd Battalion at Boland's Mill. Though sentenced to death, his sentence was reprieved and commuted to penal servitude for life. De Valera became the only surviving commandant of the 1916 Rebellion. However, he was released on General Amnesty in 1917 and later that year was elected Sinn FÃ©in M.P. for East Clare.\n\nIn 1926, De Valera founded Fianna FÃ¡il following his resignation as President of Sinn FÃ©in due to a split regarding the issue of abstentionism. He would remain elected as a parliamentary representative for Clare until his election as President in 1959.\n\nHe was President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State and Minister for External Affairs from 1932-37. Following the enactment of the Constitution by the people, Eamon De Valera became Taoiseach and continued his position as Minister for External Affairs from 1937 â 48. He became Taoiseach again from 1951 â 54, and 1957 â 59. On June 25th, 1959, he was inaugurated as the third President of Ireland. He served as President from 1959 to 1973, consisting of two consecutive terms in office.\n\nEamon de Valera died on August 29th, 1975.\n\nAccess and use"
