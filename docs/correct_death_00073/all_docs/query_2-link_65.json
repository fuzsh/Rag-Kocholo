        "text": "Just as a prelude, we heard Professor Toyin for Lola with us because\n\nhe has just published or in the process of publishing a book on secessionist states,\n\nand this raises the question of whether to give just a prelude to our discussion\n\nwhether Ireland was a secessionist state. As I understand it, this is not\n\nthe way the Irish look at it. If they achieve their own independence.\n\nBut on the other hand, they regard Northern Ireland as a secessionist state.\n\nSo this becomes a rather complex issue. What they also we’re very happy that Filippa is back\n\nwith us.\n\nAnd many of you will remember Kevin Kinney, who taught here\n\nin the nineteen nineties. Five, six. How many years? Five years.\n\nAnd then he was lured away to Boston College. And he has gone\n\non from Boston College to NYU and he’s in his second month\n\nat NYU. So this is a remarkable occasion.\n\nI want to point out that Kevin is famous for the books that he has already\n\nwritten on Irish history, and one in particular,\n\nIreland and the British Empire, which was the first\n\nbook in the companion series of the Oxford history of the\n\nBritish Empire. So, Kevin, we are very much looking forward to hearing your\n\ntalk about Alan.\n\nThank you very much, Roger. It’s a great pleasure to be back\n\nat U.T. Hellstrom. I started here in nineteen ninety four twenty five years ago and\n\njoined the British Studies Seminar in my first week, and I have then\n\nthe junior fellow ever since. Once a junior fellow, always a junior\n\nfellow stays in touch with Roger\n\nas a role model and a colleague and a mentor during all\n\nof that period. Roger contacted me in the summer and asked me if I would\n\ngive re-appraisal of Ayman Devil era\n\nthe dominant and most controversial figure. Irish political history of the\n\ninvites me to do things, whether it’s a book or a lecture, before giving\n\na reappraisal in my own mind. I have to come up with an appraisal. In other\n\nwords, there was a learning curve for me. I had to learn quite a lot about Devil Arrow before I could reappraise\n\nhim. But that’s what I’ll attempt to do today. Aymond Devil area with the\n\ndominant figure in Irish politics for almost half a century from his role\n\nin the Easter Rising of 1916 to his last term as Prime\n\nMinister, or t shock, which ended in 1959. And after\n\nthat, he served two seven year terms in the ceremonial but influential\n\noffice of President of Ireland. So from 1916 to 1973,\n\nDevel era was the dominant figure. The architect of the Irish state\n\nDEVEL era is also the most controversial and divisive figure in modern Irish history.\n\nIt is fair to say that he is currently more disliked than liked in\n\nIreland for two main reasons. First, his rejection\n\nof the Anglo Irish Treaty of 1921 contributed in a significant measure\n\nto the civil war that followed. And interestingly, the treaty split\n\nrather than any conventional left right spectrum has defined\n\nIrish party politics ever since. It’s one of the reasons Ireland isn’t polarized\n\ntoday in a conventional manner. It’s been split over a different issue\n\nwhether to support the treaty or oppose it. While\n\nDevel era remains a hero to some hard line Republican nationalists, his\n\nrole in the treaty negotiations and the civil war earned him an enduring reputation\n\nas dogmatic, self-righteous and anti-democratic.\n\nSecond, because Devel era was the dominant political figure in Ireland for so long,\n\nretiring from the presidency only at the age of 90 when he was almost fully\n\nblind, his generally perceived as having overstayed his time\n\nand consequently as embodying in Ireland, beset by economic\n\nand cultural backwardness, of which he seemed to display very little\n\nawareness, Devel believed an economic self-sufficiency rather\n\nthan development. He did nothing to stop the massive emigration that continue to\n\ncharacterised Ireland throughout the 20th century as much as it had on the 19th.\n\nAnd he clung to a deeply conservative approach on social questions. For example,\n\nwomen’s rights add to this the forms of censorship he introduced during and\n\nafter World War 2 and Devil Era as Ireland emerges as a bleak\n\nnarrow-minded place. So the case against Devel era is a. Wrong one.\n\nBut so, too, is the case in his favor. When he returned to power\n\nin the nineteen thirties, a decade after the treaty split, he drafted a new constitution\n\nthat made Ireland a republic in all but name. And he carved out a space for\n\nIrish neutrality that carried Ireland through the crisis of World War 2\n\nand has endured to the present. In these two ways, in particular, the Constitution\n\nand neutrality devil era created modern Ireland. That’s a sovereign state.\n\nSo let me begin with a brief account of what previous historians and biographers\n\nhave made of a medieval era. The official biography published by Lord\n\nLongford and Thomas O’Neill in 1970 was by the nature\n\nof its genre, long on praise and short on critical judgment.\n\nTim Pat Coogan, a well-known Irish newspaper editor and self-trained historian,\n\nset out to provide a corrective in his 700 page Aymond devil era,\n\nThe Man Who Was Ireland, published in 1995. Coogan\n\nhad previously published a biography of Michael Collins, Devel Errors chief antagonist\n\nin the Civil War, whom Coogan regarded as the legitimate architect of the Irish\n\nstate. Few remember the film Michael Collins, the eponymous hero\n\nplayed by Liam Neeson and the craven, duplicitous figure of Devel era.\n\nBrilliantly, though surely and accurately captured by the late Alan Rickman\n\nare largely Coogan’s creations. Coogan’s biography of Devel era,\n\nthough comprehensive, is, in the end a hatchet job. Coogan declares his intention,\n\nquote, to steer between the seller of hagiography and the Charybdis of denigration.\n\nPractically everything of substance written about him falls into one category or the other.\n\nCoogan writes I have tried to evaluate him neither as a demon\n\nnor as a plaster saint, but for what he was. For better or worse,\n\nthe most important leader of the 20th century. But Coogan’s biography is not nearly\n\nas balanced as he suggests. Was he a Lincoln or a Machiavelli?\n\nCoogan asks at the outset. A saint or a charlatan, a man of peace,\n\nor one who incited young men to hatred and violence? The very terms of this\n\ninquiry virtually ensure that the latter set of attributes Machiavellian\n\ncharlatans, charlatan, apostle of violence not only get a serious airing in the book,\n\nbut on balance went out. The figure of devil error that emerges over the\n\nnext several hundred pages is, as Coogan puts it in his final chapter, etched\n\nin light and shade with the light demmer and the shade darker than official\n\nportraits have hitherto depicted. But once again, that’s portrayed as not as subtle as Coogan suggests.\n\nHis devil aira is always vain, self-righteous, petulant, dogmatic\n\nand devious, and always angling for power. Coogan finds devel errors handling\n\nof the treaty negotiations which determine the course of Irish history for the next century irresponsible\n\nand born out of a reckless pride. As a result of devel errors actions, he concludes,\n\nIreland’s course was set in bitterness and small horizons.\n\nHe concludes that the great challenges which confronted him during his years in office,\n\nincluding partition, the economy and emigration devel error did little\n\nthat was useful and much that was harmful. Coogan’s biography ends\n\nas it begins with a series of rhetorical questions. What then was devel error?\n\nA hero or a fraud? A patriot and a statesman or a ward heeling politician,\n\na scholar or an obscurantist, a charlatan or a seer?\n\nAgain, merely to pose the matter. In this way is virtually to ensure the outcome.\n\nHe had elements of all these things in him. Coogan declares. But as ever, he\n\nis most interested in exposing the negative qualities. Reviewing Coogan’s\n\nbook in The Independent. Professor Roy Foster of Oxford University paid a backhanded\n\ntribute to DEVEL errors political gifts, but also skewered him for his weaknesses\n\nrepeatedly. Foster writes Devel error converted practical defeat into a\n\nrhetorical victory. The rising quarrels with Irish-American leaders.\n\nThe treaty split the civil war. The entry into the dole, that’s I wrote the Irish\n\nparliament. The same tactic would gloss over the distancing of Ulster. The failure\n\nto revive spoken Irish economic stagnation and the hemorrhage of emigration.\n\nAnd, Foster adds, a virtue was made of his personal commitment to moronic\n\nartistic censorship and sectarian constitutional law.\n\nThis is why I said Doubler is not very popular in Ireland.\n\nBut Phosphor also acknowledges what he calls devel errors of political brilliance.\n\nHis personal and other inadequacy, fossile writes, was transmuted\n\ninto political karisma private narrow mindedness, self-delusion, even. Jealousy\n\nwere eclipsed in the public sphere by a legendary political personality\n\nthat was foster, rather critically concludes somewhere\n\nbetween Savannah, Rola and Kenyatta. I have no\n\nidea of what that means. The most recent biography by Professor\n\nRonan Fanning of University College Dublin offers the most subtle and balanced\n\nand hence the most persuasive account of devel error of his career at 300 pages.\n\nIt is also mercifully shorter than Coogan’s recognizing Devel\n\nera as the most significant figure in the political history of modern Ireland, as well as the most\n\ncontroversial. Fanning seeks to define the magnitude of his political achievement.\n\nLike Coogan, Fanning is harshly critical of devel errors and transitions\n\nover the trade negotiations and his culpability in the civil war. But\n\nhe lands much greater weight than Coogan to devel errors. Political and diplomatic\n\ncontributions, especially in the critical decades of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nOkay. So on the basis of that balance sheet in my lecture today, I\n\nwant to interweave an assessment of DEVEL errors accomplishments\n\ninto a political biography. I want to tell you a lot about his political life and\n\nthe sequence that has unfolded. And I want to touch on the main themes, the four main themes\n\nI have mentioned so far devel our strengths and weaknesses as a political leader.\n\nSecondly, his role in the treaty split and the civil war. Thirdly,\n\nhis crafting of a new constitution that paved the way for a full fledged independent republic.\n\nAnd finally, the question of neutrality, which he saw as the key\n\nto national sovereignty.\n\nEmma Devora was born in New York City in 1882,\n\nthe only child of an Irish immigrant named Catherine Cole and a Spanish\n\nsculptor named Juan Vivian. Dave Allura. Catherine Cole\n\nwas born in County Limerick in 1856, emigrated to Brooklyn.\n\nThe next parish over 1879. There, like so many\n\nIrish women of her generation. She entered domestic service. Vivian\n\nDevora, born in the Basque Country in 1853, was the son of an army\n\nofficer. The family moved from Spain to Cuba, and he wrote relocated to New York\n\nin the 1870s in hopes of advancing his career as a sculptor.\n\nAccording to Devil Errors account, his parents were married in New Jersey in 1881,\n\nthough no documentary evidence of this marriage has survived. His political\n\nopponents occasionally raise the specter of illegitimacy, but in general, devil\n\nuse the exotic surname to cultivate an aura of being above the fray\n\nin Irish politics, known early on as the Spaniard. He was sometimes referred\n\nto as the Longfellow because of his height 6 6 feet, one inches,\n\nand eventually he was known universally as dev- by his friends and enemies\n\nalike, a scholarship student at the Christian Brothers School in\n\nLimerick, and then at BlackRock College, the elite school just\n\noutside Dublin. Devil Erra excelled. Mathematics went on to take his\n\nB.A. and that subject at the Royal University in 1984 and secured\n\na full time appointment as the head of the Mathematics Department at the Teacher Training College\n\nin Karis for Black Rock in 1986. Up to this point, Devel IRA had shown\n\nno interest in the Irish language, but with a Gaelic revival emerging\n\nas a central component of cultural nationalism, he enrolled in Irish classes.\n\nHe fell in love not only with the language, but with his teacher, schneid Flanagan, and\n\nthey were married in 1910. It was at this point that Devil Erra changed his given\n\nname Edward to Aimen. Like many of his generation,\n\nDevora was radicalized by the home rule. Home rule crisis that broke out in 1912\n\nto paramilitary forces. The Ulster Volunteer Force in the north and the Irish volunteers\n\nin the south stood ready to do battle. Devil Erra joined the Irish volunteers\n\nat their inaugural meeting in Dublin in 1913, and his diligent attendance\n\nat weekly drell meetings and his interest in more advanced military exercises\n\nwon him promotion to captain of his own company. With the Lords veto\n\nover the Commons reduced in 1911 to a three year moratorium.\n\nThe Home Rule bill was finally passed in September 1914.\n\nThis being Irish history, it immediately went wrong because war had just broken out\n\nin Europe and home rule was put on hold for the duration of the conflict.\n\nJohn Redmond, the leader of the dominant moderate nationalist\n\nforces in Ireland, sensing a chance to demonstrate the compatability\n\nof home rule with imperial loyalty and unity, recommended that the Irish\n\nand list and fight and eventually 210000 Irish people\n\nserved in the British Army. 35000 died during that conflict, including\n\nRedman’s brother, Willie. But the result was a split within the Irish volunteers.\n\nThe majority sided with Redmond, but about seven thousand five hundred men broke away.\n\nAmong them Aymond Devel era, and this extremist group played a central role\n\nin the lead up to the Easter 1916 Rising Devil. Erra\n\nplayed a minor part in the rising, commanding an isolated outpost at a place called\n\nBoland’s Mill on the outskirts of the city. But the events of Easter Week made his\n\nreputation and laid the foundation for his political career.\n\nLike other leaders of the Rising, he was sentenced to death by a military court\n\nby met by May 12th, 1916. Within a couple of weeks of\n\nthe outbreak of the rising, General John Maxwell had presided over the execution\n\nof fifteen of the revolutionary leaders. Devil Larry’s wife, Shawn Age, asked\n\nthe American Council to intervene on the grounds that he was a U.S. citizen.\n\nBut devil area was actually saved by a stroke of luck rather than by\n\ndiplomacy. Despite a telegram from. Asquith calling for a halt to the shootings.\n\nMaxwell had proceeded with the execution of James Connolly,\n\nthe socialist leader. On May 12th, he then asked the Crown prosecuting\n\nofficer W E Wiley if the next prisoner on the list, Ayman\n\nDevel era, was of any importance. No, said Whiley.\n\nHe’s a schoolmaster who was taken at Boland’s mill,\n\nso he escaped execution. He spent the next year in prison for first in Dublin and\n\nthen in four English prisons. And it was in prison\n\nthat he made the transition from soldier to politician, establishing himself as the undisputed\n\nleader of the Irish Revolution. He was older than most of his companions,\n\nenjoyed military seniority as the sole surviving common commandant\n\nof 1916. And he insisted on political prisoner status,\n\nwhichever prison he was. That was very important. He was elected\n\nto parliament on the Sinn Fein ticket, not taking his seat, obviously, but\n\nelected while in prison. He returned as a popular hero\n\nin 1917 and was elected as president of both\n\nthe Sinn Fein Party. The party of Irish Republicanism and the Irish volunteers.\n\nDevil Valera consolidated his leadership by leading a successful campaign against conscription\n\nduring which he skillfully secured the support of the Irish hierarchy. The Bishop’s proclamation\n\nnegotiated with Devil Era that the Irish people had the right to resist conscription by every\n\nmeans consonant with God’s law was a critical step towards legitimacy\n\nfor Sinn Fein as a political party and faced with this opposition. The British government\n\nbacked down on extending conscription to Ireland. But devil Aaron\n\nseventy-two Sinn Fein leaders were arrested in May 1918 on trumped\n\nup allegations of plotting with German agents. The devil IRA went back to\n\njail, this time Lincoln Jail in England. While in jail,\n\nhe was returned unopposed to his seat.\n\nIreland’s own parliament, Dall Airand, met for its inaugural\n\nsession. Devil Erra escaped from lincoln. jail in February 1919.\n\nInitially considered going straight to the United States, where he felt he could best advance Ireland’s case\n\nfor self-determination by bringing Irish American pressure to bear on President\n\nWoodrow Wilson. He was persuaded to return to Dublin\n\nand was elected president of Doyle arem, the self-declared\n\nIrish parliament, in 1919. He still had his eye primarily on America, however.\n\nAnd in June 1919, he left for the United States, where he spent the\n\nnext 18 months, the critical period in the Irish Revolution. But Devel era\n\nwas here and felt that this was the best place to be as president of Doyle\n\nAaron. The Irish Parliament. He was hailed by Irish Americans with the informal\n\ntitle President of Ireland, a misconception he made no\n\neffort to correct, and eventually grew impatient\n\nwith Irish American efforts to lobby Wilson and concentrated his energies\n\non raising funds to support the self-declared Irish Republic.\n\nThis is one area where the question of secessionism comes in because in devil aros opinion,\n\nIreland did. Ireland did not need to be granted the right of self-determination by\n\nany council of international powers. It already possessed that right.\n\nIt had exercised the right in the interaction of 1916, and again in the election\n\nof nineteen eighteen Create and Dall Aaron. Irish Americans, he concluded,\n\nshould stop devoting their time and money to opposing the Versailles Treaty, to seeking the\n\nright to self-determination, and should concentrate instead, and directly helping Ireland\n\nin its war of independence against the British to secure control over\n\nAmerican funds. Devil Erra decided in the summer of 1920 to bypass\n\nthe existing nationalist societies on this side of the Atlantic and to set up his own\n\norganization. During his time, the United States he issued up to five million\n\ndollars in bond certificates whereby Americans could support\n\nthe war in Ireland. Devel â€ returned to Ireland on\n\nDecember 23rd, 1920. The date is significant because that same\n\nday Parliament enacted the Government of Ireland bill partitioning the island\n\ninto two on equal parts six northeastern counties constituting Northern\n\nIreland, which remained part of the United Kingdom, and the remaining 26 counties\n\nwhose status would soon be up from. Nation When a truce came into effect\n\nin July 1921, Devil IRA met Lloyd George four times\n\nin Downing Street, but he rejected any offer of Dominion status\n\nwith safeguards for British defense interests. The two leaders continue to\n\ncorrespond until September, when Devel era accepted an invitation\n\nfor an Irish delegation to attend a conference in London to determine the nature of\n\nIreland’s association with the impasse. The conference began\n\non October 11th. Devil IRA refused\n\nto join the delegation. Sending a team led by Arthur\n\ngriffeth and Michael Collins instead would give them how the negotiations\n\nturned out. His refusal to participate in the conference has been the source of endless\n\ncriticism and recrimination ever since. Devil Erra claimed subsequently\n\nthat he remained at home to avoid compromising the republic to evade\n\nany trickery by Lloyd George, who was known for his trickery\n\nof Devil R-New, knew to ensure that any final decision\n\nwould be taken in Dublin rather than London. This was Devil Aros retroactive\n\nrationale, but based on his previous meetings with Lloyd George, he must have\n\nknown how inexperienced and disadvantaged the Irish team would be compared\n\nwith their seasoned British counterparts who included Churchill and Lloyd George\n\noperating on Homefield. If you like. And in retrospect, it\n\nseems clear that he ought to have explained clearly to the Irish delegates that\n\nin his view, they did not have full plan of potential re power to agree\n\non a treaty. In Davila’s view, all of that would have to come back to Dublin before\n\nany decision was made. DEVEL Errors Authority in Ireland\n\nhad been so unquestioned since 1916 that apparently nobody\n\nsaw the need to offer these explanations or to address them upfront. So there’s a confusion at\n\nthe heart of things. Error did not anticipate that the Irish delegates would bond as a team\n\nduring their constant journeys back and forth to London by sea and rail.\n\nHe did not anticipate that they would be worn down by the British negotiators, which\n\nthey were. Above all, he did not anticipate that they could possibly sign an agreement\n\nwithout his approval, which they did on December 6th,\n\nwhich they regarded as their right to do. Michael Collins remarked pragmatically\n\nand presciently that the treaty. qual- it did not grant full independence,\n\ngave Ireland the freedom to achieve freedom, that with Collins’s phrase,\n\nthe freedom to achieve freedom devel era. However, rejected the agreement\n\nout of hand. Instead, he proposed his own version of the so-called\n\ndocument number two. Now, what I’m about to say is a little confusing.\n\nIt’s because it’s a little confusing. No, no. Nobody has ever really been able to get to the heart\n\nof fully to the heart of document number two as distinct from the treaty. But\n\nhere are the issues at stake. The treaty provided for an Irish free state\n\nthat would be a self-governing dominion within the British Empire. The king would be the head\n\nof the Irish state. His representative in Ireland would be a governor general.\n\nOf the members of the Irish parliament. Would swear an oath of allegiance\n\nnot only to the constitution of the Irish free state, but also to the king.\n\nDevil Era insisted that the only source of authority over Ireland was\n\nthe Irish people and that he could not or Ireland could not accept that arrangement\n\nunder document number two, Ireland would cooperate with other Commonwealth powers\n\non matters of common concern. Representatives to two\n\nDall Aaron would swear an oath only to the Constitution of the Irish\n\nfree state. While recognizing the British monarch as the head\n\nof an association, the Commonwealth, to which Ireland voluntarily\n\nbelonged rather than as the head of the Irish state.\n\nOK, all of that sounds a bit a bit clearer than I expected. It was maybe to clear\n\nthe issue at stake. In any case was sovereignty. It was not.\n\nIt was the sovereignty of the 26 counties. It was not,\n\nas is often assumed, the partition of Ireland. Partition was\n\na fait accompli. It had been an act of the previous year. The question was, would Southern Ireland\n\nconstitute an independent republic, as the man of 1916 had declared,\n\nor would it retain an allegiance to the British Empire? Such that the members of its government\n\nwould be required to swear an oath of loyalty to the Crown,\n\nwith the King remaining? Ireland’s head of state.\n\nNow, is that the kind of issue you fight a civil war over? The answer has to be yes, because\n\nthe civil war came out of precisely that issue. Devil error expected to win majority\n\nsupport for his alternative formulation, but the Doyel approved the treaty\n\nrather than document number two by 64 votes to fifty seven.\n\nERU resigned as president of Dall. Aaron stood for reelection as president\n\nof that body. But was again defeated on an even narrower\n\nmargin, 60 votes to 58. And then here is the\n\nkey to the whole thing. Unable to accept this outcome.\n\nError took the profoundly undemocratic step of withdrawing from the\n\nDoyle with his supporters. In doing so, he did not single\n\nhandedly cause the Irish civil war. Extremist elements in the I.R.A.\n\nwere determined to oppose the treaty by force. But devil error did determine\n\nthe form and the scale of the conflict that followed.\n\nDevil Wears Cardinal Sin, as Fanning puts it, was his rejection of the treaty\n\nand its consequent culpability for the civil war that charges incontrovertible\n\nif Devil Arah had been prepared to swallow his pride and with it his legitimate\n\ncomplaint that the planet potential’s had broken their word not to sign the treaty\n\nwithout first referring it back to Dublin. The treaty split might have been contained. This\n\nis fanning. The funding concludes that he opposed the treaty not because it was a compromise.\n\nBut because it was not his compromise. Now is a compromise\n\nthat here he had authorized in advance of its conclusion.\n\nA devil area, as I said, never control the extremists, but its pronouncements as\n\nthe crisis escalated enhance the chances of war. On St. Patrick’s\n\nDay 1922, for example, he declared that if the treaty were accepted, the\n\ni._r._a quote would have to wade through Irish blood, through the blood of the soldiers\n\nof the Irish government and through perhaps the blood of some of the members of the government\n\nin order to get Irish freedom. The following month, anti treaty forces\n\noccupied the four courts in Dublin, the main judicial center, and the storming of\n\nthat building by Irish Free State Free State Army forces\n\nignited the civil war, which lasted for most of the next year.\n\nIn 1923, devil, â€œthe Sinn Fein candidates won\n\nto take their seats on the grounds that the Irish free state was invalid.\n\nDevil Lara was arrested by free state troops sent back to jail for a year.\n\nThis was the low point of his political career, but he was already\n\nplanning his slow return to power. One\n\nof the brief digression and then I’ll get em to the remainder of the latter. One of the\n\nmore peculiar, interesting essays I was asked to write was the\n\nvolume on Abraham Lincoln called The Global Lincoln, which looks at\n\nimages of Lincoln and countries around the world. And they have\n\ninvited to see if I’d like to write one on Ireland. Abraham Lincoln,\n\nan Irish political discourse. And my response\n\nwas that’s that’s either a very good idea or a very bad idea, because nothing has ever been written\n\non that. So either nothing can be written or it’s an opportunity. And that turned out to be an opportunity.\n\nWhat I found. We can maybe get into this in the Q&A, but what I found was that all parties to the\n\nIrish question, the hard line nationalists, the moderate nationalists, the Ulster Unionists,\n\ninvoked Abraham Lincoln with sufficient frequency. It’s not a mantra, but with sufficient\n\nfrequency to make things interesting. They invoked a different Lincoln.\n\nSo what was at stake here is that Devel era had a bust of Lincoln on his desk\n\nand he had framed copies of the Declaration of Independence in his office.\n\nLloyd George was very interested in Lincoln, but when when either man talked about Lincoln,\n\nthey were really talking about themselves. The Lincoln they were literal remembering was a part\n\nof themselves. So Lloyd George loved the Lincoln who had fought a war\n\nover over the forces of reaction and prevailed. The Civil War, World War,\n\none devil era loved the Lincoln who were prevented\n\nsecession, which he equated with partition and in Devon IRA’s view of the matter,\n\nas Roger alluded to. Whereas Lloyd George\n\nwould see the devil era, his kind of secessionists from the Empire Devil\n\nErrors position was We have nothing to secede from the union. The union\n\nwas imposed, not chosen. It’s illegitimate. We have nothing to secede from.\n\nSecession is the wrong term. Nor by the same\n\nsimilar logic to the people of Northern Ireland, have any right to secede\n\nfrom an inviolable Irish nation, which is can be\n\nidentified with the territory of Ireland and has existed from time immemorial.\n\nSo in the Irish political idiom, secession\n\nbecomes partitioned. There are arguments made against it. OK. In 1926,\n\nDevil Era resigned as president of Sinn Fein and announced the formation of a new\n\npolitical party that the party has seen a fall, which is one of the two main political parties\n\nin Ireland ever since, with the objectives of securing\n\nthe political independence of the United Ireland as a republic. Restoring the Irish\n\nlanguage and implementing a social\n\nsystem of equal opportunity. Land redistribution and economic self-sufficiency\n\nof those who came close to enacting the first on the last. In other words, political and\n\nindependence in a form something like a republic and some degree\n\nof economic self-sufficiency. By\n\nthis time, the free state government had\n\npassed a law providing their candidates for the Irish parliament must\n\nhenceforth declare their intention before a nomination.\n\nTo take the prescribed Declaration of Allegiance if they were elected.\n\nRight, so up to this point, devil, Erin, Sinn Fein have been running\n\nin elections, but with no intention of taking their seats. Now, under the law, if they’re going to run\n\nfor office, they have to take their seats to take their seats. They have to\n\ntake the oath of allegiance. Devil IRA advises Finn Finn\n\nFalls national executive, that they must now choose between entering the dole\n\nor simply forsaking political action. And he devised self-righteous\n\ncompromise, issuing a press release explaining that the requires declaration\n\nwas not really an oath, but simply an empty political formula\n\ncarrying no obligation of loyalty to the English crown. Why, he could\n\nnot have seen the matter that way in January 1922, on the eve of the civil war, remained\n\nunexplained. But within five years of the 1927 compromise that I’ve just\n\nmentioned, which is 10 within 10 years of the Civil War. Finn\n\noffor entered the Irish parliament as the minority but main stream party\n\nof the Republican opposition. Sophina Fall and Devel era are back in\n\nbusiness. And in 1932. They win the election.\n\nDevil Arabic big becomes Prime Minister Auty shock and for good measure\n\ntakes the position of Minister for External Affairs. But\n\nboth positions and his goal is clear he wants to remove the remaining\n\nimpediments to Irish independence and on that basis to carve out a position for\n\nIreland as a neutral state in a world beset by huge ideological divisions.\n\nHe introduced legislation to abolish the oath straight away, insisting\n\nthat Ireland was acting constitutionally. Invoking the Statute of Westminster passed\n\nin December 1931, which provided that no law of the United Kingdom should\n\nextend to any of the Dominions without their consent. So he just revoked\n\nthe concept the British did not resist. In 1935, devilry began working\n\non a new constitution for Ireland. He took advantage of the British abdication crisis\n\nto implement its central features. Ireland’s new constitution.\n\nEndorsed by the Irish people in a referendum on July 1st, declared\n\nthat Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic state and affirmed the Irish\n\nnation’s inalienable, indivisible and sovereign right to choose its own\n\nform of government. Now, as the title of the country devel ira chose\n\nthe name Aira the A or E or Ireland\n\nrather than the Republic of Ireland. Thereby retaining a vague\n\nrelationship with the Commonwealth. So Ireland by 1937 is a republic and all but name.\n\nBut not a name. He feared partly that Britain might retaliate\n\nby depriving Irish born citizens and Britain of their rights or by closing the all important\n\nsafety valve of emigration. So he was careful in what he was doing. He also claimed\n\nsubsequently that the name Republic should be used not for the 26 countries alone,\n\nbut only when the 32 countries came back together.\n\nArticle 44 of the Constitution conferring a special position\n\non the Catholic Church is among the most controversial aspects. He drafted\n\nthis article himself. He did not reveal its wording until he shared the text\n\nof the full document with his cabinet the day before it went changed\n\nfor printing. Article 44 has been roundly criticized for favoring the Catholic\n\nChurch. But you are a historian. You would also have to see it in its context\n\nas a compromise. Given the power of the Catholic Church in Irish society,\n\nthe hierarchy had wanted exclusive, not merely special recognition\n\nso that the dominant church get special recognition, not exclusive recognition. Devil\n\ntook pains to ensure that the article made explicit, explicit references to\n\nthe rights of Protestants and Jews.\n\nNo satisfied that his new constitution had reconciled sovereignty with\n\nmajority rule. Formula he had failed to achieve in 1922,\n\ndevil error moved to repudiate the I.R.A. His logic\n\nwas that now that the Irish people had established a state in accordance with their own wishes\n\nand any attempts to overthrow that state was treason. That’s a very harsh\n\nanti Irish laws are introduced at that point. Devon A second\n\ngreat accomplishment in the 1930s was to lay the grounds for Irish neutrality.\n\nAnd under the treaty of nineteen\n\ntwenty two, the sole remaining restriction on our sovereignty was\n\na series of ports in Ireland that remained\n\nunder the defense annex of the treaty. In other words, British access\n\nto those ports was guaranteed. DEVILRY could not dismantle\n\nthat restriction unilaterally. Negotiation was needed.\n\nHe entered into negotiations with with Neville Chamberlain government, and in April 1938\n\nit was agreed that all defense facilities retained by the British would be handed\n\nover to the Irish government. Now, this is 1938. Obviously, nobody\n\ncould foretell what was going to happen. Two years later, in 1938,\n\neven as the ports were being formally transferred, the Irish and British intelligence services\n\nagreed on close cooperation on counter-espionage and other security matters.\n\nDevora had long believed and publicly stated that an independent Ireland would never\n\nthreaten Britain. On the contrary, Irish independence would benefit both countries.\n\nProvided that Britain respected Irish sovereignty, Ireland would have a vested interest in\n\nits neighbor remaining strong, and Britain would benefit from Ireland’s refusal to\n\ncooperate with aname powers in devil areas mind. Therefore, neutrality\n\nalways entailed mutual cooperation with Britain and a commitment to prevent Germany using\n\nIrish territory in the event of war. And actually you can trace that strain and his thought back 20 years\n\nbefore World War 2, when the I.R.A.,\n\nas the self-styled government of the Irish Republic launched a bombing campaign in England in 1939,\n\nDEVEL â€ reinforced the Treason Act of 1937 with the new offenses against the State\n\nAct. And in 1940, aware that i._r._a overtures to Hitler’s Germany\n\nthreatened to give Britain a pretext to infringe on Irish neutrality. Devil Ourown\n\nacted draconian emergency powers legislation under which i._r._a\n\nprisoners were interned without trial among those who were tried. Some were executed\n\nby military tribunal, while others were allowed to die on hunger\n\nstrike and heavy censorship with them enforced throughout the emergency.\n\nThe Devil Erra maneuvered Ireland for the most part expertly through the challenges of World War\n\nTwo. An outward display of absolute neutrality and independence\n\nwas essential to preserve Ireland’s sovereignty, but at the same time aware\n\nthat a German victory would destroy that sovereignty. Ireland furnished considerable assistance\n\nto Britain in secret, including permission for overflights of Irish territory,\n\ntransmission of coast watching and meteorological reports and shared intelligence.\n\nCensorship prevented the public from knowing the extent of this cooperation and\n\ndevel error concealed much of it even from its own from his own cabinet. Chambre\n\nChamberlain in 1940 and Churchill in 1941 made overtures\n\npurporting to offer a united Ireland in return for the abandonment of neutrality\n\nand the use of the treaty ports. But DEVEL error refusing to compromise Irish\n\nindependence rejected this proposal out of hand. Nor, of course, was he naive\n\nenough to assume that Chamberlain or Churchill had either the intention or the ability\n\nto follow through on these wartime overtures. Devil ARA’s pursuit\n\nof neutrality significantly enhanced his position as a statesman, but he rather spoils\n\nthe effect. On May 2nd, 1945, with his mulish insistence\n\nthat strict neutrality required him to visit the German envoy to pay his condolences\n\non the occasion of Hitler’s death, characteristically\n\nit through a characteristically pedantic gesture that infuriated the British\n\nand even more so, the Americans, and which Fanning describes as grotesquely ill\n\njudged. This incident aside DEVEL errors policy of neutrality\n\nwas notably successful. He emerged victorious from an exchange of radio broadcasts with Churchill.\n\nTwo weeks later, when the British prime minister congratulating himself for his self-restraint,\n\nthat not having. Re-occupied the treaty, Portes made several sneering references to Devel\n\nera and his policies DEVEL era and a dignified response. Regarded as\n\none of his finest speeches, Camile reiterated that neutrality was\n\nthe scene a qua non of Irish independence.\n\nOkay. To wrap up by 1945 to urban devil, Erra had accomplished\n\nhis primary objectives. The new Constitution. The emergence of Ireland as a republic and all but name\n\nand a form of neutrality that allowed the Irish state to survive. The only significant\n\nthreat to its sovereignty that it has yet faced the crisis of World War 2\n\nand other major issues. However, partition, emigration and the economy. He had\n\nfew effective ideas or practices, as Professor Joseph Lee once put it. Devel\n\nerrors qualities would have made him a leader beyond compare in the pre-industrial world.\n\nIt wasn’t one sensor’s misfortune that his career should coincide with an age of\n\naccelerated economic change whose causes and consequences largely baffled\n\nhim. Error went on to serve three more terms as teh shock, followed\n\nby two terms in the ceremonial office of President. He had no choice in 1972,\n\ngiven the nature of his position as president, but to publicly approve of\n\nIreland’s entry into the European Economic Community. He saw it as inevitable,\n\nthough in private, he worried about its implications for Irish sovereignty. Always his main\n\nconcern. Without devel error, Ireland would not have secured its sovereignty as\n\nearly as it did, and it might not have retained us during World War 2.\n\nIt is perhaps a fitting testament to his achievement that the Irish electorate regarded\n\nthis sovereignty as sufficiently secure. By 1972\n\nthat they voted overwhelmingly to dilute it by joining Europe.\n\nIt is primarily on his accomplishments and failures. Through the end of World War Two, the devil aera must be\n\njudged. He may have been authoritarian, pedantic and self-righteous.\n\nBut these same qualities were the key to the unshakeable self-confidence that defined\n\nhis political leadership. If I wish to know what the Irish want,\n\nhe once famously declared, I look into my own heart.\n\nProfessor Foster rightly points out that this claim entailed consigning large numbers of people to\n\nthe category of an Irish not only a million northern Protestants,\n\nbut also those people in the rest of Ireland who disagreed with devel error on politics, culture or anything\n\nelse. Yet if DEVEL error self-confidence was his greatest weakness contributing\n\nto the calamity of the Civil War, it was obviously also his greatest strength, allowing\n\nhim to create a new Irish nation state. On one side of the coin was fussiness\n\ndogmatism, but on the other was a style of leadership so skilled and self-assured\n\nthat it made Devel era seem like Ireland’s only natural head of state, not only to himself,\n\nbut to well established people. In this respect, there is perhaps at least a partial\n\ncomparison with General de Gaulle. The two men had very different personalities.\n\nOne extroverted and volatile, the other introverted and reserved. What they had in common\n\nwas unshakeable self-confidence in matters of state. They met in 1969,\n\nin the twilight of their careers when President Devel era host of the former French president\n\nin Dublin. Each of them, for better and for worse, saw himself and\n\nhis country as one and the same. Thank you."
