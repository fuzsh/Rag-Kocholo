His parents, Catherine Coll and Juan Vivion de Valera, were Irish immigrants.\n\nWhen Éamon was just two years old, his father died, leaving his mother to raise him and his siblings. In 1885, Catherine Coll de Valera returned to her native Ireland, settling in Bruree, County Limerick.\n\nDe Valera’s early life in Ireland was marked by financial hardship, but he displayed academic promise from a young age. He attended the local national school in Bruree and later went on to study at Blackrock College, a prestigious Catholic secondary school in Dublin.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education, he entered the Royal University (now University College Dublin) to study mathematics and science.\n\nDuring his time at university, de Valera developed a keen interest in the Irish language and culture. He became involved in the Gaelic League, an organization dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and cultural heritage.\n\nHis involvement in the Gaelic League marked the beginning of his political activism, as he became increasingly committed to the cause of Irish nationalism and the struggle for independence from British rule.\n\nDe Valera’s academic pursuits were interrupted by his involvement in the Easter Rising of 1916, where he played a prominent role as a Commandant in the Irish Volunteers.\n\nHis participation in the rebellion led to his arrest and imprisonment by British authorities. During his time in prison, he began to be known as “Dev,” a common abbreviation of his name.\n\nWhile in prison, de Valera continued his studies, focusing on Irish history and politics.\n\nHis experiences during the Easter Rising and his subsequent imprisonment deepened his commitment to the cause of Irish independence and set the stage for his future political career.\n\nAfter his release from prison, de Valera became increasingly involved in Irish politics, eventually rising to one of the most influential and enduring figures in Irish history.\n\nHis early education, combined with his experiences in the struggle for independence, shaped his political ideology and laid the foundation for his leadership in the years to come.\n\nPOLITICAL CAREER\n\nÉamon de Valera had a long and influential political career in Ireland, spanning several decades.\n\nHis political journey was marked by his dedication to Irish nationalism and his significant role in shaping the political landscape of Ireland during the 20th century. Here is an overview of his political career:\n\nEarly Involvement in Sinn Féin: After his release from prison following the Easter Rising of 1916, de Valera joined Sinn Féin, a political party that advocated for Irish independence. He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Clare in the 1918 general election, running on a Sinn Féin platform.\n\nSinn Féin’s MPs refused to take their seats in the British Parliament and instead established the First Dáil Éireann in January 1919, where de Valera served as the President of the Dáil.\n\nIrish War of Independence: De Valera played a leading role in the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921), serving as both the President of the Dáil and the Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). He was a key negotiator in the truce talks with the British government, which ultimately led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.\n\nOpposition to the Treaty: Although de Valera participated in the negotiations, he strongly opposed the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth.\n\nThis disagreement with other Irish leaders, notably Michael Collins, led to a bitter split and the outbreak of the Irish Civil War (1922-1923).\n\nFounding of Fianna Fáil: After the Civil War, de Valera founded the Fianna Fáil party in 1926. The party aimed to establish a fully independent Irish republic and attracted significant support from those who had opposed the treaty. De Valera served as the leader of Fianna Fáil and helped the party grow rapidly.\n\nTaoiseach and Constitutional Reforms: De Valera became the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland in 1932, leading the first Fianna Fáil government. During his time in office, he implemented significant constitutional reforms, including drafting and enacting the Irish Constitution (Bunreacht na hÉireann) in 1937, which established Ireland as a sovereign republic.\n\nNeutrality During World War II: De Valera maintained a policy of neutrality for Ireland during World War II. This decision aimed to keep Ireland out of the conflict, and it was a controversial stance at the time, given the global nature of the war.\n\nLongevity in Office: De Valera served as Taoiseach of Ireland on several occasions between 1932 and 1959, making him one of the longest-serving leaders in Irish history. He also served as President of Ireland from 1959 to 1973, a largely ceremonial role.\n\nDe Valera’s political career was marked by his dedication to achieving complete Irish independence and his contributions to shaping the Irish state, its institutions, and its constitution.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS AS PRIME MINISTER\n\nDe Valera, during his multiple terms as Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Ireland, achieved several notable accomplishments and implemented significant policies that had a lasting impact on the country. Here are some of his principal achievements as Prime Minister:\n\nConstitutional Reforms: The adoption of the Irish Constitution (Bunreacht na hÉireann) in 1937 replaced the earlier 1922 constitution of the Irish Free State and established Ireland as a sovereign, independent republic.\n\nIt outlined the framework of government, the rights of citizens, and the role of the President, among other provisions.\n\nEconomic Policies: De Valera’s governments implemented various economic policies, including protectionist measures and the promotion of economic self-sufficiency. These policies were aimed at reducing Ireland’s economic dependence on Britain and fostering industrial and agricultural development within the country.\n\nEducation Reforms: His administration made significant investments in education. Notably, de Valera’s government expanded access to secondary education and introduced reforms aimed at providing a more comprehensive and accessible education system for all Irish citizens.\n\nPromotion of Irish Culture: De Valera was a staunch advocate for the preservation and promotion of the Irish language and culture.\n\nHis government supported initiatives to revive the Irish language, literature, and traditional arts. He established the Irish-speaking radio station Raidió Éireann (later Radio Éireann) to promote the Irish language and culture.\n\nInfrastructure Development: Under de Valera’s leadership, various infrastructure projects were initiated, including the Shannon hydroelectric scheme, which provided electricity to large parts of the country.\n\nLand Reforms: His administration continued land reforms initiated in earlier decades to redistribute land ownership in Ireland. These policies sought to break up large estates and provide land to smallholders.\n\nÉamon de Valera Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Éamon de Valera across 24 in-depth pages.
