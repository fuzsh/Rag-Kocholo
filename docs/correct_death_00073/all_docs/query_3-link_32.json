        "text": "January 7, 2016\n\nThere is something refreshing about reading a biography from a historical author that simply hates the subject. I say historical author because Tim Pat, for all his many virtues, is not a professional historian and some of his interventions wouldn't hold up in an academic setting. However, as a popular history of a fascinating and divisive figure this cannot be beat.\n\nAugust 2, 2014\n\nvery critical of de valera as emotionless, possible falsifying/glossing over his history during 1916 rising and his trip to america during the irish-anglo war, and his amoral/ruthless and shape shifting policies/politics, his failure to participate personally with Collins and plenipotentaries in final treaty negotiations in england, his incitement of civil war during the failed anti treaty civil war of 1922-1923\n\ncoogan is quite negative on de valera much of this book. At parts this seems justified, at others, he seems to be bordering upon cheap shots. Not really having any historical perspective or knowledge of this era, it is difficult to say whether coogan is on target here or stretching. This is also not a book for someone looking for a basic entry into Irish history (which I was), as coogan assumes the reader has a large familiarity with many of the figures/names/events of the period.\n\nOften i found myself struggling to remember who such and such a person was or what was the significance or stance of a particular group (sinn fein, for example) at any one time... furthermore, i felt somewhat exhausted by the mountain of information (confusing, overly detailed, not woven together well enough as a narrative, imho), not exactly a ringing endorsement for a book in my mind. all that said, i felt like a learned a ton about irish history and the players of the time. four stars for knowledge, three stars for reading enjoyability.\n\nde valera and irish's neutrality during world war II was also a bit baffling to me. i was left unsure whether neutrality was the position because of a) fear of germany, b) thoughts that germany would win, c) dislike of great britain, d) de valera's political manueverings to remain in power, e) true desire for neutrality by irish people, or some combination of all these things\n\nHelped create Irish constitution, fianna fail party,

left out his opinions on the man in almost every paragraph. This was a struggle to get through\n\nMay 29, 2008\n\nDe Valera is not my favorite but since Coogan wrote the book I gave it 4 stars! Great biography but I am not a fan of the main character!\n\nFebruary 28, 2012\n\nIf you want an exhaustive, detailed, at times overwhelming history of Eamon de Valera and his times, this is the book to come to.\n\nIt’s not for the faint of heart. It’s more than 700 pages, with a deep index and bibliography. If you’re unfamiliar with Irish history, it’s not a book you should start with. It took me two years, on and off, to read.\n\nBut it did deepen my knowledge of recent Irish history. It's not for the faint of heart or the easily discouraged, but it will add to your understanding of what has happened in that country over the last century.\n\nSeptember 24, 2023\n\nI'm pretty sure I'd read this 20 years ago but that had no particular impact on what it was like to read it this time.\n\nI'd say up front that Coogan is \"not a fan\" here. And although I haven't looked at the reviews of the book, I imagine there's still controversy; I ran across some reviews of the movie \"Michael Collins\" that accused it of neglecting \"people with real character\" like Dev.\n\nThe book is filled with detail from archives as well as from interviews with people who knew Dev most of his life, whom Coogan was able to interview in the 70s and 80s.\n\nIt's clear from the beginning that de Valera always looked out for Number 1, and was mostly interested in getting and keeping power in Ireland. The chaos he caused in the US Irish community on his first visit was an early sign of how he was able to enter a situation and cause it to break down because he wanted to control it.\n\nCoogan gives him his due when it comes to foreign relations and his ability to negotiate, which makes it all the sadder and more aggravating that he did not go to England to lead treaty negotiations, but sent Collins and Griffith, because he knew that there was no perfect outcome possible and he didn't want to be to blame for it. From then on until he became Taoiseach, he used the IRA to undermine the government; once he WAS the government, he mercilessly interned and executed them. Coogan constantly refers to the \"official biography\" to demonstrate that a lot of it was lies or at best fudging of what really happened.\n\nThe neutrality position during WWII is discussed in detail through several chapters. While this made Ireland unpopular internationally, it seems clear that Germany derived no benefit from Ireland's neutrality which tended to be quietly supportive of the allies. And although Churchill basically hated Ireland and wanted to conquer it with a huge army, and tried to punish it for neutrality every way it could, wartime records indicate the British actually saw a benefit in Ireland's neutrality - being so small and with such a large seacoast, Ireland would have been fairly easy for the Germans to overrun and use as a rear base to attack Britain from both sides. Neutrality made that impossible. Despite this fact, the allies did everything they could get away with, to make Ireland miserable. Britain actually offered to \"maybe in the future sometime\" end partition if Ireland would join the war immediately, which de Valera was too smart to fall for (no Charlie Brown with the football, this guy).\n\nIt was after the war that the disadvantages of de Valera's hegemony became most obvious. He had no skill or interest in economics, and this became a critical lack as the 1950s wore on. His constitution basically made the country more Catholic than the pope, and there are just now some referenda in the works to remove some of the language about women's place and mitigate its religious nature. These two factors interacted to build the ultimately crippling policies of trying to keep people \"on the land\" instead of industrializing in any way or modernizing the economy to be more like those of the rest of Europe.\n\nPartition was his hobbyhorse long after most people seemed to have resigned themselves to its continuation, and he used it justify not dealing with just about anything - how can we improve our economy while part of our country is still under a colonial power? Yet his economic and religious policies did nothing to make the south seem like a place where protestant northerners could actually live. Ireland's economy and society is only now recovering from the neglect of his long rule.\n\nCoogan sums up, \"...on the great challenges which confronted him during his years in office, de Valera did little that was useful and much that was harmful. Emigration, partition, the economy: even if we start by conceding that his freedom of manoeuvre in these areas was limited, his policies appear to have been framed not for substantive action, but for the eye of the beholder. Rhetoric, rather than reality were the hallmarks of de Valera's style...\" And always in the service of keeping him in control of an Ireland that somehow conformed to his ideas.\n\nThis quote from the period when the Anglo-Irish treaty was being debated was chilling:\n\n\"The first fifteen years of my life that formed my character were lived amongst Irish people down in Limerick; therefore I know what I am talking about; when ever I wanted to know what the Irish people wanted, I had only to examine my own heart and it told me straight off what the Irish people wanted.\" Coogan has a fine sarcastic touch, and for the rest of the book, he refers to de Valera's \"cardiac oracularity.\" This seems to me to be the key to a lot of what happened in the country between 1920 and 1960. Luckily Ireland seems to be in the process of recovering. Friends tell me that it's possible after the next election in the republic, both parts of Ireland may have Sinn Féin governments, and who knows what might be possible if Britain no longer has the heart to enforce partition. I thought Brexit would be the death knell, but it hasn't happened; it may yet.\n\nMentioning Sinn Féin reminds me that I wish Coogan's Irish quotes had been better proofread, and that the publisher (not a small outfit) had used a character set with accent marks.\n\nI'd say if you want to understand Ireland in the 20th century, you need to read this.\n\nMay 25, 2024\n\nA magisterial overview of the \"Stalin of Ireland\" and his legacy. I've deleted a star for its prohibitive length - it scares away the \"easy read\" crowd, and thus hurts its exposure - but for those who want the ins and outs of high politics in Ireland and Britain through the 20th century it's an indispensable guide, and all the better for its Irish view beyond the gates of Westminster.\n\nPelvis-deep in the muck of IRA blood-shenanigans and the civil war, de Valera popped right-side up of the grave smelling like a rose. Coogan, as long-time nationalist interpreter of his homeland, focuses strongly on de Valera's handling of WW II. Pressed for alliance commitment by Britain, Churchill was ready to seize Irish ports if de Valera deviated one inch from his professed neutrality. The Germans, of course, would have loved to turn the island into a great-power catspaw - a \"Ukraine\" to drain British attention away from the continent. Failing that, they too demanded strict neutrality, or the promise of a devastating blitzkrieg that would've cost underdeveloped Ireland much more dearly than US-propped England.\n\nModern readers will recoil in horror at his expression of condolences to the German legation at the time of Hitler's death. But de Valera was a cunning, often devious \"realpolitikician\" who had long believed and practiced the division between personal morals and matters of state. Today, when all is about feel-good virtue-signaling, this kind of stark honesty is as as rare as it is heretical.\n\nCrushing his \"Trotskyist\" opposition in the IRA, making a non-aggression pact with Hitler, and the church \"kremlin\" a defacto state power, de Valera draped a shamrock curtain around Irish life. Coogan's greatly-detailed account dissects it anatomically, for all those interested in exhaustive forensic political autopsy.\n\nDecember 16, 2016\n\nA very thorough book. Well written study of an important Irish leader. Despite the title this is anything but hagiography.\n\nJune 6, 2019\n\nMuch more than just a biography. A tour de force of Irish history and this controversial man. Well worth reading.\n\nSeptember 21, 2013\n\n“Eamon DeValera: The Man Who Was Ireland” tells the story of the “The Tall Fellow” whose shadow covered nearly a century of Irish history. Slated for execution during the Easter Uprising of 1916, Dev was saved, possibly by his American birth, to become a leader of the opposition to the treaty that portioned Ireland and gave the southern 26 counties their independence. A rebel during the Civil War, DaVelera returned to parliament where he would always be a leader and often Taoiseach (Prime Minister). His tenure spanned depression, World War II, an uneasy post-war period during which Ireland exported its people from its chronically economically depressed island. Concluding his tenure as Taoiseach in 1959, Dev served as president until 1973.\n\nBorn in New York, Dev was sent home to Ireland at the age of two to live with relatives. He grew up in a strong Catholic community and was educated to be a school teacher. He soon left teaching for politics which would be his life’s work.\n\nAuthor Tim Pat Coogan has written a long, detailed book that not only introduces the reader to DeValera, but also to other characters with whom he shared the Irish public stage. Michael Collins is a frequent figure on these pages. He also introduces us to the Ireland of the Twentieth Century. I had read some Irish history, but this took my understanding much deeper than it had been. This book brings out the division between those who favored the Treaty that brought partition and those who always called for a United Ireland, the incredible political violence throughout the century and the tenuous hold that even The Tall Fellow had on power.\n\nThis book is not about the Ireland of legend. Coogan is fairly hard on DeValera. He concludes that he did not address Ireland’s problems, that he kept the Partition issue in the forefront, not to really unite Ireland, a unification which would have cost Dev power, but to maintain an external foil against whom to run. Ironically, DeValera’s greatest achievement, that of keeping Ireland neutral during World War II, would be a stand which would make him, to an extent, a post-war outcast in non-Irish circles.\n\nAlthough a bit long, I enjoyed this book for its introduction to a giant life and the history of a country which is of much interest to me.\n\nOctober 13, 2020\n\nDev must have cost many Irish lives on ships by keeping Ireland out of World War II. But he must have saved many Irish lives by reducing the number of bombs that fell on Irish soil. Damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nI loved the comment that Dev was effectively a 'lay' Cardinal in his attempts to keep Ireland 'Catholic'. But we now know the type of Catholic Ireland that existed - mother and baby homes, clerical abuse, etc - in his time. It was all about power. Keep the population in check and it's easier to keep power.\n\nRead\n\nSeptember 15, 2012\n\n\"A great bio of the truly flawed but still monumental Irish figure Eamon De Valera. Coogan comes down on the Collins side of the equation, but the book is a must read, even for those who may have a different view.\"\n\nFebruary 10, 2013\n\nI really enjoyed this book because it spans across Ireland's recent history and gives insights through the eyes of a complex significant man.\n\nI would not say great. But I respect and tip my hat to anyone who kisses his wife good bye leaving home expecting to die for his country.\n\nSeptember 2, 2011\n\nIt's clear that Coogan warms to the subject of all things Irish. This is an admirably research, well written and thoughtful work, a thoroughly engaging read.\n\nFebruary 8, 2016\n\nTim Pat Coogan's large work on de Valera is well worth the time.\n\nSeptember 7, 2022\n\nA great story of a very complicated man."
