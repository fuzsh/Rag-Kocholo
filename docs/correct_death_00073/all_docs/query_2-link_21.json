        "text": "(1882–1975). Eamon de Valera was one of the people who led the struggle to free Ireland from British rule. He disagreed with the terms of the treaty that established the Irish Free State in 1921, however. During the Irish Civil War that followed, he fought against those whose views he had previously shared. He later formed his own political party, Fianna Fáil, and was elected to the Irish Parliament (the Dáil). He eventually became the leader of the country.\n\nDe Valera was born on October 14, 1882, in New York City, but he grew up in County Limerick, Ireland. At the time, Ireland was ruled by Britain. As a young man he wanted to see Ireland rule itself. He took part in the anti-British Easter Rising of 1916. When the British ended the uprising, many of the leaders were executed. De Valera was spared because he was an American citizen.\n\nIn 1917 de Valera became the leader of the Sinn Féin party. The party worked to end British rule in Ireland. Sinn Féin members won election to most of the Irish seats in the British Parliament in 1918. By then de Valera was in a British prison. In January 1919 the Irish members of Parliament met in Dublin and declared themselves members of a separate Irish Parliament and set up a government. This led to fighting between British and Irish forces. In February de Valera had escaped to America, where he gathered support and money for the cause of Irish independence. When he returned to Ireland, he joined forces with Michael Collins, who was leading the fight against the British.\n\nIn 1921 the British agreed to meet with the Irish leaders in London to discuss a peace agreement. De Valera decided not to go himself. Collins and a group of his supporters went instead.\n\nCollins returned with an agreement that would give the Irish a lot of freedom. However, not all of Ireland was included in the treaty. Six counties in the north were to remain under British rule. The Irish still had to swear to be loyal to the British monarch as well. De Valera did not like these terms. He wanted the whole of Ireland to be completely free of British rule.\n\nDe Valera and Collins found themselves on opposite sides in the civil war that followed. When the treaty was eventually accepted, de Valera left the Dáil.\n\nAlthough de Valera had lost the fight, he still had many supporters. He set up a political party called Fianna Fáil (which means “Soldiers of Destiny”). In 1932 this party won an election to form the government of Ireland. De Valera became taoiseach (prime minister). He was elected taoiseach three times, and later became president of the Irish Republic.\n\nAs Ireland’s leader, de Valera made important changes to the way the country was organized. At first, Britain still played a role in the government of Ireland, but de Valera did not accept this. He made Ireland completely separate from Britain and also claimed that Northern Ireland should not be ruled by Britain.\n\nTo some people, de Valera was responsible for causing a civil war. To many, however, he was a strong leader who believed in his country and helped it achieve independence. De Valera died on August 29, 1975, in Dublin."
