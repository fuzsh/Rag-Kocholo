        "text": "By John Farmer\n\nIn Dublin, Ireland, 90 years ago today, an incident occurred that would signal the beginning of the end for the British colonial empire. It was the work of obscure men who, in their often fumbling, disorganized way, altered history.\n\nA bit of background: The long Irish agony under British rule came to a head with the “Rising,” as the Irish call it, during Easter week in 1916. Rebels armed with little more than rifles and sidearms battled British regulars in a heavily damaged Dublin for seven days before being beaten into submission.\n\nThe revolt might have ended in ignominy like so many previous Irish uprisings. The public showed little sympathy, pelting the rebels with debris as they marched off to prison. But the Brits made a monumental mistake — one colonial oppressors through history have made.\n\nThey executed a number of the rebels, including three leaders: Joseph Plunkett, the socialist firebrand James Connolly and Padraig Pearse, a revered poet. The killings revolted Irish opinion and slowly turned it in favor of the rebels. But an even greater British mistake involved two rebels they imprisoned but later released — Eamon de Valera and, more important, Michael Collins.\n\nMore than any other two men, they were the architects of the seven-year fight that followed the Easter Rising and ended London’s long suffocation of Irish nationalism.\n\nThough equally ardent nationalists, de Valera, slender, bespectacled, a bit nerdish looking, and Collins, burly, good-looking, a legendary athlete, could not have differed more in their approach to what the British considered treason. De Valera, the purist; Collins, the pragmatist.\n\nThe orthodox de Valera wanted a conventional, out-in-the-open fight, something Collins knew couldn’t be won; he favored guerilla war, a fight in Dublin’s dark alleys and rural Ireland’s secluded country lanes. De Valera opposed any service in the British-run government; Collins encouraged followers to seek work in Dublin Castle, especially in its intelligence departments.\n\nWith de Valera in America raising money, leadership fell increasingly to Collins, who masterminded one of history’s most successful guerilla campaigns. British army units and police were ambushed regularly by Irish “flying squads” tipped off by Collins’ informants in the castle. Casualties mounted, civil government was threatened.\n\nLondon knew Collins was behind its losses and raised the stakes in a bid to find him. The home secretary — a rising political star named Winston Churchill — dispatched agents to Dublin, posing as businessmen or journalists, to capture or kill the illusive Collins.\n\nThe final, fatal British mistake, as it turned out.\n\nWithin days, Collins had names, addresses and handouts of all of Churchill’s agents. On Sunday, Nov. 21, 1920 — 90 years ago today — in the hours near dawn, Collins’ “apostles,” in two-man teams, killed all or most of Churchill’s agents, at least 12 and as many as 14.\n\nIn reprisal, British units — including the Black and Tans, especially brutal irregulars — opened fire on crowds at a sporting match in Croke Park. It was the first of many Irish “Bloody Sundays” to come.\n\n“Not only was Bloody Sunday to mark the end of Britain’s rule in the greater part of Ireland,” author Ulrick O’Connor commented, “it was to be the beginning of the breakup of British rule throughout the Empire.”\n\nA peace treaty followed quickly, ridding most of Ireland of British rule, but splitting the rebels politically and creating the divided Ireland that exists today. In signing it, Collins said, prophetically, “I have signed my own death warrant.”\n\nHe led the pro-treaty Irish army that won the civil war against de Valera’s anti-treaty forces, but died in an ambush in August 1922.\n\nMystery still surrounds Collins’ death. Was it a random shot? He alone died. Did de Valera, a jealous rival, play any role? No one knows.\n\nIn the years that followed, Collins slipped into history, mostly unnoticed, while de Valera dominated Irish politics for 50 years until his death in 1975. However, recent books and an overly romanticized movie have revived Collins' legacy as, to quote author Tim Pat Coogan, \"The Man Who Made Ireland.\" It's an outcome prophesied by de Valera himself.\n\n\"In the fullness of time,\" de Valera said in 1966, \"history will record the greatness of Michael Collins. And it will be recorded at my expense.\"\n\nJohn Farmer is a Star-Ledger columnist."
