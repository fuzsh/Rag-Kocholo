The convent is situated in a very isolated spot and was formerly surrounded by a dense wood of cork trees. The convent is known as the Convento da Cortica, or “Cork convent,” for the reason that the monks’ cells, chapel, kitchen and refectory are all lined with cork to keep out the damp. From 1560 to 1834 the convent was inhabited by an order of monks known as the Capuchins, a remarkable feature of their discipline being that, except on certain occasions, silence was obligatory. Since 1834, when the monasteries and convents of Portugal were dissolved, the convent has not been occupied, though it is open to the public, a caretaker residing there for this purpose.—Wide World.\n\nCORNER STONE OF AN IMPORTANT ADDITION TO CATHOLIC CHURCH WORK LAID YESTERDAY\n\nOn a hill, overlooking Hollywood, the corner stone of the new convent of the Immaculate Heart was laid yesterday afternoon by Bishop Conaty.

Mr. Connolly brought suit against his wife for restitution of conjugal rights. The brief facts were, that Mr and Mrs. Connolly were born of American parents, and married according to the ceremonial of the English Protestant Church of America. Sometime previously to October 1836 and about four years after such marriage, they determined to become Roman Catholics, and for such purpose proceeded to Rome. Mrs. Connolly joined the Romish Church at New Orleans, on their way: and her husband on their arrival in Italy, also abjured the Protestant religion and joined the Roman Catholic Church. Afterwards they returned to America, and entered into a verbal agreement that each should live a life of perfect chastity, which agreement has since been steadfastly adhered to. They again returned to Italy, where Mr. Connelly became a priest of the Romish Church, and Mrs. Connelly entered a convent. Mr. Connelly was afterwards appointed chaplain to the Earl of Shrewsbury, (a Roman Catholic Peer,) upon which, in company with his wife, he came to England, where she entered a convent at Derby. After a lapse of some years, Mr. Connelly left the Church of Rome, and applied to his wife, for the purpose of inducing her to do the same, and return to his roof. This, however, she refused to do, asserting that she could not violate the solemn oath she had taken upon entering the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Rome. Mr. Connelly therefore instituted the present suit. The court, in view of the importance of the ease, took time for reflection before giving a decision.\n\nhttps://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=PT18500413.2.10&srpos=7&e=—–1922–en–20–1-byDA-txt-txIN-Convent+——-1\n\nSacramento Transcript 16 October 1850\n\n(Break)\n\nIn the arctic regions when the thermometer is below zero, persons can converse more than a mile distant.

A most heart-rending instance of this truth came to our knowledge on Monday. A family called Kaufman, consisting of five members, part of whom reached this city last week, have all, with the exception of one, been swept into eternity since leaving their home in Germany, a period of about fifty or sixty days. As embarked at Havre for this country, an older son who had just finished his education for the practice of medicine, fell overboard and was drowned. Three or four weeks after, as the vessel neared New Orleans, the father, Mr. Philip Kaufman fell a victim to the ship fever. The mother, almost heart-broken, immediately on reaching the city, brought her youngest son, a boy of about twelve years of age, to the hospital, labouring under the same disease, and the day following she and a young daughter, the only surviving child, accompanied his remains to the cemetery. Three weeks only elapsed, and the two had got to this city, when the fell destroyer again made his appearance. The mother expired last Saturday of a violent typhoid fever induced and much aggravated, it is believed, by her sorrows. A little girl five or six years of age, homeless and penniless, is all there is left now of the family. A Mr. Samuel Lumsden, a worthy mechanic, has adopted the child, and intends, we learn, to raise it as one of his own. His course does him honour and is indeed worthy of imitation.

THE CATACOMBS OF PALERMO.\n\nNevada Journal, Volume 2, Number 7, 5 June 1852\n\nChief among the wonders of Palermo are the Catacombs of the Capuchin Convent, near the Porta d’Ossuna. It is said to be a place of great antiquity; many of the bodies have been preserved in it for centuries, and still retain much of their original freshness. I have heard of these catacombs in Paris, and my visit to Palermo was induced chiefly by the extraordinary account given of them.— Entering the ancient and ruinous court of the Convent, distant about a mile from the city, we were conducted by a ghostly looking monk, through some dark passages to the subterranean apartments of the dead. It was not my first visit to a place of this kind, but I must confess the sight was rather startling. It was like the revel of the dead —a horrible grinning, ghastly exhibition of skeleton forms, sightless eyes, and shining teeth, jaws distended, and bony hands out stretched; heads without bodies, and bodies without heads—the young, the old, the brave, the once beautiful and gay, all mingled with the ghastly throng.\n\nhttps://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=NJNC18520605.2.14&srpos=59&e=—–1922–en–20–41-byDA-txt-txIN-Convent+——-1\n\nDaily Alta California, Volume 3, Number 190, 10 July 1852\n\nSan Jose, 1st July, 1852 The academical year of the Convent, or Young Ladies’ School, of this town, expired on the 30th June. To-day, the 1st July, the distribution of prizes took place. A large concourse of ladies and gentlemen, among whom were many of the most distinguished in this State, assembled in the garden of the good sisters, to assist at this interesting ceremony. Before I proceed to give you the more prominent features thereof, allow me to say a word of the establishment itself, and of the religious order that have founded it. The order is termed ” Notre Dame de Namur,” from its having originated in the tower of that name in Belgium. Its chief if not sole object is the education of youth. It possesses several establishments on the Continent of Europe and in the United States, all of which are represented as being in a very flourishing condition. Some years ago, a Convent was opened in Oregon, and sisters sent thither from Belgium and the Atlantic States — These have since formed a branch establishment, that which now flourishes at San Jose, to the great benefit of our town, and, indeed, of the State at large. It is composed of eight Nuns, or Sisters, of whom five are Belgian, or French ladies, and three American or Irish ones, under the direction of a Superior, or Abbess. These ladies are all highly accomplished.\n\nhttps://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=DAC18520710.2.7&srpos=61&e=—–1922–en–20–61-byDA-txt-txIN-Convent+——-1\n\nDaily Alta California, Volume 3, Number 233, 24 August 1852\n\n(Break)\n\nDr. Achilli styles himself an Italian Church Reformer, and is said to possess considerable abilities. He was born of popish parents, and educated for the priesthood. , He put on the Dominican habit and was ordained priest at Lucca, Italy, in 1825. He subsequently, as he says,” renounced Romanism, and became a Protestant.\n\nDr. Dr. Newman was formerly a clergyman of the Church of England, and distinguished graduate of the University of Oxford. He had since been converted to the Roman Catholic Church, and is now one of its most zealous, defenders. This pamphlet was published anonymously, but the author beam demanded of the publisher, Dr. Newman came promptly forward and acknowledged the authorship In this pamphlet Dr. Achilli was charged with fornication and adultery in, twenty-three instances and the cases cited. The pamphlet went on to show that a man who had so much to reveal should himself be revealed, and the consequence was the bringing of this action. The parties were so distinguished that great numbers thronged the court-room manifesting the greatest interest throughout the trial.

Scott’s army was marching triumphantly into the city of Mexico, a procession of monks emerged from the gate of a convent situated on an eminence to the right, and advanced with slow and measured tread, meeting the front rank of the army at right angles. The guide or leader of the procession was a venerable priest, whose hair was whitened with the frosts of many winters. He held in both his hands a contribution box, upon which there was a lighted candle, and when within a few feet of the army, the procession halted. As the army proceeded, many a true believer in St. Patrick dropped some small coin or other in the old priest’s box. And when it was observed that a soldier was searching in his pockets for something to bestow, the old priest would step forward and hold his box to receive the donation. Ultimately there came along a tall, gaunt, limber-sided, gander-looking Yankee, who, on seeing the old priest, thrust his hand into the very depths of his breeches’ pocket, as if in earnest search for a dime or something of the kind. The priest observing this movement on the part of Jonathan, advanced as usual, holding forth his contribution box. Jonathan at length drew forth a greasy looking roll of paper, and commenced very deliberately unfolding it. The old priest now anticipated a very liberal donation, and put on an air of exquisite satisfaction. Jonathan continued to unroll and remove piece after piece of dirty paper until at length he found a piece of dry twisted smoking tobacco. He next thrust a hand into another pocket and drew forth a clay pipe, which with the utmost deliberation he proceeded to fill by pinching off small particles of the tobacco. When this was done, having replaced his tobacco in his breeches pocket, he stooped forward and lighted his pipe by the old priest’s candle, and making an awkward inclination of his head — intended perhaps for a bow — said,” Much obliged to ye Squire,” and proceeded on his way. — Brandon {.

After he was jilted by the Princess of Wasn ?, he frequently declared that he was determined to get a wife, and that the Bonaparte dynasty, elected as it had been by eight millions of the people, should not, as far as he was concerned, be extinguished for want of heirs.

His death, due to pneumonia, occurred Saturday night last, at the age of eighty years and nine months. This man was nearly a perfect one. He lived in Ithaca about 50 years and saved considerable of this world’s goods. He leaves two sons, John and Michael. He will be buried tomorrow (Thursday) at 9 A.M., and the societies (The Holy Name and The Catholic Temperance,) to which he belonged will attend. During many years of keen suffering from rheumatism he had been a model of patience and religious devotion. No man could be more highly regarded than he was by those who knew him.\n\nHe was a native of Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland, being born in June, 1814. His wife preceded him to the grave about three years ago. For sweetness of disposition, integrity, friendliness, and practical religious life, I never knew his equal among laymen. – T.W.B.\n\nThe Daily Journal, Ithaca- March 11 & 12, 1895\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/205308450/john-kennelly\n\nMore\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/65359/memorial-search?firstName=&lastName=Kennelly&page=1#sr-205294503\n\nAgnes Marcella Kennelly\n\nBirth 10 Feb 1899- Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana, USA- Death 28 May 1962 (aged 63)\n\nAnderson, Madison County, Indiana, USA- Burial -Maplewood Cemetery- Anderson, Madison County, Indiana, USA- Plot -EAST MAPLEWOOD / 1- Memorial ID -104175889.\n\nParents; Dennis Kennelly- 1852–1908- Harriet Fitzgerald Kennelly- 1859–1932.\n\nSiblings; John Walter Kennelly- 1881–1958- Mary Kennelly- 1892–1892- Gerald Kennelly- 1897–1898- Charles Kennelly- 1899–1899.\n\nJohn Walter Kennelly\n\nBirth 25 Apr 1881- Death 9 Mar 1958 (aged 76)- Burial – Holy Cross and Saint Joseph Cemetery- Indianapolis, Marion County, Indiana, USA- Plot Sec D Lot-14 Sp-6- Memorial ID 134880334.\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/134880334/john-walter-kennelly\n\nAlan W.

Tuesday morning at 10:30 o’clock, William Kennelly, one of our oldest residents, answered the final summons, the end coming peacefully following an illness of less than a week from bronchial pneumonia. He had been failing for several months, but was able to walk down town last Saturday though very weak.\n\nWilliam Kennelly was the son of Michael and Ellen Sheehan Kennelly, and was born in County Karry, Ireland, October 15, 1832. Had he therefore reached the ripe old age, of 85 years, 3 months and 10 days. Coming to America in his boyhood he settled in Troy, New York, where he found employment.\n\nIn 1857 he came to California and as his uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Tainter, were residing in St. Helena came directly here. From San Francisco he came to Napa by boat, the fare being $6 and from there to St. Helena the stage fare was $5, making $11 for the journey of 64 miles. Mr. Kennelly liked Napa Valley and decided to make St. Helena his home.\n\nHe had left his heart in the keeping of Miss Anna Carr Troy so in 1859 sent for her and she made the long trip via the Isthmus of Panama. They were married is 1861 and at once went to housekeeping in a neat cottage the groom had prepared for his bride and where this happy couple lived together for nearly sixty years, their golden wedding having been celebrated December 28, 1911. Their cottage on Spring street was built before there was any Spring street and there were not any houses North or West of where that thoroughfare now is. The population of St. Helena at the time Mr. Kennelly brought his bride here was only about 150. A hotel stood where Wilson’s garage is now and it was conducted by Mr. Palmer, father of our fellow townsman, L.B. Palmer. Deceased lived to see many changes in St. Helena and saw the town grow from a little village to its present population of nearly 2000.\n\nDeceased during his long life in St. Helena had many friends. Old and young knew him as “Billy” Kennelly and this name was given him in affection, because all respected him and admired his honesty, sincerity and friendly ways. He was never known to speak ill of any one, but on the other hand, had a good word for all.\n\nBesides his sorrowing widow, now 82 years of age, deceased is survived by the following children: Mrs. Lena Cox, George Kennelly, Miss Theresa Kennelly and Mrs. Anna Thompson. There are also two grandsons—Lester and William Cox. He also leaves one sister, Mrs. Bridget Haire of St. Helena.\n\nThe funeral took place from the Catholic church, Thursday afternoon at 2 o’clock, Rev. Father Blake officiating. Many friends attended the last sad rites and followed the remains to their final resting place in the city of the dead.\n\nSt. Helena Star, January 11, 1918\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/168736978/william-kennelly\n\nRev John P Kennelly\n\nBirth 16 Feb 1907- Chicago, Cook County, Illinois, USA\n\nDeath 20 May 1977 (aged 70)- Evergreen Park, Cook County, Illinois, USA\n\nBurial Holy Sepulchre Cemetery- Alsip, Cook County, Illinois, USA\n\nMemorial ID 200720730\n\nHis Father; Daniel J Kennelly, Sr\n\nBirth 11 Oct 1869- County Kerry, Ireland-Death 30 May 1954 (aged 84)\n\nChicago, Cook County, Illinois, USA- Burial Holy Sepulchre Cemetery- Alsip, Cook County, Illinois, USA\n\nPlot Grave 2, Lot 24, Block 6, Section6- Memorial ID 200721746\n\nMother; Mary Ann Casey Kennelly\n\nBirth 1 Oct 1882- Castleisland, County Kerry, Ireland- Death 4 Mar 1955 (aged 72)\n\nEvergreen Park, Cook County, Illinois, USA- Burial -Holy Sepulchre Cemetery- Alsip, Cook County, Illinois, USA- Plot -Grave 1, Lot 24, Block 6, Section 6\n\nMemorial ID 200721909.\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/106228/memorial-search?firstName=&lastName=Kennelly&page=1#sr-151966830\n\nJohn Kennelly\n\nBirth 1830-Death 23 Mar 1897 (aged 66–67)\n\nBurial Old Saint Raymond’s Cemetery- Bronx, Bronx County, New York, USA\n\nPlot Section 3- Memorial ID 121015947\n\nWife; Catherine M. “Kate” Colbert Kennelly\n\nBirth 1835- Ireland- Death 9 Oct 1895 (aged 59–60)\n\nNew York County (Manhattan), New York, USA\n\nBurial Old Saint Raymond’s Cemetery- Bronx, Bronx County, New York, USA\n\nPlot Section 3, Range 9, Plot 6, Grave 1- Memorial ID 121015879.\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/121016015/walter-a_-kennelly\n\nMore here;\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/64107/memorial-search?firstName=&lastName=Foley&page=1#sr-189689013\n\nTimothy John Moroney\n\nBirth 1833- Ballylongford, County Kerry, Ireland\n\nDeath 10 Aug 1863 (aged 29–30)- New York, USA Burial – Calvary Cemetery- Woodside, Queens County, New York, USA- Memorial ID 92597543\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/92597543/timothy-john-moroney\n\nKennelly\n\nhttps://www.findagrave.com/cemetery/64107/memorial-search?firstName=&lastName=Kennelly&page=3#sr-186975714\n\nGRIFFIN SEARCH\n\nDaniel F.

He was appointed to the Vatican Diplomatic Service and served with the Diplomatic service in Egypt, Haiti, Santo Domingo and Czechoslovakia. He returned to the Vatican shortly before World War II. During World War II, Monsignor O’Flaherty ran a network that helped Jews and allied pilots escape Nazi persecution, and is estimated to have saved about 4,000 people. He had relationship with Colonel Herbert Kappler, who was head of the Rome Gestapo. Kappler made numerous attempts to catch Monsignor O’Flaherty who narrowly escaped capture on several occasions. Towards the end of the war, as the allied armies approached Rome, Kappler asked Monsignor O’Flaherty to help Kappler’s family flee Rome, and he helped Kappler’s family escape. After the war, Kappler was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Monsignor O’Flaherty became a regular visitor. In 1959, Colonel Kappler became a Catholic and was baptized. Hugh O’Flaherty’s exploits earned him the nickname the “Scarlet Pimpernel of the Vatican” and his story is told in the movie “The Scarlet and the Black”.

At the age of 25, she was the fifth and last of five confirmed victim of Jack the Ripper. Most modern investigators and researchers believe that Jack the Ripper had more victims than the five confirmed ones. Mary Jane Kelly was born in Limerick, Ireland, the daughter of John Kelly, an Irish ironworker. Mary had six brothers who lived at home, a brother in the Army, and a sister who worked in the markets. When Mary was young, her family moved to Caernarvonshire, Wales, and at sixteen, she married a collier named Davis. Two years later, he was killed in an explosion, and Mary left Cardiff to live with a cousin in London in 1884. There she began to drink heavily and drifted into prostitution. For eight months, she lived in an infirmary being treated for venereal disease. With a pretty face, dark hair and the youthful hourglass figure coveted in that time, she was better educated than most people, and could read and write. For a while she worked as a high class prostitute in London’s upscale West End, where she met a gentleman who took her on vacation to France. Returning after only ten days, she complained that France did not suit her, and she would soon move on to other men. Eventually she would live with Joseph Barnett, a coal porter. They would live together at 26 Dorset Street in the Whitechapel area of East London, in a house that had been converted into a hotel, living in room 13 on the ground floor. She had lost the key, and had broken a window in the door, allowing her to reach through and open the door from the outside. When Mary took to sleeping with another prostitute, Maria Harvey, Barnett moved out. The afternoon of November 8, 1888, Maria left early in the afternoon, indicating that she would not return until the next day. Despite the news of the awful Ripper murders happening just blocks from where she lived, Mary would continue to walk the streets at night as that was the only way she could earn money. Mary apparently went out about 6:00 pm, and one of her neighbors in room 5, a prostitute named Mary Ann Cox, would later testify at her inquest that she saw Mary on the street about midnight, apparently intoxicated and with a customer, heading back to her lodgings. Other neighbors would testify that they heard her singing in her room until about 1:00 am. When Mary Ann Cox returned to her room about 3:00 am, Mary Kelly’s room was dark and silent. Mary Kelly’s body was discovered at 11:00 that morning, in her room, when the assistant landlord, Thomas Bowyer, went to collect on overdue rent. Police were immediately summoned, and very quickly, senior police inspectors arrived at the scene. Mary’s murder was the only Ripper murder scene to be photographed by the police. The Ripper had hacked off her nose and ears, slashed her face, and removed much of her face leaving her with no features. Her right carotid artery had been severed, leading to her immediate death. Her clothing had been neatly folded next to the bed, as if she had willingly undressed in front of her killer. Her body had been hacked and cut open, and most of her organs had been removed and left on the table. The police doctors held a postmortem at Shoreditch Mortuary, with some of the most experienced medical men in London performing the autopsy – no less than four medical doctors were present. The inquest, held two days later, quickly determined her death to be murder. For several months afterwards, there were no murders in Whitechapel, and the press soon speculated that the Ripper murders were over with. On July 16, 1889, another drunken prostitute named Alice McKenzie was murdered in Whitechapel, and the officiating doctor at her autopsy, Dr. Thomas Bond, thought her to be a victim of the Ripper, but the press made little mention of her death.
