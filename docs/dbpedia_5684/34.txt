Background Vitelline membrane outer layer protein 1 homolog (VMO1) belongs to the VMO1 family is a 202 amino acid secreted protein. Exact function not known, component of the outer membrane of the vitelline layer of the egg. Seems to be able to synthesize N-acetylchito-oligosaccharides (n=14-15) from hexasaccharides of N-acetylglucosamine in a manner similar to the transferase activity of lysozyme. Description Recombinant Human Vitelline Membrane Outer Layer Protein 1 Homolog is produced by our Mammalian expression system and the target gene encoding Gln25-Ser202 is expressed with a 6His tag at the C-terminus. Formulation Lyophilized from a 0.2 um filtered solution of 20mM PB, 150mM NaCl, 0.5mM EDTA, pH 7.4.
