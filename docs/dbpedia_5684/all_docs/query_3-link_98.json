        "text": "Hey @Alex Medved _ConfiForms_\n\nI just faced a similar problem. But I want to set the default value of the status dropdown based on a condition.\n\nLets say there is another dropdown field with options ONE and TWO, I want the Status dropdown to default to Open only if the User selects TWO in the previous dropdown. If the user selects ONE, the Status dropdown stays empty.\n\nI tried two ways of doing this -\n\nUsing the \"Set Values\" parameter in the \"Registration Controls\" macro but I cant figure out how to implement a conditional statement here.\n\nUsing the \"Set Values\" action in the \"Rules for Field Definition\" macro but the condition seems to not work for Dropdowns. I tested the condition with a text field and it worked just fine. Is there a specific way (using IDs?) to set conditions for Dropdowns? Attaching the Status field screenshot - VMO is the status Dropdown field who's value I want to set to One based on the previous dropdown.\n\nOf course it works for the dropdowns and for any type of field\n\nBut conditions (filters in ConfiForms) operate with internal values, same goes for \"setting the values\"\n\nIs \"One\" is the ID of the option for your VMO dropdown or a label?\n\nAlex\n\nNot quite, the '=' is used when you set the values\n\nWhile the ':' is used in filtering - separating field name (or expression) from field value (or expression)\n\nHope it helps\n\nAlex\n\nNope I don't understand what the solution was for this thread. Can someone be a little bit more specific.\n\nI use the Rules for Field Definition where I set (in my case)\n\ncondition = Status:[empty]\n\naction to execute = Set value\n\nValues to set = Status=Pending\n\nQ1) Where does this field need to be placed\n\nQ2) What else needs to be done to get it to work because I have tried and the field just stays empty.\n\nHi @Barry Smyth and welcome to this community\n\nThis is about a ConfiForms Field Definition Rules macro with action set to \"Set Value\"\n\nAs any ConfiForms definition macro it should be part of ConfiForms Form Definition (inside it's macro body), as this is a configuration element related to form configuration\n\nJust to make sure - the \"Pending\" is the ID value for the field you want to set? And not the label, right?\n\nAlex\n\nI think I spoke to soon works for me, but then I have access to the restricted field.\n\nHowever, for a normal user (who does not have access to the field) the field is not defaulted to anything and left blank once a new record is saved.\n\nIn other words, even though the rule is set in the correct place, because a normal user cannot edit that field the rule seems to be ignored.\n\nSo how do you default a field that is restricted to certain users when a normal user saves a form??\n\nThink of it as an administration section on a form. The user needs to know that their record is \"Pending\" but should not be able to change that field as it's restricted to Administrators only. When the record has been validated by the administrator, the administrator will change the record to \"Submitted\". Kind of a maker/checker rule.\n\nIf allowing only certain people to edit the field means for a normal user the default value of \"pending\" won't be set then that's no good.\n\nI could hide the field from view, but then the user won't be able to see the status of their record either.\n\nNot sure what the correct approach is in this situation."
