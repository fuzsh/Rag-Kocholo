Use the file to prepopulate user and voicemail server information when the VMO installation or upgrade is being pushed out to users.\n\nAfter entering information in AdminConfig.xml, leave the file in the ViewMail installation folder when you make it available to users.\n\nInstalling or Upgrading to VMO 14\n\nBy default, VMO files are installed in the directory C:\\Program Files\\Cisco Systems\\VMO. You can specify a different directory during the software installation.\n\nDo the procedure in this section to install or upgrade VMO on user workstations. You can also install ViewMail for multiple users who share a workstation.\n\nTo Install or Upgrade to VMO 14\n\nProcedure\n\nInstalling VMO 14 Using Command Line Switches\n\nProcedure\n\nAssociating the Applicable Email Account with the Voicemail Server\n\nNote\n\nIf you are upgrading VMO from 8.5(x) to a later version, skip this task as the existing email account and ViewMail settings remain unchanged during an upgrade.\n\nYou must link the applicable IMAP account or Exchange account with the voicemail server. This ensures that messages composed by using VMO are sent to the voicemail server.\n\nDo the following procedure on each user workstation.\n\nTo Associate an Email Account with a Voicemail Server\n\nProcedure\n\nLimitations and Restrictions\n\nInstalling a New Version of Outlook Requires Uninstalling ViewMail First\n\nWhen installing a new version of Microsoft Outlook on user workstations, you must first uninstall VMO. After you have installed Outlook, reinstall ViewMail.\n\nOtherwise, VMO will seem to be installed properly with the new version of Outlook, but it may not work.\n\nMessage Sensitivity Displays as Blank for Normal Sensitivity Messages Recorded in ViewMail\n\nUsers whose Outlook clients are configured to display the Sensitivity field in the message-list view may notice that messages recorded in VMO with the Sensitivity set to Normal do not display any text in the Sensitivity field.\n\nMessages recorded by using the Cisco Unity Connection phone interface (as well as email messages composed in Outlook) display “Normal” in the Sensitivity field.\n\nSome Software on User Workstations Can Cause ViewMail to Fail\n\nSome security and VPN software installed on user workstations may cause VMO to fail. In particular, software that offers personal firewalls is problematic.\n\nExceptions may need to be added to the problematic software to allow ViewMail to work. Alternatively, you can set up ViewMail so that users can play messages with audio devices on their computers.\n\nNote\n\nIn VMO 14 and later, if the user connects or disconnects the audio devices, it is recommended to restart Outlook, so that VMO displays the status of currently attached recording and playback devices only.\n\nUnity Connection Server Must Be Available to Compose Voice Messages\n\nIn order to compose voice messages by using VMO with Cisco Unity Connection 8.5 and later, ViewMail must be able to contact the Unity Connection server. If the server is not available, users will see the following message: “The requested action could not be performed because the voicemail server was not available.”\n\nIn earlier ViewMail versions, voice messages could be recorded while the Unity Connection server was unavailable and were sent when the server became available again.\n\nVMO 14 Limitations Regarding Icon Update when a Voice Message is read or unread\n\nWhen a voice mail is marked read or unread using VMO 14, the state of voice mail Icon is not updated regardless of the Microsoft Outlook version.\n\nVMO 64-Bit Limitation Regarding G.729\n\nVMO 64 bit version is not supported for G.729 codec.\n\nCaveats\n\nYou can find the latest caveat information for VMO version 14 by using Bug Toolkit, an online tool available for customers to query defects according to their own needs.\n\nBug Toolkit is available at http://www.cisco.com/go/bugs. Fill in your query parameters by using the custom settings in the Advanced Settings option.\n\nNote\n\nTo access Bug Toolkit, you must be signed in to Cisco.com as a registered user.\n\nRelease notes for all versions of VMO are available at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6509/prod_release_notes_list.html.\n\nOpen Caveats—Release 14\n\nThere is no open caveat in VMO version 14 release.\n\nResolved Caveats—Release 14\n\nThis section lists the resolved caveats for VMO 14 release.
