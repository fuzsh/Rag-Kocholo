We selected most pathways VMO1 participated on our site, such as , which may be useful for your reference. Also, other proteins which involved in the same pathway with VMO1 were listed below. Creative BioMart supplied nearly all the proteins listed, you can search them on our site.\n\nPathway Name Pathway Related Protein\n\nVMO1 has several biochemical functions, for example, molecular_function. Some of the functions are cooperated with other proteins, some of the functions could acted by VMO1 itself. We selected most functions VMO1 had, and list some proteins which have the same functions with VMO1. You can find most of the proteins on our site.\n\nFunction Related Protein molecular_functionTRIM10;VSIG8A;JPH1B;TTC39A;OCSTAMP;C10orf116;LSM12A;PHLDB2;RNF150\n\nVMO1 has direct interactions with proteins and molecules. Those interactions were detected by several methods such as yeast two hybrid, co-IP, pull-down and so on. We selected proteins and molecules interacted with VMO1 here. Most of them are supplied by our site. Hope this information will be useful for your research of VMO1."
