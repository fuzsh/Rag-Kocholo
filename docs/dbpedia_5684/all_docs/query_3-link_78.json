For more detailed information on the distributions of a specific fund, please visit the sponsor's website.\n\nThe following information applies to closed-end funds in general: Fund shares are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Shares of closed-end funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. There can be no assurance that fund objectives will be achieved. Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their net asset value. NAV returns are net of fund expenses, and assume reinvestment of distributions."
