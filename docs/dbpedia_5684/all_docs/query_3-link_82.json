Nature of Changes\n\nThis is the first issuance of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Policy for Information Technology Asset Management (ITAM), herein referred to as, Policy.\n\n2. Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this Policy is to establish the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) program for the management of Information Technology (IT) and Telecommunication assets in compliance with the Cap Goal 7: Category Management – Leveraging Common Contracts and Best Practices to Drive Saving and Efficiencies, within the President’s Management Agenda (PMA); to buy common goods and services as an enterprise to eliminate redundancies, increase efficiency, and to deliver more value and savings from the government’s acquisition programs.\n\nThis Policy expands upon, and supersedes, the HHS Policy for Software Asset Management (SAM), to include the management of hardware, mobile, and telecommunications assets. A SAM framework alone is not as effective or successful without having Hardware Asset Management (HAM) processes in place too. Software has impacts on hardware (e.g., is the hardware powerful enough to run the software?) and hardware impacts on software (e.g., legacy software that only works on certain desktops). Interrelating the two disciplines and having an overall ITAM process that considers hardware, telecommunications, mobile, and software assets is the best way of effectively managing IT assets, while ensuring compliance is also being met.\n\nAnother important aspect of ITAM is capturing the financial information about the hardware lifecycle, which helps the HHS CIO in making business decisions based on meaningful and measurable financial objectives. Effectively managing these assets can lead to a reduction in the amount of money spent on the hardware during its lifecycle as reduced maintenance costs, hardware budgets, software spend, and saving money through disposal processes. An effective ITAM also helps to anticipate future year’s IT budgets, while correspondingly giving transparency to the IT stakeholders.\n\n3. Background\n\nHHS is responsible for ensuring legislative and organizational information technology (IT) strategic goals are aligned to receive consistent implementation across the agency. The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), passed by Congress in December 2014, has evolved with the release of each scorecard, resulting in new processes and policies within HHS. HHS published a policy to manage Software assets in 2019 (Software Asset Management).\n\nThis Policy will expand the scope of the SAM policy to include other categories and serve as an inclusive ITAM policy, to help HHS improve the acquisition and management of all IT assets, and to align and meet the goals set forth in the HHS IT Strategic Plan as well as the PMA Cap Goals.\n\nThe HHS fulfills its IT compliance responsibilities by developing and implementing robust policies that support federal mandates and programs. This Policy is in place to formalize HHS ITAM and to further leverage procurement contracts, manage assets to obtain better pricing, improve IT asset availability, decrease cyber-attack vulnerabilities, align infrastructure across OpDivs, and adopt and standardize asset management best practices.\n\n4. Scope\n\nThis Policy sets forth requirements for the HHS Chief Information Officer (CIO), the HHS Operating Division (OpDiv) CIOs, and Staff Division (StaffDiv) IT Leads to optimize current SAM tools and procedures, as well as develop a more mature Category Management program, including implementation of best practices for the management of software licenses and initiating a telecommunication and hardware asset program.\n\nSpecifically, this Policy includes the management of all IT assets, including, but not limited to, software, hardware, mobile, and telecommunication assets. This Policy also incorporates IT assets acquired outside of enterprise agreements, independently by OpDivs (e.g., Networx, WITS, Local Services Agreements). This Policy allows the HHS CIO to accurately track and report all of HHS’s IT assets. This Policy will also allow HHS to identify future IT asset needs using a complete inventory of existing IT assets; provide recommendations on using enterprise contracts for better pricing and standardization of HHS IT assets; and align HHS' IT needs with its long-term IT strategic plans, as well as develop a more mature program, including the implementation of best practices for category management, throughout the lifecycle to better meet each OpDiv mission.\n\nThis Policy applies to all HHS OpDivs and all IT assets within an OpDivs’ portfolio. This Policy supersedes the HHS Policy for Software Asset Management (SAM), but does not supersede any applicable law or higher-level agency directive or policy guidance. OpDivs may create a supplemental policy that is more stringent.\n\n5. Authorities\n\nAuthorities include:\n\nLegislation\n\nClinger-Cohen Act (40 U.

The current version of this Policy will always reside in the OCIO Policy Library.\n\nITAM Centralization Plan\n\nAn ITAM centralization plan for is under development as part of the creation of the ITAM Program. This appendix will be updated with the centralization plan to cover software, hardware, and telecommunications assets management and the appropriate governance in FY 2021, upon HHS CIO approval.\n\nIT Asset Best Practices/Guidance\n\nRecord the asset as soon as it enters the organization\n\nAs soon as your organization has taken delivery of an asset, it should be recorded in your asset management system. Ideally, it should be recorded with its serial/license number so that it can be reconciled against inventory data.\n\nEstablish clear asset retirement and disposal processes\n\nThese processes ensure that an asset is recorded as retired when it is no longer in use and disposed as soon as it leaves the organization. There should also be processes to pick up devices that have been lost, damaged or stolen as well as tracking devices that are in storage. Note that devices in storage that have installed software often require a license for that software. The retirement/disposal process should include identifying and reclaiming software licenses from the devices.\n\nTrack lifecycle decision factors\n\nEstablish a tagging system. One of the key pieces of information that tells us that an asset is active is the date that it was last inventoried. This gives confidence that software licensing calculations are accurate. However, there are many reasons why an inventory date may not be current, such as the fact the user of the device is on extended leave. To help manage this, it is good practice to keep a record of these additional factors. For example, store the reason why a device is offline and the date when the device will be back online. Accurately storing the asset role can help too (e.g., a standby server may not be expected to be online).\n\nIdentify and track system metrics\n\nKeep track of metrics that indicate the health of the data and implement processes to improve those metrics. Some examples of these metrics are:\n\nAssets with no assigned role\n\nAssets not owned by any entity in the organization\n\nAssets that have not reported inventory within 180 days\n\nAssets no longer in use that are still reporting inventory\n\nAssets that have not reported inventory at all\n\nAssets with no serial number\n\nAppendix D: Forms and Templates\n\nPlease note that this appendix is subject to change at any time.
