Description

Vitelline membrane outer layer protein 1 (VMO1), a basic protein present in the outer layer of the vitelline membrane of eggs, plays essential roles in separating the yolk from the egg white and preventing infection from bacteria by forming a barrier of fibrous layers in avian eggs. VMO1 is regulated by estrogen and target microRNAs and it is a potential diagnostic marker of ovarian cancer in laying hens. VMO1 Protein, Human, Recombinant (mFc) is expressed in HEK293 mammalian cells with mFc tag. The predicted molecular weight is 45.4 kDa and the accession number is Q7Z5L0-1.

Molecular Weight45.4 kDa (predicted)Endotoxin< 1.0 EU/μg of the protein as determined by the LAL method.FormulationLyophilized from a solution filtered through a 0.22 μm filter, containing PBS, pH 7.4. Typically, a mixture containing 5% to 8% trehalose, mannitol, and 0.01% Tween 80 is incorporated as a protective agent before lyophilization.Reconstitution

A Certificate of Analysis (CoA) containing reconstitution instructions is included with the products. Please refer to the CoA for detailed information.

Stability & Storage

It is recommended to store recombinant proteins at -20°C to -80°C for future use. Lyophilized powders can be stably stored for over 12 months, while liquid products can be stored for 6-12 months at -80°C. For reconstituted protein solutions, the solution can be stored at -20°C to -80°C for at least 3 months. Please avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles and store products in aliquots.

ShippingIn general, Lyophilized powders are shipping with blue ice.
