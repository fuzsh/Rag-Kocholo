The Universität Helmstedt, also knonwn as Academia Julia, was founded in 1576 by Herzog Julius of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel as the prime institution of higher learning in his principality. It was the first university committed to Protestantism in Northern Germany. It became one of the largest and most prominent universities in Germany in the 17th century. It was closed in 1810 by King Jérôme Bonaparte of Westphalia--the satellite state created under French occupation.

The Juleum, also referred to as Juleum Novum, is the main building of the university which contained the Auditorium maximum (Aula, main auditorium) and the library. It was designed by Paul Francke (c.1537-1615), the duke's court architect, in the style of the Weser Renaissance and constructed 1592-1612.

All the buildings around the central courtyard, known as Grauer Hof, belonged to the university.
