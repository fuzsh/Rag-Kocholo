Description: The Universität Helmstedt, also known as Academia Julia, was founded in 1576 by Herzog Julius of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel as the prime institution of higher learning in his principality. IAlthough the duke's own dominions were relatively modest in size, Helmstedt was the first Lutheran university founded in a vast area of north-western Germany and rapidly grew to become one of the largest and most prominent of Lutheran universities, after the two bohemoths of Leipzig and Wittenberg. Like many once flourishing universities in central Europe, it was closed in the Napoleonic reforms of the early nineteenth century -- in this case in 1810 by King Jérôme Bonaparte of Westphalia, the satellite state created under French occupation.

The Juleum, also referred to as Juleum Novum, is the main building of the university which contained the Auditorium maximum (Aula, main auditorium) and the library. It was designed by Paul Francke (c.1537-1615), the duke's court architect, in the style of the Weser Renaissance and constructed 1592-1612.
