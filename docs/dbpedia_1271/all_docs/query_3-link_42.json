        "text": "This article is part of our First Generation Classics special, an exploration of ancient and modern first-gen classicists, broadly defined. Generously funded by a grant from the SCS Classics Everywhere Initiative.\n\nAnton Wilhelm Amo was first-generation in a less conventional, more radical sense: he was the first African to have attended a European university. Born in present-day Ghana circa 1700, he was taken to Wolfenbüttel, in Germany, a few years later as a gift to the Duke, although the exact circumstances remain unclear — he may have been enslaved, he may have been sent as part of a religious mission. Amo studied at the University of Helmstedt and the University of Halle, where he wrote a legal thesis, before moving to the University of Wittenberg. He defended a philosophy dissertation and received his doctorate from Wittenberg in 1734. Amo went on to have a career as a professor, lecturing at Halle and Jena, but as Germany became less liberal — and more racist — he returned to Africa, a place that he had not been since he was a small child, and lived there until his death. Although he was, strictly speaking, a philosopher rather than a classicist, he did write in Latin, as was European academic convention at the time, and we thought that his story would provide a good opportunity to expand our definitions of both “first-generation” and “classicist.”\n\nI (YIC) spoke with Dwight Lewis (DL), an Assistant Professor at the University of Central Florida and a current Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at Pennsylvania State University, who wrote his dissertation on Amo, about Amo’s life, legacy, and ideas.\n\nYIC: What drew you to Amo as a subject?\n\nDL: I’m going to be real — his blackness. And the fact that my narrative ran parallel to his narrative, that I existed in the world as a problem and he did also, that there was no way for me to see myself in history — especially in philosophical history — unless I found someone whom I could put into that history. Amo became that person [for me]. When I went to grad school I was the only black person there, including the faculty members. There was only one other black person getting a Ph.D. in Philosophy in all of Florida and fewer than thirty-five black people getting Ph.D.s in Philosophy in the entire United States. So even though I wasn’t one of one, when you’re one of thirty-five, it is stark, and it is lonely. I could feel the loneliness in Amo’s narrative, the isolation. It’s the same kind of isolation that I feel today.\n\nYIC: Amo was the first African to have attended a European university, as far as we know. But despite the significance of this fact I wasn’t able to find that much material on him. I was wondering if you had similar difficulties, and why you think that is.\n\nDL: It’s sad how few resources we have. I have a document listing all of them and it’s fewer than a hundred and twenty pages long, excluding his works. It’s part of what it means to exist as African, as black during this time. People held on to Descartes’ letters because they considered him important. Someone like Amo — the world already sees you as [a] lesser [being] so there’s no reason to hold on to your materials.\n\nBut we are at a point where, just because things are left, they were put into an archive, and we’re finding them. I think that in the next five to ten years we’re going to see an explosion of Amo resources, because now people are looking. Right after Amo you have Hume saying that Negroes are an inferior race, Kant saying that black people have no intellect, then scientific racism. Amo comes at a point in history where people like him start not to be seen as capable of producing anything of intellectual value. So there was no reason for someone to look for his things.\n\nYIC: I think that’s a good point to delve into Amo’s life a bit more. I found a piece online where Kwame Anthony Appiah describes Amo’s education as an “Enlightenment experiment,” aiming to explore whether an African could absorb and contribute to modern scholarship. What do you think about that description?\n\nDL: I actually don’t think that’s the case. Amo was acquired by the Duke of Wolfenbüttel, Anton Ulrich — very, very, very liberal, to the extent that at one point he backed Louis XIV over the Holy Roman Empire, his literal family. He converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, which is insane at this point, at his level. So Amo was acquired by a person who was willing to do things that other people weren’t willing to do.\n\nAlso, at the end of his life, Amo writes to the Dutch West India Company for passage back to Africa. At this point he really has no position in the world, partly because the Duke and his sons have passed away. But he’s still given passage. So [my friend, colleague, and mentor] Justin Smith and I are of the opinion that Amo, like most of the Africans who had position in Europe, had position in Africa too — they were nobles, princes. Anton Ulrich actually had other Africans in his service, yet Amo was the only one who was allowed to get an education. And it seems that the reason he was allowed to do so was noble birth.\n\nYIC: So if it wasn’t an experiment, what were they trying to achieve? Were they trying to respect his status back home?\n\nDL: I think there is some respect there, but I also think it’s about standing. If you have a Moor in your court, you are seen as having a particular type of class that other people do not have. And so if you have a Moor that has a Ph.D., that is a big deal. Amo and his movement toward education gave the Duke status, that’s why he funded it. This is how a lot of the Moors at court existed, as tokens of status. It’s sad.\n\nYIC: You mentioned that the Duke was very liberal for his time but that his investment in Amo’s education was a result of his penchant for unorthodox behavior — not because he thought it was the right thing to do. There was a self-serving aspect to it.\n\nDL: There was definitely a self-serving aspect to it, 100%. But what I want to say is that others would not have allowed Amo to get that education, without that liberal background. Both of those things are working together for Anton Ulrich — he’s using Amo, but he’s only able to use Amo because he’s liberal. He could have gotten status just by having Amo sitting at court, which you see all over Europe, although [Amo’s education] does allow him to have even more status.\n\nKing Augustus III traveled through Wittenberg when Amo was there working on his Ph.D., and the University had Amo lead the procession for the king. We see this not only in a newsletter but also in King Augustus III’s biography. “Look at what we have. We have this great Moor doing great things. We’re so great.” There’s this use of blackness, but this use allows Amo to get an education. It happens all the time in academia today, meaning that people like me are hired not only for their ability but also because of diversity and inclusion. I think that’s a good thing, but then all of your colleagues see you as a diversity and inclusion hire. I was giving a talk at [Katholieke Universiteit] Leuven and a professor from Cambridge came up to me and said, “People like you are the reason that people like me are getting pushed out of academia. And you guys aren’t even good at what you do.” This is the type of violence, being black and existing in academia, that other people don’t understand or see. It’s sad. It’s suffocating, actually. And it also leads to, like I said, isolation.\n\nYIC: Do we know what it was like for Amo to attend a European university as the first African?\n\nDL: He doesn’t write about it! You don’t even know how much I wish he had. It hurts my soul.\n\nYIC: Yeah, I bet there are stories. Okay, we’ll talk about the stuff we can know. So another thing that I found interesting is that he was an African educated as a European philosopher, in the “Western tradition.” But he also seems to have retained an interest in Africa — for example, he wrote a Master’s thesis called “On the Rights of Moors in Europe” [De jure maurorum in Europa]. Why do you think that was?\n\nDL: I think that he did retain a love for his blackness, for Africa, which is why he returns. When it comes to “On the Rights of Moors in Europe,” I’m unsure. The actual thesis is missing — all we have is an article from the Halle weekly newsletter in 1729. The article tells us what Amo’s argument was, and — this is normal for the early modern period — not the argument, but the topic of the argument was given to you by your advisors. So Amo didn’t pick this topic, the faculty at Halle did. What that tells me is that legal scholars knew about the complications of African freedom and slavery in Europe at the time. Even in 1729, this topic was already discussed throughout Europe, and according to where history goes, they just throw it to the side. The slave trade becomes too lucrative, I don’t know what it is.\n\nBut Amo actually has a great argument, that Moors were citizens of the Holy Roman Empire, and as citizens could not be enslaved in the Holy Roman Empire — Africa was a vassal of the Roman Empire and [its people] were given a royal patent. He’s not trying to make an inclusion argument, a social [justice] argument, he’s like, “No, just based on history and the law, Africans should be free. And yet, they are not.”\n\nYIC: Yes I read that somewhere, that he doesn’t make an ethical argument, he argues that it’s illegal.\n\nDL: Which is smart! I’m going to be real, even today, it’s not enough to make an ethical argument. I have to make an economic argument for having more brown and black students. “It’s going to create epistemology, which will give us more innovation.” Instead of being like, “They’re deserving in the same way that anyone else is.”\n\nYIC: You just said that someone chose this topic for him. Does that contain the assumption that because of his background this is a topic that he should be interested in?\n\nDL: 100% it does. They type him, in the same way that I was sent a message the other day that said, “Are there any blacks who do philosophy but don’t talk about race?” And I was like, “You exist in the world as black and tell me if you can not talk about your blackness. It is your power and privilege not to think about these things.”\n\nYIC: It’s complicated because, for example, as a woman, it makes sense that you would be interested in gender because that’s one of the ways you relate to the world, and at the same time, it’s not great to be typed as being interested in gender because you’re a woman. What do you think it was like for Amo?\n\nDL: I don’t know, but — as a classicist you’ll love this — Amo only quotes, outside of his works, Epictetus. It’s wild to me because Epictetus was also a slave, so Amo is feeling some sort of affinity. He once quoted Epictetus next to his [signature], “He is wise who accommodates himself to necessity and is conscious of divine things.” I think the “accommodates himself to necessity” part is what it means to be black in the world. A wise person learns to negotiate in the world the way that the world needs them. I think this is the perspective that Amo is taking when writing his Master’s thesis. But I also think he gets tired of this, and that’s part of the reason that he returns to Africa. He returns at the end of the 1740s, when scientific racism explodes out of the last fifty years of the eighteenth century. So he watched this shift from blacks being valued as tokens of status to being seen as subhuman.\n\nThere’s a point where Amo actually stops using “Guinea” to describe himself. He’s from Guinea [present-day Ghana] in Africa and if we look back at travel logs people south of the Sahara are defined as “Negroes” and people north of the Sahara are defined as “Moors.” Leo Africanus and Diderot wrote that Moors were of the white race. When they talk about Negroes, they say that they are lesser beings, that they don’t have intellectual ability, that they are driven by their sexuality. Which are all things that we still hear about blacks. Amo is defined as a Negro. Up until 1738, he always writes “Guinea African” next to his name. In 1739, for some reason, he stops. What happened there? Why does he make this shift? The only conclusion that I’ve come to is that in 1739, we have the Hamburg Report, which defines Amo as a native-born American from Halle.\n\nYIC: American?\n\nDL: American. What I think is taking place here is that Amo is existing at the point where dark black, Guinea black, south-of-the-Sahara black, is now tied to the Atlantic slave trade, to Negroes in America. He then tries to obscure his being by saying he’s an African. We see him separating himself from [the connotations of] Guinea and America, to be able to exist in this European space as an African, to be obscured by the term “African” rather than defined as “south of the Sahara” or “north of the Sahara.” So that he can exist, so that he can accommodate himself to necessity.\n\nYIC: We know that at some point Amo started using “Afer” as part of his name. [He called himself “Antonius Guilielmus Amo Afer.”] That word is complicated in Latin because it starts as a descriptor for people living around Carthage but then expands to include anyone from the continent. I was thinking that it symbolizes how Amo becomes a stand-in for people whom he does not totally represent.\n\nDL: I tried to investigate these texts that have “Moor” and “Negro” in them, and Leo Africanus says that there are two types of Moors. There are “Tawnie Moors” and there are “Blacke Moors,” the Tawnie Moors are Moors and the Blacke Moors are Negroes, they’re from these particular places, and Guinea is one of them. He says that Negroes “live a beastly kind of life, being utterly destitute of the use of reason, of the dexterity of wit, and of all arts.” And this is something that he never says about the Moors. We’ve always had this blanketed understanding of “Moor,” but I think that it has a much more complicated history, and people like Leo Africanus reveal the complications. Diderot makes the same distinction, he says, “Moors are small, thin, of poor appearance, with spirit and finesse.” Moors “belong to the white race.” “Negroes are large, stout, well made, but simple and without genius […] Negroes have little intelligence, they do not lack feeling […] Those of Guinea, although healthy, are short-lived, it is a result of corrupt morals.”\n\nIt’s telling that the Europeans considered those in North Africa as belonging to themselves, as part of the white race, and never talk about their intelligence or the idea that they have corrupt morals. They don’t say that [Moors] are overly emotional. It’s wild to me that these are all things that are still said about blacks today. This line of conversation has been going on for a long time. And what we see in Amo’s narrative is where it became normalized in academia.\n\nYIC: I feel like a lot of that is encapsulated in that word “Afer” because on the one hand, he’s asserting where he’s from, but on the other hand, he’s doing it in Latin, the language of scholarship in Europe at the time. So there’s this necessary capitulation going on.\n\nDL: Definitely. It’s sad. The only way to exist among colonizers is to acquire their language. Quite literally.\n\nYIC: I was also thinking about, as you mentioned earlier, how Amo’s career developed in parallel with these ideas about race and racial prejudices, and how he becomes a case study, almost, for the way that race affects somebody’s career, because you see a before and after.\n\nDL: When we look at race surrounding Amo, we see the movement from race being a non-essential difference to being an essential difference. What I mean by “non-essential difference” is difference tied to physical difference. What I mean by “essential difference” is race as inherited difference, in relation to the soul or cognitive capabilities. Amo ends up existing in this shift between these two things. Non-essential difference we’re talking about climate theory, which you will know about from your classics studies, humoralism, things that are products of an environment. It is not a part of their being that then excludes them from cognitive thinking. With the shift toward an essential difference, blackness becomes that thing that actually precludes blacks from intelligence.\n\nI love philosophy, but people in philosophy are often not intrigued by the things that intrigue me. They want to focus on Amo’s arguments. But I’m intrigued by Amo’s narrative and the way that it speaks to the historical ontology of race, which is a philosophical concept. When it comes to his philosophy, I love that he speaks about the mind-body problem, but we’ve heard a lot of people doing that. Have we heard a lot of people talk about race? Is this something that’s important to the history of ideas?\n\nImagine being a black [person] at the time who’s truly revolutionary. Would that person have lived? Does that person get to say their piece? I think not. If Amo hadn’t existed between black death and black life by negotiating, he would have been dead, he wouldn’t have existed. The only reason that we have this dream [of revolution] is because Amo existed in the world in that way. He’s not fighting against the white power system in the same way that we see today. But he’s fighting in a way that’s so beautiful, because without his fight, he literally doesn’t exist.\n\nIt’s ahistorical to think that he could have fought the way that we do today. People are always saying to me, “How is his theory anti-racist?” And it’s like, “You try being anti-racist three hundred years ago! You can’t even be anti-racist today!”\n\nYIC: Was Amo “first-generation” in terms of his ideas as well?\n\nDL: The reason I would say that Amo is “first-generation” in terms of his ideas is that he focuses on sensations in relation to the mind-body problem. I think that it might be based — and this is where I read into it — on race, on non-essential difference. Because non-essential difference comes from outside-in, like sensations. Amo says that there’s an impasse between the mind and sensation. If the mind can’t sense, then things that happen to the body do not happen to the mind. With essential difference, sensations from the environment hit the body, and of course the body changes, but if the body can’t affect the mind causally because there is an impasse between the mind and sensation, then the mind never changes. Meaning that there would be no cognitive difference based on blackness. You can’t make the movement toward what Hume and Kant say, what we see throughout the nineteenth century, that the body, the blackness, forces the black mind to be essentially different than the white mind.\n\nSo what we end up having here is — I want to say, this is not something that Amo writes in his work — an anti-racist theory. And not just an anti-racist, but an anti-marginalization theory. All beings are the same cognitively, because there’s no essential difference in the soul.\n\nYIC: To wrap things up, although the historical context is so different that it’s hard to make meaningful comparisons, I was really struck, also throughout this entire conversation, by the similarities between his experience of being first-generation and a racial minority and that of somebody with those same identities today. The expectation that you represent a larger group, et cetera. And I was wondering if, throughout your research, that struck you too.\n\nDL: Definitely. You can’t see it in his work, but what really pulled me to Amo is that he exists in a world as a racialized minority in the same way that I do. I couldn’t help but be drawn to something that mirrored me in a way that nothing that I had ever studied in the modern period ever had. I don’t know if I would have continued and gotten my Ph.D. if I hadn’t found Amo. He saved me. Because I was sick and tired of studying Western thought. I was sick and tired of not seeing how this could relate to me except in terms of power or whiteness. When my white male colleagues study philosophy or history, they are able to identify with people throughout the entire project, so they get to pick, and focus on the theories. I couldn’t do that.\n\nWithout Amo I don’t know where I’d be. I can see him looking me in the eyes and treating me like a full-boned human. Everybody wanted me to research these people who would never have let me in their house unless I was serving them. I could have a true conversation with Amo and be seen as an equal.\n\nDwight K.
