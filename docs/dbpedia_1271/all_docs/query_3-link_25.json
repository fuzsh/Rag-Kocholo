Consequently, our executive training programs strive to develop the ability to think, to be ingenious, and above all, to find imaginative solutions to today’s ever increasingly complex business problems.

A hallmark of our programs is the close interaction that exists between our students and the instructional staff. Classes are conducted in the university’s modern faculty building where the latest educational technology is available.\n\nOur Programs\n\nThe desires of today’s business students are becoming ever more varied and personal. Consequently, our management programs were conceived with the flexibility to serve these special and diverse needs. They are designed to convey the essential, specialized knowledge required by managers across the various aspects of business management. Moreover, they are based on the principle that business is essentially a human endeavor and that an awareness of the psychological and cultural aspects that influence market participants is an essential factor that must be considered by managers when conducting business operations.\n\nFor that reason, students with diverse educational backgrounds and work experiences are encouraged to apply and to participate in our programs. The various backgrounds that these students bring to the classroom will enhance the educational experience for all.\n\nOur Support\n\nThe Business School has the wherewithal, the expertise, and the experience necessary to provide the type of personal assistance that international students require. We recognize that you will need assistance getting settled here in Magdeburg. There is a myriad of things that would seem overwhelming if there weren’t someone available to guide you. Our staff of multilingual assistants is experienced in such matters as finding suitable accommodations, fulfilling the requirements of governmental and university registration procedures, the opening of bank accounts, telephone service, and numerous other personal items.\n\nWe encourage students from abroad who wish to gain a familiarity with European business practices, while at the same time advancing their management education, to come and join us here in Magdeburg."
