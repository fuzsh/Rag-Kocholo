Please consult the Course Directory for full information on each course’s requirements.\n\nKey requirements\n\nAcademic\n\nPostgraduate study at the University of Cambridge is intense and very intellectually demanding, so the University has high academic entry requirements. You are normally expected to hold or to have achieved by the start of your course:\n\nminimum of a good upper second class (good 2:1) honours degree from a UK university or an equivalent standard from an overseas university; and\n\ncompletion of, or intermission from any current training or education course\n\nTo check if your international qualification meets the University minimum requirement, please consult the international requirements page.\n\nThis is a minimum requirement and meeting it is not in itself sufficient to gain a place. Entry to our courses is very competitive and we are unable to make offers to many candidates who meet the academic minimum.\n\nIf you believe your academic performance is or has been negatively affected by your circumstances, for example ill health, it is important that you use the exam mitigation process at your current university. If you wish to draw our attention to any factors, you should do this within your application.\n\nFinancial\n\nFurther information on fees, other costs and funding can be found in our Finance pages. If you are made a conditional offer of admission, you will then need to confirm that you are able to meet your fees and living costs for the length of your course. However, if you do already have funding for your study in place, you can provide details of this with your application.\n\nCollege membership\n\nAll applicants who are made a formal offer of admission will receive an offer of College membership. The University of Cambridge is a collegiate university, and all its students are required to be members of a College.\n\nEnglish language"
