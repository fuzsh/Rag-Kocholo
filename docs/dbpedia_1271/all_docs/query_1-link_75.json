        "text": "When you start informing yourself about studying in Germany, you will soon realize that you can not only choose from a vast majority of study programs, but you will also come across three different types of higher education institutions, namely universities (German: Universit√§t), universities of applied sciences (UAS; German: Hochschule f√ºr angewandte Wissenschaften) and thirdly, academies of arts, music, and film (German: Kunst-, Musik- und Filmhochschule).\n\nUnderstanding the differences between the different types of universities can help you in your search for the right study program in Germany: Depending on what you seek to gain from your studies and on your strengths and interests, you may decide to limit your search to programs offered by one type of institution only.\n\nThe following article gives you an overview of the three types of institutions in Germany:\n\nUniversities are research-driven institutions that focus on theoretical approaches rather than practical applications. Students can pursue all levels of studies, including doctorate degrees, at these institutions.\n\nUniversities of applied sciences (UAS) focus on the application of research results. The curricula at these universities include project courses in cooperation with companies, mandatory internships, and classes taught by professionals from the respective industries. Only a few universities of applied sciences offer doctoral studies.\n\nAcademies of arts, music, and film offer artistic training and are open to students with artistic talents, for example in design, architecture, photography, or dance. On top of artistic training, some of these institutions offer scientific programs related to researching the respective arts or pedagogical programs related to arts. Pursuing doctorate degrees is partially possible.\n\nWe deliver you a detailed comparison of the three types of institutions. However, it is important to note that degrees from all three university types are equally as recognized in Germany and abroad. Therefore, students should choose a type of institution according to their preferences, ambitions, and expectations toward a university education.\n\nTechnische Universit√§t, Hochschule f√ºr angewandte Wissenschaften, Uni, Hochschule‚Ä¶. even if you conduct your research on the German higher education system in English, you are bound to stumble over a magnitude of different terms for different types of higher education institutions in Germany. If you are confused: Don‚Äôt worry! Even German native speakers sometimes feel confused by differentiating the various university types.\n\nSome of these terms that developed throughout time to reflect historical changes in the German higher education landscape are - at least nowadays - hard to distinguish from one another. The lines between different types or subtypes of universities are often rather blurry. Look, for example, at Technical Universities. They are a subtype of university, meaning they have the right to award doctorate degrees, the academic staff needs to fulfill similar requirements, and often, they do not solely focus on STEM subjects. Therefore, one might as well consider them similar to any other university and have that reflected in the name. Historically, however, the predecessors of TUs in Germany were technical academies focusing on vocational training rather than academic training, so that it did in fact make sense to distinguish the names of what used to be two very different institution types.\n\nTo make the terminology a bit clearer for you, we have created a little dictionary of terms for German higher education institutions:\n\nThis table gives you an overview of the most common - and most often confused - terms. It is, however, incomplete. There, for example, is a plentitude of additional university subtypes (theological universities, specialized universities) or subtypes of UAS (such as universities for public administration). You can find more detailed information in the articles we wrote on each university type, which are presented in the next chapter.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this terminology reflects the history of the German higher education system. For example, what is now called technical university (German: Technische Universit√§t), used to be called ‚ÄúTechnische Hochschule‚Äù, which today denotes technical universities of applied sciences. This reflects the development of universities of applied sciences as an independent and important branch of the German higher education system.\n\nDo you want to know even more about German university terminology? Find out how the term ‚Äúcollege‚Äù translates into the German higher education system here.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt feel like diving too deep into the nitty-gritty aspects of the vocabulary, that is perfectly alright. The main takeaway we want to convey is that there are three different university types in Germany with various subtypes and that they can be distinguished - among other things, of course - by their German names and terms.\n\nNow, with this information, you should be able to make an informed decision regarding the university type that you will choose for your studies in Germany. Let‚Äôs address some of the doubts you might still have and walk you a little bit through the decision process.\n\nFirst things first: We are convinced that no university type is better than the other. Instead, we want to encourage you to ask: Which university type is best for me? Take a moment to think about your talents or interests: Do you have an analytical mind and enjoy solving theoretical puzzles? Great, then go to a university! Do you enjoy improving real-life processes? Then a UAS is the better fit for you! Are you the next Picasso or Jimi Hendrix? Go to an academy of arts or music!\n\nWe frequently experience that some international students have doubts regarding whether they can choose a UAS in Germany and get the internationally recognized high-quality education that is associated with German universities. One aspect that fuels this doubt is that you will not find UAS in international rankings. The reason for that is simple: Many of these rankings are based on a university‚Äôs research output, which is lower at UAS: Professors at these institutions do conduct application-oriented research but are also required to commit significant amounts of their time to teach, so naturally, the research output is smaller.\n\nHowever, depending on what you expect from higher education, there are good reasons to choose UAS over universities: Students who are striving in smaller-sized classrooms, often with closer contact with professors might feel more comfortable at a UAS. We do especially recommend UAS to international students who plan on using their studies in Germany as a preparation to enter the German job market: Since students here cooperate with German companies throughout their studies, it is often easier for them to get a foot-in-the-door and build a professional network. Graduates of these institutions generally have great chances at the job market.\n\nLast but not least, keep in mind that it is possible to transfer from one university type to another: A bachelor‚Äôs degree from one institution qualifies you for a master‚Äôs degree at another, and a master‚Äôs degree from a UAS allows you to pursue doctorate studies at any university in Germany. When changing university types, it may be that you are required to make up for certain missed courses or a lack of practical experiences by taking some extracurricular courses at your new university. Since the distinctions between the university types aren‚Äôt always very clear either, it is also recommendable to check out individual programs and course structures.
