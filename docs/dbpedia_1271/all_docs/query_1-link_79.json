        "text": "Getty Images\n\nAthletics 8/4/2024 7:18:00 PM\n\nBlue Devils in the Paris Olympics Recap – August 4\n\nPARIS - The Blue Devils continued competition at the 2024 Olympics on Sunday with action in basketball and track and field. Here is a recap from action on August 4 in France.\n\nHoffman Makes Olympic Debut, Competes in 400m Hurdles\n\nFormer Duke track and field standout Lauren Hoffman made her Olympic debut, competing for the Philippines in the first round of the women's 400m hurdles. Competing as part of Heat 4, Hoffman clocked a time of 57.84 seconds.\n\nA four-time USTFCCCA All-American, nine-time All-ACC selection and three-time ACC champion during her time at Duke, Hoffman will compete in the women's 400m hurdles repechage round on Monday, August 5 at 4:50 a.m.\n\nBalogun, Nigeria Clinch Quarterfinal Spot with Win Versus Canada\n\nElizabeth Balogun and the Nigeria Women's National Team made Olympic history on Sunday, becoming the first African team, men's or women's, to advance to the quarterfinal round. Nigeria used a dominant third-quarter performance to gain control of the game before going on to claim the 79-70 victory.\n\nBalogun was one of three players to finish in double figures for Nigeria, the former Blue Devil standout notching 14 points on 60-percent shooting (6-of-10) to go with four rebounds. She also chipped in one steal, one assist and a block.\n\nFacing a four-point deficit at the half, Nigeria asserted its dominance in the third to flip the momentum completely in its favor. Keyed by a 16-1 run to open the period, Nigeria outscored Canada 23-5 over the 10 minutes and took a 60-46 lead into the fourth. Nigeria's lead grew as large as 17 during the final quarter – 70-53 at the 4:39 mark. Canada attempted a late rally, but the deficit proved too much to overcome.\n\nNigeria gears up to battle the United States in the Olympic quarterfinal on Wednesday, August 7 at 3:30 p.m.\n\nUnited States Beats Germany, 87-68, to Finish Group Play Undefeated\n\nThe United States ended pool play at the Olympics with an unblemished 3-0 record and earned the top overall seed in the medal round, courtesy of an 87-68 win over Germany in Group C action. Chelsea Gray got the start in the backcourt and chipped in three rebounds and two assists for the victors in six minutes of action.\n\nTrailing 19-16 at the end of the first quarter, the United States flipped the switch in the second as the team outscored Germany, 25-10, during the period to turn a three-point deficit into a 41-29 halftime lead. Team USA kept its foot on the gas after the break and ultimately put the game out of reach. After pouring in 28 third-quarter points and seeing its lead surpass the 20-point marker, the United States turned in another solid effort in the fourth to polish off the win.\n\nNext up, the United States squares off against Nigeria on Wednesday, August 7 in the Olympic quarterfinal. Tipoff is slated for 3:30 p.m.\n\n#GoDuke"
