        "text": "26.01.2017 -\n\nCareer orientation at the Julianum Helmstedt - with the FVST\n\nPhoto: FVST\n\nMr. Karsten Rätze, M.Sc. and Dr. Andreas Voigt represented the FVST at the career day at the Julianum in Helmstedt on 25 January 2017.\n\nIt was a real home game for Karsten Rätze, who himself completed his Abitur (general qualification for university entrance) at the Julianum. Carrying the title of 2016 Valedictorian in the Process Engineering Master’s Degree Program and a PhD candidacy with the FVST make him an excellent contact for all types of questions about studying process engineering with us here in Magdeburg.\n\nAnd there were plenty of questions during the two discussion rounds with 15 pupils each and also at the FVST’s booth in the school’s foyer.\n\nHundreds of pupils took a look at the information and the flyer. And the pocket warmer “flew off the shelves!’ It was cold outside, after all.\n\nWe will certainly see some of the pupils again at the pupil internship, Campus Day in May or ... eventually as a FVST student. Be it process engineering, chemical engineering, or biosystems technology, all of our degree programs lead to exciting career fields, which the pupils definitely noticed on this day.\n\nWe will see the Julianum again next year - we’ve already been invited. Thank you for the on-site supervision."
