        "text": "This is what the title of a law dissertation written at a German university looked like in 1602:\n\n(Thirty controversial law questions selected from the matter of servitudes, both in urban and rural estates)\n\nAnd here is a dissertation title from less than one century later, in 1687:\n\n(Of the law concerning sleep and dreams, Of the law of sleep and dreams)\n\nThe difference could hardly be more pronounced, both thematically and methodologically. In the course of the seventeenth century, German jurists increasingly set aside established subjects like servitudes, a classic institution of civil law, and engaged with themes that were more thematically focused, diverse, and sometimes highly imaginative, ranging from the law of calculation errorsFootnote 3 to the law of shadows.Footnote 4 Increasingly abandoning the scholastic question–answer format and sometimes even embracing the German vernacular in their titles, jurists created a collection of single-voiced, monographic dissertations that is so diverse, wide-ranging, and frequently original that it should command the attention of historians of all stripes. This article adopts a distant reading approach to retrace long-term methodological and thematic shifts and continuities in over twenty thousand dissertations written at German universities in the seventeenth century. Methodologically, it highlights the interest of argument-driven digital history and aims to encourage scholars to engage with a type of data that is available in many other contexts. Providing a pathway into a forbidding archive, this study highlights the vast diversity of insights – into the history of jurisprudence and its receptiveness to social change, academic education and publishing, baroque rhetoric, and the broader cultural, political, and economic history of the German lands – that can be gleaned from one of the richest and most neglected sources in European legal history.\n\nThe first section discusses the dissertation as a genre, its ambivalent historiography, and the method and data underpinning this article. Similar to literary scholars who embraced computational text mining under the banner of ‘distant reading’, historians could benefit from integrating more digital evidence of this kind in their work. Following a concise spatial and temporal outline of the dissertations and their unequal distribution among universities and professors, the third section retraces one of the most striking thematic shifts in this archive: a drastic decline in civil law dissertations. While the waning interest in fields from property to inheritance law raises important questions, topics like marriage and debt eluded this pattern. Just like recurrent spikes in dissertations on imperial politics or inflation and monetary debasement, they underline the academic jurists’ responsiveness to social, political, and economic change. The third section of the article discusses how a growing share of the dissertations lost the dialogic attributes characteristic of the oral disputation and took on a monologic and monographic form. The decline of dialogic and antagonistic forms of reasoning – encapsulated in the scholastic quaestio and controversia – reflected broader changes in seventeenth-century academic culture, but they also transformed the dissertations as a genre. The fading of dialogue and controversy went hand in hand with a preference for more sharply delineated, diverse, and often original subjects that are the theme of the last part of the article. The way in which late seventeenth-century jurists expanded the scope of their writing reflects broader conjunctures of baroque curiosity and polymathy, but it also illustrates the juridification of public affairs in the Holy Roman Empire and the heightened stature of an epistemic community that felt increasingly entitled to interpret all spheres of life through its own categories."
