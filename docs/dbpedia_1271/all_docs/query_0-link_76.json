        "text": "The University of Marburg is the university with the longest tradition in Hesse. Founded in 1527, it offers excellent teaching in a wide range of subjects in a total of 16 departments to its approximately 23.500 students. Trendsetting topics with high relevance for society determine research in Marburg. With twelve Leibniz Prize winners, the University of Marburg is one of the leading research institutions in the State of Hesse.\n\nHistory of the University of Marburg\n\nFounding by Landgrave Philipp: A University between Lutheranism and Calvinism (1527-1653) On May 30th, 1527, Landgrave Philipp the Magnanimous of Hesse founded the Universität Marburg after introducing the Reformation in his territory; the University has also borne his name since the early 20th century.\n\nThe world's oldest Protestant university still in existence began operating with 10 professors and around 90 students at the four faculties of theology, law, medicine, and philosophy. Following Philipp's death in 1567, his territory was divided among his four sons, and initially the sons directed the university together. Confessional conflicts prompted Philipp's grandson, Landgrave Louis V of Hesse-Darmstadt, to establish his own university in 1607 in Giessen, which was Lutheran - unlike Marburg, which was by this time Calvinist.\n\nThe Reformed State University of Hessen-Kassel (1653-1807) The conflict, which during the Thirty Years' War was also carried out militarily, led to an interruption of university life in Marburg. The re-established university bound its professors to the reformed denomination. The appointment in 1723 of the philosopher Christian Wolff, one of the most influential thinkers of the Age of Enlightenment, triggered a period of advancement for Marburg and drew students from near and far, including the Russian universal scholar Michail Lomonossow.\n\nStarting in the 1780's, things began to pick up again, with help from renowned professors of medicine playing a decisive role. Shortly after 1800, jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny worked as professor and mentor for the two most well known Marburg students, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm. The University in the Kingdom of Westphalia and the Electorate of Hessen (1807-1866) With the establishment of the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807 under the rule of Napoleon's youngest brother, Jérôme, the very existence of the Marburg Universität was hanging in the balance. In addition to the universities in Göttingen and Halle there was to be only one further university in the kingdom. Marburg received – unlike Rinteln and Helmstedt - the contract.\n\nIn 1858, a modern surgical ward was built at the University, which again became a state university of the Electorate of Hesse in 1813. Wilhelm Roser worked there. The constitutional lawyer Sylvester Jordan worked on the 1831 constitution of the Electorate of Hesse, though he was incarcerated in Marburg's castle in 1839.\n\nThe well-known chemist Robert Bunsen was also completing research and teaching in Marburg at this time. 1874 - Marburg Becomes Prussian (1866-1933) In 1866 the Marburg Universität became Prussian. Along with this came a boom in every sense of the word. The number of professorships doubled by the start of the First World War and the number of students climbed to 2,500. Around 1900, renowned professors were teaching in all departments in Marburg.\n\nThe philosophers Hermann Cohen and Paul Natorp founded around this time the so-called \"Marburg School.\" The first Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded in 1901 to the discoverer of the serum therapy against diphtheria and Professor for Hygienics, Emil von Behring. The \"Alte Universität\" was built from 1874 to 1891 on the spot of the dilapidated Dominican cloister. In 1908, the first female students were allowed to matriculate at the university. Marburg's scholarly prestige was high in the 1920's. Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Bultmann were teaching in Marburg. The student body was, however, largely nationalistic.\n\nThe so-called Marburg Student Corps played a significant role in the Mechterstädt murders, whereby 15 workers were shot to death. National Socialist Rule and Re-opening Following the Second World War (1933-1945) Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, academic self-government was eliminated and - as was the case throughout Germany - the Führerprinzip was introduced at the Marburg Universität. Professors and students were forced from their positions in Marburg as well. One of them - professor for Indo-Germanic studies, Hermann Jacobsohn - committed suicide as a result.\n\nDoctoral dissertations by Jews were declared invalid, and not only during the war did the Marburg University Library also profit from the large scale theft of books by the National Socialists. The Faculty of Theology, especially Hans von Soden and Rudolf Bultmann, opposed the Aryan paragraphs and supported the Confessional Church. By the spring semester of 1931, the Nazi Student Organization had already obtained a majority in the Marburg student senate.\n\nAn authoritarian, thoroughly ideologized university was no longer able to perform at a high level in terms of scholarly and scientific performance, and with the outbreak of the war in 1939 these developments worsened. The University Since 1945 Marburg endured the Second World War largely unscathed. Already in September 1945, the Universität re-opened. As was the case elsewhere, coming to terms with National Socialism was part of the background to the student movement in the late 1960's.\n\nThe Marxist political scientist Wolfgang Abendroth had a tremendous amount of scholarly and political appeal. He contributed to Marburg's reputation as a \"red university.\" At the same time, the Philipps-Universität was also developing into a modern university for the masses, with about 10,000 students around 1970. Marburg's expansion can be read spatially: Numerous new buildings for administration, the humanities institutes and main library were key developments in the 60's. For the natural sciences and medicine, huge buildings were constructed - including the University Clinic - atop the Lahnberge beginning in 1970.\n\n1970/71 had a profound effect on the university's history. There was a fundamental re-organization. The position of Rector was eliminated and replaced by a President. The faculties - which had now reached five in number - were dissolved and replaced by 21 departments. The so-called Bologna Process, the privatization of the Clinic and new plans for construction - both atop the Lahnberge and also in the Lahn River Valley - have introduced yet another tempestuous phase of the university's development, with no end or results in sight. The university currently has 16 departments and around 23,500 students.\n\nAccess to sophisticated technologies is an indispensable prerequisite for modern biomedical research. In order to be able to meet this requirement, the shared use of human and equipment resources as well as the central development of the necessary methodological expertise is indispensable. Core facilities have therefore become part of a modern research infrastructure and make a decisive contribution to the success of research. On the one hand, they offer the working groups direct access to new, state-of-the-art applications and methods; on the other hand, they guarantee effective use of resources on the basis of appropriate usage and management concepts. The DFG already took this development into account in 2012 and initiated a funding line\n\nIn order to do justice to the importance of the core facilities, the medical department has taken coordinated measures to set up and operate these facilities. A comprehensive financial and personnel concept was developed in order to ensure the long-term ability of the core facilities to work. The core facilities (such as Genomics and FACS), which have been established for a long time, have been or are currently being further, new facilities built. The bundling and realignment of the core facilities runs parallel to the completion and the move into the new Center for Tumor and Immunobiology (ZTI). The ZTI was occupied in March 2014 and serves as a technological focal point and spatial basis for many of the core facilities of the medical department.\n\nThe Philipps-Universität Marburg does not have one central campus. Instead there are two main locations, Campus Lahnberge and Campus Firmanei, and additional buildings spread throughout the city center. The Lahnberge campus is situated around three kilometers east of the city center and home primarily to the natural and life sciences. The University Clinic of Gießen and Marburg (UKGM) and a large portion of the Department of Medicine are also located atop the Lahnberge. Work has been in progress for several years on the Campus Firmanei, located in direct proximity to the St. Elisabeth Church. Several former clinic buildings are being converted. Many institutes of the humanities that were previously in the high-rise buildings of the so-called PhilFak – Philosophische Fakultät, which is located next to the highway that runs through Marburg – have moved to the Campus Firmanei. The main library of the university is also located there.\n\nAt Philipps-Universität Marburg, we’ve been welcoming international students and scholars for over 500 years. You’ll find us in the beautiful medieval town of Marburg, along the German fairytale route in the state of Hessen. Here, the tradition and history of your surroundings will enchant and inspire you, and our friendly small-city spirit will make you feel at home as soon as you’ve arrived.\n\nWhether you come to us as a student, a doctoral candidate, researcher, or as an exchange teacher or administrator, great opportunities await you in Marburg. You’ll be walking in the footsteps of great minds like Emil von Behring, the world’s first Nobel Prize winner; world-renowned chemist Robert Bunsen; and the Grimm brothers, whose stories have travelled from Hessen to the furthest corners of the globe. As the saying goes: other cities have a university – Marburg is a university."
