        "meta_description": "Laws guide societies in the world. These laws are meant to create an environment that ensures citizens’ rights are respected. The same happens in academia. There are guidelines that students follow in the execution of their assignments, examinations and research in higher institutions. These guidelines are meant to ensure that there is no any form of academic dishonesty being perpetuated by the students. This paper investigated Lusaka Apex Medical University students’ knowledge and attitude towards plagiarism. The study sought to assess the knowledge of LAMU students towards plagiarism, examine the attitude of LAMU students towards plagiarism, assess factors that foster plagiarism among students, and find out strategies to address plagiarism among students. Using descriptive research design and simple random sampling, quantitative and qualitative data was collected through Google form questionnaires shared in students’ whatsApp groups. Data were analyzed using Excel while qualitative data was analyzed thematically. Findings revealed that majority students had knowledge on plagiarism and showed copying from the internet as their major method of plagiarism. Accordingly, findings on factors influencing plagiarism showed limited time while the need for sensitization by students was indicated as a strategy to combat the vice.",
