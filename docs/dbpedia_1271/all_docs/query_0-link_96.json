It traces the development of the academic from medieval forms up to modern incarnations. The latter inhabit the research university, the origins of which this book seeks to illuminate. To do so, it casts light on bureaucratization and commodification— the twin engines of the rationalization and the disenchantment of the world. The research university forms part of this modern order, in which the visible and the rational triumphed over the oral and the traditional. But through the cunning of history (or something) the rationalized academic world that we now enjoy spared academic charisma. The period covered stretches from the Renaissance to Romanticism, with attention to the s to s. The research university originated in Protestant German lands and diﬀused globally in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. German academia thus provides the focus, to which English and Jesuit academics will oﬀer interesting points of contrast. The book deploys microanalyses of academic practices, not as a sop to palliate postmodern queasiness about grand narrative (which I plan to tell and especially of a Protestant Ethic), but in earnest. The origins of the research university lie in a transformation of academic manners by ministries and markets. German ministers of state and avatars of the market worked, as they saw it, to reform and modernize benighted academics. As a consequence of their eﬀorts, a joint bureaucratization and commodification of academic practices took place, from which the research university emerged. A German Protestant academic had to pass muster with bureaucratic or rationalized criteria for appointment, which included productivity in publication, diligence in teaching, and acceptable political views and lifestyle. But to achieve success, one also had to acquire fame, be in fashion, and display “originality,” a spark of genius, in writings. This became a new sort of 3\n\n  \n\n\n\nacademic charisma tied to writing for “applause” and “recognition.” The modern academic emerged, I shall argue, from the cultivation of this new legible charisma. But, despite the dominion of writing in modern academia, aspects of traditional oral culture persisted and, among other things, played an important role in fabricating reputation. A word now about the time periods under analysis here. By the “early modern era” historians typically mean the time from about / to /—the Renaissance, Baroque, and Enlightenment. Historians typically set the modern era per se as beginning with the French Revolution () and the Romantic era or Romanticism. This book concerns the great transformation of academic charisma and the gradual emergence of the research university from the Renaissance to Romanticism. A crucial time, as noted, was around the s to the s—the late Enlightenment and Romantic era, the onset of the modern era. I shall use “traditional” versus “modern” to contrast two academic regimes or orders. The modern is the research university. The traditional is what came before and endures in some ways and places. I intend the terms only descriptively. No simple opposition obtains between the modern and the traditional. Elements of traditional academic practices persist in the modern academic regime of research, for example, voting for academic appointments, as well as the use of personal connections to achieve academic ends of all sorts, licit or not. The rest of the chapter will discuss the analytical framework of the book, the empirical base of the book, and finally the structure of the book in its parts and chapters. T H E A NA LY T I CA L F R A M E W O R K\n\nMaterial Practices Figure . is from a famous sixteenth century work by Sebastian Münster. The illustration appears in that work at least twice, used for two diﬀerent universities. The scene depicted is thus conventional, as opposed to anyone’s lecture in particular. The windows and walls suggest a castle or a church. European academia had only metaphorically a tower, one of ivory. Its architecture was actually ecclesiastical in origin—and remains so for universities with nostalgia and the cash flow to accommodate it. The space thus has rather more spiritual than secular overtones. And, while relatively small, the space oﬀers little intimacy. The lecturer sits in a cathedra, a chair. The notion of a professorial chair stems from this. The cathedra had been, at first, where a bishop sat to teach.\n\n                  \n\n\n\n.. An academic lecture, from Sebastian Münster, Cosmographey; das ist /Beschreibung Aller Länder . . . , Basel,  [].\n\nThe church where his chair resided became by synecdoche a “cathedral.” Later canons, that is, high oﬃcials at cathedrals and other churches, also acquired what was called a cathedra or chair. From there it passed to professors, as the funding of professorships originated in medieval canonries. The professor sits in the chair here, symbolizing his chair. He lectures from a book to eight visible students, some by no means youths. Only the professor’s chair has a backrest. The students sit on simple benches. The lucky ones have a wall to lean against. Only one appears prepared to take notes. A few others look at papers or a book . . . We shall be interested in material practices, such as illustrated in figure ., apropos the emergence of the research university and the transformation of academic charisma. What is the diﬀerence between the layout and the intimacy of a lecture hall versus a seminar room? When did German academics, if ever, begin to have conversations in a setting called a seminar? Have academics always conducted master’s and doctor’s exams at tables? What was the provenance of these academic tables? When did students begin the practice of writing? Writing notes in lectures? Writing exams at desks? Writing papers for a seminar?\n\n  \n\n\n\nInterest in the material practices of academics reaches back at least to the German Kulturgeschichte of the nineteenth century. More recently what anthropologists and archaeologists have called “material culture” has received greater attention in regard to academia and science. Works by Michel Foucault, Jack Goody, and Bruno Latour, among others, have endeavored to illuminate epistemic practices from their material bases. Peter Becker and I have used the notion of “little tools of knowledge” to designate such studies.1 Material practices will be studied in this light in the chapters that follow. The transformation of academic charisma came about with or even through an armory of little tools—catalogues, charts, tables (of paper), reports, questionnaires, dossiers, and so on. Such things comprise the modern, mundane, bureaucratic repertoire of paperwork and much of the power of the modern academic comes from such trifles. Foucault wrote, “The constitution of tables was one of the great problems of scientific, political and economic technology in the eighteenth century . . . The table of the eighteenth century was at once a technique of power and a procedure of knowledge.”2 One can learn much from the material practices of academics—about the nature of academic work from the transformation of the lecture catalogue, about the constitution of the research library from the battle over its catalogues, about the commodification of academics from tables evaluating them, about the appointment of academics from the layout of the paperwork, about the doctor of philosophy from the iconography of title pages of dissertations, about the nature of exams from the nature of tables as wooden or paper. Modern Metaphysics At least since Hegel’s Philosophie der Geschichte, a tradition of thought has held that the essential dialectic of the Middle Ages was that between Church and State, while that of the modern era is or was between State and Society, between the public and the private. The latter two terms, to be sure, are fraught with the weight of history, but cannot be avoided. Karl Marx’s notorious “On the Jewish Question” (Zur Judenfrage) gave the modern distinction between the public and the private, vis-à-vis the traditional opposition between Church and State, a most piquant formulation. Political emancipation of religious minorities had become possible in Europe, he held, because religion had been moved from the public sphere of the state into the private sphere of civil society. Science and academia had lost their old ecclesiastical or theological foundations as part of this transformation. Religion should now concern an academic or scientist only in their\n\n                  \n\n\n\nprivate persona, thus not qua academic or scientist. An academic or scientist now embodied a disinterested professional persona. In this sense, academia first lost its theological, transcendental mission in the Enlightenment.3 In the modern metaphysics of research, a cool, objective, meritocratic, professional self suppresses the passionately interested, collegially motivated, nepotistic, old-fashioned, traditional academic self. This modern schizophrenia is demanded of many professionals in the modern era. Max Weber saw it as willed by both bureaucratic and capitalistic interests. Bureaucracy, in its perfection, stands in a specific sense also under the principle sine ira ac studio [without anger or interest]. Its specific quality, quite welcome to capitalism, develops itself all the more perfectly the more it “dehumanizes,” the more perfectly, that is, that its specific feature, prized as its virtue, succeeds: exclusion of love, hate, all the purely political and above all the irrational emotional elements resisting calculation . . . Instead of personal interest, favor, grace, and gratitude motivating the lords of older [traditional] orders, modern culture, the more complex and specialized it becomes, demands all the more the personally disinterested, so strictly “objective” expert (“sachlichen” Fachmann).4\n\nThe modern bureaucratic distinction allowing the formation of a publicprofessional, expert self, and its insulation from the interests and hobbies of the amateur, private self, lies in the distinction between the oﬃce and the home. That distinction is largely absent in traditional societies or groups, in which nepotism, bribery, cheating, and other violations of oﬃce space, abhorrent to modern bureaucratic and academic regimes, are a way of life. Many fraternities at American universities resemble traditional groups in this sense. Student culture long resisted—still resists—the separation of public and private selves and spaces, understandable since most students make love and study in the same room. The modern schizophrenia must be forced on each generation. Those who work at home, including academics in the low-tech, humanistic disciplines, fall prey to archaic behavior all the time, confusing themselves with their work. The expansion of laboratories in the nineteenth century, and the massive scale that many acquired in the twentieth century, made the separation of the oﬃce or workplace from the home somewhat easier for most scientists. Marxists called this “alienated labor”: when one is at home, one is not at work, and when one is at work, one is not at home. There were many good things about alienated labor, including the meritocratic practices that allowed excluded groups in Europe—especially women and Jews—into the academic world. But bureaucratic and entrepreneurial interests did not gen-\n\n  \n\n\n\nerally advance this alienation and rationalization of academic life (making it rather academic labor, as life was now a private matter) for egalitarian reasons, such as integrating excluded groups. German managerial or bureaucratic capitalism, working with the “Protestant Ethic,” had other objectives in the modern metaphysics of the oﬃce and the professional persona that produced the research university and the new academic charisma. But back to Hegel. One aim of this book is to illuminate the transformation of the traditional or medieval juridico-ecclesiastical academic world into the modern politico-economic regime of research. The juridicoecclesiastical mentality reflects a society in which Church and State predominate; the politico-economic mentality one in which State and Society, the public and the private, do. Many chapters to follow have, thus, a twofold goal. First, to set out the originally juridico-ecclesiastical understanding of academic life and practices: traditional academia was invested with a theological or religious as well as with a juridical or legalistic cast. Such a juridico-ecclesiastical academic order fused the public and the private. Second, to elucidate the transformation of academic practices into our politico-economic world: it is here that the public and the private become separated, here that the study becomes the oﬃce, here that things like nepotism and patronage give way to merit. The politico-economic (or “cameralistic”) world is that of ministries and markets. The study becomes the oﬃce, but with a window on the market. In the traditional academic order, charisma had inhered in the juridicotheological cast of academic life. In the modern politico-economic regime, academic charisma comes much from certain labors loved by the market. Tradition and Rationalization This study employs Weber’s notion of three sorts of legitimate authority: the charismatic, the traditional, and the rational. Weber uses the German word Herrschaft, which he specifies in one place as being equivalent with the Latinate word Auctorität (authority). One usually follows Weber’s suggestion and speaks in English of the three sorts of legitimate authority, although the German Herrschaft, which is “lordship” in old-fashioned English, more precisely means dominion. I shall largely follow general practice and speak of legitimate authority here. But I shall often reduce the notions elliptically to substantives: charisma, tradition, and—in place of rationality—rationalization. As part of the analytical framework, these notions help elucidate how medieval and early modern academics became “modern.”5 In this section, I shall discuss tradition and rationalization in a general\n\n                  \n\n\n\nway, and then discuss the latter more specifically in reference to a few historical examples of German practices. Much of this book centers on exhibiting the older juridico-ecclesiastical academic order as one legitimated by traditional authority, while the politico-economic regime of modern research legitimates itself by rational authority—or, rather, it rationalizes. The next section will take up the matter of charisma and its persistence in modern academia. As a paradigm of traditional authority one could take groups whose structure, despite many complexities, is family-like. Chapters to follow will show that early modern academic faculties and colleges, like craft guilds and kindreds, had a family-like structure at base. The collegial manners—the practices and institutions—of academic faculties and colleges embodied traditional authority. Early modern academic appointments, for example, were largely governed by nepotism, favor, seniority, gifts, and other such collegial practices which, unlike the family strictly taken, usually included voting as a central practice. Academics typically obtained positions via a vote by a faculty or college or group of electors. A vote manifested the collegial will of the body. By dint of the traditional authority vested in such collegial will, legitimately ascertained and manifested, an academic held his oﬃce legitimately, even if the oﬃce had been won chiefly in view of nepotism or seniority or gifts—all traditional academic manners in a world that fused the public and private. Most chapters of this book will exhibit the traditions or manners of early modern academics, and then show how ministries and markets worked to rationalize such practices—how bureaucratic and entrepreneurial interests worked to alter or subvert the traditional authority of faculties and colleges. In place of the traditions of academics, reformers wished to install the “rational” authority of ministries and markets—to instill their rationalizations. Weber says, “Bureaucratic administration means: authority (Herrschaft) by dint of knowledge—that is its specific fundamental character.” Rationalization or rational authority substitutes supposedly adjudicated knowledge for the simple will of traditional authority. Bureaucracy has a “rational” character: rule, aim, means, “objective” (sachliche) disinterestedness dominate its behavior. Its emergence and diﬀusion has thus had everywhere . . . a “revolutionary” eﬀect, just as the march of Rationalism tends to do generally in all domains.\n\nRationalizing charisma, fashioning experts, stems not only from bureaucratic bodies.\n\n  \n\n\n\nSuperior to the bureaucracy in knowledge—expert knowledge and acquaintance with facts within the relevant sphere . . .—is usually only the profit seeker, that is, the capitalist entrepreneur. That is the only really (at least relatively) immune instance in the face of the inescapability of the bureaucratic rational domination of knowledge. All other instances have fallen inescapably into mass organizations under bureaucratic domination, just like mass production under the domination of . . . precision machines.6\n\nRationalizations by bureaucratic and capitalist precision machines have recast academic life. The two great engines of rationalization have thus been the ministry and the market—in their modern forms, state bureaucracy and managerial capitalism. If one wishes to grasp the origins of the research university, freed of Romantic and other contemporary ideologies, then one must be prepared to reconsider an old grand narrative with fresh ears.           . In chapters throughout this book, we’ll find the visible hand of German state ministries in projects to reform academic practices. As noted, ministers aimed to substitute their agenda and putative rational authority for the traditional authority of academic groups. The genesis of the modern researcher lies, in part, in such ministerial reformations. The diﬀusion of this bureaucratic persona into other national contexts is another matter. In the epilogue, we shall consider the matter but, alas, only outline its contours there. Here we’ll consider the ministerial or bureaucratic mentality that drove German academic reformations. To that end, let us inquire whence bureaucrats and take BrandenburgPrussia as a handy example. Friedrich Wilhelm and Friedrich I reigned there from  to . The “new bureaucrat,” as a social type, was well represented by the aides of Frederick Wilhelm, the Elector, and of his immediate successor. These restless, intensely selfish men played their cards with cold-blooded eﬃciency. They were ardent collectors of tips, bribes, and valuable gifts. They had to be unscrupulous, ever suspicious, sharp-witted careerists to come out on top for a while in the turmoil.7\n\nThus they were typical Baroque courtiers, traditional aristocrats, like the modern mafia. Friedrich Wilhelm I and Friedrich the Great thereafter ruled BrandenburgPrussia from  to . They tried to turn the cold-blooded courtier careerists and collectors of tips, bribes, and gifts from the previous two reigns into enlightened public servants. The Prussian kings considered the virtue of meritocracy over aristocracy for public service.\n\n                  \n\n\n\nThe famous edict of  December  on the Prussian General Directory said of such servants, “They must be as talented as can be found far and wide, and of evangelical-reformed or Lutheran confession, who are loyal and honest, who have open minds, who understand economics and engage in it themselves.” Rational authority was in the air here and the king was seeking to cultivate a distinction in his ministers between their private lives and interests, as opposed to their public duties and oﬃces—which was hard to do in aristocrats.8 Friedrich Wilhelm I militarized the ministry, so to speak. He looked for competence in the field. He preferred the middle-class citizen with talent to the noble with none. He put the notion of meritocracy onto a courtly system that was still essentially one of patronage. In  for the General Directory, he even set oﬃce hours on the four days per week when ministers met. In summer they were to be at the “oﬃce” by seven o’clock in the morning and in winter at eight. Upon their complaints, the good king reset the first morning hour to nine o’clock. The king did not set the time at which ministers’ service ended each day. But given his stipulations about their noontime meal, he presumed they would usually only work to one or two in the afternoon. This being-at-the-oﬃce was, moreover, not yet the bureaucrat’s oﬃce as specialized and insulated space from which private life and personal interests might be kept distant. Ministers rather worked with the king in one large room, each ministry or department given only its own separate table— a crucial little tool. Despite the qualifications, the above “indicates a turning point in the external position of high oﬃceholders. From a part-time occupation of well endowed gentlemen . . . a profession with fixed oﬃce hours has arisen.”9 The king’s son, Friedrich the Great, said, “The king is the first servant of the state.” But his ministries took a return in the direction of aristocracy, where a distinction between public and private became cloudy again. The new king, at least before , did not heed the advice of the cameralists— to whom we turn soon—on meritocracy in public service. After , two systems arose. There was an aristocratic, courtly system, based on connections, gifts, and favors, and mostly for higher subjects and oﬃces, versus a bourgeois, bureaucratic system, based on examination, work, and merit, and mostly for mid- to lower subjects and oﬃces. This second system fit the rationalizing winds blowing over academia. In Prussia and elsewhere in the German lands, the rationalization of academic life took place within the framework of bureaucratization and good policing, as it was called.10\n\n  \n\n\n\n              . The theorists of this were the cameralists. That is what or who the Germans had instead of the British political economists or the French physiocrats. “A cameralist must be an economist and an expert on policing,” said Johann Justi, who held that the end of good policing lay in promoting the “culture of the lands.” Justi and others considered an essential part of cameralism to be what they called police science, PoliceyWissenschaft.11 Good policing faced a three-fold task by Justi’s lights: to see that useful arts, sciences, and crafts were learnt; to insure that resources were not wasted; and to make sure there was no idleness. Sonnenfels, an Austrian cameralist and police scientist, said, “The sciences constitute an important part of education, and so considered become a subject of police provision.” The Prussian cameralist Zincke agreed that schools were “actually a police institution (Policey-Anstalt).” The culture of the lands thus entailed the good policing of schools and academic institutions which, despite reservations, the enlightened cameralists and police scientists treated like any other form of social and economic production.12 Justi was the Adam Smith of police science, so his views on the administration of academia are worth some time. Cameralist analyses and ideologies not only help to explicate the origins of the research university, but also historically helped solidify and diﬀuse its rational practices. Justi’s views below follow from general principles of police science.13 The state, he holds, must set up inspectors for wares, as well as a system of seals or labels to indicate ranges of excellence in products. When the state notices that some products, including academic ones, are inferior, then prizes and payments ought to be instituted to encourage invention. External experts should also be brought in, “since for money one can obtain everything,” even academics (or, if not, one needs to manufacture that sort). Good policing insures that the state’s religion is not subverted and sees to the diligence of subjects. So a regulation of holidays is important, for there must not be too many. Guilds are old-fashioned groups. “One tends to call the improved sort of occupations that have first been introduced in modern times ‘manufactures’ and ‘factories.’” Guilds (like academic faculties) are ineﬃcient due to odd ceremonies, archaic production methods, and conservatism. Mastership too often comes from connections, and is given on the basis of “sumptuous masterpieces, never useful for normal life, and not at all given in view of diligence and true talent.” But the rational state should not try to manage everything. Ministers should facilitate entrepreneurs who undertake ventures on their own. Mines provide a good example. The sovereign should supervise\n\n                  \n\n\n\nmines as well as universities. But to stimulate mining, there must be a free mining industry, so individuals will hunt for minerals. Miners, like academics, need some freedom of action, and the sovereign should give up mining per se, even though the industry works under sovereign auspices. The point of universities for Justi and other cameralists is to make students useful as future tools—servants of the state and upright citizens. If universities had merely the goal to improve citizens’ understanding and widen human knowledge, then one would need no public funding for institutions of such little benefit to the state and common good. Police science advises ministers to stamp out pedantry. Academics who teach at state institutions must be chosen from the best and most famous, and chosen not in view of connections or gifts, but rather for their talent and merits. The ministry will take care that all the chief sciences are taught and that professors lecture in a fluid and pleasant manner.14 The state gets more from academics if it oﬀers them moderate amounts of money and, as compensation, accords them largely ceremonial honors. The wise minister manages academics through their vanity. One gives them “a gracious audience, a short chat,” and if an academic is “in the list of the king’s little entourage,” this has a greater eﬀect than “when great sums of money go out of the treasury for the promotion of science.” And like miners, academics need some freedom. “When we consider the nature of the sciences, as well as the history of learning from all times and lands, we find that sciences ever grow when they [academics] have reasonable freedom to think.” That is cameralist-capitalistic policy.15         . Within the superstructure of policing ministerially imposed, cameralists and police scientists called for an insulated infrastructure of entrepreneurial activity. Academia was treated like mining, and vice versa. Cameralists favored the cultivation of a sphere of academic freedom within the broader sphere of state supervision. This academic freedom was not posited in view of any Romantic notions about academia as a realm of culture. The cameralists were thinkers of the Enlightenment, that is, coldblooded pragmatists. The insertion of academia within the market or, rather, the cultivation of a market in academia, was by no means self-evident. And it was above all a Protestant phenomenon. Such a commodification of academia did eventually penetrate German Catholic lands (and in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the “free world”). But some resisted it for a time. The Austrians, for example, did so. Good pupils of the Jesuits, the Austrians at first favored a radical rationalization of academic practices, based wholly on meritocracy. Irrational things such as the fame won by publication in the\n\n  \n\n\n\nvery poorly policed Republic of Letters—which the cameralists saw as, in fact, a market—had no real place in an academic meritocracy.16 In chapters to follow, we’ll look at the emergence and character of market phenomena in German academic practices. We’ll see that the market insinuated itself between the home and the oﬃce. It called forth a new side or self within the academic. Let us call the “public” self that which is supposed to inhabit the oﬃce, striving for objectivity, impartiality, impersonality, and the public good, and distancing itself from private interests. Call the “private” self that which inhabits the home, thus able to cultivate private, personal, intimate interests. Given such definitions, the market induced a private-public self, a sort of third man or body mercantile, fraught with oxymoronic and odd qualities, as well as much charisma.17 German Protestant ministries demanded that academics obtain “applause” and achieve fame in order to be appointed or advanced at the university. But, as one of the great riddles of history, German Protestant ministries decided that, while they recognized academic applause and fame, they did not manufacture it. They left that feat not only to expert or peer review, a mysterious modern institution, but also to instruments of the market, such as the review press, where the new private-public self or the academic’s third body circulated. A new sort of academic charisma radiated from that circulation. Academic Charisma Charisma provides a counterpart to the motifs of rationalization and disenchantment. The notion of charisma comes from Weber. I’ll give a brief sketch of it. Then, using the example of professorial charisma, I’ll indicate the sense and scope of charisma in this book.      ’          . Weber never wrote a treatise about it, but the notion appears in important works and crucial places. This allows for learned disputes about Weber’s theory of charisma and whether such a thing exists, as opposed to a congeries of perhaps contradictory notions developed over time in diﬀerent contexts. I shall thus present salient and relevant aspects of Weber’s notion of charisma, without refereeing scholarship about it, and without worrying about the orthodoxy of my sketch and later use of “charisma” regarding academics.18 Weber’s writings on religion and his writings on politics and economics provide the two major contexts for grasping Weberian charisma. In the realm of religion, charisma, for him, bears evident traces of magic. The original charismatic religious figure was the sorcerer, then later the priest and especially the prophet, the herald of a new cult. Regarding academia,\n\n                  \n\n\n\npart of academic charisma sprang from this topos—the teacher as spiritual or cultic leader. In the sphere of politics and economics, the original charismatic figure was the warrior, then later the general or king. Part of academic charisma sprang from this topos—the martial, agonistic, polemical cast of academic knowledge as it developed in medieval Europe. A charismatic figure possesses above all power. For sorcerers, the power consists in their supposed ability to control nature or humans. The modern scientist as a “wizard” in popular culture disposes over traces of this charisma. Other figures, such as athletes and actors, display more nebulous sorts of charisma. But, in general, a person exudes charisma because he or she succeeds as a leader, a hero or Führer, in religious, martial, or other arts. Charisma thus emerges from and inheres in a social relation. A group of people ascribes certain extraordinary abilities or powers to a person. That person has charisma in relation to the ascribing group, whose members become active or passive disciples or followers or fans. There is an historical trajectory from charisma, to tradition, to rationality only perhaps in Weber’s analysis of the sorcerer. In this context, charisma collapses mostly into magic and may inhere, seemingly properly, in objects as well as in persons. Charisma here resembles a fetish.19 But, on the whole, Weber holds that charisma inheres properly only in persons. When it crystallizes in things—such as in a professorial chair, for example—the object is not a fetish, but only a means to convey charisma, which is always exercised or exuded by a person or group. Moreover, every society in every time and every place interweaves a complex fabric of charismatic, traditional, and rational authority. The anthropologically and historically primary sort of authority is not the charismatic, but the traditional, which, to put it crudely, most resembles the patterned behavior of animals: progeny or descendents behave the way they do because their progenitors or ancestors behaved that way. In relation to the traditional, both the charismatic and the rational represent disruptive or revolutionary forces. In the extreme case, a charismatic figure arises to oppose and overturn the tradition. A Jewish prophet announces a new covenant. A Roman general marches his army on Rome. Charismatic authority thus faces the dilemma of the next generation. Permanent revolution will obtain, unless one finds a way to convey charisma from the leader to the disciples. In the latter case, words or blood or titles or oﬃces often come to convey charisma. To secure stability, charismatic authority thus transmutes to an extent into traditional authority, which in a backhanded way indicates the charismatic base of some or much traditional authority. The rational shares with the traditional the virtue of stability. Rational\n\n  \n\n\n\nauthority or rationalization—such as embodied in state bureaucracies and managerial capitalism—have the power to alter or even revolutionize a traditional social order, but achieve relative social stability at the same time. Rationalization replaces simple historical or inherited or brute patterns of behavior with other patterns; it can, however, rationalize and legitimate them by appeal to reason: it is more “eﬃcient” or more “productive” or more “politically correct” or simply more “rational” to behave this way, instead of what traditions dictate. In Europe at least, historical development since the Middle Ages has expanded the sphere of rational authority, at the expense of the traditional, and perhaps the charismatic, too. Weber’s thesis of the disenchantment of the world—since Europe came to dominate it after the Middle Ages—forms the obverse of the thesis of the expansion of rationalization in Europe. The notion of “disenchantment” puts the decline of magic at center stage here. If one associates charisma with magic, then one tends to conclude that the trajectory of history has led to the decline of the charismatic in modern society. But rationality can be charismatic. The Enlightenment epitomized and liquidated itself here: “the charismatic transfiguration of ‘reason’ (which found its characteristic expression in the apotheosis of reason by Robespierre) is the last form that charisma has taken altogether in its fateful path.”20 In the most general sense, charisma is not magical. It is, rather, the opposite of the quotidian, the normal, the routine, the mundane, the profane. As noted a few times above, a charismatic figure has and exudes something extra-ordinary. The appearance of a figure such as Hitler (or Robespierre) indicates that a bureaucratized society can fall under the sway all too easily of the charisma of a demagogue or tyrant. One of this book’s aims is to consider to what extent we should see the emergence of the Romantic cult of personality at the modern university, including the rise of the notion of the academic or scientific “genius,” in terms of a Weberian charismatic transfiguration of reason.21                     . This book treats professorial charisma at length. The research university stems from the German university system, as opposed to, for example, the English. The German university was a professorial university; the English was a collegiate university in which professors played a marginal role until the twentieth century. In the preGermanic period of Oxford and Cambridge, other academics—such as the heads of houses, the tutors, the fellows, later the dons—played a more important role than the professors, as the collegiate university was centered around colleges and their masters. In this book, we shall look at academic charisma in general. But, because the German research university provides\n\n                  \n\n\n\nthe second major theme, the particular academics who governed it receive more attention. At the traditional university, as we’ll see in detail in chapters to follow, a professor embodied traditional authority. For example, as noted above, one became a professor usually in good part thanks to the vote of some committee or electoral college. Voting represented no rational process, but was simply traditional in certain societies for obtaining consensus and expressing the will of a group. The vote expressed more about the committee or college than it did about the elected person. The person would reproduce the group and uphold tradition. At the research university in its original German form, a professor was to embody rational authority. The ministry decided who would become a professor. It based its decision, oﬃcially, not on a vote, but rather on informed consideration of the advice of relevant specialists and the ministry’s knowledge of the field and available academics. In this case, the professor would reproduce not a group in the first instance, but a system. That is, however, not the end of the story. This book aims to illuminate the charisma embodied in the traditional university and, more importantly, the charisma preserved or newly created by the research university. A central thesis here is that, like modern capitalism, the research university achieved an amazing “dynamic equilibrium” (M. Norton Wise) by the cultivation of charismatic figures within a broader sphere of rationalization. As noted, the entrepreneurial domain of activity within a bureaucratic superstructure, envisaged by the cameralists, constitutes one aspect of this dynamic stability.22 But we turn here first to the traditional university, which abhorred charismatic individuals. Charisma functioned on the whole to uphold and validate the tradition, and thus realized itself largely as routinized or crystallized charisma, vested in clothing, chairs, books, oﬃces, titles, and the like. For example, as we’ll see, professors and lecturers at the traditional university tended to use the textbooks used by their teachers, who had used the textbooks used by their teachers, and so on. In other words, curricula did not change much, at least oﬃcially. When charismatic individuals appeared such as William of Ockham or René Descartes, who assailed the curriculum, its sacred nature as a canon became manifest. Like the liturgy, the academic or scholastic canon embodied crystallized or routinized charisma. To assail it and succeed made one a hero of knowledge, founder of a new canon. A charismatic figure succeeds, as noted, by finding disciples, who establish a new tradition or canon. To assail the canon and fail usually made one an academic or actual heretic.\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe traditional university usually reacted decidedly hostilely to prophets or heroes who departed from the script, that is, the canon. The juridicoecclesiastical regime, discussed above, instantiated the charisma. Academic degrees, such as the doctor of medicine, academic titles, such as professor of history, and academic oﬃces, such as dean of the Law Faculty, conveyed charisma to their bearers in a framework on the model of clerical orders and chivalrous knighthood. The section on material practices above noted the professorial chair or cathedra. This conveyed substantial charisma to its holder, for very few could legitimately sit in this chair and teach with recognized authority on canonical texts. In short, as vested in clothing, books, furniture, titles, and so on, charisma at the traditional university served to uphold authority by sanctifying traditions and diﬀerentiating academics as a group from other groups in society. The traditional university resisted the charismatic individual for the sake of a charismatic collective. And when an Ockham or a Descartes appeared on the scene, the eﬀects mirrored those of successful prophets or revolutionaries. The strength of the modern research university consists in its ability to rationalize and routinize such prophecy and revolution, to make equilibrium dynamic. The politico-economic cast of the modern university dissolved most of the charisma vested in juridico-ecclesiastical institutions and mentalities. German academics, for example, cast oﬀ academic costume by the eighteenth century and began to dress like the bourgeoisie. Traditional academic costume came out of the closet only on highly ceremonial occasions. Some academics find parts of the curriculum canonical thus sacred to this day; but academics at many universities began changing textbooks virtually at will in the eighteenth century. Over time, only bureaucratic inertia stood in the way of curricular change. Chapters below will consider how academic degrees and titles survived and what they came to mean in the modern academic world. Certain oﬃces, such as the deanship, can convey an impressive bit of charisma to this day. But much academic business became and is just bureaucratic. Alongside the vestiges of academic charisma from the traditional university, new sorts appeared, and many chapters to follow undertake to explicate them. For example, at German universities collegial voting no longer appointed professors, nor did civil service examinations appoint them, as one might expect in a fully rationalized meritocratic system. Above, we noted the role of the market in modern academia. But the ministry made the final decision on appointments. It grasped the process as one of “recognition”: the ministry recognizes the “right person” for the position. This no-\n\n                  \n\n\n\ntion of recognizing the right person was fundamentally new in academic appointments, but harkens back to notions of the recognition of the successor to a charismatic leader, which itself requires charisma to accomplish. At places like Harvard University, the process eventually developed to recognizing not only the right but also the “best person,” presumably on earth.23 Academic charisma at the research university inheres more in individuals than in collective, corporate, collegial bodies—that is the scandal of the research university from the perspective of traditional academia. A professorial chair conveys much of its traditional charisma to this day. But, if an Isaac Newton or an Immanuel Kant has sat in a particular chair, then the ghost or spirit of that individually famous academic infuses the chair. One of Stephen Hawking’s many claims to fame today is that he occupies “Newton’s chair.” Moreover, an academic enhances charisma not collectively or collegially, but rather by directing an institute or having a center through which to realize academic projects. In many chapters to follow, we’ll have occasion to observe the modern cult of academic personality. Narrative and Calculation, Irony and Nostalgia “From its origin, science has been in conflict with narratives,” as JeanFrançois Lyotard has written. By “narratives” he means oral storytelling. This dictum can be taken to mean that science has been trying to turn the oral world into the visual. Modern science and academic knowledge generally seem to be subversive of oral culture and of narrative. In our Weberian terms above, narrative typically serves as a resource or tool of traditional authority, a tool to which, for complex reasons, modern rational authority appears to be rather hostile.24 In chapters to follow, we shall see that many ministerial rationalizations of academic labor deployed—appropriately so—a “ratio”: devices for calculation, broadly conceived. Thus, as noted above, the modern academic and bureaucratic world avails itself of an arsenal of little tools, such as lists, tables, charts, graphs, maps, and so on. These calculating devices not only oﬀer the instruments for the rationalization of life and labor, but they also appear to supplant or subvert or even destroy traditional narratives and oral cultures. In a number of chapters, we shall thus consider the apparent intolerance of calculators for narrators. Despite the modern programmatic hostility to narration or oral culture, Hayden White sees narrative as a protean and nearly omnipresent force, an ineluctable disposition, present at all times and places, and in all groups, including those of modern scholars and scientists. Lyotard perhaps would\n\n  \n\n\n\nhave argued the same, at least in La conditione postmoderne, where narrative played an important role in forging the social bonds of groups, something that tools of calculation seem unable to do. In other words, even the radical rationalizers tell stories.25 In that spirit, some chapters below will look for stories and “read for the plot” in a number of perhaps unlikely places. I shall be concerned in particular, on the one hand, to examine how certain ministerial or academic tools achieve and enforce the separation of public and private selves. But I shall also attend, on the other hand, to illuminating how other ministerial or academic devices serve as narratives to eﬀect the same separation. So in chapter , for example, I shall read a ministerial diary or journal as a narrative device that accomplished the suppression of a private, domestic self from a professional, public one. That analysis, like many here, will be full of irony. The modern academic regime of research seems to be more or less as hostile to that as it is to narration. Irony and nostalgia play fundamental roles in this study of academics and their charisma. Each oﬀers an antidote to the other. But each serves a separate purpose, and I could not delete the one without deleting the other. This book contains criticism of the sort of academic life and labor that has descended upon us from the German university system. Part of this critique may be motivated by a vague nostalgia for a golden age of college life. Such nostalgia can perhaps lead one to the antipodes of the Germanic university as potential resources to help remedy the ills of contemporary academia. But that is another matter and exceeds the rationale of this book, albeit desiring to oﬀer a history of the present, but still a history, and not a manual of action. Nostalgia must thus be leavened with irony. The presence of that trope is overdetermined in this work. Irony expresses and conceals a love-hate relationship with most of the principal entities involved in this study: the Germans and the Austrians, the English and the Jesuits, the Enlightenment and Romanticism, rationality and charisma, academia and me. The productivity of such ambivalence has been an important theme since Freud. Irony also itself became important in the time and place on which this study most focuses—the German cultural space in the s to s.26 Despite the apparent hostility of the ethos of research, irony is for me, moreover, an essential academic attitude about academia, that is, the essence of reflexivity. I do not know when this became so. We probably do not have this attitude from Akademos, the legendary hero whose name we bear. But perhaps it is as old as Socratic epistemic self-reference.27\n\n                  \n\n\n\nOn the subject of alleged academic corrupters, I shall end this part with one of my favorite anecdotes. It well illustrates the sorts of materials and mentalities with which I have immersed myself quixotically for several decades, and from which this study and its irony arose. In the mid s, Austrian elites and academics had had enough of being dominated by the Jesuits. Empress Maria Theresa thus allowed ministers and academics outside the order to take charge over Austrian educational and cultural aﬀairs. In the spirit of the Jesuits, however, the Austrians produced their own catalogue of forbidden books, which they published as Catalogus Librorum rejectorum per Consessum Censurae in Vienna in . A revised catalogue appeared from the commission on censorship annually from  through . The composition and publication of the catalogue of forbidden books became thereafter rather complicated, as new editions of it appeared alongside supplements and revisions, some issued by the commission’s press and others by private publishers. In the s and s, various editions of the catalogue forbade works by Gottsched, Lessing, Moser, Mendelssohn, Wieland, Voß, and of course by Goethe, whose Die Leiden des jungen Werthers, a best seller, made the Austrian index of forbidden books, which itself soon became popular. It is not clear whether it became a sort of honor to be in the Austrian catalogue of forbidden books. But it does appear that the catalogue and its many revisions caused heated competition in the market among publishers of diﬀerent editions. The catalogue also aﬀorded a means for a certain sort of academic and author to discover companions in the devil’s advocacy. In  the oﬃcial Austrian catalogue of forbidden books thus forbade itself.28 T H E EM P I R I CA L B A S E\n\nParts of the discussion above have implicitly indicated elements of the empirical base—aspects of the material culture of academics, such as chairs and books; practices of traditional academia, such as protocols of voting; bureaucratic innovations, such as ministerial surveys to recognize the right academics; the cult of academic personality, as vested in citations, institutes, and so on. Here I shall discuss a sort of ethnographic empirical base. As noted, the German lands constitute the center of the analysis, for which Jesuit and English academics oﬀer interesting points of comparison and contrast. In the plot of this book, the Jesuits will play the most radical rationalizers, while the English strive to uphold the tradition. This casting puts the Germans and their ilk in the middle of things.\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe English The fellows or monks of my time [at Oxford] were decent easy men who supinely enjoyed the gifts of the founder. Their days were filled by a series of uniform employments: the Chappel and the Hall, the Coﬀee house, and the common room, till they retired, weary and well-satisfied, to a long slumber. From the toil of reading or thinking or writing they had absolved their conscience, and the first shoots of learning and ingenuity withered on the ground without yielding any fruit to the owners or the public.29\n\nUntil the nineteenth century, England had only two universities—the large and rather well known ones at Oxford and Cambridge, collectively called “Oxbridge.” Some might find that this book has royally skewered Oxbridge. But the fact of the matter is that the seeming skewering here rather results from eﬀects of irony in masking nostalgia. The latter naturally attends Oxbridge as an academic paradise lost—or, rather, as a utopia fantasized by alienated labor. Oxbridge possesses a long academic tradition, but on the whole an inglorious one. Relatively few academics seem to be aware of that. It would appear that most academics even believe the opposite, a false belief of which, during visits to Oxford or Cambridge, one is usually not disabused by friendly fellows, most of whom doubtless know much better. Why has Oxbridge enjoyed such a wildly inflated reputation, essentially undeserved, at least between  and ? “Architecturally, by the end of the sixteenth century, the colleges were the most striking feature of Oxford and Cambridge. Visitors usually remarked on their size and sumptuousness.” As they still do. The most common word out of the mouths of Anglophone academic tourists is “quaint.” (I wonder often what that is in Japanese.) The colleges are quaint, and their fellows not nearly so odd now as they once were. Like Mad Ludwig’s royal Bavarian castles, modern Oxbridge’s fame grew from the tourist industry and, now, is a great beneficiary of the nostalgia induced by our modern Germanic regime.30 The modern marketing of Oxford began as early as the late seventeenth century. In view of the traditional naiveté of its fellows, it is possible that they knew not what they had wrought. The Germans would have. Three nice publications emerged from Oxford from  to , thus barely missing an annus mirabilis. The first was Anthony Wood’s Historia et antiquitates oxoniensis, and the second was Thomas Hyde’s Catalogus impressorum librorum bibliothecae bodleianae, both of . David Loggan’s Oxonia illustrata, in which the colleges were depicted in all their quaintness, appeared as the third work in .31\n\n                  \n\n\n\n.. Corpus Christi College, Oxford, from David Loggan, Oxonia illustrata, Oxford, .\n\nFigure . shows Loggan’s illustration of Corpus Christi College. The unfortunate vertical line down the middle comes from the fact that the illustration occupies two whole pages in Loggan’s already large format volume. Such buildings were and are still magnificent. If not marketing, it is hard to see what the point of the Loggan’s sumptuous publication was— institutional narcissism? It proved, however, a clever ploy and drove that other university to commission Cantabrigia illustrata, published by Loggan in . Historians of Oxbridge sometimes cite remarks of Zacharias Conrad von Uﬀenbach, based on his visit to Oxford and Cambridge in . His travel memoir contains much of interest that only an outsider would notice. But, as he sang no praises to the sacred cows of English academic culture, one sighs at his tone. “In general I must report about Cambridge that the place itself is not so big, and is as poor as a small village . . . and, if the fine colleges were not in such abundance here, it would be the most miserable place in the world. One is also poorly accommodated.” Oxford, as he noted, was indeed larger but, save its fine colleges, only a larger version of Cambridge.32 What of the most numerous of the early modern Oxbridge academics themselves? A twentieth century historian echoed Gibbon’s withering depiction from the eighteenth century.\n\n  \n\n\n\nMuch has been written about the Fellows of the eighteenth century, and most of it is not to their credit. They stand accused of wasting their time and opportunities . . . But the Fellows can be reproached with more than lack of scholarship and industry. Far too many of them led frankly selfindulgent lives and did not trouble to conceal their shortcomings . . . Indeed the pleasures of the table loomed large in their lives, and, even when they did not grossly exceed, they were disinclined to curb their appetites.33\n\nThe eighteenth century is usually taken as the nadir of Cambridge’s history, as it is of Oxford’s, too. I suspect, however, that the college fellows of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were given neither less to leisure and pleasure, nor more to work and study. Thus it is that the English and Oxbridge have been chosen to embody paradise lost, a nostalgic foil to Jesuitical and Germanic rationalizations. It remains to be seen in chapters to follow whether Oxbridge will play the ultratraditionalist role for which I have cast it. The Jesuits “If I see white, I would believe it to be black, if it were so defined by the Church hierarchy,” as reads Rule  of Loyola’s Exercitia spiritualia, perhaps one of the more famous dicta of the early modern era. Few secular academics seem to exhibit nostalgia for Jesuiticism. The Jesuits were fierce figures. They bore some striking similarities to English academics.34 Figure . is Matthäus Merian’s seventeenth-century depiction of the Jesuit college and church in Munich. Smaller and more regular in the growth of its additions than Corpus Christi Oxford, the Jesuit college exhibits the same monastic quad at base. A well-traveled visitor, exaggerating a bit, said in  of the Munich college, “Of all that the Jesuits’ possess in the whole world, this college is the most magnificent.” Few academic structures in the entire German lands could rival this college until the nineteenth century.35 The Jesuits once loomed largely over academic Europe. They were kicked out of France in  and Spain in , then temporarily abolished in general by the pope in . Before that, if the Jesuits had not run the educational system of early modern Catholic Europe, they had dominated it. By  they had more than seven hundred institutions of higher learning, with over two hundred in Central Europe. In the German Catholic lands, there was little the Jesuits did not control, till their suppression in . Only in Erfurt and Salzburg did German Catholic universities remain entirely free of Jesuits. And, where they did appear, they eventually wrested control of the the-\n\n                  \n\n\n\n.. Jesuit College, Munich, from Matthäus Merian, Topographia Germaniae.\n\nology and arts and philosophy (and sciences) faculties—the Jesuits did not do law or medicine. Despite some eﬀorts at accommodation with Protestants and others, the Jesuits oversaw a rival academic world until .36 Like the English, the Jesuits centered their academic system on the college—and a college lodged in the sort of building shown in figure ., but generally less imposing. Like English college fellows, Jesuit instructors remained celibate and clerical in habits. The typical Oxbridge fellow, unless a hopeless slacker or hardcore academic, was headed one day for a vicarage or parsonage. And in that sense, the fellows formed part of the Anglican civil service in the countryside, the secular-clerical pillars of the English state in the provinces. The Jesuits pursued this sort of clerical civil service more radically. Weber noted, The monk, the exemplary religious person, was also the first who lived in a methodical fashion, scheduled his time, practiced continuous self-control, rejected all spontaneous enjoyments, in order to do his duty . . . He was thus the first professional and destined to serve as the principal tool of bureaucratic centralization and rationalization.37\n\nThe Jesuits were “the last word, the ne plus ultra, in the organization” of the monastic or “regular” and secular religious orders that had appeared\n\n  \n\n\n\nduring the Middle Ages—the Benedictines, Cluniacs, Cistericians, Augustinians, Hospitallers, Templars, Franciscans, and Dominicans. The Jesuits emerged late, in the sixteenth century. They served as the tools and shock troops for the Catholic Counter-Reformation against the Protestant Reformation.38 As David Knowles noted, “In the traditional monasticism all postulants were received for membership of a single undiﬀerentiated community . . . In no case was there an oligarchy of talent,” until the Jesuits came on the scene. As we’ll see, the concept of meritocracy does not stem from traditional academia. Even in the Protestant lands, the notion of academic appointment and advancement by merit would have to be imposed on the whole by ministers and cameralists on reluctant academics. The Jesuits in fact helped pioneer the bureaucratic notion of meritocracy in academia. They play the arch-rationalizers in this book.39 It was no accident that the most thorough attempts at the bureaucratization of academic labor took place in Catholic lands with a Jesuitical past—Austria and France. “The bureaucratic spirit is a thoroughly Jesuitical . . . spirit. Bureaucrats are the Jesuits of the state, the state-theologians . . . Bureaucracy is a circle from which no one can escape. Its hierarchy is a hierarchy of knowledge.”40 The Germans The Germans, especially the Protestant ones, pursued a mediate way, a via media, between the English as the upholders of traditional academic mores and the Jesuits as the purveyors of a radical rationalization of academia. This characterization aims not to make the Protestant German way appear somehow the most sensible. To the contrary, as noted, most of the critique, veiled or not, in this book will grace this mediate path leading to the “Germanic” research university. The characterization rather aims to make central issues crystal clear. By the German lands, which I shall also call the “Germanies,” I mean the amorphous sociocultural space in Central Europe in which the German language held sway. That was not the political entity that would be known as Germany or the Second Reich after . Until the Second Reich came on the scene, the political landscape of Central Europe, especially before the nineteenth century, appeared as the most diverse in all Europe. Some parts, such as Austria, Bavaria, and Brandenburg-Prussia, were as large as large lands or even empires. Others, such as Canton-Basel, the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt am Main, and the once Free Imperial City of Straßburg (Strasbourg), were small city-states.\n\n                  \n\n\n\nI shall refer to all such entities collectively as the “Germanies.” For variation, I’ll refer at times to the Austro-German lands or German lands. Such terms also lack precision, since by the Late Middle Ages the German Swiss provinces, for example, were not part of those lands. One might refer to the Holy Roman Empire (Reich) of the German Nation(s), that old political entity to which most of the Germanies belonged, until Napoleon terminated it in . The problem with the “Empire” or the “First Reich” is that things like German-speaking Canton-Basel did not belong to it, while Czech-speaking Prague and Bohemia did, while German-speaking Königsberg and Prussia per se did not, and so on. Whence the line from Goethe’s Faust, “The dear Holy Roman Empire [of the German Nation], what keeps it still together?” (Das liebe heil’ge Röm’sche Reich, / Wie hält’s nur noch zusammen?)41 Thanks to their chaos, the Germanies formed the only large cultural or linguistic space in Europe in which both major early modern Christian confessions—Catholicism and Protestantism, chiefly the Evangelical and Reformed Churches, that is, Lutheranism and Calvinism—were represented in significant numbers. The confessional diﬀerences had ramifying academic diﬀerences. That makes the Germanies particularly propitious as an object of study, above and beyond the fact that the research university originated there. All too many universities populated the German cultural space—the land of universities and academics from the Late Middle Ages to the modern era. There is a list of the relevant (and some irrelevant) universities in appendix . Most will be mentioned here and there in chapters to follow, as examples of this or that. A few will prove to be most important for the story. But it seems better to let those become apparent simply as they do. The early modern English and German universities present pretty much the realm of the academically possible in Europe, which provides another ground for the decision to include Oxbridge in the analysis here. The English and German academic models embody polar opposites of a sort. If one understands those two chief academic systems, one can situate most—but not all—other early modern universities on a spectrum between them. Here’s why. Historians of universities typically see two medieval models, the University of Bologna and the University of Paris, based on which other European universities evolved. North of the Alps, the University of Paris proved most influential. By  France had about sixteen provincial universities, on the whole rather small, and one monstrous university in Paris with sixty-eight colleges. England and the Germanies pursued alternate ends of the Parisian-French model. By  England had only two uni-\n\n  \n\n\n\nversities, Oxford and Cambridge, which between them had about twentytwo colleges, neglecting the monastic ones. The German lands, however, had about seventeen universities (and many more than that by ), mostly small, and each with only one, two, or a few colleges.42 The English universities of Cambridge and Oxford became centered on colleges during the early modern era, while the German universities or, rather, the Protestant ones, became centered on faculties. The typical medieval and early modern faculties were only four: theology, jurisprudence or law, medicine, and, finally, arts and philosophy, which included essentially the sciences too. At German universities, the one or two colleges at each university became more or less identified with the arts and philosophy (or sciences) faculty. But the real power at German universities was vested in the faculties and their organs, such as the academic senate. The chief administrative organs at Oxbridge drew rather on the heads of houses, that is, the heads of the colleges. Oxbridge colleges were assemblies of master, doctors, and fellows. German faculties were assemblies of professors and lecturers. The Jesuit colleges and universities exhibited a rather strange mixture of the collegiate and professorial university, but on the whole actually most resembled Protestant Oxbridge. In other words, the Reformation had very diﬀerent academic impacts in England and the German lands, as the English system came to have most in common with a Catholic one. The modern research university grew from the faculties of German Protestant professors. The North American system, for example, had been based on the model of the Oxbridge colleges. It began grafting the German professorial university onto itself in the second half of the nineteenth century. At American universities, the undergraduate college remained essentially a descendant of the Oxbridge college, while the graduate schools emerged as a superstructure of German faculties or departments that were added on to the undergraduate college. After the s, the new graduate schools cultivated research, while the college had a traditional pedagogical mission. Confronted with the German research university, Oxbridge itself began to change then, too; and, in the s, so did the French. The German research university had achieved a canonical form by the s, first, in what would later become the Second Reich. From there, it had spread to other German-speaking lands. In the first half of the nineteenth century, the conquest had spread already to Northern, Eastern, and Southern parts of Europe—to Scandinavia, Russia and Greece. In the second half of the nineteenth century, as just noted, the German research uni-\n\n                  \n\n\n\nversity colonized academia in the United States, Britain and, by the end of the century, France.43 The nineteenth century witnessed as well the second phase of European colonialism. Parts of the globe that had remained largely immune from penetration and control—Africa and Asia—fell now to the new European science-based military, medical, and industrial technologies. The spread of European science to those continents had little thereafter to do with any philosophical or theological attraction of European science or culture. It had to do, rather, with the simple power of European science-based military and related technologies. The vehicle for spreading European science and academics globally became the German research university, the final and the most insidious phase of European colonialism.44 This book was written with that, among other things, in mind. THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK\n\nThe book falls into two unequal parts. The first traces essential processes and eﬀects of the rationalization of academic life and labor. The second part examines resistances and oddities. The first part focuses on the rise of the visible and legible in defining academic labor and charisma. In rudimentary statement, this consists in the triumph of the eye over the ear. Some agreement seems to obtain that this happened. Disagreement attends the question of when and to what extent. To avoid most of the polemics about the when, this study locates the triumph of the eye—the dominion of the visible and legible in academia— over a long period. The question concerning to what extent is addressed by part two of this book. The first part, however, examines the gradual process whereby the visible, especially forms of writing and recording, overcame and, to good extent, eclipsed the traditional oral culture of academia. The rationalization of German academia wrought by ministries and markets aimed to substitute writing in place of speaking and hearing. Academic charisma would be manufactured by publications and written expert or peer review, instead of by old-fashioned academic disputational oral-arts, unsubstantiated rumors, and provincial gossip. The first part comprises chapters  to . Chapters  and  continue in an introductory vein, while chapters  to  examine central aspects of the new academic regime definitive of the research university: graded written examinations for undergraduates, seminar papers for graduate or postgradu-\n\n  \n\n\n\nate students, doctoral dissertations as the rite of passage into professional academic life, “publish or perish” for a professorial appointment, and the constitution of the library catalogues recording and referencing such publications. Academic oral culture appears in most of those chapters, but usually as vestigial or incidental—a marginal step or stage leading to the cultivation and exhibition of modern charisma in paperwork. The second part of the book, comprising chapters  to , recurs to such vestiges of academic oral culture. These chapters consider, in part, whether orientation on the market facilitated the persistence of the ear and the tongue. A certain, odd sort of noise and voices did continue to haunt or inform academic charisma. The themes of narrative, reputation, and the voice, not neglected in part , receive more attention in part . Finally, the epilogue will recur to some of the motifs of this prologue. In a largely descriptive way, and based primarily on contemporary secondary sources, it will recount the consolidation of the German research university in the nineteenth century and its diﬀusion.\n\n2 The Lecture Catalogue A source of information and disinformation, of propaganda and publicity, the lecture catalogue is an epitome and emblem of the modern academic order. It is the single most condensed academic document, the royal road to the academic subconscious. But universities did not commonly publish lecture catalogues until the seventeenth century. And many did so with little consistency until the eighteenth century, or even later. Given the nature of teaching at Oxford and Cambridge, those universities and their colleges do not appear to have needed or wanted a university publication like the lecture catalogue until the modern era. Information about tutorials and other classes, in so far as it needed to be advertised, typically appeared on bulletin boards in college butteries and the like. The Cambridge University Calendar did not begin appearing until . And Oxford does not seem to have had a university publication until , when the Oxford University Gazette appeared for the first time. In the sixteenth century, Jesuit colleges and universities published a number of lecture catalogues, but then appear to have published such catalogues at best occasionally. The history of the published lecture catalogue seems to be largely a Continental Protestant one until the late eighteenth century.1 The catalogues considered below come from the German cultural space. The chapter has sections on parades, paperwork, and publicity. It aims to sketch the framework for the book more concretely than chapter  could, while also attending to this most condensed academic genre as an important bit of modern material culture. PA R A D E S\n\nThe niceties of parading epitomize traditional academic mentalities. Hierarchy and precedence were central to them. In this section, we’ll commence 33\n\n   \n\n\n\nby comparing and contrasting parading practices at the University of Cambridge and the University of Basel, as examples. This will swiftly bring us to the central place of the professorate in the German as opposed to the English academic system. The centrality of the professor in the German system will find itself reflected in the lecture catalogue. The latter will in turn help illuminate traditional professorial practices of musical chairs, pluralism, and nepotism. The relation of the professorate to the calendar and the curriculum may then be seen through the lecture catalogue, which will bring us, finally, to the ordinary or full professors and their chairs. Cambridge on Parade Behold the University of Cambridge on parade: figure . from David Loggan’s Cantabrigia illustrata of . Attention to real parading will be repaid with elucidation of parading in the lecture catalogue. The traditional lecture catalogue was at base the university on parade—how it formally presented itself as a collegial body. In figure . from Cantabrigia illustrata, students and academics stand in the order of inverted academic precedence from the top left down to the bottom middle. That is how they would probably march in a parade. Remember that, in many parades, the best come last, and the least first. Beginning at the left in the top row, the first figures embody the lowest sorts of students in ascending order. The middle figure is the bachelor of arts, followed by the bachelor of law and medicine, who have the same costume, followed by the three sorts of masters of arts. The first row ends with the figure whose clothing signifies the highest sort of a master of arts as well as a bachelor of theology, who also have the same costume. From this first row, we see some of the niceties of academic manners in the ivory tower. Students of arts (and philosophy and sciences) are the least. Students of theology are the best. And those of medicine and jurisprudence occupy the middle and face each other, locked in potential conflict. Should physicians or jurists march nearest the theologians? Early modern jurists spilt much ink to legitimate their proximity to the theologians, for the latter had the highest socioacademic status in traditional European society.2 Rows two to four mix a few nonacademics, perhaps playing servants ( famuli), crashing the parade. The third from the right in the second row gives us our first doctor, the anomalous doctor of music. Following figures trace out a spectrum of degrees and sorts of other doctors. These end in the third row, left to middle, with the highest sorts of doctors of law or medicine, embodied in the one costume for both, followed by the highest doctor of theology. Other than the doctor of music, no doctors of philosophy or lit-\n\n                 \n\n\n\n.. The order of academic precedence and costumes, University of Cambridge, from Cantabrigia illustrata, by David Loggan, Cambridge, .\n\nerature or arts or sciences existed at Cambridge or Oxford or most other universities at this time (an issue to which we’ll return in chapter ). In the third row, the last two figures embody, respectively, a noble and a university oﬃcer. The fourth and final row is reserved for the most important persona, the prochancellor of Cambridge. He stands alone in the middle, flanked to the left by an honor guard, and to the right by unnumbered but labeled servants.3 The parade exhibits a hierarchy of disciplines and of degrees. Theology claims pride of place as the loftiest discipline. Arts and philosophy (and sciences) remain the lowliest. And medicine and law occupy the middle. An order of degree-holders, complexly articulated, crosscuts this order of the disciplines. A master of arts (number ) stands superior to a bachelor of law or medicine (number ), but inferior to a bachelor of theology (number ). We see the hierarchy from the order of marching. Note, by the way, the absence altogether in this Cambridge parade of anyone called a professor. That will soon prove important for us.\n\n   \n\n\n\nFrom the parade we also see a hierarchy of clothing. Costumes become in general more elaborate and expensive from the top left down to the bottom middle. Thanks to the rather ascetic dress of Protestant theologians, however, this forms another complex system. Alas, we have no time at the moment for the philosophy of clothes. Dwelling on this Cambridge parade, however, intimates the importance of academic precedence.4 Early modern German academia had nothing to compare with this Cambridge fashion show, most charming and even homoerotic in its own way. But matters of academic precedence and hierarchy remained more than virulent in the Germanies. (Indeed, the Germans still call an academic and bureaucratic hierarchy “an order of clothing,” eine Kleiderordnung.) In traditional society, hierarchy rules and is embodied.5 The order in the parade and the charm of the clothing indicate the traditional authority and charismatic elements of an academic regime still medieval at base. Charisma vested itself not in the individual’s body, but rather in corporate and collegial bodies, such as faculties, as well as in the legal or juridical persona, such as given by academic degrees. To comprehend the nature of traditional charisma, one must not discount the clothes as a charm. Basel on Parade Behold now the University of Basel on parade—or some of it. Figures . and . show Basel lecture catalogues from / and /, respectively. At the time, the University of Basel, situated in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, was medium-sized and well known. In short, it oﬀers a good place to begin. These catalogues give us snapshots of the university, taken at about twenty years apart. Notice, first, that the catalogues are in Latin. Like its academic costume in figure ., this is how the medieval and early modern university presented itself. Traditional authority and academic charisma were as much vested in the charm of Latin as in elaborate costumes. Production of the catalogue came under the auspices of the rector or prorector, the head of a university in the German cultural space. The actual editing of the catalogue usually fell to the professor whose Latin skills were supposed to have been best. The best Latinist, theoretically, at a university would have been the professor of eloquence and poetry, or the professor of Latin. The former professorship, by the way, meant Latin eloquence and poetry, since the academic study of vernaculars emerged very slowly. The professor of eloquence and poetry usually served as os academicum, the academic mouth. This professor typically had to pen or at least edit documents\n\n                 \n\n\n\npublished in the name of the university, for example, encomia on the sovereign’s birthday and, later, the lecture catalogue.6 The next thing to notice is that the entire teaching staﬀ and all their classes fit on one page. Academia amounted only to a cottage industry until rather recently. It was a collegial and “moral” community, one where private and public life fused. Academic life resembled village life, a nearly communal life. These men all knew each other, for better or worse. We’ll notice that they are all indeed men simply in passing, and return to the issue of gender in a later chapter. At the moment, we shall examine, rather, the men’s academic status. The top line of figure . (neater than figure .) reads: Catalogue of Professors. Figure . from Cambridge showed us a parade of scholars, masters, and doctors. A lecture catalogue shows, rather, a parade of academic staﬀ, so students perforce fail in figures . and .. The early modern German academic staﬀ, moreover, no longer centered on masters and doctors and their order of costumes. It centered, rather, around professors and the order of faculties and chairs. In early modern German academia, charisma became professorial. Next we see, after a few lines in figure ., the most important academic persona by oﬃce: the rector, Emanuel Zaeslin. As the highest oﬃcer, his name appears in bold type, reflecting the great charisma of oﬃce in a traditional society. The two catalogues show diﬀerent rectors. Like the deanship in each faculty, the rectorship rotated. So in figure ., the rector, Lukas Burckhardt, is a professor in the faculty of jurisprudence. In figure ., the rector is a professor in the philosophy faculty. The rectorship typically rotated over the period of four years or semesters through all four faculties and, within each faculty, usually but not always through all full or ordinary professors. Most professors probably wanted to be rector at least once. But, as with many academic administrative oﬃces, the amount of labor and time demanded often exceeded the power and prestige acquired.7 Above or below the rector’s name, we see the length of time that the catalogue covers. At Basel from  to , the rectorial year extended from summer solstice to summer solstice, while the academic or teaching year began in the autumn. The catalogues here match not the academic year but rather the rectorial year. This ties these documents above all to the rectorship. Each of the catalogues covers a full year. The transition to an academic year of semesters took shape only slowly throughout the German cultural space and elsewhere. Some universities produced catalogues divided into semesters in the sixteenth century, while others first made such a division in the eighteenth century or later. Oxbridge developed a rather idiosyncratic system of trimesters very early on.8\n\n.. Catalogus Professorum, University of Basel, /.\n\n.. Catalogus Professorum, University of Basel, /.\n\n   \n\n\n\nThe professors appear in the main body of the catalogues. The order here inverts the order of the Cambridge parade. It is the normal or uninverted order of academic precedence, where the best come first. From the top left to the bottom right, the faculties have their traditional order of academic precedence in the German cultural space and elsewhere: first comes theology, second jurisprudence or law, third medicine, and last and least arts and philosophy (and sciences)—here called the philosophy faculty. The mere lecturers in music, French, and Italian fall to the end or run across the bottom of the page. This indicates that the few modern languages and other subjects taught had not been fully integrated into the curriculum or, rather, into the system of professorial chairs.9 The Order of Academic Precedence The order in the faculties was also important. A glance at the catalogues shows that within each faculty the names of professors structure the list, and the listing is not alphabetic. What then determines the order? In traditional academia at least four possible considerations or criteria might play a role in setting academic precedence. () In terms of the sorts of academic degrees, as in the Cambridge parade. () In terms of the dates of when academic degrees were received. Here precedence or seniority accrued in the order of the length of time a degree had been held. The longer one had been a doctor or master, the more seniority one had. The latter could be measured (a) absolutely: no matter where one had graduated, only the respective degree dates mattered. Or it could be measured (b) relatively: degree-holders from other universities had lower status relative to degree-holders teaching at their alma mater (Doctor sive Magister Noster). () In terms of the dates of when professorships were received. Here precedence or seniority accrued in order of the length of time a professorship had been held. The longer one had been a full or ordinary professor in the faculty and /or university, the more seniority one had. That latter could also be measured (a) absolutely: seniority carried over intermurally and /or between faculties. Or professorial seniority might be measured (b) relatively: seniority only accrued intramurally and/or within a faculty. () In terms of a complex calculus of () to ().\n\nWe shall return to matters of academic precedence many times in this book. A little reflection would show, for example, that the absolute versus relative methods of setting precedence bore directly on the mobility, or lack of it, of professors between universities, given how much precedence mattered in a traditional social group such as academia.\n\n                 \n\n\n\nThe conception of the modern professorate hinged on the transformation of diﬀerential status from seniority to salary: where one marched in the parade became less important than how much one was paid. And ad hominem salary oﬀers—a technique actually designed for the case of the extraordinary (that is, not a full) professor—one day became the means facilitating professorial mobility. But that would be the modern system. The early modern one, where hierarchy ruled, generally worked against academic mobility.10 Basel adhered on the whole to b above: precedence by length of time a professorship had been held in the faculty. The three “superior” faculties— theology, law, and medicine—each had here three ordinary or full professorships, that is, three chairs. In each faculty, the three chairs formed a hierarchy, also in part designated by diﬀerential salary. By standard early modern practices, professors tended to move up the faculty hierarchy upon the departure or death of a colleague. In universities where chairs in the superior faculties had ordinal names (primarius, secundus, tertius, etc.), the senior professor in each usually had the primarius professorship, the next senior the secundus, and so on. In figure ., the senior professor in each superior faculty has styled himself “Facult. Senior” or something similar.11 Professors in the superior faculties in the catalogues here thus appear in order of the length of time they had been a professor in the respective faculty. In eighteenth century catalogues, the same would be true in the philosophy faculty. However, the catalogue from / (figure .) shows a more articulated order of precedence in the philosophy faculty. Close scrutiny of biographies shows that the professors in the Basel philosophy faculty in / oddly replicated the overall order of academic precedence—theology, jurisprudence, medicine, arts and philosophy—within the faculty itself. That was possible since many of them had academic degrees in one of the superior faculties. We’ll return to that matter later. Early modern professors moved through and between faculties and chairs. In figure ., J. J. Battier is at the bottom of the philosophy faculty. Twenty years later in figure ., he has moved into the law faculty, where he is its junior member. The next from the bottom in figure ., Jakob Bernoulli, died in , so he is not in figure .. Third from the bottom in figure ., S. Werenfels, made it all the way to being the senior of the theology faculty in figure .. Fourth and fifth from the bottom in the first catalogue, J. J. Buxtorf and J. G. Mangold, died in  and , respectively, thus are not in the second catalogue here. In figure ., fifth from the top in the philosophy faculty, T. Zwinger, survived the latter two colleagues and was the sen-\n\n   \n\n\n\nior professor in the medical faculty in figure .. Fourth from the top in the first catalogue, J. Wettstein, remained in the philosophy faculty in the second catalogue and was now its senior, as he styled himself. In  he became a professor in the law faculty. Third from the top in figure ., B. Faesch, was the second professor in the law faculty in figure .. Second in figure ., S. Burckhardt, died in , so was not in figure .. Finally, the philosophy faculty senior in figure ., J. J. Hoﬀmann, died in , so was absent from figure .. So much for the philosophy faculty in figure .. What do we see from this? Of the ten individuals in figure . from / , five did not move up to one of the three superior faculties, while the other five did. We shall soon discuss why, but you can take this as a fact: many or even most early modern academics had their eyes on a chair in one of the superior faculties. That explains why so many professors in the philosophy faculty had doctorates in theology, law, or medicine. By the way, three of the five, who did not change faculties above, died between the time of our two catalogues, so we cannot be sure about their aims. But one of them at least, Mangold, had already obtained a doctorate in medicine, which of course would have allowed him to move into that faculty. This brings us to the subject of academic musical chairs. It is a modern, bureaucratic notion that salary might increase over time by seniority or merit to someone remaining in the same position. In the early modern era, advancement came by way of changing positions in a sort of musical chairs—opting up—or by academic pluralism, a hallowed ecclesiastical practice. Indeed, the practice of musical chairs itself stems from canonical practices. Opting up in the canonical hierarchy was called jus optandi in canon law. In the German academic system, opting up or musical chairs was called Aufrücken. Alongside pluralism, it formed an essential part of traditional practices of advancement. Early modern Protestant professors much resembled canons at cathedrals, because a professorial chair much resembled a canonry; indeed, the former originated in the latter during the High Middle Ages. Like medieval canons, professors usually began at the bottom of the hierarchy— here in the arts and philosophy (and sciences) faculty—and tried to move up. The subjects of the chairs had not much importance. The powers and privileges and monies tied to the respective chairs (or canonries) gave, rather, the essence of the matter. What counted was a place in the hierarchy and ways to enhance it. The charisma of oﬃce came, as it did at the cathedrals, from the place of one’s chair in the canonical hierarchy.12 Professors in the arts and philosophy faculty not only tried to move into\n\n                 \n\n\n\na superior faculty and, then, to move up. They also tried to move between chairs in the arts and philosophy faculty. Some chairs in the faculty paid more and/or had more prestige than others. In Basel, for example, the nine chairs in the philosophy faculty were de facto divided into two classes, higher and lower, between which professors often tried to move. One opted up from the lower to the higher class of chairs for more money and prestige.13 List  in appendix  will make such practices clearer (lists and tables are in appendices at the rear of the book.) List  shows that in  the three least well-paid arts and philosophy professors at Leipzig—those of dialectics, grammar, and elementary mathematics—could make  to  percent more by opting up to the chair of rhetoric, or poetics, or physics, if one of them became vacant. The top chair—for Greek, Latin, ethics, and politics—looks like an ad hominem joint chair of Greek-Latin and ethicspolitics. The  florin salary might not have survived the demise of its pluralistic holder. Nepotism and the Professorate The diﬀerence between medieval canons and early modern Protestant professors lay in the more thoroughgoing professorial practice of the third thing they had in common besides opting up and pluralism: nepotism. Note the most salient information from our two Basel catalogues. Of the Bernoullis, Buxtorfs, Faesches, Werenfels, and Wettsteins, we find two each, as well as three Battiers and three Zwingers. The clear winners are the Burckhardt family with four faculty members. These men stood in relations of grandfather, father, son, grandson, uncle, nephew, great-uncle, and so on. For lack of space and time, we cannot pursue a social history of these men. But bear in mind that the little list of common surnames above does not consider sons-in-law who became faculty members. Study of the professor’s daughter has been much hampered by a failure of biographical and prosopographical sources on academics to record maiden names of professors’ wives, if they record wives’ names at all. Failing such information, it is hard to tell which professors at Basel were maternal nephews and / or sonsin-law of someone in the faculty. What we see from common surnames in catalogues is only the tip of an iceberg. Basel was known for nepotism. In fairness one should say that Basel probably proved but the best known, if not most notorious case, of standard academic practice. In seventeenth-century Basel, there were altogether about eighty professors, of whom  percent came from just fifteen families. The winners then were the Burckhardts, who had eight professors, followed by the Faesch family with six. The eighteenth century saw other and\n\n   \n\n\n\nmore families—such as the Bernoullis—enter the lists, as the university and town took measures to make appointment less nepotistic. Still, in the end, town and gown formed a more or less coherent endogamous group or incestuous kindred of academics and aldermen.14 We have been considering the Germanic parade of professors for the last few pages. The persona and title of “professor” had emerged in the Middle Ages, and first had come into popularity in the early Renaissance. But its diﬀusion as an academic system came by way of the Continental Protestant Reformation. Furthermore, the diﬀusion of the professorate as a system— in place of medieval masters and fellows as at Oxbridge—seems to have induced the emergence of the lecture catalogue as a regular publication, albeit slowly and fitfully.15 The Calendar, the Curriculum, and the Professorate The medieval university had neither a professorate nor a calendar in the early modern and modern sense. An oﬃcial opening date of the academic year did swiftly emerge. And winter and summer vacations existed. But the three term academic year, which Oxford and Cambridge adopted, should tell us that the semester, as a unit of academic labor and time, was not part of the academic state of nature.16 Inspection of lists  and  in appendix  may be illuminating. List  shows the lectures for the master’s degree in arts and philosophy at the University of Leipzig in . A lecture on Aristotle’s Ethics cost six groschen and would last from six to nine months. The same time-fee equations held for Aristotle’s Metaphysics and for Euclid’s Elements. In the middle of the list, a lecture on De caelo lasted three to four months and cost four groschen. At the end of the list, a lecture on Oeconomica could only last three weeks and only cost one groschen. We see that each lecture had its own calendar and an appropriate set fee. Ordinary lectures, such as these, could be or should have been taught only during the ordinary days of the academic year, that is, not on holidays, during vacation, or on days reserved for special business or events, such as exams. This fee and time schedule gives us the academic regime before the professorate emerged as the academic system in the Germanies and elsewhere. The lectures for the M.A. in list  were given by masters and doctors, who would each collect the fee from each student for each lecture course. Some endowed or salaried positions did exist. Thus there were what would come to be called “professors.” But the medieval (and Oxbridge) academic system did not center on them. Medieval academics typically made their living by collecting fees from lectures and examinations, and from any\n\n                 \n\n\n\nother duties and privileges to which their degrees bound or entitled them. Many also filled other oﬃces for more money. This medieval regime of masters and doctors displays itself in figure ., although by that time Oxbridge masters and doctors would have been mostly college fellows who obtained an income as a sinecure. To be a medieval master of arts originally meant to be able to lecture on all of the books taught for degrees. One was master of the Seven Liberal Arts, and eventually of all philosophy, too. The M.A. (and M.Phil. in some places) meant that. During the Middle Ages, arts and philosophy faculties instituted ever more hoops for the mastership. It took longer and longer to be a qualified or “incepted” master. But once one was, one could lecture during ordinary term time on whatever books one wanted—with the obvious bad results. In  at the University of Prague, a mere twenty years after its foundation, the arts and philosophy faculty faced the “rancor and envy among the Masters, as one competes with the other in lecturing on the same book.” Masters battled over enrollments for some books—probably those with the highest fees or best time-fee equatio"
