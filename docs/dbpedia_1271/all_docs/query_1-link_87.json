        "text": "The technical performance section of this year’s AI Index offers a comprehensive overview of AI advancements in 2023. It starts with a high-level overview of AI technical performance, tracing its broad evolution over time. The chapter then examines the current state of a wide range of AI capabilities, including language processing, coding, computer vision (image and video analysis), reasoning, audio processing, autonomous agents, robotics, and reinforcement learning. It also shines a spotlight on notable AI research breakthroughs from the past year, exploring methods for improving LLMs through prompting, optimization, and fine-tuning, and wraps up with an exploration of AI systems’ environmental footprint.\n\nAI is increasingly woven into nearly every facet of our lives. This integration is occurring in sectors such as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based on algorithmic insights. This trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also introduces potential risks. Consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus on the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The AI community has also become more concerned with assessing the impact of AI systems and mitigating risks for those affected.\n\nThis chapter explores key trends in responsible AI by examining metrics, research, and benchmarks in four key responsible AI areas: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Given that 4 billion people are expected to vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on AI and elections and more broadly explores the potential impact of AI on political processes.\n\nThe integration of AI into the economy raises many compelling questions. Some predict that AI will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain. A major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs be automated versus augmented by AI? Companies are already utilizing AI in various ways across industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows into this transformative technology. Moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating toward specific AI subfields like natural language processing and data management.\n\nThis chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn, Quid, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). It begins by analyzing AI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill penetration, and talent availability. The chapter then explores corporate investment in AI, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative AI. It further examines corporate adoption of AI, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these technologies. Finally, it assesses AI’s current and projected economic impact and robot installations across various sectors.\n\nThis year’s AI Index introduces a new chapter on AI in science and medicine in recognition of AI’s growing role in scientific and medical discovery. It explores 2023’s standout AI-facilitated scientific achievements, including advanced weather forecasting systems like GraphCast and improved material discovery algorithms like GNoME. The chapter also examines medical AI system performance, important 2023 AI-driven medical innovations like SynthSR and ImmunoSEIRA, and trends in the approval of FDA AI-related medical devices.\n\nThis chapter examines trends in AI and computer science (CS) education, focusing on who is learning, where they are learning, and how these trends have evolved over time. Amid growing concerns about AI’s impact on education, it also investigates the use of new AI tools like ChatGPT by teachers and students.\n\nThe analysis begins with an overview of the state of postsecondary CS and AI education in the United States and Canada, based on the Computing Research Association’s annual Taulbee Survey. It then reviews data from Informatics Europe regarding CS education in Europe. This year introduces a new section with data from Studyportals on the global count of AI-related English-language study programs.\n\nThe chapter wraps up with insights into K–12 CS education in the United States from Code.org and findings from the Walton Foundation survey on ChatGPT’s use in schools.\n\nAI’s increasing capabilities have captured policymakers’ attention. Over the past year, several nations and political bodies, such as the United States and the European Union, have enacted significant AI-related policies. The proliferation of these policies reflect policymakers’ growing awareness of the need to regulate AI and improve their respective countries’ ability to capitalize on its transformative potential.\n\nThis chapter begins examining global AI governance starting with a timeline of significant AI policymaking events in 2023. It then analyzes global and U.S. AI legislative efforts, studies AI legislative mentions, and explores how lawmakers across the globe perceive and discuss AI. Next, the chapter profiles national AI strategies and regulatory efforts in the United States and the European Union. Finally, it concludes with a study of public investment in AI within the United States.\n\nThe demographics of AI developers often differ from those of users. For instance, a considerable number of prominent AI companies and the datasets utilized for model training originate from Western nations, thereby reflecting Western perspectives. The lack of diversity can perpetuate or even exacerbate societal inequalities and biases.\n\nThis chapter delves into diversity trends in AI. The chapter begins by drawing on data from the Computing Research Association (CRA) to provide insights into the state of diversity in American and Canadian computer science (CS) departments. A notable addition to this year’s analysis is data sourced from Informatics Europe, which sheds light on diversity trends within European CS education. Next, the chapter examines participation rates at the Women in Machine Learning (WiML) workshop held annually at NeurIPS. Finally, the chapter analyzes data from Code.org, offering insights into the current state of diversity in secondary CS education across the United States.\n\nThe AI Index is dedicated to enhancing the coverage of data shared in this chapter. Demographic data regarding AI trends, particularly in areas such as sexual orientation, remains scarce. The AI Index urges other stakeholders in the AI domain to intensify their endeavors to track diversity trends associated with AI and hopes to comprehensively cover such trends in future reports.\n\nAs AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it is important to understand how public perceptions regarding the technology evolve. Understanding this public opinion is vital in better anticipating AI’s societal impacts and how the integration of the technology may differ across countries and demographic groups.\n\nThis chapter examines public opinion on AI through global, national, demographic, and ethnic perspectives. It draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from Ipsos profiling global AI attitudes over time, survey data from the University of Toronto exploring public perception of ChatGPT, and data from Pew examining American attitudes regarding AI. The chapter concludes by analyzing mentions of significant AI models on Twitter, using data from Quid."
