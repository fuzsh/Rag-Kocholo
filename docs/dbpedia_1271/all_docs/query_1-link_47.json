Medium-sized universities with a strong focus on research and smaller institution with an outstanding reputation form the nucleus of the academic world. Many German universities feature in international rankings, with 9 German universities in the top 200 in the Shanghai Rankings, 11 in the QS World University Rankings and 22 in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. The universities of Munich and Heidelberg perform particularly well.\n\nAccording to data from the German Rectors’ Conference (HRK) in 2021 students in Germany could choose from 420 higher education institutions (120 uni­versities, 243 universities of applied sciences, and 57 academies of music and art). These institutions offer a total of 20,593 degree courses. Funding for 272 higher education institutions is provided by the state, 38 by the church and 110 are funded privately.\n\nIn Germany there are essentially three types of higher education institution: universities, universities of applied sciences, and academies of art, film and music. They differ in terms of their structure and purpose.\n\nWhile traditional universities offer a broad range of subjects, technical universities Technical universities Universities with an especially strong technical focus operate as Technical Universities (TU) or Technical Colleges (TH).

In 2006 the nine leading technical universities formed the TU9 Initiative.\n\nThe universities regard themselves not only as teaching institutes but as research centres too, and as such still embody Wilhelm von Humboldt’s educational\n\nideal of the unity of research and teaching. The universities’ primary objective is to nurture the next generation of academics and researchers, to teach academically robust specialist knowledge, and to train academics to work and research independently.\n\nThe 243 universities of applied science are a unique feature of the German higher education system through their strong focus on practical applications.

The Initiative funds Clusters of Excellence in specific fields of research as well as so-called Universities of Excellence. It follows on from the previous Excellence Initiative of 2005 to 2017, when the Federal Government and the states provided particularly outstanding research projects and facilities with funding worth a total of 4.6 billion euros. The Excellence Initiative consists of two parts. Through the Clusters of Excellence, internationally competitive fields of research at uni­versities are funded on a project-by-project basis. These clusters facilitate\n\ninterdisciplinary collaboration among academics working on a specific research objective. A total of 57 Clusters of Excellence were selected for the first round of funding, which lasts for seven years and commenced in 2019. Total funding for all Clusters of Excellence each year is worth 385 million euros.\n\nUniversities involved in at least two Clusters of Excellence can use the title “University of Excellence”.
