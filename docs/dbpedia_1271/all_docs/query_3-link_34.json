I build mathematical models of coupled ecological, land-use, and economic systems to understand the mechanisms driving success, failure, and efficiency of management actions. My aim is to understand the mechanisms driving our pressures on the environment, and use that knowledge to help guide better decisions to reduce the negative effects on biodiversity.\n\nWe can achieve better outcomes for the environment and society when we plan better management and policy using mathematics. We can be careful, transparent, and defensible in our biodiversity conservation while acknowledging deep complexities and risks."
