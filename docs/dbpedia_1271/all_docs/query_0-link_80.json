        "text": "Some time early in 1949, I read an article in an educational magazine about the Army Dependent Schools in Germany. The article announced the teacher recruitment schedule for persons wishing to teach in Germany. I showed the article to Hetty and said this could be our last opportunity to see Germany. I was afraid she wouldn’t like to go so far from home, but, instead, she said it wouldn’t hurt to send in an application form.\n\nBy the time I had filled out the forms and returned them, I knew I wanted very much to have a teaching assignment in Germany. While I waited for an invitation for an interview, I got out my German books to brush up on my reading and speaking ability. On the application form I included the names of five references who knew of my German background. I wrote each of them a letter asking permission to give their names as references.\n\nIn a short time I had a letter from Washington, saying my application for a teaching position in the American Army Dependent Schools had been received. The nearest recruiting center to my home was at the Emporia State Teachers’ College. The letter included the names of two recruiters; (I remember only Richard Meyering) and also the location, date and approximate time I should appear for an interview.\n\nWhile waiting for the interview date, the school board offered me a contract for the following year with a raise from $4,200 to $4,500. I told the board then of my application for a position in Germany. My chances of getting the position were not good because teachers were being recruited from all over the U.S. As far as I knew I would be notified in June if I was selected. If nothing came if it, I would definitely want to return to Little River. The Board agreed to wait, if I would find a replacement for myself, if necessary.\n\nThe interview was neither encouraging nor discouraging. Mr. Meyering told me German nationals were teaching the German classes, and there was no plan to replace them. I had applied for a teaching position in order to have more free time than I would in a principalship. Mr. Meyering was mildly interested in my small school administrative experience. I recall telling Hetty when I got home that we probably wouldn’t hear any more about that!\n\nMy hopes rose two weeks later when there was a letter from Washington in the mailbox. It contained three short typed sentences, approximately as follows – Your credentials have been forwarded to Dependent Schools Headquarters in Karlsruhe, Germany. There may be an opening for a supervisor of German personnel. You will be notified in about two weeks.\n\nI cannot recall the details of the next three weeks but when they were over, I had received two pieces of news, any one of which would have changed the course of my life, I’m sure. I believe the first one came from Hetty, although I am not sure. She told me one morning, “I think I am pregnant.”\n\nThe second piece of news was, of course, the anticipated letter from Washington D.C. This one had four sentences, I believe. I remember only the first sentence, “You have been selected.” My title would be Supervisor of German Personnel. I don’t remember the Civil Service rating but the salary was $4,500, plus 25% bonus for a hardship assignment, plus furnished living quarters and health care for myself and family. I was told to report to Fort Riley, Kansas, for physical and processing for overseas travel about August 1, 1949.\n\nHetty and I had immediate conferences in regard to both pieces of news. Of her pregnancy my first reaction was, “Are you sure?” She was 40 and would be 41 in July and this would be her first pregnancy. We decided to wait a month before telling anyone outside the immediate family. The doctor confirmed Hetty’s interpretation and also set our mind at ease about accepting the overseas assignment. I suggested perhaps we should give up going to Germany, but Hetty knew how badly I wanted to go, so when my selection was confirmed and I accepted, we knew we wanted both a child and the assignment.\n\nThe day the letter from Washington D.C. came, I drove to the country to see Paul Perry, Board Chairman, who was plowing. When he saw me walking across the plowed ground, he stopped the tractor and greeted me with, “So you are leaving us?” I nodded and said, “First of August.” “Just enough time for you to help us find a replacement for yourself.” Paul assured me the Board had been pleased with my work as Superintendent and that they all wished me well in my new endeavors in Germany.\n\nI announced the vacancy to the College and University Placement Offices in Kansas and had quite a number of applications in a short time. I read the credentials provided for each applicant and eliminated all but three or four and asked these to come to Little River for interviews. The Board hired 52-year old R.C. Porter, who stayed in Little River as Superintendent for five years.\n\nHetty and I were busy persons for six weeks before our sailing date on August 8th. We were limited in what we could take along to Germany. I believe we finally took two footlockers and a large suitcase each to be checked through from New York City to Karlsruhe. In addition we could carry with us all we needed on the way. It was no small task to decide what to take and what to leave at Mabel’s, at my folks, at Dorothy’s and at Ruth’s. We didn’t want to sell our furniture for we expected to be in Germany one year, or, at the most, two years, before returning to the States.\n\nAt my office in Little River, I tried to leave everything in order so the new Superintendent would have no problem taking over the responsibilities. Mr. Porter spent two days with me at the school during which time I showed him the school records and walked through every room in the building, including the basement. I had prepared written memos about special subjects. One of these was the Dean Jones episode about the sawed-off locker padlock. I made a point of having all returning teachers meet Mr. Porter. We drove to Lyons where he met the County Superintendent and the officials in charge of surplus commodities used in the school hot lunch program.\n\nHetty and I finally took our leave from Little River to spend the few days left with family in Harper County, and in Hutchinson where we established our stateside address at 115 East 10th. There were last minute problems with official orders authorizing travel for both of us by car from Hutchinson to New York City. When these were resolved, we checked our hold baggage by train and ship directly to Karlsruhe, said our final good-byes and headed for New York City in our 1947 Dodge Coronet on August 1, 1949. What a relief it was to be finally on our way to Karlsruhe!\n\nKARLSRUHE – 1949 – 1951\n\nThe drive from Hutchinson to New York City, beginning on August 1st and ending August 4th, 1949, left no details in my recollections, but I’m sure our thoughts and conversations included a number of subjects. From the first, I was enthusiastic about going to Germany. I wasn’t sure Hetty would share my feeling, but as the time of our departure neared, she seemed as excited as I. I guess our biggest concern was for the baby that was due to arrive around Christmas time. We had consulted doctors in Little River, Hutchinson and Anthony. They all assured us there was nothing to worry about.\n\nHetty was afraid she might get seasick as she had never been on a large body of water in an ocean liner. We both wondered if we had packed the right things to take along. Hetty spoke only English but hoped she could learn enough German to be comfortable among the German people we would meet. With my German language and Army background, I was looking forward to working with U.S. Army personnel and perhaps living in a German community. Neither Hetty nor I knew anyone in Europe although I had in years past corresponded with two or three German pen-pals. I did wonder if I would be able to locate Bruno Radtke, the visiting German Professor I had known at Kansas University (K.U.). I wondered what part, if any, he had played in WWII.\n\nAs we neared New York City, our immediate concern was to find the pier in New York where we were to leave our car to be shipped to Bremen, Germany. Following the instructions we had gotten, we had no difficulty in finding the pier and taking care of the paper work required. A military vehicle took us and our hand baggage to Fort Hamilton where we were assigned to quarters to occupy until we boarded the Holbrook, a troop ship, that would take us to Bremerhaven, Germany. The Holbrook was scheduled to sail on August 8th so we had a bit of time to spend as we wished. We had, of course, to report Hetty’s pregnancy and had an appointment with the ship’s doctor, who gave us appropriate instructions, and seasickness pills for Hetty to take.\n\nWe soon met other civilians who, like me, would be employed with the U.S. Army Dependent Schools. Several of these were from Hutchinson with names familiar to Hetty. However, we also met two couples who became long time friends – the Everett Ruby’s and the Walter Ingram’s. Most of those we met would be going to Germany for the first time. Everett Ruby was an exception to this. He had been employed by DSD (Dependent School Detachment) in 1947 and he and his wife were now returning to Germany after taking summer leave in the States. His position was that of Regional Superintendent in the Munich area.\n\nEverett asked what position I would be filling and was surprised when I said “German Supervisor” in Karlsruhe. He said that couldn’t be because Al Beerbaum had that position. I showed him my orders and he had to admit I was right. I got the impression that Everett regarded Al Beerbaum so good in his position that it would be hard for anyone else to take his place. In the time we were together at Fort Hamilton and on the Holbrook, Everett learned enough about my German background to admit I was one of only a few who would be qualified to take Al Beerbaum’s place. Later I found Everett’s assessment of Al Beerbaum to be quite true and so I would have to do no less than my best in the position I had accepted.\n\nWhile still at Fort Hamilton, Everett, Walter and several of us fellows were sent by our wives to Yankee Stadium to see the Yankees play a double-header. On the way to the stadium we passed a pool hall that had a television in the window. That was the first TV program I had ever seen. At the stadium I don’t recall who won the games, but I do remember seeing Phil Rizzuto, my favorite short stop, hit a homerun, and Joe Dimaggio hit a ground ball so hard that it was in the outfield before the in-fielders could move.\n\nWhen Hetty and I boarded the Holbrook on the morning of Aug. 8, I was a bit surprised to find it was, indeed, a ‘troop ship’. There were compartments with double deck bunks, but no cabins for couples, even when one of us was pregnant. I found myself in a compartment with about 25 other men. That wasn’t too bad for me as it was still better than either of the two troop ships I’d been on before, but I did complain when I found they had put Hetty in a compartment with 46 women. I found the ship had nothing better to offer. Hetty was a good sport and said the other women were very considerate and helpful.\n\nI don’t recall what the arrangements were for eating on the Holbrook, but couples did eat together. There were no storms on the 8-day voyage to Bremerhaven, Germany, so Hetty and I spent the days on deck, playing bridge, or socializing in other ways with our new friends. Some of the passengers wanted to learn German so I had a class once each day. Someone suggested a quartet to provide music at the Protestant services on Sunday morning. Everett and I ended up being half of a mixed quartet – he provided a strong tenor part while mine was a so-so bass.\n\nWe saw a few other ships on the way and I recall the “White Cliffs of Dover” as we sailed through the English Channel before docking at Bremerhaven, where representatives of DSD gave us a warm welcome and documents to authorize travel to our final destinations. I remember Hetty and I had to change trains at Frankfurt.\n\nI remember it was dark when we arrived at the “Bahnhof” in Karlsruhe but we were immediately identified and transported to the Lutz Hotel on Krieg Strasse which was our home for a month or so. It was not a fancy hotel, but under the Occupation Agreement it had been turned over to the U.S. Army to provide temporary quarters for personnel until permanent quarters could be arranged\n\nFortunately, we arrived in Karlsruhe on a weekend and so were able to orient ourselves to our surroundings before I reported for duty at the Fiat Building on Monday morning. Across the street from our hotel was the Farmer’s Market, a large pavilion-type structure covering a city block. Although the streets had been cleared of rubble, there was ample evidence of bomb damage during the war which had ended a bit more than four years earlier. No reconstruction had been done and most business was done under temporary shelters in front of damaged buildings.\n\nBeginning at Bremerhaven we had seen similar evidence of war damage all the way to Karlsruhe. At places it was much worse than at others. Kassel and Frankfurt were probably the worst after leaving the north coast. Heidelberg, by contrast, hadn’t been bombed at all. Karlsruhe was badly damaged, especially the Castle area which was occupied by a unit of German SS troops.\n\nAt Karlsruhe we were immediately among friends. At first there were the civilians and military personnel in the headquarters staff of Dependent School Detachment. This staff was responsible for the conduct and supervision of the U.S. Army Dependent Schools operating in the American Zone of Occupied Germany.\n\nBefore proceeding with my own involvement with the U.S. Army Dependent Schools, I will digress briefly to explain why, and how, these schools came into existence in the first place, and to observe their growth since their beginning in 1946.\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in 1945, Hitler’s Germany was in a state of total collapse. As a result of this, the armies of the three major Allied Powers overran the country, and then divided Germany into four zones, which were occupied and administered as follows: Russia in the east, Britain in the north, U.S. in the south-central, and France in the west. Berlin, the former German capital, now located in the Russian Zone, was similarly divided with each of the four countries occupying and administering a sector of the city. In the absence of the civil government, each occupying power imposed military government in its zone. Bonn became the new capital of West Germany.\n\nBy 1946, families of U.S. personnel involved with military government were joining their husbands in Germany and living in confiscated housing. The presence of American school age children made necessary the creation of the Dependent Schools Detachment which was staffed with civilian educators recruited from the States. With the U.S. Army providing the logistical support needed, the DSD staff opened the doors of 38 elementary and five high schools in the fall of 1946. By the end of the school year, the total enrollment in these schools was over 3,000. The North Central Association had accredited the high schools at Berlin, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Munich, and Nürnberg.\n\nThe stated purpose of the DSD staff was (1) to organize and maintain schools on both the elementary and secondary levels in U.S. military communities in Germany, and (2) to supply German educators with a model American school system in action, from which to draw inspiration for the reorganization and democratization of the German educational program. The schools were as American as could be, except the locale was that of a German community, some of the teaching staff were German nationals, and most of the children elected to learn to speak German.\n\nThe 1947/48 school year showed many changes. The physical appearance of school plants was greatly improved. Newly adopted textbooks and workbooks had arrived from the States in large quantities. Peak enrollment this year reached 4,200. The DSD program was now financed for the most part with funds appropriated by Congress, and the teachers were given Civil Service contracts for the first time.\n\nDuring the third year, 1948/49, DSD continued to improve and grow. Peak total enrollment reached 5,146. There was difficulty in getting enough teachers from the States to take care of the increasing enrollment. Nearly half of the total enrollment was concentrated in kindergarten and the first two grades. In July 1948 the DSD Headquarters was moved from Frankfurt to Karlsruhe.\n\nI may as well add here the statistics pertaining to the 1949/50 school year, my first with the Dependent School Detachment Headquarters Staff. There were now 36 kindergartens, 58 elementary schools, and seven high schools, with a total enrollment of 8,200. Teaching in these schools were some 325 American teachers, and more than 200 German assistants. The course of study used in both the elementary and high schools compared favorably with the best offered in the States.\n\nIn charge of the Headquarters Staff were Colonel Albert, Chief, DSD, and Virgil Walker, Chief, Education Branch. Other personnel included Richard Meyering, Chief, Secondary Education Branch; Fred Miller, Chief, Elementary Education Branch; Lauren Buel, Chief, Personnel Administration; Sarita Davis, Chief, Library Section; Ralph Stutzman, Chief, German Language Section; George Fuhrman, Chief, Fiscal Section, and Captain Tragle, Chief, Supply Branch.\n\nOf course, there were assistants and secretaries to the above. In addition, there were five Regional Superintendents with offices in Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Karlsruhe, Munich, and Nürnberg, also regarded as part of the headquarters staff. The Superintendents served as the first line of communication between the school principals and the Headquarters Staff, located in the Fiat Building in Karlsruhe, about half a mile from the Lutz Hotel.\n\nAt the Lutz, Hetty and I had one room with minimum furnishings to call our own. It was at the back of the hotel on an upper floor. There was one window which gave a limited view of discolored roofs and very little blue sky. Of course, we could go down stairs and share the lounge with the other hotel guests, but Hetty was beginning to show her pregnancy, and would have preferred a more private place for her daytime rest, which the doctor insisted she take. We were told we would soon be moving into a German apartment where she wound be more conformable.\n\nFortunately, our new acquaintances included two couples who insisted on including us in their social life and shared their homes for many pleasant evenings and weekends together. They were Virgil and Bonnie Walker, and Fred and Ina Miller. Both of them lived in German houses and had German maids to do most of their housework. The Walkers were about our age and loved to play bridge. Virgil had been a Lt. Col. in the Army at the end of the war when he took his discharge, and was appointed as Civilian Director to organize the professional staff of DSD in 1946. Fred and Ina Miller were older than we and were also from Kansas where Fred had been in schoolwork in the Salina-Topeka area. In recent years he had served in the State Superintendent of School’s office in Topeka as Elementary School Specialist until he was recruited by DSD in 1947. Ina practically adopted Hetty and they became close friends. Hetty needed a close friend like Ina, especially for the next five months.\n\nI was pleased to find, when I reported for duty at the Fiat Building that Al Beerbaum, whose position I was taking, was remaining for three weeks to be my guide and orient me to the responsibilities of my position. He had been with DSD from the beginning and had developed the German language program used in all grades. As I had been told when I was interviewed at Emporia, all German teaching was done by native Germans, who also performed other duties to assist the American teachers and administrators. As stated before, there were some 200 German personnel thus employed. I was to be in charge of the German language program, and to act as advisor to schools principals and superintendents in all matters pertaining to German personnel.\n\nAl Beerbaum had the work of the German Language Section so well organized, and the lines of communication with German personnel and school principals so well established, that I needed but to follow the guidelines that existed, for the time being. The first week Al and I spent the time talking with all personnel in Headquarters, German and American. Al was very thorough and well liked by everyone. He had been born in Germany and had his early schooling there although his degrees were all from American universities and he had served in the American Army during the war.\n\nIn anticipation of the war reparations that Germany would eventually have to pay, the German personnel employed by the Americans were paid by the German economy. This included also the German women who worked as maids for Americans. Naturally my work required that I be familiar with both American and German personnel procedure.\n\nThe Army Hospital was located in Heidelberg about 35 miles from Karlsruhe. Hetty and I had an appointment with a doctor there a few days after arriving. The doctor, an Army captain, had received Hetty’s medical records from Fort Hamilton. During our conference the doctor suggested that we might want to consider a Cesarean operation since she was 41 and this would be her first baby. He explained what the operation involved and told us to think about it. This was eventually the method of delivery used.\n\nAl Beerbaum and I spent two weeks traveling to schools and meeting as many principals and German personnel as possible. At the end of that time Al said that I would do well. My facility with German language had improved rapidly so that Germans I met were sure I had been born in Germany. When I told them this was my first time in Germany and that my German-speaking ancestors had landed in Philadelphia in 1727, they could hardly believe it. I appreciated especially having spent these two weeks with Al for it answered most of the questions I could have asked.\n\nAt each military installation we visited, we stopped first at the office of the Post Commander to report that we were making a visit at the school. If the military School Officer was available, I was introduced to him and he might accompany us to the school. His function was to perform the non-academic services needed which included the maintenance and furnishing of the building selected for the school, providing transportation of pupils, plus other duties assigned by the Post Commander. Al pointed out it was most important to report my presence to the Commanding Officer (CO) before going to the school when making a visit. At some posts the CO also requested an exit report. I soon found it made for better relations to make the exit report at all posts.\n\nAfter Al Beerbaum left DSD to complete his doctorate at the University of Michigan, I was on my own with an assignment for which I was well qualified by background and training. Although I had been disappointed to be sent to the China-Burma-India theater (CBI) instead of Europe during the war, I found this may have been a blessing in disguise, for I now felt no resentment against the German people. The U.S. Military Government was in the process of launching exchange programs in the three German States in the American Zone – Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, and Hesse – to supplement the Marshall plan, already being implemented to help war-damaged countries rebuild. These programs not only brought a return to productive living, but they also helped change the attitudes of people. The official attitude towards Germans was now to be one of friendliness, rather than as a conquered nation.\n\nDuring the fall months of 1949 I spent about half of my time traveling to the American schools, getting acquainted with post commanders, school officers, principals and German personnel. When possible, group meetings were held where I had the opportunity to express my enthusiasm for joint programs with German schools in the community for the purpose of developing good relations between Germans and Americans. I encouraged principals to get acquainted with their counterparts in German schools, where this had not already been done, and get as much faculty involvement as possible. In a few cases I accompanied the principals in their first visits to the ‘Schuldirecktor’ of a nearby German ‘ Volkschule’ or ‘Gymnasium’! It was in these situations that my knowledge of German language, history and literature, was helpful.\n\nIn a short time I was quite in love with my work and the German countryside, where the war had not left its scars. I had heard of the ‘autobahns’ before. Unfortunately, all the bridges on the autobahns had been destroyed by American and British bombs and were not yet rebuilt. Between military installations my travel was mostly by train, and free, because I was a part of the occupation forces. On the military installations, I was provided with a military vehicle and German driver. The vehicles were usually German Opels or Taunus. The commuter trains stopped in every village and they were always on time. Although I was authorized to travel first class, I preferred second class because I could often strike up a conversation with a German person.\n\nAt the office in Karlsruhe I was soon given additional duties to add to the list on my original job description. I was put in charge of news items regarding the dependent schools to be released for publication in Stars and Stripes. I prepared statistical data regarding the schools for the U.S. Army in Europe Historical Division (USAREUR HQ was located in Heidelberg). Whenever an Army, Navy or Air Force General was invited to speak at DSD teachers’ or administrators’ meetings, I was always called upon to assist an Army officer in writing the speech. For these special assignments, I was accountable to Colonel Albert rather than to Virgil Walker.\n\nAfter living at the Lutz for six weeks or so, Hetty and I were moved into a small apartment near the city park and not far from the railroad station. The apartment was completely furnished and we were then eligible to have a maid. As a member of the occupation forces I was entitled to family quarters, a maid, medical services, and public transportation, without cost to me. Both Hetty and I had official passes which gave us the same privileges as Army Officers had. German citizens were still rationed for a number of food items so we did our grocery shopping at the Army Commissary.\n\nAbout the 1st of December Hetty and I paid a visit to our doctor at the Army Hospital in Heidelberg. We had already agreed on delivery of the baby by Cesarean operation. After a final examination and conference, the doctor, an Army Captain, set the time and date of the operation at 9.00 a.m. on December 22. I was instructed to bring Hetty to the hospital the previous day. I do not remember what all we did during the three weeks Hetty and I waited for the so-called ‘blessed event’. There is just so much preparation that can be made. I had employed a maid soon after we moved our few personnel belongings into the apartment. We had never had a maid and didn’t really need one until the baby carne, but all of our American friends had maids, so I guess we were just keeping up with the Jones’s!\n\nOur first maid was Margaret, a very plain young woman who had grown up on a farm near Heilbronn, east of Karlsruhe. She had younger brothers and sisters and we regarded that as a plus. She was married to a scholarly student who was attending the Technical University in Karlsruhe. We soon learned that Margaret’s parents had not approved of the marriage. As a consequence, the young couple left their home community and were living without assistance from their families. In post-war Germany that was difficult. She and her husband lived in one room in the very top of a private home. From her description I would say it was what we would call an attic. She was a good maid except that she was a poor cook, and spoke almost no English at first. Unfortunately, Margaret left us after eight months, when she and her husband emigrated to South Africa.\n\nLetters from home were an important part of almost every day. Our mail was delivered to my office but letters were never opened until I got home in the evening. I remember I was asked to report at the mailroom one day to identify a package addressed to me. The package was crushed and had a very strong odor. When I took the package apart in a garbage can, I found it contained the remains of a badly spoiled head of lettuce. The return address on the package could not be read. When I got home I told Hetty about the package and she admitted writing to Pauline Brayton in Little River that the one thing she missed in Germany was a head of lettuce. As a joke Pauline and Dan had wrapped a head of lettuce and mailed it to us. Unfortunately, the package traveled by ship and was more than two weeks in transit. I believe the only person who didn’t think it was all a very funny practical joke were the men in the Post Office. In time, our friends in little River all heard about it.\n\nFinally, December 21st arrived and Hetty and I kept our appointment with the doctor in Heidelberg. I would be less than honest if I did not admit that I was nervous. From what the doctor told us, I knew this would probably be our only opportunity to have a child. He also told us the baby would probably be a girl because examinations showed the baby had small bones.\n\nHetty was calm and seemed not at all nervous when the doctor received us. After asking if we had any questions about the operation, he assured us there was nothing we should worry about, and told me I was dismissed until the next morning. If I wished to see my wife before surgery, he said, I should be at the hospital by 7 am.\n\nThat evening DSD Headquarters held it’s annual Christmas Party in Karlsruhe. It included American and German personnel with spouses. Hetty would have enjoyed the party, of course, but under the circumstances she was excused and I got more attention than I really deserved. The German secretaries particularly took notice of Hetty’s absence and asked about her. I told them I had taken her to the hospital that afternoon. Then they wanted to know when the baby was expected. To this answer, “Tomorrow morning” (or “Morgen fruh” if they asked in German), they broke out laughing, of course, and said that was just like a man who thinks he knows exactly when a baby would be born. I didn’t explain.\n\nI don’t think I slept much that night. I remember I got an early start to Heidelberg and arrived at the hospital shortly before 7:00 am. However, a nurse told me Hetty had already been taken to surgery and I might as well take a long walk as there would be nothing to report before 9:00. The Neckar River was about two miles from the hospital and it was where I took my walk.\n\nWhen I walked into the hospital at 9:00 am. a nurse was looking for me. The smile on her face was encouraging, so I leaned against the wall to hear whatever news she had for me. She must have done this numerous times before because it was quite a ritual. She began by saying I had just become a father and she gave me the exact time. The baby weighed 6 lbs. and 1 oz. After what seemed like an age, she got around to what I was waiting to hear, “Your wife and son came through the ordeal very well and you will be seeing them both in about an hour.” When she said ‘son’ I might have fainted if I hadn’t been learning against the wall. I was expecting a daughter, but I guess I really wanted a son.\n\nHetty was as surprised as I, and I remember her eyes opened wide when I said, “Thank you for giving me a son!” She looked at me intently and said, “Are you sure?” We had picked two names – Judy and Hubert, just to be on the safe side.\n\nOn the way to Hetty’s room, the nurse had taken me past the nursery where two babies were lying in bassinets behind the glass partition. When the nurse stopped to look at the babies, I assumed one of them must be Hubert. Sure enough, the smaller of the babies wore a bracelet with the name “Hubert” showing plainly.\n\nI cannot recall clearly the events of the thirteen days that passed before the doctor permitted me to take Hetty and Hubert home with me. I do remember making the telephone call that was expected by our families in Kansas. It had been agreed that I would call Mabel in Hutchinson and she would call Dorothy in Harper. Those two would spread the word that would have to do until I could find time to write letters.\n\nSince Hetty and Hubert would be in the hospital on Christmas Eve, it had been arranged that I would have dinner that evening with Frau Steindamm and her two maiden daughters, Brigette and Inge. Herr Steindamm was still being held as a prisoner-of-war by the Russians. Brigette, in her early 20’s, was working as a maid for one of the American DSD couples in Karlsruhe, and had been the first adult German we met. Through her we came to know her mother and sister who lived in Heidelberg about a mile from the hospital.\n\nHetty had a normal recovery from her surgery but there was a problem with Hubert when the formula the doctor prescribed didn’t seem to agree with him. He weighed only 6 lbs. 1 oz. at birth and soon lost a pound. Hetty could have gone home at the end of five days but the doctor said Hubert would have to stay in the hospital until a suitable diet could be found. Hetty also stayed.\n\nBy the end of thirteen days the situation with Hubert’s formula was straightened out I paid the hospital bill ($21.00) and carried Hubert to the car where Hetty held him on her lap for the ride to our apartment in Karlsruhe. For years afterwards, Hetty and I often recall that day as a turning point in our lives. Life for us was never the same again. Hubert’s arrival added a new dimension to our daily activities and our future plans would involve him also for many years to come.\n\nI remember my first workday at the office after Hubert was born. The German secretaries, who had asked about Hetty at the Christmas party, came at once to ask if the baby arrived. I assured them it had and that it was a boy. They congratulated me, of course, and asked when the event had taken place. I then reminded them of our conversation at the party. They laughed and said they knew that was only a guess. I said I had told them correctly, for the baby was born the next morning and they were really surprised. Later in the day I admitted to them I had known three weeks in advance that the baby would be born at 9:00 Am. on December 22nd. To explain this I added another word to my German vocabulary – Kaiserschnitt which means ‘Cesarean operation’.\n\nAlthough other DSD headquarters staff couples had children living with them. Hetty and I were the only couple with an infant. For a month or so, Hetty and the baby went out very little, if at all, for it was wintertime with snow on the ground. After that, our social activities went on almost as before.\n\nHaving a maid who had previous experience with babies helped a lot, but Hetty was very particular about Hubert and insisted on feeding and dressing him until he was five months old, except when I took over those duties for short periods of time when I was at home in the evenings and on week-ends. I was quite proud of myself when we discovered I could put Hubert to sleep better than anyone else. He was so small and I could cradle him in my hands or drape him over my shoulder and walk slowly around the room a few times, humming the tunes of lullabies I recalled from my own childhood, until he gave a deep sigh and was sound asleep.\n\nThe close association with Fred and Ina Miller that began when we arrived in Karlsruhe, developed into a mutually enjoyed friendship after Hubert was born. They took such a liking to Hubert that they seemed like members of our family. When I was traveling during the week, Hetty and Ina were usually together at some time each day. As Hubert became older he regarded the Millers as ‘Uncle Fred’ and ‘Aunt Ina’. The Millers also had a maid, Frau Bullman, who became a part of our extended Karlsruhe family, which also included Virgil and Bonnie Walker, of course.\n\nMy official duties as Chief of the German Language Section, and other assigned projects, continued to be challenging, demanding, and enjoyable. Colonel Albert assigned still another project in the spring of 1950, which I accepted with enthusiasm.\n\nI believe I mentioned before that the official emphasis of U.S. Military Government at this time was to improve German-American relations in the U.S. Zone. Colonel Albert called me into his office soon after the first of the year to say that a committee was being formed at USAREUR Headquarters in Heidelberg in order to formulate the program required to implement the new emphasis. He said he was appointing me to represent DSD on that committee which would consist of five members and be headed by a General, whose name I have forgotten. Colonel Albert said my responsibility would be to formulate in writing the part the U. S. Dependent Schools should play in improving German-American relations.\n\nI had never served on a committee with a General before and so was impressed with the first meeting at which I was the only civilian. It was a ‘get acquainted’ meeting at which the General explained the purpose of our meeting. After that he made individual assignments and explained that the program we were concerned with was a priority for which we had three weeks to prepare and present it in final form. The General said our unit commanders had been instructed to excuse us from our regular duties until this project was completed.\n\nAfter consulting my supervisor, Virgil Walker, and other DSD staff members who would be concerned with the program I formulated, I also called a number of school principals to explain what I was doing and ask for suggestions. Karlsruhe was capital of the State of Baden and had its own Ministry of Education. The officials I consulted there were in full agreement with the proposals I made and promised full cooperation.\n\nMost of the three weeks I devoted to this project were spent in a private room where I would not be disturbed. My secretary, Freda, took notes on all phone calls and left them on my desk. By working long days and a few evenings, I had my first draft completed early on the third week and discussed my work with Colonel Albert, who made no suggestions except to say he would approve the proposed program if I would first get the approval of Walker, Meyering, and Miller. Since I had consulted these men several times before, that was no problem.\n\nA week after I submitted my report to the committee in Heidelberg, Colonel Albert called me to his office to say my portion of the committee report had been accepted as submitted and would be distributed by USAREUR Headquarters to all military installations in Germany. Before I could respond, Colonel Albert deflated my ego by saying, “Stutzman, now that we have gone on record as having a program to improve relations between Germans and ourselves, I want you to know that I don’t care if we do any of those things, or not.” Then he dismissed me after thanking me for the work I had done.\n\nWhen I told Virgil Walker what the Colonel had said, he turned red and looked as hurt as I felt. I didn’t mention the incident to anyone else but I remember that I never saw Colonel Albert afterwards that I didn’t recall his statement. In the meantime working with schools principals, I continued to promote the exchange and cooperative activities started earlier with German school personnel.\n\nAs time passed, Hetty and I became aware of something taking place between some Americans and Germans that wasn’t entirely above board. Americans with the occupation forces in Germany were not allowed to have American currency, but instead were issued script, which Germans could not have legally. Script could be spent only at the Army Commissary and PX. Americans could, however, buy legally, German marks at exchange rate of 42 Marks for $1.00. Two items which the Germans wanted especially were cigarettes and coffee, but couldn’t get on the German market, except at a very high price. Both these items were rationed for Americans at the PX and Commissary but the ration allowance was liberal and the cost quite low. For instance, an American could buy a carton of cigarettes for $1.00 at the commissary and exchange it for 50 Marks from a German of the black market. That explained why a few of our American friends wanted us to give them our extra cigarettes and coffee coupons. Hetty did not smoke, neither did Hubert, although I was given cigarettes and coffee ration coupons for the both of them. We both regarded the black market as illegal and, fortunately, by the time we learned how the game was played, the black market was discontinued by stricter law enforcement, which also stopped the monthly trips to Switzerland by some of the Americans to exchange illegal German marks for American dollars at the legal exchange rate. Because it was a hush-hush subject, we never learned exactly how long it bad been going on.\n\nI should have mentioned above that most of the local black marketing by Americans were done by women and single men, probably because they did most of their shopping at the commissary and PX, and also because German police and MP’s paid less attention to them. I do recall one incident when the wife of a U.S. military officer was shopping in downtown Karlsruhe while dressed very casually. The German Police mistook her for a prostitute and arrested her. When she was unable to identify herself as American, she was taken to the U.S. post commander for questioning. After her true identity was established, her husband, a lieutenant, was called in and reprimanded for allowing his wife to go downtown without being properly dressed.\n\nEven though almost five years had passed since the war in Germany had ended, there were some American military personnel who still regarded all Germans as enemy and treated them very badly. In my opinion the Germans were well behaved and properly respectful when speaking to persons they knew to be Americans. Soon after our arrival in Karlsruhe, before my German was as fluent and proper as it later became, I was shopping in a German market and using the German I knew best – a mixture of Pennsylvania Dutch and high German. I felt the man who waited on me was not particularly polite and mentioned this to a German friend later. He was surprised and asked if the man knew I was American. He concluded that the merchant had mistaken me for a German and treated me accordingly. After that I was more careful and usually asked when I went shopping, “Does anyone here speak English?” After an English speaking person came to wait on me, I spoke only in German. Invariably I was complimented on my excellent German. By the time I explained my German background, I knew I had another German friend.\n\nWhen the weather was nice, Hetty and I took drives out into the countryside on weekends. Sometimes we went with Hubert along in the bassinet on the backseat, or on the car seat between us. Sometimes the Millers rode with us, or we with them, and we took pictures of sights we wanted to remember, but also some that were grim reminders of the war. Two of the latter were the towns of Bruchsal between Karlsruhe and Heidelberg, and Pforzheim between Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. Both Bruchsal and Pforzheim were completely destroyed during the war, the former in a night bombing raid by American bombers in retaliation for the killing of an American pilot by Bruchsal farmers after the pilot parachuted to the ground from his disabled plane. Pforzheim suffered a similar fate under different circumstances during a daylight raid by British bombers. This town of some 35,000 population lay nestled in a narrow valley with wooded hills rising on both sides. Intelligence reports indicated skilled artisans were secretly manufacturing delicate electronic instruments essential to night navigation in small shops located in private homes hidden on the wooded hillsides of Pforzheim. The inhabitants were used to hearing squadrons of British bombers fly over at high altitudes on their way to bomb Stuttgart, Augsburg, Munich, or other targets. When sirens announced the approach of bombers, everyone went to the bomb shelters until the sirens signaled ‘all clear’.\n\nOn the day of the bombing, the planes passed over as usual at high altitudes and were soon out of sight. Instead of continuing to the east, the bombers circled sharply and dropped low to approach Pforzheim at treetop level just when the workers were returning to their shops. The bombing continued about twenty minutes but when it was over, no building in the valley was left standing and some 27,000 were dead or missing. The day Hetty and I first saw Pforzheim, there were still hundreds of small wooden crosses stuck on the piles of debris, each one bearing the name of the person and the date in 1944 when the bombing took place. Other reminders of the war included blown up bridges on the Autobahn, and the remains of steel-reinforced concrete bunkers which had been a part of the Siegfried line of fortifications along the east bank of the Rhein River from north Germany to the Swiss border. It seems almost a shame to describe these ugly reminders of the war when otherwise the countryside was so beautiful and well maintained, especially the Black Forest area which stretched from Karlsruhe to the Swiss border.\n\nDuring Easter vacation, a three-day teacher-administrator conference was held in Berchtesgaden for all DSD personnel. Spouses were also included. Hubert was about four months old so we took him along. As it turned out, there were several baby-sitters available at the Berchtesgadener Hof where we stayed so Hetty was able to take the tours planned for wives while the men were attending conference meetings. At the end of the conference, Hetty and I took a sightseeing tour of our own to the beautiful area where Adolf Hitler and his close associates had private homes. All the buildings had been partially destroyed by SS troops at the end of the war. However I was able to take some pictures and to go inside of Hitler’s house. The floor had been torn out but there were planks to walk on. The glass had been broken out of the large bay window that provided a beautiful view of the valley and Berchtesgaden. Inside, I was shown the two rooms occupied by Hitler and Eva Braun, Hitler’s mistress, whenever they were at Berchtesgaden. I am glad we took that little tour because the next time we were at Berchtesgaden, Hitler’s home, and those of his associates, had been removed with no signs left to show where they had once stood.\n\nOn our return we stopped for a day in Munich to visit Everett Ruby and his wife. I had been in Munich the previous fall while visiting schools in that area. I recall that Everett and I attended the Octoberfest together and it was quite an experience. I never saw so much beer and roasted chickens consumed before. This time Everett took us to Dachau where we saw what remained of one of Hitler’s concentration camps.\n\nIn May the school year came to an end and the high schools all had commencement exercises. Hetty and I attended the one held in the banquet room of the famous Heidelberg Castle for the seniors of Heidelberg High School. A U.S. Navy Admiral gave the commencement address. I remember that we all wondered if the Admiral had stopped at the gigantic wine cask, for which the Castle is famous, to have a drink with Perkeo on his way to the banquet hall. He had difficulty reading his speech. I remember also that I hoped no German guests had been invited to hear the address.\n\nElementary schools also had appropriate ‘end of school’ programs. As was the case with all school activities, adults of the military community gave excellent support and it was often difficult to find rooms large enough to accommodate those who wished to attend school programs of any kind. In my first year I was convinced that the teachers and administrators recruited in the States for DSD schools were, in general, superior. Minimum qualifications for employment as a teacher was a BA, or BS degree and two years experience at the subject or grade level for which he, or she, was applying. Principals had to have MA degrees and five years experience, of which two were in administration. Actually the qualifications of those employed were well above these minimum requirements. An additional consideration recruiters looked for was attitude toward Germans and/or living in a military community. Another plus for the Army dependent schools was that the children from homes where the father was either a sergeant or a commissioned officer had better than average discipline. In my opinion, these children adapted better to school discipline than in average stateside communities. Military fathers generally cooperated well with school principals and teachers.\n\nWhile I am making compliments, I’ll add one more. This one is for the German children I observed walking to and from school as I traveled between American schools in the three German states that made up the American Zone. I was much impressed by the self-discipline of these children. Before I had gone to Germany, I had heard many adult Americans say, “In Germany school children are taught to obey, in America we teach them to think.” The insinuation was that Germans do not learn how to think. Several times I stopped to ask directions to the next town from groups of German school children probably 10 to 12 year olds. I did this mostly to see their reaction to a man in an official American car who asked directions in German. Soon half a dozen boys were trying to help me. When I was about to drive on, one of them asked if I was an American. I said I was and drove away with a broad Kansas smile on my face.\n\nAt the end of the school year, American teachers took one of three options. About 1/3 returned to the States, and of those who stayed and planned to teach again the following year, some elected to travel in Europe during the summer and the rest stayed on duty at their schools, or attended summer workshops at designated centers. I conducted workshops for the German language teachers, and also with American teachers who wished to promote German-American exchange programs in the communities where they were teaching. I was as busy during the summer as when schools were in session, but there was also time for travel and recreation.\n\nAs had been the practice since the dependent schools opened, two recruiters were sent to the States in February to interview teachers and administrators for employment the following school year. Because of the steadily increasing school population, this was difficult to plan. However, there were quite a few fully qualified teachers among the wives of military personnel already in Germany who could be employed and paid with non-appropriated funds (profits from Class VI ‘liquor’ stores) to fill vacancies. In fact, kindergarten teachers were all paid from these funds.\n\nSometime in the winter of 1950 tickets were being sold for the Passion Play that would be presented at Oberammergau, beginning in May and continuing through September, with from two to four performances each week. We were among the DSD headquarters personnel who got tickets for the same performance during the last week in May. I still have the original hand-written copy of the letter we duplicated and sent to our family and close friends after attending the Passion Play. That letter contains some local flavor and detail that I couldn’t possibly recall from memory. I quote:\n\n“Dear Folks – 30 May 1950\n\nWell, here we are home again after another trip. In order to give everyone as much information as possible, I’m resorting to my old tricks of using carbon copies. The first copy goes to the folks at Crystal and we hope the rest of you can read the copy you get. Hetty and I got home at 3:00 this afternoon. We left Oberammergau at 8:30 this morning. From there to Augsburg we had ordinary narrow roads lined with trees so close, and with the roads so winding, that we couldn’t make good time. Also there were many people on bicycles, walking or in slow vehicles, on the roads that passed through many villages. On this stretch of road we passed Landsberg where Adolph Hitler was imprisoned while he wrote his famous “Mein Kampf” (My Struggle).\n\nFrom Augsburg to Karlsruhe we had Autobahn (four lane highway) and we moved right along at 50 to 60 mph. We stopped for lunch at an American snack bar beside the Autobahn between Ulm and Stuttgart. The weather was nice so it was a beautiful drive with wooded hills and valleys almost all the way.\n\nHubert was asleep when we got home but woke up soon afterwards. We had a lot of fun getting reacquainted with him as this was the longest we had been away from him. Inge (the maid) said that he had been good all the time we were gone. He acted very happy to see us but he is always that way.\n\nNow I’ll have to take you back to last week to bring you up to date. I left here Thursday morning to take care of some business in Stuttgart and Augsburg and then drove on into Munich that evening. On Friday forenoon I was at the DSD High School track meet, and in the afternoon attended the Regional Superintendents’ meeting. Virgil Walker and Fred Miller were also there from headquarters. The conference lasted until 10:00 that night so I stayed overnight again in Munich, although I had planned to drive to Bad Tölz that night to see the school principal.\n\nThe weather was bad and it had rained all day so it wasn’t hard for me to decide not to drive into new country late at night.\n\nBefore I left Karlsruhe, I had arranged for Hetty to ride to Oberammergau with some of the girls from the office, one of whom had a car. Our reservations had been made at Oberammergau shortly after Christmas so we knew where we would be staying and agreed to meet there on Saturday afternoon.\n\nI was planning to drive alone from Munich to Oberammergau on Saturday, but at breakfast I ran across Sarita Davis, DSD Librarian, and she decided to ride with me rather than to go by train. About half way to Oberammergau we caught up with Fred and Ina Miller when they stopped to take pictures. Together we stopped to eat lunch as a castle at Murnau and after that we followed them to Oberammergau. They had been there before and knew the way. We arrived a little after 3:00 p. m. and Hetty arrived about 45 minutes later.\n\nIn Oberammergau we stayed in a house that was arranged to take in roomers and boarders during the Passion Play season. Eleven of us were from Karlsruhe plus two women, one from Holland and one from Munich. Our package reservations was for three days and we would attend the Play on Monday. The rest of the time we could spend as we wished but we were expected to eat all our meals at the house where we stayed. The dining room was just large enough for all of us.\n\nThe man who had originally owned the house must have been a great hunter for the walls of the dining room were covered with mounted birds and animals. A girl in Bavarian costume waited on us, not only at mealtime, but with anything that would make us more comfortable. She didn’t understand a word of English so Fred Miller and I did most of the talking with her. Fred’s German was a mixture of a dialect he had known as a boy, and what he had picked up in two years of being in Germany.\n\nHetty and I had very nice room but it was unheated. Just after we arrived the weather had turned cold so we really did need the foot thick feather ticks on the bed. In our room we had a choice of wearing coats or going to bed. They did put a stove in the dining room. We slept well the three nights we were there and the meals were very good without being elaborate. We were told the man who presently owned the house, played the part of the Apostle Thomas in the Passion Play.\n\nOberammergau is not a large town, as German towns go. At the present time the population is about 5,000, which is twice what it was before the war. The increase is mostly displaced persons (D.P.’s) from the Russian Zone. As you may know, a deadly plague was taking the lives of the people of Oberammergau in 1634 until the people vowed to present a play showing the suffering and death of Christ each ten years, if the plague which was then raging through the village would be taken away. History records that there wasn’t a single death from the plague after they had made the vow.\n\nSince that time the people of Oberammergau have presented the Passion Play every ten years. Normally the play is given on years divisible by ten but the last performance was in 1934, which was the 300th anniversary of the original vow. It was not given in 1940 because of the war. The performances this summer are the first since 1934.\n\nThere are about 1700 individuals in the play, counting the children. Formerly no one who had not been born in Oberammergau could be in the play, but that isn’t quite true this year. However, the principal actors still must be born there. No married woman can have a part. There is no make-up used on anyone. One of the first things we noticed on the streets was the men with long hair and beards, and young boys with long hair.\n\nI am getting ahead of myself. We didn’t see the Passion Play until yesterday (Monday). On Saturday night we walked through the town, looking at all the woodcarvings and paintings that were for sale. Nearly every store was featuring hand-made things. Woodcarving is the chief occupation of the people of Oberammergau, and the subjects are mostly religious. The shops stayed open till 10:00 P.M. and the streets were jammed by the thousands of people from out of town.\n\nOn Sunday morning we didn’t go to church although the bells started ringing at 5:00 A.M. The streets and churches were crowded even though it was raining. In the afternoon we took a ride with Fred and Ina Miller to see Linderhof, one of three castles built by Ludwig II, a former King of Bavaria. Linderhof was about ten miles from Oberammergau. For two hours we admired the splendor with which this castle was furnished. We were told this was the smallest of the three castles built during King Ludwig’s reign. These needless expenditures brought the State of Bavaria to near bankruptcy and finally drove King Ludwig mad and he took his own life.\n\nFrom Linderhof we drove to Garmisch which is famous for winter sports. Garmisch lies at the foot of the Bavarian Alps. Because it was a cold, rainy day we were unable to see the Zugspitze but we did see a number of other peaks covered with snow. Back in Oberammergau that evening we walked the streets again but were in bed by 10:00 P.M. for we did not want to be tired during the Passion Play on Monday.\n\nThe Passion Play theater was a 15-minute walk from where we were staying and we were in our seats before 8:30 A.M. when the play was scheduled to begin. The theater holds 5600 and I’m sure every seat was taken. There was a roof to cover the audience but the stage was without a roof. However, no plays were ever postponed because of the weather. Although our seats were well to the rear, we were in the center and could hear everything that was said on the stage. We also had a good view.\n\nPromptly at 8:30 A.M. the play began, and it ended just before 6:00 P.M. in the evening, after having a two-hour lunch intermission from 12:00 to 2:00 P.M. The play was, of course, in German, a succession of tableaus, men’s choral numbers, and street scenes with dialogue. We had bought texts of the Play before hand, an English one for Hetty and a German one for me. With them we were able to follow the course of the play very well. Fortunately, we had a beautiful day with sunshine, although a bit on the cool side. We wore warm clothes and had a blanket, so we didn’t suffer. We also rented soft rubber cushions to sit on and opera glasses so we could see in detail what was taking place on the stage.\n\nI hardly know how to describe our reaction to the Passion Play. It would seem 7 1/2 hours of sitting through a play would be tiresome, but neither Hetty nor I found the play boring in any way. The acting was superb and the scenes followed each other without loss of time. There was no chance to lose interest. The action was so real that we were moved to tears a number of times and I noted others around us were affected the same way. It would be hard to pick out any one scene and say it was the best, because tableaus, dialogue and music made every thing fit together perfectly.\n\nThe first tableau showed Adam and Eve being driven out of the Garden of Eden. Then Christ and the Apostles came to the temple in Jerusalem and the moneychangers were driven out. From then on every scene from the Bible account to the Crucifixion was portrayed. The last two scenes were tableaus showing the resurrection and the ascension. The action during the Crucifixion was so real that, according to friends of ours who had seats on the second row, when Christ was taken from the cross, it looked like they pulled real nails from his hands. The blows with which the two thieves legs were broken could be plainly heard from where we sat.\n\nIt would take too long to tell you about all the scenes but, I can assure you, they were all impressive. The remorse of Judas was most effectively brought out near the end. Hetty and I thought the Passion Play was wonderful. If we had a chance, we’d attend it again tomorrow. We wish you could have seen it with us.\n\nWe do not know what sort of people these actors are in everyday life, but they made an impression on us we will not forget. They will continue putting on the plays two to four times a week until the middle of September. If they succeed in impressing even half of the thousand who see the Play as much as they did us, we would say they kept the vow their forefathers made in 1634.\n\nAfter the play was over last night we walked around once more among the shops to admire the woodcarvings and other hand-made articles. Most of the items were too expensive for us to buy but we did buy a small wooden inlaid picture. We hope before we return home to be able to get something else. The prices now are especially high as these people must make a good profit during the years they give the Passion Play, as there may be lean years between.”\n\nI remember another highlight from my first year in Germany and that was my first trip to Berlin to visit the U.S. schools. The high school and elementary school were both housed in one building. A worsening of relations between the Soviets and the Allies had resulted in the closing of the Autobahn from Helmstedt, in the British Zone, to Berlin in 1948. This action by the Soviets closed off the supply line from West Germany to Berlin. The Western Allies countered with the Berlin Air-Lift during the winter of 1948 to nullify the effect of the Soviet blockade. The autobahn route to Berlin was again opened for restricted traffic. By the time I joined DSD, official travel to Berlin was by air or rail. I traveled to Berlin by train and one copy of my written orders was in Russian to permit me to travel through the Russian Zone.\n\nIn Berlin I stayed at the VIP Harnick House. During my visits to the schools, I told the German secretary of my former contacts with Dr. Bruno Radtke, a Berlin teacher, while he was visiting German Professor at the University of Kansas in 1930-31. I told the secretary of my desire to contact him, if he was still in Berlin. She made several phone calls and confirmed that he was now teaching in a German Gymnasium in the British sector of Berlin and lived only a short distance from the American school. I borrowed a U.S. Army car and drove to Dr. Radtke’s address. I rang the bell at the street several times before a curtain was pushed aside at a window and someone looked out. I rang again and the door was opened enough for a woman to look out. When I explained I was an American and a friend of Dr. Radtke when we was in America in 1930, she seemed satisfied and said Dr. Radtke was not at home now but she expected him soon. She then unlocked the gate so I could come in and wait.\n\nShortly afterwards I heard Dr. Radtke come in and speak briefly with the housekeeper (Dr. Radtke had never married). In a moment he came into the room where I was and instantly recognized me but couldn’t remember my name. It had been nearly 20 years since I last saw him. He came towards me with outstretched hand repeating the names of some of the German authors we had studied when I was in his class at K.U. I told him my name and then he remembered me well. He asked the housekeeper to bring tea and cookies for us. He and I conversed in English, which he spoke fluently, but his German was still the crisp enunciation I had admired so much at K.U. I remembered he was only four years older than I.\n\nTo make a long story short, we visited for almost an hour, bringing each other up to date on the past and present. He explained that he had not been a member of the Nazi Party but had served in the German Army as a traffic controller. He said the most happy day in his life had been the day he surrendered to an American tank company at the end of the war. He related this in detail, which I found most interesting. He was interested, of course, in knowing what I was doing in Germany. He said that he had some difficulty with military government about his house, which he had purchased from a Jew, who claimed he hadn’t paid enough for it. We didn’t touch the tea and cookies while we chatted. I finally had to leave. He was most appreciative of my thoughtfulness to come to see him.\n\nIt was also on this trip to Berlin that I was taken on a sightseeing tour of Berlin. This included going through the Brandenburg Gate into the Russian sector and past the ruins of the German Chancellery where Adolf Hitler and some of his staff had taken their lives as the Russian Army closed in on Berlin at the end of the war. The damage that had been done to Berlin by bombs, artillery and house-to-house fighting, was the worst I have ever seen.\n\nDuring the summer of 1950 I got acquainted with Otto Kaufman from Kansas who was employed by the State Department project concerned with rebuilding Germany and preparing the people for self-government. I had heard of Otto in Kansas and had met him once in summer school at K.U. He was also of German ancestry and spoke a German dialect. Otto urged me to apply for a position in his organization. He said they were badly in need of persons with my background in German language. Otto and I compared notes and I discovered such a transfer could lead to a nice promotion while giving me an opportunity of working directly with German educators in rebuilding their schools along lines compatible with the goals of the U.S. military government in Germany. Otto seemed to feel that I was a natural for their program, which would continue until the occupation ended. He said he had been there for two years and was returning to the States in another six months. I promised him I would inquire into the possibility of transferring and let him know what I learned. The State Department project was under the supervision of the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) located at Bonn with subordinate offices in cities where consulates would be located. Otto was working from the Stuttgart office.\n\nI discussed the matter with Hetty, who was all for giving it a try. Later in the summer we spent a day together with the Kaufman’s, and Hetty became as interested as I. I then had an informal meeting with Otto’s supervisor who assured me I was qualified and they would need me definitely by the time Otto returned to the States.\n\nKnowing I must go through the proper channels if I wanted to transfer, I went first to Virgil Walker. He at first didn’t like the idea of my leaving DSD and said I had become an important asset to the staff in the year I had been there. His objections softened some when I asked for a promotion and explained the position with HICOG would be the equivalent of a GS-12 rating in Civil Service. I was at the time a GS-10. Besides being my supervisor, Virgil was also a friend. He admitted they couldn’t match the GS-12, although he would like to, so the best he could do was to recommend me for a promotional transfer. He gave me a letter to that effect to take to Colonel Albert who endorsed Virgil’s letter (I believe he wanted to have me leave).\n\nAfter recording my intentions at the Civilian Personnel Office in Heidelberg (they kept Virgil’s letter with Colonel Albert’s endorsement), I asked for a formal interview at the HICOG office in Stuttgart.\n\nAt the interview I was informed I would have to have an FBI clearance to handle classified materials. I didn’t think that would take too long because I had been through the process in the Air Corps to qualify me for cryptography. However, it did take seven months and I had almost given up getting employment with HICOG by the time it came through. In the meantime I was kept very busy with my DSD responsibilities. I remember that Colonel Albert asked me occasionally if I had heard of anything from my application. I had suspected the Colonel was anti-German, but he did not criticize any of the German-American exchange projects I had started in the DSD schools.\n\nIn May 1983, my sister Maude gave me a packet of letters she had received from Hetty and me between 1950 and 1960. I will rely on those letters, and my memory, for material regarding ourselves during that ten-year time. A letter written to the family on 30 August 1950 follows:\n\n7755 Dependent Schools Dept. APO 403, c/o P.M. New York, NY\n\n“Dear Folks,\n\nAfter ten very strenuous days spent orienting newly recruited teachers and school administrators from the States, I’ll take a few days’ rest. The orientation sessions took place at Bad Homburg, a short distance NW of Frankfurt. I finished my part of the conference program at 3:00 p.m. and left for Karlsruhe with Colonel Albert. It was a drive of about 100 miles on the autobahn.\n\nHetty went to Strasburg, France, today with a group of ladies. She got back at 7:30 p.m. and is now getting supper. She’ll have to tell you about the trip because we haven’t had time to talk about it yet.\n\nMargot and Hubert were here when I got home, of course, so Hubert and I had to have a session. I hadn’t seen him since last Saturday morning and he cried a little when he first saw me tonight. Didn’t take long to get over it though. About 6:30 Margot fed him and put him to bed. She would have gotten supper for me but I told her I’d wait until Hetty got back. Margot is sleeping upstairs here now as her husband went to the hospital in Stuttgart Monday and may not be back for two weeks. Margot has been here for a month now and Hetty hasn’t complained so I guess she’s doing better than the other maids. She isn’t as handy with Hubert as Inga was but she is sincere and likes him. Hubert has had a bit of a cold lately and for several nights didn’t sleep well. Now he seems as lively as ever.\n\nTonight I feel like I’d been pulled through a pretty small hole. A week ago Monday and Tuesday, we had our first conferences with new teachers just arrived from the States. There were 87 in that group and, of course, there were a lot of things we had to tell them in two days. I was on the program myself three times on different, but related subjects. The subjects of my talks are: “German Employees in our Schools”, “German Language and Cultural Programs”, and “German-American Relations”. I could have talked for hours on each subject, but usually had about 20 minutes at a time.\n\nAfter that conference I was back in the office for three days catching up on work that had piled up. On Saturday morning I had to return to Bad Homburg for more conferences. Hetty had gone along to the first conferences but there was no room for her the second time. On Saturday and Sunday we repeated the orientation conferences for 72 more new teachers and administrators. On Sunday we didn’t start until 10:00 so that everyone could attend church. I attended a German Protestant Church. The service was in German, of course, but I had no trouble following the sermon.\n\nBeginning on Monday the principals and superintendents of all schools met for three days of conferences and I was on the program so often, I lost track. Then, to top it all off, we had another group of 25 new teachers arrive yesterday and I had to go through the whole program again.\n\nNeedless to say, I’m tired and hope I can take it easy for a while. School starts September 7 and I can’t expect much let-up until then. I do feel pretty good about the part I played in the orientation conferences. Quite a number of the new teachers came to me afterwards and expressed their appreciation of the work I was doing and the way I was doing it. There was an article in the Frankfurt paper “Neue Presse” about the conference and my name was the only American mentioned.”\n\nP.S. (September 1. 1950) “I feel more rested now than when I wrote the first part of this. I’m planning to take a week’s vacation the middle of September. Hetty and I have thought of going to Switzerland for four days, if we can pry ourselves away from Hubert that long. He has a little cold now and Hetty is worried about the croup. Of course, we could just stay here and I could do some fishing. Trout fishing here is really good and I’ve gotten my share.”\n\nWe decided to leave Hubert with Margot and take the four-day trip to Switzerland in mid-September. To make it more interesting we took three other Americans with us and I drove. They were the wife of a 1st Lt. (West Point) who lived in the apartment across the hall from us, and her parents from North Carolina who were visiting in Germany. They were nice people to have along and we had a good time. I have a letter written when we returned home to help me recall events of the trip.\n\nThe first day from Karlsruhe to Interlaken. Switzerland, by way of Freiburg, Basel, and Berne. The scenery we saw on the way caused us to ‘oh’ and ‘ah’ every time we came to a turn in the road. Unfortunately, Kansas has nothing like it. In one small village we were slowed down when we came upon large flocks of sheep which were being brought down from summer mountain pastures to winter valley pasture. The villagers all turned out to see the annual parade, which we joined and enjoyed until they turned off on a side road. In Berne, the capital of Switzerland, we parked and did some sight seeing. One street was particularly interesting. In addition to some clocks that did funny things on the hour, there were statues that dated back to the Holy Roman Empire, and the sidewalks were all built in under the side of the building so one could shop in the rain without getting wet.\n\nJust before we reached Interlaken, we had a flat tire and while that was being fixed the mechanic discovered a leak in the gas tank. Fortunately, the garage was near the hotel where we had our reservations. After I returned to our hotel from the garage, Hetty wasn’t in our room so I knocked on the door of the next room, thinking that was our friend’s room. Some man asked in French who it was and I said in English, “I’m looking for my wife.” There was a short pause and then a puzzled voice said in English, “You are looking for your wife!” By that time I decided I had the wrong room and left. That poor man is probably wondering still what was going on. We all got a good laugh out of it\n\nThe following forenoon I was at the garage until the gas tank had been repaired. Hetty went shopping while our friends took a tour. After lunch we drove to Lucerne – a beautiful drive through mountains overlooking lakes and alternating with green valleys. One difference from Germany we found was that in Germany one rarely sees single houses standing alone in the countryside as the people live in cities and villages. In Switzerland one sees many single houses in valleys and high up on mountains as well.\n\nWe spent two nights and a full day in and around Lucerne. It is a very popular tourist spa, similar to Interlaken, but much larger. The hotels and food were excellent We all took a guided tour of the city and in the afternoon, Hetty did some more sight-seeing and window shopping while the rest of us took a tour into the mountains south of Lucerne, which required us to travel partway by cog rail after which we transferred to a cable car. I have always been afraid of high altitudes so I got a real thrill swinging across that mile-wide valley to a higher mountain. When we were halfway across the valley, I got up enough nerve to look down and I think I may have closed my eyes the rest of the way. On the return trip I was braver and managed to enjoy the beautiful scenery, especially if I looked toward the horizon and avoided looking down.\n\nBack at the hotel in Lucerne, we told Hetty what she had missed that afternoon. She couldn’t believe I had taken the cable-car ride across a mile-wide valley between two mountains because I had never taken a ride on a Ferris wheel with her at a carnival in the states.\n\nWe had thought the Bavarian Alps in Southern Germany were most beautiful but had to admit the mountain scenery in Switzerland was even more beautiful. Although Switzerland had not been directly involved in World War II the war did have it’s effect The Swiss can produce only about half enough food for the population and, being a land-locked country, had to depend on transportation provided by countries which were directly involved in the war. About 22% of the Swiss are engaged in agriculture which is mostly cattle grazing. Some 45% are employed by industries – watch and jewelry making, and wood carving. The country depends largely on tourist trade, which was almost non-existent during the war. It was now more than five years after the war and the Swiss economy was rapidly returning to normal, as was also its industry. Prices were higher than in Germany.\n\nOur time in Lucerne had been most enjoyable and educational. Hetty had called Margot both nights to see how she and Hubert were getting along. Margot reported all was well and that Ina Miller had dropped by every day. Although we would probably miss some traveling while we were in Europe because of Hubert, we never felt like complaining about that. For our return to Karlsruhe, I will quote from my letter to relatives, written on September 23rd, 1950:\n\n“Thursday morning we left Lucerne about 8:30. Since our lunch was already paid for, we had the hotel pack lunches to take along. In Zurich we stopped to window-shop and to take a drive through the city. It is primarily an industrial city and we didn’t find it as interesting as Berne, Interlaken and Lucerne.\n\nIt started raining as we left Zurich so we had to eat our lunches in the car. We crossed the Swiss border into Germany at Schaffhausen where the Rhein River begins. From there we drove a country road along the east side of the Black Forest to Stuttgart. I forgot to say that, although Switzerland is a small country, three languages are spoken there – Italian, French and German. German was the language where we were.\n\nBy mid-afternoon I saw in the distance a castle on top of a hill. At first I couldn’t be sure it was a castle but as we got closer, I realized the road we were traveling would pass within a mile or two of the castle. We took time to drive to the castle and followed a winding, walled drive that took us to the top and gave us a beautiful country view. From the German caretaker we learned the Hohenzollernburg was the third castle on this spot. The first one was destroyed in the 15th century by war. The second one went to pieces during the period of the Reformation when unfriendly people lived in it. About 100 years ago Prussian royalty had the castle rebuilt but no one has lived in it in the meantime. It is now a museum and tourist attraction.\n\nIt was dark before we got to the autobahn at Stuttgart. We stopped to eat at a U.S. Army snack bar halfway between Stuttgart and Karlsruhe. We were home a little after 9:00 and I, for one, was very glad of it. Driving all day on unfamiliar, winding, narrow roads is quite a strain.\n\nHubert was asleep, of course, when we got home, and Margot was waiting for us. Hubert and she had gotten along fine while we were gone. Margot had hoped Hubert would have his first tooth when we go back but there was still no sign of it He did demonstrate some improvement in getting around in his playpen. We thought that was pretty good for a 9-month old youngster.\n\nYesterday I sent off five rolls of colored film and six rolls of black and white film. That will be a total of 176 snaps when we get them back.\n\nMy vacation wouldn’t have been complete without going fishing so I took care of that today. I drove south of Karlsruhe about fifteen miles into the Black Forest where I have been several times this summer and fished a small stream. I wore a raincoat most of the time as it was raining but not enough to stop me from fishing. After about three hours my creel was so full of trout, I didn’t have room for more. I had cleaned the fish as I caught them to save room for more fish. When I counted them at home there was 24, of which 7 were 7-8 inches long and the others 9-12. I don’t remember ever catching a nicer string of trout. Even Hetty was quite impressed.\n\nNow my vacation is over and I’ll be back to work next Monday. For several weeks I will be traveling quite a bit. Next week I will be in Heidelberg till Wednesday and in Munich the rest of the week. Hetty would prefer I didn’t have to travel so much but knows that is part of my job.\n\nBy the way, don’t be surprised if we change our address one of these times. I have several fair chances for other positions here and all of them would be good promotions. I like my present work but the other positions would give me more opportunities to work directly with German school officials. So few Americans here can speak German as well as I and that is what gives me an advantage.\n\nUnless Hetty has something more to add, you’ll have to call this a letter. It isn’t a good one but it would take too long to do justice to our trip to Switzerland.”\n\n“Hello – Ralph has written all the news so I’ll just sign our names. Hope this finds you folks fine. We are. Hubert is quite the lad and is growing up so fast. Write:\n\nWith Love,\n\n(Hetty, Ralph & Hubert)”\n\nA letter written a month later contained the following:\n\n“Hubert will be ten months old tomorrow and he is almost ready to walk. His toilet habits are improving too. I don’t think he has missed in two weeks or more, but he still doesn’t have a tooth. I’ve been expecting Dorothy to send those old false teeth we’ve been passing around in the family for years. Last year we sent them to Francis.\n\nMy work is heavy. The past month I’ve traveled a lot, visiting schools and then when I get back to the office, the paper work is really piled up. Our social life is also ample so we don’t have time to get bored.”\n\nAlmost before we knew it, Christmas, 1950, came and went. I remember the Walkers invited us to spend Christmas with them. They lived in a large German home in Durlach, about three miles east of Karlruhe. At the end of the war the house had been confiscated by the Army to provide housing for U.S. Army Military officials. I remember that Christmas probably more vividly than any other in my life because Hubert was a year old, healthy, and seemed to be concerned with everything going on around him. In one year he had become so much a part of our daily lives that Hetty and I had difficulty recalling events during our eleven years alone that had seemed important to us at the time. Life was never the same for us after Hubert’s arrival.\n\nAnother reason for remembering that Christmas was that the day seemed to provide the subject for the most beautiful Christmas scene imaginable. The temperature must have been in the 20’s and it was a still, overcast day. Large flakes of snow were falling as we drove to the Walker home. Soon the ground was covered as the flakes fell faster and faster until, by noon, we could barely see the houses across the street This continued the rest of the day and, by evening, everything was covered with snow – shrubs, trees, cars parked in the street, and the roofs of houses.\n\nWe had no thought of staying with the Walkers overnight when we left home that morning, but we had brought Hubert’s bassinet and playpen. Driving home that evening was out of the question and the Walkers seemed delighted to have us as overnight guests. The Christmas dinner had been roast goose with all the trimmings, prepared by Bonnie and the German maid. The Walkers had three children at home – a five year old, a teen-age daughter and a teen-age son. The children played their own games and entertained Hubert when he wasn’t sleeping or pestering his mother. We four adults played bridge, a game we all liked. To avoid arguments, we split up with the ladies playing against the men. Hetty and Bonnie played very well together, but Virgil didn’t follow any system in his bidding and usually insisted on playing the hand even though mine was a better hand. It didn’t seem to bother him that we frequently went set. Except for his bidding he was an excellent bridge player. Since he was my boss, I tolerated his erratic bidding and we had an enjoyable afternoon and evening, punctuated by frequent trips to the window to see if snow was still falling. Hubert was asleep in his bassinet at the usual time while the rest of us retired near midnight with large snowflakes still falling.\n\nBy noon the following day the sun was out and I don’t recall ever seeing a more beautiful sight. By mid-afternoon the U.S. Army graders had cleared the streets of more than a foot of snow and we were able to drive home. To make sure we would not get stuck along the way, Virgil followed in his car.\n\nIt was a week before the snow was gone and the Germans, young and old, took advantage of the ideal conditions for winter sports. With few cars on the streets, young folks on sleds of all sorts and adults on skis utilized all suitable available space from daylight till dark as long as the snow remained. The ice-covered city park lake near our apartment was filled to near capacity during the same time with skaters of all ages. It was hard to believe that six years before, World War II was still being fought in this area.\n\nBefore leaving 1950, I will mention briefly several impressions that belong to my first year and a half in Germany. The first of these was the strained relations that existed between the Americans and the Soviets. I knew something of this, of course, before we arrived in Germany, from hearsay, reading and listening to radio reports. On one of several trips to Berlin after arriving in Germany, I accompanied several other individuals in a U.S. Army staff vehicle to Potsdam in the Russian Zone, where the top officials of the U.S., Great Britain, and Russia, had met in July, 1945, to plan the strategy of the war with Japan – when, where and how the atomic bomb would be dropped; if, when, and under what conditions should Russia enter the war against Japan; conditions of surrender by Japan; and after the surrender of the Japanese, how would they and the Emperor be treated?\n\nDuring our drive to Potsdam, I noticed that pedestrians would often stop and watch us drive past I couldn’t help but see the unfriendly expressions on their faces as they recognized our official vehicle as American. Once, when we had to stop for traffic, several men stepped toward us and spit at the vehicle. The same atmosphere was evident at the site of the conference in Potsdam where we were shown the rooms occupied by President Truman, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin, and also the room where conferences were held. A large woman in uniform, identified by our guide as a Russian guard, followed us wherever we went, staying near enough to hear everything our guide said. He had told us in advance that he would say some things unfavorable to the U.S. while showing us around Potsdam, as this was required by the Soviet government. I remember he showed us damage to the furniture in the room occupied by President Truman and the American delegation and made it very clear that the Americans had caused the damage and had not offered to pay for it. As for the Russian guard, she listened intently to all our guide said without changing the stony expression on her face. I felt more comfortable when we returned to West Berlin.\n\nThere was also an American school in Nürnberg where the military Tribunal, created by the U.S., Russians, British, and French, tried 22 high German officials as war criminals between November 1945, and October 1946. The crimes for which they were tried were, primarily, the operation of concentration camps, in which millions of Jews and other victims of the Nazis were tortured and exterminated. At the end of the trials, 19 German officials were found guilty, and sentenced to die.\n\nAfterwards some people questioned the legality of the Nürnberg Trials. Winston Churchill was quoted as saying they created the dangerous precedent that “the leaders of a nation defeated in war shall be put to death by the victors.” On my first visit to Nürnberg I was taken on a guided tour of the buildings where the prisoners were housed during the trials, and the large rooms where the hearings were held.\n\nIn the summer of 1950, the Korean War began. This at first involved North Korea and the Republic of Korea (generally referred to as South Korea), and was regarded as a civil war. With support from the Soviets, North Korea forces soon were over-running South Korea. As a part of the United Nation’s forces the U.S. became involved in the defense of South Korea and the possibility of a (third) world war was feared. American troops in Germany were alerted and plans were made to evacuate the dependents of U.S. personnel to the States if the war should spread. Because of my previous military experience I was issued a civilian uniform and given instructions to follow in case an evacuation order was issued. Had the plan been carried out, Hetty and Hubert would have been taken to the French coast to board a ship to the States while I would have remained on duty until relieved. Fortunately the Korean War ran it’s course without spreading to Europe. Gradually the excitement died down and life for us returned to normal.\n\nSoon after our second Christmas in Germany, our letter to Maude, dated Jan. 3,1951, contained the following among other items: “Hubert was well remembered for both his birthday and Christmas. He got a lot of toys although we didn’t give him many ourselves, and he also got a lot of clothes. Among others, he got two pair of Levi’s and one pair of bib-overalls and a shirt that says “I’m an old cow hand”. He also got a nice white and green trimmed Bavarian suit that one of his German girl friends knitted for him. Now I don’t know whether to make a cowboy out of him or a Bavarian mountaineer. He looks quite manly in the overalls.”\n\nWe heard from the folks that they had a nice Golden Wedding Anniversary with so many there and all of them bringing gifts which were not at all expected. They said they would be with you for Christmas and we’re waiting to hear all about that.”\n\nSome three weeks later Hetty’s letter to Maude included these bits of information:\n\n“By now you should have some pictures taken around Christmas. Yep. I’m afraid I’ve put on a few pounds. Think I’ll go on a diet. I’ve gotten down to a decent size since I had Hubert. Ralph isn’t as heavy as he was.\n\nRalph got a two-grade promotion a couple of weeks ago. He is now a GS-11. We were quite proud of him as a jump promotion isn’t usually given on a civil service job. It must have been for the extra responsibilities he has taken on. Incidentally, there was a nice raise in salary to go along with the promotions which made it even better.”\n\nMy letter of Feb. 6th 1951 to Maude revealed that:\n\n“Hubert had his first typhoid shot and put in a bad night. One of us was up with him nearly the whole night. He had a fever and his arm was sore besides some teeth trying to push through. He’s back to normal again now and you should see him walk. Did Clifford walk like a drunk man at first? Fragile things in our house are going higher and higher, and I don’t mean in price. When Hubert learns to climb, we’ll have to think of something else.\n\nI’m getting caught up on my office work now and will soon be visiting schools again. My schedule calls for visits to 18 schools before summer vacation. To do that I will cover most of Germany, going as far as Munich, Nürnberg, Berlin and Bremerhaven. I’m really hoping to transfer soon to another position and then I won’t spend so much time traveling. By this I don’t mean to give the impression that traveling isn’t interesting. I can always strike up conversations with the Germans I meet and I’ve surprised them as well as myself by how well I can speak German.\n\nThe world news over here isn’t good either but I don’t believe it is as bad as a month or so ago. The American attitude toward the Germans is improving and it had a lot of room for improvement in my opinion. We still have some cranks here who should have stayed in the States.”\n\nSoon after we arrived in Germany, Americans started constructing apartment buildings to house families of military and civilian personnel assigned to each installation. The basic floor plan used a 3-story building with four apartments on each floor. Two entrances and a stairwell provided access to six apartments at each end of the building. The basement (3/4 below ground level) provided space for a central heating unit, laundry and storage for each apartment. The space under the gable roof was used to provide live-in quarters for maids. Each one had a roof-window for light and ventilation.\n\nAs these buildings were completed, American families moved into them and thus released housing, confiscated at the end of the war, for German use. In Karlruhe a long row of these apartment buildings were built on Erzberger Strasse at the north edge of the castle forest not far from the Fiat Building where DSD offices were located. In time, an elementary school, chapel, and building to house the Officers’ Club, P.X., Commissary and Class Six Store were also located near the housing area.\n\nI do not recall the exact date when we moved from our small German apartment near the City Park to the new, two-bedroom apartment on Erzberger Strasse, but it must have been in the fall of 1950. For the next three years, Erzberger Strasse was our home. It was here that Hubert learned to walk and as he grew older, he and I often took walks through the beautiful pine forest that lay between our Little America and the castle, which had formerly been the residence of the Dukes of the State of Baden. The Millers, Fred and Ina, had the apartment across the hall from us.\n\nHousing areas, similar to the one on Etzberger Strasse in Karkuhe, were also constructed at all the other U.S. Army Posts in the American Zone. I can only assume similar family housing also appeared in the British and French Zones because funds for the construction were provided by the U.S. under the provisions of the Marshall Plan, which provided financial aid to 16 western European countries to be used to rebuild war damage. The program would also have included Russia but Russia refused to accept the financial assistance.\n\nSometime during the spring of 1951, Virgil Walker was suddenly discharged from his position as Civilian Director of DSD. The reason for his termination was rather vague but did involve a conflict between Virgil and Colonel Albert. There were rumors of black market activities involving Mrs. Walker. Another rumor involved Virgil in irregularities. I was the first person he informed that he had been fired and he asked that I not join others in the office who might try to appeal his dismissal. His words to me were something like, “Stutz”, (he was the only person in DSD who called me by that name) “Don’t get involved with the Colonel. It will only hurt you. You have a fine reputation and will soon get the position with HICOG (State Department) that you want so much. Don’t get involved in defending me.” He asked me to promise I would be neutral. Virgil and his family left soon afterwards for the States and we have never seen him since.\n\nDSD seemed not at all the same with Virgil Walker not in charge. He was only a few years older than I and we had become close friends in the short time we had been associated in DSD. Virgil never appeared in the office after the day he told me had been fired. While the Walkers were packing to leave for the States, and my spirits were at a rather low ebb, I received a telephone call in my office. It was not a familiar voice I heard coming from Stuttgart on the phone but it sounded business-like and official. The call I had been waiting for seven months to receive. I don’t recall all the details of the conversation, but when it was finished, I had a list of instructions to follow that would keep me very busy for the next week.\n\nSo it was that in May of 1951 the status of my federal employment in Germany was changed rather drastically in a few days. Instead of being a Department of the Army Civilian (DAC) employed by the U.S. Army Dependent School Detachment as German Specialist with a GS-11 rating, I was now employed by the US. State Department as Cultural Officer with an FSS-5 rating and assigned to the U.S. Consulate at Stuttgart, capital of the German State of Baden-Württemberg. The activities of the Consular offices in Germany were directed from the Office of the High Commissioner for Germany (HICOG) at Bonn, the capital of West Germany.\n\nA letter we wrote to Maude and Jess on June 2, 1951, fits in very well here and is a bit more reliable than my memory:\n\n“Today is our 13th Wedding Anniversary. For the occasion we have flowers scattered all over the place. For dinner, Hetty and I went to the Villa Hoepfner, a favorite German restaurant for Americans and then window-shopped a while.\n\nI’ve been an employee of HICOG for one week now. I will be stationed in Karlruhe so we won’t be moving for a while, at least. I expect to have an office here next week sometime. So far I have been spending my time in Frankfurt and Stuttgart, meeting HICOG people and getting oriented to my new responsibilities. Hetty went along to Frankfurt. Wednesday was a holiday and we drove 50 miles northeast of here in the Odenwald (forest) east of Heidelberg and ate our lunch beside a small stream that runs into the Neckar River. I just happened to have my fishing equipment in the trunk, so I caught nine nice trout to take home. Thursday and Friday I was in Stuttgart for more orientation, to get better acquainted with the programs being carried on in German schools and with German officials with whom I’ll be working.\n\nIt is certainly pleasant to be working entirely with civilians again. On Friday evening we attended a banquet for 200 German teachers who had been in the States a year under the HICOG Exchanges program. Besides the German teachers we also met a number of HICOG staff personnel and were both impressed by the nice treatment we got at the coffee party in Payne Templeton’s home after the banquet. Payne is my boss and w"
