        "text": "Born in Denmark, I grew up in Paris where I studied law (DEUG, licence, maîtrise). I later obtained a master’s degree in political science at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nSince 1 September 2019, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Privacy Studies, University of Copenhagen, in the field of the intellectual history of law. I focus on Hermann Conring (1606-1681) at the University of Helmstedt, and Scottish thought in 18th-century Glasgow, by analysing distinctions between private and public in natural law and natural philosophy. I also work on\n\nI was an external lecturer at the Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen, where I taught the course ‘Republicanism’ in Fall 2018-19 and ‘Cosmopolitanism’ in Spring 2019. I was an affiliated researcher at Saxo Institute, University of Copenhagen, where I held a Wimmer fellowship. I was a Wiedemann fellow at IZEA, University of Halle–Wittenberg (January-April 2017). I was also a visiting researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich.\n\nI have a working proficiency in Danish, English, French, Italian, and a conversational proficiency in German and Spanish.\n\nI defended my PhD thesis, entitled ‘A Cosmopolitan Republican in the French Revolution: The Political Thought of Anacharsis Cloots’, on 23 March 2018. The thesis is a major reappraisal of the political thought of Cloots, a fascinating and neglected representative of the late French Enlightenment, in the intellectual context of the European Enlightenment. It argues that a movement, that I call ‘cosmopolitan republicanism’, was developed during the French revolution, and defines what was cosmopolitan about it and what kind of republicanism it envisioned."
