        "text": "This paper describes the changes in the recognition of universities made or proposed in England, Australia and the US since 2004 and posits a broad shift from the permanent designation of institutional types to the periodic recognition of qualification-granting authority. This is associated with increased private funding and operation of universities, which in turn is associated with a shift from elite to mass higher education.\n\nThis item should consist of 2 papers listed below The first sub-item (a), (written in Swedish) is not included here but can be retrieved in html-format under the title \"University and Society\" at the site https://archive.org/details/WorkEnvRefs_201802 . (a) A list of selected texts on the idea and practice of university: citizens' transdisciplinar intellectual concerns in politics, ethics and theology. (b) An expense international bibliography on the the relation of university and society. It includes Ivanov's works in the area, and criticism of the changes in the university as institution, with emphasis on the historical mission of universities and the influence of politics, economics, commerce, industry, and administrative behavior.\n\n414 The history of the law faculties, of legal education and legal research, is a part of the history of the universities, but it is more than that. Law schools belong to two worlds: the academic and the legal, and many law professors, teachers or researchers are more familiar with legal professionals than with their colleagues from other faculties. In fact, many academic lawyers are also practising lawyers and true academics are a rare breed in law schools, only to be found in some unpractical, and hence very minor, fields like the philosophy of law. Moreover, unlike the subject of other sciences, law is not universal, but national, which means that national law, national legal culture and national legal professions have done as much to shape the law schools in the second half of the twentieth century as the global evolution of science and education, 1 which is generally disregarded by lawyers, even academics, when they discuss the history, the current situation or the reform of law faculties. Nevertheless, law schools took part in the general evolution of the European universities, 415 but sometimes the common pattern was warped by elements specific for the legal world and some evolutions were unique to law schools."
