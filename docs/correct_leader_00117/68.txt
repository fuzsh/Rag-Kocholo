TOKYO - Former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama intends to attend the memorial events in China marking the 70th anniversary of the victory of anti-Japanese war in September, local media reported on Friday.

Murayama was quoted by Kyodo News Agency as saying, "If I receive a formal invitation, I am planning to go."

The 91-year-old Murayama served as Japan's prime minister from June 1994 to January 1996.

He is known for penning the "Murayama Statement," in which he apologized for the "tremendous damage and suffering" Japan caused to the Asian people at the 50th anniversary of the World War II.

Japan invaded Northeast China in 1931 and launched a full-scale invasion in 1937.

By the end of the war, more than 35 million Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded.

China will hold a military parade and other activities to commemorate the war victory in this September.
