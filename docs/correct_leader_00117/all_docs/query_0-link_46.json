He said the development of Sino-Japanese relations not only concerns the \"fundamental interests\" of both countries and peoples, but also imposes an impact on peace, stability, development and cooperation of Asian-Pacific region and the world at large.\n\nFacing the current difficulties in bilateral relations, Tang said, political parties and statesmen of the two countries should make positive efforts to maintain the overall situation of friendly cooperation between China and Japan in line with the spirit of being \"highly responsible\" for history, the future and the people.\n\nMaehara, the 43-year-old newly elected party leader, said his party sticks to the policy for Japan-China friendship and supports China's peaceful development.\n\nHe urged the Japanese leaders to stop visiting the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors the convicted class-A World War II criminals.\n\nMaehara also voiced his hope that the Japanese leaders would abide by relevant understandings reached by the two governments and adhere to the spirit of \"Murayama Statement,\" which was made by former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama on Aug. 15, 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the World War II.\n\nIn that statement, Murayama made a clear apology for Japanese crimes before and during the war and expressed deep remorse over the tremendous damage and suffering his country brought to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations.\n\n\"To overcome the difficulties of the current Japan-China ties, the Democratic Party of Japan is ready to conduct dialogues with the Chinese side in related areas, continue to increase mutual understanding and promote the bilateral ties back to the track of healthy development at an early date.\" Maehara said.\n\nThe Japanese delegation is visiting China at the invitation of the Communist Party of China.\n\nEnditem"
