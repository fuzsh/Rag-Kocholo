EDWARDS Department of Communication, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States The author examines community-focused apologies within inter- national affairs. Specifically, he argues that this form of rhetoric functions as a rhetorical first step to healing relationships that have been hurt by the transgressions one group committed against another. In international affairs, transnational actors, typically nation-states through their political leaders, articulate com- munity-focused apologia to mend relations between peoples, which may serve build a common path toward peace and deepen relationships between these actors. To illustrate this idea, he uses Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama’s 1995 apology for crimes Japan committed during its wartime past. Murayama’s apology was an important step in mending relations between Japan and its neighbors. This article provides a better understand- ing as to the motives and options rhetors may use in apologizing for past injustices and serves to broaden the way we conceptualize the rhetorical genre of apologia.

In the 1990s, there was an explosion of apologetic gestures by individuals and organizations all across the United States who apologized to groups for wrongdoings that occurred years, if not decades, earlier. 1 At a global level, there was also a sudden increase of apologia. Leaders from Japan to Germany to the United Kingdom apologized for transgressions that occurred years, decades, even hundreds of years earlier. 2 These apolo- gies at both the national and international levels became so prevalent that one reporter stated the 1990s ‘‘turned out to be the decade of the group apology’’ (Leo, 1997, p. 17). What was peculiar about these mea culpas was that no immediate exi- gence was apparent to warrant the need for an apology, and rhetors who expressed these speech acts did so without defending the image of a group or individual. This peculiarity begs the question: Why were so many rhetors apologizing for these past events? Part of the answer, I argue, comes in understanding a different form of apologia, what I call community-focused apologia. This type of apology is a speech act directed toward communities— organizations, races, ethnic groups, even nation-states—to repair shared bonds harmed by one community’s transgressions against another. Rhetors who use community-focused apologia have different rhetorical goals than those who use traditional apologia, for the former type of apology is a rhetorical step to repair rifts within human relations caused by past injustice. Rhetors engaging in community-focused apologies are motivated to begin the process of healing between communities, instead of repairing one’s self-image as with traditional apologia. As the world grows more inter- dependent, we continue a march toward a global community where people, organizations, and nation-states are forming stronger communal bonds. However, interdependence also brings to light historical wrongdoings hidden by the forces of the Cold War, political repression, historical amnesia on the part of a nation-state or other cultural, social, or political elements (Trouillot, 2002). These misdeeds can serve as an impediment to restoring and strengthening communal bonds in a global community. It is here where community-focused apologia in international relations, what I call inter- national apologia, will find a niche, for it can help resolve old conflicts, start the process of forgiveness for past sins, and put communities on the path to reconciliation (Shriver, 1995; Tavuchis, 1991). 3 Aaron Lazare (1995) summed up this position best when he stated ‘‘as the world becomes a global village, apologies are growing increasingly important on both national and inter- national levels ... in this international community, apologies will be vital to the peaceful resolution of conflicts’’ (para. 36 & 37). In order for relations between communities, especially nation-states, to be rebuilt and expanded, past crimes must be discussed and reconciled. International public apologies 318 J. A. Edwards"
