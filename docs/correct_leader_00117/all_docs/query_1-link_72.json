        "text": "FIFTY years after the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea and 70 years after the end of the Second World War, Tokyo and Seoul are locked in a highly charged dispute over Japan’s responsibility for the “comfort women” system that Imperial Japan established during the war. What the critics call “sexual slavery” was set up to provide sexual service to Japanese soldiers on the front lines of the war. It imposed physical and psychological pain and indignity on over 200,000 women from Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and other countries, including the then Dutch colony of Indonesia.\n\nIn August 1993, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono officially acknowledged Japan’s responsibility for the comfort women system and offered his government’s apologies to the victims. He said: “The government of Japan extends its sincere apologies and feelings of remorse to all those, irrespective of place of origin, who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds as comfort women.”1 In August 1995, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama expressed deep remorse and apologized for the suffering endured by many, especially in Asia. He said:\n\nDuring a certain period in the not too distant past, Japan, following a mistaken national policy, advanced along the road to war, only to ensure the Japanese people in a fateful crisis, and, through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations. In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology. Allow me also to express my feelings of profound mourning for all victims, both at home and abroad, of that history.2\n\nThis statement was endorsed by all succeeding prime ministers of Japan, including Shinzo Abe during his first term in office in 2007.3 However, the second Abe administration announced in March 2014 that it was going to review the process through which the Kono statement had been prepared and issued, and this alarmed neighboring countries and many critics in Japan, who feared that this was an attempt by the conservative government to cast doubt on the credibility of the Kono statement and an effort to whitewash the history of Imperial Japan’s military aggression.4 Rumors swirled that the Abe administration was also considering distancing itself from the Murayama statement.\n\nFaced with a chorus of criticism from both inside and outside Japan, Abe announced in March 2014 that his government would uphold the Kono and Murayama statements,5 the position he reiterated in the statement he issued on Aug. 14, 2015, the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. However, his statement made only a very brief reference to the comfort women issue. The relevant section of the statement read, “We must never forget that there were women behind the battlefields whose honor and dignity were severely injured.”6 In this author’s view, the extreme brevity of this reference — just 18 words in the 1,664-word English version of the statement — and the absence of the commonly used term “comfort women” reflect the Abe administration’s aversion to the issue and its unwillingness to treat it as a priority issue.\n\nJapan Admits Responsibility, Or Does It?\n\nIn June 1995, the Murayama government announced the establishment of the Asian Women’s Fund, and by 2005 the fund had disbursed compensatory payments to 285 former comfort women in South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines.7 The fund’s compensation typically amounted to 2 million yen per recipient and was accompanied by a Japanese prime minister’s letter expressing remorse and apologies. The government also allocated about 75 billion yen in medical welfare aid for former comfort women. The compensation and medical aid were distributed in the Philippines (at 1.2 million yen per person), Korea (3 million yen), and Taiwan (3 million yen). In the Netherlands, the Asian Women’s Fund disbursed about 3 million yen in medical aid to each of 79 former comfort women. Additionally, in response to the Indonesian government’s request, the fund allocated 37 billion yen toward the construction of senior citizens’ welfare facilities in Indonesia, including a facility built in 2006 that housed former comfort women. The fund ended its operations on March 31, 2007, after completing the last of its projects in Indonesia.8\n\nThese measures fell short of meeting the expectations of many former Korean comfort women and their supporters. The fund was managed by non-governmental volunteers and included Japanese citizens’ private donations, not government funding, and for these reasons many Korean women refused to recognize the Japanese apologies and offer of compensation.\n\nAt the Asian-African Summit in Indonesia in April 2015, which commemorated the 60th anniversary of the Asian-African Conference (known better as the Bandung Conference), Abe expressed “deep remorse over the past war,” but stopped short of offering apologies.9 In his historic address to the joint session of the US Congress on April 29, 2015, the Japanese prime minister offered “eternal condolences” to US victims of the Second World War,10 but he did not explicitly apologize for the comfort women issue and only alluded to it by stating, “Armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most.” He added: “In our age, we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses.”11 This clearly disappointed Korean and other critics of Abe’s evident refusal to offer a formal apology for this issue.12 Most recently, as noted above, the prime minister made only a passing reference to the issue in the statement he made on Aug. 14, 2015.\n\nLegal Implications and International Criticisms\n\nIs the Japanese government today liable for Imperial Japan’s violation of the human rights of the wartime comfort women? The Japanese government says it is not. It argues, inter alia, that:\n\na) Recent developments in international criminal law may not be applied retroactively;\n\nb) The crime of slavery does not accurately describe the system established through the “comfort stations” and that the prohibition against slavery was not, in any event, established as a customary norm under applicable international law at the time of the Second World War;\n\nc) Acts of rape in armed conflict were not prohibited by either the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention No. IV of 1907 or by applicable customary norms of international law in force at the time of the Second World War; and\n\nd) The laws of war would only apply, in any event, to conduct committed by the Japanese military against nationals of a belligerent State and would not, therefore, cover the actions of the Japanese military with respect to Japanese or Korean nationals, since Korea was annexed to Japan during the Second World War.13\n\nThe Japanese government also rejects individual demands for compensation by former comfort women. It asserts that “individual ‘comfort women’ have no right to such compensation” and, alternatively, that “any individual claims that these women may have had for compensation were fully satisfied by peace treaties and international agreements between Japan and other Asian States following the end of the Second World War.” The Japanese government also asserts that “any civil or criminal cases concerning the Second World War rape centres would now be time-barred by applicable statute of limitations provisions.”14\n\nThe Abe government’s claims find support among conservative nationalists and historical revisionists in Japan. Most pointedly, they argue that there is no evidence showing the Japanese military was directly involved or that coercion was used in the recruitment, transportation, and retention of comfort women. They have relentlessly criticized the liberal Asahi Shimbun newspaper for the articles it published in the 1980s and 1990s based on the claims by Seiji Yoshida that he was involved in the forcible recruitment of Korean women in Jeju Island into the comfort women system. His assertions, published in a book in 1983,15 were later found to have been fabricated, and on Aug. 5, 2014, the Asahi Shimbun retracted its articles on comfort women based on Yoshida’s false assertions.16 Prime Minister Abe, the conservative daily Yomiuri Shimbun (with the largest circulation in the country) and Sankei Shimbun, as well as many conservative figures, pummeled the Asahi Shimbun with criticism, claiming that the liberal newspaper’s erroneous reports had seriously damaged Japan’s image in the world.17\n\nHowever, these claims have found little international support. A report, submitted in 1998 by Gay J. McDougall, Special Rapporteur to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights’ Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, concluded that the Japanese government today is indeed liable for the wartime comfort women issue.18 The appendix to the report, entitled “An Analysis of the Legal Liability of the Government of Japan for ‘Comfort Women Stations’ Established during the Second World War,” concludes: “The Japanese Government remains liable for grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law, violations that amount in their totality to crime against humanity.”19 The appendix further refutes Japanese claims and states:\n\nThe Japanese Government’s arguments to the contrary, including arguments that seek to attack the underlying humanitarian law prohibition of enslavement and rape, remain as unpersuasive today as they were when they were first raised before the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal more than 50 years ago. In addition, the Japanese Government’s argument that Japan has already settled all claims from the Second World War through peace treaties and reparations agreements following the war remains equally unpersuasive. This is due, in large part, to the failure until very recently of the Japanese Government to admit the extent of the Japanese military’s direct involvement in the establishment and maintenance of these rape centres. The Japanese Government’s silence on this point during the period in which peace and reparations agreements between Japan and other Asian Governments were being negotiated following the end of the war must, as a matter of law and justice, preclude Japan from relying today on these peace treaties to extinguish liability in these cases.20\n\nThe UN report also concludes: “The failure to settle these claims more than half a century after the cessation of hostilities is a testament to the degree to which the lives of women continue to be undervalued.”21\n\nStrained Relations with South Korea and US Concerns\n\nThe comfort women issue, along with the Japan-South Korea sovereignty dispute over Dokdo/Takeshima Island have also affected the mutual perceptions and attitudes of Japanese and Korean citizens. In the first decade of the 21st century, Japanese people with favorable views and attitudes toward South Korea outnumbered those with negative perceptions and attitudes. In 2012, however, the positive and negative sides were completely reversed, with 59 percent of Japanese respondents to opinion surveys showing unfriendly attitudes and 39.2 percent expressing friendly ones.\n\nThe reversal of the Japanese public’s positive and negative views of South Korea reflected the sudden deterioration in bilateral relations over the island dispute. In July 2012, Japan issued a new defense white paper reiterating Japan’s sovereignty claims to the island. On Aug. 10, 2012, in an apparent protest, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited the island, the first time that a South Korean president had done so in the country’s history. During the visit, Lee said, “Dokdo is truly our territory, and it’s worth defending with our lives.”22 This prompted Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda to protest, “the visit is incompatible with Japan’s position and therefore unacceptable.”23\n\nThe strained relations between Japan and South Korea are a serious concern for the United States, whose successful “rebalancing to Asia” requires the co-operation of both of its Asian allies. President Barack Obama, in a joint press conference with President Park Geun-hye in Seoul on April 25, 2015, said, “I think that any of us who look back on the history of what happened to the comfort women here in South Korea, for example, have to recognize that this was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights. Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war, was shocking. And they deserve to be heard; they deserve to be respected; and there should be an accurate and clear account of what happened.24 He then urged Japan to recognize the past “honestly and fairly,” but also called on Japan and South Korea to “look forward as well as backwards and … find ways in which the heartache and the pain of the past can be resolved, because … the interests today of the Korean and Japanese people so clearly converge,” and added, “my hope would be that we can honestly resolve some of these past tensions, but also keep our eye on the future and the possibilities of peace and prosperity for all people.”25\n\nThere is a seemingly irreconcilable contradiction between the Japanese who wish to develop a future-oriented relationship with South Korea and other Asian neighbors, on the one hand, and the Koreans, on the other, who insist that the Japanese admit their past wrongdoing in unequivocal terms, offer genuine apologies and pay compensations for those they had wronged. The issue raises difficult but unavoidable moral questions for the wartime generations of Japanese. For the postwar generations, their neighbors’ criticisms against Japan seem misplaced inasmuch as they had nothing to do with the prewar or wartime atrocities. Many of them simply want to move past the history-focused discourse with their neighbors and develop future-oriented relations with them.\n\nPast, present and Future Injustice\n\nWhat should the Japanese do? Both the wartime and postwar generations must face squarely the moral, legal and political questions raised by their prewar and wartime history, acknowledge and accept the moral and legal responsibilities that their present government has for the nation’s past wrongdoing and its lasting legacy. Imperial Japan’s violation of the human rights of the comfort women is both a historical issue and a contemporary issue. The victims of past atrocities continue to suffer the physical pain, mental anguish and indignity in part because the present Japanese government refuses to accept responsibility for the uncomfortable truths of history. The past injustice continues to this day, and as long as the Japanese do not face this issue squarely and account for it fully, it will be an issue of future injustice.\n\nTsuneo Akaha is Professor of International Policy Studies and Director of the Center for East Asian Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.\n\nBack to Issue"
