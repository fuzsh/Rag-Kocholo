One year after the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, it is time for the governments which made commitments at Beijing and the thousands of women who helped shape the landmark Platform for Action to pause and reflect on what it has really meant to bring Beijing home.\n\nFor millions of activists in the global women's movement, Beijing has become a metaphor for transformation. While imperfect, the Platform adopted by governments last year is the strongest holistic statement on equality, development and peace to come out of any gathering of the world's nations. It is a roadmap towards a better future for all, not merely women. It calls for major transformations in human relationships as well as the ways we live, work and share the planet.\n\nThe United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women was the largest mobilization of the global women's movement to date. Nearly every country of the world and tens of thousands of people participated in the multi-year process that culminated in Beijing in September 1995. Over 40,000 women made it to China to participate in the NGO Forum, to cover the conference for the media and to negotiate and agree upon the Platform for Action. There was significant press coverage of the conference -- the personalities, the conflicts and, to some degree, the issues.\n\nNow, on the first anniversary, the world wants to know what has happened since Beijing. We assume that government representatives are also curious about what has transpired in other countries and how it compares to activities in their own. The Women's Environment & Development Organization (WEDO) has prepared this one year anniversary report, building on our six-months preliminary post-Beijing monitoring report, First Steps, to respond to this need.\n\nWhile we have taken a retrospective look one year after that unprecendented gathering in China, we have our sights set on making bold headlines in the year 2000. In that year, all governments will be called upon to present their achievements in delivering upon the goals outlined in the Beijing Platform. A year is a brief moment in the history of nations and the process of social change is long and difficult. What are realistic benchmarks by which to measure progress when trying to reverse centuries of discrimination and injustice? This survey attempts to point to the directions in which governments are going in the post-Beijing era.\n\nWhether through the first-ever action plans for women in the Pacific Island states, legal measures to penalize family violence in Latin America, new laws to correct centuries-old gender bias in property rights in Nepal, or parliamentary measures to give women a third of seats in legislative bodies in India, policies to bridge the gender pay gap in some industrialized countries, legalizing abortion in South Africa -- or simply counselling centers for women in tiny Niue, governments around the globe are discovering that they have to find ways to respond to the groundswell of change.\n\nNot surprisingly, there is very little new money on the table in any country. Most governments are looking to draw upon existing resources, but mere reallocation of a shrinking pie will not satisfy women's hunger for substantial change. Women everywhere will continue to mobilize and organize, in partnership with men and as leaders of a myriad social movements, to push their governments to deliver more than piecemeal on their promises.\n\nWhile current macroeconomic policies and the race for privatization and transnational capital are real forces for governments to reckon with, NGOs monitoring international agreements know that it is ultimately political will that is key to turning the words into action. We also know that the momentum generated during the promising Conference process is hard to sustain.\n\nTo build on the enthusiasm and creative energy unleashed during the Beijing process, governments and NGOs must continue to engage, encourage and thus empower each other. Perhaps the biggest challenge in the road to transformative change lies in the ability of both sides to build constructive partnerships, drawing upon each other's strengths and wisdom.\n\nGovernments must make it a practice to share information about progress and problems in implementing the Platform nationally and globally. The United Nations should regularly collect and update this information from governments as well as the U.N. system and NGOs so that we can learn from each other. Member state representatives to the Commission on the Status of Women should critically evaluate the state of progress and creatively develop ways to overcome obstacles, particularly by mobilizing the different parts of the UN system. And finally, women's groups and NGOs must have timely access to this information to use it in multiple and responsible ways, not only to critique government performance but their own, from the perspectives of women and civil society.\n\nThe mobilization around the Fourth World Conference on Women was the \"locomotive\" for other U.N. conferences and social processes to solve some of the world's most pressing and persistent problems. Women's groups have historically been the spark, the fuel and promise in the vanguard of change. We owe it to the world, and to ourselves, to close the gap between rhetoric and reality and to move forward, step by step, in our common goal to improve the lives of women and girls everywhere. As we progress towards this goal, we will create a better future for all.\n\nBella S. Abzug\n\nPresident\n\nSusan Davis\n\nExecutive Director\n\nBack to top\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSupport for Beyond Promises was principally provided by the Technical and Evaluation Division, Gender, Population and Development Branch of the United Nations Fund for Population and Development (UNFPA). Additional support for preparatory phases was offered by the Gender and Development Section of the United Nations Fund for Children (UNICEF), the Ford Foundation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway, the Finnish International Development Agency (FINNIDA) and the Netherlands Organization for International Development Organization (NOVIB).\n\nThis report could not have been compiled without the cooperation and contributions of some 22 governments, dozens of NGOs and dedicated staff of U.N. agencies in UNFPA, UNICEF, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). We offer our sincere thanks and appreciation to all who made the effort to contribute to this collective effort, and take full responsibility for any errors.\n\nThis report was compiled, written and edited by WEDO's international staff in New York including Bharati Sadasivam, Anita Nayar, Inji Islam, Jill Crawford and Susan Davis. Everyone on the WEDO team worked extremely hard to meet impossible tight deadlines as reports came flooding in by fax in the last days of August.\n\nOur special thanks to Lead Dog Design and John S. Swift Printing for working with us to produce this report and to ProMedia for helping to publicize it.\n\nFinally, we express our abiding appreciation to the many readers of this report- people who are curious enough to pick it up and sufficiently committed to use it.\n\nBack to top\n\nIntroduction\n\nBeyond Promises: Governments in Motion One Year After the Beijing Women's Conference is a progress report on some 51 governments, and the Caribbean region and Pacific Island states. It also includes a brief report on initiatives to monitor the World Bank.\n\nWe have titled the report Beyond Promises to emphasize our expectation and the need for governments to go beyond the lipservice paid to women and the easy rhetoric on gender issues and truly deliver on the pledges made in Beijing. As Bella Abzug quipped when asked after the conference concluded what does it all mean, \"This is a contract with the world's women; it may not be legally binding but it is politically binding.\"\n\nWomen around the world are determined to hold governments to their promises and see that they fulfill their bargains. Legislators and public officials are joining forces with grassroots activists to create political accountability for promises made at U.N. fora. For example, in the United States, hundreds of women's organizations joined in the Contract with Women in the USA campaign launched by WEDO and the Center for Women's Policy Studies. The Contract, summarizing the Beijing Platform in ways that relate to Americans, has also been endorsed by over 30 members of Congress and 300 state legislators.\n\nThe Contract campaign was adapted to women's needs in Costa Rica and launched by the Arias Foundation and other NGOs on March 8th. A special Contract with Nigerian Rural Women campaign was initiated by the CountryWomen's Association of Nigeria. In Brazil, officials in federal ministeries and in six cities signed protocols commiting themselves to implement specific items in the Women's Conference platform. All of these initiatives point towards greater accountability, to take us beyond promises.\n\nWe have benignly described governments \"in motion\" a year after Beijing to create a less judgmental atmosphere of neutrality. It is easy to be cynical. Too many choreographers can lead to processes that sound all too familiar to bureaucracy-watchers. While many of the motions may resemble carefully orchestrated \"political ballet,\" we do not wish to make premature judgments that might undermine the first steps of hesitant dancers seeking to find their footing.\n\nAll too often we assess actions that appear to be one step forward, two back, given the economic climate of the day. In better cases, we can point to two steps forward, one back. But this is the rhythm of dancing and why governments in motion are better bets than those who are not.\n\nWhether one seeks a steady drumbeat, a hot samba, steamy salsa or formal minuet, all governments are waltzing around the toughest provisions tacked on the Platform that asks them to really move.\n\nWe will let you be the judge of whether governments are merely going through the motions or doing a serious tango.\n\nBack to top\n\nMethodology\n\nThe methodology used for Beyond Promises was a survey of all governments, supplemented with NGO reports. It involved several steps, including publishing an interim report on March 8, six months after Beijing, titled, First Steps: What Has Happened Since Beijing? This was a preliminary progress report of a sample of 25 countries and the CARICOM region of the Caribbean. It was strategically produced to be in time for distribution at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women meeting in New York, March 11-22, 1996.\n\nThe Commission is the official body at the U.N., comprised of some member states, charged with the responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the Platform for Action implementation at the global level. By assessing the state of implementation efforts after just six months, we hoped to set the stage for a more robust set of concrete accomplishments by the first year anniversary in September 1996 which are described in this report.\n\nFor both reports, WEDO understood that all governments would be in the early stages of implementing the Beijing Platform, and designed a very simple questionnaire covering six areas (see appendix A). The questions were formulated to enable every government to report on something positive. It was also patterned on the One Year After Cairo report prepared by the Natural Resources Defense Council, WEDO and NGOs that are part of the Earth Summit Watch, to assess national action to implement the International Conference on Population and Development.\n\nOn behalf of WEDO, co-chair Bella Abzug wrote to all Ambassadors at the U.N. missions in New York in January with a request for information on activities their governments have taken since Beijing to \"turn the words into action.\" WEDO chose to work through U.N. missions to increase the political linkages between negotiating the U.N. conference agreements and implementation. The U.N. is often attacked as being a \"talk fest\" without concrete results to show for all its conferences. It is in the best interests of the U.N. for representatives of member states to be informed and conversant about conference outcomes and implementation efforts not only for their own country but globally. WEDO wanted U.N. mission representatives to officially transmit our request and contact the relevant persons in their national capitals to secure a response.\n\nWEDO requested to receive their responses by the end of February to prepare a report in time for the opening day of the CSW. Because of the short amount of time to respond and the early stages of implementation activities, WEDO expected to receive only a small sample of country reports from governments.\n\nTo supplement official responses, WEDO contacted a small number of more active members of the global network for quick intelligence gathering and reports on government implementation. WEDO, Interaction and the International Women's Tribune Center also developed a \"Country Commitment\" monitoring chart which was widely disseminated by all three international networks. It was included as Appendix C in the First Steps report. Sources for all reports were identified.\n\nWEDO distributed hundreds of copies of First Steps to members of the CSW and other NGOs during the meeting in an attempt to persuade governments to agree to making annual progress reports. Unfortunately, the WEDO-facilitated Women's Linkage Caucus was not successful. The CSW will prepare a comprehensive status report on implementation only in 1998 and the year 2000. In the interim, sectoral reports will be prepared on clusters of the Platform for Action related to the five-year review of other relevant U.N. conferences.\n\nFor example, in 1997, the U.N. will review the five years since the Earth Summit and the CSW will review, among other items, the status of implementing the Women and Environment section of the Platform and related sustainable development sections on access to economic structures. In 1998, the focus will be on human rights linkages and in 1999 the emphasis will be on health and links to the Cairo Population and Development conference agreement.\n\nAfter the CSW meeting, WEDO distributed First Steps to every U.N. mission with a request to provide an update or a new submission by July 1996 to be included in the one-year anniversary report. In exchange, WEDO promised to distribute copies to all governments.\n\nIn addition to contacting governments by letter and, as time allowed, by fax and follow-up phone calls, WEDO reached out to NGOs and monitoring networks in individual countries for assistance in preparing country reports. These sources were supplemented with contributions from U.N. agencies including UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP and UNIFEM. Sources are identifies for all reports and footnotes have been used for reports with multiple sources. All of the submissions have been edited by WEDO.\n\nBecause just under half of the reports include responses from governments, we do not attempt a systematic, statistical analysis of the information collected. Non-response to the survey and to particular questions should not be interpreted as inaction.\n\nWEDO will distribute copies of Beyond Promises at the Association for Women in Development conference, \"Beyond Beijing\" in Washington D.C. September 5-8 at which some 1200 activists are expected from around the world. WEDO will hold a press conference at the United Nations on September 9 to publicize and issue the report to all member states, U.N. agencies and the press.\n\nIt also plans to use the report as a discussion tool at a three-day workshop on the subject, \"Holding Governments and International Agencies Accountable to Their Promises: Monitoring and Advocacy Strategies for Advancing Women's Agendas,\" to be held September 10-12, 1996, in New York. The workshop will have 40-50 participants, over half from the South or countries in transition, whose organizations are actively engaged in monitoring their governments or international agencies operating in their countries, and who are advocating for institutional and policy changes. The workshop will provide an opportunity for NGOs which submitted reports to critique and evalute the Beyond Promises and strategize together for future monitoring and advocacy efforts.\n\nA report on the outcomes of this workshop, including national and international watch models and advocacy strategies, will be available from WEDO in November 1996.\n\nOur intention in both First Steps and Beyond Promises was to have a geographically diverse sample of reports on what governments have done since Beijing to provide some useful insights on patterns and directions, obstacles and innovations. With this report, we hope to praise the progress to date and encourage all governments to take action to realize the Beijing consensus.\n\nBack to top\n\nOverview\n\nStock-taking exercises pose several dilemmas for the growing breed of national and international organizations engaged in the necessary and long-overdue business of monitoring U.N. conference agreements. The first is in determining the precise role these agreements have played in bringing about real or projected change in sovereign nations and among individual cultures and communities. In the vast and borderless world of 'women's issues,' it is especially hard to pinpoint actions as outcomes of specific U.N. documents.\n\nWhatever the debating points, there can scarcely be any doubt that the Beijing Platform is a unifying force propelling change in the lives of millions of women today as perhaps never before. After Beijing, there has been a virtual explosion of feminist mobilization.\n\nHowever daunting the challenge of holding governments and international agencies to their promises of social commitments, it is one that must be met in today's climate of impoverishing globalization. In fact, never has there been a greater consensus on human development at a time when conditions are so unconducive for it. Unsustainable production and consumption patterns, from economic globalization and growth that is, in the words of the UNDP's Human Development Report 1996 \"rootless, ruthless, jobless, voiceless and futureless,\"can make the race for gender equality a race to be equally poor.\n\nBack to top\n\nOpening Numbers\n\nBeyond Promises includes 53 reports from 51 countries and territories and two regional reports for the many countries of the Caribbean and Pacific Islands. While only a sample, this survey presents information on roughly half of the 189 member states that attended Beijing. Nearly 43 per cent (22 out of 53) of the reports are from government sources, although many more non-governmental sources interviewed government officials to prepare their submissions.\n\nThere is relatively good balance among the geographic regions: nine reports are from Africa, three from the Near and Middle East; ten are from Asia; five are from the Pacific including a regional report; ten are from Latin America and there is a CARICOM regional report from the Caribbean; nine reports are from Western Europe and four are from the transition countries, and there are two reports from North America.\n\nRegional distribution:\n\nRegions, # of Reports, % reports from region\n\nAfrica, 9, 17%\n\nNear/Middle East, 3, 6%\n\nAsia, 10, 19%\n\nPacific, 5, 9%\n\nLatin America, 10, 19%\n\nCaribbean, 1, 2%\n\nEurope, 9, 17%\n\nEastern Europe/FSU, 4, 7.5%\n\nNorth America, 2, 3.5%\n\nTotal 53\n\nThirty-six percent of the governments which submitted a formal response were from Western Europe. In all, governments willing to submit a response include: Austria, Botswana, Cambodia, Chile, Denmark, El Salvador, Iceland, India, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Niue, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Tanzania, Tonga, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States of America, and Zambia.\n\nMechanisms: Going Through the Motions\n\nMuch of the initial responses to the Beijing Platform have been in creating new mechanims, upgrading existing structures and energizing participatory processes. But since it is only year one, most women activists tend to give their governments the benefit of the doubt. Many recognize the goodwill gestures governments have made to disseminate the results of Beijing in local languages, to consult with NGOs and to include activists in the agenda-setting for national action plans and follow-up mechanisms.\n\nMany Latin American countries report the formation of commissions, interministerial and/or with NGO representation, to follow up on agreements. Peru has elevated the status of its commission for women, the first such since independence, by setting it up in Congress, whereas in Bolivia the committee is headed by the first lady herself.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the government has not yet taken this first step, whereas Colombia's new government office for women is hobbled by the lack of a presidential decree and the commitment of funds. In Uruguay the president has delegated authority to the Institute of Women and Family to find out what other ministeries are doing to implement the Beijing Platform. In Costa Rica, the government has set up a National Center for Women and Family which has launched an equality of opportunity plan for 1996-98.\n\nIn South Africa, the office on the status of women is being established within the presidency. Other African nations are less ambitious, settling for gender focal points in ministries, as in Zimbabwe. Interministerial commissions are also emerging up in some countries, such as Russia, Austria and Bangladesh.\n\nA heartening feature of committees formed in some parts of Asia and Latin America is the government's willingness to involve NGOs as consulting partners for the first time, both during the Beijing process and after. This is seen as an especially important breakthrough in Pakistan, where the bureaucracy has no tradition of working with members or groups from civil society. In the Republic of Korea, the national committee on women's policies, headed by the prime minister, is involving women experts and women's NGOs in the formulation of policies. There is some evidence of such partnership in Indonesia, while it is yet to happen in Malaysia.\n\nSurprisingly, some open democracies, such as Canada, New Zealand and Australia, have been strangely reluctant to involve NGOs in post-Beijing activities.\n\nMany governments are fulfilling the PFA requirement to develop a national plan of action by the end of 1996 if they did not have a plan in place. Countries with plans or processes to develop one include Bangladesh, Botswana, Canada, CARICOM, Chile, Iceland, Finland, India, Mexico, the Pacific Islands, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, and USA. A good number of countries surveyed have also translated the Platform for Action in the local language for wide dissemination, with some, like Pakistan, bringing out abridged \"user-friendly\" versions. Many also have drafted national plans of action in keeping with Platform requirements.\n\nSeveral countries, notably the Nordic nations, are drafting serious gender agendas. Japan's council for gender equality is working towards a 21st-century vision for a gender equal society. The Netherlands even boasts a ministry for emancipation affairs, whose minister has taken a new emancipation policy back to the drawing board after it was sharply critiqued by more than 30 women's organizations. In Denmark, the prime minister has set up a committee to consider changes in the organization of work for equal status between men and women. The Danish labor ministry has also started gender-proofing legislation. As donor nations, Norway and Denmark have also made gender equality a central objective in their development cooperation plans. Norway has the distinction of being among the few surveyed that has matched word with deed: it has raised its budgetary allocation for women in developing countries by NOK10 million for this year.\n\nIn a small but significant number of countries, the year after Beijing has seen the emergence of long overdue legislative actions toward gender justice, greater participation by women in political decision-making and reproductive health. The enactment of legislative measures represents signal victories for women, not only because it fulfills a central strategic objective of the Beijing Platform, but demonstrates governments' commitment to real change.\n\nWomen's Health: One Step Forward\n\nReproductive health and reproductive rights remain areas where some hard battles are being fought, and sometimes won. In Poland, four parliamentary commissions adopted a draft liberalization of the anti-abortion law in July. The bill allows legal abortions to be performed until the 12th week of pregnancy for women in difficult personal or economic circumstances. There is, however, much opposition to the proposed measure which is expected to be put to vote in the fall. In South Africa, the ruling African National Congress overcame widespread opposition from a range of forces to approve a bill allowing abortion on demand for the first time in history in the country. Endorsing the measure, the ANC has said that it reaffirmed constitutional principles of the right to privacy and personal security.\n\nIn Spain, however, a similar bill to liberalize the abortion law has fallen through for lack of support from the ruling Popular Party. The opposition-sponsored bill, moved in June, sought to give women, rather than their doctors, the right to decide on abortion.\n\nArgentina's law on reproductive health, rejected for four consecutive years, has succeeded in receiving partial sanction from parliament. Women's groups have still to secure full enactment of this modern legislation designed to protect the health of women and adolescent girls.\n\nSome emerging democracies of the former Soviet Union are making encouraging beginnings insetting up institutional mechanisms for women's health. The Ukraine, for example, has launched two initiatives, under presidential decree, on family planning and child health.\n\nViolence Against Women: Changing the Score\n\nWomen in some countries have wrested key victories in the equally contested terrain of domestic violence.In Colombia, a bill to eradicate violence in the family became law on July 16, but not without a protracted battle. Malaysia also recently became one of the few countries to enact such a law. Costa Rica has launched a national plan for the detection of family violence. Reform of the law relating to family violence is also on the cards in Peru. In Puerto Rico, the govenment has created a commission for women's affairs supported by $1.8 million budget to eradicate gender violence and improve legal, psychological and housing services.\n\nWhile laws alone cannot safeguard women, the enactment of penal and civil sanctions in domestic legislation forms an integral part of the the Platform's strategic objectives in dealing with violence against women.\n\nEgypt has sustained its post-ICPD momentum and recently banned the practice of female genital mutilation despite strong cultural opposition. Denmark, among donor nations, has targeted for special attention the practice of female genital mutilation in its plans to mainstream a gender perspective in international cooperation.\n\nSexual Exploitation: Back Tracking\n\nWith concerted actions by NGOs and U.N. agencies, governments report some encouraging initiatives to tackle the difficult problem of sexual exploitation, particularly of girls. A World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children will be convened by Sweden, UNICEF and ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism) August 27-31, 1996 to agree upon a specific plan of action to halt trafficking, prostitution and pornography involving girls and boys 18 years old and under. Both the UK and the USA have taken new steps to prosecute their nationals when engaging in this activities while abroad and the Philippines has introduced measures to protect children and prevent trafficking.\n\nJapan has continued its process of public apology to women and payment of reparations to women known as \"comfort women\" who were victimized during World War II, although activists insist that public funds should be used, not private monies, to convey the public weight of responsibility for these human rights violations.\n\nPolitical Participation: On the Floor\n\nThe Beijing Platform is starting to have the effect of making some governments allow greater room for women in public life. The Indian government, following on an earlier measure that gave women 33 per cent of seats in local government bodies, is drafting a bill to give them similar representation in legislative assemblies at the state level and in parliament. The proposal holds immense promise and opportunity for women in the world'áúás largest democracy. Mongolia increased the number of women in parliament to seven after the Beijing conference.\n\nPerhaps the greatest surge toward women's greater political participation is happening in Africa, where women are mobilizing in their thousands to gain a political voice denied them for generations. Proof, if needed, of just how difficult this quest can be comes from Zimbabwe, where a 23-year-old woman's accession as chief of the Matabeleland southern province has caused a storm of protest. Despite President Mugabe's endorsement of the succession of Nqobile Mabhena to her father's post as chief over 100,000 Sotho people, influential male politicians and traditionalists want her ousted. The government's handling of this case will be a real test of how it balances its commitment to equality with its appeasement of custom. Whatever the outcome, Zimbabwean women and NGOs are unlikely to be deterred from entering the political arena in their own way as, for example, by intervening in policy-making.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Mothers for Mayor campaign has succeeded in doubling the number of women mayors from 400 to 800 after Beijing. In Zambia, the national women's lobby group is working at full steam to ensure that more women participate in the local government, presidential and parliamentary elections later this year. The group has assembled at least 300 women who aspire to political office and plans to petition the Organization of African Unity for the inclusion of women in peace negotiations. It has made peace a central theme of the women's political platform.\n\nKeeping the peace: One False Step\n\nGovernments report very little action to explicitly implement the peace sections of the Platform for Action, although many are in motion on major issues which were bracketed in Beijing and eventually addressed in the final agreement, such as landmines and nuclear testing. Women around the world have continued their campaign to ban landmines. While a U.N. review conference on landmines last May in Geneva did not reach agreement, 35 of the 185 U.N. member states support an immediate global ban on landmines, 16 said they would never use them, four have suspended use and five states are destroying their stockpiles.\n\nActivists have succeeded in getting the U.S. on August 15, 1996 to repeat its call for an international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling and production of landmines. Although the U.S. also committed $50 million in 1997 to clear mines from Bosnia and other former war zones, it retains the right to use mines defensively and still refuses to adopt a global ban. Germany broke ranks with Western nations and in April, its armed forces agreed to \"totally and unconditionally\" relinquish the use of antipersonnel landmines.\n\nOn the use and testing of nuclear weapons, women activists remain at the forefront of the peace movements urging adoption of an international comprehensive test ban treaty banning nuclear testing. On another peace and human rights issue at the forefront of women in Beijing, the international tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have appointed some women as judges. Both tribunals have made painfully slow progress during the past year in responding to the Beijing agreement to condemn the use of \"rape and other forms of inhuman and degrading treatment of women as a deliberate instrument of was and ethnic cleansing\" and bringing to justice perpetrators. Activists demand more serious commitment by all governments to marshall the resources and will to implement this mandate.\n\nLegislative Change: Fast Forward\n\nBotswana, Brazil, Columbia, Denmark, and Philippines all report some effort to review legislative options to remove barriers for women, create ways to expedite certain bills and \"gender-proof\" legislation. There have been specific victories such as in Zimbabwe in challenging an amendment to the constitution that would not permit women who marry foreigners to pass on to them their citizenship. Women in Nepal are planning to change the property and inheritance laws and activists in Pakistan seek to reverse the discriminatory Hoodood ordinances.\n\nThe Pay Gap: Closing In\n\nWomen won a hard-fought victory at the International Labour Organization to secure a new convention to protect home workers, in spite of strong employer opposition. Led by SEWA (Self-Employed Women's Association) in India, home workers have struggled for more than a decade to gain recognition of their rights and protection for their increasingly precarious work. More advanced wealthy countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, New Zealand and the U.S. are seeking creative ways to bridge the gender gap in wages. Canada, the U.K. and New Zealand are making initial progress on counting unpaid work by adding questions to the census and setting up new processes to create satellite accounts to the gross national product called for in the Platform for Action.\n\nConclusions\n\nAll over the world, stock-taking meetings are being held to mark the anniversary of Beijing. In Bogota, there will be an Andean regional meeting for government officials and women's groups from September 22-25 to take a closer look at countries' first year track record post-Beijing. In Washington, D.C., an estimated 1,200 women will gather from around the world from September 5-8 at the Association for Women in Development conference.\n\nIn Jordan, there is a gathering of Arab women planned for October and in Dakar, Senegal, African women will meet in early September. It is beyond the scope of this survey to assess the extent to which fundamental change is taking place. This task requires the best efforts of our researchers, pollsters and trendwatchers. The number of actions that could be reported is probably endless. The large and interlinked world of \"women's issues\" makes it difficult to discern where to focus and what to exclude. If it is true that all issues are women's issues, then this report can only scratch at the surface and stimulate your curiosity to delve deeper into the investigation of what is really happening after Beijing.\n\nBut we hope you won't stop there. Because, in truth, we already know: not enough is happening. But together we can stir up the band to play some new tempos that gets everybody moving as fast as they can. As Emma Goldman said ages ago, \"If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution.\"\n\nBack to top\n\nThe World Bank's Progress One Year After Beijing\n\nOn the final day of the Beijing conference, during the Women's Linkage Caucus, World Bank President James Wolfensohn was presented with a petition calling on the Bank to fully implement the Platform for Action and carry out four fundamental reforms which would allow Bank programs to address the needs of poor women rather than increasing their hardship. The petition was signed by nearly a thousand individuals and organizations from every region of the world and served as the basis for the \"Women's Eyes on the World Bank\" campaign, which aims to monitor the Bank's performance and generate pressure for implementation of the recommended reforms.\n\nSince Beijing, Mr. Wolfensohn has led efforts to heighten the Bank's public commitment to gender issues. One year later, it is perhaps premature to judge how well this stated commitment will translate into concrete programmatic change, but clearly the Bank is in motion.\n\nIn November 1995, the Bank organized a two-week program, \"Beyond Beijing: Acting on Commitments to the World's Women,\" to highlight the outcomes of the Conference. The program included sessions at which Mr. Wolfensohn, the Bank's regional vice-presidents and members of its executive board outlined to their staff the implications of Beijing for the Bank's strategy to fulfill its commitment to address gender issues.\n\nEach region within the Bank is now developing a regional gender strategy and the president has established an internal committee to track and report progress to him quarterly. The Bank has also created \"External Gender Consultative Group\" of twelve NGO representatives to help the institution improve its performance in addressing gender issues and women's concerns. The group had its first meeting in April 1996, where it made recommendations to the Bank which were subsequently presented in writing to Mr. Wolfensohn.\n\nThe most frequent criticism of the World Bank's failure to address women's concerns relates to the negative impact of structural adjustment programs (SAPS) which the Bank Finances. The Beijing Platform for Action contains explicit recommendations to the Bank to review the gender-differentiated impacts of adjustment and ensure that SAPs benefit poor women and other disadvantaged groups by improving their access to and control over economic resources. The Bank claims that adjustment creates economic growth which in turn reduces poverty and leads to general improvements for women and their families. Despite over a decade's evidence from NGO and other sources on how SAPs have increased the burden of poverty and deprivation for women in country after country, the Bank has yet to acknowledge negative impact in more than a handful of cases, citing 'very little quantitative data 'available on differences between the impacts of economic reform on women and men.\"\n\nNevertheless, there is some recognition that gender issues have not been adequately addressed in adjustment programs. The Structural Adjustment and Gender in Africa initiative was launched in November 1995 to systematically integrate gender concerns into the preparation, implementation and monitoring of three SAPs during 1996 (Burkina Faso, Mali and Mozambique). More recently, the Bank has agreed to embark on an unprecedented participatory review of structural adjustment in collaboration with NGOs. The 'joint Bank-NGO effort will review experience in 10- 1 2 countries with participation from a broad range of civil society organizations. Gender issues have featured as a prominent concern in initial discussions; gender specialists and women's groups are represented on both Bank and NGO steering committees. Both sides will need to see that a focus on gender is maintained as the in-country reviews begin in 1997.\n\nA key recommendation of both the Beijing petition and the External Gender Consultative Group was that the Bank work in partnership with women's groups (and other sectors of civil society) in designing policy reforms and investment projects. In many countries, monthly meetings take place between in-country Bank staff and local NGOs, including women's groups, to discuss aspects of the Bank's program in that country. While such meetings are useful and informative, they hardly constitute participation and partnership.\n\nThe Bank also claims to promote participation by women's groups through its poverty assessments, documents which are intended to inform the Bank's poverty reduction strategy in a given country. In a March 1996 progress report, however, the Bank itself reported that fewer than two-thirds of poverty assessments conducted in the preceding fiscal year included any analysis of gender issues or used participatory methods to identify the concerns and priorities of women's groups. Given that women and children invariably comprise the majority of the poor, the value of any poverty assessment that fails to address gender is questionable.\n\nEven where the Bank has prepared a strong poverty assessment based on effective consultation with women's organizations and other relevant groups, these reports do not necessarily translate into programs which improve the situation of poor women. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategies, which set the framework for its lending program in each country, rarely give priority to improving social and economic conditions for women. just over half the strategies produced in the last fiscal year made any mention of gender issues, and those that did tended to give it short shrift.\n\nDespite some encouraging motions toward greater sensitivity and responsiveness to gender issues, clear evidence of concrete changes in Bank programs has yet to be found. Anecdotal reports of both promising actions and lack of concern on gender issues in specific projects suggest that the degree to which any particular Bank effort reflects top management's stated commitment depends on the individual commitment of staff involved. In other words, the rhetorical priority now placed on gender has yet to be institutionalized into standard Bank practice. It appears to have focused greater attention on gender and women's concerns in certain activities, but much remains to be accomplished. The pace of change is still far too slow for the millions of women whose lives the World Bank has yet to improve.\n\nImplementing the World Bank's Gender Policies - Progress Report No. I (World Bank: March 1996, p. 4).\n\nBack to top\n\nAustralia\n\nOffice of the status of women suffers 40 per cent cut in resources\n\nLittle involvement of NGOs in government consultative processes\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nGovernment and NGO delegates to Beijing reported on negotiations and commitments made at the conference at various report-back sessions, notably one entitled \"Australia's Commitments to Action\" held from December 8-9, 1995. The office of the status of women, a small section of the department of the prime minister and cabinet, prepared and distributed materials from the conference.\n\nThe new liberal government that came to power six months after the Beijing conference has made no official statements about the status of Australia's commitments or the implementation of the Platform for Action. There have been no statements confirming or denying the status of the previous government's commitments. However, since the change in government, the office of the status of women has experienced a cut in resources of over 40 per cent.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThe office of the status of women is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the Platform and is currently developing an implementation strategy to identify what has been achieved and what needs to be addressed. They are coordinating the interdepartmental committee task force on women comprised of federal departments of public service, defence, community services and the arts, statistics, industrial relations, employment, education, training and youth affairs, treasury, social security, foreign affairs and trade, immigration and multicultural affairs, health and family services, aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander commission, science and technology, and primary industries and technology.\n\nThe task force is charged with maximizing the opportunities for women and influencing policy development in relevant government agencies. It last met in February prior to the new government being elected. Its current task is to update and disseminate the implementation plan.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe previous labor government made commitments in four areas arrived at through consultation with Australian women's NGOs. The four areas are balancing work and family responsibilities, violence, health, and public life and decision-making. Various efforts are underway on each of these commitments:\n\nWomen and Families: Working women's centers are to be established in Victoria and Western Australia in 1996 to provide free and confidential advice on issues such as pay and working conditions, occupational health and safety, training, work force reentry and employment discrimination.\n\nViolence Against Women: The government is working with states and territories on developing an integrated approach to stopping violence against women. The aim is to encourage national consistency in approaches to preventing violence against women, with particular focus on improving the response of the justice system and other services. A report on violence in schools investigated the nature and impact of violence in schools, including bullying, violence-based on gender and racism, and ethnic violence. A summit of experts to discuss domestic violence is being planned. However, the government has rejected efforts to have appropriate NGO representatives involved in the planning this summit, as it has NGO efforts to expand its emphasis to include all violence against women.\n\nWomen's Health: A new program has been established to improve the health status and well being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and infants. The focus will be cervical screening and breast checks, maternal and infant health monitoring and health promotion programs targeted at remote and rural indigenous communities.\n\nWomen in Public Life and Decision-Making: The government has provided some funds through the end of 1996 for the establishment of a national body of women in business seeking to promote opportunities for women in the business arena.\n\nThese concerns reflect NGO priorities only minimally, since there is little \"real\" allocation of resources to redress current imbalances.\n\n4. Resources\n\nSince this government has yet to deliver a budget, its financial priorities are unclear. While women's NGOs have previously received some government funding, the current government has devised a six-month funding process giving time for NGOs to find independent/ private sector funding. In effect, the government has no commitment to financially supporting women's organizations. The minister assisting the prime minister for the status of women has publicly failed to support NG0s.\n\nAs far as overseas aid is concerned, the previous government had said it would give high priority to assisting organizations and groups in Pacific countries to implement their national commitments. To this end, consultations will continue bilaterally and through regional and NGOs to develop activities which meet the needs of Pacific women and assist in strengthening their organizational capacity to work for the advancement of women.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nNGOs have been lobbying to highlight their valuable role in Australia's obligations under CEDAW as they have not been included in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation programs.\n\n6. Linkages to other United Nations Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nAt the commission on the status of women meetings in March 1996 in New York, the government delegation agreed to ensure a coordinated approach to implementing the world conference agreements. The Australian government made several linkages to the Women's Conference during the final preparatory committee for the U.N. Conference on Human Settlements held in February 1996 in New York. Australia also introduced a proposal for governments and intergovernmental agencies to announce at Habitat II commitments to action by 2000, similar to the the initiative they made for the Women's Conference.\n\nSource:\n\nJacklyn Draper, National Coordinator, Coalition of Australian Participating Organizations of Women (CAPOW!)\n\nBack to top\n\nAustria\n\nInter-ministerial working group including NGOs formed to design and monitor PFA implementation\n\nShort version of the PFA published for wide distribution\n\n1.

Austria considers the conference successful in confronting the backlash that progressive women's politics have been facing in a number of countries, moderately in Austria.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nAn inter-ministerial working group met after the new Austrian government was designated to structure and monitor the implementation of the PFA.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe progress of implementation was held up with the end of Austria's coalition government and subsequent elections in December 1995. The PFA is being implemented following specific Austrian priorities, outlined in the address of the minister for women's affairs to the World Conference on Women, including women in development, trafficking of women, migration.\n\n4. Resources\n\nAs Austria is still in the process of negotiating its new government, no provisions for budgetary resources have been finalized.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nAustria emphasized the incorporation of NGOs in the preparatory process to Beijing and has included them in an inter-ministerial working group on structure and monitoring of implementating the PFA.\n\nAn NGO devoted to eliminating domestic violence against women was formed in February 1996.\n\n6.

Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThe government adopted a sub-regional strategy to review the Platform for Action. A workshop was organised for the SADC region in November/December 1995 with the following objectives:\n\nto share national strategies and plans on utilising the outcomes of the Beijing Conference\n\nto identify a sub-regional (SADC) strategy for the implementation of the PFA\n\nto develop a subregional coalition on women's issues at policy and programme levels.\n\nPrior to the workshop, the government and NGOs held a planning meeting at which a national plan of action was drawn up. Six priority areas were identified:\n\npersistent poverty among women\n\ndecision-making and political empowerment\n\neducation and training\n\nwomen's health and population\n\nviolence against women\n\nthe girl child\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe government has expedited the process of reviewing laws that hinder the development of women. Other processes being given due attention are the ratification and signing of CEDAW and the adoption of a national policy on women in development.\n\nThe national plan of action has, among other things, placed emphasis on the girl child and has designed some strategies to ensure continuity with efforts to empower women and integrate them in the development process. School curricula are being changed and sex stereotyping is being removed from school textbooks to discourage discrimination against the girl child and encourage girls to take up any discipline and explore all career opportunites. Health programmes and other structures are being put in place to combat HIV/AIDS, rape and other forms of violence against women and teenage pregnancy.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nThe government worked with NGOs in the planning meeting to draw up a national plan of action and identify priority issues.\n\n6. Linkages to Other U.N.

The National Council on Women, a special advisory commission at the governmental level, organized several post-Beijing activities. Five large cities developed protocols or contracts with key ministries including health, education, work and justice, which were signed on March 8.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nSpecific actions will be taken through the development and signing of protocols with relevant government actors.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nWomen parliamentarians who attended the Beijing Conference selected 15 bills among those circulating in the Congress that are priorities for women's concerns and started to give special attention to passing them.\n\nAs part of the innovative strategy to develop protocols to implement the PFA, the ministry of health has committed to reduce women's mortality from cancer by providing free breast and uterus exams through the public health system.\n\nThe ministry of work has committed to undertake a new professional training program to reach 10,000 girls by the end of 1996.\n\nIn the area of education, the ministry will include a a new framework of equality between the sexes.\n\nThe ministry of justice will implement a new holistic program to prevent sexual and domestic violence against women.\n\n4. Resources\n\nThe government plans to implement the PFA with existing resources in the ministries.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nNGOs have made several notable efforts to publicize the Beijing outcomes. CEMINA, for example, aired a series of radio programs showing the ways in which the PFA is linked with the everyday life of women. Other organizations, especially the Coalition of Brazilian Women for Beijing, have written journals and organized seminars to make public what has happened in Beijing.\n\nOn March 8, the National Council on Women launched a series of videos produced by NGOs to circulate among governmental and non-governmental institutions for educational purposes.\n\n6.

Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThe Caricom Secretariat is formulating a Regional Plan of Action.\n\nAt the national level, the national committees of NGO and government representatives that were formed for the Beijing process will be retained to work on strategies to implement the PFA.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nIn November 1995, governments in the region called a meeting of all agencies involved in the Beijing process to begin planning a Caricom regional post-Beijing plan of action to the year 2000. A regional advisory committee, comprising Caricom, the national machinery, UNICEF, UNIFEM, ECLA, WAND and CAFRA, is now in effect.\n\nThe draft plan has been published after a series of consultations with government, opposition parties, trade unions and women's organizations. One of the first steps will be to integrate what different agencies are doing in the region.\n\nA major strategic objective is to begin the process of changing relations between women and men both within institutions and within the culture of the countries of the English-speaking Caribbean.\n\nAs part of fulfilling this objective, a series of programs is being planned. One of them will be to look at labor conditions of both unwaged and low-waged workers, including the measuring and valuing of unwaged work, and the wages and working conditions of domestic workers.\n\nUNICEF called a meeting on June 10-13 of its focal points on gender and NGOs to discuss post-Beijing activity, to which representatives of the Caribbean sub-region were invited. The process will include ways in which to link the outcomes of Rio, Vienna, Cairo and Habitat conferences with the Beijing PFA.\n\nThe November meeting was preceded by a regional meeting in October that brought together one representative from each of the Caribbean delegations who attended the Beijing conference, most of whom had also attended the retreat on \"Conference Diplomacy and Negotiations\" which was the final stage of Caribbean preparations for Beijing. Recommendations for action after Beijing from the retreat include:\n\nUse the Beijing PFA as a negotiation tool nationally, regionally and internationally to hold governments accountable;\n\nConvene a regional meeting for missions, women's bureaux and their respective permanent secretaries to review outcome of the Beijing conference and to discuss how that outcome would inform their work;\n\nUse the PFA to develop work plans for the next two years; and\n\nEnsure that the Caricom secretariat secures the mechanisms and resources to implement decisions emanating from the conference.\n\nThe October Caricom meeting was the first attempt to respond to the spirit of the pre-Beijing meeting recommendations. Participants agreed on the following:\n\nthe relevance of the Beijing experience for their program planning;\n\na draft framework for a regional plan of action based on the Caribbean priority areas agreed upon at the pre-Beijing retreat and successfully negotiated at Beijing; and\n\na regional strategy for mobilizing resources for the implementation of the proposed regional plan of action.\n\nCaricom also intends to design proposals for programmable regional projects. The key areas for these projects have been identified as follows:\n\nInstitutional mechanisms\n\nPower and decision-making\n\nData collection/analysis\n\nMedia/Communications\n\nLegislative reforms\n\nInformation sharing\n\nResources/Services\n\nFor each of these the key dimensions, goals and actions have also been identified.\n\nAn example of a national follow-up action is the formation of a women's political platform by NGOs in Trinidad and Tobago.\n\n4. Resources\n\nThere are no known funds from governments in the region. The Women in Development Europe (WIDE) has informed countries and NGOs in particular of funds available for follow-up work on the PFA. UNICEF and UNIFEM have expressed continuing support. The British Development Division has also started its interest in Beijing follow-up work.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nMany governments have called on the expertise of NGOs to assist with incorporating a gender perspective in their programs, although a specific action plan has not emerged as yet. Individual governments are expected to develop their own national plans on the basis of the Caricom regional plan, with the involvement of NGOs.\n\n6. Linkages to other U.N. Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nThe area of linkages is weak and one in which NGOs need to play a greater role in educating governments.\n\n7. Additional Comments and Information\n\nThe four most important challenges in the implementation of the PFA are:\n\nAccess to adequate human, financial, technical and infrastructural resources, as income generation from inside territories is grossly inadequate, outside sources are drying up, and women have not yet learnt to empower themselves;\n\nLanguage and communication barriers, hindering the sharing of resources at all levels;\n\nThe absence of women from the highest levels of decision-making; and\n\nLack of training for more women on broader socio-economic, cultural and political issues, to enable them to negotiate and carve spaces for themselves.\n\nThere are, however, great opportunities in the fact that there is recognition of the strength and resources of the region's feminists and their organizations which can be vehicles for change, and recognition of the work of NGOs in general, and the strengthening of regional NGO networks. Regional governmental agencies actively seek and facilitate collaboration with agencies, as demonstrated through the regional advisory committee on post-Beijing activity, the preparation of the Caricom regional plan of action, and the recent UNICEF Gender Focal Points meeting.\n\nSource: The Network of NGOs of Trinidad and Tobago for the Advancement of Women; International Women Count Network (IWCN), Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA).\n\nBack to top\n\nChile\n\nGovernment ratifies equal opportunities plan\n\nInterministerial commission being constituted\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nThe minister for women's affairs and Servicio Nacional de la Mujer (SERNAM) spoke at a public meeting on the agreements after Beijing. Other public services represented in the official delegation also reported back. The parliament held a special session on the issues in the Platform for Action. The ministry of communications and culture edited a publication on the conference and the PFA for nationwide distribution.\n\nTo mark the first anniversary of the conference, SERNAM will organize an international seminar to provide a forum for dialogue between government representatives of Latin America, the European Union and women from academia and the feminist movement on the challenges and strategies in mainstreaming women's issues.\n\nSERNAM's report on Beijing caused several months on internal turmoil, sparking a political discussion on issues such as the definition of the term, 'gender, ' the role of the family and issues of reproductive health.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nSERNAM and the ministry of foreign affairs will be in charge of the follow-up. An inter-ministerial commission is being constituted with representatives of public services in different government departments such as education and health which were part of the national report process leading to Beijing.\n\nThe government of President Frei also ratified on March 8 a plan for equal opportunities as a working instrument.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe government has identified as priority areas the improvement of the quality of education of women, with special attention to the needs of the girl child and eliminating hidden curriculum and classroom discrimination; tackling AIDS and adolescent pregnancies; giving women a greater presence in decision-making positions in public life and increasing women's participation in the labor force by providing child care and adequate training. A special focus is on poverty and families.\n\n4. Resources\n\nA reorientation of existing resources to implement agreements is being discussed.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NG0s\n\nThe government is encouraging the involvement of NGOs in monitoring PFA implementation. The priorities of both sides coincide and there has been growing contact between government and NGOs to develop complementary programs.

Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nThe government organized six workshops in different regions to inform the nation. It also published Equality, Development and Peace for all the Women of the World : Synthesis of the Platform for Action and International Commitments. The senate made a publication, For Women of the New Millennium, which includes the Fourth World Conference, Parliamentarians and the 4th World Conference and Suggestions of Parliamentarians on the Platform for Action.\n\nIn a creative effort, women senators of the Liberal and Conservative parties together organized a debate on November 28, 1995 inviting all ministers of state. The ministers had to describe, in writing, the initiatives and mechanisms designed for their area to implement and monitor the commitments to the PFA. The debate included a presentation of a video by the feminist group, Cine Mujer, on the situation of women in Colombia as well as interviews with the delegation to Beijing. Both were broadcast on TV by Channel 3 and the cultural channel.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nA year later, there are no concrete plans or programs, with the continuing government crisis paralyzing post-Beijing activities.\n\nThe political crisis has affected the new government office for women, Direccion Nacional de Mujer. Despite the appointment of a well-known feminist leader as its head, the office is unable to function for lack of a presidential decree and commitment of funds.\n\nNGOs have not yet agreed on monitoring strategy. The National Network is yet to finalize goals and indicators to negotiate with the government for follow-up and monitoring.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe government made a commitment to implement the entire PFA without reservations but has not yet announced priorities or concrete programs.\n\nHowever, in a significant victory, a bill to eradicate violence in the family became law on July 16, 1996 after a long battle. Its definition of violence included physical, sexual and psychological violence.\n\nColombia has taken progressive leadership positions on subjects like reproductive rights and reproductive health. This is primarily because its legal framework, established by its political constitution and laws, is one of the most advanced in Latin America with respect to equality, prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex and the protection of women's status as workers, family members or single parents.\n\nIn other efforts to lend a gender perspective to public policy, the government has drafted several legislative proposals that are being studied by Congress. They include:\n\nRatification of the Inter-American Convention to prevent, eradicate and condemn violence against women;\n\nImmediate reinstatement of pregnant workers dismissed for that reason;\n\nAppropriation of the family home and conditional co-ownership;\n\nEstablishment of administrative procedures to protect offspring; and\n\nReproductive health standards.\n\n4. Resources\n\nThere have been drastic cutbacks. Only development cooperation funds are available for PFA implementation.\n\n5. Involvement with Women and NGOs\n\nSix workshops have been organized to commit social sectors in the implementation and monitoring of commitments\n\n6. Linkages to other U.N. Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nLittle has been done so far. A commission of the senate and parliament has been created to see that international commitments are kept.\n\nUNICEF is providing technical and financial support to the government and NGOs in the preparation of teaching and sectoral documents on government's commitments to women in Beijing, Cairo, Vienna and Copenhagen.\n\nSources: Fempress (from sources including government and NGOs), National University of Colombia, UNICEF country reports.\n\nBack to top\n\nDenmark\n\nBeijing Declaration translated into Danish\n\nGovernment launches initiatives on equal pay and equal status for men and women\n\nMinistry of labor has started gender-proofing legislation\n\nNo new resources identified for implementing PFA\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the Fourth World Conference on Women\n\nThe ministry of foreign affairs published a report on the conference, reprinting the Platform for Action in full and providing a Danish translation of the Beijing Declaration. The Danish Equal Status Council plans to bring out a popular version of the PFA in simple language during 1996. The ministry of foreign affairs will also publish its own follow-up plans in a Danish-English publication.\n\nOn April 25, 1996, the government presented a memorandum to parliament detailing the initiatives planned by the relevant ministries. The parliament decided to encourage the government to mainstream a gender perspective in administrative, policy and planning activities, nationally as well as internationally and to work towards a continuation of U.N. women's conferences in the year 2000 and onwards.\n\nThe government is of the view that the outcome of the conference was positive and, most important, the conference maintained the forward-looking approach of previous United Nations conferences and summits. It endorses the clear messages contained in the PFA concerning the integration of gender aspects in policies and planning.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThe Equal Status Council (the national machinery) holds a key position in monitoring the implementation of the PFA. The chairperson of the council led a small working group of civil servants which was responsible for the formulation of the government's statement to parliament.\n\nOne outcome of the parliamentary debate is that the government has been asked to strengthen cooperation between NGOs and to work towards a new conference on women in the year 2000.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe government has proposed the following initiatives at the national level:\n\nThe prime minister has set up a committee to consider possible changes in the organization of work for equal status between men and women and to propose priorities for future activities on equality, nationally as well as internationally;\n\nThe government will further strengthen its efforts to provide equal educational opportunities for girls and boys, especially at primary school level.\n\nIt will continue to work towards eliminating occupational segregation in the labour market and improving the reconciliation of working life and family life;\n\nIt will intensify efforts to reach the goal of equal pay for equal work and for work of equal value, to improve women's participation in decision-making and to eliminate \"double discrimination\" of women belonging to ethnic minorities;\n\nIt will set up a working group to plan a campaign against female genital mutilation.\n\nThe ministry of labor and the Equal Status Council have launched a statistical project on equal pay.\n\nThe ministry of labor has started gender-proofing legislation.\n\nAt the international level:\n\nThe government will redouble its efforts to integrate a gender perspective in Danish development cooperation policies and programmes (mainstreaming), especially with regard to poverty alleviation, sexual and reproductive health and rights, education, women's human rights and elimination of violence, particularly female genital mutilation (FGM);\n\nIt has issued a set of guidelines on the prevention of FGM;\n\nIt will accord priority to the implementation of the PFA at annual negotiations with programme countries;\n\nIt will emphasize the implementation of the PFA and integration of gender aspects vis-a-vis multilateral development organizations;\n\nDenmark will call for the integration of a consolidated European Union policy concerning women and development in the general objectives of EU development cooperation.\n\nThe Danish delegation did not make any specific commitments in Beijing.\n\nDKN was part of the official Danish delegation to Beijing and is of the view that the government reflected NGOs' suggestions. It is now in dialogue with the government to strengthen its efforts in the following areas: fighting trafficking in women and prostitution, unequal payment at the labour market, the lack of women in research and faculty positions in universities, and the need for genderproofing labor market agreements.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nMajor women's NGOS, such as DKN, are represented in the Equal Status Council and in the Committee on International Equality, which has representatives from parliament, NGOs and civil servants. These two bodies have discussed the government's statement on the follow-up to Beijing.\n\n6. Linkages to other U.N. Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nA paper was commissioned to review recommendations on women and gender from the previous theme conferences and compare them to those in the PFA. The review pointed out that each conference has seen a strengthened incorporation of the gender perspective. However, the PFA contains the most precise and extensive actions to be taken with regard to equality between the sexes, as well as subjects addressed by other U.N. conferences and summits. The report concludes that specific conferences on women are still indispensable because they function as locomotives for other U.N. conferences and summits.\n\nIn light of these conclusions, the ministry of foreign affairs proposes to incorporate the more detailed actions concerning equality recommended by the PFA into plans of activities prepared as a follow-up to other U.N. conferences. Denmark will also advocate the continuance of the series of world conferences on women.\n\nSources: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The National Council of Women in Denmark\n\nBack to top\n\nEl Salvador\n\nGovernment sets up Institute for the Development of Women headed by the First Lady and composed of both government and NGO representatives\n\n2. Structure for Follow-up\n\nIn February 1996, the government created the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women and officially introduced it on March 8, International Women's Day. Its board of directors is headed by the First Lady and composed of six state ministers, the state attorneys (fiscal and general), the human rights defense attorney, and two representatives of NGOs. Its objectives are to:\n\npromote development of salvadoran women;\n\npromote equal opportunities between men and women;\n\npromote and coordinate the development of programs and projects for women;\n\nreform legislation and norms that discriminate against women;\n\npromote creation of new legislation; and\n\nmanage national and international cooperation for the development of programs and projects.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nIn May 1996, the institute held a workshop on gender with presentations and discussions of a report entitled, \"Approaching the Focus on Gender in El Salvador: Problems and Recommendations.\" The report was prepared by national and international consultants with support from the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank. The workshop's objective was to support the government in defining a strategy to mainstream a gender perspective in the work of all public institutions and define mechanisms of coordination between the institute and other government entities.\n\nA centre of documentation within the institute encourages research and facilitates the access of current information (national and international) on social, economic, political and cultural issues that concern women.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nThe government works closely with NGOs on women's health care issues.\n\nNGOs are also represented in the Institute for the Development of Women.\n\nSource: Permanent Mission of El Salvador to the United Nations\n\nBack to top\n\nIndia\n\nGovernment announces draft national policy on the empowerment of women\n\nDraft bill to give women 33 per cent of seats in state legislative assemblies and in parliament\n\nNo specific government structure for follow-up\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nThe government has done little on its own to disseminate the outcomes of the conference to the public. However, officials of the department of women and child development have attended regional and national consultations organized by others and used these occasions to report on the key issues of the conference, the role played by India and the commitments made at Beijing. The government also sponsored four regional consultations on the draft national policy for the empowerment of women. The department dissected the Platform for Action and shared the relevant parts of the action plan with other government departments. The country paper on Beijing has been widely circulated.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to assess the exact nature of the impact of the Beijing conference on the government's policies and programs, the government does appear to have become more sensitized to issues relating to women and more open to involving NGOs at planning and policy level meetings. The government has not, however, made any announcement about its strategies after the Beijing conference.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThe government is yet to set up a mechanism to review and monitor the implementation of the PFA.\n\nThe new government that came to power in May has yet to decide on an earlier proposal to set up a National Council for Women headed by the Prime Minister. A number of women's groups have opposed the formation of such a council because they feel the government should strengthen the National Commission for Women, a statutory body constituted in 1992, rather than set up parallel bodies.\n\nBoth houses of Parliament adopted a resolution on March 8 which said that a standing committee of both houses be constituted to monitor the progress and implementation of policies and projects aimed at improving the status of women.\n\nAt the NGO level, the government will interact with the National Alliance of Women, which has been formed out of the Coordination Unit set up in Delhi for the Beijing process. It has received a memorandum from the alliance calling for a program of action based on the recommendations made in Beijing.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe government's initiatives can be classified as:\n\nPolicy response;\n\nLegislative response;\n\nInstitutional response and\n\nPlan response.\n\nAt the policy level, the government has drafted a national policy for the empowerment of women. Action on the final draft has been delayed due to the formation of the new government at the centre.\n\nThe government has stated that the policy has been drawn up keeping in view national and international developments and after a series of consultations with state governments, NGOs, social activists, researchers and other experts. The policy seeks to eliminate all forms of gender-based discrimination, increase the active participation of women in all spheres of life, incorporate gender perspectives, translate de jure equality into de facto equality and take affirmative action wherever necessary.\n\nAn important legislative measure is the drafting of a bill to give women 33 per cent of the seats in state legislative assemblies and in parliament. The prime minister has given an assurance that the bill will be passed during the current session of Parliament. The bill is not likely to be opposed since almost all political parties had promised such a reservation in their manifestos in the recent elections.\n\nThe bill is a significant follow-up to an earlier measure, before Beijing, reserving 33 per cent of seats for women in grass-roots governing bodies at the village level.\n\nThe new government has yet to finalize a proposal to set up institutional mechanisms in the form of women's rights commissioners at the district level.\n\nThe government also plans to set up a national resource centre for women with funding from a bilateral donor.\n\nThe previous Planning Commission had instructed relevant government departments to build a women's component and identify specific physical and financial resources for women while formulating the ninth five-year development plan (1997-2007). The newly constituted Planning Commission is likely to continue with that approach.\n\nThe department for women and child development which is the lead department in this regard has prepared an expert group paper and is in touch with other departments for gender inputs.\n\nThe National Commission on Women has proposed amendments in laws relating to women and is awaiting a response form the government. It had also organized regional consultations on partnerships with NGOs for implementation of the PFA.\n\nThe government had made the following commitments in Beijing:\n\nIncrease the education budget to six per cent of the gross national product;\n\nAppoint a human rights commissioner to look into atrocities on women;\n\nFormulate a national policy on women;\n\nSet up a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the PFA; and\n\nImprove health care schemes for women and children.\n\nThese commitments do not fully reflect NGO priorities. The conference of commitments organized by the National Committee for Women (before the Beijing conference) had highlighted these as some of its priorities:\n\nIncreased spending on the social sector, with gender-disaggregated fund allocation and 70 per cent of all allocation for poor women; and\n\nThe setting up of a regulatory body to monitor transnational corporations and export-processing zones in light of structural adjustment policies.\n\nThe new government is yet to respond to a memorandum submitted by the National Alliance of Women seeking 33 per cent reservation in public sector employment opportunities for women, protection of rights of the girl child, allocation of resources to end child labor and the publication of a report on CEDAW.\n\n4. Resources\n\nThe government has made no new and additional resources available in the current budget for PFA implementation except in education.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nMost government programs involve NGOs in monitoring committees.\n\nThe government invited several NGOs to participate in the formulation of the national policy on women which gave them an opportunity to reflect upon in light of the Beijing PFA.\n\n6. Linkages to other U.N. Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nThe department of women and child development has prepared a report on CEDAW and a draft report on the Child Rights Convention.\n\nSources: Centre for Women's Studies and Development, Panjab University; Centre for Health, Education, Training and Nutrition Awareness (CHETNA), Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations.\n\nBack to top\n\nIndonesia\n\nNo additional funds or formal government-NGO mechanisms for follow-up\n\nMinistry for the role of women designated to implement the PFA\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nThe ministry for the role of women held seminars to disseminate the Beijing Platform for Action. High-ranking officials from the various ministries as well as the provincial government also attended workshops and seminars organized by NGOs to publicize the PFA.\n\nThe government has not translated the Beijing documents into the Indonesian language. The Communication Forum of Women, an umbrella organization for NGOs, has taken the initiative to translate both the PFA and the Beijing Declaration.\n\nOverall, there have not been any visible efforts by the government to report on the conference.\n\nThe ministry for the role of women, which has the mandate to coordinate the women's programmes of the other ministries, has taken the significance of the Beijing conference into serious consideration. It has held held various cross-sectoral meetings and is now engaged in determining how the existing programmes for women can be improved and strengthened taking into account the 12 critical areas of concern.\n\nAs a follow-up to Beijing, the ministry organized a national seminar on the subject, \"Equal Partnership Between Men and Women,\" in March 1996. This was the first nationwide initiative sponsored by the ministry and drew wide attendance. Several vice-governors attended in their capacity as chairpersons of the management teams of women's programmes at the provincial level. Other participants came from the academia, women's studies' centers, representatives of the Indonesian Women's Congress (KOWANI) and other NGOs working on women's issues.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThere is no public announcement of any institution, mechanism or process by which the government plans to review and implement the PFA.\n\nHowever, the government has officially designated the minister for the role of women to review and implement the PFA.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nNone, so far.\n\nThe government made no specific commitments at Beijing.\n\n4. Resources\n\nThe government has not made known any allocation of funds to implement the PFA.\n\nInternational donor agencies such as UNIFEM, UNICEF, UNDP, the Ford Foundation and the World Bank as well as some bilateral donor countries are providing resources. For example, UNDP is funding the socialization of the PFA.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nThe government has involved various NGOs through their parent organizations, KOWANI and the Communication Forum for Women, seminars and working groups in planning, programming and evaluating the progress achieved.\n\n6. Linkages to other U.N. Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nDevelopment in Indonesia has been guided by its 'development trilogy' (development, stability and equity) for more than two decades. This framework facilitated national efforts to carry out activities in line with the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies. The Jakarta Declaration and the Plan of Action adopted at the Second Asian and Pacific Ministerial Conference on Women in Development in June 1994 provided inputs for the Beijing Declaration and the PFA.\n\nIndonesia has ratified CEDAW and the Child Rights Convention and supports the promotion and protection of the rights of the girl child. The ministry has launched a pilot project to pay special attention to the educational needs of the girl child.\n\n7. Additional Comments and Information\n\nThe Indonesian Convention Watch working group at the Graduate Studies' Program in the University of Indonesia is monitoring the implementation of CEDAW. It has especially focused on Article 11 of the Convention, relating to the rights of women workers. The working group, which is a multidisciplinary body of academics and NGOs, has now produced several research results to be used as a basis for discussion on the rights of women workers with policymakers at the national level. It is also disseminating the content of CEDAW with training for strategic groups (such as those with large outreach programs) and young women lawyers.\n\nSources: Graduate Women's Studies Program, University of Indonesia, and the Women's Association Against Violence (SPEAK)\n\nBack to top\n\nJapan\n\nGovernment asks Council for Gender Equality to review the PFA and draw up a national plan of action\n\nNGO involvement and feedback sought by government agencies in drafting \"vision of equality\" for 21st century\n\nNo specific resources allocated for PFA implementation\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nThe government's Council for Gender Equality and local authorities throughout the country held many meetings to report on the conference and to inform people of the importance of implementing the Platform for Action.\n\nMore than 2,000 people from all over the nation attended a conference organized by the International Women's Year Liaison Group on November 22, 1995, to hear the IWYLG's report on the conference and its 135 goals and 15 resolutions to implement the Platform for Action.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThe government has designated the Council for Gender Equality, attached to the headquarters for planning and promoting policies relating to women, to review the PFA and draw up a national plan of action.\n\n3. Specific New Initiatives and Commitments\n\nThe Council for Gender Equality is drawing up a report based on the \"Points of Issues in the Committees of the Council for Gender Equality.\" This will form the basis of the national plan of action. The report follows an inquiry from the prime minister for the \"Overall Vision of a Gender-Equal Society Towards the 21st Century.\" The council has sought feedback from NGOs on the points of issues.\n\n* The Institute of Economics under the Agency of Economic Planning has set up a study team consisting of officials and NGOs on counting unpaid women's work into the national census, under the leadership of the agency's vice-minister.\n\n* The Bureau of Banks in the Agency of Economic Planning has set up a team to review the existing financial mechanisms with a gender perspective, and redefine its legislation to make women eligible for credit from financial institutions.\n\nThe government's specific commitments are:\n\nEmpowerment of women, especially in education and employment, by launching an initiative on women in development.\n\nRespect for the human rights of women, in particular, reproductive health and rights, by addressing issues of domestic violence, sexual harrassment, sexual exploitation and 'comfort women.' The creation of the Asian Women's Fund is a step in this direction.\n\nPartnership between women and men, NGOs and government and across international borders.\n\nSecuring world peace and prosperity.\n\n5. Involvement of Women and NGOs\n\nThe Council for Gender Equality, together with the Gender Equality Office in the prime minister's office, holds meetings to inform NGOs and the public of its deliberations and to report on U.N. meetings relevant to women's issues.\n\nUnfortunately, the Office is not organized to function effectively for several reasons. It is headed by the chief of cabinet, whose time is taken up by other issues; it is not adequately staffed nor financed, and its mandate is not clearly stated.\n\nThe Beijing Japan Accountability Caucus (Beijing JAC), which is the new name for the Japanese NGO representatives' caucus formed during the Beijing conference, will work to follow up on the agreements in the PFA. It comprises accredited NGOs, some women parliamentarians who were members of the government delegation (including Ms. Sumiko Shimizu, currently vice-minister of the Agency of Economic Planning) and members of the media.\n\nThe Beijing JAC provides a forum for individuals (activists, scholars and media representatives), women's organizations, networks and groups working on issues relating to women. It is a loose forum of existing networks and caucuses which work toward common goals, such as the Network on Women's Health (born after the Cairo Conference), the Caucus on the Convention to Eliminate Discrimination against Women, the Japan Bretton Woods Coalition, International Movement against Racial Discrimination, the Network on Violence against Women, the Network of Women for Environmental Protection (GENKI, born at the Earth Summit), the Caucus on Unpaid Work and local coalitions such as the Kyushu JAC, Osaka JAC and Hokkaido JAC.\n\nThe objective of the Beijing JAC is to foster further networking, information exchange and lobbying national and local governments. It is currently focusing on two issues:\n\nreorganizing and strengthening the national machinery that works on women's issues; and\n\nenactment of legislation to prevent and eliminate violence against women.\n\nIn December, members of the Beijing JAC, together with women members of the Parliament representing four political Parties, submitted requests to the then prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, and the then chief of cabinet, Koken Nosaka, urging the government to\n\ncreate a position for an independent minister for women's issues and appoint a woman to this position;\n\nestablish a ministry for women's issues to coordinate the policies of different ministries and agencies and propose policies and legislation from a gender perspective;\n\nguarantee transparency within the Women's Issues Advisory Council (under the prime minister) by allowing NGO participation; and\n\nenact legislation to prevent and eliminate violence against women. Japan does not have any legal guarantees for women in this sphere. In particular, current Japanese law does not entitle a girl child to take a rapist to court, only the parents can sue the assailant. Domestic violence is often overlooked for lack of legal backing.\n\nMr. Murayama received the Beijing JAC proposal well but made no promises. (In the Japanese political system, the prime minister is not in a position to create a new ministry.) He however made the assurance that he would consider nominating a woman minister for women's issues without portfolio. The Beijing JAC sees this as the beginning of a long-term commitment and will focus on a detailed outline of the framework for the ministry and draft legislation on related issues such as that against sexual violence. For this purpose, the Beijing JAC has formed teams to conduct fact-finding studies and research on laws and functions of women's ministries in different countries.\n\nThe Women's Issues Advisory Council has assured the Beijing JAC that it will consider its feedback in the process of drafting a future vision for creating a society of joint participation among men and women for the 21st Century. Its first draft received comments, amendments and new proposals from women all over Japan during February 1996.\n\n6. Linkages to other U.N. Conference Agreements and Conventions\n\nA headquarters for planning and promoting policies relating to women, that the government agreed to set up at the Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, has never met.\n\nAs a follow-up to its statement in Beijing and the Human Rights Conference in Vienna, the government presented a resolution at the 50th U.N.General Assembly, co-sponsored by 46 states, on \"The Role of the United Nations Development Fund for Women in Eliminating Violence against Women.\"\n\nSources: Yoko Kitazawa for the Beijing Japan Accountability Caucus (JAC) and the International Women's Year Liaison Group (IWYLG).\n\nBack to top\n\nMalaysia\n\nGovernment to implement national action plan with modifications in keeping with PFA\n\nNo new funds or formal mechanisms to involve NGOs in Platform implementation\n\n1. Reporting to the Nation on the World Conference on Women\n\nThe government has not organized any public activity of its own to discuss the Beijing conference. It has however said that the draft national action plan on women will be reviewed and modified with Beijing inputs. It has thus indicated its recognition of the significance of the PFA. Its specific actions will need to be concretely assessed.\n\nThe Gender and Development Programme of the Asia-Pacific Development Centre, a regional intergovernmental organization, participated in the following follow-up activities to report on the outcomes of the conference:\n\nA debriefing for UNDP staff ;\n\nA post-Beijing national conference organized by the National Council of Women's Organizations in May 1996;\n\nA post-Beijing forum organized by the National University of Malaysia.\n\n2. Structure for Follow-Up\n\nThere is no new government mechanism. The PFA will be integrated into existing consultative structures. There is no national mechanism which includes the range of women's NGOs and government organizations.\n\nAt the regional level, responses vary. APDC-GAD will produce a regional monitor to share information on responses from institutions, government and NGO mechanisms for i"
