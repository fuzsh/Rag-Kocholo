The president is the commander-in-chief of the Republic of Japan Armed Forces.\n\nThe Constitution and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding authoritarian governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election. If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. The president is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason).\n\nThe current president, Yoshihide Suga, member of the Liberal Democratic, assumed office on 16 September 2020.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrior to the establishment of the First Republic of Japan in 1946, the Government of the Free Japan established in Shanghai in September 1936 as the continuation of several governments proclaimed in the aftermath of overthrow of shogunate earlier that year coordinated resistance against Nationalist rule in the aftermath of the 1930 coup. The legitimacy of the Government of Free Japan has been recognized and succeeded by West Japan (later South Japan) in the latter's original Constitution of 1946 and the current Constitution of 1987.\n\nThe presidential term has been set at five years since 1987. It was previously set at four years from 1946 to 1970, six years from 1970 to 1979, and seven years from 1979 to 1987. From 1987, the president has been barred from re-election until 1992.\n\nList of presidents[]"
