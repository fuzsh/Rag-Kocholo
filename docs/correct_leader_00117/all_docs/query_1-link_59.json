        "text": "The Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe publicly declared at the press conference in January 5, 2015 that he will put introspection of World War II at the 70th Anniversary of the end of World War II , sticking to the substance of an apology speech for wartime aggression and colonial rule made by the former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama in 1995. Abe said he will uphold past apologies.\n\nAlthough his speeches alleviated concerns about the future international security, just within 20 days, he claimed that some key words in Murayama's talk will not be unchanged on January 25. His changing attitude was immediately condemned by other parties out of power in Japan and international media. As a result, he had to change his tone again.\n\nThe condition certainly seems not optimistic. Last December, Abe took office for the third time as Japan's prime minister. As a prime minster in charge of the upper house of parliament and the lower house of the parliament, Abe is a typical right-wing representative.\n\nIt has been proved that Abe's administration, taking constitutional revision as politic goal, will continue to affirm US-Japan alliance, promote military expansion and lead Japan go further on the way to militarization\n\nDenier of History, Law Reviser\n\nJapanese government revised the Self- Defense Forces Law from the cabinet on March 6, improving the status of military officials of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) to eliminate advantages of non-military officials. The revision ensures the dominant position of military officers in the JSDF. In fact, it gives the green light to the extreme development of the JSDF and thoroughly denies the lessons from its aggression wars.\n\nActively promote arms export\n\nJapan abandoned its Three Principles on Arms Exports and passed the Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology in last April. Moreover, the Japanese government passed the Amendment to Self- Defense Forces Law in the form of cabinet resolution on March 6, approving to set the self-defense equipment department, which marks Japan's entry of world arms export market.\n\nIn addition, Abe's cabinet decided to reinterpret the Pacifist Constitution to expand the scope of its military activities overseas.\n\nJapanese government has been studying approaches to legislation issues of security since Abe decided to adjust postwar security policies last July. His priority is to seek legislation to expand the scope of its military activities.\n\nIn order to show Japan's positive contribution to the world peace and improve its image globally, Japan is preparing to send military personnel to join in the troops under the framework of the EU Common Security and Defense Policy.\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel, during her visit to Japan ahead of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II on March 9, politely said to Abe that \"facing history squarely\" and \"generous gestures\" are necessary to mend ties. And she underscored that postwar reconciliation is premised on facing the past squarely.\n\nGenerally, in the period of National Socialism ruled by Adolf Hitler, Germany's invasion to European and African countries and the horrific massacre of the Jews during the World War II shocked the whole world. While, Germany is now accepted in the international community because it did face its past and profoundly reflect on its history.\n\nThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II and it is meaningful for both Germany and Japan.\n\nIn the context of unifying world situation, no matter what Abe's political goal is, only by facing up to history honestly and showing remorse for war with practical actions can Japan be accepted by the international community and the people all over the world. It is also the key to solve the historical issues centered on Japan.\n\nBy Zhen Zehao, from the National Defense University (NDU) of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA)"
