        "text": "Dragon TV: It was reported that the mutual visa exemption agreement between China and Thailand came into force last Friday. Data shows that the number of travel orders by Thai tourists to China on March 1 increased by three times than that of last year and by over 160 percent than that of 2019. As more and more foreign tourists travel to China, what will China do to facilitate their trips?\n\nMao Ning: As China rolls out the visa-free policy for an increasingly larger number of countries, the number of foreign tourists to China has increased significantly. During the Spring Festival holiday, the number of inbound travelers reached 3.23 million. In particular, we have seen an obvious surge of travel orders from newly-added countries that enjoy the visa-free policy such as France, Germany, Malaysia and Singapore, with the total number doubling that of the same period in 2019.â\n\nThe Foreign Ministry has rolled out six new measures to facilitate cross-border travel, including shortening visa application forms, lowering visa fees for the entire year, streamlining approval procedures for foreign students, exempting certain applicants from fingerprinting, providing walk-in without appointment visa application service and extending unilateral visa-free policy to France, Germany and some other countries on a trial basis. To address the difficulties foreigners face in mobile payment, the Peopleâs Bank of China has instructed payment institutions to improve the efficiency of linking mobile payment accounts with foreign bank cards, streamline identity authentication procedures and lift single mobile payment cap. In Beijing, facilities in CBDs, scenic spots, parks and hotels are being upgraded to enable the handling of foreign bank cards, and demonstration zones of payment service for overseas visitors were set up at Beijing Capital International Airport and Beijing Daxing International Airport. In Shanghai, POS machines that can handle foreign bank cards were installed in places such as hotels and scenic spots. Chinaâs leading telecom operators opened new shops at the airports of major cities to help foreigners get a mobile number easier upon arrival.\n\nWe welcome more foreign friends to China and will continue working to provide a safe, enjoyable and convenient traveling environment for them.\n\nAFP: The second session of the 14th National Peopleâs Congress (NPC) is soon to be held in Beijing. The NPC spokesperson said that there will be no press conference by the Premier after the conclusion of the session and if there are no special circumstances, the Premierâs press conference will not be held in the following sessions of the 14th NPC in the next few years. The press conference by the Premier provides a rare opportunity for us foreign journalists. Whatâs the reason behind canceling the press conference by the Premier? Arenât you worried that this decision reflects Chinaâs attitude of turning inward from the rest of the world?ââ\n\nMao Ning: On the schedule of the press conferences held during the second session of the 14th NPC, the NPC spokesperson offered relevant information this morning. I have no additional information to share. Thank you for taking an interest in Chinaâs policiesâand hopingâto learn about them, but your worry is unnecessary. During the two sessions, the plenary sessions of the NPC are open to Chinese and foreign friends from the press. Premier Li Qiang will deliver the report on the work of the government on behalf of the State Council at the opening of the second session of the 14th NPC. In addition to the press conference of the NPC today, the second session of the 14th NPC will hold various events, including press conferences, the deputiesâ and ministersâ press briefings, and delegation meetings open to the press, to fully release information. The press center of the two sessions will provide news services to Chinese and foreign friends from the press in an open and transparent way.ââ\n\nReuters: I would also like to ask about âliang huiâ and whether you can confirm if the Foreign Minister will hold his usual press conference this year.\n\nMao Ning: Please stay tuned.\n\nShenzhen TV: US Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Suzanne P. Clark recently led a delegation to Beijing. She stressed many times in her speeches that China is a market greatly valued by US companies and that the Chamber is willing to continue to support US companies in doing business in China and to deepen US-China commercial ties and mutually beneficial cooperation. Whatâs your comment?\n\nMao Ning: We noticed that for some time, foreign companies from the US and other countries have been bullish about the development opportunities of the Chinese market and scaled up their investment in China. Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce show that Chinaâs actual utilized FDI exceeded RMB 1.1 trillion in 2023, remaining at the forefront in the world, and 4,588 foreign-funded companies were established in China this January with a year-on-year increase of 74.4 percent. Actual utilized FDI in high-tech manufacturing jumped by 40.6 percent and more and more multinational companies have chosen to establish R&D centers in China. Foreign businessesâ investment structure in China is improving. The investments of some advanced economies in China grew at a relatively faster speed. France and Sweden witnessed 25 and 11 times of growth of their investments in China. Germany, Australia and Singapore had an increase of 211.8 percent, 186.1 percent and 77.1 percent in their actual investment in China.\n\nChina, committed to high-standard opening-up, will continue to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment, and provide more support and convenience to foreign companies investing and doing business in China. We welcome the business sectors from the US and other countries to continue advancing cooperation with China and sharing the opportunities and benefits brought by Chinaâs development.\n\nAFP: In an interview with AFP this morning, the Philippine Foreign Secretary called on China to stop harassing Philippine ships in the South China Sea. What is the Foreign Ministryâs comment on this?\n\nMao Ning: Chinaâs position on the issue of the South China Sea is consistent and clear. The reason behind the recent situation at sea is that the Philippines has frequently made provocative moves in the South China Sea, infringing on Chinaâs territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. China has taken necessary measures in accordance with the law to defend its own sovereignty, rights and interests. There is no such situation of China âharassingâ the Philippines.\n\nRIA Novosti: On March 1, Russia Today editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said that she had a recording showing that senior officers from Germanyâs armed forces, the Bundeswehr, discussed a strike on the Crimean Bridge. She said that German officers also mentioned American and British servicemen in the recording, with a side discussion of the fact that they were already directly involved in the conflict. What is Chinaâs comment?â\n\nMao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We hope that all parties will work for a political settlement of the crisis and work together to alleviate the situation.\n\nTASS: The day before yesterday, Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui held talks with Russiaâs Deputy Foreign Minister Galuzin Mikhail Yuryevich in Moscow, during which they had in-depth exchanges of views on China-Russia relations and the Ukraine crisis. How does the Foreign Ministry comment on the outcome of the meeting?\n\nMao Ning: Russia is the first stop of Special Representative Li Huiâs trip in this round of shuttle diplomacy. China has put out a readout which you may refer to. In the coming days, we will release relevant information in due course. Please check back for updates.\n\nThe Paper: Former Prime Minister of Japan Murayama Tomiichi turned 100 on March 3. In a recent statement, he expressed the hope that Japan will always remain a peaceful country. What is the Foreign Ministryâs comment on this?\n\nMao Ning: March 3, 2024 marks the 100th birthday of Japanâs former Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi. We would like to send our best wishes to Mr. Murayama.\n\nMr. Murayama is an old friend of the Chinese people and has been committed to China-Japan friendship over the years. In May 1995, then Prime Minister Murayama visited Lugou Bridge and the Museum of the War of Chinese Peopleâs Resistance Against Japanese Aggression during his visit to China, and wrote down the words âface up to history and pray for friendship and ever-lasting peace between Japan and China.â On August 15 of the same year, which marked the 50th anniversary of Japanâs announcement of unconditional surrender, then Prime Minister Murayama issued a statement on the historical issues, making a profound reflection on Japanâs colonial rule and aggression and expressing apologies to the victim countries of the war.\n\nThe âMurayama Statementâ represents a solemn statement and commitment by the Japanese government to the people of victim countries in Asia with regard to the historical period of its aggression and colonial rule. It needs to be honored with good faith. We hope Japan will face up to and reflect on its history of aggression, keep to the path of peaceful development, and work with China in the same direction to build a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the demands of the new era.\n\nAssociated Press of Pakistan: On March 3, Shehbaz Sharif, President of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz was elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the next five years. How do you view the relations between Pakistan and China during his tenure?\n\nMao Ning: China warmly congratulates Shahbaz Sharif on being elected as Pakistanâs Prime Minister. On March 3, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang sent congratulatory messages to Prime Minister Shahbaz.\n\nChina highly appreciates Prime Minister Shahbazâs positive statements on China-Pakistan relations and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). We stand ready to work with Pakistan to carry forward our traditional friendship, advance exchanges and cooperation across the board, upgrade the CPEC, deepen China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, build an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, and bring more benefits to the two peoples. I believe that under the leadership of the new government led by Prime Minister Shahbaz and through the joint effort of all sectors in Pakistan, Pakistan will make new and greater achievements in national development and progress.\n\nCCTV: Itâs reported that US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview that todayâs cars are like iPhones on wheels collecting huge amount of information. She also said that imagine there are three million Chinese-made cars on US roads and they can be simultaneously disabled by Beijing. Whatâs your comment?\n\nMao Ning: Such remarks are not only false narratives but also a typical move of politicizing economic and trade issues and overstretching the concept of security. By this logic, should China be more worried about Washington sending Chinese usersâ information to the US via hundreds of millions of iPhones, or even disabling them simultaneously?\n\nCCTV: It was reported that US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns recently said in an interview with a US media outlet that China is the USâ most significant competitor; ultimately, China wants to overtake the US as the dominant country globally, and the US doesnât want that to happen; the US doesnât want to live in a world where China is the dominant country. What is your comment?\n\nMao Ning: The remarks by the US side are neither fact-based nor constructive. China firmly rejects these remarks.\n\nWe oppose defining the China-US relations with competition. China does not engage in major-country competition, and has no intention to replace or challenge any country. We have advanced the China-US relations under the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping. We hope the US will work in the same direction with China and have a right perception of China.\n\nChina always believes that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, are equal members of the international community. China will not dominate the world and we do not think the world should be dominated by any country. Neither does China have the intention to overtake the US. What we do is aimed at self-improvement so as to deliver a better life for our people. China will, as always, firmly safeguard the international system with the UN at its core and the international order based on international law, uphold world peace, promote common development, build a community with a shared future for mankind and act as a force for world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order."
