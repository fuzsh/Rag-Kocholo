        "text": "Founded in 1881Classic Yet Innovative Mixing History and Tradition with Modern Ways of Thinking\n\nMeiji University was originally established as Meiji Law School by three young lawyers in 1881, in the early years of modern Japan. Since that time, Meiji has continued for over 140 years as one of Japanâs leading private universities. But Meiji University has not remained rooted in tradition. It is an institution that has always moved forward and anticipated future developments.\n\nBased on the principle of âEmpowering the Individual,â Meiji University aims to constantly lead the world by tackling new challenges and moving toward a new era.\n\nThe 3 FoundersAims of Three Young Lawyers -Tatsuo Kishimoto, Kozo Miyagi and Misao Yashiro\n\nThe predecessor of Meiji University was Meiji Law School, which was founded in 1881 by three lawyers in their late 20s. All three were members of provincial feudal clans. Amid the upheaval and reformation that occurred when the Edo period (1603â1867) came to an end in Japan, they moved to Tokyo at the direction of the newly formed Meiji government, having been selected among their clans as scholarship students. In Tokyo, they studied French law. Upon the opening of the law school, the founders divided their responsibilities, with Kishimoto taking charge of French commercial law, Miyagi Japanese criminal law and Yashiro civil procedure law.\n\nThe three men shared a passion for respecting the rights of the individual toward creating a free society and in wanting to promote the development of intelligent young people to lead a modern civil society. These are the origins of Meiji Universityâs founding spirit of Rights and Liberty as well as Independence and Self-Government.\n\nMuseum Established in 1929A symbol of the universityâs openness to society, attracting 110,000 visitors annually\n\nWith a history dating back to 1929, the Meiji University Museum has some 450,000 items in its collection. Some of these items are on display in the permanent exhibition room, which is comprised of three departments: Criminal Materials, Commodities, and Archeology. The special exhibition room hosts a variety of exhibitions showcasing the results of research and education at Meiji University. The Meiji University Museum has been open to the general public free of charge since the 1950s, well ahead of most other university museums in Japan. Attracting around 110,000 visitors annually, the museum is a symbol of Meiji Universityâs openness to society. Adjacent to the museum is an exhibition hall chronicling the history of Meiji University and the AKU YOU Memorial Museum, dedicated to the renowned lyric writer and novelist You Aku, an alumnus of Meiji University.\n\nDesirability Ranking: 1stJapanâs Most Popular University\n\nWith Japanâs declining birthrate, the number of people aged 18 years is now just 1.10 million. But for 14 years in a row, the number of applicants to Meiji University has exceeded 100,000.\n\n* Meiji was selected as the university in the Kanto area (Tokyo region) to which the most humanities and social sciences students wished to apply, according to Shingaku Burando Ryoku Chosa 2023 (â2023 Survey of University Brand Power for New Entrantsâ), produced by Recruit Marketing Partners.\n\nFrom Tokyo Station: 5 MinutesIn the Heart of Tokyo\n\nTokyo is an international megalopolis that boasts a population of 14 million people and is the political, economic, commercial, academic and cultural center of Japan. With its vast accumulation of goods and information, Tokyo is a city of constant, dynamic change. But it is also where culture and tradition live on from the pre-modern days when it was known as Edo. As such, Tokyo has all the excitement of a colossal theme park. And Meiji University is located in the heart of Tokyo.\n\nFrom Tokyo Station to Ochanomizu Station (the closest station to Meijiâs Surugadai Campus), it takes just 5 minutes by train. The campus is a 3-minute walk from Ochanomizu Station. Akihabaraâthe mecca of Japanese pop culture, with many stores specializing in electronic goodsâis a 15-minute walk. The other three campuses have direct train connections with Shinjuku (one of Tokyoâs major centers) and traveling times of 4 to 30 minutes. Meiji University thus offers outstandingly good access within the city.\n\nStudents: 34,000A Diverse Student Body\n\nThere are 34,000 students at Meiji University. Though Meiji is certainly a large university, a particular merit of its educational system is the emphasis on small classes. And it is a place that attracts students not only from the Tokyo metropolitan area, but from all of Japanâs prefectures and around the world.\n\nInternational Students Annually: 2,300+Global Campus: Sense of Japan; Sense of the World\n\nMeiji University has focused on promoting campus internationalization, and it accepts many international students every year. There are exchange students from around 60 countries, and Meiji actively accepts such students through entrance examinations, student exchange programs (interuniversity and interfaculty) and short-term programs The places with the largest numbers of regular international students (international students enrolled toward obtaining a degree) are China (53%), South Korea (26%), and Malaysia, Taiwan and the United States.\n\nGraduates: 590,000Meiji Graduates Around the World\n\nSince 1882, when the first students graduated from Meiji Law School, the Meiji network has spread throughout Japan and the world. Meiji University alumni have made an impact on society in such varied areas as politics, business, culture, entertainment, sports and the mass media.\n\nExamples include Japan's first three female lawyers, Masako Nakata, Yoshiko Mibuchi and Ai Kume. Another alumnus was Tatsuji Fuse, a human rights lawyer who dedicated his life to advancing the cause of societyâs most vulnerable in the early part of the twentieth century and received the Order of Merit for National Foundation from South Korea. In the world of music, You Aku wrote a huge number of best-selling songs, and Masao Koga, recipient of the Peopleâs Honor Award of Japan, composed many popular songs for such artists as Hibari Misora. Naomi Uemura was the first person in the world to scale the highest peaks on five continents.\n\nThe great diversity in the network of Meiji University graduates is a strong feature of this institution.\n\nGraduation ceremony\n\nDegrees in English: 9Gaining Degrees Completely in English\n\nAt Meiji University, there are nine degree programs in which students can obtain a degree using only English. In all, over 870 classes (excluding language classes) are held in English. Meiji University is making great efforts to enhance that number and quality.\n\nDegree Programs in English\n\nãBachelorâsã\n\nâ School of Global Japanese Studies (since 2011)\n\nãMasterâsã\n\nâ Graduate School of Science and Technology; Architecture and Urbanism Program; International Program in Architecture and Urban Design (since 2013)\n\nâ Graduate School of Business Administration; Double Masterâs Program with University of Technology Malaysia (since 2013)\n\nãMasterâs (professional)ã\n\nâ Graduate School of Governance Studies (since 2013)\n\nâ Graduate School of Global Business (since 2020)\n\nãDoctorateã\n\nâ Graduate School of Advanced Mathematical Sciences; Mathematical Sciences Program (since 2011)\n\nâ Graduate School of Global Governance (since 2014)\n\nâ Graduate School of Science and Technology; Architecture and Urbanism Program; International Program in Architecture and Urban Design (since 2017)\n\nâ Graduate School of Advanced Mathematical Sciences; Frontier Media Science Program (since 2017)\n\nPrime Minister Graduates: 2Two Japanese Prime Ministers\n\nTwo prime ministers of Japan were graduates of Meiji University: Takeo Miki (66th prime minister) and Tomiichi Murayama (81st prime minister).\n\nOverseas Offices: 3Strengthening Relationships with ASEAN Countries\n\nMeiji University operates three overseas offices: Meiji University ASEAN Center, established in 2013 in Srinakharinwirot University, Bangkok, Thailand; Meiji University Beijing Office, established in 2011 in Chaoyang District, Beijing, China; and Malaysia Satellite Office, established in 2007 in the University of Technology Malaysia.\n\nThe university has established partnerships with 15 academic institutions in ASEAN nations, with a focus on Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV). Meiji has held various exchange programs, such as the Innovative Faculty Development Workshop and CLMV Student Conference, using the ASEAN Center as a hub.\n\nTeaching Staff from Overseas or with Overseas Degrees: 20%Globalized Teaching Staff\n\nMeiji employs approximately 1,000 full-time faculty members. Among full-time teaching staff at the university, approximately 20% are from overseas or hold degrees from universities abroad.\n\nIn order to expand English-medium degree programs and other classes taught in English, Meiji is proactively recruiting non-Japanese nationals and individuals with degrees from institutions outside Japan to teach classes in languages other than Japanese.\n\nCampuses: 4Urban University\n\nMeiji is an urban university in the heart of Tokyo, and it has four campuses: Surugadai, Izumi, Ikuta, and Nakano. Izumi Campus is for freshmen and sophomores studying humanities (except students in the School of Global Japanese Studies). Surugadai Campus is for junior and senior year students. Ikuta Campus caters to science students (School of Science and Technology, School of Agriculture). Nakano Campus is for students in the School of Global Japanese Studies and School of Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences.\n\n10 Undergraduate Schools, 16 Graduate SchoolsUndergraduate and Graduate Schools for Those Wanting to Learn\n\nMeiji University is a comprehensive multidisciplinary institution with 10 undergraduate and 16 graduate schools. The universityâs knowledge community covers a broad variety of academic fields and delivers learning programs that satisfy all forms of intellectual curiosity. It provides an environment that offers students the opportunity to acquire a wide-ranging, multidisciplinary perspective.\n\nSchool of\n\nLaw / Commerce / Political Science and Economics / Arts and Letters / Science and Technology / Agriculture / Business Administration / Information and Communication / Global Japanese Studies / Interdisciplinary Mathematical Sciences\n\nOlympic and Paralympic Athletes: 290+, Medals Won: 46Meiji Dominates in Sports\n\nSince the formation of five sports clubs in 1905, the Meiji University Athletic Association, which now numbers 46 clubs, has been a leading force in the world of university sports and has played a significant role in their development. That trend is certainly evident with the Olympics and Paralympics. Beginning with the 1920 Olympic Games (VII Olympiad), held in Antwerp, Belgium, over 290 Meiji alumni have participated in the summer and winter games and earned 46 medals (17 gold, 13 silver and 16 bronze). At the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, gold medals were won in table tennis mixed doubles by Jun Mizutani (who graduated from the School of Political Science and Economics in 2013), and in baseball by Masato Morishita (who graduated from the School of Political Science and Economics in 2020). Jun Mizutani and Koki Niwa (who graduated from the School of Political Science and Economics in 2017) were also part of the menâs table tennis team that brought home the bronze medal. Wakaba Higuchi also claimed bronze with the womenâs figure skating team at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. Meiji has also produced many professional athletes in such sports as baseball and soccer.\n\nPartner Agreements with 57 Countries and 366 Universities and InstitutionsGlobal Network\n\nMeijiâs first partner agreement began in 1986 with York University (Canada). For the purposes of joint research and student exchange, Meiji University has since greatly expanded its number of partner universities. Partner universities do not act only as study abroad destinations for Meiji students--they also send their own students to study at Meiji, and every year around 400 exchange students enroll in Meijiâs undergraduate and graduate schools.\n\nAccommodation for exchange students is provided in the form of dormitories. Examples here are Meiji University Global Village (which also houses Japanese students) and Izumi International House (which has Japanese-style rooms, allowing exchange students to experience Japanese culture).\n\nWorld-Class Research Centers: 14Advancing World-Class Research\n\nTo promote international-standard research, Meiji Universityâs Organization for the Strategic Coordination of Research and Intellectual Properties has defined priority areas and established 14 research centers. Joint research is promoted with universities and research institutes overseas. One of the 14 research centers is the Meiji University International Institute for Bio-Resource Research (MUIIBR), headed by Professor Hiroshi Nagashima of the School of Agriculture.
