        "text": "Murayama Tomiichi (born March 23, 1924, Ōita, Japan) was a politician who in 1994–96 was the first Socialist prime minister of Japan since 1948.\n\nOne of 11 children born to a fisherman, Murayama graduated from Meiji University in Tokyo in 1946 and then returned to Ōita, where he became an activist in the local fishermen’s union. Most of his subsequent political career was spent in relative obscurity. He won election to the Ōita city assembly in 1955 and moved up to a seat in the Ōita prefectural assembly in 1963. He was elected to the lower house of the Diet (parliament) in 1972 as a member of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) and was successively reelected thereafter. Murayama first gained national recognition when, as a compromise candidate, he became the leader of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDJP; the party’s new official name in English from 1991) in 1993."
