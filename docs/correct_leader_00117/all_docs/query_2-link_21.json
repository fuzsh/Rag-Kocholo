        "text": "The âunsolved problemsâ discussed in Vientiane were primarily issues regarding Japanese grants of economic cooperation for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. A similar funding was already given to the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), with which Japan had officially instituted diplomatic relations during that period. The two governments had more than 20 official and unofficial meetings, and finally, on October 6, 1975, they reached an agreement on an endowment of 13.5 billion yen.\n\nThe document shown here is the one submitted to the Cabinet Meeting with respect to the exchange of letters concerning the grant for economic revitalization and development (dated 7th October) and a part of its attached documents. Submission to the Cabinet Meeting refers to the call for the meeting for a matter that requires a decision by the Cabinet at the Cabinet Meeting by a minister who is in charge of the issue. When approved by the Cabinet Meeting, it is authorized as a âCabinet Decision.â The presented document was submitted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and prior to the submission, as one can see from the hand-written notes in the margin of the page, it was agreed upon by related ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Economic Planning Agency. The signing was commissioned to Kiyoshi Suganuma, then the ambassador extraordinaire and plenipotentiary of Japan to Laos.\n\nA draft for the Cabinet Decision, which would be the agenda of the Cabinet Meeting, and related reference materials are shown here. Other than these, the draft version of the Exchange of Notes (Japanese and French versions) is attached to the original records.\n\nThe Exchange of Notes was signed on October 11, 1975, in Hanoi by Kiyoshi Suganuma, then ambassador extraordinaire and plenipotentiary of Japan to Laos, and HoÃ ng VÄn Tiáº¿n, who was, at the time, the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs. This paper documented that at first, Japan would provide a grant of up to 8.5 billion yen (out of 13.5 billion grant in total) which would be spent in purchasing heavy machinery used for farmland cultivation and public works provided by corporations owned by Japanese nationals.\n\nThe document introduced here is the one signed by the Vietnamese side and handed to Japan. It is now kept by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Japan.\n\nThe signing of the Paris Peace Accords on ending the war and restoring peace in Vietnam in January 1973 opened a new phase in VietnamâJapan relations. After signing the joint declaration on establishing diplomatic relations on September 21, 1973, Vietnam and Japan officially opened embassies in Tokyo and Hanoi, respectively, in 1975. On April 29, 1976, the Standing Committee of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam enacted Decision No. 120/NQ/QH/K5, which approved Nguyá» n GiÃ¡p as the first Ambassador Extraordinaire and Plenipotentiary to Japan.\n\nThe record was originally maintained in the collection of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. It was subsequently transferred to National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam for long-term preservation.\n\nThe âProcÃ¨s-Verbal,â a signed agreement that resulted from the 2-year negotiation in Vientiane, documented the following points: (1) The two countries would sign an Exchange of Notes concerning the grant of 8.5 billion yen for economic cooperation, (2) the remaining of the 5 billion yen endowment would be negotiated after the opening of the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi, and (3) the North Vietnamese government would agree with the opening of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam on October 11, 1975. As such, the inauguration of the Japanese Embassy was agreed to be simultaneous with the grant for economic cooperation. After this development, Yukio Imagawa was assigned as a ChargÃ© d'affaires ad interium to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and started his work establishing the Embassy in Hanoi.\n\nAt the Cabinet Meeting on January 30, 1976, Takaaki Hasegawa, Consul-General of Japan in Honolulu, was appointed the Ambassador Extraordinaire and Plenipotentiary to Vietnam. The document shown here is the Cabinet Document dated 8th of July 1976 that mandated Ambassador Hasegawa to go to Vietnam. âKaoh,â stylized signatures indicating approval by each Minister, are seen on the first page, and Hasegawaâs biography is attached to the last page.\n\nIn addition, although Vietnam was divided into North and South after July in 1954 when the Geneva Accords was signed, the reunification of the nation was realized in July 1976, one year after the end of the Vietnam War, and the country renamed itself the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Japanese government provided the first yen loan to the Vietnamese government in 1978. The records shown here are the Submission to the Cabinet Meeting and the attached documents for reference.\n\nLike the Exchange of Notes concerning the grant for economic cooperation mentioned earlier, this material was also submitted by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The margin notes mention that, prior to the submission of the material, the negotiation was made among the concerned ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.\n\nAccording to the attached documents, a loan of up to 10 billion yen would be provided to the Vietnamese government to improve its balance of international payments. It would be used for the procurement of products and associated services on the condition that the suppliers would not be limited to Japanese nationals and could belong to other countries.\n\nTelecommunications is not only a significant factor of economic development but also a key economic sector in itself. Thus, improving the telecommunication system in rural areas has become an urgent requirement for Vietnamâs process of national industrialization and modernization.\n\nTo realize the objectives set for developing telecommunication systems in rural areas, NgÃ´ XuÃ¢n Lá»c, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam signed the Decision No. 447/QÄ-TTg on June 1, 1998, approving the Central Vietnam Rural Telecommunication Network Project, which was financed by an ODA loan from the Japanese government for fiscal year 1997.\n\nThe project has made profound contribution in terms of the restructuring of the economy, the enhancement of production, the alleviation of poverty, and raising the intellectual standards of the Vietnamese people. It has thus helped in eradicating the gap between rural and urban areas and has aided in ensuring better communication from the central to local governments and vice versa.\n\nThis record belonged to the collection of the Prime Ministerâs Office, and it is now kept in National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nHáº£i VÃ¢n pass is situated on National Highway No. 1, which connects Hue and Da Nang. It constitutes a strategic pass in the EastâWest Corridor linking central Vietnam with Laos and Thailand. However, owing to its difficult terrain, this is one of the most dangerous sections of the highway.\n\nTo shorten travel time as well as to ensure safe passage and make a contribution to socio-economic development, Deputy Prime Minister NgÃ´ XuÃ¢n Lá»c signed the Decision No. 905/QD-TTg on September 30, 1998, approving the Háº£i VÃ¢n Tunnel Construction Project which was mainly financed by a loan provided by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan. The four-page decision specifically identified the project location, scale of construction, design specifications, project duration, etc.\n\nThe document was maintained in the Prime Ministerâs Office collection, and it is now preserved in National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nBy the early 2000, there were only three bridges across the Red River connecting Hanoi Capital with the northern and southern provinces through National Highway No. 1 and No. 5. To reduce traffic congestion and to promote socio-economic development in the Hanoi area, on November 26, 1999, Prime Minister Phan VÄn Kháº£i signed the Decision No. 1106/QD-TTg based on the Ministry of Transportationâs proposal. This Red River Bridge Construction Project (or Thanh TrÃ¬ Bridge) and the building of the southern portion of Hanoi Ring Road No. 3 were financed by a loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).\n\nThe total length of the route is 12.4 kilometers and includes Thanh TrÃ¬ Bridge over the Red River and the road connecting the north point of the bridge with National Highway No. 5.\n\nThe bridge opened for public use in February 2007. It is now the longest among seven viaducts in the Hanoi area that connect the two sides of the Red River.\n\nThe document belonged to the Prime Ministerâs Office collection, which is now preserved in National Archives Center No. 3 under the State Records and Archives Department of Vietnam.\n\nIn March, 1993, Mr VÃµ VÄn Kiá»t visited Japan for the first time as the prime minister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa welcomed him and celebrated this moment as âthe beginning of a new era for Japan and Vietnam.â Miyazawa also praised the Doi Moi policy of transforming Vietnamâs planned economy to a market economy and of projecting its openness to the international community, an effort initiated by Vietnam since 1986. The Japanese premier also announced his countryâs support for this Vietnamese policy. In addition, the Japanese government announced a plan to dispatch research groups for economic cooperation between the two countries and to offer a large-scale Yen Loan. Prime Minister Kiá»t strongly confirmed that the Vietnamese government would continue the Doi Moi policy.\n\nThe photo introduced here depicts Prime Ministers Miyazawa (right) and Kiá»t (left) shaking hands at the beginning of the summit meeting held on 25 March. This photo is a part of âthe special collection of the successive prime ministers,â a collection of publicity photos dated from 1968 (Prime Minister Eisaku Sato) to 2000 (Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi). The collection was originally kept by the Cabinet Public Relations Office.\n\nPrime Minister Tomiichi Murayama visited four South East Asian countries from August 23 to 29 in 1994. He was the first Japanese Prime Minister to visit the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, and this part of his tour attracted most of the spotlight. Furthermore, it was very timely because the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) had just decided that Vietnam would be inducted as a full member of the association from the following year. Also, many people expected that the normalization of the diplomatic relations between the USA and Vietnam would be soon realized.\n\nIn the summit meeting with Prime Minister VÃµ VÄn Kiá»t, Prime Minister Murayama referred to a new plan of 7.7 billion yen-loan for improving industrial infrastructures such as roads, ports, and railways, and mooted a scheme to start regular meetings on political and security issues at the vice-foreign minister level. The two countries agreed. In addition, Japan announced the âFriendship Plan for Japan and Indochinaâ to invite 750 young people altogether from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam in 5 years starting from 1995 (500 persons from Vietnam).\n\nThe photo introduced here shows Prime Ministers Kiá»t (left) and Murayama (right) reviewing the Guards of Honour at the Welcome ceremony.\n\nFrom April 17 to 21, 1995, Äá» MÆ°á»i, the Secretary General of the Communist Party, visited Japan for the first time as the highest leader of Vietnam. In the previous year, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama visited Vietnam and invited Äá» MÆ°á»i to come to Japan.\n\nDuring his stay in Japan, Äá» MÆ°á»i met His Majesty the Emperor. After the summit meeting, Prime Minister Murayama and Secretary General Äá» MÆ°á»i attended the signing ceremony of notes on a 58 billion yen-loan exchanged between Kozo Igarashi, Chief Cabinet Secretary, and Nguyá» n Máº¡nh Cáº§m, Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe photograph revealed here was taken at the welcome dinner party held at the prime minister's official residence. One of the invitees, Ayako Kobayasi (right), was the actor who played the main character of âOshin,â an NHK TV drama that was broadcast in Vietnam and gained wide popularity.\n\nIn the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis (1997â1998), ASEAN-related summit meetings were held in Hanoi from December 15 to 16, 1998. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi arrived at Hanoi and attended the ASEAN+3 (Japan, China, and Korea) Summit. In the meeting that was chaired by the Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan VÄn Kháº£i, the Japanese Prime Minister announced the âObuchi Initiativeâ to support East Asian countries seriously hit by the financial crisis.\n\nAfter attending the ASEAN-related meetings, Obuchi stayed in Hanoi on December 17 to conduct an official visit to Vietnam, met with three top leaders, including Prime Minister Phan VÄn Kháº£i, and discussed further development of bilateral relations. In the afternoon of the same day, he visited Hochiminh City as the first Japanese prime minister to do so after the reunification of Vietnam. He returned to Japan on December 18.\n\nThis is a photo taken when he visited the Chá»£ Ráº«y Hospital in Hochiminh City, the largest national medical facility in the southern part of Vietnam. The hospital was constructed and upgraded by a Japanese ODA grant."
