        "text": "The DPJ really could disappear after the next election. The key problem is that if you support Noda's policies, you are probably an LDP supporter. And if you voted for the DPJ when you put them into power based on their manifesto, you are now either going to vote for Ozawa's party, or the Social Democrats, or more likely, the vast majority of such voters will simply not bother going to the polls.\n\nThat and a yakuza linked Justice Minister didn't help him much either.\n\nThe US hates the DPJ because of Hatoyama and their desire, shared by that of the entire left in Japan, to renegotiate the terms of the security treaty with the US. The LDP was created by and remains owned by the US, and they don't make trouble over things like rapes, or dodgy aircraft, or noisy bases, and so on.\n\nNoda's done an admirable job of gettting legislation through, but only because he is no longer implementing the DPJ's policy program - he is pushing the LDP to support him for their own policies. I think it's clear that the DPJ will be destroyed in the next election.\n\nTwice now, the left has proven itself to be spectacularly incompetent at governance in Japan.\n\n@Hikozaemon\n\nTwice now, the left has proven itself to be spectacularly incompetent at governance in Japan.\n\nThe left has never really governed for any length of time in Japan post WWII. Can we really say there was spectacular incompetence?\n\nTetsu Katayama of the Socialist party governed between 1947-48 and enacted some very progressive measures, such as establishing a Ministry of Labour and the Unemployment Compensation Act.\n\nBetween 1993-94 for about six months there was a coalition government headed by Japan New Party with some left-leaning parties under former PM Hosokawa (who came out of the Liberal Democratic Party).\n\nThen the Japan Socialist Party governed as puppets in coalition with the LDP under Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama from 1994 to January 1996.\n\nFor the past few years there has been the Democratic party of Japan, made up of various factions, such as former conservative or neo-liberal LDP members (for example Ozawa), former members of the centrist Democratic Socialist Party, a liberal leaning faction with people like former PM Kan, and a left-leaning faction, created by former Japan Socialist Party members. We can hardly call this a party of the left. If we look at the leaders of the DPJ, there was Hatoyama, a former LDP member, Kan, a liberal, and now Noda, a fiscal conservative.\n\nThe DPJ governance the past few year has been awful, but no more so than the LDP governance that proceeded it.\n\nNow we really need a proper left leaning party with a green agenda to emerge, as in Germany, to challenge the Nationalists such as Ishihara and Hashimoto, the Neo-liberal LDP, and the Centrist DPJ. Also, the power of the bureaucrats must be broken, or they will resist any kind of outside the box changes that are required for the first capitalist nation that will face a drastically shrinking population--which makes GDP growth impossible.\n\nWarispeace - Murayama was a failure, Hata was a failure, Hosokawa was a failure.\n\nI'm not saying the LDP is better. It's just confirming that there aren't better options, as much as I wish there were.\n\nThomas Anderson - Noda is to the right of most even in the LDP. But his party is a leftist party - at least it is made up of ex SDP and centrist LDP elements. Noda certainly isn't leftist, but the DPJ under him, and Kan and Hatoyama overall as a hope for a less right wing alternative to the LDP has proven to be an abject failure.\n\n@Hikozaemon\n\nWarispeace - Murayama was a failure, Hata was a failure, Hosokawa was a failure.\n\nI think your idea of what is left politics needs reconsideration.\n\nThe administrations you mentioned were not social justice seeking leftwing administrations by any means. Hosokawa didn't last long enough to be a success or failure and he came out of LDP politics. Hata was from the Japan Renewal Party, (新生党, Shinseitō). It was established in 1993 by 44 members of the Liberal Democratic Party led by Hata and Ozawa. Hata was in office only 2 months, so again impossible to judge. Murayama, of the Socialist Party, infuriated many supporters of his party by steering to the centre to appease his biggest coalition partner, the LDP. I agree that his administration was a failure, especially when he buckled on coming out strong against the Security Pact between Japan and the United States. Apologizing for Japan's atrocities committed during World War II was his most notable act.\n\nWarispeace - you said it for me.\n\nHata only managed to stay in power for two months. Murayama sold out completely right away - I agree that his administration was a failure\n\nIn terms of left politics - Murayama was far left - Kan was probably the furthest left PM ever.\n\nBut you are disqualifying Hosokawa because he was originally in the LDP. Well, sure. But if you want leftists in the LDP, check out Nonaka - probably the most powerful and extreme leftist Japan has had since Meiji. A faction leader of the LDP.\n\nI think you're the one making the mistake of presuming that the LDP is ideological.\n\nFor what it's worth, no party to the right of the LDP has ever made it into power in Japan - those members of the DPJ and its forbears that originated from the SDP - you are talking about people with roots arguably to the left of the JCP, in that at least the JCP disowned mainland communists, which the SDP didn't (until after they came out about kidnapping Japanese).\n\nCoalition oppositions to the LDP are largely opportunist rather than ideological (Noda representing the extreme of that trend) but they still place themselves to the left and not the right of the LDP. And they have all been abject failures.\n\nNoda is arguably the most successful non-LDP PM of all time. And look, he has basically burned the DPJ manifesto, all its promises and principles, and swapped them for the counsel of the ministry of finance and the LDP policy playbook.\n\nThe problem in Japan is simple - it isn't politics, it's the machine. You only get ahead if you sell out to the man. That is the principle the LDP follows above all, and it is what Noda was clever about learning. Policy positions and all the other stuff is just for show. If you ever make out you want to think for yourself with any kind of ideology, the machine takes them out. That is why non-LDP administrations burned so hard.\n\nI think your idea of Japanese politics needs reexamination.\n\nPeace"
