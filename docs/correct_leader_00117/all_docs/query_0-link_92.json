        "text": "Shintaro Ishihara, the most nationalist, outspoken and popular politician in Japan, began a second term as Tokyo governor this week, amid speculation that he will move up to the post of prime minister before he completes his five years in office.\n\nSwept back to power with a record-high 70% of the vote, the 70-year-old governor has hinted that the victory could provide a springboard for a campaign for the nation's top political post.\n\nThat is an alarming prospect for other countries in north-east Asia, who have looked on aghast as Mr Ishihara has called for Japan to bomb North Korea, argued that the military should be strengthened, and made disparaging remarks about immigrants, women and China.\n\nFor most of the postwar era, such comments would have been political suicide in Japan, where a strong pacifist ethos ran through society. But they strike a chord today, particular among a younger generation whose formative experience is of steady economic decline rather than the horrors of war.\n\nSince the shortlived administration of the nominally socialist prime minister Tomiichi Murayama in 1995, a graph of Japan would show public opinion tending towards the political right as the economy goes down.\n\nMany of Mr Ishihara's views, however, would take him off the chart completely. Asked recently how he would deal with North Korea's abduction of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 80s, the Tokyo governor answered \"revenge\".\n\nAlthough Japan already has the world's second biggest military budget, Mr Ishihara has called for the country to develop more advanced conventional weapons and to drop its exclusive emphasis on self-defence.\n\nThe governor of Japan's most cosmopolitan city has used derogatory terms for Koreans and Chinese people and warned that illegal immigrants would go on a rampage of looting if Tokyo were ever to be struck by an earthquake.\n\nFar from upsetting voters, such radical statements have gone down well with a public that is tired of politics as usual.\n\nAs well as the support of 3 million Tokyo voters, nationwide polls indicate an approval rating of 75% for Mr Ishihara - far higher than that for the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, or any other member of the government.\n\nPart of the Tokyo governor's appeal is down to his celebrity status. A prize-winning author, whose deceased brother was one of the most popular actors in Japan, Mr Ishihara is a brilliant communicator whose witty, blunt but simple messages stand out from the usual bland and ambiguous statements of party politicians and bureaucrats.\n\nHis policies have also struck a chord. As Tokyo governor, Mr Ishihara knows that he can be as outrageous as he likes about foreign policy without having to take any of the responsibility. This has allowed him to develop a reputation as a tough guy without any political cost. After more than a decade of political drift, voters are more willing than ever to listen to someone who promises to stop the rot.\n\nMr Ishihara's rise also reflects a crisis of conventional politics in a country where two-party democracy never took root. The Liberal Democratic party, which has ruled for all but one of the past 48 years, is despised as corrupt and inefficient. Yet the biggest opposition party is in such disarray that it can claim only about 5% of the vote.\n\nAs well as in Tokyo, populist independents - on both sides of the political spectrum - have made major gains in regional elections in recent years. The main tension in Japanese politics is now not between the left and the right, but between central and local governments.\n\nWith little sign of an end to Japan's long and slow economic decline, speculation has been rife for more than three years of a dramatic political realignment in which Mr Ishihara would rise to the top of a \"national unity\" government.\n\nHis supporters, including many prominent members of the ruling LDP, say they are biding their time, waiting for the major crisis that would be needed to propel the governor of Tokyo across the city and into the prime minister's residence.\n\nWith the stock market having lost almost half of its value since Mr Koizumi took office two years ago, and amid rising criticism of the government's economic policy among business leaders, that moment may not be far away.\n\nFor now, however, Mr Ishihara says he will be like a wolf biting an elephant in trying to force the central government to change direction. If that fails to work, he says he will watch and wait for a chance to enter national politics."
