Murayama was elected prime minister by the National Diet on 29 June 1994 after the threat of a no-confidence vote had brought down the previous minority Hata Cabinet. Murayama's and his cabinet's formal investiture by the Emperor took place one day later.\n\nThe coalition cabinet consisted of 13 Liberal Democrats, six Socialists (including the Prime Minister) and two members of New Party Sakigake. All ministers were members of the Diet, the only woman in the cabinet was science and technology minister Makiko Tanaka.\n\nThe government lasted until January 5, 1996, when Murayama announced his resignation. The 3-party coalition continued under LDP leadership with Deputy Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto becoming the new Prime Minister on January 11.[1]\n\nThe decision by the LDP to support the leader of their traditional rival, the Socialists, for Prime Minister caused a split in party ranks. Former LDP Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced that he was leaving the party and was put forward by the anti-LDP coalition parties led by Tsutomu Hata and Ichirō Ozawa as their candidate for Prime Minister when the vote was held on June 29.[2]\n\n29 June 1994\n\nAbsolute majority (256/511) required House of Representatives Choice First Vote Votes Tomiichi Murayama\n\n241 / 511\n\nToshiki Kaifu\n\n220 / 511\n\nTetsuzo Fuwa\n\n15 / 511\n\nYohei Kono\n\n5 / 511\n\nBlank Ballot\n\n23 / 511\n\nAbstentions (Including Speaker and Deputy)\n\n7 / 511\n\nSource Political Data: Japanese Politics 1994\n\nSince no candidate gained an absolute majority in the first round, a runoff vote between Murayama and Kaifu was held later the same day, with Murayama being elected with the support of the Japan Socialist Party, New Party Sakigake and the majority of the LDP.\n\n29 June 1994\n\nSimple majority required House of Representatives Choice Runoff Vote Votes YTomiichi Murayama\n\n261 / 511\n\nToshiki Kaifu\n\n214 / 511\n\nBlank Ballot\n\n29 / 511\n\nAbstentions (Including Speaker and Deputy)\n\n7 / 511\n\nSource Political Data: Japanese Politics 1994\n\nSocialist\n\nLiberal Democratic\n\nNew Party Sakigake\n\nIndependent\n\nR = Member of the House of Representatives\n\nC = Member of the House of Councillors\n\nMurayama Cabinet from 30 June 1994 to 8 August 1995 Portfolio Minister Term of office Diet membership Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama June 30, 1994 - January 11, 1996 R Ōita 1 Deputy Prime Minister Yōhei Kōno June 30, 1994 - October 2, 1995 R Kanagawa 3 Minister of Foreign Affairs June 30, 1994 - January 11, 1996 Minister of Justice Isao Maeda June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 C Wakayama Minister of Finance Masayoshi Takemura June 30, 1994 - January 11, 1996 R Shiga at-large Minister of Education Kaoru Yosano June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Tokyo 1 Minister of Welfare Shōichi Ide June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Nagano 2 Minister of Agriculture Taichirō Ōgawara June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 C national proportional Minister of Trade and Industry Ryūtarō Hashimoto June 30, 1994 - January 11, 1996 R Okayama 2 Minister of Transportation Shizuka Kamei June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Hiroshima 3 Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Shun Ōide June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Kanagawa 4 Minister of Labour Mansō Hamamoto June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 C Hiroshima Minister of Construction Koken Nosaka June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Tottori at-large Minister of Home Affairs\n\nChairman of the National Public Safety Commission Hiromu Nonaka June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Kyoto 2 Chief Cabinet Secretary Kōzō Igarashi June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Hokkaidō 2 Director of the Management and Coordination Agency Tsuruo Yamaguchi June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Gunma 3 Director of the Hokkaidō Development Agency\n\nDirector of the Okinawa Development Agency Sadayoshi Ozato June 30, 1994 - January 20, 1995 R Kagoshima 2 Kiyoshi Ozawa January 20, 1995 - August 8, 1995 R Tokyo 7 Director of the Defense Agency Masahiko Kōmura June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Yamaguchi 2 Director of the Economic Planning Agency Tokuichirō Tamazawa June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Iwate 1 Director of the Science and Technology Agency Makiko Tanaka June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Niigata 3 Director of the Environment Agency Shin Sakurai June 30, 1994 - August 14, 1994 R Niigata 3 Sōhei Miyashita August 14, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Nagano 3 Director of the National Land Agency Kiyoshi Ozawa June 30, 1994 - August 8, 1995 R Tokyo 7 Minister of State (Disaster management) Sadayoshi Ozato January 20, 1995 - August 8, 1995 R Kagoshima 2\n\nAugust 14, 1994 - Environment Minister Shin Sakurai resigned after making controversial statements related to Japan's role in the Second World War and was replaced with Sohei Miyashita[3]\n\nJanuary 20, 1995 - Sadayoshi Ozato was moved to become the Director of the Disaster Management Agency in response to the Great Hanshin earthquake, and was replaced as minister for Okinawa and Hokkaido development by Kiyoshi Ozawa.\n\nDeputy Chief Cabinet Secretaries Hiroyuki Sonoda NPH HR, Kumamoto 2 Nobuo Ishihara\n\n(until 24 February 1995) – – Teijirō Furukawa\n\n(from 24 February 1995) – – Legislation Bureau Takao Ōde – –\n\nMurayama Cabinet from 8 August 1995 to January 11, 1996\n\nOctober 2 - Following the 1995 LDP Leadership election Ryutaro Hashimoto became LDP President and replaced Yōhei Kōno as Deputy Prime Minister.
