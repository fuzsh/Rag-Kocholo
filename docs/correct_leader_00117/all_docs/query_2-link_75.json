        "meta_description": "Post-normalisation Sino-Japanese relations have been fraught with contradictions. In particular, three paradoxes stand out over the past 40 years. First, despite many shared geopolitical and economic interests, China and Japan have never developed genuine strategic cooperation, and since the 2000s have even evinced a trend towards thinly-veiled or open rivalry. Second, time, rather than healing the wounds of past wars, has since the mid-1980s yielded only a more vivid and bitter recollection of history that has bedevilled both official and popular relations. Third, diplomatic and commercial ties as well as “thick” societal contacts developed since normalisation have failed to bridge a significant gap in values. This article reviews Sino-Japanese relations since 1972, with a special focus on internal politics on both sides. It considers the influence of their conflicting historical narratives and political systems, and of the broader international geopolitical context, on the evolution of their delicate, paradoxical bilateral relationship. It concludes that a healthier bilateral relationship may depend on the development in both countries of a genuine, robust civil society that is relatively free from political interference.",

        "text": "1Neighbouring countries with long-standing, rich historical and cultural connections, China and Japan fought two full-scale wars in modern times, first in 1894-1895 and later in 1937-1945 (though some historians date the onset of the second conflict as early as 1931). These wars, especially the second one, left immense physical and psychological trauma on both sides. After World War II, China and Japan allied themselves with the Soviet Union and United States respectively, thus acting as strategic adversaries for the initial two decades of the Cold War until diplomatic normalisation in 1972. This complex history set the stage for an extremely delicate bilateral relationship. Each country has treated the other as one of its most significant others, and over time their mutual attitudes have oscillated between emulation, envy, competition, and even hatred. As a result, in the 40 years since normalisation, Sino-Japanese relations have experienced a number of dramatic twists and turns, from the “honeymoon” of the 1970s, to renewed friction in the 1980s, and a period of volatility and downward spiral beginning from the mid-1990s. Entering the 2010s, in the context of repeated escalations of offshore islands disputes, their relationship has sunk to its lowest point since 1972.\n\n2Post-normalisation Sino-Japanese relations have not only followed a tortuous trajectory, but have also been fraught with contradictions. Students of this relationship are particularly puzzled by three outstanding paradoxes. First, why have China and Japan never developed a genuine strategic cooperation despite their many shared geopolitical and economic interests, instead (since the turn of the century) pursuing a thinly-veiled rivalry? Second, why has time not healed the wounds of past conflicts, with the period since the mid-1980s instead witnessing an increasingly vivid and bitter recollection of history that bedevils both official and popular relations? Third, why have conventional bilateral ties as well as “people-to-people” contacts developed since normalisation signally failed to bridge the significant divisions between the two societies in terms of values, trust, and mutual understanding?\n\n3This article is devoted to an overview of post-normalisation Sino-Japanese relations. I first provide a brief chronology of their bilateral relations from 1972 to the present day, before focusing on the three puzzles noted above. The analysis shows that the international geopolitical context and the contrasting political systems of the two countries have indeed significantly obstructed Sino-Japanese cooperation over the past 40 years. Nevertheless, the deterioration of their relationship actually began well before there appeared to be any prospect of China challenging Japan economically and militarily, and followed decades during which Japanese people had blithely ignored China’s authoritarianism. I therefore argue that emotions and biases deeply engrained in the two societies, reinforced by the machinations of insecure political elites, and largely unchallenged by the rather superficial nature of most bilateral interaction at the popular level, have contributed to the persistent recurrence of instability and tension in Sino-Japanese relations since 1972.\n\nThe bumpy path of post-normalisation relations\n\n4Soon after World War II, China and Japan were drawn into opposing strategic camps of the emerging Cold War in Asia. Antagonism reached a point of no return when Mao Zedong declared in June 1949 that China would lean to one side, the socialist side. For its part, Japan signed a security treaty with the United States, or Anpo, in September 1951 – in the midst of the Korean conflict, in which Chinese troops had intervened on the Communist side. Thereafter Japan recognised the Nationalist government in Taiwan as the sole legitimate representative of China. The freeze in Sino-Japanese relations lasted until normalisation in1972, which inaugurated four decades (so far) of bilateral ties marked by many ups and downs.\n\n5Initially Sino-Japanese relations experienced a honeymoon-like period, largely propelled by a common Soviet threat. From the early 1980s, however, the overall cordial atmosphere in the 1970s was replaced by frequent intergovernmental frictions and simmering popular antipathy. Bilateral relations enjoyed temporary serenity in the early 1990s, only to deteriorate again from the mid-1990s, marked by renewed political disputes over sovereignty and a downward spiral in mutual popular perceptions. During 2001-2006, top-level diplomacy was paralysed due to Beijing’s protests over Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi’s annual worship at the Yasukuni Shrine, a Shinto temple in Tokyo commemorating Japanese war dead, including Class-A war criminals from World War II. Beijing and Tokyo gradually mended the fence after 2006, although a strong undercurrent of mutual distrust persisted. From 2010, tensions over offshore islands resumed, culminating in massive anti-Japanese demonstrations in September 2012 and suspension of state meetings thereafter. Ironically, September 2012 marked the 40th anniversary of Sino-Japanese normalisation, yet represented an unprecedented low in bilateral relations over that period.\n\n6The key events in the development of Sino-Japanese relations since the 1970s summarised below provide the necessary scaffolding for the analysis in the subsequent sections.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué was signed in September 1972, terminating the state of war technically existing between Japan and the People’s Republic.\n\nThe Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty (PFT) was signed in August 1978.\n\nFrom 1979 Japan began to extend Official Development Aid (ODA) to China.\n\n1 According to a veteran Japan hand in China, Zhang Xiangshan, who was involved in the normalisation (...)\n\nDuring the negotiations over normalisation and the PFT, both Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping shelved the island disputes. Deng also proposed in 1979 to jointly explore with Japan the oil resources thought to surround the disputed islands.\n\nThe first Japanese textbook controversy erupted in summer 1982. On 15 August 1985, Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro paid an official visit to the Yasukuni Shrine. Anti-Japanese student demonstrations took place in China in fall 1985, and Japanese opinion polls around 1986 showed that public sentiment towards China worsened for the first time since 1982 (Graph 1). The Kokaryo Incident in 1987 revealed bilateral friction over Taiwan’s legal status.\n\nIn 1989, Japan joined Western sanctions against China after the Tiananmen Incident. In August 1991, Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki visited Beijing and agreed to resume Japanese ODA to China. In 1992, President Jiang Zemin and Emperor Akihito exchanged visits.\n\nWhile economic interdependence deepened, political relations deteriorated from the mid-1990s onwards. Chinese popular protests against Japan were largely suppressed in the 1990s, such as during the two controversies over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in 1990 and 1996.\n\nIn 1995, Japan suspended grant assistance to China in protest at its continued nuclear tests. In 1996 Prime Minister Hashimoto Ryutaro visited the Yasukuni Shrine, and new disputes over Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands took place. In 1998, President Jiang Zemin harshly criticised Japan’s wartime conduct during a formal visit to Japan.\n\nDuring 2002-2006 Beijing suspended mutual state visits. Japan began to cut ODA to China from 2001, and later decided to phase out new loans by 2008. Bilateral disputes over gas and oil resources in the East China Sea escalated in 2004-2005.\n\nIn April 2005, anti-Japanese demonstrations were held in many Chinese cities.\n\nFrom October 2006 to May 2008, Japan’s new prime ministers Abe Shinzo and Fukuda exchanged visits with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao and president Hu Jintao. However, the apparent warming of Sino-Japanese ties between 2006 and 2009 proved to be superficial and short-lived.\n\nControversies over poisoned gyoza imported from China occurred in 2008. In September 2010, a Chinese fishing boat collided with two Japanese Coast Guard vessels near the disputed islands, causing a diplomatic row.\n\nOn September 13, 2012, the Japanese Diet (parliament) approved a deal to nationalise the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. China sent government ships to patrol the islands and suspended top-level bilateral meetings. Massive anti-Japanese protests engulfed Chinese cities across coastal and inland regions, particularly on 18 September, the anniversary of the Mukden Incident of 1931 (which heralded the Japanese invasion of Manchuria). Meanwhile, Japanese popular feelings of affinity with China dropped to a historic low (Graph 1). The economic cost of the strife surrounding these islands has been huge. By the end of September 2012, Japan was running a trade deficit of $7 billion, unprecedented in 31 years, thanks to the economic weakness of Europe and strained relations with China. In 2011, China absorbed 22% of Japan’s exports and 20% of its imports. But in 2012 total Sino-Japanese trade registered a 3.9% decrease from 2011, the first decline in the three years following the global financial crisis.\n\nMinimal strategic cooperation despite common interests\n\n7The dramatic rise and decline in post-normalisation Sino-Japanese relations reveals the fragility and shallowness of their friendship. The fundamental mistrust that has underlain the relationship even during periods of apparent harmony is indicated by the absence of substantial strategic cooperation between the two, notwithstanding their close economic interdependence, the common threat facing them during the Cold War, and their many shared geopolitical interests in the years since the fall of the USSR. In the absence of the sort of active, structured partnership that builds bilateral trust, the two countries have in recent years allowed themselves to drift into a pattern of growing rivalry.\n\nIntensifying memory contestation: Time fails to heal the wounds of war\n\n18The reasons for the subsequent politicisation of the past stemmed largely from domestic factors within both societies. By the 1980s, Japan had become an economic giant and was ready to assert international political influence commensurate with its economic power. In the view of the conservative elites, however, the prevalence of a “self-torturing belief” about Japan’s war history deprived the younger generation of a strong sense of national purpose. Conservatives believed that Japan must restore national confidence and pride through reinterpreting its recent history. One step toward this goal was seen as a tightening of the textbook authorisation process so as to reverse a recent moderate increase in textbook coverage of the wartime suffering of Asian peoples. More broadly, conservative establishment figures hoped to permanently dispel the shadow of the past over Japan’s contemporary politics. Thus Prime Minister Nakasone paid official homage at the Yasukuni Shrine on 15 August 1985 as a symbolic gesture renouncing notions of the war as “shameful” and embracing a “positive” national identity.\n\n19This conservative perspective on history was criticised not only by domestic left-wing forces but also by the outside world. The unusual stir in the international media created by Japan’s textbook and Yasukuni controversies put pressure on China to respond. But Beijing’s reactions were not impulsive; domestic political calculations, not genuine concerns about Japanese national myths constructed since the war, supplied the main motivation. After the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s prestige seriously declined, exacerbated by the negative side effects of economic reform, such as increases in inflation, unemployment, corruption, and crime. In order to build a broad reform coalition, Deng Xiaoping made a compromise at the 12th Party Congress held in September 1982 with party conservatives in exchange for their endorsement of the reform and open-door policy. The first Japanese textbook incident, which came shortly before the Party Congress, provided a good opportunity for Deng to shore up domestic political unity. A tough stance on Japan could appease party hard-liners who were alarmed by Western ideological influences that had entered China since the onset of reform. Bashing Japan on the history issue could also boost patriotism and salvage the declining legitimacy of the Communist regime.\n\n20In fact, after the 1982 textbook controversy, Chinese official propaganda began to shift from communist ideology emphasising class struggle to nationalism stimulated by the conflicts between the Chinese nation and those foreign nations that had invaded China in the past, especially Japan. War movies, state-sponsored historical research, and war commemoration now focused on Japanese wartime atrocities and heroic Chinese resistance. The Chinese public was so preoccupied with Chinese victimhood that it refused to distinguish Japanese militarists from ordinary Japanese people. Anti-Japanese student demonstrations in turn elicited frustration among the Japanese public, who remembered the war as a miserable experience for themselves, and were largely unaware of Japan’s victimisation of others. Thus, from very early on, Sino-Japanese disputes over history have involved not just government friction but also intense popular animosity.\n\n24But the provocation from the Japanese side was only one reason for the re-ignition of history disputes. The CCP’s credibility tumbled after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement. Post-Tiananmen Western sanctions also accentuated a siege mentality amongst the Chinese ruling class. Amidst worries over the regime’s survival, and with Communist ideology seeming increasingly irrelevant, the government redoubled its efforts to promote a nationalist ideology to maintain public support. A patriotic education campaign was not immediately implemented, however, largely due to Deng’s lying-low strategy after Tiananmen, until 1993-1994 when China had regained international confidence. The new history curriculum highlighted the 1937-45 Sino-Japanese War, which had previously been treated as merely one of many episodes in Chinese revolutionary history. The patriotic education campaign peaked in 1995, when Beijing launched a vigorous commemorative campaign for the 50th anniversary of China’s victory in the war.\n\n30This second major paradox in post-normalisation Sino-Japanese relations – the fact that history has become more rather than less problematic with the passage of time – serves as an excellent footnote to the first paradox discussed above. A major reason why China and Japan could not develop strategic solidarity in the 1970s-80s was their failure to settle old historical scores. Since the end of the Cold War, a combination of uncertain geopolitical context and unmitigated clash of memories has rendered the bilateral relationship increasingly hard to manage. Although moments of intense bilateral crisis have typically witnessed feverish fence-mending efforts, the sort of mutual understanding and trust that would prevent further crises remain weak. The paradox of persistent antipathy and a widening values gap despite frequent bilateral exchanges is what I turn to now.\n\nGrowing inter-societal connections and increasing alienation\n\nConclusion\n\n44When China and Japan normalised relations in 1972, they expressed a wish to maintain friendship “from generation to generation.” The reality is that relations have fluctuated dramatically over the past 40 years, with a slide into armed conflict recently beginning to seem a real possibility. On close examination, the high degree of shared interest and absence of critical strategic conflict between the two countries makes this deterioration in bilateral relations bewildering. In contrast to the situation in the 1930s, when economic dislocation, political dysfunction and the rise of militarism in Japan set the country on a collision course with China, or during the Cold War, when they were engulfed by a global superpower struggle, today strategic antagonism between the two countries appears far from predestined. Their emerging strategic rivalry, currently most visible in the mutual arms build-up and provocative behaviour in the East China Sea, has indeed stemmed from a visible power shift over the past five to ten years. But bilateral competition has been reinforced by cultural-ideational forces. In particular, mutual threat perceptions are frequently magnified and refracted through the prism of distorted historical narratives. Although the role of popular culture and folk memory have undoubtedly been significant in shaping visions of the other country, the manipulation of memory by opportunistic elements within the elites of both countries has poisoned an otherwise calm and rational atmosphere for bilateral relations. Moreover, although politicisation of history may be undertaken primarily with domestic ends in view, the fact that it is conducted under the gaze of the international media magnifies its potential for eliciting mutual antipathy and mistrust.\n\n46All these on-going trends – power redistribution in the economic and military arenas, combined with deep-seated historical biases, conflicting conceptions of national identity, and divergent political ideologies – bode ill for the future development of Sino-Japanese relations. One can imagine a continued downward trend where any conflict of interest is blown out of proportion rather than dealt with on the basis of rational and objective assessments, and overreaction becomes more and more the rule rather than the exception. The result is that secondary disputes increasingly crowd out mutually beneficial cooperation in areas concerning the larger national interests of the two countries and the daily lives of their peoples. If allowed to continue, this vicious cycle will become a huge source of security instability and jeopardise the economic prosperity not just of the two countries themselves but also of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole."
