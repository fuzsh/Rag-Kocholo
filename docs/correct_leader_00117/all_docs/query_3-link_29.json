        "text": "Source:Xinhua Published: 2014-2-12 17:56:29\n\nFormer Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to South Korea, his country's past colony from 1910 to 1945. The former Cabinet chief, famous for his apology for past wartime atrocities while in office, picked the exhibition of artworks by so-called \"comfort women\" as his first place to visit.\n\nAt the exhibition, Murayama met three South Korean women who were coerced into sex slaves for the Japanese Imperial Army during the World War II. The 91-year-old told the women of old age \"You look younger than me. Please be healthy always.\"He became the first among incumbent and former Japanese prime ministers who meet with the victims of the sex slavery.\n\nWhile holding hands of the former sex slaves, the former Japanese prime minister was lowering his head deeply.\"When I met the comfort women of old age and saw the pictures drawn by them, I became speechless. I hung my head down, and could not raise it up, \"he said Wednesday during his lecture to South Korean lawmakers at the parliamentary headquarters.\n\nMore than 200,000 young women, many of them South Koreans, were forced into the sex slavery at the Japanese military brothel during the devastating world war triggered by the Japanese militarists. Among 237 South Korean women who identified themselves as former sex slaves, only 56 are alive.\n\nMurayama said that Japan\"did the indescribable wrongdoings, which rob women of their dignity.\" Some people in Japan made many absurd remarks about the comfort women, but he said he felt ashamed of it, stressing that a majority of Japanese were well aware of Japan's past brutalities.\n\nIt must be crystal-clear that incumbent Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe does not belong to the majority. Abe paid respect to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine about two months earlier, raising suspicions from neighboring countries that the Abe cabinet was seeking to deny its militaristic past.\n\nThe war-linked shrine is widely seen as a symbol of Japan's militaristic past as it enshrines 14 World War II class-A war criminals. Japanese conservatives, who plotted to earn ballots from far rightists, honored the imperialistic symbol in the past.\n\nAbe sought in late January to shun acknowledging Japan's past colonial rule and war of aggression, the essence of the\"Murayama Statement.\"Asked whether he inherits the statement at the parliament, the prime minister just answered Japan caused tremendous damage and suffering to the peoples of many Asian countries.\n\nPestered by the Democratic Party lawmaker with the same questions, Abe reluctantly gave an answer that he had never denied its past colonial rule and invasion.\n\nMurayama said in his 1995 speech that Japan\"caused tremendous damage and suffering to the peoples of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\"through its colonial rule and aggression after a mistaken national policy that led to war.\n\nHe said that\"anyone who denies the Murayama Statement should resign from his Cabinet post,\"noting that he was assured of Abe's succession of the past apology because Abe cannot deny the undeniable fact of Japan's past invasion.\n\nWhen Abe formed his first cabinet from 2006 to 2007, he said he will inherit the Murayama Statement, but some noise has been heard since the second Abe cabinet was launched in late 2012, Murayama said.\n\nHis comments indicated what is hidden behind Abe's ahistorical actions and words: garnering support of all right-wing elements by honoring war criminals, denying historical facts and seeking to revive militarism and nationalism.\n\nAbe sought the so-called\"active pacifism\" by trying to revise the pacifist Constitution, but neighboring countries held suspicions that Japan was pushing to scrap restrictions on its military and initiate hostilities as seen during the World War II. The 1947 US-drafted constitution has prevented Japanese self- defense forces from waging a war, but US secretaries of state and defense agreed with his Japanese counterparts in October last year to allow Japan to exercise the collective self-defense right.\n\n\"Japan declared its abandonment of waging a war through the pacifist Constitution. It prevented the Japanese self-defense forces from falling into a war,\"Murayama said, stressing that the constitution must be protected in any event. He said that there were many Japanese people who share such thought with him, adding that it will contribute to national interests of Japan as well as to peace and prosperity in the region.\n\nThe ongoing historical and territorial disputes between Seoul and Tokyo as well as Beijing stemmed mainly from Abe's wrong perception of history and refusal to repent its past brutalities. Unless Abe faces up to its history in a right way, there would be no future-oriented friendship with its neighbors.\n\n\"Japan must squarely face up to its history and apologize for it,\" said Murayama. \"South Korea and Japan must establish future- oriented relationship based on Japan's repent over its past brutalities,\"he said."
