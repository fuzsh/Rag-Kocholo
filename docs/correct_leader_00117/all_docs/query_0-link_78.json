        "text": "TOKYO -- Two former political leaders who made key apologies over Japan's World War II atrocities said Tuesday that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should not water down their words when he marks the 70th anniversary of the war's end.\n\nJapanese leaders' war anniversary statements have always been closely watched, and this year's is getting extra attention because it marks the 70th anniversary and because Abe is considered a revisionist.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, who authored Japan's landmark 1995 apology marking the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, advised that Abe \"honestly spell out\" the country's wartime actions to address growing international concern that he may revise history.\n\nYohei Kono, who as chief Cabinet secretary in 1993 apologized to victims of Japan's wartime military sexual exploitation, said he wondered whether a new statement by Abe is even necessary. He said a statement to mark the 70th anniversary, if issued, should not backpedal from any of the apologies that Abe promised to inherit from nearly a dozen past leaders.\n\nKono's 1993 statement apologized to people who are commonly known as \"comfort women.\" Historians have said tens of thousands of these women, including Japanese, Koreans and others from around Asia, were sent to front-line military brothels to provide sex to Japanese soldiers.\n\nMurayama and Kono spoke during a rare joint appearance at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo.\n\nThe historic statements by both men were regarded internationally as signs Japan had come to terms with its wartime past, and they improved relations with its Asian neighbors. However, both statements have become unpopular among Japanese conservatives, who say Japan should stop focusing on negative history to restore national pride.\n\nKono warned that any attempt to whitewash historical facts instead \"hurts the Japanese people's reputation.\"\n\nSince taking office in December 2012, Abe has said he would not necessarily follow the Murayama apology. He also has said there is no evidence that the so-called comfort women were exploited through coercion by Japanese authorities, remarks seen by critics as undermining the Kono apology. But after criticism from China and South Korea, Abe later promised not to change either of the statements.\n\nTokyo's relations with the two victims of its wartime militarism have worsened under Abe's leadership due to his historical views, particularly South Korea -- a former Japanese colony where many of the comfort women were from.\n\nAbe has given mixed signals as to how closely his forthcoming statement will mirror Murayama's apology. He is seen as avoiding the terms aggression, colonial rule and atrocities, including \"comfort women\" sexual exploitation.\n\nMurayama and Kono said those were undeniable historical facts that must be remembered to maintain trust and confidence.\n\nAbe has convened experts to advise him on what to say. In his past Aug. 15 speeches, Abe omitted his predecessors' references to the damage Japan inflicted on its Asian victims and apologies to them. He merely said Japan faces its past and keeps its peace pledges.\n\nA Section on 06/10/2015"
