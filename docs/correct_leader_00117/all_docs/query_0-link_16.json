        "text": "Tomiichi Murayama, who as prime minister issued a landmark statement of “remorse” for Japan’s actions in World War II, marked his 100th birthday on March 2, expressing his hope that the country will continue its postwar path of peace.\n\nMurayama was born in Oita city on March 3, 1924. He served as prime minister for 561 days from June 30, 1994, to Jan. 11, 1996.\n\nHe became the third prime minister in Japan’s history to reach the age of 100. The other two are Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who died in 1990 at the age of 102, and Yasuhiro Nakasone, who died in 2019 at the age of101.\n\nWith his trademark bushy eyebrows, Murayama acquired a reputation as a prime minister for common people.\n\nIn a statement issued through the Social Democratic Party, a successor of the Japan Socialist Party that he headed, Murayama said, “I hope that Japan will always remain a peaceful country.”\n\nHe added: “I don’t really feel that I am 100 years old, but I am happy to live naturally and spend each day with my family.”\n\nAs for his daily routine, he said, “I look forward to watching sumo on TV. I go to day care three times a week and continue to walk and do exercises twice a day.”\n\nMizuho Fukushima, leader of the SDP, said in a message posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Congratulations to you and your wife for turning 100 years old together! We will do our best to realize peace.”"
