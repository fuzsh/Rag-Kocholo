        "text": "The 1960s was a dramatic decade in film. It saw the end of the Golden Age of Hollywood as the studio system shifted, as did acting styles, no doubt influenced by the Italian Neo-Realist and French New Wave movements. It saw the dawn of the New Hollywood era, a period of time where directors had more creative control than the studios, which saw edgier, boundary-pushing subject matter. The Hayes Code was abandoned in favor of a ratings system, the MPAA, a parent-member watchdog group that is still utilized today.\n\nThe first half of the decade, representing the end of the Golden Age, carried through the spectacle of the previous decade that attempted to draw people away from the television sets: westerns, biblical, and historical epics stuffed with huge casts frequented that period of the decade. There were also several films about World War II and a couple about the Korean War, as the nation continued wrestling with and honoring chapters of those periods. This was just as the country saw itself entering a new war in the East. If it wasn’t war films, westerns, or epics of some sort then there was usually a musical or live action Disney movie playing nearby to help escape reality. Some filmmakers, however, wanted to explore reality in ways film hadn’t before. So, there was more violence, harsher language, and more mature content in the films of the ‘60s. You also saw the dawn of a new genre, the action film, due to the 007 spy series and crime films like Bullitt. This would gradually expand in the ‘70s before exploding in the ‘80s.\n\nI’ve seen over 125 films from the ‘60s. This list took the longest and was the most difficult to organize, as I had to watch or re-watch over 40 movies to prepare. Movies that I didn’t get to squeeze in for consideration include westerns like How the West Was Won and Once Upon a Time in the West and foreign films like Last Year at Marienbad, L’avventura, and Week End. Films that were strongly considered that didn’t make the list include Cleo from 5 to 7, Eyes Without a Face, The Pink Panther, Through a Glass Darkly, Zulu, Cleopatra, Jason and the Argonauts, and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.\n\nBelow are my 60 favorites. I hope it serves as a guide for those who have some catching up to do and need some direction. For others it’ll be an enjoyable read to look out for their favorites.\n\nSo, those are my favorite movies of the 1960s. Every year of the decade is represented. The years 1962 and 1967 made the list the most with 9 films each. The year 1968 came in 2nd with 8 films. Oddly enough, when we did our favorite years in film on The Movie Lovers podcast only 1968 made my list. There are 7 Disney films on the list, which, by extension makes Robert Stevenson the director on the list the most since he directed 4 of them. Surprisingly, John Wayne beats out Eli Wallach and Lee Marvin for the most appearances on this list with 5 after being mostly absent in my ‘40s and ‘50s lists. The same could be said for the western genre, which also appears the most with 10 films tied only with comedies.\n\nAgain, the best resources for films from this decade are Amazon Prime and Max. You can also rent many films on Amazon. I hope you find some new favorites. What are some of your favorites from the decade already? Feel free to share."
