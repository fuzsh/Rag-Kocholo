        "text": "#11 of 12 films in my Adapted Screenplay Challenge (3)\n\nAfghan-American author Khaled Hosseini published this, his debut novel, in 2003 with Riverhead Books. The 371-page manuscript is divided into 25 chapters and is written primarily as a reminiscence from the point of view of an Afghan-American writer named Amir Qadiri, living in San Francisco in December 2001. I might add that I read much of this while on holiday in Phoenix, and while I was in the airport, on the plane and beside the pool at my motel, I kept getting people commenting, \"Oh, what a great book!\" That rarely happens, in my experience.\n\nThe first six chapters describe Amir's life in Kabul from his childhood in the 1960s up to the winter of 1975, when an important kite-flying competition took place in his neighborhood known as Wazir Akbar Khan. Historically, that period was characterized by an \"experiment in democracy\" under the reign of King Mohammad Zahir Shah until July 17, 1973, when a non-violent coup brought Prime Minister Mohammad Sardar Daoud Khan to power. Daoud \"abolished the monarchy, abrogated the 1964 constitution, and declared Afghanistan a republic with himself as its first President and Prime Minister.\"\n\nAmir's youthful recollections are set against the backdrop of those events. We learn that Amir's mother died in childbirth and he was raised by his Baba (father), a successful Pashtun businessman and philanthropist referred to by others with respect as the Agha Sahib. Amir recalls growing up with a harelipped boy named Hassan, the son of his father's Hazara servant Ali. Hassan's own mother ran off shortly after his birth, so both boys were suckled by the same nanny and grew up like brothers, despite their significant difference in social caste.\n\nAlthough Baba wanted his son to grown up confident, strong and athletic, Amir turned out to be a shy, bookish kid, taking after his mother, who was noted poet. Hassan, by contrast, was always brave, quick and feisty, despite his small stature and inability to read or write. For example, one day when the neighborhood bully Assef, the son of a Pashtun father and a German mother, decides to beat Amir with his brass knuckles, Hassan defends his friend with his slingshot, drawing from Assef a vow of revenge on them both.\n\nAmir explains how he was often jealous of how well Baba treated Hassan. He wanted his father's affection to himself. And sometimes Amir would deliberately trick the illiterate Hazara to make himself feel more important. But otherwise, the twosome were a team, at least until the big kite-flying contest and an event that caused Amir, at the age of twelve, to become \"what I am today.\"\n\nChapter Seven represents a critical point in the story. In the day-long battle of kites, Amir manages to outlast all the other competitors and win the championship as his father looks on. Meanwhile, in a tradition called \"kite running,\" Hassan chases after the blue kite that was Amir's last foe to drop from the sky. Whoever retrieves the fallen runner-up kite is considered to be almost as big a winner as the champion.\n\nOf course, speedy Hassan is successful, but when he takes his time coming back home, Amir sets out to find him. On a deadend street, he discovers Hassan confronted by sociopathic Assef and two of his buddies, demanding the blue kite or else he'll dish out the whipping he's put off for so long. But as Amir in hiding watches Hassan prepare to get thrashed rather than surrender the prize, Assef changes his mind. What follows is a horrid rape scene, which Amir does nothing to stop. Was it cowardice that held him back? Or was it something much worse -- a sense that the lowly Hazara deserved punishment at the hands of a Nazi-loving Pashtun out for revenge?\n\nThe next two chapters read like a confession, as Amir tells us of his change in demeanor following the incident. He becomes an insomniac. He gets car sick. He's riddled with guilt and wants to tell someone, but can't. He avoids contact with Hassan and becomes reclusive. Then, he does the unthinkable. He frames Hassan for the theft of a watch and money, so that Baba will dismiss Ali and get rid of the constant reminder of Amir's shame. But surprisingly, Hassan confesses to the crime and Baba forgives him. Amir is nonplussed by Hassan's loyalty, but Ali insists on leaving Kabul and returning to Hazarajat in Iran to live with his cousin. The damage done cannot be undone.\n\nChapter Ten jumps us ahead to March 1981, when Baba and Amir flee Kabul in a truck loaded with refugees headed to Pakistan. As a bit of historical background, a bloody military coup in April 1978 had brought Soviet-backed socialists to power, followed by a campaign of violent repression. To stabilize the country, the USSR's Red Army invaded in 1979 with 100,000 troops and occupied the capital. Years of genocide ensued, with at least 562,000 and perhaps as many as two million Afghans murdered. Reports tell us that \"about 6 million fled as Afghan refugees to Pakistan and Iran, and from there over 38,000 made it to the United States.\"\n\nThe next three chapters take us to Fremont, California in the 1980s, where Baba and Amir have resettled from Peshwar. Baba works in a gas station while Amir completes college. They both buy junk at garage sales on Saturdays to sell at a profit on Sundays at the San Jose flea market. It's there, amid the Afghani vendors, that Amir meets Baba's friend General Iqbal Taheri, formerly of the Ministry of Defense in Kabul, and his daughter Soraya, who is studying to be a teacher. Can you say, \"Love at first sight\"?\n\nBut Amir's romantic interests have to take the back seat when Baba is diagnosed with inoperable cancer and given not long to live. In short order, there's an engagement, a wedding and a funeral. Amir writes and sells his first novel. He and Soraya move into a nice house. The only negative in the equation is when they learn Soraya can not bear children. Even in vitro fertilization fails. They discuss adoption, but eventually decide against it. The stage is set for a major life shift.\n\nThat comes in June of 2001, when Amir receives a phone call from Baba's old friend Rahim Khan, who is ailing and urgently insists that the novelist fly to Pakistan. From Chapter Fourteen to Twenty-One, we follow Amir back to Peshwar, where Khan reveals events long kept secret, the biggest one being that Baba, not Ali, sired Hassan, making him Amir's half-brother. But there's more. Hassan married a Hazara girl named Farzana and they had a son called Sohrab. After Ali was killed by a land mine, Khan convinced Hassan to bring his family to Kabul and join him in maintaining Baba's old house.\n\nThings went well for a time, but one day when Khan was away, the Taliban came to Baba's old home, murdered Hassan and Farzana, and took Sohrab off to an orphanage. Khan, who knows the truth about Amir's boyhood cowardice and deceit, convinces the naturalized American to go to Kabul and bring his nephew back to Peshwar where an aid agency can arrange for a proper adoption. He tells Amir, \"There is a way to be good again.\"\n\nAmir travels to Kabul with a hired driver named Farid, who doesn't think much of Afghani refugees, especially those returning to sell old property and profit off it. But he becomes Amir's ffriend when he understands his true mission. The two revisit Amir's childhood haunts and find almost everything in ruins. Then, worst of all, the head of the orphanage where Sohrab was taken admits that a Taliban leader came by a month earlier and took the young boy to \"entertain\" him.\n\nIt takes some doing, but in Chapter Twenty-Two, Amir manages to meet this Taliban headman. And lo and behold, it turns out to be none other than his old nemesis Assef, who has little Sohrab made up in mascara and rouge dance for them, taunting Amir with his power. It was he who executed Hassan and his wife, and now he wants to settle the score with Amir, whose offer of money won't help him get out of this fix. Assef tells his guards to leave the room. Soon only one man will leave alive, and whoever it is can keep Sohrab.\n\nI must say, this is some pretty damn good stuff. Hosseini's writing sweeps you right along and it's hard to know what insanity might come next. In this case, Amir is badly overmatched. Assef beats him nearly to death, breaking ribs, pulverizing his face and strangling him. But shockingly, little Sohrab pulls out his slingshot and, using the skill his father taught him, puts out Assef's eye with a brass ball broken off from an ornamented table. The Taliban leader writhing on the floor in pain provides the opening the victims need to escape with Farid's help, although Amir is half dead and delirious with pain of his own.\n\nThe remaining three chapters detail Amir's convalesce in Peshwar, his bonding with Sohrab and decision to adopt him, their move to Islamabad, his long distance confession to Soraya regarding his past, and the diplomatic barriers to getting the boy a visa to the USA. Then, there's Sohrab's attempted suicide, narrowly averted. With help from Soraya's friend in the INS, they eventually get Sohrab to California on a humanitarian visa, which allows them to start the adoption process.\n\nBut Sohrab has stopped talking. He has sunk into silence, feeling betrayed by everyone and \"tired of everything.' Only after seven months in the United States is Amir able to break through to his nephew, and the mechanism by which that happens is perfectly appropriate -- kite flying at an Afghan festival. It's quite a journey, and so very well presented, I cringed to think of how difficult the highly emotional atmosphere would be to adapt to film.\n\n\"Look, I don't want to be intrusive. But, I just want to be there available on the sidelines if you need help.\" ~ Khaled Hosseini to director Marc Forster\n\nScriptwriter David Benioff and director Marc Forster had worked together on 2009's mystery thriller \"Stay,\" so their collaboration on this adaptation was probably as close to seamless as one can get. Author Hosseini was brought on board as \"a cultural advisor.\" In a 2007 interview, the novelist explained:\n\n\"I didn't write the screenplay. Dave Benioff did, but he and I talked throughout. He would e-mail me, and I would answer his questions. I had told him that I would support him through it. When he finished the screenplay, [the director and the producers] and myself read the screenplay. We all wrote some notes down and sent them back to David, who accepted them graciously and wrote another draft.\"\n\nBecause filming in war-torn Afghanistan was out of the question, locations in Western China were selected. As Housseini puts it, \"It was so similar to Afghanistan--architecturally, ethnically, culturally. And I served as adviser on issues of language, clothing, the rituals of getting married. At various points they would ask me questions, and I would chime in.\"\n\nOne major decision made by Forster was to have all the Afghani characters speak Dari (Farsi) in order \"to make the film as authentic as possible.\" As a result, this American production based upon an international bestseller in English became a foreign language film. What's more, as the director tells it, the scripted dialog written by Benioff became a guideline as \"the improvisation technique was common among the Afghan actors, many of whom weren't professional.\" Indeed, the scriptwriter has admitted, \"Uncle Saifo's lines in Dari are completely different from the English subtitles.\"\n\n\"Fuck the Russia!\" ~ Baba\n\nCredit must go to casting director Kate Dowd for creating such a workable ensemble of \"unknowns.\" Even Khalid Abdalla, who plays the lead as Amir, had only two screen credits coming into this project, and the most experienced actor on the set, Shaun Toub who plays Rahim Khan, had a much stronger background in television than film. French actor Saïd Taghmaoui took the role of the driver Farid; the part of Amir's wife Soraya was taken by Atossa Leoni in only her second big screen role; and Iranian actor Homayoun Ershadi as Baba was best-known for his Persian-language work, including \"Taste of Cherry\" (1997).\n\nAmong those making their debuts here were Nabi Tanha as Baba's friend and Hazara servant Ali; Homayoun Ershadi as Ali's son Hassan; Elham Ehsas as the young bully Assef; and Abdul Salam Yusoufzai as the adult Taliban leader Assef. Also first-timers were Ali Danish Bakhtyari as Hassan's son Sohrab, Mohamad Nabi Attai as Uncle Saifo the Kite Seller, and Abdul Qadir Farookh as Soraya's father General Taheri.\n\nForster uses flashbacks and flashes forward to present the story in much the same way as it is structured in the book. He does not, however, use a first-person narrator, which to my mind would have been a natural choice given the way the prose narrative is told almost exclusively from Amir's point-of view. Instead, we are left to infer what Amir is thinking and how he perceives the events unfolding around him.\n\nAlthough the film sticks pretty closely to the novel in terms of plot, some of the characterization was altered in ways that will be quite noticeable to readers. For example, to save on makeup costs, Hassan has no harelip, so Baba has no call to pay for an operation to correct it. Amir's cowardice is clear, but his youthful snobbery doesn't show up. Also, blond, fair-skinned Assef is portrayed as swarthy with black hair and no references are made to his German lineage or love of Nazis. Soraya's shameful teenage \"affair\" was with an Afghani, not a white American. And Baba seems to enjoy living in America a lot more here than he did in the book.\n\nTime constraints caused some parts to be truncated or left out, too. Examples include anything pre-1975, everything to do with garage sales, any concrete reference's to Hassan's mother, all of Hassan's adult life in Hazarajat, and Amir's long convalescence in Pakistan. But Forster obviously felt the kite-flying sequences were of major significance, so he gave them extra emphasis. And the rape scene in the alley after the kite-fighting competition gets full treatment, too, as it should, even if it offended many critics and viewers.\n\nScenes I thought were done especially well done were the pomegranate tree, the escape to Peshwar from Kabul, and Amir's wedding. Done less well were the stolen watch episode (it's not clear why Amir set Hassan up), the climactic fight with Assef (it's not clear that it was a contest to the death for the boy, not just a one-sided brawl), and Amir's brief revelation of the truth to Soraya, which comes before the Kabul trip, not after. And there is never any doubt that Amir will try to take Sohrab back to America.\n\nIndeed, as I feared, much of the emotional atmosphere has been drained from the story in a rather dry presentation of the events. Not a single relationship reaches the depth of the novel's. And perhaps the biggest surprise was the lack of any barriers to getting Sohrab into the United States, which eliminated the dramatic suicide attempt -- a shocking tearjerker in the book.\n\nNevertheless, at the Golden Globes the film was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, while Alberto Iglesias received a nomination for Best Original Score - Motion Picture. Iglesias also got nominated for an Oscar -- Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, Original Score. And three BAFTA nominations were received -- The Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music (Iglesias), Best Adapted Screenplay (Benioff) and Best Film Not in the English Language.\n\nI might add that although the film earned only $15.8 million in the United States against a budget of $20 million, worldwide revenues hit nearly $74.2 million thanks to strong box office receipts in the U.K., Brazil and the Philippines. By contrast, the book sold over seven million copies in the United States alone and was translated into 42 languages for publication in 38 countries. I'm afraid this is a case where, despite critical acclaim, the book is still head and shoulders better than the movie."
