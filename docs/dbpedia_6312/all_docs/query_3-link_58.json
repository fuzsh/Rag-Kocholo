        "text": "Our heartfelt wish is to document the essential character of the indigenous people in the region. Possibly because of our unremitting efforts, the world will fully appreciate the region and keep alive in their hearts and minds this beautiful and mysterious place. I really don’t want this film to be a record for prosperity when the region eventually becomes gobbled up by the trappings of modern civilization.\n\n希望我们尽可能记录下这个地区原住民的风貌。 也许由于我们的努力， 世人能够重视这个地区， 使这个美丽神秘的地方长存下去， 真不希望当这个地方被现代文明同化后， 这部影片成为永久的记录。\n\n–Tian Zhuangzhuang, A Director’s Handwritten Account of “The Ancient Tea Horse Road” Series, Delamu, A Film by Tian Zhuangzhuang, Beijing: Minzu Chubanshe, 2004, p. 3.\n\nDelamu, a documentary released in 2004, and directed by Tian Zhuangzhuang was never destined to find mass appeal at the box office, but it remains a hidden jewel, a snapshot of moments where even the mountains, rivers and skies tell their tales, varied and personal yet part of an interdependence, a tapestry of voices that bear witness to all of life’s comings and goings in this far flung region of the planet.\n\nThe documentary is set in the Nujiang River (Salween) Valley along the Tea Horse Road, which is not only tea and not a singular sweeping stretch of road or route between two or three points, but an intricate web of roads, paths and trails, including mountain steppes, low mountain valleys, a narrow pass or gorge, along which people, packed animals and goods travelled. These were routes crossed in stages and not just land but water as well. Land meets water, water meets land. They are very much knitted together. In this remote slice of geography, cargo crossed and continues to cross sections of the Salween and other waterways that have not always been connected by bridges.\n\nThis documentary captures my sensitivities, not just the jaw-dropping scenery, the deft panoramic gentleness of the images, but how people move across time and space and how this has been sustained by trade over the centuries; the long and shorter distances, and shorter still within a village to a nearby market or convenience store.\n\nThere is a commitment to landscape and on a no lesser plane the people, the storytelling. I counted eleven interviewees. The stories cover just a smidget of their lives and we are left to imagine the rest. The Christian pastor of the Lisu cultural group, for example, persecuted for his beliefs and sent away to hard labor for over fifteen years. A lively 104 year-old woman, blind, but still able to recount events of her life, including three KMT officials who each offered their hand in marriage but she ignored all of their advances. The hardships she endured throughout her life and the incessant weeping was of the kind that she recalls “would turn you blind.” We are also privy to a Tibetan man who became a monk but still misses his ex-girlfriend, a scene of a pack animal laid down to die after being crushed by falling rocks, and a Tibetan substitute teacher who likes watching gangster movies and aspires to remain single until true love arrives.\n\nLandscapes and oral storytelling in its rawest form, without the embellishments, absent of the histrionics, free of clogging detail, makes this documentary, so alive, so compelling. I would not call it “little more than a National Geographic style travelogue” as Richard Phillips wrote after the documentary was screened at the 52nd Sydney Film Festival in June 2005. Far more going on here than just the scenery Mr. Phillips.\n\nThe Chinese film historian Paul Clark wrote that Delamu “is the finest documentary China has produced in a 100 years of filmmaking.” And A.O. Scott in the New York Times, October 30, 2004:\n\nThe film’s pastoral rhythms and breathtaking landscapes immerse you in a way of life that seems almost unimaginably distant from the modern urban world. But like something by Satyajit Ray (or like ”The Blue Kite,” Mr. Tian’s splendidly lyrical fictional film), ”Delamu” has a universal resonance that lifts it beyond ethnographic observation.\n\nThe name of the documentary comes from a mule’s name given by a 34 year old Tibetan muleteer called Zheng Duo. Delamu literally means “peaceful goddess” or goddess/deity of peace.” I originally assumed that the mule was named after a Tibetan goddess, but after recent correspondence with Janet Gyatso, a religious studies scholar at the Harvard Divinity School, she wrote: “there is no such goddess [of peace] per se in traditional Tibetan religion that I know of.” An endearing name for a mule nonetheless. It reveals the intimate bond between muleteer and his pack animals.\n\nHis other mules are all given names. It is possible too that Delamu is a local deity among cultural groups in the Nujiang River Valley and a common name for a girl.\n\nThe entry for Delamu in Wikipedia translate it as “peaceful angel.” “Lamu” comes from the Tibetan “Lhamo” which means ” goddess.” “Angel” is misleading if not just blatantly incorrect.\n\nYou can watch the whole documentary on YouTube (no English subtitles):\n\nAs the Salween looms large in this post, I include two poems on the Salween by two Yunnan poets, Li Sen (b. 1966) and Yu Jian (b. 1954).\n\nFacing the Salween (Nujiang)\n\nLi Sen\n\nthe poet stands on the banks of the Salween\n\nblood-red skies at dusk\n\nonce again, he had to cross the river\n\nat moments like these, they say\n\nheroes must swim across, but so too the traitors\n\nonly the fainthearted are left to tremble in their steps\n\na bridge now spans the river\n\nthe epic poem complete\n\ndead both hero and traitor\n\nunder dusk’s blood-red skies\n\nthe poet a mere bystander\n\nlook, the poet still stands on the shores of the Salween\n\nand the skies still blood-red\n\nthe bridge, like a line\n\nsuddenly appears in a poem allowing him to swim across\n\nbut what really brings him closer to the surging waves\n\nis a metaphor of a water bird\n\na red-billed water bird swoops down to the river’s surface\n\npressing against cold shining waves\n\nfinally reaching rounded smooth pebbles\n\nrolled down to the river’s bed in the dark seduction of the night.\n\n–translated by peter micic\n\n面对怒江\n\n–李森\n\n诗人站在怒江的边上， 站在血色的黄昏\n\n有一次， 他要渡怒江\n\n据说在这样的时刻\n\n英雄是要泅渡叛徒也要泅渡\n\n只有懦夫， 才会发抖\n\n然而、 桥梁已经横跨江\n\n诗史已经写完\n\n英雄和叛徒也已经死去\n\n在这个血色的黄昏\n\n诗人只能做一个普通的路人\n\n看啊、 诗人还在怒江的岸上\n\n还是在那个血色的黄昏\n\n桥梁象一个诗句\n\n突然出现在一首诗中， 让他泅渡\n\n而真正使他亲近滚滚波涛的\n\n则是一只水鸟的比喻\n\n红嘴的水鸟、 一个俯冲到达江面\n\n贴着寒光闪闪的波涛飞行\n\n最后抵达圆石滚滚江底那个黑诱的夜里\n\n—–\n\nNujiang (The Salween)\n\nYu Jian\n\nthe empire’s great river, the Salween, flees to moonlight’s side\n\nrobed in leopard skin, dark steps steer away from the paths and trails\n\nlooking across the plateau\n\nchoosing borders, beyond its home\n\nthe smaller states, the poisonous flies\n\npassing other great rivers\n\nseparated by lofty mountains it heard them call father\n\nfar away from the metaphors and their endless images\n\nthis stranger of a river transcends our poems\n\nstones in the water now grains of sand\n\non the far western plateau\n\nfeeding into layers of soil or the tree roots.\n\n–translated by peter micic\n\n怒江\n\n于坚"
