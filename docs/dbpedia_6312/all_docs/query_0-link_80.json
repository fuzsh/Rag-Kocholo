        "text": "Censorship can be broadly defined as the suppression of knowledge or ideas. It is used by Governments or organizations to prevent the circulation of material. During wartime information about troop activities, future battles plans etc., were censored, while peacetime censorship was more problematic and controversial.\n\nIn the US with the coming of sound in 1927 there was a call for stricter censorship. The Production or Hays Code of film classification was introduced in 1934 to control the depiction of religious groups, foreign countries, foreigners, sexual and criminal activity, and any disgusting subjects. This held its power until the early 1950s. In 1968 a classification system was established that all Hollywood movies adhere to on a voluntary basis. It is run by the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America).In Britain, have the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification). This also classifies films and certifies accordingly for the public distribution.\n\nBut there is significant question to be asked is censorship necessary?\n\nEffects of media on the audience should be considered seriously when it focuses issues of violence, sex etc. For example, in laboratory conditions children have been shown violent film clips and then their behavior has been monitored afterwards to see if they act more aggressively than a control group that has not been shown violent films. Content Analysis has also been employed to count the number of acts of violence, violent language and related actions in a specific film. A high budget film would rate the movie inspiring aggressive reactions than a low budget film. Polls and surveys, and test screenings are another means of determining how an audience responds to a film.\n\nOn an informal basis we employ individual and collective censorship. As an artist/ film maker we might never want to make a film that would feature a subject repugnant to ourselves or we might meet resistance from financial backers if we did try to make such a film. The commercial basis of film making and the need for box office success can dictate and censor the type of films than can or cannot be made.\n\nFor example, after a terrorist outrage 9/11, film makers avoided making films that touched on this topic. During 1950 and 1960s the permissive society broke down many traditional barriers and previously taboo topics became the subject of films. Violence and nudity became more graphic.\n\nInvention of new technology is the new problems facing film censorship. The perfection of special effects especially with the introduction of digital technology in the early 1990s means that all forms of graphic violence can be depicted. Furthermore, the technological means of delivering films to an audience has evolved. Video technology of the 1980s brought about the fears of video nastiest being viewed in the home. Similarly video games portraying graphic violence and scenarios have created equally powerful panics. Currently the Internet has prompted fears about the easy distribution of uncensored films and other visual material to people in their homes.\n\nFilms Banned\n\nIndia\n\n1959 – Neel Akasher Neechey was banned for two years for overt political overtones; it showed the troubles faced by an immigrant Chinese wage laborer in 1930s Calcutta\n\n1963 – Nine Hours to Rama was banned for depicting the psychological motivations of Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n1970 – Kissa Kursi Ka was banned for political reasons\n\n1971 – Sikkim was banned for showing Chogyal-ruled Sikkim as a sovereign state.The ban was lifted in September 2010.\n\n1984 – Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was banned for its “racist portrayal of Indians and overt imperialistic tendencies.\n\n1991 – Kutrapathirikkai was banned for 15 years for portraying the events that followed Rajiv Gandhi’s death.

Saving Private Ryan\n\nIRAQ\n\n1.RAMBO\n\n2.Saving Private Ryan\n\n3.The Kingdom.\n\n4.SAW\n\nPeople’s Republic of China\n\n1959: Ben-Hur, for containing “propaganda of superstitious beliefs, namely Christianity.” (Never given permission to screen)\n\n1993: The Blue Kite, a Chinese film that was not only banned, but deemed so offensive that director Tian Zhuangzhuang received a 10-year ban from making films. It won the Grand Prix at the Tokyo International Film Festival, and Best Film at the Hawaii International Film Festival.\n\n1993: Farewell My Concubine, a Chinese film that won the Cannes Film Festival Palme d’Or, was banned due to homosexual themes and negative portrayal of communism.\n\n1997: Frozen (Pinyin: Jídù hánleng) is directed by Wang Xiaoshuai. The film was originally shot in 1994, but was banned by Chinese authorities and had to be smuggled out of the country.\n\n2005: Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life, for its unflattering depictions of Chinese society (never given permission to screen.\n\n2006: Scorsese’s The Departed, for suggesting that the government intends to use nuclear weapons on Taiwan (a sensitive political issue – never given permission to screen.\n\n2007: Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End was banned because (according to Xinhua, the state news agency of the People’s Republic of China) 10 minutes of footage containing Chow Yun-fat’s portrayal of Singaporean pirate Sao Feng have been trimmed from versions of the film which may be shown in China. Chow is onscreen for 20 minutes in the uncensored theatrical release of the film. No official reason for the censorship was given, but unofficial sources within China have indicated that the character offered a negative and stereotypical portrayal of the Chinese people.\n\n2010: Avatar, 2D versions were banned on January 23 because it was thought that its themes may lead audiences to think about forced removal, and may possibly incite violence\n\n2011: In April 2011, several news sources reported that the Chinese Government had “banned” time travel “films”.[45][46] However, the original article in the New York Times stated that guidelines published on March 31, 2011 by the State Administration for Radio, Film & Television discouraged television dramas that showed characters traveling back in time.\n\nDirector Jia Zhangke, Chinese filmmaker had to abandon one film lest it broke anti-pornography laws. Then he ditched a spy movie rather than fill it with Communist party “superheroes”. The frustration of making films in a country with “cultural over-cleanliness” has led an internationally acclaimed Chinese director to lash out at its censors, a state news site has reported. Jia Zhangke won the Golden Lion at the Venice film festival in 2006 – apparently earning the approval of China’s leader-in-waiting Xi Jinping, who is expected to become president next year.\n\nBut he began his career as an “underground” film-maker – directing movies that were praised abroad but never saw official release in China – and he complained of ongoing battles with censors as he addressed a cultural forum in Shanghai. Unusually, his remarks were reported by an official news sites. He said that the only reason that we cannot make genere movies is the barrier censorship creates. He said he scrapped a film about a man’s sex life after an official decided it might break anti-pornography laws. He also abandoned a spy film about the Communist party and Kuomintang due to controls. He said that if he wants to make a movie in his country, he has to portray all communists as” super heroes”. Here the creativity of a director is questioned? .This breaks the original idea of the story and makes it difficult to develop the story.\n\nChina has a vast censorship apparatus, but films and television programmes are particularly tightly controlled. One film director told the Guardian that censors demanded 400 changes before they would pass his movie. Hong Kong director and producer Manfred Wong told the Shanghai forum that in crime movies made on the mainland all police officers must be portrayed as good guys, while romantic movies cannot show affairs or cohabitation before marriage. He argued that mainland film-makers need a ratings system. Some believe the government might relax constraints if age restrictions were introduced. But Li Hongyu, who writes about film for Southern Weekly newspaper, said it was simplistic to suggest a ratings system would result in less censorship.\n\nWhile western ratings systems focus on issues such as violence and pornography, China has much wider concerns about the content of films, he said.”China’s control over movies is more detailed. China has a movie censoring committee composed of approximately 30 or so staff whose backgrounds are very diverse, spanning from movie professionals, the Women’s Federation, the [Communist] Youth League, teachers, and a religious committee to various governmental administration departments,” Li added.\n\n“The debate about introducing a ratings system has been going on for many years. But it is hard to implement, since if the system is used, it will not be easy to cover the government’s other considerations. What if it is concerned about political views?”\n\nOfficial requirements, which concern the moral as well as political qualities of content, can be baffling to outsiders: the head of the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television recently denounced TV time travel dramas for their “frivolous” approach to history.\n\nThere are many movies which are badly censored or muted. The audience watching the film finds difficult to read what the movie wanted to convey. The movie named ‘The Departed’ was one among them. The film was censored because having the usage of bad language content. Many film directors call censorship as ‘cancer’. Therefore censorship boards should be strict, not by killing the creativity of the directors and also should mould the country by breaking the barriers in the society"
