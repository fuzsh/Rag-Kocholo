It is Snyder's first film based on an original concept. The film stars Emily Browning as \"Babydoll\", a young woman who is committed to a mental institution and copes by envisioning it as a brothel. She teams up with four dancers/prisoners to escape before her scheduled lobotomy. As she collects the items she needs to escape, she enters another level of fantasy in which the women become strong, experienced warriors. Each fantasy is a parallel to the events in the brothel. Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, and Jamie Chung portray the four prisoners whom Babydoll imagines as dancers. Carla Gugino plays Dr. Vera Gorski, a psychiatrist whom Babydoll imagines as Madame Gorski, a choreographer at the strip club. Oscar Isaac plays Blue Jones, the asylum's orderly; in Babydoll's mind he's the brothel's corrupt owner.\n\n2010s English-language films · 5,184T\n\nFilms scored by Marius de Vries · 10T\n\nAmerican fantasy action films · 59T\n\nThe Temptations 1998 television miniseries by Allan Arkush\n\n0 0\n\nGenre: Drama, Music, Biography\n\nDirector: Allan Arkush\n\nBiography of the singers who formed the hit Motown musical act, The Temptations. more »\n\nrank #3 · 4 1\n\nThe Temptations is a four-hour television miniseries broadcast in two-hour halves on NBC, based upon the history of one of Motown's longest-lived acts, The Temptations.
