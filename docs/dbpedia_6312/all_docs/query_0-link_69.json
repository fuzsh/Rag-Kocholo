        "text": "Looking at a list of banned and censored films provides some insight into the perceived influence of films on society, especially when you look at the reasoning behind censorship: Some films get banned for violence and nudity, others might upset powerful individuals and others get banned for bizarre reasons. As you'd expect the more authoritarian governments are more ban-happy than others, but you'd be surprised at some of the innocuous-looking movies that were censored in various countries over the decades:\n\nChemi Bebia (1929):\n\nAlso known as \"My Grandmother\", the avant-garde silent comedy from Georgia was banned until its restoration and rerelease in 1976. The surreal and inventive satire on the inefficient Soviet bureaucratic machine that promotes idleness and endless paperwork did not go down well with the censors, neither did slogans such as \"Death to Red Tape\" and \"Death to Bureaucracy\".\n\nThe Skeleton Dance (1930):\n\nWalt Disney's animated short was banned in Denmark. According to censors: \"The Danish public must not be allowed to see one of Mr. Disney's silly symphony films which show dancing skeletons in a graveyard. The topic, in the censor's opinion, is too macabre to put on the screen.\"\n\nMonkey Business (1931):\n\nIreland did not appreciate the subversive humour of the Marx Brothers, not only did the Irish censors cut a dozen scenes from \"Horse Feathers\" they outright banned their 1931 movie for fear it would \"provoke the Irish to anarchy\". \"A Night at the Opera\" ran into censorship difficulties in Latvia while all the Marx Brothers movies were banned in Nazi Germany because of their Jewish background (Groucho would get his revenge on Hitler).\n\nThe Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail (1945):\n\nIn the 1930s and early 40s the Japanese Government insisted on movies carrying a patriotic message to further the war effort and promote nationalism. Akira Kurosawa's 4th film about a disgraced feudal lord and his retinue disguising themselves as monks to cross a border was hated by the Japanese censors, they were on the verge of banning it for \"failing to promote Japanese values\" until the Japanese surrender passed censorship duties onto the Americans, who banned the film for being too feudal and ironically \"promoting old-fashioned Japanese values\". The ban was lifted in 1952 when American occupation of Japan ended.\n\nRififi (1955):\n\nJules Dassin moved to France after being blacklisted in Hollywood for his communistic leanings, he directed the classic heist film \"Rififi\", with its wordless 30-minute heist sequence inspiring copycat crimes in Mexico, prompting its removal from movie theatres. The movie was also banned in Finland for 5 years.\n\nPhantom of the Opera (1925):\n\nDeemed too horrifying for audiences, the Universal horror movie was banned for 5 years, a sound version of the movie passed the censors in 1930. Presumably the unmasking of Lon Chaney's Phantom was too graphic for audiences.\n\nThe Great Dictator (1940):\n\nChaplin's satire of a failed art student was unsurprisingly banned in Nazi Germany and all countries occupied by the Nazis, it was also banned in Ireland, Paraguay and Brazil where it was accused of being communist and \"destabilising the Armed Forces. Argentina's military dictatorship arrived to the banning party in 1976.\n\nLe Corbeau (1943):\n\nIn the aftermath of the Liberation old scores had to be settled, one film made under the German company Continental Films (set up during the Occupation) was banned for 20 years: the storyline of poison pen letters tearing a small french town apart was considered anti-French. Its director Henri-Georges Clouzot was banned from filmmaking for 2 years.\n\nReport on the Party and Guests (1966):\n\nA group of bourgeois friends are having a picnic in the forest, it's a beautiful day everything's going well. Suddenly a group of serious looking men coerce them into following their orders, the implied threat of force enough to make the bourgeois friends comply. Banned in Czechoslovakia for its unsubtle critique of the Communist party even before the Prague Spring.\n\nChung Kuo, Cina (1972):\n\nItalian director Michelangelo Antonioni was invited to China to make a documentary, visiting Beijing, Suzhou, Nanjing and Shanghai. After seeing the 3 hour cut Chairman Mao banned the documentary for being \"Anti-Chinese\", the ban was lifted in 2004.\n\nLa Grande Illusion (1937):\n\nWhen FDR first saw Jean Renoir's anti-war film he declared \"every democratic person should see this film\"; after winning awards in New York and Venice Joseph Goebbels banned the film in Nazi Germany, declared it \"Cinematic Public Enemy No. 1\" and ordered all prints confiscated and destroyed. The original negative was believed to have been destroyed in an Allied air raid in 1942 but a German film archivist and Nazi officer smuggled the negative into Berlin in 1945. It was shipped to Moscow before returning to a film archive in Toulouse in 1960, where it remained for 30 years before it was identified as the original negative.\n\nBrief Encounter (1946):\n\nDavid Lean's classic tale of an extra-marital affair on the eve of WW II may have won the Palme d'Or at Cannes but it wasn't looked upon kindly in Ireland, initially getting banned for being \"too permissive of adultery\".\n\nThe King & I (1956):\n\nThe first movie adaptation of Rogers & Hammerstein's broadway musical won 5 Oscars and became Yul Brynner's signature role. In Thailand the movie was banned for its historical innacuracies and perceived disrepect to the monarchy; the 1999 film version \"Anna and the King\" suffered the same fate in Thailand.\n\nViridiana (1961):\n\nLuis Bunuel had been in virtual exile from his native Spain since the 30s, largely working in Mexico to resurrect his career. The next generation of Spanish directors persuaded him to return home and make a film there, Bunuel the surrealist and provocateur could not help himself. A young nun on the verge of taking her vows visits her widowed uncle where her worldview is changed forever. The film's script was initially approved by Spanish authorities but once they saw the finished film at Cannes it was banned until 1977 (after Franco's death) and denounced by the Vatican, particularly the scene of beggars re-enacting the Last Supper.\n\nThe Hand (1965):\n\nCzech animator Jiri Trnka's final work told the story of an artistic harlequin forced by a giant Hand into making whatever the Hand decides. The obvious allegory for totalitarianism ensured the film was banned after Trnka's death in 1969 until the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nHaxan (1922):\n\nHaving spent two years studying medieval manuscripts on witchcraft, Benjamin Christensen directed a part-narrative, part-documentary on witchcraft throughout the ages, a 9 month shoot followed by 1 year of post-production ensured it became the most expensive Scandinavian silent film. Censors in Germany and France were horrified by scenes of torture and nudity, in the US it was banned for anti-clericalism and alleged Satanic content.\n\nBattleship Potemkin (1925):\n\nSergei Eisenstein's legendary silent film was unsurprisingly banned in several European countries for fear of inciting a Communist revolution:\n\nGermany lifted their ban after WW II; Finland, France and the UK waited for Stalin's death to unban the film, Spain had to wait for Franco's death to lift the ban.\n\nThe Witness (1969):\n\nBanned for a decade in Hungary before becoming a cult classic, it satirises the post-WW II communist regime in the early 50s. An ordinary dike-keeper named Pelikan gets arrested for slaughtering a pig for food, but his new benefactor Comrade Virag gives him lots of cushy assignments instead (Pelikan fails every assignment spectacularly). As the International situation intensifies, Virag becomes more paranoid and Pelikan eventually has to testify against a former friend in a show-trial.\n\nPixote (1981):\n\nOne of the bleakest depictions of childhood on film, following several young boys as they navigate life in youth detention centre and on the streets of Sao Paulo, one by one leaving the film until Pixote (Leandro Ramos da Silva) becomes the main character. As art imitates life, the film's international success made the lead actor an overnight star, but he slipped back into a life of street crime and was gunned down in a Police shoot out in 1987, three months short of his 20th birthday. Banned in Chile during the Pinochet years, the film's original opening scene wasn't included in the recent restoration for some reason.\n\nThe Blue Kite (1993):\n\nTian Zhuangzhuang had gotten into previous trouble with Chinese censors over his films, \"The Blue Kite\" earned him international success and a domestic ban. Set in 1953 as Stalin's death is announced to a Beijing family, the film follows the family's travails over the next decade as Mao's cultural revolution and Great Leap Forward kick in. The film was banned in mainland China for criticising Government policies and the director was banned from making movies for 2 years.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front (1930):\n\nErich Maria Remarque's famous novel received the Hollywood treatment to critical success and a fair bit of controversy, detailing the horrors of WW I in the German Army. Unsurprisingly the movie was banned in Germany in 1930 and then again by the Nazis in 1933 for being anti-German, ironically in Poland the movie was banned for being too pro-German. Austria, Italy, France and Australia also joined the ban-wagon.\n\nBattle of Algiers (1966):\n\nDocumenting the Algerian War of Independence through black-and-white newsreel-style footage, showing the French and Algerian side of the war just 4 years after Algeria gained independence virtually guaranteed a ban from France for its anti-colonialist message and perceived pro-Algerian bias. The ban was lifted in 1971.\n\nThe Cow (1969):\n\nThe Shah's government weren't impressed by the finished film they had financed, the rural setting made the country look backwards and poor so they banned the film for a year and denied an export permit. The movie was eventually released domestically with a disclaimer stating the events in the film took place in the past to avoid making the current look bad. The movie was smuggled out of the country to the Venice Film Festival (without subtitles) where it won top prize, temporarily placing Iran on the cinematic map before the Revolution. Based on a play about a villager's love for his cow, when the cow dies during his absence the rest of the village fear he'll lose his mind.\n\nThe Tin Drum (1979):\n\nGunther Grass' novel about a young dwarf living in Nazi Germany banging his tin drum won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and a Best Foreign Film Oscar. Featuring a great child performance from David Bennent, fantasy elements and lots of disturbing imagery, one infamous scene featuring then-11 year old Bennent and Katharina Thalbach (24 at the time) saw the film banned as child ....ography in Ontario and Oklahoma, a court decision in the latter state overturned the ban.\n\nFarewell my Concubine (1993):\n\nTwo boys undergo a harsh and cruel training regime in a Peking Opera school in 1924, the film charts their friendship over several decades and almost 3 hours. Becoming the first Chinese-language movie to win the Palme d'Or it was briefly banned in China before international outcry and the fear of hurting China's bid for the 2000 Olympics saw a censored version released in China. The censors objected to scenes of political violence during the Cultural Revolution and a homosexual main character.\n\nEspecially in the US, also interesting to look at movies where scenes or plots were censored or negotiated over. The supposed industry association \"standards board\" for all practical purposes was a censor (The Hays Code). I think of war movies in particular, where the studios needed the cooperation of the government to film realistic scenes. One movie that comes to mind is \"From Here to Eternity.\"\n\nAlthough the interesting article below mentions \"From Here to Eternity\", it doesn't mention what I had in mind - the removal of the Company Commander for being a bad officer.\n\nThe Hays Code / Useful Notes - TV Tropes\n\nlighter, but pervasive\n\nAn obvious example would be the ... side of life.\n\nBut regarding WWII, has there ever been a film which really slammed either Ford Motor Co. or GM, or IBM for that matter, for what really looks like collaborating with the Nazis?\n\nAnd sometimes a quick comment by a character or poking fun at the big bad corporation is more effective than a bunch of ponderous plot.\n\nBut in either case, to the best of my knowledge, the answer is No. There is no such movie or scene.\n\nHad to laugh at Brief Encounter being banned. I may not have been paying attention but as far as I could see nothing happened at all!\n\nOther ones springing to mind:\n\nA Clockwork Orange\n\nLife of Brian\n\nThe Exorcist\n\nIn the US, the film \"The Outlaw\" with Jayne Russell was either banned or cut because of one scene, I think./ Not sure if the banned bits are in the scenes below, but they'll give you an idea.\n\nTrivia: A Howard Hughes film . Legend has it the Hughes designed a bra for her, using aeronautical principles. At the time, some considered Jane Russell the most beautiful woman in the world. For me it was Elizabeth Taylor. The difference was that Jane had what we used to call \"bedroom eyes\", and she would look straight at camera. (IE at YOU)\n\nOh, the film is available free on YouTube."
