        "text": "Disregarding the fact that the film is divided into three chapters, three phases of China's history in the 20th-century which are the Rectification Movement, the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, each phase bringing about massive and sudden change to families that rectify and contradict each other, condemning beliefs and systems that came just before,\n\ndisregarding that each chapter is also marked by containing a different father for our main mother and child as each phase tears the father away, each phase bringing about these new ideologies which separate families from each other for reasons that are ultimately short-lived and short-sighted in retrospect, ideologies which force citizens upon other citizens and destroy any sense of institutional memory, taking advantage…\n\nThe Chinese government comprehended the undertaking from Tian Zhuangzhuang’s The Blue Kite in depicting the experiences of a vast percentage of the population during the cataclysmic Hundred Flowers Campaign, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution as political condemnation, and the authorities immediately banned it upon completion and inflicted a ten-year filmmaking embargo on the director. It features a narrative which is divided into three parts with each of these linked to the whims of the Communist doctrines of Mao Zedong.\n\nThe film takes hold of the feelings of frustration faced by the working class, whose existence was shattered by erratic and incendiary political conditions. Tian Zhuangzhuang shows meticulous attention to detail, and although the story is from the…\n\nIt's actually quite a badge of honor to be the first work from fifth-generation Chinese directors to be banned by the Chinese government, though it did land director Tian Zhuangzhuang an 8-year ban on filmmaking in China.\n\nAs the OG Chinese scar literature adaptation, The Blue Kite is a cruel, heartbreaking, and daunting experience, documenting the lives of a regular family caught in decades of political turmoils. Blue kites here are obviously a metaphor for childhood innocence, which was unfortunately tainted and ruined by the cruelty of a manic adult world. Divided into 3 chapters, each chronicles one major political event during those turbulent years, and each sees the traumas of the family piling up.\n\nFor the most part, this…\n\nBecoming fixated on fifth generation Chinese cinema is a blessing and a curse.\n\nOn the one hand, each film I've absorbed has amazed me with dazzling visuals, economic shot design, restrained performances, miraculous scale, depth, subtlety, and generally breathtaking bravery on the part of the filmmakers.\n\nOn the other hand, each story seems more depressing than the last.\n\nFifth generation cinema often revolves around a family's ultimate destruction at the hands of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.\n\nBut worst of all, these stunning films are almost universally unavailable in a format worthy of their cinematic quality. The DVDs I've acquired through my local dealer of foreign art house flicks are atrocious transfers of vhs tapes and worn…\n\nBanned by its own country for almost a decade and considered among the greatest archivements of the China's Fifth Generation filmmaking along with Zhang Yimou's To Live and Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine. I've personally never seen \"To Live,\" but I can say \"Farewell...\" has the better acting and its technically better.\n\nNonetheless, this film -which chronicles the life of a family throughout three of the majors events in China, the Hundred Flowers Campaign, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution- has some great things to love about it. Story wise I love how it shows the mindset of the people living during these times, how they could've easily gone from big fanatics to completely go against the movement.…\n\nOriginally wasn’t gonna finish, since I watched halfway with niko and we put on clerks 2 instead. But before i decided to sleep, i finished an essay and i’m like fuck it, i’ll finish this.\n\nNot gonna go in depth, since my brain and mood is at meme and shitpost level. But I’ll give a little bit of my mind here. As a Chinese person, who knows about the history of China after it’s civil war. It’s definitely nice knowing this isn’t some fabricated or sugar coated ccp bullshit. There’s a scene in the second chapter where a women gets her steamed buns taken away, cause it was the Great Leap Forward, in which chairman mao had many Chinese citizens…\n\nOne of the great pieces of Chinese cinema, but also one of the most tragic - just in terms of historical context and considering the circumstances surrounding director Tian Zhuangzhuang following its release. Tian Zhuangzhuang was banned from making movies upon the opening of The Blue Kite by the mainland Chinese government, and it feels almost impossible to find a copy of the film around, making its survival feel like something of a miracle.\n\nIt's a film that feels structured akin to an epic, with each chapter representing a different patriarch within the family all having different ideologies. When taking into account the historical content of the film, The Blue Kite engages with three crucial points in Chinese history: the…\n\nIn a local bookstore recently, I saw another one of those \"banned book\" sections. The store was asking customers to read books banned at some point, perhaps by some local podunk library in Nowheresville, perhaps by gigantic governments who don't like their eyes poked. Most of them did indeed seem mundane.\n\nThat led me to think that I had never yet seen a \"watch banned movies\" campaign. They never had them in Blockbusters, and they don't seem to have those sections on streaming services. I presume that, if they did, they'd be a bizarre mix of gross-out pornos, snuff films, and high-art cinema from and about harsh regimes.\n\n\"The Blue Kite\" falls in the last category. It's an on-the-ground portrait…"
