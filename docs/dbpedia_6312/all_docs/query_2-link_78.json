        "text": "For a 2016 film display I was asked to identify feminist films made in the 1960s. As I began my investigation I realized there were very few such items from the Hollywood studios, at least those with overt feminist leanings. This seemed odd in light of what transpired on-screen and off during that decade of turmoil. Societal protests were at their peak during the Vietnam war years. Among the protesters were women seeking equal rights and peace. However, their protests came late in the 60s and in the early 70s: the Miss America Protest (September 1968), the New York Abortion Speakout (March 1969), the Ladies’ Home Journal Sit-In (March 1970), and the Women’s Strike for Peace and Equality (August 1970).\n\nLikewise, the feminist-oriented movie did not gather steam until the 1970s, with such films as Diary of a Mad Housewife (1970), Puzzle of a Downfall Child (1970), Play It As It Lays (1972), A Woman Under the Influence (1974), Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974), and An Unmarried Woman (1978). In a backwards, anti-feminist or possibly satirical way, 1975’s The Stepford Wives might deserve inclusion.\n\nPerhaps we can surmise that there were some 1960s films with a feminist subtext: The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964), The Ballad of Josie (1967), Rachel, Rachel (1968), The Happy Ending (1969), and Sweet Charity (1969). Molly Brown might be ignored on the grounds that it appeared before the Vietnam conflict became a quagmire, with the resulting minority, student, and women’s protests.\n\nThe Ballad of Josie was on the cusp of the revolution. In the guise of a western, this was Doris Day’s fourth from last film. She played a woman who accidentally kills her husband and is put on trial. Acquitted, she nevertheless fuels male anger by herding sheep, not cattle, and launching a women’s suffrage movement.\n\nThe following year, Rachel, Rachel starred Joanne Woodward as an increasingly dissatisfied small-town school teacher living with her belittling mother. During the summer break, Rachel has a fling with a former classmate, attends a revival meeting, and rebuffs her friend Calla’s possibly amorous advances. In the end she plans to leave Connecticut, with or without her mother, for a new life in Oregon. Her husband Paul Newman directed Woodward to an Academy Award nomination, and the film received a Best Picture nomination as well.\n\nThe Happy Ending (1969) was the story of a marriage gone south. Mary, a disillusioned and alcoholic wife of 16 years (Jean Simmons, who received an Academy Award nomination) flees her home and husband (John Forsythe) for the Bahamas. On the way she meets her old friend Flo (Shirley Jones), who decides to chaperone her. In Nassau Mary meets Franco, who believes she is rich and exits when he finds she is anything but. Mary recalls her husband’s philandering, her overdose and hospital stay, and ensuing drinking binges. Returning home, she moves out of the house and takes university night courses. Husband Fred (John Forsythe) finds her and wonders what went wrong with their marriage.\n\nAt first glance, 1969’s Sweet Charity seems an unlikely candidate for prime feminist film of the decade. It’s a big, splashy musical based on the stage play which was itself spawned by Italian director Federico Fellini’s Nights of Cabiria (1957). Shirley MacLaine plays Charity Hope Valentine, a so-called dancehall hostess, code for prostitute, a term never used in the movie that tried to have it both ways: musical for everybody, pseudo-cutting edge social commentary for others. After the disappointing roadshow release, the newspaper ads for the general release promoted the salacious nature of the characters: “When she’s good, she’s very very good…but when she’s bad…she’s great!” and “They dig the way they live!” and “Swingers All…Men Were Their Business.”\n\nI saw Sweet Charity for the first time as a reserved seat engagement at the Stanley Theater in Philadelphia. I was surrounded by middle-aged women with Wanamaker bags outraged by the ostensible sacrilegious nature of Sammy Davis, Jr.’s “Rhythm of Life,” sung in a parking garage to his hippie acolytes. Maybe negative word of mouth from this audience segment was a another reason for the movie’s less than sterling grosses despite the glowing Variety review and immense hoopla of the televised premiere which many celebrities attended, including Gregory Peck and Ronald Reagan. (The others were the huge production cost and an audience possibly weary of giant musicals despite the great success of the previous year’s Oliver!)\n\nSo how was Charity Hope Valentine, who wore a “Charlie” tattoo on her shoulder and kowtowed to men until the film’s finale, a feminist symbol? A good but super straight Joe, Oscar (John McMartin), almost “saves” her but eventually can’t deal with her past and her floozy girlfriends. She tries to assuage his fears, but he retorts that he’ll destroy her. In a heartbreaking response, she says, “But that’s okay. I’m not doing much now anyway.” In the end she is where she was at the beginning: in Central Park, alone. Awakened on a bench by several “flower children” (including Bud Cort of the forthcoming Harold and Maude) who present her with a daisy and proclaim “Love,” she perks up. She smiles at the new day, the pigeons overhead, and an aged couple on a bench. Swinging her purse and shabby suitcase, she leaves the park to rejoin the human race, at peace with herself. Scrawled across the screen: AND SHE LIVED HOPEFULLY EVER AFTER.\n\nBy Kim"
