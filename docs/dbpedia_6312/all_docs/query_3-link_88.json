        "text": "Over the last month I’ve been conducting a survey of over 78,000 email subscribers trying to figure out the movie preferences of each of the 16 Myers-Briggs personality types. I wanted to know what kinds of movies each type loved, who watched the most or least movies, and what characters resonated with them the most.\n\nToday I’m taking a look at the movies that INTPs voted for again and again as their favorite. I don’t know about you, but the amount of time my husband and I find ourselves scrolling through Netflix trying to find something to watch is a little bit embarrassing. Let’s make movie night easier!\n\nIf you’re an INTP and you have a suggestion that isn’t on this list, be sure to let me know! I’d love to add more or hear your perspectives on the choices here.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\nNot sure what your personality type is? Take our personality questionnaire here. Or you can take the official MBTI® here.\n\nThe Top 35 Favorite INTP Movies\n\n1. Inception (2010)\n\nIt’s really no surprise to see Inception on this list. What intuitive wouldn’t like a movie that’s all about exploring the power and complexity of dreams? This Christopher Nolan film is a masterful blend of sci-fi and psychological thriller. INTPs and INTJs alike will enjoy this cerebral maze that challenges perceptions of reality. INTPs in particular will revel in the layers of complexity and the philosophical questions it provokes.\n\n2. The Matrix (1999)\n\nRedefining action and sci-fi, The Matrix offers a mind-bending exploration of reality, freedom, and control. I’m pretty sure Neo is an INTP, but ISTP is also possible. Either way, The Matrix is all about looking for the truth, even if it means opening your eyes to a disturbing new reality. This is something that INTPs search for on a daily basis. This movie’s intricate plot and philosophical underpinnings are a playground for INTP minds.\n\n3. Lord of the Rings Trilogy (2001-2003)\n\nI mean, how can Lord of the Rings not be on the list? That would just be wrong. This movie has adventure, lore, fantasy, drama, comedy, action, horror, and even philosophical themes all rolled into one epic trilogy. INTPs will appreciate the lush world-building and complex characters, not to mention the philosophical themes of good vs evil and free will vs fate.\n\n4. Alien (1979)\n\nFor those who lean towards the thrill of science fiction blended with horror, Alien stands out as a must-watch. This movie got so many votes, and I’m ashamed to say I’ve never even seen it. It unfolds on the commercial space tug Nostromo, whose crew encounters a deadly alien lifeform. The movie masterfully builds tension and terror, culminating in a fight for survival. The movie’s rich atmosphere and deep themes of isolation, the unknown, and the nature of humanity offer plenty of material for an INTP to ponder long after the credits roll.\n\n5. Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979)\n\nAnything Monty Python seems to appeal to NTPs. I’d hazard to guess that the Monty Python comedy troupe was largely composed of NTPs. The “Prodigy” personality types, with their penchant for quirky humor will find Life of Brian’s satirical take on religion and society both hilarious and thought-provoking. The randomness, creativity, and cleverness of this movie makes it a must-watch.\n\n6. In Bruges (2008)\n\nI’m a huge Martin McDonagh fan, and In Bruges is one of his greatest works. Darkly comic and philosophically rich, In Bruges tells the story of two hitmen hiding out in the Belgian city of Bruges. The movie balances humor and drama, action and introspection, making it a perfect fit for INTPs who enjoy a mix of genres. Plus, the witty dialogue and themes of morality, redemption, and fate will definitely speak to their intellectual side.\n\n7. Wall-E (2008)\n\nWall-E is a movie I’ve probably seen about 100 times considering two of my children (and myself) were obsessed with it. I was happy to see how many votes it got from INTPs and would encourage anyone who thinks they wouldn’t enjoy it because it’s a “kids” movie to think again. Wall-E tells the story of a post-apocalyptic Earth where the human race has abandoned the planet and left behind robots to clean up the mess. The movie is a beautiful blend of romance, sci-fi, adventure, and social commentary that will definitely resonate with INTPs.\n\n8. Dr. Strangelove (1964)\n\nStanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a masterclass in satire, cleverly critiquing the absurdities of the Cold War and the concept of nuclear deterrence. This film, with its sharp wit, unforgettable characters, and dark humor, hilariously exposes the flaws in political and military systems. INTPs will be drawn to its intellectual humor and the way it stimulates deep thought about serious global issues.\n\n9. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966)\n\nA classic western that I think both INTPs and ISTPs would love, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly offers a gritty exploration of morality and human nature, set against a backdrop of compelling visuals and unforgettable music.\n\n10. Snowpiercer (2013)\n\nA visually stunning film, Snowpiercer presents a dystopian future that asks deep questions about society, class, and survival, all while taking the viewer on a gripping, fast-paced adventure through different train cars. INTPs will appreciate the complex characters, thought-provoking themes, and inventive storyline of this underappreciated gem\n\n11. The Lobster (2015)\n\nThe Lobster gives us a quirky exploration into the complexities of relationships and societal expectations. In this dystopian society, single people are taken to The Hotel, where they must find a romantic partner in 45 days or be turned into an animal of their choice. The film’s dark humor, coupled with its critique of conventional relationships, makes it a fascinating watch.\n\n12. Gattaca (1997)\n\nGattaca was one of my favorite movies as a teen and I think it’s a movie that more people need to rediscover in 2024. It provides a thought-provoking view on future society, genetics, and the concept of destiny versus free will. Its thought-provoking narrative and ethical questions make it a captivating watch for INTPs.\n\n13. The Usual Suspects (1995)\n\nThe Usual Suspects kicks off with a seemingly simple premise — five criminals brought together in a lineup — and evolves into a story that challenges the viewer’s perception of truth and deception. INTPs will enjoy trying to untangle the web of lies and predict the outcomes, enjoying the mental exercise the film provides.\n\n14. Anatomy of a Murder (1959)\n\nAnatomy of a Murder is a gripping courtroom drama that examines the nuances of the legal process, ethics, and human psychology. Directed by Otto Preminger, this film is renowned for its intelligent screenplay, character depth, and ethical ambiguity. INTPs would be drawn to the complex legal strategies and moral dilemmas presented throughout the story. The film’s emphasis on critical thinking and the puzzle-like nature of the court case will ensure that no INTP gets bored for a moment.\n\n15. Mr. Nobody (2009)\n\nMr. Nobody dives deep into themes of choice, destiny, and the different paths life can take. Its nonlinear narrative and philosophical questions are perfectly suited for the contemplative nature of INTPs.\n\n16. A Beautiful Mind (2001)\n\nTelling the story of Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash, A Beautiful Mind explores the fine line between genius and madness. INTPs will be drawn in by the film’s portrayal of intellectual pursuit and personal struggle.\n\n17. Memento (2000)\n\nMemento is a masterful exploration of memory, identity, and the quest for truth. I think any Introverted Thinking type (or NT) would enjoy this movie. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film’s reverse chronological narrative forces viewers to piece together the protagonist’s story just as he attempts to solve a mystery using notes, tattoos, and Polaroid photos due to his short-term memory loss. INTPs will be drawn to Memento for its unique storytelling technique and the mental challenge it presents. The movie encourages a critical examination of perception versus reality, a concept that I think will fascinate a lot of INTPs.\n\n18. Requiem for a Dream (2000)\n\nRequiem for a Dream exposes the harrowing realities of addiction and the devastating impacts it has on dreams and relationships. This film, directed by Darren Aronofsky, is known for its intense emotional depth, innovative narrative structure, and the stark, haunting visuals that leave a lasting impression on its audience. INTPs would be drawn to Requiem for a Dream for its psychological depth and the nuanced way it explores the human psyche. The movie’s unflinching honesty in depicting the spiral of addiction will satisfy the INTPs’ preference for narratives that don’t shy away from the darker aspects of human nature.\n\n19. Waking Life (2001)\n\nWaking Life, an exploration of dreams, consciousness, and existentialism, uses unique rotoscope animation to blur the lines between waking life and the dream world. I’ve never seen it, but after so many recommendations from INTPs, it is at the top of my watchlist.\n\n20. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nA masterpiece of science fiction, 2001: A Space Odyssey explores themes of evolution, artificial intelligence, and the unknown. Its visionary scope and intellectual depth make it a must-watch for INTPs.\n\n21. Interstellar (2014)\n\nInterstellar is a visually stunning and emotionally profound film that explores complex themes such as love, sacrifice, and the survival of humankind. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this epic science fiction story takes viewers on a journey through space and time, challenging the limits of human understanding and technology.\n\n22. Fargo (1996)\n\nMixing dark humor with crime drama, Fargo presents a quirky, yet intelligent look at human nature and morality. The Coen Brothers’ iconic storytelling style and memorable characters make it an intriguing watch for INTPs.\n\n23. Little Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nA heartwarming tale of a dysfunctional family’s road trip, Little Miss Sunshine explores themes of success, failure, and acceptance. Its blend of humor and pathos makes a lot of people scratch their heads, but I’ve known quite a few INTPs who fell in love with this movie and re-watch it again and again as a feel-good treat.\n\n24. District 9 (2009)\n\nDistrict 9 tackles issues of xenophobia and social segregation through the lens of a sci-fi thriller. It tells the story of how, thirty years ago, aliens arrive on Earth — not to conquer or give aid, but to find refuge from their dying planet. Separated from humans in a South African area called District 9, the aliens are managed by Multi-National United, a corporation that is unconcerned with the aliens’ welfare but is desperate to master their advanced technology. The plot thickens when a company field agent, Sharlto Copley, contracts a mysterious virus that begins to alter his DNA. Suddenly, there is only one place he can hide: District 9. This narrative thrusts viewers into a gritty, thought-provoking exploration of humanity, alienation, and the ethics of power and survival.\n\n25. American Psycho (2000)\n\nAmerican Psycho offers a darkly satirical look at consumerism, identity, and surface-level culture. Its psychological depth and critique of modern society are perfect for the INTP with a strong stomach.\n\n26. The Blue Kite (1993)\n\nThe Blue Kite is a poignant and powerful depiction of a family’s struggle for survival amidst the political turmoil in 1950s China. Through the eyes of a young boy, the film explores themes of loss, resilience, and the impact of political ideology on personal lives. Directed by Tian Zhuangzhuang, this film’s strength lies in its detailed portrayal of the human cost of political changes. INTPs would be drawn to The Blue Kite for its deep exploration of such themes, which not only prompts a reflection on historical and political contexts but also on the inherent strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity.\n\n27. Get Out (2017)\n\nGet Out, directed by Jordan Peele, is a groundbreaking horror film that intertwines psychological suspense with acute social commentary, primarily focusing on racism and identity in contemporary America. The story follows Chris, a young African-American man, as he visits his white girlfriend’s family estate, only to uncover a disturbing reality that challenges his perception of his surroundings and himself. The way Get Out dissects complex social issues through an engaging and suspenseful storyline makes it a must-watch for INTPs, who would appreciate its innovative approach to discussing prevalent societal themes within the framework of genre cinema.\n\n28. Hero (2002)\n\nCombining visual splendor with a complex narrative, Hero is a martial arts epic that explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the subjective nature of truth. Its philosophical undercurrents and breathtaking cinematography are likely to tickle an INTP’s sense of wonder.\n\n29. The Princess Bride (1987)\n\nI think nearly every personality type I surveyed picked The Princess Bride as one of their favorite movies. It’s not hard to see why considering you get a bit of everything in this film. Action, romance, comedy, horror (yes, that machine is terrifying), and a little bit of drama. A delightful adventure that’s equal parts fairy tale and witty satire, The Princess Bride tells the story of a farmhand named Westley who must rescue his true love, Princess Buttercup, from the clutches of evil Prince Humperdinck. Filled with memorable characters and quotable lines, this film appeals to INTPs for its clever storytelling and subversion of traditional fairy tale tropes.\n\n30. The Fifth Element (1997)\n\nDirected by Luc Besson, The Fifth Element tells the story of Korben Dallas, a cab driver who unwittingly becomes central to the search for the Fifth Element, a mystical force necessary to prevent the annihilation of Earth. INTPs would particularly appreciate the movie’s originality, intricate world-building, and the philosophical questions it raises about the nature of life and the universe.\n\n31. Donnie Darko (2001)\n\nA cult classic, Donnie Darko explores themes of time travel, existential dread, and suburban angst. Its ambiguous narrative and complex symbolism are a perfect match for the INTP’s analytical mind.\n\n32. No Country for Old Men (2007)\n\nNo Country for Old Men is a gripping neo-Western thriller that dives deep into the themes of fate, conscience, and the relentless nature of violence. Directed by the Coen Brothers, this film is set in the desolate landscape of 1980s Texas and follows the cat-and-mouse chase between a hunter who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and a merciless hitman. Its suspenseful story, coupled with stark, atmospheric cinematography, creates an intense, thought-provoking experience. INTPs are likely to appreciate the existential questions the movie poses, the moral ambiguity of its characters, and the way it challenges conventional notions of justice and destiny.\n\n33. The Secret of Kells (2009)\n\nThe Secret of Kells is an animated fantasy film that blends magical realism with historical fiction, telling the story of a young monk named Brendan who discovers a world of enchantment and danger as he seeks to complete a legendary book. This visually stunning film is not only a feast for the eyes with its unique animation style inspired by medieval art, but it also explores themes of creativity, faith, and the preservation of knowledge.\n\n34. It’s A Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nIt’s A Wonderful Life is a timeless classic that a lot of us watch on Thanksgiving in preparation for Christmas (or at least I do). It portrays the life of George Bailey, a man who has given up his dreams to help others. Overwhelmed by stress, work, and perceived personal failure, he confronts his demons on Christmas Eve. This film’s exploration of existential themes, such as the impact of a single life on the world and the intrinsic value of individuals, is moving to anyone. INTPs would appreciate the film’s profound philosophical questions about the meaning and significance of one’s existence, coupled with its message about the importance of each individual’s contributions to society.\n\n35. Edward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nEdward Scissorhands is a modern fairy tale that combines elements of gothic horror with a poignant story of isolation, creativity, and the longing for acceptance. Directed by Tim Burton, this film’s visual style and thematic depth engage INTPs’ imagination and sympathy for the outsider.\n\nOther Articles You Might Enjoy:\n\nINTP vs INTJ: 7 Ways to Tell Them Apart\n\n12 Amazing INTP Anime Characters\n\n21 Hobbies That INTPs Love\n\nWhat Do You Think?\n\nDo you like these movies?
