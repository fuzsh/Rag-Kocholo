        "text": "This category encompasses films about and set in the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), a violent sociopolitical purge movement in China. Launched by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), its stated goal was to preserve Chinese communism by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Mao Zedong Thought (known outside China as Maoism) as the dominant ideology in the CCP. The Revolution marked Mao's return to the central position of power in China after a period of less radical leadership to recover from the failures of the Great Leap Forward, which contributed to the Great Chinese Famine only five years prior."
