        "text": "Congratulations, Hong Kong, on your first National Day as part of the People's Republic. Just to celebrate TVB Pearl with a rare, but welcome burst of good taste has decided to screen the mainland movie In The Heat Of The Sun (Pearl, 8.30pm). The film is based on a novel by now banned mainland author, Wang Shuo, and directed by Jiang Wen, dubbed the Chinese Gerard Depardieu both because of his build (chunky) and his ubiquitousness.\n\nBefore you leap to the conclusion that TVB is toadying in the most craven fashion to our new leaders by showing a mainland movie at prime time on the English language channel on this of all days, I should say that despite praise abroad, this film raised eyebrows at home and needed to be heavily cut before being released in China.\n\nWhat probably worried the Beijing film board the most about this movie is not its searing metaphorical historical narrative about oppression, but the fact it takes the mickey out of the system, which is far more dangerous.\n\nIf you have always been bored rigid by mainland movies, assuming they are all either beautiful but intense art house films such as Red Sorghum, Yellow Earth and The Blue Kite, or dull propaganda movies then this could be the film to change your mind. This is a teen angst movie set during the Cultural Revolution, with the accent on the teen angst rather than politics.\n\nThe writer Wang Shuo, who has included much of his own growing years during the late 1960s and early 70s in his books, has said that for him the Cultural Revolution was just one long holiday from school and authority and he had a ball, and the lead character Monkey is just the same.\n\nPlayed by Xia Yu, who got the best actor award at the Venice Film Festival, Monkey is the kind of kid who thinks about girls and hanging out with his mates much more than Mao Zedong's Little Red Book or imprisoning his teachers.\n\nDirector Jiang Wen, born in 1963, has also incorporated some of his own memories into the movie; Monkey was even his real-life nickname as a boy. He is known as one of the so-called sixth generation of directors, the ones who make movies about young Chinese who just live, fall in love, get drunk, and get in trouble, just like any other young people anywhere else in the world. He doesn't have much interest in directing period pieces, although he has starred in a few of them including Red Sorghum.\n\nWhen he met a writer from the International Herald Tribune, to talk about this film, he gave those movies that are lapped up by foreign critics short shrift.\n\n'Last night, we ate French, because Chinese restaurants abroad are fake, like Chinese films. I'm not an official director, I made my movie from here, because I had something to say, not to win prizes. But some film-makers want recognition, and the West wants to show compassion and understanding for China - those poor Chinese!' Over on the other side, programmers have chosen a bland Andie MacDowell vehicle, Ruby Cairo (World, 9.30pm).\n\nShe starts the movie as Bessie Faro, complacent wife and mother, juggling household chores and child care while husband Johnny goes out and flies planes to feed the family.\n\nThen suddenly she is told he is dead, and goes to bury him in Mexico and finds out dear old Johnny wasn't quite the man she had thought.\n\nThe rest of the movie involves Bessie hiking around Europe from Berlin to, of course Cairo, and along the way she hitches up with Dr Fergus Lamb (Liam Neeson).\n\nThe whole movie should be viewed as a warning to women who leave all that boring financial stuff like income and expenditure to their husbands.\n\nIt is just asking for trouble, as any good divorce lawyer will tell you."
