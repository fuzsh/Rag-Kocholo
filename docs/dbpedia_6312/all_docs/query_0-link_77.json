        "text": "In studies of contemporary Chinese. Asian, or world cinema, the Fifth Generation, is a a term that no scholar can afford to miss. The term refers to a group of filmmakers that emerged in 1983 and initiated China's first art film movement. Although the art movement ended around 1988. these filmmakers have remained China's most important cultural figures. Although much has been written about them and their films in English. Chinese and other languages, there was a regrettable absence of a systematic study of the Fifth Generation. This dissertation addresses this absence by focusing on one question: What has the Fifth Generation changed? The dissertation is structured around six concepts in China's critical discourse on the 1980s and 1990s: mass media, literature, nation, history, women, and personal narrative. The author regards literature, nation, and history as the three cornerstones of the Chinese film tradition and examines the Fifth Generation as a group of cultural rebels who have reshaped film's relationship with all three concepts. Case studies offer new understandings of Postcolonialism, nationalism, and Orientalism, along with the theoretical discussion. The limitation of the generation's revolution is examined through its representation of women through engendered perspectives. The compromises of the Fifth Generation are reflected through an introduction of the Sixth Generation as a more radical group of rebels who took nearly a decade to surface from the underground. We may glimpse new trends in Chinese and world cinema from the personal narratives of urban stories narrated by these younger filmmakers. In addition to textual analyses of film works by some rarely discussed directors, including Wu Ziniu. Li Shaohong. Feng Xiaoning. Ye Daying. and Yang Liping. the dissertation also offers concise historical reviews of how the Fifth Generation emerged, how the film concept has been developed, how nationalism has been perceived, and how different generations of directors have presented women in China. The dissertation reveals how Chinese filmmakers must constantly negotiate with the market, censorship, and the West by locating the Fifth Generation in the “big picture\" of contemporary Chinese film culture and mass media.\n\nIn Shanghai Filmmaking, Huang Xuelei invites readers to go on an intimate, detailed, behind-the-scenes tour of the world of early Chinese cinema. She paints a nuanced picture of the Mingxing Motion Picture Company, the leading Chinese film studio in the 1920s and 1930s, and argues that Shanghai filmmaking involved a series of border-crossing practices. Shanghai filmmaking developed in a matrix of global cultural production and distribution, and interacted closely with print culture and theatre. People from allegedly antagonistic political groupings worked closely with each other to bring a new form of visual culture and a new body of knowledge to an audience in and outside China. By exploring various border crossings, this book sheds new light on the power of popular cultural production during China’s modern transformation.
