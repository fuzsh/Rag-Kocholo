Eddie Griffin's DysFunktional Family is a pretty funny movie if you like urban comedy. Griffin touches on everything from sex & 9/11 to religion and family. His stand up routines were every funny and he's a natural in front of the camera. The movie isn't for all tastes and sure the movie has bad editing but who cares,it's a stand up film. If you want a good laugh then check this one out.
