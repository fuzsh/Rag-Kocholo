        "text": "6/25 Preservation Libations: Master Mix-Off at the Albert Pike Memorial Temple\n\nLITTLE ROCK | Though it might lack the cloak-and-dagger mystique of former speakeasies—it seems unlikely that mixology would have been so well publicized in the era of Prohibition—this historically themed event has what counts: Specifically, booze. (In addition to friendly competition and tunes by members of Little Rock’s Amasa Hines. But mainly, booze.) On hand to pour, splash, concoct and serve said libations—both for attendees and a panel of very lucky judges—will be some of the city’s finest cocktail slingers from the likes of 109 & Co., Big Orange, Cache, Ciao Baci, among a slew of others. And although much of what they’re set to serve is still being kept under wraps—though we hear that the likes of genever, amari and old-style vermouths may make an appearance—we’re perfectly fine with a little mystery. (preservearkansas.org/what-we-do/mixoff)\n\n6/11-27 Artosphere:Arkansas’s Arts & Nature Festival\n\nNORTHWEST ARKANSAS | With 16 performances, installations and concerts spread over 11 days, Northwest Arkansas’s sixth annual Artosphere festival can be a bit daunting. To help you find your way around, here are four events you shouldn’t miss:\n\nWhat: I Think I Can\n\nWhere: Walton Arts Center’s Joy Pratt Markham Gallery in Fayetteville\n\nWhen: June 16-27\n\nWhy: This interactive installation is so much more than just a model train set. Members of the public are invited to take a short “career test” on an iPad before receiving a 1:87-scale puppet representing their chosen career. Participants then tell their character’s story while a puppeteer animates the puppet’s placement into the world.\n\nWhat: Alonzo King Lines Ballet\n\nWhere: Walton Arts Center’s Baum Walker Hall in Fayetteville\n\nWhen: June 16\n\nWhy: Featuring the sounds of beavers, humpback whales, Pacific tree frogs, mountain gorillas and other natural soundscapes collected by famed bioacoustic recordist Bernie Krause, this performance by the San Francisco-based Alonzo King Lines Ballet promises to be wild.\n\nWhat: Strange Fruit (pictured) at Trail Mix and Family Sunday\n\nWhere: Crystal Bridges’ trails in Bentonville\n\nWhen: June 21\n\nWhy: Combine equal parts theater, dance, circus and surrealist performance art, and then stick it atop 14-foot poles, and you’ll get something close to this world-renowned performing arts company’s “Swoon.” If you can’t make the show, check out their performance of “Spheres” on June 19 in Fayetteville’s Tyson Plaza.\n\nWhat: Bold Spirit: The Best of Beethoven\n\nWhere: Walton Arts Center’s Baum Walker Hall in Fayetteville\n\nWhen: June 27\n\nWhy: For its final performance at this year’s festival, the Artosphere Festival Orchestra—an ensemble of more than 80 musicians gathered from some of the world’s best orchestras and music programs—will perform two of Beethoven’s most famous works. Drop by before the show to learn about featured pianist Pietro de Maria.\n\n6/26-27 The Mount Magazine Butterfly Festival\n\nPARIS | Although spring storms have trounced many of the season’s flowers, taking the likelihood of seeing, say, the vibrantly hued state butterfly, Diana fritillary, down a notch or four, there’s still plenty of places to look among the 2,220 acres of the state park for the 25 species you might come across during the festival. (Pro-tip: patience.) For those less inclined to tote binoculars and nets, the festival proper has a live butterfly observatory tent on the festival grounds—filled with monarchs and painted lady butterflies that will be released Saturday afternoon—in addition to the pageant, photo and art contest, live entertainment and more. (mountmagazinestatepark.com)\n\n6/5 Tim McGraw | Verizon Arena\n\nNORTH LITTLE ROCK | Of course you know he’s coming. Because when one of the world’s biggest stars of country music—or of any genre, for that matter—comes to town, it’s known well in advance. And if you’re lucky enough to be in attendance, you know everyone (us included) is totally wishing they were in your boots. (verizonarena.com)\n\n(Note: For those not fortunate enough to have scored seat in Verizon, there’s still a whole lot of good vibes and sounds coming your way this summer—most of which are laid out on page 23.)\n\n6/3-21 August: Osage County | Arkansas Repertory Theatre\n\nLITTLE ROCK | This critically acclaimed, Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning black comedy makes its way to The Rep this month as the theater’s final production of its 2014/2015 season. Producing Artistic Director Robert Hupp directs this tale of a deeply dysfunctional family that gathers at its Oklahoma homestead when the family patriarch goes missing. Over the course of a month, dirty laundry is aired, skeletons revealed and nothing is ever the same.
