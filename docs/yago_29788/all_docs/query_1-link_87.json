        "text": "Tag: Lorne Michaels\n\nCast Chronology: Kristen Wiig\n\n(*SIGH*)………….I can’t escape it, can I?\n\nI Know that many people out there are willing to walk on Broken Glass to defend Kristen Wiig…and while I’ve stated time and again that I have no problem with her OUTSIDE of SNL, the 7 years she called Studio 8H her home will probably be one of THE Most Polarizing times many SNL fans ever endured (Myself included); If not because we know deep down that she is enormously talented no matter what she does, than certainly because of just how irritating her performances could be in spite of her obvious talents and her seemingly shy nature when the cameras turn off…I know that seems hard to believe now, but there was once a time in certain circles of the SNL fandom where Wiig would be a 4-Letter word…I mean, it is in the literal sense, but I speak more in the figurative here. And speaking as a 25+ year fan of the show, this also meant having to endure the likes of Late period-Molly Shannon, barely tolerating Chris Kattan, and all 5 years of Cheri Oteri—on a Bad day, each of the previous are Teddy bears compared to Wiig on her best day…she was That irritating sometimes…And yet, she was the show’s Golden Girl from 2005 to 2012; with some considering her the 2nd coming of Gilda Radner—Yes, they set the bar THAT high for Wiig…and while I can only KINDA see why people feel that way about her, “Kinda” is better than nothing at all…so there’s that.\n\nSo with her hosting this year’s Christmas episode, this would be as good a time as any to see just exactly How she became a Lionized figure of the show over the years—and with that, it’s time for another edition of “Cast Chronology”; that’s right, one of the most arguably popular cast members of recent years Does Not have a “Best of” show/DVD/Highlight reel to her name…which is unfortunate, because I’m sure there are a number of Hidden Gems of hers out there that are FAR better than even her most irritating pieces, but since she doesn’t, we gotta follow our own rules…\n\n*This is NOT—I repeat, NOT—a “Best Of” or “Favorites” list by any means. This is really more to show how certain cast members evolved over a period of time, and what ultimately brought them to where they are now. So this will mean that I will more than likely include some “Bad” sketches as well.\n\n*Like we said, Wiig doesn’t have a “Best Of” DVD, any sketch in her time frame is fair play.\n\n*The sketches they appear in are either Lead or Supporting roles; no bit parts.\n\n*Since Wiig is one of our more “Tenured” cast members; she’ll have One sketch per Calendar year featured—but ONLY as a Cast member; Cameos/Host appearances since she left the show will not count. However, because she started out as a Featured player (as most cast members do these days), I’ll do some Doubling up on those years.\n\n*Finally, I lift the “Non-recurring” rule for these, partly because a cast member’s run would’ve been incomplete/impossible without mentioning At Least a few of them.\n\nFALL 2005\n\nTHE SOAKING WET KILLER (11/12/2005 – Photo from “One SNL A Day”) – Wiig’s introduction to the show was every bit as auspicious as any other cast member who joins the show while there are fully established players well-rooted in their runs—even more so for Wiig, because not unlike her fellow alumni Rachel Dratch, Maya Rudolph, Jason Sudeikis & Kate McKinnon, she had the distinction of starting her run smack-dab in the middle of a season. Still though, she hit the ground running in–what was otherwise—a relatively low-key straight role. Of course, if all she did on the show were Low-key roles, her tenure wouldn’t be half as memorable as it turned out to be. She had to show a little more range in order for anybody to notice her…\n\nSPRING 2006\n\nTWO A-HOLES AT A CRIME SCENE (5/20/2006) – Disregarding use of a creep in this particular sketch; This is not the first one of these sketches to have aired early in her run, but it certainly was one of Wiig’s first that shows how she could toggle herself between low-key and slightly needling (but in a good way in this case). As one half of the un-named A-Hole couple, Wiig managed to perfectly capture a specific type of person that was running far too rampant, even back then. One of the Clueless, vapid, shallow, self-absorbed excuse of a human being who Thinks they have the world on a string thanks to how clueless those people tend to be; but in the end, nothing winds up getting accomplished. These sketches ran for about 3 years, and while there was an inevitable mark of “Diminishing Returns” each time she & Jason Sudeikis did them, Somehow, the couple’s Ass-holic ways turned out to be somewhat endearing in spite of how much people like that can get to you in real life. So, OK, we can see that Wiig is capable of having a little range…what else can she do?\n\nFALL 2006\n\nTARGET (12/16/2006 – Photo from “The Wicker Breaker”) – Again, this is not the first of these sketches, nor is it even the most famous one of these sketches (Ironically, another Timberlake helmed sketch where he plays someone named “Classic Peg” seems to be the most popular…for some reason). But it’s worth noting that it’s probably around this time where some people started to realize that a flag or two might be raised with Wiig. Not just because of how grating Wiig’s cashier would wind up becoming, but also the notion—at least to some of us—that she may or may not have been trying to horn in the work of another sketch performer from another sketch series? Don’t believe me? Watch the Target sketch I linked you to, and THEN watch Mo Collins of MadTV fame as Stuart’s Mom, and tell me that the two of them could’ve been related…I dare you. Still though, even though this was Wiig’s 2nd year on the show, she was still trying to find her voice; or if she already did, she’s trying to find the right volume to use. Unfortunately, (To borrow a few metaphors from what I do for a living) Volume is just one piece of Calibration needed in order to attain perfection; you still have to adjust the Bass, the Treble, the EQ and the Dynamics in order to achieve a superior product…\n\n2007\n\nWHERE’S MY PURSE (10/13/2007) – I Stand Corrected, I think it’s HERE where we start to see the flags flying on just how hammy she could be on her worst day…AND YET I can’t blame her 100% on the performance—credit/blame has to go to whoever wrote this (I’m guessing James Anderson due to sketches like these being his bread and butter), plus a few other performers in the sketch helping to drag it down with her. I mentioned this sketch years ago, but I feel the need to bring this one up again simply for the fact that this may have represented sort of a “Point of No Return” for Wiig. In that the characters and other people she would play from here on out had to do something “Wacky” or “Kooky” in order to get any kind of reaction from the audience—something I would like to coin as “Look at the Keys Syndrome”, y’know, like when you try to do that for a Baby in order for it to giggle even a little. AND YET, in spite of the sketch’s Major flaws, this could’ve worked under different circumstances…what, I don’t know, but certainly far better ones than whining about the whereabouts of her Purse. As I mentioned previously, something about this sketch felt a little familiar; almost like something “30 Rock” would do (with all due respect). Otherwise, I think it’s safe to say that this sketch began to put Wiig onto a rocky path, one that could only be navigated if she could segue herself into more subtle roles to help balance things out…\n\n2008\n\nVIRGINIA HORSEN’S HOT-AIR BALLOON RIDES (2/23/2008) – THIS…This right Here…This is the Kind of performance that I WISH Kristen Wiig did more often on SNL. Granted, she’s since become Far more subtle & nuanced in her movie roles; but at this point in show history, it started to become increasingly rarer for Wiig to do. So whenever she did pieces like these where she was the right blend of Low-Key and Wacky; and instead, trading those performances for ones that were big and loud by comparison–It almost felt like finding the Pot of Gold at the end of a somewhat jagged rainbow. What’s more, this sketch was only done twice, so even though this had all the potential to be recurring; perhaps whoever wrote both sketches (and maybe even Wiig herself) thought that doing any more than that would probably be overkill…a lesson that Wiig may have conveniently forgot about when it comes to the next few entries…\n\n2009\n\nTODAY (2/7/2009) – When it comes to doing an impression of a famous person on the show, the approach could be taken a number of ways. You could actually not have to give a damn about the person you’re portraying and just reduce it to a few choice foibles (Chevy as Gerald Ford, for instance); Or, you could actually give a damn, put in the effort and try to do something that’s as close to a photocopy of the person you’re impersonating as possible (Messers Carvey, Hartman, Hammond & Hader AND Madams McKinnon, Gardner & Fineman, just to name a few). In Wiig’s case, she sort of fell somewhere in the middle with her portrayal of Kathie Lee Gifford; she’s got the look down, she’s got the mannerisms down, but IMO she may have went a step too far when portraying Gifford as a seemingly clueless day-drinker (You all know that the “Wine” she & Hota Kotb drink on TV is Prop wine, right? They weren’t actually “Drunk” on the air). In other words, as much as I’m sure the Real Kathie Lee may have enjoyed the impression from time to time, I think it may have been a little too unfair a portrayal. Or, to borrow a famous “Lorne-ism” It got a laugh, but did it get the RIGHT Laugh?\n\n2010\n\nSECRET WORD & GARTH & KAT – ………………..(*DEEP BREATH*)…………OK, I’m just gonna treat these as a band-aid I need to rip off my arm; the sooner I do, the better…………(*DEEP BREATH*)…………If “Where’s My Purse” was considered Wiig’s “Point of No Return” when it comes to how hammy she could be, as well as her ability to toggle between that and Subtle performances, then THESE Two entities is the point where Wiig is permanently sucked into a Black Hole of Ham and can only hope she comes across her 80 year old daughter “Interstellar” style in an effort to forgive her for embarking on the mission in the first place (It’s been a while since I’ve seen it, pardon me). These Two characters may be THE most polarizing of all among SNL Hardcore fans and Casual tuners-in; One side LOOOOOVVVES Them to pieces, while the other side wonders if Elvis had the right Idea all along when it comes to Handguns and TV sets. For me personally, this is Kristen Wiig at her Nadir. And, just as it is the case time and time again, these are characters that really only worked ONE Time and ONE time only…yet, for some reason, the audience ate it up just enough so that they would keep coming back again and again…But Why? The “Secret Word” sketches were a send-up on the original 1960s version of the game show “Password”, particularly the times when the Celebrity contestants (and sometimes the host) would screw up gameplay by reading the word that they’re NOT Supposed to read…and that’s all fine and good…for just ONE SKETCH. But thanks to just how over-the-top Wiig plays her attention-seeking, theater actress Bon vivant, Mindy “LOOK AT ME!” Grayson, this sketch somehow repeated itself an additional 8 times—One is Plenty, we get the joke. Same can be said for “Garth & Kat”, Update’s perpetually unprepared singing duo (and sometimes Trio) who SWEAR They have their act together, and yet, somehow, Wiig & Fred Armisen continue to bumble their way through the routine—one that, to my knowledge, is one of the ONLY times SNL allows any form of improvisation on the show, and considering how “to the Script” it tends to be, that SHOULD be saying something; but it doesn’t mean a damn thing if the piece isn’t funny to begin with…and again, that’s all fine and good for EXACTLY ONE APPEARANCE…And Yet………BOY, did this one have endurance, not 100% certain of the exact number of them, but NBC’s site has them listed (at least) NINE TIMES. That’s NINE TIMES that people fell for the ruse. A Ruse that Update Anchor Seth Meyers could’ve easily put a stop to; but given his Characteristic of giving his Update correspondents chance upon chance to get things right the next time (Spoiler alert: Both sketches never did, try as they may to vary things on rare occasions). This one-two punch of More ham than allowed at Chanukah pretty much soured my opinion on Kristen Wiig for some time; and it would take nothing short of a miracle for her to win me back (again, not counting her movies, just SNL Only).\n\n2011\n\nRED FLAG (9/25/2011) – Thankfully by the time of her (unbeknownst to us at this point) final season, she actually managed to find the happy medium between nuance and showing off. Even more happily, this may very well be the best of both of those worlds. A perfume parody—incidentally, narrated by friend of the show Jon Hamm—where we get to see Wiig go back and forth between subtle and manic, and nothing is lost in translation. Even more so, she manages to do this (almost) without a single word of dialogue—a plus—and she’ll still manage to chew more scenery than a famine victim. Maybe because it’s as brief as Commercial parodies go, it–not unlike Virginia Horsen–serves its purpose in not overstaying its welcome; another plus. This piece may arguably be Wiig’s best “non-character” sketch, and it also shows just how far she’s come in 6 years’ time by this time.\n\n2012\n\nGRADUATION (5/19/2012 – Photo from “One SNL a Day”) – It’s fitting that we wrap this up with Wiig’s final appearance as a cast member; and depending on which side you find yourself on, this moment is either gonna be a tearful moment, a “tears of joy” moment, a “Goodbye, and Good Riddance” moment, or a “Please pass the Vomit Bag” moment. For me personally; when this first aired, my immediate reaction on the old S-N-L message board was “IT’S OFFICIAL, SHE’S HISTORY!!!” But not in a “don’t let the door hit you on the way out” kind of way, because even though she was very much a divisive figure to a number of people, you can’t fault the impact she ultimately left on the show in her 7 years for better or worse…so much so, that she continued to make periodic non-hosting cameos for a little while since she left (which she has Thankfully dialed back on over time). Still though, she earned her victory lap; and thanks to Mick “NOT FUNNYYYYY!!!” Jagger hosting, Wiig’s send-off winds up being classier than expected thanks to use of the songs “She’s a Rainbow” and “Ruby Tuesday”; accompanied by the entire cast sharing a dance step or two. What really makes this moment both a Special Occasion AND a point of Polarization among fans, however, was when Lorne would come on stage as Wiig’s final dance partner…Which, I’m sure was a very strong sentiment to Wiig, but I can’t help but think of how other cast members left the show before and since this (that includes Andy Samberg, whose final show it happen to be as well, but he already said goodbye earlier in the oft-forgotten “Lazy Sunday” sequel, so…fair trade?). Nevertheless, after many moments in the sun for the past 7 years, this was her victory lap; and the rest of the cast dancing along with her seem genuinely sad to see her go…even though she will log more than her fair share of cameos in the intervening years.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Wiig certainly deserves her props for doing what she did on the show—but only to a point…that point being somewhere around 2009, but it’s not her fault that she wound up getting the material that she got, and I don’t even blame the writers either for their lack of imagination more often than not. The back-to-back departures of Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph within a year of each other sort of flung Wiig into the role of “Alpha Female” even though many other underperformers tried (and failed) to ease the slack a little. Still, Wiig persisted for better or worse—even more so depending on what side you were on. For what it’s worth, Wiig busted her ass on the show, yet at the same time, she tried too hard just to please us; sometimes appearing in roughly 90% of some shows during her run. Despite the show’s psychological need to seek out a “Star” once every few years from the people they hire; SNL is, was, and will always be an ensemble show. No man (or woman) is an island, and I would’ve been perfectly satisfied if Wiig delegated a role or two once in a blue moon. But because the audience practically ate out of her hands every time she wound up on camera, there she was for the whole world to see, and in some cases, endure. I’m glad she’s since been able to find her niche is roles that cater more to the kind of performer she was meant to be—though I AM dying to know just how she’ll carry herself once “Wonder Woman 1984” rolls out. Considering the Extensiveness of her tenure, I know I left a few more noteworthy moments out (Apologies to Judy Grimes [one of my favorite characters of all time, BTW], Surprise Sue, Suze Orman, Dooneese & Shana—No apologies to “Trina/Thomas”, because at least Wiig came to her senses on that); but like I said at the top, this was more of a look at how Wiig got from Point A to Point B, so apologies for leaving those moments out. I also realize that this analysis of a former cast member may come off as “Bitter” to some of you who have read this article—just as a reminder, I’m only one guy and I am by NO means a definitive resource. If you happen to like Wiig, all the better. I like her too, just not (100%) on SNL.\n\nWith that said, that wraps up 2020 (thank Merciful god), We’ll do another one of these as soon as the show comes back—whenever that is, most likely late January or whenever it’s OK for people to watch TV tapings in closed spaces again, Gov. Cuomo & Mayor DeBlasio, I’m looking in YOUR direction—I hope beyond hope that we don’t screw up 2021 as much as we did this year, and I’ll catch ‘ya on the next one. Happy Giving Month, everybody!\n\nOnce more, With Feeling!: The Top 8 Original SNL Songs\n\nSince the Grammy Awards are tomorrow night, let’s move on to Music on SNL…No, not Musical Guests (those clips are a little too hard to find, but I’ll keep that in the back of my head for the future), but rather “Original” music. After all, we are here to look at comedy and sometimes Music & Comedy manage to intersect in such a way that the bit becomes enjoyable. So on that note, this week we’re going to take a look at the Top 8 Original Songs made for SNL (A Topic that—now that I think about it—might’ve been a better fit for the Tony Awards, but it’s too late to change that now). And yes, you damn well better Believe there’s gonna be Criteria…\n\nCRITERIA:\n\n*Goes without saying; the Songs have to be either wholly Original, a Single sketch with a compilation of songs, or a sound-alike of an existing song with wholly original lyrics (though sound-alikes will cost a few points). This means things like Jimmy Fallon’s 2004 farewell—with a bunch of pre-existing songs in medley form—are DQ’d.\n\n*The Songs in question have to have been Written FOR THE SHOW. I mention this specifically because of two people—Dana Carvey, who used the all-time classic “Choppin Broccoli” for his Audition, and Adam Sandler whose “Lunchlady Land” was actually part of his 1993 comedy album “They’re all Gonna laugh at you” before it aired a year later. Simply put, It wouldn’t be fair to include something that wasn’t part of the show on a “Biological/Hereditary” level. I’ll excuse it if the piece came from a comedy troupe or workshop (I.e. “Second City” and such) because workshops are exactly that; a place where you can iron out the kinks before taking things public.\n\n*I am going to make a RARE exception to my “Non-Recurring” rule this week, because once we get to the sketch in question, you will see why the moment was vital to future seasons of the show.\n\n*NO MONOLOGUES!!! Not that I want to totally dis-credit the musical numbers that happen in the Monologues, but there’s just been too God Damn MANY of them (in the past 15 Years ALONE) that it would be a LOT easier to focus on songs that appear in SKETCHES ONLY this time around. Maybe next year, I can do a “Musical Monologue Only” list, but for now, let’s just keep things simple.\n\n*With the Exception of an Obvious one, I’m also going to exclude Andy Samberg’s “Digital Shorts”—Partly because I’ve always considered them an independent part of the show; like “Update” or the Smigeltoons. With over 100 to choose from, it’s probably best if I do a list of JUST the shorts in the future as well.\n\n8. “ALWAYS BELIEVE” – CHURCH OF NEUROTOLOGY (4/4/2015) – Ever since Andy Samberg & his “Digital Short” crew left in 2012, the show continues to find ways to entertain us on film…most of them in “Music Video” form; and trust me, If I were to include all of the ones I liked from 2012-present, this list would stretch over the equator. So for now, this is probably my favorite Original song of the “Modern” era of SNL. HBO’s “Going Clear” documentary is their target, with a dash of “Pop-up-Video” on the side. I always enjoy watching sketches that requires repeat viewings in order to fully get every single joke, and this one was no exception. From the ridiculous Late-80s costuming to the somewhat disturbing outcomes of ex-followers, this has a lot of density to it that even if it wasn’t completely funny, it still feels like an Easter Egg hunt for jokes that were buried underneath it. This is definitely going to take a couple of views in order to fully appreciate the effort that went into this on, but for now I gotta go with my initial instinct; this was a near-perfect slap in the face to Scientology without it actually being Scientology, and it may be the biggest effort they made for the night. I especially liked Bobby’s bits as “Not!L. Ron Hubbard”, The ultra-rare Jost sighting, and even Kenan had a good joke with “Left after Googling”. Like I said, it’s gonna require multiple views…and why not? We SHOULD be able to watch sketches over & over instead of simply discarding the bad ones.\n\n7. THE WAYNE’S WORLD THEME SONG BY AEROSMITH (2/17/1990) – I almost didn’t want to include this one not just because it utilizes a recurring character (and a highly popular one at that), but also because the use of a Well Known band might give this performance a bit of a “Ringer” quality; but it’s still original lyrics, and they look like they’re having a good time with it. But more importantly than that, it was also one of the first times (not counting Gerald Ford) where an object of a character’s affection or ridicule came on the show to give a “Stamp of Approval” of sorts. Ever since Aerosmith came, It also wound up happening with Joe Pesci, Robert DeNiro, Alex Trebek, Janet Reno, Neil Diamond, Nomar Garciaparra, Phish, Barry Gibb, and countless others since 1990 (NOTE TO SELF: “Stamp of Approval/Insider Cameo” list in the Distant future…need to catch up on other things first); but it never would’ve happened if Steven Tyler & Co. didn’t rip the door off of Wayne Campbell’s basement first. The appearance turned the “Insider Cameo” into one of SNL’s most frequently used stunt-casting gimmicks, and we thank “The Bad Boys from Boston” for doing so. Party on, Steven; Party on, Joe (and the rest)!\n\n6. LEVELS OF OFFENSE (2/11/1989) – I’ve always liked Glenn Close; to quote Brian Griffin, “She is a Handsome Woman”. But because of all the great performances she’s made throughout the years in the movies, I sometimes forget that she actually made her bones first as a classically trained stage singer (something I was reminded of when I started seeing commercials for her appearing in a revival of “Sunset Blvd.” on Broadway). So when I came across this sketch again recently, it was a revelation all over again. What’s more, an overly complicated musical number begins in probably the most basic of ways. Lovitz is telling Close about a friend of theirs being happy since she is “Getting it Regular”, and we’re off and running. Close is clearly channeling her inner Julie Andrews as she gives Lovitz the business, while the rest of the cast are representations of said levels of offense. The Andrews comparison is a fair one to make, considering the number itself heavily borrows elements from the likes of Rogers & Hammerstein, Lerner & Lowe and ESPECIALLY the Sherman Brothers—given the content of the song, it almost felt like something Anti-Disney. Best of all, they were able to get the point across in less than 4 minutes…unlike today where thanks to reduced commercial times, some things tend to drag out a little. This is a very underrated gem that stands out against other Overplayed (but still enjoyable) pieces…such as…\n\n5. DICK IN A BOX (12/16/2006) – I just KNOW that if/when I eventually do a list of favorite Digital Shorts, this is probably going to be one of the most redundant entries on that list. Nevertheless; if “Lazy Sunday” was the sketch that helped bring SNL to Cultural relevance again in the 21st century (In addition to turning a simple video streaming website into a digital monolith), then “Dick in a Box” brought that same cultural relevance into hyperdrive…That, and in the grand scheme of things, this one was just plain funnier than “Lazy”. Part of why that is could have something to do with the Early 90s get-up that Samberg & Timberlake had going on (supposedly inspired by the likes of “Color me Badd” and other Slow-jammin’, New Jack Swingers), Part of it could’ve been the frequent bleeping of the word “Dick”—though truth be told, I thought they said “Cock” when this first aired, would’ve fit more lyrically, wouldn’t it? So why is such an iconic piece in the middle of the list? Because even though it’s still very much a funny and iconic piece; the flipside of being Iconic is that you also become Highly Overrated thanks to The Law of Diminishing Returns (Just ask Alec Baldwin & his Schweddy Balls). I mentioned this a few weeks ago in a particular Trump-related sketch that there’s a long-held belief by some that if you repeat the joke enough times, it will go from being funny, to being unfunny, and then back again to being funny just because you’re waiting for something else to happen that probably won’t. Same rules apply to sketches that are supposed to stand the test of time—which this one does, but to a point. Again, It’s funny, don’t get me wrong. But sometimes I wonder if even Samberg & Timberlake are sick of it.\n\n4. “THE PENIS SONG” – NUDE BEACH (10/15/1988) – Here it is folks, the song (and the sketch) that made a TV Legend Blush. I put this one in the middle because even though there were enough mentions of the word “Penis” to take down a squadron of fighter jets, the song itself is a relatively short one–but not short enough so you can pick locks with it (Ba-Dum-Bump). But in all seriousness, not only was this one of the most Bold moments the show had since its early years, but if the conditions were right, somebody else would’ve been involved that’s NOT named Mathew Broderick. That someone else’s name? Long Dong Hanks. That’s right, a week before this aired, Davis S. Pumpkins was supposed to appear in this sketch, and he actually did perform in Dress Rehearsal (a sketch you can ONLY find on Hanks’ “Best Of” DVD). But as is the case with most sketches, it got cut after Dress, either for Time or (almost certainly) for content. So on to the next question, HOW was this able to make it to air? Well, Kevin Nealon sort of telegraphs the answer for us at the end by saying the Standards & Practices at NBC had dissolved…which I THOUGHT was a Joke because ALL TV Networks (Except for Premium Cable) need the Censors—no matter how prudish they may be, we still need some boundaries sometimes. But lo and behold, it happened…in fact, it happened on ALL the Broadcast networks in 1988—not because they wanted to, but because of everybody’s favorite corporate excuse; “Cost Cutting”. The censors eventually came back about a year later, but by then the damage was done; though talk about striking while the iron’s hot. Bonus points for this being a Conan O’Brien co-written piece, and for the rare Dennis Miller sketch sighting.\n\n3. SINGLE WOMEN (10/10/1981) – Back in the “One & Done” list, I mentioned Christine Ebersole as my #2 pick. Part of the reason for that, is because she has since become a far better performer on the stage than she was on the show—not that she didn’t try…Having a good set of pipes help, too. This song was performed on her second show in 1981; and despite the fact that a uniquely dark performance piece usually sticks out like a sore thumb on a comedy show, the performance itself remains powerful enough to render any other comparisons to be moot. I later found out that the song itself was written by the Prince of Darkness himself, Michael O’Donoghue (who happened to be the head writer for half the year); and even though the lyrical content is very much Mr. Mike’s handywork, the whole thing seems more sympathetic than apathetic; a point made even bigger thanks to Ebbie’s voice. But then the song wound up taking on a life of its own; adding a country twang and Dolly Parton’s voice makes it even more sympathetic when she released it as a single a few months later. And THEN the song reached another level when it was used as the basis behind a 1984 TV movie called “Single Bars, Single Women” starring Tony Danza & Jean Smart. This song was as dark as it was durable; and if Mr. Mike was alive, he’d probably be epically confused as to how durable it became.\n\n2. DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY CHRISTMAS (12/16/1990) – This one gets the silver because of Quantity over Quality—not that it’s lacking in quality, far from it—sometimes writing multiple mini-songs that are 10-15 seconds at most is a feat in itself (Just ask your average commercial Jingle writer…while they’re still around). And that’s pretty much what this is, a series of “Jingles” about Dysfunctional families trying to keep a stiff upper lip during the holidays; But if I’m being honest, that’s not the ONLY reason why I enjoyed the sketch. Having had to put up with the antics of my own dysfunctional family throughout my lifetime, this sketch (along with “Stuart Smalley”) proved to be decent coping mechanisms—but that’s a story for another day. The songs themselves are highly quotable, but by far my favorite one of these bits is Phil Hartman’s “Let’s Pretend we Like Each Other”. TRIVIA: Several years ago, Hallmark put out a couple Christmas cards with Audio Chips in them; this sketch and Steve Martin’s “Holiday Wish” were among the ones that SNL licensed out to Hallmark. I still have the “Dysfunctional” card in my basement, but because it’s been sitting there for so long, it’s now dysfunctional for a completely different reason.\n\nNOT GONNA PHONE IT IN TONIGHT (12/14/1991) – Whether you’re a Diehard Fan of the show or a Casual viewer, chances are you’ve seen this at one point in your lives (I’m sure), but for redundancy purposes, I’m not going to actually review the sketch per se (Quite honestly, it speaks for itself). Instead, I have a bit of a story about this sketch you may not have known…Strangely enough, if it weren’t for a little extra research I did, this sketch could’ve been a lot lower on the list. Why? Well, while brushing up on Shales/Miller, I came across a passage about this particular sketch that the authors saw fit to add—basically, the claim that the song was Based on the title track from a long-ago MGM musical called “Babes in Arms” (Which now that I think about it, might explain why there was a sketch with Carvey’s Mickey Rooney in the same episode…but I digress). It kinda surprised me that a moment on the show that has gone down in history as one of the most iconic pieces they ever did would actually be a lyrically re-worked piece from a pre-existing show. But then I saw the so-called “Source Material”, and I realized that the ONLY thing SNL copied from that was the whole “Gathering Crowd” dynamic, they didn’t borrow a Single Note from the song in Question. Seriously, Watch The Clip highlighted above, and Then Watch the so-called “Original”. There Is NO Comparison, and therefore, this piece is instantly vindicated because of such a stark difference…and What a difference; with the exception of a few contenders, I have not seen anything before or since that could galvanize an audience the way this opening did. At the same time, the song’s plea for the show to make a little effort once in a while might’ve made sense back then; but as history has shown us over time, 1991 was probably SNL at either the middle or the beginning of its second zenith (or maybe 3rd, depending on how you felt about the Ebersol years). Quality was high across the board in writing, performance, host, MGs, you name it…quite honestly, they didn’t start “Phoning it in” again until 1994—sure, Season 20, but also the latter half of Season 19 should’ve been a warning sign. If anything, this piece was the show’s chance to show off, get a little cocky, and pretty much say “Nothing’s gonna stop me”—except of course for overconfidence catching up to them a few years later, but they didn’t know at the time (what cocky person does, Mrs. Clinton?–Honorable mention, BTW). “Not gonna phone it in tonight”; one of SNL’s all-time showstopping original numbers.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nTHE INCREDIBLE MAN (1980) – Now HERE is a sketch that I’m almost certain NOBODY remembers (unless you still have your Season 5 DVD set). Short Answer: It’s “Canadian Wizard of Oz” sponsored by a Canadian Pharmaceutical company. Long Answer: It’s probably one of the most ambitious things SNL did in their first 5 years next to “The Pepsi Syndrome”; but perhaps a little TOO ambitious as they seem to go out of their way to make sure that their sound-alike songs are different enough so they don’t get sued by MGM. Nevertheless, this was probably one of the Original Cast’s first signs of a last hurrah on the horizon.\n\nTHE BENEFIT SONGS (1991-1997) – The “Benefit Song” sketch was a thing for a little while; we have to mention 1991’s “Musicians for Free Range Chickens” (One of the FEW sketches from the infamous Steven Segal Episode that I actually Liked), 1993’s “Recurring Characters for Unity” for breaking the most 4th walls in a single sketch, and 1997’s “Set Our Nanny Free” for being the last one they ever did…at least for now. There was another one from 1993 involving Michael Jordan’s first retirement, but those were parodies of existing songs. And while we’re on the subject of “Semi-Recurring”…\n\nTHE COWBOY SONGS (1989-1992) – I already mentioned the first one with Woody Harrelson back in November, but it bears repeating that this too was once a thing. In addition to Harrelson & company going on about being lonely, we were also treated to Kyle McLaughlin (as KD Lang) singing about the joys of cattle slaughter, Jeremy Irons being woefully miscast (FOOTAGE UNAVAILABLE), and Woody again talking about all the other kinds of “Boys” there are in addition to “Cow”…I’m sure it made more sense back then.\n\nDOGS (1992) – Whenever you think SNL has become too mainstream, there’s sometimes a rare flash of experimental material that keeps viewers on guard. This piece where Adam Sandler leads a “Seattle-Grunge” type band whose members exhibit certain canine qualities was one of those times where you wonder if you took some leftover acid from the 70s.\n\nDO IT ON MY TWIN BED (2013) – See 8/19/2016 entry.\n\nWISHING BOOT (2015) – I’m guessing Kate is supposed to be either Reba McEntire or Martina McBride, Aidy is supposed to be Wynona Judd, and host Blake Shelton is either supposed to be ½ of “Brooks & Dunn”, Alan Jackson, or whichever other country star has ample facial hair (Pick one). Despite the fact that the premise was pretty ridiculous—even by SNL Music Video standards—at least the song itself was both catchy and pretty uncanny to the country genre in general…which (unfortunately) I know all too well thanks to wasting 2 years of my life playing that stuff on the radio.\n\nAs always, I can’t help but feel like I’ve left a sketch or two out; feel free to comment below if I did, and I’ll squeeze it into a future “Viewer’s Choice” edition.\n\nNEXT WEEK/PROGRAM NOTE: We’ve still got 2 weeks to go until the Oscars, so we’re going to save our list of Movie Parodies for that day. In the meantime, We’re going to stay on the subject of Music…or rather “Lack Thereof” in this case. HOWEVER, because I’m gonna be out of town for President’s Day Weekend, this commentary will be out (I hope) on MONDAY 2/20. (NOTE: “Music Edits” Editorial has been PPD’d TFN. I’ll explain why later this weekend) Otherwise, as soon as I find out which “Vintage” airs this evening, I’ll see ‘ya tomorrow.\n\nLet’s just get this Over with (AKA Trump’s 2015 SNL Episode)\n\nWell folks, it happened. The “Poor little Rich Boy” got sworn in, he used his fancy pen set to sign a few papers, he is now (or at least, starting Monday…the Hell?) in charge of the Free World & the launch codes until/unless some sort of scandal/“Accident” takes him down and President Race Bannon (not to be confused with Racist Bannon) takes over…I’ll be honest; with the exception of the fact that I was hoping to grab a lot of views (as most fledgling web pages tend to do), I REALLY Didn’t Want to do this or any of the other sketches I already covered This Week…I Really Didn’t—especially since it only means more Publicity for Captain Combover (and for the record, I probably would’ve done the same thing for HRC this week, and STILL feel just as dirty for doing it). But, not only is it a matter of public record that the show you’re about to read about even took place over a Year ago–and I can’t argue with things that have clearly happened…unlike SOME people–but I would like to think of this as a much needed exercise in catharsis…even though this probably resulted in a thing that half the country DIDN’T WANT to have happen anyway. Unfortunately, it did—and All (or at least partially) thanks to the 21st century equivalent of Richard Nixon saying “Sock it To Me” (Incidentally, Another show Lorne Michaels worked for back in his youth). The strangest part about what you’re about to read is that Trump really appears for all of 18 minutes during the Entire show, and that most of the sketches (even the few Trump was in) were borderline decent. This is partly because when I first reviewed this show last year, I judged Trump strictly on the merits of him as a Host, and NOT as a (*GRITS TEETH*) Political Figure……Which also probably marks the Only time the words “Trump” & “Merits” will appear in the same sentence without me vomiting. What makes this episode PARTICULARLY Interesting is just how little video there is to show you form this (and did I mention that this episode only happened last year?), so in spite of the fact that this is supposed to be a detailed review, it seems like a bit of a hindrance that about 75% of the episode is unavailable online; because HEAVEN FORBID our……(*GRITS TEETH*)……President is embarrassed a little bit by the sight of him dancing in a Drake parody. So please bear with me as I try to do the best I can here without that many clips.\n\nNevertheless, the show must go on and I’ve put this off long enough—it’s time to take a look at the moment in American History where things… (*PERFORMS SIGN OF THE CROSS*) …Turned around for the Bulging Can of Orange Crush…\n\n(*DEJECTED SIGH*) President Donald Trump/Sia (Original Airdate: 11/7/2015)\n\nDEMOCRATIC FORUM: First thing’s first, Cecily as Maddow is a BRILLIANT casting choice and a Hell of a lot better impression than Abby Elliott ever attempted. Second, Taran’s piece was deservedly short. Third, Kate continues to play Hil to the Hilt—albeit briefly & with a bizarre shift in accents and casual sitting. And Fourth, WAY Too soon for Larry to come back…although (and I can’t believe I’m about to use a line he once wrote in totally different context) Not that there’s anything Wrong with that. He was still the unquestioned highlight of this, and he still delivered (Especially on his rants on Bridges, “Middle Class Coins”, and an Honest to God LFNY Variation that actually looks like it took effort). But still…there’s a whole YEAR left to go before the election. I wasn’t kidding when I said “Pace Yourself”, Larry—Burn out too soon, and you won’t “Bern” as well in the future. The extra bits with randomly cutting to a black person in the audience was slightly awkward, but I got the joke.\n\nSCORE: 8 out of 10 Bricks of Vermont’s Cabot Cheddar.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: Already, I’m miss Kate doing HRC—but thankfully, she’s a Hell of a lot more versatile elsewhere, so I wouldn’t worry about her star being on the decline anytime soon. And yes, Larry coming back immediately after debuting the Sanders impression was a little overkill. But afterwards, he only showed up every few months—so it was OK\n\nMONOLOGUE: I honestly don’t know how to judge this one fairly. Granted, I’ll give ‘em credit for the Rosie/Aidy joke…and the inevitable Taran (and Hammond!) match-up…and Larry stealing the scene at the end was a good $5000 exclamation point. But as long as Trump continues to verbally masturbate about how great he thinks he is, it’s pretty difficult to be impartial here. As long as it’s brief enough, there’s no singing/audience questions, and the other jokes were there to balance things out, I’ll give it a pass.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 Italian Marble Bathrooms in a Single apartment at Trump Tower (The extra point’s for Larry’s sake).\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE: Probably a little TOO generous there. As much as I appreciate Brevity & some more Larry, all this turned out to be was an exercise in vanity. I’d probably just give it a 6 now because, at the very least, Trump isn’t there for long. As for that “$5000” comment, the ACLU was promising people who attended $5K if someone in the audience shouted that Trump was a Racist; and although Larry David did it for the sake of comedy, the ACLU still honored the rules. Larry has since donated the money to an unspecified charity…Which I guess also counts as a point in Trump’s favor since he’s indirectly responsible for something benefiting the common good—for a change. Still have millions of points to make up, Donny!\n\nREVISED SCORE: 6 out of 10\n\nTRUMP IN 2018: Somewhere, former comedy writer/David Letterman’s old flame Merill Markoe must be pouring herself some celebratory wine for Predicting this sketch…sort of. Just about everybody involved had at least one decent line—though nothing that brought the house down. Cecliy’s Melania improves greatly by being more Russian than “vague foreigner”, Kenan had a good one about Syria being a Casino country, Kyle makes his only Major appearance the whole night with minimal results. The Sasheer/Omarosa joke was incredibly dated*, but still the best joke of the whole thing. The bit between Beck & Trump on Mexico (though funny) must’ve REALLY gone over well with the protesters outside—he says sarcastically. No Applause for the Real Ivanka…Nice touch (Either that or she & Vanessa Bayer could be interchangeable and no one’s the wiser). We then get the first of Many 4th wall breaks tonight with Trump’s speech at the end, which may seem a little distracting at first, but as time marches on in the show it’s actually kinda refreshing to see. Not “Ha-Ha” funny, but at least Trump got his “ego stroke” sketch out of the way early.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 Trump apartment buildings that line up along Riverside Drive in NYC.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: It’ll be interesting to see just how prophetic things will be in 2 years’ time [*aside from Omarosa being a part of Trump’s staff now…so much for being “dated”]…if we don’t turn into puddles of nuclear waste first—but not even the best of satire is That good at predicting the future…at least, not usually.\n\nBAD GIRLS: A lot of people want to call this a “Three-quel” to “Do it on my Twin Bed”; But since Aidy isn’t referred to by her “Lil’ Baby” nickname here, I’ll instead call it an inverted Sequel to “Say What you Want to Say” last February (Besides, with Elizabeth Banks on the following week, It’d be more fitting to do a Twin Bed Three-quel with her…and not even then). And really, it’s almost exactly the same film as February…only the opposite—both in plot and in atmosphere. This time, Instead of Mild Mannered girls being uncharacteristically spontaneous to a Sara Barellis song, it’s pretty much whatever the opposite of Sara Barellis is here. Nevertheless, The cinematography for filmed pieces continues to amaze, the ladies are workin’ it like nobody’s business, Things were going well altogether………. until Kate dealt with…uh…her “Lady business” with her sock. Be that as it may, the rest of the ladies did their respective parts well, and Aidy was the best of the bunch.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 Sheep in Wolves clothing (Think about that one a little)\n\nLIVE TWEETING A SKETCH: I really have no idea why people are fawning over this sketch, it kinda feels like the cast is trapped in their own version of Jimmy Kimmel’s “Mean Tweets” segment…only without (overly) famous people…or the ability to laugh at themselves. I’ll give them credit for rampant 4th wall breaking and experimenting with an otherwise unique idea, but this was still awkward as hell in most places (Especially the Kenan slams…That’s right folks, I actually feel SORRY for Kenan in a sketch.). To be fair, Kenan, Vanessa & Jonesy helped the sketch save face…Otherwise, this is probably the first “uncomfortable” sketch of the season.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 Twitter “Fail Whales”\n\nEDITORS NOTE: Twitter, That’s ANOTHER thing to add to the “Blame” list—seriously, if they were to save a little face, they would come up with a Robocop-esque “Directive 4” that disallows its use by political figures on the condition that they will only be banned from it While serving their time in office and/or while running for re-election…Trump would probably last only 3 days as President if that were the case, but let’s get back to the “Real” world. Trump only appears for the first 30 seconds in this sketch, yet his influence is EVERYWHERE…Why do I see that as a metaphor for things to come?\n\nHOTLINE BLING (DRAKE): Another filmed piece so soon? Well, at least it’s better than “Bad Girls”…largely because that new Drake video is Low-Hanging fruit in terms of things to make fun of. Not only that, but they get Trump to do (probably) his one token “embarrassing” thing of the night as the Tax Accountant dancing and “Singing”, AND they get friggin’ Martin Short to do an Ed Grimley walk-on to help save the day. Jay’s Drake was par for the course; but considering just how lame the Real video is, Jay actually does it better here—some of his best work, actually—so in that spirit, it’s a solid parody………Even if some OTHER Sketch show has made fun of “Dad Dancing” almost 2 decades Prior to this.\n\nSCORE: 8 out of 10 times Julia Louis Dreyfus can think “I can move better than That”.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: Seriously, Trump “Dad Dancing” doesn’t even make a ripple…granted, acting like a doofus is better than acting like a p***y-grabber, so I can understand if few people noticed. Also, Martin Short must be feeling both thankful & terrified that he’s a Canadian citizen right about now who inadvertently added fuel to the fire.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nColin’s Best: Condom Bill\n\nMichael’s Best: KC Beats the Mets, Taco Bell\n\nCommentaries: This week’s mini-comment on Ben Carson tried a little too hard to smear—and the “Birther” joke at the end was too subtle to be subtle. Jonsey has a rare miss this time around, though I liked Colin’s attempt to “Flirt”. Drunk Uncle (who I thank for saving the day here clip-wise) comes back after a seemingly long time, though I’d be lying if I didn’t think this was the most coherent he’s been…Ever. Doesn’t mean that the bit is any different comedy-wise, but at least he’s a more energetic drunk this time (guessing by mixing Vodka with Red Bull)—I also thank him for pointing out who SHOULD be playing Ben Carson in the future…That is, if Che actually Wants to be in sketches.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 KSHB’s (NBC In Kansas City, MO—Way to Go, Royals!)\n\nEDITORS NOTE: Nothing really, though I have to mention that The Kansas City Royals won the World Series that year…which at the time was about as unfathomable as the Cubs Winning it (oh, wait…), and lest we remind everybody that 2015 was Supposed to be the year that happened—F***ing Mets!\n\nBAR BAND (no video): (*DRINKS BOTTLE OF SCOTCH AS I STRUGGLE TO FIND THE RIGHT WORDS TO SAY*) I’m noticing a LOT of Silver linings in sketches so far tonight—which is ironic because Trump is synonymous with Gold. The ONE thing I can say about this sketch that’s positive is that—amazingly enough—Trump’s fake anger actually works to his advantage here. That’s right, Trump is Actually the Highlight of this sketch……(*CHUGS MORE SCOTCH*)……sad, I know. Of course, it doesn’t help matters that Kenan is headlining a sketch with annoying voices and a premise goes completely nowhere…guess what That means (whoops, wrong “Anderson”…but still somewhat relevant).\n\nSCORE: 4 out of 10 Dive Bars desperate for entertainment on a Weekday night.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: No, James Anderson & Kent Sublette [AKA “Anderlette”] Did NOT write this sketch…at least, I don’t THINK they did. Sketches like these are usually the responsibility of one man alone—co-head writer Bryan Tucker. Seriously, that’s like one of his trademarks; sketches where there’s a large group of people and either each of them has one “wacky” thing about themselves, or the group is normal except for One “Odd one out”. Throw in “[KENAN REACTS]”, and the set-up is complete. Only one thing comes to mind whenever I see a sketch written by Tucker, and I’m gonna let Mr. Carlin take it from here…an insult that also works with one Mr. Carlson on the Fake News Channel\n\nMR. CROCKER (no video): This is what I’d like to call a “Bruce McCullough” moment; A film so dry in humor, that even though it’s trying hard to be funny, perhaps it’s trying TOO hard. I also stand corrected in that Trump actually does TWO “embarrassing” roles tonight; The “Drake” video, and this seedy Music producer he’s playing here—or at least it would’ve been embarrassing if Trump didn’t look so natural at being seedy & didn’t give a shit that he was. Trump aside, this was All about Beck and how absurd this premise was. Unfortunately, there are times when Beck seems to want to give a Ferrell-esque performance here when he should’ve had more of a chance to be himself. Oh well, at least the Autotune bit & his varying degrees of freaking out were funny.\n\nSCORE: 6 out of 10 Vocoders.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: I actually have nothing extra to say for this one…except this MIGHT become autobiographical somehow in the next 4 years…just wait.\n\nSidebar: I’m not gonna count the “Toots” interlude as an actual sketch, but because everybody must be in denial as they’re watching this episode (myself included), I’ll throw in a few Bonus Points at the end for all the 4th wall breaks this evening…including this one…\n\nEDITORS NOTE: “Toots & the Maytals” was the musical guest from when a less-crazy Trump hosted in 2004……….Yeah, I don’t know any of their songs either. Interestingly enough, when trying to find the video for this bit, I came across This screen:\n\nI guess this means Trump was practicing wiping people off the face of the earth even back then, but I digress…)\n\nPORNSTARS FOR TRUMP: And just when you think this sketch has run itself into the ground, they managed to pull off yet another unexpected twist. The porn puns were off the charts on this one…not for actual humor, but for the fact that there were WAY too many of them to keep track of at 1AM (Off the top of my head, “Marco Rubio/Polo”, “Putin/Put it in” and “Yankee Doodle Handy”). On top of that, Bobby’s Trump actually Sounds better than Taran’s—but unless the Real Trump gains weight, I don’t see Bobby stealing the Trump role any time soon. The beyond subtle Clinton joke at the end easily makes this Pornstar instalment one of the top 3. Then, Trump then breaks the 4th wall Yet again in an effort to make sure the state of Iowa is fast asleep.\n\nSCORE: 8 out of 10 porn sites that have variations on the word “Tube” in their names………………God, I’m lonely.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: The ONE sketch of the episode that actually felt “Normal”\n\nBONUS POINTS:\n\n+4 for All the “4th Wall” breaks tonight…it HAS to be a record of some kind.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 71 out of 100 (71% WATCHABLE)\n\nREVISED SCORE: 70 out of 100…but then I eventually come to my senses and REVOKE the Bonus points no matter how much 4th walling goes on here. So, 66 out of 100 (66% WATCHABLE…which is actually—shockingly–still better than most of the shows that season)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: The cynic in me honestly doesn’t know what to make of this show. A lot of us seem to have pre-conditioned ourselves to think this would be disastrous; when in actuality, there wasn’t that much to worry about (And how often have we made THAT assumption before?). However, If ever there was an occasion for SNL to make Lemons out of Lemonade, This was the time. On the other hand (to put it Nautically), For a show that had a Shipload of Hype attached to it, all that remains was only a rowboat’s worth of comedy. That said, Trump himself was—once again—OK as a host. He’s no Lawrence Oliver by ANY means and I’m STILL not gonna vote for the guy, but at least he was capable and (Miraculously) not as overbearing as many of us feared. The cast may have fought heaven & earth to hide their not-so obvious misery in this adventure in audience pandering/protester dodging, but at least they still got through it with professionalism. I also think I haven’t seen this many 4th wall breaks on the show since Francis Ford Coppola in ’86. One thing’s for sure, if Trump wins any states in the Primaries, this episode can now theoretically share in the blame………………\n\nEDITORS NOTE: Well, now I can add the Presidency to that statement. On the surface, considering how little Trump appeared on the show, it really shouldn’t have been that big a deal…and yet, as much as I don’t want to believe it, this episode was a Turning point—for better or Far, FAR worse. Not just for Trump’s campaign, but for the fact that SNL has to feel Something for opening up Pandora’s Box; which would probably explain all the Pro-Hillary sketches they wound up pumping out afterwards. It almost feels like their way of saying (*SLIPS INTO “HYPER CHILD” VOICE*) “OH SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIIIIIIIIIIIIITTTTTTT! We’re Sorry, America, we’resorrywe’resorrywe’resorrywe’resorrywe’resorry, OMIGOD We’resorry!” (*SLIPS OUT OF VOICE*) But alas, the damage was done, it was their highest rated show of the season, and they pretty much sold their soul in order to get it. Yeah, if you take away the underlying tone of the whole thing, the episode was average—but average at a price. And besides; with the exception of some cosmetic differences, how is my scrawling away about Trump sketches for the sake of more views Any different from what the people on the 17th Floor did for Nielsen Ratings? It really isn’t, and if that makes me a hypocrite, then I’m guilty as charged…………(*STARES WISTFULLY IN THE DISTANCE*)……Guilty as Charged………(*SNAPS OUT OF IT*)…..once again, I’ve lost the focus, so let’s wrap this up. Life (and the show) must go on, and while we eagerly await to scrutinize the rotted box of “Halos’” first mistake (as President), we’ve got some stuff to take care of for February—Home to three of the biggest events in the world; The Grammys, The Oscars…and a certain “Big Game”.\n\nNEXT TIME (Possibly the first week of February and Pending other Retro Reviews): Sports of all Sorts as we present the top SNL Sports sketches (IMO). In the meantime, Enjoy Aziz Ansari Tonight. As for me, I could go for something with a high alcohol content…Uncle Jemima Mash Liquor, perhaps? It’s gonna be a LONG 4 years (if even that). Thanks for sticking around this week, and again, I am incredibly Sorry for putting you through this………Thank GOD for Pointless Nostalgia (*CHUGS BOTTLE OF JACK “BLUTO” STYLE*).\n\nDon’t worry, everybody…some day we’ll go back to some semblance of “Normal”\n\nGet Me a Soda…\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE 10/31/2016: So, about the title of this entry. It seems as though some people are complaining about it, to which I offer this reason: For the uninitiated; Back when Tracy was a cast member on the show, he would appear in a number of sketches where he’s seen chatting backstage with whoever was hosting that week. The punchline to these sketches would always be Lorne showing up telling Tracy to leave the host alone, to which Tracy would reply…well, you know. My apologies in advance if this title rubs certain people the wrong way, but it was either this or “I’m gonna take you behind the middle school & get you Pregnant”. In the end, it was a shorter title, and I want to get to the point.\n\nWell, it looks like you’re getting a Two-fer this week (not affiliated with “Toofer” from “30 Rock). It Figures, I do a List, and an “SNL Vintage” episode pops up the same day. Not only that, but probably one of my favorite episodes from Last Year; the one where my “Close personal friend (Trademark Pending)” Tracy Morgan comes back after recovering from his 2014 accident. The nostalgia Goggles were on pretty tight in this review—which I originally wrote for “The Place that no longer exists” Back in October 2015…and unlike the previous Christopher Walken review, these thoughts are up to date—give or take a thing or two:\n\nTracy Morgan/Demi Lovato – Original Airdate: 10/17/2015\n\nDEMOCRATIC DEBATE: (EDITORS NOTE: Yes, I know, I already mentioned this sketch in the debates list, but for the sake of authenticity, the following were the Original thoughts on the sketch in question.) HO-LY SHIT………….They actually got Baldwin to show up! Oh, and Larry David is there too……..(*SPIT TAKE*) WHAT THE WHAT?! I know people have been making comparisons between Bernie & Larry forever, but the fact that they were actually able to convince him to do it is just…………..I’m speechless…In a GOOD Way. And considering how much he’s dominating over everybody here, I have to hope beyond hope that this is a One-time appearance. Because once you go big like this, it’s gonna be damn near impossible to top—Though if he Does show up again, at least have the courtesy to do so during February Sweeps, Pace yourself. Everybody else (Baldwin included) was icing on the cake and contributed what seems like a small amount in comparison. This was ALL Larry, Some Kate, a Little Baldwin, a sliver of Taran & Mooney, and J.R. was just there to serve with a rather weak Anderson Cooper (which, BTW, is the ONLY thing keeping me from giving this a Perfect 10). Yeah, there were actual jokes being told here, but I feel the need to quote David Letterman when Johnny Carson made a post-retirement appearance on his show…”What’s The Point? Like I’m gonna continue after that!”\n\nSCORE: 9 out of 10 sketches Larry Wrote that got cut during his one year as a writer—revenge must be sweet tonight.\n\nMONOLOGUE: One of the rare “Pure Sentimentality” moments that just happens to have light-hearted “Glad you’re OK” jokes…oh, and the Principal cast of “30 Rock” (and 1/4th of ”Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”, Jane) in tow. Thankfully for a recent Netflix binge, this was made all the more sweeter to watch. Almost 4 years after it went off the air, and they haven’t missed a beat—although the aspect of it being Live vs. Taped kinda gave things a “forced” feeling in some places. And yes, it kinda feels like a cheat having all these guest stars on to “Help” Tracy, but as long as they don’t overstay their welcome, they Are welcome. That being said, I know it was 4 years ago, but does ANYBODY remember “Smash” or “Animal Practice”? NBC must be counting their blessings they have “The Voice”, Football & Strong Dramas now. Back to Tracy, he hasn’t missed a beat, he has good friends cheering him on all the way, and I think we can finally say with confidence that he’s gonna be OK. Welcome Home, Indeed.\n\nSCORE: 9 out of 10 times a day I yell “I AM A JEDI!!”\n\nFAMILY FEUD: Impressions, Assemble…(*CRICKETS*)…Wait, it’s a NON celebrity edition? Oh…OK, fair enough, variety’s a good thing…And I have to admit that this is an interesting angle that’s not quite on the same level as 1991’s “dysfunctional” edition (Which I’ll talk about in future weeks), but there are some elements of dysfunction on display. Jonesy manages to find a rare role that’s only Partially Yelling, and still manages to get through it with dignity & grace. Best parts include Che’s defection, Tracy & Sasheer’s Car Wash/Stripping conversation, and the “Pulling out” punchline. I do credit them greatly for doing a Civilian version of a Feud sketch, it shows that the writers are still willing to take tried & true ideas and put them in new directions…just give Kenan a few more lessons on how to “Act” like Steve Harvey, and you’ve got gold.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 Cities where Feud is Beating “Wheel of Fortune” in the ratings.\n\nBRIAN FELLOWS: I think the entire collection of SNL fans on the Western Hemisphere would’ve Revolted if this didn’t happen tonight. For the record, I never really got the appeal of these sketches, but what the heck, the Nostalgia Goggles are secured tightly. Though, is it just me, or does Tracy seem a little…uh…Meaner this time around? Usually he acts a little goofy before going off on his guests, but this time around he looks perpetually pissed. The added twist of everybody having thought bubbles at the end was kinda clever. Add to that a camera blocking blooper with the camel (though it would’ve been funnier if it “Accidentally” Spit instead…seriously, it looked like it was ready to do so), and it’s just another day in the life of the world’s most unlikely animal lover.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 vials of Lip Gloss required to visit the zoo.\n\nMITCHELL’S FAKE COCAINE: And an early “What the Hell did I Just Watch?” nominee for the year has just been revealed. Every once in a while, a sketch comes on that can only be described as “Handey-esque”. Something that is so densely layered and nonsensical at the same time that, of course, the initial reaction to seeing it the first time around is an unqualified “Wha?” Just the notion of the product’s purpose is strange enough, but THEN you add the “Fake Poop Spray” angle and “Wha?” turns into “The Hell?!” Follow that up with Beck dropping a deuce in Jonesy’s bedroom, and you ultimately wind up with something too hard to define clearly…Though I would be lying if I didn’t think Jonesy’s last second shout reminded me a little of Eddie Murphy in “Trading Places” (“Who’s been putting out their Kools on My Floor?!”). After seeing this several times, I only have more questions than answers.\n\nSCORE: 5 out of 10 pieces of Fake Vomit needed after accidentally smelling Fake Poop Spray.\n\nUPDATE: (Part 1 Here, Part 2 There.)\n\nColin’s Best: California Wildfires\n\nMichael’s Best: Oscar Pistorius, Playboy (just cause it’s an easy joke)\n\nCommentaries: The mini-rant on Trump & Carson misfired in a few places, but there were still a few good lines (Nick Cannon, Carly Fiorina). Tina delivers another instalment of “Women’s News” and rightfully puts Playboy in its place—arm butts, awkward poses and all. Then the Mini-comment on the “Mysterious Object” in Space was just……strange….even by the strangest of standards. And then Kenan continues convince us that “Willie” is funny, except this time it was slightly disturbing…and THEN, freakin’ Woodrow randomly shows up—and I do mean “Randomly”. I mean, 15 years it’s been since we’ve seen Tracy do it, and This is how they bring him back? Don’t get me wrong, it was still a nice surprise, but even after all this time, we STILL have no idea what his deal is…and will remain one of the show’s great mysteries.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 WSMV’s (NBC in Nashville, TN)\n\nTHE LOVLIEST KINGDOM: (EDITORS NOTE: No Video or Transcript, but considering this was the weakest sketch of the show, maybe we’re better off) Even though this CLEARLY has (Writers/constant thorns in my side) James Anderson & Kent Sublette’s fingerprints all over it, Tracy’s lines (Especially “I Wrote a Sonnet about Titties”) is not only a saving grace, but also—quite possibly—the line of the year so far. Not because of the line itself by any means, but because of the overly gleeful way Tracy delivered it (Not unlike “Houston, we have a DOG!” 7 years ago). That being said, Gay jokes are one thing, but as far as near-pedophilic material goes…well…yeah, I’ve seen bigger derailments on AmTrak. At least the rest of the cast’s energy was enough of a counterbalance to keep things neutral.\n\nSCORE: 5 out of 10 lands far, far away…where pedophiles can be imprisoned.\n\nTHE STANDOFF: Like many things, this could’ve gone in a number of directions. And like many things, they decide to go with the least likely, most absurd and most out-of-left-field one……………Just like a certain OTHER short film about a Tough guy dancing tried to accomplish (and I’m glad I’m not the Only one around here who thinks so.). But to be fair, the situation here is FAR different than what Schiller, Schneider & Farley did in ’93. For starters, this was shot in HD and nobody’s in Jail seeking revenge. That aside, Tracy does most of the metaphorical footwork here by giving us a very “Dramatic” yet still Comedic performance—probably the deepest thing he’s done since “Woodrow”, and the ballet shoes were an odd touch. The premise is still somewhat ridiculous, and Taran & Sasheer seem to be in agreement. This probably would’ve been funnier if we actually got to see a full dance number between Tracy & Taran, but I guess “Less is More” prevails.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 grueling hours of choreography by Bob Fosse—on the condition he comes back to life to do it.\n\nWHERE’S JACKIE CHAN AT RIGHT NOW: A 2nd “What the Hell did I Just Watch?” nominee for the year has just revealed itself. Only this time, it was more “Random” than “Dense”. I honestly don’t know which was the more ridiculous part; the Parade of seemingly random impressions, or the line “We Won a Peabody!” That being said, those who did impressions (Especially Jay’s Chris Tucker, Taran’s Owen Wilson & Bobby’s Steven Segal) made up for lost time…I’d also add Sasheer playing the late Lynne “Chief” Thigpen to the list if it wasn’t so awkward. As for Tracy & Kenan, their motivations for trying to “Find” Jackie Chan seem directionless at best—based on how they’re dressing, it looks like the want to find Chan so they could take him on or something. Then again, if they simply looked him up on IMDB instead of Googling, the sketch would be over in about 12 seconds…but that would be too easy. Of the two “Bizarre” sketches this episode, at least this one made me laugh.\n\nSCORE: 7 out of 10 Movies Chan is currently filming…I’m not kidding, look at his IMDB page.\n\nASTRONAUT JONES: (EDITORS NOTE: Surprisingly, no clip is available, but then again if you’ve seen one episode of Astronaut Jones, you’ve seen ‘em all) Take it away, M. Night Shyamalan. Everything I said about “Brian Fellows” earlier can easily be said about this too, SO Glad they were able to make time for this tonight. It’s still a one joke premise, and it always will be. But once again…Nostalgia goggles—Though I do like the additional twist of a brief homage to “The Martian”. It almost doesn’t matter that Tracy messed up a couple of lines near the end, but I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t criticize…though to be fair, losing a lot of dialogue while the pretty alien girl delivers her speech is kinda the sketch’s main joke (aside from Tracy asking the girl—Ms. Lovato in this case—to take it off), so I’ll forgive it. I can’t think of a better way to wrap up this show.\n\nSCORE: 8 out of 10 Glacial pools on Mars NASA has yet to discover.\n\nBONUS POINTS:\n\n+1 for Rolling out the Red Carpet (Probably one of my Favorite Host bumpers of all time)\n\nFINAL SCORE: 72 out of 100 (72% WATCHABLE)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Hands Down, the Best show in the past 3 years, easily—I don’t think I’ve rated a show this high since Martin Short/Paul McCartney in 2012. There were plenty of “Feel good” moments to be had, but if you were to take away the weight of Tracy’s return (Including the Open mind, Kid gloves & Nostalgia goggles I mentioned at the top of the review Plus the cameos) it would still be slightly above average. Any doubts that Tracy would falter were thrown away the moment he took the stage–or possibly as early as when the Promos came out this week—and (with apologies to Samberg) he did it Like a Boss. Of course, it certainly helps that Larry David (and others) was quite the insurance policy. Nevertheless, this night was all about Tracy and his chance to tell the world that it’s gonna take more than an accident to keep him down, and he’s more than welcome to come back again & again. The ONLY bad things I can say about an episode this good is that (1) it’ll be difficult to top—especially w/Captain Combover hosting next time*, and (2) it’s going to set one hell of a curve for the rest of the year to live up to.\n\n*”He who shall not be named” wound up hosting the next episode.\n\nUPDATED THOUGHTS: One Year Later, this show STILL holds up, it Still acts as a welcome wave of nostalgia, and it’s still a genuinely funny show—with a couple exceptions. Seeing Taran & Jay on screen once again felt a little bittersweet, though I wish I could say the same for J.R. (seriously, you call THAT an “Anderson Cooper” impression, Alex Mofatt did better than that, and he probably used his regular voice too). Although the inclusion of about 50% of the “30 Rock” cast was a nice bonus, Tracy did most of the grunt work and did it well. It almost makes me wish He won the “Guest Actor” Emmy this year, but whata’ya gonna do?\n\nTOMORROW: Another S.O.S.N.L. entry for Halloween, but this one will honor a True Pioneer of the Horror Genre. And now, because it’s still Halloweekend, let’s end this review with some good old fashioned “Werewolf Bar Mitzvah”…\n\nTales from the 17th Floor: The Top 8-ish SNL “Scary” sketches (REVISITED)\n\nMWAHHH-HA-HA-HA-HA!!\n\nSorry, maniacal laughter doesn’t translate well in the printed form. Anyway, welcome to Halloweekend (Because—let’s face it—who wants to celebrate it on a Monday?), and with all the trickin’, treatin’ and unlikely “sexy” costumes there is to offer, I’ve reached the point in my life where it’s all played out vis a vis wearing an “Adult” costume; but at the same time, I still want to mark the occasion in a way that doesn’t involve vandalism. So with that, this week’s list is going to look at some of the times SNL made us laugh by playing up the “Scary” angle.\n\nCRITERIA: Sketches that aired in the month of October get an Automatic berth; otherwise, if the premise of the sketch involves Halloween or something/someone “Scary” in general, it counts. As usual, no recurring stuff allowed—so, as much as I WANT to include Irwin Mainway, Lovitz’s Devil, “Goth Talk”, any other pre-existing character’s Halloween sketches, or Bill Hader’s “Vincent Price” sketches among others, as always it would be too easy to do. Further; as a bit of a time saving measure, you are going to see a couple of entries that I have already featured on the main S.O.S.N.L. Page. If you want to read about them again, just look for the Date of the entry that I give you—In short, this is less a “Top 8” list, and more of a “Top 7 & 1/4ths List”. Other than that, let’s go Trick or Treating…\n\nEDITOR’S NOTE (10/27/18): Sorry to interrupt, but something has been bugging me in the 2 years since I first posted this, and that something is gonna be addressed right now…\n\n8. DAVID S. PUMPKINS (10/22/2016) – By all accounts and purposes, this sketch should NEVER have worked. In some of the interviews I’ve seen/read either with Hanks, Mikey Day or Bobby Moynihan, they all seem to agree more or less that the sketch should NEVER have worked (as evident in this Oral History article I found)…And yet somehow, through some sort of benevolent force against nature, not only did the sketch work, but it has since taken on a life of its own. Sales of Pumpkin patterned suit Jackets went through the roof, it became a Funko Pop doll, NBC’s marketing machine cranked out stuff to sell at their various stores; and yes, it even became an animated TV Special that all but negated the original sketch’s goodwill (IMO, it was just “OK”, nothing worth repeating). All because of something that SHOULD. NEVER. HAVE. WORKED…and still, it did………………..any questions? In all seriousness, the sketch was (and remains) goofy fun; if they didn’t exploit the shit out of the sketch, it would probably rank a little higher–but leave it to NBC to milk something dry.\n\nDEVIL CAN’T WRITE NO LOVE SONG (11/13/1999) – Ah, Garth Brooks…A lot of us thought he was gonna be the kind of person who would host SNL Multiple times for years & years…….And then, Tina Fey had to Ruin it for Everybody…but that’s NOT what this is about. This is about Will Ferrell pretty much selling the shit out of his (Figuratively & Literally) densely layered performance as one Mr. B.L. Zebub while Garth stares at him in disbelief over just how crappy a songwriter he is. The sketch itself is ok, but when you see the kind of Makeup job Ferrell put himself through just to perform here, that alone is worth the price of admission (Just ask Kate McKinnon).\n\nEXORCIST II (12/13/1975) – Just mentioned this a few weeks ago on the Main Page; see it again on the “10/11/2016” entry…”YOUR MAMA SEWES SOCKS THAT SMELL!!” (Which I’m just NOW realizing almost rhymes with “Sucks C***s in Hell”…cute.)\n\n(TIE) THE COTERIE OF SINISTER INTRUDERS & HALLOWEEN CANDY (10/25/2013) – Halloween episodes are guaranteed at least One memorable sketch…Edward Norton’s show in 2013 has the benefit of having two. ”Sinister Intruders” pretty much said it all when they got to the fake NYT Blurb; “You had me at ‘Wes Anderson’”. This was a pretty spot on spoof of all of his movies, right down to the use of a Paul Simon soundtrack. Norton did an uncanny Owen Wilson, Alec Baldwin’s appearance was a nice bonus—though by the time the sketch aired, Baldwin signed some sort of Exclusivity deal with NBC (a deal that must’ve ended recently if he were to host “Match Game” on ABC, but I digress). Even Non-Wes Anderson fans will enjoy this one without saying “I Don’t get it”. As for “Candy”, Although this is TECHNICALLY a re-hash of a sketch Steve Buscemi did two years earlier (only for Michael Keaton to do Again 2 years later), It hasn’t repeated enough times in order for it to warrant the “Recurring” label…also, this is the ONLY one of these types of sketches to air on Halloween, so…screw it, it counts. I always enjoy a good non-sequitur or two…enty, especially in this sketch–largely because there does not seem to be any rhyme or reason of a plot other than to show off certain items in an otherwise amusing way…which, to be honest, can be hit or miss. Don’t get me wrong, this WAS Funny…but there are other questions to ask while watching this–Is Norton channeling John Waters and/or Kevin Spacey in his performance? Is Bobby playing an extension of his “Kitty Guy” with the Diego character? Is Aidy channeling Kathy Bates while playing “Adult Ruth”? Tune in Never to find out the answers to these questions.\n\nTHE OintMENt (10/30/1976) – I spelled it that way on purpose because They spelled it that way too. Anyway, at the time, the show was still trying to refine themselves as a movie parody factory—this was a step in the right direction, give or take a little mis-casting (Sorry Buck Henry, but only Gregory Peck can be Gregory Peck). For the most part, this was a pretty decent parody of “The Omen” (Which was released in the same year, so points for being relevant). But what put this over the top (Aside from the twist that Belushi’s “Damien” is the byproduct of both Satan and……a Dog?) was a series of rapid-fires between Buck, Aykroyd as the put-upon priest & the about to quit Chevy. I know I gave Chevy a lot of Shit a few weeks ago, but the one thing I’ll credit him for in this sketch is just how well timed some of the exchanges are.\n\n*This was the same episode as the infamous “Samurai Stockbroker” incident, Everybody was wearing a Bandage by the end of the episode in solidarity.\n\nDARK SHADOWS (12/15/1979) – Believe it or not, this was the first sketch I saw that had Gilda Radner In it. What’s more; I first saw this sketch on the 1994 edition of their Halloween specials, which was actually a rerun of one hosted by Carvey & Myers as Wayne & Garth a few years earlier (“PEOPLE GET KILLED BY MUNG!”). So back then, you could say this was a “formative” sketch to see—because up to that point my ONLY knowledge of the so-called “classic” years were Aykroyd, Chevy, Jane & Murray—this was essentially a crash course in just how sweetly versatile Gilda was…especially in a sketch like this where her ability to play a child works to her advantage. I’m gonna go out on a limb and say that Alan Zweibel is co-responsible for this sketch along with Gilda (after all, she’s the lead & He’s [supposedly] the knife wielding maniac at the end), but don’t quote me. Part of the reason why this worked so well was the escalating fears Gilda was experiencing, and the escalating reactions both Jane & (host) Martin Sheen had in return—especially once we got to the random Gypsy camp living under Gilda’s bed and the parents treating it as if it was a normal thing…I always liked “just because” jokes like that. Of course that final scene with Gilda finding that Zweibel-looking killer in the closet was what gave it the biggest laugh of the sketch, and probably SNL’s Longest at that point.\n\nTRICK OR TREAT (10/25/2008) – Once again; See the Main Page, look for the “8/1/16” entry…Seriously, this might’ve been Forte at his SNL peak (To this day, I’m still a little squeamish about “Potato Chip Thief”).\n\nCHRISTOPHER LEE’S HORROR MOVIE TRAILERS (3/25/1978) – Although this was part of his Monologue, just the fact that a Monster Movie Maestro like Christopher Lee ever hosted the show At All is a feat in itself. But then after a seemingly self-deprecating monologue where Lee complains that he keeps getting Z-Grade movie scripts to things like “The Creature from the Black Studies Program” et. al., we are then treated to further examples of said Z-Grade horror movies; including the legendary Belushi piece, “The Thing that Wouldn’t Leave”. But while that piece is the most iconic part of the collection, it’s not the funniest. First as an appetizer, we get a Dr. Moreau parody in the form of “The Island of Lost Luggage”; which, when you combine Garrett being fiendish, Larraine letting out a decent scream, and Gilda giving a hunchback some Roseannadanna DNA, the parody is capable enough. Then Belushi pretty much playing a version of himself much to Murray and (Especially) Jane’s dismay—hilarity ensues. But for me, the best one was the 3rd Parody—a Jekyll & Hyde piece where Aykroyd plays Vincent Price as the Doctor who drinks the potion–despite more screaming from Larraine—as the piece evolves into “Dr. Jekyll & MR. ROGERS”. For whatever reason, the audience loses its mind over the reveal, and who could blame them? All 3 trailers are made more special thanks to the over-the-top trailer voice that Writer/sometime performer Tom Davis gave in each of the pieces (and thanks to fellow WordPresser “Hot off the Press” for that tidbit). Of course, this was just ONE moment of simulated scares from a classic episode—if the Entire episode was nothing but Horror homages, I would probably have the episode itself as number one. Unfortunately, those moments were more scattered throughout and are forced to occupy a few “Honorable” spots……\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nTWO OTHER CHRISTOPHER LEE SKETCHES: First, “Mr. Death”; a little girl (Larraine, again) befriends the grim reaper…I could’ve sworn this became an idea for a “Cartoon Network” show years later—Oh, Wait…The other is a sketch where Lee essentially plays “Van Helsing” in an effort to stop Richard Nixon from publishing his Memoirs……..It made more sense back then. There’s also a good story in the updated Shales/Miller book about how Gilda almost played the girl in “Death”, but because Larraine threatened to quit over that casting, she wound up taking that part from her—pretty shrewd.\n\nCOLD AS ICE BY GARY WEIS: One more from the Lee episode, only this time veteran actor Stacy Keach is seen getting attacked by a beautiful woman while the song by Foreigner plays…….This too must’ve made more sense back then—and it also makes me wonder why this episode aired in March of that year, instead of it belonging more obviously in October.\n\nTHE FRUITING (1987): One of my Favorite SNL “Bait & Switches”; you think it’s a commercial for Produce, then you realize that “Monty Python” may have been right the whole time about defending yourself against a piece of fruit. The atmosphere of 80s horror movies is there, but the premise itself might’ve been a little TOO silly…especially when using a can of peaches as spiritual incense to ward off evil spirits.\n\nTHE CURSE OF THE WOLFMAN (1991): Some time in the future, I want to discuss why I enjoy “So Bad, It’s Good” movies; but until then, I’d like to call this sketch w/Christian Slater “Patient Zero” as to why I do. It makes fun of just how low budget Z-Grade movies can be sometimes. Unfortunately, this is one of those times when a Transcript doesn’t give the sketch much justice—Trust me, the purposely bad line readings from Slater is what makes this work. And speaking of our favorite Jack Nicholson impersonator…\n\nCHRISTIAN SLATER’S MONOLOGUE (1993): Though not quite good enough to make the cut of my previous Monologues list, there’s something about “Mr. Robot” (and Farley) acting like a giddy little kid going trick or treating around 8H that seems kind of quaint in hindsight.\n\nBRIDE OF BLACKENSTEIN (2011): I’ll be honest, I don’t really care for Nikki Minaj the singer, but DAMN if Nikki the actress doesn’t give it her all on this one.\n\nDUELING SIAS (2014): EDITOR’S NOTE: I decided to move this one to the “Honorable” section after 2 years because (1) In spite of how entertaining this still is, David S. Pumpkins is simply a far better sketch after letting it simmer a while, and (2) in retrospect, this sort of plays fast and loose with the term “Scary”–Yes, it does take place at a Halloween Party, but at the end of the day, it’s just McKinnon & Jim Carrey dancing around rather entertainingly. For a more Formal opinion on this sketch, take another look at the Carrey review I posted a few years ago.\n\nAs usual, I have a feeling I missed a number of REALLY good ones; but as usual, there was limited space and limited memories to remember. So if YOU have any favorites worth mentioning, please do below in that box where you comment on things. I promise I won’t give you any Razorbladed apples.\n\nNEXT WEEK: At Long Last—with just Days to go until America’s Final Election, no less—a look at some of the Greatest non-debate Political sketches in SNL history. But TOMORROW, since there’s actually going to Be an “SNL Vintage” tonight, you’ll be seeing a Bonus review from me. Until then, remember–Mung is the Scariest thing imaginable. Happy Pumpkin Day!\n\nOne & Done: The Top 10 “Limited Run” SNL Cast Members\n\nNOTE: Once again, Spacing & formatting issues got the best of me…I apologize…\n\nSNL—not unlike MGM—can boast that they have “More Stars than the Heavens”. Not just in terms of the hosts who pass through their doors every week, but also in the up & coming cast members who try to make their presence known as well. Some cast members become instant successes, some take their sweet time to become successes, some seem to fade away from the public view altogether. And then, there are those rare breeds who make a seemingly significant impact in the brief time they’re on the show…only for the Hammer to unexpectedly drop on an otherwise deserving talent. These are people who—for the most part—wound up getting the last laugh in their Post-SNL career, and eventually look back on their flash in time with more fondness than bitterness in hindsight. That’s the subject of this list; those who only appeared on the show for a limited time, and at the same time they deserved better than what they were given—hence the umbrella name I’m giving them; “Limited Cast Members”…which also explains the picture I used for the cover, in that sometimes the talent on SNL has the frequency of walking through a revolving door………yes, that’s a stretch.\n\nCRITERIA:\n\n*The rankings will be based on the following factors: How memorable their SNL tenure was, how much success they had after they left, and whether or not that success has sustained itself since that departure. For Instance; if they were fondly remembered on the show but had a lackluster career afterward (or vice versa), they might not score as well as someone who was a hit out of the box and continued to thrive after their brief appearance. Of course, all these factors pale in comparison to actual personal opinion, but they’re still a big deal. With that pretext, my pick for number one may actually shock some of you—stay tuned.\n\n*The Cast Members in Question have to have appeared a MINIMUM of 6 episodes, and a MAXIMUM of 2 years. So this means people like Laurie Metcalf (1 ep in ’81) & Emily Prager (Photo in the Montage, ’81), Morwenna Banks (4 eps in ‘95), Ben Stiller (4 in ’89), and a handful of other featureds from the 80s who were only there in the blink of an eye are Disqualified.\n\n*Also Disqualified, any Ringers—I.e. People who already had a well-established show biz career before joining the cast; so this means see ‘ya later to the ENTIRE 1984-85 Cast (Yes, even you Ms. Stephenson, you were in a Mel Brooks movie for God’s sake), A Good Chunk of the ’85-’86 cast (Cusack, Downey, Hall, Quaid), Michael McKean (’94) and Harry Shearer (’79-‘80, ’84-’85) among others I may have conveniently forgotten about. Other than that, everybody else is fair game.\n\nSo, Let’s start…\n\nCASEY WILSON (2008-2009) – Not gonna lie, I LOVE a woman with curves; and not since Laraine Newman has a cast member ever been as “Attainable” as Casey was on the show. Now that I got the objectifying stuff out of the Way, Casey is Still probably one of the funniest people I’ve seen on Television in recent years (Thanks, “Happy Endings!”). On SNL, she tried her best to garner a little attention—even going so far as to play a quadriplegic stripper (yes, I know this is NOT the SNL version); which on paper may not sound like the best idea, but in the end it’s all about the execution. I put her (and the next entry) low on the list because—quite honestly—it’s a little too soon in her career to tell just how far she’ll go. If it were 10 years later, trust me, she would be somewhere in the middle of the list.\n\nJENNY SLATE (2009-2010) – The sweetest girl Ever to slip out a swear word. Like I said on the long-ago “Bloopers” list, I honestly thought Slate had what it took to play with the big boys…and Then, “Biker Chick Chat” happened, and that one mistake cast a gloomy cloud for the rest of the year. But even if that gaffe was Never a factor, her sketch performances elsewhere ranged from “Questionable” to “meh”. So why Bother putting her on the list? Because like a number of flameouts, Slate managed to pick herself up, dust herself off, and attach herself to a cult classic (in her case, “Marcel the Shell”). She’s doing fine now–falling in with the IFC crowd–and she looks back on the gaffe as an unfortunate but still an important lesson…Also, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that she’s also responsible for probably one of the funniest talk show anecdotes I’ve seen in recent years.\n\nJAY MOHR (1993-1995) – As I mentioned back in the season 20 Analysis, Jay Mohr (to me, anyway) was one of that year’s silver linings thanks in part to his Christopher Walken impression. Unfortunately, a certain plagiarism scandal is what’s keeping him from cracking the top 5 of this list as well. But regardless of that, Mohr still held his own for the most part. Next time you come across his book “Gasping for Airtime”, he’ll say that his time on the show wasn’t all it was cracked up to be…to which I say, maybe Jay is being a little hard on himself. After all, if it weren’t for SNL, he wouldn’t be one of the most durable Character Actors/Comedians of recent years (“Action!” Truly was ahead of its time…just aired on the Wrong network). He sort of embraces SNL as a Stepping stone now, but back then………well…….read the book, I don’t want to spoil anything.\n\nGILBERT GOTTFRIED (1980-1981) – He would be a LOT higher on the list if he actually did anything memorable on the show aside from his self-deprecating “Who is Gilbert Gottfried” film. But not unlike another pick later in the list, his career skyrocketed (slowly but surely) after being one of the many sacrificial lambs to the slaughter that year. Thanks in large part from being a “Jerry Seinfeld Lite” on the Stand-up circuit, to amping up his voice about 10000% and making a viable living doing so. Between voicing Iago in “Aladdin”, his time as the Afflac duck, and his savage appearances on various Comedy Central roasts (among the Other things he’s done), Gottfried’s time on SNL is pretty much an afterthought…Though not a big enough one that he was included prominently in the “SNL in the 80s” special a few years ago, speaking about the dreaded Season 6 almost with fondness…almost.\n\nDAMON WAYANS (1985-86) – I was debating to myself whether or not to include Wayans in this compilation considering I already spoke at great lengths about him in previous editorials. The more I thought about it, the more I realized he HAS to at least be mentioned (Especially since I could use this moment to cheaply plug that he’s now the star of the inexplicable “Lethal Weapon” reboot on FOX, Wednesdays at 8PM/7PM Central)—after all, he & his family changed the playing field when it came to sketch comedy in the 90s. So at the risk of being redundant, just do yourself a favor and take another look at my entry on Wayans in the “Season 11” list…Moving On…….\n\n(TIE) GAIL MATHIUS & DENNY DILLON (1980-1981) – As I mentioned time & again, Season 6 of the show wasn’t entirely bad despite the many things that were OBVIOUSLY bad. The new cast members that joined that year certainly had no idea what they were about to get themselves into; but for the most part, they still made the best of a bad situation. Consider these two the honorary #7 on the “Season 6 Silver Linings” list. Unlike Gottfried who barely got anything done in 1980, Matthius (who quite honestly should’ve been given another chance under Ebersol) was the deFacto Laraine; not for Sex appeal—though she was (and still is) cute–but because she kept most of her roles versatile & various that year. While Denny was more of the clutch utility player in the mold of Jane & Gilda, who despite being a tad abrasive at times still managed to get the job done; even with weak material. Both of them did well after the show; Matthius became probably one of the best known voiceover actors to work in the industry who’s NOT named Tress MacNeille, Melanie Chartoff, Cheryl Chase or the late Christine Cavanaugh. While Denny makes a comfortable living as a character actress—including a memorable tenure on HBO’s “Dream On”. I’d like to think both of them knew they were on a sinking ship at the time—Even though the ship eventually failed to sink, they opted to take a lifeboat anyway\n\nDAVID KOECHNER (1995-1996) – In a Season that brought us the “birth” of Will Ferrell, the rise of Molly & Norm, the Renaissance of Tim Meadows, and the spawning of a pair of mosquitoes named Oteri &…….Kattan…(*THUNDER RUMBLES*)…It honestly confuses me that they would cut David Koechner loose after just one year of doing things no different than anybody else…But then again, maybe that was WHY Koechner got the Ax after that year—there was no need for Two Will Ferrells. Fortunately, Koechner’s departure from SNL was Literally Only the beginning for him—as of this writing, his IMDB page lists a total of 157 additional credits to his name since 1996; some are small parts, others more prolific (Including “Another Period”, “American Dad!”, and some little indie flick called Anchor…………something…which also had a sequel of some sort.). Not unlike other one & done-er’s, SNL was (Say it with me now) a Stepping stone for Koechner—and we’re all glad that the legacy of Gerald “T-Bones” Tibbons continues to grow.\n\nCHEVY CHASE (1975-1976) – We HAVE to include the alpha “One & Done-er”; after all, he was the show’s first big Star, and he went on to become an even bigger star…until the Late 80s/Early 90s when either one pratfall, one pain killer or one Really Bad Talk Show too many wound up pissing all that goodwill away—To say nothing of all the allegations in the Shales/Miller book of just how big a dick he was on subsequent hosting appearances (Which is probably keeping him from grabbing the #1 Spot). Yet despite all that he’s gained/lost since he was on the show, he STILL only did the show for a Year & 1/4th. He didn’t deserve better on the show because he was already the star, and he didn’t deserve better post SNL because his SNL fame already opened the door for all the other stuff to happen. So the only OTHER reason why I put him on the list at all is because—if nothing else—he provided us with a template for future use for some of the names that followed. Nothing wrong with being a cautionary, educational tool…especially if that person himself becomes a massive one years later.\n\n2. CHRISTINE EBERSOLE (1981-1982) – I feel the need to say this first—NO, she is NOT related to Dick Ebersol, nor did she tack on the Extra “E” to make sure there was no Nepotism; They are two SEPARATE people. Now that we got that out of the way, it’s a pity that most of the roles she had during the first full Ebersol season were a number bimbos & damsels—save for one unheralded breakout performance early in that season where she plays a lonely barfly and performs the musical equivalent of a dramatic monologue in a song called “Single Women” (A song which was written—shockingly—by Michael O’Donoguhe, was then morphed into a legitimate chart-topping song by Dolly Parton, and THEN turned out to be the springboard for a Tony Danza movie). Ebbie’s version may not have been the most ideal fit for a comedy show, but it certainly acts as a calling card for a would-be Broadway Icon. Ebersole not only used her year on SNL to become one of the most durable character actresses of our time later on, but she also wound up winning several Tony Awards for her roles on Broadway in “42nd Street” and “Grey Gardens”. Maybe because Ebersol (with no Extra “E”) was still trying to fine tune things and/or giving the ball to Murphy & Piscopo too often, Christine wound up getting lost in the shuffle…a shame really, since the show could use (and could’ve used) a little class once in a while—Ebbie was a Diamond in the rough back then, but she certainly took it all in stride—and What a Voice, too.\n\nSARAH SILVERMAN (1993-1994) – So why Her at #1 when someone like Chevy CLEARLY had more Star Power both on & off the show? Well, like I just said on his entry, his star has been on the decline for years—and durability is also a factor here, that’s the short answer. At the same time, how is she any Different from Gilbert Gottfried—who also did next to nothing while on the show? Well, If you were fortunate enough to read her memoir “The Bedwetter”, then a lot of what I’m about to say here should come as no surprise. By all accounts & purposes, Silverman was indeed too young to be taken seriously as a cast member—which would probably explain why her biggest role on the show back then was “Audience Member” during various monologues; something that Silverman would Brilliantly use to her advantage when she hosted some 20 years later. Of course there were other reasons why her tenure on the show didn’t last that long, but thankfully for the passage of time that wound had long since healed both literally & figuratively. Silverman wouldn’t be number one, however, without all the post-SNL success she’s had since her failed attempt to do well at sketch comedy. She became an alpha comedian, an Emmy Winning sitcom star/creator, a political activist for millennials, a viral video sensation, a (sometimes) dramatic performer, a gift to talk show bookers (Except maybe one time…you don’t have to watch the WHOLE thing), and all in all just someone that you would want to hang out and smoke weed with and talk random BS about things until dawn. It almost makes me wonder if “Sarah” is short for “Serendipity”—until I realize just how big a spelling error that is. Silverman certainly did NOT have much of an SNL career, but not only was her star on the rise back then, it continues to rise to this day—and with the political activism under her belt, she just might be one of the most influential SNL alumni right now who ISN’T a Senator (or Congressman if one Mr. Kroger gets his way in a few weeks, Iowa!). Not bad for a Bedwetter from New Hampshire.\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\nTHOSE WHO WERE VICTIMS OF “OVERPOPULATED” SEASONS: I know this is a lazy thing to do, but there were just so MANY people who wound up in an oversized cast at one point, and ultimately wound up getting lost in the shuffle when they were on the show; People like Beth Cahill, Siobhan Fallon, John Milheiser, Noel Wells, Brooks Wheelan, Laura Kightlinger, and most recently Jon Rudnitsky comes to mind. They certainly tried to be heard, but they weren’t loud enough among the pre-existing noise makers. I’m sure each of them are doing Something to keep busy these days.\n\nTHOSE WHO FOLLOWED IN “THE FAMILY BUSINESS”: Not to take anything away from Brian Doyle-Murray or Jim Belushi (Or to a Far lesser extent, Peter Aykroyd). They continue to appear in things at a steady rate, but something about Nepotism always rubbed me the wrong way—can’t quite put my finger on it.\n\nPAUL BRITTAN: Speaking of Nepotism (on a FAR different end of the spectrum), I honestly feel that it’s a crime against comedy that someone who is a direct descendant of a comedy legend got the ax just as he was beginning to pick up some steam. And even though it happened a lot to a number of people—even some I haven’t mentioned—the fact that it happened to Bob Newhart’s nephew feels incredibly disconcerting…either that, or the comedy gene in him was more recessive than we thought. Aside from some indie flicks and teaming up with Nick Kroll on a couple of things, he’s remained under the radar ever since.\n\nJERRY MINOR: He’s fast becoming one of those “That Guy who was in that Thing” kind of actors—you know, you see him on TV and immediately think “OH! I know that Guy!” That aside, “Grandmaster Rap” was severely under-served by SNL in 2000 in spite of him actually doing things that were legitimately funny.\n\nTERRY SWEENEY: See “Damon Wayans”, but replace “Starting up a comedy dynasty” with “Having the most accurate Nancy Reagan impression the show ever had”. Thankfully, he has a more durable career as a TV writer these days (Ignoring the fact that he also BRIEFLY wrote for Season 6).\n\nJANEANE GAROFALO: Yes, I know, she “saved” season 20 & the show’s future, but nowadays there might be such a thing as being “Too Liberal”…oh well, at least she’s still a cute brunette with an acid tongue.\n\nMICHAELA WATKINS: She certainly has talent to spare, but in the end she might’ve played some of her roles a little Too straight for the show (save for th"
