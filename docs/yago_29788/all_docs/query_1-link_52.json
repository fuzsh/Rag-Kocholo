        "text": "Penny Marshall\n\nPenny Marshall, the nasally and good-natured Bronx native who starred on the ABC ratings sensation Laverne & Shirley before shattering records as a top-grossing female director in Hollywood died Dec. 18 at 75 of complications from diabetes. Marshall earned fame — but, incredibly not even one Emmy nomination — for playing the wisecracking Laverne DeFazio on the Happy Days spinoff created by her brother. Laverne & Shirley, which aired for eight seasons from 1976-83, centered on the escapades of two romantically challenged Milwaukee brewery workers, with Cindy Williams co-starring as Marshall’s idealistic roommate, Shirley Feeney. Apart from acting, Marshall went on to helm a myriad of successful films including Jumpin’ Jack Flash (1986), starring Whoopi Goldberg, Big (1988) with Tom Hanks, Awakenings (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and The Renaissance Man (1994). Throughout her career as a filmmaker, Marshall became the second women ever to helm a best picture Oscar nominee and Big is recognized as the first film directed by a woman to gross more than $100 million.\n\nStan Lee\n\nStan Lee, the legendary writer, editor and publisher of Marvel Comics whose fantabulous but flawed creations made him a real-life superhero to comic book lovers everywhere, died Nov. 12 at 95. Lee, who began in the business in 1939 and created or co-created Black Panther, Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Mighty Thor, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Incredible Hulk, Daredevil and Ant-Man, catapulted Marvel from a tiny venture into the world's No. 1 publisher of comic books and, later, a multimedia giant. In 2009, The Walt Disney Co. bought Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion, and most of the top-grossing superhero films of all time — led by Avengers: Infinity War's $2.05 billion worldwide take earlier this year — have featured Marvel characters.\n\nBurt Reynolds\n\nBurt Reynolds, the actor most recognized for his roles in Boogie Nights and Deliverance, died Sept. 6 at the age of 86, according to his manager, Erik Kritzer. The cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest. Throughout his career, Reynolds starred in a variety of action films and romantic comedies, including Starting Over (1979) opposite Jill Clayburgh and Candice Bergen; The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982) with Dolly Parton; Best Friends (1982) with Goldie Hawn; and The Man Who Loved Women (1983) with Julie Andrews. Reynolds won a Golden Globe and was ranked as Hollywood’s top-grossing star every year from 1978 through 1982. In his 2015 memoir, But Enough About Me, Reynolds revealed the role he felt most proud of: \"If I had to put only one of my movies in a time capsule, it would be Deliverance. I don't know if it's the best acting I've done, but it's the best movie I've ever been in. It proved I could act, not only to the public but me.\" Aside from winning a Golden Globe, Reynolds was also nominated for an Academy Award in 1997 for his role as Jack Horner in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Boogie Nights, but lost out in the Oscar supporting actor race to Robin Williams for Good Will Hunting. Reynolds' costar and former love Sally Fields paid tribute to the late actor after news of his passing. “My years with Burt never leave my mind. He will be in my history and my heart, for as long as I live. Rest, Buddy.\"\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nAretha Franklin, the sensational songbird whose voice was sweeter than honey to millions, making her an inspirational American icon and one of the most admired vocalists of all time, died Aug. 16 after battling advanced pancreatic cancer. She died surrounded by family and loved ones at her home in Detroit, her publicist said. She was 76. Franklin died at 9:50 a.m. local time, with the official cause of death \"due to advance pancreatic cancer of the neuroendocrine type,\" confirmed by Franklin’s oncologist, Dr. Philip Phillips of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit. Born in Memphis, Tennessee, but raised in the Motor City, Franklin was firmly rooted in gospel but also excelled in the worlds of jazz, R&B and pop. She collected 20 Grammys — including a lifetime achievement award — covering a span of four decades; was the first woman enshrined into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (in 1987); and, befitting a queen, was named No. 1 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.a Franklin, the sensational songbird whose voice was sweeter than honey to millions, making her an inspirational American icon and one of the most admired vocalists of all time, died Thursday after battling advanced pancreatic cancer.

He was 61. The news was confirmed by Bourdain's employer, CNN, which reported that the cause of death was suicide. The Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown host was found in a hotel, Le Chambard, in Kaysersberg and appeared to have hung himself. Bourdain was filming an episode for his award-winning CNN original series in Strasbourg; he had hosted the show for five years and the new season premiered last month. His close friend, chef Eric Ripert, found Bourdain unresponsive in his hotel room; the production crew were also there.\n\nSteven Bochco\n\nSteven Bochco, the strong-willed writer and producer who brought gritty realism and sprawling ensemble casts to the small screen with such iconic series as Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law and NYPD Blue, died on April 1 at age 74. Suffering with leukemia, he received a stem cell transplant from an anonymous 23-year-old in late 2014. In May 2016, he met the man that prolonged his life. Bochco, a 10-time Primetime Emmy Award winner, also was behind the Neil Patrick Harris ABC comedy-drama Doogie Howser, M.D. and the TNT drama Murder in the First. A New York City native who began at Universal Studios in the mid-1960s, Bochco time and time again refused to bend to network chiefs or standards and practices execs, thus earning rare creative control during his five decades of envelope-pushing work.\n\nJerry Van Dyke\n\nJerry Van Dyke, the younger brother of Dick Van Dyke who earned four Emmy nominations for playing the befuddled defensive coordinator Luther Van Dam on the ABC comedy Coach, died Jan. 5, a source close to his family confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. He was 86. Van Dyke died at his ranch in Hot Spring County in Arkansas, according to the Associated Press. His wife, Shirley Ann Jones, was by his side. No cause was immediately known. Van Dyke famously passed up the opportunity to star on Gilligan's Island in favor of toplining the short-lived My Mother the Car, considered one of the worst shows in TV history. Van Dyke started out as a banjo-playing stand-up comic, and his fun persona throughout his long career was that of a country boy, endearingly earnest and slow-witted. After working on several TV shows that never stuck, Van Dyke earned supporting actor Emmy nominations in 1990, '91, '92 and '94 for his work as one of Craig T. Nelson's assistants on the staff of the Minnesota State University Screaming Eagles on Coach. The series aired for nine seasons, from 1989 until 1997.\n\nGreta Thyssen\n\nGreta Thyssen, the Danish beauty who doubled for Marilyn Monroe, dated Cary Grant and starred opposite The Three Stooges, died Jan. 6. She was 90. Thyssen died at her Manhattan apartment after a bout with pneumonia, her daughter, Genevieve Guenther, told The Hollywood Reporter. Thyssen also starred in several \"B\" movies, including the horror pic Terror Is a Man (1959), a loose adaptation of H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau. On a mystery island (it was filmed in the Philippines), the actress played the wife of a scientist (Francis Lederer) \"tormented by unsatisfied desire, desperate to escape a loneliness and her fear,\" according to the film's trailer. Unfortunately, Thyssen's character has more pressing issues to worry about, namely her husband's creation — a half-man, half-panther beast. The movie incorporated a \"warning bell\" gimmick that would alert moviegoers when a particularly horrific sequence was about to take place so that they could hide their eyes. It would ring a second time when it was safe to look again. Four of Thyssen's other best-known performances came in the Joseph Kane noir Accused of Murder (1956); The Beast of Budapest (1958); Three Blondes in His Life (1961), opposite Jock Mahoney; and as an enticing pin-up beauty on Uranus in Journey to the Seventh Planet (1962), shot in her native Denmark.\n\nVerne Troyer\n\nVerne Troyer, an actor best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series, died April 21, according to a statement on the actor's official Facebook page. He was 49. \"It is with great sadness and incredibly heavy hearts to write that Verne passed away today,\" the statement reads. \"Verne was an extremely caring individual. He wanted to make everyone smile, be happy, and laugh. Anybody in need, he would help to any extent possible. Verne hoped he made a positive change with the platform he had and worked towards spreading that message everyday.\" Troyer grew up in an Amish community in Michigan and rose to fame as a result of his role in the Austin Powers series. Following his Austin Powers debut in 1999's The Spy Who Shagged Me, he played Griphook in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and Coach Punch Cherkov in The Love Guru. Troyer also had guest spots on TV's Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Scrubs, Two and a Half Men and Boston Public. He also memorably appeared as Mini-Me in the music video for Ludacris' \"Number One Spot\" from the 2004 album The Red Light District.\n\nAvicii\n\nAvicii, the Grammy-nominated electronic dance DJ who performed sold-out concerts for feverish fans around the world and also had massive success on U.S. pop radio, died April 20. He was 28. Publicist Diana Baron said in a statement that the Swedish performer, born Tim Bergling, was found dead in Muscat, Oman. \"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,\" the statement read. \"The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.\" Avicii was an international pop star, performing his well-known electronic dance songs around the world for fans, sometimes hundreds of thousands at music festivals, where he was the headline act.

Dubbed \"America's pastor,\" he was a confidant to U.S. presidents from Gen. Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush. Beyond Graham's public appearances, he reached untold millions through his pioneering use of prime-time telecasts, network radio, daily newspaper columns, evangelistic feature films and globe-girdling satellite TV hookups.

Luckey also provided the voices of Rick Dicker, the head of the Superhero Relocation Program, in The Incredibles (2004); of the broken-hearted Chuckles the Clown in Toy Story 3 (2010); and of Eeyore in Winnie the Pooh (2011). \"Bud Luckey is one of the true unsung heroes of animation,\" Pixar and Disney animation chief John Lasseter once said. \"Bud helped design most of the films we've made from Toy Story [in 1995] onward. He was the fifth animator hired here at Pixar.\" Collaborating with lyricist Donald Hadley (and with the music of Turk Murphy), Luckey created many counting cartoons for Sesame Street, many of which are fondly remembered today. They included \"The Alligator King\" (with Luckey playing banjo) about Number 7, \"The Ladybugs' Picnic\" (Number 12), \"Penny Candy Man,\" \"That's About the Size,\" \"The Old Woman Who Lived in a Nine\" and a series of jingles by Donnie Budd, a hillbilly fiddler, performed by Luckey.

Peace,\" Helen Crimmins wrote. Goldthwait directed the 2015 documentary Call Me Lucky, which focused on the life and career of Crimmins. Crimmins was also an avid crusader against images of child sexual abuse on the internet and, in the 1990s, called for an investigation into service providers over the issue. Fellow comedians shared their sorrow about the news. \"Just learned of Barry Crimmins passing. So sad. When I met him I felt like I was meeting a founding father of stand up comedy. This world is a better place because of people like Barry.

She was 62. Butterworth died at the Hilo Medical Center in Hilo, Hawaii, after a long, unspecified illness, Guadalupe Erece Jr., funeral director at Dodo Mortuary and Crematory, told The Hollywood Reporter. In Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), Butterworth, then just 10, performed three songs: \"Datin',\" \"Bill Bailey, Won't You Please Come Home\" and \"Queen Wahine's Papaya.\" In the 1965 comedy The Family Jewels — which Lewis wrote, directed, produced and starred in — Butterworth's Donna Peyton inherits $30 million from her father and must decide which of her six uncles (all played by Lewis) will become her guardian. Lewis also portrayed a seventh character — her devoted chauffeur. In delightful behind-the-scenes footage, Lewis is seen deliberately confusing Butterworth with humor during an on-set conversation, hoping to get her to relax. For her work in the film, the actress received a Golden Globe nomination as Most Promising Newcomer.\n\nSir Ken Dodd\n\nKen Dodd, a titan of a vanishing age of British comedy whose U.K. fame at its peak rivaled that of The Beatles, died March 11 at his Liverpool home — the same house where he was born in 1927 — his publicist Robert Holmes said. He was 90. Dodd, who had recently been hospitalized with a chest infection, married his longtime partner Anne Jones two days before his death. Instantly recognizable for his unruly mop of hair and snaggletoothed grin, Dodd came up through the hardscrabble ranks of Britain's variety circuit, where performers kept demanding crowds entertained with songs, a bit of dance and a slew of jokes. Dodd was famous for his rapid-fire one-liners, surreal imaginative flights of fancy, use of fanciful words like \"tattyfilarious\" and marathon stand-up shows. Even in his 80s, Dodd's shows often ran three to four hours. In the 1960s, he held the Guinness world record for the longest joke-telling session: 1,500 jokes in three-and-a-half hours. Holmes said Dodd \"was one of the last music hall greats.\" \"With Ken gone, the lights have been turned out in the world of variety,\" he said.\n\nFrank Avruch\n\nLongtime Boston television personality and entertainer Frank Avruch, who was the star of the popular children's TV program Bozo the Clown, died March 20 at his Boston home from heart disease, his family said in a statement to WCVB-TV.

Avruch became the first nationally syndicated Bozo the Clown. Avruch also was a contributor to WCVB-TV for more than 40 years as a host of Man About Town and The Great Entertainment.

The definition of a true gentleman, that will stay with me forever.\" A French aristocrat, Givenchy founded his label in 1952 at age 25 after four years under Elsa Schiaparelli and brief stints alongside Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain. Early in his career, he garnered attention stateside for his artist-muse relationship with Audrey Hepburn, with whom he also developed a close personal relationship, forging a bond between Hollywood and haute couture that still thrives today. \"I’m as dependent on Givenchy as some Americans are on their psychiatrist,\" the actress once said.\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers\n\nDavid Ogden Stiers, the actor who famously played Major Charles Emerson Winchester III on M*A*S*H, died March 3.

His friends and family knew, as he told us so.\" Stiers died at his home in Newport, Oregon, and had been battling bladder cancer, The Oregonian reported. In his role as Major Winchester on CBS' smash-hit sitcom M*A*S*H, filling in for actor Larry Linville after he left the show, Stiers played a blue-blooded surgeon and straight man to the cast's practical jokers. In real life, however, Stiers gave back as good as he got to his castmembers. \"To repay Stiers for all his pranks on us, we had his dressing room painted orange and purple over Thanksgiving break. When we came back, we were waiting for him to rant. He said nothing. Finally, one of us asked, 'What's new?'\" co-star Jamie Farr remembered in THR's oral history of M*A*S*H in February. Stiers was nominated for two primetime Emmys for his work as Winchester, in 1981 and 1982; he later won a trophy for his role as U.S. Olympic Committee founder William Milligan Sloane on the NBC miniseries The First Olympics: Athens 1896 in 1984.\n\nVerne Troyer\n\nVerne Troyer, an actor best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers series, died April 21, according to a statement on the actor's official Facebook page.

His manager, Dennis Aspland, confirmed Forman's death to The Hollywood Reporter. The filmmaker died in Danbury Hospital, near his home in Warren, Connecticut. Forman first attracted international attention with such features as Black Peter (1964), The Loves of a Blonde (1965) — an Oscar nominee for best foreign-language film — and The Firemen’s Ball (1967), which put him in hot water with the communist regime in Czechoslovakia.

Walker, who also starred in such films as Send Me No Flowers (1964), None But the Brave (1965) and the World War II classic The Dirty Dozen (1967), died from congestive heart failure, Walker's daughter Valerie told TMZ.

He was tough (and lucky) off the screen as well: He survived a 1971 skiing accident at Mammoth Mountain in California in which his heart was punctured by a ski pole and he was pronounced dead. In 1955, Walker was cast by Warner Bros. in TV’s first-ever hourlong Western as Cheyenne Bodie, a principled cowboy drifter in the post-American Civil War era who was raised by the Cherokees who killed his parents.

Pacino has often credited the producer with discovering him in an off-Broadway play and offering the actor crucial early career guidance. \"I'm missing a lot not having him around anymore,\" Pacino said in a 2014 THR interview after Bregman had retired. \"I must say, because he was what is so rare in what we do: a facilitator. You need a facilitator.\"\n\nEunice Gayson\n\nEunice Gayson, the British actress who played the first Bond girl and the first to appear in two 007 films, died in June. She was 90. Born in Surrey, England, in 1928, Gayson had a number of onscreen roles, including the 1958 Hammer Horror title The Revenge of Frankenstein, before appearing in Dr. No in 1962. Her appearance in the first James Bond film would give the franchise one of its most iconic lines. In a scene at the Le Cercle Club, her character meets Sean Connery’s Agent 007 over a game of cards. After she suggests they raise the stakes, Bond says, “I admire your courage, Miss, er…?” to which she replies, “Trench. Sylvia Trench. I admire your luck, Mister…?” His response: “Bond. James Bond.”\n\nCharles Krauthammer\n\nCharles Krauthammer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and board-certified psychiatrist who became one of the media’s most powerful voices for conservative politics — while wooing a fair share of liberals along the way — died June 21, his son told The Washington Post. He was 68. On June 8, Krauthammer, a quadriplegic, revealed in a note published in the Post that doctors had informed him that he had only a \"few weeks\" to live because cancer removed from his abdomen 10 months earlier had returned. Until a year ago, Krauthammer was a regular on the Fox News Channel, most notably on Special Report, where he was known as the \"dean\" in a segment featuring a panel of pundits the show referred to as \"The Fox News All-Stars.\" He also appeared often on The O’Reilly Factor before host Bill O’Reilly was ousted after accusations of sexual misconduct, and he spent 23 years as a weekly panelist on the PBS show Inside Washington. \"I believe that the pursuit of truth and right ideas through honest debate and rigorous argument is a noble undertaking,\" Krauthammer wrote in the Post. \"I leave this life with no regrets. It was a wonderful life — full and complete with the great loves and great endeavors that make it worth living.\"\n\nEd Schultz\n\nFormer MSNBC primetime host Ed Schultz died of natural causes at the age of 64, the network reported on air on July 5.

Joe began working on his kids' musical careers in the early 1960s, while they were living in Gary, Indiana, bringing Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael into what would eventually become the Jackson 5. Forcing them into intense rehearsal sessions, and after performances in talent competitions and small venues, Joe ultimately booked them at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, after which they landed their first deal with a recording label. After first single \"Big Boy\" became a local hit, the group was signed to Motown Records in 1969 and garnered a series of record-breaking hits, including \"I Want You Back,\" \"ABC,\" \"The Love You Save\" and \"I'll Be There.\"\n\nJonathan Gold\n\nJonathan Gold, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Los Angeles Times restaurant critic, died July 21, according to the outlet.

In his review of the film, The Hollywood Reporter's Todd McCarthy wrote, \"The first and only food critic to win a Pulitzer Prize, Gold is the great democratizer of his profession, placing food truck tacos and Chinese mini-mall noodles on the same gastronomic plane as French haute cuisine or expense account sushi. Laura Gabbert's accessible and informative close-up documentary City of Gold appreciates all this and usefully puts the man in context as it accompanies him around the city while he offers a running commentary on his enviable job.\" Aside from the Pulitzer, Gold has won seven James Beard Awards for his restaurant criticism — the Oscars of the food world.\n\nNancy Sinatra Sr.\n\nNancy Sinatra Sr., the first of Frank Sinatra's four wives and the mother of the legendary entertainer's three children, died July 13.

In 1961, Ditko and Lee created Spider-Man. Lee, the editor-in-chief at Marvel Comics, gave Ditko the assignment after he wasn't satisfied with Jack Kirby's take on the idea of a teen superhero with spider powers. The look of Spider-Man — the costume, the web-shooters, the red and blue design — all came from Ditko. Spider-Man first appeared in Amazing Fantasy No. 15. The comic was an unexpected hit, and the character was spun off into The Amazing Spider-Man. Ditko helped create such classic Spider-Man characters as Doctor Octopus, Sandman, the Lizard and Green Goblin.

You know how there are those teachers of creative writing who can’t necessarily write but can teach?
