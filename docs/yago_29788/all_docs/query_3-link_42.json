        "text": "As the Prevention Science Journal notes, family socialization plays a significant role in long-term well-being. It is through your family in childhood that emotional regulation is learned and coping behaviors are developed. Observing the way family members deal with emotions, parental practices, and the emotional climate of your family’s environment all contribute to your ability to regulate your emotions. Thus, exposure to high levels of family conflict undermines your ability to form adaptive emotional regulation. The impact of family conflicts on your well-being highlights the importance of understanding dysfunctional family roles for recovery.\n\nFamily conflict in your childhood can stem from a variety of issues, including family structure, interpersonal conflict, substance use disorder (SUD), and other mental health disorders. As the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine states, disruptions in family structure like divorce and separation from your parents can increase the risk for abuse, developmental delays, and mental health disorders. Moreover, parental challenges with mental health disorders can contribute to impaired parenting and, thus, dysfunctional family roles.\n\nAccording to the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, parental mental illness has a high association with reduced family functioning. Decreased family functioning can contribute to conflict, less cohesion, poor adaptability, and disorganized patterns of everyday executive functioning. In addition, unaddressed parental mental illness increases parental impairment in daily functioning and interactions. Some of the disorders that contribute to parental impairments include:\n\nDepression\n\nBipolar I disorder (BP)\n\nAnxiety disorders\n\nBorderline personality disorder (BPD)\n\nChallenges with parental mental health have a strong correlation with the transmission of mental health disorders to children. For example, if your mom experienced challenges coping with depression, you are more likely to develop depression as well. Addressing the mental health factor in dysfunctional family roles is an important point to the difficulties of psychological distress. When your psychological distress is left untreated, you are more likely to engage in substance misuse and develop SUD.\n\nAt New Creation Recovery, we know how closely intertwined families are and, thus, how devastating addiction can be for the whole family. Having a loved one dealing with addiction and potential co-occurring mental health disorders can feel overwhelming for everyone. You or your loved one may feel that your only option is to do damage control to protect the family. When a loved one has SUD, it is not surprising to seek out “saving” practices like providing additional financial assistance and making up excuses for their behavior.\n\nYet, while well-intentioned, engaging in saving practices can contribute to enabling and codependent behavior that increases issues with addiction. Through saving practices and addiction itself, dysfunctional family roles are born. Thus, addressing dysfunctional family roles can be an important tool for healing the whole family. With a commitment to holistic rehab treatment, addiction recovery, and healing dysfunctional family roles are possible.\n\nYet, you may wonder how you recognize dysfunctional family roles in your family. First, understanding family dynamics will give you more insight into the impact of relationships on well-being. Through family dynamics, you can see the way interpersonal family relationships impact interactions, roles, relationships, and how you function in the world.\n\nWhat Are Family Dynamics?\n\nAccording to “Family Dynamics” by Bahareh Jabbari et al., family dynamics are a pattern of interactions between family members and their relationship roles. Families often rely on each other for emotional, physical, and financial support across life courses. With a supportive family, you find the majority of your social connection and sense of security as you go through life together. In good and bad times, healthy family dynamics support stress reduction and promote a sense of belonging through the provision of love, care, and advice.\n\nMoreover, even in healthy families when there are conflicts or disagreements, it permeates and affects interactions between the whole family. Thus, family dynamics play an important role in every part of your well-being. The quality of your interpersonal interactions with your family members impacts your psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological pathways. Challenges with untreated or poorly addressed mental health disorders within your family can be a major risk factor for dysfunctional family roles.\n\nHowever, serious destructive thinking and behavior challenges like mental illness and SUD are not the only factors that can contribute to dysfunctional family roles. Even when your family does not have a history of SUD or serious mental health disorders, several factors can contribute to unhealthy family dynamics. The primary factors that impact family dynamics include:\n\nIndividualization\n\nMutuality\n\nFlexibility\n\nStability\n\nRole reciprocity\n\nClear and open communication\n\nIn particular, mutuality, regardless of the type of family you are part of, is important for healthy dynamics. Through mutuality, you and your loved ones recognize that your interactions and relationship are a two-way street. When you care for each other, you not only foster a sense of belonging, but a cohesive unit. With cohesion, you know that even in times of great difficulty like the loss of a loved one or unemployment, you will be there to help each other through it. On the other hand, unhealthy family dynamics are typically overrun by:\n\nEnmeshment\n\nIsolation\n\nRigidity\n\nDisorganization\n\nUnclear communication\n\nRole conflict\n\nWith a basic understanding of the protective and risk factors for healthy and unhealthy family dynamics, you can recognize those factors in your family. Being able to recognize dysfunctional family roles can increase your awareness and understanding of the part dysfunctional family roles play in your life.\n\nRecognizing Dysfunction in Your Family\n\nAs stated in the article “Is My Family Dysfunctional?” from Mental Health America (MHA), family dysfunction is characterized by frequent conflict, abusive behaviors, and neglect. The conflict within the family creates tension that leaves everyone in a constant state of distress. There is no such thing as the perfect parent or family, so every family can have some level of dysfunction. For example, parents or siblings may argue occasionally, or parents might have one drink too many on date night.\n\nWhile arguments and overconsuming alcohol can be unhealthy, significant dysfunction is constant. Deeply harmful dysfunction happens when parents are having arguments every day or family members are unable to maintain a job because all of their money goes to getting substances. When dysfunction is left to fester, it becomes a breeding ground for further family and individual impairment.\n\nDysfunctional family roles can manifest in a variety of ways, from poor communication to physical and emotional abuse. Listed below are some of the signs that your family is being impacted by significant family dysfunction:\n\nAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs)\n\nExposure to parental substance misuse\n\nStruggles to meet responsibilities\n\nChildren have to take on parental responsibilities to take care of siblings and or parents\n\nUnaddressed parental challenges with other addictions\n\nGambling\n\nShopping\n\nBeing allowed or encouraged to use alcohol and drugs\n\nExposure to intimate partner violence (IPV)\n\nSexual abuse\n\nRape\n\nSexual assault\n\nSex trafficking\n\nInappropriate and unwanted touching\n\nBeing forced to touch one’s self\n\nNon-touching behaviors\n\nBeing exposed to pornography\n\nPhysical abuse\n\nBeing slapped, hit, punched, kicked, scratched\n\nPsychological or emotional abuse\n\nBeing threatened\n\nLack of emotional support\n\nVerbal abuse\n\nTalked down to\n\nRidiculed\n\nBelittled\n\nUnable to provide basic needs like food, clothing, shelter, and medical care\n\nBarriers to resources\n\nLow income\n\nUnemployment\n\nEducation\n\nResource knowledge\n\nRefusal to meet basic needs of children when the means to do so are available\n\nParental challenges with mental health disorders\n\nHigh levels of anxiety\n\nControlling things\n\nAvoidance of parental responsibilities\n\nParent, caregiver, and other family member behavior\n\nBeing forced to take sides in parental conflicts\n\nParental denial of current or past events\n\nOverly involved in your life\n\nOverprotective parenting\n\nDiscouraged you from asserting yourself or sharing your thoughts\n\nBeing ignored or having your thoughts and feelings discounted or criticized\n\nParental rejection\n\nSiblings receive preferential treatment\n\nExtremely restrictive parenting\n\nOverly demanding and unrealistic expectations\n\nViolation of boundaries\n\nGoing through your things\n\nEntering your space without permission\n\nChecking your phone\n\nEavesdropping on your conversations\n\nLack of rules and structure\n\nNo curfews, schedules, or expectations to complete responsibilities and obligations like homework and chores\n\nRelying on children for emotional and or financial support\n\nIgnores or refuses to do anything about violent or inappropriate behaviors\n\nImpairment in dynamics\n\nChallenges with problem-solving\n\nBehavioral control issues\n\nCommunication challenges\n\nDifficulties managing relationship roles\n\nOther dysfunctional behaviors and patterns\n\nMembers of the family are hesitant to share the difficulties happening at home with others\n\nChildren are encouraged to keep the family’s challenges a secret\n\nYou were more your parent’s friend and confidante than their child\n\nParent was resentful of your freedom\n\nPoor communication\n\nThere is a disconnect in understanding each other\n\nConversations are always tense\n\nEveryone avoids talking about problems\n\nYou do not feel safe voicing your opinion\n\nThere is no respect for each other’s time, needs, or wants\n\nLooking at the variety of ways dysfunctional family roles can exist is understandably daunting. However, knowing the explicit and implicit signs of dysfunctional family roles helps you better recognize the challenges your family may be facing. With more insight into what dysfunctional family roles look like, you can understand where the distress and conflict in your family’s life come from. ACEs like sexual abuse and parental SUD may feel like more obvious causes for dysfunctional family roles.\n\nYet, you may question how these distressing and traumatic experiences happen. Why is one parent abusive or neglectful and another is not? How does addiction take over a family? What has caused your family’s dysfunctional family roles around addiction?\n\nAddressing Causes of Dysfunctional Family Roles in Addiction\n\nEvery family is different, and every family’s relationship with addiction is specific to them. Yet, dysfunctional family roles often happen when individuals within the family lack the skills to deal with conflict. Dysfunctional families typically do not have effective communication and coping skills to deal with these interpersonal issues in healthy ways. Moreover, the roots of dysfunctional family roles and addiction often stem from unaddressed challenges with mental health disorders and trauma.\n\nChallenges with trauma, in particular, are often a root cause and/or share a bidirectional relationship with SUD and mental health disorders. Trauma can create a seemingly unending cycle in which the trauma is passed down from one generation to the next. For example, if your parent grew up in an abusive and or dysfunctional household, they are more likely to engage in the same or similar behaviors.\n\nAs noted by the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors, problem behavior like substance use, along with harsh parenting and emotional distress, often continues across generations when left unaddressed. Therefore, understanding dysfunctional family roles in addiction can give you and your loved ones the tools to address and heal the trauma addiction has caused.\n\nTypes of Dysfunctional Family Roles\n\nAccording to “Family Roles, Family Dysfunction, and Depressive Symptoms” by Hanna Zagefka et al., every family has expectations about the roles each person plays. Your role or what you do and how you behave within the family is an explicit rule of the division of labor and behaviors that are considered appropriate for each family member. For example, gender stereotypes often put different role expectations on women and men within a family. While many families settle into roles that function well within the family, addiction can warp those roles. Addiction can lead to these six dysfunctional family roles:\n\nActor-outer\n\nThe individual with addiction\n\nSource of the family’s dysfunctional conflict\n\nHero\n\nTries to make the family look good to the rest of the world\n\nCovers up the actor-outer’s mistakes\n\nThey are a perfectionist\n\nChallenged by feelings of fear, guilt, and shame\n\nMascot\n\nThe comedian of the family\n\nTries to use humor to lessen and distract the family from the distress of the actor-outer’s behavior\n\nChallenged by feelings of embarrassment, shame, and anger\n\nThe lost child\n\nSeen as the black sheep or the silent out of the way family member\n\nOften goes unnoticed by the rest of the family\n\nThey are quiet and reserved\n\nTries not to cause trouble or be a problem\n\nGives up on meeting their emotional needs to avoid talking about the problem\n\nChallenged by feelings of guilt, loneliness, neglect, and anger\n\nScapegoat\n\nPerceived as the problem child\n\nTends to act out in front of others to divert attention from the actor-outer\n\nCan be defiant and hostile in their rebellious efforts to cover for the actor-outer\n\nChallenged by feelings of shame, guilt, and emptiness\n\nCaretaker\n\nThe enabler of the family\n\nTries to keep everyone happy and balance the family while avoiding the actual issue\n\nMakes excuses for the actor-outer’s actions and behavior\n\nPuts on a show of normalcy to people outside of the family\n\nCovers for the actor-outer’s behavior and responsibilities\n\nThe martyr that protects the actor-outer from the consequences of their behavior\n\nChallenged by feelings of inadequacy, fear, and helplessness\n\nWhen left unaddressed, dysfunctional family roles from addiction can morph into codependency. Codependency supports unhealthy relationships and dependency on the people in the dysfunctional family roles to function. While the dysfunctional family roles that are warped by addiction feel overwhelming, healing is possible for the whole family. Seeking support to build healthy coping tools can be vital to addiction recovery and the long-term well-being of the family as a whole.\n\nWays to Heal Dysfunctional Family Roles at New Creation Recovery\n\nAs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) states, well-nurtured family relationships can be a source of comfort, guidance, and strength. Although it will not happen overnight, dismantling dysfunctional family roles and healing is possible. With hard work, you and your loved ones can break the cycle of dysfunctional family roles. Listed below are some of the healthy strategies you can engage in to cultivate and strengthen your relationships with your loved ones:\n\nBuild communication skills\n\nMake time to talk to each other and listen to each other\n\nWork on establishing traditions, values, and goals together\n\nMake a point of spending time together and trying new things together\n\nTry new foods\n\nTake cooking classes\n\nPlay a new board game\n\nStart a book and or movie club\n\nStay active together\n\nHave family dance parties\n\nTake weekly walks\n\nSet exercise goals together\n\nWith support, you can learn how to engage in using healthy coping tools to dismantle dysfunctional family roles. At New Creation Recovery, we recognize the impact codependent behavior in dysfunctional family roles can have on the wellness of the whole family. Everyone wants to help their loved one overcome the challenges of their addiction and lead a long and fulfilling life.\n\nHowever, sometimes the desire to help can hinder treatment when you do not have the tools to address addiction and other issues in healthy ways. Therefore, as a holistic Christian rehab, we are committed to helping you and your loved ones build healthy patterns of behavior, lifelong coping tools, and hope for the future. Through our Christian drug and alcohol rehab treatment centers, we provide a pro-family treatment program to address the unique needs of the whole family."
