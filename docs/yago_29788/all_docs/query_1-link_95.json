        "text": "01 of 30\n\nAmerican Vandal (2017–2018)\n\nAmerican Vandal is a true-crime parody that sees two teenagers investigate juvenile offenses like graffiti with all the seriousness of Making a Murderer. The series, created by Funny or Die’s Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, earned a Peabody Award for its ability to mix the potty humor of its central mysteries with an astute examination of the genre it’s skewering. “The idea of satirizing true-crime docs through the lens of two teen wannabe filmmakers sounds like a nifty idea for a single sketch instead of eight longer-than-half-hour episodes,” writes EW’s critic, “but the longer run time allows Yacenda and Perrault to dig deep into the nuances of high-school friendships, hookups, and rivalries.” —Andrew Walsh\n\nWhere to watch American Vandal: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Tyler Alvarez, Griffin Gluck, Jimmy Tatro\n\nRelated content: American Vandal was too good for this world and we didn't deserve it\n\n02 of 30\n\nArrested Development (2003–2019)\n\nWhen George Bluth Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor) is sent to prison for fraud and “light treason,” his straitlaced son Michael (Jason Bateman) takes over business dealings and struggles to make his wealthy, eccentric family adapt to their new financial reality. The absurd antics of the extended Bluth clan are narrated by showbiz vet Ron Howard and presented in a cinéma vérité style by a now all-star cast that EW’s critic deemed “the best ensemble on TV” back in 2004. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Arrested Development: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, Jeffrey Tambor, Jessica Walter, Portia de Rossi, Alia Shawkat, David Cross, Will Arnett, Ron Howard\n\nRelated content: Jessica Walter's best Arrested Development moments as Lucille Bluth\n\n03 of 30\n\nAstronomy Club: The Sketch Show (2019)\n\nPart sketch series, part fake reality show, this Netflix original from Black-ish creator Kenya Barris stars the improv theater Upright Citizen Brigade’s first all-Black house team. The many skits, ranging from riffs on ASMR to mansplaining, see the cast play heightened versions of themselves living together in a fictional clubhouse in the Hollywood Hills. Astronomy Club may have been canceled after one season, but the six brilliant episodes, featuring guest stars like Ice Cube and Busy Phillipps, are worth repeated viewings. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Astronomy Club: The Sketch Show: Netflix\n\nCast: Jonathan Braylock, Shawtane Bowen, Ray Cordova, Caroline Martin, Jerah Milligan, Monique Moses, Keisha Zollar, James III\n\nRelated content:Black-ish creator Kenya Barris says he left Netflix because it 'became CBS\n\n04 of 30\n\nBeef (2023)\n\nAfter a near collision in a parking lot, business owner Amy Lau (Ali Wong) and contractor Danny Cho (Steven Yeun) engage in a reckless, road rage-fueled chase that escalates into a series of increasingly destructive attempts at revenge. Touching on everything from philosophy to the cost of the American dream, A24’s Beef earned 13 Emmy nominations and won right, including wins for Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series and Outstanding Actor and Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. “Yeun and Wong are exceptional,” writes EW’s critic, who praised the duo for dosing out “physical and intellectual comedy, apoplectic rage and stifled, stomach-churning frustration, abject despair and numbing emptiness… all seamlessly while maintaining the aching humanity of their increasingly unlikable characters.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Beef: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Ali Wong, Steven Yeun, Maria Bello, Joseph Lee, Young Mazino, David Choe, Ashley Park, Patti Yasutake\n\nRelated content: Steven Yeun and Ali Wong broke out in stress hives after filming new series Beef: 'Our bodies shut down'\n\n05 of 30\n\nBig Mouth (2017–present)\n\nThis irreverent animated series chronicles a group of middle schoolers and the sticky (sometimes literally) situations they encounter during puberty. Their raging libidos physically manifest in the form of “Hormone Monsters” voiced by co-creator Nick Kroll, Maya Rudolph, and Thandiwe Newton. In fact, the cast is a who’s who of stars, featuring the likes of Jason Mantzoukas, Ayo Edebiri, and Andrew Rannells, while the wild plotlines tackle everything from furious masturbation to first love. The result, in the words of EW’s critic, is “an endlessly empathetic reminder that everyone is confused, shocked, horrified, and in awe of life pretty much always, especially in times when life’s foundation seems shaky.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Big Mouth: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, Jason Mantzoukas, Maya Rudolph, Thandiwe Newton, Andrew Rannells, Ayo Edebiri, June Diane Raphael, Jessi Klein, Jordan Peele\n\nRelated content:Big Mouth almost had a Queen theme song: Why Nick Kroll chose Charles Bradley's 'Changes'\n\n06 of 30\n\nBoJack Horseman (2014–2020)\n\nYou may not expect an animated comedy about a horse with an alcohol problem to inspire existential dread, but BoJack Horseman packs many emotional punches. The series follows the exploits of the title character (Will Arnett), a washed-up has-been actor (and yes, a horse) who attempts a Hollywood comeback but struggles to escape the shadow of his wholesome starring role on the Full House-style sitcom Horsin’ Around. This sharp satire of the entertainment industry tackles serious issues like addiction and depression while never skimping on the jokes. Whether it’s silly gags like a bartending fish named “Marlin Brando” or a character who’s just three kids in a trench coat, BoJack Horseman will make you laugh and cry, sometimes at the same time. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch BoJack Horseman: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Will Arnett, Amy Sedaris, Alison Brie, Paul F. Tompkins, Aaron Paul\n\nRelated content: BoJack Horseman creator picks 7 introductory episodes for new viewers\n\n07 of 30\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine (2013–2021)\n\nNew York City crime has met its match in the 99th Precinct. Under the guidance of Capt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), the team of detectives that make up Brooklyn’s Nine-Nine squad are determined to make the city’s streets safe again — and to have fun while doing it. A procedural that manages to find the funny in policing, while also providing a surprisingly self-aware commentary on the systemic issues associated with modern law enforcement, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a goofy sitcom that gets smarter and more nuanced as the seasons progress. And if you need more convincing about the show’s charm, there’s no better argument than this iconic cover of a beloved Backstreet Boys song. —Ilana Gordon\n\nWhere to watch Brooklyn Nine-Nine: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Andy Samberg, Stephanie Beatriz, Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Joe Lo Truglio, Chelsea Peretti, Andre Braugher, Dirk Blocker, Joel McKinnon Miller\n\nRelated content: Andre Braugher, Brooklyn Nine-Nine star, dies at 61\n\n08 of 30\n\nCobra Kai (2018–2025)\n\nKarate Kid bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka) has never recovered from his defeat at the hands of underdog champion Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) in 1984’s All-Valley Karate Tournament. Now a middle-aged burnout, Cobra Kai finds the one-time hotshot reviving the titular brutal dojo and its “no mercy” mantra in a last-ditch attempt to relive his glory days, reigniting the long-dormant rivalry between him and LaRusso and tangling their young protégés in their unresolved adolescent beef. “As both men rediscover what drew them to karate in the first place, they inspire (and in Johnny’s case, insult) a new generation of bullied kids,” writes EW’s critic. “The result is an entertaining dramedy that mixes nostalgia and teen angst with an interesting meditation on the ever-shifting definition of masculinity.” The final season is split into three parts (five episodes apiece), the first of which drops on July 18. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Cobra Kai: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: William Zabka, Ralph Macchio, Xolo Maridueña, Mary Mouser, Tanner Buchanan, Jacob Bertrand\n\nRelated content: Cobra Kai creators warn Kreese is 'more dangerous than ever' in season 6\n\n09 of 30\n\nCunk on Earth (2022)\n\nThis send-up of historical docuseries produced by Black Mirror’s Charlie Brooker follows fictional investigative reporter Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) as she interviews real-life experts around the globe on topics like religion and the Renaissance. Cunk on Earth plays like a Daily Show segment spread out across five hours, in which viewers watch the earnest — and ofttimes exasperated — talking heads field inane questions from Morgan’s uproariously daft Cunk. A continuation of the BBC’s Cunk on Britain, this Netflix iteration continues the original’s tradition of combining factual information with absurd belly laughs. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Cunk on Earth: Netflix\n\nCast: Diane Morgan\n\nRelated content: The 20 best British shows on Netflix\n\n10 of 30\n\nDead to Me (2019–2022)\n\nDead to Me sees Christina Applegate play Jen, a recently widowed realtor who joins a grief support group after her husband is killed in a hit-and-run. Despite her desire to keep everyone at arm's length, Jen forms an unexpected friendship with fellow attendee Judy (Linda Cardellini), who is mourning her fiancée and harbors a secret. As the duo connects over drinks and their mutual love of The Facts of Life, Jen soon turns into a “white wine vigilante,” searching for the driver who killed her partner. EW’s critic praises the dark comedy's central relationship, writing, “It’s still all too rare for TV to offer an honest, thoughtful representation of a relationship between two women bonding over life’s challenges and disappointments.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Dead to Me: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nCast: Christina Applegate, Linda Cardellini, James Marsden, Sam McCarthy, Luke Roessler\n\nRelated content:The Dead to Me cast's drinking guide (Karen's orange wine not included)\n\n11 of 30\n\nDerry Girls (2018–2022)\n\nSet in the '90s against the backdrop of Northern Ireland’s Troubles, Derry Girls follows the adventures of five Catholic school outsiders who can’t seem to keep themselves out of mischief. (In one hilariously blasphemous episode, the crew pretends to witness a miracle involving the Virgin Mary to get out of taking a history exam.) Despite the exaggerated shenanigans, the series manages to present a more relatable view of teenage angst than most high school media, with EW’s writer asserting that it “doesn’t so much tug on our heartstrings as pluck at them as it throws us back to the years of dressing garishly, writing fervently in diaries and believing every setback to be the end of the world.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Derry Girls: Netflix\n\nCast: Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Louisa Harland, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, Dylan Llewellyn\n\nRelated content: 5 reasons you should stop everything and watch Derry Girls on Netflix right now\n\n12 of 30\n\nDocumentary Now! (2015–present)\n\nThis anthology series mercilessly spoofs some of the most famous (and infamous) documentaries of our time, and it’s a perfect watch for news aficionados and Saturday Night Live fans alike. A straight-faced Helen Mirren hosts each episode, introducing parodies of classics like Grey Gardens and The War Room. “The show is often a cutting satire of cultural storytelling in general, and how all reporting about reality — people, places, ideas – is unreliable at best, distorting fiction at worst,” writes EW’s critic, who also praised the stellar efforts of core comedy players Fred Armisen and Bill Hader. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Documentary Now!: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Fred Armisen, Bill Hader, Helen Mirren\n\nRelated content: Helen Mirren's guide to her Documentary Now! gig\n\n13 of 30\n\nGLOW (2017–2019)\n\nRuth (Alison Brie) is an out-of-work actress who sleeps with her best friend Debbie’s (Betty Gilpin) husband due to a deep-seated resentment. Desperate for a paying gig, she auditions for a women’s wrestling TV show, but when the enraged Debbie discovers the affair, she pulls up and kicks her ass up and down the ring — leading the producers to cast them both. Inspired by the real Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, this fictional version of the ‘80s series sees the pair work out their relationship through clotheslines and powerbombs. Surrounded by a delightful cast of weirdos — with a scene-stealing, hilarious turn by Marc Maron as sleazy director Sam Sylvia — GLOW is a comedy match-up worth cheering for. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch GLOW: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin, Sydelle Noel, Britney Young, Marc Maron, Britt Baron, Kate Nash, Gayle Rankin\n\nRelated content: Netflix cancels GLOW due to COVID-19 shutdown despite fourth and final season renewal\n\n14 of 30\n\nThe Good Place (2016–2020)\n\nEleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a self-centered sales rep from Arizona, is hit by a truck and finds herself in the afterlife, where she is accidentally assigned to “the Good Place.” Desperate to keep her secret and avoid being sent to “the Bad Place” where she belongs, she enlists the help of Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper), an ethics professor mistakenly designated as her soulmate. To say too much more would give away the surprising twists and turns this half-hour comedy takes on its tour of the other side. An existential comedy about the meaning of existence and what we owe each other, The Good Place will make you laugh while pondering life’s biggest questions. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch The Good Place: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Kristen Bell, William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, D'Arcy Carden, Manny Jacinto, Ted Danson\n\nRelated content: The Good Place finale: Kristen Bell on the emotional 'tough-love ending'\n\n15 of 30\n\nGrace and Frankie (2015–2022)\n\nWhen their husbands (Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston) leave them for each other, these septuagenarian ladies — the type-A, boozy WASP Grace (Jane Fonda) and flighty, pot-loving bohemian Frankie (Lily Tomlin) — are forced to live together as they transition into their new, post-divorce lives. Grace and Frankie proves that comedy doesn’t have an age limit, telling fully fleshed-out stories beyond the typical “old people” jokes (although there are plenty of those as well). With plotlines revolving around vibrators for the arthritic, prescription drug smuggling, and assisted suicide, it’s a sitcom unafraid to push boundaries through punchlines. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Grace and Frankie: Netflix\n\nCast: Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Sam Waterston, Martin Sheen, June Diane Raphael, Brooklyn Decker\n\nRelated content: Vibrators, martinis, and legends being legendary: 11 things we'll miss about Grace and Frankie\n\n16 of 30\n\nI Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson (2019–present)\n\nIf you like your sketch comedy served loud with a side of awkwardness, then look no further than I Think You Should Leave from former SNL writer and Detroiters star Tim Robinson. Its best moments are born from Robinson’s penchant for leaning into cringeworthy social interactions, but it also features several fantastic guest star turns, like Vanessa Bayer’s outrageous send-up of disingenuously self-deprecating Instagram captions. Produced by the Lonely Island trio of Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone, and featuring appearances by Bob Odenkirk, Steven Yeun, Patti Harrison, and Sam Richardson, I Think You Should Leave will have you laughing so hard you just might crash your hot dog car. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson: Netflix\n\nCast: Tim Robinson\n\nRelated content: The 20 best Netflix original series, ranked\n\n17 of 30\n\nInsecure (2016–2021)\n\nInsecure follows best friends Issa (Issa Rae) and Molly (Yvonne Orji) as they navigate their personal and professional lives as millennial Black women in Los Angeles. Created by Rae — and based on her critically acclaimed web series Awkward Black Girl — the show spent five seasons blending storylines like workplace microaggressions and cringe-worthy romantic encounters with the smooth flow of one of Issa’s often hilarious (and sometimes infamous) pep talk mirror raps. Thanks to its razor-sharp writing and acting, the HBO original series earned 14 Emmy nominations and cemented itself as a modern-day classic. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Insecure: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Issa Rae, Yvonne Orji, Natasha Rothwell, Amanda Seales, Jay Ellis, Kendrick Sampson\n\nRelated content:Why the heck Insecure and other HBO titles are heading to Netflix\n\n18 of 30\n\nKey and Peele (2012–2015)\n\nThis Emmy-winning Comedy Central sketch series transformed MADtv alums Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele from ensemble players into bona fide stars. The duo, whom EW dubbed two of its Entertainers of the Year in 2012, created several viral skits during their five-season run (three of which are on Netflix) that earned them famous fans like former President Barack Obama, who himself was one of their most infamously parodied subjects. “[T]he series talks about race, class, society, and even football in a bold, brain-provoking way,” says EW’s writer. “That may sound heavy, but the humor is spry and prone to zigzags, informed and shaped by the minds of two pop-culture-steeped comedy nerds.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Key and Peele: Netflix\n\nCast: Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele\n\nRelated content: Key and Peele: Comedy Central launches online archive of every sketch\n\n19 of 30\n\nKim’s Convenience (2016–2021)\n\nKim’s Convenience centers on the dysfunctional Kim family and their hysterical interactions with each other and the customers of their corner store. Based on the play of the same name by showrunner Ins Choi, this Toronto-based sitcom finds estranged, rebellious Jung (Simu Liu) and wannabe artist Janet (Andrea Bang) butting heads with their old-school immigrant parents. In a loving tribute to the series, EW’s writer penned, “[T]he heart of this program isn't just in the amusing situations our beloved family finds themselves in, but rather in the kernels of familial truth that ring true no matter what shade you are or what country you're from.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Kim’s Convenience: Netflix\n\nCast: Simu Liu, Andrea Bang, Jean Yoon, Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, Andrew Phung, Nicole Power\n\nRelated content: Simu Liu says his comments about the end of Kim's Convenience 'were never meant to be a massive bombshell'\n\n20 of 30\n\nThe Kominsky Method (2018–2021)\n\nSandy Kominsky (Michael Douglas) is a prominent L.A. acting teacher who once had a brush with stardom. Now in his 70s, Sandy and his longtime agent and friend Norman (Alan Arkin) struggle with the realities of aging, grief, and an ever-shifting culture. In addition to the joy of watching two Hollywood legends work their magic together, fans of Douglas' work in Romancing the Stone, Jewel of the Nile, and War of the Roses will want to check out the final two seasons, which reunite the actor with his frequent '80s costar Kathleen Turner, who plays his ex-wife. The Kominsky Method, created by sitcom uber-producer Chuck Lorre (The Big Bang Theory) has earned 12 Emmy nominations and two Golden Globe wins. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch The Kominsky Method: Netflix\n\nCast: Michael Douglas, Alan Arkin, Sarah Baker, Nancy Travis, Paul Reiser, Kathleen Turner\n\nRelated content: With The Kominsky Method, Chuck Lorre writes his most personal show yet\n\n21 of 30\n\nMonty Python’s Flying Circus (1969–1974)\n\nPerhaps the most influential sketch series of all time, the legendary four-season run of the BBC’s Monty Python’s Flying Circus introduced Britain (and later the world) to an experimental style of absurdist humor via skits like The Lumberjack Song, The Spanish Inquisition, and The Dead Parrot. Although the troupe began to fracture around 1973, its legacy has inspired generations of comedians like list mates Key and Peele. “Monty Python’s humor was always an aggressive rebellion against everything stodgy, prim, and proper about postwar, bourgeois Britain,” wrote EW’s staff for the show’s 20th anniversary. “And, as it turned out, their madcap and fearlessly irreverent skittishness and often sophomoric silliness made the world safe for later ensemble comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live.\" —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Monty Python’s Flying Circus: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin\n\nRelated content:Monty Python members reveal which other Python irritates them most\n\n22 of 30\n\nNever Have I Ever (2020–2023)\n\nThis coming-of-age comedy follows the exploits of 15-year-old Devi Vishwakumar (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), who deals with the emotional fallout of her father’s death while juggling school, a complicated relationship with her mother, and an obsessive crush on a classmate. Her acerbic inner monologue (voiced by tennis legend John McEnroe) is a clever meta-commentary on her rage issues, but the lead actress is still the series’ highlight. “Newcomer Ramakrishnan, whom [creator Mindy] Kaling found through an open casting call on Instagram, has remarkable comedic swagger,” writes EW’s critic. “[S]he delivers Devi’s savage takedowns with the cheerful confidence of a young Amy Poehler.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Never Have I Ever: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Poorna Jagannathan, Richa Moorjani, Jaren Lewison, Darren Barnet, Ramona Young, Lee Rodriguez, John McEnroe\n\nRelated content: Never Have I Ever creators explain why the series will end with season 4\n\n23 of 30\n\nOn My Block (2018–2021)\n\nOn My Block kicks off as a group of childhood friends enter high school and experience the highs and lows of adolescence. However, the fraught waters of young love and homework are not the only things they have to navigate; gangs, death, sex, and even a treasure hunt are just some of the extracurricular obstacles in their way. The show — co-created by Lauren Iungerich (Awkward), Eddie Gonzalez, and Jeremy Haft — brings some much-needed diversity to the YA genre. And even if the subject matter is heavy at times, On My Block inspires more smiles than tears as the Freeridge kids find hope and triumph in each other. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch On My Block: Netflix\n\nCast: Sierra Capri, Jason Genao, Brett Gray, Diego Tinoco, Jessica Marie Garcia, Julio Macias\n\nRelated content: On My Block co-creator Lauren Iungerich on Ruby's fate, season 2 cliffhanger\n\n24 of 30\n\nOne Day at a Time (2017–2020)\n\nA reimagined take on Norman Lear’s classic ’70s series, this critically acclaimed reboot shifts the focus to a Cuban American family led by single mother/military veteran Penelope Alvarez (Justina Machado) as she raises two children with the help of her mother, Lydia (the legendary Rita Moreno). Though filmed as a typical multi-camera sitcom — complete with a studio audience — One Day at a Time tackles fresh stories beyond the traditional fare, touching on queerness, mental health, gentrification, racism, and more. “You don’t have to be Cuban, an immigrant, gay, or a recovering addict to understand and/or to feel understood, and such is the beauty of this show,” says EW’s writer, which only made its cancellation hurt that much more. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch One Day at a Time: Netflix\n\nCast: Justina Machado, Todd Grinnell, Isabella Gomez, Marcel Ruiz, Stephen Tobolowsky, Rita Moreno\n\nRelated content: One Day at a Time executive producers reveal the stories you never got to see\n\n25 of 30\n\nRussian Doll (2019–2022)\n\nRussian Doll is a Groundhog Day-style comedy in which sardonic New Yorker Nadia (Natasha Lyonne) meets her untimely demise on her 36th birthday, only to relive the same 24 hours over and over again. She soon hooks up with the down-on-his-luck Alan (Charlie Barnett), a fellow time loop prisoner, and the two work together to escape the cycle while repeatedly dying in comically gruesome ways. The darkly funny series earned 13 Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Lyonne and a writing nod for co-creators Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland (Bachelorette). —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Russian Doll: Netflix\n\nCast: Natasha Lyonne, Charlie Barnett, Greta Lee, Elizabeth Ashley, Chloe Sevigny, Annie Murphy\n\nRelated content: Russian Doll was almost a very different show starring Jordan Peele\n\n26 of 30\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off (2023)\n\nThirteen years after the comic book adaptation Scott Pilgrim vs. the World became a cult classic, Edgar Wright returns to produce this anime continuation with the original all-star cast. The hyperkinetic love story of bass player Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) battling Ramona Flowers’ (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) seven evil exes was fertile ground for an animated update, and it shocked viewers by ejecting our titular hero “in order to show viewers more about his friends, enemies, and lovers,” EW’s critic analyzed. “But instead of coming off like a cheap ploy, it demonstrates a wise maturity. There’s more to someone else’s life than being your girlfriend’s ‘evil ex,’ after all; maybe you aren't the center of the universe. These are important life lessons delivered in an extremely entertaining way.\" —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Scott Pilgrim Takes Off: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Brie Larson, Kieran Culkin, Anna Kendrick, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Schwartzman\n\nRelated content: Bread still makes you fat!

When Seinfeld debuted in 1989, it introduced viewers to the idiosyncratic exploits of New York comedian Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld), his ex-girlfriend Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), best friend George (Jason Alexander), kooky neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards), and a parade of memorable side characters and guest stars. EW’s critic wrote in 1992 that Seinfeld is “one of the purest of all TV-viewing pleasures” in part for its simplicity, proving that “...the little things that happen to all of us — forgetting where you parked your car in a mall garage, waiting too long for a table in a restaurant — are the true stuff of comedy.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Seinfeld: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A (read the review)\n\nCast: Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards\n\nRelated content: Seinfeld cast: Where are they now?\n\n28 of 30\n\nSex Education (2019–2023)\n\nOtis (Asa Butterfield), the teenage son of prominent sex therapist Dr. Jean Milburn (Gillian Anderson), opens a secret sex therapy clinic at Moordale Secondary School with fellow student Maeve Wiley (Emma Mackey) to help his classmates navigate the birds and the bees (and make some extra cash along the way). But Otis soon finds himself developing feelings for his business partner — and learns he is much better at dishing out advice than he is at taking it. “A sweet, progressive British dramedy from newcomer Laurie Nunn, Sex Education… blends teen sex-romp tropes with a refreshing level of empathy,” writes EW’s critic. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Sex Education: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Asa Butterfield, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, Gillian Anderson, Connor Swindells, Kedar Williams-Stirling, Aimee Lou Wood, Mimi Keene, Patricia Allison, Tanya Reynolds\n\nRelated content: Gillian Anderson originally put Sex Education script in the garbage\n\n29 of 30\n\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (2015–2020)\n\nAfter being held captive in an underground bunker for 15 years by a charismatic cult leader, Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) moves to New York City to restart her life. There, the naïve, bright-eyed woman moves in with a cynical, down-on-his-luck actor (Tituss Burgess), and the two push each other to look at the world in new ways. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is filled with double entendres, silly puns, and slapstick humor, but underneath it all lies a heartwarming story about the resilience of the human spirit and the power of friendship. —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nCast: Ellie Kemper, Tituss Burgess, Carol Kane, Jane Krakowski\n\nRelated content: Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt composer talks creating the show's earworm (and empowering) theme song\n\n30 of 30\n\nThe Upshaws (2021–present)\n\nBennie Upshaw (Mike Epps) and his wife Regina (Kim Fields) try to balance work, romance, and their three kids while coping with the consequences of his past extramarital affair with Tasha (Gabrielle Dennis) and her and Bennie’s son, Kelvin (Diamond Lyons). Tensions notably come to a head between Bennie and his sister-in-law Lucretia (a game Wanda Sykes) because of his past infidelity, which provides some of the sitcom's funniest moments via razor-sharp one-liner wars. EW’s critic likened the dialogue to “an old-school, Norman Lear-style rhythm to the writing” while praising how the series co-created by Regina Y. Hicks (Insecure) “juices the multicamera-family-sitcom model with fresh dynamics, depth, and genuine laughs.” —A.W.\n\nWhere to watch The Upshaws: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B+ (read the review)\n\nCast: Mike Epps, Kim Fields, Khali Spraggins, Wanda Sykes, Journey Christine, Jermelle Simon, Diamond Lyons, Gabrielle Dennis\n\nRelated content: Kim Fields reveals what aspect of shooting The Upshaws felt like 'the beginning of a Marvel movie'"
