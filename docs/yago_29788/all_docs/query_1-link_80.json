        "text": "We are devastated to announce the death of Gilbert Gottfried who was slated to be with us next week at Ebertfest. We are dedicating the Festival to him and will show the documentary about his life. My heart and condolences go out to his wife Dara and their children, and to his sister and extended family. - Chaz Ebert\n\nHere are the guests scheduled to attend Ebertfest 2022, either in person, or by satellite, starting next Wednesday, April 20th, through Saturday, April 23rd, at the Virginia Theatre in Champaign. Below they are listed in order of appearance.\n\nAlso be sure to enjoy this video clip of Ebertfest put together for us by one of our sponsors, Fandor/Cinedigm.\n\n<span id=\"selection-marker-1\" class=\"redactor-selection-marker\"></span>\n\nWEDNESDAY, APRIL 20th\n\n7pm \"SUMMER OF SOUL\" (Performing his song, \"Roger Ebert\")\n\nEEF BARZELAY, a.k.a Clem Snide\n\nThe last ten years have been a rollercoaster of deep despair and amazing opportunities that somehow present themselves at the last possible second,” says Eef Barzelay. “During that time, the band bottomed out, I lost my house, and I had to declare bankruptcy. The only way to survive was to try to transcend myself, to find some kind of deeper, spiritual relationship with life. Once I committed to that, all these little miracles started happening.”\n\n\"Forever Just Beyond,\" Barzelay’s stunning new album under the Clem Snide moniker, may just be the most miraculous of them all. Produced by Scott Avett, the record is a work of exquisite beauty and profound questioning, a reckoning with faith and reality that rushes headlong into the unknown and the unknowable. The songs here grapple with hope and depression, identity and perception, God and the afterlife, humanizing thorny existential issues and delivering them with the intimate, understated air of a late-night conversation between old friends. Avett’s production is similarly warm and inviting, and the careful, spacious arrangement of gentle guitars and spare percussion carves a wide path for Barzelay’s insightful lyrics and idiosyncratic delivery.\n\nNamed for a William S. Borroughs character, Clem Snide first emerged from Boston as a three-piece in the early 1990’s, and the group would go on to become a cult and critical favorite, picking up high profile fans from Bon Iver to Ben Folds over the course of three decades and more than a dozen studio albums. NPR highlighted the Israeli-born Barzelay as “the most underrated songwriter in the business today, with a sneakily firm grasp on poignancy and humor,” while Rolling Stone hailed his songwriting as “soulful and incisive,” and The New Yorker praised his music’s “soothing melodies and candid wit.”\n\nTAMMY McCANN, opening night performer\n\nNamed the Chicago Tribune’s 2020 person of the Year in Jazz, Tammy McCann is an internationally recognized Jazz Vocalist and is currently Artist in Residence for the Music Institute of Chicago. Her powerful, sultry, and emotionally charged voice paints pictures and tells stories by merging Classical vocal technique and Gospel esthetic with Jazz to create a sound that is completely her own. Chicago Tribune’s Arts Critic, Howard Reich says McCann has, “A voice that soars in all registers, at all tempos, on all occasions... a voice that inspires wonder!” Alyce Claerbaut, President of Strayhorn Songs Publishing, Inc. and mentor to McCann says, “Tammy is a star with a one-of-a-kind voice.”\n\nTammy is a storyteller who draws emotion from and makes connections with here audiences world- wide. Her warm delivery allows her audience to go on the musical journey with her and her engaging personality imprints the memory of her performance on their hearts. Inside Jazz Magazine Music Critic, Nora McCarthy says “She came bearing natural gifts and with raw talent in hand, she stepped up to the mic and into the hearts of everyone in the room.” As an educator, Tammy believes singing is a part of every human community; bringing us together and helping us to interact with one another. There is a pedagogy to Jazz vocal instruction which requires an approach that can combine the \"classroom and the bandstand\" in a seamless way. Her teaching style meets the vocal student where they are and all instruction has a classical foundation with a focus on Jazz. All lessons help to develop a natural technique and allow the student to progress at their own pace. Through which the students gain the confidence they need to audition and perform.\n\nTammy McCann has performed with such luminaries Chicago’s own Ramsey Lewis & NEA Jazz Master Von Freeman, John Clayton, Branford Marsalis,Joe Locke, Charles McPherson, Dee Dee Bridgewater,Carmen Bradford and toured as a ‘Raelette’ with the great Ray Charles. McCann has thrilled audiences in festivals and clubs world- wide from Bangkok,Thailand to the Harrods Atticus in Greece. As well as the nation’s premier concert and Jazz venues, Carnegie Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center , Birdland, The Blue Note, Dizzy’s Club Coca Cola and Chicago's own Jazz Showcase. Cultural & Jazz Critic Stanley Crouch says, “Her pitch is superb…clear on the top and startling at the bottom, while all of the steps in between are polished with swing. \" Her shows are not to be missed.\n\nTHER'UP.Y, opening night performer\n\nFronted by Aplustrodamus (Aaron Wilson) this is a band fondly known for being the House Band of Soul On Sunday-a show geared towards the arts of Live Music,Comedy,and Poetry. A highly skilled band with a plethora of amazingly talented musicians who can play and sound like every one. Ther'Up.Y isn't limited to a particular genre of music, playing Reggae, Gospel, Blues, Folk, Jazz, and Country. The unique spelling of the band's name came from an old saying the band-leader's grandma used to say when family and friends were looking for him. She would say, \"he is, oh, there uppa yonder!\" The phrase turned out \"Ther'Up.Y\" (pronounced Therapy) and the name resonated as a moniker for a band that aimed for a therapeutic music that can be enjoyed by all.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21st\n\n9:30am BONUS SNEAK PREVIEW! \"PHANTOM OF THE OPEN\"\n\nMICHAEL BARKER, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics\n\nBarker is bringing \"Phantom of the Open,\" a special Sneak Preview starring Mark Rylance and Sallie Hawkins based on a true story.\n\nMichael Barker, Co-President and Co-Founder of Sony Pictures Classics, has (with Tom Bernard) distributed, and often produced, some of the finest independent movies over the past 30 years.

Thora has acted professionally since the age of 4 and a half.\n\nTERRY ZWIGOFF, director of \"Ghost World\"\n\nBorn in Appleton, Wisconsin, Zwigoff held several jobs before making his breakthrough feature: the documentary Crumb (1994) in 1994. His previous jobs included musician, shipping clerk, printer and welfare office worker. In fact, Zwigoff traces his film career back to discovering a rare blues recording by an unknown Chicago blues musician he discovered in 1978. The experience of the two years spent researching this artist, a highly eccentric Howard Armstrong, became Zwigoff's first film project, a documentary titled Louie Bluie (1985) which premiered at Telluride and Sundance before its theatrical run. Zwigoff's next project became the toast of the festival circuit in 1994.\n\nA documentary on the underground comic artist Robert Crumb, \"Crumb\" won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance as well as citations from the New York and Los Angeles Film Critics and the Directors Guild of America. It also became the third highest grossing documentary of all time and was on over 150 Ten Best Lists by years end. However, along with another 1994 documentary hopeful Hoop Dreams (1994), its failure to win even a nomination in the 1994 Academy Awards' Best Documentary Feature category caused an uproar that resulted in a demand to change the way the Academy voters choose the documentary feature nominees. \"Crumb\" chronicled Zwigoff's acquaintance of nearly two decades of Robert Crumb's life, career, the underground comic scene as well as Crumb's dysfunctional family. Even though it caused a momentary rift between the documentarian and the comic book artist, it has been reported that they have reconciled and are currently collaborating on a screenplay called \"The New Girlfriend\".\n\nEven with the enormous success of \"Crumb\", Zwigoff refused to sell out to Hollywood. His aversion to corporate commercialism is a well-known trademark. He turned down many more commercial projects while he struggled for five years to make a feature film out of Daniel Clowes's underground comic strip \"Ghost World\". Released in 2001, Ghost World (2001) became the summer art house hit and captured Golden Globe nominations for Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch, who played the teenage protagonist Enid. \"Ghost World\" also brought acclaim for Zwigoff and his co-screenwriter Daniel Clowes, a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay in the 2002 Academy Awards. Ghost World wound up on over 150 Ten Best Lists for 2001.\n\nMATT FAGERHOLM, Literary Editor of RogerEbert.com\n\nMatt Fagerholm is the Literary Editor at RogerEbert.com and is a member of the Chicago Film Critics Association.
