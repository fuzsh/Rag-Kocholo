        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: The pulpy holiday flick Merry Good Enough starring Raye And Sawyer Spielberg will receive a UK release on November 11 from Kaleidoscope Home Entertainment.\n\nThe company’s distribution arm, Kaleidoscope Film Distribution (KFD), has also boarded international sales rights on the pic. In the U.S., a limited theatrical run is planned for this winter.\n\nDescribed as “gritty,” the holiday film is directed by Caroline Keene and Dan Kennedy and follows a dysfunctional family navigating the holiday season together after their mother disappears on Christmas Eve.\n\nRaye Spielberg stars as Lucy Raulie alongside Joel Murray (Mad Men), who is the family’s charismatic but difficult patriarch. Rounding out the ensemble cast is Sawyer Spielberg (Masters of the Air) as Lucy’s low-key neighbor Sam along with Susan Gallagher (Cobra Kai), Neil Casey (Ghostbusters), Comfort Clinton (FBI), and Sophie von Haselberg (Give Me Pity).\n\nCo-directed by Keene and Kennedy from a script penned by Keene, Merry Good Enough is produced by Vagrants Originals. Producers are Jamieson Shea, Krista Minto, Genevieve Skehan, Shawn Gauvain, and Christian Hall.\n\n“We’re delighted to bring Merry Good Enough to international audiences and are confident that our partners will recognize the originality and quality on show,” said Spencer Pollard, CEO of Kaleidoscope Film Distribution. “We look forward to introducing the film at TIFF.”\n\nKeene and Kennedy added: “Led by Raye Spielberg’s indelible performance as the sharp but warm-hearted Lucy, we couldn’t be more excited to share our version of a holiday classic.”"
