        "text": "I laughed my butt off.\n\nThat said, Eddie Griffin doesn't mince words. He has little reverence for the politically correct. He swears like my Honda 250 spits oil and uses the N-word like verbal punctuation.\n\nHaving really enjoyed \"Undercover Brother,\" I went out of my way to catch this film and ended up laughing so hard, I cried at times.\n\nDocumentary-style interludes stengthen this comedian concert film. These segments capture Eddie's uncles and mothers talking candidly about such personal history that most of us would never speak candidly about -- especially not with a camera around (i.e. pornography, drugs, jail time, child-whoopin').\n\nSurprising yes, but these comments bring yet another level of sincerity to the production. With these family members also sitting in the front row, Eddie's humorous monologue works in their quirks and unpleasantries with a not very often scene brutally honest warmth.\n\nBut seriously folks, you should know yourselves by now ... if you're the type of person that doesn't mind being graphically ribbed when it comes to sex, politics or religion; then you might just have a great time. (btw, I'd also suggest \"Notorious Cho.\") If, however, swearing bothers you, if the N-word bothers you, if you never take the Lord's name in vain -- don't go!\n\nAlso kudos to the director, the concert is filmed sharply, with well-placed roving cameras and plenty of crisp close-in shots to accent the comedy. Kudos to the editing as well -- liked the daring 1/2 dissolves."
