        "text": "Watching Breaking Bad has inspired Nicolas Cage to retire from acting in films for good. The Face/Off star teased in a recent interview with Uproxx that he is seriously considering retiring from the big screen. The Oscar winner has appeared in well over one hundred movies. However, Cage has signed on for a few more projects that he has to fulfill in the next year or so. In 2023 alone, he starred in five films, in addition to an AI cameo in The Flash.\n\nCage’s first film was in 1983’s Valley Girl, and he tells the publication that after 45 years of acting in films, “I feel I’ve pretty much said what I’ve had to say with cinema. And I’d like to leave on a high note and say, ‘Adios.'” This doesn’t mean that Cage is leaving the world of acting altogether. After a handful of more movies before he can “get there,” he says he will “hopefully” switch formats and go into another way of expressing his acting. He would’ve liked to have left on a “high note” with A24’s Dream Scenario which was released in theaters last month, but he’s contractually obligated to finish out a few more roles. “I am going to be very severe and very astringent on the selection process moving forward,” Cage declares. “But for me to do another movie, I do want to explore other formats.”\n\nRELATED: Nicolas Cage Was Convinced He Was An ‘Alien’ As A Child\n\nInterestingly enough, it turns out Cage doesn’t watch television. That is until his son introduced him to the format and recommended he watch Breaking Bad a year ago. He was mesmerized by Bryan Cranston’s Walter White “stare at a briefcase for an hour.” He called the show “magnificent” and said that he is “very interested in immersion streaming with episodic television.“ Celebrating his 60th birthday next month, Cage hopes he will be lucky enough to have more years than his father, who passed away at 75, did. What he holds dear to him in the next fifteen years is his children. “And if I can find an episodic show to do that stays in one place where I don’t have to keep leaving, we can all be together,” Cage adds.\n\nThe 10 Most Popular TV Shows to Watch Before Bed\n\nLaila Abuelhawa is the Top 40 and Hip-Hop pop culture writer for Beasley Media Group.
