        "text": "The Pitts (Fox, 2003)\n\nThis is yet another American sitcom that I vaguely remember watching at the time, and this one has a story which is possibly more strange than anything that happened in the actual episodes. The Pitts is essentially a sitcom about the world’s unluckiest family. This means that the title has a double meaning, because they are the Pitts family, and their life is also the pits, er, yes.\n\nThe Pitts consisted of the parents Bob and Liz, and their teenage children Faith and Petey. The episodes were almost on a cartoon scale, because if the worst could happen to them, then it did. There were some rather odd but creative ideas, including buying possessed cars, turning into werewolves, hiring crazed babysitters, finding ventriloquist’s dummies that seem to have a mind of their own, and much more.\n\nBob and Liz also work into a shop together and try to stay positive about life, but they never know what strange thing will happen to them or the children next. However, because of the way that this was scheduled in America and this country, it could be considered that maybe this show was jinxed for real. This originally formed part of yet another overhyped can’t fail crazy comedy night special for the Fox channel.\n\nBut this was pulled from the schedule after only five episodes, and the final two weren’t shown. Even having Seth MacFarlane (of Family Guy/American Dad! fame) as the consulting producer and a guest appearance from Dan Castellaneta (of The Simpsons fame) couldn’t excite viewers. If anything, this was treated even worse in this country. This must’ve been one of the final imported sitcoms that was shown on ITV1.\n\nBut in the mid-2000s, ITV1 treated a lot of their shows very sloppily, including this one. The first episode was shown on a Saturday evening, and the second was moved to a Sunday evening, before vanishing completely. About three months later, all of the episodes (including the two that were never shown in America) turned up on ITV2, which is probably the channel that this should’ve been on in the first place.\n\nAnd Kellie Waymire, who played Liz (and appeared in lots of other shows over the years), died suddenly about six months after this ended, at the age of 36. Then, in 2007, Fox briefly considered reviving The Pitts, but this time as an actual cartoon. Some of the original cast were back on board to provide the voices (with Liz’s part being recast). But in 2008, it was decided not to go any further with this, and that really was the end.\n\nThe Sketch Show (Fox, 2005)\n\nThis is a show that I did know about, but I had forgotten that it had all happened, until I came across this on YouTube recently whilst trying to find something else, as does happen to me sometimes. The Sketch Show launched on ITV1 in 2001. This was a sketch comedy that featured no recurring characters or catchphrases, just some fast-moving amusing ideas that were performed by five up-and-coming comic talents.\n\nAmong the cast were Tim Vine and Lee Mack. Now I remember being pleased that they were finally given a comedy show to appear in together, because I had thought that they were great for a while, and they should be on TV doing this type of thing. Also featuring among the cast were Jim Tavaré, Karen Taylor, and Ronni Ancona, who have gone on to much more success in comedy shows as well.\n\nThere were two series of this, but course, ITV1 had lost interest by the end, and it’s been said that two editions were never even shown. As always, a rather good idea is thrown away. This has only been released on DVD in Australia curiously. But a few years on from this, there was an attempt at an American version. The idea would be the same, with five more performers who were fairly new to TV put together.\n\nThese included Mary Lynn Rajskub and Paul F Tompkins (yes, really!). The producer for this version was Kesley Grammer, trying to find something a little different to do after Frasier had ended. It could be said that this was sold on his name a little too much. This was sometimes called Kelsey Grammer Presents The Sketch Show, and he actually only appeared in the opening and closing sketches.\n\nAlso among the cast was Lee Mack, who had been in the original version of course, meaning that he briefly had a go on American TV. A lot of the sketches were recycled from the British version, which once again raised the question of whether such humour can ever translate to American viewers, not really it seems. Some of them probably had some trouble understanding Mack’s Lancashire twang as well.\n\nThere were also these odd bumpers between some sketches featuring the cast making some silly faces. Another similarity between this and the original version was that this was pulled from the schedule with two of the six editions remaining unaired. Fox then replaced this with another new comedy that they wanted to try out called American Dad… which was a success and, almost two decades on, is still going.\n\nThe Tracey Ullman Show (Fox, 1987-1990)\n\nThis is another comedy show that I don’t remember from the time, but I think that this has an interesting story. This is because this is a rather rare example of an English-born comedian trying to further her career and find success in America… and succeeding. In the early-80s, Tracey Ullman found fame as an actress, in shows including Three Of A Kind and Girls On Top, and as a singer, having some hit singles.\n\nShe then went off to America, and appeared in a few films. In 1987 she was given her own comedy sketch show on the cable channel Fox. She played a variety of characters, and among the supporting cast were Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner (who didn’t realise that they would still be working together many years later). Tracey definitely caused a stir with American viewers, and gained plenty of laughs.\n\nHer show was soon winning awards for Fox, helping to establish this channel. One of the highlights were the bizarre short animated sketches featuring a dysfunctional family who were created by Matt Groening (who at the time was known for his comic strip A Life In Hell). Castellaneta and Kavner were among those who voiced these characters. And of course, they became popular enough to get their own spin-off sitcom in 1989 as The Simpsons.\n\nLittle did they realise that, 35 years and 756 episodes later, it’s still going. Some editions of The Tracey Ullman Show were shown on BBC2, but they attracted little attention (editing out the Simpsons sketches didn’t help). Some critics felt that she had become too Americanised in her style. They also felt that although she had done well, her best work had been in this country.\n\nGoing into the 90s, Tracey appeared in A Class Act, a one-off special made for ITV (which also formed part of Meridian’s bid for the south of England franchise, which it won). This led to another special, Tracey Takes On New York, made for the American cable channel HBO. In the late-90s, this was developed into the HBO series Tracey Takes On…, some editions were shown on Channel 5, but again, British viewers didn’t get too excited.\n\nMany years later, in the mid-2010s, she returned to this country for BBC1’s Tracey Ullman’s Show. Another lot of characters featured in sketches, many were pleased to see her back, and she clearly hadn’t lost any of her ability to amuse. This led to the spin-off series Tracey Breaks The News, where she did impressions of various celebrities and politicians.\n\nMalcolm In The Middle (Fox, 2000-2006)\n\nThis is another American sitcom that I must admit I haven’t watched a huge amount over the years, but I am definitely aware that this is considered to be one of the most popular (and indeed funniest) of its era. The main character is Malcolm (not to be confused with that weird puppet thing on that game show that I reviewed recently).\n\nHe is “in the middle” because he lives with his parents Hal and Lois, and two of his brothers, Reece is older than him, and Dewey is younger (his other older brother Francis is away). Malcolm is a rather bright boy, with an IQ that is well above-average, but he doesn’t always find school to be an easy experience. His only real friend is Stevie, who helps him along the way.\n\nBut despite is supposed cleverness, when he is at home, he squabbles with his brothers just as much as any other family does. His parents often have trouble keeping everything under control, including his short-tempered mother who works at a department store. Malcolm sometimes can’t help but wonder what life is all about, and reflects on his situations in pieces straight to camera.\n\nAs the series progressed, more attention is made to the aging of the children than there is in most sitcoms. Malcolm entered his teenage years, Francis got married, and Lois eventually gave birth once again, bringing a fifth son into the family. Malcolm didn’t consider his parents to be fairly odd though, because that was another show. This was definitely a step above the “everybody in my family is crazy”-type sitcoms that there have been so many of.\n\nThere were 151 episodes of Malcolm In The Middle in seven series, and they have all been released on DVD. This was first shown in this country on Sky One, but really took off when episodes were shown on BBC2, often shown after The Simpsons, to create a rather satisfying double-bill. In more recent years, there have been repeat runs on various other channels.\n\nThe theme music “Boss Of Me” was provided by They Might Be Giants, and this also became a hit single, making this the first time that they had been on the UK chart for over a decade. There was also a memorable parody in Family Guy, even accounting for the fact that they have now parodied just about every other show on TV, this one still managed to stand out. I’m talking to you!\n\nGrounded For Life (Fox, 2001-2002, WB, 2002-2005)\n\nThis is an American sitcom that was shown in a late-night slot on ITV1 for a while (you barely see any home-made sitcoms on ITV now, never mind imported ones). Grounded For Life centred around the Finnerty family, who live in Staten Island, New York. Sean and Claudia got married when they were 18, and they now have three children, Lily, Jimmy, and Henry.\n\nThey are beginning to reach their awkward years, meaning that, despite only being in their early-30s themselves, they realise that their children are almost teenagers. The other main cast members are Sean’s younger brother Eddie, and his dad Walt, who often gives advice on how the family should be run, whether it’s asked for or not. Sean sees himself as a modern, easy-going dad, but parenting’s just as tough for him as anybody else.\n\nThe idea is that it is Sean and Claudia who feel like they are the ones who are grounded, not the children! Grounded For Life starred Donal Logue, who had previously been in the CBS sitcom Public Morals in 1996, which was so badly received that it was pulled from the schedule after only one episode (although all 13 that were made were shown in this country on ITV). This one did manage to do better though.\n\nThis was also another of those sitcoms which had a “my totally crazy dysfunctional family” feel (and according to the opening sequence, they all like to play basketball together), but this was all rather overshadowed by Malcolm In The Middle, which launched around the same time and tackled a similar idea with more energy and wit.\n\nJust after the start of the third series, Grounded For Life was dropped by Fox, and continued on WB, running for a few more series. By the end, Claudia had gone and popped out a fourth child, to much excitement. There were 91 episodes in total, but I don’t think that the later ones were shown on ITV1, although there were some repeat runs on Trouble too. But the story doesn’t end there.\n\nIn 2011, BBC1 launched In With The Flynns, which was a British remake of Grounded For Life, and starred Will “Jambo” Mellor in the lead role as the equivalent of Sean Finnerty. There were two series, including some episodes written by Simon Nye. But the reviews were rather middling, arguing that after Outnumbered and the like had revolutionised the domestic sitcom in this country, this rather more traditional take on the idea came across as rather redundant.\n\nDouble Dare (Nickelodeon, 1986-1987, 1990-1993, Fox, 1988)\n\nThis is the original version of the rather ridiculous game show that came to this country as part of CBBC’s Saturday Morning show Going Live! in 1987. Double Dare launched in America a year earlier in 1986, and helped to establish a game show element in the schedule of the increasingly popular at the time children’s channel Nickelodeon.\n\nThis version was hosted by Marc Summers, who had a lot of enthusiasm, but unlike our dear friend the award-winning Peter Simon who hosted the UK version, he also had the gift of being able to walk properly. Two teams of two took part, although there were a few differences to what happened in the UK. Firstly, the teams had names, and they began with a game to get control, cheered on by an overexcited studio audience. On your marks, get set, go!\n\nQuestions were then asked (which also appeared on the screen) such as “which president got stuck in the bathtub?”, and they were worth money rather than points. If you don’t know the answer though, you can dare your opponents to have a try, but beware, because they could double dare it back! If still no-one knows, it’s time to play a physical challenge.\n\nThis was where the team had to complete a challenge, usually in around 20 or 30 seconds, so make sure that you’ve got your kneepads on. There are usually about two of three of these played per show, so lots of money could be won. Watch out for when the hooter goes though, because that’s the end of part one, and going into the second part, the money values are all doubled!\n\nWhen the second hooter goes, it’s the end of the game. The losing team take away some consolation prizes though including a bag of Skittles, but the winners progress to play the obstacle course! In the final, there are eight obstacles, that all contain a flag. They have to find all eight of them in 60 seconds, to win some really big prizes. Now it can be done, and it ends up with a big mess everywhere. Repeat for years.\n\nThere were also various spin-off series that were shown on a few other channels along with Nickelodeon in America. These included Family Double Dare, Super Sloppy Double Dare, and Double Dare 2000, along with a computer game too. In more recent years there have also been further revivals, along with a stage show that Summers was also involved with.\n\nNew Girl (Fox, 2011-2018)\n\nThis is another American sitcom that caught my attention. I am not that hugely interested in films, but I have enjoyed some of the work of Zooey Deschanel, who has put in some amusing and quirky performances in various films including (500) Days Of Summer and Yes Man. So when I discovered that Zooey was going to feature in a TV sitcom I was definitely interested.\n\nThree young men anticipate the arrival of a new flatmate, presuming that it will be somebody else who is rather like them, but it turns out that it’s a woman?! Well, it’s fair to say that they definitely weren’t expecting this and it turns their macho world upside-down. New Girl (avoiding the obvious thought “how can they still be a new girl after the first episode?”) starred Deschanel as Jessica, a teacher, and words used to describe her were often around the area of bubbly, offbeat, and quirky.\n\nThe men were Nick, Winston, and Schmidt (keeping up a sitcom tradition of a character who is only known by their surname), who have had various jobs, including being a basketball player for a short while, and also featuring is Jessica’s childhood friend Cece. What an ensemble they are. Of course, as the episodes progress, their love lives have plenty of changes, and there were breakups, weddings, and everything inbetween.\n\nNew Girl could be considered to be a little too cute and rather heavy on the hugging when compared to the average UK sitcom, but there was still plenty to enjoy, and Deschanel definitely adapted herself well and gained lots of laughs. There were also plenty of guest stars, and there was much surprise when Prince, who never usually did that kind of thing, made a special appearance. Let’s hope that he spoke up.\n\nTrying to get into New Girl was rather difficult because of the way it was scheduled in the UK. It originally started in a primetime slot on Channel 4, which I was pleased about because I felt that it deserved that level of exposure, but unsurprisingly it was moved rather quickly to E4, before it was seemingly increasingly neglected, featuring in various daytime slots, before it vanished altogether.\n\nThere were 146 episodes of New Girl in seven series, but the final three series haven’t been released on DVD in this country, unlike America where they have all been released, which is rather frustrating too. I don’t know why they stopped, but the ones that are available feature a decent amount of extras including deleted scenes. Overall it was an enjoyable sitcom, and I look forward to seeing more of Deschanel soon.\n\nBeetlejuice (ABC, 1989-1991, Fox, 1991)\n\nHere’s a look back at another cartoon that was on CITV rather regularly in the early-90s, there really were a lot of them, weren’t there. Having been interested in rather spooky shows over the years, it seems fairly obvious that I would take an interest in this one. In 1988, comedy horror film Beetlejuice starring Michael Keaton was released, and it was a big success.\n\nBecause of this, there was determination to do some more. A sequel never happened though, instead it was turned into a children’s cartoon, under the watch of the film’s director Tim Burton. The format was changed a little, but the basic idea was the same. I must admit I’m more familiar with the cartoon version than the film. Beetlejuice was a ghost, who wore a striped suit, had a purple face, and bright green teeth. He could also change shape, his head often span round, and he liked to eat bugs. He also liked to play pranks on people.\n\nOne day he befriends Lydia Deetz, a girl who is in her early-teens and likes the spookier things in life. Lydia would say Beetlejuice’s name three times, at which point he was summoned and they would go on their adventures. Together they like to explore the Neitherworld, which contains all kinds of strange things, including ghosts, monsters, and zombies. The show is set in the fictional town Peaceful Pines.\n\nLydia’s parents Charles and Delia can’t really believe what she has caught herself up in. And neither can their long-suffering cat Percy. We also meet some of Lydia’s friends that attend Miss Shannon’s School For Girls, who include Bertha and Prudence. She definitely wasn’t fond of Claire though, who thought she was rather marvellous. This was a cartoon that was packed with lots of quirky ideas.\n\nThere were 94 episodes of Beetlejuice containing 109 segments. The fourth and final series which moved from ABC to Fox ran for a whopping 65 episodes, they just couldn’t stop themselves, and some later episodes included parodies of other films. There were lots of episodes released on VHS and DVD throughout the years, and plenty of books and computer games were also released based on the show.\n\nBeetlejuice was first shown in this country in 1991 as part of the Saturday Morning show Motormouth, and by 1992 it had moved to the main CITV afternoon strand. I also remember that around this time when the show was on CITV, there was a big poster on the wall behind Tommy Boyd in the studio, and as you should know by now, any show that got Tommy’s endorsement was definitely worth watching.\n\nThe Cleveland Show (Fox, 2009-2013)\n\nBy the late-2000s, Family Guy become one of the most successful animated sitcoms for older viewers. Despite being cancelled twice, it constantly came back and eventually established itself. By this point, the show had been running for a decade, and the characters had become very familiar, so why not launch a spin-off series? Along with this and American Dad, Seth Macfarlane would now have three comedy cartoons on the go. Which cast member would it feature though?\n\nWould it be Glen “Giggity” Quagmire? Or maybe it could be Joe Swanson? Well actually it was neither of them. Cleveland Brown was probably not the first choice viewers would pick for a spin-off series. He was in Peter Griffin’s circle of friends, and originally he was a delicatessen owner, who was married to Loretta, and had one son who was Cleveland Jr.\n\nHe was rather dour though, and he would say things in a rather boring voice (although he didn’t have the most boring voice that I’ve ever heard in a sitcom) including “ooh, that’s nasty”, seemingly an early attempt at a catchphrase. Apart from a running gag where he fell out of the bath in every other episode, it was clear that he would need to have a little more excitement in his life to make it work.\n\nSo by the time The Cleveland Show launched, things had changed a little. He had divorced Loretta, and then he moved away to live with his new family in the small town of Stoolbend (how amusing!), meaning that he would no longer appear regularly in Family Guy. By this point he had married his old High School sweetheart Donna, and he still had Cleveland Jr (although he didn’t seem to be the original Cleveland Jr, and he now looked a lot like Peter).\n\nThere were also Donna’s children from a previous marriage, the teenage daughter Roberta, and the son Rallo, who was about five-years-old but had something of an attitude. Cleveland also makes a new group of friends, including Terry, Lester, and Holt, and for some reason his next-door neighbours are a family of talking bears. We also meet Cleveland’s parents for the first time, the joke seeming to be that he looks more like his mother than his father.\n\nEpisodes featured things such as Cleveland at work in his new job at a cable installation company, and what the children got up to at school. Cleveland would also meet lots of people including the rapper Kenny West. The Cleveland Show was first shown in this country on E4, and then it moved to ITV2 when Family Guy and American Dad did, where is it still repeated rather frequently in a late-night slot.\n\nThere were four series of The Cleveland Show, and when it came to an end after 88 episodes in 2013, Cleveland had little option but to move back with his family to Quahog, which led to several in-jokes about his show flopping by comparison to the long-running original, and you can imagine how well he took that. Rather frustratingly, only the first two series have been released on DVD, but they do contain lots of extras including deleted scenes. I would definitely buy the other two if they were ever released.\n\nKing Of The Hill (Fox, 1997-2010)\n\nHere’s yet another cartoon that was aimed at older viewers. In the mid-90s, another animated show that caused a stir was Beavis And Butt-Head (and I plan to review that one soon too), which was created by Mike Judge, who also voiced the main characters. After this was a success, it led to the just about a spin-off series Daria which was very enjoyable, and Judge then went on to create another much-acclaimed show.\n\nKing Of The Hill was set in Texas and featured Hank Hill and his family. Hank (voiced by Judge) had some steady work as an assistant manager of a propane company, something that he was very proud of. “I have a narrow urethra” was his popular catchphrase. There is also his wife Peggy who is a substitute teacher, and they have one child, their 12-year-old son Bobby, who is rather “husky” (to use the show’s phrasing).\n\nWe also meet a few other family members, including Hank’s dad Cotton who fought in the war, and Peggy’s rather short-tempered niece Luanne, who often argues with Hank. They also have a rather grumpy dog called Ladybird. Among the other regular characters were Hank’s boss Buck Strickland and his neighbour Kahn, and we also meet his circle of friends.\n\nThese include Dale who always wore a hat, he is rather into his conspiracy theories, and he has a son who almost certainly isn’t his, Bill who used to be an army Sergeant and is divorced, and most memorably there is Boomhauer who constantly mumbles and they all find his views interesting even though they never know what he is talking about. The four of them often stand together and have a beer whilst pondering the ins and outs of life.\n\nPlenty of things were covered that were rather amusing, as Hank tries to understand life in America in the late-90s. Memorable moments included Peggy’s attempts to play Boggle, Luanne’s puppet show The Manger Babies, Bobby causing trouble at school, Hank wanting to watch the Superbowl on TV, Boomhauer dating Luanne, and much more. Unsurprisingly, the show quickly began to win plenty of awards, and several celebrities including Country singers provided the voices of guest characters.\n\nThere would be a memorable quote from the episode played again over the production credit. What is also noticeable about the show is the animation style, where the characters looked much more like actual people than most other cartoons around at the time, there were no yellow heads or big eyes here. It was another one that was a long-running success, and Hank also made an appearance in the other animated Fox shows The Simpsons and Family Guy.\n\nAs for scheduling, I think that King Of The Hill was shown on Sky One, and then it was shown on Channel 4 on Friday evenings along with plenty of hype. But then it was moved further and further into a late-night slot. 1am, 2am, even 3am sometimes. I know that they have to show something at that time, but it was a waste and rather disappointing seeing the show slowly fall out of favour as the years went by.\n\nThere were 13 series of King Of The Hill that had over 250 episodes, and they have all been released on DVD. They contain plenty of extras including deleted scenes. I’m fairly sure that some of the series I have were won in a competition in the local newspaper. They were always very enjoyable to watch and definitely one of the highlights of the late-90s animated sitcom boom."
