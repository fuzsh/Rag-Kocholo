        "text": "Things You Should Have Done is a hilarious, offbeat, dysfunctional family-sitcom from the unique comedy mind of Lucia Keskin. Self-confessed stay-at-home-daughter, Chi (Lucia), is suddenly forced to fend for herself when her parents die. Chi will inherit the house on condition she completes a list of 'Things You Should Have Doneâ left by her parents (everything from âPet a dogâ to âGet a jobâ). Meanwhile Chiâs highly strung Auntie Karen (Selin Hizli) wants nothing to do with her dependent pest of a niece, but very much wants the house she feels is rightfully hers! In each episode, Chi tackles something from the list and is unleashed on the locals of Ramsgate, who bring something new to Chiâs understanding of life but leave wishing theyâd never met her.\n\nThings You Should Have Done airs on Thursday 29 February on BBC Three and all episodes will be available on iPlayer.\n\nLW\n\nLucia Keskin (Chi)\n\nTell us about your new series and what audiences can expect from the show?\n\nItâs a mental show about a girl who has to try and cope with life now her parents are dead and canât do everything for her, she desperately leans on the family she has left and sort of forces her way into peopleâs lives.\n\nHow would you best describe your character Chi?\n\nShe definitely seeâs the best in everyone, no one can ever really offend or annoy her. Mainly because sheâs unintentionally annoying others.\n\nHow much of the series is based on your real life experiences?\n\nIâd like to say itâs nothing like my real life, but of course there are some elements that are similar, for example I also have zero GCSEâs like Chi in the show! But itâs 98% fictional.\n\nWhat inspired you to write the show?\n\nTwo years ago I lost my Grandad who was my best friend and like a father to me. He got me into my love of comedy in the first place. It was the first time Iâd ever properly experienced grieving and how awful it really is. Humour was sort of the only thing that helped me through it, so when I met with Steve Monger (Exec Producer) I said that I wanted to write something that touched on grief and the surreal side of it.\n\nTell us about the writing process?\n\nIt was hard! Steve basically taught me everything in terms of the process and breaking everything down. I thought you just picked up a pen and wrote a whole show but turns out itâs a lot better when you plan it first! Thank God for Steve.\n\nTell us why you chose to base the show in Ramsgate? Why was that important to you?\n\nI grew up in Thanet so it just seemed right to do it there.\n\nWhatâs been your favourite part of the process?\n\nHonestly just learning so much at every stage. I think getting to work with such a great team has been the best. Roughcut have done so much for me and Iâm very grateful for the support they give.\n\nDo you have any favourite memories from filming?\n\nItâs so hard to pick a favourite but I think a definite favourite was when me and Jamie Bisping (Lucas) were filming a scene for episode 4 where we were watching the bananas and waiting for them to go ripe; we started improvising and could not get through it without making each other laugh.\n\nYou have some great talent involved, when you wrote it did you have the casting in mind?\n\nItâs so weird I did have cast in mind that I was so sure on and then things change, you see other people for roles and it ended up completely different to how I had imagined it in my head but in the best way, they are all really great.\n\nHow was filming with your fellow cast mates? Have you worked with any of them before?\n\nIâd not worked with any of them before but it was a dream working with such talented and funny people. I think Iâve definitely made friends for life (they better have said the same!)\n\nSelin Hizli (Karen)\n\nWhat were your first impressions of the script?\n\nI loved how the script was so real and relatable but also had these surreal heightened moments in it too. It was so refreshing to get a completely different perspective on how this family, who have had this sudden tragedy happen to them, navigate life and each other. I think grief and humour tread a very fine line next to each other and I felt that the script captured that really well.\n\nTell us about your character Karen.\n\nIn many ways Karen very much does live up to her name! Sheâs definitely not someone who you would want to be stuck on the other end of a customer service line withâ¦ But really, she feels stuck in a bit of a rut and has a bad habit of blaming other people for that - mainly Chi. Deep down sheâs struggling a bit and throughout the series I think she comes to realise that itâs ok not to be completely perfect all the time.\n\nDo you have any similarities to your character?\n\nI probably have a few more similarities than Iâd like to admitâ¦but I definitely can relate to Karen feeling like she has to be everything all at once. She feels this pressure to achieve all of these milestones in life and have everything under control, and she canât always see that the people in her life just want the best for her.\n\nWere there any funny moments from filming?\n\nPractically every scene I had with Dan (Fearn, who plays her on-screen husband Dave) had me in bits. Heâs so naturally funny and plays Dave so brilliantly that it was so difficult to be angry with him (which Karen is most of the time) so I would inevitably just get the giggles.\n\nWhatâs your most memorable scene?\n\nThereâs one scene towards the end of the series where I think we get to see who Karen really is and what sheâs actually been going through. I wonât say too much about what happens, but itâs a scene where sheâs on her own at Chiâs house and she finally allows herself to be vulnerable and itâs one that has definitely stayed with me.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your on screen relationship with Chi?\n\nKaren and Chi are way more similar than I think sheâd like to admit. Chi is a constant thorn in Karenâs side but, actually Chi is exactly the kind of presence Karen needs in her life. Working with Chi, I was always so impressed with how much sheâs achieved at such a young age and how she handled it all. She was always so supportive of all the actors and was so excited for us to bring our own thoughts and ideas to the amazing characters sheâd created.\n\nHow does the show compare to anything else you have starred in?\n\nThis show was such a unique experience for me. We had a really great rehearsal period where we were all encouraged to improvise a lot and have fun with our characters, which you donât always get. That carried on through to the filming process too, so each scene was exciting to film as you had that freedom to play around with different ideas.\n\nJamie Bisping (Lucas)\n\nWhat were your first impressions of the script?\n\nI immediately knew that Chi was deranged but talented. The script felt heightened but in an understated way. That is to say, the characters are bizarre but well observed enough to feel like actual people. I was fizzing when I read the script because I had such a clear idea of who Lucas was and how he sounded - but, to be fair, I might have totally missed the mark and no one had the heart to tell me.\n\nTell us about your character Lucas.\n\nLucas is a concerningly immature 20-something whoâs probably never left Kent. To be fair, I donât think he knows thereâs life outside of Kent. Heâs Chiâs step-cousin, and is very sweet and ultimately well-meaning but doesnât really know how an adult human is meant to behave in the world. His inability to read a room keeps him afloat because if he actually processed the things people say about him heâd be so depressed.\n\nDo you have any similarities to your character?\n\nNot particularly. I mean, I obviously want this to be true seeing as Lucas is a special breed of unintelligent and pathetic, and I say that with all the love in the world. Iâm more of a sceptic; Lucas embraces most people, even if he doesnât understand them - in fact, probably because he literally doesnât understand them. Where we are most similar is our mutual wanting to be involved. Neither of us are ever really alone, we go along for the ride for one reason (fun) or another (the anecdote).\n\nWere there any funny moments from filming?\n\nIt was an incredibly serious environment. Imagine the set of âSophieâs Choiceâ - I can only imagine it was similar. No, there were many funny moments - almost too many. I corpsed a lot. Dan, Selin, SinÃ©ad, everyone is so funny. So as to not ruin the take when laughing, sometimes I would drop down out of shot so it could maybe still be used. The main issue was Chi. Both because sheâs incredibly funny as the character but also, in some masochistic way, she would try and make us laugh. She would pull stupid faces off-camera at deeply inappropriate moments but, then again, sheâd also do this whilst the cameras were on her. She was pulling out my leg hairs in one shot. It was genuinely quite stressful sometimes.\n\nWhatâs your most memorable scene?\n\nEvery time we visited Solicitor Adamâs (Sunil Patel) office. Lucas and Chi are at their worst when they outnumber the person they are with, a sort of mob mentality takes over. Maybe because they communicate in a way that only they understand or because they refuse to really listen to anyone, but the sort of nonsensical interactions we would have with Adam were always perfectly awkward. They are so convinced he is the stupid one whilst saying things that are just totally incoherent.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your on screen relationship with Chi?\n\nNot much as itâs a secret. But Iâd say itâs similar to our off-screen relationship: tactile but platonic.\n\nHow does the show compare to anything else you have starred in?\n\nIâd be clutching to find something else Iâve âstarredâ in. Could you call performing as a Sammy (the generously named cashier) in one scene of âDreamlandâ a starring role? Lily Allen used the scene as promo on her Instagram, which made many acquaintances think I was the co-lead of the show. I was not quick to correct anyone. Itâs nice to know that random people from my primary school think Iâm more successful than I am.\n\nThere was similar camaraderie on the show âRivalsâ I shot last year but that was a much bigger machine. Similarly, I had small roles on a couple of Amazon fantasy shows, which were worlds away from this. Those were filmed on big studios and I had long hair. In this, we filmed in local buildings that may or may not have asbestos and my hair was short. Do you see the difference?\n\nI donât think I quite realized how much freedom we had to improvise on this. Not that her script needed any amendments, but our amazing director Jack and Chi would encourage us to go off-piste in case we found something new, which would more often than not result in Jack begging us to return to the scripted dialogue.\n\nDaniel Fearn (Dave)\n\nWhat were your first impressions of the script?\n\nI was completely blown away by the script. I read the first scene to prepare for the audition and was so hooked I read the whole episode. I thought the characters were so clear and grounded in reality yet they had an almost cartoon-like quality to them. I must have read the episode about three times over the weekend.\n\nTell us about your character Dave.\n\nDave is a fantastic character. One of the most hilarious characters I have ever played. He's Karen's partner and Dad to Lucas. I think he would like to be Chi's Dad too and probably thinks he is after her parents pass away. Dave loves conspiracy theories and always has an answer for a solution, it would probably be the worst solution in the world but his heart is in the right place. He knows that Karen is uptight but wants to make things better for her.\n\nDo you have any similarities to your character?\n\nI didn't think I did until halfway through filming. Every morning my friends and I like to send each other funny videos on Instagram but I became increasingly aware that a lot of the videos I was sharing were conspiracy ones: aliens, pyramids etc. I searched a lot of conspiracy theories on Instagram during prep for the audition and now I've completely ruined my algorithm..\n\nWere there any funny moments from filming?\n\nThere were so many funny moments during filming. I'd like to share a moment when we were filming at the campsite. Sinead (who plays Michelle) and I were shooting a scene where our characters are reminiscing about when they were in a relationship. Sinead thought it would be a good idea for Michelle to try and rekindle that magic and jump on my lap and kiss me. The only problem was the chairs we had were those awful flimsy plastic garden chairs which were about 30 years old and left out in the rain. As soon as she leapt on though the chair collapsed but in the most graceful way ever lowering both of us onto the ground like a concertina. It was embarrassing but so hilarious, I couldn't stop laughing.\n\nWhatâs your most memorable scene?\n\nThere are quite a few, to be honest. The doctor scenes I did with Ed (McArthur) were really funny and I love the scene I did with Jamie when Dave tells Lucas about his cancer scare. I think my most memorable scene though which came completely left field was the one I did with Selin in Ramsgate town centre. Whilst we were getting ready for the scene we were trying to think of funny things to do but Jack (the director) said that this scene was actually quite poignant and to just play the truth in it. What we ended up with was a beautiful scene about two people in a relationship beginning to listen to each other again.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your on-screen relationships with Lucas and Karen?\n\nLucas is Dave's son and I think it's fair to say that the apple hasn't fallen too far from the tree. Lucas wears his heart on his sleeve but when it comes to family he's a bit more switched on to what a loving, supporting family should be. The pair of them encourage each other no matter how ludicrous the plan is. They bumble through life together regardless of what is thrown at them but at least they do it together.\n\nDave is in a relationship with Karen and the best way I can describe it is opposites attract and that's putting it kindly. I think that the relationship broke down long ago but Dave will always support Karen, I think the pair of them are completely flawed but they need each other.\n\nHow does the show compare to anything else you have starred in?\n\nI would say that the fun atmosphere on this job was like nothing else I have ever experienced. I'm not sure if it was down to the location but it felt like I was on holiday.\n\nI think the level of detail in the acting reminded me of when I shot two series of Peaky Blinders. With that show, we were constantly reminded about the world our characters inhabited and with this show, Chi's world is almost as terrifying ha! It's funny though because I've recently realised that comedy and drama aren't such different beasts."
