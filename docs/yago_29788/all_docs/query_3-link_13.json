        "text": "Family breakdowns can happen to anyone and even some of your favourite celebs have experienced problems with those closest to them.\n\nIn a recent episode of The Surgery with Gemma and Dr Radha we discussed family breakdowns, from problems with your parents, to what to do if you find yourself without a home.\n\nHere are just a few who have spoken out about troubled relationships with their parents.\n\nAriel Winter\n\n(Warning: third party content may contain adverts)\n\nModern Family star Ariel Winter was 17 when she officially became emancipated from her mum in 2015, however her real-life family dramas go back years. Her older sister Shanelle legally became her guardian in 2012, after child protective services found evidence of emotional abuse towards Ariel by her mother, Chrisoula Workman.\n\n“I am now officially emancipated!!!” the actress tweeted. “I'm really lucky I have an amazing support system and lovely people in my life who have given me the support and guidance to have been given this wonderful opportunity.\n\n“Most importantly I want to thank @shanelle_gray and my father for their special support regarding this matter, I really couldn't have done it without them. Thank you to all of my family, friends, and fans who have supported me through all of my endeavors in life, and have encouraged me. Thank you for making my life so special! I can't wait to embark on my new adventures.”\n\nAdele\n\nAdele is struggling with bugs in Australia\n\nShe has been harassed by mosquitos and bats on stage during her world tour.\n\nIf you watched Adele collect the Grammy for Record of the Year in February, you might have noticed a dig at her dad – Marc Evans – in her acceptance speech. “Thank you to my manager because the comeback, as it were, was completely masterminded by him,” the Hello singer began. “And you executed it incredibly, and I owe you everything. We’ve been together for 10 years, and I love you like you’re my dad.\n\n“I love you so, so much. I don’t love my dad, that’s the thing. That doesn’t mean a lot. I love you like I would love my dad.”\n\nFans of Adele will know that she’s been estranged from Marc for years, after he left her and her mum when she was just three years old, due to his personal battle with alcoholism. He has publicly claimed several times that the pair have reconciled, but by the sounds of Adele’s speech, there’s no love lost here.\n\nKate Hudson\n\nYou’d be forgiven for thinking Kate’s dad is Kurt Russell (pictured above), the long-term love of her mum Goldie Hawn, but her biological father is actually American musician Bill Hudson. Largely absent from Kate and her brother Oliver’s lives, after splitting from Goldie in 1980, Bill spoke to The Mail on Sunday in 2015 after Oliver wished his sister a “happy abandonment day” via Instagram on Father’s Day.\n\n“I say to them now, ‘I set you free,’” said Bill. “I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognise Oliver and Kate as my own.\n\n“I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name. They are no longer a part of my life. Oliver’s Instagram post was a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack. He is dead to me now. As is Kate. I am mourning their loss even though they are still walking this earth.”\n\nDespite Bill’s harsh words, Kate told Howard Stern in 2016, \"I think forgiveness in any aspect is something that is complex. It is the greatest tool to be able to separate that attachment. So for me, I recognise whatever those issues are is something he has to live with. That must be painful for him and I forgive him.\"\n\nEminem\n\nEminem. Zane Lowe. Part 1\n\nEminem. Zane Lowe. Part 1\n\nEminem’s dad left the family when he was just a baby. In an interview with Rolling Stone, his mum Debbie said that the rapper tried writing to his father as a teenager, but all the letters came back labelled “return to sender”.\n\nAs for his relationship with his mum, it’s been pretty well-documented over the years, with Debbie suing her son for $10million back in 1999 due to potentially slanderous comments he made about her in his interviews. At the time, Eminem’s lawyer told MTV News, \"Eminem's life is reflected in his music. Everything he said can be verified as true - the truth is an absolute defence to a claim of defamation.”\n\nDebbie later settled the lawsuit for $25,000 and in 2014 Eminem released the song Headlights, an apology to his mum for insulting her publicly and through his music over the years.\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nDrew was just 14 when she became emancipated from her parents. In her 2015 memoir, Wildflower, the actress wrote, “It’s no secret that I had to part ways from my mother because we had driven our relationship into the ground. She had lost credibility as a mother by taking me to Studio 54 (so wrong, but so fun) instead of school. And I was out of control due to working since I was 11 months old and what that had done to my childhood, which made me grow up too fast.”\n\nWhile Drew and Jaid still don’t have much contact, she does support her mother financially. “I must know that she is taken care of or I simply cannot function,” explains Drew in Wildflower. “I am grateful to this woman for bringing me into this world, and it would crush me to know she was in need anywhere.”\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nHighlights of Demi Lovato's set at Radio 1's Teen Awards 2015\n\nHer father passed away from cancer in 2013, but before that Demi and Patrick Lovato had a strained relationship, with the pop star admitting, \"I was very conflicted when he passed, because he was abusive.\n\n\"He was mean, but he wanted to be a good person. And he wanted to have his family, and when my mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, ‘I’m so glad that [he's] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do.'\"\n\nDemi has since launched the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program, in Patrick’s honour, to help individuals struggling with addiction and mental health issues.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nAngelina opens up on her break-up with Brad\n\nAngelina Jolie talks about her break-up with Brad Pitt.\n\nJon Voight, Angelina’s dad, left their family when she was less than a year old, so their relationship has been somewhat rocky over the years. He famously claimed Angie has “serious mental problems” in a 2002 interview with Access Hollywood, with the actress then issuing a statement about him.\n\n\"I don't want to make public the reasons for my bad relationship with my father. I will only say that like every child, Jamie and I would have loved to have had a warm and loving relationship with our dad. After all these years, I have determined that it is not healthy for me to be around my father, especially now that I am responsible for my own child.\"\n\nAngelina and Jon didn’t speak until 2007, when her mother passed away from cancer, but are now thought to be on relatively good terms and have attended several premieres together over the years.\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nLiLo’s relationship with her parents has been complicated, to say the least, with her and her mother Dina getting into a physical altercation in 2012 that resulted in police being called. At the time, her father – Michael Lohan, who has been divorced from Dina since 2007 – told The Huffington Post, “Dina is crazy and out of her mind. Both Dina and Lindsay need help.”\n\nMichael is no stranger to drama himself, with a well-publicised battle with alcoholism and several stints in prison under his belt. Lindsay temporarily cut him off, tweeting in 2009, “Its so sad that I even have to share this w/everyone, but I haven’t had a real relationship w/Michael Sr. in years. That is the truth.”\n\nHowever, in her 2014 docu-series, the actress said, “There’s so much love in all of my family members… It really will be nice when that day comes when there’s… only positive things being said. And that will come.”\n\nMacaulay Culkin"
