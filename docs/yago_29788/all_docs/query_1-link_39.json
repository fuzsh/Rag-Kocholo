        "text": "By Lynn Venhaus\n\nA mod, madcap rock musical, “Little Shop of Horrors” is a perfect palate cleanser after two serious prestige productions this season. The Muny merrily delivers this bright bouquet of quirky black comedy to ride out an inevitable midsummer St. Louis heat wave.\n\nA pleasant evening of escapist entertainment, the campy cult classic shows why it is an enduring ‘little engine that could’ – a zippy two-hour musical that puts the bop in doo wop and delights with kooky characters while glossing over what is potentially icky with a lightness of being.\n\nIt is, after all, a horror comedy – and one loosely based on a cheesy 1960 movie meant to be a goofy cautionary tale about the atomic age. Designed to satirize science fiction, B-movies, the Faustian bargain and even musical comedy, the appeal of “Little Shop of Horrors” has now reached multiple generations.\n\nPerhaps a maniacal plant that feeds on human flesh and blood doesn’t sound appealing, but in its fourth presentation and the first one since 2011, the Muny’s creative team knows how to get it just right, winning us over with the show’s lively tempo and unpretentious yet irreverent attitude.\n\nMaybe when you discover Audrey II, the freakish carnivorous plant picked up by botanically curious Seymour in Chinatown during a solar eclipse, is a dastardly schemer from outer space that takes over Seymour’s life, it’s more palatable.\n\n“Two-eys” hearty appetite for destruction is the catalyst for Seymour blooming where he’s planted — providing him with a taste of fame and opportunities, the allure of celebrity leading to a possible livin’ large lifestyle that he’s been longing for – a dare to dream scenario.\n\nAnd let’s talk about that spectacular centerpiece of the show – the Venus flytrap-like plant that grows to epic proportions is a doozy, a marvel of engineering and innovation designed by James Ortiz. (I was fortunate to see this puppet designer’s remarkable work in the recent Broadway revival of “Into the Woods,” and this guy’s got game.)\n\nHis neon green one-of-a-kind otherworldly monstrosity was created just for the Muny run. Four puppeteers impressively guide this mean green machine, with astonishing mobility credited to Travis Patton as “Audrey II Manipulation.” Just watching Patton move with Swiss-watch precision is fascinating, and he deservedly takes a bow during the curtain call.\n\nThe bloodthirsty, pushy character is voiced by Nicholas Ward with devilish charm. His “Feed Me (Git It)” is saucy, and his “Suppertime” is unsettling, those robust pipes a delight to hear – even if Audrey II’s endgame is world domination. Of course Ward played Mufasa in “The Lion King” on Broadway. You may recall his impressive vocal performance as Caiaphas in “Jesus Christ Superstar” here in 2017.\n\nThe fact that this intimate show feels comfortably at home on the Muny stage is a major achievement, for striking the right tone between playful and offbeat with fear and murder is not easy to do given the source material, and its unconventional backstory. It’s far more complicated than it appears, and this small cast and crew make it appear effortless.\n\nWhat first became a low-budget Roger Corman horror B-movie in 1960, featuring an unknown Jack Nicholson as a masochistic dental patient (cut out of stage version) and written by Charles Griffith, was turned into an off-Broadway musical sensation penned by none other than those cheeky composing pals Howard Ashman (book and lyrics) and Alan Menken (music) in 1982.\n\nTurned into a movie musical in 1986, the stage version finally made it to Broadway in 2003. It was revived off-Broadway in 2019, with the top-shelf cast of Jonathan Groff, Tammy Blanchard and Christian Borle.\n\nNow household names, the late Ashman and Menken’s star rose with their Disney collaborations – “The Little Mermaid,” “Beauty and the Beast “and “Aladdin.” After Ashman’s death in 1991, Menken wrote music with other lyricists to maintain a Hall of Fame career – “Newsies,” “Pocahontas,” “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” and “Hercules” among a long list that has earned 8 Academy Awards, 11 Grammy Awards and 1 Tony (4 nominations).\n\nMenken, unintentionally, is being showcased this season with three productions – “the kids’ show” “Beauty and the Beast” and closer “Sister Act,” displaying his range.\n\nThis Ashman-Menken score shows their compatibility, sense of humor, understanding of music history, and the ability to change styles fluidly. (For a deeper dive into their beginnings, “Howard” is a terrific documentary available streaming on Disney+).\n\nDirector Maggie Burrows keeps the pace crisp and snappy, as she did in “On Your Feet!” and last year’s “Legally Blonde,” and so does her collaborator, choreographer William Carlos Angulo. Along with music director Andrew Graham, they added the oomph to Ashman-Menken’s genial numbers. Orchestrations are by Robert Merkin and vocal arrangements by Robert Billig.\n\nThe high-spirited ensemble frolics with glee. The two leads are polished pros with strong voices – three-time Tony nominee Robin De Jesus and reliable Muny favorite Patti Murin are smoothly in sync as florist shop co-workers, genuine in song and performance. They sing from the heart in the romantic ballad “Suddenly, Seymour,” and have a good time with “Closed for Renovation” and “Call Back in the Morning.”\n\nWorking hard as the sweet and lovable dork Seymour, De Jesus draws us in to the poor orphan’s tough life on Skid Row, but the dead-end hasn’t hardened him to hope, even though he appears hapless. He’s craving change, noticeably so in “Grow for Me.”\n\nUndeterred, he won’t stop trying to win over Audrey, the love of his life who feels unworthy of anyone’s affection. Without a shred of self-esteem, she is the victim of an awful, abusive boyfriend, which is the other ‘horror’ (after all, the title is plural). She delivers a heartrending “Somewhere That’s Green.”\n\nDe Jesus’s humanity as conflicted Seymour comes through. And that’s usually a component evident in all his performances. He was last seen here as the title character in the pre-Broadway tryout of “Aladdin” in 2012. The original Sonny in “In the Heights,” for which he was Tony-nominated, he also scored a nomination as housekeeper Jacob in “La Cage Aux Folles” and Emory in “The Boys in the Band” stage play revival. He reprised his role in the 2021 Netflix movie.\n\nI first noticed him in the underrated indie gem, “Camp,” from 2003, as one of the young misfits at a performing arts summer camp. In 2021, he played opposite Andrew Garfield as Michael in the Lin-Manuel Miranda directed “tick, tick…Boom.”\n\nMurin is an affable Audrey, just as she has engaged here as Paulette in last year’s “Legally Blonde,” as Ariel in “The Little Mermaid” and Roxie in “Chicago,” both in 2011. She originated the role of Princess Anna in Disney’s “Frozen” on Broadway.\n\nTony winner Michael McGrath gives shop owner Mr. Mushnik an edge, for he treats Seymour shabbily but does have comical lines. A longtime Muny performer, he won a Tony for “Nice Work If You Can Get It,” and was nominated for “Spamalot.”\n\nThe ensemble sparkles, especially Taylor Marie Daniel, Kennedy Holmes and Stephanie Gomerez as the Urchins girl group, an R&B trio honoring the Brill Building/early Motown songwriters with the names Chiffon, Crystal, and Ronnette.\n\nThey bring the pizzazz as the Greek chorus, harmonious and spunky in the Prologue, “Skid Row (Downtown),” “Da Doo,” “Don’t It Go to Show Ya Never Know,” and “Dentist!”\n\nThe meaty roles in supporting parts are one of the show’s selling points. Ryan Vasquez kills it as the sadistic dentist Orin Scrivello. He’s absurdly exaggerated in this plum part, especially in “Now (It’s Just the Gas).”\n\nAnd he’s very funny as gaudily dressed assorted characters in the second act, showing a good-sport sense of humor in his Muny debut — and quite a range for an actor who played Alexander Hamilton and various founding fathers in “Hamilton” on Broadway.\n\nThe costumes are sensational, an integral part of the atmosphere. Costume Designer Leon Dobkowski created blasts from the past with the Urchins’ flashy fashions, and bosom-enhancing skin-tight outfits worn by Audrey that look like they were purchased from Frederick’s of Hollywood.\n\nHe also selected suitable nebbish attire worn by Seymour and Mushnik, and Kelly Jordan’s wig design also aided the retro look. Dobkowski won two St. Louis Theater Circle Awards for “Seussical” and “The Wiz,” and he has such a fun-loving eye.\n\nThe scenic design by Kristen Robinson is a striking grungy streetscape of an area that has seen better days, and an effectively shrewd interior of Mushnik’s Flower Shop, which includes subtle changes as the business prospers, and well-chosen pieces reflecting the economic fortunes. She tells the story well depicting those touches.\n\nGreg Emetaz’s video design is seamless, deftly enhancing the set design and story progression with strong visuals.\n\nThis is a swiftly paced musical with a zest for fantasy, yet grounded in a dark side that is still amusing after all these years.\n\nThe Muny presents “Little Shop of Horrors” July 25-31 at 8:15 p.m. on the outdoor stage in Forest Park.

With a fresh batch of pixie dust, the Muny’s second episode of its smash hit Summer Variety Hour Live more than met expectations after such a sensational series launch July 20.\n\nIf you were curious as to how they could top the inaugural show, now that we know the formula, one look at the lineup beforehand answered that quickly. Tony nominee Taylor Louderman singing live under the Culver Pavilion! Tony nominee and fan favorite Rob McClure, versatile veteran of six Muny shows, singing “Suddenly Seymour” with his wife Maggie Lakis, who has been in two Muny musicals, from their home in Philadelphia. McClure’s Muny debut was “Little Shop of Horrors” in 2011, so that was fitting. The cast of 2017’s spectacular “The Little Mermaid,” lead by Commodore Primous III as Sebastian, reuniting to sing a buoyant “Under the Sea.” I mean, the deck was stacked.\n\nThe best way to describe the ebb and flow of the carefully curated selection of acts is to compare it to a multi-course gourmet dinner especially crafted to include favorite dishes, comfort food, bold choices and unique taste treats, every bite bursting with flavor.\n\nWhen the “Wow” factors were unveiled — those unforgettable Muny moments that you will always recall with awe, so grateful to have experienced it in person – they blew me away. It isn’t hard to pick five, ten or 20 out of your head if you are a regular. (We probably share some of the same ones – we’ll have to compare notes).\n\nAnd this supersonic flash came from two performers I saw in ensembles but did not know their names: Nkeki Obi-Melekwe and Chloe O. Davis. I will never forget them now.\n\nNkeki soared singing “If You Knew My Story” from “Bright Star” during her time, a selection to reinforce color-blind casting. Nkeki, a Michigan graduate, appeared in the Muny’s 2017 “All Shook Up” and went on to play Tina Turner in “Tina the Musical” in London’s West End in April 2019, then move to Broadway in October.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with “Bright Star,” the musical by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, it came out the same year “Hamilton” did and lost the Tony Award for Best Musical to the landmark show in 2016.\n\nChloe O. Davis, a dancer who grew up in St. Louis and was in “All Shook Up” and “The Wiz” in recent years, was featured in “My Tribute to Black Broadway and Black Choreography: I Thrive Now Because You Dared Then,” a dance she conceived and choreographed.\n\nAs she used Forest Park as her stage, she gave us a history lesson that stirred “all the feels.” She created the styles of famous black choreographers, using audio and visual clips in addition to her dance moves – East St. Louis’ international icon Katherine Dunham, George Faison, Debbie Allen, Hope Clarke, Gregory Hines, Donald Byrd, Bill T. Jones and Camille A. Brown among them.\n\nMoving. Powerful. Elegant. Truly a shining moment.\n\nA delightful song-and-dance interlude was courtesy of three dynamos Maya Bowles, Trevor Michael Schmidt and Gabi Stapula, whose high-spirited “There’s Gotta Be Something Better Than This” from “Sweet Charity” captured our anxiety and their eagerness to get back to the business of entertaining. These chorus gypsies reminded us how ensemble cohesiveness is so important to any big splashy musical.\n\nGabi also works with the Muny Teens, and their fun-loving mashup of “Bring On the Monsters” from “The Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical” and “Drive It Like You Stole It” from “Sing Street” again showcased how talented some local students are – and their sunny dispositions. I’m a big fan of the 2016 movie “Sing Street,” which is writer-director John Carney’s third film about the transforming power of music (“Once” and “Begin Again”), and its stage adaptation was set to open on Broadway in April after rave reviews off-Broadway.\n\nThe power ‘hour’ also featured behind-the-scenes stories about what’s happening at The Muny, including being able to pull off the stunning fireworks at the Centennial Gala, and the amusing game show throwback Munywood Squares. With interesting fun facts, hosted by Gordon Greenberg and featuring nine Muny performers in the Zoom grid, including E. Faye Butler, J. Harrison Ghee, Ann Harada, Raymond J. Lee, Vicki Lewis, Steve Rosen, Jeffrey Schecter, John Scherer and Christopher Sieber. This week’s good sport contestants were photographer Phillip Hamer and Muny company manager Sue Greenberg. Fun remembering the raccoon who waddled on to the stage in “The Addams Family” in 2014!\n\nOn an intermittent rainy night, star Taylor Louderman was accompanied by four socially distanced musicians, to sing live the power ballad “Astonishing” from “Little Women.” Always nice to include a female empowerment song, this one from Louisa May Alcott’s timeless and timely heroine, Jo March. From Bourbon, Mo., 60 miles southwest of St. Louis, Taylor went from Muny Teen to Tony nominee as Regina George in “Mean Girls.” She made her Broadway debut in 2012’s “Bring It On!,” has been in seven Muny shows and won the St. Louis Theater Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical for last summer’s “Kinky Boots.” (And this year, finished her bachelor’s degree that she had started at Michigan in 2009 and was married five weeks ago to Brooks Toth).\n\nThe archival footage of past summer shows is a fond trip down memory lane, starting with Muny titans Beth Leavel and Ben Davis in 2015’s “Oklahoma!” Leavel, Tony winner for “The Drowsy Chaperone” and nominee for ‘The Prom,” is a frequent St. Louis Theater Circle Award nominee, winning for her Mamma Rose in 2018 “Gypsy.” Davis, seen last year as Sky Masterson in “Guys and Dolls,” has been nominated multiple times, and once joked during an interview that he is the ‘Susan Lucci’ of the Circle Awards.\n\nDavis was in the now legendary production of “Spamalot” in 2013 as Sir Galahad. Host Mike Isaacson introduced “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,” which holds the distinction of being the most popular song at funerals, pointing out how weather affected the show. I remember that on opening night June 17, a steady rain was falling after torrential downpours for days preceding it. So, there was little opportunity to rehearse outdoors. The audience for the show opener of the 95th season was so eager to see this Muny premiere that we came in droves with our umbrellas — and were mightily rewarded.\n\nIt’s a night I’ll never forget. During the curtain call, actor John O’Hurley, playing King Arthur, stopped the show to introduce Monty Python founder and show creator Eric Idle! Whoops, cheers and thunderous applause! Everyone on their feet. I turned to my companion and said: “We are in the presence of a Python!” Oh, be still my heart. It was pure bliss – he led us in “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” after mentioning this was the largest audience to ever see the musical and he wanted to see if we could get in the Guinness Book of World Records for our sing-a-long.\n\nOh, what a night! I had the good fortune to interview John O’Hurley later that fall when he was touring as Billy Flynn in “Chicago,” and we had a pleasant conversation about that enchanted evening.\n\nAnother splendid memory was shared with the incredible “We’re in the Money” from the extraordinary 2016 production of “42nd Street,” choreographed by Denis Jones, St. Louis Theater Circle Award winner. That curtain call – go see it on YouTube – as the cast cascaded down a staircase will go down as my favorite (next to “A Chorus Line”) in Muny history.\n\nAll these elements are what make summer nights special at the Muny, and spotlighting the world-class talent – from the musical theater majors from the best schools in the country to the stars with Broadway credentials — who come together in Forest Park – is one I like to emphasize. Years ago, seasons were headlined by ‘names’ – mostly from TV – and while recognizable, I much prefer having the best talent possible give us their all on that stage. Drama geek that I am, I read all the bios and notice who returns to the Muny, who creates magic on the stage, or is given the part of a lifetime.\n\nAnd in that spirit, the Summer Variety Hour Live emphasizes how many parts make each show happen.\n\nAnd it is a warm, familiar embrace at a time we all need a hug.\n\nOn July 20, The Muny 2020 Summer Variety Hour Live! drew more than 30,000 viewers from across the U.S. and around the world. This total sets a new, record-breaking first in The Muny’s live-streaming history.\n\nOn July 27, we were connected by the calypso beat of newly crowned EGOT winner Alan Menken, the banjo picking of brilliant Steve Martin, the Britpop synthesizer of ‘80s New Wave, the zaniness of silly comic geniuses, homages to Busby Berkeley and Broadway chestnuts, the triumph of a ‘local’ small-town girl with a dream, sweetness, sincerity, showmances and people who think sitting under those stars in St. Louis is like coming home.\n\nThese shows (5 total, 3 left) are exclusive, one-time-only streams and will not be available after the Thursday night airing. The July 30 re-airing will include audio description and captions. The link is: youtube.com/themunytv\n\nThe Muny’s online 2020 season is sponsored by World Wide Technology. Episode 1 was made possible by US Bank and Episode 2 by Edward Jones. They announce the next lineup every Wednesday.\n\nLynn (Zipfel) Venhaus has had a continuous byline in St. Louis metro region publications since 1978.

The play wades fearlessly into the\n\ncomplexities of life in America. It is set among Black and Jewish populations\n\nin an imagined time and place, simultaneously Shakespearean and post- Civil War\n\nWashington, D.C.\n\nDirected by Jacqueline Thompson\n\nCast: Gary Wayne Barker, J. Samuel Davis, Courtney Bailey\n\nParker, Alicen Moser, Erika Flowers, Karl Hawkins, Ron White, Rae Davis\n\nOf Note: In Aaron Posner’s re-imagining, the play becomes\n\nless about the quality of mercy and more about how flexible a supposedly\n\negalitarian society can be to the varied tribes struggling to find partners in\n\nAmerica. Aaron Posner expertly blends humor, emotional truths and topics that\n\nmake people think. He is able to create characters who are deeply flawed, like\n\nwe are. In his “uneasy” comedy, he wants us to look at a snapshot in time, the\n\nReconstruction Era, but what he has written is relevant to audiences today.\n\nTrish Nelke, John Emery, Laura Deveney and Becky Loughridge.
