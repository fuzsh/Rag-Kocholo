The talented cast sharing the marquee with Cedric for the five-season run included:  popular comedic actress Niecy Nash (portraying \"Lolli\" his wife), veteran actor John Beasley (portraying \"Barton Ballentine\" his cantankerous father), and versatile young actor Wesley Jonathan (portraying his carefree younger brother \"Stamps\")...the hit show also boasted great special guest star appearances along the way (from Martin Lawrence to Cee Lo Green to Robert Forster to Al Jarreau to Missi Pyle to Sherri Shepherd & many many more).Marking an exciting and memorable career highlight in television, on March 20, 2013, Cedric was named host of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" joining the iconic game show in it's 12th season in national syndication in its weekday version.

In 2009, he made his directorial debut overseeing the dance-film spoof “Dance Fu,” starring comic actor Kel Mitchell.In 2011 Cedric launched his WHOCed designer hat line, highlighting yet another facet of the busy and creative comedy star.As a philanthropist, Cedric founded The Cedric The Entertainer Charitable Foundation, which provides scholarships and outreach programs to enhance the lives of inner-city youth and their families in his hometown of St. Louis, Missouri.  The foundation has awarded hundreds of scholarships and countless incentives, and plans to extend its reach to a national level.

Hughley, Eddie Griffin, and the late Charlie Murphy -- for \"THE COMEDY GET DOWN TOUR\"! They have been selling out arenas for the past 3 years now.ABOUT THE \"COMEDY GET DOWN TOUR\" -- ?The original endeavor was mounted for a special concert event which took place in Oct 2014 in Peoria, Illinois to raise funds towards building a statue of legendary comedian RICHARD PRYOR in his hometown of Peoria. That mission was accomplished!! AND, the comedian friends had so much fun that they decided to continue performing together...Thus, giving rise to the current tour.",
