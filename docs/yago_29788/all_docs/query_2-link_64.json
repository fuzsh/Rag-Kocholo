        "text": "There are holiday movies and TV episodes that truly capture the beauty and spirit of the holidays, but that is not what the following is about. Right now, it’s time to celebrate the families that feel a bit more real because of how they get on one another’s nerves as soon as the holidays roll around. Yup, these are the best holiday movies and episodes about dysfunctional families.\n\n1 of 20\n\n“White Trash Christmas,” 'Roseanne'\n\nThe Carsey-Werner Company\n\nThe Conners are best known for their Halloween episodes, but they really outdid themselves in \"White Trash Christmas\" when their signature Conner \"charm\" made their neighbors' lives miserable due to their holiday decor.\n\n2 of 20\n\n'Almost Christmas'\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nAlmost Christmas reminds everyone who grew up in a home where the fighting started within seconds of arriving for the holidays.\n\n3 of 20\n\n“Hal's Christmas Gift,” 'Malcolm in the Middle'\n\nFox Television Studios\n\nMalcolm in the Middle spawned many hilarious episodes over several seasons, but there is a special place in fans' hearts for the homemade gift debacle of \"Hal's Christmas Gift.”\n\n4 of 20\n\n'Home Alone'\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nThe McCallister family may have all the money in the world to have destination holidays, but from the bickering before the flights to the fact that they managed to leave a child behind, they’re the definition of dysfunctional.\n\n5 of 20\n\n“You Better Watch Out,” 'Married… with Children'\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nThe Bundys helped usher in a whole new type of family in the late ‘80s. They were far from the wholesome Tanners on Full House — so much so that even their holiday episodes were rude and crude, including the one when a mall Santa winds up in their backyard.\n\n6 of 20\n\n'Elf'\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nBuddy had to face reality and come to terms with reconnecting with a family he never knew he had.\n\n7 of 20\n\n“A Very Sunny Christmas,” 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia'\n\nFXX\n\nWatching It's Always Sunny do its own twisted version of A Christmas Carol is a holiday tradition many should start.\n\n8 of 20\n\n'The Santa Clause'\n\nWalt Disney Picture\n\nNot this holiday classic starting with a distant dad taking out Santa Claus…\n\n9 of 20\n\n“Secret Santa,” ‘The Office’\n\nNBC\n\nWork families are just as important as biological ones, and they’re just as crazy. Case in point: every single Christmas episode of The Office.\n\n10 of 20\n\n'Four Christmases'\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nTraveling to four different locations because both of your parents are divorced and the idea of one locale for the holidays just can’t be done. Sounds exhausting — and like the plot of this Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn movie.\n\n11 of 20\n\n“Afternoon Delight,” 'Arrested Development'\n\nFox Broadcasting Company\n\nWill Arnett is a gem as the insufferable Gob during this episode, where he winds up firing everyone at the Christmas party.\n\n12 of 20\n\n'Jack Frost'\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThe dad is a snowman. Does nobody have an issue with this?\n\n13 of 20\n\n“Interlude II,” 'The Righteous Gemstones'\n\nHBO Entertainment\n\nWhile this episode doesn't quite highlight the insanity of this evangelical family, it does give fans a nice flashback during the holiday season, as well as an appearance by everyone's favorite uncle, Baby Billy!\n\n14 of 20\n\n'Why Him?'\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\nIf there is anything more awkward than one's family meeting their new partner over the holidays, we don't want to know about it.\n\n15 of 20\n\n“The Christmas Tree,” 'The Middle'\n\nWarner Bros. Television\n\nFiguring out how to spend time together, an allergic reaction, and the dreaded wrapping paper sales. This episode has everything one doesn’t want during the holidays, which makes it that much better.\n\n16 of 20\n\n'Daddy's Home 2'\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nNothing beats grandparents who can’t stand one another, right?\n\n17 of 20\n\n“Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo,” ‘South Park’\n\nParamount+\n\nThe Grinch, Santa, Rudolph, and because of South Park, a piece of poo is forever ingrained into the fabric of the holiday season.\n\n18 of 20\n\n'The Ref'\n\nTouchstone Pictures\n\nOne has to wonder who was worse off: the Wet Bandits in Home Alone, who got physically tortured, or Gus in The Ref, a man who got mentally tortured after taking a family (who needed therapy) hostage.\n\n19 of 20\n\n“Christmas Through Your Eyes,” ‘The Vampire Diaries’\n\nWarner Bros. Television\n\nThere is nothing functional about a bunch of werewolves and vampires with a lot of animosity.\n\n20 of 20\n\n'Christmas Vacation’\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nNothing ever seems to go that right when the Griswolds are involved, especially Christmas.\n\nKendra Beltran is a pop culture obsessed writer who spent her youth tirelessly jotting down ‘Total Request Live’ data after school. She took that obsession and a useless college degree, and spun it into enough to pay her rent by writing for MTV Geek, Collider, Popverse, and more. Over the years her interest in pop culture has only grown, and today she finds herself baking while streaming ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race,’ running (slowly) while listening to podcasts about the ‘90s, and hanging out with her dog while taking in emo playlists. Kendra also hosts a podcast dedicated to all the crushes people have had in life from Disney to real-life called Crushgasm."
