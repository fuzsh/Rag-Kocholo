        "text": "One of my favorite comedians is coming to Evansville early next year, and we have your chance to see him for free!\n\nFor over 30 years, Brian Regan has been entertaining crowds around the world with his offbeat, goofy style of stand-up. I remember first seeing him in the early days of Comedy Central when the majority of their programming was different shows that showcased comedians. He was a regular on shows like Stand-Up, Stand-Up, The A-List, Premium Blend, and Comedy Central Presents, delivering hilarious sets each time with his unique, often animated, take on things we all have encountered at one time or another. For example, listening to someone tell a boring story from his most recent Netflix special, Brian Regan: On the Rocks.\n\nThat's just a little taste of what you can expect when Brian brings his tour to the Victory Theater in downtown Evansville on Sunday, March 27th, 2022. Tickets for the show go on sale this Friday (November 12th, 2021) at 10:00 AM at the Ford Center box office between Noon and 5:00 PM on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, or online through Ticketmaster.\n\nHowever, don't break out that credit or debit card just yet, because you may be able to score a pair of tickets for free from us. Check out the Q Crew Morning Show with myself and Leslie all this week between 6:00 and 10:00 AM for your chance to win when we give out the cue to call. Be caller nine at 877-437-5995 and you'll be on your way to the show!\n\nHere are a few more clips from Brian's most recent Neflix special, Brian Regan: On the Rocks to get you by until we get to see him in person in late-March."
