Each televised show was edited together from two performances in front of a live audience.\n\nThe show turned Burnett into a television superstar.\n\nAt the time, few knew Burnett’s personal story. Both her parents were alcoholics. When they divorced, Burnett was sent to live with her grandmother in a studio apartment in a poor part of Hollywood.\n\nBurnett translated her dysfunctional past into comedy gold on television.\n\n“The meticulously structured, musical-comedy program became one of the last, and one of the finest prime-time variety shows to link the modern television age with Tin Pan Alley and the Golden Ages of motion pictures and television,” the Museum of Broadcast Communications said about Burnett’s show.\n\n“The show brought Carol Burnett’s working-class persona into a unique relationship with her audience.”\n\nIn September 2008, Burnett visited The Orpheum where a sold-out audience saw a performance that included the funniest clips from the TV show. Most of it featured Burnett in an unscripted Q&A with fans — a longer version of what preceded her TV show.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“The crowd adored her, she said she loved being here, and for once you didn’t question the homilies of a visiting star: She seems utterly genuine,” Dykk said about Burnett’s show. “She looked great too and wore a smart red suit.”\n\nCostumes and outfits were always a stand-out part of the show thanks to the great Bob Mackie, the fashion designer who made thousands of outfits during the 11 seasons.\n\nPerhaps the most famous was for the skit Went with the Wind!, a parody of Gone with the Wind. Burnett played Starlett O’Hara (aka Scarlett) who descends a staircase in a dress made out of drapes with curtain rods for shoulder pads and a valance for a hat. The dress is on display at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nAnother notable character was Nora Desmond, a former silent movie star assisted by Max, the loyal but controlling butler played by Korman. It was a parody of Sunset Boulevard, a movie starring Desmond as a former film star who lives in a fantasy world about making a comeback.\n\nThere were also numerous occasions when performers broke out of character. One of the biggest culprits was Tim Conway, who regularly ad-libbed lines to make Korman laugh. Even when he didn’t succeed, the contorted expressions on Korman’s face created genuine, unscripted moments that fans could connect with.\n\nOne of many distinctive elements in the show came at its end. After the song I’m So Glad We Had This Time Together, Burnett would tug at her left ear which was a secret message of love to her grandmother who had raised her. Even after her grandma’s death, Burnett kept tugging at her ear to end the show.\n\nkevingriffin@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
