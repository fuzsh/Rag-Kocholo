        "text": "Day 1 ‚Äì The best movie you saw during the last year\n\nThe Social Network\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt my favorite film of the last year (it was #4) but definitely the best one. It had a terrific script, was well cast, and an amazing director. I went into expecting an okay film about Facebook, but it was a lot more complex than that. It was a way better film than I expected which might be why I enjoyed it so much. Plus it had Justin Timberlake which just makes the 12-year-old girl in me go giddy!\n\nDay 2-The most underrated movie\n\nEulogy\n\nI absolutely love this film and it doesn‚Äôt always get the credit it‚Äôs due. It brings together an absurdly talented cast including: Zooey Dechanel, Hank Azaria, Famke Janssen, Kelly Preston, Rip Torn, Ray Romano, Jesse Bradford, and Debra Winger. It‚Äôs a dark comedy that manages to be both hilarious and heartwarming. And is one of the more original scripts out there. Critics panned it (it has a 32% on rotten tomatoes), but I don‚Äôt care. Maybe they just came from families that weren‚Äôt full of crazies and couldn‚Äôt relate to the dysfunctional Collins family.\n\nday 3-A movie that makes you really happy\n\nMamma Mia\n\nI know this film has its problems, like James Bond‚Äòs singing, but it‚Äôs a lot of fun. Abba songs are light and bouncy and make me want to sing and dance. My sister and I saw this eight times in the theater. EIGHT TIMES! In the end I didn‚Äôt care the the three male leads couldn‚Äôt carry a tune in a bucket (except SOS, that‚Äôs painful) or that there‚Äôs an unaccounted for 10 year gap. It still makes me really happy.\n\nday 4-A movie that makes you sad\n\nAtonement\n\nI walked out of Atonement feeling like someone had punched me in the stomach. It‚Äôs not often that a movie effects me that much. It has one of the best bad endings I‚Äôve ever seen. If you haven‚Äôt seen it I won‚Äôt spoil it for you. And I‚Äôm not a big romantic either, but this love story really hit me.\n\nday 5 ‚Äì Favorite love story in a film\n\nAway We Go\n\nI don‚Äôt know if this really qualifies as a ‚Äúlove story‚Äù but it is one of my favorite relationships in a movie. Burt and Verona (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) are in a committed, loving relationship and about to have a baby. When Burt‚Äôs parents announce that they‚Äôre moving to Europe, they realize that they can leave too. They begin a cross-country road trip to find the perfect place to raise their family. It‚Äôs sweet, funny, touching, and features a really good cast.\n\nday 6 ‚Äì Favorite made for TV movie\n\nA Diva‚Äôs Christmas Carol\n\nI went back and forth between this one the ‚ÄúThe 60‚Äôs.‚Äù In the end the Diva won out because I love Christmas movies, I love unique retelling‚Äôs on Dickens‚Äô ‚ÄúA Christmas Carol,‚Äù and it‚Äôs full of pop culture references. Vanessa Williams is Ebony Scrooge. TLC‚Äôs ‚ÄúChilli‚Äù is here ex-singing partner Marli Jacob. Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are (respectively) Kathy Griffin, Duran Duran bassist John Taylor, and a VH1 ‚ÄúBehind the Music‚Äù special. It‚Äôs good, campy fun.\n\nday 7 ‚Äì The most surprising plot twist or ending\n\nFight Club\n\nThere are a lot of movies with good plot twists, ‚ÄúEmpire Strikes Back,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Usual Suspects,‚Äù ‚ÄúPsycho,‚Äù any M. Night Shyamalan movie, but ‚ÄúFight Club‚Äù wins because I had no idea it was coming. I was completely taken by surprise when *SPOILER ALERT* Brad Pitt tells Edward Norton that he is Norton‚Äôs imaginary friend. WTF?!? Plus it leads to one of my favorite movie quotes ever, ‚ÄúWHOA! WHOA! WHOA! Ok, you are now firing a gun at your ‚Äòimaginary friend‚Äô near 400 GALLONS OF NITROGLYCERINE!‚Äù\n\nday 8-A movie you‚Äôve seen countless times\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nTo be honest, I avoided this movie for a long time because of the title. I was expecting a sappy, romantic, chick flick. How wrong can a person be? I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!! I can quote it backwards, forwards, and sideways. In high school, my ‚Äúwords of wisdom‚Äù to future classes, was ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get involved in a land war in Asia.‚Äù Anytime a facebook message trend pops up with just ‚ÄúPrincess Bride‚Äù quotes I have to join in, whether I know the person or not. To not enjoy this film would be inconceivable!!!\n\nI‚Äôd post a clip of my favorite scene here, but it‚Äôs too hard to decide. You‚Äôll just have to watch the entire film. Sorry üòõ\n\nday 9-A movie with the best soundtrack\n\nElizabethtown\n\nI really like listening to soundtracks. I‚Äôm a fan of a lot of different genres and soundtracks are good because you get a lot of different types of music in one space. Plus, it gets the added bonus of reminding you of the movie. There are a lot of good soundtracks out there but ‚ÄúElizabethtown‚Äù is my favorite. There is not one skippable track on it. (Both volumes now that I think about it.) Cameron Crowe knows music (more to come on ‚ÄúAlmost Famous‚Äú). Here we get Tom Petty, Elton John, Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin, and so much more. I totally love it. It‚Äôs a fantastic movie too!\n\nday 10-Favorite classic\n\nCat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nI know I just wrote about this one but it‚Äôs not my fault Elizabeth Taylor died. Anyway, this film adaptation of one of Tennessee Williams‚Äò plays is one of my favorite films. It stars Paul Newman as an ex-football player who‚Äôs bitter and depressed and ignores the affections of his loving sex kitten wife (Taylor). It‚Äôs Newman at his best and Taylor at her sexiest. I love family dramas, especially when it‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs family. If you‚Äôve never seen it, go, NOW!\n\nday 11-A movie that changed your opinion about something\n\nEmpire Records\n\nI wish I could think of something more profound than this. Oh well, I choose ‚ÄúEmpire Records‚Äù because it helped me realize that I could love a film with Ren√©e Zellweger in it. I haven‚Äôt found another one yet. ‚ÄúEmpire Records‚Äù is one of those movies that I can‚Äôt not watch if it‚Äôs on TV. It‚Äôs a movie about friendship, loyalty, and finding that one place where you fit. The place where you can be you without judgement.\n\nday 12-A movie you hate\n\nEraserhead\n\nThere are not enough words to explain my hatred for this movie. Just writing this makes me angry that I wasted 85 min. of my life on this. UGH!!! In fact, I can‚Äôt stand any of David Lynch‚Äòs films. They drive me absolutely nuts. People say that I just don‚Äôt understand them, that I don‚Äôt get it. Well, I do understand them. What I don‚Äôt get is how so many people adore Lynch and worship at his feet. I shake my fist in anger at you Lynch. And the Lady in the Radiator.\n\nday 13-A movie that is a guilty pleasure\n\nTwilight\n\nYes, I am a little embarrassed to be posting this for the entire blogging world to see but oh well. I can‚Äôt help it, I love these movies and how incredibly bad they are. I know that real vampires don‚Äôt sparkle but how can you deny lines like, ‚ÄúHold on tight spider monkey.‚Äù It‚Äôs like a car accident, I can‚Äôt not watch.\n\nday 14-A movie that no one would expect you to like\n\nThe Notebook\n\nSo I‚Äôm not the biggest romantic in the world, but I adore ‚ÄúThe Notebook.‚Äù To be honest, every other Nicolas Sparks book/ movie/ anything makes me want to claw my own eyes out. (Especially ‚ÄúA Walk to Remember‚Äú) Maybe it‚Äôs because of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Maybe it‚Äôs because of James Garner. I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs the sappiest chic click that I can tolerate.\n\nday 15-A movie that you relate to most\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nNo, no one has ever been paid to date me (that I know of). And no, no one has sacrificed themselves on the alter of dignity by singing to me over the PA system. But I knew this high school and these characters. I worshiped Kat (Julia Stiles) and her take-no-bullshit-from-no-one attitude. She knew that there was life after high school and it didn‚Äôt matter who you went to prom with or what clique you identified yourself with after graduation.\n\nDay 16-A movie you used to love but now hate\n\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective\n\nWhen ‚ÄúAce Ventura‚Äù first came out I thought it was hilarious. I was 8, what the hell did I know. It was on tv a couple days ago and couldn‚Äôt sit through 5 min. It was awful! We could throw ‚ÄúDumb and Dumber‚Äù into this category too. In fact, most of Jim Carrey in the 90‚Äôs kinda makes me cringe now. I‚Äôm very glad we‚Äôve moved on.\n\nDAY 17: A MOVIE THAT DISAPPOINTED YOU THE MOST\n\nDue Date\n\nZach Galifianakis, decent. Todd Phillips, pretty good. Buddy road trip movie, awesome. Robert Downey Jr., frickin‚Äô badass. Something went terribly, terribly wrong in this movie and it saddened me. üò¶ I was really, REALLY looking forward to this movie. (I look forward to anything RDJ) This movie was clearly a blatent attempt to cash-in on ‚ÄúThe Hangover‚Äòs‚Äù success. Which I‚Äôm pretty sure ‚ÄúThe Hangover 2‚Äù will do also.\n\nday 18 ‚Äì A movie you wish more people would see\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. The World\n\nWHY DIDN‚ÄôT PEOPLE GO SEE THIS?!?!?! I am in Lesbians with this movie. And I‚Äôm not even a gamer. But seriously people this movie was awesome. It had fighting with cool graphics and effects, witty dialog rife with pop culture references, psychic vegans, and demon hipster chicks. Plus a love story.\n\nday 19 ‚Äì Favorite movie based on a book/comic\n\nHarry Potter (any of them)\n\nThe third book was my favorite, but I think maybe the fourth movie. I don‚Äôt know, the first part of the seventh movie was pretty great too. Then again, the first movie was, well, the first so there‚Äôs something to be said for that. Whatever. I counted down the days until Amazon would deliver the books on my doorstep so I could lock myself in my room for a couple of days. And while I am eagerly anticipating the 2nd part to the seventh, and final, movie I‚Äôm also a little sad.\n\nday 20 ‚Äì Favorite movie from your favorite actor\n\nHome for the Holidays\n\nRobert Downey Jr.!!! What more is there really to say? He‚Äôs made a lot of fantastic movies but ‚ÄúHome for the Holidays‚Äù is probably my favorite. It‚Äôs kinda quirky, and kinda heartwarming, and he‚Äôs really funny in it. Plus, it‚Äôs a rare Thanksgiving movies. I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of the films I like center on family dynamics and the relationships between everyone when they are reunited.\n\nday 21 ‚Äì Favorite movie from your favorite actress\n\n28 Days\n\nThis one was harder. I had my favorite actress narrowed down to Sandra Bullock and Rachel McAdams. In the end Sandy won out because looking at her filmography I realized how many of her movies I love. ‚ÄúWhile You Were Sleeping,‚Äù ‚ÄúPractical Magic,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Time to Kill,‚Äù ‚ÄúMiss Congeniality,‚Äù ‚ÄúBlind Side,‚Äù the list goes. Even ‚ÄúDemolition Man‚Äù has it‚Äôs moments. ‚Äú28 Days‚Äù won for today‚Äôs spotlight for one very important reason ‚Ä¶ Steve Buscemi.\n\nday 22-Favorite action movie\n\nDie Hard\n\nJohn McLean. Hans Gruber. Terrorists. Explosions. Guns. Swearing. And Christmas. Die Hard is the epitome of action. There‚Äôs really nothing else to say about it. It‚Äôs the best. I really don‚Äôt feel the need to defend it anymore.\n\nday 23-Favorite Documentary\n\nHelvetica\n\nI don‚Äôt watch many documentaries but I do have a few different favorites. ‚ÄúMy Architect‚Äù and ‚ÄúZ-Boys and Dogtown‚Äù I both highly recommend. In the end, ‚ÄúHelvetica‚Äù wins because at my core I am a huge font nerd. I see a sign and I try and guess what font it‚Äôs written in. Nothing makes me happier than downloading a new font. And a good even-weight, proportionally-spaced sans serif sends me into a tizzy.\n\nday 24-Favorite animation\n\nMulan\n\nToday was hard. I love animated movies and there are a lot of good ones to choose from. Especially now that there is more than one studio pumping out animated hits. The stories are getting better, the animation is getting better, the genre is just getting better. I had to go with a Disney movie though because I‚Äôm a HUGE Disney kid. I can‚Äôt help it, it‚Äôs what I grew up on. I‚Äôve always loved Mulan. It was great songs, Eddie Murphy is hilarious, and I liked the story. I still say she‚Äôs not a Disney princess.\n\nday 25-Favorite comedy\n\nForgetting Sarah Marshall\n\nJason Segel and Mila Kunis and Russell Brand and Paul Rudd all on Oahu. This movie was a lot funnier than I thought is was going to be and I still laugh hysterically every time I watch it. For a long time I thought nothing would top Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, but each Will Ferrell movie just seems to get crappier and crappier. Sarah Marshall was fresh and sweet and hilarious. I LOVE IT!\n\nday 26-A movie you love but everyone else hates\n\nPiranha 3D\n\nI can‚Äôt find one other person that will admit to seeing Piranha 3D let alone liking it. This is an epically BAD movie that I can‚Äôt get enough of. It‚Äôs vulgar, violent, and VERY awesome. It‚Äôs an exploitation film which means lots or blood and lots of T&A. It delivers both. The deaths in this movie are gruesome, but in a totally hilarious way. I laughed so hard when I saw this, a little bit of pee came out. And I have to mention the cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Christopher Lloyd, Jerry O‚ÄôConnell, Elisabeth Shue, and Ving Rhames. Oh, and I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything, but the last 30 seconds ‚Ä¶ TOTAL GENIUS.\n\nday 27-A movie you wished you‚Äôd seen in theaters\n\nScream\n\nI don‚Äôt know why, but horror movies are always scarier in the theater. The first time I watched Scream was at home, and I always wished I‚Äôd met Ghostface on the big screen. Scream is one of my favorite horror films becuase horror movies are cliches and it acknowledges that. It mixes the cliches with humor and real scares. The sequels have been decent too. I‚Äôve grown up on the Scream franchise and while I don‚Äôt condone the making of unneccesary sequels as long as they keep coming up with good stories and can keep the original cast coming back for more, so will I!\n\nday 28-Favorite movie by your favorite director\n\nThe Breakfast Club\n\nOh John Hughes, what would the 80‚Äôs have been like without you? All of Hughes movies were fun, heartwarming, relatable, and had a good message. I love them all but ‚ÄúThe Breakfast Club‚Äù is by far my favorite. I felt like I knew each of the characters. They‚Äôre all fully-developed, three-dimensional characters that go on a complete journey together.\n\nday 29-Favorite movie from your childhood\n\nFerngully: The Last Rainforest\n\nI don‚Äôt remember this being my favorite movie as a kid, but it was the first movie that came to mind so it wins. I liked this movie a lot, and watched it A LOT. The only thing I really remember is that Robin Williams was the bat and I felt really sad when the smoke guy was going to hurt the trees. I went back and looked at the cast list and that smoke guy is Tim Curry. Which makes sense because he was a really good evil voice. Plus, Cheech and Chong are in ‚ÄúFergully,‚Äù did you know that? I kinda want to rewatch this movie now.\n\nday 30-Favorite movie of all time\n\nAlmost Famous\n\nI have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. It has a terrific story, well written characters, and great music. I absolutely love everything about it!!! It‚Äôs funny, sweet, and heartwarming. It‚Äôs part comedy, part drama, part romance, and part road tip, all set to the soundtrack of the ‚Äô70‚Äôs. There‚Äôs not much else to say about it. Go see it, NOW!!!"
