        "text": "The Ewing family (Dallas)\n\nIf the 80s were characterized by TV shows featuring model families, like the Huxtables in The Cosby Show or the Tanners in Full House, they were also defined by family dynamics that were quite the opposite, as is the case with the Ewings from Dallas. Broadcast exactly on April 2nd, 1978 on CBS, this classic soap opera depicts the rivalry between two powerful families in Texas, the Ewings and the Barnes, and begins with the marriage between Bobby Ewing and Pamela Barnes. But Dallas also delves into the conflicts within the Ewing clan itself, where the cunning J.R. reveals himself capable of the worst low blows, making him one of the most iconic anti-heroes in TV history.\n\nThe Carrington family (Dynasty)\n\nWhether it's the iconic 80s series or the 2017 reboot, the show Dynasty is renowned for portraying one of the most dysfunctional families on television: the Carringtons. Led by ruthless businessman Blake, the series follows the ups and downs of his marriage with Krystle (in the original version) or Cristal (in the reboot), as well as his complicated relationships with his children, Fallon and Steven. Add to that the return of his ex-wife, the iconic and impressive Alexis, to his life, and you get an explosive soap opera!\n\nThe Roy family (Succession)\n\nBroadcast since 2018, the series Succession has introduced to viewers some of the most obnoxious yet fascinating characters on television in the past few years. We are talking, of course, about the Roy family, composed of patriarch Logan and his four children: Connor, Kendall, Roman, and Shiv. Even if they are very different from each other, they all are willing to do anything to succeed their father at the helm of the family's business.\n\nThe Lyon family (Empire)\n\nHalfway between a soap opera and a musical series, Empire portrays the colorful Lyon family and its members. At its head is the successful rapper and producer Lucious, along with his ex-wife, the flamboyant Cookie, who sacrificed herself for her family by spending 17 years in prison for drug trafficking. Together, they have three children, Andre, Jamal, and Hakeem, who are pitted against each other by Lucious, who is eager to find his successor after discovering he has an incurable disease. All bets are off, including the lowest of blows, between two recording sessions in the studioâ€¦\n\nThe Grayson family (Revenge)\n\nIn the sight of Amanda Clarke/Emily Thorne, heroine of the series Revenge, the Graysons appear to be the perfect family. However, the reality is quite different, as the episodes reveal extremely manipulative parents with numerous secrets. It becomes difficult for their children to find their place in this ruthless world, where revenge is the key word...\n\nThe Lannister family (Game of Thrones)\n\nAmong all the families in the iconic 2010s TV show Game of Thrones, the Lannisters are by far the most dysfunctional. And for good reason, a completely unhealthy atmosphere of schemes and incest reigns in this house. This has resulted in descendants such as the despicable Joffrey Baratheon, one of the most hated characters among fans, as well as shocking scenes that still haunt millions of viewers around the world."
