        "text": "Tracy McMillan has been a writer on some of the best television programs ever produced ranging from “Mad Men” to “United States of Tara.” She gets to use those skills on her own series as the executive producer and creator of the Hulu series “UnPrisoned.”\n\nWhat she has created is a multi-level family drama swirling around the very dysfunctional Alexander family. Paige’s (Kerry Washington) therapy practice is in trouble while her son’s (Faly Rakotohavana) anxiety is through the roof. The catalyst is her father, Edwin (Delroy Lindo) who is still figuring out how to get his life together outside of prison.\n\nThe second season of “Unprisoned” will launch July 17 on Hulu. That’s when the Alexanders turn to a “family radical healing coach,” who throws out all the rules to free them of the issues, old wounds and family secrets holding them back.\n\nWhile it is difficult to think of the drama without hearing the voices of Washington, Lindo or Rakotohavana, McMillan didn’t have them in mind when she was writing the first script.\n\n“What I heard was the characters saying their experience and their thoughts, their feelings. Their hopes, their dreams, their fears,” McMillan says. “It is interesting when you are writing because I feel like there is a certain amount of writing where you are just taking dictation.\n\n“That’s what happens in that process. You see it and you write it down.”\n\nThe process changes for McMillan once the actors are in place. She has always worked to have an interplay with the actors so once she hears them speaking her dialogue, she begins to take that into account. Then she writes to their voice.\n\nWhat McMillan has heard with Rakotohavana is an actor who has had to deal with a broad range of emotions. Before landing the role in “UnPrisoned,” he worked on comedies such as “The Mick” and programming aimed at a young audience with “Raven’s Home.”\n\nRakotohavana found the way to deal with the cosmic high and low emotions by counting on what he had learned as an actor in past work.\n\n“It is just a matter of reading the script over and over again,” Rakotohavana says. “Creating that history for yourself. Creating that context with yourself. And of course, creating that chemistry with Kerry and Delroy.”\n\nRakotohavana needed to be ready to play the role because the way McMillan has fashioned the scripts, almost all the emotional floods pass through his character. That could be disagreements with his mother or trying to connect with his grandfather who has become the new father figure in his life.\n\nBeing part of “UnPrisoned” has not only given Rakotohavana a complex role to portray but it also exposed him to a master class in acting by sharing scenes with Washington and Lindo. The young actor has always tried to learn something new in terms of being an actor with each job and “UnPrisoned” has been one of the most informative.\n\n“A lot of the time, I just sit back and watch. Just observing what they do,” Rakotohavana says. “Seeing how they work.”\n\nOne big observation he has made is that each time Washington and/or Lindo must do a scene more than once, each version is slightly different than the one before. They are able to make these changes because the actors are so committed to their characters and the scene.\n\nThe way Rakotohavana describes what he has seen is that his co-stars are “experiencing”” what is happening in the scene. They are not merely acting through the words written by McMillan.\n\nOne area of writing where McMillan has created a very different way of having her character speak has to do with the casting of 10-year-old Jordyn McIntosh to play Little Paige. Her role is the very young version of Washington’s character who shows up to verbally challenge herself.\n\nJust like Rakotohavana, Jordyn spends a lot of time studying how Washington works. In her case, that’s because she has to make her character feel like she is part of the flow when she pops in and out of scenes.\n\n“I see her emotions and then I copy and paste,” Jordyn says.\n\nBefore becoming the miniature version of Washington’s character, Jordyn’s acting credits included such productions as “The First Lady” and “Emancipation.” The Georgia native also is trying to learn as much as she can by watching her co-stars.\n\nShe describes being part of the “UnPrisoned” cast as having her own private acting school. No regular acting school would have prepared her for a part where she had to match another member of the cast from hair style to shoes.\n\nEpisodes of the first season of “UnPrisoned” currently are available on the streaming service Hulu.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.
