        "text": "She is an American teacher, author, artist, poet, playwright, novelist, filmmaker, composer, and journalist. She is perhaps most famous for her book The Artist's Way (1992). She also has written many other non-fiction works, short stories, and essays as well as novels, plays, musicals, and screenplays.\n\nJulia Cameron was born and raised in a Chicago suburb, and grew up Catholic. She started college at Georgetown University, then transferred to Fordham. She started her journalism career at the Washington Post, then moved on to Rolling Stone.\n\nShe met Martin Scorsese when interviewing him for Rolling Stone. They married in 1975 and divorced in 1977; Cameron was Scorsese's second wife. They have one daughter, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, born in 1976. Cameron and Scorsese collaborated on three films. Cameron's film, God's Will, is based on the Cameron-Scorsese marriage and divorce, portraying a divorced, self-centered show business couple who die unexpectedly and end up fighting in heaven over what will happen to their daughter.\n\nA review of Cameron's memoir Floor Sample states that Cameron \"reveals the dark side of her privileged life: her descent into alcoholic blackouts and drug-induced paranoia as well as descriptions of her bouts with psychosis.\" In 1978, reaching a point in her life when writing and drinking could no longer coexist, Cameron stopped the drugs and alcohol, and began teaching creative unblocking, which propelled her to fame after she published the book based on her teachings, The Artist's Way.She states creativity is an authentic spiritual path.\n\nCameron has taught filmmaking, creative unblocking, and writing. She has taught at The Smithsonian, Esalen, the Omega Institute, and the New York Open Center. At Northwestern University, she was writer in residence for film. In 2008 she taught a class at the New York Open Center, \"The Right to Write,\" named and modeled after one of her bestselling books, which reveals the importance of writing.\n\nCameron has lived in Los Angeles, Chicago, Taos, and Washington D.C., but now lives in New York City.\n\nBibliography -\n\nNonfiction:\n\n* The Artist's Way Every Day: A Year of Creative Living (Tarcher, 2009)\n\n* Prayers to the Great Creator: Prayers and Declarations for a Meaningful Life (Tarcher, 2008)\n\n* The Writing Diet: Write Yourself Right-Size (Tarcher, 2007; ISBN 1585425710 )\n\n* Floor Sample (Tarcher, 2006; ISBN 1-58542-494-3), a memoir\n\n* How to Avoid Making Art (2006; ISBN 1-58542-438-2), illustrated by Elizabeth Cameron\n\n* The Sound of Paper (Tarcher, 2004; Hardcover ISBN 1-58542-288-6)\n\n* Supplies: A Troubleshooting Guide for Creative Difficulties (Tarcher, 2003; Rev&Updtd edition ISBN 1-58542-212-6)\n\n* Walking in this World (Tarcher, 2003; Reprint edition ISBN 1-58542-261-4)\n\n* The Artist's Way, 10th Annv edition (Tarcher, 2002; ISBN 1-58542-146-4)\n\n* Inspirations: Meditations from The Artist's Way (Tarcher, 2001;ISBN 1-58542-102-2)\n\n* God is Dog Spelled Backwards (Tarcher, 2000; ISBN 158542062X)\n\n* God is No Laughing Matter (Tarcher, 2000; ISBN 1585420654}\n\n* Supplies: A Pilot's Manual for Creative Flight (2000)\n\n* The Artist's Date Book (Tarcher, 1999; ISBN 0874776538 ), illustrated by Elizabeth Cameron Evans\n\n* Money Drunk Money Sober (Ballantine Wellspring, 1999; ISBN 0345432657)\n\n* The Writing Life (Sounds True, 1999; ISBN 1564557251)\n\n* Transitions (Tarcher, 1999; ISBN 0-87477-995-2)\n\n* The Artist's Way at Work (Pan, 1998; ISBN 0330373196)\n\n* Blessings (Tarcher, 1998; ISBN 0-87477-906-5)\n\n* The Right to Write: An Invitation and Initiation into the Writing Life (Tarcher, 1998; ISBN 1-58542-009-3)\n\n* Heart Steps (Tarcher, 1997; ISBN 0-87477-899-9)\n\n* The Vein of Gold (1997; ISBN 0-87477-836-0)\n\n* The Artist's Way Morning Pages Journal (Tarcher, 1995; ISBN 0-87477-886-7)\n\n* The Money Drunk (1993)\n\n* The Artist's Way (1992)\n\nFiction:\n\n* Popcorn: Hollywood Stories (Really Great Books, 2000; ISBN 1-893329-12-7)\n\n* The Dark Room (Carroll & Graf Pub,1998; ISBN 0-7867-0564-7)\n\nMusicals:\n\n* Avalon\n\n* Magellan\n\n* The Medium at Large\n\nPlays:\n\n* Four Roses\n\n* Public Lives\n\n* The Animal in the Trees\n\nPoetry:\n\n* This Earth (Sounds True, 1997; ISBN 1564555496)\n\n* Prayers for the little ones (Renaissance Books, 1999; ISBN 1580630480)\n\n* Prayers to the nature spirits (Renaissance Books, 1999; ISBN 1580630472\n\n* The Quiet Animal\n\nFilm:\n\n* \"God's Will\""
