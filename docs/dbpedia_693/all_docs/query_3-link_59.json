        "text": "Narrator: Julia Margaret Cameron was born in 1815 in Kolkata, India.\n\nHer parents were very rich and she travelled the world with her family.\n\nAs an adult, Julia moved to England.\n\nFor years, she enjoyed all types of art and wrote poetry.\n\nWhen she was forty eight years old she was given a camera by her daughter.\n\nThis is where her journey into portrait photography began.\n\nJulia was often inspired by medieval legends and poetry, Bible stories and art from ancient Greek and Roman times.\n\nWhile other photographers were trying to make the perfect, bright, sharp focus photo, Julia would experiment, creating soft focus, dream-like effects.\n\nShe would even add scratches to the photo. This made them look more like portrait paintings than a photograph.\n\nShe experimented with different costumes, as well as lighting, and shadows. Julia Margaret Cameron took risks with her art and created a new style of portrait photography we still use today."
