        "text": "Ten juries, representing a broad cross-section of excellence in the various disciplines are appointed annually to judge the candidate pool. The juries convene from January through March, and finalists are selected for in-person or virtual interviews. The membership of juries changes each year. The winners are approved by the Academy’s Board of Trustees and announced in April.\n\nThe jurors’ primary criterion is excellence. They will consider the quality of an applicant’s submission and select candidates who are not only outstanding in their respective fields, but also at a point in their careers where the Rome Prize is likely to be crucial to their future growth and development.\n\n2024 Jury\n\nMario Erasmo\n\nProfessor and Department Head, Department of Classics, University of Georgia\n\nCaitlin Gillespie\n\nAssistant Professor and Helaine and Alvin Allen Chair in Literature, Department of Classical Studies, Brandeis University\n\nMaggie Popkin, 2021 Fellow\n\nRobson Junior Professor and Associate Professor of Art History, Department of Art History and Art, Case Western Reserve University\n\nRabun Taylor\n\nFloyd A.
