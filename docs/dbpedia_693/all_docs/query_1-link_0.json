The fourth of five children of Frederick C. and Mary MacLeod Trump, he was introduced to the world of real estate development at a young age through his father's company, Elizabeth Trump & Son. His early years were marked by a combination of rigorous education and hands-on business experience, which laid the foundation for his future endeavors. Trump's entrepreneurial journey began in earnest when he took control of his father's company in 1971, renaming it The Trump Organization. Over the decades, his ventures spanned a diverse range of industries, from real estate to hospitality, television production to beauty pageants. His knack for branding and marketing, coupled with an unyielding spirit, has seen him through periods of financial downturns and back to prosperity. Notable projects such as the transformation of the Commodore Hotel into the Grand Hyatt and the creation of Trump Tower in Manhattan have solidified his reputation as a formidable business magnate. In 2015, Trump took a decisive leap into the political arena, running as a Republican candidate for the Presidency of the United States. Despite having no prior political experience, his campaign, characterized by its populist rhetoric and media-savvy tactics, resonated with many, leading to his election as the 45th President of the United States in 2016. His tenure was marked by significant controversy and polarization, yet also by major policy shifts in areas such as immigration, tax reform, and foreign policy. Regardless of one's perspective, Donald Trump's impact on American society and its political landscape is undeniable.\n\nDenzel Washington, a name synonymous with dynamic performances and compelling storytelling, is widely recognized as one of the most prolific actors in Hollywood.
