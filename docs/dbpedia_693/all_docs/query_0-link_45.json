The clarity with which she expressed extremely complex concepts was unparalleled, and her assistance throughout the process of medical school application was invaluable. My experience with Advantage, through my tutor, has been nothing short of incredible and I wish every student on the planet had the opportunity to work with her.”\n\nAcademic Math Student\n\n“My experience with my tutor was extremely positive and beneficial to me as a math student. She helped me in 11th grade with pre calc AB, which was an extremely hard course at my school. She was able to explain things that my teacher was not able to get across to my understanding. She quickly learned the ways that taught me best and was able to teach me the course in that way. She and I made extensive review sheets together that were very helpful to my leraning this course.”\n\nACT Student\n\n“My tutor is a great tutor who is not only understanding but very motivational. Whenever he saw me struggle, he never called me out on it; he would instead offer assistance. He has taught me that I have the ability to push myself and that I am capable of more than I think.”"
