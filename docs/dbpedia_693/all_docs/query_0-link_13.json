        "text": "Biography\n\nJulia Cameron was born and raised in a Chicago suburb, and grew up Catholic. She started college at Georgetown University, then transferred to Fordham. She started her journalism career at the Washington Post, then moved on to Rolling Stone.\n\nShe met Martin Scorsese when interviewing him for Rolling Stone. They married in 1976 and divorced a year later in 1977; Cameron was Scorsese's second wife. They have one daughter, Domenica Cameron-Scorsese, born in 1976. Cameron and Scorsese collaborated on three films.\n\nCameron's memoir Floor Sample details her descent into alcoholism and drug addiction, which induced blackouts, paranoia and psychosis. In 1978, reaching a point in her life when writing and drinking could no longer coexist, Cameron stopped the drugs and alcohol, and began teaching creative unblocking, eventually publishing the book based on her work: The Artist's Way. She states creativity is an authentic spiritual path.\n\nCameron has taught filmmaking, creative unblocking, and writing. She has taught at The Smithsonian, Esalen, the Omega Institute for Holistic Studies, and the New York Open Center. At Northwestern University, she was writer in residence for film. In 2008 she taught a class at the New York Open Center, The Right to Write, named and modeled after one of her bestselling books, which reveals the importance of writing. She continues to teach regularly around the world."
