        "text": "Julia Cameron, hailed by the New York Times as “The Queen of Change,” is credited with starting a movement in 1992 that has brought creativity into the mainstream conversation—in the arts, in business, and in everyday life. She is the best-selling author of more than forty books, both fiction and nonfiction; a poet, songwriter, filmmaker; and playwright. Commonly referred to as “The Godmother” or “High Priestess” of creativity, her tools are based in practice, not theory, and she considers herself “the floor sample of her own toolkit.” Her book, The Artist’s Way, has been translated into forty languages and sold more than 5 million copies to date.\n\nLearn more about this presenter’s work:"
