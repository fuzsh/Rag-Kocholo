        "text": "About Julia\n\nJulia Cameron has had a remarkable career, which in turn has given remarkable help to others.\n\nJulia has published 30 books, highly praised short stories, award-winning essays and hard-hitting political journalism. Her credits range from Rolling Stone to The New York Times. A novelist, playwright, songwriter and poet, she has distinctive credits in theatre, film and television. She has taught everywhere from The Smithsonian to Esalen, The New York Times to the Omega Institute. She also served as writer in residence in film at Northwestern University.\n\nAs author of The Artist's Way, The Vein of Gold, and The Right to Write, her bestselling works on the creative process, Julia is credited with founding a movement that has enabled millions to realize their creative dreams. Julia eschews the title creativity expert, preferring instead to describe herself simply as an artist.\n\n\"Artists have always mentored,\" Julia says. \"I just do it on a wider scale.\""
