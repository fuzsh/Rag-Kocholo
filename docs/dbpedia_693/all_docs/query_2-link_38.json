        "text": "Juliet Yvonne Smith was born in Kingston, Jamaica on November 24, 1946 to the late Rupert Bartlett and Daphne Carlton.\n\nShe spent her childhood in Kingston until she moved to New York, NY when she was sixteen years old.\n\nAt the age of eighteen, Juliet met Raphael Flores on a school field trip to Carnegie Hall. They fell in love and married on July 16, 1966 in New York City. As the wife of an enlisted member of the armed services, the couple lived in Alaska and Colorado before returning to NYC where they welcomed the birth of their daughter, Monique Flores.\n\nAfter some time, the couple divorced and Juliet moved to Connecticut with Monique where she became a born again Christian. There she met Rev. Clifton G. Smith who she would marry on April 7, 1980 and the couple moved to Hollywood, Florida.\n\nClifton and Juliet would start a church together, Jesus Christ Free Church, and while doing so would give birth to their first son Mark Smith. Two years later, they welcomed their second son Michael Smith. Soon after, the family moved back to Connecticut and settled in Bridgeport, where their youngest daughter, Rayah Smith was born.\n\nOver the course of her 40-year career as a registered nurse, Juliet provided well for her family, working two jobs in one day at times.\n\nShe cared for patients as a volunteer missionary nurse in underdeveloped and developing regions of the Dominican Republic, administering vaccinations to adults and children, as well as educating individuals on ways to eliminate infection causing micro-organisms. She also served as an emergency volunteer nurse at Cornerstone Christian Church for several years.\n\nMost notably, Juliet served as a school nurse for the Department of Health in Bridgeport, Connecticut from 1990 until 2006, when she retired.\n\nJuliet loved the Lord! She was a devout Christian and ensured her children were raised in the church. She was also a firm believer in the power of education and instilled in her kids a strong work ethic, resourcefulness, grace and grit. The children attended Fairfield University, Fordham University, Hampton University, NYU, Southern CT State University and Yale University, all a testament to her diligent prayer life and steadfast commitment to her family.\n\nDuring her retirement, Juliet found great joy in helping to raise her grandchildren. Taking Cameron and picking him up from school or football practice was a common occurrence. She later commuted to Harlem on the Metro North daily to care for Matthew until he was two years old. She frequently pointed out that it was no trouble and enjoyed how her “senior citizen discounts” were coming in handy.\n\nJuliet was very health conscious and an incredible cook, who loved a great meal, especially Jamaican cuisine, and broke bread with friends and family on any occasion. She also loved to dance and was known for starting her own dance party anytime and anywhere. She will also be remembered as a special mother-figure to the many friends of her children and grandchildren.\n\nJuliet passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by her family, on Thursday September 21, 2023. She leaves behind a large close-knit family which include her five children: Monique Flores, Mark Smith and his wife Jaccara, Michael Smith and his partner Khalil Pipkin, Rayah Wright and her husband Jason Wright, step daughter Gitana Ng & her husband Deryck Ng; Nine grandchildren: Sean Salley, Madison Salley, Cameron Guytan, Matthew Smith, Luke Smith, Jabari Wright, Shana Zhu, Amber Ng and Derrick Ng, Jr. She is survived by her brother, Michael Bartlett, her sister, Carol Soto, and numerous friends who loved and cherished her; and preceded in death by her brother Lloyd (Sonny) Bartlett and stepdaughter Julette Julia Smith.\n\nShe always kept a Bible close by and attended New Vision International Ministries through her later years. Her fervent belief in her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ kept her through good times and bad, and she is now rejoicing in heaven.\n\nThe Memorial Service will be held on Thursday, September 28th between 11:00AM & 1PM in Bridgeport, CT at New Vision Church 35 Benham Ave, Bridgeport, CT 06605. Flowers to be sent to the church by 9am Thursday. Donations may be made to Smith Family Economic Empowerment Center at the Cardinal Shehan Center or to World Vision International Org."
