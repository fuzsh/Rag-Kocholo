I was very excited to receive this email. I’ve been looking for an Asian American Studies course to take every semester, but there was literally only one available (Asian Diasporic Literatures), but it had multiple prerequisites, making it less accessible for underclassmen to take. The other courses were either language or history courses, neither of which were directly related to the Asian American experience. Maybe it’s just me, but this is one of the ways I feel that my being Asian will prevent me from also being seen as an American — there’s always some degree of separation.\n\nI don’t expect Father McShane to fix racism in one email, but I also felt that the responsibility was being redirected toward students and faculty to fix. I understand that expecting an institution to change on its own is unrealistic, but I do hope that this petitions helps push the university to actually act on what they call us to do.RufusBurnett, Jr.FacultyAssistant Professor of TheologyThis would be an amazing step in centering underrepresented knowledges and histories.

As a mother of two half-asian children, I have seen firsthand how damaging it can be when history books and anthologies ignore your family’s culture of origin. As a dean, I have fielded countless inquiries from students interested in taking more classes on Asian history and culture, but stymied by the limited options. Our students deserve an academic home that will allow them to learn more about the multi-faceted history of Asians and Asian-Americans. If we want to continue to attract a diverse body of students, we will expand our course offerings and start an Asian-American studies program.AlessiaValfrediniFacultySenior LecturerMayaBentovimStudentGSB 2023DorothyBogenStudentFCRH 2024DominicChimientiStudentFordham GSS 2024SpurgeonThompsonFacultyInstructorVivianPappFacultyAdjunct Professor of EnglishJudyArteche-CarrFordham IT Exec Consultant; Asian American Business Dev CouncilN/ASophiaSinghStudentFCRH 2021KristinaJacobsFacultyInstructor of SpanishDavidHamlinFacultyProfessor of History and ChairKatherinaFostanoAdministratorVisual Resources CuratorTomBeaudoinFacultyProfessor of ReligionAlexandraFinn-AtkinsGraduate StudentPhD Candidate in English 2022Caitlin MeehyeBeachFacultyAssistant Professor of Art HistoryBlancaUrizarFacultySenior Lecturer Modern Languages and LiteraturesRosemaryWakemanFacultyProfessor HistoryNanaOsei-OpareFacultyProfessor of HistoryThis is a terrific idea and really boost the university’s image and academic profile in profound ways.MariaFarlandFacultyAssoc Prof EnglishThis is long overdue!DavidMyersFacultyProfessorMariaEisenhardtStudentFCRH 2021JackMosesStudentFCRH 2023SophiaDaoudStudentFCLC 2021MadisonSoeyadiStudentFCLC 2024N/ARebeccaHallStudentFCRH 2023MichelleMoughanStudentFCLC 2023MariaCrayStudent2022NicholasAbbazioStudentGSB 2021This is a great petition and we have waiting to long for something like this at Fordham.

It would be a great learning experience for all students, and I hope it is heavily considered.MadisonForbesStudentGSAS 2025WinnieKungFacultyprofessor of social workI think it’s a good idea to develop an Asian American Studies program at Fordham given the large Asian population in the city. Moreover, to really combat Asian hate crime, educating the public and members within the Fordham community on how to be an “upstander” instead of a bystander is so important to practically help reduce such violence. The whole idea of speaking up and taking actual action when we are faced with unjust and discriminatory situations is so relevant in any context where bullying or discrimination occurs.BaratEllmanFacultyAdjunct professor of TheologyBethanyFernandezStudentFCRH 2022SalAcostaFacultyProfessor of HistorySusanWabudaFacultyProfessor of HistoryJennaGoldblattStudentFCLC 2023LachlanWoolseyStudentGSB 2021OrlandoRodriguezFacultyProfessor of SociologyMariaMerkleStudentFCRH 2023HeatherDubrowFacultyJohn D.

I was consistently challenged by the lack of resources, professors, and mentors throughout my research and writing process; I found it difficult to accomplished the work I was seeking to do through Fordham’s offerings. BIPOC students are regularly undermined and roadblocked by the school administration’s reluctance to actually support anti-racist efforts and critical research – ethnic studies and other underserved departments, including Asian American Studies, needs to be an urgent priority, especially at a predominantly white institution like Fordham. Asian American stories, issues, and voices cannot and should not be a one week lesson on a syllabus; full, robust course offerings need to be an option as well.DylanGarveyStudentFCRH 2021CharleneMinayaStudentGSAS 2025MadelineKehoeStudentGSB 2022LutherSackeyfioStudentGSB 2023JayaJoyceStudentFCRH 2024TaniaTanStudentFCRH 2023AlaniScheelStudentFCRH 2023SydneyDragerStudentFCRH 2022JackieMutkoskiStudentFCRH 2023CaleyKnoxStudentFCRH 2024EllaNalbandyanStudentFCLC 2021Hiu YanOrStudentFCLC 2022DeborahLaymanStudentDoctoral Student ADPDianeLeeStudentStudent FCLC 2021JulieTrohanStudentGabelli LC 2024Thank you for doing this 🙂JustinCharlesStudentFCRH 2023NicholasLevytskyStudentFCRH 2024LeahFeuerstahlerFacultyAssistant ProfessorEmmaBuddAlumniFCRH 2020DanielAlonsoStudent2025WilliamBruceStudentGSBLC 2021JamieForbesStudent2023BrandonDullStudentFCRH 2021MargaritaMcCoyStudentFCRH 2023JulieDoonanStudentFUGB 2022I’m so surprised the school as large as this can I have an Irish studies department and not an Asian American studies department especially with the large amount of Asian students attending this campusEmmaCareyAlumniFCRH 2019AlanaCampbellStudentFCLC 2022SamihaHossainStudentFCLC 2022MaryMcCluskeyAlumniFCRH 2020IanSmithStudent2022Anti-racist action has to be taken for all non-white races. The establishment of the African American studies department only came about because students mobilized and spoke out and even occupied a deans office in the 70s. Maybe in the 2020s it won’t have to come to that to create an Asian American studies department.BrookeWarnerStudent2023We should dedicate more time and recognition to the fact that anti-asian stereotypes and prejudices in the western world have been used to justify imperialism, colonization, and continued labor exploitation in the east and global south. Asian issues are not new and are far deeper than socially oriented stereotypes. We have to look closely and critically at how seemingly shallow or “harmless” social stereotypes are rooted in white supremacist politics and economics and have harmful repercussions for entire populations. Asian Americans remain ostracized and otherized by American cultural definitions regardless of how many generations of Asian Americans have been born into citizenship here. This has been too long overlooked in our teachings of history and understated in our understandings of racism and white supremacy. We need to do more to recognize the long history of Asian issues and contributions in the Americas dating back to the age of exploration.LucaMorganteStudentGSB 2023JuliaCorbettAlumniFCRH 2020EliseMcDonaldStudentFCRH 2021KiyanaMarshStudentFCRH 2021LilyOchsAlumniFCRH 2020CharlieMurrayAlumniFCRH 2019EllieKimStudentFCLC 2021ClarkWaleckiStudentFCRH 2023SarahMcGheeStudentFCLC 2024NatassjaAginaAlumniFCLC 2020DanielDrollStudentFCRH 2022DevGandhiStudentGSB 2023SelinBayramStudentFCRH 2021MaxBorchardtStudentFCRH 2021Emma JaneKonkolyStudentFCLC 2023Emma JaneKonkolyStudentFCLC 2023BridgetMcDermottStudent2023KatherineLeeStudentFCLC 2022gillianrobertsStudentFCRH 2022BrennanConnellStudentFCRH 2024MarissaPecorelliStudentFCLC 2023KathrynTeaneyAlumniGSB 2019KarinSchroederStudentFCRHCharlieFriedlanderStudentFCLC 2022KimYapAlumniGSB 2019KatieCarriganStudentFCLC 2024EmilyMarczakAlumniFCLC 2018MaeveRooneyStudentFCRH 2023FrancesPistorinoStudentFCRH 2022KathyLiuAlumniFCLC 2019ElizabethKangStudentFCLC 2022EmilyKrichmarStudentFCLC 2021alyssamorterudStudentFCLC 2023KristenGiaimoStudentGSS 2021EmilyYuStudentGabelli 2023RobertWalczukStudent2024DellianSehraStudentFCLC 2023JuliaLapajStudentFCRH 2024Dana SofiaLealStudentFCLC 2022NicoleFreeleyStudentFCRH 2024LauraConnorStudent2022ErinLeeStudentFCRH 2022PeggyAndoverFacultyAssociate Professor of PsychologyWinyMoranStudentFCLC 2022DanaSkieraStudentFCRH 2021MalorieWatsonStudentClinical Psychology PhD StudentVidhurVashishtAlumniFCLC 2020BridgetClaflimStudent2022MadisonLetoStudentFCLC 2021ChrisRhombergFacultyProfessor of SociologySicilySeitzFormer studentFormer FCLC 2023LuisUmanaStudent2022EricaLimAlumniFCRH 2020MariaSkevasStudent2024KyannaCamachoStudentFCLC 2024HannaBowmanStudentFCLC 2021SamanthaKawalecStudentGSB 2023SamuelCanedaStudentFCRH 2021TatiannaPortillo DiazStudentFCRH 2024SophieChenStudentFCLC 2023IsabellaScipioniStudentFCLC 2023MeenasaraniMuruganFacultyAssistant Professor, Department of Communication and Media StudiesElijahYeringtonStudentGabelli 2024SarahBarlynStudentFCLC 2024DipitaDasStudentFCLC 2024MeredithSchuttStudentFCLC 2023LydiaHallettStudentFCLC 2021ZekeTweedieStudentFCLC 2022AlyssaGrimandoStudentGSBLC 2021JillJiStudentFCLC 2023JulieChyunStudentFCRH 2023CaitlinLillyStudentFCRH 2024JamesSmytheStudentFCRH 2024Julia ElizabethPetalcorinStudentGSB RH 2022ClaireReynoldsStudent2023LuisPena VasquezStudentGSB 2023DanielAhernStudentGSB 2021Tess MariaSeidlerStudentFCRH 2024SarahStinsonAlumni2019SophiaFontanillaStudentFCLC 2022TareaKarunaratneAlumniFCLC 2020AlyssaMacalusoStudentFCLC 2023DianaRivasStudent2023JenniferMoormanFacultyAssistant Professor of Communication & Media StudiesGinoCatalanoStudentFCRH 2021AudreyJohnstonStudent2021SaudiyaAllyStudentFCRH 2022GretaMcLaughlinStudentFCRH 2024TinaZouStudentFCRH 2023This is a must and Fordham can do betterErinClewellAlumniFCRH 2019LukeZadrimaStudentGabelli 2023AbbyDziuraStudentFCRH 2024MaryamIsmailStudentFCRH 2021JillianKennyStudentFCRH 2021ChantalChevalierStudentGraduate School of Education 2021MollySibonaStudentFCRH 2024AlissaKerrStudentFCLC 2021SantiagoVidal CalvoStudentFCRH 2024LukeCorradoStudentGSB 2022SarahGoldsteinStudentFCRH 2023MaliaGuebliStudentFCRH 2023RachelReckerAlumniFCRH ‘19StevenRuggieroStudentFCRH 2022MelanieRiehlStudentFCLC 2022GabrielleSimporiosStudentFCRH 2024ColeMullinsStudentFCRH 2024 (Senator)AvaWienerStudentFCLC 2023OliviaHigginsStudent2021CaterinaBocardoStudentFCLC 2024RyanChenStudentFCLC 2024MollyZimmermanFacultyAssociate Professor of PsychologyMKHollandStudentFCLC 2024AveryPrimisStudentFCLC 2022OliviaKoziolStudentFCRH 2023SarahThompsonStudent2023IsabelleFaraonStudentFCLC 2022LaurenMillerStudentFCRH 2023EllenTruittStudentGSB 2022JustineWendtStudentFCRH 2023GraceThorntonStudentGSB 2022EmmaDiedeStudentFCRH 2021GraceShenFacultyAssociate Professor of HistoryPlease take this seriously and make it a real, working program with new hires, so that it does not stretch thin faculty and other programs.

I helped to create the syllabus for the very 1st Asian American Studies course at SUNY Buffalo in Fall 1990 as a 1st semester freshman. Then co-taught the course as a 2nd semester freshman in Spring 1991 (30 Years ago). Taught for another year and handed it off to other passionate student instructors since we didn’t have any faculty. It was an independent study course under the guidance of the late Professor Lawrence “Larry” Chisolm, American Studies Dept. founder. Course text used was Ronald Takaki’s, Stranger’s from a Different Shore. The first half of the class, was about Asian American history and contributions. Then the second half we discussed more about issues whether current or historical that we felt needed to be addressed.
