I did precisely that when I ventured into photography as a hobby in 2007. I discovered the fascinating origins of the first camera, the Camera Obscura, which was initially used by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 5th century BC to study the eclipse of the sun. My research was quite interesting. Intrigued, I delved deeper into the early pioneers of photography, and one name that stood out was Julia Margaret Cameron.\n\nJulia Margaret Cameron, born on June 11th, 1815, in Calcutta, British India, embarked on her photography career at 48 when her daughter gifted her a camera. Cameron's career was incredibly productive despite her late start, resulting in around 900 photographs created over 12 years. It's important to note that during her time, the Victorian era, women were often confined to the home. Yet, Cameron defied societal expectations and significantly impacted the field.\n\n\"I began with no knowledge of the art... I did not know where to place my dark box, how to focus my sitter, and my first picture I effaced to my consternation by rubbing my hand over the filmy side of the glass.\"\n\nHowever, Cameron's work was subject to controversy. Critics of her time dismissed her softly focused and unrefined images, labelling them amateurish and shallow. These comments stemmed from her signature look being quite different from the industry standard at the time. Nevertheless, Cameron persisted, blending an unorthodox technique with a profoundly spiritual sensibility, resulting in unique and enduring photographs.\n\nCameron's photographic subjects ranged from renowned figures like the world-famous biologist, Charles Darwin and dramatist Henry Taylor, to everyday individuals. In 1864, she captured a powerful image of nine-year-old Annie Philpot, which she described as her \"first success.\" Cameron's dedication and talent were evident in her swift process of capturing, printing, toning, fixing, and framing the photograph within a single day. This was not the norm during her time.\n\nAs her career progressed, Cameron gained recognition and became a Photographic Society of Scotland member. Her prints were sold through reputable London dealers, and she held her first solo exhibition in November 1865. Her work garnered significant demand, leading to European exhibitions and earning her awards and honourable mentions.\n\nJulia Margaret Cameron's contributions to photography have not been forgotten. She has become an influential figure for future modern and contemporary photographers. Today, we are fortunate to have talented female photographers like Yoko Ono, Annie Leibovitz, and TY Bello in Nigeria who continue pushing the boundaries of the art form.\n\nCameron's story teaches us a valuable lesson: pursuing our dreams is always possible. Although starting her photography career relatively late, Cameron made an indelible mark on the field. Her passion, persistence, and willingness to defy societal norms inspire all of us to follow our passions, regardless of age or circumstances.\n\nLessons from Juliaâ€™s Life:\n\nEmbrace your passions. Never let age or societal norms deter you from pursuing your dreams.\n\nChallenge conventions: Don't be afraid to break away from established practices and forge your path.\n\nSeek inspiration from trailblazers: Study the lives and works of those who have paved the way before you.\n\nBuild a supportive network: Connect with like-minded individuals and seek mentorship from experienced professionals.\n\nStay persistent: Overcoming obstacles is an inevitable part of any journey. Embrace challenges and learn from your setbacks.\n\nIn conclusion, the story of Julia Margaret Cameron reminds us of the power of perseverance and the importance of embracing our unique voices. Let us draw inspiration from her extraordinary journey and continue to pursue our dreams with unwavering determination.\n\nFor those who feel stalled or uncertain of their path or may think they are too old to make a career switch, take inspiration from Cameron's late-life reinvention. New technologies disrupt industries, so be bold and acquire new skills through continuous learning. Volunteering your expertise can help position you for tomorrow's opportunities."
