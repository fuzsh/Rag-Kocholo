        "text": "Together, Elaine and Myron (Mike) Adler founded Myron Manufacturing Corporation in 1949, the same year they married. Myron is now an international promotional gifts firm that markets its products exclusively to other businesses and is one of the largest businesses in Bergen County.\n\nIn addition to being successful entrepreneurs, the Adlers were committed community activists. Mrs. Adler was a member of the board at the Arnold P. Gold Foundation for Humanism in Medicine, the Center for Inter-Religious Understanding, the Community Resource Council, the Jewish Home, and Rehabilitation Center and the USA Toy Lending Library Association. Both Mr. and Mrs. Adler have been honored by the ADL, UJA, Boys Town of Jerusalem, Bergen Community College, Hadassah, NJ Speech and Hearing Association and the National Aphasia Association.\n\nAfter Mr. Adler suffered a stroke in 1993, they founded the Adler Aphasia Center in Maywood. This community-based center has received worldwide recognition for its programs for people with aphasia and their caregivers. They now also have a center in West Orange, one in their honor in Jerusalem, as well as several other satellite centers in New Jersey.\n\nThe Adlers became involved with Ramapo College since the early 1990s. Mrs. Adler provided leadership on the Board of Governors of the Ramapo College Foundation and the Adlers? support has strengthened countless programs at the College–from the theater program to the Havemeyer Edible Garden. In 2007, the Adlers created this award, the College?s 100th endowed scholarship.\n\nIn 2012, the couple made a $2 million gift to establish the Adler Center for Nursing Excellence, the home of the College?s highly-acclaimed and expanding nursing programs, as well as state-of-the-art labs to enhance the education of all science students. For their ongoing support and leadership, the College recognized the Adlers with honorary degrees in 1999.\n\nSadly, Mr. Adler passed away in 2015, and Mrs. Adler passed away in 2023.\n\nMake a Donation\n\n2024 Recipients\n\n2023 Recipients\n\n2022 Recipients\n\n2021 Recipients\n\n2020 Recipients\n\n2019 Recipients\n\n2018 Recipients\n\n2017 Recipients\n\n2016 Recipients\n\n2015 Recipients\n\n2014 Recipients\n\n2013 Recipients\n\n2012 Recipients\n\n2011 Recipients\n\n2010 Recipients\n\n2009 Recipients"
