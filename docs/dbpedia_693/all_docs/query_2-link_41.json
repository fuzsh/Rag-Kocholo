        "text": "So, last Thursday I finally got to wear the velvet hat and don the UCL Computer Science PhD gown and officially graduate at the Royal Festival Hall. It was such fun! And this is a great opportunity to name check some of the amazing people who supported me along the way. This research could not have happened without the inspiring #teachers who talked to me about their experiences of stress, and willingness to trial technology to manage it. The exceptional circumstances of the pandemic further demonstrated their dedication and service to children - thank you so very much. One teacher in particular assisted throughout this research. Clive Manning you are an outstanding educator, and I am in awe of your commitment to young people no matter their circumstances and despite the enormous pressures placed upon your profession. Your constant support for me as well during the years of the PhD was incredible; I am honoured to be your wife. To my children #Tiffany and Jeremiah Manning, I am deeply grateful to you for believing in me and for valuing my work. You mean the world to me. My sincere thanks go to Paul Marshall for those first pivotal discussions and encouraging me to apply for the #EPSRC DTP scholarship at UCL for which I am extremely grateful. To my supervisors: Professor Ann Blandford your exceptional reputation for analytical rigour and research quality in #HCI is richly deserved and I am deeply grateful for all the time you invested in me and commitment to team learning at the weekly cake-fuelled meetings! To Professor Julian Edbrooke-Childs thank you for challenging me with new perspectives from psychology and for always being so encouraging. Your dedication to improving #mentalhealth treatment is amazing. Thank you to the friends who knew what a PhD entailed and encouraged me to take the plunge, including Nigel Cameron Dr Paul Aldrich, FCIPD, FHEA Amy Orr-Ewing Andrew Paxman #JamesOrr #ChrisGonde Ashley Berner and Dr Eli Gardner. To Cllr Alison Inglis-Jones Karen Brown and Baroness Elizabeth Berridge your treats, holidays, prayers and champagne sustained me! To those who cheered me along the way, so many of whom spoke words of encouragement at pertinent moments, thanks particularly to Dr Nikki Newhouse #ProfessorJaneMarshall Louise Bamber Claire Peyton Jones (née Randall) Jon Paxman Finally, Thanks to all my stellar #UCLIC colleagues – the outstanding, talented staff body and fellow PhD students and post-docs who made the Interaction Centre such a friendly and intellectually stimulating place to study. The mutual support was remarkable! I believe in the potential of digital to improve health outcomes, but that we should empower people without exploiting their data, and create connections without cutting contact. It is an extraordinary privilege to have some time away from the workplace to read, research, analyse and contemplate. I will be eternally grateful."
