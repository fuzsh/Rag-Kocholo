        "text": "PRESIDENT\n\nHi! My name is Riya Shah, and I am honored to be serving EVC’s chapters and partners as the National Student Board President for the 2023-2024 term. I am a senior at Saint Louis University concentrating in public health and health management. When I am not in class, you can catch me at the gym, either lifting weights or dancing. I am also a huge Chicago sports fan! Being a South Asian woman, a focal point of my undergraduate years has been focused on the intersection between voter engagement and racial justice. As the current Director of Voter Engagement on campus, I seek to uncover and address the barriers that prevent college students from voting through my research, and I have organized various events that highlight the importance of each individual vote. I thereby joined Every Vote Counts last year as the National Director of Communications and Operations and hoped to engage a wide range of students in order to share resources that promote enhanced accessibility to voting and increase voter turnout. As the President, I hope to consistently empower youth voices through voting, while also working towards amplifying and addressing the concerns of minority communities, thereby reducing barriers in the electoral process.\n\nriya@evcnational.org\n\nVICE PRESIDENT\n\nHi! My name is Cameron (she/her), and I’m a senior at Stanford majoring in Political Science and Philosophy. Heading into my second year as Vice President of the EVC National Student Board, I’m eager to continue applying what I’ve learned from spearheading civic engagement projects on my own campus. I find EVC’s identity as a student-led organization empowering as a young person trying to make my voice heard. When I’m not sitting at a voter registration table, I can be found going to the movies or baking bread with friends in my vegetarian commune.\n\ncameron@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF NON-LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY\n\nHi! My name is Logan Tullai (he/him), and I'm a junior at Brown University studying Political Science and Economics. As the Director of Non-Legislative Advocacy, I’m excited to focus on institutionalizing measures that improve voting access and turnout. On campus, I’m involved with voting access as the President of Brown EVC and as the Chair of Advocacy for Brown Votes, the university’s initiative for democratic participation. Outside of voting advocacy, I am a Research Analyst for the Brown Investment Group, managing part of the University’s endowment, and I sail on the Club Sailing Team.\n\nlogan@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF DATA MANAGEMENT\n\nHi! My name is Anoushka and I’m a junior at the University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Finance on the Pre-Law track. As the new Director of Data of Management, I’m excited to leverage my skills in order to empower the youth to vote! I personally believe that civic engagement is essential to influence our government and society. Aside from my academic and professional interests, I love to sing and am the captain of my university’s competitive a cappella team, Dhunki. I also serve as the volunteer coordinator for UTD’s chapter of Akshaya Patra as well as the secretary of UTD’s Investment Management Club.\n\nanoushka@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF ELECTIONS & ENGAGEMENT\n\nHi! My name is Olivia (she/her), and I am the Director of Elections & Engagement. I am a junior at Claremont McKenna College pursuing a double major in Government and Russian and Eastern European Studies. Growing up as the daughter of an immigrant, I was brought up to value both liberty and patriotism. Voter registration and other voting efforts are a way for me to serve our democracy as a student. I have been involved in voter registration efforts since high school, volunteering with the League of Women Voters and HeadCount and leading a two-year effort to register high school seniors at my school. I was also involved in election security and resilience work with Girl Security during the 2020 Presidential Elections. Every Vote Counts is a fantastic organization that empowers civic-minded college students like me. Most recently, I was able to serve as President of Every Vote Counts (EVC) Claremont, the 5 Claremont College Chapter of Every Vote Counts. I will also now be serving as a founding Co-Director of the Claremont Initiative for Voter Engagement Strategies (CIVES), a joint initiative between EVC Claremont and the Kravis Lab for Social Impact to increase voter turnout and active citizenship on campus. I am very excited to help even more students this year and look forward to working with all our incredible chapters and partners!\n\nolivia@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS & OPERATIONS\n\nHi! I’m Bryce Emanuel, a senior at Vanderbilt University studying Human-Computer Interaction with a minor in Neuroscience. I’m a South Florida native, dedicated to advocacy surrounding voter rights, sustainability, and the dismantling of systems that hinder the path to equity for marginalized groups in the United States. My journey to voter advocacy started as a part of the first Vandy Votes Executive Board in mid-2020. I helped students, faculty members and other people in the surrounding Middle Tennessee area get informed about voter registration, rights, and legislation. After moving up the ranks, most recently as Vice President of Vandy Votes, I became aware of the work being done at Every Vote Counts, specifically with the National Student Board, and decided to learn more and get involved! I’m humbled and excited to be working as the Director of Communications and Operations on the 2023-2024 National Student Board of Every Vote Counts.\n\nbryce@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF CIVIC EDUCATION\n\nHi! My name is Julia (she/her)! I am a senior at Lafayette College and am double majoring in Government and Law and Psychology. My dedication to participating in civic and political life began during high school where I was able to participate in activities such as Moot Court and the Center for Civic Education’s We The People speech competition and has continued with my participation in Lafayette College’s LafayetteVotes! organization, and now Every Vote Counts. I am also the Bergh Scholar and Assistant Manager of Gov Lab, a student-led research project focused on evidence-based policy. As the Director of Civc Education of the EVC’s National Student Executive Board, I am excited to have a hands-on experience with several different EVC partners, and hopefully some new ones, promoting civic engagement and voting reforms throughout the country.\n\njulia@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY\n\nHi! My name is Lexi (she/her), and I’m a junior at Stanford University studying history and digital humanities. I’m beyond excited to join the EVC team and spearhead initiatives to increase the accessibility of legislative advocacy and education on college campuses nationwide. On my campus, I serve as the leader of StanfordVotes, where you’ll find me working on voter registration and civic engagement efforts with an occasional pause to hike the Dish or grab a seat at Philz Coffee - the best in the Bay.\n\nlexi@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF MEDIA\n\nHi there! My name is Giulia Matteucci (she/her) and I am a senior at Lafayette College, double majoring in Government & Law and Psychology. On campus, I am the Excel Scholar and Manager of Gov Lab, a student-led research project, currently focused on the influence of evidence in policy-making. I am also the Student Director of Lafayette Votes!, a student and faculty community organization dedicated to increasing voter engagement among Lafayette students and providing research based resources/ information. I am also the co-founder and President of The Women’s Network- Lafayette, a chapter on campus that serves women and non-binary students on professional and leadership development. Off campus, I am part of the Gov Club, a group by Girl and the Gov, the podcast, centered on increasing youth turnout and providing easy-to-understand information on all things of the civic process. Additionally, I am delighted to join the team as the Director of Media and to continue the influential work of EVC in protecting and promoting voter access!\n\ngiulia@evcnational.org\n\nDIRECTOR OF INTERNAL ENGAGEMENT\n\nHi! My name is Elena (she/her) and I am a senior at Cornell University, majoring in Biology & Society. I am originally from Portland, Oregon and I am a big fan of being in nature and drinking local coffee! On campus, I’ve worked extensively with Cornell Votes and found out about EVC through our partnership. I am excited to be the Director of Internal Engagement for EVC National to further extend my impacts on civic engagement. Working with our passionate student board, I’m truly inspired by every single partner and chapter we have worked with and am excited to continue these crucial relationships this year.\n\nelena@evcnational.org"
