To the best of my knowledge, Disney's only foray into further development was the live-action sequel 102 Dalmations (2000), which was actually the sequel to the 1996 live-action remake of the original film. Another 101 Dalmations movie, 101 Dalmations II: Patch's London Adventure (2002) had nothing to do with the original or sequel books.

As Walt himself passed away the year before the The Starlight Barking was written, he obviously couldn't invest in the project. After Walt died, Disney Studios mostly abandoned animated projects for the next decade. The Jungle Book was released in 1967 (and was in production when he died), The Aristocats was released in 1970 and Robin Hood was released in 1973.

Oddly, Disney did eventually produce a Sci-Fi movie about extraterrestrial animals visiting Earth; The Cat From Outer Space was released in 1978 and was largely panned by critics.
