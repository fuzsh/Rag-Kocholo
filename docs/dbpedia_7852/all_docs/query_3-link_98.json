        "text": "Another straight to DVD sequel for Disney, \"101 Dalmatians II\" is its best effort yet, and it debuts on a decent quality disc.\n\nTECHNICAL FEATURES\n\nPicture Solid colours and razor sharp definition distinguish this excellent picture transfer.\n\nSound Unusually for a non-theatrical film, you get the luxury of a choice of Dolby and DTS mixes. You'd be hard pushed to tell the difference between them, but both are lively and make good - if only occasional use - of the rear surrounds.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\n\nMaking of 'Dogumentary' This seven-minute look behind the scenes tries hard to appeal to kids, but just ends up being bizarre with grown adults mugging away at the camera. There's a little look at the animation process and clips of the voice actors at work.\n\nLost in London Can you steer the double decker bus around London to safety? With this interactive game, you have to decide the direction to take, and along the way you get little videos of the London sights.\n\nThunderbolt's Dressing Room Ever wanted to rustle around a star's dressing room? Here's your chance to get stuck into Thunderbolt's trailer and read his fanmail, look at pictures, find his blooper reel, and more.\n\nWill Young Music Video One day all DVDs will come with one of these...\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\n\nRegion: 2\n\nChapters: 12\n\nRatio: 1.85:1 (anamorphic)\n\nSound: Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1\n\nAudio Tracks: English and Turkish\n\nSubtitles: English and Turkish\n\nCaptions: English\n\nMenus: Animated, with Dalmatians\n\nSpecial Features Subtitles: None of the special features come with subtitles.\n\nThis DVD was reviewed on a JVC XV-S57 DVD player."
