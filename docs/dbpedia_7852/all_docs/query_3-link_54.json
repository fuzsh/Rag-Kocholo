        "text": "I think it is no secret I do not like the Disney sequels despite overall liking DTV films, so here is one I do like. It is by no means a great movie, but it is fine. It feels like a movie and does not fall for the usual Disney sequel traps of having their kid do the movie over or just be three TV show episodes. Instead it is a movie that goes in a very different direction with a some minor characters.\n\nOver the credits a single spot is getting smothered by the rest and hopelessly trying to escape them. I normally like opening like this but I think the foreshadowing is way too obvious. This does show one of the problems, as the film does not rely on subtly enough despite being very good at it.\n\nThe movie begins with them about to move to the farm. Most of the British accents are too thick. Roger’s voice is off and his song sucks. It was a bad idea to sing it and “Dalmatian Plantation” at the same time. They clash too badly. There are a few scenes showing that Patch is having a middle child crisis (I can relate) and Pongo is not much help due to being an overworked dad. It helps that Patch actually has a good British accent. Admittedly Roger and Pongo are voiced by British people, so I am wondering if my memory of British accents is off. Interestingly now they get Roly’s book name right. As a chicken owner I hate the casual joke about chasing chickens.\n\nThey watch the Thunderbolt show to introduce our second lead. It is very interesting that they put last film’s main characters in the background and focus on two very minor characters from the first film, and I like that. It helps to have its own voice. Why does Thunderbolt now have a pitiful sidekick? The show looks repetitive and slow. Watching it does capture the family dynamics, and they are accurate to what siblings are like, lots of mockery and insults despite all the love. Patch wants to be One of a Kind like Thunderbolt instead of one of 101.\n\nIt may have been a mistake reviewing this right after a Pixar film.\n\nCruella De Vil is trying to buy furs despite her probabtions aying she cannot do that. The store owner is really devoted to helping Cruella in her probation, and stops her, what a pal. She gets in her horribly broken down car that plays “Cruella De Vil” on the radio. Can Cruella sue Roger for that song? What type of cop allows that thing on the road.\n\nArt scene is where it gets good. I cannot tell if it is praising or parodying modern art, and that is part of the charm. Cruella now wants a spot painting or something when she sees Lars’s spot art. It is just so weird seeing a psychopath talking to a guy who is roleplaying as crazy and slowly turning from it, and it is entertaining.\n\nThey accidently leaves Patch behind and he decides the best course of action is to see Thunderbolt’s public show that day with the usual trope of not knowing he is an actor. Thunderbolt is an arrogant imbecile, and that is how he works as a side character. He gets a hard fall due to being easily duped by Lightning into leaving to try to do heroics in the real world while talking to his own merchandise. Lightning tricks him into thinking they are going to replace him, and he needs to go out and do heroic things to impress the public.\n\nTurns out he really sucks at imrpov, so he needs Patch with his perfect memory of the show to tell him everything to do, but the stuff he wants to do are the opposite of heroic. For some reason they think Lightning can take over like he planned. I like his dark jokes, but that is like replacing The Rock with Kevin Hart. That is more than a rewrite for a new direction.\n\nPatch and Thunderbolt bond over being pushed away from the top and off the top. They do seem to have a legit friendship that grows organically, and I like most of their scenes together, even if there is nothing too interesting to write about.\n\nHorace and Jasper are setnenced to prison but Cruella pays their bale and… That is not how bale works. The cop just stands there as they discuss going back to crime and does nothing over their car theft with witness. These cops are the real villains.\n\nThunderbolt and Patch’s picture did get in the newspaper, and they use a magnifying glass to tread their new address (not going to work). They go to the farm to do more dognapping. Since they keep showing the puppies chasing chickens I am upset with them too, and I am really enjoying Horace and Jasper’s comedy. Were they brothers int he first film? In the first one being robbed is scary and treated as serious business. Here it is comedy. Why steal instead of just buy some dogs? Got to be revenge motivated since this is pointlessly evil.\n\nThey take the puppies to Lars who ditches his cool façade and just loves on them hoping to make a painting of them, and Cruella informs him he will be making a painting with them (their coats as canvases). He refuses as long as he has anything to say about it, so they gag him. I love how he asks how they can morally do it, and they answer thinking he means how they can physically do it. I always love that trope.\n\nThe twilight bark scene is too repetitive, but I like that the puppies start it. It shows growth and learning from the last time, as they now know to start it themselves to get help. According to IMDB Sgt. Tibbs from the first one was supposed to be kidnapped with them, but he was written out. Honestly all of the main characters from last film are absent or have minor roles. SInce the Disney sequels are so bad at using the main characters I think this change works for the best.\n\nWord gets to Patch and Thunderbolt, and Thunderbolt realizes saving puppies is the media stunt he needs. Thunderbolt is still the same dumb gloryhound, but he at least gets Patch’s name right now. Lightning hears and joins them to sabotage it. Patch suggests a stealth maneuver and rescuing without any fighting, but Lightning appeals to Thunderbolt’s ego to get him to instead to a frontal assault. It does not scare them, and Cruella does Patch’s plan of stealthily knocking him out.\n\nLightning then brags about betraying Thunderbolt, how he will take over the show, and reveals all of Thunderbolt’s lying. He then leaves while laughing evilly the whole time. Patch is furious at Thunderbolt, and Thunderbolt is just lying there too depressed to do anything and just calling himself an “actor”.\n\nAfter talking about the show with Lucky Patch accepts that Thundebolt is an actor, and he uses things he learned from the show to escape in a realistic way… Scratch that the tone does a complete 180 from realism to Looney Tunes. Now the laws of physics are constantly broken and it is a huge car chase all over London in absolute insanity.\n\nI am kind of mixed on this. For one it is such a turn and breaks the movie’s own feeling. On the other hand the original book would get very crazy too, and this is very entertaining.\n\nLightning and Cruella are both the main villains but until now they have never shared the screen at all. They have completely different goals and keep coincidently indirectly helping the other. The party bus runs into Lightning making the two villains finally interact. Part of what I like about Lightning is the film knows he is not intimidating in a physical fight. From now on he is a non entity.\n\nThunderbolt is inspired by their faith in his TV character’s heroics. He finally gets out of the cage to help, and he “arrives in the nick of time.” He accepts what he is by being an actor and faking a heart attack throwing all four villains off. Horace and Jasper just stand there in confusion, while Cruella accidently hits them both with the crowbar.\n\nThe movie has not been subtle but this Lightning and Thunderbolt scene is. Thunderbolt pretends to die and Lightning cries over it. Earlier Thunderbolt told him he always wanted a great death scene, and here he gets it. In addition Lightning keeps calling him a sucky actor, and here he is proven wrong. Why was Lightning crying over his enemy? He probably just never thought he would actually see him dead.\n\nAfter that is the basic wrap up of villains arrested and the family is reunited. It ends with a few newspaper jokes like Horace and Jasper make a chain of women’s clothes stores.\n\nThere is a seemingly pointless credit scene where Thunderbolt got all 99 puppies on the show. This is actually him making good on his promise to Patch showing character growth.\n\nThis film is pretty good. It has a basic plot with the third act breakup and liar revealed, but it is entertaining for children (I did see it at the target age first and rewatched it twice for this post). Enough for three Tree Stars.\n\nNext time Stargirl Season 2’s review."
