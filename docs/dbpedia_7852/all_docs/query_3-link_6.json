        "text": "Post by Flowgli on\n\nI'll go into further detail on my thoughts on this sequel.\n\nI've seen that it has gotten positive reviews from many people who have seen it, but even then, it's far, far away from being nearly as good as these people make it out to be. In fact, it's one of the worst sequels that DisneyToon Studios ever released. The story is weak, the dialogue is bad, the characters from the original are watered down, and it's a sequel to an animated Disney classic that was made decades ago with the involvement of Walt Disney.\n\nThis movie feels more like an extended pilot episode for a series reboot, which I think that's what they originally were going for, due to the quality of the animation (which is a lot better than the series that we got anyway) and the fact that it focuses mainly on just one pup, with the latter being something that is expected to be seen in an episode of the series and not in a movie, making the development of the other pups coming off as lacking. Also, they did too much to make Patch look different from the other pups by making him the only one with a black ear when the spot on his right eye in which he got his name from, is enough to make him look different from the other pups. I mean, I know the title of this sequel is called Patch's London Adventure, and it's mainly about Patch, but that's going too far, not to mention that it is a 101 Dalmatians movie, and something like this shouldn't be in a movie like that anyway.\n\nI like the addition of Li'l Lightning, but he just seems to come out of nowhere, and the fact that he turned out to be a bad guy in the end and get defeated in the end really bugs me.\n\nJust like other sequels to animated Disney films, this one lacks everything that its predecessor has: a compelling story, well-written dialogue, well-developed characters, animation with quality of an actual movie rather than with quality of a TV show, and a heart. I've taken a look at other reviews to this movie that are not-so-well-receptive, and the review of it done by CodedLockFilms is the review of it that I prefer the most.\n\nNow, keep in mind that I am not forbidding anyone from liking this movie. If you like it (which I know that most people on here do, but that actually is mainly because it's a 101 Dalmatians movie), then that's okay. Just don't make it out to be as good as you claim it.\n\nAlso, most recently in the thread about the three female fans of Thunderbolt, I've revealed that Kathryn Beaumont (voice of Alice from Alice In Wonderland and Wendy from Peter Pan) did a character voice in this movie. This bit of information can be found in a few places on the Internet. In that thread, bab and I had a back-and-forth discussion on which character she voiced in it, but which character she voiced in it was never confirmed anywhere.\n\nPost by Flowgli on\n\nIt would seem that everyone disagrees with me. I can't say that I'm surprised about this, though. Well, I'm not gonna stop you or anyone else from liking it, but I still say it's one of the worse sequels. It would also seem that the fact that Lucky has white ears in this movie bugs many people. And I know that this movie centers around Patch, but they don't need to go overboard and make him stand out from the rest of the pups by making him the only one to have a black ear. He does that just as well enough with just the spot over his right eye, and since this is a 101 Dalmatians movie (which, like I said, is mainly the reason why many people here like it or say it's good), it shouldn't center around just one Dalmatian pup anyway. By making Patch stand out from the rest of the Dalmatian pups, it seems that it's insulting the intelligence of its viewers, thinking that they wouldn't tell which pup is Patch if he wasn't made to stand out the way he did here. I hate it when movies and shows do that."
