        "text": "\"Thunderbolt watch out!\" Kali and the twins cried out.\n\nBut it was too late, Thunderbolt was struck and left unconscious. Patch gasped in shock, running over to his idol in panic.\n\n\"What have we here?\" Cruella grinned darkly at Patch, coming over with Scorch on her shoulder.\n\nThe twins came over to Patch, but were too scared of Cruella to do anything to stop her.\n\n\"Oh, it's you\" The devil woman then chuckled evilly. \"I owe you a debt of gratitude, my photogenic friend\" she showed Patch the paper with his and the twins' picture on it with Thunderbolt.\n\n\"Leave him alone!\" Brock and Ann defended Patch, trying to be brave while facing Cruella even though they were helpless against her.\n\n\"If it wasn't for you, I'd have never found your brothers and sisters\" Cruella then picked up Patch and brought him over to the other puppies.\n\n\"And now I have you all!\" she gave her evil laugh.\n\nThe twins were then tied up with their sister. That's when Scorch saw Kali's crystal hanging from a chain on her neck which he hadn't notice before. Without warning, Scorch swiftly swiped Kali's crystal from her and gave it to Cruella.\n\n\"What's this?\" Cruella looked at the crystal, already admiring it.\n\n\"Hey, that's mine!\" Kali glared towards the ferret.\n\nBut Cruella was planing on keeping Kali's crystal for now in her pocket until she could get a good look at it later. Which was bad for Kali, as she telepathically figured out, along with help from her magic/time sorcerer teacher (still in training) Albert, that the crystal's power can become very dangerous in the wrong hands.\n\nHorace and Jasper then placed Patch and Thunderbolt in a cage.\n\n\"You'll pay for what you've done!\" Kali glared at Cruella and her minions, but then frowned after they left. She then turned to her siblings.\n\n\"I'm so glad you guys are okay\" she attempted to hug her little siblings even though she was tied up.\n\n\"Well, we were okay until Cruella snuck up on us\" Brock frowned to his big sister.\n\nThe three siblings were still happy to see each other though. They then looked over to Patch and Thunderbolt in their cage, worried as Thunderbolt was still unconscious.\n\n\"Thunder?...\" Patch came over to the wonder dog. \"Are you playing dead?\" the dalmatian pup sounded worried while nudging him.\n\nThunderbolt then woke up which made the kids and Patch relieved. \"That hurt. That really hurt\" Thunderbolt rubbed his head.\n\n\"I knew you were faking it\" Patch smiled with a little giggle.\n\n\"Oh, he's been faking it all right\" a familiar voice said as Lightning then appeared.\n\n\"Lightning, little buddy\" Thunderbolt smiled to his sidekick.\n\n\"I am not your little buddy!\" Lightning jumped up to the cage, glaring at the german shepherd. \"And you are no wonder dog!\"\n\n\"This kid trusted you, and look where it's got him\" The corgi said.\n\n\"What does he mean?\" Patch asked Thunderbolt before Lightning smiled sinisterly.\n\n\"He's been lying to you all day kid. He doesn't care about you or your family. He was just trying to get his name in the paper, and save his job\" Lightning said, while looking ominous. \"Ask him\"\n\n\"What?\" Patch turned to his hero in shock and confusion.\n\n\"No!\" Thunderbolt said before his ears lowered, feeling bad now. \"Well, yeah, but-\" he tried to explain.\n\n\"Hey genius, you're no hero! You're a fraud!\" Lightning angrily declared at his former friend.\n\nThunderbolt hung his head, feeling ashamed now.\n\n\"And by the way... There never was a plan to recast you, I just had to get you out of the way\" Lightning smiled wickedly at the german shepherd, then started to leave while Patch, the kids and the puppies felt miserable.\n\n\"Why are you doing this, Lightning?\" Kali asked, feeling betrayed. Even though she hardly knew the corgi.\n\n\"Do you know what it's like to be unappreciated and ignored?!\" The corgi turned and glared at the adventure girl for a moment.\n\n\"Well, after this I'll finally be able to step out of that overrated, overacting ham's shadow!\" Lightning clarified, referring to Thunderbolt.\n\nKali and the twins suddenly felt shocked and actually sad for Lightning. Knowing how it felt with the sidekicks not getting much attention and all.\n\n\"Now, I gotta go take your place on the show. My show!\" Lightning laughed evilly as he climbed up the crates and out the window. Thunder was then heard as it began to rain.\n\n\"This was just terrible\" the Harpercop siblings thought while hanging their heads in sadness.\n\n\"Thunder?...\" Patch turned to his hero. \"Thunder, I don't understand. You lied to me?\" the dalmatian puppy felt hurt.\n\n\"I put on an act. I'm an actor\" Thunderbolt admitted, then sighed. \"It's what I do\"\n\n\"We should've told you from the start, Patch\" the twins added, with their heads down in shame.\n\n\"Guys?... You knew about this?\" Patch looked to the three humans he looked up to the most, seeming more hurt now.\n\n\"Listen, Patch...\" Kali started. \"All that stuff you see on TV... it's just pretend... make believe\" The tomboy explained, but felt hurt herself that she had to tell the spotted puppy this way.\n\n\"It's not real!\" Thunderbolt told the dalmatian pup.\n\n\"You promised!\" Patch yelled at Thunderbolt in outburst. Then the poor pup went to the corner of the cage and started crying.\n\n\"Patch, buddy...\" Brock spoke softly, trying to talk with the pup he cared about.\n\n\"You all lied...\" Patch only glanced at them, feeling hurt.\n\n\"We're so sorry\" Ann tried to apologize, but Patch turned away from her.\n\n\"I'm not a real wonder dog. I just... acted like one once\" Thunderbolt told Patch, also feeling bad as he layed down in the back of the cage.\n\nA tear rolled down Patch's cheek as he tried to get some sleep.\n\n\"What now?\" The twins asked hopelessly if their big sister had a plan.\n\n\"I- I don't know...\" Kali said quietly with her head down, feeling nothing could be done.\n\nAll seemed hopeless for everyone as they finally felt defeated."
