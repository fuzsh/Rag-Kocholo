The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Fancaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nDoing the direct-to-video sequels must have seemed like a good idea at the start of this journey. For the life of me, I cannot remember why. Midquels inherently offer precious little of value, because no matter what happens, you’ll always end up back where you started. At least Bambi II had a sizable gap that could fit some good character development. Beauty and the Beast also has a montage that implies character growth for its two leads, and while Enchanted Christmas isn’t necessary, it’s not really hurting anything either. But this? There’s no place a midquel could possibly fit without completely derailing the end of the original Fox and the Hound! It’s supposed to be the Best of Friends montage, that’s still only a couple of days, and no matter what happens their friendship still falls apart so what’s the point? And that’s before you get into the absolutely banana-pants insanity that is its premise. Still, Jim Kammerud’s previous directorial effort, 101 Dalmatians 2, was a pleasant surprise, and… oh my god the screenplay is Roger S.H. Schulman? ‘Credited writer on the first Shrek’ Roger S.H. Schulman?! Could this… might this be…?\n\nNah, who am I kidding? This monstrosity has 20% on Rotten Tomatoes and a reputation as one of the worst of the worst D2V sequels. Hooray. Let’s get this over with so I can suffer through Condorman.\n\nSTORY\n\nWe open on Tod and Copper tracking a cricket that looks suspiciously like Squeaks the Caterpillar, who doesn’t appear in this movie. Neither do Big Mama, Dinky, or Boomer, which is one point in the sequel’s favor. After agreeing to work together to capture the cricket, the two kids shake on it (shaking their whole bodies as canines do), and race down the hill. Copper keeps messing up and losing the cricket but they’re having fun anyway because they’re Friends for Life. The opening song is very insistent on this. What? The last movie ended with them separating forever after trying to kill each other? Naaah, that would be ridiculous. Shut up and look at the cute animals frolicking. Copper misjudges a jump and lets the cricket get away, causing him to lose all confidence in his abilities to do anything. It probably doesn’t help that even Tod can’t think of a single talent Copper has. Some friend you are.\n\nThe arrival of a convoy of trucks headed to the county fair snaps Copper out of his depressive episode. The kids watch in awe as vegetables and livestock roll past, and the sound of rhythmic howling catches Copper’s attention. He’s so enchanted by the sound that he tumbles into the road and Tod has to save him from getting splattered by the trucks. So Copper starts being a sad-sack again. Amos Slade (now voiced by Jeff Bennett) calls him home, and Copper declares he’ll be a great hunting dog someday! And Tod encourages this. Which… okay, DisneyToon? No. He does not learn Copper is going to be a hunting dog until Lack of Education, after Copper leaves. And why is Tod so excited about this? He does know what that means, right? Or are we just pretending hunting is a super happy fun time game of chase where no one dies?\n\nChief’s not too happy about having to teach Copper to hunt when he has to practice for the fair. After all, he’s a fourth-place winner, and Rob Paulsen didn’t practice a dead-on Pat Buttram impression for nothing. Amos presents Copper with a sack of flour done up to look like a rabbit and tied to Chief’s tail that he’s supposed to track by smell, which I’m fairly certain is not how this works. Copper shows his owner his best howl, which shakes an apple loose from a tree and startles Amos into firing his gun into the air. And he shoots Widow Tweed (voiced very noticeably by Russi Taylor) another gendered insult for the crime of wanting to bake pies in peace. Glad calling her ‘woman’ as a pejorative is the literal only thing we carried over from the original, thanks, guys. Copper chases Chief through the woods but loses the trail and runs into Tod. After another crisis of confidence (this is already getting old), Tod peps him up and encourages him to howl. This summons Amos and Chief and it’s time for a wacky chase scene!\n\nIt goes on forever as wacky chase scenes are wont to do. Chief’s barking spooks Widow Tweed’s cow Abigail into kicking the milk bucket over. She charges him and now he’s on our back and now there’s a beehive because of course there is, and in the end, he gets thrown into a mud puddle. Because wacky chase scenes love throwing people into water. Widow Tweed chews Amos out for wasting her milk because she’s a dairy farmer, and Amos yells that her fox is chasing her chickens again. Even though he was nowhere near his chickens. He was in the woods. What are you even talking about? Widow Tweed sticks up for her fox and throws a pie in Amos’s face. Seriously. That is what passes for humor in this movie.\n\nSomehow, incredibly, Amos blames Copper for this mess and yells that he’s a bad dog. He punishes him by tying him up so he can’t go to the county fair. Wow, I wonder why your dog has depression? At least there’s a nice moment where he tells him he can try again next year (they will be on their hunting trip next year). But for now, Copper can only watch as Amos and Chief leave to have fun. Tod hops up onto his barrel to try to cheer him up. When it doesn’t work, Tod bites his collar clean off so they can go find his secret hidden talent. We’re off to the fair!\n\nCopper and Tod wander through the fair, awed at all the sights, sounds, smells, and rough CGI. A billboard for fireworks gets them all excited because dogs famously LOVE fireworks, and they promise to watch them together. And they lay it on so incredibly thick it would be more of a plot twist if they did end up watching them together. I know this movie’s aimed at small children but cmon. Kids aren’t this dumb. Sure enough, something happens seconds later! Copper hears the melodious howling again and runs off to see what it is, even though Tod’s not quite as impressed. And they find the Singing Strays, an all-dog country band, rehearsing for their big show!\n\nThe song might suggest they’re in harmony, but the relationship between two of the members is anything but harmonious. The lead singer, Dixie, trips on a loose board and flips out about being traumatized, because she might be a liiiitle bit of a drama queen. Her boyfriend and the band’s manager Cash tries to calm her down while the other singers, Waylon, Floyd, and Granny Rose take bets on who might win. It’s all very annoying and I don’t care about any of these characters but I will say, it’s clever that they’re all named after famous country stars: The Dixie Chicks, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Floyd Tillman, and Rose Maddox. That’s actually clever, but the Singin’ Strays lose all the points I just gave them with the stupid similies. Every other line out of these peoples’ mouths is some kind of down-home Southern aphorism and it’s as irritating as a mosquito buzzing around a quiet library.\n\nDixie just can’t believe Cash would take the loose board’s side and storms off, leaving the Singin’ Strays without a singer minutes before showtime. To make things worse, there’s a talent scout from the (human) Grand Ole Oprey coming, and they have to wow the crowd to get their big break. With no other options, Cash tasks Granny Rose with singing Dixie’s part, and their human owner/banjo player Lyle Snodgrass (named after Lyle Lovett) calls them out to the stage. By the way, you might be a redneck if you recognize Lyle’s voice because he’s Jeff Foxworthy. Because it’s 2006 and country humor was all the rage (if you don’t believe me, Cars came out this same year). The humans hear the performance as barking, but it’s so close to on-key that it’s impressive anyway.\n\nBut Tod and Copper are in the audience, too, and being canines themselves, they hear a full-on musical number. Copper’s completely enamored, but then Granny Rose hits a sour note. She’s not quite the belter Dixie is. But luckily, the show is saved when… Copper starts wailing random notes? Somehow this impresses Cash, who brings this random puppy on stage to finish the song with them. Copper somehow knows every word of this song and finishes up with them while the crowd goes wild. I can understand the humans applauding because awww puppy, but the dogs? The kid’s not even on key! This whole plot makes as much sense as a screen door on a submarine. Tod congratulates Copper on his hidden talent for singing (phrased like he’s surprised Copper’s good at something), and the Strays invite Copper to join them when he’s grown up and sounds like Kurt Russell. Because nothing bad happens when he’s grown up, right?\n\nDixie can’t believe her boyfriend would give her job to some random kid off the street, which is actually completely reasonable. Cash responds with some jabs about her age (nice, movie), and the two fly into the dumbest lovers’ spat I have ever heard. Dixie gets madder than a wet hen in a thunderstorm so she quits the band and locks herself in the tour bus. Cash comes back later to try to apologize, but Dixie slams the door in his face. At that exact moment, the talent scout, Winchell P. Bickerstaff, arrives and meets up with his tour guide, a Girl Scout named Olivia Farmer. She’s supposed to be showing him all the talent at the fair but keeps blithely leading him into a variety of comical injuries. It’s one of the better running gags in the film. Being played by Stephen Root (Office Space, Bubbles in Finding Nemo) helps.\n\nMeanwhile, Tod is having a grand old time on the carousel. Copper is not. Apparently, he gets motion sick. Also, there is no one on this ride besides these two random animals that just kinda rocked up, despite humans appearing in the background. So that’s weird. Desperate for a singer, Cash runs up to them to officially invite Copper to join the Singin’ Strays. Much to Tod’s chagrin, Copper happily accepts. He’s not going anywhere without his best friends but foxes sound like this so Tod can’t be in the band. Still, Cash won’t separate them (that would be madness), so he invites Tod to hang out backstage and do all their chores for them. Hooray. I would have thought that would be Lyle’s job. Anyway, Tod’s not so sure about this, but he won’t rain on Copper’s parade. How bad could it be?\n\nWith the opening filled, Cash goes back to fire Dixie for her diva behavior. She flips out, smashing up the tour bus and venting to her own entourage, Zelda the cat (named after Zelda Scott). Zelda has the attitude of a washed-up old lady who’s been smoking six packs a day since she was a fetus and it’s so relatable. She’s used to Dixie’s tantrums and doesn’t care about much of anything anymore. But this time, Dixie’s anger is righteous. She gave Cash everything and this is how he treats her? She watches from inside as the band welcomes Copper into the fold. Then Dixie gets an idea… a wonderful, awful idea…\n\nOutside, Cash introduces Copper to Waylon, Floyd, and Granny Rose. Only now does it occur to ask if Copper has an owner or not, because only strays are allowed in this band. Wait, what? None of you are strays! Lyle is your human! Not to mention that it comes off as this older adult asking a child if there’s anyone back home who would miss him. Ick. Tod cheerfully chirps that Copper’s obviously a stray because he’s not wearing a collar. Every single one of the Singin’ Strays is wearing a collar. Because they belong to Lyle. This is dumb as a cow playing checkers. But that’s all Cash needed to hear. He’s one of them now. Because the entertainment industry is famously such a great place for kids!\n\nBack at the fair, Amos and Chief strut their stuff, sporting another 4th place ribbon for being a hunting dog. They run into Widow Tweed, who’s entering her blueberry pies in the pie competition. He insults her because baking is a useless, traditionally feminine thing and calls her ‘woman’ again and this is irritating in the first one but now it’s infuriating because it’s 100% of his personality. At least it’s not ‘female’ I guess. It’s time for another performance of the Singin’ Strays, and Cash interrupts Tod and Copper chasing crickets again for a last-minute rehearsal. Tod’s not even allowed to watch, he has to stay back and clean their bowls. But as long as Copper remembers the fireworks, he doesn’t mind at all! Copper had better remember the fireworks. It sure would be terrible if Copper forgot the fireworks.\n\nBefore Copper gets to the stage, Dixie calls him back with an evil grin and some ‘advice’ from one performer to another. If he wants to get really good at singing, he has to eat a whole jar of peanut butter before every performance. Of course, it gets stuck to the roof of his mouth and we’re treated to a full minute of mouth-smacking noises. It is agony. Tod finds Copper struggling and rushes to fetch Abigail the cow, who just won the cow milking contest with Widow Tweed. Because peanut butter is actually super glue and squirting milk into his mouth is the only thing that can dissolve it. Don’t you know? Dixie lies to her former bandmates that Copper ran away with Tod, but Copper makes it right in the nick of time. Cash smells the peanut butter on him and knows that Dixie tried to sabotage them. But he’s spared the necessity of lecturing her because the same wooden board smacks her and knocks her out of the barn.\n\nNow Copper’s officially a Hound Dude! Cash takes him around the fair, dazzling him with big showbiz dreams and encouraging him not to let anything or anyone hold him back. Let me rephrase this: an older adult is isolating a child and telling him he has to abandon his friends and family. If these were humans this plot would never make it into a kids’ movie. And if you think I’m reading something gross that isn’t there, Copper tries to back away because he has to meet Tod before sunset for the fireworks, but Cash straight up tells him he doesn’t need Tod anymore, and Copper’s just like “okay!” Like, that’s not me reading into it, that’s the text. Anyway, Tod sees Cash take Copper up to the Ferris wheel to watch the fireworks, and his heart breaks.\n\nCopper says his goodnights to Cash, then runs into a very displeased Tod. Tod gets all jealous and mopey about Copper spending time with his other friends. The thing with Cash is super icky and yes they had plans but Tod, my guy, it’s been like two hours. Copper messed up but Tod is acting like a clingy weirdo. Besides that, this is so not the biggest challenge this friendship will face. Knowing how these two end up makes it pretty much impossible to care about any of this. Copper apologizes and the two start to make up, but before they can go play, Cash calls Copper in to rehearse. What. Now? You just rehearsed! Do dogs not have child labor laws?\n\nDixie watches the little snitfit from the window, snacking on a pile of dog biscuits until Zelda smacks them away so they don’t make her fat. Because I liked Zelda, so of course this movie has to ruin her for me. Thanks a lot. So Dixie heads outside to find Tod hard at work cleaning bowls while Lyle plays his banjo like there’s nothing weird about some random wildlife doing his dishes. Dixie sits down at a bench like it’s a bar and commiserates with Tod about being rejected by the dog she loves most. She projects her romance troubles onto these two young friends which… you know, is weird but you’re not exactly refuting my queer reading of the original movie. But then it devolves into this highly sexualized nightmare fuel of farm animals and neon lights and booty shaking and it’s sooo uncomfortable.\n\nAfter… that… Tod vents his frustrations to Dixie and lets slip that he lied about Copper being a stray. And if that’s not the opportunity Dixie needed! Meanwhile, the Singin’ Strays are not having a good time. Obsessed with impressing the talent scout, Cash works his band into the ground. Everyone is tired as a sloth navigating a marathon obstacle course, but Cash won’t let them rest. Copper gets distracted chasing a cricket, and Cash yells at him for not caring enough about becoming a star. Granny Rose steps in, defusing the situation and comforting Copper, because the life of a child star is no life at all. Just ask Corey Feldman. Now having second thoughts, Copper heads outside to find Tod, but he’s nowhere to be found. Neither is Dixie, so now Cash is sad. He reminisces on the good old days when he and Dixie were deeply in love. But hey, who needs relationships when you can have a grueling rehearsal schedule instead?\n\nIt’s long since gotten late, and Widow Tweed and Amos head outside to search for their missing pets. At first, they blame each other because these two do not get along. But Widow Tweed’s heart breaks at the thought of the puppy all alone and lost, and offers to keep an eye out. Amos grudgingly agrees to do the same for the fox. And you know what? This is actually a genuinely good scene. The animosity between them is still there, but they’re willing to put it aside and cooperate for their beloved pets. You can actually draw a line from this to Widow Tweed agreeing to put aside their differences and help Amos with his injured leg later.\n\nTod leads Dixie through the bushes back to Amos’s house to show where Copper lives. She devises a plan to lure Amos back to the fair and reunite Copper with his human, but she draws a blank at how to get Amos to follow. But Tod’s got that on lock – he just has to antagonize Chief. He messes with the sleeping hound until he wakes up because this worked so well in the first movie. Amos jumps into the wacky chase scene guns blazing, and he and Widow Tweed jump into their cars to follow Tod. Chief and Tod rip through the fair like a tornado in a china shop, breaking the Ferris wheel off its supports, sending it rolling over the tents, killing dozens, and scooping up Dixie on the way. Everyone rushes into the tent just as the Singin’ Strays are on and I swear when I say this is just the Rocky Horror Roll Call with Fox and the Hound I am not kidding. Everyone’s so aghast they can only say each others’ names and Copper’s cover is blown.\n\nIt’s the ultimate betrayal that Copper isn’t a stray, and Cash kicks Copper out of the band. Even though, once again, no one here is a stray. The rogue Ferris wheel lands Dixie nose to nose with Cash, and he just can’t believe she’d do something so awful and Dixie never meant any of this. But it doesn’t matter. Their big chance is ruined. Cash fires Copper, Copper goes home with Amos, Granny Rose, Waylon, and Floyd leave because Cash yelled at Copper, and Dixie and Tod feel terrible for what they’ve done. So everybody’s sadder than a forgotten umbrella on a rainy day. We get a sad montage of sadness complete with mood rain, and in a better movie lampshading the mood rain would be funny but this is not a good enough script to pull it off. Amos and Widow Tweed take their pets home, and the movie actually tries to copy the imagery from Goodbye May Seem Forever but… no, just no.\n\nThe mood rain ends and Dixie slinks over to Copper’s house to apologize for the mess she made. Tod didn’t do anything wrong, he just didn’t want to lose Copper’s friendship. That would be terrible. Can you imagine how terrible that would be? Copper goes across the street to apologize to Tod and they shake and make up, promising nothing will ever separate them again. Not ever. Ever again. Ever. Even better, Tod has a way of making the Singin’ Strays dreams of stardom come true after all! You see, the talent scout’s hat blew off during the sad rainstorm of sadness right onto Tod. Copper can use its scent to track the talent scout! And while he does that, Tod races off to fetch the Singin’ Strays.\n\nAfter all the trouble lying that Copper is a stray caused, Tod’s best idea for getting the band back together is… another lie. Awesome. Great. He tells Cash Dixie’s in trouble, then finds Dixie to tell her the same thing about Cash. Of course, they’re both fine, and the whole cast meets up in front of a 1960s-style diner that cropped up in the world of a movie that takes place in the late 20s/early 30s. You know what? I don’t care anymore and neither does anyone working on this movie. Dixie and Cash are relieved to see each other safe and sound, and the whole gang is in harmony for the first time all movie. Bickerstaff… can he hear them singing or is he just hearing howling? Either way, he drops his breakfast and declares that the Singin’ Strays are the perfect act for the (human) Grand Ole Oprey and takes Lyle to sign contracts and stuff. The band kisses and makes up and invites Copper to join them, but he won’t leave Tod. And the two run off through the countryside, never to acknowledge this weirdness again. And surely nothing will ever come between these two best friends ever again now that they’ve overcome the greatest hurdle they will ever face!\n\nHahahahha. Ha. Haaaa.\n\nThis movie is as messy as eating a bowl of grits with a fork. The premise is as outlandish as a goose riding a unicycle down Main Street on a Sunday afternoon. And other ridiculous expressions. There’s no reason for this to be a Fox and the Hound movie. In fact, it would probably actually make more sense if it wasn’t. The dog country band is still dumb, but with two original characters, it would be a mostly harmless kiddie flick. But as a Fox and the Hound movie it actually harms the powerful emotional message about childhood innocence, while also negating its own message about friendship because nothing here matters. Even if this little hiccup is tied up in a bow, we still end up with them trying to kill each other. So who cares? Who cares about any of this? It’s all totally inconsequential and exemplifies why people hate these direct-to-video sequels so much.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nTod takes more of a backseat here compared to the first movie. On some level this makes sense- he’s the main protagonist in the first one, so why not give some face time to our other title character? But in practice, it has the effect of turning him into a needy, whiny, attention seeker who can’t handle his friend spending two hours with someone else. Sure, the fireworks meant a lot to him, but his reaction is still overblown. And having the movie assert that Copper is in the wrong for… having other friends, hobbies, and obligations is not a great look. Jonah Bobo (Zathura, Crazy Stupid Love) does a good job of bringing across Tod’s mischievous, playful personality but the script does not.\n\nCopper gets a little more character development than in the original. He’s still obedient to a fault and goes along with whatever he’s told, which is consistent at least. Cash says we need to rehearse, we’ll rehearse all night. It should be satisfying to see him overcome that and stick up for his friendship with Tod, but because we know Amos will take this natural passivity to a terrifying place later it’s a nothing moment. He doesn’t learn. He doesn’t grow. He can’t. It’s a midquel. And they don’t even let Harrison Fahn do the roo-roo-roo howl and that’s terrible.\n\nDixie is just a recolored Georgette from Oliver and Company, and while Georgette is the best character in that movie, it doesn’t work here. That diva behavior is a heavy spice and they vastly overdo it here. It doesn’t help that she’s the only major female character (Granny Rose, Zelda, and Widow Tweed only get a few lines). And why is she so overtly sexualized? Every scene with her, especially her big song, focuses intently on her hindquarters, which the animators too great pains to show swaying and shaking and it’s eugh. I swear I’m not being a pervert for noticing, it’s a lot. I’m not entirely sure how they got country superstar Reba McEntire in this mess but she is nothing compared to the next voice actor.\n\nCash is voiced by Patrick Swayze, which has to be some kind of blackmail because there is no way the Dirty Dancing star had the time of his life doing this crap. He’s actually not bad for this being his first and only voice role, but that’s where all the budget went. Cash is supposed to be a fun-loving guy who takes fame too far, but the fact that the plot pretty much requires him to project that onto a child by straight up telling him he doesn’t need anyone from his old life is… hmm. That’s not a great look. That’s not a great look at all.\n\nMUSIC\n\nToday I learned that Joel McNeely, composer for several of the DisneyToon sequels including this, Jungle Book 2, and Return to Neverland, also wrote the score for Holes. The 2003 cinematic masterpiece Holes starring Shia Labeouff whose soundtrack I listened to religiously when I was eleven. I don’t know how I missed that the first two times but my mind is blown. Now, his work here isn’t quite as good as Holes, because few things are, but it’s nice. Lots of banjo, fiddle, and harmonica set a definitive time and place (which the visuals forget), and reprises of the songs from the film evoke emotion (which the script negates with how stupid the causes of said emotions are). I really liked his work on Jungle Book 2, and this might actually be a step up from that. But alas, few things can be Holes.\n\nFriends For Life is kind of a generic country-pop thing, which isn’t really my genre, but y’know, ‘s fine. I mean, other than the fact that anyone who’s seen the first movie knows that no, they’re not friends for life. That’s kind of the entire plot of the original movie. The lyrics are sweet but right off the bat they’re telling you that nothing we’re about to see is even tangentially related to the movie this is supposed to be a sequel for. Still, this was One Flew South’s first song, and it did get them a recording contract, so that’s got to count for something.\n\nWe’re In Harmony plays three times throughout the film: one introducing the Singin’ Strays, one at the end when Dixie rejoins the band, and one over the credits sung by Mannheim Steamroller’s Chip Davis. It takes the movie’s habit of speaking almost entirely in weird similes to an extreme that isn’t that bad in a song but when combined with the rest of the script it gets grating fast. Also, I’m really not sure how Copper’s off-key yowling got him into the band compared to Reba’s powerful belting. The version with Dixie is by far the most bearable. Davis’s is all right, but he pronounces that line “like a bass and a fiddle” like the fish bass instead of the instrument. And that’s terrible.\n\nHound Dude might rival W-I-L-D as the worst song ever to come out of a DisneyToon sequel. It’s not just because the whole thing with Cash telling Copper he’s the only one who can make him a star if he ditches Tod is super creepy, even though it totally is. The lyrics are just super cringy in general. It’s all just dog puns. So… many… dog puns. It also makes the baffling decision to start the song with Swayze, a perfectly talented singer, then one verse in switch to American Idol contestant Josh Gracin, who is also perfectly talented but who sounds nothing like Swayze. And they still animate Cash singing so it’s definitely not supposed to just be a non-diegetic background song. What gives?\n\nGood Doggie, No Bone isn’t actually as bad as the title implies, as long as you’re only listening to it. Reba’s voice is incredible, and she manages to carry a song about jilted love and a thankless relationship until it almost sounds like a radio song and not her projecting her issues onto a child. But that’s only the case as long as you’re only listening to it. The visuals are going to haunt my dreams for the rest of my life. There’s just… so much gyrating. “Why are there so many pig butts on my screen” is not a sentence I ever want in my notes. And then the candy colors from the fireworks give the whole thing the feeling of a bad acid trip. Not like the fun Pink Elephants on Parade kind but the kind where I have to watch farm animals twerking for several minutes. Please pass the brain bleach.\n\nBlue Beyond is our obligatory sad song. It’s pretty successfully divorced from the context in that the only thing it really has to do with the visuals is the feeling of sadness. I mean, the lyrics are basically about a romantic relationship, which as much as I stand by my thing where the original can apply to any kind of social division, is probably not the intention here. But Trisha Yearwood’s vocals are lovely all the same.\n\nWe Go Together is a nice companion piece to Friends For Life in that they tell the same story about a friendship that will never end. Ever. Never. It’s probably the better of the two in that it’s more upbeat and catchier, which probably has something to do with the fact that Little Big Town is a much bigger band than One Flew South. But this movie really needs to make up its mind whether the humans can hear the dogs sing or not. Having Widow Tweed bop along to the music really took me out of the movie.\n\nYou Know I Will tells exactly the same story as Friends For Life and We Go Together. They’re really laying it on thick that nothing is ever going to come between these two again, aren’t they? It’s like they don’t want us to remember that they do get separated. This is probably my favorite of the three songs because it sounds the least like a country song – I can respect the talent of people like Reba and Trisha Yearwood, it’s just not what I choose to listen to. Neither is High School Musical star Lucas Grabeel’s brand of Disney Channel bubblegum pop, for that matter, but it’s at least a little nostalgic.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nThis isn’t really saying much, but this movie looks much nicer than most other DisneyToon sequels. You can tell this was one of the last ones, and while it’s a little too polished to capture the wild beauty of the original movies even in the forest scenes, it’s still pleasant to look at. Not as impressionistic or beautiful, but I’ll take this over Cinderella 2. The character animation is smoother and cleaner, too, though it looks a little overpolished and the designs are way more anthropomorphized than the original so that’s really jarring.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWho was asking for this? Fox and the Hound has never been one of the more popular Disney properties, so for it to get a sequel alongside movies like Cinderella, Aladdin, and Little Mermaid is a wild choice. DisneyToon was really scraping the bottom of the barrel by the end of their run. In most of the other sequels, you can tell they at least watched the movie and tried to tell stories that could logically happen within that universe. Here they just completely disregarded everything that happened while desperately insisting everything turns out okay. It’s baffling. The original isn’t a favorite of mine anyway but this somehow made it so much worse. Skip this movie.\n\nFavorite scene: Gotta be the moment of understanding between Widow Tweed and Amos. In a plot that came completely out of left field, this was the only moment consistent with what was established in the original. And it was sweet, to boot."
