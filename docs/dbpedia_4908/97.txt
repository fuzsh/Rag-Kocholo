Young defender Jada Mawongo says he has benefitted hugely from Byron Anthony’s words of wisdom when appearing for Swansea City’s under-18s this season.

The under-16s centre-half enjoyed plenty of opportunities to step up and get valuable game time with the under-18s last term.

Rochdale-born Mawongo, who has been with the club since under-13 level, looked assured and produced encouraging performances when appearing in the heart of the young Swans’ defence.

A centre-half also capable of appearing at right-back, the 16-year-old has received helpful guidance from another former defender in Anthony.

The under-18s coach appeared for the likes of Bristol Rovers, Hereford and Newport during his playing career, making over 200 appearances and winning two promotions along the way.

And Mawongo has subsequently benefitted from Anthony’s experience during a season of significant progress in his young career.

“I’ve had a lot of minutes with the under-18s this season,” he said.

“That’s been a big help for me in my development.

“I’ve spent a lot of time with the coaches and it’s given me a lot of things to look forward to.

“Of course, Byron was a defender and he’s been massive for me.

“With all the experience he’s been through, his advice and guidance helps me a lot.”
