Justin Edinburgh admits he is not certain Newport County defender Byron Anthony will make a full recovery from his injury problems.

Anthony, 29, suffered a double leg break 12 months ago and has played just six games for the Exiles since then.

The former Wales Under-21 player is now struggling with a back problem and has not been involved this season.

"I think there's always a doubt in terms of the severity of the injury," Edinburgh said.

"There's no doubt that was a major trauma but we've got to remain positive. That's all you can do at this stage and hopefully we will get through it.

"We can't be 100% sure."

Anthony, who started his career at Cardiff City, joined Newport in November 2012.

He was part of the side which secured promotion to the Football League after a 2-0 Conference play-off final win over Wrexham in May 2013.

But Anthony suffered a double leg break during in Newport's Capital One Cup win over Brighton in August of the same year and did not return to action until February 2014.

"It's been a tough time for him but credit to him, he's a top class professional," Edinburgh added.

"He doesn't let it get him down and he continues to train and be thoroughly professional.

"Hopefully it won't be too long before he gets himself back fit and going again."

Meanwhile striker Rene Howe has had an operation on a thigh injury and could be out for the rest of the season.

County have not played since the 1-0 win at Portsmouth on 30 August because of the Nato summit in Newport.

They next play Cambridge United at home in League Two on 8 September.
