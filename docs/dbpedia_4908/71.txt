IN BRIEF

FORMER Cardiff City defender Byron Anthony is backing a tour to Malawi in September to raise the profile of youth development in the country.

Anthony, now with Bristol Rovers, told the Echo: “This is a great opportunity to put smiles on these kids’ faces and give something back.

to football as well as meet these wonderful people. “The tour is designed to give people the chance to experience this remarkable country and develop the game of football to a bigger audience. They want to listen and they want to learn and this project will promote that.”

Any profits made from the four-game tour, which starts on September 16, will go directly to fund the re-establishment of the National Primary School Football and Netball competitions in which over 80,000 Malawian primary school children participated when it was last held in 2008.
