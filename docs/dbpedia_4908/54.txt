Newport County defender Byron Anthony has retired from professional football.

Anthony, 30, has not fully recovered since suffering a double leg break during Newport's Capital One Cup win over Brighton in August 2013.

He played just six games after his return in February 2014, but has not featured this season and now takes up a coaching role with the club's academy.

"Unfortunately I have been unable to get back to the level I was at without getting pain," said Anthony.

The former Wales Under-21 player started his career at Cardiff City, scoring once in two League Cup appearances for the Bluebirds in 2005-06.

He signed for Bristol Rovers, making 191 appearances in all competitions and scored 10 goals for the Pirates.

Following a short spell at Hereford United, Anthony joined County in November 2012.

The defender was part of the side that secured promotion to the Football League after a 2-0 Conference play-off final win over Wrexham in May 2013.

"I've had an extremely good career and enjoyed my time in the game," said Anthony.

"Getting my home town club back into the Football League has been a highlight for me."

County manager Justin Edinburgh paid tribute to Anthony.

"Byron has been a great servant for this football club and it is with regret that we have to see him retire from the game," said Edinburgh.

"Byron will remain in and around the club by assisting in the academy with the Under-16s and Under-18s.

"It has been a long road to recovery for Byron, who has remained positive and professional throughout this time.

"I speak on behalf of everybody at the football club when thanking Byron for his commitment to his hometown club."

As for the future Anthony told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I'm doing my coaching badges... and I'd love to get into the media side of the game as well."
