        "text": "HARTLEPOOL are still searching for their first victory of the new League One season after Bristol Rovers came from behind to win at Victoria Park.\n\nPools took the lead through Denis Behan’s 31st minute header from a James Brown centre.\n\nBut they were pegged back eight minutes later when Aaron Lescott fired past Scott Flinders.\n\nAnd dangerman Jo Kuffour scored the match-winner on the stroke of half-time with a flashy turn and shot into the bottom corner after Stuart Campbell’s free-kick.\n\nBehan was twice a lick of paint away from a second half equaliser when he rattled a shot against the underside of the crossbar and struck the base of a post.\n\nBut Pools could not find a way back, leaving them with a point from their first three league games ahead of Saturday’s trip to Gillingham.\n\nPools made one change to the side which lost to Charlton, bringing in striker Brown for his first start of the season and dropping Adam Boyd to the bench.\n\nBrown has had a long rehab after suffering a second cruciate knee ligament injury but needed just nine minutes to serve a reminder of his quality.\n\nAntony Sweeney’s deft pass from inside his own half released the Cramlington-born forward, whose venomous shot forced Fraser Forster to palm the ball over his crossbar for a corner.\n\nBrown was not too far away again four minutes later when he sent a header over the top from Steve Haslam’s cross.\n\nPools keeper Flinders made his first save on 20 minutes from Jeff Hughes’ low shot after a swift Rovers counter attack.\n\nPools had a scare when Kuffour left Peter Hartley for dead to burst into the penalty area but skipper Sam Collins moved across to make a well-time block for a corner.\n\nBehan headed wide at the back post after a cross from Hartley on the half hour as Pools enjoyed a dominant spell of possession.\n\nAnd the Irishman rose unmarked a minute later to give them the lead with his first goal since his summer move from Cork, nodding in Brown’s chipped cross from 12 yards.\n\nPools were not content to sit on their lead and Behan fired well wide from afar before Sweeney brought a plunging save from Forster and Byron Anthony cleared the danger.\n\nAndy Monkhouse intercepted Anthony’s left-wing pass intended for Carl Regan and his low cross was just a whisker too far in front of Brown.\n\nBut Rovers were back level on 39 minutes, Lescott drilling home low when the ball fell to him after Gary Liddle had done well to block Kuffour’s shot.\n\nPools had an opportunity to regain the lead barely a minute later when Forster spread himself to save from Brown after Anthony failed to clear a long ball from Leon McSweeney.\n\nBut the visitors remained a live threat as they finished the opening period stronger and Flinders had to make a fingertip save to deny Kuffour.\n\nFormer Pools loan man Darryl Duffy was given time for a free volley from the resulting corner but tamely dragged wide.\n\nHaslam was booked for a foul and although Pools cleared their lines, they fell behind through Kuffour’s fantastic goal with the interval approaching.\n\nThe striker picked up possession 12 yards out and turned a posse of Pools players this way and that before firing left-footed into the bottom corner.\n\nPools lost Behan for several minutes at the start of the second half after a head clash but the Irishman was able to continue after treatment on the touchline.\n\nDuffy sneaked in through the back door for Rovers only to be blocked out by a combination of Liddle and Flinders.\n\nSweeney appealed for a penalty against former Pools defender Danny Coles for handball, then Behan smashed against the crossbar and drove low into the foot of Rovers' left upright.\n\nBristol had a series of minor scares in their own box as first McSweeney’s driven cross caused a hurried clearance and Jon-Andre Fredriksen’s follow-up also required a quick boot to safety.\n\nFredriksen was booked after complaining about what he thought was a fair challenge on Campbell.\n\nAnd Pools fans were incensed when Hughes scythed McSweeney down right in front of referee Karl Evans and the Lancashire official brandished a yellow card rather than a red.\n\nRovers threatened a breakaway third goal when substitute Andy Williams rounded Flinders, with Pools breathing a sigh of relief when he cut the ball across the face of goal after going wide.\n\nBrown made way for Boyd with eight minutes left and although McSweeney drew a save from Forster, Pools could not find a way back despite battling hard in five minutes of added time which featured some inconsistent calls from the referee.\n\nPOOLS: Flinders, Haslam, Collins, Liddle, Hartley, McSweeney (Foley 88), Sweeney, Fredriksen (Rowell 88), Monkhouse, Behan, Brown (Boyd 82). Unused subs: Cook, Austin, Power.\n\nBRISTOL ROVERS: Forster, Regan, Lines, Coles, Campbell, Duffy (Williams 78), Hughes, Pipe (Blizzard 90+5), Anthony, Kuffour, Lescott. Unused subs: Phillips, Reece, Swallow, Rigg, Hunt.\n\nReferee: Karl Evans (Lancashire)\n\nAttendance: 3,137"
