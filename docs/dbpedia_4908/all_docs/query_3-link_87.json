        "text": "Now's your chance to let the world know you support the best team in Lincolnshire! Many other team pages have a list of their supporters on the Net so let's have a go at our own.\n\nI have now introduced an anti-spam measure. Some nasty people out there have created computer programs that automatically search web pages for e-mail addresses. They use the addresses they find to spew out junk mail. So to disguise your e-mail addresses I have replaced the @ symbol by a # and the . by a +. Because you are all intelligent people, you should be able to get back to the real address fairly easily so you can get in touch with your friends, and it should help to cut down on the spam e-mails you receive.\n\nWe are up to 686 fans on-line at present.\n\nHow far away is our furthest supporter? (Currently Charlie Blakey in Dunedin, New Zealand - 11,779 miles away)\n\nWill you find that long lost friend?\n\nWill the Lincolnshire Standard write an article about us? (Yes! See page 7 of the 13th November 1997 edition)\n\nIf you want to add your name to the list then sign up here.\n\nRecent Additions / Amendments\n\nJane Hoyes, Ian Hunt, Mark Isaac, David Lee Chi Kin, Elliott Lowe, David Mitchell, Ella Moody, Bethany Rayner.\n\nThe List\n\nLes Aaron (drlesaaron#yahoo+com) How do. My name's Les and I live in the Antartic - does that make me the furthest away Utd fan? (No, it's only 9872 miles to the South Pole from York Street, just head south and keep going! - KF). I'm currently doing research into the melting of the polar ice caps. I don't get to see many matches as you might imagine, but I follow the team from the website. Best of luck to the team and let's hope division 2 welcomes us next year - YELLOWS!!!\n\nRupert Abbott (winkle_no1#yahoo+com) Greetings to all you Boston Utd fans out there. My name's Rupert, more commonly known as 'Winkle'. I am a 25 year old resident of Boston and spend most of my time (when not watching Boston Utd), pickling eggs and updating my family tree, as well as working part time as a Shaolin monk. My favourite players are Paul Ellender and Daryl Clare. Best of luck to the team for the end of the season and let's hope we can fend off the (Dirty!!) Daggers, to win the Conference league title. P.S. If you are reading this and are the nice girl who works in the refreshment stall in the Finnforest stand, please drop me a line.\n\nAlbert Abcock (albert#jinglyjangly+co+uk) Hiya all, Boston United is my life! I have just recently painted my outside lavvy in the Pilrim's colours. My 6 month old daughter is call Claire, my dog Evans and I have a wonderfull collection of hard boiled eggs painted with the faces of the Boston players: Paul Bastock looks the best but Charlery has been scrambled! I go to all the home games and you can see me near the players tunnel each time because everywhere else is too noisey because of all the shouting! COME ON BOSTON!\n\nPaul Adams (pjadams#onenet+au) I live in Perth, Western Australia. In 1967 my parents came to Australia from Boston. My Dad played in goal for United reserves in the 1950s, his name is John Adams. I last saw United play in 1975 when we came for a family holiday, the game was a two all draw against Great Harwood! I still have family in Boston and keep in touch with them.\n\nEdward Addis (edwardinbed#hotmail+com) I am 16 years of age and I like playing football as well as watching it.\n\nDawn Addison (Paul#PMasterman+fsnet+co+uk) I started watching Boston about 2 years ago, when my boyfriend Paul got me into them. He's got me hooked and I'm nearly as big a fan as him. I go to every home game and a few away games too. My fave player is Mark Rawle.\n\nRich Addison (steve.addison#btinternet+com) I followed my sister Dawn into supporting The Pilgrims and now I think they are the best. Grantham suck!!\n\nLiam Addlesee (addlesee#madhouse+com) I am 12 years old, although I was born in Luton I have followed the Pilgrims through rain or shine since I was born. My favorite player is Bazza. I am a Townender and on Saturday afternoons my hobby is plastering Boston stickers all over away grounds, and I hate Granfum as much as I luv Boston!\n\nMarc Addlesee (addlesee#madhouse+com) I live in Dunstable, Beds. I am 10 years old. I follow BOSTON all over the country. I play football for Luton Town centre of excellence but one day I hope to play for Boston. When I was 4 years old I was Boston's mascot when they played Macclesfield at home. My gran and grandad live near Boston and my dad was born there and they are United supporters.\n\nStig Aksnes (joergenvaag#hotmail+com) I am the biggest Pilgrims` Fan up here where the polar bears live. I am freezing my butt up here. I`ll say the Pilgrims will win the Champions Leage in five years. Greetings from Norway. We love you. Keep up the good work.\n\nJez Albert (flightdeck+fares#going-places+co+uk) Always fond of Boston United since the FA Trophy final of 85 v Wealdstone.\n\nTim Allen (tim+a+allen#uk+pwcglobal+com) I was extremely lucky in the fact that I was born in Boston 24 years ago. Alas I now live in London but obviously frequently return to Boston to sample the internationally renowned nightlife and to the Mecca of football, York Street to watch the sensational pilgrims. Have seen a few of the matches this season and surely if we continue like this then league football beckons!\n\nDale Allitt (dale#allitt+freeserve+co+uk) I was born in Boston and although I moved to Nottingham I continued to support the Pilgrims. Since moving back to the area I have tried to get to as many games as possible. After a couple of season finishing second this must be the one where we get promoted don't you all agree?\n\nAlan Anderson (shalan#uk+packardbell+org) I am 32 years old, married with two children. I moved from Scotland to Kirton two years ago after leaving the army. I work for Geest in Spalding. I went to my first Boston match just after Steve took over, and haven't missed a game since then.\n\nJack Anderson (jon.anderson7869#freeserve+net) I am not even two years old yet but I will soon be at York Street to cheer on the boys. I will be standing with my dad and papa.\n\nJon Anderson (jon.anderson7065#freeserve+net) I have followed Boston for a few years now, even though I live down south I get to as many home games as possible and stand in the famous TOWNEND with me dad. COME ON UNITED. BOSTON UNITED. BOSTON UNITED.\n\nScott Ansley (phatuuk#hotmail+com) Hi! I'm a 16 yr old Pilgrims' fan from Rotherham. I have followed them since I was 12 due to my grandad supporting them. I've only ever been to one match though which was against Doncaster Rovers at Doncaster in which boston won.... I hope Boston carry on their success and head into Division 3.\n\nSteve Appleyard (srapple#tiscali+co+uk) I am a 35yr old football fanatic. I am married with 2 children aged 7 & 3. I work in the garage trade in Boston and attend as many home games as I can with my 8 yr old daughter. Hope to see Division 3 football at York Street one day.\n\nLaura Appleyard (srapple#tiscali+co+uk) I really like Daryl Clare and Bazza and wish them luck this season. Hope to see our boss back soon. I am 8 years old and love Boston and Leeds and I hope we stay at York Street and bring back more silverware. I also love S Club and Looking in the Mirror.\n\nAlison Arbon (ali2001vg#hotmail+com) I have been a fan of Boston Utd for about 6 years. Years ago my mum went to see them at Wembley. My mate works in Boston and goes to the matches.\n\nDaniel Ashton (palada#ashlea44+freeserve+co+uk) My dad goes to see the Pilgrims every home game, I'm only 3 so I'm a bit too young to go to a full game, but mum takes me to York Street to see the last 10 minutes of play while we wait for dad. I can understand the game a little, the men in yellow are Boston 'cos dad has told me to shout \"come on you yellows\" and I'm not sure why the supporters insist on calling the man in black rude names, but mum said that it will all become clearer as I get older, whatever that means! Good luck to Steve and the boys for a memorable first season back in the Conference and hopefully Division 3 in the near future!\n\nDaz Auty (dauty#pcpro-gb+de) I've lived in Boston since I was 12 and have watched and supported Boston Utd since then. I went to school at Kitwood boys and left at 16 to join the army. After training I was posted to Germany and I have been in Menden Dortmund and now Paderborn since 1987. Within that period I've been to Cyprus twice and Northern Ireland once, all 6 month tours. In July I'm due to be posted back to the UK to be a sergeant instructer in Bovington, Dorset. I'm married with 3 kids - 2 girls and boy. My son Jay was born on 01/01/2000 and he will be an avid Boston supporter like myself. When I am on leave I always watch them and take my 5 year old daughter Tara with me. I know Andrew Stanhope very well - it's a Wigtoft thing. Up the Pilgrims.\n\nDavid Avison (mavison#lineone+net) I'm a Lincoln City And Pilgrims fan From Woodhall Spa.\n\nNeil Avison (boston#ic24+net) I have been a Pilgrims fan for 30 years now, and over the years have seen some good players (and some awful). Steve Evans has got a good squad together so Conference beware.\n\nAdrian Baily (Abaily#aol+com) I was born and raised in Boston, where most of my family still live. I was an avid Pilgrims fan until I left to go to college at Coventry in 1988. I then moved to Bristol (129 miles from York Street as the Martin Hardy clearance flies) where I still live. While temporarily working on a development project in Seattle, Washington USA, I found the site invaluable in keeping up-to-date with United news. I also found an old friend of mine living in Boston, Massachusetts via the site and was able to meet up for lunch.\n\nLeah Bailey (Leah+Bailey#btinternet+com) I have liked Boston properly since Joby joined. Although I have followed the results for a while (along with Grantham and Billinghay Athletic!) I'm 15. I live in Billinghay. Lincoln City are good too.\n\nMatt Bailey (v2k#supanet+com) I am fan of the Pilgrims, and always will be. Come on lads, keep up the good work. We can get to the Football league and teach them how to play proper football. Bring it home Boys! If we move stadium make sure the Town End is rebuilt!\n\nDaz Bain (daz+kate#ic24+net) I have been a Pilgrims supporter for 18 Years - I stood at the Townend when there was only a dozen or so in the early eighties. Memorable games - all leading up to the Wembley final especially Blyth at home, Sheffield Utd and Bury in the Cup.\n\nMike Bain (mikebain#excite+co+uk) Born in Boston in '43 and educated at Park Rd Sch and the Grammar Sch. A regular Pilgrims home supporter - (even went to White Hart Lane and the Baseball ground for the cup games) before leaving the area in '58. Currently married with grown-up family and in business in Runcorn, Cheshire. Looking forward to seeing United at Chester City next season!\n\nDave Baines (dwb#dcs+ed+ac+uk) Born and raised in Boston, I was a regular at York Street from the 67/68 to 74/75 seasons. I left to go to University in London and then moved up to Edinburgh (241 miles from York Street) about 14 years ago so I've not seen many games in recent years.\n\nJudie Baines-Dinning (RABBD#aol+com) I have been a Boston Utd fan since I was 11 years old (a long time). I moved away from Boston when I was 17 yrs old but have now moved back to Lincolnshire and live not far away, in Bourne. So I bring my 11 yr old daughter Alys, to the matches whenever I can. Living in a house full of Arsenal fans we put up with a lot of stick but still love The Pilgrims the best.\n\nJason Bains (jason+bains#virgin+net) I have lived in the area all my life, first at Splisby now Old Leake. Played local and Lincolnshire league football for Spilsby since I left school and have always followed the Pilgrims. This season I have only missed a couple of home games and made the trip to Dagenham the other night. Next season I intend to buy a season ticket even if we are not promoted.\n\nSue Baker (jackiesue22#netscapeonline+co+uk) When I lived in Boston I used to go to as many matches as possible, now that I am living in London it is obviously more difficult. However I always listen to the results on Saturdays to see how they are doing and I'm looking forward to going to see them when they play teams in our area this season.\n\nBesmir Bala (besmir1#yahoo+com) I'm a 17 year old student and I also support Arsenal.\n\nSimon Balsom (balsom#qualitynet+net) Now living in Kuwait (you may have heard of it), I became a fan in the late 70's in the days of Jim Kabia et al. Didn't we think they'd go up every year!? Best match: when we came back from 0-2 to beat Wigan 4-2. Best moment: when Gerry Stewart (gk) scored from a free kick in our half! I have educated the guys out here, and there is some respect for the Pilgrims around the poolside out in Kuwait! The only match I'll see this season will be on Boxing Day vs. York City. It will be a first football match for my 4 year old son, Oliver, and also for my 72 year old Dad, Jim. What a day it will be! Will I get the Replica Shirts in time?\n\nLouise Barber (barber#newyork97+freeserve+co+uk) I have followed Boston United for some time now, and hope they have every success in the future, hopefully resulting in promotion from the Doc Martens!!\n\nMartyn Barber (GB805830#ntu+ac+uk) I've supported the Pilgrims for about 5 years now. I now go to University in Nottingham but I come back to watch as many matches as possible. Good luck for next season lads!!!\n\nLinda Barclay (aka krazy keeper) (krazykeeper#goalkeepers-uk+com) I am the proud sponsor of the Fans page on the impressive Pilgrims web site. Contact us above and let us help you save money on goalkeeping equipment etc.\n\nJez Barham (jezbarham#btopenworld+com) I'm 14 and I have just started to support Boston Utd. I really hope we are going to clinch promotion to Division 3.\n\nSteven Barker (s+barker-96#student+lut+ac+uk) My family are all from Boston, and I was born there, although I now live in Woodhall Spa (14 miles from York Street) and go to university in Loughborough. I have to admit that my first team is actually Man Utd, though I've been watching Boston since the age of five.\n\nAndy Barlow (andy#boston7+freeserve+co+uk) I first went to York Street when I was eleven and ever since have been a firm supporter. Hopefully I will be part of the BUFC quiz team to be entered in the Boston and District 1999/2000 quiz league so watch this space.\n\nRob Barnard (brian+barnard#tesco+net) Me and Stephen Wood have been to every home game in the 2001-2002 season. We went to see 5 away games and we are proud to support Boston United as we'd rather be a Pilgrim than an Imp.\n\nTara Barnett (labarnett#btinternet+com) I have supported Boston for 11 years now and I am the ball girl for them, which I really love doing. I just thought I would say a great bid good luck to Steve Evans and to all the players at Boston United. GOOD LUCK!\n\nKevin Barney (kevinb#revolutionsoccer+net) I am from Boston, Massachusetts, USA and I am also a Boston United Fan.

Following United team mainly through the web, but am going to try and make it over to a match this year!\n\nNick Barsley (nick#pmfmez+com) I am 19 and I have supported Boston United for eight years. I'm happy to see Boston finally get into the Football League.\n\nGeoffrey Barta (jbarta#holly+colostate+edu) Hello, my name is Geoff and I am from Fort Collins, Colorado USA were I attend Colorado State University. I have been passionate about soccer for as long as I can remember but it was not until World Cup '98 that I discovered the greatness of the English game. I have been following English football ever since and about midway through last season I stumbled upon The Pilgrims over the internet, and was thrilled by their championship season. Now I am hooked on the Pilgrims, and looking forward to seeing them in the Football League!\n\nCara Barwick (luke+gauntlett#virgin+net) Been a keen fan for three seasons. Being a young lady I enjoy the combination of sport and young men!\n\nCraig Barwick (luke+gauntlett#virgin+net) Started to support the Pilgrims when I played against the U 11 juniors before the 97/98 home game against Lancaster. I now go to as many games as possible.\n\nPaul Bastock (baz#thebastocks+freeserve+co+uk) Yes it's me. Bazza - Boston's number one keeper & fan. Keep up the great support, we all really appreciate you all behind us.\n\nIan Bates (Ianbates#easicom+com) Supporter of the other great team in gold & black. Moved to Boston in 1991, Townender ever since. Proud sponsor of Steve \"GOD\" Evans kit for this season.\n\nChris Battle (chris+18battle#talk21+com) I live in Boston. I know Bazza because I was working with him at one time at a nursing home. And I love Boston United.\n\nAndy Beal (ajbeal#supanet+com) I currently live in Peterborough, but have followed United from around the world. I run my own club now P & T Panthers in the Junior alliance league here in Peterborough so I can't follow Boston as often as I would like. Married with five kids of whom all, apart from the wife support United. Attended Kitwood Boys School between 73 and 78 so anybody who remembers please get in touch.\n\nKevin Beard (kevbeard#4unet+co+uk) I live in Wainfleet and work for Batemans Brewery. Although I am originally from Liverpool and support Everton I have been to most of Boston United's home games for the last ten years, which nearly makes me a true supporter. Good luck to the Pilgrims in the future!\n\nNathan Bee (jbee118#aol+co+uk) I am 10 years old. My hobbies are banger racing, football and playing on my playstation. I go to all the home games and we try to get to away matches as often as we can.\n\nCraig Bell (cragzybell17#hotmail+com) I love comin' to watch the lads - standing in the town end and singing my heart out with my mates. It's great - especially when we are top of the league! You better believe it! My favourite players for the Pilgrims are Anthony 'eldinio' Elding and BIG BALD BAZZA!!!!!\n\nIsaac Bell (iky1966#hotmail+com) I am a farmer from Boston area who watches Boston when ever I get the chance.\n\nKelvin Bell (dieselboy66#hotmail+com) I moved from Boston 13 years ago to live in Newcastle upon Tyne but I've never stopped following the Pilgrims.\n\nTed Benton (swbenton#aol+com) I'm eleven years old and I go to The Giles School. I've supported the Pilgrims for five years now. I play for Boston Juniors and I play in defence. My two favourite players are Simon Weatherstone and now Stuart Douglas.\n\nAdam Berry (bezaberry#simpsons+com) I am 13 and I live in Coningsby.\n\nJonathan Berry (Berry#netscapeonline+co+uk) I'm fifteen years old and live for United. I only missed two games last season. Favourite players: Bastock, De Souza and Rennie. I, like many other United supporters, think that Steve Evans is GOD! We will win the Conference even if it takes us a couple of seasons.\n\nJan-Willem Besuijen (w+j+besuijen#kub+nl) Hello Pilgrims' fans! I like little (no offence!) English football clubs, because they play the real football. That's why I visited this great site. Something about myself: I am 21 years old and I support Willem II, the best Dutch league side. I live in Tilburg and I am at Tilburg University to study Arts. I hope it will be a fantastic season for Boston, ze hebben een speciaal plekje in mijn hart (they have a special place in my heart).\n\nRay and Cheryl Bilbie (raybilbie#hotmail+com) We are from Nottingham and our home side is Forest but we like to watch grass roots football, so on Sat 6th Oct we came to watch the Pilgrims v Scarborough. We were impressed by the facilities at York St, there are worse grounds in the Football League. The fans were great and the team look promising. We went in the supporters' bar and watched the England game on the big screen. The people of Boston made us so welcome that we will be regular visitors to the club in the future. GOOD LUCK BOSTON!\n\nAndy Birkett (stuart#birkettbur+freeserve+co+uk) I'm now a hardy Yorkshire lad, but was born in Boston and lived there for 18 years. I've been following the boys in amber and black for about 5 years now, and I'm convinced 99/2000 is THE season. It's good to get back to Boston and see the Pilgrims play, as I get more than a little tired of hearing about Leeds and Bradford City... it makes a change to see some real quality!\n\nKatherine Birkett (stuart#birkettbur+freeserve+co+uk) Sister of Andy and Philip on this page. I am a fairly new fan of the Pilgrims. I hope one day (soon) to see Boston in the Conference and then after that, who knows? Good luck Boston, this season and forever!\n\nPhil Birkett (stuart#birkettbur+freeserve+co+uk) I've lived in Boston all my life and have been cheering the Pilgrims on since the 96/97 season. Brother of Andy (also listed here), he took me to my first game: the home defeat against Barrow. I've never looked back. To the Conference and beyond!\n\nMartyn Bishop (Martyn.Bishop#btinternet+com) I'm a Bostonian by birth and have supported Utd (on and off) since watching them as a 9 year old with my dad in 1958. I now watch them with my 2 sons (3rd generation supporters!) who are following on in the family tradition.\n\nNick Bishop (nickbishop#lycos+co+uk) I've supported the Pilgrims since the age of about 9, when my dad took me to York street for the first time. In the 2000/2001 season I attended every home game and a handful of away games. However, this season I've been unable to attend the majority of games due to me being away at uni. Will always follow the Pilgrims and keep sporting the shirt where ever I go. Sing your hearts for the lads!!!\n\nNathan Black (nab92721#yahoo+com) Hello out there! I was born in Boston and have lived there most of my life. University finally dragged me away, but I have now returned to Boston. I live a street away from the ground and now work for the Boston Standard as a reporter. Up the Pilgrims!\n\nAdy Blackamore (ablackamore#aol+com) I was born in Boston went to Tower Road then Kittwood Boys. I used to go and watch Boston in my teenage years, even sneaked in over the Gliderdrome many times. Then shortly after Wembley stopped going. A few months ago I started to watch THE PILGRIMS again with my 6 year old son Macaulay and I must say I was impressed and carried on going. I was there to see history in the making at Hayes (was you) and enjoyed every minute of it even the rain. What a day out. JUST GOT TO SAY WELL DONE TO THE BOYS AND THE MAIN MAN STEVIE EVANS YOU'VE DONE BOSTON PROUD. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. Me and my boy are proud to stand at the town end and sing our hearts out for the lads. You can count on our support. One more thing, see you daggers, you're not even in our league. Cheer up Gary Hill, what can it mean (YOU KNOW THE REST LADS).\n\nIan Blackamore (KAZZIAN#kbarnett+fsbusiness+co+uk) Boston born and bred, first went with my Dad to York St in the fifties, watched them again in West Midland League, NPL, Alliance etc. Lost faith in the late eighties, with a series of poor managers the club seemed to lack ambition. Returned when I thought, first Mel Sterland then Greg Fee was the man, but now I know, Steve Evans, he's 'The Man'. Happy memory, Portsmouth in the F.A. Cup, despite losing, getting evicted from the ground and having to get back in, a great day, helped \"T-Rex\" roadies to take gear into Gliderdrome and got free tickets. Now stand with my son behind Skull and Crossbones flag.\n\nJustin Blackamore (KAZZIAN#kbarnett+fsbusiness+co+uk) I am 14 years old and go to the Giles School. I have supported Boston Utd for around 4 years now. I go to all the home games and have watched them away several times. I like to stand in the Town End, usually with my Dad, with my skull and crossbones flag. I hope one day to see the \"Pilgrims\" in the Football League.\n\nSimon Blackburn (simonjblackburn#another+com) I live in Nottingham and I support Boston United and Nottingham Forest! My favourite player is \"Bazza\".\n\nCharlie Blakey (alfandcharlie#clear+net+nz) Moved to New Zealand in 1996 and live in Dunedin in the South Island (11779 miles from York Street). Have followed the Pilgrims since I was 10 in the days of Kevin Hector & Co. I might have to lay claim to the remotest fan award. Best moment was Bob Lee's goal against Altrincham which took us to the FA Trophy final in 1985.\n\nColin Bland (colin#fastlane+screaming+net) I was born in Boston in 1951. I attended Staniland School and Boston Grammar School. I have been a lifelong supporter despite moving away from the area. I fondly remember the FA Cup game against Derby when United drew at the Baseball Ground - shame about the replay!\n\nAdrian Blow (damienblow#aol+com) I have supported Boston through thick an thin since I was six years old. I attend all home matches and think that Steve Evans has turned my club around. I expect to consolidate this season, although League football remains my dream. Come on you Pilgrims!\n\nChris Bogg (boggyc#uboot+co+uk) I'm 14 years old and I come and watch the home games every Saturday. My favourite player is Ken Charlery.\n\nMark Bogg (boggyc#uboot+co+uk) I have been watching the Pilgrims for 2 years and I come to watch them on Saturdays when they are playing at home. My favourite player is Jim Dick.\n\nThomas Bogg (Thomas.Bogg#bostongrammar+lincs+sch+uk) I am 11 years old. I have been coming for three years. My favourite player is Daryl Clare.\n\nScott Bolton (scott+bolton#bt+com) I was born in Pilgrim Hospital 16th October 1977 and I have been following the Pilgrims ever since, even though I now live in Warrington Cheshire and have done since I was two.\n\nChris Bond (smoothoperater#aol+co+uk) Hi fellow Bostonians, CJ here and a proud Bostonian. Just wanna say that I have nothing but love and admiration for Stevey Evans and Division 3 awaits us! C'mon u Pilgrims!\n\nShaun Bond (shaun007#talk21+com) I am 29, single and have been a fan of Boston United F.C. all my life. I live in Winthorpe near Skegness and go to all the games at York street. Up the pilgrims!\n\nKev Booth (kev#skeg7+freeserve+co+uk) Born in Skegness, support Nottingham Forest as well as The Pilgrims....\n\nTracy Boulton (10046341#ehche+ac+uk) I have been a Boston supporter since I was four and I have been watching the matches with my dad ever since. I was even the mascot when I was 10! I am now at a university just outside Liverpool and I also support Liverpool F.C.\n\nLesley Bowen (LABowen#aol+com) Born in Boston in 1961 (nee Carter). I was a regular visitor to York St in the seventies before going to Trent Poly to do my degree. I now live in Ware, Herts (82 miles from York Street) with husband Nigel and daughter Julia and work in Harlow, Essex.\n\nGraham Boyall (graham#dboyall+freeserve+co+uk) I am originally from Spilsby but until recently was living in Chippenham in Wiltshire. I am now living near Newark and so I can get over to Boston much more often. I try and see as amny games as I can and I really enjoy this web-site.\n\nJoe Bradbury (bradbury#hbradbury+freeserve+co+uk) I've seen Boston on both good days and very bad days. I go with my cousin Callum Bates and my grandad (still very young always walking the whole mile to the ground and he sometimes beats me home). Callum plays football sometimes with Andy Stanhope who is related distantly to me. My favourite players are Rawle, Appleby (who I live near) and Joby.\n\nTim Bradbury (tim_brad#yahoo+com) Currently in Atlanta USA (4172 miles from York Street - Seattle was too far from York Street). Followed last year's Championship run through this page and clippings sent from the Lincolnshire Standard. Evans seems like an ambitious manager who can back up that ambition. Let's hope a long overdue visit to the Football League is around the corner. I drove Nigel Harvey to the away leg of his favourite game in a Capri that was the same colour as this web page. So come on NIG drop me a line. I tried your email but got no response.\n\nKeith Bradshaw (kdb_016#yahoo+com) I was born in Boston and moved away in 75 to join the air force but before then I used to go to see the games with my old man Jack who is still a season ticket holder going to all games. As for me, well claim to fame was being a ball boy when Jim Smith was around and Howard Wilkinson and even now I stun those boring conversations about premier football by telling them of our 6-1 win aginst a 1st div team. I see how they're getting on and in fact my son has been more times than me and he's in Norwich.\n\nNeil Bradshaw (neilbradshaw#student+ccn+ac+uk) I study animal care at the moment. When I visit Boston I always see my grandad he always gives me a chance to go to York Street and my dad asks me if I want to go to Old Trafford to watch UNITED! I really turned them down, that's Man United of course. You know why? Because I'm mad about BOSTON UNITED. Oh and Liverpool. Paul bastock keep those goals out and dont retire, you are the best!\n\nReg Brain (reginald.brain#virgin+net) Long time follower, home and away, non barracker, I've made many good friends, with the Pilgrims. I'm now 56 years old and I would like to see us return to Wembley, win,... and going back up to the Conference would be the icing on the cake. I live at a village called Wickersley in South Yorks.\n\nHarriet Brewitt (andrew63#lineone+net) I am ten years old. My favourite players are Jamie Cook and Ross Weatherstone and I love coming to see The Pilgrims Home and Away!\n\nLee Britchford (lbritchford#yahoo+com) I'm a dedicated Boston supporter who only missed two home matches in the 2000/1 season, and I have the full kit. I'm a Townend faithful. I have brown hair, blue eyes and my favourite player is Simon Weatherstone.\n\nPete Brooksbank (petebrooksbank#hotmail+com) I saw my first Boston game on my 11th birthday. They lost. I also support baseball's Cleveland Indians, meaning sporting heartbreak is certain for the rest of my life.....\n\nGeoff Broomhall (xdjmaster#hotmail+com) I have followed the Pilgrims from afar having lived in Gainsborough for a couple of years. I come from Birmingham. I am a season ticket holder at the Villa but always look out for your result. Congrats on saying in the League. You fans deserve it. All the best for next season.\n\nMatthew Broughton (dawn#broughton+freeserve+co+uk) I am 12 years old and I love the team Boston United. I have just only recently been supporting the Pilgrims but I am trying to attend all the matches I can but I am struggling a bit because I live in Grimsby. We're going into the football league.\n\nGuy Brown (charlie_downunda#hotmail+com) I'm from Melbourne, Australia (10465 miles from York Street) and have only recently begun following Boston due to my good friend 'Cookie' from the Town End. I spent about 5 months living in Sth. Yorks and Lincs 2 years ago and am dying to get back to go to some REAL games of FOOTBALL. Well Cookie, there ya go!!!! I signed on!!!!\n\nJamie Brown (brownmarvel#aol+com) I have always been a Boston United supporter. I am a season ticket holder and attend away days as much as I can. I live, love, and breath BOSTON UNITED (ask my poor missus). Saturday is UNITED DAY!\n\nStephen Bryson (stephen.bryson#virgin+net) I moved to Boston in 76 from Newcastle and lived there for about 13 years. The best times I had at York Street were after discovering you could climb over the Gliderdrome roof and get in for nothing !!!!!. Haven't seen them play for quite some time now though, but still get the Standard sent to me so that I can keep up to date on all the news.\n\nDavid Buck (y2jchrisjrch#netscapeonline+co+uk) I have supported United for about six years. I go to every home game. I have just been to my first away game this season (2000-2001), but I plan to go to every game the Pilgrims play next season. I am 13 years old and I live in Skegness. I think we have a bright future at York Street. We should be playing League football in about two years.\n\nPaul Buffham (paul#buffham34+fsnet+co+uk) Up the mighty PILGRIMS - there is no doubt that we will have six easy points from Lincoln next year!\n\nMatthew Bunn (bunnsp#aol+com) I go to Chesnut Street School in Ruskington. I am 9 years old. I play football for the LFA in Boston. I thought the best match last year was when Boston beat Morecambe in the FA Cup.\n\nSimon Bunting (simon#buno+freeserve+co+uk) Some of you might know me. I'm the Simon that drives the Boston United team coach. Just thought that I would sign on and give my support to the team I've come to support.\n\nMichael Burgess (nicksyl#uk.packardbell.org) I've been a supporter for 15 years and I'm looking forward to Conference football next season. I'm 23 years old and a care worker. I go to all home and some away games.\n\nMurray Burgess (rosiepam#aol+com) My Grandpa's the Chairman and I have been to see United play plenty of times. I have been a mascot as well. I love Boston.\n\nLee Burman (lee#leedoc+netlineuk+net) I have supported The Pilgrims since the late 1970's and am now the club doctor. Let's all get behind the team and support them back into the Conference.\n\nDavid Burr (daburr#lineone+net) I've been a United fan for three years (although I used to go to watch them when I was 8 years old as well!) and think that Steve Evans is doing a good job as manager. Can't wait to go to Dagenham on 4th March. Who needs Ken Charlery!\n\nGaz Burr (gaz#lincolnrule+freeserve+co+uk) I'm a Lincoln fan but was born in Boston, isn't that amazing! I hope Boston do well. Up the Imps. Up the Pilgrims.\n\nDavid Burt (DBurt76471#aol+com) I'm a typical Boston born fan, I currently live in Boston and like to follow the Pilgrims as much as I can. If anyone wants to get in contact with me to talk \"United\" then you're more than welcome.\n\nBrian Burton (EFCSOUL#tinyworld+co+uk) As well as following the Pilgrims, I am also a fanatical Evertonian. I usually stand on the Spayne Road stand with drinking partners Big Jim and Ronnie the Jock. Best days - away at Rushden this season and Moseley away many years ago.\n\nColin Burton (Colin.Burton#Culture+gov+uk) Swineshead exile. A poor civil servant now working for my third Minister for Sport. Oh well I achieved my main objective when I asked Kate Hoey MP to visit York St and she accepted. I accompanied her to our game against Rushden & Diamonds in March 2001. My first game was the 1982 Cup tie with Sheffield United. I then went home and away every week until moving south in 1991. Went to every game on the road to Wembley in 1985 - and there weren't many of us in the fog at Alvechurch in December 1984! Obviously the Unibond limited my appearances somewhat so it's refreshing to be back in the big time and able to go to places like Dagenham after work. I must make reference to Mr Fee at this point who had the team playing marvellous stuff in 1996 but perhaps wasn't given the same backing. Well, I'm the idiot who climbed up each floodlight pylon a few years back to take loads of snaps - some of which appear elsewhere on this site. Favourite players: wingers mainly like Dave Gilbert, Brian Thomson, Stewart Hamill (as that's what I am) and players that interact with fans like John McKenna & Martin Hardy. Good luck to PISA in getting established - it still annoys me at the treatment the club gave the award winning fanzine From Behind Your Fences. Thanks Mr Evans for getting my team & town back making headlines.\n\nRichard Burton (richard@burtons0+freeserve+co+uk) I have lived at Swineshead near Boston all my life. I attend home matches and most away matches. I help with checking the Alphabet Tote on Monday nights and help around the ground during the Summer. I am looking forward to the season when the club fulfills its potential for playing performances but still remains friendly, maybe the Football For Life youth development programme will form the basis.\n\nChris Burwell (cburwell#netcomuk+co+uk) I live in Sutterton and try to get to as many games as possible. My favourite player is Glen Maddison......Not!\n\nAndy Butler (andylisabutler#townendbarmyarmy+freeserve+co+uk) I have been a Pilgrim for 23 years and long to witness again a team parading a championship trophy around York Street. Hopefully this will be achieved under Steve Evans astute leadership. All we need is for the club to get it right off the pitch and all our dreams will be realised. I attend all home games and away games when possible (most Saturdays).\n\nDaniel Butler (james#jwarsop+freeserve+co+uk) I go and watch Boston every game home and away. Last season I travelled from Poole to Gainsborough on 26th of December 1997. This was a round trip of 564 miles. Is this the furthest anyone has travelled to any game. UP THE PILGRIMS!\n\nJosh Butler (andylisabutler#townendbarmyarmy+freeserve+co+uk) I have been a Boston fan since I was 6 years old (4 years ago) I go to most away games on the BUSA bus. My favourite player is Daryl Clare.\n\nLee Butler (lee#butler4526+fsnet+co+uk) I have supported United for 25 years. Hopefully the good times are here to stay. I try to get to as many matches as possible, but it can be difficult living in Reading. I get back up home whenever possible.\n\nLisa Butler (andylisabutler#townendbarmyarmy+freeserve+co+uk) I Have supported Boston since 1983 when I went to my first match. Since 1998 I have been to most home matches and now I run the BUSA buses and travel to all the away matches with my husband Andy.\n\nEstelle Calfe (née Howes) (calfe#calfe+worldonline+co+uk) I was born and brought up in Boston and am now married to a Gooner and live in Barnet, north London. We have a son who supports Boston, Arsenal and Barnet! It was great to be in the away team end at Underhill when we beat Barnet 1-0. We're doing brilliantly this season. Long may it continue!\n\nStefan Call (MNAFETSC#aol+com) I've been supporting Boston for a season now. I'm one of the few Americans who supports someone besides Manchester United, Arsenal, and/or Liverpool. Don't know why I support United, I just love following the small clubs.\n\nBecky Callaby (donna.callaby1#btinternet+com) I'm ten years old and go to Swineshead St Mary's Primary school. I go to most of the Boston home matches. I go to the matches with my Dad and my thirteen year old brother Danny.\n\nDanny Callaby (donna.callaby1#btinternet+com) I have ginger hair, I am older than twelve but younger than twenty. I am training in three techniques of martial arts and I am a very skilled boxer for my age. I have a human punch bag called Brian, my brother, he is 23 years older than me. I go to Boston Grammar School and I'm in the year above year 7 but below University. I attend almost every home match and a few away matches. I am no good at speeeling.\n\nSimon Callaby (donna.callaby1#btinternet+com) I live in Swineshead and go to as many matches as possible with my two children.\n\nPhil Callow (phil#ark+me+uk) Unfortunately I don't get over as much as I'd like but check progress on the website and try and see a few matches each season. Enjoyed the Macclesfield though! Up the Pilgrims!\n\nJonathan Calvert (jfcalvert#hotmail+com) I am from Boston but am currently at Loughborough University. I will be watching them next year in the Conference.\n\nGrace Cameron (i.cameron#talk21+com) I was born in the Pilgrim Hospital 9 years ago. I live in Berkshire now, but I have a soft spot for Boston and follow their results.\n\nStuart Cammack (stuart#cammack4+fsnet+co+uk) Amber and Black runs very deep in my family veins. My 4 year boy is close to being initiated into our wonderful proud tradition of a LIFELONG PILGRIM! Spilsby born and then a 20 year RAF spell I have now settled in Ruskington. What a wonderful time it is as I gleefully clutch my SEASON TICKET anticipating the next game. High points of the season ALL OF IT! STEVE EVANS for MAYOR, PM, CHIEF OF POLICE, KNIGHTHOOD, FREEDOM OF BOSTON\\LINCOLN\\ etc.\n\nSteve Canham (steve_canham2002#yahoo+co+uk) Born in Boston in 1975, but moved to Fareham, near Portsmouth when just 6 months. Now living in Dudley, Birmingham also following Liverpool FC. Followed the Pilgrims for the past six years and was ecstatic at both the Dr Martens championship and the Conference championship. Having a few friends from Dagenham made the success even sweeter. Good luck for the new season. Well I'll be able to see them play against Kidderminster, any Boston fans out there in the Birmingham area give us a shout, and a lift to Boston games, much appreciated.\n\nFrancisco Carlos (fcss#ufrgs.br) I am a fan of English football, especially amateur football, and like this team ..congratulacion..\n\nHannah Carpenter (jcarpenter#rusko+freeserve+co+uk) Sister and daughter of the rest of the clan but they left me out!\n\nJulie Carpenter (nee Wild) (Jcarpenter#rusko+freeserve+co+uk) I am married to Richard and am mother to Sam, I go to home games with the above. I am from Ingoldmells originally but now live in Ruskington.\n\nRichard Carpenter (rcarpenter#rusko+freeserve+co+uk) Myself and my son live in Ruskington near Sleaford and try to get to as many home games as possible. We are new converts (1998) to York Street and always sit in the Main stand on the half way line with our friends offering vocal constructive advice!!\n\nDarren (Dazjc666#hotmail+com) and Gavin Carrington (GCarri21281#hotmail+com) We live in Boston and have supported the Pilgirms for the whole of our lives.\n\nStuart `Jock` Carter (stuart.carter#cableinet+co+uk) I have supported the Pilgrims for 17 years. My first match was Crewe in the FA Cup in 83, now living in Dundee watching the other dream team Dundee United. I try to keep up to date with the Pilgrims, but haven't seen them play for 3 years. Keep up the good work. CONFERENCE HERE WE COME...\n\nAnthony Cartwright (hlop7121#northtyneside.org.uk) I am 15 years of age and I am football crazy. I support the lower division clubs but non as big as yours. I play football whenever I have spare time - even on my computer. I created a team called Boston United - it was all official even down to the players and I added myself to the team. I would like to play for the Pilgrims someday.\n\nIan \"Lank\" Chaplin (ichaplin#hotmail+com) I am 14 years old and a keen Boston Utd fan. I was at the legendery game against Grantham Town and I was amazed at what I saw! The best is Boston and I am with you all the way.\n\nLee Chase (LeeChase#iee.org) Boston born and bred but now live in Coventry (73 miles from York Street). A place where people talk funny and can't play football for toffee :-).\n\nNicky Chester (nicky.chester#ntlworld+co+uk) I am Chez and I support The Pilgrims. All I can say is UP THE PILGRIMS!!! BOSTON ARE THE GREATEST!!!\n\nStephen Church (stephen-church#beeb+net) I am 28 yrs old, married to Claire and have a son called Thomas. I live in Holbeach but have supported Boston United for the last 13 years.\n\nJohn B. Clark (jbclark#btinternet+com) I have followed the club since I was taken to a Mather Cup match at Shodfriars Lane, United v Aston Villa. It was in the 1946/7 season and United won 4-2. Freddy Tunstall was the trainer and made a brief appearance in the second half. I believe Jock Bayne was the keeper. I stood with my father and several others on a farm wagon trailer placed behind the goal for the occasion!! I left the area in 1957 but have always looked for the results in the press and the last time I saw them play was in the FA cup v Ilkeston Town when they came to this part of the midlands. I have now retired and live in the Nottingham area. I have spent many happy hours at the Ground in the late 40's and 50's. The most memorable watch was the cup win over Derby County. The return journey on the coach was a very lively affair!! Good luck for the rest of the present season and and who knows I may hear from some contempory supporters?\n\nChristian Clarke (clarkes#cav31+freeserve+co+uk) I'm 13 and I've been coming to see Boston for 11 years now. I sit in the Finnforest stand every week with my dad and we also travel to some of the away matches.\n\nIan Cliff (ian#prisontown+freeserve+co+uk) I live at Folkingham near Sleaford (22 miles from York Street). I have been an avid follower of the Pilgrims for more than 25 years now. I don't get to so many away games as I did, but hardly miss any home games.\n\nKerry Coggle (Kerry.Coggle#btinternet+com) I was introduced to BUFC by my brother in September 1993 versus Canvey Island. We lost (thanks to Mr Morris) but my son Tom (former mascot) and I have been avid supporters, home and away ever since. Thanks to Mr Malkinson over the years the club still exists and long may it continue!\n\nRussell Coggle (Kerry.Coggle#btinternet+com) I am an armchair fan of Boston United having been to a lot of games over the last seven years. I'm always looking for the result at 16.45 on a Saturday afternoon. Long live Boston United.\n\nDavid Cole (davidcole0#talk21+com) My first match was Oct 1966 a 4-1 defeat at the hands of Grantham Town in the FA cup. I was hooked and was back within 2 weeks for the West Midlands league fixture against Port Vale reserves! Great memories of the rise from that league, into the Northern Premier and to the Conference. Back again last season as a season ticket holder travelling from Nottingham with my 3 year old son.\n\nEmma Cole (davidcole0#talk21+com) I am 8 years old and a Boston United fan. My brother and my dad are already on this page. I enjoy watching matches and I want to go again soon.\n\nMatthew Cole (davidcole0#talk21+com) I am 3 years old and went to my first match at Boston United when I was 2. I went to 10 matches last season with my Dad. I wear my United shirt for nursery and know the names of 10 players.\n\nJohn Conrad (odocon2#aol+com) I am an American and a follower of Boston United and hope they gain promotion to the Football League someday within the next 5 years. I also follow Fisher Athletic and Wealdstone along with Bournemouth and Hereford. Anyone wishing to trade footie stuff from the USA for non-league footie programmes from England please email me now with the team you support.\n\nDavid Aidan Coogan (davidcoogan#lineone+net) I am a paramedic in Northumberland near Berwick on Tweed (the only English club playing in Scotland). Brought up in Lincs during the 70's. Had a long interest in the fortunes of the \"Pilgrims\" though lived in Scunny so saw the \"Iron\" more than any other club. Would like to join a Boston Utd supporters club.\n\nChris Cook (cookie#ccps+freeserve+co+uk) The legendary forward, assistant manager and youth development officer himself!\n\nGary Cook (jwarsop#hotmail+com) Unfortunatly I will have to disagree with Tim Allen's comments about Boston nightlife. The Wheatsheaf Hotel in Swineshead is much more relaxed and a regular haunt for the Pilgrims' stars.\n\nShara Cook (sharacook#lycos+co+uk) I work at Dinky Donuts on the boston market. I love the Weatherstone brothers and Bazza.\n\nSteffen Cook (Cookie.Itchybum#nationwideisp+net) I've been a townender for about 6 years or so. I've missed a couple of seasons due to being in exile (in Germany) for reasons far too boring to go into. I try to attend all home matches and as many away games as possible. I once even stayed sober at an away tie! (Burton 1-1 earlier this season). I receive a lot of tongue-in-cheek abuse at my flat cap, but it's all in good fun. Long live the town end. Up the punks!\n\nTom Luke Cook (tomlukecook#yahoo+co+uk) I am also a Stereophonics fan. My favourite cartoon is South Park.\n\nLance Cooper (coops#jazzline+net.au) Born in Boston 1938, went to St Botolph`s School then BGS. Left to join R.A.F. in 1953 now reside in Perth, Western Australia (8991 miles from York Street). Follow Boston United in the International Express.\n\nPaddy Cork (paddy#chalkisgoodforyou+co+uk) I am 46 on Monday 6th May. I go to the games regulary with my best friends, Big John, Martin and Tufts. I always take my chalk with me to chew on. At half time we meet up with John Dawes and solve some difficult equations.\n\nPaddy Corke (corkey#talk21+co+uk) I go to the Pilgrims matches with Martin Wright and John Neal. We are the geezers at the Spain Lane. I look like Mr Bean and my favourite pastime is sailing with my best friend Peter Dorr. Peter is known as caveman by the Spain Laners because of his beard. With even more legs here this season we should have a good chance.\n\nDerek Corton (corton#brinsley48+freeserve+co+uk) I am a Lincolnshire lad who now lives in Nottinghamshire. I follow Forest but my first team is the Pilgrims. My uncle took me to my first game against Lancaster City in about 71-72. My earliest match which I remember was against Portsmouth in the FA Cup - which Pompey won 1-0. I have followed Forest to Munich and Madrid but my favorite match was when me and a few others went to follow Boston at Derby in the FA Cup, how Alan Tewley's goal bound effort just stuck in the mud on the line still p$%%£\" me off.... Seeing the Pilgrims at Wembley was great to see, pity about the result. I still look for their results every week and hopefully a place in the football league is just around the corner. Conde, Svarc, Smith, White, Adamson, Kabia, Howells, Simpson, Bates the list of greats is endless.\n\nMatt Cottingham (matthew.cottingham#bbc+co+uk) Journalist for the Beeb living and working in London. But I was born in Boston 23 years ago and still look out for the results of the Pilgrims.\n\nDarren Cox (darrenmcox#btinternet+com) Born in Kirton in 1968, now living in Manchester. I have always followed the fortunes of Boston Utd and wish them the best of luck for the rest of the season. It would be great to see them get promoted this year.\n\nPaul Cox (paul.cox#coflex+co+uk) I was first introduced to the delights of football in Boston by Richard Smith, inspired creator of the brilliant fanzine, `From Behind Your Fences'. I used to work with Richard more than 12 years ago, when FBYF seemed to have a greater circulation than Reader's Digest. After reading a few issues, and having changed my pants more than once, it wasn't hard to see why. Realising we shared at least the same sense of humour, not to mention the same taste in underwear, Richard lost no time in asking me to contribute to the next one by `fleshing out' his eponimous anti-hero, Farmer Dan. Yes, I shall be going to `The Match' on the 10th and, along with Richard and a few other committed individuals, will be selling the long-awaited Issue 14 of FBYF. Now bigger, better and, at £1, half the price and twice as funny as Viz. All female groupies gratefully received...\n\nAndy Creasey (Motley40#x-stream+co+uk) I have supported the Pilgrims for several years, and attend every home game and the odd away game. I feel that this season (1999/2000) has been the best I have seen. Well done to the lads, and keep the success flowing.\n\nChris Creek (chrisdcdxb#yahoo+co+uk) I have been watching the Pilgrims since the early 70's with either my Dad, Uncle or Grandad Charlie. The two games that stick out in my memory are an away game at Kettering in the early 80's, with Kevin Hector running rings around the opposition and the F.A Trophy game against Blyth Spartans, winning 5-4 after being 1-3 down early in the second half. Both games true classics! I now live and work in Dubai and get to games when I'm home on holiday.\n\nAaron Creighton (munch#hotmail+com) I first started supporting Boston United in the season we got relegated from the Conference. I then didn't miss a game for five years. Then I decided to join the army therefore missing this year's championship (doh). Still attend every so often when on leave but tend to go to more away games than home.\n\nDavid Cropley (Stuart#SCropley+Prestel+co+uk) I am 15 years old and have supported Bosotn since I was 8. I go to every game and always will, as I am one of Boston's biggest fans. Some day I also hope that I will be watching Boston in the Premier League where they belong!\n\nKeith Cross (crossy97#yahoo+com) Hi, my name is Keith Cross. I am a Pilgrims' fan. I live at Wrangle (10 miles from York Street).\n\nNick Cumberworth (ncumberworth#hotmail+com) Boston United supporter since very early age when my Dad started taking me to games. Now live near Melbourne in Victoria, Australia, and speak to Dad on a weekly basis to get the latest update on Boston's progress. Trying to understand Aussie rules football, but it's not the same as the world game!\n\nKevin Curtis (kjbc#kjbc+worldonline+co+uk) Life-long Pilgrims' fan. Sold programmes from 76-79. Now eat prawn sandwiches in the Stantons Stand thanks to winning 2 season tickets with MATCH magazine.\n\nMike Cutchie (cutchiemw#clear+net+nz) Now living in Hamilton, Waikato, New Zealand, I class myself as someone with fond memories of Boston Utd, which originate from a dull November Wednesday in 1954 at Croft Park, Blyth, (K.O. 2.00pm no lights! Att: 10,000, plus school truants such as myself) when in an F.A. Cup replay, my team - The Spartans, losing 4-2 just after half time, clinched it with three mist shrouded goals in the last ten minutes (the balding G.Gair a hat-trick). One apparently well founded story, is that during the first game at Boston, the Blyth centre forward Charlie Weather(Dinner)spoon was injured running back onto the field after half time, when he fell down a manhole. He took no further part in the game, but the 10 Spartans earned that epic replay. I look to my newly found Bostonian links for confirmation or contradiction.\n\nBenjamin Damm (bennydamm#gmx+de) I am 21 years old and I am from Germany. I have supported The Pilgrims since 1987. Nice greetings to all Boston United supporters! Now you know that the Pilgrims have a fan in Germany.\n\nAdie Daubney (adie#the-daubneys+freeserve+co+uk) Born in Boston over 35 years ago and have supported the Pilgrims since first going with my grandad over 30 years ago. Go to all home matches and several away games each season with my two sons Joseph and James. I've good memories of Boston United games like sneaking away from school to watch them play Derby County at home in the FA Cup or the day trip to Wembley for the Trophy final on the bus from the Ropers Arms Pub. Boston's best ever player has still got to be Jim Kabia. I look forward to many more years with my two boys watching good local football.\n\nJames Daubney (James#the-daubneys+freeserve+co+uk) I'm 5 years old and I like Boston United. I have been a mascot in the past. My next day as mascot is on my 6th birthday V Leigh RMI. I go to Tower Road school and I'm a season ticket holder for Boston. I play tennis once a week and play football with my brother in our garden. My favorite player is Paul Bastock.\n\nJoseph Daubney (joseph#the-daubneys+freeserve+co+uk) I am 7 years old and go to Tower Road school. I am a season ticket holder at Boston United. My favorite players are Jamie Cook and Daryl Clare. I hope Boston United win the Conference. I like Liverpool as well as Boston. I go to tennis twice a week and football training too. I play football in my garden and would like to play for Boston one day.\n\nMathew Daurge (Daurgey88#Hotmail+com) I would rather be a Pilgrim than an Imp. I go to see all home games with Stevie Wood and a dedicated fan Joseph Rossington.\n\nLaura Davenport (lauradavenport#hotmail+com) I like Boston United and Newcastle United.\n\nSteven Davey (steven#sdavey3+freeserve+co+uk) Born in Boston in 1947 I attended Tower Rd and Boston Grammar Schools. I have been living in Norfolk since 1972 but still get over as often as I can to support the best non-league team in the country. Division 3 fixtures for 2001/02 please Mr Evans! We can do it.\n\nColin Davy (colin+davy#virgin+net) I now live in Merseyside. They are all very depressed at present but the Doctor Martens League is unknown around here.\n\nJack Davy (jack#jackdavy+freeserve+co+uk) I am ten years old and have been supporting United since I was eight and I have been the mascot.\n\nJon Davy (dj2xtreme2002#aol+com) I live just outside Alford and I'm a big supporter of Boston Utd. I don't get to many games but wish I could. The Mighty Pilgrims are the Pride of Lincolnshire and everyone should be a fan. The Pilgrims will get promotion and will be champions of division 3 next season.\n\nAndrew Dawes (andrewdawes#hot-toast+com) Lived in Boston from 82-88 where I went to B.G.S. I was known as Andrew Waters and nicknamed Andre. Boston never lost whenever I sat in the top left green seat in the main stand (I sat there about 30 times!). Thank god we're back in the Conference and hopefully we'll never have to visit those dreadful places like Alfreton and Frickley again!\n\nJohn Dawes (JD#brests+com) Hi, I'm John and I go to Boston Grammar School. I watch the Pilgrims with my maths teacher Steve Woodliffe and his crew (Martin, John, Patrick and Peter). We love BUFC like I do Euler's equation - a beautiful relationship between e, π, i and -1. My favourite pastimes are solving BUFC's chances of promotion by doing them mathematically. COME ON YOU YELLAS!!!\n\nAndy Dawson (dawsy#genie+co+uk) I'm 15 years old and live in Skegness. Me and my mates Karl and Tett come to every home game and stand in Spayne Road or the Town End. My favourite players are Mark Rawle and Andy Stanhope. The best Pilgrims game I have been to is the last home game of last season, the Town End was packed and the atmosphere was electric. Let's get to Division 3. COME ON!\n\nNeil Dawson (neild#pavilion+net) Living in Brighton, but born and bred in Boston, still following on the radio and tv and will get to more games this season when the Pilgrims hit the South.\n\nWilliam Dawson (terence+dawson#ntlworld+com) Born in Boston but living in Belfast. Still have relatives in Leverton. Dad's name is Terry and mum's name Amelia. Used to live in Tooley Lane, Wrangle with my twin brother Brian and elder brother Peter before moving to N.Ireland.

Up the Pilgrims for the Conference. Me, Paddy, John and Martin will be there next season!\n\nTom Deamer (tommydeam#talk21+com) We all know tufty is a die hard fan, but me and John Neal like to party down Spain Lane, and Paddy Corke comes along with the beany man styleeeee. Up the Boston and the K.T.C.\n\nSam Deamer (tommyd#albanyhouse+com) I love BUFC. I support Man Utd I play for Wyberton Colts. I was mascot on New Years day.\n\nIan Denby (ian+denby#btopenworld+com) Born in Cleethorpes, lived in Grantham until one year old (luckily). Grew up in Boston, watched the Pilgrims as a lad, remember Casey, Cook, Devan White etc, infamously tried to climb over roof once due to lack of admission fee but failed. Best memories, Trophy semi final v Altrincham, cup tie v Blyth Spartans (5-4) & clinching promotion by beating Grantham.\n\nGer Devlin (craftycorky#hotmail+com) Not an avid football fan but have heard a lot about you guys. So would like to wish you all the best of success for the future. GOOD LUCK.\n\nJohn Dewars (robert+dewars#btinternet+com) I have supported BUFC for the last three years hardly missing a home game. Away games are a problem as I work Saturday mornings, but I do go when I can. I have been a season ticket holder for the last two years. I live in Kirton and work in Boston.\n\nMartin Dickman (martin+dickman#virgin+net) I lived in Boston for the first twenty years of my life, I then moved away some 10 years ago and I now live in Oxford. Although, my first team is Notts County, I have supported Boston since I was about 5 years old. I still try and get to see the Pilgrims when I come to see my parents, who still live in Manor Gdns. Let's see Boston back in the Conference and beyond! P.S. I miss Batemans Beer!\n\nJim Dickson (jim#wyberton20+fsnet+co+uk) I am 27 years old and have lived in Boston all my life. I have supported United through good and bad times since 1985 and this year is going to be the greatest. Promotion to the Conference a certainty.\n\nChloe Dix (Scegg+Dix#btinternet+com) I'm 14. I've supported Boston since I was very small. I swim for Boston Swimming Club. I never miss a home match (unless I'm swimming) and try to get to as many away games as possible.\n\nBen Dolby (Ben+Dolby#gartree+sch+lincs+uk) I've supported Boston most of my life as I was born in Boston. I go with my mates Stephen Wood, Robert McCusker, Joe Rossington, Troy Golding, Chris Wainwright and our most dedicated fan Adam Goy. Adam has also been a mascot for the Pilgims 4 times.\n\nBrian Donkin (donkinbrian#hotmail+com) I am a lifelong supporter of Boston United - the pride of Lincolnshire. My favourite players are Bastock, Elding, Ellender and Daryl Clare. Steve Evans is a great manager and Boston are definately going up this season.\n\nChris Donkin (donkin+itex#btopenworld+com). I moved to Boston from Edinburgh in October 1991 and although I am first and foremost a Hearts supporters I have become hooked on the York Street experience. I have seen most home games played in the last 12 seasons and my favourite player is the one and only \"Baldy\" Bastock.\n\nPeter Dorr (Beardy#talk21+com) I've been a Pilgrim for 12 years now, usually in the Spayne Road stand with Tufty, Big John and Paddy Corke (Mr. Bean). I love my sailing weekends away with Paddy, They're such FUN! Next year we need more legs on show to boost our challenge. Big up BUFC and Tommy Deamer.\n\nCraig Dowse (b+dowse#virgin+net) I live 4 miles away from York Street and go to see almost all home games, and a few away. I am 14 years old and go to Kirton Middlecott Secondary School. Here's hoping for a good 1998/99 season!\n\nColin Draper (colin#sheffield+telinco+co+uk) Me (age 47) and my football mad son Sam (age 11) would just like to say CONGRATULATIONS and hope to catch your games next year at Lincoln, York, Scunthorpe, Hull and any other grounds within a 2 hour drive from Sheffield. And of course the odd visit to Boston. Football as it should be (i.e. a good day out, a laugh, frustration sometimes but no hard feelings, good mates, people who understand the game) is now found in the 2nd and 3rd and the Conference... and even in the Welsh League!\n\nKeith Drewitt (drewitt31#london+com) Hi, I am a great fan of your Team. I have supported Boston for the last season and this season. I can't get to Boston as much as I like because I am only 15.\n\nThomas Duck (Ruddyduck#btinternet+com) I will be going to as many of Boston's games as I can next season. I hope that Boston United do well.\n\nSimon Duff (sidtysam#aol+com) Hi. I'm a 12 year old Aries who enjoys football and hockey. I am a lifetime fan of the Pilgrims.\n\nNick Dunmore (knicki#ntlworld+com) Bostonian born and bred. Been supporting the Pilgrims from a very early age, even going to Wembley once. I'm now in the Army and don't get home as often as I would like. Last match I saw was the Grantham clincher last season, what a day !!!!\n\nLaurent Duval (rageagainsttheinternet#hotmail+com) Even though I do not live in Boston anyone from Lincolnshire can see they are the pride of Lincolnshire. So I choose to support the mighty Pilgrims. I do not get to many games as I live outside the county. EVANS BARMY ARMY.\n\nNeil Eardley (Neil#neardley+freeserve+co+uk) Born in Boston in 1953. Been supporting the Pilgrims since the Midland League days. Worked in Saudi Arabia, Southport, California USA, and currently Doncaster. I have always managed to find Boston United results! LET'S ALL GET BEHIND THEM IN 2000.\n\nPaul Edenbrow (liy6ep1#lin3+smf+nottingham+ac+uk) Hello. I have lived in Boston all my life and now am a student at Nottingham. My first real memory of the Pilgrims was their superb 3-2 extra-time victory in the semi-final of the FA Trophy, and of course the final itself. David 'Diddie' Gilbert was the best player I have seen in the 'famous' Amber and Black, followed closely by Winston Campbell (joke). You can hear me on URN, 97.5FM in the Nottingham area.\n\nLee Edge (top_edge1#hotmail+com) I don't actually support Boston but I live in London with two Boston boys. All I hear from the Legendry Tim Allen and the 'Boy' Richard Knight is stories of a day out at York Street followed by a night out in some of the country's finest nightspots. What I wouldn't give to pay a visit to the Town Pump. Good luck to the Pilgrims and I can't wait to make my Boston 'debut' at York street and the Pump.\n\nByron Edwards (byron1989#eddie83+freeserve+co+uk) I am a 12 year old pupil of the Spalding Grammar School, and I've got one big problem - everyone takes the mickey cus I'm a Pilgrims fan. But as many people will agree these are the sad glory hunters who follow the top divisions instead of the great local teams. My favourite player is Daryl clare and you can always find me, my dad and my two uncles in Spayne Road, cus we're Spayne Road til we die!\n\nJune Egan (jgegan#talk21+com) I am a receptionist at the Port of Boston. I attend all the home matches I can along with a few away games. I often bring along my grandchildren to games. I am keeping everything crossed that we go up to the Conference as we deserve.\n\nKate Eglinton (eggwhyte#yahoo+com) Started supporting the Pilgrims at the start of last season and I now never miss a home game. Although not entirely happy about Paul Raynor's addition to the team to begin with, I am now entirely converted. I love his committment and aggressive style of play.\n\nBrendan Epton (bepton2001#yahoo+co+uk) I like playing football and I just love watching Boston home and away.\n\nSteve Evans (sjevans#sarah-jane+freeserve+co+uk) Manager of Boston United F.C. Please see details as supplied on the squad page but I thought it appropriate to join up as I am a \"Pilgrims Supporter\".\n\nDavid Everitt (david#everitt71+freeserve+co+uk) I have just worked out that the 2000/01 season will be my twenty-first season of watching BUFC. Watch out Football League here we come! (passing Lincoln City on the way!)\n\nJon Everitt (pasty362#hotmail+com) When I started working in East Yorks, I thought that I'd be able to get back to see more games - weekend working is a terrible thing!\n\nPat Everitt (pateveritt#blueyonder+co+uk) I was born, brought up, schooled etc in Boston. I currently live in Shoeburyness. Unfortunately my Saturday afternoons are currently occupied as I am still fit enough (my wife says daft enough) to be playing Rugby Union. Match attendances have dropped since I moved from Nottingham, but I try to get to as many as possible. Regards to anyone out there who knows or remembers me.... drop me a E-Mail.\n\nIan Evison (Ianev#aol+com) I live in Spilsby, 16 miles down the A16. I was a very keen supporter during the early 90's but getting a girlfriend (now wife) put an end to that! Falling from the Conference didn't help matters, neither has the commitment shown by the Football Club in returning to the promised land. I still manage a few games a year and to cheer all you guys and gals up I currently manage BUFC on Championship Manager taking them to 6th position in the third division last season only to fail in the playoffs. Half way through this season I am 14th but 12 points from the top 7. Noel Whelan and Jason Lee are my front men with Mark Kinsella and Stan Lazaridis in midfield, maybe at York Street proper one day !?\n\nJeremy Eyeons (beveye#breathemail+net) Last season was brilliant for me, it brought back sweet memories from my youth when we won the NPL on several occasions. I recognise several names in the supporters list from my days at Boston Grammar School. I still live in Boston. UP THE PILGRIMS!\n\nChris Fairbrother (chris#cfair+freeserve+co+uk) Introduced to the delights of Northern Premier and the Doc Martens by my son-in-law from Wyberton. Looking forward to attending as many games as I can in the coming season.\n\nShane Farllow (shanef2k#hotmail+com) Hi all Pilgrim fans. I'm from Tazmania, the small island off Australia (10783 miles from York Street) and I keep up-to-date with happenings in Boston from my sister Cath Singleton who lives on Margret Drive. Keep up the good form Pilgrims!\n\nAdam Farnsworth (ex8013#qmw+ac+uk) I'm a 19 year old Pilgrim who is at present a student at Queen Mary and Westfield college in east London, who lives north west of London near Watford.\n\nMervyn Farnsworth (ex8013#qmw+ac+uk) Father of Adam, I was born and raised in Alford even though I live near Watford I try and see as many matches as I can and look foward to the days when we move back into League football.\n\nAndi Farrow (andi17#ic24+net) I spent the first 12 years of my life living in Boston, Dad changed jobs and I'm now living in Nottingham. Any one fancy keeping in touch and letting me know how the Pilgrims are doing?\n\nJason Feary (jason+feary#oracle+com) I live in Bracknell at the moment but I travel to see my beloved Pilgrims at every oppertunity. I used to enjoy going with my old pal Noddy Fishwick, but unfortunatly we drifted apart. Now my favourite day is relaxing a nice curry house with the fond memories of a Pilgrims home win. I spend most of my time being the butt of colleagues jokes. I love chutney on kormas hence my nickname \"Chutney\". We are planning a trip to Kingstonian and hope to see you all there. Up the Pilgrims.\n\nBruce Featherstone (bruce_featherstone#bc+sympatico+ca) I supported United in the late sixties and early seventies when I went to B.G.S. Afternoon at \"the game\" and evening at the Gliderdrome. Great place and great times! Good luck in the future.\n\nMatthew Featherstone (mat#featherstone+aol+com) I go to St Bedes school and I support Liverpool as well as Boston.\n\nJohn Fenton (John#fentstep+freeserve+co+uk) I have supported the Pilgrims for about 30 years and normally get to about a dozen games a season but the change of leagues has made a right pigs ear of things this year! I come from Blackburn and I'm the one with the enormous flag.\n\nTerry Finisterre (finisterrete#candw+lc) I'm from St. Lucia, same as Ken Charlery, and I'm a journalist as well as a footie fan. I'm hoping the Pilgrims will get out of the Conference this year, and the way my boy Ken Charlery is going, they just might!\n\nGavin Finnegan (gavinfinnegan#hotmail+com) Now in my second year supporting the Pilgrims and have enjoyed every second of it. Hopefully during the season I will be able to cross the Irish sea and see the mighty Boston triumph again.\n\nNoddy Fishwick (noddyfishwick#yahoo+com) I work as a fishmonger in Lincoln. I love standing on the Town End when I have the time. In my spare time I enjoy watching wildlife and I am a member of the WWF. I think that Mr Evans can only take the Pilgrims forward although I was upset that Ken Monkou never joined the Boston revolution.\n\nKaty Fixter (katy#kfixter+freeserve+co+uk) I am 23 and first went to a match at age 3 months (Dad brought me in a pram to see Boston United Reserves so I don't think I ever had any choice in the matter of being a Pilgrim). Until going away to Uni I went to practically every home match (and am probably one of only a few fans to have been to almost every away match when we were in the Unibond League, missing only midweek matches). These days at York Street I can mostly be found down Spayne Road or in the Announcers Box with my dad, who is the one who has to play that terrible after - goal music!\n\nSally Fixter (S+Fixter#uea+ac+uk) I am currently a student at the University of East Anglia (no I don't know you Mark Judd!). I have attended nearly every United match since the age of three, when my Dad took me to a match. I feel I must mention his name (Mick Fixter), as he is a veritable fountain of useless information about the Pilgrims dating back to 1955. Sorry Dad!\n\nJenny Flint (ntybe062#sonm+nottingham+ac+uk) I am a student nurse in Boston. I have followed the Pilgrims for over 10 years now and my only wish is to see them back in the Conference. My fondest memory of United is when they were in the FA Cup and we lost to Chester City. Although the result did not go our way it was one of the best team performances I have seen.\n\nJackie Forman (jackiesue22#netscapeonline+co+uk) I am from Boston originally, I used to play for Boston Ladies in the 70s, and I used to sell programmes when Jim Smith was manager, I now live in Kent.\n\nChris Foster (bfchrisfoster#bun+com) Born in Boston, 1971, left 1973 to become a Yorkshireman in Barnsley. Watched BFC as a fanatical supporter since the age of 7 but rekindled my interest in the Pilgrims after chatting with Phil Birkett (top bloke) who keeps me informed of their progress. I'm hoping to get in contact with anyone of the same age and also re-establish links with Phil Birkett. Good to see the Pilgrims doing well although I have to admit I am Barnsley through and through - Football league next season - Oakwell 3 years after that?\n\nRichard Foster (richard+sexyman#btopenworld+com) I am from Boston but have recently moved to Derbyshire but it doesn't stop me coming on the site and finding out all the results. GO BOSTON!\n\nDennis Fox (dfox#netrover+com) I was born in Boston in 1947. I have been an avid Pilgrims supporter as a result of my late father's unconditional support and regular attendance at all home games for 40 years. I have relocated many times and currently living in Ottawa, Canada (3290 miles from York Street). Until recently when I hooked up to the internet, I had my mother send me all newspaper clippings from the Lincolnshire Standard and The Target. What a pleasure to find the Pilgrim's home page. I travel back to Boston once a year to visit my mother and of course to attend Boston's games. The deciding factor of when I return is often the fixture list. I have sponsored a match ball for two seasons in my daughter's name in support of the club. Good Luck to the Pilgrims in future seasons.\n\nKen Fox (ken#kafox+freeserve+co+uk) The producer of these pages. I was born in Boston but my family moved to Maidstone in Kent when I was three. I got hooked on United after watching them play in the early seventies when I was back in Boston visiting relatives during the school holidays. I now live in Leeds but work as a principal transport modeller for Transport for London in their office in Endeavour Square in London. I try to get to all the games within easy reach of Leeds as well as three or four games a season back in Boston.\n\nMarc Fox (students#stbedes+lincs+sch+uk) I like pigs and mountain biking. I have supported Boston United and Manchester United for 11 years.\n\nDerek Fuller (julia+derek#cwcom+net) I went to BGS and started following United when I was in the sixth form. I have now been in Manchester for 20 years and look forward to seeing more games this season. The days in the NPL were great for me, but my watching the lads play was restricted when they were in the DM league. Let's hope they do well this coming season and destroy the likes of Kettering etc.\n\nBJ Furnell (bj_furnell#yahoo+com) I live five miles from Boston and have been a supporter for ten years.\n\nGaz Furnell (gfurnell#yahoo+com) I've been a loyal supporter of Boston United for 11 years. I live in Langrick with my family who are all keen Boston supporters.\n\nJulian Furnell (chellefurnell#bun+com) I have supported Boston United for about seven years and I would like to thank my brother Gary for getting me to go to watch them all those years ago. So I would just tell anyone never mind Liverpool or Arsenal, we have a great club here in Boston.\n\nKaren Furnell (kazza_49#hotmail+com) I've lived near Boston for the last 14 years having moved from Ipswich. I'm not what you would call a mad football fan but I take a big interest in BUFC mainly because my family are Boston United mad.\n\nStefan Furnell (swfurnell#hotmail+com) I am 9 years old and I love to watch Boston United. I like the Townend and will till I die. I live in Langrick nr Boston and will be a lifetime fan. Are there any unnattached 9 or 10 year old girls out there who'd like to go out with me?\n\nColly Gallagher (collyg22#hotmail+com) I am messaging you from Maghera, Northern Ireland. I have always followed the Pilgrims results ever since I had my Uncle George Dawson and Auntie Kath living there before they both died. My brother has set up his home there so I go back and forward. I first was in Boston 30 years ago and I remember going to the swimming pool there passing the ground and just getting a real thrill seeing it. So good luck again. George would be ever so proud of Boston getting into the League as he was a referee. He lived in Saint Peter's Lane beside what was formerly known as Faulkners Bakery.\n\nJonathan Gander (pom_gander#hotmail+com) Originally from Long Sutton in Lincs, now studying at Coventry University. Don't get many chances to watch the Pilgrims in action, but I follow them on the internet. Who knows, if we continue rising, and the Sky Blues keep falling, they'll be in the same division soon!\n\nKyle Gardner (kyle#mgardner48+fsnet+co+uk) I like watching Boston play at home when I can. My favourite player is Bazza and I will be supporting him and his team in the Vauxhall Conference next season.\n\nDamien Garford (damegarf#hotmail+com) Pilgrim follower and a Notts County fan, now exiled in Oxfordshire-home of none-too-good footy clubs. I first started watching the Pilgrims during the Eighties, yet since I moved away from Boston I haved watched more games. When I go to York Street I am usually found in the Town End with Ben and Matthew Grant whistling or singing the Laurel and Hardy theme.\n\nJason Garford (jfgarford#zoom+co+uk) Entering my last of four years at uni in Greenwich studying sports science. I have been a Pilgrims' fan for as long as I can remeber. I saw my first ever footy match at York Street when Boston were battling for a place in the then fourth division. It has been a pleasure to follow them over the years but has recently become brilliant with their current position at the top of the Conference. A fantastic achievment in the short space of time, re-kinderling memories of old. This time let's get it right and a get a place in the third. (I'll be able to watch them easily then if they play Oxford where I have been living for the last six years).\n\nDicky Garrard (dickiethegolfer#hotmail+com) Lifetime Pilgrims' fan and always will be.\n\nLuke Gauntlett (luke+gauntlett#virgin+net) I am a six year old boy from Butterwick. I was Boston's mascot against Atherstone 99/00 and my favorite player is Mickey Nuttell.\n\nPaul Gauntlett (luke+gauntlett#virgin+net) A recent convert who gets to all the home games, a few away games and some reserve games.\n\nNatalie Gerrans (nataliejayne87#hotmail+com) I am a big fan of Boston United and also am friends with Mickey Brown and Mark Angel. I live in Spalding and I go on this website every day. I wish them the very best in every game.\n\nHenry Gibbons (henrygibbns#aol+com) I am 12 years old and love and support Boston as much as possible.\n\nBen Gilbert (benjigilbert#yahoo+co+uk) I support the Pilgrims (cos they're my local team!) and have done for six years since I started going to all the home games with my uncle who got me into them. I can't get to many home games anymore as I now live in London, but can make it to some away games (Stevenage, Barnet!) but I still go to home games when I visit my parents. Division 3 next season? Oh yes!! GO YELLOWS!!!\n\nAnthony Gilby (ant#chezgilby+screaming+net) I'm a 13 year old football fanatic living near Spalding. I also support Leeds United and Peterborough. I played for Warboys Colts (Cambs) last season, and am looking for a team near Whittlesey for this season.\n\nMark Gilby (Mark#chezgilby+screaming+net) I'm Anthony's dad and I'm a lot older than 13! I've suppored Leeds for over 30 years now, but have followed the Pilgrims since moving to Spalding 7 years ago.\n\nJames Gleeson (james.gleeson#duflex+com) I lived in Boston until 1996 and am now based in Derby. I am a lifelong Derby County fan but like to see the Pilgrims doing well. Perhaps I'll get a season ticket when I move back to Boston eventually.\n\nTim Goodliff (npatchett#npatchett+screaming+net) I live in Boston about 2 mins walk from the ground! I attend St Bedes School and have been to every home game so far this season and a couple of away games as well. Let's hope the Pilgrims can keep up the good form!!!\n\nVerity Goodliff (timothygoodliff#fsmailtv+com) I live two minutes from the ground and attend whenever possible. I am in favour of Boston moving ground even though I live so close. It would be good to have a BRAND SPANKING new ground and I also believe Steve Evans is one of the best managers the country and possibly better than Alex Ferguson at motivating the team. Well done Steve and keep up the good work. UP THE PILGRIMS.\n\nAdy Gosling (ady#goslng38+screaming+net) I'm 28 and live in Boston. I'm a season ticket holder and it's great to see the improvements of the last two years. It's amazing that we have got games against Man Utd and Liverpool. Hope we can clinch promotion this season.\n\nGeorge Gosling (george+gosling1#btopenworld+com) I am ten years old. My favourite players are: Jamie Cook, Mark Angel, Ross Weatherstone, Simon Weatherstone and Jamie Gould.\n\nDaniel Gould (marcus_goon#hotmail+com) I am Daniel Gould. My bother James plays for Boston and I live in Rushden. My favourite player is Daryl Clare and not James.\n\nShawn Graham (wheatlrc#yahoo+co+uk) I have supported Boston for a year now and have just been to my first away game (Scarborough 16th April 2001). They are cool.\n\nBen Grant (sweetexorcist#aol+com) I'm a 21 year old BUFC fan living in exile in Leeds. I've never seen a Boston team win anything, but that will soon change. I can be spotted wandering round Leeds proudly wearing an orange shirt. Am I the only one?\n\nLee Graves (peberdy#aol+com) Yet another GRANTHAM hater!\n\nAlan Gray (alangray_uk_1999#yahoo+co+uk) Not a million miles from Boston but light years away in the football I get to see locally, Aylesbury United. First Pilgrims game: Morecambe in NPL 1973, supported ever since.\n\nAlessandra & Nicoletta Gray (alan+r+gray#btopenworld+com) I, Alessandra am 4 years old and my sister Nicoletta is two years old. We love United because our daddy does. When we are old enough (15 years) will United have a ladies team we can play for and wear the illustrious Black and Amber shirts? Our mummy Mariannina thinks that daddy is bonkers for driving a 250 mile round trip to most home games. Mummy supports her home town team of Napoli in the Italian Serie B, we think that the Pilgrims would stuff them if they ever met. Thanks to daddy helping us to type this.\n\nKelvin Russell Gray (crockgray1#hotmail+com) My first game at York Street was in 69/70 and I have been hooked ever since.\n\nSamantha Gray (sam#grays+freeserve+co+uk) I was born in Boston, but have lived majority of my life in Gainsborough, but because Dad is a lifelong Pilgrim fan, I have always gone along to the matches and became a supporter myself! Even though I currently live in Gainsborough I manage to get to all home games and a few away. Although this may prove a bit difficult later this season when I move over to the US!\n\nAndy Green (green-kominato#pop06+odn+ne+jp) I'm a Boston supporter living and working here in Japan. Although I come from Warwickshire, my cousins and family live in Boston (Ian Reilly) if anyone knows him. I hope and pray that we make it this year. Good luck to you all and please give a cheer from me. If anyone wishes to contact me please do.\n\nBilly Green (students#stbedes+lincs+sch+uk) I am 13 years old and have supported Boston for the last 3 years.\n\nGarry Green (garry+green#capgemini+co+uk) I live in Rushden (54 miles from York Street), Northants. Originally from Spilsby, I watched Boston since I was 10 (1970 - Bobby Svarc was my hero). I got to see 7 matches last season which is about the norm although I always intend to get to more. Roll on Conference football.\n\nKayleigh Green (paul+sasha#tinyworld+co+uk) I live in Boston about 2 minutes walk from York Street. I play football myself for Holbeach Girls. I've had trials for England u16's and have been chosen for a 2 hour tranning session with Micheal Owen. I go to watch all of the matches. My 5 best players are Tim Wooding, Paul Fewings, Andy Stanhope, Lee Power and Mark Rawle. I have two nicknames Kazza or Jaffa. Good look to Boston Utd in the Nationwide Conference 2000/1.\n\nKirk Green (june+green#virgin+net) I have lived in Boston all my life and so has all of my family going back to the 14th century. I go to Boston Grammar School and support the \"Pilgrims\". They are the best!\n\nPaul Green (paulgreens+mail#btinternet+com) I have followed the Pilgrims since the mid 60's but remember the 70's with pride. During '73 season I think I saw the best squad we've ever had. Over the years some great players come to mind - Malcolm White, John Lakin, Jimmy Raynor, Jimmy Fell, Bobby Svarc, Bobby Brown, Gerry Stewart, and GOD himself... John Moyes. Just want to send the present squad all the best for the coming '02-'03 season.\n\nRuss Green (greeno69#email+com) I started supporting the Pilgrims in 1978. I don't get to as many games as I would like to as I am also a season ticket holder at QPR (and I live in Watford!). I always look for the results on SKY SPORTS every Saturday, whether I'm at work or not. Up the Pilgrims (hopefully into the Nationwide League).\n\nAnthony Greenman (tonyiow#btinternet+com) Born in Boston in 1963 and currently living in Ryde, Isle of Wight. I would love to hear from any other Island people who support Boston. My brother-in-law, Simon Callaby who lives at Swineshead watches them most home games. Lucky sod! At least I got to watch them on Sky today. Good Luck in your quest for promotion.\n\nPaula Griffin (paula.griffin#priory.lincs.sch.uk) I enjoy watching football and I go to all of the home matches and I enjoy supporting the Pilgrims. I am 16 years old and I will be starting at Boston College soon.\n\nDavid Griffiths (davidgriffiths#utvinternet+com) I had the privilege of watching the PILGRIMS from 1973 to 1991, when I moved to Belfast from Skegness. I still follow the results each week and ring the club call from time to time. Still love the Pilgrims and follow the recent success with pride. Fantasic to see them top of the Conference in early September, hope to still be there in May. Love to hear from any of the fans I used to know. Now support Glentoran, had a wonderful European trip to Denmark in August in UEFA cup.\n\nKieran Griffiths (timshorts#hotmail+com) I am ten years old. I once sponsored Steve Stoutt's shorts. My best moment as a Boston fan was being taken onto the pitch by Paul Bastock when I was a toddler at Telford. I like QPR, Willem II Tilburg and Borussia Dortmund, but I like my Boston home shirt best.\n\nTim Griffiths (timshorts#hotmail+com) Stuck in Sussex. Hampered by children. Tortured by the memory of Peter Morris. (Not so) Closet Merthyr Tydfil fan as well. Hates Forest Green Rovers. Threatened during the inspired 4-2 victory with sending off by the referee at Dagenham & Redbridge.\n\nIvan Griggs (igriggs#iee+org+uk) I was born in Boston, but live in Nottingham. I remember the FA Cup matches against Derby County, Jim Smith and Howard Wilkinson. I try to follow BU as much as possible (this does not include attending as many matches as I want to) by relying on the TV or internet. Keep the Glory Days rolling - FA cup success next!\n\nSteve Grist (seiflow#surflink+co+uk) I don't know about being the furthest away from the York Street ground but we think that we may be the nearest, living just round the corner in Manor Gardens in clear view of the floodlights and within reach of a Paul Bastock goal kick. I started supporting at the age of 9 just after the 1966 World Cup, having the privilege of supporting The Pilgrims through the glory years of Jim Smith and Howard Wilkinson and the disappointment of non election to the league in the late 70s. Now 30 years later I can't decide whether it's just insanity that keeps me going week after week or the fact that I can keep an eye on my bathroom window from the Spayne Road terracing. In recent seasons my son Matthew now aged 11 has become a keen United supporter acting as mascot on two occasions and has helped to keep his father's language in check in these most trying of times in the Unibond Premier League. Surely we will soon return to our rightful place in the top flight of non-league football.\n\nRichard Grooby (richard+grooby#zoom+co+uk) I try to see as many games as I can. I am hoping to get a season ticket this year for next season. When we go up to division three!\n\nSophie Grooby (chubbles44#hotmail+com) Evans' Barmy army! Division 3 here we come!\n\nStuart and Christine Grooby (Us2Groobs#altavista+com) I live in San Jose, California (5289 miles from the mecca of non-league football). I work for Marcus & Millichap, one of the largest commercial real estate companies in the US. Until recently I lived in Lincoln and regularly supported the Pilgrims as that was my home town. The highlight being the FA Trophy final appearance in 1985. Just like another fan on this page, I've also got my American wife interested in the Pilgrims, she even has a BUFC shirt.\n\nHarry Gurton (harry.gurton#virgin+net) I've been a supporter of the Pilgrims for about five years. COME ON U PILGRIMS.\n\nSimon Guy (simonguy1#lycos+co+uk) Currently living in Buckinghamshire, my connection with Boston is on my Mother's side, she was born in New Bolingbroke and my Grandfather still lives in Mareham le Fen.\n\nJames Hackett (ahackett#tinyworld+co+uk) I was born in Boston and left in 1966, my family still live there. I live in Melton Mowbray and still visit Boston at every month.\n\nJohn Hague (john#hopeowl+freeserve+co+uk) Born in Hoyland nr. Sheffield in 1964. I've been a Wednesdayite for 30 years this season, but this season has been the final straw as far as being ripped off watching Premiership football is concerned. My first match at York St. was 18/9/99 FA. cup match against Oldbury. I enjoyed my day so much, it was just like football used to be, good freindly atmosphere and lovely pie and peas. I'm born again into non-league football, I only hope after seeing so many second half chances go begging I've not swappped one frustration for another. Up the Pilgrims.\n\nJohn Hale (john.thebastard#virgin+net) I was born and raised in Rotherham, and, for my sins, the \"Millers\" remain closest to my heart. However, after much provocation and threats of violence from Chris Donkin (also listed in these pages), I went to see the \"Pilgrims\" a few seasons ago, and they have taken a prominent place in my affections. I believe the Pilgrims belong in the Conference, and look forward to celebrating their promotion with Chris Donkin, Kevin Riches, Nick Harwood, Barry Peck, Jim Morrison, Kevin Oliver and Keith Harrison very soon.\n\nChristopher Hall (cmhall#talk21+com) I am 17 years old and I have gone to all Boston's home gomes but one this season.\n\nIan Hall (garibaldi#woden+com) I was born in Boston in 1961 & lived in Holbeach until I was 18. I currently live in Dudley in the West Midlands, but have always followed the Pilgrims' results. It's great to see Mark Angel is still playing, as I remember watching him have some great games for WBA. Boston gaining promotion would be a dream come true :-)\n\nLloyd Hall (lloydhall66#hotmail+com) I'm 22 years old and live in Redditch near birmingham. I enjoy coming to watch the Pilgrims when I can as my cousin plays for the team.\n\nPete Hall (hallpeter#yahoo+co+uk) I have been a supporter since the late '80s, and I come from Woodhall Spa, though I am currently doing Maths at Warwick University. I am probably too old now to ever be a match mascot, but I would like to play live at the social club one day.\n\nAdam Hallgarth (DDAM+Hallgarth#currantbun+com) I am 13 years old and I like to go and watch the Pilgrims as much as I can. I recently went to see them in pre-season freindlies and I think that they have a good chance of making the Conference next season.\n\nCaroline Hamerton-Stove (caroline.hamerton-stove#eraa.org) I think Jim Rodwell is so delicious that I am now a recent convert but hugely committed fan of the Pilgrims!\n\nPaul Hancock (paul#hancock.yahoo+co+uk) I'm 12 and I support Coventry City as well as the Pilgrims.\n\nPaul Hardstaff (phardsta#uk+packardbell+org) I have been a Pilgrims fan all my life. I work away and am unable to get to matches. My dad and stepmum went to most of last season's home games. I hold the United board and chairman in high regard because when I was serving in the Gulf most of the lads wrote off to their teams and received photocopied pictures and maybe a badge. Pat Malky and John Blackwell sent me over lots of stuff, a home shirt plus programmes from every game up until I returned home. That's what I call a team and that's why we have great support.\n\nMartin Harries (malcolm#malcolmharries+freeserve+co+uk) Born 1973 in Boston, left with parents 4 years later, when we moved to Faringdon, Oxfordshire. We have always looked for Boston's results and watch the team when they are playing near our area (Gloucester, Bath).\n\nSteve Harries (harries#perth+geco-prakla+slb+com) I lived in Boston from '70-'78 attending Woad Farm and BGS before leaving for Hull University. I regularly attended matches at York Street in the days of Jim Smith, Howard Wilkinson, John Froggatt, Billy Howells et al. Now living and working in Perth, Western Australia (8991 miles from York Street) but still follow the Pilgrims on the net.\n\nEric Hartley (eric+hartley#talk21+com) I have lived in Boston since 1975 and supported the team as often as work permits. The manager has assembled a very strong squad who can play some good football when they put their minds to it. There will be some cracking games at York Street and I intend to be there, all the best.\n\nKarl Hartley (Bambi) (bamblesuk#yahoo+co+uk) I am 17 and I have been a big Boston fan for years, and have been coming with me mate Andy almost every week. Let's get to Division 3. Come on boys.\n\nDave Harvey (daveh#emirates+net+ae) Do I qualify as the furthest away supporter? I work in Dubai UAE (3412 miles from York Street), as a teacher. I was born and raised in Boston, and watched them throughout my teen years before leaving to go to university. I am the club's +1 internet supporter as I am rarely in the UK never mind Boston, and when I am it is usually during the cricket season!\n\nNigel Harvey (nharvey#portables2+ngfl+gov+uk) I live in Wisbech and I am a 33 year old headteacher at a local primary school. I see almost every Saturday home game and around ten away games during the season. I am pleased to hear there are some new directors, maybe they will be joined by new strikers (let's hope so !) Favourite game: semi-final of the FA trophy v Altrincham home and away. Favourite players over the last few years are Phil Brown, Steve Appleby (for his huge effort) and going back quite a few years Dave Adamson and Steve Thompson. Favourite players are currently Steve Charles, Steve Appleby and Joby Gowshall and Baza! I would be interested in hearing from other fans.\n\nPaul Harvey (paul#peninsulaevents+com+au) Supported Boston all my life but I know live in Melbourne, Australia where I have my own Sports & Entertainment Promotions Company. I used to be a goalkeeper for Wyberton Colts, Melton Town, Grantham, Stamford in my youth. My cousin is David Harvey in Dubai - I am the No.1 Internet user of the site. Hopefully coming back for a holiday to the UK to see this historic year in Division Three.\n\nPaul R Harvey (prrv25250#merseymail+com) I am an old Bostonian living and working in Liverpool.\n\nNick Harwood (ntybe062#sonm+nottingham+ac+uk) I am a student in Boston originally from Skegness. I have watched Boston for 5-6 years now and followed them all my life. I would like to say I was disgusted with the chants to get rid of the directors and the rest of the board at the game against Accrington, but I would love to see us in the Conference again.\n\nJames Hawkes (bhdmrjjr#currantbun+co+uk) I live in Wyberton near Steve Appleby and I have played football with him. I play for Wyberton Colts and I go to the Grammar school. I go to see Boston whenever I can.\n\nSam Hazzard (sam#neogensoftware+co+uk) Born in Grimsby, moved to Boston in 1984, joined the Army and moved away to Germany but still like to keep up and go to home games whenever I'm back.\n\nJohn Hewitt (hewitepi#hotmail+com) I now live in Cyprus, after 30 years living in the Boston/Spalding area. During my time there I was the postmaster at Gosberton Risegate for 5 years and was the Landlord of the Wheatsheaf Hotel Swineshead and also worked for Hargrave Int. I used to go to as many Pilgrims games as I could and even after living in Cyprus for 11 years I still check the results every week to see how they are doing.\n\nAdrian Hill (andy+hill#bushinternet+com) I live in Frampton and have been a Pilgrims fan for ten years now. They are the best.\n\nSimon Hill (editor#mcz+com) Born near London, but lived in Old Leake as a teenager, I have been living in California for the past 15# years, but thanks to the web I can still follow the Pilgrim's :)\n\nGary Hinson (daugey#hotmail+com) I watch the Pilgrims every week. My fav player is Bazza.\n\nNeil Hinton (neilhinton#hotmail+com) I'm a student currently on a six month exchange program teaching in Auckland, New Zealand (11287 miles from York Street). I lived in Boston for 7 years until I was 15 when my parents moved because of a job change. Haven't been to a match for quite a while unfortunately but did used to stand on the legendary Town End. Hopefully we'll be seeing Nationwide League football come August 2001!\n\nAdam Hobart (adam#barmy-army+co+uk) I'm 16 years old, I've been supporting United for nine seasons now, and I'd just like to say that even though Stanhope is useless at badminton, he is a great midfielder!\n\nLee Holland (holland_lee#hotmail+com) Me and my boys have been going to Boston every week for about two years, with my main men Bob Harness, Tom Deamer, Ben Parker and Bill Murray. We all stand in the Town End and chant abuse at away fans!\n\nMatt Holland (chunk+holland#talk21+com) I have been a fan as long as I remember, and intend to stay one.\n\nRay Holland (chunk+holland#talk21+com) This is the best season since the great days of the Jim Smith era.\n\nDominic Holliday (S-d+m+holliday#tees+ac+uk) I've lived in Boston for five years now. I go to all the home games when I'm back from University and some away ones whenever the chance arises.\n\nJim Hollinsworth (jhollinsworth153#aol+com) Over recent years I have visited my nephew Ross Frisby (until recently lectuerer at Boston College) who has been living in that great town! Enjoyed the company and the night life especially \"Bentleys\". Made plenty of pals and made guest appearances for the college staff football team. Visited York street of course and now there is a fan base in Glasgow. My mates and myself watched with delight the promotion of Boston and are now looking forward to a few trips to the north of England especially Carlisle to follow the \"Pilgrims\". So look out at the northern matches next season for your own Glasgow supporters branch. Good luck next season!\n\nColum Holtam (me92ch#surrey+ac+uk) I used to support Forest when they were in the Premier, but then they were relegated, so I started supporting Lincoln. Then they were relegated back to the Third, and I saw that Boston were winning, so daddy got me a ticket for the last game. I love that Jonny Gowshall. Boston til I die! Up the pilchards!\n\nRobin Hooton (r+r+a+hooton#ncl+ac+uk) A United regular for the past 4 seasons. My first game was the Canvey Island defeat. I'm currently in my second year at Newcastle University (152 miles from York Street) studying Surveying and Mapping Science. I go to all the home games when I'm back in my home town of Skegness and I also go to important cup games whether home or away. I travel to Blyth - the nearest club to Newcastle - whenever Boston play there.\n\nPaul Horner (pauldhorner#telco4u+net) I am 33 years old and have been a Pilgrims suppo"
