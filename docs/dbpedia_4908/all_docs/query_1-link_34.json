It went up 11% from September to October.’”\n\nOctober 28, 2020: Why don’t people vote? (KSL) “Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics, joined Debbie Dujanovic and Dave Noriega to explain why people don’t vote and why it is so important to do so. Debbie said her take on why people don’t vote is because they think their vote just won’t count for much. She asked Perry if he agreed. ‘That happens so often,’ he said. ‘We hear it all the time: ‘Why would I vote? It doesn’t matter at all, anyway.’ I think you gave the number one reason right there… The reality is, it does.’ When does every vote count? Perry cited the 2018 U.S. House race in Utah when candidate Democrat Ben McAdams narrowly unseated Republican Mia Love by 694 votes.”\n\nOctober 28, 2020: More Utah women are donating to Biden as Trump struggles with female voters (Salt Lake Tribune) “The campaign donations represent a significant shift in the importance of female voters in this presidential election and demonstrate that women are now ‘putting their money where their votes have been,’ said Morgan Lyon Cotti, associate director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah.”\n\nOctober 25, 2020: What did Mitt Romney get right and wrong in his infamous 2016 speech against Donald Trump?

Roles and responsibilities of a VP (ABC4) “‘This is the person who takes office if there’s a death or resignation of the President. That’s primarily it,’ Jason Perry, the Director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics explains. ‘There’s only one constitutional role for the Vice President and that is to preside over the Senate which essentially means this: that person will cast the tie breaking vote if there is a tie in the Senate. Otherwise, they’re not even able to address the Senate unless they’re invited by the Senate itself.

That’s what everyone is talking about, seeing these two candidates together and hearing them discuss the issues,’ he said. When the debate ends at 8:30 tonight, Perry believes the positive afterglow from a successful event should continue for Utah into the future, similar to the long-lasting benefits for the state from the 2002 Olympics.”\n\nOctober 7, 2020: What Utahns will be looking for during the Vice Presidential Debate (KSL) “As all eyes turn to Utah ahead of the one and only Vice Presidential debate, what will Utahns themselves be looking for during Wednesday night’s debate? Hinckley Institute of Politics Director Jason Perry says The Supreme Court, an issue in the 2016 election, is important once again to the state’s voters. ‘They wanted–not everyone–but a majority of Utahns wanted conservative candidates.
