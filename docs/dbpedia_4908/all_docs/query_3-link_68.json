        "text": "Gary_Wills\":j7fpxxmf said:\n\nResults do nothing to ensure value for money. So the entertainment offered last season was essentially a rip off, outwith results.\n\nBut such sentiments from JB could only have any weight if players capable of entertaining in L2 are being brought in. Presently none have.\n\nHow many time have you seen Cowan-Hall play then?\n\nWe were nervous last season because of the disadvantage we started with but this season we can relax abit more and play without the immediate fear of relegation. Cowan hall will help with this style of play, all I think we need is anothet CB with experience (maybe simon king or byron anthony) and a pair of CMs which we needed last season. Over all I think were a midtable side for now and it wont take much to give us a team that could sneak into the playy offs\n\nAnother sound bite from Brent\n\nI know its what he should be saying and trying to drive season ticket sales or what ever they called but the proof is in the pudding if your signing players like feeney and williams your not going to be playing open attacking football instead its the blood and snotters football of the past\n\nCult Of Personality\":1awdpwt4 said:\n\nAnother sound bite from Brent\n\nI know its what he should be saying and trying to drive season ticket sales or what ever they called but the proof is in the pudding if your signing players like feeney and williams your not going to be playing open attacking football instead its the blood and snotters football of the past\n\nI think it difficult to believe that we will be playing entertaining football with some of the players retained, but I'm willing to be surprised. After all as already been expressed we haven't yet seen players like Cowan-Hall in action and you never know, some of our brightest sparks have come from non-league, Noone, Mariner etc\n\nPilgrim\":tyqx4v5p said:\n\nI don't think L2 is the type of league where you can play attractive football, it's a very direct, route one style league. Of course, we all want to watch good, attractive football, but i'd take a Sturrock style promotion just to get us out of this division anyday.\n\nSwindon Town and Torquay and Crewe all played pretty decent football (they played a passing game). I was impressed with Barnet and thought Southend, Crawley Town and Bristol Rovers were entertaining to watch although were much more direct.\n\nI'm quite puzzled by this though:\n\n\"The team defied the odds to avoid relegation last season.\n\n\"The team played an ugly type of football that I take total responsibility for.\n\nI thought James Brent wasn't a football person and came to the club with no previous knowledge or interest in football. I'm not sure how many times he took the training last season and I didn't see him sitting on the bench either so it's just a meaningless soundbite and I think it's been publicised in an attempt to generate more season ticket sales and retain those that have become disinterested."
