        "text": "I hail from Sugar Land, TX and am a proud FBISD product - Colony Bend PIONEERS....(yes, that long ago!), First Colony Bobcats, Elkins Knights! Class of ...... not going to say :). I come from a family of educators (mom - retired FBISD Social Worker, sister - elementary teacher, brother in-law - football coach, dad - Education? Not so much lol). I took the long road into education, but I finally surrendered to the call (and yes teaching is a call!) four years ago. I previously taught English III at George Ranch High School (LCISD). This is my second year at The Flagship!\n\nI attended Stephen F. Austin State University earning my Bachelors of Business Administration in Marketing, minor in Management and my Master's of Arts in Christian Leadership from Dallas Theological Seminary (Houston campus). While I may not coach a sport, I am passionate about coaching the game of life. I became a teacher because investing and fostering development in youth is not something I do, but a code by which I conduct my life.\n\nI'm excited to be a Viking serving as a CTE Business Teacher! In addition to teaching, I co-own Armored Sports - a summer sports camp for kids which employs high school students! (Armored Sports).\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out. Your involvement in your student's academics is necessary and appreciated. Looking forward to a great year! :)\n\n-Mr. Bray"
