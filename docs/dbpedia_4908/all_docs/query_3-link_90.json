        "text": "AFC Wimbledon are entering into uncharted waters when they begin their League One adventure this weekend.\n\nThe Dons are competing in the third tier of English football for the first time since their creation as a phoenix club in 2002.\n\nBolton, Bradford, Charlton, Coventry, Oldham, Sheffield United and Swindon, all of whom once graced the Premier League, are among those Neal Ardley’s side will be facing.\n\nThere is also the small matter of a certain club in Buckinghamshire whose name many Wimbledon fans cannot even bring themselves to utter.\n\nBut who are the favourites for the title, who could find themselves in relegation trouble and which teams have been the most active in the transfer market?\n\nTo find out, our pals at the Coventry Telegraph have spoken to reporters across the country to get the lowdown on each team the Dons will be facing this season.\n\nBolton Wanderers (Phil Parkinson)\n\nMarc Iles, The Bolton News\n\nSummer signings: Chris Taylor, Mark Beevers, Mark Howard and Jamie Proctor.\n\nDepartures: Rob Holding, Neil Danns, Liam Feeney and Emile Heskey.\n\nFans’ expectations: Stability first and foremost. Club nearly hit the wall last season, so while squad should be good enough to reach play-offs, it is not expected.\n\nOne to watch: Zach Clough. The little man has been watched by just about every Premier League club going. If he stays fit, Bolton will do well this season.\n\nRandom fact: Wanderers have spent more seasons in the top flight of English football without winning the title (72) than any other club.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Sheffield United, Bolton; down Rochdale, Scunthorpe, Wimbledon, Oldham.\n\nBradford City (Stuart McCall)\n\nSimon Parker/Bradford Telegraph & Argus\n\nSummer signings: Romain Vincelot, Nathaniel Knight-Percival, Jordy Hiwula, Nicky Law\n\nDepartures: Jamie Proctor, Reece Burke, Josh Cullen, Lee Evans\n\nFans’ expectations: It’s going to be a season of rebuilding after the Phil Parkinson era. I think most fans would be happy with a top-ten finish.\n\nOne to watch: James Hanson was brought to Bradford by McCall in 2009 and should benefit from the manager’s return and a more attack-minded approach.\n\nRandom fact: Stuart McCall has played or managed Bradford City in all four divisions and is now in his fourth spell with the club.\n\nPredictions: - Up Sheffield United, Bolton, Charlton; down Oldham, Wimbledon, Shrewsbury, Fleetwood.\n\nBristol Rovers (Darrell Powell)\n\nJames McNamara, Bristol Post\n\nSummer signings: Byron Moore, Luke James, Peter Hartley\n\nDepartures: Tom Parkes\n\nFans’ expectations: After back-to-back promotions people might have high expectations but they are also realistic – and maybe need a couple of new players to achieve more than mid-table.\n\nOne to watch: Matt Taylor. Fans’ favourite signed a new contract in the summer and has a proven eye for goal, leading the League Two charts last season.\n\nRandom fact: Though officially named the Pirates, people know Bristol Rovers as The Gas because of the smell that used to drift over the stadium from the local gasworks.\n\nPredictions: Up Millwall, Charlton, Sheffield United; down Fleetwood, Chesterfield, Swindon, Northampton.\n\nBury (David Flitcroft)\n\nMikael McKenzie, Bury Times\n\nSummer signings: Ben Williams, Greg Leigh, Leon Barnett, Neil Danns and Nicky Clark\n\nDepartures: Peter Clarke, Chris Hussey, Leon Clarke, Joe Riley and Ryan Lowe.\n\nFans’ expectations: Fans expect to better last season’s points tally and to finish in the top half, but consolidating League One status and sorting financial problems is a must.\n\nOne to watch: Danny Mayor: On his day, the tricky winger is up there with the best in League One. Although he lacks consistency, Mayor has the potential to win matches on his own.\n\nRandom fact: In the last 12 months, manager David Flitcroft has had 10 different goalkeepers at his disposal.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Sheffield United, Millwall; down Chesterfield, Oldham, Port Vale and Shrewsbury.\n\nCharlton (Russell Slade)\n\nRichard Cawley, South London Press\n\nSummer signings: Nicky Ajose, Ricky Holmes, Lee Novak.\n\nDepartures: Nick Pope, Jordan Cousins, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Stephen Henderson, Igor Vetokele.\n\nFans’ expectations: Fancied – especially with the experience of Russell Slade in the Valley hotseat. But they have not get a bedded-in squad after a hectic summer of player upheaval which makes the challenge greater for the former Cardiff and Orient boss. Play-offs should be achieved.\n\nOne to watch: Ricky Holmes. Looks set to be an entertainer and is coming off a blistering season for Northampton Town. Could fill the role of fans’ favourite that hasn’t been filled properly since Yann Kermorgant.\n\nRandom fact: Owner Roland Duchatelet has not been at a Charlton match since October 21 2014 – a 2-1 win over Bolton.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Millwall, Sheffield United; down Northampton, Oldham, Port Vale, Chesterfield.\n\nChesterfield (Danny Wilson)\n\nGraham Smyth, Derbyshire Times and Sheffield Star\n\nSummer signings: Ched Evans, Ryan Fulton, Reece Mitchell, Paul McGinn, Jon Nolan.\n\nDepartures: Drew Talbot, Ollie Banks, Aaron Chapman, Jordan Slew, Chris Herd.\n\nFans’ expectations: To avoid a repeat of last season’s all-too- close brush with relegation, although it&#39;s more hope than expectation. Supporters thus far appear somewhat underwhelmed by summer signings.\n\nOne to watch: Ched Evans will be the most watched and talked about player in the division. After four years out of the game his signing is a gamble, but he’s likely to find the net regularly. October retrial for rape allegation will be pivotal for his season.\n\nRandom fact: Chesterfield FC have banned the Derbyshire Times and Sheffield Star, withdrawing player and manager interviews and access to the press box after local press coverage of financial struggles of a football academy owned by Spireites CEO Chris Turner.\n\nPredictions: Up Sheffield United, Charlton, Millwall, Down: Oldham, Bury, Shrewsbury, Northampton.\n\nCoventry City (Tony Mowbray)\n\nAndy Turner, Coventry Telegraph\n\nSummer signings: Marvin Sordell, Kwame Thomas, Chris McCann, Kyel Reid, Jodi Jones.\n\nDepartures: Romain Vincelot, John Fleck, Aaron Martin, Reda Johnson, Marc-Antoine Fortune.\n\nFans’ expectations: The same as last year really, play-offs minimum but, ultimately, promotion from a more consistent campaign rather than last year’s boom and slump that saw the Sky Blues set the division alight in the first four months and then fall agonisingly short in eighth, just five points off the top-six mix.\n\nOne to watch: Probably not signed him yet. Mowbray will draft in a handful of loans late in the window, as he did last term with Newcastle United's Adam Armstrong going on to get 20 goals. Of the existing group, Jodi Jones is probably the most exciting - a quick and tricky young forward.\n\nRandom fact: The Sky Blues have not finished in the top six of any division for 46 years - beat that for misery!\n\nPredictions: Up Sheffield United, Bolton, Millwall; down Oldham, Shrewsbury, AFC Wimbledon, Rochdale.\n\nFleetwood Town ( Watch this space)\n\nDave Seddon, Lancashire Evening Post\n\nSummer signings: Michael Duckworth, Chris Neal, Ashley Eastham, Alex Cairns, Cian Bolger\n\nDepartures: Chris Maxwell, Tyler Forbes, Shola Ameobi, Stephen Jordan, Antoni Sarcevic\n\nFans’ expectations: Fleetwood fans will be looking for an improvement on 19th place, pushing into mid-table, although there has been plenty of upheaval recently.\n\nOne to watch: Devante Cole (son of Andy Cole) will be looking to nail down a regular first-team spot, has to deliver this season.\n\nRandom fact: Centre-half Nathan Pond has been with Fleetwood since 2003 and has won promotion from six different divisions with them.\n\nPredictions: Up Sheffield United, Charlton, Scunthorpe; down Oldham, Shrewsbury, Port Vale, AFC Wimbledon.\n\nGillingham (Justin Edinburgh)\n\nLuke Cawdell, Medway Messenger\n\nSummer signings: Paul Konchesky, Scott Wagstaff, Billy Knott, Lee Martin and Deji Oshilaja.\n\nDepartures: John Egan, Doug Loft, Jermaine McGlashan and Brennan Dickenson.\n\nFans’ expectations: Gillingham have been improving year on year over the last few seasons and bettering their ninth place finish in League 1 will be what the fans and management will expect.\n\nOne to Watch: Billy Knott: Joined Gills after two years at Bradford and has been given license to attack this season after being asked to do more defensive duties at his former club.\n\nRandom fact: Steve Bruce was about to start life as an apprentice plumber before the Gills signed him on after a trial.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Sheffield United, MK Dons. Down - Fleetwood, Port Vale, Shrewsbury, Wimbledon.\n\nMilton Keynes Dons (Karl Robinson)\n\nToby Lock, MK Citizen\n\nSummer signings: Ed Upson, Paul Downing, George Williams.\n\nDepartures: Carl Baker, Alex Revell, Lee Hodson, Kyle McFadzean.\n\nFans’ expectations: Given the lack of summer signings, the fans are expecting a mid-table finish. If the club decides to put their hands in their pockets, a play-off finish should be a minimum requirement.\n\nOne to watch: Ben Reeves had a difficult, injury-ridden season in the Championship, but shone in League 1. He needs to keep fit, but will be one of the most creative outlets in Dons’ side.\n\nRandom fact: Both Tore Andre Flo and Dietmar Hamann came out of retirement to play for MK Dons. Flo missed the decisive penalty in the play-off semi-final against Scunthorpe.\n\nPredictions: Up Bolton, MK Dons, Oxford; down Bury, Fleetwood, Rochdale, Gillingham.\n\nMillwall (Neil Harris)\n\nRichard Cawley, South London Press\n\nSummer signings: Gregg Wylde, Shaun Hutchinson and David Worrall.\n\nDepartures: Mark Beevers, Lee Martin, Carlos Edwards, Ed Upson.\n\nFans’ expectations: Beaten League One play-off finalists. Boss Neil Harris has kept core performers and they should be top-six material again with the Den an intimidating place for the opposition again.\n\nOne to watch: Steve Morison: Struck up a deadly partnership with Lee Gregory. Scored 19 goals and assisted a load too. A streetwise veteran.\n\nRandom fact: Millwall have a striped shirt – breaking from the traditional all-blue – to replicate the kit worn by the Lions side that went 59 home league games unbeaten half a century ago.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Millwall, Sheffield United; down Northampton, Oldham, Port Vale, Chesterfield.\n\nNorthampton Town (Rob Page)\n\nJames Heneghan, Northampton Chronicle & Echo\n\nSummer signings: Alex Revell, Gabriel Zakuani, Harry Beautyman, Jak McCourt, Aaron Phillips\n\nDepartures: Ricky Holmes, Nicky Adams, Ryan Clarke, Danny Rose\n\nFans’ expectations: Consolidation in League One after promotion. The loss of two key players from last season’s title-winning squad - Ricky Holmes and Nicky Adams - has somewhat tempered expectations.\n\nOne to watch: John-Joe O’Toole. Integral to last season’s success and was voted player of the season. Will need to replicate his efforts this time around if Northampton are to have another successful campaign.\n\nRandom fact: In 1992, a group of Northampton Town fans set up the UK’s first ever supporters’ trust in response to a financial crisis at the club and a series of misleading statements by the then-chairman.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Sheffield United, Bristol Rovers; down Rochdale, Shrewsbury, Oldham, Port Vale\n\nOldham Athletic (Stephen Robinson)\n\nMatt Chambers, Oldham Evening Chronicle\n\nSummer signings: Ryan Flynn, Peter Clarke, Paul Green, Connor Ripley and Billy McKay.\n\nDepartures: Jonathan Forte, Liam Kelly, Joel Coleman, Mike Jones and Timothee Dieng.\n\nFans’ expectations: What are the fans’ expectations this season? Ideally, to get into the top half of the table and have a stab at moving towards the play-off picture. In reality, it’s about hitting 50 points as soon as possible.\n\nOne to watch: Billy Mckay. A striker who is on loan at the club from Wigan, his previous record suggests he is a player capable of scoring goals.\n\nRandom fact: There is a youth team player at the club called Ronaldo Brown. His twin brother is called Rivaldo and there is a sister called Trezeguet.\n\nPredictions: Up Sheffield United, Millwall, Scunthorpe; down Port Vale, Southend, Wimbledon, Bury.\n\nOxford United (Michael Appleton)\n\nDavid Pritchard, Oxford Mail\n\nSummer signings: Wes Thomas, Chris Maguire, Curtis Nelson, Aaron Martin, Simon Eastwood.\n\nDepartures: Kemar Roofe, Callum O’Dowda, Danny Hylton, Johnny Mullins.\n\nFans’ expectations: It’s 15 years since the U’s were last in the third tier, so anything above mid-table would be viewed as a successful season.\n\nOne to watch: John Lundstram. The elegant midfielder pulls the strings for Appleton’s side and has been appointed captain during the summer.\n\nRandom fact: ‘Big’ Ron Atkinson is the club’s record appearance holder, racking up 562 games between 1959 and 1971.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Millwall, Sheffield United; down Fleetwood, Shrewsbury, Wimbledon, Oldham.\n\nPeterborough United (Grant McCann)\n\nAlan Swann, Peterborough Telegraph\n\nSummer signings: Rafa Tafazolli, Gwion Edwards, Brad Inman, Paul Taylor.\n\nDepartures: Gaby Zakuani, Harry Beautyman.\n\nFans’s expectations: They are always high, and usually optimistic. They tend to believe the chairman and manager who will predict promotion.\n\nOne to watch: Marcus Maddison can irritate with some unnecessary theatrics, but he is by far and away the most naturally gifted attacking player in the squad. 11 goals and 13 assists last season, despite Graham Westley’s interference.\n\nRandom fact: Peterborough scored 134 goals in their first season as a Football League club when winning the Fourth Division Championship in 1960-61. It remains a Division Four record.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Sheffield United, Scunthorpe; down Oldham, Port Vale, Wimbledon, Swindon.\n\nPort Vale (Bruno Ribeiro)\n\nRich Sharpe, Stoke Sentinel\n\nSummer signings: Jerome Thomas, Carlos Saleiro, Paulo Tavares, Anthony de Freitas, Kjell Knops.\n\nDepartures: Michael O’Connor, Louis Dodds, Carl Dickinson, Richard Duffy, Ajay Leitch-Smith\n\nFans expectations: Fans are predicting a roller-coaster ride. No-one really knows what to expect given the raft of foreign imports this summer brought in to replace last year’s key men.\n\nOne to watch: Carlos Saleiro is a player the chairman, Norman Smurthwaite, has tipped to bag plenty of goals in League One after signing from Portuguese Second Division outfit Clube Oriental de Lisboa.\n\nRandom fact: Port Vale are of only two league clubs to not be named after a geographic location.\n\nPredictions: -Up Charlton, Millwall, Peterborough. Down - Oldham, Wimbledon, Fleetwood, Bury.\n\nRochdale (Keith Hill)\n\nRichard Partington, Manchester Evening News\n\nSummer signings: Niall Canavan, Harrison McGahey, Oliver Rathbone\n\nDepartures: Oliver Lancashire, Ashley Eastham, Rhys Bennett, Grant Holt\n\nFans’ expectations: The club has over-achieved by challenging for a play-off place in the last two years so another season in which they fall just short of the top six but consolidate their status as a League One club is expected.\n\nOne to watch: Callum Camps emerged as a scorer of great goals from midfield in his first full season last year and is attracting attention from Championship clubs.\n\nRandom fact: Although Rochdale have never won a competition since joining the League in 1921, they have the distinction of playing in the final of the League Cup in 1962, the first of only two teams from the lowest tier to have done so.\n\nPredictions: Up MK Dons, Sheffield United, Oxford; down Bury, Oldham, AFC Wimbledon, Fleetwood.\n\nScunthorpe United (Graham Alexander)\n\nPaul Crute, Scunthorpe Telegraph\n\nSummer signings: Josh Morris, Sam Mantom, Duane Holmes\n\nDepartures: Gary McSheffrey, Niall Canavan, Andrew Boyce, Sean McAllister, Dom Vose\n\nFans’ expectations: After coming so close to making the play-offs last season, it should be the minimum aim for the Iron. With so many of last year’s players still at the club in addition to a couple of quality signings, a top-six finish should be achievable.\n\nOne to watch: Paddy Madden. The Iron’s top scorer last season and one who is expected to score the bulk of the goals. Scored more than 20 last season and Iron need him to match that this season.\n\nRandom fact: The last three seasons Scunthorpe United have started the season at home they have been promoted.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton Athletic, Scunthorpe United and Bradford City, down Oldham, AFC Wimbeldon, Fleetwood Town and Bristol Rovers.\n\nSheffield United (Chris Wilder)\n\nJames Shield, The Star, Sheffield\n\nSummer signings: Leon Clarke, John Fleck, Mark Duffy, Chris Hussey, Jack O’Connell.\n\nDepartures: Jay McEveley, Dean Hammond, Mark Howard, Conor Sammon, David Edgar.\n\nFans’ expectations: Promotion, preferably automatic but via the play-offs at least although United’s record in the end of season knock-outs isn’t good. Wilder’s appointment will guarantee a lot of goodwill though.\n\nOne to watch: Leon Clarke’s arrival brings a different dynamic to a strike force which already included Marc McNulty, Matt Done and Billy Sharp. But John Fleck also looks like being a really smart piece of business.\n\nRandom fact: The Sheffield United Cricket and Football Club was the first English sports club to use 'United' in its name after being founded 127 years ago.\n\nPredictions: Up Millwall, Sheffield United, Charlton Athletic; down Oldham Athletic, Fleetwood Town, Rochdale, Port Vale.\n\nShrewsbury Town (Micky Mellon)\n\nTim Nash, Shropshire Star\n\nSummer signings: Louis Dodds, AJ Leitch-Smith, Joe Riley, Jim O’Brien, Adam El-Abd.\n\nDepartures: Mark Halstead, Nathaniel Knight-Percival, Zak Whitbread, Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro, James Collins.\n\nFans’ expectations: After survival was achieved with one game to spare last season on their return to League One, Town fans are expecting better. A club record 13 home defeats needs to be addressed. Mellon has undertaken another squad revamp and mid-table has to the aim.\n\nOne to watch: Louis Dodds has always impressed against Town for Port Vale and is the sort of established League One performer they need to improve the team.\n\nRandom fact: Last season’s FA Cup fifth round tie against Manchester United was the first time the clubs had ever met competitively.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, Bradford and Sheffield United; down Fleetwood, Rochdale, Swindon, Wimbledon.\n\nSouthend United (Phil Brown)\n\nChris Phillips, Southend Echo\n\nSummer signings: Simon Cox, Mark Oxley, Jason Demetriou and Jermaine McGlashan.\n\nDepartures: Daniel Bentley, Jack Payne and David Worrall\n\nFans’ expectations: According to a poll we’ve run in the paper to finish between seventh and 12 th .\n\nOne to watch: Ryan Leonard. An energetic midfielder who was missed when injured last season.\n\nRandom fact: Plans for a new ground got Government approval in 2008 but building work has yet to start.\n\nPredictions: Up Millwall, Sheff Utd and Charlton; down Oldham, Port Vale, Bury and AFC Wimbledon.\n\nSwindon Town (Luke Williams)\n\nMatt Edwards, Swindon Advertiser\n\nSummer signings: John Goddard, Lawrence Vigouroux, Conor Thomas.\n\nDepartures: Nicky Ajose, Miles Storey, Michael Smith, Ty Belford, Fabien Robert.\n\nFans’ expectations: The expectations span the breadth of the spectrum, from promotion-pushers to staving off relegation. Realistically, most will be happy with a top-half finish.\n\nOne to watch: John Goddard. The new signing from Woking has impressed in pre-season. A No.10 who likes to receive the ball on the edge of the box.\n\nRandom fact: Swindon Town are the only team in the Football League who don’t have a letter that appears in the word mackerel.\n\nPredictions: Up Charlton, MK Dons, Millwall; down Oxford, Shrewsbury, Oldham, Fleetwood.\n\nWalsall (Jon Whitney)\n\nJoe Masi, Express & Star\n\nSummer signings: Simeon Jackson, Erhun Oztumer, Florent Cuvelier, George Dobson, Jason McCarthy.\n\nDepartures: Tom Bradshaw, Romaine Sawyers, Sam Mantom, Jason Demetriou, Milan Lalkovic.\n\nFans’ expectations: To lay foundations for another promotion push. A long-term plan to get to the Championship ended last season with Saddlers missing out by a point. With the majority of that squad having moved on, a new project is underway.\n\nOne to watch: Erhun Oztumer: He may only be 5ft 3in but the man nicknamed ‘Turkish Messi’ by Peterborough fans looks destined to shine in the No.10 role. Pre-season suggests he will be central to Walsall’s attacking play.\n\nRandom fact: Walsall’s record fee spent on a player dates way to 1979 when they paid Birmingham £175,000 for all-time top goalscorer Alan Buckley."
