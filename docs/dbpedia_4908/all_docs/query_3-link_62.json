        "text": "PETER HARTLEY was left shaking his head in disbelief after Hartlepool were pegged back by Bristol Rovers.\n\nPools were 2-0 up with their cigars out thanks to goals from Joe Gamble and sub Antony Sweeney.\n\nBut the outplayed Gasheads sparked into life with late headers from Jo Kuffour and Byron Anthony to leave Pools and Hartley reflecting on what might have been after seeing another lead go down the drain.\n\nIt was the second time Pools have let a two-goal lead slip at Victoria Park this season after squandering an identical cushion against Swindon.\n\n“It feels like a defeat and leaves a bitter taste in the mouth,” said central defender Hartley after the 2-2 draw.\n\n“It was the same at Leyton Orient last week when they scored a late winner.\n\n“The game was over and the lads had worked really hard and made them look like a bang average team - and we know Bristol Rovers are a good team, we saw that last year here.\n\n“Up to the 80 minute mark I thought we were absolutely fantastic, pressed the ball really well and Colin Larkin up front and the midfielders were different class.\n\n“Then something just happened in the last 10 minutes. As soon as they scored they smelled blood, went for the jugular and got the second goal.\n\n“It feels like a horrible defeat to be honest with you.”\n\nBoss Mick Wadsworth is hoping inconsistent Pools will finally learn their lessons the hard way.\n\n“When you look back over a long period of time the pattern here has been win, lose, draw or win, lose, win - there is never any really consistent strings of results,” he said.\n\n“It’s a big lesson hopefully - again - that we have to be more rugged, resolute and ruthless and they are the qualities you need at that time of the game.\n\n“It’s very disappointing.”\n\nPools were far and away the better side but missed a swathe of chances before Sweeney put them two up with a cool low finish.\n\nKuffour’s looping header gave Rovers hope and Anthony nodded in to level from Stuart Campbell’s free-kick to leave Pools feeling deflated.\n\n“Of course it feels like a defeat,” said Wadsworth, who had seen Jonathan Tehoue scored from an 88th minute corner as Pools lost their previous game 1-0 at Leyton Orient.\n\n“That’s three points dropped due to set plays in the last two weeks late in the game.\n\n“It’s really disappointing and our defensive home record is poor.\n\n“Whether I now need to look at a change in terms of trying to bring someone else in, I don’t know.\n\n“I will have to think about that. We think we are on the right track, then we get 15 minutes at the end of the game like that when we defended very poorly from front to back.\n\n“I do truly believe we could have seen the game out easily but I still felt there was a lot to do.”\n\nPools have received a good home draw to face Vauxhall Motors in the first round of the FA Cup early next month.\n\nThe Merseyside-based Motormen set up their trip to Victoria Park by edging past Newcastle Town 1-0 on Saturday thanks to a 68th minute David Mannix goal.\n\nPools will monitor Evan Horwood this week after the left-back came off early against Bristol Rovers with a groin problem.\n\nPOOLS: Kean, Austin, Collins, Horwood (Bjornsson 64), Hartley, Liddle, McSweeney, Gamble (Sweeney 76), Monkhouse, Murray, Larkin (Poole 76)."
