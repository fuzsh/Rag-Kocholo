        "text": "American football player (born 1982)\n\n\"Roethlisberger\" redirects here. For the surname, see Roethlisberger (surname).\n\nAmerican football player\n\nBenjamin Todd Roethlisberger Sr. ( ; born March 2, 1982), nicknamed \"Big Ben\", is an American former football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played college football for the Miami RedHawks, and was selected by the Steelers in the first round (11th overall) of the 2004 NFL draft.\n\nRoethlisberger earned the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2004 and his first Pro Bowl selection in 2007. In 2006, he became the youngest Super Bowl–winning quarterback in NFL history, leading the Steelers, in his second season, to a 21–10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XL at the age of 23. Roethlisberger led the Steelers to a second Super Bowl title in four seasons as they defeated the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII, 27–23, after completing a game-winning touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes with 35 seconds left in the game. He appeared in his third Super Bowl in Super Bowl XLV, but the team lost by a score of 31–25 to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nRoethlisberger was one of the most prolific passers in NFL history. Upon retirement, he ranked 5th all-time in NFL career passing yards (64,088),[2] 8th all-time in touchdowns (418), and 5th in completions (5,440) among quarterbacks with a minimum of 1,500 career attempts. He also had the fourth-highest career winning percentage (.710) as a starter in the regular season among quarterbacks with a minimum of 100 starts and was one of six quarterbacks in NFL history to have beaten at least 31 of the current 32 NFL teams.[3]\n\nKnown for playing outside the passing pocket in what he calls \"backyard football\",[4] Roethlisberger grew up idolizing John Elway and has often been compared to him, wearing number 7 in his honor.[5][6]\n\nEarly life\n\nAt Findlay High School in Findlay, Ohio, Roethlisberger was captain of the Trojans' football, basketball, and baseball teams. Roethlisberger did not play quarterback until his senior year, giving way to the coach's son, Ryan Hite. Instead, Roethlisberger played wide receiver. \"I'm a nationally known knucklehead in many people's eyes,\" Hite conceded in a 2004 interview to the Toledo Blade but insisted his decision had not been an act of nepotism, or miscalculation.[7] \"We did a bunch of drills and my son throwing to Ben was a better combination,\" he said.[7]\n\nKen Roethlisberger, a former Georgia Tech quarterback, never publicly criticized Hite for playing Ryan ahead of his son Ben. He has stated, \"It was a coach's call. You make good ones, you make bad ones. And I'm not even saying this was a bad one. We can say it was now, but how do we know for sure?\" Ryan Hite went on to Denison University where, as a wide receiver, set numerous career and single-season records by the time he graduated from college.[7]\n\nCollege career\n\n2000–2001\n\nRoethlisberger played college quarterback at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. After arriving at Miami in 2000, he was redshirted his first season.[8] In the 2001 season, he made his collegiate debut against Michigan, completing 18 of 35 passes for 193 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–13 loss.[9] Against Akron, he broke the school single-game passing record with 399 passing yards, with 70 of those yards coming on a Hail Mary to Eddie Tillitz to win the game by a score of 30–27 as time expired.[10] When Miami played Bowling Green, he had two touchdowns and 305 passing yards and broke the MAC freshman passing yardage record in the 24–21 victory.[11] Against Hawaii, he broke school records for attempts, completions, and yardage, when he went 40 of 53 for 452 yards and three touchdowns in the 52–51 loss.[12] He finished his first year with the Redhawks with 3,105 passing yards, 241 completions, and 25 touchdown completions while leading them to a 7–5 record.[13][14]\n\n2002\n\nRoethlisberger's second season as the RedHawks starter was marked with a 7–5 record once again.[15] He broke the MAC single-game record for passing yards in a 48–41 loss against Northern Illinois on October 12 when he threw for 525 yards and four touchdowns.[16] He won the MAC East Special Teams Player of the Week for three punts that landed inside the 20 in the 27–13 victory over Toledo.[17][18] He established the Miami single-season record with 3,238 passing yards and 271 completions in 2002.[13]\n\n2003\n\nAfter starting the season with a loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes, Roethlisberger led the Miami RedHawks to an unbeaten record in the MAC, 12 consecutive wins, a #10 ranking in the Associated Press poll, and a 49–28 victory over Louisville in the 2003 GMAC Bowl.[19][20] He finished his 2003 season with a conference-leading 343 completions, 4,486 passing yards, and 37 passing touchdowns, breaking school single-season records in all three categories.[13] He was named as the MAC Offensive Player of the Year for the 2003 season.[21]\n\nHis jersey number number 7 was retired by the RedHawks during homecoming on October 13, 2007; the festivities included the RedHawks football game against Bowling Green. Roethlisberger became the third athlete in Miami football history to have his number retired, joining John Pont and Bob Hitchens. Roethlisberger's number being retired was the first time in 34 years Miami retired a football jersey number.[22][23]\n\nCollege statistics\n\nSeason Games Passing Rushing GP Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A TD Int Att Yds Avg TD 2000 0 — Redshirt 2001 12 7–5 241 381 63.3 3,105 8.1 21 2 120 189 1.6 3 2002 12 7–5 271 428 63.3 3,238 7.6 22 11 82 54 0.7 1 2003 14 13–1 342 495 69.1 4,486 9.1 37 10 67 111 1.7 3 Career 38 27–11 854 1,304 65.5 10,829 8.3 80 23 269 354 1.3 7\n\nMiami Redhawks records\n\nAll records are from the Miami University 2008 media guide.[24]\n\nProfessional career\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 40-yard dash Wonderlic 6 ft 4+7⁄8 in\n\n(1.95 m) 241 lb\n\n(109 kg) 31+1⁄2 in\n\n(0.80 m) 9+3⁄8 in\n\n(0.24 m) 4.75 s 25 All values from NFL Combine[26][27][28][29]\n\nWhen ESPN began broadcasting MAC games on Tuesdays and Wednesdays—days without other football on television—in 2000, nationwide \"MACtion\" audiences watched Roethlisberger's teams.[30] The success of the 2003 Miami Redhawks led to the expectation that he would be drafted early. At the combine, Roethlisberger scored a 25 on the Wonderlic.[31] During the GMAC Bowl, commentators discussed some of his skills that would translate to success in the NFL. Roethlisberger was one of the players invited to attend the draft along with others in the \"Green Room\" and was featured on the show Hey Rookie, Welcome to the NFL.[32]\n\nDuring the 2004 NFL draft, Roethlisberger was the second-highest touted quarterback behind Ole Miss' Eli Manning. He was projected to be taken by the New York Giants as the fourth overall pick, with the San Diego Chargers taking Manning first overall.[33] While the Chargers drafted Manning, the Giants instead selected NC State quarterback Philip Rivers as part of a trade deal that sent Manning to the Giants and Rivers to the Chargers. The Pittsburgh Steelers selected Roethlisberger 11th overall, making him the highest-drafted quarterback to play for the team that picked him, and the highest draft pick the Steelers used on a quarterback since selecting Terry Bradshaw first overall in 1970.[34][35]\n\nThe Steelers almost didn't select Roethlisberger, as head coach Bill Cowher and director of football operations Kevin Colbert had planned to select Arkansas guard Shawn Andrews. However, Steelers owner Dan Rooney overrode both Cowher and Colbert upon seeing that Roethlisberger was still available and the Steelers not wanting a repeat of passing on a franchise quarterback, as they had done in the 1983 NFL draft when they drafted Gabriel Rivera while local product Dan Marino was still available.[36] Roethlisberger was being interviewed live on ESPN by Suzy Kolber when he received the phone call from Cowher, confirming his selection before it was officially announced by Paul Tagliabue.[37]\n\nRoethlisberger was one of 17 quarterbacks taken in the 2004 NFL Draft, along with Manning and Rivers.[34] All three would enjoy lengthy and successful careers with the teams that signed them and have been compared favorably to the aforementioned 1983 Draft, which included Hall of Fame quarterbacks John Elway, Jim Kelly, and Marino.[38] A two-time Super Bowl winner and six-time Pro Bowler, Roethlisberger leads the three in wins, winning percentage, and postseason appearances, and had the longest career among them.[27][39][40][34]\n\n2004\n\nSee also: 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nOn August 4, Roethlisberger signed a six-year contract to the Steelers worth $22.26 million in salaries and bonuses, with an additional $17.73 million available via incentives. He was touted by Steelers head coach Bill Cowher in a press conference as a franchise quarterback.[41]\n\nHe started his rookie season as the third quarterback on the depth chart behind veterans Tommy Maddox and Charlie Batch. When Batch was injured in the preseason, however, Roethlisberger took over the backup quarterback role. Maddox started, and won, the season opener against the Oakland Raiders and started versus the Baltimore Ravens, but after an ineffective outing and third-quarter injury to Maddox, Roethlisberger stepped in for his first NFL action.[42] Despite spurring a mild comeback, the Steelers lost to the Ravens by a score of 30–13. In his regular season debut against the Ravens, Roethlisberger completed 12 of 20 passes for 176-yards and two touchdowns, and two interceptions. During the game, he threw his first career touchdown, on a three-yard pass to Antwaan Randle El and also threw his first career interception to Ravens linebacker Adalius Thomas.[43] Maddox's injury changed the Steelers' original plan for Roethlisberger, which was for him to sit on the bench or play sparingly during the first season or two in order to learn the team's system. Instead, he started the third game of the season against the Miami Dolphins, finishing the 13–3 victory with 12 of 22 completions, 163 passing yards, one touchdown, and an interception.[44] In Week 6, in a 24–20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, he was 21 of 25 for 193 passing yards and two touchdowns to earn his first AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[45][46]\n\nAs a rookie, he went 13–0 in the regular season (14–1 including playoffs) as a starting quarterback, helping the Steelers become the first AFC team to have 15 wins (2–1 under Maddox [first two and last game], 13–0 under Roethlisberger) in a single regular season, surpassing former Steeler Mike Kruczek for the record for the best start by a rookie (6–0) and exceeding the mark for total wins as a rookie, set by Chris Chandler and Joe Ferguson.[47] On January 5, Roethlisberger was unanimously selected as the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press, the first quarterback in 34 years to be so honored.[48] In addition, he was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.[49]\n\nOn October 31, he had one of his biggest games, leading the Steelers to a 34–20 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion and previously undefeated New England Patriots, ending their NFL-record 21-game winning streak. He completed 18 of 24 pass attempts for 196 yards, two touchdowns, and no turnovers.[50] The next game, the Steelers defeated the also previously undefeated Philadelphia Eagles 27–3, with Roethlisberger going 11 of 18 for 183 yards, with two touchdowns and one interception.[51]\n\nOn December 5, he led the Steelers to a 17–16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was near-perfect on the night, completing 14 of 17 passes for 226 yards and two touchdowns. Jeff Reed's 37-yard field goal in the final minute gave the Steelers and Roethlisberger their tenth straight win.[52]\n\nTwo weeks later, Roethlisberger faced off against the New York Giants and the first overall pick of the 2004 draft, Eli Manning. Roethlisberger posted his first career 300-yard passing game, with 18 of 28 passes for 316 yards and a touchdown. He led his fifth game-winning drive of the season, capping a drive with a Jerome Bettis touchdown run for a 33–30 victory.[53]\n\nIn the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the New York Jets, Roethlisberger threw two interceptions. One interception was returned for a touchdown, and the other was thrown with 2:03 left in the fourth quarter, which set up a potential game-winning field goal by Jets kicker Doug Brien. Brien missed the kick as time expired (his second missed kick in the last two minutes of the game), forcing the game into overtime. In overtime, Roethlisberger led the Steelers down the field and put them in position for the game-winning field goal, a 33-yard attempt that was made by Jeff Reed, sending the Steelers into the AFC Championship for the fourth time in 10 years.[54]\n\nOn January 23 in the AFC Championship Game in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger completed 14 of 24 pass attempts for 226 yards and two touchdowns, but he also threw three costly interceptions, one of which was returned 87 yards for a touchdown by Rodney Harrison.[55] The Steelers lost the game to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the New England Patriots, by a score of 41–27.[56]\n\n2005: First Super Bowl championship\n\nSee also: 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nIn the 2005 regular season, the Steelers finished with an 11–5 record. After securing an AFC Wild Card spot en route to victory in the Super Bowl, the Steelers pulled off upsets at Indianapolis and Denver in the AFC playoffs in addition to wins over the higher seed Cincinnati Bengals and Seattle Seahawks.[57]\n\nDuring the course of the regular 2005 season, Roethlisberger missed four games due to various knee injuries.[58] The Steelers went 9–3 with Roethlisberger at quarterback and 2–2 without him. He led the league in yards per attempt, with an 8.90, and finished third in passer rating behind Peyton Manning and Carson Palmer with a 98.6.[59]\n\nThe Super Bowl run began on January 8 as Roethlisberger helped lead the Steelers to a Divisional Round playoff win over the Cincinnati Bengals—an AFC North rival that had beaten the Steelers by seven points in the regular season to win the division championship. The rematch featured two teams with identical records, having split their regular season series since each team won on the road. Early in the game on Carson Palmer's first throw, a tackle by former Bengal Kimo von Oelhoffen resulted in Palmer's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) being completely torn.[60] The Bengals' backup quarterback, Jon Kitna, came in and led the Bengals to leads of 10–0 and 17–7. However, the 17–7 lead midway through the second quarter was the last time in the 2005 postseason that the Steelers trailed an opponent by more than three points. After Kitna failed to produce, the Steelers took advantage by taking the next 24 straight points, and the win, in a 31–17 victory in Cincinnati.[61]\n\nTheir second road win came on January 15 when Roethlisberger led the Steelers against the Indianapolis Colts in the Divisional Round, the NFL's top team throughout the season and a heavy favorite to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger threw for 197 yards and recorded a game-saving tackle on Colts' defensive back Nick Harper, who had just recovered a Jerome Bettis fumble with less than two minutes left in the game. Pittsburgh led early but had to survive a Colts comeback to win 21–18, after an errant call that the NFL later admitted was a mistake,[62] which overturned a Troy Polamalu interception that would have secured the game for the Steelers. Roethlisberger's tackle on Harper, dubbed by many as The Tackle II or The Immaculate Redemption, was compared by many to \"The Immaculate Reception\" in 1972, when Franco Harris made a miraculous reception and scored the game-winning touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. The victory marked the first time in playoff history that a sixth-seeded NFL playoff team defeated the top-seeded team.[63]\n\nOn January 22, 2006, the Steelers defeated the Denver Broncos by a score of 34–17 in Denver to win the AFC Championship and advance to Super Bowl XL. Roethlisberger completed 21 of 29 passes for 275 yards and threw two touchdown passes and scored one touchdown himself on a four-yard play-action bootleg. His run was the last touchdown of the game, sealing the win for the Steelers.[64]\n\nThe Steelers won Super Bowl XL 21–10 over the Seattle Seahawks in Detroit on February 5.[65] Roethlisberger had one of the worst passing games of his career, completing just nine of 21 passes for 123 yards and two interceptions; his passer rating of 22.6 was the lowest in Super Bowl history by a winning quarterback. Though he did convert eight third-down situations in the game to help the Steelers win, none of them was bigger than his 37-yard pass to Super Bowl XL MVP Hines Ward on a third-and-28 that set up the Steelers' first touchdown (a one-yard quarterback sneak by Roethlisberger on third and goal). With the victory, Roethlisberger, at 23 years old, became the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, a record previously held by Tom Brady of the New England Patriots.[66][67]\n\n2006\n\nSee also: 2006 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nAfter an off-season motorcycle crash in which he was seriously injured, Roethlisberger missed the opening game of the 2006 season after having an emergency appendectomy on September 3.[68] Backup Charlie Batch started and led the Steelers to a victory over the Miami Dolphins. Roethlisberger played the following game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. His return resulted in a sub-par performance as he threw two interceptions with no touchdowns in a 9–0 loss.[69] In Week 3, Roethlisberger completed fewer than half of his passes for three interceptions and no touchdowns in a 28–20 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals. The final interception came in the final seconds of the game, in the end zone, ending Pittsburgh's comeback attempt.[70]\n\nIn Week 5 against the San Diego Chargers, Roethlisberger looked sharp throughout the first half, leading three scoring drives. However, in the second half, he threw two interceptions, both of which shifted momentum away from the Steelers and led to the Chargers' 23–13 win.[71] In Week 6 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roethlisberger had his first big game of the season, completing 16 of 19 passes for 238 yards with two touchdowns (his first of the year) and no interceptions during a 45–7 rout of the Chiefs.[72] During Week 7 in Atlanta, Roethlisberger continued his success, going 16 of 22 for 237 yards and three touchdowns.[73] However, during the third quarter, Roethlisberger was helped off the field after sustaining a concussion following a controversial hit by Falcons defensive end Patrick Kerney. Roethlisberger was replaced by Charlie Batch, and the Steelers went on to lose 41–38 in overtime.[74]\n\nOn October 29 against the Oakland Raiders, Roethlisberger threw four interceptions in a 20–13 upset loss.[75] The loss was his fifth of the season—two more than he had in his first two seasons combined as a starter—and gave him a total of 11 interceptions, versus just six touchdowns, on the season.

In many parts of the field, players sunk several inches with each step. After one of the game's punts, the ball infamously stood straight up, stuck in the ground upon impact. With the game scoreless in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger led a game-winning field goal drive for the only points of the night.[91]\n\nRoethlisberger threw his 29th touchdown pass of the season in Week 15 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, breaking the team single-season touchdown pass record previously held by Bradshaw.[92] In Week 16 against the St. Louis Rams, Roethlisberger became the first quarterback in NFL history to have two perfect passer rating (158.3) games in the same regular season, completing 16 of 20 passes for 261 yards and three touchdowns.

The Steelers could not hold three leads in the fourth quarter. They led 10–6, 17–13 and 24–20. It was the fifth loss of the season in which they surrendered the lead in the final quarter.[123]\n\nOn a frigid Thursday night in Cleveland in Week 14, Roethlisberger was sacked 8 times and did not lead a touchdown drive in his first career loss to Cleveland, ending a perfect 10–0 record against the rival Browns. It is the first time he lost four straight starts.[124]\n\nIn Week 15 against the Green Bay Packers, Roethlisberger broke several franchise passing records in ending the five-game losing streak for the Steelers with the biggest passing day in franchise history. His first pass of the day was a 60-yard touchdown to Mike Wallace, and his last pass was a game-winning 19-yard touchdown to Wallace on the final play of the game. He passed for 503 yards, three touchdowns, and had no turnovers.[125] He broke Terry Bradshaw's single-season record of 3,724 passing yards, and set a new mark for single-season completions (302).

The play was ruled a touchdown on the field, but reviews showed Roethlisberger had fumbled short of the end zone. However, the review failed to provide conclusive evidence as to who recovered the ball after the fumble. By rule, possession was given to Pittsburgh, resulting in the game-winning field goal. Roethlisberger passed for 302 yards and 2 touchdowns in the game. \"Just a bizarre kind of play. You hate to win it that way, but you'll take a win,\" Roethlisberger said.[133][134]\n\nIn Week 8 against the New Orleans Saints, Roethlisberger, playing in his 90th regular season game, reached the 20,000-yard passing mark, but failed to throw a touchdown pass as the Steelers lost on Halloween night in the Superdome.[135][136] Roethlisberger improved to 8–2 as a starter on Monday Night Football in Week 9 against the Cincinnati Bengals, and 63–27 over his first 90 regular season starts (tied with Jim McMahon for third-highest win percentage through a player's first 90 starts).[137] Roethlisberger passed for a season-high 387 yards and 3 touchdowns in the Week 10, 39–26 loss, to the New England Patriots, but also had an interception returned for a score and was sacked five times as he tried to rally the Steelers from a 23–3 deficit in the second half.[138]\n\nIn his first win over the Oakland Raiders in Week 11, Roethlisberger passed for 275 yards and three touchdowns, and rushed for a career-high 55 yards and a[139] touchdown.

The Steelers closed to within 21–17 in the third quarter, but were unable to score on their next three drives. After falling behind, 28–17, in the fourth quarter, Roethlisberger threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace, and then pitched the ball to Antwaan Randle El on an option run for the two-point conversion to make it 28–25. Taking over at his own 13 with 1:59 left and down 31–25, Roethlisberger was unable to lead the game-winning drive against Green Bay this time after his pass fell incomplete to Wallace on 4th and 5 at his own 33-yard line, ensuring the first Super Bowl loss of his career. Roethlisberger finished the 31–25 loss 25 of 40 for 263 yards, 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. \"I feel like I let the city of Pittsburgh down, the fans, my coaches and my teammates,\" Roethlisberger said, \"and it's not a good feeling.\"[147] In the off-season, he was ranked 41st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[148]\n\n2011\n\nSee also: 2011 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nIn Week 1 against the Baltimore Ravens, Roethlisberger set career-worsts for turnovers (5) and largest margin of defeat (28) in his first loss against the Ravens since 2006.[149] In Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks, he became the fourth quarterback to reach 70 wins in his first 100 starts, as he threw for 298 yards and did not turn the ball over.

He returned for the second half and played the rest of the game, despite limping on his high-ankle sprain. He threw a game-clinching 79-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown late in the fourth quarter as the Steelers won 14–3. Roethlisberger finished with 280 yards passing on just 21 attempts for a career-high 13.33 YPA (min. 15 attempts).[159] On the injury, Roethlisberger said, \"It was one of the most painful things I ever felt. It felt like the middle of my leg was just, cracked ... it felt like my foot was outside of my leg.\"[160] In Week 15 against the San Francisco 49ers, Roethlisberger started the game while suffering through a high-ankle sprain. During the game, it was clear that Roethlisberger was still showing signs of the injury due to him limping between plays. He finished the game without any touchdowns but had 330 yards passing while throwing three interceptions.[161]\n\nBecause of Roethlisberger's leg injury from Week 14, the team opted to sit him and start Charlie Batch in the Week 16 game against the St. Louis Rams, giving Roethlisberger more time to recover.[162]\n\nIn Week 17 against the Cleveland Browns, just three weeks after the Browns injured Roethlisberger in Pittsburgh, Roethlisberger once again took the field to face the same opponents in their home stadium. The Steelers opted to start Roethlisberger over Batch because of the possibility that Baltimore could drop its final game, and a win by the Steelers would take back the division title. Despite his injury, Mike Tomlin and the coaching staff believed Roethlisberger gave them their best chance at victory. Big Ben completed 23 of 40 passes for 221 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. Baltimore went on to win their final game and secured the division title, leaving Steelers with the number 5 seed to face Denver in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.[163]\n\nIn the Wild Card Round against the Denver Broncos, Roethlisberger and the Steelers offense battled a tough Denver defense, trailing 20–6 at the half but tying it at 23–23 before the end of regulation.

He had 384 passing yards and four touchdowns in the 34–31 loss.[168] He missed three games due to injury, being replaced by Byron Leftwich, who went 0–1, and Charlie Batch, who went 1–1. It was the Steelers first season missing the playoffs since 2009 and their first with a non-winning record since 2006.[169] He finished ranked 61st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[170]\n\nIn 2012, Roethlisberger returned to Miami University to complete his college degree, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Education on May 6, 2012. Roethlisberger walked with the other graduates at the commencement ceremony, with his parents, grandmother, and wife Ashley in attendance.[171] He had planned on finishing his degree sooner, but the Steelers having deep playoff runs earlier in his career prevented him from registering for classes in time for the winter term, only being able to do it after the Steelers were eliminated in the Wild Card round against the Denver Broncos the previous season.[171] Roethlisberger became the second member of the Steelers in less than a year to return to college and complete his degree, with teammate Polamalu doing the same thing the previous off-season during the 2011 NFL lockout.[172]\n\n2013\n\nSee also: 2013 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nRoethlisberger threw for 4,261 yards and 28 touchdowns in 16 games in 2013 as the Steelers finished the season with an 8–8 record.[173][174] In Week 11, in a 37–27 victory over the Detroit Lions, he had 367 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[175][176] The Steelers would go on to miss the playoffs after the San Diego Chargers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime in Week 17.[177] This would also be the first time they missed the playoffs in back-to-back seasons since 1999 and the first time under Mike Tomlin.[178] Roethlisberger was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[179]\n\n2014\n\nSee also: 2014 Pittsburgh Steelers season\n\nRoesthilsberger started the 2014 season with a 4–3 record in the first seven games.[180] On October 26, 2014, against the Indianapolis Colts, Roethlisberger completed 40 of 49 passes for a career-high 522 yards and six touchdowns as the Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts 51–34.[181] With the win, Roethlisberger became just the fourth quarterback in NFL history to get 100 wins in his first 150 starts.[182] He also became the first NFL quarterback to pass for over 500 yards twice in a career.

Second off, I'm pretty content with where I'm at.\"[277] In March 2023, Roethlisberger revealed to Mark Madden however that the San Francisco 49ers did show some interest after suffering injuries with Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo left Brock Purdy as the starting quarterback, but Roethlisberger declined.[278]\n\nNFL career statistics\n\nLegend Won the Super Bowl Led the league Bold Career high\n\nRegular season\n\nYear Team Games Passing Rushing Sacked Fumbles GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A Lng TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg Lng TD Sck YdsL Fum Lost 2004 PIT 14 13 13–0 196 295 66.4 2,621 8.9 58 17 11 98.1 56 144 2.6 20 1 30 213 2 2 2005 PIT 12 12 9–3 168 268 62.7 2,385 8.9 85 17 9 98.6 31 69 2.2 13 3 23 129 2 1 2006 PIT 15 15 7–8 280 469 59.7 3,513 7.5 67 18 23 75.4 32 98 3.1 20 2 46 280 5 2 2007 PIT 15 15 10–5 264 404 65.3 3,154 7.8 83 32 11 104.1 35 204 5.8 30T 2 47 347 9 3 2008 PIT 16 16 12–4 281 469 59.9 3,301 7.0 65 17 15 80.1 34 101 3.0 17 2 46 284 14 7 2009 PIT 15 15 9–6 337 506 66.6 4,328 8.6 60 26 12 100.5 40 82 2.1 15 2 50 348 7 3 2010 PIT 12 12 9–3 240 389 61.7 3,200 8.2 56 17 5 97.0 34 176 5.2 31 2 32 220 7 3 2011 PIT 15 15 11–4 324 513 63.2 4,077 7.9 95 21 14 90.1 31 70 2.3 11 0 40 269 8 5 2012 PIT 13 13 7–6 284 449 63.3 3,265 7.3 82 26 8 97.0 26 92 3.5 14 0 30 182 6 3 2013 PIT 16 16 8–8 375 584 64.2 4,261 7.3 67 28 14 92.0 27 99 3.7 19 1 42 282 9 6 2014 PIT 16 16 11–5 408 608 67.1 4,952 8.1 94 32 9 103.3 33 27 0.8 8 0 33 172 9 5 2015 PIT 12 11 7–4 319 469 68.0 3,938 8.4 69 21 16 94.5 15 29 1.9 13 0 20 141 2 0 2016 PIT 14 14 10–4 328 509 64.4 3,819 7.5 72 29 13 95.4 16 14 0.9 14 1 17 141 8 2 2017 PIT 15 15 12–3 360 561 64.2 4,251 7.6 97 28 14 93.4 28 47 1.7 14 0 21 139 3 1 2018 PIT 16 16 9–6–1 452 675 67.0 5,129 7.6 97 34 16 96.5 31 98 3.2 18 3 24 166 7 2 2019 PIT 2 2 0–2 35 62 56.5 351 5.7 45 0 1 66.0 1 7 7.0 7 0 2 7 1 0 2020 PIT 15 15 12–3 399 608 65.6 3,803 6.3 84 33 10 94.1 25 11 0.4 11 0 13 118 5 1 2021 PIT 16 16 9–7 390 605 64.5 3,740 6.2 59 22 10 86.8 20 5 0.3 8 1 38 239 11 5 Career 249 247 165–81–1 5,440 8,443 64.4 64,088 7.6 97 418 211 93.5 515 1,373 2.7 31 20 554 3,677 115 51\n\nPostseason\n\nYear Team Games Passing Rushing Sacked Fumbles GP GS Record Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A Lng TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg Lng TD Sck YdsL Fum Lost 2004 PIT 2 2 1–1 31 54 57.4 407 7.5 34 3 5 61.3 9 75 8.3 20 0 2 11 1 0 2005 PIT 4 4 4–0 58 93 62.4 803 8.6 54 7 3 101.7 19 37 1.9 10 2 6 35 0 0 2007 PIT 1 1 0–1 29 42 69.0 337 8.0 37 2 3 79.2 4 13 3.3 6 0 6 40 1 1 2008 PIT 3 3 3–0 54 89 60.7 692 7.8 65 3 1 91.6 5 0 0.0 4 0 8 58 0 0 2010 PIT 3 3 2–1 54 91 59.3 622 6.8 58 4 4 76.4 21 63 3.0 18 1 9 48 3 1 2011 PIT 1 1 0–1 22 40 55.0 289 7.2 33 1 1 75.9 3 15 5.0 9 0 5 45 1 0 2014 PIT 1 1 0–1 31 45 68.9 334 7.4 44 1 2 79.3 2 16 8.0 16 0 5 37 0 0 2015 PIT 2 2 1–1 42 68 61.8 568 8.4 60 1 0 93.3 0 0 0.0 0 0 6 55 0 0 2016 PIT 3 3 2–1 64 96 66.7 735 7.7 62 3 4 82.6 8 11 1.4 8 0 2 15 0 0 2017 PIT 1 1 0–1 37 58 63.8 469 8.1 43 5 1 110.5 2 16 8.0 15 0 2 7 1 1 2020 PIT 1 1 0–1 47 68 69.1 501 7.4 33 4 4 85.5 1 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2021 PIT 1 1 0–1 29 44 65.9 215 4.9 22 2 0 92.5 2 −1 −0.5 0 0 2 14 1 0 Career 23 23 13–10 498 788 63.2 5,972 7.6 65 36 28 86.7 76 245 3.2 20 3 53 365 8 3\n\nComebacks/game-winning drives\n\nRoethlisberger set an NFL rookie record in 2004 with five comeback wins in the fourth quarter, and six game-winning drives in the fourth quarter/overtime (including one playoff game).[279][280] Roethlisberger has the most comeback wins (19) and game-winning drives (25) through the first seven seasons of a player's career.[281][282] He is the only quarterback in NFL history to reach 20 comeback wins before the age of 30.[283] Upon his retirement following the 2021 season, Roethlisberger was tied for the 2nd most game-winning drives of all time (53), and in sole possession of 2nd most game-winning drives including the playoffs (57).[284]\n\nNFL records\n\nRegular season wins in a season, rookie quarterback – 13 (2004)[285]\n\nLongest regular season win streak to start a career for an NFL quarterback – 15 games (won all 13 starts in the 2004 season, won first 2 games of the 2005 season)[286]\n\nWins as a starting quarterback in first five NFL seasons (reg. season only) – 51 (from 2004 to 2008)[112]\n\nYoungest starting quarterback to win the Super Bowl (2005;

After surgery on June 13, 2006, Roethlisberger was upgraded to fair condition.[322][325]\n\nThe most serious injuries to Roethlisberger were a broken upper and lower jaw and a broken nose.[326]\n\nRoethlisberger was released from the hospital on June 14, 2006. The next day, he released a statement apologizing for concerning friends, family, all his fans, and the Steelers organization, and in which he also stated, \"If I ever ride again, it certainly will be with a helmet.\"[327] Roethlisberger was subsequently videotaped by KDKA-TV staff riding without a helmet on a Pittsburgh freeway.[328]\n\nOn June 19, the Pittsburgh police announced that Roethlisberger was to be cited for failure to wear a helmet and failure to operate in his license class. Wearing a helmet is optional in Pennsylvania only for operators who possess and have had a motorcycle license for at least two years. The driver of the car was cited for failure to yield the right of way.[329]\n\nRoethlisberger gave his first television interview after the accident on July 13, with ABC's Good Morning America. Despite the seriousness of the accident, his recovery went so well that he started the first three Steelers preseason games in 2006.[330]\n\nSexual assault allegations\n\nLake Tahoe\n\nIn July 2009, Andrea McNulty, 31, filed a civil claim in Washoe County, Nevada District Court accusing Roethlisberger of sexual assault in June 2008 in his hotel room while he was in Stateline, Nevada for a celebrity golf tournament.[331] Roethlisberger was one of nine defendants listed in the docket report and Roethlisberger's attorney denied the claim.[332]\n\nThe Lake Tahoe suit sought damages from the quarterback and additional damages from Harrah's Lake Tahoe officials, alleging that they covered up the incident.[333] According to McNulty, she was working as an executive casino host in July 2008 when she said Roethlisberger struck up a friendly conversation at her desk during the tournament. The next night she claimed Roethlisberger telephoned her to tell her that the television sound system in his room was not working and asked her to look at it. McNulty said she determined that the TV was functioning properly, but as she turned to leave, he stood in front of the door and blocked her, then grabbed her and started to kiss her.[334] According to the lawsuit, the woman obtained hospital treatment after the incident. A second lawsuit filed by a Harrah's employee related to an incident involving Roethlisberger four days earlier showed that Roethlisberger was friends with a Harrah's executive overseeing northern Nevada.[328] McNulty's suit alleges that her boss told her \"That guy [Roethlisberger] can have anyone he wants.\"[328]\n\nIn August 2009, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published details of an affidavit filed as part of a motion by two of the other defendants named in the suit to relocate the case from Washoe County to Douglas County. In the affidavit, Angela Antonetti, McNulty's former co-worker, delivered a sworn statement that McNulty had bragged to her about having consensual sex with Roethlisberger.[328] As part of the affidavit, Antonetti said she was \"absolutely shocked\" upon hearing of the case on the radio on July 21. Antonetti explained, \"I knew that [her] lawsuit and false allegations would unfairly and unjustly hurt Mr. Roethlisberger\".[335]\n\nAccording to the affidavit, defendant Antonetti claimed that McNulty had revealed she was hoping she had gotten pregnant with a \"little Roethlisberger\". Antonetti also claimed that she had been asked to travel to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in August 2008 in an attempt to \"run into\" the quarterback. In response, Antonetti advised McNulty she \"shouldn't try to chase Mr. Roethlisberger\".[335]\n\nIn December 2011, the suit was ended when the parties settled.[336]\n\nMilledgeville, Georgia\n\nOn March 5, 2010, it was revealed that police in Milledgeville, Georgia investigated Roethlisberger for assault inside the women's restroom of the Capital City nightclub. The accuser, a then-20-year-old student at nearby Georgia College & State University, was seen at several establishments with Roethlisberger leading up to the incident, including posing for a photograph with him.[337] Roethlisberger spoke with police the night of the incident and stated that he did have contact with the woman that was not \"consummated\" and afterward the accuser slipped and injured herself.\n\nRoethlisberger hired lawyer Ed Garland, who previously defended Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis in his murder trial. Head coach Mike Tomlin stated at the time that he was \"highly concerned\" for the franchise and Roethlisberger.[338]\n\nThe accuser was treated at Oconee Regional Medical Center. An emergency-room doctor and two nurses examined her and noted in their report a \"superficial laceration and bruising and slight bleeding in the genital area\", but could not say if trauma or assault was the cause. The remaining examination was \"normal\". A rape kit was collected, but no semen was recovered. The doctor's report also quoted the alleged victim telling them that, \"A boy kind of raped me.\"[339]\n\nIn interviews with the police on the night of the incident, the woman alleged that Roethlisberger, after inviting her and her friends to the V.I.P. area of the nightclub, encouraged them to take shots of alcohol before Anthony Barravecchio – an off-duty Coraopolis, Pennsylvania policeman, undercover DEA narcotics officer at Pittsburgh International Airport, and one of Roethlisberger's bodyguards[340][341] – claimed he led her down a hallway and left. Witnesses, however, stated that Barravecchio \"placed his hand\" on the accuser's shoulder and applied \"a little bit of pressure to guide her\" to the restroom where she claims the assault took place, something Barravecchio's lawyer denied.[342][343]\n\nAfter Barravecchio's purported departure, Roethlisberger allegedly approached, exposed himself, and despite the woman's protests, followed her into what turned out to be a bathroom when she tried to leave through the first door she saw. The woman claims Roethlisberger raped her and further alleged that friends of the woman attempted to intervene out of worry, but the second of Roethlisberger's bodyguards, Edward Joyner—an off-duty Pennsylvania State Trooper—avoided eye contact and said he did not know what they were talking about.[344] The policemen claimed to \"have no memory\" of meeting the woman.[345]\n\nMilledgeville Police Sergeant Jerry Blash, who had posed for a photograph with Roethlisberger earlier in the evening, was the first officer to respond.[346] Blash later admitted denigrating the accuser and never formally questioning Roethlisberger; he did speak to the NFL player and his off-duty police bodyguards at the Capital City club.[340]\n\nIn April 2010, district attorney Fred Bright announced that Roethlisberger would not be charged.[339] Further, the accuser wrote to the D.A. through her lawyer expressing she no longer wanted to pursue criminal charges because the level of media attention would make a criminal trial too \"intrusive\" of a personal experience but stressed that she was not recanting her accusation.[347][348]\n\nAs a result of the unabridged details revealed in Bright's press conference Steelers president Art Rooney II was reported to be \"furious\".[349] The owner of Pittsburgh-based PLB Sports, which marketed \"Big Ben's Beef Jerky\", terminated the company's five-year sponsorship of Roethlisberger, the first such action in the company's 14-year history.[350][351] Jerry Blash resigned from the Milledgeville Police on April 15, 2010. Anthony Barravecchio was never disciplined, despite a local investigation where the Coraopolis Solicitor reviewed the 500-page Georgia Bureau of Investigation file on the matter;[343][352] however, Barravecchio's interview with the GBI was not among those released by the agency.[353] Ed Joyner was prohibited by the Pennsylvania State Troopers from continuing to work for Roethlisberger, and lost a grievance case seeking to overturn the decision.[354]\n\n2010 suspension\n\nRoethlisberger was suspended for six games during the 2010 NFL season for violating the league's personal conduct policy, and was ordered to undergo a league-mandated \"professional behavior evaluation\" and \"must adhere to any counseling or treatment that is recommended by the professional evaluators.\"[355] The suspension was subsequently reduced to four games.[356][357][328]\n\nIn popular culture\n\nRoethlisberger is the namesake of multiple sandwiches, which are usually named using a pun on his last name's similarity to \"burger\" or \"hamburger\". For instance, the Pittsburgh restaurant chain Peppi's sells the \"Roethlisburger\", at a price of $7.00, in correlation with his jersey number \"7\", and also having ingredients that describe his playing style (scrambled eggs for \"scrambler\", beef and sausage for his size and strength).[358][359] A Findlay, Ohio, restaurant named Tony's and an Oxford, Ohio, restaurant named Brick Street also sell \"Roethlisburger\" sandwiches.[360]\n\nHe has appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman after both of his Super Bowl victories.[361] At the 2006 Grammy Awards, one week after Pittsburgh won Super Bowl XL, Roethlisberger introduced Kelly Clarkson.[362] In 2009, he hosted WWE Raw.[363] He, along with other Steelers players, made a cameo appearance as a member of the Gotham Rogues football team in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises.[364]\n\nSee also\n\nList of 500-yard passing games in the National Football League\n\nList of National Football League career passer rating leaders\n\nList of National Football League career quarterback wins leaders\n\nList of NFL quarterbacks who have posted a perfect passer rating\n\nList of National Football League quarterback playoff records\n\nNotes and references\n\nAdditional sources\n\nStaff (September 2006) \"Ben Roethlisberger 1982–\" Biography Today 15(3): pp. 102–117"
