        "text": "Bristol Rovers have announced that second-year apprentices Harvey Greenslade and Jamie Egan have signed their first professional contracts.\n\nStriker Greenslade, 18, joined The Gas Academy as an Under-7, and has progressed through age groups and into the first-team, where he has gained valuable experience training with Joey Barton’s promotion-winning squad.\n\nAlso 18, Egan has followed a different route. The Gas signed him in 2020 from Irish club Cabinteely, and he has been part of the under-18s squad ever since. This season, the defender enjoyed a loan spell with Hereford in the National League North.\n\nSpeaking to the club’s media team, Greenslade said: “I am delighted to be offered a professional contract at the club I have been at since the under-sevens. I’ve worked hard and had great support from my family. I had a taste of what first-team football is about when I trained with the team recently and I can’t wait to make an impression next season.”\n\nEgan added: “It’s a dream come true. Now it’s about pushing on and I can’t wait to play in front of the Gasheads at The Mem. Being out on loan has shown me that I have adapted to men’s football and I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nHead of Academy Coaching and former Bristol Rovers defender Byron Anthony commented: “Harvey has been in the academy from day one, so it is extremely pleasing to see him develop as a person and player over the years. From starting out in the foundation phase to now being offered a professional contract with the football club is fantastic."
