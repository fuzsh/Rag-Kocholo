Daly has previous English Football League experience with Bristol Rovers as well as Stevenage\".\n\nDagenham & Redbridge \"confirm that Tom Eastman has become our third signing of the summer after the defender agreed a two-year deal.\n\nThe 31-year-old central defender is the latest addition...\n\nBen Strevens was thrilled to secure the services of the central defender... 'He had interest from Football League and other National League clubs as well... Heâll add fantastic experience into the group with what heâs done at Colchester, and he was a terrific player for them'...\n\nStanding at 6 ft 5, Eastman joins the Daggers with a wealth of experience in the EFL, spending twelve years with Colchester United which put him seventh in the all-time appearances for the Essex side. He also collected a club record four Player of the Year awards.\n\nIn his time with The U's, Tom made 464 appearances\".\n\nAnd The Daggers add that \"The lads are back to work for pre-season!\n\nThe squad undertook testing in two groups, they started in the gym to record several tests, before heading outside for an endurance run, some ball-work and explosive match-like running\".\n\nFootnote: Eastman was in the Colchester side which knocked Alty out of the FA Cup with an added time goal in 2015.\n\nFC Halifax Town \"have announced that defender Festus Arthur has signed a new one-year deal with the Club.\n\nArthur joined the Shaymen last summer and made 18 starts during his time with Town\".\n\nFrom Ebbsfleet United comes news that \"A winger, once recorded as the fastest footballer on the planet, is the next man into the Kuflink Stadium as ex-England U16 skipper Matthias Fanimo returns to his homeland...\n\nThe 29-year-old joins the Fleet after his latest spell in Europe, playing for FC Koper in Slovenia. He has spent the last five years in the Balkans, also living and playing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.\n\nStarting out in West Hamâs Academy system, the direct, pacy winger played in the FA and League Cups for the Hammers and earned his first EFL start on loan with Tranmere Rovers.\n\nHe gained experience of the English non-league scene with Bishopâs Stortford, Eastleigh, Margate and Hornchurch before moving abroad, signing for Slovenian club Drava Ptuj in 2017.... He then switched to the Bosnian league, representing Mladost Doboj Kakanj.\n\nA â¬50,000 fee took him to the nationâs capital and the top division in the country in 2020 when he was signed by Sarajevo... He also tasted European football, featuring in a play-off against Celtic.\n\nHe began last year in Croatia with Slaven Koprivnica playing against familiar names such as Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split before moving back to Slovenia with top-flight outfit FC Koper.\n\nFanimo skippered the England U16 side to Victory Cup success in his youth and also played for the U17s and U18s alongside... such as Raheem Sterling, Jordan Pickford, James Ward-Prowse, Nathaniel Chalobah, John Lundstram and Nathan Redmond...\n\nHe was once described as 'the fastest footballer on the planet' after a 9.8 metres-per-second sprint was tracked while he was wearing a GPS device!\"\n\n29 June 2023\n\nALTY OLD BOY\n\nMorecambe \"24-year-old right back JOEL SENIOR (right) becomes Derek Adams's latest acquisition... as the full back joins on a one-year deal from Carlisle United.\n\nJoel spent 10 years in the youth system at Oldham Athletic before climbing his way up the footballing ladder. Initially turning out for Hough End and Maine Road, Senior would work his way up to FC United of Manchester and Curzon Ashton as his progression was tracked by Burnley. The Clarets offered Joel a deal to be part of their Under 23s which he signed before one year later joining Altrincham in 2020.\n\nAfter almost two years with Altrincham, Joel moved to Carlisle United in January 2022...\n\nJoel added... 'I know League Two from last season and I want to make sure that I am competitive in League Two again this season'\".\n\nAWAY START WANTED?\n\nIf past results were a guide to future outcomes, which of course they are not, Alty would definitely be hoping for an away match to kick off the 2023-24 season!\n\nIn the 23 opening days of league seasons since the start of the current millennium, Altrincham have enjoyed home advantage fifteen times but have won only four times on home turf to start a campaign on the front foot.\n\nIn fact, seven of the last eight seasons have commenced with Altrincham playing at home but they have failed to win any of those games!

But, for the past 13 years they have been without a ground after the landlords sold their stadium for housing without any recompense for their football-club tenants or any firm plan to reinstate a stadium as a community asset.\n\nMore recently Grays have been seeking to redevelop the defunct ground of nearby Thurrock with the local council being seen as less than fully supportive.

Bermudan international Justin Donawa...\n\nThe right-sided speed merchant has spent over two seasons at Solihull Moors, including a goal at The J. Davidson in October 2021, following a spell with Darlington.\n\nAfter a period on the sidelines through injury at Solihull, Donawa returned to full fitness for the second half of last season...\n\nSaid Alty manager Phil Parkinson, 'We identified that we needed to add pace to our frontline, JD certainly gives us that...\n\n'I think heâll suit the way we work and play. Heâs now got a decent amount of experience at this level and higher with his international exploits. Heâs very versatile which is also extremely important with us operating with a smaller squad. He can play right-wing, right wing-back and right-back.\n\n'It is rare for a winger to be so reliable defensively as well as being a threat going forward.â\n\nâLike all the players weâve signed this summer, heâs a great age with a point to prove in the prime of his career'\".\n\nHOW DONAWA ARRIVED AT ALTY\n\nFollowing his arrival at Altrincham, his former club Solihull Moors \"confirm that Justin Donawa has departed the club after turning down a new contract and has now joined fellow National League side Altrincham...\n\nThe 26-year-old ends his stay at the ARMCO Arena having made 66 appearances for the Moors across three seasons, scoring seven goals in Yellow & Blue.\n\nAs part of the clubâs re-engagement process, Donawa declined an offer of new terms made to him...\n\nManager Neal Ardley said... 'Unfortunately, we couldnât agree a deal but Justin goes with our best wishes!\n\n'Heâs a great lad who always gave everything and it was great to get him back to his best last season after his bad injury'\".\n\nJUSTIN DONAWA'S BACKGROUND\n\nNew signing Justin Donawa has an interesting background, not only having started his football career in the USA, but also being an accomplished cricketer and competing in athletics (long jump) at the World Youth Games.\n\nBorn on 27 June 1996 he moved to the USA where his senior soccer career began. He enjoyed a pre-season with Columbus Crew but was not signed by the MLS club.\n\nHis experience in the UK began with a trial at Aberdeen in Scotland before he moved to England and joined Darlington in the National League North for 2019-20 season, where he played against Altrincham in a 1-1 draw at Moss Lane in which he was a used substitute. Justin is pictured, right, in that game.\n\nEarly in 2020-21 season he joined Solihull Moors from where he has joined Altrincham. In February 2022 he fractured his ankle which sidelined him for a period.\n\nHe is a Bermudan football international and has played in World Cup qualifiers for his country.\n\nWhilst at Solihull he faced Alty in 2021, scoring his side's equaliser before they emerged 2-1 winners.\n\nMore recently, he was an unused sub as Alty trounced the Moors 4-1 in February 2023.\n\nJUSTIN AMALUZOR INTERVIEW\n\nPress and media officer Brian Flynn interviewed recent signing Justin Amaluzor and the conversation is available via Alty TV.\n\nJustin underlines that he is a goalscoring winger whose best position is on the right wing, from where he likes to cut in to use his left foot.\n\nALTY OLD BOY\n\nRochdale \"announce the signing of KYLE FERGUSON from Harrogate Town, in principle.\n\nA central defender, Ferguson joins us on a free transfer and pens a two-year deal at the Crown Oil Arena, subject to medical...\n\nHe commented, 'As soon as I knew there was interest, I was excited by it. I played at Rochdale last year and itâs a nice stadium, so I was pushing my agent to try and get it done as soon as possible... Jimmy McNulty was one of the main reasons I wanted to join. We had a really good chat last week about how he wants to play this season, how the club is looking to move forward, so thatâs what sold me the most'...\n\nHead Coach Jimmy McNulty commented... 'Heâs a player that has great future potential, but is also ready to compete for a starting place in our team right now... He can handle all basic requirements of defending in the National League but is also very comfortable with the ball at his feet'....\n\nAn impressive end to the 2021/22 campaign [at Altrincham] led to a move to Harrogate last summer, where he made eight appearances... He re-joined Altrincham on loan in March 2023 and made ten appearances before the end of the campaign\".\n\nAnd we hear from Phil Jordan that \"Maybe it was the loss of CHRIS CONN-CLARKE that caused it, but BARRY BAGGLEY'S Waterford fell to a shock 1-0 defeat at Cobh Ramblers on Friday evening.

The wide areas have been a priority for our management team all summer...\n\nAlty boss Phil Parkinson said 'Iâm really excited we have managed to sign one of the most explosive talents in the National League. Justin is one of the most electrifying players in the division. He has that pace and power that can really strike fear in the heart of a lot of defenders.â\n\nâHe certainly has the x-factor we look for in our wingers. He can score and create goals. I believe at 26-years-old, we have a player who nobody has quite seen the best of yet and I feel we can help him fulfil his potential at Altrincham.\n\nâHeâs a game changer and I feel heâll really complement the other players we have in the frontline at present.\n\nâJustin is a South London boy and I believe this has given him the tools he needs to be successful. Heâs resilient, determined and has that bit of Southern confidence in himself'...\n\nHaving come through the youth system at Barnet, Justin joined Aldershot last summer after a season with Scottish Premier League outfit Motherwell. He scored eight goals in 41 league appearances for the Shots last term who switched to a wing-back formation after the arrival of current manager Tommy Widdrington\".\n\nFootnote: Right, Justin Amaluzor is pictured in last season's game at the JDS against Aldershot Town. He played for 87 minutes of that game in September 2022. In the return fixture in April 2023 he came on as an 80th minute substitute.\n\nHaving started at Luton Town and, after a brief spell at Dartford, Justin spent three years at Barnet (2015â2018) where he made 19 appearances.\n\nLoans at Hayes & Yeading United, Hemel Hempstead Town, Hampton & Richmond Borough and Bognor Regis Town preceded his departure from The Hive for Braintree Town (2018/19), which was followed by a spell with Maidstone United (2019/21).\n\n2021â2022 saw him up in Scotland at Motherwell, where he played 13 times, before he spent last season at Aldershot.

Furthermore, Isaac Marriott had previously enjoyed a spell with Larne, in Northern Ireland, before he joined Alty, whilst defender Aidie Roxburgh had Welsh club Holywell Town in his CV.\n\nAlso on Alty's books in the past two years were goalkeeper Matt Gould, who has Scottish club Livingston in his work history, the same club for which Egli Kaja had played. Alex Sami also had Scottish experience, having played for Kilmarnock, whilst Ross Barrows was qualified to represent Scotland. And, of course, James Jones, who rejoined the club last year, had originally been signed after leaving Welsh side TNS.\n\nAnd if loanees are included, over the past year numerous players had previously played in, or for, one or other of the Celtic countries, including Dermot Mee (Northern Ireland), Armando Quitirna (Waterford, Ireland), Chris Conn-Clarke (Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with Waterford), Dan Malone (Wales), and Connor Jennings (Wrexham).\n\nIn addition, Scotsman Kyle Ferguson arrived on loan after time at Waterford in Ireland, having previously spent spells with Scottish teams Rangers, Kilmarnock, Airdrie and Clyde.\n\nPREVIOUS EMPLOYERS\n\nThe previous employers of Altrincham's most recent signings, Sam Roscoe and Chris Conn-Clarke, have marked their respective departures to the JDS.\n\nFleetwood Town \"confirm forward Chris Conn-Clarke has been recalled from his loan at Waterford FC and has now joined National League side Altrincham on a permanent transfer.\n\nThe 21-year-old, who has featured five times in all competitions for the Cods, has recently been on loan in Ireland with our sister club Waterford FC and impressed in his 15 appearances for the side since January\".\n\nAnd, Sam Roscoe's signing by Altrincham, his former club Linfield reports that \"Samâs contract with Linfield expired at the end of May and he has joined the Robins after the transfer window opened on Wednesday...\n\nSam Roscoe joined Linfield on a two-year contract on the opening of the transfer window on June 9, 2021.\n\nHe made his debut as a late sub in a 4-0 home win against Borac Banja Luka in the UEFA Conference League on July 22, 2021.\n\nHe scored his first goal in a 2-1 defeat away to Fola Esch of Luxembourg in the UEFA Conference League on August 12, 2021.\n\nSam... won a League winnersâ medal in 2021-22 and a League Cup winnersâ medal in 2022-23... Sam played in 56 of Linfieldâs 60 fixtures in the 2022-23 season; the clubâs leading appearance maker of the season...\n\nHis Linfield playing career details... 84 appearances (3 as sub) - 6 goals\".\n\nVANARAMA NATIONAL LEAGUE NEWS\n\nEastleigh \"announce the signing of left-back, Ryan Clampin, following his departure from Colchester United.\n\nBorn in Colchester, Ryan started his youth career at his boyhood club, spending nine years at Colchester United...\n\nIn 2017, Clampin joined Maldon & Tiptree on loan where he went on to make 33 appearances and scored 9 goals...\n\nIn 2019, the wing-back made his full League Two debut in a match against Cambridge United.\n\nOn January 27th 2023, Clampin joined Dundee FC on loan until the end of the season...Dundee FC went on to win the Scottish Championship at the end of the season.\"\n\n17 June 2023\n\nALTY BREAK THEIR TRANSFER RECORD\n\nThe fifth new signing to be announced this week by Altrincham FC press and media officer John Edwards is \"the spectacular acquisition of Chris Conn-Clarke on a permanent basis for a fee that is a new club record...\n\n'I loved every single minute of being with Alty last season,' said Chris... 'So as soon as the gaffer told me he wanted me here after the season finished with Waterford, I said yeah let's do it.\n\n'I want to play in front of those Alty fans again. I'm at my best when I'm enjoying my football, and I loved every minute here. So much so, I felt I was going to score every time I played. I felt a real connection with the rest of the players, the fans, everyone really.\n\n'The gaffer and Neil Sorvel are a massive part of that; they are a great combination'...\n\nFor his part, Phil Parkinson commented that 'This signing also demonstrates the direction the football club are aiming - up. We are known for developing and getting players back on track then moving them on to higher levels in different guises.\n\n'With moving so many key players on last season and in previous seasons, particularly in the front lines, I said to the board that itâs imperative we reinvest in this area significantly or risk falling further behind....\n\n'I would describe him as a street player, because he plays like he hasnât got a care in the world, and thatâs when heâs at his very best. Chris needs to be given the freedom to play his game... Heâs a lovable rogue, and I believe he will become a cult hero here at Altrincham'\"\n\nCHRIS'S THIRD COMING\n\nChris Conn-Clarke (right) becomes the latest of a lengthy list of Altrincham loanees who have subsequently returned to the club and have then been signed by the club itself. Jake Cooper and Eddy Jones are two others in the current squad to have arrived via that route.\n\nChris first came to Altrincham on a one-month loan from Fleetwood Town on 3 February 2022 but, early in his second game, at King's Lynn, a foul tackle led to his being stretchered off and the extent of the injury meant that his loan was curtailed, as was announced on 15 February 2022.\n\nChris's return to Alty, on a second loan from Fleetwood Town, was announced on 21 July 2022. His skill as a number ten was fully demonstrated in 2022-23 season as he became an ever-present and was the club's leading scorer with ten goals (9 in the league) by the time that his loan ended after the match against Boreham Wood on 28 January 2023.\n\nHis career started out at Linfield and then Glentoran in his native Northern Ireland before he joined Burnley in 2018. He played twice during a loan spell with Chorley from October 2020 before joining Fleetwood Town in February 2021.\n\nThe Lancashire club extended his initial contract to the end of the 2022-23 season. He made his EFL debut for Fleetwood in September 2021 and has played for Northern Ireland's under 17s, 19s and 21s.\n\nHis total appearances for Altrincham comprise 33(+1) games in which he netted 10 goals.\n\nROSCOE MAKES IT FOUR\n\nFollowing on the heels of Dior Angus, Lewis Banks and Joey Jones, this week's fourth new signing to be unveiled by Altrincham FC has been revealed by the club's press and media officer, John Edwards.\n\nAnd it is another player with Scottish and Irish experience, who has been unveiled.\n\nJohn Edwards writes that \"Phil Parkinson has added a towering presence to Altrincham's defence for next season after landing 6ft 5in centre-back Sam Roscoe from Northern Ireland Premiership runners-up Linfield...\n\nManchester-born Sam, who turned 25 today [Friday], made more appearances than any other Linfield player last season, and his signing is seen as a real coup for the Robins\".\n\n\"He is extremely comfortable on the ball, and he topped all the charts at his last club for duels won in both boxes.

'I would describe myself as a defender, first and foremost, mostly at right-back. I like defending and getting stuck in and I can win my share of headers, whether it be defending corners or free-kicks or pushing up in the opposition area. I like to think I can get up and down the flank as well, but it's in my nature to defend'...\n\nAlty boss Phil Parkinson said 'Heâs a cultured right-back with a good family pedigree in the game... Weâve leaked too many goals and heâs coming in to help us improve on that front without losing the quality we have going forward.\n\n'Heâs a great age at 26 and had some brilliant experiences playing for Sligo for three seasons and Arbroath... since his Stoke City under-23 days...\n\n'He turned down more lucrative offers to come to us'...\n\nAfter a season at Stafford Rangers, he embarked on a highly-successful spell with Sligo Rovers in the League of Ireland Premier Division\".\n\nSQUAD GROWING\n\nThe signing of Lewis Banks brings to twelve the number of outfield players in the Altrincham squad for 2023-24, with more signing announcements promised for later this week. Coincidentally no fewer than three of the squad, all defenders, share the initials LB which should create confusion with the monographed training tops! They are Lewis Baines, Liam Brockbank and Lewis Banks.\n\nThey are Dior ANGUS, Lewis BAINES (right) Lewis BANKS, Liam BROCKBANK, Jake COOPER, Owen GERMAN, Eddy JONES, James JONES, Matty KOSYLO, Regan LINNEY, Isaac MARRIOTT and Elliot OSBORNE.\n\nOf the above dozen, only eight made a league appearance for Altrincham last season.\n\nIn addition to the outfield players, the squad includes two goalkeepers in Ollie Byrne, and Matt Gould.\n\nVANARAMA NATIONAL LEAGUE NEWS\n\nWoking \"announce the permanent signing of Charlie Wakefield.\n\nThe forward, 25, will join the Cards following his loan spell from Yeovil Town on 1st July, on a deal through to the end of the 2023/24 season.\n\nWakefield first joined the Club on loan in March and featured four times. He played 57 times in the National League for Yeovil, previously working with Manager Darren Sarll. Charlie has also played for Wealdstone and Bromley in the National League, and Coventry City in League One.\n\n'Charlie is obviously a player and a person that I know very well, and it is that historical connection that has driven me to recruit him once more,' said Manager Darren Sarll...\n\n'We will see him in a completely different light to his loan spell last season, even though I think he contributed brilliantly. In the three league games he contributed, we took seven points'... Sarll added.\n\n14 June 2023\n\nDIOR COMES TO ALTY\n\nOn the Altrincham FC website, press and media officer John Edwards writes that \"Several new signings have now been nailed down. In order to give each new arrival the spotlight he deserves, we are announcing the signings one by one on a daily basis between now and the end of this week.\n\nPhil Parkinson has boosted Altrincham's firepower by snapping up former Wrexham and Barrow frontrunner Dior Angus from League Two Harrogate Town.\n\nThe 29-year old has a proven record as a pacey striker with an eye for goal at Alty's level and above... Dior's time at Wetherby Road... was disrupted by a serious ankle injury...\n\n'I started the first few games for Harrogate but then rolled my ankle and sustained some ligament damage which kept me out a while', he said. 'I've had a difficult couple of years, with not playing much, but the gaffer here knows I'm still the player I was before the injury and has shown faith in me, which I appreciate...\n\n'I want to get that feeling back of sticking the ball in the back of the net'...\n\nManager Phil Parkinson said... 'When I knew I could sign him, I did everything in my power to make it happen as quickly as possible, because plays like Dior, at his age and with his experience, donât come along to teams like Altrincham very often...\n\n'He is now at a point in his career where he should be coming into his prime... He embodies all the attributes we are looking for, league experience and life in football which will add great value to the group. His goalscoring record speaks for itself... He should be a 20-goal-a-season striker at this level.\n\nFootnote: Dior Angus is the son of well-known defender Terry Angus whose league career included Northampton Town and Fulham.\n\nDior scored a goal against Alty whilst playing for Solihull Moors as far back as 2013. In February 2021 he also featured for Wrexham at Moss Lane in a league match played behind closed doors and in December 2021 he was an unused sub for Wrexham against Alty at Moss Lane.\n\nDior was born on 18 January 1994. Since starting with Solihull Moors, he has had spells with a string of mostly Midlands clubs, namely Leamington (on loan), Banbury United (on loan), Kidderminster Harriers, Worcester City (on loan), Daventry Town, Stratford Town and Redditch United.\n\nPort Vale signed him from Redditch in early 2018 and from there he had loans with Tamworth, Nuneaton Borough and Barrow, where he became contracted in summer 2019.\n\nIn January 2021 he moved on to Wrexham and then to Harrogate Town in September 2022. He made nine EFL2 appearances at Wetherby Road but failed to score.\n\nALTY OLD BOYS\n\nStafford Rangers \"announce the signing of JAKE MOULT [right]. The midfielder returns to Marston Road for a second spell, having played for the side in the 2008/09 season when he was 19.\n\nThe 34-year-old is Matt Hillâs first arrival of the summer... Most recently, Moult played for Buxton last season, but following his release he has joined up with the Rangers for the next term\".\n\nMeanwhile, defender AIDY ROXBURGH, who was released by Altrincham this summer, has joined Workington.\n\nFootnote: Aidan made just one start for Altrincham having arrived at Moss Lane at the start of June 2022, having been signed the previous year by Chester FC but sent out on loan to Trafford FC.\n\nAt Alty, injury sidelined him at the start of 2022-23 and he went on loan to Ashton United in mid-October 2022 and later to Nantwich Town. However, he suffered a hamstring injury which sidelined him in the New Year.\n\nHis only Altrincham appearance came in the Cheshire Senior Cup though, ironically, his sole inclusion in a National League squad came just a week before his release at the end of his contract when he was an unused substitute at Yeovil.\n\nPAUL COMBINES ACADEMY AND MANAGEMENT\n\nPress and media officer John Edwards writes on the Altrincham FC website that \"Our highly-regarded Academy manager Paul Fay... [has become] the new manager of North West Counties League club Cheadle Heath Nomads.\n\nCrucially, from a Robins perspective, he is continuing as Alty's\n\nRight: Paul gives an interval talk to the Alty Youth team.\n\nAcademy manager after revealing he only accepted the Nomads job after consulting with his family and concluding he could give both posts his full attention.\n\n'I've had a few offers to step up to first-team level over the past four or five years, but it's never"
