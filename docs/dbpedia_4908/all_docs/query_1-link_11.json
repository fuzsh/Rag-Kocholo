        "text": "Now in her 23rd season as head coach of the Fighting Illini, Janet Rayfield has established the University of Illinois women’s soccer team as one of the premier programs in the nation. Year after year, her Illinois teams break school records and set new benchmarks for conference and national levels of success.\n\nIllinois’ winningest head soccer coach, Rayfield has guided Illinois to 226 overall victories and 104 wins in conference play. Her teams have earned 10 victories in NCAA Tournament play. Rayfield has coached six players to seven Big Ten Player of the Year honors, and her student-athletes have garnered 50 All-Big Ten nods. Five individuals were recognized with the Big Ten Medal of Honor under Rayfield’s guidance, and seven of her players earned nine NSCAA All-America laurels. Rayfield has seen seven of her players chosen in the NWSL draft, and Emily Zurrer went on to represent Canada in both the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nRayfield has led Illinois to the NCAA Tournament in 10 of her years at the helm of the program, highlighted by the Orange and Blue’s fourth Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2013. The Orange and Blue scored the most goals under Rayfield with 54 in 2013, just three goals shy of the school record, and finished the year ranked No. 25 by the NSCAA. She coached two-time Big Ten Forward of the Year Jannelle Flaws to a school-record 23 goals in 2013, which was tied for the most in the NCAA, and Flaws graduated as Illinois’ career goals leader with 54. Under Rayfield, Vanessa DiBernardo, who became Illinois’ highest drafted player in school history, completed her decorated career No. 3 on the all-time list with 43 goals along with being named a Capital One second-team Academic All-American and an NSCAA third team Scholar All-American.\n\nRayfield not only has a wealth of soccer experience but also a fierce determination to succeed and an immense amount of respect from her peers. Rayfield served as President of the NSCAA, an organization that includes over 16,000 members, in 2003-04. In addition, she continues to assist at the youth national team level whenever possible. Rayfield received the National Soccer Coaches Association of America Award of Excellence in 2015.\n\nA United States Soccer Federation ‘A’ Licensed Coach, Rayfield was an assistant for Illinois in 1999 under former head coach Tricia Taliaferro and helped the Illini to a 12-8-1 record and the school’s first-ever trip to the Big Ten Tournament semifinals. That season, the Illini entered the NSCAA poll for the first time and climbed as high as No. 15.\n\nRayfield returned to Illinois in 2002 after serving two years as a United States National Staff Coach for Region II. Her duties consisted of player identification, player development and coaching education within the region. During that time, she also served as a U-19 and U-16 National Team Assistant Coach.\n\nIn her playing days, Rayfield was one of the best. She played collegiately at the University of North Carolina from 1979-82 and helped build the program from the ground up. She led the Tar Heels to the 1981 AIAW National Championship and a 23-0 record in only their third year. That season, Rayfield took home the Nike Player of the Year award, All-America honors and was named one of the top 10 soccer players in America (male or female).\n\nIn 1982, she led the Tar Heels to the first-ever NCAA women’s soccer championship. That championship would be the first of 18 NCAA national titles in the storied history of the North Carolina program.\n\nDuring her career at North Carolina, Rayfield was a captain all four years and led the Tar Heels to an overall record of 73-9 in that span. She also left her mark all over the Carolina record books. Today she still ranks in the top three in seven different offensive categories, including holding the school records for most goals in a game (6) and most points in a game (12), both set against the Chapel Hill Club in 1979. She also currently ranks second to Mia Hamm in career goals with 93, third in career points with 223, third in single-season points with 74 in 1981 and tied for third in single-season goals with 30 in both 1979 and 1981.\n\nAfter earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Sciences from North Carolina in 1983, Rayfield worked as a Senior Software Engineer for E-Systems in Garland, Texas, where she wrote numerous computer programs and worked her way up to management level.\n\nWhen she wasn’t working, Rayfield was still heavily involved with the game she loves. She played seven seasons with the Ladies’ Football Club in Dallas and was the captain on six of those squads, leading them to three National Titles in 1985, ‘87 and ‘89. During that same time, she was head coach of the Texas Spirit Soccer Club that won several Washington (D.C.) area and Dallas Cup titles.\n\nIn 1990, Rayfield returned to the collegiate ranks to coach at the University of Arkansas. After three years as an assistant, she was named head coach at Arkansas in January of 1993. In six seasons at the helm of the Razorback program, she coached the 1996 SEC West Champions, two SEC tournament finalists, four All-Region players, six All-SEC players, and 27 Academic All-SEC performers while compiling an overall record of 45-64-7.\n\nAt Arkansas, Rayfield earned a Master of Science in Exercise Science/Biomechanics and also served as a USYSA Olympic Development staff coach and as a scout for both the U.S. Women’s World Cup and Olympic teams. While doing all of this, she was still able to continue her playing career, as she led the Dallas Sting Soccer Club to the Over-30 National Championship in 1993.\n\nIllinois Year-by-Year Highlights\n\n2023: Despite a record that was fairly similar to the previous campaign, Rayfield's 2023 squad saw improvements in all three thirds of the pitch. The season began with a four-match unbeaten streak, which included a 1-0 triumph over No. 17 Xavier on the road and capped with a 2-1 victory at Louisville. After two-straight one-goal defeats, the Illini responded with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Pepperdine on senior day before opening the Big Ten slate with a 1-1 draw at Iowa against a Hawkeye squad that was receiving votes in the national poll. Illinois claimed a second ranked win on the season after taking down No. 19 Michigan, 2-1, at Demirjian Park.\n\n2022: The 2022 season started off with the Illini winning their first three matches, capped with a 1-0 road win over No. 17 Butler. The Illini nearly captured their second ranked win of the season, falling in a narrow 1-0 battle to No. 18 Texas A&M at Demirjian Park. The Orange and Blue would end their non-conference slate with another three-match unbeaten run, picking up wins over Indiana State and Missouri. Despite struggling in Big Ten play, the Illini picked up a historic win at Purdue, becoming the first team in program history to win in West Lafayette. Kendra Pasquale scored the second-fastest goal in program history, needing just 15 seconds to put the Illini ahead in the match.\n\n2021: The 2021 season started off with back-to-back road wins over Missouri and Illinois State – with Kendra Pasquale and Makena Silber scoring the fastest pair of goals in Illinois history against the Redbirds. While the Illini struggled in Big Ten play, Rayfield earned her 100th win over a Big Ten Conference opponent in a 2-1 win over Maryland. Also highlighting the season was forward Hope Breslin, who wrapped up a stellar career in the Orange and Blue, starting 72 of her career 76 games played and owning 18 career goals, good for 11th all-time in program history, nine career assists, and 46 career points. Breslin was selected by Angel City FC with the 28th overall pick in round three of the NWSL Draft, becoming the third player in Illinois soccer history to be drafted in to the NWSL.\n\n2020: In a year marred by COVID-19 restrictions, Rayfield and company played a shortened, Big Ten only season in 2020. The Orange and Blue began the season 3-2-1 with strong showings at Demirjian Park, and finished the season 3-2 and earned the right to host play-in matches for the 2020 Big Ten Tournament. A strong defensive team, the Illini pitched four shutouts on the season. Kendra Pasquale and Makena Silber earned third-team All-B1G honors, while freshman Joanna Verzosa-Dolezal earned a spot on the All-B1G Freshman team.\n\n2019: Rayfield led the Illini to a 9-8-1 record in a season that included a hot start and several key milestones along the way. The Orange and Blue opened with a 7-1 mark, including a 6-1 showing against non-conference competition, and a Big Ten opening win over Northwestern. (Sept. 20) that marked Rayfield's 200th victory at the helm of the Illini program. After a pair of season-opening wins over Loyola (3-1) and Dayton (3-2) at Illinois Soccer Stadium, the Illini captured a road victory over No. 22-ranked Pepperdine. The Illini christened their new home, Demirjian Park, in style with a 2-0 victory over Colorado College (Sept. 15), and finished the year 6-3 overall in home matches, and 4-3 on their new pitch. Senior Kelly Maday earned third team All-Big honors and was named to. teh All-Region third team by the United Soccer Coaches.\n\n2018: Rayfield's 2018 squad let nothing stand in its way throughout the season, as she guided the program to an 11-8-1 record and a return to the Big Ten Tournament. Rayfield's Illini advanced to the quarterfinal round after defeating Wisconsin on penalty kicks (3-0). Five Illini were honored by the league following the season in Katie Murray, Alicia Barker and Jaelyn Cunningham (Second Team) as well as Makena Silber and Ashley Cathro (All-Freshman Team). The honors continued to roll in for Murray and Barker as the two were recognized by the United Soccer Coaches Association as All-North Region Second Team honorees.\n\n2017: Despite taking a step back in wins and losses, Rayfield’s Illini squad continued to make progress both on and off the field during the 2017 campaign. The squad took a service trip to Nicaragua prior to preseason training, partnering with the Soccer Without Borders organization. Operating under the mantra of “Kaizen,” or continuous improvement, the 2017 campaign saw several Illini freshmen contribute to the team’s success almost immediately. Seven freshmen earned playing time throughout the year, and three made appearances in the starting lineup. Sophomore goalkeeper Jaelyn Cunningham anchored a strong Illini defense, as she closed the year with 106 saves, a number that ranked second all-time at Illinois.\n\n2016: Rayfield’s 2016 squad came out to a strong start, shutting out three consecutive opponents to open the campaign. Rayfield coached the Illini to three more shutouts throughout the year, including an upset victory over the 19th-ranked Michigan Wolverines. A major asset to the Illini defense, senior Hope D’Addario earned All-Big Ten recognition at the conclusion of the season, and 15 Illini were honored for their work in the classroom as they were named Academic All-Big Ten honorees.\n\n2015: Janelle Flaws continued to impress in Rayfield’s 14th season as she reset Illinois’ all-time goals record. The record-breaking goal was scored in style as she tallied the second-fastest hat trick in school history. With Rayfield’s coaching, Flaws graduated as one of Illinois’ most prolific players, holding the school records for career goals, points, shots and shots on goal. Rayfield guided the Illini to several significant wins in the 2015 season, upsetting No. 11-ranked and previously undefeated Rutgers in the Big Ten home opener. Junior Allison Stucky was credited with the first goal against the Scarlet Knights all season in the victory. Rayfield’s squad qualified for its fifth-consecutive Big Ten Tournament with a 3-1 victory over Minnesota in the regular season finale.\n\n2014: In her 13th season with the Illini, Rayfield guided veteran Illini all-star Jannelle Flaws to her second consecutive Big Ten Forward of the Year honor, and also saw her receive NSCAA Third Team All-American recognition. Rayfield guided the Illini to their 11th Big Ten tournament appearance and the team finished with 10 wins on the season.\n\n2013: Rayfield guided Illinois to its fourth Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2013, as her squad closed the season with an 11-9-3 record. After an early exit from the Big Ten Tournament, Rayfield’s Illini took on No. 21 Washington State in the first round of NCAA Tournament play. The Orange and Blue advanced to face Portland in the second round of the tournament after defeating the Cougars 3-1 in penalty kicks. A 4-3, come-from-behind victory over Portland in the second round of play advanced Illinois to the Sweet Sixteen. In regular season play, Illinois earned a statement victory over No. 20 Wisconsin, led by Jannelle Flaws who tallied two goals in the contest. Illinois finished the year with 54 goals scored, the most in a season under Rayfield, and many of those goals were contributed by Flaws, who finished the season tied for first in the nation with a school-record 23 goals. Flaws also set a school record with her 126 shots on the year. Illinois finished the year ranked No. 25 by the NSCAA. Vanessa DiBernardo, who became Illinois’ highest drafted player in school history following the season, completed her decorated career No. 3 on the all-time list with 43 goals along with being named a Capital One second-team Academic All-American and an NSCAA third team Scholar All-American.\n\n2012: Rayfield’s 11th season saw the Illini finish 10-9-4 and reach the Big Ten Tournament Championship game along with the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The year was full of highlights as Rayfield’s squad earned the program’s first ever win in Ann Arbor vs. No. 24 Michigan. Rayfield also guided her team past Minnesota despite trailing by two goals and a player 15 minutes into the match. Rayfield’s Illini also knocked off No. 3 Penn State, 1-0, to earn the program’s first-ever win against a Top-3 opponent. 2012 also marked the year Rayfield’s stint as Assistant Coach for the U-20 U.S. Women’s National Team was rewarded with a gold medal at the U-20 World Cup in Japan. Rayfield then became the first woman to win the NSCAA Honor Award.\n\n2011: Rayfield’s first decade of leadership at Illinois culminated in one of the most successful seasons in program history - with the Illini earning a 17-5-2 record, the 2011 Big Ten Tournament Title and another NCAA Tournament appearance. During the 24-game schedule, the Orange and Blue earned a program-best eight-game winning streak and 12-game undefeated mark, while the 17 victories rank as a school record. Though Illinois fell in the NCAA Tournament Second Round at Elite Eight-bound and No. 4-nationally ranked Oklahoma State, 1-0, to end the remarkable year despite outshooting the Cowgirls, Rayfield left an indelible mark on the 2011 college soccer season, one during which Illinois experienced tremendous success in tandem with adapting a new formation strategy and employing five first-time starters on the field.\n\nThe NSCAA recognized sophomore Vanessa DiBernardo with All-America honors while the Big Ten named DiBernardo the Midfielder of the Year and Soccer America named the Naperville, Ill., native a second team All-American as well. DiBernardo continued to grow throughout the season under Rayfield’s tutelage - finishing with the second-most single-season goals (17) and points (39) in program history while accumulating the third-most game-winning tallies (eight) in the NCAA over the course of the season. On defense, converted midfielder Jenna Carosio also benefited from Rayfield’s guidance throughout her senior season and first as a starter. Carosio filled the void in the center of Illinois’ defense left by the graduation of Danielle Kot and Krystin Miller, earning Big Ten Defender of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten honors with DiBernardo. Illinois was equally impressive in the classroom, with Carosio tallying NSCAA Academic All-America honors in addition to totaling CoSIDA Academic All-District with DiBernardo and Megan Pawloski, while 12 players were named Academic All-Big Ten award recipients. In total, more than 70 individual and team awards were handed out to the Orange and Blue during the 2011 season.\n\nThe Orange and Blue opened the fall with the dynamic offensive firepower expected, outscoring Gonzaga, eventual MAC Champion Toledo and Ball State, 15-2, to race out to a 3-0 mark to start the season. The schedule-opening firepower became the 26th highest scoring offense in the country of 330 ranked teams by seasons-end, with the Orange and Blue going on to net 142 points on 53 goals and 36 assists - the most in Rayfield’s tenure. However, as the season progressed into the all-important conference slate, the true dynamic nature of Rayfield’s program blossomed as the defense evolved into the lock-down unit needed to propel Illinois to the No. 2 seeding in the Big Ten Tournament.\n\nAfter blowing out Indiana, 4-1, the Illini produced five consecutive shutouts, including four straight by one-goal margins as Illinois downed Purdue, Michigan State, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Northwestern in succession. Though the Illini finally allowed a goal at Nebraska to end the 554-minute shutout streak - only 77 minutes shy of the program record - Illinois continued to reel off victories with triumphs over the Cornhuskers and Michigan capping the regular season and establishing the program record for consecutive victories.\n\nEntering the 2011 Big Ten Tournament as a predicted favorite to win it all, the Orange and Blue did not disappoint. After using penalty kicks to fight past Ohio State in the quarterfinals after tying through double overtime, Illinois downed Michigan State, 1-0, in overtime during the semifinals and again used extra minutes to beat No. 11-nationally ranked Penn State in dramatic fashion in the final round, 2-1, as Rayfield secured the second conference championship of her tenure.\n\nWith the automatic bid for the conference secure, Illinois put its 11-game unbeaten streak on the line against the defending National Champions, Notre Dame, in the NCAA Tournament First Round. In a season of firsts, the Orange and Blue continued their record-setting ways with a 1-0 win over the Fighting Irish - becoming the first team to beat the defending champs in the first round in the tournament’s 30-year history. The 17th and final victory of the year for Illinois simultaneously marked the program-high for single-season victories as the Illini had previously finished with 16 wins on three occasions - all under Rayfield.\n\n2010: The 2010 season saw Rayfield guide the Illini to their seventh NCAA tournament appearance since assuming head coaching duties before the 2002 season. Throughout the regular season, Illinois exhibited the dominance against non-conference opponents and visiting foes that has made the Orange and Blue successful throughout the program’s history. Illinois rolled through its out-of-conference slate, accumulating a 7-1-0 record with six shutout victories while holding opponents to only six goals in nine home games, earning an 8-1-0 mark in the process. In 2010, Rayfield created a dynamic offense while maintaining the shutdown defense that has highlighted her tenure with Illinois, earning a 13-5-1 overall record, 6-3-1 Big Ten mark and national rankings throughout much of the non-conference slate and the entire Big Ten schedule. The 32 goals produced by the Illinois offense marked the second-highest seasonal total in program history as the defense stifled opponents, holding the Illini’s foes to only 16 goals in 19 games, the third-fewest ever for an Illinois team.\n\n2009: Throughout the 2009 season, different Illini stepped forward to secure victories against one of the most difficult schedules in the country. The Illini faced 12 eventual NCAA Tournament participants, including five Big Ten teams. With her experience facing high-caliber opponents, Rayfield was able to guide Illinois to victories over 2009 NCAA Tournament-bound Illinois State, UC Santa Barbara, Milwaukee and Michigan State by a combined score of 15-1. Illinois also saw the emergence of young talent on the field throughout 2009 under Rayfield’s guidance as Niki Read earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week honors and Shayla Mutz was named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team. Rayfield also successfully guided her fourth player into the Women’s Professional Soccer league (WPS) as midfielder Jackie Santacaterina was drafted with the 60th pick by the Chicago Red Stars.\n\n2008: The 2008 season was an absolute success as Illinois made a trip to the NCAA Round of 16 for the third time in five seasons. Three Illini earned All-Big Ten honors, including first-team defender Emily Zurrer and second team honorees midfielder Jackie Santacaterina and defender Danielle Kot. Zurrer also became the first Illini to earn All-America honors three years in a row. Additionally, goalkeeper Alexandra Kapicka was named a National Player of the Year finalist by Soccer News Net. Additionally, with the development of the WPS league, three Illini that played under Rayfield’s tutelage were drafted including: Ella Masar, Mary Therese McDonnell and Christen Karniski. Rayfield also gained valuable coaching experience in the summer of 2008 as an assistant with the U.S. Women’s National Team for two of its matches against Canada.\n\n2007: Rayfield led Illinois to its fifth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance, advancing to the second round for the fourth year in a row. The squad featured seven All-Big Ten selections, including three named to the all-freshman team, both of which were the most in school history. The Illini also had two representatives named National Soccer Coaches Association of America Scholar All-Americans in McDonnell and Kara Gostisha. In addition, McDonnell also earned the school’s prestigious Big Ten Medal of Honor while her sister, Shannon, was honored with the school’s Fighting Illini Spirit Award.\n\n2006: Rayfield guided the 2006 squad to a then-school record-tying 16 wins, a top-10 ranking, a No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tournament and a berth in the Round of 16. That Illini team also became the first in the history of the Big Ten to boast the conference Offensive and Defensive Players of the Year and the Freshman of the Year in Ella Masar (offensive), Zurrer (co-defensive) and Chichi Nweke (freshman). In addition, Masar was named a second-team All-America selection by the NSCAA, while Zurrer was a third-team selection by the NSCAA.\n\n2005: The Illini wasted no time in the 2005 season, defeating No. 17 Nebraska 1-0 early on. The Orange and Blue proceeded to extend its streak of first-round Big Ten Tournament wins to seven and qualify for its third-straight NCAA Tournament and fifth in the last six years. Illinois defeated No. 20 Florida in the first round on the Gators’ home field, advancing to the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the second-straight year. After the season, senior defender Christen Karniski became the most decorated Illini in school history, earning recognition as the Big Ten co-Defensive Player of the Year, second team All-American by the NSCAA and Soccer Buzz, and first team Scholar All-America by NSCAA among her 10 postseason awards.\n\n2004: The Illini were just as successful in 2004 as Rayfield led her team to their best postseason record in school history, advancing to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. The Illini finished the season with a record of 4-0 against the always-powerful Big 12 conference, which included a 2-1 come-from-behind upset over ninth-seeded Texas A&M in the second round of the NCAA tournament. The squad also set a school record for consecutive wins (7), with Tara Hurless earning All-America status for the second-straight year.\n\n2003: Rayfield led the Illini to the best season in the program’s history with a 16-4-2 record, a top-10 national ranking, the program’s first Big Ten Tournament title and a top-16 seed in the NCAA Tournament. In addition, the 2003 Illini featured two All-Americans in goalkeeper Leisha Alcia and forward Tara Hurless, a first for Illinois. For her efforts, Rayfield was named Great Lakes Region Coach of the Year by Soccer Buzz.\n\n2002: Rayfield’s inaugural season with the Illini saw the Orange and Blue advance to the second round of the Big Ten Tournament, following a 4-3 victory over Penn State. The Illini closed the 2002 campaign with a 9-11-1 overall record and a 4-6 mark in conference play. Rayfield’s squad earned her first victory at Illinois over Butler, 4-2, and her first Big Ten win was a 3-1 result over Northwestern.\n\nRayfield's Year-By-Year Results at Illinois\n\nYear Record Accomplishments 2002 9-11-1 Eighth in Big Ten 2003 16-4-2 Big Ten Tournament Champions; NCAA Tournament First Round; Second in Big Ten 2004 16-6-2 NCAA Tournament Elite Eight; Fourth in Big Ten 2005 12-7-3 NCAA Tournament Second Round; Fourth in Big Ten 2006 16-8-0 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen; Big Ten Tournament Runners-Up; Second in Big Ten 2007 12-7-2 NCAA Tournament Second Round; Third in Big Ten 2008 12-9-2 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen; Fifth in Big Ten 2009 7-9-3 Tied-Eighth in Big Ten 2010 13-5-1 NCAA Tournament First Round; Fourth in Big Ten 2011 17-5-2 Big Ten Tournament Champions; NCAA Tournament Second Round; Second in Big Ten 2012 10-9-4 NCAA Tournament Second Round; Big Ten Tournament Runner-Up; Tied for Fourth in Big Ten 2013 11-9-3 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen; Tied for Fifth in Big Ten 2014 10-8-2 Seventh in Big Ten 2015 10-6-3 Eighth in Big Ten 2016 6-11-2 11th in Big Ten 2017 5-14-0 13th in Big Ten 2018 11-8-1 Big Ten Tournament Semifinals; T-5th in Big Ten 2019 9-8-1 11th in Big Ten 2020-21 6-5-1 Sixth in the Big Ten 2021 5-11-1 13th in Big Ten 2022 7-7-4 T-10th in Big Ten 2023 6-8-3 12th in Big Ten TOTAL 226-175-43\n\nUpdated August 2024"
