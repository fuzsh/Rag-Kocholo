        "text": "Kent Skipper has worked his way out of a job.\n\nWhen he comes to the HP Byron Nelson Championship next year, the only thing he’ll be doing is schmoozing with his buddies.\n\nSince 2008, Skipper has guided the Salesmanship Club of Dallas as its chief executive, overseeing the operations of the 630-member men’s service club, its famed PGA golf tournament and its children’s charity.\n\nNow the 67-year-old is retiring, and the board of directors has accepted his recommendation for his succession: Get rid of his job and use the $200,000 salary to help more kids.\n\nThat’s because Teri Isaacs, 50, executive director of the club; Jon Drago, 42, tournament director; and Michelle Kinder, 41, executive director of the charity, no longer need interference from the top, Skipper says.\n\n“I’ve been working for five years to make sure that we had the next-generation team ready so that I could step aside,” says Skipper, who joined the organization in 1978. “They don’t need a CEO. They’re creative, collaborative leaders who are going to take this organization to new heights.”\n\nAbout the only thing widely known about the Salesmanship Club is that about this time every year, a legion of guys wearing red pants puts on the Byron Nelson, and that benefits some sort of children’s charity.\n\n“We’re the best-kept secret in town,” Skipper lamented Wednesday at the tournament’s media center at the Four Seasons Resort Las Colinas. “We’ve got this slogan: ‘Kids are at the heart of everything we do.’ It’s really true for these men. They care so deeply about children who face all sorts of odds stacked against them.”\n\nThe Salesmanship Club has nothing to do with being a salesman. One of the founders in 1920, Dallas attorney Woodall Rodgers, who later became the city's mayor, thought salesmanship sounded \"less stuffy\" than business, professional or executive.\n\nThe club is still a lifelong, male-bonding thing.\n\nMembers are as young as 30 and as old as 90 plus. The late Paul Bass, a past club president known for his wit, was fond of saying, “When you enter the club, you meet your pallbearers.”\n\nAt the tournament, members check their egos at the gate. The club presidents from the last two years will spend Sunday cleaning golf carts in the cart barn, not watching the final round.\n\nThe most important job that John Scovell, CEO of Woodbine Development Corp., has ever held was crossing guard.\n\nAnd they raise a lot of money.\n\nChange of course\n\nThis year’s HP Byron Nelson is expected to attract more than 250,000 spectators, bring in $11.7 million in gross sales and net more than $5.5 million, up slightly from the 2012 tournament.\n\nOnce the 2013 proceeds are added in, the club will have raised $133 million for its charity since 1968, when golf legend Byron Nelson lent his name to the club’s new PGA tournament.\n\nMore than 5,500 kids and family members come to the Salesmanship Club’s two Dallas campuses for mental health counseling and treatment.\n\n“We have very angry, defiant, out-of-control adolescents, depressed kids, kids who’ve experienced sexual and physical abuse and neglect, and preschoolers who are getting kicked out of day care because of their behavior,” Skipper says.\n\nAnother 1,700 at-risk students participate in other urban education programs or attend its J. Erik Jonsson Community School, a 232-student laboratory school for 3-year-olds to fifth-graders in north Oak Cliff.\n\nMore than 97 percent of its students graduate from high school on time, and, of those, 92 percent go on to higher education.\n\nThe club opened Texas’ first chartered summer camp for indigent and orphaned kids in 1921, “way outside of Dallas on Bachman Lake,” Skipper says.\n\nToday it operates a 1,400-acre camp in East Texas where several thousand kids learn earth science each year and kids from the therapy programs and laboratory school go for various experiences.\n\nUp his alley\n\nAll of this is right up Skipper’s alley.\n\nSkipper, a native Houstonian, worked his way through the University of Houston as a Christian Church youth minister. But after one semester at Texas Christian University’s school of divinity, he changed course.\n\n“I thought I loved church work. But it turned out that what I loved was kid work,” he says.\n\nHe taught eighth-grade American history in Houston and then became a junior high counselor, where he became concerned about the prevalence of students with emotional and behavioral difficulties.\n\nHe went back to college for his master’s and doctorate to focus on psychological therapy for kids, a path that led him to the Salesmanship Club as executive director of its educational and therapeutic programs 36 years ago.\n\nLearned by doing\n\nEven though Skipper runs a $12 million organization, he has no formal business education.\n\n“Everything I’ve learned about management and leadership, I’ve learned from the people I work for. Every year, I had three new bosses — a new chair of the tournament, a new president of the club and a new chair of the charity. So it was the best kind of learning by doing.”\n\nPatton Chapman, next year’s tournament chairman, says no one really bosses Skipper. “He’s one of those guys who will sit in a meeting and never say anything until someone asks, ‘Kent, what do you think?’ And then it’s always sage, spot-on.”\n\nSkipper says his best leadership trait is his listening skills.\n\n“Watching him has complicated my thinking in a good way,” says Kinder, who has worked for Skipper for 14 years and will be head of the charity when Skipper officially retires in August. “He naturally understands how layered every situation is and has a wonderful instinct for when to go slower, when to go faster, when to loop more people in and when not to.”\n\nSkipper will stay on part time on several specific projects through the end of the year. Then he and his wife, Hilda Ruch, plan to move to their favorite beach in Florida, where they’ll enjoy sunsets but not the golf courses.\n\nHe’s never swung a golf club in his life and has no intention of taking it up now.\n\n“I’m sure I’ll get involved with other charities there,” he says. “It gets in your blood.”\n\nAT A GLANCE Kent Skipper\n\nBorn: Houston\n\nAge: 67\n\nEducation: Bachelor's degree in psychology,1966, and master's degree in educational psychology,1969, University of Houston; doctorate in educational psychology and special education for emotional disturbance, University of Texas, 1974.\n\nPersonal: Married for 36 years to Hilda Ruch, a licensed professional counselor and licensed marriage and family therapist; one son, 46.\n\nFounded: 1920, first camp for indigent children and orphans opened on Bachman Lake in 1921.\n\nOperates as: 501(c)3 umbrella organization for the Salesmanship Club, a 630-member men's service organization; the Salesmanship Club Youth and Family Centers, which provides education programs and therapeutic services for more than 7,000 troubled and at-risk children and their families in the greater Dallas area; and the Salesmanship Club Charitable Golf of Dallas Inc., which runs the HP Byron Nelson.\n\nTotal annual budget: $12 million\n\nEmployees: 110 full and part time"
