        "text": "The 22-year-old central defender was instrumental as Bristol Rovers clinched promotion to League One with a 3-1 win over Shrewsbury Town in front of a 61,000 crowd, and he described the experience as simply awesome'.\n\n\"The whole day was superb, from beginning to end,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything about the stadium was awesome - from the huge arch to the massive dressing rooms and warm-up areas - you couldn't rate the facilities anything under five stars.\"\n\nAnthony and teammates were determined not to be overwhelmed after playing at the Millennium Stadium in April when they lost to Doncaster in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final.\n\n\"We had experience of the big stage after Cardiff,\" said Anthony, \"but you couldn't help but be impressed by Wembley. We just soaked up the atmosphere, waved to our friends and family and enjoyed the whole day.\"\n\nThe match itself started badly for Rovers when Stuart Drummond put Shrewsbury a goal up after only three minutes but Richard Walker plundered two goals for the Pirates before Sammy Igoe broke away to seal the victory in injury time.\n\n\"It wasn't the best of starts but I think we were always confident that we could turn it round and after the first goal we kept them pretty quiet,\" said Anthony.\n\n\"Personally I thought I played well and I'm just delighted for the club and for the 40,000 fans that made the trip that we won it on the day.\n\n\"The hardest part was going up all those steps after a tough 90 minutes - it was so high I didn't think I'd make it at one point, but the adrenaline kicked in and it was a fantastic moment when our captain Stuart Campbell picked up the trophy.\n\n\"My medal has now taken pride of place on the mantlepiece and I'm going to get my shirt framed as a memento of the day,\" he added. \"It's something I'll never forget but I'm still only 22 and hopefully there'll be many more days like it.\"\n\nAfter an open-top bus parade in Bristol, Anthony and the rest of the team jetted off for a well-earned break in Magaluf where the celebrations continued and thoughts turned to next season.\n\n\"We had a great time,\" said Anthony. \"It was nice to get the whole squad together and have a break after playing 60-odd games this season.\n\n\"It still hasn't really sunk in what we've achieved, but when you look at the fixtures for next season like Leeds, Nottingham Forest and Swansea it's certainly an exciting time ahead for me and the club.\""
