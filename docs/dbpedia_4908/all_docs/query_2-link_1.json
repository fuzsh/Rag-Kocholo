        "text": "For today's üåü#StudentSpotlightüåü meet another one of our Early Decision admitted J.D. students, Gladys Castaneda '25. At King Hall, she is the Internal Competitions Co-Chair for the Trial Practice Honors Board and a First Generation Advocates‚Äô mentor! üíôQ: Why did you decide to apply as an Early Decision applicant? üíõA: I decided to apply as an Early Decision applicant because I was committed to attending King Hall. After spending the last four years in Davis for undergrad, I knew that I wanted to continue my education within the intelligent and uplifting Davis community. I can now say with confidence that King Hall fosters an environment which encourages their students to support one another. üíôQ: Any tips for prospective applicants considering applying Early Decision? üíõA: My two tips for prospective applicants considering applying Early Decision is to reach out to current students from the school to hear first-hand accounts of what made King Hall a good fit for them so that you can make an informed decision of whether it would be a good fit for you! My second tip is to start early with your personal statement. Re-reading your personal statement and receiving feedback from mentors or advisors is essential in eliminating errors and for putting forward a statement that you are proud of. #UCDavisLaw #FollowTheDream #KingHall #EarlyDecision #Law #LawSchool #LawStudents #FutureLawyer #Davis\n\nContract Formation Tip: An offer \"IS\" an offer. \"I\" = objective Intent to enter into an agreement. \"S\" = Specific terms. The #barexam often tests your ability to distinguish an offer from an advertisement, inquiry, or invitation to deal. Often these won't satisfy the \"I\" or \"S.\" First, an offer is a statement. It ends with a period. An inquiry is a question that ends with a question mark. So, someone asking \"How much for your watch?\" is not extending an offer. There's no objective intent to enter into an agreement. It's merely an inquiry. Secondly, advertisements are usually only invitations to deal. There's no objective intent to enter into an agreement, & usually no specific terms. Think of a car dealership ad where anyone & everyone in the general public could be an offeree. No objective intent. Not an offer. But watch out for situations where there are specific terms in an advertisement, including specifics as to who the offeree can be! The MBE likes to test this issue in fact patterns where the ad limits who can be the offeree with language like, ‚Äúfirst come, first served.‚Äù Here, the ‚Äúfirst come, first served‚Äù language in the ad eliminates the invitation to deal to the general public. Rather, the party who arrives first wins & becomes the offeree. The \"first come, first served\" language provides objective Intent to enter into an agreement & Specific terms. This is an offer. Because an offer \"IS\" an offer."
