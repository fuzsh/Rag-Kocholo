        "text": "The journey was a heck of a ride, and D3football.com was in the house as the season started and finished. There were tons of places we weren't able to be, and players, fans, school employees and parents generally have the same problem: They can only get to one game each Saturday, if they're lucky, and follow one of the 234 teams that played Division III football this year.\n\nSo with the help of our crack staff, as well as a few fan suggestions from our blog, The Daily Dose, Around the Nation brings you our fifth annual year in review in three parts, combined into one long column.\n\nWe've already named our All-Region teams and All-Americans, and we did a midseason report for the first time in the Oct. 12 Around the Nation. So the year in review focuses on some of the things you may have seen and forgotten about, as well as some of the off-the-beaten path things you might have missed.\n\nThe memorable games and plays\n\nRemember the great regular-season 'under-the-radar' games\n\nThese are the contests that were overshadowed by games of bigger national or conference significance the day they were played, but shouldn't have been as overlooked as they were, because of how much fun they turned out to be.\n\nOhio Wesleyan twice makes the list, for giving up crucial TDs with one second left in back-to-back weeks. The Battling Bishops surrendered a tying TD to Catholic and then failed on a two-point conversion in overtime during a 34-33 Sept. 9 (Week 2) loss. The following Saturday, Bethany's Brent Owens found Matt Cruse from 9 yards out in a 34-28 Bison victory. Bethany had previously missed a conversion that would have tied it at 28 with :46 left, but it recovered an onside kick to get a second shot. Ohio Wesleyan, meanwhile, finished 3-7 and two seconds from .500. They may have even had a winning season if, after rallying from down 41-28 against Kenyon on Sept. 30 (Week 5), they hadn't given up a game-winning field goal with six seconds remaining.\n\nWartburg 20, Buena Vista 13, 2 OT, Oct. 28: The Knights, trying to stay in the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference race after an earlier overtime loss to Central, were taking it on the chin from the Beavers, winners of four in a row coming in. The Knights rallied from a 13-3 deficit behind running back Dan Hammes and backup quarterback Nick Yordi to force overtime, when it really got crazy. The Beavers missed a 36-yard field goal wide right, but Wartburg lost a fumble in the first OT. In the second, Yordi slipped and nearly fell during a 6-yard scoring run, and then Josh Faaborg intercepted Buena Vista in the end zone on third down to end the game.\n\nThey started the season ranked last among the 234 Division III teams slotted in our Kickoff '06 preseason preview, but after a winless season that included six losses by 40 or more, plus a 28-20 defeat against Crown and a 13-6 loss at Trinity Bible, Principia had a shot at going out with a win. It happened during the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference's annual Dome Day, where the entire conference plays each other, with kickoffs from morning until night at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis. Seeking revenge in second game against the non-Division III Lions, in 2003 the subject of Keeping the Faith: In the Trenches With College Football's Worst Team, Principia fell behind 13-0. Jeff Gibbs blocked and ran 30 yards with a Trinity Bible punt in the third quarter, and Martin Buchanan found Schuyler Onderdonk from 7 yards out in the fourth to tie it at 13 (Trinity Bible had its first PAT blocked, and Principia missed their second one). In OT, with victory near for Division III's Panthers, they threw an interception at the 8-yard line and gave up a 2-yard Trinity Bible TD run. The Lions finished 2-7 with both wins against 0-9 Principia.\n\nRemember the great games during the playoff push\n\nIn Week 10, Rowan beat Cortland State 14-7 in overtime, Central beat Coe 31-28 in double overtime and Mary Hardin-Baylor scored in the final minute to prevail against East Texas Baptist 33-28. All three winners made the playoffs, as did Whitworth, which somehow beat Linfield 17-13 despite being outgained 329-85.\n\nIn Week 11, Cortland State rebounded to beat Ithaca in an extra period. Dubuque stunned Wartburg in overtime to knock the Knights out of the playoff picture, while Thomas More's 21-17 win against previously unbeaten Mount St. Joseph probably cost the Lions a home playoff game. Bethel trailed St. John's 13-0, but scored the first of its four unanswered TDs 12 seconds before the half. That led to a 28-13 victory that clinched the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title and a playoff bid, and pushed the Johnnies into Pool C.\n\nRemember the great playoff games\n\nOther classifications can't seem to figure out the benefits of a playoff system, while we got 10 games decided by a TD or less. UW-Whitewater and Rowan were each victorious in two close games, while St. John's and UW-La Crosse each split a pair of nail-biters. While there's plenty to argue about with regard to the best playoff games, Around the Nation's favorites were in the first round. Hobart bypassed a chance to tie Rowan on Nov. 18, getting a Shawn Mizro-to-Matt Duliba two-point conversion to go ahead 18-17 with 1:52 left. The Profs responded with a seven-play, 51-yard march and 32-yard Daniel Roberts field goal with 9 seconds left. Later that day, clear across the country, Whitworth's Joel Clark rolled out on a sprained ankle to throw a 1-yard, game-winning TD pass to Drew Griggs to hand Occidental its only loss of the season, 27-23.\n\nRowan's improbable second-round win at Wilkes, where the Profs botched a PAT in the final minutes but got another shot because of a fumbled Colonels' snap on their 22, was also noteworthy.\n\nAlthough we didn't get any of the nailbiting nine (Mary Hardin-Baylor technically beat Washington & Jefferson by three in the second round, 30-27, but the Presidents scored a TD with 5 seconds left, which created the appearance of drama that actually didn't exist) in the semifinals or Stagg Bowl, our national champion won once in the playoffs by just a field goal and the runner-up did so twice, proving that earning your championship in a playoff is the most gratifying way to do it.\n\nThe nine nail-biters:\n\nFirst Round\n\nRowan 20, Hobart 18; Whitworth 27, Occidental 23; St. John's 21, Central 13; UW-La Crosse 28, Bethel 21\n\nSecond Round\n\nRowan 21, Wilkes 14; St. John Fisher 27, Springfield 21; UW-Whitewater 24, UW-La Crosse 21\n\nQuarterfinals\n\nUW-Whitewater 17, St. John's 14; Mount Union 17, Capital 14\n\nRemember the great rivalry games\n\nOn Nov. 11, the Cortaca Jug and Monon Bell games continued to make their cases for Division III's best rivalry. While Williams used Week 11 to manhandle rival Amherst 37-7 in the longest-running rivalry, Cortland State needed overtime to beat Ithaca 23-20, while Wabash retained the bell vs. DePauw by the same score.\n\nThe Little Giants outlasted the Tigers in a back-and-forth game with a furious finish in Crawfordsville, Ind., but we give the edge this year to the Red Dragons and Bombers, because of the overtime and the playoff implications. With its top two quarterbacks injured, 15th-ranked Cortland State went to a halfback pass for a 20-17 lead with five minutes left, but 25th-ranked Ithaca tied on a field goal with 36 seconds left. Bill Hauser intercepted the Bombers on the second play of their possession, but Ithaca's defense gave up just three yards, setting up a 40-yard attempt for the win. Junior kicker Matthew Mintz made the field goal for the Red Dragons' second consecutive OT win in the series. The loss was 7-3 Ithaca's third in four games against ranked competition, while at 9-1, the New Jersey Athletic Conference runner-up Red Dragons appeared to have a shot at the playoffs.\n\nRemember the great upsets\n\nAmong the Massey Ratings' 10 least likely results across all divisions, the top five were Division III games:\n\nCarleton (4-6) 17, Bethel (9-2) 14, Sept. 23\n\nSusquehanna (2-8) 17, Delaware Valley (8-3) 10, Oct. 21\n\nOhio Wesleyan (3-7) 17, Wittenberg (7-4) 10, Oct. 21\n\nShenandoah (2-8) 20, Waynesburg (6-4) 10, Sept. 16\n\nAlma (6-4) 33, UW-Eau Claire (3-7) 30, OT, Sept. 2\n\nThe records don't make the Alma-UWEC seem like an upset, especially since Gagliardi Trophy winner Josh Brehm piloted the Scots' victory, but anytime a Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference team loses to the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association, the computer ratings consider it an upset. The Wittenberg and Delaware Valley losses cost the Tigers and Aggies playoff bids, while Bethel's Week 11 upset against St. John's meant the Carleton loss didn't cost the Royals theirs.\n\nOther upsets had big impacts on conference races:\n\nLoras 32, Coe 30, Sept. 30 -- The Kohawks lost their starting quarterback before the season and still lost by only three each to IIAC powers Wartburg and Central. But the home loss to the Duhawks, who finished 4-6, kept those games from having more influence on the conference title and automatic bid.\n\nNorth Carolina Wesleyan 46, Christopher Newport 34, Oct. 28 -- Battling Bishops scored 22 of the game's final 30 points after trailing 28-24 late in the third quarter; Loss meant Captains had to beat Averett and Ferrum to take USA South automatic bid.\n\nClaremont-Mudd-Scripps 30, Cal Lutheran, 27 (2 OT), Oct. 14 -- In 2005, the Kingsmen went 8-1 with only a loss to Occidental, and they looked to be headed into the Tigers game in Week 9 with both team undefeated, until they stumbled against the Stags in Week 7. C-M-S scored on a 67-yard pass with 2:47 left to tie the game at 20 at the end of regulation.\n\nGuilford 33, Bridgewater 28, Oct. 14 -- Eagles' loss broke open race in conference they'd dominated for six years, and later results set up Washington & Lee vs. Emory & Henry on Nov. 4 for the Old Dominion Athletic Conference title.\n\nMillsaps 34, Trinity (Texas) 12, Nov. 11 -- Another changing of the guard took place in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, where the Majors, led by former Alabama coach Mike DuBose, broke Trinity's 13-year stranglehold on the conference.\n\nRemember the great comebacks\n\nThere were undoubtedly great ones all around the country, but perhaps none saved a season like Occidental's rally to defeat Cal Lutheran 28-27 and eventually win the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title. The Kingsmen scored the first 21 points and led 24-7 at the half, but the Tigers made the halftime adjustments and put together three second-half drives of at least eight plays and 65 yards each to seize the victory.\n\nRemember the great early-in-the-year games\n\nThere were a few early in the season that matched national significance and feisty competitiveness. Two West Region games stand out:\n\nOn Sept. 23, UW-Stout pitched a shutout for 59:57. But Whitworth scored to cap a 76-yard, final-1:06 drive which led to the visiting Pirates' 14-13 overtime victory and became the foundation for an 11-1 playoff season. The Blue Devils missed three field goals, including one in the first overtime, and its second-overtime PAT.\n\nAlso in Week 4, Concordia-Moorhead led St. John's 10-0 early in the fourth quarter and watched the lead go up in smoke in less than three minutes, beginning with another long Kyle Gearman TD reception. Gearman caught a 74-yard pass to beat the Cobbers in Moorhead last season, and caught an 87-yarder on the same field just 35 seconds after Concordia had extended its lead, on the way to the Johnnies' 14-12 victory. The Cobbers, after 21 wins the previous two seasons, plummeted to 4-6.\n\nRemember the wildest regular-season shootouts\n\nSept. 30 turned out to be National Shootout Day in Division III, as Week 5 gave us the two games that best tested the scoreboard equipment.\n\nSul Ross State 60, Howard Payne 56\n\nThere were no overtimes but 1,115 yards. The Lobos, who hadn't beaten the Yellow Jackets since 1988, trailed by 11 with eight minutes left. It was such a ridiculous back-and-forth, however, that you're better off referring to the press release from that day, lest I take up your entire screen describing the fireworks.\n\nMaryville 50, North Carolina Wesleyan 48 (4 OT)\n\nN.C. Wesleyan took a 24-3 lead into the fourth quarter before Maryville scored 21 points in the final 7:18 to force overtime. The teams each hit 40-yard field goals in the first overtime, scored on short touchdown runs in the second overtime, scored TDs with the required two-point conversion in the third overtime and each scored in the fourth overtime. Battling Bishop (yes, there are two teams with this nickname) quarterback Cedric Townsend threw an incomplete pass on the conversion attempt, while Fighting Scots signal-caller Justin Price kept the ball and scored the winning two-pointer to give Maryville the dramatic win.\n\nFor good measure, Alma tossed in a 58-36 win vs. Tri-State that day, Kenyon added its 44-42 victory against Ohio Wesleyan, Monmouth topped Grinnell 51-31 and Dubuque prevailed 51-34 at Luther.\n\nRemember the surprising regular-season blowouts\n\nOhio Northern was the lone team to beat Mount Union in 2005, winning 21-14 during the regular season in Alliance. The Polar Bears went back to the Purple Raiders' place this season Oct. 7 and were treated like most other Mount Union opponents: They were pummeled, in this case 49-7.\n\nRemember the wildest playoff shootouts\n\nDefense might have been the word in the 32-team field this year, as there was only one game where each team scored 28 or more. And in Wheaton's first-round, 42-28 win over Mount St. Joseph, the Thunder scored the first 35 points and led 42-6 in the fourth, so it wasn't a true shootout. Digging into the ECAC Bowl matchups, however, reveals a shootout between a couple of almost-playoff-worthy teams. Alfred (8-3) trailed Rochester (7-4) in the fourth quarter 34-19 before rallying to tie, then scoring on the first play of overtime to win 40-34. And that came after the Yellowjackets missed a field goal in their half of the extra period.\n\nRemember the great plays\n\nCertainly there were scores of great finishes, and scores finished in great ways each week. Beyond that, there were surely many moments in which something instinctive, or some attention to detail, affected a play, which affected a game, which affected a season.\n\nIf there was a play that saved a season, it came to start a game more than 1,100 miles from home against a top 10 opponent, with the team's most prolific player sidelined for weeks with a broken collarbone. Neil Mrkvicka collected the opening kickoff for No. 2 UW-Whitewater at Mary Hardin-Baylor (ranked sixth then, and finished the season ranked eighth), and shot up the middle for a 94-yard kickoff return for a TD. Little did we know then it would be the only points the Warhawks would score that day, or all they would need. UW-Whitewater left Texas with a confidence-building win, knowing it could gut out a W without star running back Justin Beaver, and if needed, with defense. The Warhawks' playoff run included a come-from-behind win against UW-La Crosse, where Mrkvicka again played a key role, catching a 53-yard go-ahead TD pass, and another three-point win against St. John's.\n\nRemember the great individual regular-season rushing performances\n\nAlthough MacMurray's Peter Ereg had the regular season's high game, with 357 yards against Eureka Nov. 4, rushed for 331 the next week against Blackburn, and had rushed for 278 on Oct. 21 against Greenville, the combined mark of the teams he did it against was 9-23. Two rushing performances against playoff teams stand out clearly as 2006's best:\n\nSpringfield option quarterback Chris Sharpe rushed for 272 yards against Hartwick and 268 vs. Union, but it was his 280-yard, seven-TD game on Oct. 21 that was the real jaw-dropper. That day against St. John Fisher, the Pride cemented itself as an East Region force to be reckoned with.\n\nOct. 14 was nearly UW-Whitewater's day of reckoning, when the Stagg Bowl-bound Warhawks failed to get star back Justin Beaver out of the UW-La Crosse game in time. Beaver piled up 286 yards, but on his final carry of the day, the one on which he set the school record, a hard tackle left him with a broken collarbone. The injury cost him five weeks, but it may have strengthened Whitewater, who finished an unbeaten WIAC season and won at then-No. 6 UMHB without Beaver. The 5-8, 196-pounder returned for the playoffs and rushed for 87 yards in the Stagg Bowl.\n\nRemember the great team rushing performances in the regular season\n\nKenyon produced three 100-yard rushers (running backs Alby Coombs and Javier Arbolaez and quarterback Rafael Sanchez) in a single game, a 33-30 overtime win vs. Earlham, in which the Lords blocked an overtime field goal attempt then kicked an 18-yarder to win it.\n\nRemember the great individual playoff rushing performances\n\nMount Union sophomore Nate Kmic topped his 361-yard playoff game against Augustana from last season with a 42-carry, 371-yard day against St. John Fisher in the semifinals. Kmic, who'd had as few as six carries in a game while the Purple Raiders saved him for when he was needed most, produced 238 of those yards on 27 second-half carries. After so many runs, the sophomore said: \"It's kind of like hit 'em or get hit. I'd rather be the one giving the blow.\"\n\nRemember the most impactful play\n\nJim Migliore's 21-yard overtime TD catch for Rowan vs. Cortland in Week 10 proved crucial on more than just the day it was caught. The Profs eventually won the New Jersey Athletic Conference's automatic bid and played three playoff games, while Cortland -- despite an overtime victory against rival Ithaca without its top two quarterbacks -- missed the playoffs at 9-1. Then, in an ECAC Bowl Game letdown, RPI thumped the Red Dragons 26-7.\n\nRemember the great finishes\n\nThere are certainly plenty of nominees here, including any of the few dozen overtime finishes. But Union-Worcester Polytech gets our nod because of the way it suddenly became a crazy game. In the final 9:18, the teams combined for 31 points, and each scored a touchdown and went for two in the final 1:24. WPI coach Ed Zaloom called for his conversion trailing 28-27, but the Dutchmen's Doug Davis intercepted Rob Pantalone to preserve the Liberty League win and Union's playoff hopes.\n\nRemember the worst starts\n\nOn Sept. 16, Otterbein trailed Mount Union 34-7 in the second quarter, although the Purple Raiders had run just five plays from scrimmage.\n\nThe Cardinals went three-and-out to start, and gave up a punt return to their own 27. On the Purple Raiders' second play, Pierre Garcon caught a 21-yard TD pass from Mike Jorris. Otterbein followed with three first downs, but botched its punt attempt, leading to a fumble recovery for a TD by Mount Union's Matt Kostelnik. The senior safety jumped the Cardinals' first pass after the kickoff and took it back 24 yards for a 21-0 advantage.\n\nOtterbein got three more first downs before punting, and Jorris connected with running back Justin Wray for a 67-yard score on the second play after the punt return. The Cardinals put together an eight-play, 82-yard scoring drive before Jorris hit Garcon for an 82-yard TD on the first play after the kickoff.\n\nWhen Mount Union is accused of running up scores, games like this 71-14 win are cited. But what is coach Larry Kehres supposed to do when the game is effectively over, and your first-team offense has run five plays? With OAC opponents capable of beating them ahead on the schedule, don't the Purple Raiders need the work against live competition? When are you supposed to toss out the playbook and just run the ball? The Purple Raiders scored four TDs in the second half, three on runs and none shorter than 32 yards. They also attempted a 38-yard field goal in the fourth with the backup kicker, which I know is meant as an effort to not further run up the score, but always seemed to me to be just as effective at rubbing it in.\n\nRemember the creative play-calling\n\nOn Sept. 9, Muhlenberg ran two fake punts against William Paterson, and both went for 51-yard gains. The first did not lead to points, but the second was the game-winning touchdown, a pass from Ryan Sassaman to Matt Johnson on fourth-and-7 with the score tied at 17 and 9:12 to play. The Mules won 24-17. Sassaman, a high school Wing-T quarterback who punted for three years for Muhlenberg, finished his career 5-for-5 passing for 178 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nDickinson isn't known for a stock of gadget plays, but one worked to perfection against Muhlenberg in Week 6. Quarterback Matt Torchia tossed to wide receiver Chris McEnerney on the end around, who then flipped to freshman \"receiver\" Ian Mitchell (an oft-praised quarterback in his high school days in the Philadelphia area), who proceeded to throw a 55-yard touchdown strike to tight end Ryan Stereatt. It gave Dickinson a 14-0 lead in an otherwise uneventful 24-14 win, but it was a gadget play that worked and there aren't too many plays that send the tight end for 55-yard scores.\n\nRemember the confusing score triangles\n\nUW-Whitewater 7, UMHB 3; Wesley 34, UMHB 20; UWW 44, Wesley 7\n\nWhen the Warhawks, then No. 2 and destined to repeat as Stagg Bowl runners-up, went to Texas to take on then-No. 6 Mary Hardin-Baylor, we weren't sure what to expect. After all, these were two great rushing attacks and two offenses capable of scoring in bunches. Instead we got an exhilarating 7-3 defensive battle, and Whitewater's lone score came by returning the opening kickoff.\n\nIn the playoffs, then-No. 3 Wesley hosted UMHB in the South Bracket final. The Wolverines gave up a score on an early fumble return, but dispensed with the running attack and passed all over the Crusaders (436 yards), building a 28-7 halftime lead that provided the needed cushion when UMHB made it competitive in the second half.\n\nSeeing those two teams play UMHB relatively evenly seemed to logically indicate that Wesley at UW-Whitewater would be a good game, even if the same matchup in last year's semifinals produced a 58-6 result. Wesley was considered to be a year wiser, and the stories of them wearing the wrong shoes on Whitewater's grass field (the irony in the 58-6 game was that the Warhawks had turf shoes on, knowing how Wisconsin weather can freeze their field) were raised and dismissed.\n\nAnd so were the Wolverines, who fell behind 31-0 in the first 18 minutes on the way to another disappointing end to a great season and long flight back to Delaware.\n\nOther troublesome triangles:\n\nSt. John Fisher 34, Ithaca 10 (Sept. 23), Springfield 55, St. John Fisher 38 (Oct. 21), Ithaca 24, Springfield 7 (Oct. 28) -- Fisher solved this one with a 27-21 second-round win over Springfield in the playoffs.\n\nSalisbury 32, Washington & Jefferson 14 (Sept. 2), Christopher Newport 23, Salisbury 17 (OT), Washington & Jefferson 27, Christopher Newport 23 (Nov. 18) -- Road teams won all three games.\n\nMost emphatic statements\n\nUW-Whitewater 44, Wesley 7, Dec. 9: In this Week 15 meeting of teams ranked No. 2 and No. 3 at the time, it was pretty much a repeat of last year's 58-6 semifinal lashing, to the surprise of some who thought the Wolverines would be a lot more competitive with a year's experience.\n\nMount Union 38, Capital 12, Oct. 28: In Week 9, the top-ranked Purple Raiders hosted the No. 4 Crusaders, who never got going in the rain, sleet and snow. Nate Kmic rushed for 240 yards while Capital was held to minus-31, but the teams reprised the matchup in the national quarterfinals to the tune of 17-14.\n\nUW-La Crosse 17, South Dakota State 3: The Eagles' Week 1 victory over the Division I-AA scholarship Jackrabbits was the first indication that the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference would have two legitimate playoff teams. The Jackrabbits finished 7-4 and ranked 21st in the College Sporting News Coaches Poll and 22nd in the The Sports Network poll.\n\nSpringfield 55, St. John Fisher 38, Oct. 21: Expectations were high for this Week 8 battle of emerging powers in the East, but it's likely no one expected seven TDs and 280 yards from Pride quarterback Chris Sharpe. These teams also got together again in the playoffs, and Fisher's claims that they were missing three key defenders in the first meeting held water, as the Cardinals won 27-21.\n\nRemember the great streaks that ended\n\nDubuque's 6-4 finish, its first winning season since 1987, may have been the most remarkable. But plenty of streaks fell during the season. Here are some:\n\nMillsaps broke Trinity (Texas)'s run of 13 consecutive SCAC championships.\n\nWilliams snapped Trinity (Conn.)'s 31-game winning streak in Week 5, 41-16. The NESCAC's Bantams don't participate in the playoffs and hadn't lost since playing Williams in the second game of 2002.\n\nConcordia (Ill.) broke a 20-game losing streak with 13-3 win against Blackburn in Week 1, then won again later in the month, 41-12 vs. Eureka.\n\nTri-State snapped a 16-game losing streak with a 21-7 Week 8 win vs. Olivet, then the MIAA's first-place team..\n\nRemember the great streaks extended\n\nBeyond the dozens of conference and regular-season streaks are others that are truly eye-catching.\n\nLinfield's 6-3 season may have been a down year for Wildcats fans who've grown accustomed to the playoffs, but it extended their streak of winning seasons to 51. Central, meanwhile, last had a losing season in 1960.\n\nThree schools have been ranked in all Top 25s since the D3football.com Top 25 poll began before the 2003 season.\n\nSince we ran this stat midseason, Ohio Northern, Delaware Valley and Ithaca dropped out of the poll after appearing in at least 25 consecutive top 25s. Linfield fell to No. 24 after its loss to Whitworth in Week 10, but remained ranked all season.\n\nLinfield 56\n\nMary Hardin-Baylor 56\n\nMount Union 56\n\nRowan 40 (Last unranked in 2004 preseason poll)\n\nUW-Whitewater 39 (Last unranked in 2004 Week 2)\n\nThe memorable statistics\n\nOhio states its case\n\nDifferent year, same story for the Ohio Athletic Conference runner-up. Go as far as the bracket will allow before getting eliminated by Mount Union in a rematch. Capital finished ranked third, but was knocked out in the round of eight on a three-point loss to the Purple Raiders for the second season in a row.\n\nOf the 14 champions and runners-up to make the playoffs since 1999, the OAC is 40-9 (.816). Five of the losses are head-to-head defeats against Mount Union, so OAC teams are 35-4 (.897) vs. non-conference playoff opponents.\n\nIn that same time frame, OAC runners-up are 11-1 (Ohio Northern 3-0 in '99/'00, John Carroll 3-0 in '02, Baldwin-Wallace 1-1 in '03, Capital 4-0 in '05/'06). That's a .917 winning percentage. Mount Union (vs. Rowan in '99, St. John's in '03 and Mary Hardin-Baylor in '04) has accounted for the other three losses.\n\nMount Union vs. conference opposition in expanded-era playoffs:\n\n1999: vs. Ohio Northern: Won 56-24 in regular season, 56-31 in quarterfinals\n\n2000: vs. Ohio Northern: Won 48-24 in regular season, 59-28 in second round\n\n2002: vs. John Carroll: Won 35-16 in regular season, 57-19 in semifinals\n\n2005: vs. Capital: Won 42-24 in regular season, 34-31 in quarterfinals\n\n2006: vs. Capital: Won 38-12 in regular season, 17-14 in quarterfinals\n\nRemember the statistical anomalies\n\nMarietta scored 37 points vs. Baldwin-Wallace and 4-6 Otterbein managed 31 against the Yellow Jackets, for a total of 68 points. In Baldwin-Wallace's other eight games, including a 14-0 loss to 15-0 Mount Union, a 13-7 defeat against 6-4 Ohio Northern and a 17-7 win vs. 7-3 Augustana, the Yellow Jackets allowed just 68 more points.\n\nGuilford was 2-0 in games where Josh Vogelbach threw five interceptions (at home vs. Greensboro 36-30, Sept. 30, and at Randolph-Macon 14-6, Oct. 28). Who says turnovers will get you beat?\n\nBiggest disparity between offense and defense\n\nKenyon's defense allowed a 250-yard rusher three times this season, but the Lords averaged 267.8 rushing yards per game to help offset the run-stopping woes. In all, Kenyon ranked third nationally in total offense with 451.4 yards per game. The defense allowed 458.3 yards, good for 227th among the 229 teams in the NCAA rankings. Not surprisingly, the Lords' won-loss record was fairly balanced too: 4-6.\n\nMost offense, fewest wins\n\nLuther was expected to contend in the IIAC, but instead became one of the season's hard-luck stories, finishing 2-8 with two overtime losses, four by a TD or less and another by 11 points. That rendered the nation's No. 5 offense (445.5 yards per game) rather useless, as it moved the ball like mad on days its defense couldn't stop anyone, and struggled when its defense had good days. The Norse were also just No. 59 in scoring offense at 25.8 points per game, and subtracting a 60-0 win vs. Martin Luther in the opener, averaged 22 points per game.\n\nLeast bang for the buck\n\nCoast Guard 3, Maine Maritime 0, Oct. 28: With ties no longer permitted in college football, there's only one way to get a lower-scoring game. An 18-yard second-quarter field goal by junior David Lieberman accounted for this one's only points, but at least rain and severe winds on Ponobscot Bay in Castine, Maine -- one of the northernmost points in Division III -- were a viable excuse. When Mary Hardin-Baylor and UW-Whitewater, each top 10 programs, accounted for only 10 total points on the same Week 9 day, including three by both offenses, they played on a turf field on a clear, warm Texas afternoon.\n\nOther nominees:\n\nUrsinus 6, Susquehanna 0, Sept. 2\n\nUrsinus 6, La Salle 2, Sept. 16\n\nLawrence 8, Knox 6, Oct. 14\n\nHamilton 12, Bowdoin 0, Oct. 14\n\nCoe 12, Simpson 3, Oct. 14\n\nWartburg 10, Coe 7, Oct. 21\n\nMost bang for the buck\n\nWe detailed some of our favorites under \"Wildest Regular-Season Shootouts,\" but here a few points about some of our highest scoring tight games:\n\n1. Sul Ross State 60, Howard Payne 56: Tied for the highest combined score in all of college football this year.\n\n2. Hampden-Sydney 46, Guilford 43: A redux of last year's 47-45 Tigers win.\n\n3. Earlham 49, Manchester 35: The point total was dwarfed by last year's 69-62 game, but Justin Rummel threw for 502 yards and another seven TDs.\n\n4. Kenyon 44, Ohio Wesleyan 42: The Battling Bishops scored twice in the final six minutes to go up 42-41, but gave up a 63-yard kick return and lost on a field goal with :01 left.\n\nThe memorable players\n\nTen players who as a group rival the actual Gagliardi Trophy finalists\n\nAround the Nation has no beef with the selection committee, which seems to be a good mix of folks from many walks of life, most with Division III ties. And we realize everyone on the committee doesn't get to see as many games as Pat Coleman or myself, and didn't have the benefit of seeing the game we saw that greatly influenced who we both ended up putting No. 1 on our ballots.\n\nAlma quarterback Josh Brehm was a fitting winner. Although his Scots team finished 6-4 and missed the playoffs, he put up huge numbers, and was a tremendous all-around candidate, with 3,448 passing yards, 30 TDs and a 3.78 GPA. However, his taking home the trophy signified what sort of year it was in Division III. There was no dominant player who was a no-brainer, like Linfield's Brett Elliott last season. Well, perhaps there was one, but when UW-Whitewater junior running back Justin Beaver missed five weeks with a broken collarbone, the race opened up.\n\nWith that in mind, here are 11 others (sorry, ATN couldn't settle on 10) whose play would have made them fine Gagliardi finalists:\n\nJoel Clark, Sr., QB, Whitworth\n\nAndy Collins, Sr., QB, Occidental\n\nPierre Garcon, Jr., WR, Mount Union\n\nNate Kmic, So., RB, Mount Union\n\nRocky Pentello, Sr., QB, Capital\n\nBryan Robinson, Jr., DE, Wesley\n\nMark Robinson, Sr., RB, St. John Fisher\n\nVance Schuring, Jr., RB, Central\n\nChris Sharpe, Jr., QB, Springfield\n\nDerek Stanley, Sr., WR, UW-Whitewater\n\nJusten Stickley, Sr., DE, Mount Union\n\nThe actual Gagliardi finalists (all seniors):\n\nTom Arcidiacono, RB, Union (East Region finalist)\n\nJosh Brehm, QB, Alma (North Region finalist, eventual winner)\n\nRyan Kleppe DT, UW-Whitewater (West Region finalist)\n\nJordan Neal, QB, Hardin-Simmons (South Region finalist)\n\nAlso:\n\nTom Brew, LB, Case Western Reserve\n\nKirby Carr, LB, Bethel\n\nAdam Haas, DT, Cortland State\n\nKam Kniss, QB, North Central\n\nTristan Murray, RB, Wittenberg\n\nChad Otte, S, Wilmington\n\nRemember the best players\n\nAs we said in this space last year, it's such an undefined quality, what makes one player the best. No back excels without his line, and so, even though we've given this honor already to UW-Whitewater defensive tackle Ryan Kleppe and Mount Union running back Nate Kmic (When D3football.com named its All-American team on the day of the Stagg Bowl, it also chose an offensive and defensive player of the year), we should also extend it, in Kmic's case, to his line: Tackles Jason Lewis and Ryan Creachbaum, guards Tim Reash and Derek Blanchard, center Eric Safran and tight ends Anthony Antonucci and Chad Reynolds.\n\nTogether, these guys put together a rarity: a 2,400-yard season. And when looking at how few carries Kmic got in some games, one wonders if this could have been a a 2,500-yard or 3,000-yard year had Mount Union needed it to be.\n\nHere's how Nate Kmic's 2,402-yard 2006 season compared to Justin Beaver's 2,420-yard 2005. The backs have compiled the second- and third-highest rushing totals in Division III history:\n\nTheir game-by-game breakdowns, with carries, yards and rushing TDs:\n\nBeaver 2005\n\nSt. Norbert: DNP\n\nSt. Xavier: 13-110-2\n\nLakeland: 11-138-2\n\nUW-Eau Claire: 32-193-2\n\nUW-Stevens Point: 34-212-2\n\nUW-La Crosse: 49-273-3\n\nUW-Platteville: 24-123-3\n\nUW-Oshkosh: 34-162-0\n\nUW-Stout: 47-207-2\n\nUW-River Falls: 30-145-1\n\nCentral: 32-182-1\n\nSt. John's: 34-168-0\n\nLinfield: 34-197-3\n\nWesley: 24-185-2\n\nMount Union: 30-125-1\n\nKmic 2006\n\nAverett: 17-73-1 (receiving TD as well)\n\nOtterbein: 11-135-1\n\nMuskingum: 6-61-1\n\nHeidelberg: 12-126-2\n\nOhio Northern: 24-204-3\n\nWilmington: 13-74-2 (receiving TD as well)\n\nBaldwin-Wallace: 35-215-1\n\nCapital: 35-240-3\n\nJohn Carroll 19-75-3\n\nMarietta: 24-175-2\n\nHope: 6-43-1\n\nWheaton: 29-293-3\n\nCapital: 38-169-0\n\nSt. John Fisher: 42-371-3\n\nUW-Whitewater: 25-111-0\n\nBoth were sophomores when they had their big years, and Beaver's bad break in '06 leads us to spin the cliche anew: Junior jinx?\n\nHere's where Kmic and Beaver rank -- after the Stagg Bowl -- in comparison to the all-time great rushing seasons, by total yards and with playoffs included (unlike the official NCAA records before 2002):\n\nRicky Gales, Simpson, 2,424 in 11 games in 1989\n\nJustin Beaver, UW-Whitewater: 2,420 in 14 games in 2005\n\nDante Brown, Marietta: 2,385 in 10 games in 1996\n\nNate Kmic, Mount Union: 2,365 in 15 games in 2006\n\nChuck Moore, Mount Union: 2,349 in 14 games in 2001\n\nDan Pugh, Mount Union: 2,300 in 14 games in 2002\n\nR.J. Bowers, Grove City: 2,283 in 10 games in 1998\n\nCarey Bender, Coe: 2,243 in 10 games in 1994\n\nTony Sutton, Wooster: 2,240 in 12 games in 2004\n\nMark Robinson, St. John Fisher, 2,194 in 12 games in 2004\n\nIf there were a statistical way to quantify what Kleppe meant to his team, perhaps Gagliardi voters would have put that up against Brehm's 3,448 passing yards, 30 TDs and three interceptions and made a different decision. Instead, Kleppe had to be satisfied with a second consecutive Stagg Bowl (which I'm sure he wouldn't trade for a Gagliardi, as nice as the trophy is) and a D3football.com Defensive Player of the Year acknowledgement. The 6-0, 290-pound senior did have 14.5 sacks, including one in the Stagg Bowl, and 24 tackles for losses, not to mention perhaps the moment of the year. When the entire right side of Mary Hardin-Baylor's offensive line, three big dogs in all, devoted themselves to blocking Kleppe alone on a play in the Warhawks' 7-3 win in Texas, it showed what a force the Warhawks' big man was.\n\nRemember this year's great surprise players\n\nHe was no surprise to close followers of Springfield, since he established himself late last season. But from afar, Chris Sharpe's emergence as the nation's leading rusher (161.8 yards per game, 4.1 yards better than Kmic) and scorer (35 TDs and a two-point conversion, for 17.7 points per game) came as a surprise. The junior quarterback operated the Pride's triple-option offense to perfection, and helped a revival that included six more wins this season than last. His prowess as a scorer was so great that if you take away his seven-TD day against St. John Fisher in October, he and Kmic would have tied for the most TDs scored this season. That seven-TD game, by the way, produced a lengthy list of new records, presented on the Springfield Web site as The Sharpe Report.\n\nRemember this year's unsung heroes\n\nWe can't list them by name. We don't know all of their stories. If we did, they'd be sung heroes, right?\n\nStill, it only makes sense to acknowledge the bit-part players alongside the big-time ones. Without everybody working in concert, each season -- and really the whole college football experience -- wouldn't have been what it was.\n\nThis is the item that gives it up for the players who switched positions so the team would be better off. The coaches who changed their schemes to fit personnel. Or noticed subtle details from the press box, or while watching video.\n\nThe wedge-breakers, up-backs and rocket men. The guy who hustled from the backside of the play to make a touchdown-saving tackle. The players blocking downfield. The letter-writing recruiter. The groundskeepers and stadium staff.\n\nThe fullbacks. The cut-blockers. The guys who play man coverage so you can blitz. The long-snapper. The holder. Whoever made your line calls. The guy who kept your huddle together. Or held you back when you wanted to lose it.\n\nThe workout wonder that was so far ahead of the pack when you ran, you had to push yourself just to keep it respectable. The tight muscle-shirt wearing guy who did the same for you in the weight room.\n\nThe guy who barely got on the field for four years and appreciated it more than some of the full-time starters.\n\nGive it up for your unsung heroes. Don't forget about these guys.\n\nRemember the comeback kids\n\nWe don't mean the guys who led rallies, but those who rallied to have a great 2006 after '05 was ruined by injury.\n\nSt. John Fisher running back Mark Robinson and Hardin-Simmons quarterback Jordan Neal were two of the best among those.\n\nRobinson rushed for 1,570 yards and 24 TDs while sharing carries with James Reile, the back who stepped in last season when Robinson missed all but five games because of shoulder injuries. The duo, along with a Gene Lang-led defense, helped the Cardinals win the East bracket with a 31-0 blowout of Rowan. Robinson rushed for 110 yards and a TD in the semifinal loss to Mount Union, and finished his career with nearly 5,000 yards rushing. He was also an academic all-American.\n\nNeal came back for a sixth year at Hardin-Simmons after a broken collarbone cost him 2005. The quarterback was ultra-consistent, passing for at least 225 yards in every game but one, with a TD pass and a completion of 30 yards or longer in each game. He was second to Wabash QB Dustin Huff in passing efficiency, and led his team to the playoffs with an 8-2 mark. Both losses came against quarterfinalist Mary Hardin-Baylor, while there might have been a ninth win if lightning had not canceled the Cowboys game at Louisiana College with Hardin-Simmons leading 28-12 in the second quarter.\n\nThe great story we never told\n\nCortland State safety Stef Sair, we figured, would be a good feature come playoff time. After all, he knows what it takes to excel in a tournament. He was the Division III 174-pound wrestling champion in '05-'06. Despite the Red Dragons' 9-1 finish, they didn't make the playoffs, and we waited too long on Sair's story. He was calm and humble, even though he was a force on defense, returning punts and even on offense -- his 25-yard run accounted for Cortland's only touchdown against Rowan. We would have liked to let you get to know Sair a little better, but with 234 schools and 11 weeks to tell their stories (16 if you make it to the Stagg Bowl), we can't do it all.\n\nRemember the Division III players who might represent us in pro football\n\nWhitworth's 6-7, 264-pound tight end Michael Allan hauled in Division III's first NFL combine invitation in three years. But no one from our division played in the Jan. 14 Hula Bowl.\n\nDivision III players are rarely drafted, and without a combine invite or post-season all-star game, a player's best hope is likely the seventh round or a post-draft free-agent contract. Cornerback Tony Beckham of UW-Stout was a fourth-round pick of the Titans in 2002, while Widener wide receiver Michael Coleman was a seventh-round pick of the Falcons that year. The Raiders took Gustavus Adolphus receiver Ryan Hoag with the last pick of the 2003 draft, and it's been all free-agent contracts, even for Gagliardi Trophy Winners like Blake (St. John's, Vikings) and Brett (Linfield, Chargers) Elliott, ever since.\n\nStill, we've found that dozens of Division III players have at least caught a scout's eye, even if their NFL chances are a long shot. NFLDraftScout.com, a source used by USA Today, has at least a bare-bones listing for the following Division III players.

But if anything stood out among this year's most successful coaching runs, it was the influence of stability.\n\nAt Carnegie Mellon, Rich Lackner has been part of 31 consecutive non-losing seasons as a starlinebacker and coach. Lackner joined the staff after graduating in 1979, and became head coach in 1986. Two men who were with him that season, offensive coordinator Rich Erdelyi and defensive coordinator Tim Bodnar, helped him guide this year's 11-1 playoff team.\n\nMuch was made of Bob Berezowitz's retirement from UW-Whitewater after 22 years, but big reasons why the Warhawks were Stagg Bowl-bound for a second consecutive season were longtime assistants. Stan Zwiefel, the book-published architect of the UW-W offense, had 16 seasons experience with the Warhawks while defensive coordinator Brian Borland had 13.\n\nWesley offensive coordinator Chip Knapp has been alongside defensive-minded head coach Mike Drass since the early 90s. And while Mount Union doesn't have as many longtime assistants as it once did, most of its staff is home-grown, with former players filling several roles.\n\nIt took 16 seasons, but St. John Fisher coach Paul Vosburgh brought the Cardinals from a club football program to a national semifinalist. Mary Hardin-Baylor head coach Pete Fredenburg started the Crusaders program from scratch a decade ago.\n\nThe big coaching lessons this season seemed to be that the benefits of stability and longevity can be measured in victories.\n\nBest excuse for not updating the team's Web site\n\nWe'd give Dubuque a harder time about still having a preseason article out front in January, but according to the fine print on the site itself, Vince Brautigam is responsible for both maintaining the site and coaching the team.\n\nBrautigam excelled at the latter part of his job, improving from 2-8 to 6-4, with a season-ending win over Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference power Wartburg and a top-half finish in the IIAC. Dubuque was competitive in the second half of '05, bonded on a May '06 trip to Germany and then turned in the school's first winning season since 1987.\n\nThe six wins was more than the Spartans had from 2002-05 combined. Brautigam, hired before the 2001 season, was 7-43 before this year, but finally got the program on the track he wants it on.\n\nSo no rush on that website thing.\n\n(For the record, there are articles from the '06 season on the Dubuque site under Team News/Recaps)\n\nBest excuse for missing the team bus\n\nSt. John Fisher defensive coordinator Blaise Faggiano gets kudos just for showing up to the Mount Union game, as he and his wife left for Guatemala on Tuesday of game week to complete the adoption of a 7-month-old boy.\n\nFaggiano returned to Rochester, N.Y., on Friday night, long after the Cardinals had left for Alliance, Ohio. So, having done most of his scheming for the game on Sunday and Monday, he rode with Fisher alums and made it to Alliance in time to coach the biggest game in the program's history Saturday at noon. Holding the Purple Raiders to 24 offensive points may not have been enough to win, but only Baldwin-Wallace and Capital slowed Mount Union as much this season.\n\nAnd their defensive coaches likely had less hectic weeks in which to prepare.\n\nWhy Larry Kehres keeps growing on us, even as his teams are whipping us\n\nIt would be a lot easier if we could just hate the guy.\n\nInstead though, the more we get to know the man behind Mount Union's success, the more we like him.\n\nThree moments from this season stand out:\n\nMany of you heard about this first one. Before Stagg Bowl XXXIV, Kehres had kind words for UW-Whitewater coach Bob Berezowitz, coaching his final game after 22 at the helm.\n\n\"He said to me 'If I have to get beat, I wouldn't mind getting beat today,â€™\" Berezowitz recalled after the 35-16 loss. \"I knew he didn't mean it though,\" the coach laughed.\n\nThere was no victorious riding off into the sunset for Berezowitz, who quarterbacked UW-Whitewater to an NAIA football championship in 1966, a year after he was a catcher on the Warhawks' baseball champion. Kehres coached for the 10th time in Salem since 1993, and took home the championship trophy for the ninth time.\n\nNot many know about these last two. Pat, Pat, Gordon, Ryan and the rest of the D3football.com crew have been showing up at enough games over the years to recognize a lot of coaches, and have them recognize us. As the playoffs whittle it down to teams we've usually seen before, we're often fortunate enough to be able to walk up to a head coach on the sideline before a game and get a last-minute update on injuries, the team mood, what they think about the weather, etc.\n\nThese are things we often use in the broadcast, to bring the listener closer to the game's site and its principals.\n\nTalking to Kehres before the Stagg Bowl this year, he barely mentioned football. Kehres asked how my 2-year-old son was doing, recalling how he was yelling in the background when it was my turn to ask a question during the previous week's conference call. He complimented by my suit (and apparently he's seen us enough times to know sweaters and polo shirts are as nice as we get, at least until the championship game). And Kehres shared observations about the diverse state of Virginia, which he has taken an interest in as his friend and former defensive coordinator Don Montgomery has been head coach at Emory and Henry the past two seasons.\n\nHere we were moments before the biggest game of the season, and Kehres is so prepared he's beyond worry. He's asking me about my kids, which is about the furthest thing from the Stagg Bowl.\n\nAfter the St. John Fisher/Mount Union postgame news conference, Kehres introduced a young man from the St. John Fisher student newspaper, and told us he had been contacted by him several times and that he was interested in journalism. You'd figure a coach who just won a national semifinal in somewhat of a struggle, would blow the guy off and go enjoy the win with family, players or fans. Instead, Kehres pulled us all together for a picture. We never did get to talk journalism with the guy, who appears from the paper's Web site to be Mike Spier (if you're out there, drop us a line), but we're frozen in time in that camera. Maybe it was nothing more than a funny moment, but hopefully it was a lesson to that student (as well as the rest of us) that there are nice guys at the top.\n\nThere are those who say Kehres has a fiery side, that he hates to lose, and isn't always a saint. But you've got to be a member of the Purple Raiders inner circle to see that. Quite frankly, behind closed doors is where most of those moments should stay.\n\nFor the rest of us, affiliated with the 233 schools that didn't win the past two championships or nine since 1993, we'll probably keep respecting a guy we can't find a way to hate.\n\nThen again, all love and no hate -- what could be more Division III-appropriate than that?\n\nThe memorable teams\n\nThese might be the greatest honors, since football is pretty much the ultimate team game. No back can truly excel without a great line, and a great offense wins few games without a great defense. Football finds a role for fat guys and thin guys, fast and slow, tall and short, black and white, brutish and those more concerned with finesse. There are even roles for the young (players) and old (coaches, who are so crucial to success).\n\nWhen we celebrate the memorable teams, we celebrate what all those individuals have sacrificed to bring everything together.\n\nRemember this year's great surprise teams\n\nComing off a 1-9 season, Emory & Henry gave itself a chance to win the Old Dominion Athletic Conference championship, but lost 24-6 at Washington and Lee, and finished 6-4. But it was two playoff teams, Carnegie Mellon and Springfield, that register as the year's biggest surprises.\n\nAs the Tartans continued to win, questions were raised about the competition they played (and they were legitimate questions, as CMU won 10 regular-season games against precisely one team with a winning record). But they were rewarded for their 10-0 effort nonetheless, and with a home game to open the playoffs against Millsaps, the Tartans scored all 21 of their points in the second half during a shutout victory.\n\nThe Pride, as mentioned elsewhere, got a great season from quarterback Chris Sharpe and went from 4-6 to 10-2, bowing out in a playoff rematch against St. John Fisher, 27-21.\n\nNotable steps forward\n\nGenerally, the notable steps forward are taken by programs who seem to be headed in the right direction and aren't just one-year wonders. There's no way to know for sure what's really an indication of what, but we figure that Emory and Henry's five-win improvement to 6-4 and Springfield's six-win jump to 10-2 will mark returns to prominence for both programs. Bethany and Menlo, meanwhile, each improved significantly in the wins column, but were still subject to lopsided late-season defeats that indicated there's still a ways to go. Dickinson, which became an eight-win playoff team, may be a candidate to fall back to the pack as the Red Devils lose 19 seniors.\n\nPuget Sound, with one win from 2001-03, was a seven-win team that might soon be a playoff contender. The same can be said of Rochester, which was competitive in losses to Union, Hobart and Alfred, and Kean, no longer a \"gimme\" in the NJAC.\n\nTo figure out who was moving and shaking, Around the Nation charted the increase and decrease in wins from last season for all 234 teams. This generally showed who was on the right track, but charting wins only can be deceiving, since teams didn't always play the same number of games they did in 2005.\n\nHusson, for instance, surged to 6-4 after a 3-4 record in 2005. Three more wins, same number of losses, but odd circumstances were responsible. In 2005, the Eagles scheduled eight games, including a same-season home-and-home with Becker. Then NAIA Southern Virginia cancelled its game while Husson was heading south from Maine. The Eagles played a full 10 this year, and Southern Virginia was not among them.\n\nMore often, the postseason created a difference in the number of games played. Whitworth went to 11-1 after a 5-3 season, Their 12 games this season came from a 10-game schedule and two playoff contests. In '05, Whitworth had a nine-game schedule before Lewis and Clark cancelled, and the Pirates missed the postseason.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the biggest movers among the 234:\n\n21 had three more wins in '06 than in '05: Allegheny (6-4 in 2006/3-7 in 2005), Austin (4-6/1-9), Baldwin-Wallace (7-3/4-6), Bethany (4-6/1-9), Concordia, Wis. (10-1/7-3), Colorado College (5-5/2-8), Gustavus Adolphus (6-4/3-7), Husson (6-4/3-4), Illinois College (6-4/3-7), Kean (7-4/4-6), Massachusetts Maritime (3-6/0-9), Middlebury (6-2/3-5), Minnesota-Morris (7-3/4-6), Mississippi College (5-5/2-8), Newport News Apprentice (7-3/4-6), Puget Sound (7-3/4-5), Rochester (7-4/4-6), St. Lawrence (5-4/2-7), Wesleyan (3-5/0-8), Wheaton (10-2/7-3), Wilkes (11-1/8-3).\n\n12 had four more wins: Bethel (9-2/5-5), Dickinson (8-3/4-6), Dubuque (6-4/2-8), Franklin (9-1/5-5), Lebanon Valley (6-4/2-8) Menlo (4-6/0-10), Mount Ida (5-4/1-9), Rhodes (6-4/2-8), Springfield (10-2/4-6), St. John Fisher (12-2/8-3), UW-La Crosse (9-2/5-4), UW-Platteville (5-5/1-9).\n\nThree had five more wins: Nichols (5-4/0-9), Emory & Henry (6-4/1-9), Millsaps (7-4/2-7).\n\nFour had six more wins: Springfield (10-2/4-6), Coast Guard (8-3/2-7), Whitworth (11-1/5-3), Carnegie Mellon (11-1/5-5).\n\nNotable steps backward\n\nDelaware Valley, Johns Hopkins, Lakeland, Linfield, Monmouth and Wabash were all playoff teams in '05 that dropped off by three or four wins in '06. Union did the same, going from 11-1 to 7-3, but still got in. Willamette has gone from '04 playoff team to 2-7 in '06, but theirs wasn't this season's most precipitous fall.\n\nConcordia-Moorhead had St. John's on the ropes again this season, but lost 14-12 to fall to 0-3. The Cobbers hobbled home 4-6, with a 35-point loss to St. Olaf the lowlight. That was a big difference from 2005, when Concordia-Moorhead was 10-2 and a second-round playoff team.\n\nThiel was a second-round playoff team in '05 as well, but lost a lot of offense. Quarterback Darrell Satterfield and receiver Brandon Chambers graduated, and an offense that averaged 32.9 points per game scored only 21.2. The Tomcats dropped from 11-1 to .500, though the losses were by 14, 10, seven, four and four.\n\nFerrum fell even further, from 9-1, leading the nation in rushing and in the playoffs to 2-7. The Panthers were competitive in early-season losses to Guilford and Bridgewater (Va.), the latter in overtime, before stomping Shenandoah 42-0. But the losses mounted, and November was unkind: They were outscored 110-21, in a 55-14 loss to North Carolina Wesleyan followed by a 55-7 defeat vs. Christopher Newport.\n\nThose who fell:\n\nNineteen had three fewer wins: Adrian (5-5 in 2006/8-2 in 2005), Albright (2-8/5-5), Anderson (2-8/5-5), Augustana (7-3/10-2), East Texas Baptist (3-7/6-4), Johns Hopkins (5-5/8-3), Lakeland (5-5/8-3), Martin Luther (2-8/5-3), Monmouth (7-3/10-1), Moravian (4-6/7-4), Otterbein (4-6/7-3), Sewanee (2-8/5-5), Utica (3-7/6-4), UW-Eau Claire (3-7/6-4), UW-Stout (3-7/6-4), Wabash (8-2/11-1), Westfield State (1-8/4-5), Willamette (2-7/5-4), Worcester Polytech (3-6/6-3).\n\nTwelve had four fewer wins: Beloit (1-9/5-5), Bowdoin (2-6/6-2), Delaware Valley (8-3/12-1), Fitchburg State (4-5/8-3), Frostburg State (2-7/6-5), Hampden-Sydney (4-6/8-2), Linfield (6-3/10-1), Luther (2-8/6-4), Methodist (4-6/8-2), Ohio Wesleyan (3-7/7-3), Union (7-3/11-1), William Paterson (1-9/5-5).\n\nOne had five fewer wins: Colby (2-6/7-1)\n\nTwo had six fewer wins: Concordia-Moorhead (4-6/10-2), Thiel (5-5/11-1)\n\nOne had seven fewer wins: Ferrum (2-7/9-2)\n\nNotable steps in quicksand\n\nThirty-nine teams had the same number of wins as in 2005, including 14-1 UW-Whitewater, which returned to the Stagg Bowl, and 2-8 Cornell, which changed coaches and started 2-0.\n\nThirty-four teams won one fewer game than last season, including independent Huntingdon, which replaced N.C Wesleyan, Maryville and Westminster (Mo.) -- a combined 12-18 in '05 -- on its schedule with Ithaca, Wesley, Thomas More and LaGrange, a combined 26-18 in '06. The Hawks went 6-4 against the tougher opponents, after a breakout 7-2 season.\n\nTwenty-nine teams won once more in '06 than they did in '05, including Mount Union (15-0/14-1) and Grinnell (2-8/1-9).\n\nTwenty-nine teams also won twice more, including Wooster, which was a quiet 8-2 after a 6-4 season, and Concordia (Ill.), Juniata and Tri-State, who each stepped forward to 2-8 from 0-10. Macalester also went 2-7 after an 0-9 year.\n\nTwenty-five teams lost twice more, including those who went from playoff-worthy to just above .500 like Cal Lutheran (6-3/8-1), Ohio Northern (6-4/8-2) and Salisbury (6-5/8-3) and those who took steps back instead of breaking the .500 barrier, like FDU-Florham and Knox (both 2-8/4-6).\n\nProof that wins are hard to come by\n\nPlaying in the mighty Ohio Athletic Conference, Heidelberg finished its third consecutive 0-10 season. Senior Student Princes have to go back to their freshman year for memories of their only career win, which might make the rest of us realize that nothing is a given. Victories are to be cherished, never taken for granted.\n\nHeidelberg's season-opening loss came 48-34 against Oberlin, who in 2001 snapped a 44-game losing streak and a 59-game North Coast Athletic Conference losing streak. The Student Princes turned over their staff after the season, and the new coaches will have to win a game next year to keep Heidelberg from passing Oberlin or some of the others who currently outdistance the Student Princes. Bates, playing eight-game seasons in the New England Small College Athletic Conference, lost 37 in a row from 1991-95. Marietta lost 41 in a row from 1981-84. And Macalester once lost 50 in a row in the '70s.\n\nWe tip the cap to Lewis & Clark for finishing out the string this year, one season after playing its non-conference games but canceling its Northwest Conference slate, and going 0-4. The Pioneers played five more games this season, but had the same number of victories. They gave up 70 in back-to-back October road losses and 61 three weeks later, but we acknowledge the toughness of the 42 Pioneers on the roster, including the 17 freshmen who fulfilled a commitment even when the future of football at the school looked a bit uncertain. Interim head coach Chris Sulages and assistants Scott Pierce, Ian Falconer and Jarrod Murrieta kept it together for the Pioneers, who have the support of the administration -- for now -- in rebuilding the football program.\n\nBecker still hasn't won a game in its two seasons, while Eureka, Hiram and Wisconsin Lutheran all backslid from 1-9 records in 2005.\n\nThe longest current losing streaks in Division III:\n\nHeidelberg (36 consecutive losses, last win vs. Marietta, 21-13, on Oct. 4, 2003; 0-10 in 2006)\n\nLewis and Clark (18 consecutive losses, last win vs. Claremont-Mudd-Scripps, 27-11, Oct. 9, 2004; 0-9 in 2006)\n\nBecker (18 consecutive losses, no wins in program history; 0-9 in 2006)\n\nEureka (16 consecutive losses, last win vs. Concordia (Ill.), 32-13, Sept. 24, 2005; 0-9 in 2006)\n\nHiram (16 consecutive losses, last win vs. Earlham, 7-2, Oct. 1, 2005; 0-10 in 2006)\n\nWisconsin Lutheran (16 consecutive losses, last win vs. Tri-State, 37-14, Oct. 1, 2005; 0-10 in 2006)\n\nLook Mom, a new conference!\n\nThere were several movers in 2006 that came in with mixed results. Coast Guard (8-3) won six more games in its first season in the New England Football Conference than it did in its last season in the Liberty League. Austin became a 4-6 team in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference after going 1-9 in the American Southwest Conference. Those made sense, as the Bears and Kangaroos each joined conferences considered to be weaker than the ones they left. But Menlo's jump to 4-6 as a member of the normally strong Northwest Conference was baffling following an 0-10 season as an independent. The Oaks were just 1-5 in NWC games, however.\n\nBuffalo State, Plymouth State and Rose-Hulman saw virtually no difference in their new conferences, however. The Bengals were 3-7 in their first season in the New Jersey Athletic Conference after going 3-6 the last year in the Atlantic Central Football Conference. Plymouth State joined the NEFC and went 4-5, not much different from the 4-6 mark the Panthers put up in 2005 as an independent. And the Engineers may have engineered a move from the SCAC to the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference, but change was minimal: A 6-4 2006, after a 5-5 '05. Rose-Hulman was 3-4 in conference after a 2-4 SCAC mark, while Buffalo State was 2-5 in the NJAC after a 1-4 ACFC mark.\n\nSo for Colorado College (joining the SCAC next year) and other anticipated movers, the lesson is Be Like Menlo.\n\nRemember that the more things change, the more they stay the same\n\nA new year doesn't always guarantee a new result. Five Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference teams had same number of wins this year as in 2005, four with the exact same record. St. Olaf (8-2), Carleton (4-6), Hamline (3-7) and Augsburg (1-9) had no change year-to-year, while St. John's went 11-2 this season after an 11-1 mark last year. UW-Whitewater eliminated the Johnnies from the playoffs' West bracket each time.\n\nThe biggest stunner among the group may have been Carleton, which upset eventual MIAC champ Bethel 17-14 on Sept. 23 and earned itself an Around the Nation spotlight on Oct. 5. The Knights lost six of their last seven, however, including four times by five points or fewer, to end up with the same record as 2005.\n\nRemember the first-half teams that went bad in the second half\n\nCarleton is one. Sul Ross State, which started 5-1 and was in the playoff picture, is another. Their lone loss through Oct. 21 was to eventual quarterfinalist Mary Hardin-Baylor, but the Lobos dropped games at Hardin-Simmons 56-14, vs. Louisiana College 35-28 and at Mississippi College 31-7 to finish 5-4. Steve Wright is still leading one of the great revivals in Division III football, bringing Sul Ross to a winning season from back-to-back 0-10s in 2002 and '03. But at 5-1, folks tend to think there might end up a way to describe the season beyond \"winning.\"\n\nRemember the good middle-season teams\n\nBuena Vista had a crazy season, losing three, winning four straight from Sept. 30-Oct. 21, then losing its final three. The Beavers were 1-2 in overtime games, including two OT losses in the final three games. But considering they were outscored 78-20 in games at Bethel, vs. Central and at Coe (combined 26-6 record) to start the season, the finish was with a flourish.\n\nRemember the good second-half teams (The slow start, strong finish award)\n\nHope began the year 0-3, with competitive losses at Central (24-13), at DePauw (23-14) and vs. Wheaton (35-21). Two of those teams made the playoffs, and the three of them had a combined record of 26-7. The Flying Dutchmen pulled off a 24-21 win vs. Albion and a 49-43 overtime victory against Alma on the way to a 7-0 roll through the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association. However, the early losses didn't help when it came time to set the playoff matchups, and Hope had none, losing 49-0 at eventual champion Mount Union."
