Before she made the turn to the final nine holes of her career with the Irish, she played back-to-back bogeys on holes 17 and 18. While on the front nine, she played at one-over par (37), including a birdie on the eighth hole. Park compiled a four-day total of 318 (+30) and finished the tournament tied for 111th place. Freshman Kristina Nhim (Cypress, Calif./Cypress) began the day on the 10th hole with a birdie and she remained at one-under par until the 12th hole when she bogeyed.

A five-under par round by Paul McNamara III (Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.) helped the University of Notre Dame men’s golf team to a ninth-place finish at the 2011 NCAA Florida Regional on Saturday at the Golden Ocala Golf Course in Ocala, Fla. The Irish finished the tournament at one over par (865) after a final-day total of 287 (-1). Several individual and team records fell for the Irish at the Florida Regional, including the lowest 54-hole team score. Notre Dame improved on the previous-best mark by 12 shots with its 865 score, taking down the 877 total that was posted back in 2005. The final-round total of 287 also is the second-lowest single-round score, bested only by the 282 third-round performance in ’05. McNamara put together a near-flawless round on his final 18 holes, carding six birdies with only one bogey on the par-four 17th hole. After playing the back nine at two under (34), the sophomore improved on that mark by one shot on the front nine, finishing at 33 (-3). Overall, McNamara pulled back to even par (216) for the tournament, which was good for a share of 24th place. For McNamara, the final round 67 marks the lowest round of his Irish career, while also going into the Notre Dame record books as the lowest single-round score posted in NCAA competition since the format switched to stroke-play scoring. The previous record of 68 had been shot three times, including in the first round of the ’11 Florida Regional by freshman Niall Platt (Santa Barbara, Calif.). The 216 (E) 54-hole score also is McNamara’s lowest three-round tournament score, besting the 218 (+2) he posted at the ’10 St. Mary’s Invitational. Platt, meanwhile, concluded the most successful 54-hole tournament for a Notre Dame golfer since the NCAA changed to a 54-hole format in 1989. The freshman ended his tournament at six under (210) after carding a final-round score of 73 (+1), which placed him in a tie for 10th overall. Platt bested the previous Irishmark by five shots, which was set by Eric Deutsch back in ’05. The tie for 10th also goes down as the highest individual finish for an Irish competitor, improving on Deutsch’s tie for 20th in the ’05 regional. Jeff Chen (Walnut, Calif.) concluded his final season with theIrish and first taste of NCAA competition as the third-best finisher of therotation. The senior carded a 74 (+2) in his final round, which saw him record three birdies and five bogeys, to wrap up his tournament at 219 (+3). He finished in a tie for 33rd amongst the field. Max Scodro (Chicago, Ill.) ended his tournament with the best of his three rounds coming on the final day. The junior carded eight pars along with five birdies, four bogeys and a double bogey to post a 73 (+1). For the tournament, Scodro finished in a tie for 50th place at seven over par (223). Chris Walker (The Woodlands, Texas) joined Scodro in the tie for 50th after recording his second-straight round of 74 (+2) to finish at 223 (+7) overall. The junior played his most consistent round of the tournament, tallying 12 pars along with two birdies and four bogeys. The host Florida Gators pulled away on the final day to secure its berth into the NCAA Championship, finishing at 18 under par (846) after shooting 11 under par (277) on Saturday. Augusta State finished second at 12 under par (852), while the final three teams to qualify for the NCAA Championship were Kennesaw State (-11, 853), North Carolina State (-9, 855) and Arkansas (-8, 856). TheIrish season officially comes to a close with the squad finishing their season with an overall record of 86-32 (.729).\n\n3. A five-run lead in the top of the sixth was not enough for Notre Dame as second-ranked Michigan used six runs in the bottom half of the frame Saturday night during an NCAA Softball Ann Arbor Regional contest at Alumni Field in Ann Arbor, Mich. Backed against the ropes, the Wolverines trailed 8-3 before grinding out their final six runs on six hits for the comeback win, 9-8. Michigan (53-5), the tournament’s 10th overall seeded squad and top in the Ann ArborRegional, moves on to face Kentucky in the regional final on Sunday. Second-seeded Notre Dame ended its season with a 46-11 mark two weeks after winning the BIG EAST Conference regular season title. The first elimination game of afternoon saw Notre Dame blank Western Michigan, 4-0. Fourth-seeded Western Michigan (25-30) was triumphant in the regular season meeting between the two teams and snapped Notre Dame’s 21-game home winning streak.The Irish have now won 10 of the last 11 meetings with the Broncos.\n\n-Game 1-\n\nNotre Dame’s first batter of the game – Alexa Maldonado – tripled to right-center and scored on a sacrifice fly off the bat of Heather Johnson. That run would hold up to prove to be the game-winner. Another leadoff extra-base hit for the Irish came in the second when Erin Marrone doubled to left-center. She moved to third on Dani Miller’s sacrifice bunt and would notscore. Courtney Rousseau doubled to start the bottom of the second and was one of two Broncos in scoring position when Laura Winter (25-4) fanned a pair to end the threat. Sadie Pitzenberger doubled in the third, Katie Fleury singled and the Broncos held strong by leaving two more Irish runners stranded. Western Michigan loaded the bases and could not deliver in the third despite a career-high fourth walk issued by Winter. Meredith Whitney (17-5) walked the bases loaded in the fourth for Heather Johnson, who came a few feet away from a grand slam before centerfielder Jennifer Tschetter made the third out with a snag at the wall. Whitney scattered seven Irish hits and gave up three earned runs while walking four. Kayla Houston tossed the final 1.1 innings and gave up an unearned tally. Three two-out fifth-inning singles to right by the Broncos went for naught when Kayla Houston fouled out to Alexia Clay. After Western Michigan left the bases loaded for a second time, Brianna Jorgensborg whistled the first pitch she saw over the fence in center to give Notre Dame a 2-0 cushion. Two batters later, Maldonado laid down a drag bunt and mounted her horse to score on Clay’s two-out double. Amy Buntin dropped an RBI single to add in another score during the seventh for the Irish. Winter went 5.0 innings andfanned four with O’Donnell earning the save after giving up one hit in the final pair of stanzas.\n\n-Game 2-\n\nShortly after Winter retired Michigan’s fourth and fifth batters on strikes with two runners in scoring position, Jorgensborg roped a two-RBI single in the top of the second to give Notre Dame a 2-0 lead Jorgensborg cashed in on earlier singles by Pitzenberger and Fleury. Notre Dame took a 2-1 lead against the Wolverines in the 2010 season finale before Michigan rattled off 11 unanswered scores to end the season for the Irish. Dorian Shaw singled home a run in the bottom of the third and Big Ten Player of the Year Amanda Chidester was walked by O’Donnell to load the bases. Ashley Lane, who hit a grand slam earlier in the day against Kentucky, kept the scoring drive alive as she singled in two more runs to give Michigan a 3-2 edge. Fleury added a single in the fourth after Pitzenberger struck out for the first time on the season. In fact, Pitzenberger’s last strikeout came when facing Jordan Taylor (31-4) during the 2010 NCAA Ann Arbor Regional. Miller belted a two-run shot that narrowly cleared the fence in left to boost Notre Dame back ahead, 4-3. The fifth for Notre Dame started when Amy Buntin singled to right. Buntin moved all the way to third on Maldonado’s sacrifice bunt, with Maldonado later stealing second. Buntin added another run on Taylor’s wild pitch. Soon after, Pitzenberger was issued a walk for the first time this season, her first in 108 at-bats dating back to 2010. Michigan put its first two batters on base in the bottom of the fifth, though with no one away Fleury made a stellar snag at short and tossed it to Johnson at third just in time to make the force out.Fleury caught a line drive for the second out and Pitzenberger made an over-the-shoulder grab in deep right to close the door on the Wolverines. The fifth Irish run scored with two outs came when Jorgensborg jaunted from second on Maldonado’s infield grounder as Notre Dame doubled up the Wolverines, 6-3. Notre Dame took advantage of a walk and error in the sixth to plate three unearned runs. Johnson drove in Maldonado with a single up the middle for her first hit of the NCAA Regional. Taylor allowed a season-high seven runs in Michigan’sloss to Kentucky and eclipsed that total against the Irish. Then came the rapture. Marley Powers knocked a leadoff double to ignite things for Michigan in the bottom of the sixth. Powers was joined on base by two more Wolverines and an infield base hit by Bree Evans made it a four-run game at 8-4. Another infield single by Lyndsay Doyle cut the lead to three. O’Donnell did her job by limiting Michigan to groundballs and gave way for Jody Valdivia (10-5) with no outs in the sixth. Valdivia walked in Dorian Shaw and a sacrifice fly and RBI single later knotted the score at 8-8. Powers knocked in the go-ahead run by popping an RBI single to left which was one of six Michigan hits in the stanza. Not going down without a fight, Fleury doubled to the wall to start the top of the seventh for her third hit of the night. Marrone was successful with a sacrifice bunt tomove Fleury to third. Two outs were on the board when Jorgensborg was issued an intentional walk. Buntin’s grounder forced the third out at second to end the game. Jordan gave up eight runs – four earned – with nine strikeouts in thewin. The loss went Valdivia who gave up one earned run on two hits in the sixth. O’Donnell was good for 2.2 innings and issued three walks with the Wolverines getting the better of her with six hits and five earned runs. Winter lasted the first 2.1 frames and gave up three hits and three earned runs.\n\n4. Notre Dame entered the 2010 season baseball finale needing a victory over Louisville to reach the BIG EAST conference tournament, but the Irish lost 13-3. Almost one year later to the day, Notre Dame was in the exact same scenario. The Irish erased the memory of 2010 and secured a spot in the BIG EAST tournament with a heart-stopping 2-1 victory over the Cardinals at Patterson Stadium in Louisville on Saturday. No surprise, the game was decided by a single run and went down to the final pitch. Notre Dame has now played in 19 games this season decided by the slimmest margin. The Irish are 9-10 in one-run games. Notre Dame took a 2-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth inning. Freshman RHP Sean Fitzgerald, who came into the game with two outs in the eighth, retired thefirst two Cardinals. With two down, Fitzgerald induced a ground ball from Zak Wasserman that seemed destine to end the game, but sophomore 2B Frank DeSico’s throw sailed wide of first base. Wasserman reached on the error and then Fitzgerald issued a two-out walk to put the tying run in scoring position and winning run on base, but the rookie right-handed hurler got Drew Haynes to ground into a fielder’s choice to end the game. DeSico fielded the grounder cleanly and flipped to senior SS Mick Doyle on the second base bag. Fitzgerald picked up his fifth save of the year and all five have come in BIG EAST action. Hetossed 1.1 hitless and scoreless innings of relief. Fellow rookie RHP Dan Slania picked up the victory and improved to 2-3 on the year. He tossed 3.1 scoreless innings of relief. Slania allowed three hits and one walk, but got a trio of critical double plays. Fifth-year senior RF Herman Petzold was the only Irish player with multiple hits. He went 2-for-4 with a run scored. Freshman 1B Trey Mancini went 1-for-3 with a run scored and senior SS Mick Doyle went 1-for-3 with an RBI single. Sophomore DH Adam Norton added a sacrifice fly. Travis Tingle wassaddled with the loss for the Cardinals. The righty allowed a pair of earnedruns on five hits in 6.1 innings of work. Tingle struck out two and walked three. Doyle gave the Irish a 1-0 lead in the top of the second inning. Petzold opened the inning with a single and moved into scoring position following Norton’s sacrifice bunt. After a ground out and walk, Doyle lined 1-0 offering from Tingle to right field togive Notre Dame the game’s first lead. Notre Dame pushed the lead to 2-0 on Norton’s sacrifice fly in the top of the second inning. Louisville and junior 2BRyan Wright specifically cut the Irish deficit to 2-1. Wright singled home Jeff Gardner. Wright went 9-for-11 with two home runs and five RBI in the series. Gardner went 8-for-12 on the weekend with five doubles, one home run and three RBI. The tandem combined for 11 of the Cardinals’ 22 runs and 17 of their 34 hits in the series. Senior RHP Todd Miller worked into the fifth inning. Miller allowed one run on seven hits before giving way to Slania. With runners on the corners and one out in the Louisville fifth inning after a base hit, sacrifice bunt and bunt single, Slania induced a double play ground out from the unlikeliest of candidates, Gardner. Wright opened the bottom of the sixth inning with a single, but Slania got a fly out and the Cade Stallings lined into a double play to end the inning. Notre Dame got an odd and possibly favorable call on a double play in the eighth inning. Drew Haynes opened with a seeing-eye single through the left side of the infield. Adam Engel then tried to execute a sacrifice bunt, but he popped it up. Irish 3B Greg Sherry appeared to bobble the pop up anddropped the ball. Sherry threw to Doyle at second base, who tagged out the runner. The umpire ruled Sherry caught the pop out and lost it on the transfer. So, when Doyle applied the tag to the base runner, he was also out. Notre Dame opens the BIG EAST tournament against top-seed Connecticut at 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday.\n\n5.

The Notre Dame women’s golf team is in a tie for 23rd place (925/+61) after the third day of the NCAA Championship Friday at the Traditions Club Golf Course in Bryan, Texas. Junior Becca Huffer (Denver, Colo./Littleton) carded a one-over par 73 during the round and improved to a tie for 35th place. The Irish battled gusty winds on the course, but beat the rain and a two and a half hour rain delay that has forced six teams to complete the second round Saturday morning. Huffer remains atop the leaderboard for the Irish as the junior carded a 73 (+1) on the day. She posted two birdies and a bogey during the front nine for a 35 (-1), followed by three bogeys and a birdie on the backnine to finish the day at one-over par. Freshman Nicole Zhang (Calgary, Alberta/Bishop Carroll) recorded her best round of the tournament so far with a two-over par 74. After beginning the day with a bogey on the first hole and the third hole, Zhang recovered with a birdie on the seventh hole to make the turn at one-over par. During the back nine she posted back-to-back bogeys on the 15th and 16th holes and finished the day by sinking a birdie to complete the third round at two-over par and in a tie for 73rd place.Senior captain Katie Conway (Wading River, N.Y./Shoreham-Wading River) posted an 80 (+8) on the day. She recorded a 38(+2) during the front nine, but with three double bogeys, a bogey and a birdie Conway posted a six-over par 42 on the back nine of the course and is now in a tie for 88th place. Senior So-Hyun Park (Seoul, South Korea/Bradenton Prep Academy) also registered an eight-over par total as she posted 40 (+4)during both the front and back nine of the course to round out the Irish score. The first hole continued to present a challenge for Park as she posted a bogey to begin the day. Freshman Kristina Nhim (Cypress, Calif./Cypress) placed an 83 (+11) on the board. The front nine of the course was a challenge for the freshman as she played 10-over par, but improved to a 37 (+1) after the turn. The Irish began the final round of competition today with a 9:30 a.m. (ET) tee time off of 10.\n\n2. The Notre Dame men’s golf team moved into 10th place after day two of the NCAA Florida Regional Friday at the Golden Ocala Golf Course in Ocala, Fla. The Irish fired a two-over par (290) score on day two for a 36-hole total of 578 (+2). Notre Dame’s 36-hole score of 578 is the lowest mark after two rounds in NCAA Championship competition in program history, besting the previous low mark set in 1953 when the squad ended at 591. Augusta State leads the field, recovering from a two-over par round in its first round to shoot the round of the tournament so far at 13-under par (275), moving them to 11 under (565) overall. North Carolina State and Florida hold a share ofsecond place at seven under (569). Individually, Mitchell Sutton of North Carolina State leads the field at nine under par (135) after carding a second round 67 (-5). Southeastern Louisiana’s Philipp Westermann (136, -8) sits alone in second, while Niall Platt (Santa Barbara, Calif.) of the Irish is alone in third at seven under par (137). After carding a bogey free round on Thursday, Platt recorded only one bogey along with four birdies for his second consecutive under-par round of the tournament (69, -3). The freshman goes down in the annals of the Notre Dame NCAA record book, besting Cole Isban’s 36-hole mark of 146 set back in ’05. Jeff Chen (Walnut, Calif.) recorded the other under-par round for the Irish on day two, carding a one under par, 71. The lone senior in the rotation finished the day with 13 pars along with three birdies and two bogeys. After 36 holes of play, Chen is tied for 29th amongst the field at 145 (+1). Chris Walker (The Woodlands, Texas) posted the third-best score of the day for the Irish, finishing at two over (74). The junior recorded only five pars on the day, to go along with six birdies, six bogeys and a double bogey on the eighth hole. He is tied for 48th overall with a two-day total of 149 (+5).Paul McNamara III (Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.) joins Walker in the tie for 48th, after firing a second-day score of 77 (+5). The sophomore finished the back nine at three over, which included a string of five consecutive bogeys, but with birdies on holes one and four had battled back to one over. A pair of bogeys and a double bogey on the final four holes of his round would drop him back to five over on the day. Max Scodro (Chicago, Ill.) was the final Irish score counted on day two’s action. The junior concluded his second 18 holes with a 76 (+4), comprised of 12 pars, two birdies, three bogeys and a triple bogey on the eighth hole. After 36 holes, Scodro is tied for 54th at six over par (150). Notre Dame teed off its final round at 8:20 a.m. (ET) today onhole 10 alongside Missouri and UCF.\n\n3. Kentucky pitcher Chanda Bell limited to No. 19 Notre Dame to a pair of hits while leading the 21st-ranked Wildcats to an 8-0, five-inning win over Notre Dame to open theNCAA Softball Tournament Friday at Michigan’s Alumni Field in Ann Arbor, Mich. Bell recorded her seventh shutout on the year and was backed by a defense that made big play after big play to leave three Notre Dame runners stranded in scoring position. Bell (14-6) did the deed while issuing one walk and did not strike out a single Irish batter. The Irish (45-10) dropped back-to-back games for the third time on the season and will now play Western Michigan, a 5-0 loser Friday night to top seed Michigan. The elimination contest will begin at 2:30 p.m. (ET) today and will be televised live on ESPN. After losing in the BIG EAST Conference Championship semifinals by a 6-0 count to Louisville last week, Notre Dame suffered consecutive shutout losses for the first time since the opening weekend of the 2009 season. Notre Dame, the Ann Arbor Region’s second-seeded squad, started its 16th NCAA appearance having to work from behind but was never able to gain enough offensive momentum to overcome an early deficit. The third-seeded Wildcats (37-14), one of seven Southeastern Conference teams in the NCAA Tournament, used a one-out double from Kara Dill and a Meagan Aull single in the first to put two runners in scoring position for Brittany Cervantes. Cervantes was patient enough to draw a rare walk from Laura Winter (23-4) and Kentucky took advantage when Samantha DeMartine drove in two runs with a two-out single to left.Kentucky came out swinging its sticks and was all over Winter’s first-pitch strike offerings, totaling 11 hits in the contest. Winter gave up nine hits and five earned runs through the first two innings and change, leaving two runners on base before giving way to Brittany O’Donnell. Erin Marrone was the first Irish player to reach base, touching first on a second-inning walk. The Irish were in no position to walk Cervantes in the third after surrendering a Rachel Riley single to start the frame. Cervantes made them pay with a two-run homer to extend the Kentucky lead to 4-0. O’Donnell gave up an infield single in the fifth along with a two-out, two-run homer by Megan Yocke to make it an 8-0 game. Brianna Jorgensborg was hit by pitch for a 13th time this season and eventually moved to third on Alexa Maldonado’s infield single. Later in the third, Maldonado moved to second when Kentucky booted the ball on the play and both runners were left in scoring position when Bell induced a pair of popups. Kentucky was as aggressive on the paths as it was at the plate in the fourth, scoring for a sixth time when Dill legged to home from second on a double-play ball by Riley. SadiePitzenberger batted in the four spot for the first time in her career and came through with a double down the rightfield line to start the fourth for the Irish. Notre Dame failed to cash in on a potential run once again when pinch-runner Kelsey Thornton was called out for leaving the bag early on Marrone’s flyout to center.\n\n4. Louisville’s Ryan Wright went 3-for-3 with a solo home run, three RBI and three runs scored and closer Tony Zych worked out of a bases loaded jam in the top of the eighth inning to lead the Cardinals past Notre Dame, 7-5, Friday night in baseball action at Patterson Stadium in Louisville. The Irish drop to 21-27-1 overall and 12-13 in the BIG EAST, while the Cardinals improve to 29-26 and 14-12. Notre Dame enters the final day of the regular season in eighth place in the BIG EAST standings. The Irish still need a victory or USF loss on Saturday to cinch a spot in the tournament. Notre Dame had a golden chance to tie the game or even take the lead in the top of the eighth inning. After sophomore DH/RHP Adam Norton and senior PH Matt Grosso recorded RBI consecutive singles to bring the Irish within two runs, 7-5, Louisville went to Zych. The hard-throwing RHP promptly uncorked a wild pitch to move two runners in scoring position. Zych then missed on four straight offerings to walk sophomore C Joe Hudson to load the bases. Notre Dame called on pinch hitter David Casey to face Zych. Casey belted a game-tying grand slam off the Louisville closer in 2009, but Zych won the battle this time around. He opened the at-bat with back-to-back fast balls, the first topping out at 98-mph, before getting Casey to swing and miss at a slider. Zych then registered back-to-back strikeouts to open the ninth. Freshman LF Eric Jagielo hit a frozen rope right at Louisville shortstop Alex Chittenden to end the game. It was a pretty fitting end.Louisville starter Justin Amlung improved to 9-2 on the year. He allowed three earned runs on six hits in 7.0 innings of work. Amlung struck out four and walked two. Amlung did not necessarily fool the Irish, but most definitely benefitted from one Irish line drive after the next hit directly at a Louisville fielder. Jagielo had a pair of frozen ropes right at the Cardinals’ center fielder as did DeSico and freshman 1B Trey Mancini. Mancini also ripped a liner right at Cade Stallings down the third base line and Norton followed with abullet that Amlung somehow managed to get a glove on and recovered in time to throw him out by a step. Nonetheless, Amlung kept the Irish off the scoreboard over his final five innings of work. Senior RHP Cole Johnson took the loss and dropped to 4-7 on the year. He surrendered five earned runs on seven hits in 6.0 innings of work. Johnson fanned six and walked two.Wright, who homered in last night’s series-opening victory, belted a solo home run in the bottom of the first inning to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead. Notre Dame made three loud outs in its half of the first inning and kept it up in the top of the second. Fifth-year senior RF Herman Petzold ripped a leadoff single and senior 3B Greg Sherry hammered a one-out double off the left field wall to put runners on second and third. Hudson followed with two-run triple off the right field wall to give the Irish a 2-1 lead. Senior SS Mick Doyle then grounded out to shortstop, which allowed Hudson to score and pushed the Notre Dame lead to 3-1. After Johnson had a quiet second inning, Wright struck again in the home half of the third with an RBI single to plate Gardner, who doubled one batter earlier. Stallings followed with a two-run bomb deep over the left field wall to give Louisville a 4-3 advantage. The round tripper for Stallings was his second in as many days and fourth in the last five games. The Cardinals added to their lead with an RBI single from Adam Engel in the fifth inning. Johnson settled into a nice groove of his own. He retired the final seven batters he faced, including five on strikeouts. The Cardinals plated a pair of insurance runs in the bottom of the seventh inning off Norton. Louisville greeted Norton with three consecutive hits to open the inning. With runners on the corners and one out, Norton got a pop out and induced a possible inning-ending double play ball, but Sherry’s throw was wide of the second base bag, which allowed another run to score. Norton did get a double play ground ball on the next pitch to keep the Irish deficit at 7-3. Norton worked 2.0 innings and yielded two earned runs on threehits. Notre Dame and Louisville wrap up their BIG EAST series at 1:07 p.m. today at Jim Patterson Stadium. The game will be televised on the CBS Sports Network.\n\n5.

The Notre Dame women’s golf team is in a tie for 20th place (618/+42) after the second round of the NCAA Championship Thursday at the Traditions Club Golf Course in Bryan, Texas. Junior Becca Huffer (Denver, Colo./Littleton) carded a one-under par 71 during the round and is in a tie for 49th place with a 36-hole total of 151 (+7). Huffer and the Irish began play on the back nine of the golf course and after recording birdies on holes 15 and 18 the junior was at two-under par before she made the turn to the front nine. On hole one, which has proved to be one of the toughest holes on the course as the Irish have played the hole at eight-over par as a team, Huffer carded a double bogey to place her at even par, but with back-to-back birdies on holes five and six she returned to two-under par and ended the round at 71 (-1) due to a bogey on the seventh hole. Senior captain Katie Conway (Wading River, N.Y./Shoreham-Wading River) played a consistent first nine holes as she birdied on hole No. 12, but evened out her score with a bogey on the 14th hole to complete the initial nine holes at an even-par 36. Conway remained at par until carding a double bogey on the third hole, followed by consecutive bogeys on the fifth and sixth holes to place her at four-over par. She concluded the round at 78 (+6) due to a double bogey on the eighth hole. Freshman Nicole Zhang (Calgary, Alberta/Bishop Carroll) registered a 79 (+7) during her second round. She was off to a rough start on the day as she carded bogeys on the 10th and 11th holes to begin play, but with a birdie on No. 13 she was at one-over par, before bogeying the 17th hole to take her through the first nine holes at 38 (+2). She added five strokes to her score during the back nine holes with five bogeys. Senior So-Hyun Park (Seoul, South Korea/Bradenton Prep Academy) rounded out the Irish score at 82 (+10). The senior played 12 of the holes at par, but with double bogeys on three holes and one-over par onthree other holes the senior sits in 118th place after 36 holes. Freshman Kristina Nhim (Cypress, Calif./Cypress) completed the first half of the day with a nine-over par 45, but improved on the final nine holes as she carded a four-over par 40. Nhim placed a birdie on the board during the sixth hole for the second consecutive day of the tournament. The Irish began the third round of competition today as Park teed off the first hole at 8 a.m. local time The Irish are paired up with UC Davis and South Carolina for theday.\n\n2. The Notre Dame men’s golf team sits alone in seventh place after the first round of the NCAA Florida Regional Thursday at the Golden Ocala Golf Course in Ocala, Fla.. The Irish posted an even-par round (288) led by freshman Niall Platt (Santa Barbara, Calif.) carding a four-under par score (68) on his opening day. The host Florida Gators led the field after the first day of competition after posting a six-under par (282). Arkansas sits in second, one shot off the lead, at five under (283), while Baylor and North Carolina State are tied for third at four under (284). Oregon’s Jack Dukeminier leads individually after posting a 66(-6) for a one-shot lead over Southeastern Louisiana’s Philipp Westermann and Kennesaw State’s Ben Greene (67, -5). Platt’s round began with four consecutive pars before he reeled off three consecutive birdies on holes five through seven to move to three under. The freshman would go bogey-free on the day and card one additional birdie on the par-five 12th hole to finish with an opening round 68 (-4), good for fourth overall in the field. It is the seventh time on the season that Platt has broken par and the fourth time in which he has posted a sub-70 score. Platt’s first round 68 ties the lowest Irish individual round score in NCAA competition, matching the mark the Eric Deutsch set in ’05 and Cole Isban equaled in ’06. Paul McNamara III (Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.) sits second amongst the Irish rotation after the first day of play after posting an even-par 72 on his round. The sophomore played both the front and back nine at even par (36), carding one birdie and one bogey on each side. It is the sixth round this year that McNamara has posted an even- or under-par round and the first since his 71 (-1) at the Battle of the Warren. He is tied for 23rd after Thursday’s action. Max Scodro (Chicago, Ill.) battled more of an up-and-down day on the course, finishing with 11 pars to go along with three birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey to conclude at two over par (74) on the day. He finished tied for third amongst the Irish rotation and is tied for 43rd overall. Jeff Chen (Walnut, Calif.) matched Scodro with a 74 (+2), recording 12 pars, one birdie, three bogeys, one double bogey and an eagle on the par-five 12th hole. After making the turn at three over (39), Chen navigated the back nine at one under (35) to conclude his first day. Chris Walker (The Woodlands, Texas) finished fifth amongst the Irish rotation and did not count toward the team score after putting together an opening round 75 (+3). The junior sat at even par after 14 holes, but a pair of double bogeys on holes 15 and 16 dropped him to four over par before ending his round on a high note with a birdie on the 18th hole. He is tied for 53rd place after the first round of play. Notre Dame returned to the tee boxes starting at 8 a.m. (ET) today off the No. 10 tee alongside Southeastern Louisiana and Kennesaw State.\n\n3. Louisvillejunior RHP Derek Self allowed just one earned run over 7.0 innings and RyanWright went 3-for-5 with a solo home run to lead the Cardinals past Notre Dame, 14-2, in the opener of a BIG EAST baseball series Thursday night at Patterson Stadium in Louisville. Notre Dame drops to 21-26-1 overall and 12-12 in the conference, while Louisville improves to 28-26 and 13-12. The Irish fall into seventh place, just one half game ahead of Seton Hall. The Pirates rallied from a 2-0 deficit in the bottom of the ninth inning to tie the game, 2-2 and eventually won in the 11th thanks to consecutive two-out errors from Georgetown. Pittsburgh did edge USF, 6-5, to drop the Bulls 1.5 games behind the Irish. Notre Dame is still ahalf game out of fourth place. The magic number for the Irish to secure a berth into the BIG EAST tournament is now one. An Irish victory or USF loss guarantees Notre Dame a spot in the BIG EAST postseason. Self, who moved into the weekend rotation four weeks ago, improved to 3-2 on the season. He did surrender eight hits, but each was a single. Self struck out one and did not issue a walk.Irish senior RHP Brian Dupra was tagged with the loss and dropped to 3-6 on the campaign. He was knocked around for nine earned runs on 12 hits. Dupra, who entered the night sixth in the BIG EAST with a 2.37 ERA, struck out five and walked two. He had allowed just 15 earned runs over hisprevious eight league starts, but was off from the opening batter. Freshman LF Eric Jagielo went 3-for-4 and sophomore C Joe Hudson went 2-for-3 with a run scored. Notre Dame and Louisville continue their critical BIG EAST series at 7:07 p.m. today at Patterson Stadium. The game will be televised on the CBS Sports Network.\n\n4.

Notre Dame’s Blue-Gold spring football game for 2012 will be played on April 21.\n\n7. Here’s a transcript of Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick’s interview that appears in the final commencement issue of Notre Dame’s student newspaper, The Observer:\n\nOn what Notre Dame’s 2011-12 success means to him personally:\n\nOne of the big changes when you come into this job as opposed to your prior experiences is the way you consume sport and the way you interact with it. You live and die much less with the outcomes of the teams than you do the individuals because you now know them. You get to know them personally. My reaction tends to be at that level. I’m so happy for the student-athletes; I’m so pleased to see them achieve goals they set for themselves. In the case of the women’s soccer team – to beat on that door for four consecutive years and finally knock it down, to have the fencers come off three years of frustration and achieve their ultimate goal. You tend to react to your experience with the specific student-athletes. In that sense, it’s like a proud parent; you just feel great.\n\nOn the women’s soccer national championship and whether it has a special meaning to him as his first national championship:\n\nIt certainly did. In fact, they gave me a jersey with the number one on it to signify my first championship. What I loved about that experience was the nature of the run through the tournament. It was just extraordinary. I mean, nobody had ever won that tournament below a two-seed. They were a four, and they just blitzed the field. 16-1 outscored the opposition during the tournament. Both games in the finals could have been three-, four-goal differentials. I mean, we beat the heck out of the pipes all game long. We hit two really good goalies who gothot. They just dominated the field and that was so consistent with the personality of that team. They were as confident and as eager to face the best opponents as any team I’ve ever been around. They had a conviction about their ability that was really cool to see.\n\nOn whether the widespread success on the national level is expected to become the norm:\n\nWell, every year is its own story. You have things happen that you can’t control:injuries, other things that impact you. But, the one thing I have worked hard to do, and I think our coaches and athletes have really embraced it, is to articulate that the national championship is the goal annually. That’s whatwe’re trying to do, and to really focus on that as the objective for the sports. We had 16 of our teams get into the tournament, and you can’t win it if you don’t get into the tournament. That’s the start – really having aconsistently large base of teams and individual athletes who make it into the NCAA tournament. Women’s golf qualified for the nationals for the first time ever. That’s a huge accomplishment. That’s what we want them thinking, and I really feel like that is what’s taking root.\n\nOn whether the success of the programs speaks to the type of coaches at the helm:\n\nCertainly, we have extraordinary coaches. You don’t achieve those levels of success without great coaches, and we have those. Those coaches are also great fitshere. You have to have a feel for this place. You’ve got to understand the restrictions and the assets that you’re working with and embrace them, and all the coaches you mentioned (Waldrum, McGraw, Jackson) do. One of the great things we have going for us here is the tenure of many of our coaches. You go down that list of coaches that have had great years, and you can look it up. You get people who are extraordinary coaches, great fits, and they build great programs here.\n\nOn improving attendance for non-football sports:\n\nWe have to do a better job of it, and that’s my responsibility. That’s not [women’s soccer coach Randy Waldrum’s]. We have to market it more effectively and promote it better. Having said that, one of the challenges when you achieve success in a lot of sports is you’re marketing a lot of sports over a finite audience size. We’re one of the few colleges in America that has three prime winter sports that it all markets aggressively. We don’t concede that one of them might not have good attendance. The two basketballs and the hockey, we’re trying to fill the building every night. On some weekends, that’s 23,000 seats. Yeah, we have [85,000] on our football Saturday, but we’ve got a lot of seat inventory we’re moving the rest of the year in the other sports. So, the good news is we have lots of success. The challenge with that is we have a lot of great programs that deserve support that have a lot of contests that we have to market and get more people to come to. I share Randy’s view that we have to do a better job.\n\nOn whether the difficulty of the 2012 (football) schedule is going to be the norm going forward:\n\nYeah, who formed that schedule? Who did that? You know, that year is especially challenging, but it’ll be representative of the future, yes. If you’re going to be independent, if you’re going to give yourself the flexibility of building your own schedule, you have to embrace that. You have to try and build one that’s really good. I also think that if one assumes that the current BCS format remains in its current form or something like it, it’s really incumbent on Notre Dame to be able to make the case at the end of the year that it’s played the toughest schedule in the country, because there will be a strongpresumption in favor of the SEC champ, the Big Ten champ, the Pac-12 champ, or the Big 12 champ to be in that championship game. If we want to be there, we better be able to make the argument that no one in the country played a tougher schedule, and so that’s how we’re going to build them.\n\nOn the future of the off-site home game tradition and whether it will continue:\n\nYes. [Yankee Stadium] was a special weekend and I have every confidence that Washington will work well, that Chicago will work well, and Dallas. We won’t do it just to do it. If we don’t have reasons to go to a market that we think helps NotreDame — the off-site games are all about the University. They’re not about the football program. There’s not a significant benefit to the football program in doing it, but we think there’s a major benefit to the University in doing it. That’s why we play football.\n\nOn the Senior Day football victory over Utah:\n\nCertainly the scene on the field was cool. The senior students needed it as much as the senior student-athletes did. It was a very emotional time, because it had been a very challenging two weeks, three weeks leading up to it, and again it was more on the individual, personal level. I felt so good for the young men who had worked so hard. It would have been so easy for them to lose focus. So easy, and they just didn’t. At the college level, athlete leadership plays a unique role. In high school it’s sort of all coaching. When you get to the pros, there’s sort of a different element to it because you have a lot of extraordinary people with a lot of extraordinary talent. There are no successful college programs that don’t have great student-athlete leadership on the team. There are great coaches, but even the best coaches, if you don’t get great leadership from the student-athletes on the team, you won’t have a great program. We had exceptional leadership to get the team through that time, and the measure of their leadership was that game.\n\nOn getting a “feel” for Notre Dame:\n\nWell, I went here, so that helps. Having a feel for it is understanding its values and being comfortable with those and embrace them, so there’s that. But yeah, you learn a lot when you come into the job. There was strong appeal to coming back to a place that meant a lot to me and giving something back to it. Thebigger factor for me was Father Jenkins. When I met him in the course of considering this opportunity, I was struck by him as one of the most talented leaders I had met, and I’ve been around a lot of talented leaders in my life. So, one of the things you have to get comfortable with and learn is about the leadership of the University and as I said, he’s the best. He helps set thetone for all of this.\n\nOn how he splits his time:\n\nThe biggest thing that distinguishes this position from a lot of directors of athletics in college athletics is the amount of time I spend on University matters. I serve on what used to be the Executive Committee; we just changed the name to Presidential Committee — but with the other officers and deans and so on. I’m with them all the time on policy decisions. It’s just because athletics is so integrated into the University. It doesn’t stand alone as its own business. You wind up engaged in University matters all the time. That’s great, that’s the way it should be, but I wasn’t prepared for the amount oftime that takes. It’s significant. That takes a big chunk. There’s a huge chunk that comes with representing Notre Dame externally. We’re in a unique position in that regard. There’s all the Big East stuff. There’s all the BCS things, you know, sitting on the BCS executive committee, unique in that regard. There’s having your own broadcast partner, the time you spend on that relationship.There are the NCAA things I work on. So, you have this really broad range ofexternal responsibilities that take me away from campus and take a lot of your time. And then the remaining portion of your time, which is probably for meslightly less than half, is the business of running Notre Dame athletics. When I reorganized the business here, part of it was the recognition of that reality. We’re the only place in the country that has a single-sport administration for each sport. At most universities, and this one when I came, you have a person who’s got six or seven sports they’re the administrator for. But I wanted a much more year-round, concentrated representative of the administration with each of the sports.\n\nOn the release of future football schedules:\n\nWe got ourselves behind in the transition from one AD to another and we were catching up a little bit. I hope to have the schedule out through `17 before we start the fall season. There may be a piece or two missing, but we’re pretty close.\n\nOn releasing the schedules so early and having the contracts broken:\n\nWell, you write your contracts to deal with that. All those contracts have provisions for getting out of them, what the penalties are if someone gets out. It happens more than it should in our industry, but the good news is that we have verylittle of it. Typically it accompanies some change in the school, a change in coach or something where they have a different philosophy. Most of the schools we compete with fall into two categories. One is a traditional rivalry where there’s no incentive to not continue it. The other is schools that are really eager to bring their teams here and have us come there and we’re a real linchpin to their schedule, so they’re not inclined to do something different.\n\nOn whether conference realignment may come up again:\n\nNo. No, there may be small changes, but we’ve had a fundamental shift in the past few weeks in some regards. When you get conferences whose members are also equity partners in a media company, it changes the dynamic completely. And so the Pac-12 will now launch a network much as the Big 10 has done. And so you get those two cornerstones of the industry who are going to be very set. They may choose to admit somebody at some point, but that’s not an easy call when you’re giving somebody an equity stake in your network. So, they will be very stable. With two large conferences reflecting that level of stability, I don’t think there’s enough of a dynamic to cause major change. There will be some, but it won’t be like what we came close to last year.\n\nOn how much time he spent analyzing realignment during the conference realignment frenzy:\n\nI was consumed by it. I spent all my time it. The staff understood — it’s like the football search. When you make a change in football coach, you get withyour senior staff and you say, `I’m out of here for a while. I have to put all my energy on this.’ Conference expansion was a lot like that. We had to stay very engaged. We had to make sure we understood what was going on, we had to conduct an internal evaluation to reaffirm our priorities, and so we worked on that every day.\n\nOn Notre Dame launching a network much like Texas:\n\nYeah, we will – you know, we are very focused on building our digital media capacity. It’ll probably take a slightly different form because we work with a different set of assets than Texas. I think that Texas’ model is a great one; I thinkthey’ll be hugely successful. But it is based on the remarkable passion forthat school in a geographic area, so it fits over a cable footprint. I don’t have any market like that. I have interest everywhere, but not a concentration of it in one place. And so our opportunities will really come as broadband delivery increases and as you all are consuming media on a more content-by-content basis rather than a network basis. So as those two things evolve, that’s really going to play to Notre Dame’s favor, and what we want to do is position ourselves to take full advantage of it. So as broadband delivery on an a la carte basis, if you will, becomes the future of media, Notre Dame’s going to be really well-positioned.\n\nOn the Ohio State ethics issues and the ethics culture in college football:\n\nWell, it’s been a bad year for the ethics of college athletics. I know nothing about the Ohio State case. The one thing you learn in this job when you read about yourself is don’t believe what you read, and so I don’t presume to know anything about Ohio State’s circumstance. They’ll work their way through that, and I have a lot of faith in the NCAA process. But it’s been a bad year for the industry. I mean, just the discussion of these things: the Cam Newton situation, the Fiesta Bowl, Ohio State, we’ve just had far too much of that, and I think it’s really important to us as an industry, as the NCAA, to figure out how to be more effective in keeping negative events from happening in our sport, at least the ones we can control. Notre Dame is disadvantaged if theindustry is viewed in a negative light. We’re part of that industry. We hopepeople receive us in some ways as being a standard-bearer, and we certainly try to be. We don’t take any solace when somebody else goes through a tough time, because that’s not good for college football, that’s not good for college athletics. So, in that case, I hope it resolves itself well for Ohio State, but more broadly, I hope the NCAA and the industry can come up with better ways to ensure ethical conduct, because it really hurts us when we fall short of that.\n\nThursday, May 19, 2011\n\n1.
