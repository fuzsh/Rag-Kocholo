        "text": "As we’re thick in the play offs, it’s time to dip into history, and remember 2012 – the last time we featured in the end of season football party.\n\nThe season had started terribly. It was clear there was some talent in the side, however an awful start, some woeful performances and an ability to seemingly turn any lead into a defeat meant Dario Gradi was under pressure. In November 2011, things came to a head with Gradi’s 1353 match reign as Crewe manager coming to an end, and he was replaced by his assistant, Steve Davis. Form slowly turned round, and Crewe would go on an historic 16-game unbeaten spell to get to the League 2 play offs then squeeze past Southend in the two-legged semi finals, before beating Cheltenham Town in the final thanks to goals from Nick Powell and Byron Moore.\n\nToday, we ask “Where are they now?”\n\nSteve Phillips – The outspoken Somerset guardian played 90 minutes and kept a clean sheet, as he would do the following year too, in the Football League Trophy final. He had competition for the first team spot from Chelsea loanee Rhys Taylor, Scottish stopper Alan Martin and a young Ben Garratt, but he was a solid performer and fan favourite. Considering he was at the club for four seasons, he should have played far more than 110 times. He went on to play for Bath City before taking up a role with Yeovil Town as head of goalkeeping.\n\nLast seen – Running a goalkeeper academy in the Southwest, and clocking up the miles on his bike on Strava.\n\nDavid Artell – Captain fantastic and centre back for this, he brought some much-needed experience and physicality to the young Crewe side. As skipper, he lifted the trophy to cap a triumphant second half of the season but was surprisingly released days later. He would go to Northampton via Port Vale and win international honours for Gibraltar. Later, he would come back to Crewe as part-time coach, Academy Director, then Manager, and lead the club to another promotion with a swashbuckling style of play.\n\nHe finally took us as high as mid-table in League 1 in the season where we were barely allowed in the grounds, but player exits, squabbles and contract rows, combined with disastrous recruitment, led to a relegation that was so awful that not even big Dave could survive it. Yes, it ended horribly (things always do, otherwise they wouldn’t end) but now the dust has settled, his unique captain and manager promotions double means he goes down as a bone fide Crewe Alex legend.\n\nLast seen – Near the top of every League Two club’s “Next Manager” market. Surely at some stage, a club will take him, and we’ll see him prowling round the technical area at Gresty Road in 2023/24, where he will hopefully get the warm welcome he deserves.\n\nAdam Dugdale – Originally an academy player, he was released before making his way back into the league and eventually re-signing for Crewe. He scored the home goal in the 1-0 win against Southend in the first leg of the play off semi-final that helped get us to Wembley and would go onto to make nearly 200 appearances for the club. He also scored another important goal in a must-win home game against Preston that helped keep the club in League One, before being released in 2015 and going on to play for Tranmere and Morecambe.\n\nLast seen – A leading football agent for Unique Sports Management with a clientele including Reece James, Anthony Gordon, Marc Guehi, Michail Antonio… and Bassala Sambou.\n\nHarry Davis – Although predominantly a centre back, he played in an unfamiliar right back spot here. He also won the Football League trophy the following year.\n\nHarry was captain during the 2015/16 relegation season, although injury meant his appearances were restricted. Steve Davis’ son played the best part of 200 games for Crewe but was eventually released by his ex-team mate-turned-manager, Dave Artell, in weird echo of Artell’s own release by Harry’s dad four years earlier. Davis junior went on to bounce around the lower leagues, featuring for Grimsby, Morecambe and Scunthorpe.\n\nLast seen – Still only 31, Davis played the majority of the second half of the season for AFC Fylde as they won the National League North title.\n\nKelvin Mellor – Signed from Nantwich Town as a 17-year old, he was loaned to several local clubs and IBV in Iceland before breaking through to the first team properly towards the end of this season. He lined up at left back on the day, and almost scored in the final with a close range header.\n\nKelv has been immortalised by his involvement in the move that led to the greatest goal ever scored at Wembley, or indeed anywhere. However he was released in 2014 before having a solid career in Leagues 1 and 2, including scoring 10 goals in 73 appearances for Blackpool as they rose through the divisions. Mellor ame back to Gresty Road for the 2022/23 season and was a solid if largely unspectacular option.\n\nLast seen – Did not travel to Newport for the final game of the season, so the 3-2 win that ended Bradford City’s automatic promotion hopes was his final action in a Crewe shirt – a week later it was announced by the club that Mellor was released at the end of the season.\n\nByron Moore – One of the most under-appreciated players in the club’s history. His perceived lack of end product means the sheer weight of his achievements in a Crewe shirt is sometimes forgotten.\n\nThe Kidsgrove-born winger played just under 300 times for the club in seven years after coming through the academy, scoring 33 goals. He could be frustrating because he was technically proficient and had deadly pace, but Moore didn’t always seem to believe in himself. However, Byron was a massive part of this promotion side, getting the best haul of his career this year with 10 goals, including home and away against Port Vale in 1-1 draws. He would score the late goal that made it 2-0 here, and also got two Wembley assists the following year in the Football League Trophy win. His subsequent move to Port Vale on a “Bosman” was controversial, and he’d spend two seasons at Vale before Bristol Rovers, Bury and Plymouth before dropping out of the league to play for Torquay.\n\nLast seen – Part of the Telford United team that finished bottom of the National League North in 2022/23.\n\nAshley Westwood – Another Reaseheath graduate, this game was the culmination of three seasons of becoming an increasingly impressive puppet master in the Crewe midfield.\n\nWest would only play three times in the following season before an August move to Aston Villa, that netted the club around £1.5m. This was boosted when Westwood moved to Burnley due to a clause that gave Crewe 20% of any profit, thought to be another £600,000. All in all, Westwood played in the Premier League well over 300 times and probably misplaced a pass about 4 times.\n\nLast seen – Moving to American side Charlotte FC, which means Westy will be sharing a stadium with Carolina Panthers stars such as Bryce Young. An early injury set back didn’t help his start in Charlotte, but now he’s back on the pitch and the MLS outfit are picking up points… with their new Englishman as club captain.\n\nLuke Murphy – Westy’s partner in the engine room was another youth team player who thrived once moved there from a wider role. He would go onto become club captain once Artell, then Westwood left, and his crowning moment would come the following season when he smashed in the opening goal in the Football League trophy final back here at Wembley. A £1m move to Leeds United would follow before a move to Burton Albion. He would eventually come ‘home’ and play for another two seasons for Crewe in League One. The relegation season takes some lustre off his second spell at the club but he will always be remembered as one of the best players the club has ever produced, and for the massive part he played in this promotion and the cup win the following season.\n\nLast seen – Player of the Season for Macclesfield FC in their Northern Premier League West title win this season. Their promotion means they bypass Nantwich Town, who went the other way.\n\nMatt Tootle – A hardworking, supremely talented and versatile full back, who lined up at left midfield here, as he had done for the previous few matches. He was instrumental in Nick Powell’s goal, receiving the throw in from Mellor, and playing a one-two-three that would now be referred to as a “pre-assist”. ‘Toots’ played 224 times for the club before going on to have spells with Shrewsbury, Notts County and Boston United. He suffered from problems with gambling and mental health, and did some superb work in bringing these topics out into the open, giving help to many others who suffer the same issues. Still only 32, it’s a shame he isn’t still playing in the EFL.\n\nLast seen – At Grantham Town in the Northern Prem, East Div 1 last season. Still putting in stellar performances, playing 46 games, scoring 5 times and with another 15 assists to his name. He would make an excellent club ambassador, and to talk to academy kids about the mental side of the game and the potential problems of bottling problems up.\n\nA-Jay Leitch-Smith – Known as the best finisher at the club, A-Jay was a technically gifted forward, whose movement and link-up play were top drawer. His game was always limited by a lack of genuine pace. A-Jay played a big part in the run-in this year, scoring 9 goals in total in the season and being involved in many others, including the one-two for Byron Moore to score the second goal here. He came on as a sub late on in the Football League Trophy final the following season, which would be his last at the club. Following his release he played for Yeovil, Shrewsbury, Port Vale, Dundee United, Morecambe and Altrincham.\n\nLast seen – On loan from Warrington Rylands to Hyde United in the Northern Premier League Premier Division.\n\nNick Powell – One of the most hyped players to come through the academy but in fairness, he lived up to it at first. The goal he scored this day has been hailed as one of the best Wembley has ever seen, but it was just one of a series of breath-taking strikes from Powell this season. Long before he played for the first team there were rumours of Premier League clubs bidding for him. His post-match press conference is a classic but it was his performance on the pitch that meant a move was inevitable and he signed for Manchester United for £3m that summer. Injuries meant he never fulfilled his potential and his most productive spell would be for Wigan Athletic, first on loan and then on a permanent deal. He would later sign for Stoke, and whilst the undoubted talent has frequently been on display, injuries have always been there and it looks like the England appearances that should have come now never will.\n\nLast seen – Powell was released by the Potters at the end of this season, due to reoccurring injuries and lengthy spells on the treatment table. That said, he did feature in Stoke’s last eight games. Could a return to Gresty Road be around the corner?\n\nSubstitutes\n\nAlan Martin – Came in from Ayr United to challenge Steve Phillips for the number 1 shirt and although he did get some runs in the team he never really made the position his own.\n\nLast seen – Playing for St Joseph’s in the Gibraltan Premier Division.\n\nCarl Martin – Signed from Wealdstone in 2009, Martin was a pacy and popular defender but he was never really Dario Gradi’s cup of tea. After a sending off against Grimsby in 2010, Gradi said “Whatever ban he gets will be music to my ears” saying Martin was incapable of following instructions. Would be released following promotion, and end up at Macc Town before finishing off his playing career back at Wealdstone.\n\nLast seen – Coaching the first team at Southampton FC\n\nLee Bell – A lightweight but combative academy midfielder. By his own admission, Lee was never the best player in his group, but he was one of the hardest working. Having previously been released in 2007 following 5 seasons with the club, he would go on to Burton, Mansfield and Macclesfield Town. When Macc Town were relegated to the National League in 2010 Bell was released and he was re-signed by Dario Gradi, who was looking to add some experience. He would share captaincy with Dave Artell and Ashley Westwood over the next couple of seasons, culminating in this run to Wembley. Bell came on in the dying seconds of the game to get his Wembley appearance but would be released in the summer. Following this he went back to Burton for two more years before joining the coaching staff at Crewe and eventually making his way up to manager in 2022.\n\nLast seen – Clapping the travelling fans at Newport, before answering typically indecipherable questions in the post-match presser.\n\nMax Clayton – A highly-rated academy prospect who, like Powell, was rumoured to be the subject of Premier League bids before he’d barely strapped on his first team boots. Clayton was part of a successful England team that played in the u-17 World Cup in Mexico featuring Jordan Pickford, Nathaniel Chalobah, Raheem Sterling, John Lundstram, Nick Powell, Nathan Redmond, Jordan Cousins, Hallum Hope, Jake Forster-Caskey, Adam Cousins and George Evans. Clayton played primarily a Lampardesque late-arriving midfielder in the England side, which was a little different to the inside-forward role he played for his club, and scored in the final group game, a 2-0 win against Uruguay.\n\nThey’d beat Argentina on penalties before losing 3-2 to a Germany team captained by Emre Can. 2011-12 was Clayton’s breakthrough year at Crewe, playing 30 times and scoring 5 including the one for which he’ll always be remembered, cutting inside onto his left foot and putting it in at the neat post at Southend to secure the trip to Wembley. He also scored the second goal at Wembley the following season to make sure he will always be remembered in the club’s history. Joined Bolton Wanderers on a free at the end of an injury-hit 2013/14 but never really got going there, and after unfruitful spells at Blackpool and Altrincham would retire from football at 26.\n\nLast seen – Making the best pizza in Crewe at the Crewe Market Hall\n\nBilly Bodin – Tricky winger who came in late on to add some impetus in the run-in. Didn’t come off the bench here, and maybe that’s why he decided to move to Torquay instead of Crewe when Swindon released him that summer. Would go onto bounce around the lower leagues, playing his best football in a three-year spell for Bristol Rovers between 2015 and 2018 before featuring for Preston in the Championship and picking up a solitary cap for Wales.\n\nLast seen – In a number of attacking midfield positions for Oxford United in League One\n\nSteve Davis (Manager) – Took over from Dario Gradi with the club’s future in jeopardy and went on a long unbeaten run that culminated in promotion at Wembley. The following season he won the club’s only (real) trophy by following up in the Football League Trophy. He’d previously led Nantwich Town to FA Vase glory and promotion, and learnt at the feet of Dario himself as assistant manager for a few years. Davis should have been Crewe manager for a long time. So where did it all go wrong? Some would say Davis got a bit lucky in the first place. The building blocks were all there. Having Westwood, Murphy, Powell and co in League 2 is almost cheating, and if you were critical, you could even say Crewe were very lucky to win the Cup the following season. Getting past Coventry in the semi-final was virtually a miracle, and landing a team from division below in the final was a dream scenario. When the crown jewels were sold off, Davis struggled to replace them, and a series of loan signings that didn’t work, off-field shenanigans, relegation back to League 2, along with a turgid style of play and a breakdown in the relationship with the fans, eventually led to his sacking in 2017 to be replaced by David Artell. Would have a short, unsuccessful spell at Leyton Orient before taking the u-23s at Wolves, his hometown club.\n\nLast seen – On Match of the Day getting interviewed as the caretaker manager when Wolves sacked Bruno Lage before they appointed Julen Lopategui in November 2022."
