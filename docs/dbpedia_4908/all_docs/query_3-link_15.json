We need a slightly bigger squad with the 7 sub rule & the extra cup games, but i still think we need to remember that the key is leaving enough budget for quality loan signings something we will definitely do better in now we are back in the football league, where players are happy to join & clubs happy to loan to. 3 Permanent signings needed IMO, centre midfield (Lines), 2 x Right footed wingers one a marquee signing and the other a young lad with a decent pedigree.\n\nPost by Saint on\n\nWhy the Grimsby front men love in - hardly hurt us at all in 3 matches!\n\nVery keen to retain the main spine of Sunday's XI.\n\nNew keeper, cover at CH, 2 widemen, striker and possibly central midfielder.\n\nProbably release Mildenhall, Trotman & Balanta. Clark & Gosling depending on their wages might keep as cover. Sinclair keep if his injury is sorted. Send Blissett on loan to a good Conference side to continue his education.\n\nSign Lines now!\n\nFrom what I can remember, LJL was excellent in the home game v Grimsby and caused problems on Sunday, scoring a goal inside 3 minutes. I've also seen Grimsby at least 5 times this season and Arnold has been a real threat.\n\nPuddy\n\nLeadbitter\n\nParkes\n\nMacca\n\nBrown\n\nArnold\n\nLines\n\nMansell\n\nMonkhouse\n\nHarrison\n\nTaylor\n\nBench:\n\nRussell\n\nLockyer\n\nSinclair\n\nEaster\n\nLJL\n\n.. Would be very happy if this is how we lined up for the first game of the season."
