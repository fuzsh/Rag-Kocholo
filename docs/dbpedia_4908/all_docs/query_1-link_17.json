        "text": "Anthony Rush’s progression as a football player, since arriving at UAB, can’t solely be chronicled by a scale. But, that’s not a bad place to start.\n\nUAB signed the JUCO defensive lineman to fill up space in the middle of the defensive line. Turns out, the Raleigh, North Carolina native, who played two seasons at Northeast Mississippi Community College, he filled up too much space. Rush said he weighed 365 pounds when he arrived in January of this year.\n\nThat was too big. However, that doesn’t mean the 6-foot-5 Rush was unable to show flashes of his athleticism and his ability. It’s hard not to notice his athleticism. If you need an example, just call up the video highlight of his Pick-6 in the season opening win over Alabama A&M.\n\nLong before that, however, Rush, who is now 340 pounds, had to learn what it took to play at this level.\n\n“I think, he, like a lot of our guys, especially when you’re dealing with big guys, (learned) it’s a hard job,” said UAB head coach Bill Clark. “When you’re 6-5, 340 pounds or whatever Ant is, just the daily work that goes into getting in good shape (is difficult). It’s amazing just how his body has transformed.”\n\nThe transformation came in a lot of different forms.\n\n“He’s an intelligent guy,” Clark said. “He’s starting to understand what the work looks like. He didn’t have a clue. He had to learn that early on. To see him progress and get into the starting lineup, there are things in the game he could have done better, but he’s making a difference. I’m just so proud of where he’s heading academically, to go along with what he’s doing on the football field. I think that means this guy is starting to get it.”\n\nRush’s transformation wasn’t just on the football field. As Clark said, he’s also made strides academically. Last week, Rush, along with UAB volleyball player Haley Jared, was chosen by the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee as the UAB Student-Athletes of the Month for September.\n\n“That’s a big deal, they just don’t give those things away,” Clark said. “It’s all on what your effort looks like in the classroom.”\n\nIt was his effort in the classroom, Rush said, that played a significant role in him starting his college career in junior college. On the field, Rush was a 6-foot-4, 280-pound athlete who was athletic enough to play tight end and any spot along of the defensive front at Cary High.\n\n“We played a Wing-T, so I was blocking or running a corner route, drag route, something like that,” Rush said.\n\nThat led to some interesting confrontations and conversations with opposing defensive backs.\n\n“Usually, I would run them over,” Rush said. “Sometimes, the DBs would tell me they were glad I didn’t catch the ball, because they wouldn’t know what to do if I caught the ball.”\n\nHis days of catching the football – at least as an offensive player – ended when he found a junior college spot after failing to qualify to play at the four-year level. He became a full-time defensive lineman at Northeast Mississippi, contributing 73 tackles and four sacks over a two-year span. Recruiting interest was much different than when he left high school. Rush’s offers included UAB, East Carolina, California, Marshall, Middle Tennessee, Mississippi State, New Mexico, Ohio, Southern Miss and Western Kentucky.\n\nOriginally, Rush chose his home state option, committing to East Carolina. By the December signing day, however, he had switched to UAB.\n\nHe learned quickly that things are different at the FBS level.\n\n“You’ve got to have a good work ethic to be here at UAB,” Rush said. “I tell a lot of the recruits that if you don’t want to work, you don’t need to come here. If you want to work, this is the place for you.”\n\nRush began the season behind senior Teko Powell, who came to UAB from the University of Illinois, on the nose tackle depth chart. It didn’t take Rush long to grab attention for what may have been the most memorable play of the 38-7 victory over Alabama A&M.\n\nRush got him what some call a “Fat Guy Touchdown” in the third quarter of the season-opening win. On the play, he faked a pass rush and then popped outside, directly in the way of a screen pass directed toward an Alabama A&M running back. Rush batted the ball in the air, caught the deflection and rumbled 27 yards for a touchdown. ESPN ran replays of the athletic interception return that evening.\n\n“My friends, they were going pretty crazy about it,” Rush said. “In JUCO, I had dropped two picks that were supposed to go to the house. In high school, I had a Pick-6 on the same side of the field, kind of like the same play. It was pretty exciting. A lot of people hit me up after that, but you’ve just got to stay humble. You know, next play, next game.”\n\nRush settled in to become one of the top contributors on a defensive line filled with contributors. His six-game totals include 17 tackles, including six tackles for loss, which is third best on the team, and two quarterback. Two games ago, the defensive coaching staff switched Powell to defensive tackle so the two could line up next to each other on the starting unit. That also leaves a solid backup tandem of Garrett Marino and Quindarius Thagard.\n\nRush is staying in the moment, working to get better every day, but eventually he hopes to chase an NFL dream. Doing that, he says, will probably mean shaving a little more weight off. He’s already lost 25 pounds, while getting stronger and faster, since arriving on campus and hopes to be in the neighborhood of 325 as a senior.\n\nRight now, though, his focus is playing in front of friends and family in North Carolina for the first time as a college player and helping the Blazers (4-2 overall, 2-1 C-USA) take another positive step. Rush and his UAB teammates will begin a two-game road swing with a Conference USA matchup against winless Charlotte on Saturday at 5:30 p.m. at Jerry Richardson Stadium. Rush estimates that 20 of his family and friends will make the drive from the Raleigh area.\n\n“It’s pretty cool,” Rush said. “They don’t get to come to a lot of my games because I’m eight hours away. Charlotte is only an hour and a half if you drive on I-40.”\n\nMaybe he give them some plays to remember on the ride back home."
