        "text": "COACH Paul Trollope gave his Bristol Rovers side a rollicking after a less than lacklustre second half display against Northampton Town on Wednesday.\n\n\"I will accept a lot of things but not a real lack of hunger and desire,\" he declared after Rovers had surrendered a hard-won first half lead.\n\n\"We did everything possible to put ourselves under pressure with a number of offsides and fouls. The play in the second half was not acceptable.\n\n\"But we are happy to escape with a point and carry on. We are coming into a tough period of games which will define everything.\"\n\nLast season Rovers hauled themselves up from 17th at this stage to make the play-offs and gain promotion. Whether they can do it again remains to be seen but that is still Trollope's aim, though he knows they will have to perform significantly better.\n\nThe game was the first of five in 15 days for Rovers and Trollope rang the changes in his team, with five switches from the side that crashed out of the FA Cup to West Bromwich Albion four days earlier.\n\nHe rarely reveals his plans for the next game but this time he admitted: \"There will be changes for the game at Cheltenham on Saturday.\"\n\nByron Anthony, Chris Carruthers, Lewis Haldane, Sean Rigg and Richard Walker all made the starting XI and 19-year-old Rigg with a neat control and finish from Chris Lines's low, right-wing cross scored his first goal in ten months on 45 minutes, squeezing the ball just inside the right-hand upright.\n\nOn the balance of play it was a lead Rovers just about deserved, though Northampton were decidedly unlucky when Ian Henderson's 12-yard smash came down and back off the underside of the bar midway through the half.\n\nTrollope called his side's second half display one of the poorest for a long time and said: \"Some of the stuff that was going on was criminal.\"\n\nSix offside decisions, mostly with Rigg the culprit, and a raft of fouls presented Northampton with easy possession and Rovers were forced to defend well, with Anthony, back after a long injury lay-off, the pick of the side, along with co-central defender Danny Coles.\n\nTown's equaliser came on 55 minutes when Carruthers failed to deal adequately with Danny Jackman's corner and Poul Hubertz, who played a lone striking role, steered the ball home at the right-hand post.\n\nDavid Pipe and Haldane received knocks and could be doubtful for the Gloucestershire derby game at Whaddon Road, which will be Rovers' home from home next season while the Memorial Stadium is redeveloped.\n\nRovers: Phillips; Lescott, Anthony, Coles, Carruthers; Pipe (Lines 42 min), Campbell, Disley, Haldane (Jacobson 71 min); Rigg, Walker (Lambert 71 min). Subs not used: Hinton, Williams. Bookings: Carruthers, Disley. Attendance: 4,657"
