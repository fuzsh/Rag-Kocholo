        "text": "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — William Byron gave team owner Rick Hendrick something extra to celebrate in the 40th anniversary year of Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nIn a frantic scramble after a restart on Lap 197 of 200 in the DAYTONA 500, Byron reached the finish line and took the white flag moments before NASCAR called the fifth caution of the evening as Ross Chastain slid wildly through the infield grass off the bumper of Austin Cindric’s Ford.\n\nAlex Bowman was a close second to his teammate at the moment of caution, giving Hendrick a 1-2 finish and the organization’s first victory in the Great American Race since Jimmie Johnson beat teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. to the stripe in 2013.\n\nThe victory was Hendrick’s ninth in the DAYTONA 500, tying the company with Petty Enterprises for most in the history of the NASCAR Cup Series most prestigious event. The race was postponed from Sunday to Monday because of heavy rains during the weekend.\n\n“I’m just a kid from racing on computers and winning the Daytona 500,” said the 26-year-old Byron, who picked up the 11th victory of his career and his second at Daytona, the first coming in the 2020 summer race at the 2.5-mile superspeedway.\n\n“I can’t believe it. I wish my dad was here. He’s sick, but this is for him, man. We’ve been through so much, and we sat up in the grandstands together and watched the race (when Byron was younger). This is so freaking cool.”\n\nHendrick could barely contain his elation in Victory Lane.\n\n“I’m telling you, you couldn’t write the script any better,” he said. “When we thought about coming down here the first time, we didn’t think we should be here, felt so out of place.\n\n“We win this on our 40th to the day, it’s just… and tied a record now, so that’s awesome.”\n\nBefore the final restart, Chastain was racing at the front of the field on Lap 192 when a bump from Alex Bowman got Hendrick Motorsports teammate William Byron out of shape and knocked Byron into the right rear of Brad Keselowski’s Ford.\n\nKeselowski turned up the track into the Ford of Joey Logano, who had led a race-high 45 laps to that point. Reigning series champion Ryan Blaney’s Ford was among the 23 cars involved in the accident that left string of mangled vehicles strewn along the backstretch.\n\nThe wreck knocked Blaney, Keselowski and Logano out of the race, along with Tyler Reddick, defending race winner Ricky Stenhouse Jr., Daniel Suarez and Todd Gilliland. NASCAR red-flagged the race for 15 minutes 27 seconds for track clean-up.\n\n“Speedway racing again,” Logano said ruefully. “It’s a lot of fun until this happens. It was pretty interesting with a lot of pushing and shoving there at the end. Our car was able to take it. Our Mustang was so fast. It could lead a line really well. I kind of thought I had the cars I wanted around me. I had at least one I wanted around me, but just couldn’t make it work.”\n\n“Obviously, hate what happened on that backstretch,” Byron said of the accident. “I just got pushed and got sideways. But so proud of this team, whole AXALTA team, 40th anniversary to the day, on Monday.\n\n“Just extremely blessed and thankful for all the opportunities, and we just want to keep it going. We have a lot to prove this year, and this is a good start, obviously.”\n\nHow much Byron has yet to prove is debatable. He won a series-best six races last year, qualified for the Championship 4 and finished third in the final standings.\n\nThe race was not quite five laps old when an eight-car accident off Turn 4 started the inevitable attrition. Contact from Keselowski’s Ford in a tightly bunched line of the outside knocked the Toyota of John Hunter Nemechek into the center lane and into the side of Harrison Burton’s Ford.\n\nBurton slid toward the infield, collecting the Chevrolet of Sunoco rookie Carson Hocevar. Burton’s No. 21 Mustang shot up the track and slammed into the Ford of Kaz Grala and the Chevrolet of Austin Dillon. Behind Dillon, Hocevar careened into the path of seven-time series champion Jimmie Johnson, who couldn’t avoid the collision.\n\nThe wreck eliminated the cars of Burton, Hocevar and Grala. Dillon took his No. 3 Chevy to the garage for extensive repairs, and Johnson lost two laps on pit road as his Legacy Motor Club crew worked frantically to repair his Camry.\n\n“I don’t remember exactly who it was on my outside,” Burton said after a trip to the infield care center. “It just looked like they either got a bad push or got loose and just hit me in the right side and sent me across.\n\n“The grass was so wet that once I got in the grass, I thought I’d be OK, but the car just kept going and going… so really sad that our day is over as quick as it was. We had a really fast Ford. It’s just a bummer. There’s nothing we can do but just move on and try to win next week.”\n\nIt took 187 more laps of racing before the colossal wreck that dwarfed the earlier incident thinned the field and set up the fight to the finish among the cars that survived.\n\nIn a race that featured 41 lead changes among 20 drivers, Christopher Bell ran third, followed by Corey LaJoie, Bubba Wallace and AJ Allmendinger. Chastain, who didn’t have quite enough room when he dived to the inside of Cindric on the penultimate lap, finished 21st, one spot ahead of Cindric.\n\nNASCAR Cup Series Race – DAYTONA 500\n\nDaytona International Speedway\n\nDaytona Beach, Florida\n\nSunday, February 18, 2024\n\n1.

Fans can continue to lead their teams as a quarterback, and new for this year can now play linebacker where they can rush the quarterback, record sacks, make tackles and nab interceptions. The 2023 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year with the Houston Texans, quarterback C.J. Stroud will be the featured cover athlete of NFL PRO ERA, along with two-time First-Team All-Pro and Dallas Cowboys star, linebacker Micah Parsons.\n\n“It’s an honor to be one of the featured athletes of an incredible game that mirrors playing quarterback in real life,” said Stroud. “I love what the team is doing at StatusPRO, and once we started conversing, I knew I wanted to be involved with NFL PRO ERA and the vision they have to be the best VR game.”\n\n“I am a huge gamer, especially VR games and football, so being a cover athlete and playing a key role in NFL PRO ERA is an awesome experience,” said Parsons. “Once I talked with the StatusPRO team and they wanted to add defense to the new version of the game, I knew I wanted to work with them and was thrilled when they wanted me as a feature athlete.”\n\nNFL PRO ERA is an immersive, first-person simulation that brings fans closer to the gridiron by giving them a professional football player’s perspective through VR technology. NFL PRO ERA is one of the most successful sports franchises in VR history. StatusPRO has improved the original gameplay of NFL PRO ERA with smarter AI teammates and opponents, a whole new way to play with defense and the opportunity for users to personalize and immerse themselves through new customizations such as custom gear, stadiums and hairstyles.\n\nThere will also be improved play styles of teams and players that are closely aligned with current-day formations. NFL PRO ERA will be a faster, more user-friendly game. By removing the sideline experience and adding a new user interface and wristband controls, users can experience smoother gameplay and more intuitive controls. Additional features of the game include real-time feedback from your teammates as they react and respond to you and your quarterback leadership on and off the field along with more intensity and audio based on different game scenarios.\n\n“We want to provide our loyal fans and gamers with something new and revolutionary in our next version of NFL PRO ERA. By adding defense to the game, we aim to bring something unique to the VR gaming world,” said Victor Lugo, StatusPRO’s new chief product officer. “It was important for users to feel like real leaders of their team on both sides of the ball. Being one of the first VR games to have a realistic defensive experience, we made sure that fans have the true feeling of being the defensive anchor when they are on the field.”\n\nUsers who have either of the first two versions of the game will see an update giving them access to customizations, and full access to all free play modes and mini-games. The 2025 edition will be available for current players at $19.99 and new players at $39.99. It will include the new defense single-player mode, updated rosters, team t-shirts, cosmetics and more. An updated multiplayer experience that will\n\nfeature offensive vs. defensive head-to-head matchups will be released this winter. Additional content packs will be available throughout the season, starting at $4.99.\n\nNFL PRO ERA will be available on Meta Quest during the 2024 NFL season."
