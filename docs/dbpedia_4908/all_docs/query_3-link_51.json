        "text": "The Robins trailed 1-0 at the break after Will Hoskins was given the freedom of the Town back four to stroll through and chip over Phil Smith.\n\nAfter the interval the hosts doubled their advantage when, on 48 minutes, a defensive mix-up gave Jo Kuffour the simple task of rounding Smith to tuck home.\n\nSwindon hopes were raised when Jon-Paul McGovern smashed a volley past Luke Daniels in the home goal on 66 minutes, but the Pirates replied quickly with Jeff Hughes jumping highest and hardest to nod Ben Swallow's cross into the corner of the net.\n\nHere are the key moments from today's match:\n\nFive mins: Chris Lines makes Phil Smith work early from a free-kick 20 yards out after Paul Caddis trips Ben Swallow.\n\nSeven mins: (GOAL 1-0, Hoskins) Another game, another failure to keep a clean sheet as Chris Lines' pass dissects the Town defence and Will Hoskins run clear of Caddis to chip over Smith. The 'parted like the Red Sea' cliché comes to mind.\n\n14 mins: Hoskins is dominating the Swindon back four, and his fizzing cross almost ends up in the back of the net after striking Lecsinel Jean-Francois, but Smith gets down quickly to make the save.\n\n18 mins: Campbell's trickling daisy-cutter from 20 yards is comfortable for Smith. It's an incredibly open game here today. I expect there to be plenty more goals in this one.\n\n23 mins: First effort on target for Town as Charlie Austin nods Alan Sheehan's cross tamely into the arms of Luke Daniels.\n\n28 mins: No pressure whatsoever applied on Sheehan as he has time and space to pick out David Prutton at the back post with a loopy centre, but Prutton can't direct his header well enough ad it drifts past the post.\n\nSo much freedom to roam for both sides going forward here. Makes for exciting viewing, but I'm sure both managers would prefer to see their teams tighten up.\n\n35 mins: Lines has a lot of confidence from the set piece and, from fully 25 yards, he tries to curl the ball past Smith, who is having none of it and gathers easily.\n\n47 mins: Byron Anthony gets on the end of Gary Sawyer's long free-kick, but his hooked volley flies narrowly over the crossbar.\n\n48 mins: (GOAL 2-0, Kuffour) Utter shambles. Sheehan looks to make a routine pass out of defence, but Jean-Francois is in the way and the ball ricochets off the centre-back and straight into the path of Jo Kuffour.\n\nThe former Swindon striker has no problem rounding Smith and slotting home. One of the more bizarre goals you're likely to see this season.\n\n49 mins: Town are close to an instant reply as Austin rises to meet Jon-Paul McGovern's cross, but Daniels does well to paw his header round the post.\n\n54 mins: Sheehan's speculative free-kick from 30 yards bounces harmlessly into the waiting grasp of Daniels. Ambitious.\n\n62 mins: Austin manages to fire a harmless pot-shot at goal after a melee on the edge of the area, but it's all getting a little desperate for the visitors.\n\n66 mins: (GOAL 2-1, McGovern) A chink of light. It appears a fairly aimless cross from Sheehan when he lofts a high ball into the Rovers box, but David McCracken completely misses his attempted headed clearance and McGovern brings the ball down expertly before firing low past Daniels on the volley. Is there now hope?\n\n69 mins: Prutton smashes a loose ball wildly over the bar from 20yards, but Swindon are digging in hard in pursuit of an equaliser.\n\n69 mins: Austin flicks Matt Ritchie's delicate cross straight at Daniels. The atmosphere is building to a fiery crescendo at the Memorial Stadium.\n\n70 mins: The away side are all over their hosts at the moment. Barely recognisable from the team that played the first 60 minutes.\n\n74 mins: (GOAL 3-1, Hughes) So much for that then. No point in putting together 10 minutes of superb football going forward if you concede the moment you're put under pressure at the other end.\n\nThere's two Rovers shirts in the box to five Robins when Swallow dinks a gentle cross in from the left, but Jeff Hughes is able to barge his way through two challenges and rise highest to nod past Smith. Feeble is the first word that comes to mind.\n\n78 mins: Austin leaps to head Sheehan's inswinging free-kick straight at Daniels.\n\nBRISTOL ROVERS (4-4-2): Luke Daniels; Carl Regan, David McCracken, Byron Anthony, Gary Sawyer; Ben Swallow, Stuart Campbell, Chris Lines, Jeff Hughes; Jo Kuffour, Will Hoskins\n\nSubs not used: Mike Green, Jams Tunnicliffe, Wayne Brown, Dominic Blizzard, Eliot Richards, Cian Bolger, Charlie Reece\n\nSWINDON TOWN (4-5-1): Phil Smith; Paul Caddis, Scott Cuthbert, Lecsinel Jean-Francois, Alan Sheehan; Jon-Paul McGovern, David Prutton, Jonathan Douglas, Simon Ferry (Thomas Dossevi, 57), Matt Ritchie Charlie Austin.\n\nSubs not used: Mark Scott, Will Evans, Kevin Amankwaah, Michael Timlin, Alan O'Brien, Vincent Pericard\n\nFor all things Swindon Town, follow @stfcadver on Twitter"
