        "text": "Post by bluetornados on\n\nBristol Rovers set to add former Bristol City hero to Matt Taylor's coaching staff..By Daniel Hargraves\n\nJamie McAllister made over 200 appearances for Bristol City as a player and was assistant manager to Lee Johnson and Dean Holden at Ashton Gate\n\ni2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9003152.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/1_GettyImages-1227688141.jpg\n\nJamie McAllister (right) during his time as Bristol City assistant manager\n\nBristol Rovers are set to hire former Bristol City stalwart Jamie McAllister as a coach as Matt Taylor's backroom staff starts to take shape.\n\nAs first reported by the Daily Record, McAllister is expected to return to Bristol having rejected the chance to be assistant manager at Rovers' League One rivals Fleetwood Town earlier this year and was also interviewed for the managerial role at Inverness Caledonian Thistle.\n\nThe Scotsman was most recently at Scottish Premiership outfit Hibernian where he had been assistant manager. However, the former City player and assistant manager will now be headed for the blue side of Bristol.\n\nThe Scotsman made over 200 appearances for City between 2006 and 2012 and also had playing spells at Exeter City and Yeovil Town. It was at Exeter where the now-45-year-old retired from playing in 2016, the same year that Gas boss and Exeter legend Matt Taylor retired having played for Bath City at the time.\n\nAfter retirement, McAllister returned to City to become the Robins' U21s manager before being promoted to be Lee Johnson's assistant as well as Dean Holden's for a brief period before departing in 2020.\n\nThe coach then linked up with Johnson again at Sunderland and then at Hibernian before the former Robins manager's sacking in August.\n\nTaylor is still yet to appoint any of his own staff having been in the job for almost a month. Former assistant and caretaker manager Andy Mangan and first-team coaches Danny Ventre and Glenn Whelan left Rovers before the 41-year-old's arrival. First-team coach Kevin Bond, goalkeeping coach Anssi Jaakkola and Head of Sports Science Tom Short have remained in their roles while Academy Manager Byron Anthony and Lead Professional Development Phase Coach Steve Tully have been assisting Taylor on what is understood to be a temporary basis.\n\nThe fact that the Gas boss hasn't been able to bring in any of his own staff yet was referenced by captain Sam Finley in his post-match interview after Saturday's defeat at Blackpool who said: \"It's hard because he's on his own. At the moment he hasn't got his coaching staff and I feel sorry for him. That needs to be sorted by the club as quick as possible.\"\n\nThere has also been discussion as to whether Taylor's former assistant at Rotherham United and Exeter City and former Gas player Wayne Carlisle could make a return to Rovers as a coach after leaving the Millers last week where he had been caretaker manager before Leam Richardson's appointment. Carlisle was in attendance at the Mem for Rovers' 2-1 win over Portsmouth on Boxing Day but the reason as to why is unclear.\n\nWhat McAllister's appointment means for coaching staff currently in place and future appointments is also unclear but it marks the start of a long awaited process.\n\nPost by bluetornados on\n\nFormer Bristol City coach Jamie McAllister leaves Bristol Rovers after less than six months..By Daniel Hargraves.\n\ni2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article9340519.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_3568735.jpg\n\nJamie McAllister has left Bristol Rovers, Bristol Live understands, less than six months after becoming Matt Taylor's first appointment as Gas manager.\n\nHaving had spells in the south west as a player at Bristol City, Yeovil Town and Exeter City becoming being Lee Johnson's assistant at City, the Scotsman returned to Bristol in late December to become Taylor's assistant at Rovers with the pair knowing each other from undertaking their Pro Licences together.\n\nThe Rovers boss' arrival coincided with the departures of former interim manager Andy Mangan and coaches Glenn Whelan and Danny Ventre, while Kevin Bond, who had returned to the club on a part-time basis in November to assist Mangan, and goalkeeping coach Anssi Jaakkola stayed on.\n\nMcAllister was first seen as part of the coaching staff before the 2-1 home win against Charlton Athletic on December 29th with Taylor confirming his arrival in his post-match press conference that evening before the club officially announced his appointment as assistant manager when revealing the backroom team in early February.\n\nThe Scotsman would lead pre-game warm-ups and gave players instructions given by the Rovers manager from the dugout when Taylor served a two-game touchline ban in February, for the matches away at Northampton Town and at home to Carlisle United, but the manager still completed media duties before and after both games.\n\nThe Rovers boss then added his assistant at Rotherham United and Exeter Wayne Carlisle in February with the former Gas player returning to BS7 on a part-time basis as an independent player development coach.\n\nBoth Bond and Jaakkola confirmed their respective departures last month via Bristol Live and social media respectively while the club started advertising for a new first team coach earlier this week.\n\nBond had been part of toxic turd Barton's coaching staff in the League Two promotion season but left in 2022 before returning just over a year later whereas Jaakkola had been a player at Rovers between 2019 and 2023 before retiring at the end of the 2022/23 campaign and becoming the Gas' goalkeeping coach, making it five years in total at the club.\n\nThis summer is set to be one of change with 13 players departing at the end of last season while three coaches have also left the club with pre-season expected to begin on July 1.\n\nBristol Live understands that Rovers will confirm the numerous staffing changes at the club in due course having not officially announced the departures of Jaakkola, Bond and McAllister nor Head of Data and Analysis Adam Mahoney who left at the end of last season and has become Huddersfield Town's new Assistant Head of Recruitment."
