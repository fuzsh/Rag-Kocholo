        "text": "With fall camp getting underway around the country, 247Sports highlights some of college football's best young players entering the 2024 season with its revamped 20Under20. The only requirement is that the player must not yet have turned 20 years old. Otherwise, this would just be a \"best players in college football\" list.\n\nIn this article, you'll find names you know, including plenty who dotted our True Freshman All-American Team. We've got a trio of young-for-their-age rising juniors. Five incoming freshmen from the class of 2024 made the cut. We even have one player that is still in high school.\n\nGet the latest football and recruiting scoop on your favorite college team today.\n\nLet's get to the list. Players are listed in alphabetical order. (Note: All ages as of Aug. 1, 2024.)\n\n247Sports' Clint Brewster, Gabe Brooks, Chris Hummer, Andrew Ivins and Cooper Petagna contributed to this report.\n\nRUEBEN BAIN, MIAMI EDGE\n\nAge: 19\n\nRecruiting rewind: Four-star | 96 rating | No. 71 overall, No. 10 EDGE in 2023\n\nPlayer background: Rueben Bain was an instant-impact player for the Miami defense as a true freshman, locking down a starting role in Week 3 and claiming ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year and True Freshman All-American honors with 44 tackles (12.5 for loss) and 7.5 sacks over 13 games. According to PFF, his 45 quarterback pressures led all true freshmen nationally. Lauded by teammates for his work ethic, look for Bain to take another step forward in 2024.\n\nScout's take: \"Bain is one of those players that we're kicking ourselves for not having ranked higher. And don't worry, Miami fans, we have already heard how we got him wrong. One of the biggest sticking points behind the scenes during the rankings process was Bain's size.\n\n\"We went back and forth about whether we should grade him out as an edge rusher or defensive lineman. In hindsight, the debate was a bit silly because Bain constantly got to the quarterback."
