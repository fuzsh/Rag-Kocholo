        "text": "The Newport-born centre-back partied long into the night with his teammates on Sunday after the 2-0 victory over Wrexham sealed promotion at Wembley.\n\nAnd, having spent six years in the Football League with Bristol Rovers, the 28-year-old believes that County can continue to climb up the English football pyramid.\n\n“It’s a massive result. You saw how much it meant to the players and the fans,” he said. “To get this club back in the Football League is a great achievement and we are hugely proud of what we’ve done.\n\n“It’s a dream to go up like this after what the club has been through. The fans have been fantastic all season and this is their reward.\n\n“It will be nice for me going back to Bristol Rovers but my club is Newport County now and I’m really proud of that as a Newport boy,” he added.\n\n“This club is going places and I want to go as far as I can in the Football League with Newport County.\n\n“We’ve got a fantastic group and we’ll all stick together now and go on to the next challenge. We want to go up and up and up.”\n\nAnthony’s defensive partner Ismail Yakubu savoured Sunday’s victory following last year’s FA Trophy final defeat to York City at Wembley and paid tribute to Exiles boss Justin Edinburgh.\n\n“Last year it was great to come to Wembley but you want to win here and words just can’t describe what I felt when that second goal went in and I knew we were going up,” said Yakubu. “It was euphoria, just unbelievable.\n\n“The gaffer always believed in me,” he added.\n\n“He gave me a call when he came in and I was on loan at Cambridge and told me he wanted me back at the club.\n\n“Since then I’ve always felt like I had his backing and he does that for everyone at the club. He’s got an amazing aura around him.”\n\nTeenage loan star Alex Gilbey is heading back to Colchester United with a promotion winner’s medal and a lifetime of memories from his short time with County.\n\n“It’s been a great experience for me and it’s a dream come true for it to end like this,” said the 18-year-old midfielder.\n\n“I worked hard to get my place in the team and I’ve kept it for the big games, which is great for someone of my age.\n\n“To play at Wembley and get promoted is fantastic. When the goals went in I just erupted inside.\n\n“I’ve grown up and become a man at Newport and I’ll always remember my time here and look out for their results.\n\n“I’ll be going back to Colchester and I want to fight for my place there but Newport is in my heart now. I’ve only been here a few months but they’ve been the best of my career so far.”"
