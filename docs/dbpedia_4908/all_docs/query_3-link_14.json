        "text": "Swansea City moved nine points clear at the top of League One with victory over Bristol Rovers on March 18, 2008.\n\nGoals from Dennis Lawrence and Jason Scotland did the trick for Roberto Martinez’s side, who got their promotion challenge back on track at the Memorial Stadium.\n\nDespite their favourable position, the Swans made the short journey along the M4 off the back of three games without a win.\n\nMeanwhile, Rovers were desperate to end a run of three defeats in four, but the hosts held their own against the league leaders.\n\nHowever, the deadlock was finally broken in the 72nd minute, as Lawrence met Tom Butler’s free-kick to score his first goal since October.\n\nThe lead was doubled just six minutes later when Scotland converted goal number 25 of the season from the penalty spot after Febian Brandy was fouled by Byron Anthony.\n\nThe Swans were forced to finish the game with 10 men after Brandy was shown a straight red card for a foul on Danny Coles, but the visitors had done enough to get back to winning ways in League One."
