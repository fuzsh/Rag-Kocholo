        "text": "Robert Snodgrass scored in stoppage-time to grab a point for Leeds against Coca-Cola League One leaders Leicester in Simon Grayson’s first match in charge of the Yorkshire side.\n\nThe draw meant Leicester were unable to fully restore their four-point lead at the top of the league, which had been trimmed to one point when MK Dons beat Bristol Rovers earlier in the day.\n\nMatt Oakley put Leicester ahead after 24 minutes at Elland Road when he cracked a 25-yard shot past Casper Ankergren.\n\nGrayson, who replaced Gary McAllister as Leeds manager earlier this week, threw on Snodgrass for the final 15 minutes as he tried to turn the flow of the match after a lacklustre Leeds showing.\n\nThe move proved to be a prudent one as Luciano Becchio found the striker just inside the box and Snodgrass smashed the ball past David Martin to snatch a point for Leeds.\n\nMK Dons had strengthened their position in second place after a 2-1 win over Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium.\n\nAaron Wilbraham headed home Peter Leven’s cross to put the Dons ahead before Jo Kuffour gave Rovers an instant reply with a 20-yard strike.\n\nThe hosts had looked comfortable until Byron Anthony headed into his own net to give the Dons the win just before the hour.\n\nScunthorpe did their promotion prospects no harm as they hammered Hartlepool 3-0 at Glanford Park.\n\nGrant McCann opened the scoring before Gary Hooper doubled the Irons’ lead just after the break.\n\nAny doubts over the result were put to bed in stoppage-time when Paul Hayes scored a penalty after Ritchie Humphreys fouled Matthew Sparrow.\n\nOldham moved up to fifth after a 3-0 win at Crewe, with Lee Hughes scoring twice after Darren Byfield’s opener.\n\nPeterborough moved into the play-off places after securing a 1-0 home win over Millwall thanks to Aaron McLean’s goal.\n\nGoals from Danny Graham, Michael Bridges and Graham Kavanagh gave Carlisle a shock 3-0 win over Huddersfield at Brunton Park.\n\nJunior Stanislas scored a late 25-yard goal to give Southend a 1-0 win over Northampton at Roots Hall.\n\nScott Vernon scored three minutes from time to give Colchester a 2-1 win over Brighton at the Withdean Stadium.\n\nAdam Hinshelwood’s own goal had put Colchester on level terms after Nicky Forster’s opener before Vernon got hold of Kemal Izzet’s pass and fired past John Sullivan.\n\nRhys Weston’s goal gave Walsall a 1-0 win in their match against Stockport at the Bescot Stadium.\n\nHereford had to come from behind twice to salvage a home draw with Tranmere.\n\nEdrissa Sonko gave the away side the lead before Toumani Diagouraga’s strike restored parity.\n\nSonko’s second put Tranmere ahead before Stephen Guinan’s 20-yard strike grabbed a point for the hosts 25 minutes from the end.\n\nJack Smith’s second-half penalty gave Swindon a 2-1 win over Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road.\n\nLee Peacock’s first-minute strike had put Swindon ahead before Smith scored Swindon’s second to condemn Leyton Orient, who pulled one back through Tamika Mkandawire, to their 10th defeat of the campaign.\n\nLuke Rodgers levelled Ashley Vincent’s opener to give Yeovil a point in their 1-1 draw with Cheltenham at Huish Park."
