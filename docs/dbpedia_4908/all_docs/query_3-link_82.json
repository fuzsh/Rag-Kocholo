        "text": "Swindon dominated the opening exchanges and Alan Sheehan struck the woodwork inside two minutes, but once Jo Kuffour broke the deadlock with a fantastic finish there was no looking back for the visitors.\n\nPaul Heffernan then struck from close range and Chris Lines fired home a free-kick before half-time to put Rovers completely in control.\n\nAlthough Swindon briefly threatened after the break, Jeff Hughes tapped in from little more than a yard to put the game beyond any doubt and inflict a first defeat in 14 games on the home side.\n\nHere are the key moments from today's game:\n\nTwo mins: Billy Paynter is felled by Danny Coles around 25 yards out. Alan Sheehan takes the resulting free-kick, and curls the ball low past the wall.\n\nRovers keeper Mikkel Andersen is beaten but it strikes the inside of the post, rolls across the goalmouth and somehow stays out, with Scott Cuthbert unable to force home the loose ball.\n\nNine mins: A neat flick from Charlie Austin finds Paynter on the right hand side of the area. The front man edges past Coles and takes an early shot but fails to seriously trouble Andersen.\n\n13 mins: A superb Town move sees Sheehan release Paynter inside the area. His lay-off finds Danny Ward in space, whose low shot is fumbled by Andersen.\n\nAustin pounces on the loose ball and looks certain to break the deadlock until a fantastic saving challenge from Steve Elliott diverts it out for a corner.\n\n25 mins (GOAL 0-1 Kuffour): Rovers have taken the lead completely against the run of play and with their first real chance.\n\nPaul Heffernan's through ball sets Jo Kuffour free, and the striker races away from the chasing Gordon Greer before lifting a top class finish over Town keeper David Lucas and into the far corner.\n\n36 mins: The goal has knocked the stuffing out of Swindon, who have had to cope with large spells of Rovers pressure.\n\nHowever, a neat move involving Austin and Jon-Paul McGovern sees the latter pull the ball back for Paynter, who places his effort over the bar.\n\n39 mins (GOAL 0-2 Heffernan): Town fail to clear their lines from Rovers' first corner of the match. Byron Anthony swings the ball in, which is hooked back across goal by Kuffour.\n\nPaul Heffernan is given time to take a touch and then fires into the bottom corner past Lucas.\n\n45 mins (GOAL 0-3 Lines): Jonathan Douglas is penalised for handball 30 yards out, and Rovers midfielder Chris Lines steps up to strike the free-kick over the wall and straight into the top corner. It's an absolute beauty.\n\n52 mins: Amankwaah dinks the ball into Paynter on the edge of the box with his back to goal.\n\nHe turns and takes an early shot but lashes his effort well wide of the far post. Town have made an encouraging start to the half, but need a goal quickly.\n\n59 mins: Dominic Blizzard's hanging cross is met by the head of winger Jeff Hughes, but he fails to hi the target under pressure from Scott Cuthbert.\n\n61 mins (GOAL 0-4 Hughes): This is quickly becoming a nightmare afternoon for Town.\n\nKuffour's hopeful shot across the face of goal from a tight angle is seemingly left by Lucas.\n\nAnd, with Amankwaah gone walkabout, it leaves Hughes unmarked at the far post to tap in from a yard out.\n\n65 mins: A decent spell of pressure from Swindon ends with substitute Matt Ritchie forcing Andersen into a smart save low down with a decent shot.\n\n66 mins: As the hosts press, a long ball over the top releases Heffernan, but Lucas comes to Town's rescue with a fine stop when left one-on-one with the striker.\n\n74 mins: Sheehan's in-swinging free-kick is only cleared as far as the edge of the box, where Douglas fires in a fierce half-volley, forcing Andersen to parry.\n\nGreer centres the rebound but Rovers manage to scramble the ball to safety.\n\n76 mins: Heffernan robs Cuthbert inside the area and strikes from a really tight angle, but only the legs of Lucas prevent Rovers from grabbing number five.\n\n85 mins: Paynter meets Sheehan's corner with a thumping header which beats Andersen and smacks against the crossbar. A big penalty shout goes up when Ritchie's follow-up strikes the body of Lines, but the referee is having none of it.\n\n86 mins: McGovern tries his luck from 25 yards, curling towards the far post, only to find Andersen match it with a stunning fingertip stop to put the ball out for a corner.\n\n90 mins: Andy Williams strides forward and away from Cuthbert but drags his left-footed shot inches the wrong side of the upright, with Lucas beaten.\n\nTOWN (4-4-2): David Lucas; Kevin Amankwaah, Scott Cuthbert, Gordon Greer (c), Alan Sheehan; Jon-Paul McGovern, Simon Ferry (Matt Ritchie 63), Jonathan Douglas, Danny Ward; Charlie Austin (Vincent Pericard 55), Billy Austin\n\nSubs not used: Phil Smith, Sean Morrison, Lecsinel Jean-Francois, Michael Timlin, Craig Easton\n\nROVERS (4-4-2): Mikkel Andersen; Byron Anthony, Danny Coles, Steve Elliott, Daniel Jones; Dominic Blizzard, Stuart Campbell (c), Chris Lines, Jeff Hughes; Paul Heffernan (Andy Williams 80), Jo Kuffour"
