The 24-year-old showed no signs of cobwebs on his return and was sharp enough to hand his team a seventhminute lead.\n\nWayne Brown swung over a cross-cum-shot that had Nicky Weaver in no-man's land, leaving Hoskins the simple task of heading in at the far post.\n\nBut that was the best Rovers offered and the visitors could only keep Wednesday at bay for three minutes.\n\nClinton Morrison worked himself room to shoot at Mikkel Andersen, who was only able to parry the forward's effort.\n\nChris Sedgwick had the presence of mind to follow up the chance and was perfectly placed to slot in the rebound.\n\nWednesday - backed on by an ever-vociferous crowd - sensed they could capitalise on Rovers' shakiness and poured forward in search of another.\n\nTommy Spurr brought the best out of Andersen with a strike from 25 yards before the stopper kept the Owls at bay with another fine save as he turned behind a strike from Jones.\n\nThe respite was only temporary as Wednesday's rampant play rewarded them with a goal in the 23rd minute - albeit with the help of referee Colin Webster.\n\nThe official appeared to have killed a move with Tommy Miller in possession on the edge of the box, but he eventually evaded the man in the middle to fire past the hapless Andersen.\n\nAny optimism soon evaporated out of the away ranks as they found themselves further behind three minutes later.\n\nThe lively Gary Teale was left unmarked in the area and he applied a neat finish for his third goal of the campaign.\n\nAndersen was picking the ball out of his net again after 32 minutes as Jermaine Johnson ghosted into the danger zone to stroke past the Dane. Teale and his midfield colleagues were given too much freedom, and Anthony resorted to a strong-arm approach.\n\nThe defender hacked down the winger, causing a melee, but it at least helped the visitors get into the break without further damage.\n\nThey rallied and pulled one back when Weaver was caught out by Hoskins' lob, but worries over a fightback never materialised as substitute James O'Connor curled in the fifth.\n\nTeale and Morrison rattled the woodwork before Heffernan came off the bench to polish off a stellar showing that leaves Trollope glancing nervously over his shoulder.\n\nCAPTION(S):\n\nHANDS-ON: Milan Mandaric applauds as Sedgwick equalises in the Owls' 6-2 goalfest"
