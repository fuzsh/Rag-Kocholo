        "text": "John Currie Photo Gallery\n\nJohn Currie was introduced as the sixth Director of Athletics at Wake Forest University by President Emeritus Nathan Hatch on March 4, 2019. An award-winning college athletics leader with 30 years of experience in the ACC, Big 12 and SEC, Currie previously served as athletics director at Kansas State and Tennessee. The 2023-24 academic year will mark his 14th as a Power-5 athletics director.\n\nOn March 15, 2022, Currie received a signal honor for the second time by the National Association of College Directors of Athletics (NACDA) when he was recognized as the Cushman & Wakefield Athletics Director of the Year. The NACDA ADOY Award recognizes administrative excellence within college athletics and highlights positive contributions of athletics directors to student-athletes, campuses and their surrounding communities.\n\nPreviously, he was recognized in 2013 as both a NACDA Under Armour Athletic Director of the Year and as the recipient of the Bobby Dodd Athletic Director Award. He was a Sports Business Journal Forty Under 40 winner in 2011, currently serves as an adjunct faculty member at Columbia University in New York and is a life member of the Fiesta Bowl Board of Directors. Additionally in July 2023, Currie was named to Business North Carolina Magazine’s annual Power List.\n\nSince his appointment in 2019, Currie has focused on supporting student-athletes and building relationships throughout the Wake Forest, Winston-Salem and ACC communities as he has led the Demon Deacons through a historically unique and turbulent period in higher education and intercollegiate athletics.\n\nCurrie’s vision of A Model Intercollegiate Athletics Program includes the core goals of:\n\nA World Class Student-Athlete Experience\n\nIntegrity in Academics, Compliance, Finance, Inclusion and Safety\n\nValue to the University, Winston-Salem and Triad Communities\n\nWin Championships\n\nThe Best Fan Experience in North Carolina\n\nThese goals guide all Athletics decisions and have proven to be the right foundation for facing an unprecedented combination of challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe 2022-23 academic year brought forth many memorable moments for everyone in the Wake Forest and Winston-Salem community, but none more so than when the Demon Deacons women's golf team won its first NCAA Championship and Wake Forest University's 10th national title overall. Wake Forest is now one of only seven ACC schools to win 10 or more national championships, along with Notre Dame, North Carolina, Virginia, Duke, Syracuse and Florida State.\n\nLed by 2023 WGCA National Coach of the Year Kim Lewellen, who Currie signed to a long term contract extension in July 2023, and back-to-back ACC Player of the Year Rachel Kuehn and her All-American teammates, the Deacs defeated USC in a memorable match play final at the NCAA Championships. Coach Lewellen and Lyons Family Associate Head Coach Ryan Potter, who was named the WGCA Assistant Coach of the Year in 2022, have made winning a way of life as they have led the Deacs to a pair of ACC Championships, a runner-up finish at the NCAA Championship in 2019, the 2023 national title, and 20 overall team tournament titles in their five-year tenure leading the program.\n\nAdditionally, Currie’s commitment to a World Class Student-Athlete Experience and his resolve to return Demon Deacons basketball to ACC relevance was demonstrated when he made the only major men’s basketball coaching change of 2020 and navigated the challenges of the pandemic to introduce proven-winner Steve Forbes as Wake Forest's new head coach on April 30, 2020. In just three seasons at the helm of the Demon Deacons, the 2022 ACC Coach of the Year and his staff have led Wake Forest to back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 2008-09 (24-7) and 2009-10 (20-11) and back-to-back seasons with double-digit ACC wins for the first time since the 1995-96 (12-4) and 1996-97 (11-5) seasons. The Deacs also reached the Quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament for the first time since 2009.\n\nSince the start of the 2021-22 season, Wake Forest is 31-5 inside LJVM. During that time, Wake Forest won 15-straight games inside Joel Coliseum, which was the longest home-win streak since the Deacs went 22-0 during the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons. Wake Forest was the first ACC school to reach 31 home wins during the two seasons. The Deacs also had back-to-back 10-0 starts at home for the first time in program history. Additionally, 2021-22 and 2022-23 marked the first time Wake Forest has had back-to-back All-ACC First Team Selections since 2003-05, with ACC Player of the Year Alondes Williams in 2022 and Tyree Appleby in 2023. Appleby was also named the Associated Press ACC Player of the year, marking the first time in the history of the program Wake Forest has had back-to-back AP ACC Players of the Year, along with Williams in 2022.\n\nWith the support of President Susan R. Wente, Ph.D. and University leadership, Currie moved strategically to secure a long term contract extension with 2021 ACC Football Coach of the Year Dave Clawson inking the deal the day before the Deacs clinched their first ACC Atlantic Division title in 15 years. A month later, the Deacs capped an 11-3 season with the TaxSlayer Gator Bowl championship. Wake Forest became the first ACC school since 2004-05 to sweep the football and men’s basketball coach of the year honors when Coach Forbes was honored March 7, 2022.\n\nThe Demon Deacons football momentum continued in 2022 as they defeated Southeastern Conference representative Missouri, 27-17 in the Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Fla. on Dec. 23, 2022. The win marked Wake Forest's fifth bowl win in the last seven years. During this time, the Deacs also began the Atlantic Coast Conference's second-longest bowl streak and the country's tied for the 10th-longest back in 2016. The 2022 Wake Forest football team (8-5 Overall) was just the 10th in program history to win eight games in a season in the 115-year history of the program.\n\nWith the success of the past two seasons, the Deacs have set a new standard for success in the win column with a record of 19-8 over the last two seasons. The 19 wins in a two-year period are the second most in school history and three away from the program record of 21 set in 2006 & 2007. Additionally, Wake Forest's 19-8 record is tied for the ninth-best mark in all of Power-5 in the last two seasons.\n\nIn May 2022 with the support of President Wente and Wake Forest University leadership, Currie made a change in the women’s basketball head coaching position and following a thorough and inclusive search process, he tabbed Megan Gebbia, a proven winner and holder of multiple NCAA appearances, conference titles and coach of the year accolades, as the Deacs new mentor.\n\nIn her first season at the helm, Wake Forest tallied 17 wins which tied for the most by a first-year head coach in program history and that total is the highest mark for our women’s hoops program since the 2011-12 season. Big-time victories in Coach Gebbia’s first season included back-to-back home wins over NCAA Tournament teams in Louisville and Miami in late January, a victory over Minnesota in the ACC/B1G Challenge and a 20-point comeback win over FSU in the second round of the ACC Tournament. Currie signed Coach Gebbia to a contract extension in July 2023.\n\nFinally after a historic 2023 season by the Diamond Deacs that led to Wake Forest’s first appearance in the Men’s College World Series since 1955 and after the Deacs were ranked No. 1 in the country for two months of the season won the regular season ACC title for the first time since 1963, Currie signed head coach Tom Walter to a long-term extension. Following their memorable run, Wake Forest had the most players in the ACC and the second-most in the country (10) selected in the 2023 MLB Draft, including two first-round picks for the first time in school history with two-time ACC Pitcher of the Year Rhett Lowder going No. 7 to the Cincinnati Reds and All-American third baseman Brock Wilken going No. 18 to the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nIndividually, Lowder became the sixth Demon Deacon to earn the Anthony J. McKevlin Award following the 2022-23 academic year, which is presented annually to the ACC's top male athlete. He joined exclusive Demon Deacon company to be selected for the award, as Tim Duncan (1997), Randolph Childress (1995), Brian Piccolo (1965), Len Chappell (1962) and Dickie Hemric (1955) are the other Wake Forest recipients. In addition to being the first player in program history to receive this honor, he is also just the sixth baseball player in conference history to be selected in the 70-year history of the award.\n\nAcademic excellence is reflected in Wake Forest’s most recent report card, with a combined Demon Deacons graduate success rate of a record-score of 96 percent, including eight programs scoring a perfect 100 percent rate. A record total of 317 Wake Forest student-athletes have earned spots on the 2022-23 Atlantic Coast Conference Honor Roll, which marks the fourth-consecutive year that the Demon Deacons have landed more than 280 student-athletes on the ACC Academic Honor Roll. Overall, 317 student-athletes represent 70 percent of the all Demon Deacon student-athletes! Additionally, this is the fourth-consecutive year that over 50 percent of the student-athletes have landed on the list.\n\nDeacon Club donors have also responded in resounding fashion as Currie’s team persevered through the pandemic to reach a new all-time Wake Forest Athletics cash giving record of $37.5 million in FY21 and followed that up with record participation of 5,315 individual donors in FY22. This 2022-23 academic year included more records as alumni, parents and members of the Winston-Salem community contributed over $20.1 million in support of scholarships, enrichment programs like career development, and Excellence Funds to provide a competitive advantage for each sports team, marking a nearly 47% increase over the previous record high.\n\nIncluding gifts to endowments and capital projects in addition to the $20.1 million in annual fund support, over 5,100 donors contributed over $32.8 million to Wake Forest Athletics in Fiscal Year 2023.\n\nThanks to the leadership generosity of Bob ('61) and Michele McCreary and the 4th Quarter Drive, Wake Forest student-athletes will move into the new 60,000 square foot $38 million McCreary Football Complex in fall 2023, which broke ground back on Feb. 12, 2022. This complex is debt-free, fully funded by donor gifts including design, construction, and a maintenance reserve. Additionally, construction of the McCreary Complex provides tremendous Value to Winston-Salem as an estimated 337 jobs were created as a result of the project and tens of millions of dollars were spent in sales/output and compensation of workers. Ninety percent of the funds raised for the project came from outside the Triad region.\n\nAdditionally on Sept. 1, 2022, Wake Forest University dedicated the new on-campus clubhouses of men's and women's basketball student-athletes. These projects came to life thanks to the incredible leadership of nearly 300 loyal supporters, including alumni Dr. Caryl Guth, Chris Paul and Mit Shah. Wake Forest Athletics partnered with Vannoy Construction as the contractor for the project and the architecture firm of Walter Robbs provided the design. Additionally, construction of these clubhouses provided tremendous Value to Winston-Salem as 41 different sub contractors/trades worked on this project and approximately 195 jobs were created. With that, 33 of the 41 contractors that worked on this project are located within a 35 mile radius of Wake Forest's Reynolda campus. Also, 56.5 percent of the funds raised for the project came from outside the Triad region.\n\nThese projects are a part of Wake Forest Athletics 4th Quarter Drive, which now shifts our focus to the renovation of the Miller Center for Student-Athlete Academic Services/Student-Athlete Career Development. Nearly 500 donors have contributed to the 4th Quarter Drive effort.\n\nWake Forest Athletics also recently invested in new turf surfaces at Kentner Stadium and Allegacy Stadium.\n\nOther unique gifts and University-altering sponsorship agreements were announced in the Spring and Summer of 2023 as Athletics announced the first named coaching position, the Lyons Family Associate Golf Head Coach for men and women and a multi-million dollar from passionate supporters like Pam ('79) and Jeff Kentner ('78) that is earmarked for baseball and men’s golf. Meanwhile, Wake Forest announced the new name for the best football program in the state of North Carolina on June 21, 2023, Allegacy Stadium! This video highlights how this new multi-year commitment is deepening the historic partnership between Allegacy Federal Credit Union and Wake Forest University. And, on June 21, 2023 Wake Forest announced a transformational agreement with Truist Bank. Truist's longtime partnership with Wake Forest Athletics now establishes Truist as a Presenting Partner of Wake Forest Women's Athletics.\n\nInclusion efforts since Currie’s arrival, including Truist’s new partnership, include the creation of the Robert Grant and Kenneth “Butch” Henry Trailblazer Award honoring the first Black Demon Deacon football players and recognizing the historical role Wake Forest Athletics played in integrating sports in the South. For current student-athletes, the Demon Deacon Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) voter registration drive resulted in 99% of Wake Forest student-athlete participation in the Nov. 2020 election. Strong statements for social justice and racial reconciliation in social media and other outlets, and intentional dialogue and engagement throughout Athletics has created a path for better understanding among coaches, staff and student-athletes alike.\n\nAthletics adopted the University’s R.I.D.E. framework -- Realizing Inclusion Diversity and Equity -- and remains committed to seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity; recognizing that each Unique Deac makes Wake Forest thrive. Examples of R.I.D.E. initiatives include annual enrichment of all 400-plus student-athletes and 200-plus staff members participated in Feb. 2022 called, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion \"The Roadside Assistance Workshop.\"\n\nRecently in Feb. 2023, Wake Forest Athletics welcomed Dr. Derek Greenfield to visit with our coaches, staff and student-athletes. His dynamic and interactive approach, creative ideas and sense of humor helped break down barriers and enabled productive conversations about bias and inclusion among all those associated with Athletics. This initiative was in the ongoing effort to expand our perspectives and another way Athletics helps support its student-athletes.\n\nThroughout the 2021-22 academic year, Wake Forest Athletics celebrated the 50th Anniversary of Women’s Intercollegiate Athletics, presented by Blue Cross NC. The success of this year-long initiative was bolstered by $4.1 million from 778 donors. What started as a modest goal of 50 gifts of $25,000 turned into an incredible initiative that will help sustain and empower our storied and successful women's programs. Meanwhile, the Winston-Salem community has come together for the first ever joint-performances of HBCU Winston-Salem State University’s Red Sea of Sound with the Wake’s Spirit of the Old Gold & Black for both the 2019 and 2021 football season openers. And in the fall of 2021, Inside Higher Ed provided national acclaim for Wake Forest’s innovative student pregame tailgate zone which brought together members of 29 campus organizations and over 80 percent of the Wake Forest student body to multiple football games.\n\nWake’s focus on grass roots community engagement, brand building and delivering The Best Fan Experience in North Carolina has included the launch of the DEACTOWN concept, on campus, around Winston-Salem and anywhere Deacon fans find themselves. For the first time ever, Wake Forest hosted ESPN’s College Gameday, Sept. 12, 2020, generating exposure value to the University in excess of 13 million. A massive growth in social media presence continues as Wake Forest Athletics Twitter and Instagram accounts grew a combined 28% (16,573 new followers) in 2022 and overall accrued 150 million Twitter and Instagram impressions across Deacon sports in 2021. Other fan friendly developments have been the Allegacy Stadium DEACTOWN Fan Zone and Field Level Terrace, a partnership with R&D Brewing to create Deacon Brew last fall, the official craft beer of Wake Forest Athletics while the Deacs have also entered a long-term partnership with Winston-Salem-based HanesBrands®, Inc. (HBI).\n\nWhile the incredible results of the 2021 and 2022 football seasons can still be felt across the Winston-Salem community as the Deacs are an astounding 20-4 at home since the start of the 2019 season, those results were witnessed by a record number of fans. Allegacy Stadium has hosted five sellout crowds over the past two seasons and this past fall marked the first time since 2011 that Wake Forest has had three-straight home sellouts. Meanwhile, the Liberty and Clemson sellouts in 2022 marked the first two capacity crowds inside Allegacy Stadium in the month of Sept. since 2006.\n\nAllegacy Stadium hosted a total of 210,350 fans across the Deacs seven home contests last fall and a school-record 23,643 students attended games this past fall.\n\nMeanwhile inside Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Wake Forest Athletics recorded its highest student attendance for a season since 2008-09 (12,643) and almost all of our second semester games featured over 1,000 Screamin' Demons in the stands. Additionally, Joel Coliseum averaged nearly 10,000 fans in attendance across our 10 home conference games, which marked the sixth-highest total in the ACC.\n\nThrough Currie’s leadership and in an effort to ensure Athletics is providing the Best Fan Experience in North Carolina, Athletics has implemented postgame and quarterfly surveys that are sent directly to fans who attend games to ensure feedback is heard and constant improvements can be made so fans can get the most out of their ACC football and basketball experience in Winston-Salem.\n\nIt's important to note the incredible platform Wake Forest student-athletes have to showcase their skills as they compete on an annual basis. Beyond the aggregate 20 million fans that watch the Demon Deacons football team compete on an annual basis each fall, more than six million fans watched the Diamond Deacs compete in the Men's College World Series. Specifically on baseball, Wake’s games against LSU in Omaha drew over 2 million viewers, which outranked ESPN's average broadcast of a Red Sox - Yankees game on Sunday Night Baseball.\n\nOther recent competitive successes beyond football, basketball, baseball and women’s golf include:\n\nWake Forest continues to Win Championships under Currie’s leadership, as the Demon Deacons now have 56 ACC team titles following the men’s cross country championship in 2022.\n\nThe Demon Deacons won their first XC men’s title since 1994.\n\nMen's cross country head coach John Hayes received 2022 ACC Coach of the Year honors and was named the Southeast Region Coach of the Year each of the past two years.\n\nCoach Hayes’ squad placed fifth at the NCAA Championships in 2022.\n\nThe Deacs’ men's & women's golf programs captured the 2022 Atlantic Coast Conference Golf Championship trophies for the first time in school history in the same year.\n\nWake Forest’s women's program followed their championship with a clean sweep of the conference's yearly awards. This marked the second time in program history, and first time since 1995, the Demon Deacons women's program won ACC Coach (Kim Lewellen), Player (Rachel Kuehn) and Freshman (Carolina Chicarra) of the Year awards. With that, the Deacs are one of just two ACC programs to outright win all of the top awards multiple times in league history.\n\nRemarkably in the fall of 2022, all competing programs qualified for postseason competition for the first time in program history.\n\nOverall during the 2021-22 academic year, Wake Forest had 14 of its 18 programs qualified for postseason action.\n\nCollectively, the Demon Deacons were 31-30-1 against our Big 4 rivals in 2021-22 and Wake Forest swept the Wolfpack in football, men's basketball and baseball in regular season action.\n\nWomen’s tennis student-athletes Anna Brylin and Brooke Killingsworth becoming the first doubles team to win an ITA All-Americans Championship in the fall of 2021.\n\nMen’s Tennis has been consistently nationally ranked and made an appearance at the ITA National Indoor Championships each of the past two seasons.\n\nWomen's soccer qualified for the 2022 NCAA Tournament for the 22nd time in program history and men's soccer extended its ACC-best streak of NCAA Tournament appearances to 12-straight, which is five more years than the next conference school in Virginia Tech. Additionally, Wake Forest once again ranked in the top-10 nationally in total attendance and average attendance per home match.\n\nWomen’s basketball earned its second-ever berth in the NCAA Tournament in 2021.\n\nIndividual ACC Indoor Track & Field Championships in 2021 by Anna Bush and Tony Jones, followed by an incredible cross country season fall where the Deacs won the Southeast Regional for the first time since 1993.\n\nThe 2021-22 academic year culminated with ACC Champion Thomas Vanoppen earning a fourth-place finish in the 1,500 meter final earned him First Team All-America honors. Additionally, Zach Facioni, Tony Jones, Anna Bush and Emma Soderstrom all merited All-America distinctions in Eugene in June 2021.\n\nAndrew White captured All-America status at the 2023 NCAA Indoor Championships in the weight throw.\n\nThe Diamond Deacs finished the 2022 season with 41 wins, the fifth most in program history and became the first squad since 2017 to reach 40 wins and posted Wake Forest's seventh 40-win season in program history. Additionally, Wake Forest made the program's 14th NCAA Tournament appearance and finished tied for the second-most wins in the conference, while leading the ACC's Atlantic division.\n\nWake Forest’s field hockey program led by three-time NCAA Championship coach Jen Averill was nationally ranked the entire 2021 and 2022 seasons. Coach Jen Averill was named the ACC Coach of the Year as she got her team back into the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2018.\n\nFinally, volleyball posted its first winning season since 2010 in 2021 and backed that up in 2022 with another winning campaign and Coach Randi Smart’s squad participated in the National Invitational Volleyball Championship (NIVC) postseason tournament for the first time in program history.\n\nContractually beyond the aforementioned extensions for Clawson, Forbes Lewellen and Walter, Head Men’s Golf Coach Jerry Haas, Head Men’s Soccer Coach Bobby Muuss, Head Field Hockey Coach Jen Averill and Head Volleyball Coach Randi Smart have signed extensions in the past two years furthering Wake Forest’s mutual commitment to ensure the continued growth of each program competitively, in the classroom and in the community.\n\nAs the leader of Wake Forest Athletics, Currie is continuing to build on his prior success. During his 2009-2017 run at Kansas State, Currie turned a program with an inherited deficit into one of the NCAA’s most financially solvent and sustainable. He conceived and built $210 million in new state-of-the-art facilities, benefitting all 16 Wildcat sports, entirely funded without state tax, university tuition or fee dollars. In 2016, Kansas State’s Bill Snyder Family Stadium was one of five finalists for the Sports Business Journal Facility of the Year. During his K-State tenure, the Wildcats won Big 12 championships in football, men’s basketball and baseball, appeared in seven consecutive bowl games, had 17 teams earn NCAA berths, and won 11 individual NCAA titles. Currie’s career fundraising accomplishments include record private gifts of $50 million at Tennessee in 2008 and $60 million at K-State in 2014.\n\nCurrie holds a master’s degree in sports administration from the University of Tennessee and earned his undergraduate degree in history from Wake Forest University in 1993. He and his wife of 23 years, Mary Lawrence, are the proud parents of three children, Jack, Gigi and Mary-Dell, and King Charles Cavaliers named Charlie and Chase.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQuotes Upon Hiring on March 4, 2019\n\n“I am delighted to welcome John Currie and his wife, Mary Lawrence, back home to their alma mater, Wake Forest.
