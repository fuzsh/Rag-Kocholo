The 30-year-old suffered a double ankle break during a League Cup tie against Brighton in 2013 and has been battling to regain fitness ever since.

Anthony began his career with Cardiff before joining Forest Green on loan six years later.

Following his release from the Welsh side he moved on to Bristol Rovers in 2006 where we helped the club gain promotion to League One.

A brief spell with Hereford in 2012 ended with Anthony signing for his home-town club Newport later that season.

“It’s been a long hard road since August last year, but I always remained positive and had good people in my family and friends around me,” he told the official club website.

“I’ve tried to get back to full fitness but I was never quite there, even when I returned to play I have been trying to play through the pain.

“I’ve had an extremely good career and enjoyed my time in the game, getting my home-town club back into the Football League has been a highlight for me.”

Manager Justin Edinburgh added: “Byron has been a great servant for this football club and it is with regret that we have to see him retire from the game.

“I speak on behalf of everybody at the football club when thanking Byron for his commitment to his home-town club.”
