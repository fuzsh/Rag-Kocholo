It attempts to present the history of the last 150 years of Europn civilization in a new way. The conventional belief that European history must be presented in ^erms of the separate component nations, and of the com.ng together of their representatives in wars or conferences, conflicts or compacts, is being more openly doubted. .The belief* which this study is based that tendencies which transcend several nations at once have a ratner special historical importance - is gaining ground. If the notion, is welcomed that these tendencies, rather than separate governmental pohc.es are a good and interesting focus for historical study, it is because such an approach can give European studies that greater cohesion and coherence which seem appropriate in o* postwar experience For this edition the story has been continued to the end of 1963, which means to the brink of the space age. H* text and bibliography have been revised in the light of corrections and comments received from helpful readers. I make no apology, even since the collapse of Britain s negotiations to enter the European Economic Community, for having throughout considered the British Isles & a part of European civUization.\n\nDAY ID THOMSON Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge\n\nPREFACE PREFACE be no generalizations ... .’I, too, detect no plot or predetermined pattern; but I can see’certain rhythms of movement and certain patterns of change.

The English liberal historian and politician, H. A. L.

These harmonies are concealed from me.

Since all history is one continuum, and no division by dates has more than a relative validity, the trends of continuity and overlap and interplay have always been emphasized. The eras of two World Wars, as well as the era of French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, deserve special attention because of the combination of internal strains and upheavals with international changes which characterized both. But the great peace settlements have been treated in conjunction with the wars which they ended, as well as with the immediate aftermath of the wars for which they have too often been held responsible. I have emphasized, too, those more long-term forces of change, such as industrialism and urbanization and the impact of newljdeas and beliefs, for these have a habit of operating before, during, and after great wars with a disconcerting impetus and persistence which it is beyond the power of statesmen and peacemakers to deflect or modify by more than a very limited degree. ’ If the main divisions are unities of time, defined with a necessary imprecision in terms of generations or decades, the internal structure of each Part has been devised mainly according to unities of place. The shaping of Europe becomes more intelligible if nations are considered in groups less according to their momentary diplomatic alignments than according to the forces of change which, at a particular time, they were experiencing in common. Geography or economic growth may throw nations into more significant groupings than diplomacy or politics, but over a relatively long time even this grouping or its significance may change. Until about 1850 the peoples of Italy and Germany belonged together more closely with the peoples of eastern Europe, in their phase of political and economic growth; but after 1871 they belonged together .more closely with the nations of western Europe, with the United Kingdom and France and Belgium, than with Austria-Hungary, Russia, or Ottoman Turkey. Accordingly the Chapter divisions of Part in, dealing with the generation between 1815 and 1850, are made in terms of the chronological spread of revolutionary movements throughout Europe as a whole; whereas in Part IV, dealing with the era of rapid industrialization in the west and of the making of new states in Italy, Germany, and Austria-Hungary, the main divisions are regional. Then again, in dealing with the longer span of time between 187^ and 1914. the main themes appear to be, on one hand, the internal growth of universal suffrage, of a wealth greater than mankind had 18 PREFACE ever known, of new organizations of capital and labour, and of socialism; and, on the other, the international rivalries and collisions brought about by the scramble for colonies and for diplomatic Dalliances. The domestic developments of that period are of such momentous importance for the twentieth century that they have been given somewhat fuller attention than they often receive in a general history of Europe; and although these two themes have been examined separately in Parts V and VI, their interaction has been explained in Chapter 21. Only by some such flexible structure can the broad lines of the complex evolution of modern Europe be made clear. Conventional distinctions between national and international history are artificial, just as differentiation into political, economic, social, cultural, and’ other aspects of human development is convenient but represents no objective reality. Such\n\ndistinctions have been treated as of only secondary meaning in this study. Similar methods have been applied to the period since 1914, and it is hoped that the hindsight which has become possible .since 1945 has enabled this period of more strictly ’contemporary history’ to be interpreted more as a whole and in a more meaningful perspective. The Parts have’deliberately been kept few and large, in order to delineate the general trends and characteristics of the whole period; but they are divided internally into Chapters which have been numbered consecutively throughout the book and which, in turn,’have been subdivided. There -is, in short, a certain fugue-like quality about the process of historical change, and this has been directly considered in the Epilogue. The structure of the book has been designed to bring out this quality as clearly and as completely as possible. The history of the United Kingdom has been presented as an integral part of the history of the European continent. Its important initiatives and differences, its special peculiarities, have not, I hope, been neglected; and this might equally be said of every other European nation, since ”it is” as important to indicate contrasts as to stress similarities. It is in the rich diversity and striking contrasts, as well as in the revelation of often concealed undercurrents of general movement, that the alluring interest of modern European history lies. In a study of this scope and size, about which libraries have already been written, it would be futile to hope for either completeness or perfection. My indebtedness to previous writers on the subject is so great that detailed acknowledgements are impossible. In the Bibliography I have indicated sonic of the many good books used and consulted, and in which further information or discussion can be found. For the errors of fact or interpretation which must have eluded all efforts to keep them out, I pm alone responsible and 1 shall be grateful if my attention\n\nPREFACE is drawn • to them. The constant need to rethink, and to encourage others to rethink, the recent story of European civilization is perhaps excuse enough for venturing upon an undertaking so large and so ambitious. This book has been devised chiefly for the use of university students in the United States and in Britain, and rests on close upon tnirty years’ experience of teaching modern history to such students - mainly in Cambridge, England, but also at Columbia University in New York. My debt to them all, which is-very great, may be in part repaid if their successors on either side’ of the Atlantic find that this account of events which concern us all is of interest, use, and even enjoyment. . 1 am indebted also to Messrs R. R. Palmer and Joel Colton, authors of A History of the Modern World, and to Messrs C. E. Black and E. C. Helmreich, authors of Twentieth Century Europe, for maps taken from these books. To the cartographer Theodore R. Miller, whose maps with simplifications are here included, to the College Department of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., and to Mr and Mrs Alfred A. Knopf themselves for their many kindnesses, I am most grateful.. Mrs Kay Barnes (now Wesley) typed the whole of the work and at every stage in its production gave invaluable help for which I am deeply indebted. To my wife, whose eye for obscurities of expression and inelegancies of style is so acute, I offer apologies for those which have doubtless escaped even her patient scrutiny, as well as gratitude for saving me from all the rest.\n\nDAVIDTHOMSON Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge March 1965\n\nPART ONE\n\nEUROPE IN THE MELTING POT 1789-1814 1. Revolution in France 2. France at War 3. Dictatorship in France 4. Napoleonic Empire J-.S.K.-2\n\nIN the year 1789 two events of world importance happened. The new federal Constitution of the United States of America came into operation; revolution broke out in France. While the New World entered upon an era of integration and expansion within a flexible framework of government, the Old World relapsed into twenty-five years of great disorder and upheaval which shattered its existing political structure. The sequence of events in Europe during the quarter century after 1789 can be described in four dramatic words: Revolution, War, Dictatorship, Empire. The story can be told, and has often been told, as an epic of heroic grandeur, marching remorselessly toward its predestined end. In this view, violent revolution led naturally to war; revolution and war, in combination, had as their nemesis the. dictatorship of a soldier; and military dictatorship led no less naturally and fatalistically to the Caesarist ambitions of Napoleon. These successive upheavals haunted all” subsequent development in Europe, for it was by receiving the message of the Revolution, enduring the wars that it caused, experiencing the efficient but exacting rule of Napoleon, and struggling to free themselves from his tyranny, that the nations of Europe took modern shape. This romantic interpretation of the making of modern Europe cannot be accepted. Historians have become suspicious of inevitability, too conscious of complexities and too inquisitive about the mysterious working of historical change, to accept unchallenged this neat standardized account of how nineteenthcentury Europe began. The consequences of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Empire, and of the wars to which both gave rise, were indeed of great importance. But they were variable in importance and by no means the only formative influences on nineteenth-century Europe. Nor was the sequence of events inevitable. The necessary prologue to an exploration of European history since 1815 is some assessment of how each of these four main phases of change did give place to the next, and of how profound, permanent, and general was their accumulative effect on later generations.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE THE REVOLUTIONARY SITUATION IT is a paradox that no important people or forces in France of 1789 wanted revolution. Revolutions may begin, as wars often begin, not because people positively want them. They happen because people want other things that, in a certain set of circumstances, implicate them in revolution or in war. There had been growing in Europe, throughout most of the eighteenth century, what has been called ’the revolutionary spirit’. This spirit, a. spirit of rationalist criticism and of resistance to the established powers of the Roman Catholic Church, the absolutist monarchy, and the privileged nobility, was fostered particularly by the work of a remarkable series of French thinkers and literary men, the philosophes. The writings of men like Voltaire, Montesquieu, Diderot, and Rousseau were widely read throughout Europe, and they themselves became European figures of eminence and influence. But the connexion between their ideas and the outbreak of revolution in 1789 is’ somewhat remote and indirect. They did not preach revolution, and were usually ready enough to lend support to any absolute monarch who was prepared to patronize them and adopt their teachings. Nor were most of their readers inspired to want, or to work for, revolution; they were mostly themselves aristocrats, lawyers, business people, and local dignitaries, whose lot in the existing order was far from unhappy. The doctrines of the philosophes came to be used later on, during the course of the revolution in France, often to justify measures that the philosophes themselves would have opposed. Their teachings became more important later; if they had any influence at all on the outbreak and the initial stages of the great revolution, it was only to the extent that they had fostered a critical and irreverent attitude toward all existing institutions. They made men more ready, when the need arose, to question the whole foundation of the old order. What mattered in 1789 - and what made men revolutionary almost in spite of themselves - was the whole ’revolutionary situation’; and in producing that situation the work of the philosophes played no very important role. The essence of the ’revolutionary situation’ was that the King, who was the linchpin of the whole established social and political system in 24 THE REVOLUTIONARY SITUATION\n\nFrance, was in desperate financial straits. For a decade before, successive ministers had tried to put royal finances on a.sounder footing, but all had failed. The costs of government were increasing rapidly, and the cost of wars simply could not be met from .the usual sources of royal revenue. It was no new thing for a French king to be hard up; indeed it was the normal situation. But the various means by which he could properly raise taxes had already been so fully and so wastefully exhausted that the country was heavily burdened. By the standards of the time France was a very large, populous, rich, and powerful state. Her foreign trade had increased fivefold since the death of Louis XIV in 1715. She had a bigger middle class of businessmen and small manufacturers and a generally more prosperous peasantry than any other state in Europe. The peasants owned two fifths of the soil and worked almost all of it. But these very facts contributed to the ’revolutionary situation’. It tends to be people with something to\n\nlose, and not merely something to gain, who think most eagerly of improving the existing state of society. And that was what people thought of most in 1789. There was an insistent demand for reform of certain abuses, a more efficient and equitable’ system of taxation and administration, a better system of government. The last thing most people wanted was violent and destructive revolution, which they knew might deprive them of what they had without gaining for them what they wished. Louis XVI won fresh popularity when he made known his intention of summoning the Estates-General, which was the nearest institution France had to a parliament representative of the whole.nation. His action aroused hopes of liberal and constitutional reforms, because it was the traditional role of the monarch to defend the mass of his subjects against abuses and hardships. Just as nobody of importance wanted revolution, so nobody of importance wanted a republic. It was 1792 before a republican movement of any strength appeared, and until then the hopes of reformers centred upon the King and not against him. Yet the King’s well-received action of summoning the EstatesGeneral precipitated revolution. The economic and social structure of France had greatly outgrown her political and governmental system. There was a sharp and bitterly resented contrast between the economically effective parts and the politically effective parts of the nation. Her traditional legal and political structure gave special privileges to the two classes most divorced in outlook and interests from the peasantry and the middle classes - the higher clergy and the nobility. These two segments of the ruling class had much in common, and many of the higher offices in the Church were held by aristocrats. By the time of Louis XVI every bishop was a nobleman, and members of noble families almost 25\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE\n\nmonopolized the highest posts of government service and the army. Since they numbered in all only about half a million out of a population of 24 or 25 million, political power was concentrated in very few hands. This was one of the bitterest grievances of the growing and wealthy class of merchants, businessmen, financiers, and lawyers, who collectively also owned a good deal of the land but who were excluded by the chances of birth and social status from most of the more responsible and dignified offices in state and Church. Moreover, because clergy and nobles enjoyed so many exemptions from taxation, the main burden of meeting the expenses of state and Church fell on the middle classes and the more prosperous peasants. The summoning of the Estates-General suddenly gave them an opportunity to make their social and economic weight politically effective. It was a chance they seized with both hands. By not only arousing hopes of liberal reform but then drawing together many of the people most eager for an overhaul of the social and political system, Louis crystallized the revolutionary situation. He confronted the representatives of the privileged orders, the First and Second Estates of clergy and nobility, with the representatives of the unprivileged orders, the Third Estate of middle class and peasantry. Then by attempting to handle this critical situation through obsolete procedures and creaking, rusty machinery, and with no clear plans or firm sense of direction, the King began a train of events which led in the end to his own downfall. It was only after he bad forfeited his original public support by his lack of policy, his wavering and disappointing conduct, and in the end his open betrayal of his own promises, that republicanism grew. Only the king, in eighteenth-century France, could * have created a republic. The King and his ministers were themselves in a dilemma. The situation was inherently revolutionary, because the king and his ministers, with the best will in the world, could not satisfy the demands of the middle classes and peasants for a larger share of political power and a smaller share of taxation without destroying the tangle of ancient rights by which nobles and Church had their own law courts and powers of jurisdiction, monopolized all the most lucrative offices in the state, and enjoyed immunity from the main burdens of taxation. They could not do this without challenging and changing the whole social and political structure of France, the essential character of the old order, in which their own authority was deeply embedded. The French monarchy was a feudal monarchy, based on the centuries-old accumulation of feudal relationships between king, aristocracy, clergy, and all the rest of the population known as the Third Estate’. The right of the king to rule 26 THE CRISIS OF 1789 existed on the same foundations as the rights and immunities of the privileged orders. To attack any part of this anomalous and fossilized structure was to attack by implication every other part, including royal power itself. Yet the power of the king was regarded as absolute; and it was absolute in so far as there existed no public authority with an acknowledged right to check or deny the power of the king to govern as he chose. It had been checked in the past only by violent resistance on the part of over-mighty nobles or by obstructionist behaviour of the local parlements. both reactionary and not reformist forces. The king who claimed to rule by Divine Right and to wield absolute authority was in fact enmeshed in a system that denied him autonomy in jurisdiction, obliged him to rule only through the privileged orders of society, and cornpelled him to finance his rule by unjust and wasteful fiscal\n\narrangements. His authority came not from Gpd but only from prescription; his power was not absolute, only arbitrary. Only a monarch prepared to be a revolutionary could have esfcaped from the dilemma. It was a position of :deadlockiand stalemate, where reform was inhibited by prudence, and revolution prevented only by apathy. The situation could not have lasted indefinitely, and perhaps the chief cause for surprise is that it had lasted so long. Already other states, notably Great Britain and Prussia, had escaped from similar positions, one by evolving strong parliamentary institutions, the other by concentrating more substantial power in her monarchy. When the Estates-General met, there were many proposals in the air for ways in which France could similarly solve the dilemma. Most attractive an’d persuasive of these was the argument put forward by the Abbe Sieves, who was to become one of the most indefatigable constitution-makers of the next twenty years. In his pamphlet, widely read by members of the EstatesGeneral, he asked the crucial question, ’What is the Third Estate?’ His answer was that it was nearly everybody, yet it counted for nothing: that it was identical with the nation, yet excluded from the government of the nation. This was exactly what many already believed, but in. January 1789 Sieyes put it in a nutshell. THE CRISIS OF 1789 There was thus, in the France of 1789, anjnherent constitutional crisis, if the term may be used of a country that really had no constitution at all in the American or British sense. This theoretically absolute monarchy was in practice powerless to effect the changes that most urgently needed making. When it was obliged to admit its complete bankruptcy as well, a financial crisis was superimposed on-the constix 27\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE national crisis. But behind these lay an even more serious crisis, which contributed a particularly explosive element to the whole situation. It was the even less appreciated economic crisis in the country caused by prolonged inflation. Between 1726 and 1780 France had absorbed no less than half the precious metals imported into Europe, and in the course of the eighteenth century her population had increased from roughly’18 to 25 million. With much more metallic currency in circulation, an expansion of credit facilities, an increased demand for goods on the part of her larger population, and a relatively slow expansion in production, prices inevitably rose. As compared with the average general prices of consumers’ goods between 1726 and 1741, prices between 1785 and 1789 were 65 per cent higher; and even in the longer period 1771-89 they averaged 45 per cent higher. Average money wages rose only about a third as fast as prices, and the cost of living rose most steeply for those who were living closest to subsistence level. Even nature added to the crisis. The harvests of 1787 and 1788 were bad, partly because of great hailstones in 1788. This brought extreme social distress, whjch forced many desperate and hungry men into the few large towns. It was this that introduced the element of violence, because it made the Paris mob and led to the peasant riots (or jacqueries) of the countryside in 1789. • The political crisis of 1789, which started the course of events that made the revolution, is explicable only in this setting of deep economic and social crisis. When, in preparation for the meeting of the EstatesGeneral in May 1789, the localities were invited to prepare cahiers or lists of grievances, it was the long-standing grievances that got listed: the lack of’ a ’constitution’ to restrict ministerial despotism, the ne’ed to lighten the burden of indirect taxes and to control taxation by periodic national assemblies, the desirability of ending internal customs barriers and of ensuring freedom of the press. The more immediate discontents of the rural population got eliminated from many of the cahiers and were scarcely voiced in the assembly. This neglect only enhanced their importance as a source of violent upheaval and made for a general revolt in the countryside in the summer of 1789. Although the accumulating crisis could not longer be deferred, it might still have been eased in several different ways. If the King could have found and kept able ministers who had a realistic grasp of the needs of the moment, and if they could have used the Estates-General to put through a clear and comprehensive policy of constitutional and fiscal reforms, it is conceivable that some more durable form of constitutional monarchy might have evolved. But the personalities of all the 28 THE CRISIS OF 1789 leading figures militated against this possibility: the character of the King, who was well-meaning but weak-willed; even more the character of the Queen, Marie Antoinette, whose Austrian connexions and notorious frivolity and extravagance made her very unpopular, and who persistently used her influence with the King to kilUany projects of reform; the character of the Comte de Mirabeau, the ablest statesman and de; bater who served the monarchy but also the most personally disreputable\n\nand distrusted; the royal entourage, including the King’s brothers, whose intransigence and irresponsibility helped to doom the monarchy for the future. Alternatively, if the privileged orders could have been persuaded to surrender voluntarily their great administrative and juridical privileges . and their fiscal immunities, the impasse might have been broken without bloodshed and violence. On 17 June the Third Estate took the title of National Assembly, and was joined by individual clergy and nobles. On 4 August 1789 there took place within it the famous surrender of feudal privileges, when liberal nobles vied with one another in giving up their ancient rights and the clergy competed with them in sacrificing tithes and church rights. But that remarkable burst of generosity was modified in several ways. It is true that such important grievances as aristocratic immunity from taxation, serfdom, forced labour (corvee), I arid the monopolistic and judicial privileges of the nobles were then | destroyed, and were destroyed without indemnity. But other important ! feudal dues were to be commuted and redeemed, and the National Assembly was hoping to salvage the more important feudal property rights by sacrificing the less valuable. Even the genuine sacrifices so made ** were vitiated by the fact that they came a month too late - after the Paris mob had tasted power in the fall of the Bastille on 14 July, and after the peasants throughout the countryside had begun burning the chateaux, destroying feudal archives, and asserting their own freedom from feudal burdens. The Assembly completed its gesture of generosity by conferring on Louis XVI the title of ’Restorer of French Liberty’ and then decreed that ’the feudal regime is entirely destroyed’. Frencht men knew that it was not Louis but the action of the population as a whole which had restored liberty, and that it was the peasants, not the Assembly, who had really overthrown feudalism. It was part of this new political crisis that the National Assembly was itself out of touch with public opinion, and despite its recent election had slender claim to represent the nation as a whole. The Estates-General was traditionally composed of three assemblies representing the three Estates. The King had decided that the Third Estate should have about 600 deputies out of a total of 1,155, but he had not decided the crucial 29\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE issue whether voting was to be by head in one single assembly, or by each Estate casting its vote in three separate assemblies. Having decided that the Third Estate should have more representatives than the nobility and clergy together, if he had also decreed that they should be able to use this numerical superiority within one large assembly, he would have ended the political powers of feudalism by his own decision and so kept initiative and leadership. His indecision left it open for the Third Estate to usurp, by jts own defiant action, the status of a truly national assembly, and then, after the adhesion of sections of pobility and clergy, to enforce the principle of voting by heads. Th,is happened, after considerable confusion and exacerbation, on June 20, when the representatives of the Third Estate took an oath, in’ the rain and on the royal tennis court, not to disperse until the constitution of the realm had been firmly established. This act of political usurpation marked the first important stage in the downfall of the absolute monarchy. The National Assembly also decreed that taxes should continue to be paid only so long as it remained in session, and it took the further logical step of declaring parliamentary privilege. It decreed that the person of each deputy was inviolable. It refused to disperse when the King ordered it to do so. Thus challenged, the King gave way as he had often given way in the past. They want to stay?’ he asked peevishly, ’then let them stay.’ Joined by most of the representatives of the nobility and clergy, the Third Estate henceforth existed as a National Assembly, with the self-imposed task of issuing a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and of protecting the liberty of the nation against the Crown and its ministers. The King, for the first time, found himself on the opposite side from the representatives of the nation. He never succeeded in rejoining them or in reasserting his initiative in reform. Henceforth, if the monarchy was not doomed, at least its existing difficulties were very greatly enhanced. Its political assets were squandered as wastefully as its financial. Henceforth, too, the constitutional movement became more and more doctrinaire, reflecting the extent to which the lawyers, businessmen, and journalists had imbibed the notions of the philosophes. The first consequence was the ’Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen’, which the Assembly, after lengthy debate, adopted on August 26. It had echoes of the American Declaration of Independence, and asserted that ’men are born and remain free and equal in ^’~hts’. that ’the’aim’of all political association is to preserve the natural and imprescriptible rights of man’, and that ’these rights are liberty, property, security, a’n’d resistance to oppression’. The famous declaration. Which has remained of considerable importance and as recently as 1946 was ”• . .’• 30 I THE CRISIS OF 1789 I • ’\n\n’reaffirmed’ in the preamble to the Constitution of the Fourth French Republic, was adequately described by its full title.\n\nIt was. first, a Declaration - a manifesto and a statement of the general principles on which the National Assembfy hoped to reform the French system of government. It was, secondly, a Declaration of Rights - not a Declaration of Duties. It was an assertion of the new claims and a statement of the political, constitutional, and social rights that its framers held to be essential for making a better regime,. It was. thirdly, a Declaration of the Rights of Man - a statement intended to have universal application and which certainly had very far-\n\nreaching implications. It was drawn up not for France alone, but for the benefit of men everywhere who wanted to be free and to rid themselves of comparable ’. burdens of absolutist monarchy and feudal privilege. This universalism •• of the original French Revolution was to be of great importance. It was, •f finally and fully, a Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, •\\ and although the last three words of its title are often omitted they are * among its most important. It was careful to specify those civic rights i that most concretely expressed the immediate aims of the middle classes ; which now predominated in the Assembly: equality of all before the i Jaw, eligibility of all citizens for all public offices, personal freedom from ; arbitrary arrest or punishment, freedom of speech and the press, and ? above all an equitable distribution of the burdens of national taxation Sand the inviolability of private property. These claims it founded on |the two general doctrines that ’the principle of all sovereignty rests jessentially in the nation’, and that ’law is the expression of the general |wiir. These doctrines intended to be universal in application - would iclearly, if accepted, destroy the very foundation of the old order of Society and disrupt the state everywhere in Europe. This was the innererit challenge of events in France to every one of her neighbours, including Britain. One French historian has called the Declaration ’the death certificate of the old regime’. It certainly remained a charter of liberalism throughout the nineteenth century. Even so, the Declaration is less abstract and more realistic than it might appear at first. Its omissions, as a manifesto of liberalism, are significant. It made no mention of freedom of economic enterprise or of trade, so dear to its bourgeois makers, because the old order had already in recent years suppressed the guilds and removed controls on the grain trade; it said nothing of rights of assembly and association, nor of education or social security, although many were aware of how important these were, for these matters were less relevant to the immediate tasks °f destroying the old regime. Although it tried to be universal, it did not set out to be comprehensive. It deliberately omitted any Declaration\n\nI\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE of Duties, an omission not remedied until 1795. Its most liberal principles were stated cautiously. Exercise of natural rights is limited by the need to assure enjoyment of the same rights for others. ’Law may rightfully prohibit only those actions that are injurious to society.’ Freedom of opinion is limited by the proviso that it must not trouble public order as established by law, and that it must not be abused. Even the sanctity of property is subject to an ’obvious requirement of public necessity’. The Declaration was not, moreover, a manifesto of democracy. Even the Americans had not yet instituted universal suffrage, and the French contented themselves with stating that ’all citizens have the right to take part, in person or by their representatives’, in forming the law and in voting taxes. That they intended neither universal suffrage nor direct democracy became clear before the end of 1789, when a constitution was drawn up by the Assembly. This made a distinction between ’active’ and ’passive’ citizens and withheld the vote from the latter, defined as those who did not pay taxes equal in value to three days’ wages; it set up a purely representative and parliamentary system of government, based less on Rousseau’s ideas of popular sovereignty than on Montesquieu’s theory of a ’separation of powers’. If the Revolution became the great source of democratic revolutions, that quality was derived from subsequent events, and was not present in either the intentions or the actions of the original revolutionaries. The most revolutionary doctrine included in the Declaration had also been included in the American Declaration of Independence: the right of resistance to oppression. The Assembly intended, by including it, to justify its own defence of the king and to legitimize the insurrection of 14 July, when the Paris mob had captured the grim old fortress of the Bastille, which symbolized arbitrary power. Paris had then organized, under the liberal noble Lafayette, a new civic or ’National Guard’ to protect both public order and the Assembly. In October the principle of resistance had again to be invoked, to overcome the obstacle of the king’s right to veto all legislation. In the ’October Days’ the ultimate revolutionary sanction of popular violence was decisive. On 5 October some six or seven thousand of the women of Paris marched in the rain to Versailles to clamour for bread and to fetch the King to Paris. After the usual vacillation and muddle, they got their way, and on the afternoon of the following day, in the mud and rain, a strange procession moved into Paris from the palace of the kings. Headed by men of the National Guard with wagons full of wheat and flour, and accompanied by cheering women, the procession included a carriage in which rode the King and his family, with the Marquis de Lafayette,!! 32 I THE ROOTS OF WAR\n\nthe revolutionary hero of two continents, riding beside it. It also included carriages bearing a hundred deputies chosen to represent the Assembly. The crowd rejoiced that they were bringing to the capital ’the baker, the baker’s wife, and the baker’s boy’. That night the royal family was housed in the Tuileries, a palace it had deserted for more than a century. Not only had the King, confronted with threats, agreed to ratify the Assembly’s decrees; but now, a. ’virtual prisoner of the Paris mob, he could be a constitutional\n\nmonarch only under obvious compulsion. He had forfeited any hope of appearing to lead the revolution, as well as any material chance of resisting it THE ROOTS OF WAR\n\nDuring the year 1790 two factors, above all others, made still worse, the now precarious position of the monarchy. One was the bitter conflict caused by the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and its attempt to make the Church a department of state; the other was the influence of the emigres, the growing tide of exiles who fled from France and incited foreign governments to take up arms against the revolution. The religious schism and the issues of foreign relations combined . to effect a transition from revolution to war. This ultimately made the French Revolution an event not only in French but in European history. Strangely enough, the first negative changes in the position of the Church met with little resistance. On 4 August 1789 the Galilean Church voluntarily gave up its corporate status and its rights to tax and to administer itself; and in February 1790, certain religious orders were abolished with the consent of the higher clergy in the Assembly. Schemes to abolish ecclesiastical tithes and to alienate ecclesiastical land were alike accepted without great resistance. It was the more positive changes of 1790 which aroused fierce opposition. They were not an attempt to separate Church from state, but the contrary - to subordinate the organization of the Church to the dictates of the state, and to fill all ecclesiastical offices by popular election. The French Church was tc be separated from the Papacy and its clergy were to become paid officials of the state. These changes were sanctioned by the King and promulgated on 24 August. They aroused enough opposition within the Church for the Assembly to impose on all office-holding clergy an oath that they would uphold the new constitution of the Church. Half of the lower clergy and all but seven of the bishops refused to take this oath, and in March and April 1791, the Pope condemned the Civil Constitution and other political reforms of the Revolution. Henceforth 33\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE the Church fell into rival and irreconcilable factions. In May relations were broken off between France and the Holy See. In addition, by the end of 1790 there were already arrayed against the Revolution strong and influential counter-revolutionary forces at Brussels, Coblenz, and Turin. In 1791 an emigre army was farmed in the Rhineland. The Comte .d’Artois established headquarters at Coblenz, and emigre agents roamed France persuading other members of emigre families to join their relatives in exile and prepare for the ’liberation’ of France. The impact of this whole movement upon the position of the monarchy became apparent with the fiasco of the King’s flight to Varennes in June 1791. Louis had abandoned his original hopes that he could ride the storm at home, his scruples of conscience about having sanctioned the Civil Constitution of the Clergy had deepened, and the Queen urged that only foreign intervention could now restore his power. Foreign intervention could hardly be expected until the King broke with the Revolution and openly joined the counter-revolution. He was at last, by the spring of 1791, persuaded that he must leave the country. Late on the night of 20 June, disguised as a valet and a governess, Louis and Marie Antoinette escaped from Paris ,on a planr.ed flight to the stronghold of Montme”dy near the Luxembourg frontier. The journey was a whole chapter of miscalculations and accidents. The fugitives were J recognized and stopped at Varennes, and were brought back to Paris amid ominously silent crowds. Placed under virtual imprisonment, the royal family could now be regarded as little more than potential traitors to the nation, prepared to join foreign armies and exiles against the cause of the Revolution. There followed a wholesale desertion of royal army officers. The Girondins within the Assembly, a group increasingly favouring war, gained greatly in strength. The enemies of the Revolution could now be depicted as the enemies of France. The Legislative Assembly, in October 1791, under the new constitution, replaced the old National Assembly. In January 1792, it de- . creed that the Habsburg Emperor of Austria, Leopold II, should be invited to declare whether or not he would renounce every treaty directed against the sovereignty, independence, and safety of the French nation; a fortnight later it ordered the. property of’the emigres to be sequestrated. This was an ultimatum to both Europe and the emigres. Leopold, himself embarrassed in diplomatic relations with Catherine II of Russia, was ready to be conciliatory. But he died on 1 March. His son Francis II, who succeeded him, was a less intelligent man and more dominated by militarist and absolutist advisers. When he rejected the French ultimatum, the Legislative Assembly on 20 April 1792 declared war 34 THE ROOTS OF WAR ’in rightful defence of a free people against the unjust aggression of a king’. At once the army of King Frederick William, in accordance with the Prussian alliance with Austria, prepared for active service. Austria and Prussia were joined by Victor Amadeus of Savoy, king 01 Piedmont. Catherine of Russia, busily engaged in gaining Polish territory, held aloof for the time, as did the British government. Tne initial\n\nconflict was between the revolutionary armies of France and a league of three neighbouring monarchs supported by an army of French exiles. From the spring of 1792 until the rise of Napoleon the consequences of war and of revolution became inextricably mixed. The immediate causes of the war included the intrigues of the court and the emigres, the war clamour of the Girondins in the Assembly, the aggressive selfconfidence of the revolutionaries, the discredit of the King, and the diplomacy of Prussia. But its basic cause lay deeper. It was, in more modern terms, the issue of whether two forms of society based on totally different principles could peacefully coexist. France within her own territories had ended feudalism, destroyed the pretensions of royal absolutism, and founded new institutions on the principles of sovereignty of the people and personal liberty and equality. The old institutions, which had been overthrown in France, remained established in her continental neighbours. The influence of,the Revolution was spreading, undermining the position of other rulers and implicitly challenging the survival of serfdom, feudalism, and absolutism everywhere. The revolutionary ideals wer.e too dynamic to be ignored by the established order. The result was the First Coab’tion of 1793, comprising Austria, Prussia, Britain, the Netherlands, and Spain. This inexorable conflict became apparent in the rival manifestos issued by each side. In August 1791 the Austrian and Prussian rulers issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, expressing the hope that there would be consultation between the powers about the position of Louis XVI, and hinting at joint armed intervention in the cautiously worded suggestion to employ, in certain conditions, ’efficacious means for enabling the King of France full freedom to set up a monarchical government in conformity with his rights and the welfare of the nation’. This aroused violent resentment in France. Nearly a year later, and after war had begun, the Duke of Brunswick as commanderin-chief of the ”AustroPrussian forces issued from Coblenz his famous manifesto, declaring categorically that his armies were intervening in France to suppress anarchy and to restore the king’s lawful authority. By threatening that the lives of the deputies and Paris administrators would be held forfeit for whatever harm might befall the royal family, he ensured that the 35\n\nREVOLUTION IN FRANCE\n\nrevolutionaries would resist to the death. The Brunswick manifesto of 27 July had its sequel in the revolutionary manifesto of November 1792, in which the French, in the first flush of early victories against Prussia and Austria, offered ’fraternity and assistance’ to all peoples wishing, like the French, to assert their liberty. In December the Assembly served notice on Europe that France would enforce revolutionary social principles everywhere. Occupation of any territory by French armies, they declared, would be accompanied by the ending of feudal obligations and the confiscation of clerical and aristocratic property. The ideological conflict became clear. It was a clash between the old order and the new. now locked in a struggle to the death for the whole of Europe. So, at least, it seemed’to men in the winter of 1792. The loudest trumpet call to conservatism had come in 1790 from the Irishman. Edmund Burke, whose violently eloquent Reflections on the Revolution in France provided all enemies of the Revolution with a counter-revolutionary philosophy; here was one of the most persuasive expositions of traditionalism ever penned, predicting anarchy and dicta-. torship as the outcome of such revolution. The revolution in France had become war in Europe: not an old-fashioned, familiar kind of war between monarchs for territory, but a newer ideological war between peoples and kings for the ending of old institutions and the fulfilment of dreams of a new society. In short, war in Europe now meant revolu-, tion in Europe. . , i 36 CHAPTER 2\n\nFRANCE AT WAR THE JACOBIN TERROR\n\nFROM the spring of 1792 onward, France sustained revolution and war at the same time. The consequences for France were momentous. They were, in brief, the overthrow of the monarchy, the dictatorship of Robespierre, the Reign of Terror, and the rise to power of General Bonaparte. For Europe, tod, the consequences were far-reaching. The first casualty of the war was the French monarchy. The newly elected assembly known as the Convention ’ met on 21 September 1792, the day after the battle of Valmy in which the revolutionary armies led by Genera-Is Dumouriez and Kellermann routed the Prussians. The following day it abolished the monarchy and decreed that the first year of the Republic should date from 22 September.2 After the further victory of Jemappes on 6 November, as a result of which the French occupied Brussels, the new Republic gained in self-confidence and decided upon the trial of the Kiug. He was executed on 21 January 1793. This act, added to a series of other\n\ntensions between France and Britain, led to declaration of war against Britain and Holland at the beginning of February, against Spain in March, and against Hungary in April. This rapid extension of the war to most of Europe outside Scandinavia was soon accompanied by French reverses. A revolt broke out in the western region of the Vendee in March; Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and the French were driven out of Holland in the same month. On 6 April the desertion of Dumouriez to the Austrians created a state of siege and emergency in France. These events had great repercussions on the course of the revolution in France because they brought to an end the power of the Girondins. As the war party they were discredited by the reverses. Their 1. See p. 39. 2.

In Maximilien Robespierre the Jacobins found a leader of genius and extraordinary fixity of purpose, whose ruthiessness and fanaticism enabled him to dominate the Convention. From July 1793. when he first became a member of its Committee of Public Safety until July 1794, when he died on the guillotine. Robespierre was virtually dictator of France. The revolution, on the defensive, sought salvation in personal tyranny - in the first perhaps, of all the single-party dictatorships of|;! the modern world. |:. Of all the great French revolutionary personalities,.Robespierre re-- mains somehow the most memorable and the most symbolic: more than Mirabeau. who was a better orator and a greater statesman; more than Lafayette, whose statecraft failed to measure up to his’inflated reputation; more even than Danton, an infinitely more attractive figure and the generous inspiration of national resistance to invasion and reaction. It is strange that so tumultuous and heroic an event as the French Revolution should remain personified in the slight, bespectacled, snd unglamorous figure of this fastidious little provincial attorney. Is it that he in some sense represented the precise mixture of social and ideological impulses which triumphed in the Revolution? Socially, he was the archetype of the provincial lawyer who predominated in the revolutionary assemblies, the feline party intriguer and critic, fluent in the idealistic phrases that so constantly rang through those inexperienced parliamentary bodies. He was the little man of humble origins made great by the upheaval of revolution. In purpose and principle he stood for all that Jaeobinism stands for in modern history: a doctrinaire idealism, exalting the principle of the sovereignty of the people, the liberty, equality, and fraternity of all men, the national republic ’one and-indivisible’. In his own experience and career he personified the Jacobin revolutionary impulses. To examine the anatomy of his dictatorship is to reveal the shape of things to come. It set the pattern for further revolutionary activity throughout most of Europe in the century that followed. The cell of revolution remained the club and the secret society, centring on Paris but frequently with provincial branches and committees throughout France. The pattern was, above all, the Jacobin Club of the ’Society of Friends of the Constitution’ where, from the Revolution’s earliest days, the respectable bourgeoisie of Paris listened intently to Robespierre’s sententious moralizings. By its role in exerting pressure upon the elected national assemblies, its capacity to mobilize opinion and discontent in 3.8 THE JACOBIN TERROR the provinces, its propensity to fall into the hands of the most extremist and ruthless leaders, it eventually triumphed over its many rivals. By the end of 1790 it had 1,100 members, mostly of the middle class, and when the monarchy fell the Jacobin Club had more than a thousand local societies affiliated with it. It remained the only real and effective political organization in France as a whole. It offered,the perfect milieu for the full exercise of Robespierre’s talents for iritrfgue, manoeuvre, and persuasion. The second medium of revolution was the Commune, and here too Paris was the hub. Municipal and local organizations existed for many purposes, mainly administrative and military. In June 1789 the-407 delegates of the several quarters of Paris who had\n\nelected deputies to the Estates-General set themselves up at the Hotel de Ville as an unofficial municipal government. In other towns local risings led to the formation of similar municipal bodies. By December 1789 local communal councils had been set up in all towns and villages. Local revolutionary surveillance committees often came into existence. The National Guard, instituted at the time of the fall of the Bastille and with mainly middleclass recruitment, was also organized in local sections with regional federations. This mass of local bodies tended to fuse, together into local insurrectionary organizations, and most significantly in Paris. In August 1792, with recruits’flowing into Paris on their way to the frontiers, and amid fierce discontent in all the working-class quarters of the capital, the populace broke into open revolution against the Legislative Assembly. They stormed the Tuileries,” imprisoned the King and royal family, and demanded the election, by universal male suffrage, of a new National Convention. They also set up a revolutionary municipal government or ’Commune’ in Paris. Robespierre was elected to it on 11 August and for a fortnight attended its meetings. This body, supported by the extreme Jacobins, remained a rival authority in the capital to the national representative assembly, and exerted constant pressure on it for ever more violent and extreme measures. This was the second great medium of Robespierre’s power, to be revived in even more violent form in 1871.’ A third was the single-chamber assembly of the National Convention. It was elected on universal male suffrage in the crisis of the fall of 1792 in response to the demands of the Jacobins and the Commune. With the monarchy overthrown, executive power fell into the hands of committee^ of the Convention. This arrangement .lent itself admirably to the machinations of the Jacobins and the special talents of Robespierre. The two most important committees were the. Committee of Public Safety, 1. See p. 395. 39\n\nFRANCE AT WAR 4«.\n\nfirst created in April 1793. and the Committee of General Security. The former was subject to monthly re-election by the Convention and was entrusted with wide discretionary powers of government. The latter was especially’concerned with police functions, and from September 1793 onward its members were chosen by the Committee of Public Safety. Robespierre joined the Committee of Public Safety in July, after the exclusion of Danton, whose heroic efforts to stem the tide of French defeats had plai’nly failed. The immense powers of both committees were virtually at the disposal of Robespierre and his two closest colleagues, Louis de ’ Saint-Just and Georges Couthon. From August 1?92 there had also existed.in Paris a special court known’as the Revolutionary Tribunal. Set up originally to try political offenders, it became a convenient means by which the government could bypass the regular courts. Such was the constitutional basis of Robespierre’s ’revolutionary dictatorship’, claiming justification in the desperate internal and external condition of France and determined to suppress all resistance by rigorous terrorism. In the frenzy of the time all resistance could be denounced as treason or counter-revolution and punished with the guillotine. This situation also chimed well with the personality of Robespierre, who had a mystical .faith in the need for a ’Republic of Virtue’. The word ’Virtue’ had echoes of both Machiavelli and Montesquieu, for whom it meant a civic spirit of unselfishness and dutiful self-sacrifice, as well as of Rousseau, who had added to it a more sentimental flavour of personal purity, and incorruptibility. Robespierre’s dream was of a democracy of loyal citizens and honest men, and he treated it as his personal mission to inaugurate a new democratic religion. In June 1794 he presided over the first festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being, having a month before issued a decree organizing the cult. The second and third articles of that decree were the most significant; they recognized ’that the proper worship of the Supreme Being consists in the practice of human duties’, and that ’the most important of these duties are to hate treachery and tyranny, to punish tyrants and traitors, to succour the unfortunate, respect the weak, and defend the oppressed, to do all the good one can to one’s neighbour, and to treat no one unjustly’. It was a revolutionary Declaration of the Duties of Man and of the Citizen, a belated but necessary sequel to the Declaration of Rights. It was a sign that the main surge . of revolution had run its course; and a month later Robespierre himself fell victim to the guillotine, when his own oppressive tyranny had become at lasc intolerable. With him died his colleagues Saint-Just and Couthon. The Jacobin Club, the Commune, and the Committees of the Convention were, in these ways, the three Institutional bases of Robespierre’s revolutionary dictatorship. Yet his strange power remains only partially 40 ’THE JACOBIN TERROR\n\nexplained unless there is added to these the atmosphere of restless insecurity and anxiety, the wider elements of revolutionary fervour and patriotic enthusiasm, the constant blackmailing power,of the excited and ferocious Paris mob, which compelled every political leader to outbid his colleagues in denouncing treachery and giving proof of his own unsullied purpose. The Reign of Terror became possible because of the overthrow of all familiar established forms of government and the double menace of counterrevolution at home and invasion from abroad. That it went so far and lasted so long was due to other causes; above all, to the power of enrages and sansculottes, the bras-nus and the canaille ’ in short of proletarian violence and of criminal extremism exploiting the excitement and savagery of the urban mob. The Terror was directed not just against recalcitrant nobility and clergy or treacherous bourgeoisie, but even more against the mass of ordinary French men and women who were unfortunate enough to fall victim to the twists and turns of party strife. Many were denounced because the chief anxiety was to save yourself by condemning others. The Terror was not an instrument of class war, and 70 per cent of its victims belonged to the peasantry and labouring classes, mostly in rebelb’on against the state. The Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris condemned to death 2,639 people; revolutionary courts condemned in all about 17,000. The rest of the Terror’s 40,000 victims mostly died in summary mass executions in places such as the Vendee and Lyon where there was open rebellion against the Convention. Atrocious though jt was, by the test of atrocities committed by more modern dictatorships the Terror was mild”and relatively discriminating. The social incidence of the Terror was matched by the social incidence of the emigration. Over the whole decade 1789-99, the number of boiirgeois, peasant, and working-class refugees outnumbered noble and clerical emigres by about two to one. It was’in 1793. during the Reign of Terror, that the emigration included mainly the unprivileged, and became broadly representative of the whole nation. The Revolution was devouring its own children, and both by execution and exile it was increasingly alienating large sections of the population. What gave it this terrifying destructive power was the perpetuation of the war. The ultimate excuse for the Terror was the identification of enemies of the nation with enemies of the Republic, an equation that the emigration and the internal rebellions alike helped to strengthen. The revolutionary dictatorship rested on revolutionary war. Whether it was the Revolution which attacked Europe, or Europe 1. These slang terms meant, respectively, the ’wild men’ or repufilican extremists; the ’common people’ or poor; those ’with bare arms’ or the working classes; aii|d ’the rabble’ or mob. E.S.N.-3\n\n41\n\n..FRANCE AT WAR\n\nwhich attacked the Revolution, is a question almost impossible and certainly unprofitable to answer.-As already suggested, there was an inexorable conflict between the two, and once war had begun, for whatjever reason or excuse, the conflict was likely to continue until it burned itself out on the field of battle. The impact of war on the internal reconstruction of France was immense. The converse was equally true. The levee en masse or universal conscription for military service, introduced by the Committee of Public Safety in August 1793 on the advice of Lazare Carnot, revolutionized modern warfare. It did not at once mean the mobilization of everyone, which would have simply disorganized the country. At first only bachelors and childless widowers between the ages of 18 and 25 were called up. But the measures estabished a novel and far-reaching principle: that in time of emergency the state has the right to command the services of all its citizens. It enabled France .to’put into the field of battle massive formations, organized’and equipped by the genius of Carnot, against which the older professional royal armies proved outmoded. The system, perpetuated by the Directory ’ in its Law of Conscription of September 1798, laid a firm foundation for the military dictatorship ’of Napoleon. Of necessity imitated by other countries, the system led eventually ’to the modern citizen-army, and helped to turn war from a battle between armies into a conflict between whole nations. Combined with .the doctrines’of democracy which prevailed in 1793, it led also to a programme of internal reforms which was full of significance for the future. If persons and services can be conscripted, so can property; and if all must make sacrifices, it is the duty of the state to provide for the needs and welfare of those whose services it commands. The relation between government and governed, between state and society, became an infinitely more reciprocal and intimate relationship than had ever existed under absolutist monarchies. The revolutionary dictatorship undertook to control prices and wages, to organize the distribution of supplies, to regulate currency and trade, to encourage improvements in agriculture, to provide better technical education, to assist the poor, even to abolish slavery in the French colonies. Paternalistic monarchies, too, had done most of these things; but now they were done in the name of democracy, through an assembly of the nation’s democratically elected representatives, and in a’mood of excited enthusiasm for popular welfare. This connexion between necessities of warfare and the development of welfare was to remain constant throughout subsequent European history. In August 1793 the main justification for the Terror was that there were five enemy armies on French soil, and Paris had to be organized 1. See p. 44. 42 THE DIRECTORY\n\nlike a beleaguered citadel. By the spring of 1794 the tide had turned. The revolt in the Vendee had been broken; the British had been repelled at sea;\n\nthe Prussian and Austrian forces had been held and then pushed back out of Alsace and forced over the Rhine: in May the Ardennes and western Flanders were reoccupied, and by J.une all Belgium was again in French occupation. These successes were.’in one sense, a measure of how far the Terror had succeeded in its nationally defensible purpose. That the Terror not only continued but greatly intensified during the summer, until the execution of Robespierre, was due mainly to its own impetus - the inability of extremists to drop their habitual demands when there was personal peril in relaxing their grip on power. In June and July the guillotine claimed 1,285 victims. Some pretext for strenuous and harsh ^government could still be found in the deplorable economic conditions of the country. War on the rich (especially the new rich of profiteers and speculators) for the benefit of the poor could be indefinitely continued, the redistribution of property by confiscation and taxation which Robespierre had proclaimed was certainly not yet completed, and the laws of the Maximum, which attempted to control inflation by setting maximum prices, were undoubtedly widely evaded. But France could not support Terror for such ends alone. It had outlived its usefulness. After, the death of Robespierre on 28 July 1794 some 8*0,000 prisoners were immediately released, and soon all arrests made before his fall were cancelled. Nearly 90 members of the Commune shared Robespierre’s fate. THE DIRECTORY\n\nBut if the ’Red Terror’ was over, the ’White Terror’ of reaction was just beginning. The Convention sat until October 1795, reorganized its committees and readmitted surviving Girondins to positions of power. These last fourteen months of die Convention are known as the Thermidorian reaction (because in the new revolutionary calendar it was on 9th Thermidor that Robespierre was overthrown). It was significantly not a royalist reaction. The forms of revolutionary government went on just as the war went on. But it was a swing back toward moderate Jacobinism, a revulsion against the final excesses of the Terror, a liquidation of party feuds and hatreds. Only in May 1795 was the Revolutionary Tribunal abolished, though its most despotic powers and procedures were taken away .from it earlier. The Convention gave up attempts to enforce the laws of the Maximum, and some of the emigres began to find their way back into France. Abandoning the draft constitutions of both the Girondins and the Jacobins, the Convention now drew up a third, which betrayed not only fear of the executive but also 41\n\nFRANCE AT WAR\n\nfear of the mob. It began with a declaration of duties as well as of rights. This Constitution came into operation in October 1795, and lasted untU November 1799. The Directory of five, which held executive power under this new Constitution, was ill-fated from birth. The men who successfully became Directors were, except for the patriotic organizing genius of Carnot, disreputable and self-seeking politicians of little ability. The corrupt leaders of a period when the moral standards of social and political life were at exceptionally low ebb, they presided over the final liquidation of the Revolution. The new ruling class which backed the measures of the Directory, as of the latter-day Convention, included businessmen and financial speculators, army contractors and- landowning peasants all those middleclass elements that had profited most from the revolution and the war. These new rich, vulgar in taste and unscrupulous in habits, wanted above all to consolidate and increase their gains. Opposed equally to royalist reaction and to further mob violence, their aims were a constitutional parliamentary system on a narrow social basis, moderate in action and so devised as to prevent personal dictatorship. They succeeded in preventing a repetition of Robespierre’s revolutionary dictatorship only at the price of producing Napoleon’s military dictatorship. Explanation of how this came about lies in their success in crushing re*’bellion at home and their failure to produce victory abroad. At home the Directory more and more openly reh’ed upon the army to defend it against revolt. The Convention had already, in 1795, destroyed the main instruments of revolutionary action when it closed the Jacobin Club, ended the Commune and executed the Communards, reorganized its own committees, and abolished the Revolutionary Tribunal. The Convention had also set the example of relying upon troops to crush insurrection. By the springer’ 1795 the severe winter, dislocation of trade, and increase in social distress bred a series of revolts. In April when Parisians rioted and demanded ’bread and the Constitution of 1793’, troops under General Pichegru promptly crushed them. In May, when insurgents led by Jacobin rebels occupied the hall of the Convention, regular troops under Murat and Menou drove them out. Barricades hastily erected in the working-class districts were easily demolished. The National Guard, traditional ally of revolutionaries, was reorganized into a truly middle-class body. Again in October, when the Paris mob made one final effort to assert itself against the representatives o; the nation, the Convention called to its defence the troops of General Barras. His subordinate was young Napoleon Bonaparte, whose reward for his services was command of the home army. The Directory readily enough followed these examples, and was mainly a mere continuation of the THE DIRECTORY\n\nThermidorian reaction under the Convention. With an army of more than 800,000 men - the largest ever raised until then by one European power ’ - it felt able to make up for its lack of popularity by frequent use of armed force.\n\nThe last episode of the French Revolution was not the fall of Robespierre but the strange and extravagant episode known as the Babeuf Plot of 1796. In October 1795, in resistance tp the new Constitution of the Directory devised by the Convention to embody and perpetuate the power of the new rich, a political club was formed called the Society of the Pantheon. It attracted many former Jacobins and held meetings in a crypt by torchlight. It circulated its own paper, the Tribun, edited by Franfois-Noal Babeuf, an embittered and fanatical young agitator. While it was hesitating between remaining a political debating society and becoming an active conspiracy, it was attacked by the Directory, which in February 1796 sent General Bonaparte in person to close the meeting place and dissolve the society. The more extremist members, - led by Babeuf and Sylvain Mare”chal, retaliated by setting up an insurrectionary committee or ’Secret Directory’ of six. and preparing revolt. It was to be the final battle for the forgotten revolutionary ideal of equality - the ideal most blatantly derided by the existing conditions of inflation, distress, and corruption. The Babouvists proposed to revive the Jacobin Constitution of 1793, which had been approved but never implemented, in place of the new Constitution of 1795; to restore the revolutionary movement to its original purity of idealism and sincerity of purpose; and to proclaim a ’Republic of Equals’, in which a communistic organization of society would abolish the growing gulf between rich and poor. Revolutionary agents, under the direction of the central committee, were to penetrate units of army, police, and administration. This was the last important attempt to win back the army to the cause of revolution. Preparations for insurrection were remarkably thorough, arms and ammunition were stored, and on the given signal citizens from each district of Paris, to the summons of tocsin and trumpet, were to march behind banners to support the mutineers of the army. Public buildings and bakeries were to be 1. In the eighteenth century it had been Prussia, not France, that had set the example of large standing armies. Although in 1789 the population ,of Prussia was only one third that of France, she could raise jr. time of war an army of 250,000. France in 1789 could muster 211,000, or 287,000 if the militia, included at war strength, were added. But the Directory’s Law of Conscription of 1798 was the first to introduce the principle that the regular army, as distinct from the militia, should be recruited by systematic national conscription. Though it worked badly and- ineffectively, it was later turned to full use by Bonaparte, and through him it affected all Europe. ’ 45\n\nFRANCE AT WAR\n\nseized. The Secret Directory would exercise power until completely democratic elections for a new national assembly could be held. But the police had spies within the movement from the start; on the eve of the insurrection its leaders were arrested or dispersed by loyal troops, and the plot came to nothing. The days when a coup d’etat based on the Paris mob could dictate to France were over for a time, and the strategy of the conspirators already had a somewhat old-fashioned air. Yet the event became of considerable historical importance because of the mythical and legendary character it acquired. The trial of the plotters, staged in 1797 before a special court and intended to frighten waverers into support of the Directory, lasted for three months and became a platform for expounding the Babouvist ideals. Babeuf made it the occasion for an indictment of the existing regime as well as of the ^ocial order, and the Directory rested on so little public loyalty that he ’hit it just where it was most vulnerable. The execution of Babeuf after his attempted suicide made him the last famous martyr of the White Terror. Through the propagandist work of his colleague, Philippe Buonarroti, the Babeuf Plot became a heroic repubb’can legend among the most active revolutionaries of nineteenthcentury Paris. Babeuf won renown by bis passionate sincerity. The insurrectionary techniques and inner organization of the Plot were exhaustively studied, imitated, and elaborated. Modern Communism also claims some affinities with the ideals of Babeuf. Perhaps he has acquired greater renown than he deserved, or than the importance of the Plot in 1796 merited. But in revolutions legends are powerful and ghosts can walk.1 In foreign affairs, too, the army assumed an ever greater role. By the beginning of 1796 France’s only active enemies on land were Austria and Sardinia, and at sea Great Britain. The Convention had made peace with Holland, Spain, and Prussia. By incorporating the former Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) into France in October, it was committed to continuing the war against Austria, which would not accept this loss; while British refusal to make peace, even after the breakup of the First Coalition, kept active the war at sea. Peace had also been made with Portugal, with the German states of Saxony and the two Hesses, with the Italian states of Naples, Parma, and the Papacy. By the beginning of 1796 the Directory was able to concentrate all its efforts on the war against Austria. On the last day of 1795 Pichegru had signed an armistice with the Austrians on the Rhine front. Using this respite, the Directory planned to send its main armies against Vienna, under the leadership of Moreau and Jourdan, by way of the Black Forest and the Danube. This was to 1. See pp. 144 and 196.\n\n46 THE DIRECTORY\n\nbe the decisive frontal attack. To aid it.,another army was to create a , diversion against Austrian power in Italy. This army was put in the charge of General Bonaparte. By the Battle of Mondovi he defeated the Sardinians and forced them to make an armistice by which they ceded - Nice and Savoy to France. Marching on, Bonaparte’s afmy defeated the Austrians at Lodi on 10 May (the very day when the Babeuf Plot was suppressed) and took Milan, where he was greeted as a liberator from Austrian rule. By January 1797 he had succeeded, after a long’struggle, in taking the central Austrian stronghold of Mantua, and in routing an Austrian army of some 70.000 at the Battle of Rivoli. Pressing north-eastward to Laibach, he forced the Austrians to make an armistice in April. Peace was delayed for six months because the main French armies in Austria had made much less decisive progress: but when Bonaparte pressed on even to the Danube, Austria signed the peace of Campo Formio on 17 October 1797. She thereby abandoned Belgium to France and recognized its annexation; recognized the new French creation of a Cisalpine Republic in northern Italy; surrendered the Ionian Islands off Greece; but kept Venice and all her territory-in Italy and the Adriatic. Under secret articles the bargain went further. The Austrian Emperor promised to cede to France large districts of the Rhineland, and in return was promised part of Bavaria, the ecclesiastical state of Salzburg, and the exclusion of his rival, Prussia, from any territorial gains. It was a settlement as characteristic of sly Napoleonic diplomacy as the campaign had been of Napoleonic generalship. Only Britain now remained at war with France. (See Map 1.) At home the Directory faced its first political crisis with the elections of 1797, which it was expected would result in an anti-Jacobin majority. Only 13 out of the 216 retiring members of the elected councils were returned: a clear enough protest against the failure of the government to restore French credit and currency or to alleviate the widespread social distress. In September 1797 the Directory forestalled the action of the new hostile and mainly royalist majority. With the help of Bonaparte it expelled the newly elected members from the assemblies. By this coup d’etat of Fructidor the Directors forfeited their last shreds of legality, and henceforth relied more openly on armed force. Bonaparte’s’ own seizure of power was brought one step nearer. In the further elections of May 1798 nearly all moderates abstained from voting, with the result that the extremists held the field and the Directory resorted to the further coup d’etat of Floreal, in which it annulled 98 elections. The political system was as bankrupt as the treasury. The elections of May 1799 could not be suppressed with equal impunity, and they brought into the legislative assemblies all the Directory’s most active opponents. Of the 47\n\nFRANCE AT WAR\n\nfive Directors, Barras and Sieyes were resolved to resort to the ultimate sanction: open a’lliance with Bonaparte, the most popular personality in France, with a victorious army at his command. ” Bonaparte in 1798 had departed on an expedition to Egypt designed to cut off the British from India and their other eastern possessions. He had captured the island of Malta in June, occupied Alexandria in July, and marched against Syria. Then he suffered reverses. His fleet was destroyed by Nelson at Aboukir Bay in the Battle of the Nile (August 1798). Plague broke out among his troops. By May 1799 he withdrew to Egypt with heavy losses. The campaign produced, too, a second coalition against France, which included Turkey and Russia as well as’ jjj Britain. Bonaparte sailed from Alexandria in August 1799, evaded the fj watching British fleet, and reached France in October. Despite his -losses || and reverses he was the only man in France who enjoyed general confidence, and in the new conditions of emergency it was to him that men turned. On 9 November (18th Brumaire) in conspiracy with Barras and Sieyes, Napoleon carried out the projected coup d’etat that brought him to political power. It did not go according to plan. He had hoped that the assemblies, over one of which his own brother, Lucien Bonaparte, presided, could be persuaded to move from Paris to Saint-Cloud, to entrust him with command of the troops in Paris, and then to vote for constitutional revision under his direction. His chief hope was that his undoubted popularity would lead to his being acclaimed almost spontaneously as head of the state. The first two steps in the programme were safely carried out, and at Saint-Cloud he addressed each assembly in turn. But they did not receive him with the acclaim he expected. Instead, on 10 November they rejected his pretensions and affirmed their loyalty to the Constitution. He had to appeal, unwillingly, to armed force. He ordered his troops to chase the assemblies from their hall. A small number of the representatives remained and, in collusion with Sieyes, voted for constitutional revision. They appointed three consuls to carry it out: Sieyes, Bonaparte, and a nonentity, Roger Ducos. The coup succeeded because neither assemblies nor Directory had any popular esteem left, and the population as a whole - even in Paris accepted the accomplished fact with little resistance. It remained only for that veteran constitution-monger, the Abbe” Sieyes, to draft a constitution on his new formula. ’Confidence from below; power from above’, and for Bonaparte to adapt it to his own views of the situation, which required his personal autocracy endorsed by popular plebiscite. Executive government was invested in a first consul, with two other consuls subordinate to him; a nominated state council was to initiate 48 THE IMPACT ON EUROPE\n\nlegislation: a senate of 60 members was to he nominated by the consuls. When the new arrangement was submitted to plebi.scite, it was announced that more than three million votes had been for it. only 1.562 against it. The Revolution had fulfilled the remarkable prophec\\ of Edmund Burke of nine years before: ’In the weakness of one kind of authority and the fluctuations of all. the officers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and full of faction, imtil some general who understands the art of corciliating the soldierv . . . shall draw the eyes of all men upon himself. Armies will obey him on his personal account. But the moment in which that event shall happen, the person who really cornmands the>army is your master, the master of your King, the master of your Assembly, the master of your whole Republic.’ On Christmas Eve, 179’). only a decade after the Revolution began, that prophecy was cornpletely fulfilled in the formal inauguration of the Consulate. THE IMPACT ON EUROPE\n\nMeanwhile, the eiiects of the war upon Europe were little less revolutionary than upon France itself. Until 1914 the French Revolution could properly be regarded as the most important event in the life of modern Europe. comparableSn its consequences with the Reformation of the sixteenth century and the religious wars of the seventeenth. It destroyed the landmarks of the old established order in politics, economics, social life and thought, diplomacy, and war. Throughout Europe the impact of revolution aad war was enhanced by the previous cult of all things French, which dated from the time of Logis XIV and from the spread of the Enlightenment during the earlier part of the eighteenth century. In Germany particularly, French manners, literature, and thought had become familiar long before 1789. The movement of the Enlightenment (Aitfklariiitg) promoted by men such as Gotthold Lessing spread belief in reason and challenged all existing institutions and beliefs. The same was true, if to a lesser extent, in Belgium, northern Italy; and even Great Britain,. This cultural preparation explains the widespread enthusiasm evoked by the early stages of the revolution in France. In Britain and the United States radicals and democrats of all kinds welcomed the signs that the very model of established absolutist monarchy was at last yielding to the need for constitutional reforms. There took place in 1789 a symbolic gesture of the solidarity of the democratic international when Lafayette, the hero of the United States and newly appointed commander of the National Guard, handed to torn Paine, the republican English hero of America, the key of the Bastille to take to George Washington. In 1792 49\n\n’ FRANCE AT WAR the National Assembly conferred upon torn Paine the title of Trench citizen’, and he was elected as a deputy of the Convention, where he supported the Girondins. The leading English radical philosopher. Jeremy Bentham, despite his hostility to natural rights and Jacobinism, was also made a citizen of France, and as such he duly recorded his vote for Napoleon in 1799. The dominant classes and parties of revolutionary France, feeling that they were conducting a revolution on behalf of all mankind, welcomed into their ranks men of any other nation whom they regarded as sharing their aspiration. And many generous-minded men of other nations responded, to this view of the Revolution - at lea’st until the excesses of the Terror and the aggressions of French armies disillusioned them. The eighteenth century was in culture cosmopolitan, and it fittingly culminated in a cosmopolitan revolution. , It was precisely this universal characteristic of the Revolution dramatized by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and by the revolutionary manifestoes ’ - that provoked European rulers into antagonism. It was something that would not let them alone, and which therefore they could not ignore. But this recognition was not immediate. If radicals were over-enthusiastic in their welcome of revolution, rulers were at first equally exaggeratedly apathetic. France was a traditional rival of all her neighbours, and for the French king to find himself enmeshed in difficulties at home was no unwelcome news to them. There was a rough balance of power in the Eur"
