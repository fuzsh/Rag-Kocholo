        "text": "ComicsForum, 2019\n\nThis paper discusses comics for the Blind, based on the example of life by Philipp Meyer. It looks into the potential and the restrictions of sequential pictorial storytelling that is accessible for blind readers. Special attention is given to the elements of comics' narratives and the technical background of tactile text and image representation. Due to the process of giving information in tactile comics, these present an extreme challenge for readers who have been born blind, while readers that have grown blind later in life seem able to refer the elements of spatially dispersed information (images) to their memory of visual information.\n\nDownload\n\nStoryworlds: A Journal of Narrative Studies, 2015\n\nThe book’s body emerges as a topos in narrative fictions at the interface of print and digital cultures. These fictions may or may not be born digital, but they insist on being engaged in print, which, in turn, reinstates the relationship of printed books with the bodies of readers who physically hold them and turn their pages. Depending on the manner in which such reconfigurations of the textual form inflect the reader’s overall narrative experience, these narrative fictions risk coming across as gimmicky, fetishizing an older media object, or end up being successful examinations of the affordances of the book’s body in the face of emerging media technologies. In this article, after briefly enumerating narrative fictions that experiment with the book’s body and outlining the scholarly attempts to study them, I use the rhetorical approach, which understands narratives as acts of purposive communication from authors to readers, to analyze Chris Ware’s graphic novel, Building Stories (2012). Ware’s experimental and unique “book” is made up of fourteen printed documents, ranging from booklets to broadsheets, enclosed in a box. The novel-in- fragments follows the overlapping lives of several characters who once lived on the different floors of a multistoried brownstone apartment in Chicago. The different documents cannot be satisfactorily arranged to establish any singular narrative order. Thus, Ware’s graphic novel presents itself as a prominent candidate among fictions that subvert the conventional relation of the book’s body with narrative discourse. In comparison with the theoretical models used to examine such experimental books thus far, the concept of progression from the rhetorical approach, as I will show, attends more thoroughly to the resulting narrative form. Additionally, while former analyses of Ware’s graphic novels argue that architecture remains fundamental to his narrative design, my study asserts the centrality of “body” as a structuring analogy. I chart the manner in which Building Stories’ narrative progression enlists interpretive and aesthetic responses for the book’s body through reflections on the human body.\n\nDownload"
