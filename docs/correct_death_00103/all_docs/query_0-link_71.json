Born in the yeat 1098 – died 17 September 1179), is also known as the \"Sybil of the river Rhine\".\n\nHildegard von Bingen was born in a wealthy family fromt the german nobility. She had visions and complex thoughts since she was a little girl. Her family sent her to a monastery, where she became a Catholic Benedictine abbess with great culture and visions that led her to write many books of cosmology and morality (got her recognized as \"Doctor of the Catholic Church\") and had also a great ability for medieval coral music composition, herbal medicine and medical application of stones and tone vibrations.\n\nDeclared by the Roman Catholics as Saint[]\n\nSince 2012 was declared Saint by the Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nShe predicted in twelth century that:\n\n« After several naval disasters the Great Nation between the Oceans, would be struck by earthquakes and by a comet, and this could weaken her power so much... that will lose Her asian colonies to a Tiger and a Lyon... »\n\n(Saint Hildegard of Bingen)\n\nNote: also Alberto Zecua, a mexican contactee, and an avid reader of Velikovsky \"Worlds in Collision\", talks about a comet that will struck Atlantic Ocean off the shores of Virginia (Cape Hatteras, etc.)\n\nIntroduction[]\n\nHildegard of Bingen had many abilities and was a writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath.[1][2] She has been considered by many in Europe to be the founder of scientific natural history in Germany.[3]\n\nHildegard's fellow nuns elected her as magistra in 1136; she founded the monasteries of Rupertsberg in 1150 and Eibingen in 1165. One of her works as a composer, the Ordo Virtutum, is an early example of liturgical drama and arguably the oldest surviving morality play.[4] She wrote theological, botanical, and medicinal texts, as well as letters, liturgical songs,[2] and poems, while supervising miniature illuminations in the Rupertsberg manuscript of her first work, Scivias.[5] She is also noted for the invention of a constructed language known as Lingua Ignota.\n\nAlthough the history of her formal canonization is complicated, branches of the Roman Catholic Church have recognized her as a saint for centuries. On 7 October 2012 Pope Benedict XVI named her a Doctor of the Church.\n\nBiography[]\n\nHildegard was born around the year 1098, although the exact date is uncertain. Her parents were Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet and Hildebert of Bermersheim, a family of the free lower nobility in the service of the Count Meginhard of Sponheim.[6] Sickly from birth, Hildegard is traditionally considered their youngest and tenth child,[7] although there are records of only seven older siblings.[8][9] In her Vita, Hildegard states that from a very young age she had experienced visions.[10]\n\nMonastic life[]\n\nPerhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an oblate to the Benedictine monastery at the Disibodenberg, which had been recently reformed in the Palatinate Forest. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her Vita says she was professed with an older woman, Jutta, the daughter of Count Stephan II of Sponheim, at the age of eight.[11] However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.[12] Their vows were received by Bishop Otto Bamberg on All Saints' Day, 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later.[13]\n\nIn any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the Disibodenberg, and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation.[14] The written record of the Life of Jutta indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick.[15] This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed psaltery.\n\nUpon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was elected as magistra of the community by her fellow nuns.[16] Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg.[17] This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz.\n\nAbbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.[18] Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.\n\nVisions[]\n\nHildegard said that she first saw \"The Shade of the Living Light\" at the age of three, and by the age of five she began to understand that she was experiencing visions.[19] She used the term 'visio' (the Latin for \"vision\") to describe this feature of her experience and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.[20] Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to Jutta, who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary.[21] Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to \"write down that which you see and hear.\"[22] Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations.[23] In her first theological text, \"Scivias\" (\"Know the Ways\"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:\n\n« But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close – though just barely – in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out, therefore, and write thus! »\n\nIt was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that Pope Eugene III heard about Hildegard's writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit giving her instant credence.\n\nOn 17 September 1179, when Hildegard died, her sisters claimed they saw two streams of light appear in the skies and cross over the room where she was dying.[25]\n\nVita Sanctae Hildegardis[]\n\nHildegard's hagiography, \"Vita Sanctae Hildegardis\", was compiled by the monk Theoderic of Echternach after Hildegard's death.[26] He included the hagiographical work Libellus or \"Little Book\" begun by Godfrey of Disibodenberg.[27] Godfrey had died before he was able to complete his work. Guibert of Gembloux was invited to finish the work; however, he had to return to his monastery with the project unfinished. Theoderic utilized sources Guibert had left behind to complete the Vita.\n\nWorks[]\n\nHildegard's works include three great volumes of visionary theology, but Saint Hildegard died fore she was able to complete her work. Guibert of Gembloux was invited to finish the work; however, he had to return to his monastery with the project unfinished. Theoderic utilized sources Guibert had left behind to complete the \"Vita\".\n\nVisionary theology and letters[]\n\nHildegard's letters[]\n\nLetters that appear in different forms in secondary manuscripts. The letters have been translated into English in three volumes. She also invented a language called \"Lingua Incognita\" (\"unknown language\").\n\nRupertsberg manuscript[]\n\nSeveral manuscripts of her works were produced during her lifetime, including the illustrated Rupertsberg manuscript of her first major work, \"Scivias\" (lost in Dresden bombing since 1945); the Dendermonde Codex, which contains one version of her musical works; and the Ghent manuscript, which was the first fair-copy made for editing of her final theological work, the \"Liber Divinorum Operum\". At the end of her life, and probably under her initial guidance, all of her works were edited and gathered into the single Riesenkodex manuscript.[28]\n\nVisionary theology[]\n\nHildegard s most significant works were her three volumes of visionary theology: \"Scivias\" (\"Know the Ways\", composed 1142–1151), \"Liber Vitae Meritorum\" (\"Book of Life's Merits\" or \"Book of the Rewards of Life\", composed 1158–1163); and Liber Divinorum Operum (\"Book of Divine Works\", also known as De operatione Dei, \"On God's Activity\", composed 1163/4–1172 or 1174). In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the \"voice of the Living Light.\"\n\n\"Scivias\"[]\n\nWith permission from Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg, she began journaling visions she had (which is the basis for \"Scivias\"). \"Scivias\" is a contraction of \"Sci vias Domini\" (\"Know the Ways of the Lord\"), and it was Her first major visionary work, and one of the biggest milestones in her life. Perceiving a divine command to \"write down what you see and hear\", [29] Hildegard began to record and interpret her visionary experiences - 26 in total visionary experiences were captured in this compilation. \"Scivias\" is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, the relationship of God to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the Trinity, the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in baptism and confirmation, the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the Eucharist, and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard s musical compositions. In early 1148, a commission was sent by the Pope to Disibodenberg to find out more about Hildegard and her writings. The commission found that the visions were authentic and returned to the Pope, with a portion of the \"Scivias\". Portions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to Pope Eugenius III at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing.[30] This blessing was later construed as papal approval for all of Hildegard s wide-ranging theological activities.[31] Towards the end of her life, Hildegard commissioned a richly decorated manuscript of \"Scivias\" (the Rupertsberg Codex); although the original has been lost since its evacuation to Dresden for safekeeping in 1945, its images are preserved in a hand-painted facsimile from the 1920s.[5]\n\n\"Liber Vitae Meritorum\"[]\n\nIn her second volume of visionary theology, composed between 1158 and 1163, after she had moved her community of nuns into independence at the Rupertsberg in Bingen, Hildegard tackled the moral life in the form of dramatic confrontations between the virtues and the vices. She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ices. She had alr, and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that plays characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defence, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.\n\nAmongst Hildegard innovations is one of the earliest descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have to work off its debts after death before entering heaven.e each soul would have to work off its debts after death before entering heaven.[32] Hildegard s descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the moral in the work and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.\n\nLiber Divinorum Operum[]\n\nSee also the article \"Liber_Divinorum_Operum\" in nostradamus.fandom.com in english\n\nMusic[]\n\nAttention in recent decades to women of the medieval Catholic Church has led to a great deal of popular interest in Hildegard s music. In addition to the \"Ordo Virtutum,\" sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost. [33] This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers. One of her better-known works, \"Ordo Virtutum\" (\"Play of the Virtues\"), is a \"morality play\". It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the \"Ordo Virtutum\" is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.[34] It is an independent Latin morality play with music (82 songs); it does not supplement or pay homage to the Mass or the Office of a certain feast. The most significant part of this entire composition is, however, that the \"Ordo virtutum\" is the earliest known surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy. This entertainment was both performed and bemused by a select community of noblewomen and nuns. Even more fascinating about this piece, the devil has no music whatsoever in the plot of the play, he instead shouts and bellows all his lines. All other characters sing in monophonic plainchant. This includes Patriarchs, Prophets, A Happy Soul, A Unhappy Soul and A Penitent Soul along with 16 female Virtues (including Mercy, Innocence, Chasity, Obedience, Hope, and Faith). The definition of viriditas or \"greenness\" is an earthly expression of the heavenly in an integrity that overcomes dualisms. This greenness or power of life appears frequently in Her works.[35] Despite Hildegard s self-professed view that her compositions have as their object the praise of God, one scholar has asserted that Hildegard made a close association between music and the female body in her musical compositions.[36]\n\nScientific and medicinal writings[]\n\nThe medicinal and scientific writings of Hildegard of Bingen, though thematically complementary to her ideas about nature expressed in her visionary works, are different in focus and scope. Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library.[37] As she gained practical skills in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, she combined physical treatment of physical diseases with holistic methods centered on \"spiritual healing.\"[38] She became well known for her healing powers involving the practical application of tinctures, herbs, and precious stones.[39] She combined these elements with a theological notion ultimately derived from Genesis: all things put on earth are for the use of humans. [40] In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts. [38] In addition to its wealth of practical evidence, \"Causae et Curae\" is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard s approach.[37] Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. \"Viriditas\", or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.[38] Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.[38] Thus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of \"Causae et Curae\" \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\"[37] In this section, she give specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.[38] As she writes in \"Causae et Curae\" c. 42:\n\n« It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the \"flegmata\" within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [\"livor\"]. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the \"flegmata\" arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses. »\n\n\"Lingua ignota\" and \"Litterae ignotae\"[]\n\nHildegard also invented an alternative alphabet. \"Litterae ignotae\" (\"Alternate Alphabet\") was another work and was more or less a secret code, or even an intellectual code – much like a modern crossword puzzle today. The text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval Latin, encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.[10] Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many conlangers look upon her as a medieval precursor.[42] Hildegard von Bingen and her \"Lingua ignota\" (\"Unknown Language\") was a composition that comprised a series of invented words that corresponded to an eclectic list of nouns. Scholars believe that Hildegard used her Lingua Ignota to increase solidarity among her nuns.[43]\n\nSignificance[]\n\nDuring her lifetime[]\n\nMaddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith but was not instructed in the Seven Liberal Arts, which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the \"Trivium\" of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the \"Quadrivium\" of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.[44] The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transcended the cloister as a space of spiritual confinement and served to document Her grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.[45]. Contributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard \"authorized herself as a theologian\" through alternative rhetorical arts.[45] Hildegard was creative in her interpretation of theology. She believed that her monastery should exclude novices who were not from the nobility because she did not want her community to be divided on the basis of social status.[46] She also stated that \"woman may be made from man, but no man can be made without a woman.\"[25] Many abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters.[1] She traveled widely during her four preaching tours.[47] She had several devoted followers, including Guibert of Gembloux, who wrote to her frequently and became her secretary after the death of Volmar in 1173. Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with Elisabeth of Schönau, a nearby visionary.[48] Hildegard corresponded with popes such as Eugene III and Anastasius IV, statesmen such as Abbot Suger, German emperors such as Frederick I Barbarossa, and other notable figures such as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the Synod of Trier in 1147 and 1148. The correspondence of Hildegard of Bingen is an important component of her literary output.[49]\n\nBeatification, canonization and recognition as a Doctor of the Church[]\n\nHildegard was one of the first persons for whom the Roman canonization process was officially applied, but the process took so long that four attempts at canonization were not completed and she remained at the level of her beatification. Her name was nonetheless taken up in the Roman Martyrology at the end of the 16th century. Her feast day is 17 September. Numerous popes have referred to Hildegard as a saint, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI. On 10 May 2012, Pope Benedict XVI extended the liturgical cult of St. Hildegard to the entire Catholic Church [50] in a process known as \"equivalent canonization,\" [51] thus laying the groundwork for naming her a Doctor of the Church. [52] On 7 October 2012, the feast of the Holy Rosary, the pope named her a Doctor of the Church, the fourth woman among 35 saints given that title by the Roman Catholic Church.[53] Hildegard of Bingen also appears in the calendar of saints of various Anglican churches, such as that of the Church of England, in which she is commemorated on 17 September.\n\nRelics of Saint Hildegard[]\n\nThe parish of Hildegard, that was also Her pilgrimage church in Eibingen near Rüdesheim houses her relics.\n\nModern interest[]\n\nIn recent years, Hildegard has become of particular interest to feminist scholars.[54] They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis.[55] Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.<ref>Barbara Newman, \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation,\" \"Church History\" 54 (1985): pp. 163–75. Hildegard used her voice to amplify the condemnation of institutional corruption in the Catholic Church, in particular simony. Hildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary New Age movement, mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Though her medical writings were long neglected, and then studied without reference to their context, she was the inspiration of \"Hildegard-Medicine\" by Dr. Gottfried Hertzka, and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing.\n\nA possible reincarnation for Saint Hildegard?[]\n\nAn hypothesis for the reincarnation of Saint Hildegard has been proposed and debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic Rudolf Steiner lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet-philosopher Vladimir Soloviev, (Steiner, Rudolf. Karmic Relationships, Vol. 4 (1924)) whose Sophianic visions are often compared to those of the Saint. Sophiologist Robert Powell writes that hermetic astrology proves the match, while mystical communities in the lineage of Hildegard include that of artist Carl Schroeder as studied by Columbia sociologist Courtney Bender and supported by reincarnation researchers Walter Semkiw and Kevin Ryerson.\n\nInfluence in modern music[]\n\nRecordings and performances of Her music have gained critical praise and popularity since rnation . See Discography listed below.
