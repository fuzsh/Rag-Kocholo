        "text": "Gerard Radnitzky: [http://www.law.keio.ac.jp/~popper/v2n1radnitzky2.html William W. Bartley III (1934-1990)] . \"Popper Letters\" 2:1 (1990)] Bartley died of cancer on February 5, 1990 at his home in Oakland, California, after having been diagnosed with the disease in the middle of the preceding year. [Stephen Kresge: [http://www.law.keio.ac.jp/~popper/v2n1kresge.html On the Passing of W. W. Bartley III] . \"Popper Letters\" 2:1 (1990)]\n\nAuthor and Editor\n\nBartley published a biography of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, titled simply \"Wittgenstein\", in 1973. [William Warren Bartley III, \"Wittgenstein,\" Philadelphia, Lippincott, 1973.] The book contained a relatively brief, 4–5 page treatment of Wittgenstein's homosexuality, relying mainly on reportage from the philosopher's friends and acquaintances. This matter caused enormous controversy in intellectual and philosophical circles; many perceived it as a posthumous \"attack\" on Wittgenstein. Some foreign editions of the book, like the Spanish, were printed with the \"offending\" material excised. [Bartley treats the criticisms and related matters in the second edition of the biography: \"Wittgenstein\", La Salle, Illinois, Open Court, 1985; pp. 159-97.] In a second edition of the biography, Bartley answered the objections of critics, pointing out that Wittgenstein's period of active homosexuality is verified by the philosopher's own private writings, included his coded diaries; extensive confirmation was also available from people who knew Wittgenstein in the period between the two World Wars in Vienna, including ex-lovers. Bartley also considers, and rejects, the idea of a connection between the private life and the philosophy.\n\nBartley wrote a best-selling biography [Bartley, William Warren, \"Werner Erhard The Transformation of a Man\": \"The Founding of EST\", Clarkson Potter, 1988. ISBN 0-517-53502-5] of Werner Erhard, the founder of est. Bartley was graduate of Erhard Seminars Training, from 1972. Werner Erhard refers to Bartley in the book as \"My friend Bill\". William Bartley served on the advisory board of Est, an educational company.\n\nBartley edited Lewis Carroll's book \"Symbolic Logic\" (see symbolic logic), including the second volume, which Carroll had never published.\n\nBartley is perhaps best known today for his work in extending Popperian epistemology, discussed in his book \"The Retreat to Commitment\". In it, he describes Pancritical rationalism (PCR), a development of critical rationalism and panrationalism. PCR attempts to work around the problem of ultimate commitment or infinite regress by decoupling criticism and justification. A pancritical rationalist holds all positions open to criticism, including PCR, and never resorts to authority for justification.\n\nParts of Popper's \"Realism and the Aim of Science\", a book which Bartley edited, and the Addendum to the fourth edition to \"The Open Society and its Enemies\" contain passages that are commonly interpreted as Popper's acceptance of Bartley's views. Mariano Artigas held that these were in fact written by Bartley himself.rp|23–25, 96 Alan Ebenstein, a biographer of F. A. von Hayek, criticized Bartley for the extent of the changes he did as the editor of \"The Fatal Conceit\". [Alan Ebenstein: [http://libertyunbound.com/archive/2005_03/ebenstein-deceit.html Investigation: The Fatal Deceit] . \"Liberty\" 19:3 (March 2005)]\n\nAt the time of his death, Bartley had just finished his last book, \"Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth: On Universities and the Wealth of Nations\". Other works he was preparing at that time included writing a biography, and editing the collected works, of Friedrich Hayek. The latter is still being completed after Bartley's death by his colleagues. Also unfinished is a biography of Karl R. Popper. Both biographies were already in an advanced stage at the time of Bartley's death.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n*\"The Retreat to Commitment\", 1962\n\n*\"Morality and Religion\", 1971\n\n*\"Lewis Carroll's Symbolic Logic\", 1977\n\n*\"Wittgenstein,\" 1973, 1985\n\n*\"Ludwig Wittgenstein e Karl Popper: maestri di scuola elementare,\" 1976\n\n*\"Come demarcare la scienza della metafisica\", 1983\n\n*\"\", 1988\n\n*\"Unfathomed Knowledge, Unmeasured Wealth\", 1990\n\n*\"Karl Popper: A Life,\" unpublished\n\nExternal links"
