Wittgenstein wrote mainly about language (e.g., issues involving linguistic meaning and the relationship of language to the world) but he also wrote about the philosophy of mathematics, certainty, rule-following, and psychology, just to name a few topics. The trajectory of Wittgenstein’s thought and career is bounded by his Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, which he completed in an Italian prisoner of war camp at the end of World War I and his Philosophical Investigations, which was published after his death in 1951.
