        "text": "I am trying to conduct you on tours in a certain country. I will try to show that the philosophical difficulties which arise in mathematics as elsewhere arise because we find ourselves in a strange town and do not know our way. So we must learn the topography by going from one place in the town to another, and from there to another, and so on.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein, in his lecture on the Foundation of Mathematics (1939)\n\nThis essay describes a journey: a kind of pilgrimage. It begins with a walk across a landscape to a site that has not been occupied for more than fifty years; a place where a man came to be solitary and to think.1 As I begin this journey, I am reminded of Christopher Tilley’s remark in his book, A Phenomenology of Landscape:-\n\nA landscape is a series of named locales, a set of relational places linked by paths, movements and narratives. It is a ‘natural’ topography perspectivally linked to the existential Being of the body in societal space. It is a cultural code for living, and anonymous ‘text’ to be read and interpreted, a writing pad for inscription, a scape for human praxis, a mode of dwelling and a mode of experiencing (Tilley, 34).\n\nThe text that follows is a kind of journey on which I have set myself the task of reimagining Wittgenstein’s hut at Skjolden. I will attempt to trace and record the routes that will culminate in this reimagination. It will be an experiential and phenomenological process of walking, thinking and interpreting in the spirit of Wittgenstein’s insight that ‘when one sketch is placed alongside another the beholder becomes capable of seeing connections that are only potentially present in individual ones. Notice, however, that these connections do not determine the only way of looking at the landscape, just one of many possible ones that renders the characteristic traits of it’ (Wittgenstein in Larsen, Johannessen & Amas, 223-224).\n\nIn October 1913, Wittgenstein left Cambridge and his studies with Bertrand Russell, and retreated to Skjolden; a small village situated at the end of the Lusterfjord, to spend the winter thinking, writing and walking the paths bordering Lake Eidsvatnet. Wittgenstein had first visited the village in the summer of 1913. He returned later that year to make an extended stay and resided in the village as a guest of the local postmaster. The following year, he commissioned local builders to begin building a hut overlooking the lake on the north side and about a mile from the village. Ivar Oxaal explains:-\n\n(...)Wittgenstein planned to build a hut and, like transcendentalist theorist Henry Thoreau, to live alone and meditate...The local builders began working on the hut in the spring...there are no details about Wittgenstein’s involvement in the design or its construction...Wittgenstein’s hut was built on the lower slopes of a mountain, but with a magnificent view (Oxaal, 111).\n\nOxaal questions Wittgenstein’s motivation for siting the hut overlooking the lake. He asks: ‘... was this fabulous view just an ego trip for a wealthy foreign tourist or was it a hideaway form the persistent anti-Semitism in Vienna? The site is a contradiction: if the point was to have a solitary life, it seems highly inappropriate – the hut, with its highly prominent location, was near the village, and the road from Skjolden to Lom was nearby...’(Oxaal, 150). Wittgenstein was unable to oversee the completion of the building and was only able to return to Skjolden sometime after the end of World War One. In his biography of Wittgenstein, Ray Monk notes that the philosopher was kept informed by letter of progress on the building by the postmaster. He reported that:-\n\nThe news from Norway was that work on his hut had been completed. ‘We all hope’ wrote Klingenburg ‘that you will soon be able to return to your new home, which is now finished. Wittgenstein paid the workers via another Skjolden resident, who was surprised to be sent the money; he had not expected Wittgenstein to pay, he wrote until his return (Monk, 125).\n\nWhether or not the hut was based on an architectural drawing is uncertain and it is likely that the carpenter responsible built it without a formal plan. Wittgenstein’s stays at the hut from 1921 until his death in 1951 were intermittent. It was never a permanent residence for him but operated as a bolt-hole from both his professional and personal lives; teaching in Cambridge and family in Vienna. in his book, Mysticism and Architecture Roger Paden comments that the hut was (...) constructed in the local style appropriate to cold temperatures and heavy snowfall (...) Visitors from England found it spartan at best, but they were nevertheless impressed with its ingenious details. Its most important feature from Wittgenstein’s perspective, however was its location, which was sufficiently isolated to enable hime to get some work done’ (Paden, 17).\n\nI have crossed farmland and passed several wooden buildings. At this point in the walk there are two markers; a small board on a post with the (now familiar) red circle marked on it on the right and a second, on the left- hand side of the path inscribed with the word ‘Wittgenstein’ and an arrow which has fallen over slightly and is obscured by nettles. The path passes into woodland. There is a delapidated hut to the right of the path with a noticable marker (a red painted ‘w’), the path skirts the northern edge of the lake heading west. It is at this point that the terrain begins to change.\n\nThe path climbs across rocks of varying sizes and drops amongst the trees that edge the lake. I speculate that the builders of Wittgenstein’s hut must have begun by constructing a path to the site. Perhaps this path?\n\nIn 1936 Wittgenstein travelled again to Skjolden for an extended stay. The following year he invited his friend (and possible his lover) Francis Skinner to join him there from Cambridge. Monk records from Skinner’s letters to Wittgenstein, elements of the domestic activities they undertook in the hut in this period. Specifically, he describes an occasion when both determined to clean the floor of Wittgenstein’s room by spreading wet tea-leaves to soak up the dirt before sweeping them up.\n\nHistorically it seems that the hut was accessed by boat across Lake Eidsvatnet. Wittgenstein was supplied during his stays there with provisions from the local village by boat from acroos the lake and a pulley system up to the hut. The philosopher also rowed across the lake in all weathers to reach the village for company and to retrieve his post. In his biography of Wittgenstein, (Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius), Ray Monk states that: ‘Wittgenstein sent Moore (philosopher G.E. Moore) a map, showing his hut in relation to the fjord, the neighbouring mountains and the nearest village. The point was to illustrate that it was impossible for him to get to the village without rowing’ (Monk, 363).\n\nWittgenstein returned to the hut in the first week of October 1950 with his friend Ben Richards. On arrival, Richards was struck down with bronchitis and had to be moved from the hut to a nursing home further up the fjord to recuperate. Both Wittgenstein and Richards then moved to into Skjolden for the remainder of their stay. On returning to England, Wittgenstein made tentative plans to return to Skjolden again on his own but his own ill-health and untimely death in 1951, thwarted him and he never returned to Norway. In the aftermath of Wittgenstein’s death in 1951, the hut remained unoccupied and in the possession of a local man until it was finally dismantled and its fragments relocated to Skjolden in 1957.\n\nThe path through the trees is generally well marked (although a number of the markers on stones have been obliterated by moss and lichen). At one point I miss an important marker (I tell myself later that I am focused on where I put my feet amongst the rocky terrain) and take a path onwards along the lakeside heading north. The terrain becomes increasingly tough before the path disintegrates completely. I look up to see the remains of what must be the pulley system that Wittgenstein designed to bring supplies to him without him needing to have direct contact with people.\n\nFor one mad moment I seriously consider this to be the way up and try to progress upwards. It is far too difficult and I abort my attempt to climb and retrace my steps hoping to find a marker that I must have missed. As I reach the point at which the lakeside turns east, I look to my left and see a marker (a red ‘w’ in a red circle) on a stone that indicates a steep path heading slightly to the north east. My relief is palpable and I begin to scale the path swiftly, looking ahead to see an additional marker and a supplementary red ‘t’ which indicates a sharp turn to the left (heading north west) and the continuation of the climb. As I ascend, the lake is visible through the broken treee line to the left (as is the steepness of the drop to the lake edge). Several metal posts appear on the right hand side under an overhanging rock face before a flagpole emerges mounted at the top edge of a steeply inclined rock. A limp flag hints at Wittgenstein’s origins and alerts me to the fact that I have reached ‘Austria’.\n\nA little further and the stone foundation that is all that remains of the hut emerges at the top of the incline. The path then veers to the right of the foundations and levels out where there is a noticeboard and a seat mounted on the corner of the foundations. As I turn and look west across the foundations, I am confronted by the view which takes in the lake and the village of Skjolden framed by the mountains beyond.\n\nAs of 2014, what remains of Wittgenstein’s hut at Skjolden is a stone foundation at the lakeside and the remnants of the dismantled wooden structure in the nearby village. It in some ways has become a place of pilgrimage for the community of Wittgenstein scholars.There is also an on-going campaign to preserve the site led by Wittgenstein scholar Dawn Phillips and artist, David Connearn. However, there appears to besome confusion as to what remains of the wooden structure. Phillips and Connearn propose that it is substantially intact whereas Ivar Oxaal suggests that it was cannibalised and parts of it were incorporated into a number of properties in the village.\n\nAfter visiting the site in 1984, Oxaal notes- ‘We drove back to the village to look at the relocated hut. I didn’t know what to expect, but sadly, the new owners had clad the walls with white asbestos-shingle, perhaps to conceal the mistakes in the re-assembly or possibly to save on maintenance. The incongruity between this beautiful setting and this pathetic little house was very disappointing’ (Oxaal, 150).\n\nThe site of Wittgenstein’s hut differs from Heidegger’s purpose built hut at Todtnauberg in that it is much less accessible. Oxall argues that Heidegger’s hut has an ‘unexciting view’ (Oxaal, 111) whereas Wittgenstein’s is ‘magnificent’ (ibid, 111). The notion that important buildings should be built up high has been an architectural hallmark since classical times. Elevation by itself – up in the mountains, among the clouds, has a powerful psychological effect. However, in both cases, these thinking places were not elevated ‘beyond’a community. Their purported ‘isolation’ was conditional on the required practicalities of this proximity. Wittgenstein and Heidegger go to some lengths to contextualise their thinking processes within the tension between a percieved ‘topographical isolation’ where thought ‘happens’ and the need to be part of a community. Wittgenstein stated: ‘life here is on one hand terrible for me, on the other it is something beautiful and friendly’ (Wittgenstein in Larsen and Johannessen, 51). To think and write in ‘simple’ isolated surroundings is one thing; articulating those thoughts requires a community of listeners and interpreters.\n\nOn my return home I began the practical process of reimagining the hut. I think of language and translation; to associate the Norwegian word ‘Hytte’ with the building that was constructed on the mountainside above Lake Eidsvatnet is misleading if we are to translate Hytte as merely ‘hut’. In English the word hut suggests something small, rudimentary and simple. Interestingly, surviving visual records (black and white photographs taken during the 1920s and 30s) and the site itself, indicate that the structure at Skjolden was significantly more than ‘just a hut’. It was in effect a two- story property with an upstairs balcony that ran across the front façade facing the lake. Lesley Chamberlain argues that the style was specifically Austrian; a chalet, and so locals referred to it as ‘Austria’ and Wittgenstein was known locally as ‘the Austrian’ (Chamberlain, 2011)."
