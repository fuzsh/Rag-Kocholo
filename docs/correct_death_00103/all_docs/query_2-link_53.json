        "text": "Wittgenstein on the Meaning of Life: From Theory to Therapy\n\nAbstract\n\nMy contribution attempts to elucidate the relevance of the question of the meaning of life for the development of Wittgenstein's (philosophical) style of thinking. The author suggests that the intellectual and ethical query which shaped the life of Ludwig Wittgenstein can also be found on a deeper level in his philosophical considerations regarding linguistic and logical issues. This internal relationship, which has remained neglected within classical analytical approaches, allows for a deeper understanding of the ethical demand James Conant takes to be the strategic point of view of Wittgenstein's philosophical activity.\n\nTable of contents\n\n1. The Problem of Life\n\n2. The Vanishing of the Problem?\n\n3. From Monologue to Polylogue: From Logical Form to the Form of Life\n\n4. From the Final Solution to an Endless Denkbewegung: Laboro in Me Ipso\n\nLiterature\n\nIn the philosophical Œvre of Ludwig Wittgenstein explicitly ethical remarks appear as scattered islands within the ocean of logical and linguistic investigations. The fact that precisely these remarks motivate Wittgenstein's Denkbewegungen was articulated by the author himself several times.1 In the following article we attempt to provide hints for the ethical dimension of Wittgenstein's \"authorial strategy\" (Conant, 2000, 175) by reflecting on the importance of the question of the meaning of life for the development of Wittgenstein's philosophical style of thinking. When refering to the \"close relationship between his life problems and his philosophical way of thinking\" (DB, 8, my translation), we are not following the impulse of reductionist psychologization, but are offering an invitation to a reading of Wittgenstein’s philososophy that emphasizes the 'tone of voice\" (Monk, 2001, 4) of his language.\n\n1. The Problem of Life\n\nWhen we become a „terra difficultatis“ (Augustinus, X, XVI, 25) for ourselves by looking into the mirror of diffuse reflection and the painful questions of metaphysics make our entire life questionable, philosophical thinking organizes an attempt to give an answer to the elementary questions of our existence.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein's diary notes written when he was a volunteer soldier in the First World War give a picture of a desperate psychological state which provides the origin of the metaphysical need that is made to disappear at the end of the Tractatus. In relative analogy to Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein keeps a continuous journal in which biographical and philosophical notes penetrate each other. The partial encoding of the entries and the phenomenological structure of the diary allows for a remarkable insight into Wittgenstein's style of thinking and working; from diaries and notebooks - strictly thought through - the philosophical core, which gives the Tractatus its enigmatical form, becomes distilled. Philosophy and biography penetrate each other in the form of a doubled bookkeeping. Recto and verso of the manuscript mark the two invisibly interacting spheres of the personal and the philosophical.\n\nIn a state of deep disconcertment about the painful disruption of human existence, the young Wittgenstein asks himself the metaphysical question par excellence:\n\n„Kann man aber so leben daß das Leben aufhört problematisch zu sein? Daß man im Ewigen lebt und nicht in der Zeit?“ (BEE, Ms 102, 117r [1.6.1915])\n\nIn asking this question Wittgenstein recapitulates a figure of traditional philosophical thought: the idea of an approach sub specie aeternitatis. The finite nature of human understanding is to be abolished in favour of a deeper insight into the hidden rules of the world. This is the expression of a passionate desire to be redeemed by the ordering of metaphysical knowledge, wherein the untiring longing for the right form of life comes to an end:\n\n„Das große Problem, um das sich alles dreht, was ich schreibe; ist: Ist a priori, eine Ordnung in der Welt, und wenn, ja, worin besteht sie?“ (BEE, Ms 102, 117r [1.6.1915])\n\nInner loneliness and depression make the idea of suicide possible throughout Wittgenstein's whole life. Suicide is no more than the destruction of life (In this way Weininger removed the contradictions between his moral ideal and human reality). In a conversation with his close friend David Hume Pinsent, Wittgenstein said that the care of Bertrand Russell ended \"nine years of lonely suffering, in which he constantly considered suicide”. (Monk, 2004, 57, my translation)\n\nThere is sufficient autobiographical and biographical evidence to show, that also for the rest of his life, Wittgenstein’s inner moral struggle with his own imperfection and continuously growing feelings of meaninglessness never came to a standstill. Throughout his entire life Ludwig Wittgenstein continues to search for the right form of life. Tormented with inner strain and restlessness, in permanently new drafts he will try to make vanish the problems of philosophy and the problem of life, which stand in a complex relationship to each other.\n\nIn the Tractatus we come across the attempt to give the problems a logically strict form in order to make them dissolve on the critical point of their condensation.\n\nRefbacks"
