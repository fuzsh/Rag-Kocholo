        "text": "A Wonderful Life\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius.\n\nby Ray Monk.\n\nThe Free Press. 580 pp. $29.95.\n\n“Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.” These were the last words of perhaps the greatest, certainly one of the most influential, philosophers of our century. In Ray Monk’s superb biography we see just how wonderful Wittgenstein’s life was.\n\nNot that it was especially happy. It was full of personal suffering, much of it self-imposed. There was the fact of his Jewish ancestry, which weighed on him, and there was his strained relationship to his own sexuality, itself tinged with tragedy (the two men whom he truly loved, David Pinsent and Francis Skinner, died tragically young, and the one woman whom he planned to make his wife rejected him). Moreover, no one with Wittgenstein’s immense ethical seriousness would have been a likely candidate for happiness in the usual sense.\n\nFor all that, his life was wonderful. It was, for a start, full of wonders. Wittgenstein founded not one but two of the major movements of modern philosophy. His genius as a technical logician was dumbfounding; an awestruck Bertrand Russell virtually gave up serious philosophy not long after meeting him, and even when he later disagreed with Wittgenstein’s ideas, he retained his respect for his genius.\n\nIt is not Wittgenstein’s brilliance, however, which stands out in this biography—after all, that is to be expected—but rather the aweinspiring qualities of the man. In his never-ending struggle with himself, his insistence on personal integrity in thought and deed, and his deep insights into the human condition and the religious nature of man, Wittgenstein in Monk’s portrayal is revealed as a hugely sympathetic personality. His life, full of wonders, also fills the reader with wonder.\n\n_____________\n\nWittgenstein was born in 1889 into one of the most remarkable families of late 19th-century Central Europe. His grandfather, Hermann Christian, had (as the name suggests) left Judaism and converted to Protestantism, eventually settling in Vienna, the home of his wife, also a convert from Judaism. Wittgenstein’s father, Karl, married a woman of Catholic religion but again of Jewish descent (on her father’s side), Leopoldine Kalmus. Karl went on to become the most influential man in the Austrian steel industry, and one of the richest in the Hapsburg monarchy. He was also a great patron of the arts, especially music, as indeed his father had been before him. All this took place in the cultural hothouse of Vienna 1900.\n\nWittgenstein lost his Catholic faith in his teens, when he was attending the same technical school in Linz as Hitler. To ease the transition, his older sister Hermine gave him the works of Schopenhauer and Otto Weininger. Of the two, Schopenhauer was by then required reading for any man of culture. But Weininger was a different case entirely.\n\nUsually dismissed as an aberration of his time, a self-hating Jew and a misogynist who committed suicide in 1903 at the age of twenty-three, Weininger was to exercise an important influence on Wittgenstein’s view of the world. What we have in Monk’s account is in effect a portrayal of Weiningerian man. This book’s epigraph, indeed, is a quotation from Weininger’s Sex and Character: “Logic and ethics are fundamentally the same, they are no more than duty to oneself.” Monk makes clear just how much Wittgenstein took this maxim to heart throughout his life.\n\n_____________\n\nDuring World War I, Wittgenstein experienced a kind of religious conversion. By 1916 his reading of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, combined with his background in Schopenhauer and Weininger, had led him to a belief in God and Christianity, if in a typically abstract, almost solipsistic, way. God was conscience, Christianity not a matter of doctrine but entirely of practice, of attitude. Monk is particularly good at describing how the spiritual turmoil of those years transformed what had started in Wittgenstein as a pure interest in logic (he had shaken off his father’s wish that he take up a technical vocation and gone to Cambridge to become Russell’s protégé) into the postwar Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, with its mysterious statements on the self, ethics, and aesthetics.\n\nFollowing his new-found religious fervor, Wittgenstein, after time in a prisoner-of-war camp, dedicated himself to an ascetic life of service. He gave away his immense fortune to other members of his family and trained to be a teacher in the Austrian countryside. This was not a success; eventually Wittgenstein returned to civilization, first becoming an architect and then going back to philosophy. Throughout the 1920’s he remained in touch with his former Cambridge friends and was also consulted by the group of philosophers who came to be known as the Vienna Circle. But it was only on his return to Cambridge in January 1929 that his career as a philosopher really resumed. Monk quotes John Maynard Keynes on his erstwhile friend’s return: “Well, God has arrived. I met him on the 5:15 train.”\n\nBy now Wittgenstein was in the process of completely revising his notions of language and logic, a process which led in his “second” philosophy to a view of language understood in terms of its use and its dependence on culture and tradition. In the 1930’s, too, he became increasingly concerned to counteract what he saw as the unjustified and harmful worship of science—unjustified because scientific truths could never have absolute validity, harmful because the assumption of scientific generality could lead people to neglect the wonder of the world’s irreducible variety, and to misunderstand what was truly important in life: the world of the spirit, of ethics and aesthetics, that which could be shown but not said, as he had so famously put it in the Tractatus. In this he was still following Weininger, and was clearly deeply influenced as well by Spengler. It is a huge irony that Wittgenstein, who sympathized with the Communist Left (at one point he wanted to live in the Soviet Union), should have developed in his later philosophy one of the strongest conservative critiques of progressivism and scientism.\n\n_____________\n\nWhen Wittgenstein died in 1951 he was given a Roman Catholic burial. In Monk’s view this was appropriate, in the sense that Wittgenstein had led a devoutly “religious” life; but Monk also asserts, rightly, that Wittgenstein was not a Catholic. Nor was his religion Jewish; indeed, he was about as far from traditional Judaism as any product of assimilation could be. Wittgenstein’s religion, shaped by Christian forms and the concepts of German idealism, was very much his own, his god the god of his conscience.\n\nUntil the 1930’s Wittgenstein seems hardly to have acknowledged his Jewish descent. In the family it was something which, while not to be denied, one was proud to have overcome. What little we know seems to suggest a negative attitude, not surprising given the influence of Weininger (and Karl Kraus). Wittgenstein did, however, discuss his own “Jewishness” in a smattering of enigmatic and rather cutting notes which he made in 1931. Of these Monk comments that “thankfully” Wittgenstein subsequently made no more. This is the one point in his excellent book where I think Monk goes astray, for (as Rush Rhees once pointed out) Wittgenstein’s cryptic remarks are not necessarily negative but may instead constitute a recognition that Jews—including, in this context, himself—are different. One need not agree with Wittgenstein’s self-assessment to want to know more about what he thought his own “Jewishness” consisted in.\n\nOne of the 1931 remarks asserts, for instance, that Spengler was justified in placing Jewish thinkers, among them Otto Weininger, in a different category from Westerners. What is intriguing here is that in The Decline of the West Spengler praised Weininger, calling him a Jewish saint and his moral struggle with himself “one of the noblest spectacles ever presented by a late religiousness.” Moreover, Spengler linked Weininger to primitive Christianity, whose true character, he claimed, was never understood in the “Greek” and “German” West. In this light, Wittgenstein’s remark of 1942, quoted by Monk, that his own religion was not “Greek” but “100-percent Hebraic,” takes on a significance which Monk seems to miss. If this was his view of his religiosity, is there a sense in which he was right about it?\n\nBut a question like this must remain highly speculative, fittingly so in the case of such an enigmatic and complex figure. What is quite clear is that Ray Monk has provided us with a compelling and fascinating picture of not only a great philosopher, but a remarkable human being."
