        "text": "\"Whereof one cannot speak, one must remain silent.\" Ludwig Wittgenstein\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein is one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century, and is most famous for his work in the areas of logic and language. He was also interested in the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of mathematics, and made significant contributions in these areas.\n\nI've done my best to recount the highlights of his life, but if I gave you his full biography, this article would be far too long for LinkedIn! Do please give him a quick Google when you have the time as he really did live the most incredible life, and was a truly remarkable character.\n\nThe Man\n\nLudwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein was an Austrian philosopher, and one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. He is widely regarded as the most significant philosopher since Immanuel Kant for his work on language.\n\nWittgenstein was born in Vienna, and was heir to one of Europe's richest families. He had eight older siblings, three sisters and five brothers, and one sister who died in infancy. His father, Karl Wittgenstein, was one of the leading figures in the Austrian iron and steel industry, and the family possessed huge amounts of both money and talent. Their home became a gathering point for the great writers, intellectuals and artists of the time; including Sigmund Freud, Gustav Klimt, Johannes Brahms and Karl Kraus among others.\n\nWittgenstein was taught by private tutors at home until he was 14 years old. Two of his brothers had committed suicide after suffering from severe bouts of depression, and it was only after the deaths of his brothers that he was allowed to attend school. Understandably, the suicides of his brothers had a significant effect on the young Ludwig, and it was hoped that attending school would provide a distraction. However, because he had had no formal schooling, Wittgenstein was unable to pass the entrance exam for the more academic grammar school, and instead ended up attending the smaller technical school. This proved to be no obstacle to Wittgenstein's academic success however, and he excelled at school. He had a fine mind, was an excellent scholar and pursued his studies with great vigour.\n\nIn October 1911, Wittgenstein left Vienna and went to the University of Cambridge to study under Bertrand Russell. The young Wittgenstein had a brilliant and original mind and was soon dominating the undergraduate lectures. Russell was convinced that he was a genius, remarking to a friend that Wittgenstein was \"the young man one hopes for.\"\n\nAs a first year undergraduate, Wittgenstein worked with such intensity on logic that by the end of the year, Russell declared that he had nothing left to teach him! Wittgenstein evidently thought so too, and left Cambridge, without graduating, to work on his own ideas. He found other people to be an unwelcome distraction, and so moved to Norway where he built a small wooden hut next to a fjord where he lived and worked in remote isolation. He returned to the hut at various points throughout his life, his longest stay being for 13 months.\n\nIn 1913, at the age of 24, Wittgenstein inherited a large fortune from his father but gave the entire amount away to his siblings after experiencing one of his recurring bouts of severe depression. Upon the outbreak of World War One in 1914, Wittgenstein enlisted as an officer and served on the front line. He was decorated a number of times for his courage on the battlefield.\n\nIn 1918, he took leave from the military and completed his most famous work Logico Tractatus-Philosophicus. He had returned home to Vienna in order to write the book, but whilst there, was subject to a series of deeply traumatic events from which he never fully recovered. In the space of one year (1918) Wittgenstein learned that the Tractatus was not going to be published, and also that his great friend David Pinsent had been killed in a plane crash. In the same year, his uncle died, and a third brother, Kurt, committed suicide. These events left Wittgenstein distraught to the point of being suicidal, and it was only by returning to the front line when his leave ended, that he was able to escape the miseries of his personal life.\n\nWhen he did return to the Italian front at the end of 1918, he was captured almost immediately by Allied forces, and spent the next nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp. As you can imagine this did nothing to improve his already significantly impaired mental health, and by the time Wittgenstein returned to Vienna in 1919, he was physically and mentally very unwell, talking constantly of suicide.\n\nIt was at this point that Wittgenstein decided to enrol in teacher training college as an elementary school teacher! (He must have been seriously deranged!). He left Vienna and taught in elementary schools in remote Austrian villages where he encountered controversy for hitting children when they made mistakes in mathematics!\n\nThe Tractatus was eventually published in 1922, and immediately generated a great deal of interest within philosophical circles. Wittgenstein became internationally famous and returned to Cambridge University in 1929 to continue the work that he had started under Russell. He was unable to teach there initially as he did not have a degree, and was instead offered a PhD studentship and asked to submit Tractatus as his thesis. The Tractatus was duly accepted, and Wittgenstein was granted a PhD, appointed as a lecturer and then made a fellow of Trinity College.\n\nWhen World War Two broke out, Wittgenstein found it unconscionable to be teaching philosophy when Britain was being Blitzed, and wanted to help out in the civilian war effort. In September 1941, he obtained a job as a dispensary porter at Guys Hospital. We have an account of his time there from Ray Monk. (Ray Monk, The Duty of Genius, 433-434)\n\n“Wittgenstein’s job as a porter was to deliver medicines from the dispensary to the wards, where, according to John Ryle’s wife, Miriam, he advised the patients not to take them. His boss at the pharmacy was Mr. S F. Izzard. When asked later if he remembered Wittgenstein as a porter, Izzard replied, ‘Yes, very well. He came and worked here and after working here three weeks he came and explained how we should be running the place. You see, he was a man who was used to thinking.’\n\nWittgenstein died in 1951 at the age of 62, and his final words were \"Tell them I've had a wonderful life.\"\n\nHis Philosophy\n\nAs an undergraduate at Cambridge University, Wittgenstein studied under Bertrand Russell and was very much influenced by the Logical Positivist movement, and in particular by Russell's theory of Logical Atomism.\n\nWittgenstein on language\n\nThe only means at our disposal to study philosophy (and everything else), is through language, and so philosophers believe that language itself should be scrutinised because it provides the only means by which we can find knowledge\n\nBertrand Russell thought that ordinary language was confusing, but believed that if philosophical problems were presented in a logically precise way, then we could solve them. Wittgenstein was interested in Russell's ideas, and as an undergraduate, he continued Russell's work by examining the relationship between logic and language.\n\nPicture Theory\n\nInitially, Wittgenstein held that words represented actual things in the external world, either objects or states of affairs, and felt that any statement which did not directly correspond to an event or an object in the real world, was meaningless. You can see how he was influenced by Russell in this.\n\nWittgenstein termed this rather reductionist approach to language 'picture theory,' and held that a proposition was only true when objects in the world corresponded exactly to the words that described them.\n\nPropositions make claims about the world e.g. 'I am in the classroom'. Names e.g. 'classroom' stand for elements of reality, and by combining these names in different ways, we can 'picture' a corresponding state of affairs.\n\nOr, in other words, objects and states of affairs are 'pictured' by the words we use to represent them. Therefore, for Wittgenstein, if we are not using language to describe the world then we 'must remain silent'.\n\nSo for Wittgenstein, 'the cat sat on the mat' would be a meaningful statement because every word in that sentence corresponds to an object or a state of affairs in the world. The statement 'God loves us' would hold no meaning for Wittgenstein because there is nothing concrete that you can find in the world that corresponds with the words 'God' or 'love'.\n\nWittgenstein's Change of Mind\n\nWittgenstein then left Cambridge University in order to work on his own ideas. He started to question the theories that he had originally held dear, and eventually came to reject them completely. He realised that even statements that did not correspond to an event or an object in the world could still have meaning, and he saw that his earlier 'picture theory' had been far too limited and simplistic.\n\nLanguage Games\n\nWittgenstein accepted that we understand the world through language, but felt that language itself was limited. He realised that statements such as 'God loves us' still have meaning, even if the words in the proposition did not directly correspond to objects in the real world.\n\nHe used the analogy of pain to illustrate his new thesis. He realised that the feeling of pain was entirely subjective and that no one could ever access your own, entirely unique, experience of it, or you theirs. However he also realised that there was some common understanding of what being in pain meant, and that even though we could not directly access each other's minds, we could still understand what we meant when we talked about the things that we held in common.\n\nWittgenstein adapted his philosophy significantly and formulated the theory of 'language games'. He realised that language was not in fact truly objective, and did not merely represent 'real' things, but was itself a product of our social and cultural experiences.\n\nLanguage is a tool, a way of expressing meaning, and Wittgenstein's earlier mistake had been to understand words as reflecting real things. By understanding the language ‘games’ that we play, we can come to understand the meaning of words like 'God', 'soul', 'love' etc. These words may not correspond directly to an object in the real world, but they still have meaning for people who participate in the language game of religion, or emotion, or science etc.\n\nWittgenstein argued that we cannot understand language without understanding the ways in which language is used, and how it interacts with our lives. He compared language to games because he saw that language is an activity that, like games, is also guided by rules. If you understand the rules then you can play the 'game', if you don't understand the rules then the words become meaningless. For example, if you watch a football match and understand the rules of the game then you can make sense of what is happening on the pitch. If you don't understand the rules, then you will see the same event (people running around and kicking a ball), but you won't really understand what is happening. In the same way, if you are a religious person and talk of 'prayer' or 'resurrection' etc with another religious person, those words will hold a mutually understood meaning. An atheist is not going to be able to 'play the game,' and so these words will hold no meaning for them.\n\nI love the fact that Wittgenstein had a change of heart and realised that his earlier ideas had been wrong. I also really admire him for going against the grain of Logical Positivism (which was all the rage at the time) to come up with his own original theories. Wittgenstein has a reputation for being an arrogant, difficult and fiery man, but I think the fact that he was able to hold his hand up and admit to his 'error' is proof of his humility, at least in intellectual terms. Another great man to whom the modern world owes a huge amount- I hope you've enjoyed finding out a bit more about him.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDerek Jarman (dir.) 'Wittgenstein' (1993) this is a cracking film but really hard to get hold of now. You can find clips of it on YouTube and it's worth a watch as Wittgenstein's ideas are explained really well. The original screenplay was written by Terry Eagleton and Wittgenstein was played by Karl Johnson.\n\nRay Monk 'The Duty of Genius' (1991) the best biography of Wittgenstein and a wonderful read.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein 'Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus' (1922)\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein 'Philosophical Investigations' (1953) (not for the faint-hearted!)\n\nAbout me\n\nII’m a thought leadership consultant and content writer.
