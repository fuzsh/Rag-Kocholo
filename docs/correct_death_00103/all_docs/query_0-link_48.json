        "text": "It is the contention of this volume that only on the basis of generalised technology can we begin to approach the phenomenon of language in its broadest sense. Integrating conceptual approaches from both continental & analytic philosophy, LITERATE TECHNOLOGIES demonstrates that any system of sign operations, in which an event of transmission or transcription can be said to take place, is technological & that all technology is poetic before it is technical. At the same time, this universalising aspect of a ‘technopoetics’ appears as a constellation-effect, bridging the entire field of scientific discourse–from atomic and molecular structures to the transcriptive coding and decoding processes of DNA; from the evolving neural structures of the human brain to computing programmatics and artificial intelligence; from simple binary procedures to the most complex topologies–which is thus also to say, the entire 'textual' field.\n\nTracing a nominal genealogy, from Robert Fludd’s “Et sic in infinitum,” to The Life & Opinions of Tristram Shandy, to Finnegans Wake, to Georges Perec’s La Disparition & beyond, it’s possible to speak of a “poetics” of constitutive erasure that comes to generalize itself, not as a literary device, but as a textual condition—whose theoretical elaboration is paradigmatic of the so-called poststructuralist turn: exemplified in the section of Jacques Derrida’s De la grammatologie entitled “Writing Before the Letter” (1967) & the closely related essay “La différance” (1968). Like Malevich’s Black Square (1915), Fludd’s mimēsis of nothingness in Utriusque Cosmi (1617) & Lawrence Sterne’s “black page” (from one of the foundation texts of the modern novel; 1768-9), pose questions about the representation of the negative & the limits of signification wherever writing pushes into the domain of asemic interference. In the case of Joyce’s portmanteau (emergent lexicality or lexical fusions: “word, letter, paperspace”) & Perec’s lipogrammes (systematic lexical omissions), this question of representation is literalised in the operations of inscription itself—as the complementary counterpart of that work of “erasure” seemingly depicted by “blacking-out.”\n\nTable of Content 1.

Hegel’s Analysis Situs:Topological Notions of Multiplicity in Hegel’s Fourfold of Infinities, 2014, Abstract. 7. Topology, Homeomorphism and Literature: Topological James Joyce – Finnegans Wake\n\nMuch has been written on Joyce's use of portmanteau and pun in Finnegans Wake. Building on Joyce's reference to “the etym” in the Wake and relating it to the Lucretian linguistics adopted by such avant-garde conceits as Alfred Jarry's ’Pataphysics and Steve McCaffery's writing, I analogically regard ’Pataphysics as the literary equivalent of physics. Jarry considers Lucretius's clinamen (which is the “swerve” created during atomic collisions) as a fundamental aspect of poetical creativity; this combined with Joyce's etym can yield an “etymic theory” that can approach texts such as Finnegans Wake which so epitomize postmodern concerns of grammatology.\n\nINCENDIARY DEVICES: DISCOURSES OF THE OTHER examines the material structures of language and subjectivity, and addresses the fundamental questions of how meaning happens. Taking the form of a close critique of the ideas of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, INCENDIARY DEVICES also comprises an extensive engagement with the writings of Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger. In addition to these core concerns, Armand’s critical itinerary includes the work of Heiner Müller, James Joyce, Philippe Sollers, William Shakespeare, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. “Armand’s critique of Lacan provides a post-Heideggerean thesis that remains alert to important limitations in Heidegger’s thinking, limitations that have been exposed with great subtlety by Derrida … Unlike Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, who in their ground-breaking The Title of the Letter had concluded in the early seventies that Lacan’s concepts could not make sense in a Heideggerean perspective, Armand shows that they do.” —Jean-Michel Rabaté\n\nThe paper examines phonetic aspects of Finnegans Wake arguing that Joyce managed to achieve intertextuality even on that level of his novel. Even though the phoneme is the smallest unit of language, and its features are even smaller signifiers, they are carrying meanings that refer to entire classical works of literature. The paper also gives review of devices used in structuralist and post-structuralist approaches to phoneme in order to point towards the Wake's reference to them.\n\nCritical interpretations of Joyce’s discourse on the image have, for the best part, fallen into two categories: idealist or psychoanalytic interpretations of the Joycean imaginary on the one hand, and, on the other, materialist readings often informed by techno-scientific concerns. Different as they are, both these critical paradigms regard the image as a space of dialectical mediation: a means, technical or transcendental, by which an object is given to perception (or a narcissistic subject to self-recognition). This article offers a new point of entry to the issue by recasting Joyce’s discourse on the image in a Deleuzian light. In Deleuze, the image is described as an entity existing between the material and the ideal spheres, but in no way functioning as a synthesis of the two. My contention is that through a Deleuzian reading of the discourse on images mobilized in Joyce’s fiction — from Dubliners to Finnegans Wake — it is possible to think of the image not as a medium of representation, but as an originary element of being and reality in its own right."
