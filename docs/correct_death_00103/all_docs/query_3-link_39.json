        "text": "In a terse comment entirely typical of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein says that 'Our life has no end in just the way in which our visual field has no limit' (6.4311). The analogy contained in Wittgenstein's remark should be understood as follows: Our visual field has no limit in the sense that there is no seeable bound to the visual field. Try as I may, I cannot see the limit, for to see something is to place it in the visual field, which would necessarily place it within the limits of the field. It could not, therefore, be the limit itself.\n\nOf course, saying that, from the point of view of sight simpliciter, the visual field has no limit is not to say that the visual field is not limited in any sense. I infer, quite consistently with the fact that I cannot see the limit of the visual field, that my visual field is limited in a different sense (hereinafter called 'limited*') by, for instance, making inferences from the manner in which things appear in my visual field, as well as from evidence obtained from the other senses. That is, as things pop into and out of my visual field with some measure of consistency and coherence, it becomes useful to account for such intermittence by holding that, somehow, these things persist outside of my immediate field of vision. And because I can add to this evidence of the existence of such things from the other senses, the firm conclusion that my visual field is limited* is easily drawn.\n\nPressing the analogy, then, if my life has no end in just the way that my visual field has no limit, then it must be in the sense that I can have no experience of death [as an event: GLT], conceived as the complete cessation of experience and thought. That is, if life is considered to be a series of experiences and thoughts [events: GLT], then it is impossible for me to experience death [as an event], for to experience something is to be alive, and hence to be inside the bound formed by death [as an event: GLT].\n\nHolding that my life has no end in this sense is perfectly consistent with the belief that I will die [that this event will occur: GLT], in the same way that holding that my visual field has no (seeable) limit is perfectly consistent with the belief that my visual field is limited*. For just as I have grounds other then sight for believing that my visual field is limited*, I have grounds other than thought and experience as such for the belief that I will permanently cease to think and experience. I might, for instance, arrive at such a belief by realizing that I experience, from time to time, bodies which have ceased to function physiologically. From this I infer, on the basis of the analogy which I draw to my own (physiological) self, that I too will cease to function physiologically [that this event will occur: GLT][that the event of my death will occir: GLT]. Then on the basis of the belief that certain physiological functions are necessary for the occurrence of thought and experience, I infer that I will cease to think and experience, i.e. that I will die in this particular sense."
