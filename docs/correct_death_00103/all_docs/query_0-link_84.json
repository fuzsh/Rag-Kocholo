He was educated at Aylesbury Grammar School and at Selwyn College, Cambridge.\n\nHis book [http://www.rbphilo.com/projval.html Projects & Values] (2006) argues for a foundationalist virtue ethic, against the background of a structured approach to the cultural relativity of value-concepts and a conception of the human subject that is inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein. He has also published articles in \"Philosophy Now\" (February 2006) and in \"Ethical Record\" (July 2005 and May 2006)."
