Helmer Tony Bui, hotly pursued since winning this year’s Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize and audience award for his “Three Seasons,” is readying two scripts that he will direct.

Both are expected to be completed early next year.

He’s adapting “The World I Made for Her,” a novel by Thomas Moran concerning a man dying in an intensive care unit and the metaphysical relationship between him and his nurse.

“It’s an exquisite love story,” said Nick Wechsler, co-chairman of Industry Entertainment, the management and production company that will produce the pic. “It’s about people in different states of consciousness. The incredible imagery Tony created for each of the three parts of ‘Three Seasons’ makes him a perfect fit for this material.”

Industry Entertainment’s David Carmel and Margaret Riley brought the book to Bui, who is not an Industry client. Carmel and Industry’s Julia Chasman will produce; Wechsler and Riley will exec produce. New Line will have first crack at the project under its deal with Industry.

Bui’s other project is an untitled script from an original idea. Reps say it is “under lock and key in his head.” It falls under Bui’s two-pic deal with USA Films, which released “Seasons” in April.

Oscar entry

“Seasons” is Vietnam’s submission for the Foreign Language Academy Award. The U.S.-Vietnamese co-production lensed in Vietnam.

Bui is repped by CAA and attorney Carlos Goodman at Lichter, Grossman, Nichols & Adler.
