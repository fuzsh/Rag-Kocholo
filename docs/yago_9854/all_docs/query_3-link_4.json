In addition to Breeds and Sheehan, the film has a large ensemble cast including Magda Szubanski, Michael Caton, Deborah Mailman, Jacqueline McKenzie and John Waters.[4]\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the Melbourne International Film Festival on 12 August 2017,[5] and was released nationally in Australia on 2 November.[6]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film's main plotline revolves around a blossoming romance between its two leads, pretentious theremin player Roland (Robert Sheehan) and down-to-earth pub band fiddler Keevy (Rebecca Breeds)\n\nThe film also has a subplot about a racist bigot (played by Michael Caton) meeting a refugee boy and a group of Indigenous dancers and is re-educated.\n\nThe film contains several running gags, revolving around feminist singer Diamond and her renditions of classic Australian songs and poems, two middle-aged couples who at first seem nice and clean but are actually swingers, a girl band trio vowing to stay together but then two of the three quit, and a stern security guard who upholds the rules.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert Sheehan as Roland\n\nRebecca Breeds as Keevey\n\nJohn Waters as Eamon\n\nDeborah Mailman as Pam\n\nKelton Pell as Jack\n\nJacqueline McKenzie as Professor Wellborn\n\nMagda Szubanski as Queenie\n\nMichael Caton as Henry\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThree Summers was filmed in the Peel region of Perth, Western Australia in 2016.[7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 54% of critics reviewed the film positively, with an average score of 4.6/10, based on 13 reviews.[8]\n\nDavid Stratton of The Australian wrote, \"The film is worth seeing for Waters, giving a spirited portrayal of a loving father set in his ways and unable to see that times are changing, and Breeds as his lively, talented, worldly wise daughter.\"[9]\n\nConversely, Sandra Hall of the Sydney Morning Herald argued, \"It's a relentlessly well-meaning film and when it's not proselytising, it's working very hard to manufacture enough laughs to make the whole mix palatable. However, the effort shows.\"[10]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
