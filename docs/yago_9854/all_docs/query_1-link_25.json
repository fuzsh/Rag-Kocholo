        "text": "The Sundance Film Festival has drawn to a close with a clutch of films honoured in its annual awards.\n\nThe movie Three Seaons has emerged as this year's winner of the Sundance Grand Jury Prize for best dramatic film and the Audience Award for best drama.\n\nThe 26-year-old director Tony Bui said: \"I didn't think anything like this would happen coming in. It's amazing. Amazing.\"\n\nThe film was inspired by Tony Bui's own experience - he and his family fled Vietnam shortly before the fall of Saigon when he was two-years-old.\n\nIt depicts the contrast between the traditions of old, pre-war Vietnam and modern day life in the country. Three Seasons is the first US movie shot there since the Vietnam War.\n\nThe film also won Lisa Rinzler the cinematographer award for a drama, giving it three trophies, more than any film at this year's festival.\n\nMaking a movie about making a movie\n\nThe other top award - the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary film - went to American Movie, which is set in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nAmerican Movie, directed by Chris Smith, follows the making of a low-budget movie by Milwaukee resident Mark Borchardt, who aspires to be a filmmaker but has to hustle for every penny he can get to realise his vision.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that a film about a guy scraping by in Milwaukee, made by two guys scraping by in Milwaukee, would end up here,\" Smith said when accepting his award.\n\nSundance is the premiere venue for independent films in the US and is held annually at Park City near Salt Lake City by Robert Redford's Sundance Institute. Success there can mean overnight celebrity for a filmmaker.\n\nRecent award winners include Welcome to the Dollhouse, The Brothers McMullen, and Unzipped.\n\nOther awards\n\nAltogether 16 films competed in the drama category. Gavin O'Connor's Tumbleweeds, about a women's search for independence, was given the Filmmaker's Trophy for a drama, which is decided by the film-makers in the competition.\n\nThe director's award for a drama went to Eric Mendelsohn for Judy Berlin.\n\nThe audience award for a documentary went to Genghis Blues, by Roko Belic, about blues music legend Paul Pena.\n\nThe Filmmakers Trophy for documentary went to Sing Faster: The Stagehands' Ring Cycle, wjich chronicles the staging of the 17- hour opera Ring Cycle by the San Francisco Opera.\n\nBarbara Sonneborn won the directors award for a documentary for Regret to Inform, another film about the effects of the Vietnam War.\n\nOther winners included a Special Jury Prize for a comedic performance to Steve Zahn for his work in Happy, Texas about two prison escapees who masquerade as a gay couple in a small Texas town to avoid the law.\n\nScreenwriter awards went to Audrey Wells for Guinevere and Frank Whaley for Joe the King.\n\nThe Freedom of Expression Award for addressing social or political issues was won by The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords."
