        "text": "Reconciliation plays dual role in 'Seasons'\n\n(Out of 4 stars)\n\nDirected and written by: Tony Bui\n\nPhotography by: Lisa Rinzler\n\nStarring: Harvey Keitel, Don Duong, Nguyen Ngoc Hiep, Tran Manh Cuong, Zoe Bui, Nguyen Huu Duoc.\n\nRunning time: 1 hour, 53 minutes\n\nRating: PG-13, for mild violence, adult sexual situations.\n\nDistributed by: October Films; in Vietnamese with English subtitles.\n\nOpens: Today at the Mayan Theatre\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nMay 14 - \"Three Seasons'' is a film about reconciliation. That's reflected both in its narrative and the story behind its production.\n\nThis is the first feature from 26year-old Tony Bui, who left Vietnam for California back in 1975 at the age of 2. His father was in the American-backed South Vietnamese military, which didn't bode well for the family's future in Saigon once the North Vietnamese were about to win the war.\n\nBut he returned to visit relatives and became interested in making a movie there. This is the result - the first American feature shot in Vietnam since that war ended. Except for Harvey Keitel, it uses Vietnamese actors speaking in their native language. Debuting at this year's Sundance Film Festival, it won the top award for dramatic features. It has a subtle narrative that is poetic but also chilly and distancing. But it investigates the nature of reconciliation - with the past, with love, with peace - in today's Saigon. Bui quietly observes several alienated people trying to find joy and a measure of peace in a city that still bears much sadness. It is an unbelievably beautiful film to watch, with its gloriously intense color, cinematography and lighting.\n\nOne character is a morose American (Keitel), a former soldier searching for the daughter he fathered while stationed in Vietnam. There are Teacher Dao (Manh Cuong), a master poet who hides in shadows because of leprosy, and the young woman (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep) who tentatively befriends him after being hired to pick the lotuses in the lake surrounding his temple.\n\nIn the city itself, an impoverished cyclo driver (Don Duong) saves a stylish, Westernized prostitute (Zoe Bui, not related to the director) from angry clients and then tries to win her love. And a street urchin named Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc) walks a rainy, dark Saigon looking for the lost suitcase of trinkets he sells to tourists.\n\nBui interweaves these stories with competence if not vivacity - there is a fait accompli aspect to it all that evades psychological complexity and emotional surprise. As much as they are individuals, the characters are archetypes. To some extent, the film's influences - recent Chinese movies, as well as \"The Bicycle Thief'' - show too much. And a plot twist or two, like a cyclo race, are forced. But overall, the characters' experiences do ring true. And Bui moves them all toward touching reconciliations.\n\nAs this happens, we are transfixed by the magnificently observ ed details of a city we haven't seen on the screen in a long time. Lisa Rinzler did the outstanding cinematography; she also won an award at the Sundance Film Festival. Especially memorable are her images of women in canoes gathering the lotus flowers. Perspective is manipulated so that depth appears both vertical and horizontal, changing from shot to shot.\n\nSaigon is a metropolis that is crumbling and dilapidated in parts, where soldiers still patrol neighborhoods at dark. But it also is a place illuminated by the same neon advertising signs one might see in New York or London - Maxell and the ubiquitous Coca-Cola. And people sit in chairs along a sidewalk to watch a portable TV. There are even plastic lotuses for sale - tacky-tourism products sprout like resilient weeds.\n\nRichard Horowitz's score, which combines traditional music with melodic, modernist classical themes, is outstanding. And Vy Nhat Tao contributed haunting Vietnamese songs.\n\nThere is another aspect of reconciliation to \"Three Seasons.'' It is an American-independent movie and a foreign film with subtitles. In recent years, American indies have chased foreign-language films out of art theaters. If \"Three Seasons'' proves as popular in theaters as it was at Sundance, it will bring these two kinds of films together, for the good of everyone."
