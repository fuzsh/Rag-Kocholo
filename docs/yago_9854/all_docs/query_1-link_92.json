Guests were treated to a Texas BBQ catered by the James Beard-nominated Blood Bros. BBQ from Houston, sponsored by the Texas Beef Council, where filmmakers, creatives, industry and community leaders and supporters networked. Gift bags were handed out which included a special journal for Lunar New Year’s Year of the Dragon. Notable guests included Los Angeles-based celebrity chef and James Beard winner, Chef Susan Feniger, Sundance alumni filmmaker Tony Bui, and San Francisco Film Commissioner Jack Song.\n\nCaption: “Asian Texan BBQ Night” hosts and Blood Bros.

APFE was honored to return to Sunrise, where our event concluded the weekend at the Sunrise Collective House on Sunday, January 21, 2024.\n\nCaption: Actor, producer and APFE Leader Minji Chang welcomes guests to the APFE 20th Edition event at the Sunrise Collective House at Sundance 2024.

Photo Credit: Andrew Ge.\n\nFollowing that, APFE presented a panel discussion reflecting on the progress made by AANHPI filmmakers over the last few decades, recognizing the trailblazers along the way, and looking ahead to the next generation of filmmakers. The panel, moderated by acclaimed producer Nina Yang Bongiovi, featured veteran and emerging AAPI filmmakers Tony Bui (Director, Three Seasons), Ramona Diaz (Director, And So It Begins), and Luciane Buchanan (Screenwriter/Actor, Lea Tupu’anga/Mother Tongue).\n\nCaption: Acclaimed producer Nina Yang Bongiovi with filmmakers Tony Bui, Ramona Diaz and Luciane Buchanan, speak on the Filmmakers Forum at the APFE 20th Edition event at the Sunrise Collective House at Sundance 2024.

They spoke about the groundbreaking moment when the film premiered at Sundance 2002 leading to the film’s enduring legacy and its overarching influence on the trajectory of the current AANHPI filmmaking movement. Milton Liu, filmmaker, APFE leader and Executive Director of the Asian American Media Alliance, moderated.\n\nCaption: Filmmaker, APFE Leader and Executive Director (AAMA), Milton Liu moderates special fireside chat with actor and filmmaker Sung Kang and veteran film publicist and Peabody Award Winner David Magdael, at the APFE 20th Edition event at the Sunrise Collective House at Sundance 2024. Photo Credit: Andrew Ge.\n\n“He was like Moses… he defended us,” said Kang, remembering the pivotal moment when the late, revered film critic Roger Ebert stood up and countered criticism from an audience member who said the film did not portray Asian Americans in a positive light, which went against the stereotype of Asian Americans being a ‘model minority.’\n\nMagdael went on to describe what happened next, “…we got it on tape and spent the night duping VHS tapes and we sent the tapes to every press outlet… it was a true Sundance moment for an ally to stand up… it sparked us and got us excited!” Kang added, “MTV bought the film… and Jon M. Chu (Director, Crazy Rich Asians) was in the front row at the Park City Library in 2002 for the BLT screening when it all went down… we didn’t know that this small film would have an impact but Jon said is was then that he decided to become a filmmaker…” Following the theme of wins, Liu added “….we need to celebrate our wins for hope, we can not be jaded like, ‘I didn’t get into Sundance’,” and Liu closed by reminding the full house that “…we have to be at the table and our stories need to be told… this is what the late U.S. Secretary and AAMA’s first ChairNorman Mineta said…”, on the importance of AANHPI inclusion in entertainment and media.\n\nPresentation of the 2024 Irene Cho Pioneer Award\n\nAPFE closed out the Sunrise House ending with the presentation of the 2024 Irene Cho Award, which is named in honor of one of the original founders of APFE, filmmaker and Asian American storytelling advocate – who passed away unexpectedly in 2017. Given in Cho’s memory to an artist, creator or industry leader who exemplifies the mission of the organization in supporting AANHPI filmmakers in all aspects from resource building, networking, consulting and inspiration. Past recipients include Kim Yutani (Director of Programming – Sundance Film Festival), Nina Yang Bongiovi (Producer/Partner – Significant Productions) and Jean Tsien (Film producer, Emmy Award winner “76 Days” and Oscar nominee “Scottsboro: An American Tragedy”). David Magdael was named this year’s recipient for his visionary work as a publicist, producer and social impact leader (see award below).\n\nCaption: APFE Founder, veteran film publicist and Peabody Award Winner David Magdael receives the 2024 Irene Cho Award from APFE Leaders at the APFE 20th Edition event at the Sunrise Collective House at Sundance 2024.

Hosted by The Asian Pacific Filmmakers Experience, in partnership with the Asian American Media Alliance, Asians in Hollywood, CAPE, Kollaboration, David Magdael & Associates, and Visual Communications – the festive event was a full room until the very end.\n\nCaption: Guests stand outside a cold, snowy Sunday evening for the 20th Edition of APFE “Meet the Filmmakers” Reception at Alpine Distilling in Park City, Utah.
