        "text": "Netflix is probably the best licenser of content in the streaming space, at this point pulling things directly from rivals like Max. Now that has expanded to another formerly big pay-channel premium outlet, Showtime.\n\nWe have just seen eight full seasons of Dexter added to the service, the serial killer drama that started out strong, ended terribly, but sort of redeemed itself a bit with a much later comeback season (which is not on Netflix, and that is extremely unfortunate). But it’s another Showtime series that has caught my attention due to how well it’s performing, Your Honor.\n\nYour Honor is a Bryan Cranston drama which ran two seasons from 2020-2023, and it’s appeared on Netflix now as part of the Showtime licensing deal. It has been very high in the top 10 list since it arrived, and currently at #2 behind only Bridgerton season 3, which means it’s putting up big numbers\n\nFor reference, season 1’s high for Your Honor was about 700,000 viewers on Showtime on linear TV. It ended its run with less than that, about 400,000. Now? It’s no doubt in the millions, and it’s apparently not even that amazing? It has a 50% on Rotten Tomatoes from critics, and a 67% from audiences. But people see Bryan Cranston and after Breaking Bad? Yeah, they’re going to tune in. Here’s what the show is about:\n\n“Michael Desiato is a prominent and respected New Orleans judge. When his teenage son Adam kills another teenager in an accidental hit-and-run collision, Michael encourages his son to turn himself in, but quickly changes his mind when he discovers the boy his son killed was the son of a mob kingpin.”\n\nCool concept! Though it was adapted from an Israeli TV series so it’s not exactly fully original.\n\nWill Your Honor Get A Season 3?\n\nYour Honor was initially supposed to be a one-season miniseries, but it apparently did well enough for a second season. So what about…a season 3? Back in April 2023, Cranston had this to say about another one:\n\n“My comment was I’m not sure that there could be or there is,” Cranston said. “There is some discussion. Showtime has indicated there is interest and we’re very proud to know that every episode in Season 2 increased in the audience from the previous week. If it happens, fantastic but it’d have to be some great reason to keep expanding in this world and to find out where the allegiances are.”\n\nMy guess is that this level of performance on Netflix will really spark discussions about another season. If there was interest before this from Showtime (the show was performing that the higher-profile Yellowjackets, for starters) then there has to be a lot more now. The idea here may be that all this Netflix interest could drive more sign-ups for Showtime once a season 3 comes out, though given how this is playing out, that would be years from now.\n\nHowever, given the ending of the show, it’s not clear if Cranston would return given (spoilers) the series ends with his character in prison. But he said he would produce it, if nothing else.\n\nSo yes, I would say things seem promising for season 3 based on its current, surprising Netflix success. More to come, I imagine, so stay tuned.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram."
