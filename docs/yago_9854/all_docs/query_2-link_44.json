        "text": "Before you know it, the final episodes of Yellowstone will be here! In fact, news recently broke that production has started on Season 5, part 2 â€”and the cast is officially back on set! In a recent social media post from Cole Hauser, fans finally got a peek at the beautiful backdrop for the last season of the show. But before you get all emotional about your favorite Western-series coming to an end, let's take a trip down memory lane by highlighting all the Yellowstone filming locations through the years!\n\nOf course, the real star of the show is the gorgeous Dutton Ranch. It's set on sprawling fields with looming mountains and clear blue skies. But there are other points of interest, like Beth's office and scenes from in town. So, you might be wondering: Where exactly is Yellowstone filmed? And is the Dutton Ranch real? Before you get ready to binge-watch every single existing episode of Yellowstone (and shows like Yellowstone), here's everything you need to know about the Yellowstone filming locations.\n\nWhere is Yellowstone filmed?\n\nIt's no secret that the majority of Yellowstone is shot outdoors. The show is based around a working cattle ranch in Montana. But, surprisingly, most of seasons 1 to 3 were filmed in the state of Utah, where the actual Yellowstone National Park reigns. In fact, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that 70 to 75 percent of seasons 1 to 3 were filmed across the state of Utah. Marshall Moore, the VP of Operations over at Utah Film Studios, once told Deseret News that Yellowstone \"was the largest show that has ever come to the state of Utah.\"\n\nTo get a little more specific: Park City, Ogden, and Spanish Fork were all prominent locations for production of the show.\n\nThough, it's important to note that this information does not include scenes at the fictional Broken Rock Indian Reservation. Instead, these scenes were filmed at the Crow Indian Reservation, located in southern Montana. And if we're mapping it out, you'd be on the road for 7 hours when driving from the reservation to the show's ranch.\n\nThese days, the Yellowstone cast spends most of their time in Montana to film on a real-life ranch in the state where the show is meant to take place. And from the looks of it, cast members, like Hauser who plays Rip Wheeler, are back on Montana grounds to finish filming the last episodes.\n\n\"Good morning #montana Iâ€™ve missed ya old friend,\" Hauser wrote. \"If you are going to rise, you might as well shine.\"\n\nIs the Dutton Ranch real?\n\nYes! The Dutton family's gorgeous log cabin is actually a 5,000-square foot mansion located on near Darby, Montana. Just like on TV, it's a real working cattle ranch and family homeâ€”and it's totally stunning, of course.\n\n\"On the ranch, we're actually filming where it's actually set. It's almost like the most central character,\" Kevin Costner said in an interview with Vanity Fair. \"You step outside and you see running horses and men working and the weather dictates what you do.\"\n\nCan you visit the set of Yellowstone?\n\nOnce again, yes! When Yellowstone is not filming on the 2,500-acre ranch, the owners rent out some of the cabins on the property to visitors. Guests can spend their time fishing, horseback riding, and hiking through the area's beautiful mountains. (All while fantasizing about John Dutton showing up, of course.)\n\nIs Yellowstone filmed in both Texas and Montana?\n\nThat's right! Season 4 and season 5 part 1 stirred up plenty of new drama, but outside of that, did you notice the change of scenery from the first three seasons? According to The Salt Lake Tribune, season 4 was filmed almost exclusively in Montana. The decision to stop any production in Utah was largely financial, because the state's \"limited tax incentive program will not provide [the show] with the same rebates\" they previously received.\n\nThe same is to be said for season 5 as well. There were a handful of different Montana cities used in the first half of the most recent season (which aired back in November 2022). More specifically, Helena, Montanaâ€”the state's actual capitalâ€”was an important location used. This is where Bethâ€™s office scenes take place.\n\nThough, some scenes were also shot in Texas, too. Citizens of the southern state got surprise of a lifetime when the show's cast and crew showed up in their small town to shoot at a local cafe for season 4.\n\nMary Anderson, the owner of Mary's Brazos Cafe in Parker County, North Texas, \"couldn't believe it was actually happening.\"\n\n\"The street on the other side [of the cafe] was lined up with my customers watching and trying to see what was going on,\" Anderson told Outsider. \"It was awesome.\"\n\nWhen asked why he decided to film at Mary's, Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan told local news it was \"because that's where we have breakfast when I'm here.\""
