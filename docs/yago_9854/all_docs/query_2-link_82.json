        "text": "It’s a sad week for Danger Force fans…\n\nThe Nickelodeon spinoff of Henry Danger has aired it’s final episode as the show comes to an end after three seasons on the network.\n\nCooper Barnes and Michael D Cohen reprised their roles, and were joined in the series by new young stars Havan Flores, Terrence Little Gardenhigh, Dana Heath and Luca Luhan. Henry Danger himself, Jace Norman, made several guest appearances.\n\nSeries director and producer Mike Caron, as well as members of the cast confirmed the show was ending with emotional posts on social media.\n\nKeep reading to learn more…\n\nDanger Force was first announced in February 2020, and the third season first premiered in April 2023, before the final episode aired earlier this week.\n\nIf you recall, this is not the end of Henry Danger, though, as there is a movie in the works with Jace Norman. He also recently shared a photo outside of Paramount Studios, writing, “Oh we cookin … don’t worry 🌊🎬🇺🇸”\n\nIn Mike‘s post, he actually revealed that they filmed the series finale over a year ago, in December 2022!\n\nCheck out all of the posts about the show ending below…\n\nCooper Barnes wrote, “Goodbye, Studio 11. Thanks for all the great memories. To Dana, Terrence, Luca and Havan- thanks for spending a big chunk of your childhood with me, and for being so talented and funny. It wasn’t always easy, and life certainly threw its challenges at us, but we persevered and made a lot of people happy during our nation’s darkest time. I’m very proud of that, and I’m very proud of you. To everyone involved, from the imaginative writers, the wonderful guest stars, the tenacious producers, the best crew in town, the folks at the network who saw the potential of this world… I am incredibly grateful for all of you. And to the fans, who have poured so much love and dedication into this universe all this time- none of this could’ve happened without you. It has been such a privilege to play #CaptainMan for 9 amazing years. What a ride. I love Ray so much, and I hope you’re as happy for him (and where we leave him in this finale) as I am. All good things must eventually end. But this world, these characters, live on in your hearts, and in mine. And I’d be very surprised if we didn’t meet again one day. So let’s not call it the end. Let’s just call it goodbye, for now. 💙❤️#DangerForce”\n\nMichael D Cohen shared, “Did you watch the last episode of @henrydangerforce last night? What did you think of our epic finale? Many thanks to the whole crew for an amazing run. Special thanks to my fellow cast members @therealcooperbarnes @littlegardenhigh @missdanaheath #havaflores #lucaluhan and of course @ceejaynowak for inventing the premise, @mikecaron_la @jakefarrow @robynnotrobin and so many more writers and crew… too many to name. See you on the streaming side ❤️”\n\nDana Heath captioned her post, “Well… this is it. If you would have told me that 5 years ago I would be a superhero on Nickelodeon, I wouldn’t have been able to believe it. Sometimes I still don’t. I can’t even put into words how freaking grateful I am for this experience. For all the friends and family I’ve made because of it. Thank you @ceejaynowak for believing in me from the beginning to the end. Thank you @mikecaron_la for always making me laugh and cry lol. Couldn’t have made it through without you. Thank you @therealcooperbarnes and @michaeldcohen for shaping my personality and sense of humor, As well as being so welcoming and taking me under your wings when I was 13. Thank you my dearest twin @littlegardenhigh I couldn’t have asked for a better brother. To the amazing Crew, Production, Casting and Writers, thank you for making this show as amazing as you did. And for giving me the honor to work with you on this project. And thank you to everyone who supported and watched me grow throughout the years. Without you guys watching the episodes every time it aired, making edits and art, and loving the characters as much as you do… there wouldn’t be a show. Mika will always hold a special place in my heart. All I’ve ever wanted was to make kids happy. And we did. Thank you. So so much.”\n\nTerrence Little Gardenhigh wrote, “After last night’s episode, I just had to post my last day. I am so grateful and appreciative of the family I had on this set! It was life changing and life learning. You all helped me grow up, and I had to do it fast sometimes, but i don’t regret a thing!!. Danger Force is done, but I’m not!😂 This is just the beginning! Look out world here, I come!!✊🏿💪🏿🙏🏿💯🔥🔥🔥”"
