        "text": "The Bear Season 3 released this summer — here’s everything we know, from reviews to cast details, plot, and more.\n\nKitchen dramas were all the rage in Hollywood for a short while. Vicious hierarchies, scathing insults, and high-pressure settings made audiences hungry for more. But of all the shows on the menu, there’s been none more beloved than the tale of a dysfunctional family-run restaurant in Chicago.\n\nThe Bear has since grown in popularity and earned some of the biggest praise around. When it comes to culinary dramas, it’s one of the best TV shows around. Now, with Emmy Awards and Golden Globes under its name, The Bear Season 3 turned up the heat.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new season, from updates on The Bear cast to its summer 2024 release and more. Bon appetit!\n\nThe Bear Season 3 released at 9pm ET/6pm PT on June 26, 2024. All ten episodes arrived in one swoop, and a couple of hours earlier than originally planned, too.\n\nThe decision to continue the trend of all episodes coming at once was shared by FX chairman John Landgraf at the TCA Winter Tour on February 9, who explained [via Decider]: “The way that Chris [Storer] makes it, even though the episodes are separate, there’s a whole vibe to every season so we decided not to change what we had already set in motion and I have no doubt that we’ll keep doing it because we did it in the past. Even if we could, I don’t think we’d change it now.”\n\nOn March 14, a source revealed to Variety that there would also be a fourth season and that it would film back-to-back with Season 3. However, FX hasn’t confirmed anything, so take this with a pinch of salt.\n\nWho’s in the cast?\n\nThe Bear Season 3 saw the return of Jeremy Allen-White, Ayo Edebiri, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as the leading trio of the show: Carmy, Sydney, and Richie.\n\nThe Bear guest stars also flocked back, including Molly Gordon as Carmy’s love interest Claire, Jamie Lee Curtis as Carmy’s mother Donna, and Jon Bernthal as Mikey.\n\nThe Bear Season 3 cast:\n\nJeremy Allen-White as Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto\n\nAyo Edebiri as Sydney Adamu\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as Richard “Richie” Jerimovich\n\nAbby Elliott as Natalie “Sugar” Berzatto\n\nLionel Boyce as Marcus\n\nLiza Colón-Zayas as Tina\n\nMatty Matheson as Neil Fak\n\nEdwin Lee Gibson as Ebraheim\n\nOliver Platt as Uncle Jimmy\n\nMolly Gordon as Claire\n\nChris Witaske as Pete\n\nJosh Hartnett as Frank\n\nJohn Cena as Sammy\n\nJamie Lee Curtis as Donna Berzatto\n\nJohn Mulaney as Stevie\n\nJon Bernthal as Mikey Berzatto\n\nWill Poulter as Luca\n\nOlivia Colman as Chef Terry\n\nBrian Koppelman as ‘Computer’\n\nJoel McHale as ‘NYC Chef’\n\nThe Bear Season 3 plot\n\nSeason 3 follows the fallout of Carmy’s rift with Claire, the aftermath of Marcus’ missed call from his mother’s nurse, and the continued mission to make the restaurant profitable.\n\nThe Bear’s opening night goes so well; everyone loves the food, and Sydney’s father finally believes that this is “the thing.” Richie’s found his sense of purpose. Tina is a confident sous-chef, Ebraheim is perfect for the takeaway window, and Uncle Jimmy’s financial investment is looking up.\n\nBut things go very wrong for Carmy, who gets locked in the walk-in fridge and ends up speaking his mind a little too loudly, essentially confessing to Claire that he doesn’t want to spend time with her. While they’re definitely split up for now, there could be plans to reconcile down the line.\n\nMarcus is the biggest worry. As he relished The Bear’s success, he wasn’t paying attention to his phone… which was full of texts from his mother’s carer. Based on a particular filming location for the new season, we assumed she passed away while he’s been pursuing his passion, which will no doubt fuel his guilt.\n\nAyo Edebiri also made her directorial debut with Episode 6.\n\nThe Bear Season 3 trailer\n\nA trailer for The Bear Season 3 was released on May 29, 2024.
