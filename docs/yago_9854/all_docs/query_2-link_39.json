        "text": "The Lincoln Lawyer is officially on its way to Netflix for season three – and the new episodes are just weeks away.\n\nThe second season of the hit legal drama saw the episodes split into a two-part release, with a major cliffhanger to keep fans ticking over during the lull, as Mickey faced his toughest case yet.\n\nSo what does The Lincoln Lawyer have in store for us with season three? We're here to break down everything you need to know about the much-loved adaptation on Netflix.\n\nIs The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 coming back in 2024?\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer season three will bring 10 new episodes and is set to arrive on Netflix on October 17 – so not long to wait now.\n\nThe streaming giant confirmed the good news in a tweet, alongside a set of stills from the upcoming season.\n\nWho will be part of The Lincoln Lawyer season 3's cast?\n\nWhen The Lincoln Lawyer returns, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo will be back as attorney extraordinaire Mickey Haller and be joined by close aide and Lincoln expert Izzy Letts, played by Jazz Raycole.\n\nOther cast members confirmed to be returning for season three are:\n\n• Becki Newton as Lorna Crane\n\n• Elliott Gould as David 'Legal' Siegel\n\n• Krista Warner as Hayley Haller\n\n• Fiona Rene as Gloria Dayton\n\n• Devon Graye as Julian La Cosse\n\n• Angus Sampson as Cisco Wojciechowski\n\n• Yaya DaCosta as Andrea Freeman\n\nThere were inklings that season two would be the last we saw of Neve Campbell – who plays Mickey's first wife Maggie McPherson – as her role was drastically reduced.\n\nHowever, some new first-look photos for the upcoming third season have confirmed her return.\n\nWe're also expecting some new faces in The Lincoln Lawyer season three, with cast announcements including:\n\n• Merrin Dungey (Big Little Lies), who will play Judge Regina Turner. Regina is a former public defender described as someone who's \"younger and more progressive than most judges in the district\".\n\n• Newcomer Allyn Moriyon will mark his TV debut as fitness enthusiast Eddie Rojas, who used to babysit Mickey's daughter Hayley. When Eddie requires a good lawyer, Mickey is on hand to support and also \"offers him the opportunity of a lifetime\".\n\n• John Pirruccello (Barry) is taking on the role of prosecutor William Forsythe, who Mickey faces in court. However, once the trial begins, it becomes clear that \"nothing is as it seems\".\n\n• Philip Anthony-Rodriguez (The Morning Show) has been cast as Chief Deputy District Attorney Adam Suarez, the superior of prosecutor Andrea Freeman.\n\nWhat will happen in The Lincoln Lawyer season 3?\n\nGiven the show is based on the Michael Connelly novels series of the same name – of which there are seven books – there certainly isn't a lack of source material for the show to draw its plot from.\n\nThe first season of the show drew on the second Connelly novel, The Reversal, given that the first novel had been adapted into a Matthew McConaughey film – so a third season will derive from the fourth novel.\n\nThe Gods of Guilt sees Mickey contacted by a client of yore who's in desperate need of his services. Mickey takes on the case of Andre La Cosse, despite the fact that he's accused of murdering a sex worker the attorney had previously tried to help.\n\nSharing the unique way they've decided to adapt the book, co-showrunners and executive producers Ted Humphrey and Dailyn Rodriguez told Deadline: \"While season three of The Lincoln Lawyer is based on Michael Connelly's novel The Gods of Guilt, we decided that a fun (and poignant) way to come into the season would be via a flashback sequence that gave us some insight into how Mickey Haller became Mickey Haller.\n\n\"Not just the brilliant criminal defence lawyer but the husband, the father, and the man that he would come to be.\n\n\"There is no comparable flashback in the book, so we devised something that would also serve as a fitting introduction to the story of the season, both on a plot level but also emotionally.\"\n\nIs there a trailer for The Lincoln Lawyer season 3?\n\nAlas, there isn't any new footage from The Lincoln Lawyer season three yet.\n\nBut given that we're inching ever closer to the release date now, we should have a sneak peek soon. As soon as a trailer comes down from Netflix on high, we'll put it into discovery for you."
