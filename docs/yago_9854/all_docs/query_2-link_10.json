        "text": "Netflix’s sci-fi series 3 Body Problem transports viewers on a mind-altering journey through different continents and timelines, from China during the Cultural Revolution to modern-day England to a virtual reality game. Now, viewers finally have an answer about the future of the existential series, including whether there will be a 3 Body Problem Season 2 and 3 on Netflix.\n\nFrom Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss and True Blood writer Alexander Woo, 3 Body Problem is based on Liu Cixin’s internationally acclaimed Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy. The first season primarily focuses on the first book of the same name while weaving in plot points and characters from The Dark Forest and Death’s End.\n\n3 Body Problem explores how “a young woman’s fateful decision in 1960s China reverberates across space and time to a group of brilliant scientists in the present day,” the Netflix synopsis reads. As the laws of nature unravel before their eyes, five former colleagues known as the Oxford Five — Jin Cheng (Jess Hong), Saul Durand (Jovan Adepo), Auggie Salazar (Eiza González), Jack Rooney (John Bradley), and Will Downing (Alex Sharp) — come together to confront the greatest threat in humanity’s history.\n\nThe cast also features Rosalind Chao as Ye Wenjie, Liam Cunningham as Thomas Wade, Marlo Kelly as Tatiana Haas, Sea Shimooka as Sophon, Zine Tseng as Young Ye Wenjie, Saamer Usmani as Raj Varma, Benedict Wong as Da Shi and Jonathan Pryce as Mike Evans.\n\nIn 3 Body Problem, the showrunners were challenged to convey complex scientific material like particle accelerators, computer programming, and astronomy. “Well none of us are physicists, which I think actually made us great guinea pigs for what could be understandable,” Woo said in an interview with Wired.\n\nHe continued, “In the novels, some of it can get quite abstruse. An advantage of the novel form is that you can read it at your own pace, you can slow down, you can go back, you can look things up on the internet. Ideally, in a television show you won’t have to do that: The whole show just flows in front of you, and the idea is presented in a way that you can digest whether you’re a physicist or not.”\n\nAfter the first season was released, the series climbed to the No. 1 spot and spent three weeks on Netflix’s Top 10 chart, reaching the Top 10 in 93 countries. Ready for more complex math problems, nanofiber technology, and the threat of alien invaders? Discover what’s in store for the next two seasons of 3 Body Problem below.\n\nWill There Be A 3 Body Problem Season 2 On Netflix?\n\nYes, Netflix has renewed 3 Body Problem for a second and third season. According to the streaming giant, the third season will be the show’s last, wrapping up the trilogy based on Liu Cixin’s bestselling sci-fi novels.\n\nBenioff, Weiss, and Woo recently confirmed that the series will be a trilogy during the official Television Academy 3 Body Problem panel at the Netflix FYSEE space in Los Angeles on May 31, 2024.\n\n“We included a lot of what we loved from the [novels by Cixin Liu] in Season 1, but the vast majority of reasons we wanted to make this show are in Season 2,” Weiss said, according to Netflix’s Tudum. “We always wanted to get to the final page of the third book, and it’s really, really thrilling to us that we will get to do just that.”\n\nThe confirmation comes after Netflix’s chief content officer, Bela Bajaria, first shared news of the renewal during the Netflix Upfront presentation on May 15. “Ever since we read the last page of Cixin Liu’s magnificent trilogy, we hoped we’d be able to bring the audience to the end of the universe with us. Here we go!” all three executive producers sad in a statement at the time.\n\nIn March, the showrunners told GamesRadar+’s “Inside Total Film” podcast that they were hopeful the series would be renewed for another season.\n\n“Well, there’s three novels in the trilogy. The novels get longer and longer so I wouldn’t say it maps out exactly to three,” Woo explained. “We have some really strong ideas about what to do in a season two, and then it’s a little hazier down the line. But we want to get to the end, we want to get to the end of the trilogy, and whether that’s three or four, you know, or some other number.”\n\nWoo continued, “The goal is to get to the end of the trilogy and it seems like it would map out over probably, certainly more than two seasons but beyond that, it’s hard to know exactly.”\n\nMeanwhile, co-creator D. B. Weiss said they were already planning further seasons. “We don’t have a second season, but we need to keep pushing forward full steam ahead as if we did,” he said before the renewal news. “Because if we do get a second season, we’ll need to hit the ground running in terms of pre-production and production to get it out to people in some kind of reasonable time. A show like this takes a long time to make and you can’t wait to get started thinking about it until somebody gives you the green light.”\n\n(Warning: Spoilers ahead for 3 Body Problem Season 1.)\n\nWhat Will Season 2 of 3 Body Problem Be About?\n\nThe second season of 3 Body Problem will likely pick up with Liu Cixin’s second book, The Dark Forest. The biggest plot point in Season 2 is San-Ti’s looming alien invasion, which is nearly half a millennium away. There’s also the newly founded Wallfacers program with Saul, who now has the world’s fate in his hands.\n\nIn the final scene of Season 1, Da Shi takes Jin and Saul to a marsh with swarms of cicadas. “People hate bugs, been trying to get rid of them forever,” Da Shi says. “Look around, they’re not going anywhere.” Da Shi also acknowledges they have work to do. “Let’s get back. We’ve got work to do,” he says, ending the first season on an open-ended note. (Read our full Season 1 ending explained article here.)\n\nThe Dark Forest synopsis reads: “Earth is reeling from the revelation of a coming alien invasion — four centuries in the future. The aliens’ human collaborators have been defeated but the presence of the sophons, the subatomic particles that allow Trisolaris instant access to all human information, means that Earth’s defense plans are exposed to the enemy. Only the human mind remains a secret.”\n\nThe description continues, “This is the motivation for the Wallfacer Project, a daring plan that grants four men enormous resources to design secret strategies hidden through deceit and misdirection from Earth and Trisolaris alike. Three of the Wallfacers are influential statesmen and scientists but the fourth is a total unknown. Luo Ji, an unambitious Chinese astronomer and sociologist, is baffled by his new status. All he knows is that he’s the one Wallfacer that Trisolaris wants dead.”\n\nBenioff told the Hollywood Reporter in January that the “second book is far better than the first, and the third book just completely blew my mind,” he revealed. “So I feel if we survive to the second season, we’re going to be in a good place. Things wildly escalate and there’s one scene, if we get to it, we’re golden—like when we got to the Red Wedding on Thrones.”\n\nWhat Will Season 3 of 3 Body Problem Be About?\n\nThe third season of 3 Body Problem will likely include elements and plot points from Book 3, Death’s End. Liu Cixin’s third installment is divided into a number of eras, each corresponding to a different stage in humanity’s advancement.\n\n“Now this epic trilogy concludes with Death’s End. Half a century after the Doomsday Battle, the uneasy balance of Dark Forest Deterrence keeps the Trisolaran invaders at bay. Earth enjoys unprecedented prosperity due to the infusion of Trisolaran knowledge,” Death End’s synopsis reads.\n\n“With human science advancing daily and the Trisolarans adopting Earth culture, it seems that the two civilizations will soon be able to co-exist peacefully as equals without the terrible threat of mutually assured annihilation. But the peace has also made humanity complacent.”\n\n3 Body Problem is also executive produced by Rian Johnson, Ram Bergman, and Nena Rodrigue for T-Street. Qi Lin, the late former Chairman of Yoozoo Group, and Jilong Zhao, CEO of rights-holder The Three-Body Universe, are executive producers, along with Xiaosong Gao and Lauren Ma. Plan B Entertainment's Brad Pitt, Jeremy Kleiner, and Dede Gardner are also executive producers. Additionally, Rosamund Pike and Robie Uniacke serve as executive producers for Primitive Streak.\n\nSeason 1 of 3 Body Problem is streaming on Netflix. Watch the official trailer below."
