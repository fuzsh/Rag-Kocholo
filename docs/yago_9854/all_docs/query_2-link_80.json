        "text": "I shill Psycho-Pass a lot. Like… a lot a lot. It remains my absolute favorite media franchise ever because it does so much. The only way it could be more custom-tailored for me is if all the protagonists were lesbians. The main conceit is that in future Japan, a system understood to be a machine network measures people’s character and psychological tendencies, and their ‘Hue’ determines their social standing (as well as job prospects) while their potential to commit criminal acts is summarized as the ‘Crime Coefficient’. In this dystopia, people found to have a crime coefficient above a certain number can be detained or executed on the spot by the police.\n\nOn the face of it, this sounds like ham-fisted commentary on state surveillance and police brutality. In execution, it’s written fantastically and is possibly the smartest cyberpunk I’ve ever seen in any medium. It has female protagonists through two seasons and two movies, and while I wish they’d let the women be more more in combat, the women are far from incompetent and rarely subjected to sexual threat.\n\nSince it began airing in 2012, it’s gotten a bit convoluted with three seasons and multiple movies that go between those seasons chronologically, so I’ve put together a watch guide.\n\nSeason 1. CW for sexual assault in episode one, graphic violence throughout the rest of the season (several instances of women being choked onscreen), notably ‘artwork’ made from dead girls’ corpses. Considered the best season, and also the longest. It has lesbians! They’re tertiary characters but I’ll take it. Streams on Netflix.\n\nSeason 2. CW for very graphic, quite grotesque violence. All of this is non-sexual but you may be very disturbed by the way a female inspector is abducted, tortured, and brainwashed; and a different female inspector is beaten up and stripped to her underwear. Body horror is fairly extensive, especially an instance where wealthy politicians keep a human zoo (disguised initially as animal holograms). One old woman is beaten th death. Streams on Netflix.\n\nPsycho-Pass: The Movie (2015). IMO the very best of what this franchise has to offer, taking the dystopian concept beyond the confines of its society and tackling the question of what it’d look like if a dystopian dictator system attempts to expand and export itself. The world outside Sibyl’s Japan has mostly devolved into war zones. The writers have read Fanon! It shows. A bit bluntly since one character literally quotes The Wretched of the Earth, but I’ll take it. The 2015 movie is when the art style begins to change a little, making the characters look less emaciated. This change carries through the rest of the subsequent material. Available to ‘rent’ or buy on Amazon.\n\nSinners of the System (2019). A film trilogy consisting of Case 1: Crime and Punishment, Case 2: First Guardian, and Case 3: In the Realm Beyond. A bit uneven but explores the setting well, and is incredibly and sharply political as ever. The film trilogy isn’t crucial but sets up why certain characters are back or have switched divisions in season 3. Content warning for attempted sexual assault in Crime and Punishment, where a woman attempts to assault a lesbian (so it is, at least, not a ‘corrective’ rape attempt).\n\nPsycho-Pass: Providence (2023). Yes, this is released later but its events take place before S3.\n\nSeason 3. This introduces an all-new cast and the new pair of protagonists, Kei Ignatov and Shindo Arata. Somewhat shaky and has production issues (which are presumably fixed in the blu-ray release), but sets up First Inspector. Content warning for transphobia, specifically that the one trans character is a trans man whose design is just bizarrely… ok, he’s drawn to look grotesque for absolutely no fucking reason (other than transphobia). I think he gets misgendered (hard to tell with Japanese, where it’s easy to keep sentences gender-neutral) and the script has other characters discussing his gender in pretty transphobic ways, talking about him as ‘a former woman’ (???) who took too much testosterone to become a better gladiator, so a lot of this lines up with transphobic bullshit. Er, and then he gets killed off, though at least his murder isn’t related to his gender. There’s also anti-immigrant discrimination and brutality, which form a core theme of this season as Sibyl has opened Japan’s borders. Streams on Amazon Prime.\n\nPsycho-Pass: First Inspector (2020). The beginning doesn’t look promising but believe me that this turns out absolutely amazing. I love it. It’s not as good as the 2015 movie, but what is? This brings about a cool reveal of the little subsystem shown in season 3, gets really topical about it (the wealthy uses this system to exploit the stock market and are happy to do some mass murder to maintain the system), and starts getting into AIs. My favorite SF thing. Streams on Amazon Prime.\n\nThere are four lesbians in this franchise, with one being a (sigh) ‘psycho lesbian’ stereotype who shows up in season one. She dies horribly but just in a gruesome murder way rather than being subjected to sexual assault. The other three have survived the rest of the franchise completely intact. One becomes the Chief of Police Brutality (not her actual title) but look, it’s a dystopian world and this girl was completely traumatized by the whole murder thing that happened at her high school. She was a teen! It probably built character in a bad way. I’m still cheering for her to kiss the (female) Chief of International War Crimes (who’s not a confirmed lesbian but they have certain interactions, ok? No it’s also not her real title, I call her this because she sniped a child soldier in the head this one time). Like I said, it’s a dystopian world, let these women kiss at least. You can really tell it’s the future because all the important government divisions are headed by women.\n\nMore seriously, I’m kind of miffed that the lesbianism kind of… stopped after season two. Throughout Sinners of the System and most of season 3, you wouldn’t be able to tell that Mika, Shion, and Yayoi are lesbians. They fix this in First Inspector where Shion and Yayoi sort of move in together, but it’s like the writers forgot (or intends to erase) that Mika likes women. Although, in the interest of fairness, Psycho-Pass doesn’t do romance much: in the first two seasons, the only apparent romantic relationship was the lesbians (Shion and Yayoi), and the only time you see heterosexual relationships it’s people who are already married. So there is that! Barely any homo but also basically no hetero.\n\nAgain, though a lot of whiny westerners complain about season two being bad, it is in fact very good and worth watching. Honestly I think the entire franchise is worth it, even if season three is rather weak. I’m hoping there will be more, because the way First Inspector wraps up still leaves some questions unanswered and a very big, glaring plot thread loose. Another season or another film would be fantastic."
