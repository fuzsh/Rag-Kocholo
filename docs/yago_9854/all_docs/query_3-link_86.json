        "text": "April is generally the month of rebirth, as spring brings the renewal of flowers, baby animals, and warm weather, but what about television? Which television shows burst through the soil with new life in April, and which were forever buried? Our list of all the canceled and renewed shows in April will tell you. The month brought some of the biggest renewals of 2024: ABC's 9-1-1, just weeks after its debut on the network, was thrown a lifeline and will return for Season 8 next year; Grey's Anatomy is scrubbing in for Season 21; and The Rookie will be back for Season 7. CBS also had a big month, with renewals of Elsbeth, NCIS, The Neighborhood, The Equalizer, all three FBI series, and S.W.A.T. â€” yes, the same S.W.A.T. that was already canceled once and then brought back for what was supposed to be its final season. Apple TV+'s Monarch: Legacy of Monsters and For All Mankind were also renewed, and so was Paramount+'s Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Netflix renewed its hit fantasy series The Witcher for a fifth and final season, and Prime Video announced the renewal of the video game adaptation Fallout.\n\nBut it was bad news for Star Trek: Lower Decks, which will end with its fifth season, as well as NBC's Quantum Leap, which has been canceled after two seasons.
