Otherwise, there have been no changes announced regarding the status of the current ensemble cast including: Eoin Macken, Jon Seda, Nicholas Gonzalez, Chiké Okonkwo, Zyra Gorecki, Jack Martin, Veronica St. Clair, Rohan Mirchandaney, Lily Santiago, Josh McKenzie, Tonantzin Carmelo, and Michelle Vergara Moore.\n\nRELATED: Is La Brea a Real Place?\n\nWhat will happen in Season 3?\n\nShow creator David Appelbaum told NBC Insider in December that, \"I always had an idea of where I wanted to end it for certain characters. But some of the other characters were on a different different journey in Season 2, so we really approached it from where do we want to bring all the characters emotionally by the end of the season?\"\n\nHe said there will be major plots involving the pregnancy of Lucas and Veronica, exploring, \"What does it mean to potentially become parents in 10,000 B.C.?\" and a resolution to the Harris family being split apart once more."
