However, in one of the animatics of the final episode, a rune message that spelled \"The End\" would have appeared after the end of the episode. This ultimately did not make it to the final version.[23]\n\nEach episode premiered in the middle month of a season with the time span between them being 3 months long.\n\nThe entire season was uploaded as a 2 ½-hour long video to the Disney Channel YouTube channel on April 13, 2023.\n\nProduction information[]\n\nOn March 10, 2023, Dana Terrace confirmed on Twitter that the production of the season and the series overall had ended, with the final episode being finished and delivered to the network.\n\nSarah-Nicole Robles made her last voice recording for Luz on January 20, 2023.[24]\n\nEvery episode from this season was animated by Sugarcube.\n\nGallery[]\n\nSee also: Season 3 production artwork\n\nVideos[]"
