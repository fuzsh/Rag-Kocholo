However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nThe flame isn’t out yet! Fire Country Season 3 could see a breakup for one couple and a reunion for another if everything goes according to plan. But how will that affect everyone. else? Read on for what we know about Fire Country Season 3’s cast and when it could return ahead.\n\nWho’s in the Fire Country Season 3 cast?\n\nNo Fire Country cast members have announced their exits at the time of writing, so all seven main cast members are expected to return for Season 3: Max Thieriot (Bode Donovan); Kevin Alejandro (Manny Perez); Jordan Calloway (Jake Crawford); Stephanie Arcila (Gabriela Perez); Jules Latimer (Eve Edwards); Diane Farr (Sharon Leone); and Billy Burke (Vince Leone).\n\nA character who’s expected leave (or have a reduced role) is Diego Moreno (played by Rafael de La Fuente), a Cal Fire paramedic and Gabriela’s fiance who has become a favorite among fans since he joined in Season 2. (Though not as much as Gabriela’s ex, Bode.) The preview for the Fire Country Season 2 finale, “I Do,” saw Bode crash Gabriela and Diego’s wedding to confess his feelings for her after he kissed her. In a preview of the finale shared by Parade, Gabriela discusses her feelings for both Bode and Diego. “Bode gave me a kiss. Diego is offering me a life,” Gabriela says.\n\nThe preview also shows Freddy (played by W. Tre Davis) encouraging Bode to tell Gabriela about how he feels for her before she gets married to Diego. “Since when did you let anything or anyone get in the way of what you want?” Freddy says. “In the name of your who life’s happiness, go get your girl, Bode.”\n\nFans on Reddit considered the scene a definite clue that Bode and Gabriela get back together or will get back together in Fire Country Season 4, which could mean bad news for Diego in Season 4. “Yes predicted since some episode ago that Gabby and Borde get back as a couple, The song gives away a lot also about it!” a Reddit user, referencing the upbeat track played in the preview that hints at a happy ending for Bode and Gabriela.\n\nAlejandro, who plays Gabriel’s father Manny, also hinted at his character’s daughter’s emotional decision in the finale in an interview with Parade in May 2024. “He’ll deal with the consequences that come as long as he has that one opportunity to be like, ‘Mija, I’m here,’” he said. He continued of Manny and Gabriel’s bond, “There’s something about this little family dynamic that they’re really doing justice to in the writing room, and honestly anything between she and I feels like gold to me.”\n\nWhen is Fire Country‘s Season 3 premiere date?\n\nCBS hasn’t announced Fire Country Season 3’s exact premiere date. However, the network confirmed that it will return in the fall of 2024 and keep its 9 to 10 p.m. time slot on Friday nights. It will be preceded by S.W.A.T. Season 8, which will air from 8 to 9 p.m. on Friday nights, and followed by Blue Bloods Season 14, Part 2, which will air from 10 to 11 p.m. The times are the exact same slots that CBS followed for its 2023-2024 Friday night schedule.\n\nAs for when Fire Country‘s premiere date will be, we estimate that it will likely be October 4, 2024, based on the premiere dates of past seasons of Fire Country, S.W.A.T., and Blue Bloods, which premiered around the first Friday of October.\n\nHow many episodes is Fire Country Season 3?\n\nCBS hasn’t confirmed the episode count for Fire Country Season 3 yet, however, it’s expected that the series will return to its usual 22-episode count that it had in Season 1 for Season 3. Like other primetime shows, the series had a reduced amount of episodes — 10 — for Season 2 due to the Writer’s Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes that delayed production for Season 2 by several months.\n\nFire Country is available to stream on Paramount Plus."
