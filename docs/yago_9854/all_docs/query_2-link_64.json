        "text": "Sydney Sweeney is opening up about the Euphoria season three time jump and returning to the character three years after last playing her in 2022’s second season.\n\nThe two-time Emmy nominee sat down with Cosmopolitan as her summer vacation winds down and she prepares to step into the lead role in Barbarella remake of the 1968 movie of the same name that starred Jane Fonda as the titular character.\n\nWhen asked how it feels to be returning to Euphoria‘s Cassie Howard for season three, which is set to begin production in January 2025, she explained it was her first time reprising a character after many years.\n\n“We did have a long time between season one and season two, but especially now with the time jump, it’s a new process for me,” she told the publication. “I’m kind of just learning as I go and being open for whatever’s to come. But I’m also really excited. I love Cassie. She is always such a thrilling character to play, so I’m really looking forward to what’s gonna happen in her life.”\n\nAs for what she’s most looking forward to about returning to set for the long-gestating third installment, she shared that she always feels like she’s coming home to her family when she reunites with her co-stars Zendaya, Jacob Elordi, Hunter Schafer and more.\n\n“They were the crew and the cast that were there at the beginning of my career,” Sweeney said. “We all came up from different places but came together and were navigating so much at the same time, so it’s really nice having that core group. They’re experiencing a similarity to what I’m going through. It’s nice to have that community.”\n\nThe Anyone but You star and producer briefly talked about Euphoria season three in March but has since remained mum on the subject. When asked by MTV’s Josh Horowitz if she planned on taking a break after back-to-back press tours for the rom-com, Madame Web and Immaculate, Sweeney said she would be going directly into the hit HBO series.\n\nFollowing her comment going viral, as people began hoping the show would be returning sooner rather than later, she admitted that talking about it feels “as scary as talking about Marvel,” so she hasn’t said much since."
