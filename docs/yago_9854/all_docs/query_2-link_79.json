        "text": "Editor’s note: This season, former NFL executive and Super Bowl champion Jim Monos will author a weekly column: “The Monos Report.”\n\nMonos scouted for the Philadelphia Eagles (2000- ‘04), New Orleans Saints (2005- ‘13), before taking over as the director of personnel for the Buffalo Bills (2013-2017). He has also worked in the AAF and XFL.\n\nHe’ll be studying both the college football and NFL tape this season. Icymi, here’s his excellent “franchise quarterback handbook” ahead of last spring’s draft.\n\nDamn it Feels Good to be a Gangsta is a hip-hop classic from the Ghetto Boys. Some may have discovered the song from the movie “Office Space.” The Ghetto Boys did not write that song for the Office Space soundtrack, but it worked. Seeing the contracts written for quarterbacks today, that song plays in my head.\n\nDamn it feels good to a quarterback… unless you’re Dak Prescott.\n\nWhy has owner Jerry Jones not offered Prescott the contract he has earned? It seems like a no-brainer decision. You drafted him. You have invested in building around him. You have made the playoffs five out of the eight years he has been the starter. Sustained success. That is the goal and responsibility for GMs and head coaches. Provide sustained success for your ownership and fan base to be relevant and compete for a Super Bowl every season.\n\nMaking the playoffs is one thing but what happens in those playoff games is another. I completely agree with Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders when he said to give the very best players a different-colored jacket than the other Hall of Famers or put their busts on a higher level in Canton. That’s the playoffs.\n\nThis is a higher level and where you separate yourself.\n\nThe basic, quick take is Prescott has a 2-5 record in the playoffs. I do not believe in speaking about quarterbacks like they’re starting pitchers. Not apples to apples.\n\nThe Cowboys are 2-5 in the playoffs with Dak Prescott as the starting QB. The question the front office (Jerry Jones) is asking: Is Dak Prescott good enough to elevate them past the playoffs and to the Super Bowl?\n\nWhat in the hell are the Dallas Cowboys doing? Our story at Go Long from June explains in full."
