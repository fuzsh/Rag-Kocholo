        "text": "Are the Pogues about to go full Kook?\n\nThat’s the question at hand ahead of Outer Banks‘ upcoming Season 4, which will catch up with the North Carolina teens as they enjoy the cash and fame that finding the treasure of El Dorado brought them.\n\nBut whether the kids from The Cut will adopt the Kook (that’s “well-off,” if you don’t speak Outer Banks) lifestyle is only one of the loose ends left at the conclusion of the Netflix series’ third season. Both John B.’s dad, Big John, and Sarah’s dad, Ward, died in the Season 3 finale, losses that both of the teens must wrestle with in the coming episodes. And that’s before you consider that another treasure hunt — a ship’s journal allegedly belonging to the pirate Blackbeard — fell into their laps in the final moments of the season.\n\nThe adventure series was renewed for a fourth season even before Season 3 premiered. “The Pogues are enjoying an adventure of a lifetime, and we now get to map out more twists and turns as the joyride continues into Season 4 of Outer Banks,” creators/showrunners Jonas Pate, Josh Pate and Shanon Burke said in a statement at the time. “Thank you to Netflix, our cast, and the amazing fans who helped to make this happen.”"
