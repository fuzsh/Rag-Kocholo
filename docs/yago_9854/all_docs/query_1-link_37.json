        "text": "Three Seasons, directed by the 26-year-old Tony Bui, features Harvey Keitel as an ex-GI returning to Saigon to find the grown-up daughter he sired there. That on its own should have made this a powerful picture. Instead, it is an exasperatingly vapid collection of touchy-feely short stories, of which Keitel's is just one, each trickling to a dull humanist-consensus happy ending that hardly does justice to the seething politics and history of modern Vietnam.\n\nKeitel is credited as executive producer, and without his godfatherly sponsorship the film would not have been made. He possibly felt a relatively modest role was therefore appropriate. I would much prefer to have seen his story made central, allowing his meeting with his daughter to emerge as something angry and complex and interesting."
