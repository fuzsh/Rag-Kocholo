        "text": "The eight-episode season two of The Gilded Age wrapped up on HBO and Max in December 2023, and viewers were patiently waiting for news regarding the third season of the hit period drama. Just before Christmas, HBO shared some good news for fans: The Gilded Age is renewed.\n\n\"We’re so proud of what Julian Fellowes and The Gilded Age family have achieved. From the costumes to the production design and performances, the show has captivated so many week after week. Along with our partners at Universal Television, we are thrilled to continue this grand tale for a third season,\" said Francesca Orsi, HBO's head of Drama Series and Films, said in a statement. Erin Underhill, Universal Television president, added, \"The cast and crew put so much of their heart and soul into the last two seasons, and we’re so proud that all this hard work is paying off with another season…you won’t want to miss what’s next!\"\n\nIn season three, per the logline, \"With the old guard officially deposed, New York society finds itself turned upside down, and all must get their house in order. But even those at the helm of this new era may find that change comes at a cost.\" Here's everything we know so far about the upcoming season three of The Gilded Age.\n\nThere's so much to explore in a third season of The Gilded Age.\n\nWriter Sonja Warfield tells Town & Country that \"there is so much in history\" that would work for the show. \"We discovered gems for season two that play into our characters' journeys, and there are so many more things we could play out if we’re lucky enough to get a third season,\" she says. \"In season one, we had Thomas Edison’s lights, in season two we have the Tuskegee Institute, and we’ll discover what that is in season three.\"\n\nEven before they were renewed for a third season, the creatives are already thinking about what stories could work. \"There are emails flying back and forth when you find a particularly cool story that fits. You just know when that happens,\" producer David Crockett tells T&C. \"The Metropolitan Opera opening on the same night as the Academy is a great example of that. It was real, and Julian knew the story but not that they opened on the same night, so it came through on an email chain and it was like, wow, we’ve got to do this!\"\n\nAs Michael Engler explains to Town & Country, \"All of the things that came up this season were talked about in the previous season. We talk about Jack’s life changing when he becomes a successful businessman. We talk about one of the women from a high place having a scandal and falling. Who knows! The kinds of stories that we learn about, that sometimes shock us, give us a large catalogue of things like that.\"\n\nProduction began in July 2024.\n\nStar Carrie Coon revealed that The Gilded Age production schedule will work with that of The White Lotus season three. \"We're going to go into production on The Gilded Age in July,\" Coon told Vanity Fair. \"And although White Lotus will continue shooting in July, I will probably wrap out by June, just so they can get me back for Gilded Age. The fact that both shows are on HBO definitely worked in my favor, because everyone’s incentivized to make sure everything works out.\"\n\nAfter she was nominated at the 2024 Emmys, Coon said, \"Today is especially gratifying because The Gilded Age returned to production last week for a season three that exists only because so many people watch and love the show, and I want to thank our champions at HBO for giving us another round.\"\n\nIn August 2024, in a new teaser, HBO shared a glimpse at season three:\n\nThe main cast is expected to return.\n\nNo specific details have been shared yet on which cast members will return for season three, but we can likely expect many of the season regulars to return, including Coon, Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Louisa Jacobson, Blake Ritson, Morgan Spector, Taissa Farmiga, Harry Richardson, Denée Benton, Simon Jones, and Jack Gilpin.\n\nIn addition, new cast members will join:\n\nPhylicia Rashad will play Mrs. Elizabeth Kirkland, a woman from a prominent family in Newport with ties dating back to the American Revolution. She has high standards and is unwilling to compromise the standards and expectations of her elite and exclusive social group – particularly when it comes to her son.\n\nJordan Donica will play Dr. William Kirkland, a kind and handsome doctor from the prominent Kirkland family who isn’t as narrow-minded as the older members of his elite social circle. He was inspired to help others by becoming a doctor after visiting Arthur Scott’s (John Douglas Thompson) pharmacy as a boy.\n\nBrian Stokes Mitchell will play Frederick Kirkland, the patriarch of the Kirkland family, husband to Eilzabeth Kirkland (Rashad), and father of Dr. William Kirkland (Donica). He is the pastor of a prominent Black church and a leader in the Newport community.\n\nVictoria Clark will play Joan Carlton, a kind, genial woman from the old money side of New York high society. Sincere and supportive of her son, she is surprised to find herself in a complicated and insulting situation.\n\nBill Camp will play JP Morgan, the famed investment banker.\n\nMerritt Wever will play Monica O'Brien, Bertha's estranged sister.\n\nLeslie Uggams will play Ernestine Brown, Elizabeth Kirkland's friend and a member of the Black elite in Newport.\n\nLisaGay Hamilton will play Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, the famed Black suffragist.\n\nPaul Alexander Nolan will play Alfred Merrick, a dashing, wealthy New York businessman.\n\nHattie Morahan will play Lady Sarah Vere, the sister of the Duck of Buckingham.\n\nAndrea Martin will play Madame Dashkova, a medium.\n\nJessica Frances Dukes will play Athena Trumbo, Dorothy's first cousin and a member of the Black elite in Newport.\n\nIn August 2024, HBO confirmed The Gilded Age will return in 2025, but no specific date has been set yet.\n\nWhile we wait, watch seasons one and two on Max:\n\nWe'll update this as soon as there's more news about The Gilded Age season three."
