        "text": "It's been nearly three years since Squid Game became Netflix's biggest show and seemingly the internet's favorite thing, spawning an impressive number of Halloween costumes and Roblox knockoffs. Now, its second season finally has a release date, and its third (and final) was given a release window as well.\n\nToday, the team behind Squid Game announced via a teaser trailer that the show's second season will premiere on Netflix on December 26. The trailer also revealed that the series has been renewed for a third and final season, which is slated to premiere in 2025.\n\nThe season's official description reads: \"Three years after winning Squid Game, Player 456 remains determined to find the people behind the game and put an end to their vicious sport. Using this fortune to fund his search, Gi-hun starts with the most obvious of places: look for the man in a sharp suit playing ddakji in the subway. But when his efforts finally yield results, the path toward taking down the organization proves to be deadlier than he imagined: to end the game, he needs to re-enter it.”\n\nThe announcement also came alongside a message from the show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, posted on X/Twitter. \"On the first day we began shooting Season 2, I remember thinking, 'Wow, I can't believe I'm back in the world of Squid Game,' \" he wrote. \"It almost felt surreal. I wonder how it will feel for you to be back in Squid Game after three years, as well.\"\n\nSquid Game's second season was initially confirmed in 2021, although it was not given a release window. Last year, lead actor Lee Jung-jae called Season 2 \"bigger in scale\" and said it would take longer to complete. While not much else is known about what might take place in Season 2, its cast was revealed last year, hinting at the possible return of a character whose fate was left uncertain."
