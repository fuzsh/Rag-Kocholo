        "text": "CBS is shutting down one of its NCIS field offices.\n\nThe network has canceled NCIS: Hawai’i after three seasons. The show’s season — and now series — finale is set to air May 6.\n\nThe series, which stars Vanessa Lachey and added former NCIS: Los Angeles star LL Cool J to its cast this season, will likely end up as the most watched show to be canceled this season — topping two other canceled CBS shows, CSI: Vegas and So Help Me Todd. NCIS: Hawai’i is averaging about 7.8 million viewers in Nielsen’s seven-day linear ratings this season, and it hits 10 million viewers over 35 days of cross-platform viewing.\n\nThose numbers would make for easy renewals most anyplace else, but they put NCIS: Hawai’i only in the middle of the pack at CBS. The network will also introduce a new NCIS series in the 2024-25 season, a prequel subtitled Origins that follows a younger version of Leroy Jethro Gibbs (played by Austin Stowell). Flagship NCIS and the newest spinoff, NCIS: Sydney, are also set to return. (Paramount+ has also greenlit another NCIS-verse series that will see Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly reprise their roles from the original series.)\n\nAt three seasons and 54 episodes, NCIS: Hawai’i will have the shortest run of any series in the franchise so far (excluding the 1-year-old Sydney). The end of the show will also mean CBS won’t be filming a show in the state of Hawaii for the first time since 2010: NCIS: Hawai’i followed Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I. in the Aloha State.\n\nNCIS: Hawai’i comes from CBS Studios and also stars Alex Tarrant, Noah Mills, Yasmine Al-Bustami, Jason Antoon, Tori Anderson and Kian Talan. Matt Bosack, Jan Nash, Christopher Silber and Larry Teng are the executive producers."
