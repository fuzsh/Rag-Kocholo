        "text": "As part of our Year Twenty activities, organizers of the Asian Pacific Filmmakers Experience in Park City will once again organize filmmaker panels and talks that allow audiences to learn more about the craft of making moving pictures through the perspectives of our communities’ artists. This year, we start off with a fireside chat with veteran actor/filmmaker Sung Kang, whose pivotal star turn in Justin Lin’s 2002 narrative feature BETTER LUCK TOMORROW announced the arrival of a vital voice in independent cinema. Then, we celebrate the impact of the Asian Pacific Filmmakers Experience through a talk with filmmakers Tony Bui (THREE SEASONS, Sundance 1999), Luciane Buchanan (Producer, MOTHER TONGUE), and Ramona Diaz (AND SO IT BEGINS), moderated by veteran APFE honoree Nina Yang Bongiovi.
