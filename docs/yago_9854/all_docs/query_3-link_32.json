        "text": "This story contains spoilers from Outer Range season 2.\n\nFor the past few days, I’ve thought about nothing except for Outer Range’s time-traveling hole. How does it work? Where did it come from? What does it want? Sure, it’s strange to talk about the hole as if it were a sentient being, but that’s just the nature of Outer Range’s massive anomaly. Even after two seasons, the void is just as captivating as when it first appeared. When Josh Brolin’s Royal Abbott declares, “Hole’s back” in season 2? I’ve never felt more alive. Now that True Detective: Night Country’s case is shut, I have no reservations about calling Outer Range the greatest mystery on TV.\n\nIn the show’s season 2 finale, we learn a surprising amount of information about the characters. We don’t learn much about the hole, but the series answers just about all of our other questions from season 1. Now we know what happened to Rebecca, where Perry went when he jumped into the void, and why Autumn is a future version of Amy. Of course, season 2 raises about a hundred new questions, but that’s the name of the game.\n\nWith the second season in the books, here’s everything we know about the future of the series.\n\nWhat Happened in Outer Range Season 2?\n\nIf you want Esquire’s full breakdown of the season 2 finale, head right here. The short version: After Autumn discovers that she’s Royal’s granddaughter, Amy, a premonition convinces her to throw her younger self into the hole—so that’s exactly what she does. She believes that Amy’s journey through time will somehow lead to her becoming Autumn, setting the formation of her future time cult in motion. Luke kills Billy, Perry kills Perry, Papa Tillerson jumps into the hole, and Rhett seems willing to betray his father for the right price.\n\nAs for Royal? Well, by the end of season 2, he has made some major strides toward becoming a better man. But that doesn’t mean life will return to normal for the Abbott patriarch. In yet another vision, Autumn warns him, “It’s just the beginning.”\n\nPrime Video has yet to renew Outer Range for season 3.\n\nWhat Will Happen in Season 3?\n\nYour guess is as good as mine! My biggest prediction for season 2 was that we’d see two holes—and that certainly didn’t pan out. Instead, Outer Range treated us to multiple time-traveling adventures across three different centuries. Who knows where or when Wayne Tillerson will end up, or what ramifications Perry will face for going back in time to replace his past self.\n\nAs of mid-May, Prime Video has not renewed the sci-fi western for a third season, but the streamer can change that any day now. According to Josh Brolin, he’s already discussed potential story lines for season 3 with showrunner Charles Murray. “Initially I thought, One season and we’re good. We’ll take a big swing, and if it works, it works. If it doesn’t, it doesn’t. I am really into it now,” Brolin tells Esquire. “I do think this season is better, more powerful, more dynamic, and it’s smarter.\n\n“Season 3, there’s some outlandish ideas, mostly from me,” Brolin continues. “Charles keeps it practical, which I appreciate. But I’m like, ‘What if we see him with a shaved head and a shaved beard?’... I liked that there was no transition between season 1 and season 2. It just literally started where we left off, which I thought was really fun. But I don’t know if that will be the case here. I know I don’t want to play it safe. I do know that.”\n\nHopefully the hole will reappear sometime soon."
