        "text": "The Bear is finally open for business. After a gut renovation that included some wild inspection, so many permits, and some long drives to make sure paperwork gets in on time, our favorite chefs have their dream place up and running. But will it last? While we'd love to get a third course served, there's always a chance that it doesn't pass on minute inspection and has to shut down for good. So is this the end of our new favorite dinner spot?\n\nHere's everything we know about The Bear season 3.\n\nIs The Bear season 3 happening?\n\nFX announced that The Bear season 3 will be happening on November 6, 2023. After weeks of speculation, fans can now breathe easily as they wait for their favorite chefs to come back to the kitchen! In their press release announcing its return, FX noted that the show will return in 2024, despite the delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike. It's also set to be released on Hulu like its previous seasons, although Disney is now set to own all of Hulu after buying out Comcast.\n\nEven though we had to wait until FX and Hulu made their decisions, we definitely took all the Will Poulter fancams as a good sign.\n\nAnd then there were also the 2023 Emmy Award nominations which confirmed The Bear as a heavy competition hitter, even over a year after season 1's release. Season 2 won't be eligible until the 2024 competition, but it all just proves that everyone is hungry for The Bear even after its release.\n\nAnd to add to the show's long list of accomplishments, it just won a ton of trophies at the 2024 Golden Globes. Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri both won for Best Actor and Actress in a Comedy, respectively. And the show overall won for Best Comedy Series. Yes, it is categorized as a comedy for awards season. Feel free to take your arguments to Twitter X.\n\nHas The Bear season 3 started filming?\n\nNot yet, but Carmy himself basically confirmed that filming will be underway in the new year. At the LA premiere of The Iron Claw, Jeremy Allen White confirmed that he's preparing for the upcoming season of the FX series.\n\n\"I haven't read scripts yet, that's the truth,\" he told Entertainment Tonight. \"But, yeah, we will be going back [into production] in, like, late February, early March. I'm gonna get together with some chefs starting in January and start doing some prep.\"\n\nThe cast are set to begin filming later in February, according to Screen Magazine.\n\nActual footage of me realizing that our faves at The Bear will be reunited oh-so soon:\n\nWhat would The Bear season 3 be about?\n\nThe show's second season ends on Friends & Family night, so the restaurant technically isn't officially open to the public yet. However, there's no doubt that more will come to light, especially with Carmy and Sugar's mom. Also, there's the fact that they still gotta pay Uncle Jimmy all his money back so business better get booming soon, or else they'll be in trouble.\n\nWhen does The Bear season 3 come out?\n\nDespite the fact that it hasn't even started filming yet, FX is also setting us up for a hot Chicago summer thanks to a reveal the 2024 Television Critics Association Press Tour that the series will be back in June, according to Variety. And despite the mix reaction to dropping it all at once last season, the show has no plans to change its current release plan.\n\n“It wasn’t lost on me or anyone who worked on the show that it was anxiety-inducing,” FX chairman John Landgraf said. “So we made a decision to drop the whole thing because it has a beautiful, uplifting ending.”\n\nAnd now the official date has been announced! The series was originally going to be back on June 27th, according to a teaser that FX released on their socials. But later on Hulu revealed at a press conference that the release will be moved up to 9 PM ET on June 26. We see Carmy back in The Bear restaurant and it looks like things are tense in the new kitchen.\n\nLuckily for us, we won't have to wait weekly as all the episodes will drop all at once. Happy binging!\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nFX finally revealed a trailer just a few weeks out before the season premieres and things are fired up as all our chefs try to chase something major: a star. But with love, life, and everything else on the line, things are definitely going to get more complicated. Oh, and then there's also Cousin Jimmy's money that they still need to pay back..."
