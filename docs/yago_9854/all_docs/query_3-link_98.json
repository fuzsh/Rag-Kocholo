        "text": "Warrior Nun was saved after being canceled after season 2.\n\nFans campaigned for the show to return after the cancellation.\n\nWarrior Nun will return with 3 movies.\n\nWarrior Nun fans rejoice! The Netflix series with a cult following will be returning to your screens. While the show was canceled following its second season, the fan response and campaign to bring it back has paid off. On August 15, executive producer Dean English announced that Warrior Nun would return with three feature films.\n\n“I am very happy to announce that Warrior Nun is coming back as a trilogy of motion pictures. Once again, a trilogy of feature films. Three,” Dean said in a video posted on YouTube. Given the ongoing writers’ and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Dean noted that he couldn’t make any announcements on that front.\n\nThere’s plenty of time for fans to rewatch the first two seasons of Warrior Nun — or get acquainted with the series for the first time. What does this mean for season 3? Will Warrior Nun’s future only consist of films? HollywoodLife has pieced together all of the details that you need to know about the resurrection of Warrior Nun.\n\nWarrior Nun Season 3 Premiere Date\n\nThere will not technically be a Warrior Nun season 3. The series will now evolve into a trilogy of films. The first of the three films does not have a release date yet. There’s no word yet about whether or not the series will be produced by Netflix.\n\nFans have been anxiously awaiting news about Warrior Nun’s future since the second season dropped in November 2022. Showrunner Simon Barry announced that the show hadn’t been renewed by Netflix in a December 2022 tweet. “My sincere appreciation to all the fans who worked so hard to bring awareness to this series, and for the love you showed me, the cast and the whole production team. It was a privilege to be a part of this,” he wrote at the time.\n\nDespite the original cancellation, Simon announced that the show was making its return in a tweet on June 28. “Today I’m happy to officially report that because of your combined voices, passion, and amazing efforts – Warrior Nun will return and is going to be more EPIC than you could imagine. More details to come! SOON! Thank-you!” he wrote, using the hashtags #SaveWarriorNun and #WarriorNunSaved. Screenwriter Amy Berg also tweeted that Simon’s announcement was very “real.”\n\nWhat Will Warrior Nun’s 3 Films Be About?\n\nExact details about the upcoming films are still few and far between, but the first film will likely pick right back up where the second season left off. Based on the manga series Warrior Nun Areala, the series follows Ava Silva (played by Alba Baptista), who wakes up and learns that she’s part of the demon-fighting crew of nuns Order of the Cruciform Sword.\n\nAt the end of the second season, Ava took part in a battle alongside her love interest Sister Beatrice (Kristina Tonteri-Young), Michael Salvius (Jack Mullarkey), and other members of the Order of the Cruciform Sword against Adriel (William Miller). At the end of the battle, Ava passes through an Ark to survive, and the other members of the OCS prepare for an impending holy war. At the end of the season, Beatrice announced that she was leaving the order.\n\nIn his announcement video, Dean asked the question on many minds: “Does this perhaps infer that there’s going to be a universe being launched of Warrior Nun, which could expand into films and TV series following characters that we already know?” To that he responded, “The answer to that question is yes, and there will be more details in the future.”\n\nWarrior Nun Cast & Crew\n\nWhile there’s still tons of information that has yet to be announced, it seems likely that many members of the original main cast will return to continue their recurring roles in the films. Alba Baptista and Kristina Toneri-Young are the only actors who have appeared in all 18 episodes of the show as Ava and Beatrice, respectively.\n\nOther members of the main cast from season 2 include Lorena Andrea as Sister Lilith, Tristán Ulloa as Father Vincent, Olivia Delcán as Sister Camilla, Thekla Reuten as Jillian Salvius, Sylvia De Fanti as Mother Superion, and William Miller as Adriel. It’s not clear if more fan-favorite actors or further new additions will be announced, but it does seem like Simon Barry will return as showrunner, as he made the announcement on Twitter.\n\nFan Campaign To Bring Back Warrior Nun\n\nAfter the announcement that Warrior Nun wasn’t renewed after season 2, fans immediately began a social media campaign to try to bring the show back with the hashtag #SaveWarriorNun. After the show was canceled, some fans even reportedly bought billboard space outside of Netflix’s office to try to convince them to bring the series back, per Collider.\n\nAfter it was announced that the show had been saved, many fans took to social media to celebrate the results. The power of fans can truly be unstoppable!"
