        "text": "John Wilson likes trilogies. “There are only three seasons of ‘Jackass,’” he pointed out during an interview this month from his home in Queens.\n\nMr. Wilson, 36, wore a white T-shirt like the one he usually wears while filming “How To With John Wilson,” his HBO documentary series whose third and final season begins on July 28.\n\nThe show is a portrait of New York taken at a funny angle; a meandering exploration of the resilience and delusion required to be a New Yorker. It began as a Vimeo series that was a side hustle for Mr. Wilson, who worked on infomercials and as a production assistant for a reality TV show.\n\nThe series retained its eye for curious characters when it was picked up by HBO. In Season 3, Mr. Wilson introduces viewers to a woman who hangs up inspirational posters in a Brighton Beach public restroom (“Please Don’t Drink and Drive,” “Pray”). Mr. Wilson himself appears in glimpses between interviews, reflected in the mirror of a party bus with his camera in hand."
