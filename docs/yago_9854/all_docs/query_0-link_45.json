        "text": "Join a Discussion on Current Film\n\nBy STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nhree Seasons\" is a wistful, rain-streaked elegy for a Vietnamese culture that is being swept away on the flood tide of globalization. Too tenderhearted and lyrical to deliver a political indictment, this touching film, which was chosen best dramatic feature at the Sundance Film Festival in January, is a dreamy cinematic poem whose interwoven voices offer different variations of the same sad story.\n\nPeter Stone/October Films Nguyen Ngoc Hiep, center, in ``Three Seasons,'' about a Vietnam with an Apocalpyse Now Bar, a hangout.\n\nIn that story, the gentle, common folk of Saigon are being left behind as an emerging, hard-edged international culture symbolized by Coca-Cola signs, luxury hotels and the peddling of plastic lotus blossoms on the streets takes over the city. One of many symbols of bald commercialization is a popular hangout once frequented by American servicemen that is now vulgarly named the Apocalypse Now Bar.\n\n\"Three Seasons\" is the first feature film by Tony Bui, a 26-year-old director who escaped from Vietnam with his parents when he was 2 years old and grew up in California.\n\nAfter returning to his native country for a visit when he was 19, he became fluent in Vietnamese and went back to make a short film, \"Yellow Lotus.\" Filmed in Saigon with a cast of Vietnamese actors, \"Three Seasons\" portrays the Vietnamese capital as a city of dissolving pastel colors, and the diffused palette reinforces the film's romanticized vision of a world melting away under warm tropical rains.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAll four of the film's principal characters are viewed as innocent, struggling victims of economic forces beyond their control. The opening scenes introduce us to Kien An (Nguyen Ngoc Hiep), the latest recruit in an all-female work force hired to pick white lotus blossoms on the temple estate of a reclusive boss.\n\nAfter gathering their crop, the women are bused to Saigon, where they sell baskets of flowers on the streets. Business is good until one day Kien An suddenly finds herself competing with vendors of plastic, artificially scented imitations of the real thing.\n\nSummoned by her mysterious employer, who has heard her singing a work song that transports him back to his childhood, Kien An discovers an embittered poet dying of leprosy. This once handsome man whose face is decomposing is the film's most jarring symbol of a traditional culture being pushed into the shadows.\n\nAnother strand of the story follows Hai (Don Duong), a cyclo driver who falls in love with Lan (Zoe Bui), an imperious Vietnamese prostitute. Hai assiduously courts her by offering her free rides from the luxury hotels in which she plies her trade.\n\nLan scornfully accepts his transportation until the day he reaps a windfall from winning a taxi race and purchases her professional time. Beneath her hard, high-fashion exterior, he discovers a frightened, alienated woman awash in shame and confusion.\n\nFinally, there is Woody (Nguyen Huu Duoc), a wide-eyed street boy who sells trinkets out of a suitcase. At the Apocalypse Now Bar, the boy meets James Hager (Harvey Keitel), an American soldier who has returned to Vietnam to search for his grown-up daughter. When Hager leaves for a moment, the boy nods off and has his suitcase stolen. Woody spends most of the rest of the movie trying to retrieve the source of his meager livelihood in a drenching rainstorm.\n\n\"Three Seasons\" doesn't pretend that its stories or characters (who all cross paths before the movie is over) are realistic. Each is a symbolic thread in a larger fable of people searching for their roots. The movie is so languidly paced that it occasionally turns vague and meandering.\n\nAnd its characters, especially the adorable, saucer-eyed Woody and the sweet, self-abasing Hai, are sentimentalized to the brink of saintliness. So much misty sadness and soft-focus guilt swirls around that you almost wish for a purgative eruption of anger.\n\nBut such an eruption would violate the movie's sweetly uplifting agenda. Determined not to revisit the Vietnam War and to open up old wounds, \"Three Seasons\" preaches reconciliation, forgiveness, reverence for tradition and the salvaging of all that was best about the past.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:\n\n'THREE SEASONS'\n\nDirected by Tony Bui; written (in Vietnamese, with English subtitles) by Bui, based on a story by Bui and Timothy Linh Bui; director of photography, Lisa Rinzler; edited by Keith Reamer; music by Richard Horowitz, with Vietnamese songs by Vy Nhat Tao; production designer, Wing Lee; produced by Jason Kliot, Joana Vicente and Bui; released by October Films.\n\nWith: Don Duong (Hai), Nguyen Ngoc Hiep (Kien An), Tran Manh Cuong (Teacher Dao), Harvey Keitel (James Hager), Zoe Bui (Lan) and Nguyen Huu Duoc (Woody).\n\nRunning time: 110 minutes.
