        "text": "Fans are hungry for another season of FX’s The Bear. Thankfully, a third (and fourth) helping of the beloved series will be served on Hulu shortly. Find out everything about The Bear Season 3, from the release date to the plot. Plus, watch the official trailer below.\n\nCreated by Christopher Storer, the Emmy-winning series The Bear follows the food industry through the eyes of a talented young chef named Carmen (Carmy) Berzatto. After his brother’s death, he has to leave his career in fine dining to run a local Chicagoan sandwich shop. Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Matty Matheson, Abby Elliott, Liza Colon-Zayas, and Lionel Boyce also star in the hit show.\n\nThe second season of the series, released in June 2023, won several accolades during the most recent award season, including Best Comedy at the Primetime Emmy Awards, Best Television Series (Musical or Comedy) at the Golden Globe Awards, and Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble (Comedy Series) at the SAG Awards.\n\nForbes'The Bear' Season 3 Moves Up Release Date And Time-Here's When To Watch\n\nFX and Hulu swiftly renewed the cooking drama for a third season in November 2023. “The Bear, which wowed audiences in its first season only to achieve even greater heights in season two, has become a cultural phenomenon,” the president of FX Entertainment, Nick Grad, said in a statement at the time. “We and our partners at Hulu join fans in looking forward to the next chapter in the story of The Bear.”\n\nIn April 2024, The Bear was quietly renewed for a fourth season, which will film right after Season 3. Production for the third season officially began in February 2024 following delays from the now-resolved writers’ and actors’ strikes.\n\nKeep reading for everything to know about The Bear Season 3.\n\nWhen Is The Bear Season 3 Coming Out?\n\nThe third season of The Bear will premiere on Hulu on Wednesday, June 26 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT, three hours earlier than originally planned.\n\nSeason 3 will also debut at the same time exclusively on Disney+ in the UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Gibraltar, the Balkans, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\nBack in December, White revealed on the Today show that filming for the third season would begin around February. “I think we’re going to get started up in like February, March,” he said.\n\nThe 33-year-old star added that he’d have to refine his skills before reentering the cooking world. “I’m going to get together with some chefs in January and start prepping in the kitchen again, sharpening up the skills,” White said.\n\nWhen asked if restaurant staff would recognize him and his Bear costars and “send out free food,” White responded, “Yeah, they kept us fed.”\n\nWho Is In The Bear Season 3 Cast?\n\nMost original cast members from Season 2 are expected to return for The Bear Season 3, including lead stars Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri. See the anticipated Season 3 cast list below:\n\nJeremy Allen White as Carmy Berzatto\n\nAyo Edebiri as Sydney Adamu\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as Richie Jerimovich\n\nAbby Elliott as Natalie “Sugar” Berzatto\n\nLionel Boyce as Marcus\n\nLiza Colón-Zayas as Tina\n\nThe second season had numerous exciting cameos; Jamie Lee Curtis guest starred as Carmy’s mother Donna Berzatto, Molly Gordon appeared as Carmy’s (almost) girlfriend Claire, and Jon Bernthal returned for a flashback scene as Carmy’s deceased brother, Mikey. It’s unknown whether any of last season’s guest stars will return for Season 3.\n\nWhat Is The Bear Season 3 About?\n\nSeason 3 of The Bear will likely pick up with Carmy’s restaurant’s re-opening. We last saw the talented chef and his crew in the Season 2 finale during Friends and Family Night. A few unanswered questions remain after season two, including where Carmy and Claire’s relationship stands, whether The Bear will be profitable, and if Carmy will need to pay back Uncle Jimmy’s massive loan.\n\nThe official description for Season 3 reads, “Carmy pushes himself harder than ever and demands excellence from his crew, who do their best to match his intensity. Their quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together. As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role.”\n\nThe synopsis continues, “In the restaurant industry, you’re never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we’ll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.”\n\nIs There A Trailer For The Bear Season 3?\n\nYes, FX released the first official trailer for The Bear Season 3 on May 29, which you can watch above. The trailer shows Carmy introducing his staff to his list of “non-negotiables” for how restaurants at the highest level operate.\n\nViewers also see Carmy presenting Sydney with a partnership agreement and the crew asking what happened between the chef and his almost-girlfriend Claire.\n\nThe official trailer comes after the network released a teaser clip earlier in the month on May 9. FX posted the clip on YouTube, and White also shared it on his Instagram account. The video shows Carmy back in the kitchen (and out of the freezer, thankfully).\n\nHow To Watch The Bear Season 3\n\nThe first two seasons and the upcoming third season of The Bear are exclusively available to stream on Hulu — or Disney+ if you have the Disney Bundle.\n\nWant to learn more about Hulu plans? The basic subscription with ads is $7.99 per month. For ad-free viewing, you get one month free, then it's $17.99 monthly. Hulu + Live TV comes with a three-day free trial and then costs $76.99 per month.\n\nStay tuned to learn more about The Bear Season 3. The first two seasons of The Bear are streaming on Hulu."
