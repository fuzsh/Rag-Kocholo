        "text": "Vikings: Valhalla season 3 is now on Netflix, so you can watch the final chapter in Leif, Freydis, and Harald's story to your heart's content.\n\nBefore you celebrate the occasion and dive in with a tankard of ale, however, scroll on down to our guide to everything you need to know about Vikings: Valhalla season 3. That includes trailers, cast news, and images from the final season.\n\nThen, once you've caught up on all the action, be sure to check out the latest on more of Netflix's big shows, including One Piece season 2 and The Witcher season 4.\n\nVikings: Valhalla season 3 began streaming on Netflix on July 11, 2024. AKA, it's out now.\n\nVikings: Valhalla season 3 cast: new characters and returning faces\n\nLeif (Sam Corlett), Harald (Leo Suter), and Freydis (Frida Gustavsson) all return in season 3. The main cast also consists of Queen Emma (Laura Berlin), Godwin (David Oakes), King Canute (Bradley Freegard), with Queen Aelfgifu (Pollyanna McIntosh), and Elena (Sofya Lebedeva) staying put.\n\nThe major casualty of the second season was Harald’s half-brother Olaf (Jóhannes Haukur Jóhannesson), slain at the hand of Freydis. Vikings hasn’t shied away from the supernatural on occasion, so the pagan hunter could show up in some form again.\n\nErik the Red, meanwhile, is the season’s first confirmed newcomer. The legendary Viking (and father of Freydis and Leif) will be played by The Boys actor Goran Visnjic. Florian Munteanu (Shang-Chi) will play Maniakes, a \"a fearless Byzantine general who answers only to the Emir.\"\n\nVikings: Valhalla season 3 trailer\n\nThe first trailer for Vikings: Valhalla season 3 is predictably filled with guts, gore, and more than one weapon being swung in anger.\n\nAll roads lead back home – and there's a time jump in store for viewers as Leif and Harald appear to be getting slightly antsy at their current predicament in Constantinople after seven years away.\n\nFreydis will have to deal with any uprising at Kattegat as her pagan ways become a thing of the past, while Canute is also at a crossroads of his own, having to bow down and \"kiss the ring\" of a new authority of His Holiness. The ultimate fate of England – unless you know your 11th-Century history, that is – could be a major concern in the final season.\n\nWhere to watch Vikings: Valhalla\n\nThe first three seasons of Vikings: Valhalla are available to stream on Netflix. All six seasons of the original Vikings series, set a century before the events of Valhalla, can be watched on Prime Video."
