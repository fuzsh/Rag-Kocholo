        "text": "Here's what to know about that poignant Season 3 finale, and what may be ahead for \"Bluey.\"\n\nSpoiler alert: This article contains details about “The Sign” episode of “Bluey.”\n\nParents who watch the popular Disney+ series \"Bluey\" with their little ones had some big emotions when the latest super-sized episode hit the streaming service Sunday.\n\n\"The Sign,\" which at 28 minutes was about the length of four regular \"Bluey\" episodes, also had fans worried that the Heeler family's possible move to a new house could have signaled the end of the beloved series after three seasons.\n\nHowever, the final scene of \"The Sign\" makes it appear that the Heeler family is staying put – and producers have indicated to multiple news outlets that the adventures of Bluey and her family are far from concluded.\n\nHere's what to know about that poignant Season 3 finale, and what may be ahead for \"Bluey.\"\n\n'Bluey:' What to know about extended episode 'The Sign'\n\nWhat happened in 'The Sign?'\n\nOn the surface, \"Bluey\" purports to be a children's show about a cartoon family of dogs living in Australia.\n\nAnd it is that, with it's endless quirky hijinks delighting youngsters of all early ages. But the series produced in Brisbane, Australia, by Ludo Studio has also struck a nerve with parents who find themselves moved – often to tears – by the relatable situations and familial themes that arise in the series.\n\n\"The Sign,\" which premiered Sunday, is certainly no exception.\n\nThe episode title refers to the “For Sale” sign in front of the Heeler home that caused many adult fans to fear that the family was on the cusp of a significant move for patriarch Bandit's new job. Bluey is not happy about the impending move, and neither is her mother, Chilli, despite her efforts to be supportive.\n\nThe impending move looms in the background for much of an episode that is otherwise framed around a wedding celebration of Bandit's brother Radley to Frisky.\n\nBy now, those who have watched the episode know that the Heelers don't appear to be on the move after all after Bandit – realizing that his family's best life took place at that house – rips the sign from the yard before the credits roll.\n\nHow fans reacted to that emotional episode\n\nNeedless to say, some parents were in their feelings after such a heart-stirring finale.\n\n\"Now, that’s what we call a stellar season finale. Also, how dare this show for pre-schoolers make adults get all emotional,\" Jazz Tangcay, an editor at Variety, posted on social media site X.\n\nPro wrestler and father Johnny Gargano posted on X that the new episode is straight-up Avengers: End Game level for all of us (fans.)\"\n\n\"What a fantastic emotional rollercoaster!\" Gargano added .\n\n\"It’s like watching SpongeBob as an adult except it rips your heart out,\" fan Jack Caporuscio wrote on X.\n\n\"My therapist isn’t gonna know what hit her. Sensational television,\" fan Sam Gavin wrote on X. \"No I’m not joking. Bandit & Chilli are parenting goals. I love these characters so much.\"\n\nFan Brittany Bailey wrote on X that her husband woke her family up to watch the episode, and then \"cried his eyes out.\"\n\n\"The last time he cried was at the birth of our baby,\" Bailey wrote. \"Bluey is so much more than a kids cartoon.\"\n\nOn Instagram, influencer Bethany Krat joked that \"'Oppenheimer' was cool and everything, but did you see the 'Bluey' episode 'The Sign?'\"\n\n\"You can’t tell me these Bluey episodes aren’t cinematic masterpieces,\" Krat wrote, adding that her family dog is named after the character Bandit. \"They generate more feelings and emotions than any movie ever has, and I feel like I need to give my therapist a call to unpack things after each one.\"\n\nIs 'Bluey' ending after 'The Sign' episode?\n\nFortunately, this doesn't appear to be the end of the Heeler family's adventures.\n\nIn fact, it may signal a momentous change in direction or scope for a show that has so far been defined by quick 7-minute episodes.\n\nWhile Disney+ declined to comment when reached Monday by USA TODAY, \"Bluey\" producer Sam Moore told BBC that \"we have more in store and we are thinking what would be next.\"\n\n\"No it is not the end for 'Bluey,'\" Moore said. \"I'm sure we have many more surprises in store for you.\"\n\n‘Bluey' executive producer Daley Pearson told the Los Angeles Times that the episode is something of a test to see how an audience responds to a longer format of the show, which debuted in 2019. He even hinted that a feature film could be on the horizon.\n\n“It’s an episode about these very important things that these characters are going through,” Pearson told the LA Times. “It’s probably the biggest possible changes these characters have ever gone through. There’s a bit of experimental feel to it. Will it work? Will the audience stick with it? And I think it’s one of the most beautiful episodes we’ve made.”\n\nHow to watch 'Bluey'\n\nThree seasons of the show are available to stream on Disney+. Monthly subscription rates start at $9.99.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY. Reach him at elagatta@gannett.com"
