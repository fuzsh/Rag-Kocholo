        "text": "Do you know who the Goatsingers are? This plaque is at 177 W. Broadway, where Pamper-UR-Pets is. —M.\n\nThe very short answer is that The Goatsingers is actor Harvey Keitel’s production company. From a 2002 biography on Filmbug:\n\nTogether with his partner Peggy Gormley, Keitel has his own film production company, The Goatsingers, which has a first look deal with Kinowelt USA, the U.S. production arm of Munich-based Kinowelt Medien AG. The Goatsingers served as executive producers on Tony Bui’s Three Seasons, winner of the Grand Jury Prize and audience Award at 1999’s Sundance Film Festival, and Wayne Wang and Paul Auster’s Blue in the Face, both of which Keitel appeared in. Keitel also served as co-producer on Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs.\n\nThe Goatsingers, working out of their New York office, is currently involved in a number of other projects. Included among those are The Grey Zone by Tim Blake Nelson, which The Goatsingers is executive producing with Christine Vachon producing; Henry and the Second Gunman by Tom Leopold, being co-produced by The Goatsingers and Leopold, and Dreaming of Julia by Juan Gerard and Letvia Arza-Goderich, which The Goatsingers are producing with Letvia Arza-Goderich, Andy Pfeffer and Bonnie Timmerman. Also on The Goatsingers’ slate is Johnny Jump-Up by Tony Kavanaugh, which is being co-produced with Parallel Films in Dublin and Mean by Carla Miles, being co-produced with Ruth Charny.\n\nKeitel’s current Filmbug bio has no mention of the Goatsingers, so the question is whether the company is still active. I called the number on Facebook (212-966-3045), where an outgoing message says you’ve reached the Goatsingers, but no one has responded to the two messages I left.\n\nGot a question? Email it to tribecacitizen@gmail.com or call/text 917-209-6473."
