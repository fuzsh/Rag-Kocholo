        "text": "Every time you think youâ€™re finally ready to cancel your Netflix subscription, they pull you back in â€“ and itâ€™s usually not an exclusive Adam Sandler or Lindsay Lohan movie that does it (although maybe sometimes). Most of the time, itâ€™s because of a must-binge new series. Original episodic programming has been the streamerâ€™s calling card ever since it stopped being the DVD rent-to-mail service and went entirely online. It changed the game with House of Cards in 2013 and has continually elevated it since, with the likes of Stranger Things and Russian Doll and the world-dominating Squid Game. Sure, there have been some creatively fallow periods, but then it always seems to bounce back with sometime leftfield, like Beef or One Day.\n\nSince itâ€™s continually adding hours of essential content to its catalogue, thereâ€™s more high-quality content than you possibly have time for. Thatâ€™s weâ€™ve put together a list of the 41 Netflix originals series you absolutely have to see before finally deleting your account â€“ and of course, once you think youâ€™ve exhausted all your options, something else will get added just as youâ€™re about to press â€˜cancelâ€™.\n\nAnd before you get all upset about the absence of Black Mirror or Cobra Kai, weâ€™ve left out shows that originated elsewhere before the platform picked them up. Weâ€™re also sticking to scripted series â€“ sorry Tiger King and the countless other true-crime docs. Thatâ€™s a list for another time.\n\nRecommended:\n\nðŸŽ¥ The 35 best movies on Netflix right now ðŸ”¥ The 25 best movies on HBO and Max right now\n\nðŸ‘½ The best sci-fi shows streaming on Netflix\n\n1. Stranger Things\n\nA rollicking, endearing '80s pastiche that leans deep into its inspirations â€“ a little John Carpenter here, some (ok, a lot of) Steven Spielberg there, a dollop of Stephen King with a dash of Red Dawn â€“ Stranger Things took off thanks in no small part to its neo-Goonies cast of Dungeons & Dragons-obsessed kids highlighted by Millie Bobby Brown's telekinetic Eleven. With its creepy parallel-dimension threat, underbelly teeming with mad scientists and commies, genuinely chilling horror moments and penchant for cliffhangers, the show all but perfected the binge-watch model.\n\nPart of the joy has been watching its young stars grow, but the adults evolve marvelously too, particularly Winona Ryder and David Harbour, who bring gravitas to the proceedings. Season 4 is currently in production after last season expanded the scope beyond the small town of Hawkins, Indiana. It can't arrive fast enough.\n\n2. The Crown\n\nThe story of Queen Elizabeth IIâ€™s reign has landed countless wins on the awards circuit since its first season aired in 2016 â€“ and for good reason. The writing is excellent, the acting wonderful and the cinematography outstanding, all contributing to the creation of a show appreciated even by those usually loath to give historical dramas a chance.\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. BoJack Horseman\n\nA showbiz comedy about a self-destructive '90s sitcom star who happens to be a horse isn't exactly an easy sell. BoJack is, after all, a show about humanoid animals that's also a stark meditation on the nature of depression, greed, addiction, fame, obsession, abuse and generational trauma. Against all odds, itâ€™s one of the funniest shows on television, rife with visual gags and acidic turns of phrase and unafraid to go to dark places and rebound with moments of tenderness.\n\nMiraculously, the show stuck the landing, going out on a high note with the reflective, heartbreaking season 6. BoJack will make you cry. Whether it's due to laughter or its gut-punch narrative â€“ again, about a talking horse â€“ depends on what episode you're watching.\n\n4. Baby Reindeer\n\nIf you only look at the broad details, it scans like salacious true-crime fodder: a sad woman enters a pub. A young bartender takes pity on her. She becomes a regular. Then the emails arrive â€“ hundreds a day, all horribly misspelled â€“ and she grows increasingly delusional and threatening. Indeed, Baby Reindeer is based on an actual experience by writer-star Richard Gadd, but the story of a wannabe comedian targeted by an aggressive stalker is merely a framework for an uncommonly raw, emotionally complex, yet still darkly funny examination of shame, empathy and victimhood. By the end, you may not know exactly what to think of it, but one thingâ€™s for sure: you wonâ€™t stop thinking about it.\n\nMatthew Singer\n\nFilm writer and editor\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. Squid Game\n\nAn outta-nowhere smash, this South Korean series exploded up the Netflix streaming ranks upon release in 2021 to become the most-watched show in the platformâ€™s history. Itâ€™s a feat made all the more astounding given the subject matter. Effectively a more overtly class-conscious â€“ and way more violent â€“ take on The Hunger Games, the show centres around a contest in which financially desperate competitors are made to participate in a series of childrenâ€™s games. The winner stands to earn a significant cash prize and the losers are killed off one by one. Itâ€™s hard to watch at times, due to both the gore and hyperventilating suspense, but once its hooks set in, itâ€™s impossible to turn away from.\n\n6. Orange is the New Black\n\nNetflixâ€™s most-watched original series changed the game from episode one. Though subsequent seasons had their flaws, from the beginning OITNB wooed us all with its smart writing and memorable characters. Ultimately itâ€™s up to you whether you consider it a drama or a comedy â€“ after all, itâ€™s won an Emmy for both.\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. Master of None\n\nAziz Ansari's wry, ruminative, artistic tale of an Indian-American actor dating, eating and accessorising his way through New York City was a sensation upon its release in 2015, then it disappeared for five years following its Italian neorealism-inspired second season.\n\nThis year, it returned, with Ansari behind the camera instead of in front and focused on Lena Waithe's supporting character, Denise, as she hunkered down with her wife in the countryside. The narrative shift was jarring, but also a beautiful character study, proving that Ansari's gift for storytelling extends well beyond the semi-autobiographical.\n\n8. Lupin\n\nOmar Syâ€™s master-thief Assane Diop may be the most effortlessly charismatic man on TV just now. The world has been slow to catch up on the stylish adventures of French literary hero ArsÃ¨ne Lupin â€“ think Thomas Crownâ€™s light fingers combined with Sherlock Holmesâ€™s smarts â€“ but Netflixâ€™s smash-hit two-parter, in which Diop channels Lupin in the name of revenge, has brought the non-French-speaking world right up to speed. Even the subtitle-averse will get a major kick out of its super-sexy Parisian backdrops and hairpin plot twists.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nKimmy Schmidt will help fill that 30 Rock-sized hole in your DVR and leave you wishing you had Tina Fey as your therapist. Crafted by Fey and brought to life by the perfectly-cast Ellie Kemper, chipper Kimmy comments on modern society with the innocence of a child and the experiences of an adult (an adult locked in a bunker for most of her life, that is) to make you wonder just how we let some things in the world get so weird.\n\n10. Russian Doll\n\nSweet birthday baby! In this dramedy, creator-director Natasha Lyonne stars as a game developer stuck in a Groundhogâ€™s Day-esque time-loop scenario, forced to live the same day over and over again, until she discovers her circumstance is not quite as unique as it seems. With its not-wholly-necessary second season, the show seems trapped in a time loop of its own, but the first season is excellent on its own. Plenty of movies and series have explored similar existential themes using the same conceit, but few of them are as smart and soulful.\n\nAdvertising\n\n11. Ozark\n\nOzark has been relatively slow at capturing the attention and devotion of Netflix's audience, but it's now considered to be one of the best crime dramas of recent TV history. Jason Bateman is a financial advisor that moves his family from Chicago to Missouri after a money laundering scheme gone bad. The crime and the drama don't end after the move: expect the Mexican drug cartel and local criminals to make appearances in what often feels like a more dour Breaking Badâ€¦ which is really saying something.\n\n12. When They See Us\n\nThis Ava DuVernay miniseries about the 1989 Central Park jogger case was much anticipated and very well received, earning Jharrel Jerome, one of the many cast members, an Emmy for his work. The series tells the true story of the five suspects falsely accused of assaulting and raping a woman in Central Park. The show was accompanied by a special, Oprah Winfrey Presents When They See Us Now, that also drew a lot of attention.\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. I Think You Should Leave\n\nAdmittedly, the comedy of Tim Robinson is an acquired taste â€“ itâ€™s manic, surreal, discursive, profane and often quite loud. Acquiring the taste for it, though, is actually quite easy: each episode of his cultishly beloved sketch show clocks in under 20 minutes, so even if youâ€™re left wondering what the hell it was you just watched, it requires little commitment to keep going until you get attuned to its bizarre, disorienting rhythms â€“ and by that point, youâ€™ll be hooked. Robinson excels at taking a seemingly mundane premise and turning it inside out until you can hardly remember how it started. Summarising sketches like â€˜Coffin Flopâ€™ and â€˜The Driving Croonerâ€™ is nearly impossible, yet youâ€™ll end up laughing to the point you might think someone spiked your drink.\n\n14. GLOW\n\nItâ€™s surprising it took so long to get an excellent television show about professional wrestling â€“ a deeply weird industry thatâ€™s also greatly misunderstood as an artform â€“ but Netflixâ€™s semi-fictionalised dramedy about the ultra-campy â€˜80s womenâ€™s league Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling was one of the best series the platform has put out to date. That is, until Netflix decided to cancel the show after COVID-19 delayed the production of its fourth and final season. So yes, the lack of a proper ending is frustrating, but that doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t dive in if you havenâ€™t already. Alison Brie (as Ruth â€˜Zoya the Destroyaâ€™ Wilder) and Betty Gilpin (as Debbie â€˜Liberty Belleâ€™ Eagan) are the showâ€™s anchors, but the entire ensemble cast â€“ including Marc Maron as the cranky producer with a heart ofâ€¦well, not gold exactly, but something close â€“ shine in and out of the ring.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. Narcos\n\nThereâ€™s no business like the blow business for the infamous Medellin drug cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar, and the DEA agent tasked with his takedown. Narcos looks into the gritty world of the drug trade and how one man stacked his pieces just to have it all torn down. The show is juicy and oddly historically relevant in equal measure.\n\n16. Dear White People\n\nBased on the eponymous 2014 film, the series centers on several African-American college students at Ivy League school Winchester. Each 30-minute episode zooms into a single character's story, poignantly touching upon race relations and issues. The fourth and final season of the show is set to premiere some time this year.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. Sex Education\n\nThis British dramedy is gearing up for its third season, and has likely been Netflix's most surprising win. Focusing on a socially awkward teenager and his sex therapist mother (a stellar Gillian Anderson), the series has been praised for its subtle sense of humor and extreme sex positivity both commercially and critically. Not often does British humor so effortlessly translate to American laughs, but Sex Education has managed to cross-over thanks to its warm heart, John Hughes-inspired high-school antics and anything-goes approach to the awkwardness of teen sexuality.\n\n18. The Politician\n\nThe Politician is considered by many to be a niche watch, just like almost all other shows created by Ryan Murphy. This is the prolific showrunner's first of many series under the Netflix banner, part of a historical deal that shook up the industry when announced back in 2018.\n\nThe show stars the wonderful Ben Platt as Payton Hobart, a high-achieving student at the fictional Saint Sebastian High School in Santa Barbara, California. The second season takes the character to New York, where he runs for a seat in the New York State Senate. Expect anything but high school drama from the show, which boasts the dramatic comedy that Murphy is renowned for and a stellar cast of characters.\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. Unbelievable\n\nThe 2019 miniseries is based on the 2015 Pulitzer Prize-winning article An Unbelievable Story of Rape, written by T Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong and conjunctively published by ProPublica and The Marshall Project. The cast is phenomenal both in name and performance â€” Toni Collette, Merritt Wever and Kaitlyn Dever in particular â€” but it is the poignancy of the adaptation that helped the series earn superb reviews.\n\n20. Grace and Frankie\n\nGiven constant Hollywood chatter about the difficulty that older actresses face when looking for suitable roles, Grace and Frankie is a truly refreshing show that makes full use of Jane Fonda's and Lily Tomlin's comedic chops. Add to that Sam Waterston and Martin Sheen as supporting actors and you've got yourself a sure success. Back in 2019, a seventh final season was announced, making this the longest-running Netflix original series in history. That would be 94 episodes in total.\n\nAdvertising\n\n21. 13 Reasons Why\n\n13 Reasons Why was marred in controversy, and we understand why. The show was extremely graphic, at times even seemingly glorifying teen depression and suicide. The second season even includes a warning video at the beginning of each episode. That said, there was just something about the show that truly hit home, especially during the first season, which was intended as a limited series. The show eventually capped off at four seasons. Beware: this is a very sad story.\n\n22. Kaleidoscope\n\nThe hook for this crime drama is that the episodes are designed to be watched in any order â€“ with the exception of the finale â€“ the idea being that the perception of the characters and their roles in an elaborate heist changes depending on how the viewer chooses to watch. If thatâ€™s all the series was, though, the show would simply be an interesting novelty whose shelf life would quickly fade. But Kaleidoscope would be worth a watch even if it was told linearly, thanks in large part to the always engaging Giancarlo Esposito as Leo Pap, orchestrator of a long-gestating plan to steal $7 billion from a seemingly impenetrable vault.\n\nAdvertising\n\n23. Atypical\n\nSam Gardner (Keir Gilchrist) is an 18-year-old with autism spectrum disorder living in Connecticut. Atypical is his show. Although criticized in season one for its lack of autistic actors, the second and third seasons were well received by critics, an opinion matched by the show's rising popularity.\n\n24. The OA\n\nThe OA is one of those rare shows that lands on the scene without notice, is anchored by relatively unknown actors, yet unexpectedly makes a mark on television history and society in general. Unfortunately, after an absolutely incredible first season â€” probably one of the best that Netflix has ever aired â€” the second one turned out to be the exact opposite. The negative reviews are likely what prompted the network to cancel the show after season two, after originally announcing The OA would wrap up after five.\n\nAdvertising\n\n25. Big Mouth\n\nNick Kroll and John Mulaney's star-studded puberty comedy shares a lot of themes â€” and cast members â€” with Hulu's Pen15, primary among them a fearlessness in addressing gross teenage sexuality and a massive amount of heart. What at first seemed like a hackneyed, rat-a-tat joke factory a la Family Guy has, over four seasons, evolved into a beacon of good-natured discourse and emotional revelationsâ€¦ all while maintaining its roster of hormone monsters (Maya Rudolph, we adore you) and talking poop. No small feat, that.\n\n26. The Umbrella Academy\n\nThe antithesis of Amazon's gore-soaked superhero bro-down The Boys, Umbrella Academy is part X-Men, part Harry Potter and part Hellboy, yet somehow weirder than that recipe would have you believe. Elliot Page anchors a cast that also includes psychics, time travelers and one very smart monkey butler. It's wildly unpredictable, wholly original and further evidence that audiences are more than ready for superhero stories to get extra weird.\n\nAdvertising\n\n27. House of Cards\n\nNetflixâ€™s very first series came out swinging, with David Fincher enlisting Seven villain Kevin Spacey and the great Robin Wright for an eerily ahead-of-its-time look at cutthroat politicians. There hasnâ€™t been anything like it since maybe The West Wing aired, and Frank Underwoodâ€™s methods to manipulate become darker and his ethical code more invisible with each new season.\n\nThings, alas, started to go sideways as the series ran on, transitioning from brilliant to ridiculous and overwrought long before revelations about Spacey led to his character getting the axe. The show's legacy will forever be tainted by Spacey's off-camera behavior, but the fact is that it was already in trouble before allegations came to light, steadily declining after the brilliant season 4.\n\n28. Dark\n\nWay before Marvel was all-in on time travel, this bleak German import spun a wild, self-contained tapestry about a small German community leaping back and forth in time to prevent an apocalyptic event. Season 1 is near perfect, 2 is deliciously weird and 3 flies off the rails, but that's kind of the fun: Perfectly cast, hilariously humorless, wildly overwrought in its melodrama and cold as a German winter, this is a feast for binge-watchers who relish in theorising what could come next.\n\nAdvertising\n\n29. Easy\n\nAlthough failing when attempting to honestly depict modern love, Easy should still be considered part of Netflix's golden canon. A total of three seasons and 25 half-hour episodes, the anthology series boasts some pretty swanky cast members, including Orlando Bloom, Malin Akerman, Aubrey Plaza and Dave Franco. Given its format, you don't necessarily need to watch the episodes in order â€” although we suggest you do.\n\n30. American Vandal\n\nAmerican Vandal deserves a spot on this list for many reasons. Chiefly, its sheer originality. The mockumentary is basically a parody of the true crime documentaries that still seem to capture the world's attention â€” we're talking Serial, Abducted in Plain Sight and especially Netflix's Making a Murderer more. Keep national trends in mind while watching, and remember: Anyone and everyone can be the Turd Burglar\n\nAdvertising\n\n31. A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nThe always wonderful Neil Patrick Harris takes us inside the eponymous children's novel series written by Lemony Snicket (yes, that's a pen name). All 13 books are adapted across the three seasons in which Harris' sinister count â€” played by Jim Carrey in a film adaptation â€” chases a group of orphans through some seriously Edward Gorey-esque landscapes. For older kids with a morbid streak, and adults with nostalgia for their gothier days, it's a visual and comedic feast.\n\n32. The Witcher\n\nThis Henry Cavill-starring video-game adaptation answers a question nobody thought to ask: What if Game of Thrones didn't take itself so seriously? It's a bit campy, but the production design is great, and Cavill fully commits to everything, particularly taking baths and swinging a broadsword, both of which he does with reckless abandon.\n\nAdvertising\n\n33. Unorthodox\n\nUnorthodox is both hard and easy to watch. Heavy material depicted in digestible bits (4 episodes, each just under an hour), the story takes you inside the Hasidic community that calls Williamsburg, Brooklyn home. Loosely based on Deborah Feldman's 2012 autobiography (Unorthodox: The Scandalous Rejection of My Hasidic Roots), this is the first Netflix series almost exclusively shot in Yiddish.\n\n34. Bloodline\n\nAs can be expected with TV dramas, this serial thriller lets you know right away that, obviously, nothing is as it seems. But this particular family and the particular secrets they protect are gripping and layered and will draw viewers in as they tear relationships and familial trust apart.\n\nAs any original fan of the series will likely agree, although season one was above-average good, the second and final one unfortunately fell short. Ben Mendelsohn's performance as the black sheep of the family still resonates, though.\n\nAdvertising\n\n35. Beef\n\nMinariâ€™s Steven Yeunâ€™s handyman and stand-up star Ali Wongâ€™s entrepreneur become embroiled in a demolition derby of mutually assured destruction over ten LA-set episodes of this barbed, personally brutal and always blackly funny road-rage drama. Despite a late storytelling wobble, Beef is brilliantly assured telly, with creator Lee Sung Jinâ€™s vision of rage playing like a darky comic Biblical parable.\n\n36. Luke Cage\n\nThe Marvel show about an unassuming vigilante (Mike Colter) makes some serious statements about racism, and it was so buzzy it crashed Netflix for more than two hours with its debut. It can be slow-moving, but those impressive fight scenes will sneak up on you as Cage nonchalantly saunters into battle on the streets of Harlem (which actually look like real Harlem), with only a car door as a weapon.\n\nAdvertising\n\n37. The Watcher\n\nRyan Murphyâ€™s fingerprints are all over this creepy thriller, an adaptation of a true-life tale of a family in suburban New Jersey harassed by an unseen stalker placing vaguely threatening letters in their mailbox. It contains Murphyâ€™s signature sense of camp and OTT digressions, yet still manages to crawl under the skin and produce a legitimate sense of creeping dread. But letâ€™s be real: youâ€™re mostly here for Jennifer Coolidge as Karen, a real estate agent who fully lives to her name.\n\n38. One Day\n\nInitially adapted as a forgettable Anne Hathaway film, David Nichollsâ€™ time-jumping 2009 romantic novel found itself much better suited to a streaming TV series. A posh party boy (The White Lotusâ€™s Leo Woodall) meets a working-class Leeds girl (Ambika Mod) at an Edinburgh graduation party on St Swithinâ€™s Day in 1988. While sparks donâ€™t immediately fly, the two forge a connection that will bond them for 14 years â€“ and 14 episodes, each set exactly one year apart. At turns funny, swooning and absolutely devastating, itâ€™s one of the best modern love stories on television.\n\nAdvertising\n\n39. The Haunting of Hill House/The Haunting of Bly Manor\n\nMike Flanagan's gothic horror anthology â€“ based first on the works of Shirley Jackson, then Henry James â€“ has its lulls, often stumbling deep into melodrama. But when it's operating in horror mode, the series is a top-tier funhouse, one in which every shot becomes a game of Where's Waldo to spot the ghouls lurking by the dozens in the shadows as the family drama plays out.\n\n40. You\n\nâ€˜Likeable serial killerâ€™ is a tough balance to pull off. With due respect to the charms of Hannibal Lector, Patrick Bateman and Dexter Morgan, none of them deliver it half as smoothly as Penn Badgleyâ€™s Joe Goldberg. Like an escapee from a romcom whoâ€™s woken up with a taste for murder, heâ€™s matinee-idol handsome and FBI-most-wanted dangerous in a horribly moreish Netflix series that sees him adopting a series of cunning disguises to avoid detection (ie: a baseball cap). Itâ€™s daft, sure, but itâ€™s held the world in the palm of its clammy hand since 2018 for a reason. The fourth season, in which Goldberg moves to London and kills a bunch of cardboard-cutout poshos, was its silliest yet â€“ and thus automatically its best.\n\nPhil de Semlyen\n\nGlobal film editor\n\nAdvertising\n\n41. Dead to Me\n\nOn the surface, this very dark comedy reads like another series in which sympathetic characters wind up connected to a dead body and make a series of horrible mistakes attempting to cover it up. But Dead to Me is elevated by fantastic performances from Christina Applegate and Linda Cardellini as two women whose complicated but often moving relationship is linked by shared grief.\n\n42. Love\n\nSheâ€™s an alcoholic sex addict with a penchant for causing chaos wherever she goes. Heâ€™s a neurotic aspiring screenwriter with high emotional needs and a martyr streak. That doesnâ€™t read like a successful couple on paper, nor one many of us would be inclined to spend much time with. But over the course of Loveâ€™s three seasons, co-stars Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust â€“ who also created the show alongside Judd Apatow and Rustâ€™s wife, Lesley Arfin â€“ somehow make them easy to root for, in part because anyone whoâ€™s ever spent time in the muck of the dating pool can recognise the messiness of their relationship. Neither character is entirely likeable, but really, who is? Well, aside from Claudia Oâ€™Doherty as Jacobsâ€™ roommate Bertie, whoâ€™s just an absolute delight in every scene.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. Daredevil\n\nThe dark drama let Netflix redeem Daredevil from the uneven 2003 Ben Affleck film. Charlie Cox steps into the role of the blind crime fighter who takes on the legal system by day and the criminals who hide in the shadows by night.Cox is rumored to be resurrected in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at some point, and one look at Daredevil's iconic bruiser of a hallway fight should show you why they want more.\n\n44. She's Gotta Have It\n\nSpike Lee takes his 1986 eponymous film and turns it into a show for Netflix, directing the production himself. The great DeWanda Rise plays Nola Darling, whose life in Brooklyn takes center stage throughout each episode. Dissecting the experiences of a young Black woman in New York, the series â€”which was cancelled after two seasons â€” was certainly undersung."
