        "text": "The Summer I Turned Pretty continues to make us swoon! Season 2 of the teen romance show is based off of the book series of the same name by Jenny Han, and premiered in July 2023. So, can we expect a season 3 announcement any time soon?\n\nKeep reading for details on TSITP season 3, how the ongoing writer’s and actor’s strikes could effect the show and more.\n\nWill There Be a ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’ Season 3?\n\nPrime Video officially confirmed season 3 of The Summer I Turned Pretty is on its way on August 3, 2023.\n\n“We’ve been delighted to see the passion with which fans have embraced The Summer I Turned Pretty, making Summer Fridays an entertainment phenomenon,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon and MGM Studios. “Jenny Han is a gifted storyteller, whose fans have been clamoring for the third chapter of this story. We’re excited today to share the news that they have a lot more Summer to look forward to.”\n\nPreviously, fans worried over a third season due to the ongoing 2023 writers and actors strikes. Since the strikes began, many shows and movies have been delayed or even cancelled, and when asked if the show will be greenlit for another season, writer, producer and showrunner Jenny previously said, “I hope so,” while chatting with CBS News in July 2023.\n\n“We can’t until the writers strike is over,” she said, explaining that season 3 news will only come until after the strike ends. “I hope that the studios will come back to the table and negotiate and we can get back to work.”\n\nShe added, “I think everyone wants to go back to work, including me.”\n\nWhen Is ‘The Summer I Turned Pretty’ Season 3’s Release Date?\n\nPrime Video confirmed that the third season of The Summer I Turned Pretty will be released in the summer of 2025. The last season of the show will include 11 all-new episodes.\n\nSince season 1 of TSITP first premiered in June 2022, Jenny has stated that the show would need three seasons for the three books the TV series is based off of.\n\nThe author explained that from the moment TSITP was given the green light, she knew production would “need more than one season to honor the story we are telling,” in a June 2022 statement.\n\n“It’s totally up to what Amazon wants and really, truly what audiences want. I would love to get three seasons because there are three books. So I would love to be able to finish telling that story the way that I wrote it,” Jenny told Variety at the time. “But I certainly don’t take anything for granted. I just hope people find the audience and people love it and want more.”\n\nScroll through our gallery for everything to know about The Summer I Turned Pretty season 3."
