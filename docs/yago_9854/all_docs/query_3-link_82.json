        "text": "Starring the likes of Doctor Who's Tosin Cole, The Responder's Adelayo Adedayo and The Rig's Calvin Demba, there's some stellar acting talent on display.\n\nIn fact, Cole recently opened up to RadioTimes.com about where he'd like to see Michael go in a potential season 2, saying: \"I'm interested to see the effects of what's happened in the first season has on him in the second season.\n\n\"I feel like the last time we see Michael in season 1, he seems a bit darker, he seems a bit revengeful. So I want to see how his vengeance takes place and how that has affected him and what his journey looks like, with that being his theme - that's what I'm looking forward to seeing.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nBut will there be a season 2 of Supacell? Read on to find out what we know so far.\n\n*Warning: Contains spoilers for Supacell season 1.*\n\nWill there be a Supacell season 2?\n\nThere will be!\n\nThe news was finally confirmed earlier this month with the news being released across Netflix's social channels.\n\nShowrunner Rapman previously exclusively told RadioTimes.com that he made it clear to Netflix that he actually has plans for at least three seasons before the debut of the first run.\n\n\"I told them that I want three seasons,\" he said. \"I suppose we have to see how season 1 performs. But I know I've very much made clear that I want to do three seasons minimum.\"\n\n\"I've got a three-season story in my head,\" he said. \"[I'm] not saying it can't go over. But right now, I know where it goes to. I know where... what the story is from up to season 3.\"\n\nRapman also told RadioTimes.com that he hopes the series might create a pathway for more sci-fi shows about Black British characters in the future.\n\n\"If you actually look back at UK shows, when have you ever seen a UK sci-fi – not that there's a lot of them anyway – but with a Black cast?\" he said.\n\n\"And even take out the UK, even going to the States, you could probably think of Black Panther. Or you could probably think of Black Lightning. The buck stops there, let's be honest. And it's like... why can't Black people be in a sci-fi space?\"\n\nHe added: \"So the hope is that this show does really well and it's just the beginning. There'll be others.\"\n\nWhen could Supacell season 2 be released?\n\nAs Supacell season 2 has just been confirmed, there's no real idea on when a potential second instalment could be landing on our screens.\n\nAlong with the series renewal announcement, there's been no news on production kick off dates or casting so we'll just have to wait and see. Seeing as the first season was filmed between July and December 2022, it could be a good turnaround between season 1 and a potential season 2.\n\nConsidering the filming process only took seven months, it's promising that it could be back on our screens in a speedy fashion - but then, considering the post-production meant season 1 wasn't released until mid-2024, it could be a little while yet.\n\nWatch this space for updates.\n\nWho could return for Supacell season 2?\n\nAs for who would be returning for a possible second season, we'd hope to see all of the main cast back – with the potential for some new characters too, perhaps.\n\nThe Supacell cast that we'd expect to see in a potential season 2 would be as follows:\n\nTosin Cole as Michael Lasaki\n\nYasmin Monet Prince as Veronica\n\nEddie Marsan as Ray\n\nNadine Mills as Sabrina\n\nEric Kofi-Abrefa as Andre\n\nCalvin Demba as Rodney\n\nJosh Tedeku as Josh\n\nRayxia Ojo as Sharleen\n\nGiacomo Mancini as Spud\n\nMichael Salami as Gabriel\n\nTravis Jay as John\n\nConsidering the ending to season 1, which saw shots fired at her car, we may not see Adelayo Adedayo back as Dionne - only time will tell!\n\nWhat could Supacell season 2 be about?\n\nAs for what a possible second season of Supacell could be about, the first season certainly left on quite the cliffhanger with shots fired at Dionne's car and Michael unable to turn back time to save her.\n\nLater, though, Michael meets the rest of the group at Onyx, where he tells them he's going to the future to find out answers, and aims to make everyone who hurt them pay for what they did.\n\nMeanwhile, at The Organization, Krazy has been found and put into recovery – just for Victoria to kill him off for failing her in getting Michael and the gang.\n\nAs they walk away, she coldly informs Ray he let her down, too… and now they’re going to do things her way.\n\nSo, it certainly leaves the door wide open for much more to be explored.\n\nSeason 1 focused on the impending prospect that Dionne, Michael's girlfriend, was going to die. As a result, Michael gets tested to the limit and develops superpowers along with four other Black South Londoners.\n\nThroughout the series, we follow each of them as they grapple with their powers and their newfound paths in life, making for some pretty major twists and turns.\n\n\"I feel like, with superpower shows, I never understand the reason where the powers come from – they don't even mention it, it's like a cop-out for me,\" Rapman said in a recent discussion in which he explained the key motivators behind creating the show.\n\n\"And I remember making this show... when I started to create it was when George Floyd just got murdered. Everyone felt down... and I wanted to do something to uplift Black people. And I knew a girl always in hospital, every couple of weeks she's in hospital [due to sickle cell disease – a condition which disproportionately affects Black people]... All the time.\"\n\nHe added: \"So I thought this is going to raise awareness, anybody watching it – even if it's not true, it's like if you are living with sickle cell, like, 'Oh that's nice I'm being mentioned and imagine if my kid did become super from that, that'd be dope.' [It's] just something to make you feel seen, man – it's important for me!\"\n\nSpeaking about his hopes for the series, the show's creator Rapman said: \"I just want [viewers] to watch it to the end. And I want people to see what they think about all the twists and turns and how they felt afterward.\n\n\"I didn’t slave over the show for people to go to the halfway point and turn over and watch something else. Let’s hope that the world receives it well.\"\n\nIs there a trailer for Supacell season 2?\n\nNo! As Supacell season 2 is even yet to be confirmed, there's no trailer for it just yet.\n\nSupacell is available to stream on Netflix from Thursday 27th June 2024."
