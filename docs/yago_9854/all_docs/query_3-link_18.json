        "text": "At last, The Chosen season four has a streaming date.\n\nThe biblical drama series that’s become a global sensation will begin releasing its fourth season Sunday, June 2, The Hollywood Reporter can exclusively report.\n\nInitially, the drama will be exclusively available on its own The Chosen app, with additional streaming and broadcast options being announced soon. The fourth season was previously shown in theaters via Fathom Events screenings, becoming the first TV series to run an entire season in theatrical release.\n\n“The wait is finally over,” said The Chosen creator Dallas Jenkins, who will host a livestream about the announcement shortly on the show’s YouTube page. “The response from those who’ve seen season four in theaters was that this is our best season, so I can’t wait to deliver these episodes free and easy to the world. We wanted to offer fans a chance to see it on the big screen together in theaters. But I’ve maintained the show will always ultimately be available free and easy, and we’re now ready for our livestreams, which are going to be bonkers this year.”\n\nAfter the season’s first episode is released June 2 at 7 p.m. ET, the second will be released Thursday, June 6, at 8:30 p.m., with ensuing episodes released on Sundays and Thursdays over the course of four weeks.\n\nThe announcement also means the independently produced series has settled its legal arbitration with Angel Studios, which has long had first window rights to distribute the show on its own app.\n\nThe news comes as THR releases an extensive sit-down interview with Jenkins, who details the origin of the series, his response to some of the show’s controversies, his plans for the most devastating crucifixion sequence in filmic history, and his plans for potential spinoffs, prequels and sequels to The Chosen. “One of the most exciting things is that so many people tell us they’re into the show in the same way they’re into Marvel or DC,” Jenkins says. “But we didn’t do it cynically — ‘Let’s create a Marvel experience and find content that fits.’ It started with the content.”\n\nThe season four description reads: “Clashing kingdoms. Rival rulers. The enemies of Jesus close in while His followers struggle to keep up, leaving Him to carry the burden alone. Threatened by the reality of Jesus’ growing influence, religious leaders do the unthinkable — ally with their Roman oppressors. As the seeds of betrayal are planted and opposition to Jesus’ message turns violent, He’s left with no alternative but demand his followers rise up.”\n\nThe Chosen‘s previous three seasons are currently available on Peacock, Prime Video and other streaming platforms. The Chosen app is available for download on streaming players or devices including Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, iOS and Android."
