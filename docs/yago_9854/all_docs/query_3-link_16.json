        "text": "FX on Hulu’s The Bear will dish up an all-new season to kick off summer. Season 2 already elevated the show with its numerous guest stars as well as the transition of the family sandwich shop into a fine dining establishment. Season 1 swept the first of two Emmys ceremonies this year, with the second hoping to follow in those footsteps.\n\nAfter Season 1 raked in its 10 Emmys at the 75th ceremony, the cast and crew had various responses to the comedy genre label. Since the show’s launch, stars Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri and Ebon Moss-Bachrach have all been cast in other high profile projects like Deliver Me From Nowhere for White, The Fantastic Four for Moss-Bachrach and Luca Guadagnino’s next film, The Hunt, for Edebiri.\n\nFans of the intense kitchen-set series may anticipate new faces and poignant needle drops like Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” for Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s Richie. Those curious about The Bear Season 3 release, cast date and more can find details about the next installment below.\n\nWhen will Season 3 of The Bear come out?\n\nOn May 9, FX revealed in a teaser trailer for the series, that Season 3 will launch on Hulu on June 27. The show has remained consistent with its premiere dates, all of which have been in June in consecutive years.\n\nJune 24 brought the news that the show would drop three hours earlier than planned, therefore landing June 26 at 9 p.m. Eastern time and 6 p.m. Pacific.\n\nHow many episodes are in Season 3 of The Bear?\n\nSeason 3 will contain 10 episodes. Season 1 only had eight episodes while Season 2 boasted 10.\n\nRELATED: ‘Fantastic Four’ Group Chat & ‘The Bear’ Season 3\n\nWhich episode of The Bear Season 3 did Ayo Edebiri direct?\n\nEdebiri, who stars as Sydney Adamu, directed the sixth episode of Season 3, titled “Napkins,” which follows the story of how Tina (Liza Colón-Zayas) came to work for the sandwich shop-turned fine dining destination.\n\nWill The Bear Season 3 drop all at once?\n\nYes, the third installment will be released in a binge on Hulu via FX.\n\nFX boss John Landgraf addressed the decision during an executive session at TCA.\n\n“We all watched the first season and it wasn’t lost on me or anyone else who worked on the show that it’s a little anxiety-inducing to watch that show and anxiety-inducing are not the adjectives typically associated with hit television shows and Emmy awards. So we made a decision that we would drop the whole thing because, for those of you who saw it, it has a really beautiful, very uplifting ending,” he said.\n\nLandgraf revealed that consideration was given to releasing Season 2 episodically after the critical success of Season 1, but ultimately to keep the integrity of all 10 episodes, FX decided to again keep it as a binge.\n\nRELATED: Jeremy Allen White Talks Hopes For Carmy As ‘The Bear’ Cast Discuss Filming Season 3\n\n“When we came back for Season 2, we debated, since we knew now that we had a hit, can we milk it a little bit? Can we roll it out over weeks, more Bear is better? We then thought that’s a rotten thing to do, to change it up for the audience. The way that Chris makes it, even though the episodes are separate, there’s a whole vibe to every season so we decided not to change what we had already set in motion and I have no doubt that we’ll keep doing it because we did it in the past. Even if we could, I don’t think we’d change it now,” he added.\n\nWho is in The Bear Season 3?\n\nJeremy Allen White’s Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto, Ayo Edebiri’s Sydney Adamu and Ebon Moss-Bachrach’s Richard “Richie” Jerimovich will all return for Season 3. The series also stars Abby Elliott, Lionel Boyce, Liza Colón-Zayas and Matty Matheson, with Oliver Platt and Molly Gordon in recurring roles.\n\nSeason 2 bosted guest stars like Will Poulter, Jamie Lee Curtis, Sarah Paulsen, Jon Bernthal, Bob Odenkirk, John Mulaney, Olivia Colman and more. FX has kept the lid on any potential guests for Season 3.\n\nRELATED: ‘The Bear’s Matty Matheson Thanks Restaurants, Accepts Kiss On Stage From Ebon Moss-Bachrach As Show Dominates Emmys With Six Wins\n\nWhat is The Bear Season 3 about?\n\nSeason three will follow Carmy, Richie and Sydney as they work to elevate the titular restaurant, which transformed from a gritty sandwich shop to a finer dining destination. The daily challenges of working in the restaurant business present an uphill battle for the kitchen staff, and Carmy only gets more intense as his staff tries to match him.\n\n“The quest for culinary excellence will propel the crew to new levels and stress the bonds that hold the restaurant together. As the team grows in size, each member will strive to reach a greater level of service within their role,” the daunting description reads. “In the restaurant industry, you’re never on solid ground, and with that ever-changing landscape comes new challenges and opportunities. Our chefs have learned that every second counts, but this season we’ll find out if they have what it takes to make it to tomorrow.”\n\nRELATED: Ebon Moss-Bachrach On That Emmy Kiss, ‘Fantastic Four’ Group Chat & ‘The Bear’ Season 3\n\nIs there a trailer for The Bear Season 3?\n\nThe official trailer teases a tense kitchen environment as Carmy sets his sights on a Michelin star. His intensity trickles down to his staff in different ways in the video with a contract to push boundaries with Sydney, an eagle-eyed comparison of two similar bowls for Ritchie and Neil Fak (Matty Matheson) overpouring a glass of water. Watch the fullest glimpse of Season 3 so far below:\n\nFX also released two teaser trailers, which can be viewed below.\n\nWhite posted a shorter teaser on his Instagram. In it, his character walks into the kitchen early in the morning to get to work.\n\nWill there be more seasons of The Bear?\n\nYes, after the November renewal for Season 3, Deadline reported that the show had been quietly picked up for a fourth season.\n\nWho created The Bear?\n\nCreator Christopher Storer executive produces with Joanna Calo, who serves as co-showrunner and directs, along with Josh Senior, Cooper Wehde, Tyson Bidner, Matty Matheson and Hiro Murai. Courtney Storer serves as a Co-Executive Producer and Culinary producer. The series is produced by FX Productions."
