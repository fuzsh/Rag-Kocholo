        "text": "Season two of The Bear transformed the fast-paced, stress-filled dramedy about a Chicago beef spot into an introspective, calming character study (which still features some heart-clutching moments). Now, we’re gearing up to get back in the kitchen for season three.\n\nThe first season of the FX series arrived on Hulu with a bang in 2022, as critics and fervent fans propelled the show from a stealth word-of-mouth hit to numerous award nominations (resulting in a staggering 10 Emmy wins this January). In season two, Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and his team attempt to open a new restaurant, the Bear, just 12 weeks after the closing of his late brother’s sandwich shop, the Original Beef of Chicagoland.\n\nFor those who have already torn through the entire second season, including that heart-wrenching finale, here’s what we know about the show’s future so far.\n\nHas The Bear been renewed for a third season?\n\nFX has confirmed The Bear will return for a third season in 2024, with filming having begun earlier this year.\n\nWhen will season three drop?\n\nOn May 9, White confirmed the third season will be unleashed on the masses on June 27, 2024. He announced the news on Instagram, in tandem with the release of a new teaser trailer that features Carmy standing alone in the Bear’s kitchen.\n\nThe teaser trailer hints at a “dysfunctional kitchen.”\n\nIn a teaser that dropped on May 24, the cast returns to The Bear's kitchen—as do plenty of mishaps, from servers crashing into plates to Carmy and Richie yelling bloody murder at each other. At the end of the clip, Sydney declares, “This is a dysfunctional kitchen.” The statement immediately prompts Carmy and Richie to yell back, “Show me a functional one!”\n\nThe chaos is explored more in a longer, full-length trailer which features Carmy, Syd and the rest of the crew struggling to keep up with the demands of a new restaurant and aiming for their first Michelin star.\n\nWhat will season three of The Bear be about?\n\nSeason two ends on friends-and-family night, as the restaurant takes a big step toward opening to the public. It’s likely that season three will see the Bear finally open its doors, and hopefully, business will be booming, since Carmy, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri, who this winter won a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice Award, and an Emmy for her performance), and the team still have to pay back Uncle Jimmy. The show will also likely continue to explore themes of loss and living with grief.\n\nWhite did share in a December 2023 interview with Variety that the series would return to a “functional kitchen atmosphere” à la season one."
