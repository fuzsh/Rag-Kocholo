        "text": "It's been a long, bumpy road to Euphoria season 3. Repeatedly struck by rewrites, delays, and other hurdles, many fans have worried that the hit series was doomed, headed straight for development hell. But according to optimistic new updates from the cast, crew, and HBO, Euphoria season 3 is officially on the way.\n\nThe HBO series, created by Sam Levinson, first premiered in 2019 and reached new heights with season 2, racking up unprecedented viewership momentum and inspiring Internet-breaking discourse on social media with each episode. Fans of the series consistently took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to live-post the entire second season and propose theories, discuss plot lines, and share memes. The interest is so high, even X confirmed Euphoria had become the most-tweeted-about TV show of the decade ahead of the season 2 finale on February 27, 2022. So, as expected, fans are already on the lookout for any news relating to Euphoria Season 3.\n\nWith that in mind, we've been scouring the internet for answers to all of your pressing questions about Euphoria season 3 — find out everything you need to know below.\n\n→ Plot\n\n→ Release date\n\n→ Why was the show delayed?\n\n→ Filming\n\n→ Time jump\n\n→ Cast\n\n→ Trailer\n\nWhy was Euphoria season 3 delayed?\n\nAfter literal years of setbacks, Euphoria season 3 is finally in progress. But why was it delayed in the first place? Euphoria was one of many highly-anticipated series affected by the Hollywood strikes, and faced additional obstacles like rewrites, cast availability, and even tragedy. The series' production timeline has been a true point of contention over the past two and a half years, with answers changing depending on who you asked and when.\n\n2022\n\nPre-strikes, fans previously speculated that season 3 could premiere sometime in 2024. At Euphoria's For Your Consideration event in Los Angeles in April 2022, Zendaya said a 2024 air date sounded somewhat “true.”\n\n“I honestly don't know,\" she said at the time. “There [are] some executives that know better than me, you might wanna ask them. I'm gonna be busy for a while.” While S3 of Euphoria was up in the air, the actor added three films to her roster: Dune: Part Two, Luca Guadagnino's steamy tennis drama Challengers, and A24's in-development Ronnie Spector biopic Be My Baby. (The former two films were also delayed because of the Hollywood strikes.)\n\n2023\n\nIn May 2023 mid-strikes, EVP of HBO Programming Francesca Orsi spoke to Deadline and shared updates about the production progress of key HBO titles.\n\n“Euphoria is one of those that we had begun writing in tandem with post-production on The Idol, but at this point, we don’t have countless scripts,” Orsi said. “We can’t start shooting, so the delivery of that show — ideally in 2025 — will be determined on when we can pick back up with Sam [Levinson], who at this point is all pencils down and just finishing posts on Idol.”\n\n2024\n\nSince the end of the WGA and SAG strikes in fall 2023, all pencils were back up — or so we thought. In January 2024, HBO chairman and CEO Casey Bloys told The Wrap that Levinson was hard at work writing the third season. However, Bloys was unable to share further details about the future of the show.\n\n“We'll see how it goes. He’s writing season 3 right now, he’s in the thick of it,\" said Bloys. \"So I don’t know that he is laying out what the future looks like. It’s just getting season 3 done. I haven’t had a specific conversation with him about is this the end or what does it look like.”\n\nSpeaking to GQ in February 2024, Colman Domingo (who plays Rue's sponsor Ali) provided a bit more context about the S3 delays, admitting that though while strikes have played a part, it's also creator Sam Levinson's own doing as he has a penchant for rewriting. “[Sam is] a person who writes and rewrites and writes and rewrites again, because I think he's wrestling with what's important,” Domingo told the publication.\n\n“He's responding immediately to what the ills of the world are,\" Domingo continued. \"I know that the one thing I can tell you is that he's very much interested in the existential question of who we are right now. Our souls. That's what he wants to figure out with season three.” A big task if you ask us but, hey, we're more than ready to be surprised.\n\nIn March 2024, main cast member Sydney Sweeney was promoting her two new films Madame Web and Immaculate when asked by MTV if she was planning to take a break after her hectic press run. Her answer: “I go into Euphoria.”\n\n“I always feel like I go home when I go back to it,” Sweeney said about returning to the Euphoria set, “I'm excited. It's like family.” While Sweeney did not share a specific timeline, everyone assumed that the transition into the HBO show would happen mere weeks later. However, the show's indefinite hiatus was announced shortly after Sweeney's comments.\n\n“I am thrilled that we are ready to begin production on Euphoria in January,” Francesca Orsi, the Executive Vice President of HBO Programming, said in a statement released to press. “We could not be happier with our creative partnership with [creator] Sam [Levinson] and this incredible cast… We look forward to bringing this new season of Euphoria to life for the fans.” It sounds almost too good to be true.\n\n“We’re looking at 2025,” Dane said during an appearance on Today With Hoda & Jenna, dispelling fan speculation that the show was headed for cancellation. “I’m optimistic that it's going to come back. There’s a real appetite for that show out there, and it’s just too good to let go of.” A few days after Dane's interview, Deadline also confirmed that the series was aiming \"for a 2025 debut.”\n\nNow, with production confirmed to pick up in January 2025, it seems more likely that Euphoria season 3 will hit our screens in 2026 or very late 2025 — especially now that, as noted by Deadline, production will now have to navigate the extra hurdle of filming around the schedules of cast members working on other productions after being given the green light to continue work in March.\n\nIt's safe to assume Euphoria season 3 will have eight episodes, as both seasons 1 and 2 contained eight episodes. (Rue's and Jules's special episodes, titled “Trouble Don’t Last Always\" and “F*ck Anyone Who's Not A Sea Blob,” aired in between seasons during the COVID-19 lockdown.) In spring 2022, beauty reporter Kirbie Johnson interviewed Euphoria MUA Donni Davy and learned that each episode of the show takes a full month to film. Which means production on the upcoming season won't wrap until at least August 2025.\n\nWhat will Euphoria season 3 be about?\n\nNow, this is the million-dollar question. Your guess is as good as ours. The season 2 finale left us with plenty of unanswered questions, so we can expect at least some of those to be addressed during season 3 — or so we hope. Rue's story is inspired by director Sam Levinson's own experiences, so audiences can also expect her to continue being the focus going forward.\n\nIn August 2022, series lead and executive producer Zendaya opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about what she's hoping to see in season 3, hinting at the show's rumored time jump for the third installment.\n\n“I think it’ll be exciting to explore the characters out of high school. I want to see what Rue looks like in her sobriety journey, how chaotic that might look,” said Zendaya. “But also with all the characters, in the sense where they’re trying to figure out what to do with their lives when high school is over and what kind of people they want to be. What was special about [season 2] was that we got to dive into [the other characters] in a much deeper sense. I think we can do that again with the third season. There’s so much talent, you want to make sure everybody has the chance to have that.”\n\nIf Zendaya's on board with a time jump, so are we. A time jump for season 3 makes total sense, considering Rue's closing monologue in the season 2 finale. Rue talks in past tense, as though she's speaking to the audience from the future — just how far in the future is the real question.\n\nAnd as of April 2023, we might have an answer. While speaking to Vogue, the show's costume designer Heidi Bivens opened up about the quickly-approaching start of production for the third season, and gave a major update on how big of a leap this time jump will take.\n\n\"I'm really excited to read the scripts. There is talk of it being approximately five years in the future and that they're not in high school anymore,\" said Bivens. “Dorothy's not in Kansas anymore. I mean, it might be a total trip. Who can say? But knowing Sam's brain, it's gonna be exciting, and he will challenge all of us, because he won't want to repeat himself. It'll be something new for the audience to discover.” Can we imagine the East Highland crew outside of the walls of high school? Well, it might be time to start envisioning it.\n\nWait, so is the Euphoria season 3 time jump confirmed?\n\nYes! Kind of. Max execs Casey Bloys and JB Perrette vaguely confirmed the Euphoria season 3 time jump in an exclusive interview with Variety on June 11, 2024, also admitting the time jump is one of the (many) reasons the series has suffered such severe delays.\n\n“[Creator and writer] Sam [Levinson] is working on [season 3 of Euphoria right now],” Bloys said in the interview. “There’s been a lot of back and forth… One of the issues I think that Sam is thinking about is that he doesn’t want to have it in high school anymore. That’s where it was set and what made sense then. So when you take it out of that, there’s a lot of back and forth about where to set it and how far in the future to set it and all that stuff. But I think he’s got a take that he’s excited about, and he’s busy writing.”\n\nMain cast member Conor Angus Cloud, who played Fezco “Fez” O'Neill, died on July 31, 2023, at age 25 from an accidental overdose. His Euphoria cast mates and other public figures across the entertainment industry shared heartfelt tributes for Cloud following his passing.\n\n“Words are not enough to describe the infinite beauty that is Angus (Conor),\" Zendaya wrote in a heartbreaking post to social media. \"I’m so grateful I got the chance to know him in this life, to call him a brother, to see his warm kind eyes and bright smile, or hear his infectious cackle of a laugh (I’m smiling now just thinking of it) I know people use this expression often when talking about folks they love… ‘they could light up any room they entered’ but boy let me tell you, he was the best at it.”\n\n“I’d like to remember him that way,\" she continued. \"For all of the boundless light, love and joy he always managed to give us. I’ll cherish every moment. My heart is with his mother and family at this time and please be kind and patient as grief looks different for everyone.”\n\nBarbie Ferreira left the show in 2022\n\nAs far as additional cast members go, their potential return is a mixed bag. Back in August 2022, actor Barbie Ferreira announced in an Instagram Story post that she would be leaving the cast ahead of season 3.\n\n“After four years of getting to embody the most special and enigmatic character kat, I’m having to say a very teary eyed goodbye,\" Ferreira wrote in her exit post. \"I hope many of you could see yourself in her like I did and that she brought you joy to see her journey into the character she is today. I put all my care and love into her and I hope you guys could feel it. Love you Katherine Hernandez🐱❤️.\"\n\nDiscourse around Kat Hernandez was at an all-time high during season 2 with many speculating about behind-the-scenes drama and the standing of the actor's relationship with Levinson. Regardless, Barbie's game-changing character Kat was one of TV's very best — and it is heartbreaking to have to say goodbye.\n\nDominic Fike may not return as Elliot\n\nIn February 2022, shortly after the season 2 finale, Dominic Fike told Jimmy Fallon that his character Elliot would “absolutely” be part of season 3. Now, nearly two years later, Fike is more uncertain about Elliot's return. While speaking to Variety at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival on January 19, Fike said reprising his role as Elliot “would be dope,\" but might require some reconnection. “I don't really talk to them anymore,\" said Fike.\n\nIn 2023, the musician opened up about Sam Levinson's failed plan to hire him a “sober coach” on the set of Euphoria season 2. Fike told Variety at Sundance that the coach was “a random lady that I’d never relate to. We had nothing in common. We didn’t come from the same places or the same problems. It was hard to take advice from someone like that or give a sh*t.”\n\nThe fate of Javon “Wanna” Walton's character is up in the air\n\nPerhaps the biggest mystery is the status of Javon “Wanna” Walton's return to the show. We all thought Walton's character, Ashtray, was killed after the season 2 finale. But is he really gone? Walton spoke to Entertainment Weekly after the finale, teasing a potential comeback for his character.\n\n“Well you see [Fez] get arrested, so I'm sure he is going to be in the back of a cop car. And with Ashtray, we're not 100 percent if he's dead, because you saw absolutely no blood, right? And you didn't see him fall. You did hear the bullet, but you didn't see him get shot. So, there [are] little things that could potentially bring him back for another season.”\n\nHopefully, that means we'll also get to see Chloe Cherry as Faye again. And who knows? Maybe season 3 will give us that Tom Holland cameo after all.\n\nIs there a trailer for Euphoria season 3?\n\nRight now, there's no trailer for Euphoria season 3, but we did get an announcement teaser featuring the series' logo and a big three behind it. The teaser was posted across all of Euphoria's official social media channels when the renewal was first announced."
