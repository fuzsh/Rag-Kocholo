        "text": "Therapists tell us that therapy teaches one how to feel. Many people don’t like facing strong emotions. Virginia Opera’s Madama Butterfly at George Mason University was an emotional opera that featured powerhouse performances. With themes of abandonment and cultural conflicts, Madama Butterfly makes the audience feel deeply.\n\nSet in post-WWII Nagasaki, Japan, in 1946, this opera follows the tragic story of Cio-Cio-San, a young Japanese geisha who falls in love with American Navy Lieutenant Pinkerton. Pinkerton leaves for America without a pregnant Cio-Cio-San. Cio-Cio-San’s hopes are challenged when Pinkerton returns to Japan and wants to wed an American woman and return Cio-Cio-San’s child to the United States.\n\nMuch has been written about the origins of the story and the troubling marital and racial themes in this work. It’s been estimated that at least 45,000 Japanese women married American soldiers after WWII. Many of them were seen as traitors to their race and religion. The producers published a list of resources about the show here.\n\nThe score was written by the classical composer Giacomo Puccini (1858–1924). The original opera premiered on February 17, 1904, and was a flop. Virginia Opera Resident Scholar Josh Borths spoke at length about the history of the opera here.\n\nThe cast’s vocals, sung in Italian, were strong and expressive, bringing the audience into the heartbreaking story. From Cio-Cio-San’s delicate soprano to Pinkerton’s impassioned tenor, each vocalist brought their role to life onstage. A drawback, however, was the English subtitles that were broadcast above the stage, which made for much head bobbing as I watched the players and the lyrics.\n\nKaren Chia-ling Ho was a tour-de-force as Cio-Cio-San. She literally sang Pinkerton’s praises. Her angelic voice was most haunting in the scenes in which she waited for Pinkerton to return. This was her Virginia Opera debut.\n\nJonathan Burton played Benjamin Franklin Pinkerton with vigor and the lack of empathy you’d expect for his character. Pinkerton spoke of his desire to get married to a “good American woman.” That character seemingly didn’t take marriage to a Japanese woman — or Japanese law — seriously. I was put off by Burton’s dismissal of his villain role and the jeers he got at the curtain call. (Similar to Shakespeare’s character and real-life English King Richard III, not everyone agrees Pinkerton is a villain.)\n\nKristen Choi was an audience pleaser as Cio-Cio-San’s maid Suzuki. Choi had great chemistry with Ho. Her alto voice was supreme. Opera News called her a “powerhouse in the making.”\n\nCio-Cio-San had a rival suitor to Pinkerton: Prince Yamadori. Despite his pleas for her to come and live in luxury with him, she “stood by her man.” Yamadori was well played by Yinghui He.\n\nGrant Youngblood played the American Consul Sharpless. He is a baritone with a commanding presence, who has been in a multitude of operas.\n\nAlana Kypros played Cio-Cio-San’s son, Sorrow. Kypros did much acting with subtle body language. Zizhao Wang turned in a good performance as the Imperial Commissioner.\n\nThe music in Madama Butterfly was somber. The orchestration beautifully conveyed the characters’ emotions. Conductor Adam Turner was flawless here.\n\nStage Director Mo Zhou and Assistant Director Adam Da Ros made all the elements of this complex show work well together. Zhou will direct the world premiere of The Big Swim at the Houston Grand Opera this season.\n\nThe stage design for Madama Butterfly was impressive. It consisted of a center-stage Japanese-style home with sliding doors and latticework walls. There was a charming, wooden footbridge house right. Above this, Scenic Designer Wallace Coberg, placed a cherry blossom branch, from which blossoms rained when appropriate. I liked the American President portrait props that got changed by Cio-Cio-San as the years went by.\n\nCostume Designer Ruoxuan Li earned her paycheck. The cute kimonos and dapper suits evoked the period. Complementing the costumes were Wig and Make-up Designer Elyse Messick’s impressive wigs that she put on the actors portraying Japanese women (some of whom were white and African American). I liked the changes in colors projected on the upstage scrim by Lighting Designer Marie Yokoyama.\n\nMadama Butterfly’s tear-jerking plot, music, and heartfelt singing combined to produce a powerful evening of opera. It’s an emotional journey that will have you thinking about its themes after it’s over.\n\nRunning Time: Approximately two hours and 45 minutes, including a 15-minute intermission.\n\nMadama Butterfly played March 16 and 17, 2024, presented by Virginia Opera performing at George Mason Center for the Arts at George Mason University, 4373 Mason Pond Drive, Fairfax, VA. For tickets to future George Mason Center for the Arts shows, find them online.\n\nThe Madama Butterfly program is online here.\n\nMadama Butterfly\n\nMusic by Giacomo Puccini\n\nCAST\n\nCio-Cio-San played by: Karen Chia-ling Ho\n\nLt.
