        "text": "When Japanese audiences encountered Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly”—a sumptuous Italianate treatment of a geisha’s doomed love for an American naval officer—they found it implausible, insulting, and riotously funny. In 1925, two decades after the opera’s première, the Japan Times reported “screams of hearty laughter” as spectators took in the posturings of a touring foreign troupe. Puccini’s habit of citing popular Japanese songs did not help matters. As Arthur Groos points out in “Madama Butterfly/Madamu Batafurai,” a new book about the opera’s Japanese sources and reception, the composer ignored advice about how to use his material appropriately. When Suzuki, Butterfly’s maid, prays at an alleged Buddhist shrine, she sings to the tune of “Takai Yama,” a song that extols cucumbers and eggplants. Furthermore, she garbles the names of Shinto gods, who don’t belong in a Buddhist setting to begin with. It’s similar, Groos writes, to “having a Catholic pray to Adam and Eve in front of a menorah.”\n\nNevertheless, Japanese audiences and artists have continued to engage with “Butterfly,” not least because it has influenced Western perceptions of Japan for generations. In the fifties, the Fujiwara Opera, based in Tokyo, collaborated with New York City Opera on a bilingual production: Japanese singers took the Japanese roles, and white singers portrayed the callous Lieutenant Pinkerton and the more sympathetic consul Sharpless. The 1953 musical “Chōchō-san Sandaiki” (“Three-Generation Butterfly”) wove Puccini’s characters and music into a tale of Japan under Allied occupation; the fact that the opera is set in Nagasaki added a shuddering layer of significance to that retelling. The scholar Mari Yoshihara, in a 2004 essay about the pioneering Japanese soprano Tamaki Miura, who won international fame as Butterfly, notes that the singer challenged restricted ideas of femininity at home.\n\nToday, as the American opera business grapples anew with the political baggage of its repertory, a fresh wave of “Butterfly” productions is arriving, with people of East Asian descent dominating the creative teams. Amon Miyamoto, Aria Umezawa, and Phil Chan have lately directed the work, at San Francisco Opera, New Orleans Opera, and Boston Lyric Opera, respectively. Earlier this month, at Detroit Opera, I saw a staging by Matthew Ozawa in which the story is framed as the increasingly disturbed fantasy of a modern American guy addicted to anime imagery and to V.R. technology.\n\nSome operagoers will inevitably protest that “Butterfly” should be left alone, as an innocent artifact of its time. Yet a work that delves into late-nineteenth-century sexual colonialism and makes ironic use of “The Star-Spangled Banner” cannot be stripped of its politics. As Groos and other scholars have noted, “Butterfly,” especially in its original version, has an anti-imperialist streak; Pinkerton, who goes through the motions of marrying Butterfly and then discards her, is a devastating caricature of cultural arrogance. After the opera’s unsuccessful première, at La Scala, in 1904, Puccini softened the Pinkerton character, but there remains enough of the initial idea for directors to run with. Butterfly, for her part, may be hemmed in by Orientalist stereotypes, yet she draws power from the opulence of the music that Puccini wrote for her. Grotesque in some ways, greathearted in others, “Butterfly” is the kind of piece that not only invites but requires reflection on the part of performers and spectators alike.\n\nAt the beginning of Ozawa’s “Butterfly” in Detroit, we see a bored young man alone in his apartment, which is decorated with Japanese posters and tchotchkes. He gets a beer out of the fridge—Sapporo or Kirin, no doubt. You have the sense of an emotionally shut-down business bro who studied for a semester in Tokyo. He settles into a chair and picks up his V.R. gear, at which point his modern world dematerializes. Ceremonially clad characters step out of the fridge; imperial sets slide forward. When Pinkerton is not in a scene, the singer who plays him often hovers to the side, gesturing and twitching in an indolent trance.\n\nThe framing is ingenious because it compensates for the opera’s misbegotten notions of Japan. When Shinto names are mangled, or when Chinese folk songs come out of nowhere, we can blame the protagonist’s muddled reverie. Even Puccini’s most questionable choice in his revision of the score—giving Pinkerton an aria of bathetic remorse—can be justified as a spasm of performative self-pity on the part of the player’s avatar. I remain convinced that the original “Butterfly,” in which the cowardly Pinkerton slinks away while “The Star-Spangled Banner” snarls dissonantly in his wake, is superior; New York City Opera’s staging of it in 1993 transformed my perspective on the work. But I also recognize the practical need to give the lead tenor something a bit more gratifying to sing.\n\nPuccini, a sovereign artist terrified of commercial failure, tinkered with “Butterfly” for several years, steadily backtracking on his provocative initial conception. Ozawa drops some of the later changes, essentially adhering to a version that was presented in Brescia, several months after the première. The most crucial difference comes in the Act II aria “Che tua madre,” in which Butterfly, processing the news that Pinkerton has abandoned her, imagines her future and that of Dolore, her child. In the Brescia version, as in the original, she spins out a triumphant scenario in which Dolore is discovered by the Emperor and raised to a high station. Puccini later inserted a different, more lachrymose text, one that forecasts her suicide. The original Butterfly is a prouder, steelier character, a shade closer to the imperious Tosca.\n\nSo she was in Detroit, in a formidable embodiment by Karah Son. Like many sopranos of East Asian background, Son has sung Butterfly over and over—in her case, more than three hundred times. She has not lapsed into routine. Her rendition of “Un bel dì” was a full-blown psychodrama, more a feverish hallucination of Pinkerton’s return than a hopeful vision of it. Eric Taylor, as Pinkerton, brought to bear full-voiced lyric ardor while also communicating the character’s rising unease over his entangled desires. Nmon Ford, as Sharpless, and Kristen Choi, as Suzuki, deftly navigated the show’s imaginary landscape. Kensho Watanabe, in the pit, led a confidently paced, vibrantly colored performance.\n\nWhat I like most in this “Butterfly,” which has also played at Cincinnati Opera and will travel next to Utah Opera and Pittsburgh Opera, is its conjuring of stage pictures that are at once beautiful to look at and troubling to think about. Ozawa’s collaborators—the design collective known as dots, the costume designer Maiko Matsushima, and the lighting designer Yuki Nakase Link—festoon the scene with glowing lanterns, cherry blossoms, and the like, but the images have a tacky, C.G.I.-like glow. Sometimes figures freeze and lights flicker, signalling a breakdown in the smooth function of the fantasy. It wasn’t clear to what extent the audience grasped the deconstructive agenda; I heard confused mutterings at intermission. The message of the closing tableau, though, should have been unmistakable. After Butterfly stabs herself, Pinkerton rushes onstage and clutches her, only to be left holding her bloody garment as she strides away. At the final, shocking triple-forte chord, she fixes the audience with an icy stare.\n\nThere are days, many days, when I miss the old City Opera. It rejuvenated audience favorites, like “Butterfly,” which remained piles of bric-a-brac at the Met. It took chances on American singers instead of flying in jet-lagged European stars. And it featured new works that the bigger company discovered only decades later. The Met opened its current season with Jake Heggie’s “Dead Man Walking”; City Opera presented the work in 2002, with the young Joyce DiDonato leading the cast. Coming in November is Anthony Davis’s “X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X,” which had its world première at City Opera in 1986. If the Met is looking for more inspiration in past City Opera seasons, it might consider Bernd Alois Zimmermann’s “Die Soldaten” (1991), Erich Wolfgang Korngold’s “Die Tote Stadt” (1975), and Alberto Ginastera’s “Don Rodrigo” (1966). Or it could come up with new ideas.\n\n“X,” which Detroit Opera revived last year, is a major work whose impact has deepened with time. “Dead Man Walking,” based on Sister Helen Prejean’s account of her friendship with a death-row inmate, made a feebler impression on its return to New York. It’s an uncommonly popular piece, having been staged by more than seventy companies around the world. But the score is derivative and discursive, reacting to the story instead of driving it. At the Met, the opera felt like a movie of the week blown up to CinemaScope dimensions. Frantically loud orchestral playing, under the overeager baton of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, only amplified the music’s limitations. DiDonato, again playing Sister Helen, and Ryan McKinny, as the inmate, were vocally secure and theatrically incisive; the production, by Ivo van Hove, undercut them with video trickery and a relentlessly chilly mise en scène. The execution scene had a clinical vividness, yet the barbaric politics of the death penalty remained an abstraction. Curiously, “Butterfly” in Detroit seemed more of the moment: it suggested how the virtual realm can infect and degrade the real one, turning us into prisoners of other people’s fantasies. ♦"
