        "text": "New Examples Appeal to Movie Buffs of Today — and Tomorrow Eye-catching new part and chapter openers spotlight recent movies like Man of Steel, Fruitvale Station, The Avengers, The Great Gatsby, The Heat, and Inception alongside classics like The Wizard of Oz, Psycho, and City of God, linking film’s rich history to contemporary cinema.\n\nReading about Film: Critical Theories and Methods C h A p T E R 1 1 427\n\nnew technology can be seen as merely enhancing the film experience as we have known it (for example, the return of 3-D technologies), in other ways it alters both the medium and our experience of it (for example, the puzzles, interactivity, and convergence culture of video games). Scholars continue to draw on the lega- cies of previous inquiries in film theory in order to identify the salient questions our contemporary audiovisual experience raises and to develop tools with which to address those questions.\n\n11.33 The Matrix (1999). “What is the matrix?” the film’s ad campaign asked. Postmodern theorist Jean Baudrillard is quoted in the film.\n\nThis chapter has aimed to demystify the field of film theory, which is not to imply that readers will not have to struggle with theory or do some work to understand film on a more abstract plane. Because film theory is a notoriously difficult discourse, any summary gives it much more continuity than it actu- ally warrants. The film journals in which filmmakers like Eisenstein or Louis Delluc debated the new medium are not unlike film blogs that today consider the future of cinema in an age of media convergence. In reading and pick- ing apart theorists’ work, it is important to recall that referring to “theory” in the abstract is misleading. In reviewing Stuart Hall’s approach to reception theory or Fredric Jameson’s definition of postmodernism, we look at concrete responses to intellectual challenges. The term “theory\" is a useful, shorthand way to refer to a body of knowledge and a set of questions. We study this corpus to gain historical perspective — on how realist theory grew from the effects of World War II, for example; to acquire tools for decoding our experi- ences of particular films — like the close analysis of formalism; and above all to comprehend the hold that movies have on our imaginations and desires.\n\n■ Consider whether cinematic specificity is affected by watching films across platforms.\n\n■ Think of insights from other academic disciplines or artistic pursuits that seem to be missing from this account of film theory, and consider what we might learn from these new approaches.\n\n■ How might the formalist and realist film theorists debate the return of 3-D technology?\n\n■ Consider how debates about race and representation raised by a film like 12 Years a Slave (2013) could be reframed by drawing on film theory.\n\nActivities ■ Do a shot-by-shot analysis of the opening sequence of a film. What\n\ncodes — of lighting, camera movement, framing, or figure movement — are used to create meaning?\n\n■ Compare reviews of a film from a number of different sources (and periods, if relevant). Pay particular attention to the time and place each review appeared. What does the range of reviews tell you about the film’s reception context(s)?\n\nC O n C E p T S A T w O R K\n\n13_COR_6354_11_396_427.indd 427 8/22/14 2:10 PM\n\nConcepts at Work Feature Better Connects Ideas and Films The chapter-ending Concept at Work feature clearly connects each key concept mentioned in the chapter to specific films — both those mentioned in the chapter and other notable examples.\n\nProven Learning Tools That Foster Critical Viewing and Analysis The Film Experience’s learning tools have been updated for this edition, including new Viewing Cues in every chapter, in-depth Film in Focus essays on films like Stories We Tell and Minority Report, Form in Action boxes with analysis of multiple films, and the very best coverage of writing about film.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola directed Apocalypse Now (1979), one of Hollywood’s most ambitious film narratives, not long after his blockbuster successes The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II and his ingenious The Conversa- tion. Coppola and his first successful films were part of an American renaissance in moviemaking during the 1960s and 1970s, revealing the marked influence of the French New Wave filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, and others who brought decidedly experimental and ironic attitudes to film narrative. Apocalypse Now is also one of the first serious attempts by a U.S. director to confront the lingering anger and pain of the Vietnam War, a then-recent and traumatic memory that Americans struggled to make sense of.\n\nThe film’s story is deceptively simple: during the Vietnam War, Captain Willard (played by Martin Sheen) and his crew journey into the jungle to find a maverick and rebellious U.S. Army colonel named Kurtz (Mar- lon Brando). The story describes Willard’s increasingly strange encounters in the war-torn jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia. Eventually he finds and confronts the\n\n240\n\nbizarre rebel Kurtz at his riverside encamp- ment in Cambodia.\n\nApocalypse Now constructs its story through a particular plot with a particular nar- rative point of view. The story of Willard and Kurtz could be plotted in a variety of other ways — by offering more information about the crew that accompanies Willard, for instance, or by showing events from an objective point of view rather than from one man’s percep- tions and thoughts. However, the film’s plot concentrates less on the war or on how Kurtz became what he is (which is the main topic of the characters’ conversations) than on Willard and his quest to find Kurtz.\n\nThe plot begins with the desperate and shell-shocked Willard being given the assignment to seek out and kill Kurtz, to “terminate with extreme prejudice,” and then fol- lows Willard on his journey as he encounters a variety of strange and surreal people, sights, and activities [Figure 6.43]. In one sense, the plot’s logic is linear and progres- sive: for Willard, each new encounter reveals more about the Vietnam War and about Kurtz. At the same time, the plot creates a regressive temporal pattern: Willard’s journey up the river takes him farther and farther away from a civilized world, returning him to his most primitive instincts.\n\nThe mostly first-person voiceover narration of Apoca- lypse Now focuses primarily on what Willard sees around him and on his thoughts about those events. At times, the narration extends beyond Willard’s perspective, showing actions from the perspective of other characters or from a more objective perspective, while still representing the other characters and events as part of Willard’s confused impressions. Bound mostly to Willard’s limited point of view, the narration colors events and other characters with a tone that appears alternately perplexed, weary, and fascinated.

The tale pits three ruthless farmers against Mr. Fox’s thrill-seeking thievery, pull- ing an array of animals into the fray in the process. Taking Ander- son’s predilection for telling stories through mise-en-scène to its extreme, the film sets its largely underground action within an elab- orately textured design. Since characters, props, and sets are all constructed, the film relies on the coordination of figure movement and lighting to direct the viewer’s attention to narrative elements.\n\nA scene depicting the displaced animals’ new home in Badger’s Flint Mine opens with Mole playing the piano in a relaxed manner reminiscent of 1950s Hollywood [figure 2.39a]. The space is large and tastefully lit by candles and a garland of what appears to be fruit and fake flowers entwined with twinkling lights. Even in this first im- age, however, the storage racks in the background indicate that the gracious living of Badger’s home is being challenged by an influx of refugees and the hoarding of stolen supplies.\n\nThe camera tracks right to a kitchen area [figure 2.39b]. Bright, cheery lighting highlights Rabbit chopping ingredients for a commu- nal meal, and the cramped space and detailed abundance of food (like the roasting rack of stolen chickens) indicates both the large number and the camaraderie of the refugee animals.\n\nThe camera moves right again to Mr. Fox and Badger, strolling past the opening to a bedroom where the feet of an exhausted ani- mal can be seen lying on a top bunk [figure 2.39c] and discussing the sustainability of the group’s current living arrangement.\n\nThe scene ends at a punch bowl [figure 2.39d], beyond which the makeshift aspects of the living arrangements are evident: stolen cases of cider, bags of flour, and chicken carcasses are stored in the background. It is at this point in the shot that Ash, Mr. Fox’s son, believing decisive action is needed to restore Mr. Fox’s honor, asks his cousin Kristofferson to help him retrieve his father’s tail from the ferocious Farmer Bean.\n\nProduction design by Nelson Lowery richly colors this tale in which animals dress and act more human than the humans hunting them.\n\nmise-en-scène in Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)\n\nform in action bedfordstmartins.com/filmexperience\n\nTo watch a video about the mise-en-scène of Fantastic Mr. Fox and a clip from the film, see the Film Experience LaunchPad.\n\n2.39b\n\n2.39c\n\n2.39d\n\n2.39a\n\n04_COR_6354_02_060_093.indd 85 8/14/14 8:31 PM 01_COR_6354_FM_i-xxii.indd 1 9/26/14 4:58 PM\n\nf o u r t h E d i t i o n\n\nt h E f i l m E x p E r i E n c E An Introduction\n\nTimothy Corrigan University of Pennsylvania\n\nPatricia White Swarthmore College\n\nBedford/St. Martin’s Boston • New York\n\n01_COR_6354_FM_i-xxii.indd 1 9/26/14 4:58 PM\n\nFor Bedford/St. Martin’s\n\nPublisher for Communication: Erika Gutierrez Developmental Editor: Jesse Hassenger Senior Production Editor: Harold Chester Senior Production Supervisor: Lisa McDowell Marketing Manager: Tom Digiano Copy Editor: Denise Quirk Indexer: Leoni McVey Photo Researcher: Jennifer Atkins Text Design: Jerilyn Bockorick Cover Design: William Boardman Cover Art: Drive-in movie theater. © Will Steacy/Getty Images Composition: Cenveo Publisher Services Printing and Binding: RR Donnelley and Sons\n\nCopyright © 2015, 2012, 2009, 2004 by Bedford/St. Martin’s All rights reserved.

Whether watching filmed im- ages unfold over a giant multiplex or local art-house screen, a state-of-the-art TV set or portable tablet, we have all experienced the pleasures that movies can bring: journeying to imaginary worlds, witnessing re-creations of history, observing stars in familiar and unfamiliar roles, and exploring the laughter, thrills, or emotions of different genres. Understanding the full depth and variety of the film experience starts with that enjoyment. But it also requires more than just initial impressions.\n\nThis book aims to help students learn the languages of film and synthesize those languages into a cohesive knowledge of the medium that will, in turn, en- hance their movie watching. The Film Experience: An Introduction offers students a serious, comprehensive introduction to the art, industry, culture, and experience of movies—along with the interactive, digital tools and ready-made examples to bring that experience to life.\n\nAs movie fans ourselves, we believe that the complete film experience comes from an understanding of both the formal and the cultural aspects of cinema. Knowing how filmmakers use the familiarity of star personas, for example, can be as valuable and enriching as understanding how a particular editing rhythm creates a specific mood. The Film Experience builds on both formal knowledge and cultural contexts to ensure that students gain a well-rounded ability to engage in critical analysis. The new fourth edition is better equipped than ever to meet this challenge, with the best art program in this course, revised Concepts at Work boxes that prompt students to connect their own film experiences to each chapter’s concepts, and the addition of dozens of new video clips and accompanying questions, providing accessible visual examples. The learn- ing tools we have created help students make the transition from movie fan to critical viewer, allowing them to use the knowledge they acquire in this course to enrich their movie-watching experiences throughout their lives.\n\nThe Best Coverage of Film’s Formal Elements We believe that comprehensive knowledge of film practices and techniques allows students a deeper and more nuanced understanding of film meaning. Thus The Film Experience provides strong and clear explanations of the major concepts and\n\n01_COR_6354_FM_i-xxii.indd 5 9/26/14 4:59 PM\n\npractices in mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound, plus the best and most extensive coverage of the structure of narrative film, genre, documentaries, and experimental films. Going beyond mere descriptions of the nuts and bolts of film form, The Film Experience highlights how these formal elements can be ana- lyzed and interpreted within the context of a film as a whole—formal studies made even more vivid by our suite of new online film clips.\n\nIn choosing our text and video examples, we draw from the widest variety of movies in any introductory text, demonstrating how individual formal elements can contribute to a film’s larger meaning. We understand the importance of con- necting with students through films they may already know, and we have added new examples referring to recent films like Man of Steel, The Great Gatsby, Life of Pi, The Avengers, The Bling Ring, and Fruitvale Station; we also feel that it is our responsibility to help students understand the rich variety of movies throughout history, utilizing classics like The Jazz Singer, Citizen Kane, The African Queen, Bonnie and Clyde, The Godfather, and Chinatown, as well as a wealth of experi- mental, independent, and international films.\n\nFully Encapsulating the Culture of Film In addition to a strong foundation in film form, we believe that knowledge of the nature and extent of film culture and its impact on our viewing experiences is necessary for a truly holistic understanding of cinema. As such, one of the core pillars of The Film Experience story has always been its focus on the relation- ship among viewers, movies, and the industry. Throughout, the book explores how these connections are shaped by the social, cultural, and economic contexts of films through incisive discussions of such topics as the influence of the star system, the marketing strategies of indies versus blockbusters, and the multi- tude of reasons why we are drawn to some films over others. In particular, the Introduction, “Studying Film: Culture and Experience,” explores the importance of the role of the viewer, recognizing that without avid movie fans there would be no film culture, and offers a powerful rationale for why we should study and think seriously about film. Chapter 1, “Encountering Film: From Preproduction to Exhibition,” details how each step of the filmmaking process—from script to release—informs, and is informed by, the where, when, and why of our movie- watching experiences.\n\nNew to This Edition Thanks to the valuable feedback from our colleagues and from our own students, in this new edition we have taken the opportunity to update and enhance The Film Experience for today’s students. As ever, The Film Experience continues to be the best at representing today’s film culture—with cutting-edge coverage of topics like 3-D technology, digital distribution, and social media marketing campaigns.\n\nLaunchPad Solo for The Film Experience Brings Film to Life—through Video This edition takes advantage of the media with a new online platform, home to numerous movie clips, video essays, discussion questions, and more—perfect for interactive learning. Bringing print and digital together, the Viewing Cue feature in the margins of each chapter now includes special video call-outs directing students to a film clip online in LaunchPad Solo for The Film Experience. The video essays are based on the book’s Film in Focus and Form in Action features and illustrate\n\nPreface vi\n\n01_COR_6354_FM_i-xxii.indd 6 9/26/14 4:59 PM\n\nthe concepts discussed in the chapter. Each film clip or video is accompanied by thought-provoking discussion questions. The LaunchPad Solo platform makes it easy to assign the videos and questions, and, because students will all have access to the same group of clips and activities, classroom conversations can start from a common ground. Access to LaunchPad Solo for The Film Experience can be pack- aged free with the book or purchased on its own.\n\nThe Strongest Art Program Available—Now Better Than Ever With more than nine hundred images—the best and most extensive art program in any introductory film text—The Film Experience visually reinforces all the major techniques, concepts, and film traditions discussed in the text. New part-opening and chapter-opening images cover both classic and contemporary cinema, and examples throughout the text have been updated and enhanced. As always, the vast majority of the images are actual film frames from digital sources, rather than publicity or production stills. We have selected the best available source versions and preserved the aspect ratios of the original films whenever possible.\n\nConcepts at Work Boxes Connect Concepts and Films The chapter-ending Concept at Work boxes have been strengthened to clearly con- nect each key concept mentioned in the chapter to specific films—both contemporary films students will recognize and memorable examples from the classics. This better connects the book’s history, theories, and ideas with students’ own film-watching experiences. The feature acts as an accessible walkthrough of the chapter, mak- ing connections to students’ experiences while also reviewing the material they’ve learned. These connections are further enhanced by end-of-chapter activities that can work as in-class discussions or homework assignments.\n\nNew Examples from a Broad Range of Films Appeal to Movie Buffs of Today (and Tomorrow) Each generation of students that takes the introductory course (from eighteen- year-old first-year students to returning adults) is familiar with its own recent history of the movies; hence we have updated this edition with a number of new examples that reflect the diverse student body, from Hollywood blockbusters such as The Hunger Games, Gravity, and Frozen to independent fare like Pariah, Much Ado About Nothing, and Stories We Tell, as well as popular international films like Persepolis, My Name Is Khan, and Oldboy.\n\nProven Learning Tools That Foster Critical Viewing and Analysis The Film Experience transforms students from movie buffs to critical viewers by giving them the help they need to translate their movie experiences into theoretical knowledge and analytical insight. Our host of learning tools includes:\n\n■ Compelling chapter-opening vignettes that immediately place students inside a film. Each vignette, many of them new to this edition, draws from actual scenes in a real movie to connect what students know as movie fans to key ideas in the chapter’s discussion. For example, Chapter 9 opens with a discussion of how the generic familiarity of the conventions and formulas in Edgar Wright’s Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World’s End contributes to our enjoyment of these films.\n\nPreface vii\n\n01_COR_6354_FM_i-xxii.indd 7 9/26/14 4:59 PM\n\n■ Film in Focus essays in each chapter that provide close analyses of specific films, demonstrating how particular techniques or concepts inform and enrich those films. For example, a detailed deconstruction in Chapter 4 of the editing patterns in Bonnie and Clyde shows how they create specific emotional and visceral effects.\n\n■ Form in Action boxes with image-by-image analyses in each formal chapter (Chapters 1–9), giving students a close look at how the formal concepts they read about translate onscreen. With several new additions, including Chapter 5’s comparison of the ways popular music has been used throughout film his- tory, each Form in Action essay brings key cinematic techniques alive and teaches students how to read and dissect a film formally.\n\n■ Marginal Viewing Cues adjacent to key discussions in the chapter highlighting key concepts, prompting students to consider these concepts while viewing films on their own or in class—and to visit our online clip library for some spe- cific examples.\n\n■ The best instruction on writing about film and the most student writing ex- amples of any introductory text. Praised by instructors and students as a key reason they love the book, Chapter 12, “Writing a Film Essay: Observations, Arguments, Research, and Analysis,” is a step-by-step guide to writing papers about film—from taking notes, choosing a topic, and developing an argument to incorporating film images and completing a polished essay. It includes several annotated student essays, including a new one on Steven Spielberg’s Minority Report.\n\nResources for Students and Instructors For more information on the student resources or to learn more about package options, please visit the online catalog at bedfordstmartins.com/filmexperience/catalog.\n\n■ For students and instructors: LaunchPad Solo for The Film Experience at bedfordstmartins.com/filmexperience.\n\nAvailable packaged free with The Film Experience or purchased separately, LaunchPad Solo features a collection of short videos, including both film clips and unique annotated video essays designed to give students a deeper look at important film concepts covered in the text.

Featuring Hollywood stars Amy Adams, Henry Cavill, and Russell\n\nCrowe and replete with elaborate special effects, the film was budgeted at over\n\n$200 million, and its blockbuster summer release followed an extensive advertising\n\ncampaign. A very different tale of justice, Ryan Coogler’s Fruitvale Station\n\nscreened at the Cannes Film Festival only weeks before the release of Man of\n\nSteel. It recounted the true story of a twenty-two-year-old African American\n\nwho struggles to right his life but who then becomes the tragic victim of urban\n\nviolence when he is shot and killed by a transit police officer. When its wider\n\ntheatrical release in July 2013 coincided with the acquittal of George Zimmerman\n\nfor his “Stand Your Ground” shooting of a young, unarmed African American in\n\nFlorida, Frutivale Station became a social lightning rod.\n\nSocial and institutional forces shaped these very different films in very\n\ndifferent ways — from their production through their promotion, distribution,\n\nand exhibition. Part 1 of this book identifies institutional, cultural, and\n\nindustrial contexts that shape the film experience, showing us how to connect\n\nour personal movie preferences with larger critical perspectives on film. The\n\nIntroduction examines how and why we study film, while Chapter 1 introduces\n\nthe movie production process as well as the mechanisms and strategies of film\n\ndistribution, promotion, and exhibition. Understanding these different contexts\n\nwill help us to develop a broad and analytical perspective on the film experience.\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 2 8/14/14 8:21 PM\n\nC H A P T E R 1 Encountering Film: From Preproduction to Exhibition ■ Stages of narrative filmmaking\n\n■ Mechanisms of film distribution\n\n■ Practices of promotion and exhibition\n\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nStudying Film: Culture and Experience ■ Identifying the dimensions and importance of film\n\nculture\n\n■ Appreciating, interpreting, and analyzing film\n\n■ Understanding the changing film experience\n\nTop: © Warner Bros.

Next to them in line is a professor who pontificates about movies and about the work of media theorist and counterculture critic Marshall McLuhan, author of Understanding Media and The Gutenberg Galaxy. Alvy grows more and more irritated by the conversation, and finally interrupts the professor to tell him he knows nothing about McLuhan’s work, as Annie looks on, embarrassed. When the professor objects, Alvy counters by bringing McLuhan himself out from a corner of the lobby to confirm that the professor is all wrong about McLuhan’s writings. While this encounter among movie- goers comically exaggerates a secret wish about how to end an argument about the interpretation of movies, it also dramatizes, with typical Allen humor, the many dimensions of film culture — from scholarship to courtship — that drive our pleasure in thinking and talking, both casually and seriously, about film. For Alvy and many of us, going to the movies is a golden opportunity to converse, think, and disagree about film as a central part of our everyday lives.\n\nStudying Film Culture and Experience\n\nIntroduction\n\nCourtesy Everett Collection\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 5 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\nFor more than a century, the movies have been an integral part of our cultural experience, and as such, most of us already know a great deal about them. We know which best-selling novel will be adapted for the big screen and what new releases can be anticipated in the summer; we can identify a front-runner for a major award and which movie franchise will inspire a Halloween costume. Our encounters with and responses to motion pictures are a product of the diverse attitudes, back- grounds, and interests that we, the viewers and the fans, bring to the movies. These factors all contribute to the film culture that helps frame our overall film experience.\n\nFilm culture is the social and historical environment that shapes our expectations, ideas, and under- standing of movies. Our tastes, viewing habits, and venues all inform film culture; in turn, film culture transforms how we watch, understand, and enjoy movies in a variety of rapidly expanding ways.

For example, your opinions about casting certain actors in the film Precious (2009) may reflect your understanding of how common movie character types appear and function; your mesmerized attraction to the special effects of In- ception (2010) may pique your curiosity about new cinematic technology; your expectations of genre formulas, such as those found in the classic horror movie The Shining (1980), may provoke an outburst when a character heads down a darkened corridor. Film studies — the discipline — takes your common knowledge about and appreciation for film and helps you think about it more analytically and more precisely.\n\nFilm studies is a critical discipline that promotes serious reflec- tion on the movies and the place of film in culture. It is part of a rich and complex history that overlaps with critical work in many other fields, such as literary studies, philosophy, sociology, and art history. From the beginning, the movies have elicited widespread attention from scientists, politicians, and writers of many sorts — all of them attempting to make sense of the film experience [Figure I.2]. A film’s efforts to describe the world, impose its artistic value, or shape society have long been the subject of both scholarly and popular debate. In the decades before the first public projection of films in 1895, scientists Étienne-Jules Marey and Eadweard Muybridge embarked on studies of human and animal motion that would lay the groundwork for the invention of cinema as we know it. In the early twentieth century, poet Vachel Lindsay and Harvard psychologist Hugo Münsterberg wrote essays and books on the power of movies to change social relationships and the way people perceive the world. By the 1930s, the Payne Fund Studies and later Margaret Farrand Thorp’s America at the Movies (1939) offered sociological accounts of the impact of movies on young people and other social groups. Eventually courses about the art of the movies began to appear in universities, and elite cultural institutions such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York City began to take the new art form seriously.\n\nI.2 Mon ciné.

Such criticism fueled film studies, which attained a firm foothold in North American universities by the 1970s. Today the study of film represents a wide spectrum of approaches and points of view, including studies of different historical periods or national cinemas, accounts of economic and tech- nological developments, studies of how race and gender are depicted in movies and affect audiences’ responses to them, and explications of particular aesthetic or formal features of films ranging from experimental to documentary to narrative cinema.\n\nOne sign of today’s rich film culture is the popular demand for DVD supplements — “extras” that have been called “film studies on a disk” [Figure I.4]. Many of us now rent or purchase DVDs and Blu-rays not just for the movies themselves but also for the extra features; these may include a film expert’s commentary, a director’s discussion of some of the technical decisions she made during filming, or his- torical background on the story behind the film. Some DVD editions address issues that are central to film studies, such as preservation of original promotional or textual materials. Trailers and posters that provide a glimpse of film culture at\n\nthe time of the film’s release, as well as scholarly commentary, are now available to the everyday film viewer. For example, in the Treasures from American Film Archives series, early films, hard- to-find gems, restored classics, and film experi- ments have been preserved and contextualized with scholars’ voiceovers, making accessible to consumers works that were previously only avail- able to experts. With research on movies facilitated by the Internet, the complexities and range of films and film cultures may now be more available to viewers than ever before.\n\nThe Film Experience provides a holistic perspec- tive on the formal and cultural dynamics of watch- ing and thinking about movies. It does not privilege any one mode of film study over another, but rather provides critical tools and perspectives that will allow individuals to approach film study according to their different needs, aims, and interests. Addi- tionally, it provides the vocabulary needed to under- stand, analyze, and discuss film as industry, film as art, and film as practice. The Film Experience raises theoretical questions that stretch common reactions.\n\nThese questions include psychological ones about perception, comprehension, and identification; philosophical ones about the nature of the image and the viewer’s understanding of it; and social and historical ones about what meanings and messages are reinforced in and excluded by a culture’s films. Far from destroying our pleasure in the movies, studying them increases the ways we can enjoy them thoughtfully.\n\nI.3 Cahiers du cinéma.

Since the beginning of film history, the power of the movies has derived in part from viewers’ personal and sometimes idio- syncratic responses to a particular film and in part from the social and cultural contexts that surround their experience of that film. Early viewers of the Lumière brothers’ Train Arriving at a Station (1894) were rumored to have fled their seats to avoid the train’s oncoming rush; new interpretations of such first-encounter stories suggest that view- ers attended the screening precisely for a visceral entertainment not found in their normal social lives [Figure I.5]. In a more contemporary example, some individuals reacted on a personal level to Avatar (2009), breathlessly absorbed in a love story that harks back to Romeo and Juliet and over- whelmed by breathtaking visual movements that re-create the experience of amusement park rides. Other viewers dismissed the film because it offered what they saw as a sim- plistic political parable about corporate greed, terror, and exploitation far out of line with contemporary realities, disguising its bland characters and predictable story with jazzy special effects [Figure I.6].\n\nWhile certain approaches in film studies look first at a film’s formal con- struction or at the historical background of its production, The Film Experience begins with an emphasis on movie spectators and how individuals respond to films. Our different viewing experiences determine how we understand the mov- ies, and, ultimately, how we think about a particular movie — why it excites or disappoints us. The significance of movies, in short, may lie not primarily in how they are made but rather in how we, as viewers, engage with and respond to them. As movie spectators, we are not passive audiences who simply absorb what we see on the screen. We respond actively to films, often in terms of our different ages, backgrounds, educational levels, interests, and geographi- cal locations. It is the richness and complexities of these fac- tors that make film viewing and film study a profound cultural experience. In short, our engage- ment with a movie goes beyond determining whether we like or dislike it. As active viewers, we\n\nI.5 Poster for public screening of early films by the Lumière brothers.

Many viewers responded favorably to Sigourney Weaver’s strong female character in the film; others joined an Internet campaign against the film’s depiction of smoking.\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 9 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\nP A R T 1 Cultural Contexts: Watching, Studying, and Making Movies10\n\nengage with a film in energetic and dynamic ways that The Film Experience aims to encourage and direct.\n\nOur reactions are not only personal but also have important public and social dimensions. For instance, when Precious was released, many viewers were predisposed to appreciate it because of critics’ reviews and word-of-mouth praise that followed the film’s appearances at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals. As the film continued to play in wider release, its numerous Academy Award nominations and subsequent awards for best supporting actress and best adapted screenplay also influenced audiences’ curiosity about it and their reac- tions to it. In a dramatic move, Oprah Winfrey, who came on board as one of the film’s executive producers, energetically endorsed Precious on her television show. All the while, buzz about the film spread via Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites, as well as through the entertainment media and daily con- versations. The film touched a cultural nerve in a twenty-first-century American society still struggling with issues of racial inequality, the economic despera- tion of an urban underclass, sexual abuse, and body image. Precious arrived at the right time for many reasons, becoming an unexpected social barometer and provocation for audiences concerned about these issues. Discussions of the film’s dramatic images and events thus connected emotional responses with wider social dynamics.\n\nAt the intersection of these personal and public experiences, each of us has developed different tastes — cultural, emotional, intellectual, and social preferences or interests — that influence our expectations and lead us to like or dislike particu- lar movies. Some tastes vary little from person to person; most people prefer good characters to bad ones and justice served to justice foiled. Yet many tastes in mov- ies are unique products of our experiential circumstances or experiential histories. Experiential circumstances are the material conditions that define our identity at a certain time and in a certain place, such as our age, gender, race, linguistic and socioeconomic background, and the part of the country or world in which we live. For example, children are drawn to animated features with cuddly creatures and happy resolutions, whereas older adults have more patience for complicated plotlines or films with subtitles.\n\nExperiential histories, such as our education, relationships, travels, and even the other films we have seen, are the personal and social encounters through which we have developed our identities over time. These histories help determine\n\nindividual as well as cultural tastes. For example, a World War II veteran, because of his experiential history, might have a particular taste for WWII films [Figure I.7], ranging from such sentimental favorites as Mrs. Miniver (1942) to the harder- hitting dramas Saving Private Ryan (1998) and Flags of Our Fathers (2006). An audience’s taste in films is often tied to historical events, drawing viewers to see films about lived-through experiences such as the Watergate scandal depicted in Oliver Stone’s Nixon (1995) or the Sep- tember 11 terrorist attacks on the United States dramatized in Stone’s World Trade Center (2006).\n\nBut experiential influences are not limited to history. American college students may be drawn to Wes Ander- son’s Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) as fans\n\nI.7 Saving Private Ryan (1998). Steven Spielberg’s hard-hitting film was hailed by veter- ans as a realistic depiction of what American combat troops encountered during the invasion of Normandy. Veterans with experiential histories in combat might be drawn to war films as presentations of or homages to their experiences.\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 10 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\n11\n\nof the director’s debut film Rushmore (1998) or because they read Roald Dahl’s books as children. Big-screen adaptations, when an artistic work such as a book, television show, or musical is turned into a film, attract the fans from the original medium. For example, Dream- girls (2006) might attract African Ameri- can audiences familiar with the history of Motown music, Broadway fans familiar with the original musical, or fans eager to see pop star Beyoncé in a dramatic role [Figure I.8].\n\nOur experiential circumstances and histories may predispose us to certain tastes and responses, but these are acti- vated when we actually watch a film by two psychological processes that come into play simultaneously: identification and cognition.\n\nIdentification, the complex process through which we empathize with or project feeling onto a character or an action, is commonly associated with our emotional responses. Both adolescent and adult viewers can respond empa- thetically to the portrayal of the social electricity and physical awkwardness of teenage sexuality in American Graffiti (1973), The Breakfast Club (1985), or Superbad (2007), though different generations might find the music of one movie or the fashions of another more resonant, and male viewers are likely to relate more easily — or uneasily — to the high school boys at the center of Superbad than are female viewers [Figure I.9]. Each of us may identify with dif- ferent minor characters (such as the nerd Brian or the prom queen Claire in The Breakfast Club), but the success of a film often depends on eliciting audience identification with one or two of the main characters (such as Curt and Steve, the two boys who are about to leave for college in American Graffiti). Identification is sustained as the main characters face conflict and choices. Using another example, while watching the musical An American in Paris (1951) [Figure I.10], one viewer may instantly relate to the carefree excitement of the opening scenes by identifying with the street life of the artistic Montmartre neighborhood where she had lived as a college student. Another viewer who has never been to Paris may participate vicariously because the film so effectively re-creates an atmo- sphere of romance with which he can identify. Sometimes our preference for a particular film genre aids — or detracts from — the process of identification. Viewers who favor the adrenaline rush of horror films may have less interest and enthusiasm when faced with the bright colors and romantic plotlines associated with American musicals of the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nCognition, or the aspects of com- prehension that make up our rational reactions and thought processes, also con- tributes to our pleasure in watching mov- ies. At the most basic cognitive level, we process visual and auditory information indicating motion, the passing of time,\n\nI.8 Dreamgirls (2006). Musical adaptations often draw their fan base from audiences familiar with the Broadway productions or the pop singers, like Beyoncé Knowles, featured in the cast.\n\nV I E W I N g C U E What types of films do you identify with most closely? Are they from a particular country or era or particu- lar genres? Do they feature certain stars or a particular approach to music or settings?\n\nI.9 Superbad (2007). In this Judd Apatow production, the main characters are two male ado- lescents who spend most of the movie in search of booze to impress girls. Gender identification is an important, though not necessarily predictable, aspect of the viewer’s experience of the film.\n\nStudying Film: Culture and Experience I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 11 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\nP A R T 1 Cultural Contexts: Watching, Studying, and Making Movies12\n\nand space as we watch movies. At another level, we bring assumptions about a given location or setting to most films, we expect events to change or progress in a certain way, and we measure characters against similar char- acters encountered elsewhere. Thus watching a movie is not only an emotional experience that involves identifying through processes of participation and empathy but also a cognitive process that involves the intellectual activities of comparison and comprehension. Engaged by our emotional identification with the ter- rors or triumphs of Russell Crowe’s character in Gladiator (2000), for example, we also find ourselves engaged cognitively with other aspects of the film [Figure I.11]. We recog- nize and distinguish the Rome in the movie through particular visual cues — the Colosseum and other Roman monuments — known perhaps from studies in world history, pictures, or other movies. We expect we will know who will win the battles and fights because of\n\nwhat we’ve learned about such skirmishes, but that knowledge won’t necessarily prepare us for the extreme and graphic violence depicted in the film. Because of other experiences, we arrive at the film with certain assumptions about Roman tyrants and heroes, and we appreciate and understand characters like the emperor Commodus or the gladiator Maximus as they successfully balance our expectations with surprises.\n\nEven as we are drawn to and bond with places, actions, and characters in films, we must sometimes reconsider how those ways of identifying develop and change as part of our intellectual or cognitive development. Indeed, this process of cognitive realignment and reconsideration determines to a large degree our reaction to a movie. In The Bridges of Madison County (1995), for example, Clint Eastwood, best known for playing physically tough and intimidating characters, plays a reflective and sensitive lover, Robert Kincaid. Viewers familiar with East- wood’s other roles who expect to see the same type of character played out in The Bridges of Madison County must reconsider what had attracted them to that star,\n\nas well as assess how those expecta- tions have been complicated and are now challenging their understanding of The Bridges of Madison County. Does this shift suggest that the film is about a human depth discovered within older masculinity or about the maturing of that masculinity through the encounter with an equally strong woman (Meryl Streep as Francesca Johnson)? Whether we are able to engage in that process and find the realignment convincing will lay the foundation for our response to the movie. Thus what we like or dis- like at the movies often relates to the simultaneous and evolving processes of identification and cognition.\n\nI.11 Gladiator (2000). Viewers cognitively process historical knowledge, narrative recogni- tion, and their own visceral responses when watching historical scenes such as the ones seen in Gladiator.\n\nI.10 An American in Paris (1951). The setting of a film may be a source of identification.\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 12 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\nFORM IN\n\nACTION\n\n13\n\nThe processes of identification and cognition that underlie how viewers interact with films contribute to the breadth of films pro- duced and the different ways they are understood and enjoyed. Some films elicit identification through action, special effects, or stars, while other films produce more cognitive relationships with their audiences through their analysis of current events or by creating witty and ironic perspectives on characters or their circumstances.\n\nHollywood blockbusters like Fast & Furious 6 (2013) attract large audiences who expect to be entertained by action, spectacle, and special effects without having to think too deeply about plot, char- acter, or realism [Figure I.12a]. Ponyo (2008), a Japanese-made, Japanese-language animated fantasy about a surprising friendship, was released in the United States with well-known actors voicing the characters in English [Figure I.12b]. This family-friendly offering nev- ertheless captivated plenty of anime enthusiasts as well as adults dazzled by its visual daring. The documentary Client 9 (2010) is an engrossing dissection of former New York governor Eliot Spitzer’s fall from power as well as an indictment of corporate greed. Its emphasis on contemporary American politics and its exploration of prostitution and corruption undoubtedly shaped its appeal while upping the ante on its perceived importance [Figure I.12c]. Indepen- dently produced films like Juno (2007), which deals in a humorous and sassy way with teen pregnancy, may appeal to a wealthier, more urban demographic comfortable with ironic, irreverent depictions of social problems [Figure I.12d].\n\nIdentification, Cognition, and\n\nFilm Variety\n\nI.12a\n\nI.12d\n\nI.12c\n\nI.12b\n\nFORM IN ACTION bedfordstmartins.com/filmexperience\n\nTo watch a clip from Juno showing identification, see the Film Experience LaunchPad.\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 13 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\nA particularly rich period of cinema flourished after World War II and lasted until the 1970s. Often designated in groups of “new waves,” filmmakers from different coun- tries shared two common postwar interests: (1) the use of film as an expression of one’s artistic vision — commonly referred to as “auteurist” cinema — and (2) a break from the polished look of industry films of the times. The first and most influential new wave cinema occurred in France. Known as the French New Wave, these filmmakers were\n\n14\n\ngenerally characterized by experimenting with new cin- ematic styles, searching for more honest forms of realism, and often creating more dynamic and active rapports with their audiences. As a consequence, audiences were com- monly asked to understand and identify with these films in innovative and sometimes disconcerting ways.\n\nOne of the most important films in the birth of the French New Wave was François Truffaut’s The 400 Blows (1959), which is a realistic portrayal of a rebellious adoles- cent named Antoine Doinel whose search for identity on the streets of Paris is saturated with questions about sexuality, authority, family, economics, and education.\n\nLike the protagonist of the film, Truffaut was himself both a bad boy and a writer, in both cases known for “rais- ing hell” — which is an idiomatic translation of the film’s French title, Les quatre cents coups. Frequently acknowl- edged as a sign of “auteurist” cinema in which a film rep- resents the filmmaker’s personal vision, this close relation between that protagonist and the director’s own life pro- vides a foundation for a sympathetic identification between the filmmaker, his main character, and the viewer [Fig­ ure I.13]. Truffaut’s own youth, like that of Doinel, was that of a troubled truant and sometime thief ultimately redeemed by the cinema. Like Antoine, he was weaned on the cinema, and as a teenager he started his own cine-club, the Film Addicts Club. Shortly after this, he enlisted in the army, but after another of many “escapes” from various institutions, he was released because of an “unstable character.”\n\nEventually Truffaut found a surrogate father figure in the great film scholar (and co-founder of the journal Cahiers du cinéma) André Bazin, to whom The 400 Blows is dedicated in its credits and to whom Truffaut’s parents even gave legal guardian rights. That Truffaut quickly be- came one of the most vociferous and controversial writers about film of the 1950s and was recognized as the primary scholar and archivist for Cahiers du cinéma extends this autobiographical or auteurist reading of the film to a larger cultural and historical understanding, in which audiences of the 1950s were confronted with film experiences that\n\nFILM IN FOCUS\n\n157010\n\n157010\n\nThe 400 Blows: An Auteur’s Film Experience ( 1959 )\n\nSee also: Le Beau Serge (1958); Breathless (1960); Elevator to the Gallows (1958)\n\nFILM IN FOCUS bedfordstmartins.com /filmexperience\n\nTo watch a clip from The 400 Blows, see the Film Experience LaunchPad.\n\nI.13 François Truffaut.

The film relies extensively on location shooting across Truffaut’s Paris to create a world that seems true to life as it is lived, not as it is portrayed in glossy, studio-produced films. The style of the film — its use of a discontinuous editing style and lightweight, handheld camera equipment — produces a sense of freshness, energy, and immediacy that call attention to a new kind of filmmaking and new ways of viewing for the audience.\n\nFocusing this realism further, the main character of the film, Antoine Doinel, is played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, a young teenager with no acting experience who brings an unrehearsed energy to the character of a young boy constantly confronting a seemingly endless variety of authority figures and institutions — schoolteachers, par- ents, police — bent on controlling him. The gritty street realism and the naive energy of the actors that underpin this production are the essence of what the film aims to communicate. Considering how viewers respond to this realism and Doinel — with sympathy, understanding, alienation, or confusion — is just one of the many paths into the experience of this landmark film.\n\nAs another layer in the viewer’s encounter with The 400 Blows and an understanding of it, Truffaut inserts a self-conscious awareness of movie history into the film. During the longer sequence when Antoine and René skip school and make a quick trip to the cinema, for example, Antoine climbs aboard the spinning carnival ride called\n\nthe “Rotor” [Figure I.14]. For film historians especially, the scene becomes an unmistakable metaphor for the cinema itself, as the ride resembles that nineteenth-century precursor of the cinema, the zoetrope, and contains a historical reference to the paternity of Alfred Hitchcock (specifically the climactic carousel sequence in Strangers on a Train [1951]). More important, perhaps, Truffaut’s cameo presence in this scene relates historical refer- ences such as this both to Antoine’s story and to the liberating power of the cinema. The rollicking celebration of movement is not just a vehicle for narrative but also the expression of energy and delight, both Antoine’s and the filmmaker’s. Antoine and René’s wild ramble as they play hooky through the streets of Paris highlights the unpredictable realism of the film’s aesthetic but simulta- neously visually liberates the characters and the images from conventional laws of nature and cinematic realism.\n\nLike those other stylistic innovations, the film’s fa- mous last shot — a track to a freeze frame of the young Antoine’s face [Figure I.15] — can also be seen as a use of style to pose a cognitive dilemma, and to open up culturally embedded processes of interpretation. This unusually long track (lasting more than eighty seconds) of the fleeing Antoine usually unsettles first-time viewers, particularly since his goal or destination is unclear. This cognitive provoca- tion continues when his face looks directly at the camera, perhaps as a question or perhaps as a confrontation. What is he thinking? What are we meant to understand happens next? The film leaves these questions unanswered, and we as viewers must reflect back on the boy’s story and bring our individual experiential circumstances and histories to bear in our response.\n\nI.14 The 400 Blows (1959). The carnival ride is a metaphor recalling the disorienting, exhilarating machinery of film.\n\nI.15 The 400 Blows (1959). The film ends with a famous, ambiguous freeze frame in which Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel gazes directly at the camera.\n\nStudying Film: Culture and Experience I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 15 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\nP A R T 1 Cultural Contexts: Watching, Studying, and Making Movies16\n\nThe Film Experience\n\nWhat a movie looks and sounds like is of course at the heart of any film experience, and much of The Film Experience is devoted to exploring in detail those many visual, audio, narrative, and formal features and forces that we see on the many screens around us. But it is viewers who ultimately process those images and sounds — in different and diverse ways that bring meaning to film culture and to their lives. The cinematic complexities of Citizen Kane (1941), for example, are technically the same for each person, but they provoke different responses in every viewer [Figure I.16]. Hardly a typical viewer, newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst reacted nega- tively to the film and claimed it to be an inflammatory portrait of himself, refusing to allow his papers to carry ads for it. In the 1950s, French writers and filmmakers hailed the film as evidence of the power of the filmmaker to create a personal vision of the world. In recent decades, the film’s consistent ranking at or near the top of critics’ polls has influenced increased viewing of Citizen Kane, thus illustrating how viewers respond to both the movie and its perceived place in film history. With any film, some viewers may find importance in the technological or economic features; others may highlight the aesthetic or formal innovations; and still others may emphasize a film’s historical or social significance as its most meaningful quality. The same film, in fact, could lead different moviegoers to any one of these (or other) critical pathways,\n\nand it is less a question of which is the most important way to engage the film than one of which provides the most productive encounter for each individual viewer.\n\nViewers’ experiences of the movies — their shared expe- riences of film culture as well as their individual interpreta- tions guided by identification and cognition — are the starting point of The Film Experience. Part 1 examines how processes and patterns of production, distribution, and exhibition present a film in particular ways, creating social contexts in which audiences encounter the movies. Part 2 presents the four formal systems that structure films — mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, and sound — showing how view- ers derive meaning from familiar as well as innovative forms and patterns. Part 3 introduces and analyzes the primary modes through which viewers’ encounters with the movies are shaped: narrative, nonfiction, and experimental organizations as well as genres. Part 4 offers critical per- spectives on film, including an overview of film history, an account of major questions and positions in film theory, and a guide to writing a film essay.\n\nThe Film Experience encourages readers to choose and explore tactically different pathways into a film. This is not to say that studying film allows a movie to mean anything one wants; indeed, this book insists on a precise understanding of film forms, practices, and terminologies. Rather, having the tools and awareness to measure how and why a film engages us and provokes us in many different ways ultimately makes clear how rich and exciting films and film cultures are and, at the same time, how important and rewarding it is to think carefully, accurately, and rigorously about both.\n\nCritical and scholarly interest in the movies is an outcome of — and an input into — the values and ideas that permeate our social and cultural lives. Not only are cultural\n\nI.16 Citizen Kane (1941). Even canonized films offer multiple entryways and the possibility of various responses for careful viewers.

As fans and students of the movies, most of us experience films from a variety of personal and cultural positions and angles. Like Alvy Singer in Annie Hall, we may be pas- sionate about films and about how and when we watch them. As with François Truffaut’s The 400 Blows, a film may ask us to identify on a personal level with the characters and action and challenge us to see in new ways. Our histories, circumstances, and tastes may draw us to different films for differ- ent reasons: one person may be especially fascinated with the technological maneuvers of Inception or Avatar, while others may be drawn to the music of Dreamgirls or the history lessons of Gladiator. In some cases, we primarily identify with the film and its characters, as when teenagers view The Break- fast Club; in others, our experience may be more of cognitive or intellectual engagement, as when we reflect on a documentary such as Client 9. In most every case, it can be rewarding and exciting to examine how and why we view and respond to movies in certain ways, and this kind of reflection can lead to the pleasure of thinking about, studying, and debating our film expe- riences.

Or a film like Fruitvale Station?\n\n■ Describe two different viewing positions for a big summer movie like Man of Steel — one that is primarily about identification and another that has a more cognitive engagement with the film. Try to be specific.\n\n■ Make the case for studying a war film like Saving Private Ryan. How might that film be “studied,” and how would that activity add to both the understanding and the enjoyment of that film?\n\nActivity Choose a good review or critical essay about a recent film and carefully read it to analyze the various ways that the writer engaged with that particular film. Do his or her judgments reveal specific tastes, backgrounds, or a cultural con- text that informs or even prejudices his or her observations? Are there moments in the review when the writer seems to identify with certain characters and actions on an emotional or psychological level? Are there other evaluations that suggest cognitive considerations about how that movie compares with similar films?\n\nC O N C E P T S A T W O R K\n\nStudying Film: Culture and Experience I N T R O D U C T I O N\n\nvalues and ideas reflected in the films and media that surround us, in other words, but values and ideas are generated by films as well. Both inside and outside the class- room, movies engage us, and we them. Public debates about violence in the movies, the crossover of movie stars into positions of political power, and the technological and economic shifts that have led to widespread participation in moving image pro- duction, as well as the vigorous marketing of new formats and playback devices, are only some of the constant reminders of how movies spread throughout the fabric of our everyday experiences. To think seriously about film and to study it carefully is therefore to take charge of one of the most influential forces in our lives. Expanding our knowledge of the cinema — from its formal grammar to its genres to its historical movements — connects our everyday knowledge to the wider sociocultural patterns and questions that shape our lives.\n\n02_COR_6354_Intro_001-017.indd 17 8/14/14 8:22 PM\n\n03_COR_6354_01_018-059.indd 18 8/14/14 8:26 PM\n\n1 chapter\n\nIn 2012, Joss Whedon directed two very different kinds of films, The Avengers, a big-budget action film about comic-book superheroes, and Much Ado about Nothing, a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare’s romantic comedy. The pro- duction, distribution, and exhibition of the two films illustrate how films, even by the same director, can be shaped by extremely different institutional histories.\n\nWith an estimated production budget of $220 million, The Avengers took advantage of the digital and technological tools available to a young director mak- ing a rapid transition from television to blockbuster movie culture. The film was converted to 3-D and broadly distributed by Walt Disney Pictures to major markets around the world in April 2012. It was nominated for a range of awards and attracted devoted followers of comics fans, sci-fi buffs, and a massive youth audience.\n\nDespite Whedon’s claim that both films demonstrate his fascination with complex characters in complex social environments, Much Ado traveled a very different road from production to exhibition. Besides a shooting location in his own home and a schedule that lasted only twelve days, the film features an entourage of actors who worked with Whedon on his TV productions. The film’s promotion focused on its com- bination of the director of The Avengers with a daring adaptation of Shakespeare. As expected, the film appeared primarily in art-house cinemas. More so than The Avengers, however, it may have a future in college film courses on Shakespeare and film.\n\nAs these two disparate films suggest, film production, distribution, and exhibition shape our encounters with movies, and these aspects of film are in turn shaped by how movies are received by audiences.\n\nEncountering Film From Preproduction to Exhibition\n\n19 Top: THE AVENGERS © Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures/courtesy Everett Collection.

The varied practices that go into moviemaking are not only artistic and commercial, they are cultural and social, and they anticipate the moment of viewing at which meaning and value are generated. Understanding the process that takes a film from an idea to its final form not only deepens an appreciation for film form and the labor and craft of filmmakers but also reveals ways that culture and society influence filmmaking itself.\n\nThis chapter describes the process of production as well as the fate of a fin- ished film as it is distributed, promoted, and exhibited. Such extra-filmic processes, which describe events that precede, surround, or follow the actual images we watch on the big screen, television monitor, or other device, are inseparable from the film experience.\n\nAs viewers, where and when we see a movie shapes our response, enjoyment, and understanding as much as do the form and content of the film itself. The film experience now encompasses ever smaller viewing devices (from computers to iPads and smartphones), changing social environments (from IMAX to home theaters), and multiple cultural activities designed to promote interest in individual films (reading about films, directors, and stars; playing video games; watching special DVD editions; or connecting to social media that support a film franchise). Waiting in line with friends for a midnight premiere and half-watching an edited in-flight movie are significantly different experiences that lead to different forms of appreciation and understanding. Overall, it is helpful to think of production and reception as a cycle rather than a one-way process: what goes into making and circulating a film anticipates the moment of viewing, and viewing tastes and habits influence film production and dissemination.\n\n■ List the stages of filmmaking, from preproduction through production to postproduction, and explain how each stage informs what we see on the screen.\n\n■ Describe how the mechanisms of film distribution determine what films we can see as well as when and how we can see them.\n\n■ Analyze how film promotion may predispose us to see certain films and to see them in certain ways.\n\n■ Evaluate the ways in which film exhibition both structures and is influenced by audience reception.\n\n■ Explain the ways in which media convergence and rapid technological ad- vances are affecting virtually all aspects of the film experience from produc- tion to consumption.\n\n03_COR_6354_01_018-059.indd 20 8/14/14 8:27 PM\n\n21\n\nProduction: How Films Are Made The aim at each step of filmmaking is to create an artistic and/or commercial product that will engage, please, or provoke viewers. In short, film production is a multilayered activity in which industry, art, technology, and imagination inter- twine. It describes the different stages — from the financing and scripting of a film to its final edit and, fittingly, the addition of production credits naming the com- panies and individuals involved — that contribute to the construction of a movie. Production may not seem like a central part of our film experiences as viewers, but the making of a film anticipates an audience of one sort or another and im- plies a certain kind of viewer. Does the film showcase the work of the director or the screenwriter, the cinematographer or the composer of the musical score? How does the answer to this question affect our perspective on the film? Understanding contemporary filmmaking in its many dimensions contributes to our appreciation of and ability to analyze films.\n\nPreproduction Although the term “production” is used to define the entire process of making a film, a great deal happens — and often a long time passes — before a film begins to be shot. Preproduction designates the phase when a project is in development and before the cameras roll. In narrative filmmaking, the efforts of the screenwriter, the producer, and sometimes the director, often in the context of a studio or an independent production company, combine at this stage to conceive and refine an idea for a film in order to realize it onscreen. Funds are raised, rights are secured, a crew is assembled, casting decisions are made, and key aspects of the film’s de- sign, including location scouting and the construction of sets and costumes, are developed during the preproduction phase. Documentary filmmakers might con- duct archival or location research, investigate their subject, and conduct interviews during this period.\n\nScreenwriters A screenwriter, or scriptwriter, is often the individual who generates the idea for a narrative film, either as an original concept or as an adaptation of a story, novel, or historical or current event. The screenwriter presents that early concept or material in a treatment, a short prose description of the action and major characters of the story. The treatment is then gradually expanded to a complete screenplay or script, including scene descriptions, dialog"
