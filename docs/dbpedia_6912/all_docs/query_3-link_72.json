        "text": "U. S. Navy Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton inspects the house he has leased from Goro, a marriage broker. Goro has procured for him three servants and a geisha wife, Cio-Cio-San (known as Madame Butterfly). Sharpless, the American consul, arrives and is served whiskey as Pinkerton describes himself as roaming the world in search of pleasure. He is enchanted with Cio-Cio-San and intends to go through a marriage ceremony with her. Sharpless warns that the girl may not take her vows so lightly. Pinkerton suggests they drink to the day that he will marry a “real” American wife.\n\nCio-Cio-San approaches with her friends, proclaiming that she is answering the call of love. She tells Pinkerton how she had to earn her living as a geisha and declares her intention to embrace his Christian faith. The Imperial Commissioner performs the wedding ceremony, after which the guests toast the couple. When Cio-Cio-San’s uncle, the Bonze – a Buddhist priest – bursts upon the scene, he curses her for renouncing her ancestors’ religion. Pinkerton orders him and the rest of the family to leave.\n\nFinally alone with Cio-Cio-San, Pinkerton dries her tears. Helped by her maid Suzuki into a bridal kimono, Cio-Cio-San joins Pinkerton in the moonlit garden.\n\nThree years after Pinkerton's departure for America, Cio-Cio-San still awaits his return. Suzuki informs Cio-Cio-San that they will have no money left if Pinkerton takes much longer. CioCio-San urges Suzuki to have faith: one day the ship will arrive. Sharpless arrives with a letter from Pinkerton, but before he can read it to Cio-Cio-San, Goro brings in her latest suitor, Prince Yamadori. Cio-Cio-San dismisses both Goro and Yamadori, insisting that her American husband has not abandoned her.\n\nWhen Sharpless reads Cio-Cio-San the letter, he hints that Pinkerton may never return. Bringing in their child, Cio-Cio-San declares that as soon as Pinkerton knows of his son, he will surely come back. If he does not, she could return to life as an impoverished entertainer, but she would prefer death. Promising to tell Pinkerton about his son, Sharpless leaves.\n\nWhen Cio-Cio-San is startled by a cannon report, she observes Pinkerton's ship entering the harbor. Ecstatic, she and Suzuki scatter flower petals everywhere. As night falls, she puts on her wedding kimono and awaits her husband's return.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Suzuki insists that Cio-Cio-San rest. She moves to another room, carrying the child with her. Within moments Pinkerton arrives, accompanied by his new wife, Kate, along with Sharpless. Suzuki greets the men joyfully, but when she realizes who Kate is, she sadly agrees to help break the news to Cio-Cio-San. Pinkerton bids an anguished farewell to the scene of his former happiness.\n\nNo sooner has Pinkerton gone than Cio-Cio-San appears, surprised to see Kate and Sharpless. Guessing the truth, she agrees to give up her child if Pinkerton will return for him in half an hour. Then, sending even Suzuki away, she takes out the dagger with which her own father committed suicide. As she prepares for the seppuku ritual, Suzuki pushes the child into the room. Cio-Cio-San asks her son to look into her face so he can remember her. She dies as Pinkerton is heard calling her name."
