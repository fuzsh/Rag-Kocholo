I gather that your objective is to know the opera before you\n\nattend. My first recommendation is then one of two videos which you may\n\nbe able to borrow: the Ponelle film conducted by von Karajan with Freni\n\nand Domingo; or a recent one (the only Butterfly video released in the\n\nlast year or two, I believe). For audio, the von Karajan with Freni and\n\nPavarotti is probably the best choice in terms of clarity and\n\naccessiblity.\n\nMike\n\nmric...@cpl.net\n\nhttp://mrichter.simplenet.com\n\nCD-R http://resource.simplenet.com\n\nIn article <389F39D9...@cpl.net>, Mike Richter <mric...@cpl.net>\n\nwrote:\n\n>The best for your purposes is not necessarily the best conducted or the\n\n>best sung.

But there are at least three more: the\n\nHayashi Dvorski Maazel from La Scala (beautiful staging, not so beautiful\n\nsinging), the one from Verona with Kabaivanska and Antinori lunder Arena\n\n(horrible visually and challenged vocally) and the relatively new (1997 I\n\nthink) from Australian Opera with C. Barker. Not to mention the film version\n\nby that director that has the same name as the French president...\n\nRegards\n\n---\n\nEnrique\n\neske...@teleline.es\n\nIo chi sono? Eh, non lo so.\n\n-Nol sapete?\n\nQuasi no.\n\nMy first Butterfly recording was a highlight 12\" LP with Albanese, Peerce,\n\nCapecchi, with Bellezza conducting.\n\nIt is a very full LP, containg about an hour of music, and Albanese is intense\n\nand moving, though a bit past her best years vocally. STill, she is\n\nwonderful.\n\nPeerce sings with great ardor in the love duet, and sails up to a great high C\n\nwith Licia at it's conclusion. I have always hoped this would someday make it\n\nto CD.\n\nMy first complete Butterfly was with De los Angeles, Di Stefano, Gobbi, Santini\n\nconducting. It was on RCA at the time, but has since been released on CD by\n\nEMI. All singers are in wonderful form.\n\nMy favorite Butterfly is still the Tebaldi, Bergonzi, with Serafin at the helm.\n\nTebaldi sings with such incredible beauty, and feeling, and abandon, that it\n\nall but sweeps one away. Such a gorgeous flood of vocal tone rushing at you\n\nthrough the speakers. And Bergonzi is one of the best Pinkertons on record.\n\nHis opening scene, with a somewhat dry voice Enzo Sordello, is a lesson in\n\ngreat Puccini singing, with portamenti galore, and simply wonderful vocalizing,\n\nwhile conveying the character of Pinkerton.\n\nThe stereo sound is as good as any and this is the one Butterfly I would keep\n\nif I could only keep one.\n\nEd\n\nFor free catalog of live opera on CD, video, and audio cassettes, please e-mail\n\nyour name and mailing address.\n\n>From: custo...@aol.com (Customoper)\n\n>Date: Wed, Feb 9, 2000 15:07 EST\n\n>Message-id: <20000209150722...@ng-bk1.aol.com>\n\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHi, Ed,\n\nThe conductor of the fabulous DiStefano, De los Angeles, Gobbi recording is\n\nGianandrea Gavazzeni, not the languid Santini who devitalized just about\n\neverything he directed.\n\nIndeed the DiStefano recording is outstanding for the variety of tempi, mostly\n\nfast, that Gavazzeni uses to keep the opera moving. Gobbi is far and away the\n\nmost vital Sharpless I've heard.\n\nI am surprised you have not any kind words for the lovely Steber, Tucker,\n\nValdengo recording superbly paced by Max Rudolf. Valdengo was a very warm\n\nsharpless and Tucker is stunning in his first recorded Pinkerton.\n\nThe Toti Dal Monte recording is another one I would not deprive myself of. It\n\ncontains the finest singing Gigli ever provided in a complete opera recording.\n\nIt is also well directed by Olivero de Fabritiis.\n\nSorry, but Serafin is a bit too syruppy for my taste and Tebaldi a bit too\n\nmatronly -- although I thought she was great in her earlier recording\n\n(conducted by Erede).\n\nAll the best,\n\n==G/P Dave\n\n>From: grndp...@aol.com\n\n>The conductor of the fabulous DiStefano, De los Angeles, Gobbi recording is\n\n>Gianandrea Gavazzeni, not the languid Santini who devitalized just about\n\n>everything he directed.\n\n>I am surprised you have not any kind words for the lovely Steber, Tucker,\n\n>Valdengo recording superbly paced by Max Rudolf\n\nYou're certainly right, Dave. Gavazzeni is the conductor. I believe Santini\n\nconducts the second De los angeles Butterfly, with Bjoerling.\n\nI love both Tucker recordings, and for me, he is the very best Pinkerton on\n\nrecords. His soaring Bb's make the opening scene, and the trio and Addio in\n\nact 3 truly memorable, as does his natural ability to portray an American.\n\nSTeber is wonderful in the 1949 recording, and Price sings wonderfully in the\n\n1964. I don't find her terribly moving, however, and I don't like Maero at\n\nall. I recently asked Merrill why he didn't do this recording, and he said\n\nthey had asked him to, but he didn't feel like learning the role! Too bad.\n\nImagine that voice as Sharpless!!\n\nBest,\n\n\n\nCustomoper wrote:\n\n> >From: grndp...@aol.com\n\n>\n\n> >The conductor of the fabulous DiStefano, De los Angeles, Gobbi recording is\n\n> >Gianandrea Gavazzeni, not the languid Santini who devitalized just about\n\n> >everything he directed.\n\n>\n\n> You're certainly right, Dave. Gavazzeni is the conductor. I believe Santini\n\n> conducts the second De los angeles Butterfly, with Bjoerling.\n\nI just heard the \"fabulous\" de los Angeles/di Stefano/Gobbi/Gavazzeni for the first\n\ntime (on LP, by the way), and found it very flawed. De los Angeles is magnificent,\n\npure-voiced, moving. Di Stefano is a wonderfully characterized and gorgeously sung\n\nPinkerton. However, Gobbi, whom I adore, did very little here. He played the\n\nbureaucrat, not really getting involved in Butterfly's tragedy or denial. I have\n\nnever heard him so uninvolved. Panerai with Scotto or Borriello with Callas are far\n\nmore into the drama. Strange. The real problem is the great conductor Gavazzeni,\n\nwhom I usually admire enormously. But here he whips up the tempi to such an extent\n\nthat the singers occasionally have trouble getting the words out in time. The\n\nemotional centerpiece of the opera \"Del tua madre\" is brisked along at such a clip\n\nthat, far from getting a chance to emote, you barely notice that it's there. If the\n\npitch hadn't been correct, I'd have thought the record was playing at the wrong\n\nspeed. I don't know what Gavazzeni's aim was, but I didn't have a good time.\n\nHowever dull Santini/de los Angeles/Bjoerling is, I hope that at least the singers\n\ndon't give the impression that they'd need respirators after the taping sessions.\n\nBob Seletsky"
