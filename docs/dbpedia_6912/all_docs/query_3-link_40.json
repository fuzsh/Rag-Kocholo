        "text": "This post comes from Discovery Fellow Allyson Maldonado\n\nWhen I began researching for my topic of the evolution of musical theater I found that I was becoming increasingly interested in Asian representations from the 20th century. However, the more I looked for Asian characters and stories, the more I found similar themes sticking out to me, if I was able to find any representation at all.\n\nThe theme I found coming up frequently in my research is something I’ve called “The Madame Butterfly Trap:” the trope of an Asian woman love interest who we follow and see as she is never allowed to find happiness with another. This comes from the original European story, written in two versions by American and French authors and then made into an opera by an Italian, of Madame Butterfly (1898) where a Japanese woman marries an American man and suffers devastating consequences.\n\nIn post-WWII theater, musicals like South Pacific and Miss Saigon, the Asian woman’s love interest is almost always a military American officer. The Americans are seen as someone who can “save” the innocent, vulnerable, fragile woman.\n\nYou’ve got to be taught to be afraid of people whose eyes are oddly made” a lyric from the song “You’ve Got to Be Carefully Taught” featured in the musical South Pacific.\n\nThis line exemplifies the ideas that can be observed in musicals centered around Asian stories of all decades. Madame Butterfly, Miss Saigon, and South Pacific all are tragedies centered around innocent Asian love interests and the hesitance and prejudice of their Caucasian counterparts.\n\nWhy is it that Asian representation in musicals and plays is so heavily associated with tragedy? There are few musicals out there that have a lighthearted feel including Asian stories like Flower Drum Song that tells of a wedding in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Was that change alone enough to make Flower Drum Song, a romantic comedy, seen as a triumph in the Asian community when it came to stage?\n\nIn contemporary media, we see Asian women portrayed on all extremes: either as naive and fragile or as self-assured, confident, edgy, (and in most cases sword-wielding) fighters. In musicals alone, we see that much work is to be done to allow for steps to be taken in the right direction, to have that Asian representation in the arts like we deserve.\n\nThe constant fight to create Asian representation that fits between these two extremes and be authentic has been a hot topic in the community for years, and an evolving concept in theater and film. As I continue to keep looking forward in the collections, I hope to find out more about the formulas of musicals and start to find themes that continuously make blockbuster musicals and how Asian representation fits into that puzzle, if at all."
