        "text": "January 27, 2016\n\nThe book is subtitled Race, Sex and Discursive Strategies in Hollywood Fiction.\n\nThe book starts out saying that Hollywood's depiction of Asia has revolved mainly around the 'Yellow Peril' concept, that the West will be overpowered by the sly and seductive actions of the East. The main focus of this is on the sexual relationship between white men and Asian women.\n\nThe book examines a number of specific films, going back to 1915 and the silent film The Cheat, and relating these films to specific themes, such as the rape fantasy. The threat of captivity is discussed next, pointing out that Black and Native American women were not considered captives, but were being liberated from their inferior cultures.\n\nThere's a lot of movies discussed, and a variety of themes. I think it could have done more to tie in the films to anti-Oriental prejudice on the West Coast, though. Also, a number of the films are quite old and I'm not think at least some of them might be difficult to find.\n\nJuly 29, 2020\n\nAn academic analysis of Asian-Americans in Hollywood films between 1915 and 1985, particularly those involving romance. Marchetti provides real insight into specific films or recurring themes between films, but unfortunately this is offset somewhat by a writing style that is pretty dense, and by analyses that don’t always seem balanced. With that said, the book is worth reading for a cinephile, film studies student, or anyone interested in an analysis of how the dominant culture perceived Asian-Americans (and women in general) over the 20th century, because of the depth of the analysis and how thought-provoking it is.\n\nAt its heart, the book identifies a fundamental dilemma with America that exists to this day – the clash between the desire for a “melting pot” with “liberty and justice for all,” and a belief that the country should remain dominated by white, Anglo-Saxon protestant males. The way Marchetti shows this manifesting itself either in outright racism in films or in those that are superficially tolerant but which have conservative underpinnings is very well done, particularly for the latter category. An example of this is her critical examination of James Shigeta’s character in the film The Crimson Kimono (1959), a film that is extraordinary for its tolerance and interracial romance, but as she reveals flawed in how it believes racism is either very rare or non-existent in America.\n\nMarchetti also understands the historical context of the films, pointing out (for example) the pervasiveness of racism in the country after Reconstruction, and how the fear of the potential power of minority and immigrant voters helped get women’s suffrage finally passed. I also really liked her insight into the depiction of Asian women as being more passive and subservient as not only being stereotypical, but a response to rising feminism in America, essentially telling American women to remember what it is to be “feminine” in films like Sayonara (1957) and The World of Suzie Wong (1960).\n\nI think where she falters a bit is in how negative she is about some films, or when she reads too much Freudian desires (e.g. castration anxiety) or homoeroticism into them. I have to say, some of the films selected, including a made for TV movie in the 1980’s were less interesting to me, though I understand the intention was to show the connective thread up the present (the book was published in 1993). I would have much rather had it cover a broader swath of older films and actors. It is a great reference for the films it does go into, including:\n\nThe Cheat (1915)\n\nMadame Butterfly (1915)\n\nBroken Blossoms (1919)\n\nShanghai Express (1932)\n\nThe Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933)\n\nLady of the Tropics (1939)\n\nJapanese War Bride (1952)\n\nLove is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955)\n\nChina Gate (1957)\n\nSayonara (1957)\n\nThe Crimson Kimono (1959)\n\nThe World of Suzie Wong (1960)\n\nBridge to the Sun (1961)\n\nMy Geisha (1962)\n\nThe Lady from Yesterday (1985)\n\nYear of the Dragon (1985)\n\nAn American Geisha (1986)"
