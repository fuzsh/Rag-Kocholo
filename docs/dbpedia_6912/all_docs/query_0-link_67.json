        "text": "In the years preceding her breakthrough role in The Thin Man (1934), which would propel her to the top of the Hollywood popularity list, Myrna Adele Williams, better known as Myrna Loy, often found herself cast as exotic femme fatales. Film producers saw in her delicate features, distinctive nose and almond eyes something of the East, even though she was of Welsh, Scots and Swedish heritage. One of her most memorable supporting roles was as Fah Lo See, the sensuous and sadistic daughter of Boris Karloff’s megalomaniac warlord in The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932). Loy was not the only Hollywood actress of white European descent to appear on screen as a Chinese character, a transformation that usually required them to don an elaborate make-up disparagingly known as ‘yellow face’. In fact, in the era of ‘yellow peril’ literature, exemplified by the work of Sax Rohmer, Thomas Burke[1], and other pulp fiction writers, a succession of non-Asian actresses would be required to become ‘daughters of the dragon’.\n\nThe portrayal of Chinese themes in early American cinema reflected contemporary attitudes towards Chinese people in the United States and political events in China. Since the introduction of the Exclusion Act in 1882, Chinese immigrants of the labouring class found themselves increasingly ostracised by the US government and the ‘white’ populace. With further immigration curtailed, overseas travel effectively prohibited, and with no political representation or right to citizenship, the Chinese in America took refuge in ungoverned, vice-ridden ghettos of the major cities. In such ‘Chinatowns’, the predominantly male population, hopelessly disconnected from their womenfolk in the motherland, resorted to opium use and prostitution, trades regulated by the notorious ‘tongs’. Meanwhile, in China itself, the Qing Dynasty had come to an end in 1911 after a long period of instability, including the xenophobic hysteria of the Boxer Rebellion. In both contexts, the overarching perception of the nation relayed through the American press was one of privation, corruption, and peril.\n\nThese stereotypes of the East were further entrenched by writers of the late 19th and early 20th century. Though Rudyard Kipling never set foot in mainland China during his Asian travels in the late 1880s, his most famous observation ‘0h, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet’ was taken as a dictum by Sino-phobic successors. 1898 saw the publication of M. P. Shiel’s Yellow Danger, a fictional response to the Kiaochow Incident and the subsequent European ‘Scramble for Concessions’ from China’s failing empire, in which the writer envisaged a global war against a ‘locust swarm of the yellow races’. Jack London added further substance to the idea of a threat from the East through his 1910 story The Unparalleled Invasion, in which Western powers used biological warfare to wipe out a burgeoning Chinese populace. Sax Rohmer, a Birmingham-born Irish Catholic whose real name was Arthur Henry Ward, introduced the Asiatic master-criminal Fu Manchu in 1913, and many other lurid tales of oriental treachery appeared around the same period.\n\nFrom the social and political realities of the Chinese immigrant, and the orientalist imaginings of American theatre and literature, emerged a number of motifs that would inform the American motion picture industry throughout the silent and pre-war sound eras. These recurring themes included miscegenation, tong violence, despotism, drug addiction, sex-slavery, vengeance, honour-killing, honour-suicide, and femicide. Collectively, these movie motifs typified the ‘yellow peril’ zeitgeist by depicting the Chinese as a threat to social order, racial purity and democracy.\n\nChinese themes and the negative stereotyping of the Chinese had been introduced by early film-makers such as Georges Melies.[2] British production Lieutenant Rose and the Chinese Pirates (1911) had shown the Royal Navy bombarding a temple in retaliation for the kidnapping of an officer and his lady friends by a Manchu pirate called Ling Hoo, and several other films in this series featured Chinese antagonists. Broken Fetters (1916) and The Flower of Doom (1917), both directed by Rex Ingram, continued the trend for oriental melodrama.\n\nInter-racial romance was a central theme of almost all motion pictures of the Chinese genre produced between 1918 and the end of the silent era. The setting for this was either the American Chinatown, or China itself. In some cases, the Chinese female was mixed race or secretly ‘white’; a fact only revealed in the final reels. ‘Whiteness’ was rewarded with a happy outcome, whereas any measure of Chinese blood often resulted in death or heartbreak. Often the Chinese female lost out to a white rival. The majority of these films included at least one nefarious male Chinese character. These ranged from despotic rulers and tong leaders to corrupt and predatory mandarins. Several films directly referenced Kipling. Others were clearly influenced by the story of Madame Butterfly, an 1898 publication by John Luther Long, which had proved popular as a play and an operetta.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of the early Chinese-themed motion pictures was Broken Blossoms. Adapted from the short story The Child and the Chink, which had been published in Thomas Burke’s Limehouse Nights, it told the story of a Chinese immigrant’s love for the abused daughter of a local boxer. The film was directed by pioneer D. W. Griffith and starred his favoured actress Lilian Gish. Cinema’s first feature-length melodrama and Griffith’s first production for the newly formed United Artists was a critical and commercial success upon its release in May 1919. Although featuring an unusually sympathetic portrayal of the main Chinese character, Griffith worked a number of orientalist motifs into his picture; miscegenation anxiety, opium-addiction, oriental lechery (in the character of ‘Evil Eye’), honour-killing, and suicide.\n\nReleased the previous year, Forbidden City had been the first film to feature a major female ‘star’ in a Chinese role. Norma Talmadge had been raised in poverty in Brooklyn, but by 1918, with the help of her enterprising husband Joseph Schenck, was working for her own company, Norma Talmadge Productions. Forbidden City was based on a story by John Scarborough, and directed by Sidney Franklin, who had a reputation for adapting literary works for the screen.\n\nForbidden City begins with Kipling’s famous yet oft misinterpreted dictum: ‘For east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet.’[3] Having been abandoned by her young American lover, Norma’s character is forced to reveal the existence of their love-child to the Chinese emperor. He, in a fit of sexual jealousy, orders the woman’s murder as she leaves the Forbidden City, deviously reneging on a promise to spare her life. The ‘half-American’ infant is spared to grow up as ‘a warning that between East and West there can be no twain’, and the film ends with the grown-up child, also played by Norma, being reunited with her father."
