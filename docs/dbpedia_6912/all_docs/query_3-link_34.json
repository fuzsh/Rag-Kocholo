A 20-minute long, handheld camera take follows the protagonist as she meanders inside the Kuala Lumpur bus station where her boyfriend left her stranded and penniless. She desperately searches for a direction, her panic and disorientation slowly building up.\n\nA second, briefer shot lingers on her face as she…\n\nAsian strip malls are a bombardment, and a lurid, fecund one at that. The Equatorial humidity ensures that buildings never stay pristine for long. New constructions crumble and fade, becoming dull and moisture-logged - dirt sticks to walls, becomes one with floor tiles regardless of the frequency with which they're mopped.

Take air-conditioning out of the equation and it all hangs and lingers with a livid dankness that much heavier, more pregnant.\n\nPerhaps…\n\nIt takes less than thirty seconds to realise how divorced Madame Butterfly is from Tsai Ming-liang's usual aesthetic. Stillness is the move with Tsai, yet here he has a camera constantly adrift, following a woman who too is without direction after having been neglected by her lover. The stop/start rhythm of flows in sync with the woman's situation, as she seeks avenues of support only to be cast down once more.\n\nDue to the nature of the production (shot in an actively operating terminal), a lot of the citizens wandering about look directly into the camera, observing a filmmaking process that normally remains purely contemplative in Tsai's more recent works (particularly Walker and Journey to the West).
