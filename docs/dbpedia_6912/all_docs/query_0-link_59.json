        "text": "The aim of the following study is to analyze the manner in which opera music influenced film and became a crucial building block of certain cinematic narratives, in such films as Jonathan Demme’s Philadephia (USA, 1993), Luc Besson’s The Fifth Element (France, 1997) and Liliana Cavani’s Il portiere di notte/The Night Porter (Italy, 1974). By revealing the correspondence between these audiovisual mediums and examining the common language used by them we intent to reveal numerous facets of this symbiotic relationship, all put in the service of lending meaning to the film, thus making the viewer’s escapist adventure truly unique.\n\nFilm&#39;s attraction to opera began not with the technical possibility of synchronising the operatic voice with the image, but earlier, in the silent era. In theNew York Timesof 27 August 1910 Thomas Edison declared: ‘We&#39;ll be ready for the moving picture shows in a couple of months, but I&#39;m not satisfied with that.I want to give grand opera.’ What did silent film seek in opera? Would a silent film of or about opera have any meaning? What are the possibilities for silent opera? How would a mute operatic voice appear in film?\n\nIn 1915 the American poet Vachel Lindsay claimed that European stage acting was unsuited to film. This critique held sway for decades, during which commentators celebrated American, as opposed to European, contributions to the new craft of motion picture acting. European acting became associated with mannered staginess in contrast to a more subtle American style. Building on recent scholarship that questions this dichotomy, Duckett skillfully analyzes the screen performances of two women actors: the French Sarah Bernhardt, arguably the most famous late nineteenth-century actor, who electrified theater audiences but made relatively few film appearances, and the American Lillian Gish, who began her career as a child in stage melodramas but whose fame derived from her appearances in films. Duckett’s nuanced reading of Bernhardt’s performance in the film Camille (Film D’Art, 1911) and Lillian Gish’s in Broken Blossoms (D. W. Griffith, 1919) reveals that despite their differences, they both used their bodies expressively to convey meanings and emotions.\n\nLouis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway’s opera 'Rosa: The Death of a Composer' (premiered 1994 at Het Muziektheater in Amsterdam) and Philip Glass’s mixed media chamber opera 'The Photographer' (first performed in 1982 at Amsterdam’s Royal Palace) are both conceived as pieces of ‘musical investigation’: the test arrangement 'Rosa' examines the alleged assassination of a Uruguayan composer for Hollywood Western music in 1957; 'The Photographer' reenacts the homicide of a drama critic, shot by Eadweard Muybridge in 1874. However, forms of operatic (re-)presentation are hardly acknowledged as strategies of documentation – and much less criminal detection – but reputed to indulge in “concepts and illusions too preposterous to be tolerated in any other form” (P. Greenaway). To compensate for, and reflect on their seeming artificiality and lack of ‘realism’, both operas assimilate diverse representational systems which are closely associated either with scientific discourse or the technical reproduction of physical reality; on a content-related, formal, and medial level, Rosa and The Photographer employ the ‘cinematic’ (or ‘pre-cinematic’) as a means of deduction. Moreover, in both instances the tension or commutation between musical drama and discursive reconstruction seems to be emblematically subsumed in the figure of a horse, Juan Manuel de Rosa’s black mare in a treadmill-cradle on the one hand, the famous chronophotographical series “Horse in Motion” by Muybridge on the other. In this context, the paper focuses on the operas as self-reflexive investigations not so much of two cases of death, but of the representational potential of different media or dispositifs. It aims at the possible ‘reality effect’ of opera as well as the ‘theatricality’ of cinema’s moving images in order to determine the interplay of image/imaginary and real/reality.\n\nScholars have long sought to trace the ancestry of film music in the music-theatrical genres that preceded the cinematic medium. Two lineages of influence predominate. On the one hand, opera served as an aesthetic ideal to which filmmakers and critics aspired, in cinema’s early decades. On the other, pantomime and melodrama provided practical models of musical accompaniment that guaranteed quintessentially filmic forms of audio-visual synchronization. Yet at the level of individual scores, the distinctions between these two genealogies become blurred; and the notion of film evolving from preceding genres remains unquestioned. This article re-examines this historiographical tendency, making a case study of Carlo Graziani-Walter’s specially-composed score for _Gli ultimi giorni di Pompei_ (1913), a major historical epic from the “Golden Years” of Italian cinema. Graziani-Walter’s score, I argue, is clearly influenced by Italian opera—especially in three key scenes, which were to be accompanied by live singing. Operatic aesthetics are notably absent, however, in the two published extracts from the score, both of which draw on popular idioms. The juxtaposition and tension between opposing styles—between the operatic and the popular—in the score to _Gli ultimi giorni_ suggests that a new, distinctly filmic form of music was already emerging.\n\nEarly film theorist Ricciotto Canudo equated cinema with music because of the Seventh Art’s inherent plasticity; in the 21st century, plasticity extends to the soundtrack. In this article, I explore the fusion of cinema with the musical genre of opera. By considering that film is a performative medium, beyond the actors’ agency, I confirm music’s importance in it as part of the structure and style of opera. Unlike Franco Zeffirelli’s adaptation of Verdi’s opera Otello, Orson Welles’s adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play conforms to Jacques Aumont’s concept of “operatic film” in that it engenders a coexistence of the verbal and the non-verbal, balancing drama and music with a performative intention. However, this film is so musicalized and operatically rendered, especially through its soundtrack, that it exceeds Aumont’s intention and becomes what I call a “cinematic opera”: a film that is operatic in its artificial and ritualistic nature as well as in its well-woven soundtrack of music, sound effects and voice working together in a common musicalized pattern."
