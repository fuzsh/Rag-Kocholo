        "text": "By STEPHEN HOLDEN\n\nf you stripped \"Madame Butterfly\" of its ravishingly beautiful Puccini score, you would be left with the nasty late-19th-century story of a selfish American naval lieutenant who marries a Japanese child bride knowing full well he will never see her again once he leaves Japan. His credulous young wife is so blindingly smitten that she gives up her religious faith for him and is disowned by her family. Even after three years of not hearing from Lieutenant Pinkerton, Cio-Cio-San deludes herself into believing he will return and rashly rebuffs a solid marriage proposal to cling to this fantasy.\n\nWhen Pinkerton finally does show up, it is only to snatch away the child she bore him. All the breast-beating guilt pangs in the world don't make him anything less than a complete heel.\n\nNor does Cio-Cio-San's self-sacrifice and suicide make her anything more than a tragically silly fool.\n\nFrèderic Mitterrand's film version of \"Madame Butterfly,\" which opens today at the Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, begins to get at the story's harsh realities, especially in the swaggering performance of Richard Troxell, whose Pinkerton is an arrogant, racist boor. But this first feature film by the director, a nephew of the former French President François Mitterrand, is stylistically too indecisive to make the most of its cinematic opportunities. And Ying Huang, the 23-year-old Chinese soprano who plays Cio-Cio-San, is too bland a screen presence to infuse the movie's many close-ups with sizzling passion.\n\n\"Madame Butterfly\" is being officially \"presented\" by Martin Scorsese, a director whose films flaunt an \"operatically\" high-pitched emotional palette. But Mr. Mitterrand is a comparatively timid film maker whose \"verismo\" approach to \"Madame Butterfly\" goes only so far. In casting young unknown singers in the opera, which is sung in Italian with English subtitles, the French director aspires to the romantic realism of a movie like Franco Zeffirelli's \"Romeo and Juliet,\" in which very young pretty actors played Shakespeare's star-crossed lovers.\n\nIn \"Madame Butterfly,\" Mr. Troxell and Ms. Huang make an attractive couple, but they exhibit no special chemistry. And although Ms. Huang is youthful, she appears much too mature and sophisticated to pass for 15, the age at which Cio-Cio-San marries Pinkerton. In a movie that includes many close-ups, one waits in vain for Ms.\n\nHuang's face to register the transforming passions that make Cio-Cio-San's obsession compelling and ultimately lethal. It isn't until her character's final moments that Ms. Huang begins to let go.\n\nAlthough the director has opened up \"Madame Butterfly\" by shooting on location (in Tunisia) and inserting a flashback of Cio-Cio-San's days as a geisha dancer, the film still has the static momentum of a staged opera. The director tries to compensate by keeping the camera moving in long fluid takes, but this gesture comes off as a nervous cinematic affectation. The film's boldest visual concept, brought in to fill space over a humming chorus, is a black-and-white documentary film clip of Japanese demonstrations against Western involvement in its affairs. The inclusion of this jerky speeded-up silent film is not only mystifying, but also stylistically jarring.\n\nThe score, conducted by James Conlon, who leads the Orchestre de Paris, is not badly sung. Mr. Troxell's blustering Pinkerton is the most dramatically satisfying vocal characterization. Ms.\n\nHuang has a strong, supple lyric soprano, but her vocal performance, while competent, is neither meltingly tender nor commandingly dramatic.\n\nThis being Puccini at his most lusciously romantic, the music still works its bittersweet magic. If the film succeeds in introducing \"Madame Butterfly\" to a fresh audience, it will have accomplished much of what it set out to do.\n\nMADAME BUTTERFLY\n\nDirected by Frèderic Mitterrand; in Italian, with English subtitles; based on the opera by Puccini with libretto by Illica and Giacosa; director of photography, Philippe Welt; music conducted by James Conlon; produced by Daniel Toscan Du Plantier and Pierre-Olivier Bardet; released by Sony Classical.
