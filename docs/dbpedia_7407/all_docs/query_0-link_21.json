        "text": "Publications that strictly deal in the printed world are often prone to outside elements wreaking havoc with their ability to consistently produce and circulate timely news for their subscribers. Weather, press issues and even natural disaster can affect printed materials.\n\nWith Pressmart, digital editions are far less susceptible to outside influence. And with modern technology, the odds of someone not being able to access an ePaper or eMagazine through online, mobile, eReader, podcast or RSS are next to nil.\n\nRecently, a US-based newspaper contacted Pressmart with a problem. A fire had roared through their distribution center, which gutted the building making paper circulation impossible. With Pressmart's help, the newspaper was able to have the current ePaper available for subscribers within 3 hours of the initial phone call.\n\nIn today's corporate environment, companies are changing the way they do business. Taking old habits and a way-things-have-always-been-done mentality and turning it on its head has created new clients for Pressmart. Dr. Reddy's is a good example of how thinking digital can reduce the costs and waste associated with traditional printing.\n\nA leading global pharmaceutical supply company, Dr. Reddy's re-examined their business model, looking for ways to reduce printing costs and leave less of a carbon footprint. They found answers at Pressmart.\n\n\"At Dr. Reddy's we firmly believe in the principle of sustainability, and giving back to society. As part of this thinking we decided to reduce printing of our largely circulated documents through the use of Pressmart's digital solutions. The less we go for print, the more trees we save and contributing toward keeping the planet green.\"\n\nBy converting their annual report into digital edition flash and PDF formats, the company was able to cut costs and eliminate paper waste. The move helped to further strengthen their commitment to a green economy while drawing praise from their chief shareholders."
