From broadbased nationals to narrowly designed niche periodicals, the Internet is home to hundreds of these weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual publications.

Women On Writing\n\nOnline Newspapers\n\nThe newspaper has been replaced by the television set as the chief source of information for most Americans about what is happening in the world -- and why. With the coming of the electronic media, newspapers have seen their circulations drop dramatically, and the numbers of newspapers diminish substantially. As an acknowledgment of the technological advances for the dissemination of information, more and more of the fewer and fewer newspapers left have taken up space on the Internet in a struggle to keep themselves viable. This has worked to the distinct advantage of those of us who read newspapers as well as ply the lanes of the information superhighway that is the World Wide Web. Here are some of the best newspaper-related Web sites I've found in my cyberspace travels."
