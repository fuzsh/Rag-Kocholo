        "text": "Just a quick note of “Job Excellently Done” by our team on the 360 Degree Module in TMT.. https://tmt.qats.com/CompanySearch.aspx This module was sorely needed by ATS sales and marketing teams for the planning for next year as we need to drill down into our DBs with respect to account activities. I requested the SD team to jump on this and provide this module to me ASAP. They simply did a great job. The data is well presented, we can drill down, export to excel and above all it is lightening fast --- just impressive. Pls thank them on our behalf and in recognition of their focused efforts, we are sending a $250.00 (each) thank you gift with the next monthly payment to Bodhtree.\n\nKaveh Azar, Advanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you very much for your work in the last couple of weeks updating the Sun Pharma Australia website.
