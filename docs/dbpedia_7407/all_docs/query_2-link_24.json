        "text": "Hyderabad based Pressmart, a premier eEdition and New Media Delivery service and Summit, a leading Editorial, Advertising and Digital Asset Management solution provider has entered into a strategic alliance to offer a seamless experience to their publishing customers. Pressmart eEdition solution is used by leading newspapers and magazines from over 28 countries with subscribers in over 140 countries. Summit is a leading vernacular font designing and editorial workflow company in the country, popular for their Indica font family and NewsPro Editorial solution.\n\nUnder the terms of the strategic agreement, Pressmart will integrate eEdition solution and associated new media delivery services with Summit’s Editorial Workflow solution. Additionally, Pressmart will offer its eEdition and Mobile Newspaper solution to large-sized and local community English and Vernacular publications. This integrated offering will benefit the publishing industry immensely as Pressmart takes the path of print publishing forward from where Summit leaves it. While publishers depend on Summit’s Editorial Workflow Solution to get their daily print edition out, they rely on Pressmart’s New Media Delivery Platform to deliver their print content on digital media channels.\n\nMaking the announcement, Sanjeev Gupta, Founder and CEO of Pressmart said “This integration will give the existing customers of Pressmart and Summit a unified publishing experience on both print and digital media. Since, Pressmart’s New Media Delivery Platform addresses all distribution channels including Web, Mobile, Podcast, RSS, Social Networks, etc. publishers will get a complete exposure to their content and a greater convenience as they will directly export their eEdition content from Summit’s NewsPro system.”\n\nWith integration of Summit’s NewsPro and Pressmart’s New Media Delivery Platform publishers can get a seamless experience through out their print and digital product and delivery processes. Another advantage for Publications both large as well as small is the choice to use Pressmart’s pay-as-you-go service model that makes it easy to go live with their eEdition immediately as there is no IT investment or efforts – everything is managed by Pressmart. The integration will be done using the advanced XML based Web Services architecture, giving future-proof integration edge to publishers.\n\n“With new media playing increasingly important role for users of our NewsPro system, this new initiative will greatly boost the capability of our customers to be able to host a high quality ePaper edition on the web quicker and free of errors. In addition to saving time and reducing costs it will help them benefit from the superior ePaper technology from PressMart,” Rakesh Kapoor, Managing Director, Summit Information Technologies, said. “Summit is committed to offer end to end publishing solution to its customers in Print and Internet media and will continue to provide benefits of its cutting edge technologies to keep them ahead of their competition.”\n\nPressmart covers the entire spectrum of new media channels including Web, Mobile, Podcast, RSS, Social Media and Search Engines. Its 360 degree full-service platform keeps the publisher efforts only to supplying PDF while taking on the rest of the activity including conversion, hosting, maintenance, subscription management, advertising sales and readership analytics.\n\nNewsPro is an advanced state-of-the-art multi-edition, multi-lingual Newsroom solution. NewsPro automates all editorials operations and processes that go into producing a newspaper. It streamlines the workflow and keeps track of all activities involved in producing the final page of your publication.
