        "text": "In the science, due to the absence of strict and exact criteria for differentiating between creative and non-creative activities of a human, there is no rather full definition of ‘creativity’ notion despite that this matter was addressed by many scholars. Multifactor field in the science on creativity allows interpreting the essence of ‘creative personality’ notion as the set of independent separate characteristics identifying original individuality of a personality and the highest degree of its creative achievement. Meantime, creative approaches to the solution of professional tasks show the creative essence of a higher school teacher and are manifested in creative activity. On the basis of the analysis of literature on the research topic, the notion of ‘development of creativity in the structure of professionalism of a higher school teacher’ was formed: the activity seeking to establish purposed desire for creativity in a higher school teacher’s personality in the course of exercising his/her professional duties and development of his/her personal qualities required in that connection. In the course of the research it was acknowledged that development of creativity in a higher school teacher includes: a personality’s need in creative activity; creative skills; characterological personal features; individual specifics of psychical processes. The author, based on own experience, rationalizes the suggestion that the principal factor of successful training of adults (post-graduate studies, skills upgrading, professional retraining) is creative organization of not only the academic process but also of creative cooperation at all the stages of communicative chain ‘higher school teacher – adult trainee’.\n\nAnufriev, E.A.

The market is not an end in itself, but the environment in which educators must learn to fulfill their personal, intellectual and creative potentials. Many Russian experts do not have such experience and the ability to quickly respond to market challenges. The purpose of the article is to analyze the experience of the Mordovian State Pedagogical Institute in the educational services market of the Volga, Russia and at the international level aimed at the formation of professional mobility and market-oriented mind in educators and students and the experience of the management of their pathways. In 2009, the Institute developed the Management and Development Policy. The structure of the proposed Management and Development Policy includes: strategic and tactical steps aimed at the formation of professional mobility in educators of the Institute by enhancing professionalism and including them as elements in the market environment of the region and Russia. The Institute offers a new model of work organization as a result of purposeful management of teachers' performance through the introduction of a flexible incentive scale following the results of scientific-pedagogical activities. In this model, mobility becomes systemically important, and the market is a factor for its formation and conditions for its implementation. The higher education institution serves as a link between an educator and the market. The task of the higher education institution is to create conditions under which educators implement their intellectual and creative potential, forming and leading a pathway of professional mobility. The tasks of educators include cooperation with each other, with students, external partners on network cooperation, the administration of the higher education institution. The ability to hold and control a dialogue serves as the main instrument. As a result of cooperation, small mobile groups working in a particular period of time are formed in order to solve a specific task on the basis of the division of labor between the parties on a functional basis. The simulation method allows to consider the problem as a results-oriented and organized process for the formation of professional mobility. The systemic approach involves consideration of the object under study as the integrity, conditionally abstracting from external factors. The article does not provide solutions to all problems, but determines the dependence of the professional mobility of a specialist on processes of the educational services market.\n\nAbankina, I., Abankina, T., Filatova, L., Nikolayenko, E. and Seroshtan, E.

It describes the experience of teaching this discipline in a pedagogical higher education institution. The article presents a brief review of the most compelling existing color vision hypotheses, according to the authors mind: G. Allen, P. Lucas and N. Domini, which are mainly associated with the appearance of color perception with dietary habits of human ancestors, and a fundamentally different assumptions of M. Changizi, whereby the color perception was necessary for a human for a good communication with their own kind for the evaluation of skin tones. In this article is observed the system of the educational experiment research of the functioning of the color perception system of the human eye, as a natural addition to the proposed hypotheses. An experimental study model of a fragment of the retina is proposed, and a laboratory work on the study of a system of a colour human perception, the study of a photobiological paradox of vision by the example of a study model of the opaque lens (cataract). The subject results of its use in a pedagogical university are debated. All this allows us to focus on a caring attitude for human biotic sensory systems in aggressive abiotic influences. It is especially important in teachers training, aimed at training and raising a healthy younger generation. The authors also consider it necessary to acquaint future teachers with the authors of the various theories of color vision and the curricula vitae of the authors of the various discoveries, because this allows enhancing an interest in the study course.\n\nAbuhmaid, Changizi, M., 2009.

International students face certain problems, complicating adaptation to a new lifestyle, to the educational environment of the Russian high school, to a completely new social and cultural environment. Every year more and more foreign students come to Russia to get higher education, and every foreign student goes through an objective process of adaptation to college life. This article aims to develop recommendations, basic principles for an educational institution that provides educational services to foreign citizens. The leading method to the study of this problem is a qualitative method of case-study, which allows to focus on practical knowledge about real everyday situations, faced by foreign students in Russia. The case-study method provides an opportunity to pay close attention to the impact of social, cultural and academic factors on their adaptation. The article revealed that international students often face a series of transitional difficulties immediately after arriving to study in Russian universities. The problems are cataloged according to academic, social and cultural aspects. The article states that in order to overcome these problems, the students use resources provided mainly by the university. On the other hand, it is found out that these problems motivate foreign students to develop strategies to meet emerging challenges. The data obtained can be used in the practice of the university administration, faculty and staff to timely detect and eliminate academic, social and cultural challenges faced by international students at the beginning of their studies in Russia. Attention to these issues will provide more adequate support for foreign students.\n\nAbril, C. (2006). Learning outcomes of two approaches to multicultural music education.

This problem is relevant on all levels of learning- from nursery schools up to higher education, including refresher courses and retraining of teachers. The purpose of this article is working out visual aids for a teacher, based on logical-semantical modeling and functioning as navigators in learners’ actions, when fulfilling educational tasks. The leading method of this problem is the method of visual notion of logical- semantic models of educational actions, which enable us to view the initial problem as a purposeful and well-organized process of learning. According to the scheme of the learning process students fulfill few-stepped and multi-stepped actions and, as a result, the time of the teacher’s oral explanation is shortened. The article gives logical foundation to the implementation of logical-semantic visual navigators for presenting universal educational actions. These actions are realized in coordinate matrix structures which help to fulfill few-stepped educational actions; at the same time the contents of navigators clearly reflect multi-stepped, I. e. scenario-based training actions. The functions of visual forms of navigators are clearly shown in the article. This enables students to be guided by them in the educational process, and the teacher can control the process of solving educational tasks according to the given training actions. It has been proved that the professional competence of teachers are improved thanks to the projecting of logical-semantic navigators which enable them to solve systematic tasks in forming universal training actions, performed by students.\n\nThe rationale of the problem under study is conditioned by the fact that the compulsory study of a second foreign language at school is a new, but by all means positive phenomenon, as the introduction of a second foreign language in the secondary school curriculum has become a practical step on the way to polycultural education, to the formation of a polylingual personality. The introduction of the compulsory study of two foreign languages has aggravated such problems as the absence of the unifying concept of teaching a second foreign language, the absence of requirements for a second foreign language proficiency level in the State Educational Standard, the absence of various and effective teaching resources. This article is aimed at the analysis of the background and prospects of schoolchildren’s polylingual education in the context of new Federal State Educational Standards (FSES). The leading approaches in the research of the problem under study are competence-based and contrastive ones as they let us fully consider the phenomenon of polylingualism which gives an opportunity to use several language systems in communication. The article reveals the background of polylingualism, defines the purposes, content and main principles of teaching several foreign languages, justifies the application of competence-based and contrastive approaches in teaching a second foreign language in the modern school, develops the model of the foreign language communicative competence formation for a second foreign language in the context of studying two foreign languages (English and German). The materials of the article can be useful for foreign language teachers in order to upgrade their skills and make the teaching-learning process a learner-centered one\n\nAverin, Ð. Ð. (2011).

In-depth study of some subjects at schools, lyceums and gymnasiums which starts in the elementary school quite often leads to tension and failures of adaptation process in innovative institutions that makes it necessary to work out the criteria of this process. This article deals with studying such criteria as dynamics of intellectual working capacity, physical health and physical fitness of the 1-3rd graders influenced by teaching in classes with in-depth study of a foreign language. The methods of the research of this problem are: the method of proof tests, the health index assessment method, testing of physical qualities that make it possible to define the level of intellectual working capacity, physical health and physical fitness of the 1-3rd graders in their dynamics and interrelation with the intensity of the academic load. The criteria of adaptation of primary school pupils to the academic load of the increased intensity have been worked out in the article. It has been proved that the increase in the academic load increases pupils’ intellectual working capacity and has no negative effect on physical fitness of the 1-3rd graders, but it increases their disease incidence that indicates a high physiological cost of organism adaptation to a more intensive academic load. The materials of the article can be useful to elementary school teachers and school psychologists in working out and planning training programs involving in-depth study of subjects.\n\nChasanova, N.
