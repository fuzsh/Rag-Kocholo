        "text": "The paper fuses reflection on a personal one-month visit in 2016-17 to Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, México, and how experiential learning and service in the borderlands inform course learning objectives, course design, and assignment structure for a border-themed freshman-composition course for international students. The questions include: Does the particularity of the U.S.-México border situation alienate or confuse those unfamiliar with U.S. immigration policy and the unique socio-economic and linguistic context? Does focused attention to narratives of physical border-crossing, such as those in Bass 1999 and Cucinella 2016, translate into awareness of imaginary borders, such as those dividing genders and gender identities, social groups (poor and rich; marginalized and powerful), well-being (sick and healthy), professions (e.g., military and civilian), and age (young and old)? How does students’ negotiation of writing in a second language affect their attention to and consciousness of both internal and intersubjective boundaries? The paper also considers the utility of experimenting with pedagogical techniques reflecting the teacher’s willingness to cross into unfamiliar terrain, exposure to visual texts and multimedia and writing in multiple genres, disciplined weekly self-reflection, and encouragement to take on a writer’s identity as border transgressor. “Living in a state of psychic unrest, in a Borderland,” writes Gloria Anzaldúa, “is what makes poets write and artists create” (1987 [2012], 95).\n\nI am an assistant professor at New Mexico State University; however, the path to getting to this position has been about crossing borders, about learning in and from the borderlands. The borderlands that my body has had to cross, physically and figuratively, have left many heridas abiertas (open wounds) but have also provided me with knowledge. The pain and struggles are constant reminders of the collisions that happen between el primer y tercer mundo and how these experiences leave open wounds. The inextricable relationship between Mexico and the US is deepened as Mexicanos like me are forced to come to El Norte, whether by choice or brought by parents. At almost 11 years old, my life changed—I crossed, with the help of a coyote, into Los Angeles, California. In the US, xenophobic spaces and actions have influenced and shaped my epistemologies and my awareness/conocimiento about navigating anti-immigrant spaces. This conocimiento was affirmed by and informs my teaching and research. This acute awareness, facultad (Anzaldúa, 1987), and use of these teaching tools are what I term pedagogical border crossings.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico borderlands are fraught with conflicts, metaphors, and euphemisms. As such, many students are cautious speaking to the complexities of the borderlands when they realize racist and anti-immigrant discourse are at its core. Borderlands pedagogy, however, can serve as a means of connectivity for social justice courses and for social and transformative justice curricula. This paper argues the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, as articulated through the citizenship regime, deals primarily in power and control; and those who have the power to define citizenship are those who have the control to claim citizenship. However, the transformative class- room can also help students articulate citizenship at various levels for empowerment and against the citizenship regime, and hence against racism. While scholarly focus on the borderlands has generally been on legalized notions of citizenship or on the border wall itself, borderlands pedagogy is useful in explaining and under- standing the inherent racism of the citizenship regime; and especially how we as diverse learning communities can challenge it, and consequently tear down walls; starting in the classroom.\n\nA recently constructed border wall stands within walking distance of Border High School (BHS) and was created to impede the flow of people, goods, fauna, and contraband from Mexico into the United States (U.S.). The reality, however, is that this geopolitical border is fluid, allowing connections between sociopolitical zones (Romo & Chavez, 2006). As posited by Romo and Chavez, “The geopolitical border between Mexico and the United States represents the beginnings, endings, and blending of languages, cultures, communities, and countries. It also reflects the complexity, juxtaposition, and intersection of identities, economies, and social and educational issues” (p. 142). Gruenewald (2003) noted an intimate connection between individuals and their inhabited space and that pedagogy of place can be a means of examining this relationship. Pedagogy of place, in turn, is linked to critical theory and considers borders as dynamic inhabited regions rather than divided, disparate locales div..."
