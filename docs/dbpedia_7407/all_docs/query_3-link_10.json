        "text": "Eurasia. Geographic cross-overs in art\n\n28th June to 16 November 2008\n\nMartRovereto\n\nCorso Bettini, 43\n\n38068 Rovereto (TN)\n\nwww.mart.trento.it\n\nThe 7th edition of Manifesta, the itinerant Biennale of contemporary art, will be hosted in 2008 by the Regione Autonoma Trentino-Alto Adige. At the same time, the Mart will present the Eurasia. Geographic cross-overs in art exhibition in the Rovereto site of the Museo di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Trento e Rovereto from 28th June to 16 November 2008.\n\nThe ambitious Eurasia exhibition arised from an idea by Achille Bonito Oliva, who will be the exhibition’s curator, flanked by an international team of young international curators comprising Lorenzo Benedetti, Iara Boubnova, Cecilia Casorati, Hu Fang, Christiane Rekade and Julia Trolp.\n\nThe exhibition will present a vision of art able to “pierce” every separate identity and indicate the possibilities of an art full of interchanges between Europe and Asia; in other words, “Eurasia”.\n\nThe title of the exhibition is borrowed from the name given by Beuys to a series of performances executed between 1966 and 1968, represented in the exhibition by the video of Eurasienstab, 1967, realised on 9th February 1968 at the Wide White Space in Antwerp.\n\nAccording to Beuys, Eurasia is a geographic vision and, at the same time, an expression of a new, complex artistic identity that is no longer territorial and self-sufficient, but aimed at the world and man.\n\nIn 1967, with a Manifesto, the German artist founded the fictitious state of Eurasia. This was an open territory without physical or dogmatic borders: the geographic representation of a utopia, a fusion of Western realism and Oriental mysticism, the venue for a totality as yet not dispersed.\n\nTotal art, a new humanism and ethical responsibility are the key words for a project that appears surprising if reconsidered from its inception in the 1960s to the present day, from Beuys to the latest generation.\n\nSome fundamental aspects of Beuys’ work – multiculturalism and the aspiration towards a total art, his stance regarding going beyond borders, and the “amplified concept of art” – find a timely echo in the work of artists of the young generation.\n\nThe exhibition, therefore, aims to stress the overcoming of a purely performative art in favour of a reflection making use of contents and themes of our time, a veritable emergence affirming the value of the co-existence of differences.\n\nAchille Bonito Oliva’s reflection takes its stimulus from the idea that it be possible to consider Beuys’ work in a historical perspective, while re-reading and re-planning it.\n\nThe exhibition will trace an original path through the artistic landscape of Eurasia territory and identify viewpoints and projects reacting to the aestheticisation of everyday life and the abuse of reality, proposing a linguistic complexity summarising different expressions.\n\nThe awareness that the model of new humanism in Eurasia is effectively being re-used today by many young artists imparts to the exhibition not only the task of documenting their work, but also the ambitious programme of championing an art that finally pays a close attention to reality and translates it into small utopias, between a desire and ecological hope for an improved quality of life.\n\nIf it is true, as Achille Bonito Oliva maintains, that “the excess of Duchampian indifference and performative hedonism of the last generation may lead not so much to the Hegelian “death of art” as that of the public, then Eurasia. Geographic cross-overs in art sets itself the objective of recovering a greater attention to social themes, and of promoting the total art of the young of an ideal continent that runs seamlessly from Europe\n\nto Asia.\n\nEurasia.
