All work sites—including bars and restaurants—are now included to ensure that all New Yorkers work in a safer environment. The original state law, passed in 1989, provided similar protections but in fewer work sites.\n\nNew York becomes the fifth state in the U.S. to provide such comprehensive public health protection from secondhand smoke—a substance with over 7,000 chemical compounds—including 69 known to cause cancer. Secondhand smoke is responsible for the deaths of approximately 49,000 non-smokers each year in the United States.\n\nThe law applies to virtually all places of business. Business owners are required to inform employees and patrons that smoking is prohibited indoors—including private offices and smoking rooms—and to post No Smoking signs in conspicuous places within their establishment.\n\nThe Monroe County Health Department regularly inspects facilities that are under permit from us and responds to complaints that we receive from the public to determine compliance with various provisions of the law.\n\nQuestions about how the statewide smoking law applies to your business can be answered by calling (585) 753-5075.\n\nInformational Links"
