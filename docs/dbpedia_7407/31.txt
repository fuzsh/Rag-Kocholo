A global online press. That's what you get with Pressmart. Taking newspapers, magazines, journals, books and corporate collateral online is our passion. We understand all digital channels including Web, Mobile, E-Reader, RSS, and Podcast well. Our products are designed to produce the best online reading experience; anywhere, anytime. Content is traditional media's most valuable asset. It's unique, local and well editorialized. But, tied only to print, it loses its potential to grow. With readers and advertisers increasingly moving online, Publishers have no choice but to move with them. Even after you've decided to go digital, the challenges don't go awaythey simply change in nature. That's why choosing the right online strategy and tools along with making the right investment requires a fair amount of expertise. Pressmart is a leading digital publishing platform provider working with publishers in 57 countries and in 33 languages. Pressmart is based out of Hyderabad and has presence in US, UK and Australia.
