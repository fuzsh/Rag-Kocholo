        "text": "As a well-traveled standup comedian, Bill Burr has been on hundreds if not thousands of different stages. But come 2025, the Canton native will be involved in a different type of stage production, making his Broadway debut in David Mamet’s “Glengarry Glen Ross.”\n\nBurr will be joined by Kieran Culkin (“Succession”) and fellow comedian Bob Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”), who is also making his Broadway debut in the revival of Mamet’s Tony Award-winning play.\n\nKnown for its lyrically profane dialogue, “Glengarry Glen Ross” first debuted on stage in September 1983, and was later adapted into a successful 1992 film starring Al Pacino, Jack Lemmon (“The Odd Couple”), Alec Baldwin, Ed Harris (“The Rock”), Alan Arkin (“Argo”), Kevin Spacey, and Jonathan Pryce (“Brazil”).\n\nSet at a cutthroat Chicago real estate agency, “Glengarry Glen Ross” follows the fortunes of four businessmen competing with each other to sell worthless properties to unsuspecting customers. The top seller at the end of the month gets a car, second place gets a watch, and the bottom two get fired.\n\nBurr will play salesman Dave Moss, a character with a chip on his shoulder known for his big mouth and lengthy rants, which should match Burr’s skillset perfectly. Moss was played by Harris in the 1992 film, by James Tolkan (“Back to the Future”) in the original Broadway production, and by Gordon Clapp (“NYPD Blue”) in the 2005 Broadway revival.\n\nOdenkirk, meanwhile, will play Shelly Levine, the veteran salesman past his prime and resigned to his fate. Levine was played by Lemmon in the film, Robert Prosky (“Thief”) in the original Broadway production, and Alan Alda (“M*A*S*H”) in the 2005 revival.\n\nCulkin will play Richard Roma, the firm’s ruthless top salesman. Roma was played by Pacino in the film, Joe Mantegna (“Criminal Minds”) in the original Broadway production, and Liev Schreiber (“Ray Donovan”) in the 2005 revival.\n\nCasting announcements for the remaining roles will be made at a later date, according to a press release.\n\nDirected by Patrick Marber (“Leopoldstadt”), “Glengarry Glen Ross” will make its bow on Broadway in the spring of 2025."
