        "text": "Coffee may be for closers, and now acclaimed actors Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk, and Bill Burr are getting their own highly caffeinated taste of Broadway legend.\n\nThe trio will lead the revival of David Mamet’s iconic play “Glengarry Glen Ross” in Spring 2025. The Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning drama was famously adapted into the 1992 film starring Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, and Al Pacino.\n\n“Glengarry Glen Ross” is set in a cutthroat Chicago real estate office where four salespeople compete to sell mostly worthless properties to unwitting customers. Whoever sells the most wins a car; whoever sells the least is out of a job – a ruthless environment where each character will do anything to come out on top, per the official synopsis.\n\nEmmy, SAG, Golden Globe, and Critics Choice Award winner Culkin returns to Broadway after his turn in “Succession” and the upcoming “A Real Pain.” Culkin previously led Kenneth Lonergan’s play “This is Our Youth.” He will play the role of Richard Roma in “Glengarry Glen Ross.”\n\nEmmy, SAG, and Critics Choice Award winner Odenkirk makes his Broadway debut with the play, and will portray frustrated salesman Shelly Levene.\n\nComedian and Emmy and Grammy Award nominee Burr is the character Dave Moss.\n\nThe revival will be directed by “Closer” and “Notes on a Scandal” writer Patrick Marber, who also helmed plays “Leopoldstadt,” “Travesties,” and “After Miss Julie.” Marber has won Tony and Olivier Awards.\n\n“In 1983, I saw the original production of ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’ in London,” Marber said in a press statement. “I was just nineteen. The play blew my young soul away. It was one of the reasons I wanted to work in theatre. Forty years later, I am so thrilled to be directing it on Broadway with these incredible actors. I will do my utmost to ensure that this great American play brings audiences the same great pleasures it brought to me.”\n\n“Glengarry Glen Ross” will open on Broadway in the spring of 2025. Additional cast, exact dates, full design team, and Broadway theatre will be announced at a later date. Jeffrey Richards and Rebecca Gold are the lead producers."
