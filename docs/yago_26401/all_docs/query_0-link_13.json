        "text": "No dog is mean enough to bite Alan Alda. Even bearing the full weight of a movie on his shoulders - directing, writing and starring in the new ''Sweet Liberty'' - he is good humored, cheerful, smiling his crinkly smile. Throughout the Hamptons, the word has spread that Mr. Alda might really be just what he appears to be: nice.\n\nThe stylish Hamptons don't often see a Hollywood production company deployed in full battle formation, but it turns out that, barring a few spoilsports, fashionable people find movies as glamorous as anyone else. This summer an invitation to visit the set of ''Sweet Liberty'' is the hottest ticket in the Hamptons.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Alda is a draw of the first magnitude. He is one of the rare stars to have made the giant step from television to the movies. In the 1979 season, while still with his record-breaking television series ''M*A*S*H,'' he had no fewer than three hit films. Two years later, his ''Four Seasons'' grossed at box offices in the domestic market alone some $50 million - well over triple the figure brought in by Warren Beatty's ''Reds.''\n\nA Film Within a Film\n\nOver the summer, the ''Sweet Liberty'' company has been shooting here and there throughout the Hamptons, using the period buildings to best advantage. On a recent afternoon, it was encamped in an airless, agrarian hollow under a baking sun in the Township of Southampton. Amid the fields were seven trucks, eight campers, a gorgeous, yellow-striped catering tent, a mock-up of a Colonial-style house, a motley assembly of some 200 people, and two movie cameras, one on a huge crane.\n\nAbruptly, over a hill come galloping three British redcoats - one of whom will turn into Michael Caine.But, curiously enough, whereas one camera seems focused on the oncoming British soldiers, the second camera seems focused on the first camera. For ''Sweet Liberty'' has a novel story.\n\nA college history professor, played by Mr. Alda, has written a best-selling nonfiction book about Mary Slocum, a heroine of the American Revolution. It is the professor's good or bad fortune to sell his book to Hollywood, from which alien place a film company arrives in the professor's college town to turn his book into what - judging from the screenplay - he decides is going to be an abomination. The scene now being played out is a movie company filming another movie company making a movie.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
