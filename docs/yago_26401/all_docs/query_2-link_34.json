        "text": "A second Date Night…?\n\nTen-time Emmy nominee Steve Carell (The Office, The Morning Show) will reunite with Emmy-winning actress/writer Tina Fey in The Four Seasons, Netflix‘s upcoming comedy based on the 1981 film of the same name, which starred and was written and directed by Alan Alda.\n\nProduction on the series is slated to begin later this year.\n\nThat original film, whose cast also includes Carol Burnett and Rita Moreno, followed three married couples who vacation together until one of the couples breaks up, leading to awkwardness for everyone else involved — especially when a much-younger girlfriend starts joining them on their seasonal trips.\n\nPer sister site Deadline, no details on Carell’s role have been released.\n\nThis is actually the second time a TV series based on this movie has been attempted. A CBS version, produced by Alda, ran for 13 episodes in 1984.\n\nIn addition to writing The Four Seasons, which has an eight-episode order from Netflix, Fey, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield are also executive-producing the project, along with David Miner, Eric Gurian and Jeff Richmond. Alda and Marissa Bregman are also on board as producers."
