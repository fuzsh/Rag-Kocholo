        "text": "Get Chicago & Midwest culture news sent to your inbox every weekday morning. Subscribe to Newcity Today here.\n\nDESIGN\n\nMore And More Empty Churches Converted To Hotels And Restaurants\n\n“With vaulted ceilings and stained-glass windows, the architectural features of churches have become huge draws for business owners,” relays the New York Times (gift link). “The Good Shepherd Lutheran Church in Des Plaines was converted into a restaurant called Foxtail on the Lake… The transformation was not easy: The shuttered church needed an eighteen-month, $6 million gut renovation, and a new 3,000-square-foot kitchen, before it could start offering items like paella and beef shawarma.”\n\nRiver North Offices Converting To Residential\n\n“Chicago Development Partners has an agreement to buy the office portion of a ten-story building at 111 West Illinois, which is expected to be redeveloped into apartments,” reports CoStar.\n\nCooper Hewitt Announces “Making Home—Smithsonian Design Triennial”\n\nCooper Hewitt and the Smithsonian Design Museum will present “Making Home—Smithsonian Design Triennial,” featuring twenty-five site-specific, newly commissioned installations. The exhibition explores design’s role in shaping the physical and emotional realities of home across the United States, U.S. territories and tribal nations. On view November 2 through summer 2025, “Making Home” is the seventh offering in the museum’s Design Triennial series, which was established in 2000 to address urgent topics of the time through design. Participants include Robert Earl Paige of Chicago, Nicole Crowder of St. Paul, and East Jordan Middle/High School from East Jordan, Michigan. More here.\n\nSlow Pace For CTA Hundred-Percent Accessibility Plan\n\n“The CTA is more accessible than systems in some big cities but hasn’t added an elevator in five years, and the estimated price tag for its plan has more than doubled to $4.9 billion,” charts the Sun-Times.\n\nFederal American Flags Will Be Made In America\n\n“All American flags purchased by the federal government will now be one-hundred-percent made in America with American materials,” posts Senator Sherrod Brown (Ohio) on Twitter, pointing to a Toledo Blade editorial: The bill, which Brown “says he has been pushing since 2011, passed on July 22, and has been signed by President Biden. Until now, government-bought flags only had to be fifty percent American-made. Federally purchased flags is not a big item in the overall picture of America’s gross domestic product… The entire market for imported American flags in 2015 was $4.4 million. Of that amount, $4 million of imported flags came from China. In 2017, the United States imported ten million American flags. Of those, all but 50,000 came from China.”\n\nDINING & DRINKING\n\nSmoking With Calumet Fisheries\n\n“Chicago’s legendary ninety-six-year-old smoked seafood shack has weathered changes while racking up awards, local love, and movie appearances,” writes Naomi Waxman at Eater Chicago. “When the shack changed hands in 1948, smoked fish were popular among travelers on the Calumet River, as well as the then-large Scandinavian community in the area and foundry workers in nearby Indiana. The river, a significant system of industrialized waterways, runs between Chicago’s South Side and the city of Gary. ‘Cal Fish’ took on the allure of a cave of wonders where treasures, buttery sable, tangy pepper garlic trout, and snappy, smoke-kissed shrimp, are retrieved from the sooty depths of the smokehouse. When [owner Mark] Kotlick was a teenager, he recalls smoking up to 200 pounds of chub a day for crowds of ravenous regulars.”\n\nThis Year’s Butter Cow Unveiled\n\nGovernor Pritzker and Illinois State Fair officials unveiled the Butter Cow in the Dairy Building on the Illinois State Fairgrounds. Inspired by the 2024 fair theme (“It’s Showtime!”), sculptor Sarah Pratt’s creation captures the magic of the fair through the eyes of a child. “While the Butter Cow is the undisputed star of the show, this year, the cow has a delightful companion—a little girl pulling a seven-scoop ice cream cone out of her magician’s hat.” More here.\n\nLincoln Square’s El Xangarrito Again For Sale\n\nThe husband-and-wife team behind El Xangarrito have put the restaurant on the market, reports Block Club. “Owners Rogelio Benitez and Erika Marroquin opened El Xangarrito, 4811 North Rockwell, in 2020… The BYO restaurant has opened and closed a few times since then, and now its owners have decided to place the business up for sale.” The owners have a lease on the location “and are only selling the business.” “We have been giving buyers options to either start their own concept in the place, or stay with our name and food as is (which will then essentially be under new ownership, if they decide to keep the name and menu),” the owner said. The popular restaurant “will remain open for the foreseeable future.” More El Xangarrito here.\n\nMcDonald’s “Collector’s Meal” Emblazons Cups With Products\n\nBeginning Tuesday, McDonald’s will offer a Collector’s Meal, reports Food & Wine, with “six different collectible cups to ‘inspire a new generation of fans.'” Selected meals with be paired with one of six cups harkening back to trademarked characters from prior McDonald’s promotions: Beanie Babies; Barbie & Hot Wheels; Hello Kitty & Peanuts; Shrek, Jurassic Park & Minions; Coca-Cola and… McDonald’s.\n\nLongtime New York Times Restaurant Critic Pete Wells Tucks It In\n\n“I’m at the end of twelve years as a critic who ate in and reviewed restaurants constantly. Of those years, I probably spent two solid months just waiting for the check,” writes Pete Wells in a thoughtful thumb-sucker at the New York Times. Changes have “gradually and steadily stripped the human touch and the human voice out of restaurants. Each of these changes was small, but together they’ve made going out to eat much less personal. Meals are different now, and our sense of who we are is different, too.”\n\nFILM & TELEVISION\n\nNoir City Chicago Falls In September\n\n“Under the thematic banner, ‘Darkness Has No Borders,’ this year’s Chicago ‘Noir City’ festival features thematically linked double bills pairing foreign language films with movies made in the United States and United Kingdom,” demonstrating “the global scope of film noir,” the Music Box posts. Passes are on sale here.\n\nLightfoot Will Provide Local Convention Commentary\n\n“Former Mayor Lori Lightfoot will be on-air for CBS Chicago during the DNC,” biographer Gregory Royal Pratt posts on Twitter. “Her administration (in)famously clashed with the station over Anjanette Young video… Lightfoot is a really smart, incisive and entertaining person. She has a ginormous blind spot/lack of self-awareness about things involving her but is otherwise quite good on the mic.” WBBM’s memo is at the link. From 2014, Robert Feder reported on former mayor Byrne’s run as a TV pundit: “In 1989—six years after she left City Hall—Byrne signed on as a paid political analyst for WBBM. No past or present mayor had ever done anything like that… Byrne retained the preeminent media agent Don Ephraim, whose blue-chip client list included heavyweights from Bill Kurtis and John Drury to Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Ephraim got the CBS-owned station to pay Byrne a cool $40,000 to make up to ten appearances on the air.”\n\nAnother CNN Media Columnist Exits Abruptly\n\nOliver Darcy, Warner Bros. Discovery’s CNN “Reliable Sources” critic, is out, reports Variety, “leaving the direction of the company’s media-industry franchise in doubt. A new newsletter from Darcy, called ‘Status,’ landed in email inboxes Thursday morning… In recent years, former TV anchors ranging from CNN’s Don Lemon to MSNBC’s Medhi Hasan to Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson have all lit out for digital territory in efforts to create their own business.” Darcy’s final newsletter opens with a bang: “David Zaslav had a particularly tough day. The Warner Bros. Discovery boss watched Wednesday afternoon as his company’s already anemic stock price plummeted more than ten percent in after-hours trading, hitting a dangerous new low of $6.90 after the company reported second quarter earnings.” The New York Times’ report is here.\n\nMUSIC\n\nLandmarking Wax Trax!\n\nAfter gathering more than 8,000 signatures on its petition, Wax Trax! Records continues the process to get landmark status for the original Chicago Wax Trax! building at 2449 North Lincoln, with inclusion in a City Hall hearing on Thursday for preliminary recognition, the label relays. The current owners “are fighting Landmark status and do not want this to move forward. They will be stating their case to the landmark commission as to why this building is not historically or culturally significant.” At yesterday’s hearing (after our deadline), Wax Trax! was ready “to explain the cultural significance and why the North Side building should be formally protected from alterations or demolition.” The petition is here.\n\nSTAGE\n\n“Glengarry Glen Ross” Returns To Broadway\n\nKieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr will perform in a Broadway revival of “Glengarry Glen Ross” in spring 2025, relays the Hollywood Reporter. “The production will be directed by Patrick Marber (‘Closer’), who won a 2023 Tony Award for his direction of Leopoldstadt. Odenkirk and Burr will make their Broadway debut in the play. David Mamet’s play, which was adapted into a 1992 film, is set in a Chicago real estate office, where four, cutthroat salespeople compete.” “Glengarry Glen Ross” “has had two Broadway revivals, in 2005, starring Alan Alda, Liev Schreiber and Jeffrey Tambor, and in 2012, starring Pacino, Bobby Canavale and David Harbour.” Says Marber, “In 1983, I saw the original production of ‘Glengarry Glen Ross’ in London… I was just nineteen. The play blew my young soul away. It was one of the reasons I wanted to work in theater.”\n\nBlue Man Group Sets Family-Friendly Halloween Performance\n\nBlue Man Group Chicago will celebrate Halloween with one performance at the Briar Street Theatre on Sunday, October 27, 1pm. “The spooktacular performance will feature pre-show face painting in the theater lobby, Halloween-inspired surprises during the show and celebratory goodie bags for all children in costume under age seventeen. Halloween costumes are encouraged for all audience members. After the performance, audience members will be invited to meet the Blue Men in the lobby for an exclusive photo opportunity. Celebrating more than twenty-five years in Chicago, Blue Man Group debuted at the Briar Street in 1997.” Tickets ($49 and up) here.\n\nARTS & CULTURE & ETC.\n\nDirector Of Programs At 3Arts Departs\n\nSidney Mori Garrett has moved from manager of programs at 3Arts to become interim director of programs, relays departing director of programs Sara Slawnik. “For the past ten years, 3Arts has been more than a professional home for me. It has been one of the most influential, energizing, and beloved places I’ve ever had the privilege to work. I am deeply grateful for the support and opportunities afforded to me during my tenure.” More 3Arts here.\n\nHigh Costs Postpone Chicago African Festival Of The Arts Until Next Year\n\n“The South Side’s African Festival for the Arts has been postponed until next year. Organizers said cost is a major factor,” reports WLS-TV. “At one time, the African Festival of the Arts would bring more than 200,000 people to Washington Park over the Labor Day Weekend. Last year, only around 25,000 people came.”\n\nDo Conventioneers Want An Obama Tour?\n\n“Obamaphiles in town for the DNC can get their fix by visiting these sites linked to POTUS 44, who lived on the South Side from 1985 to 2008,” maps Chicago magazine.\n\nWeather Service Confirms July 15 Was A Thirty-Two Tornado Day\n\n“The Chicago area was hit by a record thirty-two tornadoes during the July 15 derecho storm that ripped through the region. It was the ‘most prolific tornado event’ to hit the Chicago area in recorded history, according to the National Weather Service, breaking the record for the most number of tornadoes reported in a single event,” writes the Sun-Times.\n\nLincoln Park Zoo Now A Certified Botanical Garden\n\nLincoln Park Zoo, “which has more than 1,800 plants, was accredited a botanic garden by Botanic Gardens Conservation International for excelling in conservation and sustainability,” reports the Sun-Times."
