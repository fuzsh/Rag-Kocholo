        "text": "Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr will hit the Broadway stage next year in a revival of David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning play Glengarry Glen Ross.\n\nSet for a spring 2025 opening, Glengarry Glen Ross will mark a return to Broadway for Culkin (This Is Our Youth, 2014) but Broadway debuts for both Odenkirk and Burr. They’ll be directed by Patrick Marber, the Tony-winning director for Leopoldstadt.\n\nAdditional cast, exact dates, full design team, and Broadway venue will be announced at a later date. Jeffrey Richards and Rebecca Gold are the lead producers.\n\n“In 1983, I saw the original production of Glengarry Glen Ross in London,” Marber said. “I was just nineteen. The play blew my young soul away. It was one of the reasons I wanted to work in theatre. Forty years later, I am so thrilled to be directing it on Broadway with these incredible actors. I will do my utmost to ensure that this great American play brings audiences the same great pleasures it brought to me.”\n\nThe official synopsis: Glengarry Glen Ross is set in a cutthroat Chicago real estate office where four salespeople compete to sell mostly worthless properties to unwitting customers. Whoever sells the most wins a car; whoever sells the least is out of a job – a ruthless environment where each character will do anything to come out on top.\n\nCulkin, best known for his performance of Roman Roy in HBO’s hit series Succession, will play Richard Roma, the ruthless salesman role originated on Broadway in 1984 and played by Al Pacino in the 1992 film adaptation. Liev Schreiber played Roma in a 2005 Broadway revival.\n\nOdenkirk, best known for Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, will play Shelly Levine, the older has-been salesman. The role was originated by actor Robert Prosky on Broadway, with Jack Lemmon giving one of his most memorable performances in the film. Alan Alda played the role in the 2005 Broadway revival.\n\nBurr, a wildly popular stand-up comedian and star of stand-up TV specials, will play Dave Moss, the big-mouth, often ranting salesman played by James Tolkan in the original Broadway production and by Ed Harris in the movie. Gordon Clapp took the role in the 2005 revival."
