        "text": "Description\n\nAlan Alda is a renowned actor, best known for starring as Hawkeye Pierce on the long running television comedy M*A*S*H from 1972-1983. He wrote over a dozen episodes of the show and won multiple Emmy Awards for his acting, writing, and directing on the series. In later seasons of M*A*S*H, Alda gained more creative control as the showâ€™s original writers pursued other work. After the series ended, he went on to further success on notable TV series and movies and actively participates in charitable causes.\n\nCopyright Statement\n\nCopyrighted.
