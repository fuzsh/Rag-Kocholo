        "text": "Pictured: Bill Burr, Kieran Culkin & Bob Odenkirk. Courtesy of Netflix, HBO & AMC.\n\nThe famed screen actors Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk & Bill Burr are set to revive David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award-winning play Glengarry Glen Ross in the Spring of 2025.\n\nGlengarry Glen Ross shares the story of a car dealership and the cutthroat environment a sales initiative creates when the prize for selling the most cars is your own car and the punishment for selling the least means you will be laid off.\n\nWhile many of the details are still being ironed out, ie. the rest of the cast, the exact dates, Broadway venue, etc, the leads have been locked in and the Tony-winning director, Patrick Marber, is more than excited as he saw the original 1983 London production which lit a fire under the then 19 year old Marber. “It was one of the reasons I wanted to work in theatre. Forty years later, I am so thrilled to be directing it on Broadway with these incredible actors,” Marber says about Glengarry Glen Ross.\n\nCulkin, known for his role as the brash and snarky Roman Roy in HBO’s Succession, is the perfect Richard Roma. Roma is a ruthless and highly successful car salesman who has been portrayed by Joe Mantegna in the original, Al Pacino in the 1992 film, and Liev Schreiber in a 2005 Broadway revival. This will be the second time Culkin has been on Broadway, debuting in Kenneth Lonergan’s This Is Our Youth.\n\nOdenkirk on the other hand, will be making his Broadway debut as he reprises the role of Shelly Levene, a once dominant peddler fallen further from grace. Odenkirk’s role as ex-scam artist Saul Goodman in Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad makes him the perfect person to fill the shoes of the similarly scheming Shelly Levene, left behind by Robert Prosky of the original Glengarry Glen Ross, Jack Lemmon of the film adaptation, and Alan Alda of the 2005 revival.\n\nBurr will also be a Broadway debutante as the talkative Dave Moss who often gets distracted by his own rants. As one of the kings of rant stand-up comedy, Burr is perfectly outfitted to do what he does best with Dave Moss. The role was filled by James Tolkan in the original Broadway production, by Ed Harris in the movie and reprised by Gordon Clapp in the 2005 revival. Comedians are just now infiltrating the stage with comics like Mike Birbiglia, Jaqueline Novak, and Alex Edelman putting one-man/woman shows on Broadway. Bill Burr is taking the leap into the deep end, acting in a Broadway play but there’s nothing to be afraid of because he knows how to swim."
