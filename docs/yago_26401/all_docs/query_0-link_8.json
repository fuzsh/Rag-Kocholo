        "text": "“I love history…so old” Elliott James\n\nMichael Burgess is a university lecturer who finds his life turned upside down after selling the film rights to his academic work on the revolutionary war. When the Hollywood crew rolls into town he is dismayed to find his work changed beyond recognition and historical accuracy thrown out in favour of sex and melodrama. With the help of the film’s eccentric screenwriter Michael does battle with the film’s director and stars to win back the project while also attempting to resolve a complicated relationship with his girlfriend and supporting his increasingly paranoid and crazy mother.\n\nWhile writing this blog I am always a little cautious of not letting my appreciation of Michael Caine become overstated. Then along comes another film like Sweet Liberty where he is so clearly the best thing in it that it becomes increasingly difficult. Caine plays actor and Hollywood star Elliott James and despite not making a full entrance until over thirty minutes into the film he manages to light up every moment he is on screen. James is a womaniser and thrill seeker who finds all of his bad behaviour is indulged by an adoring public. Whether he is temporarily hijacking a helicopter, driving with reckless abandon or changing the seating arrangement in the middle of a rollercoaster ride all his activities are never questioned by his employers or his audience. Caine is ideally placed to represent that star quality and is hugely charming and charismatic as always. He lights up the screen in every scene and while he has some of the best lines (“They all have names, but we’ll work on that in the car” when introducing his wife to the group is one example of how he gets all the wittiest lines) he also gets a huge amount out of humour from his facial expressions not least during his fencing battles with Michael or the beautiful reaction to the realisation that his wife has arrived to visit him on location. Most impressive and enjoyable though is the scene he recounts a meeting with Winston Churchill shortly after leading the group in a rendition of Knees Up Mother Brown. It’s a compelling and charismatic performance that is also very funny and one of several moments that left me wishing he was in the film a whole lot more.\n\nThat feeling is partly due to Sweet Liberty being something of a missed opportunity. While it is far from a disaster there is definitely the sense of a better film hidden away there. Alan Alda plays Michael as well as writing and directing the film and it is the focus on his relationship with girlfriend Gretchen played by Lise Hilbodt that most hold things back. While the creative battle between Michael and the filmmakers offers the most entertaining aspects of the film we are constantly being dragged back to the conflict between Michael and Gretchen that never really feels real. Indeed the very nature of the conflict feels incredibly forced and unnatural from the characters. When we meet them Michael is pushing towards the idea of them moving in together while Gretchen is very reluctant to even consider the idea. Before we know it Michael is then increasingly angry and defensive as he believes that Gretchen wants them to get married, which is a commitment he doesn’t want to make. It’s an inconsistency that makes absolutely no sense and given the importance that is placed on their relationship lends an unsatisfactory element to the whole film and leaves the apparent happy ending feeling very flat. It also creates the problem that with Michael’s defensive reactions seeming so bizarre he becomes quite a difficult character to warm to despite Alda generally being a likeable performer and leaves you siding heavily with Gretchen when she reacts angrily to his behaviour.\n\nFar more successful are the scenes set in and around the making of the film. Along with Caine the other stand out performer in a supporting role is Bob Hoskins who plays Stanley Gould the film’s screenwriter who strikes up an unlikely friendship with Michael. There is a lot of fun to be had from Hoskins’ playing of the hyperactive writer and his attempts to guide Michael through the political machinations of a film set. Saul Rubinek gives a good turn as the put upon director trying to turn a historical drama into a film to appeal to a young cinema-goer and there is more fun to be had in his attempt to film a battle scene and Michael’s attempt to disrupt it than there is in the whole of the main romantic plot. Throw in more regular appearances from Caine and a young Michelle Pfeiffer as the female lead going full method on her part and it really does leave you wishing there had been much more focus on the filmmakers rather than the local romance.\n\nThe final element of the script sees Michael dealing with his increasingly paranoid mother who can’t really cope on her own, but won’t allow anybody into her house, believes the devil lives in her kitchen and is convinced that an old friend is deeply in love with her despite him having had to move from the town just to get away from her. It’s a lovely turn from Lilian Gish in her penultimate screen role and rounds off what is a very strong cast. It also sets up one of the film’s best set pieces as Michael is persuaded by Gretchen to try and hunt down the man his mother is convinced is her lover with Stanley in tow cramped into the back of their small car.\n\nSweet Liberty is an enjoyable little comedy that is at it’s best when Caine or Hoskins are on screen. While the romantic plot isn’t particularly successful there is just enough elsewhere to save it and make for a watchable if flawed viewing experience."
