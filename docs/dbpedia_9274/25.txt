These photos show Ysgol John Bright in Llandudno from years gone by.

There are a number of sporting photos such as the successful badminton team in 1980, Wales and Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall visiting his old school and his old sports teacher Ken Davies, and selection of photos when the school was still known as Llandudno County School.

There's also Sarah Hoey Eliazabeth Horobin and Danielle Ellis-Owen with some of the donations that went to auction to raise money for a new school minibus and the-then First Minister Rhodri Morgan answering questions during a meeting where parental concerns over the rebuildiing of the school on contaminated land were voiced back in 2002.

And there's Jemma Scott and Natalie Ollerton with an anatomical model at a school open day in October 1994 and Alex Evans and Mark Booth on a computerised synthesiser during the same day.
