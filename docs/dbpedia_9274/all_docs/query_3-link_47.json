        "text": "Election 2024: Getting to know the Suffolk Mayoral Candidates\n\nPublished 9:00 am Thursday, August 8, 2024\n\nGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nDavid Bosselman\n\nTell the voters a little about yourself. (Where you are from, family, work, hobbies, etc.)\n\nI am a lifelong resident of Suffolk (Nansemond County) and have been happily married to Audrey Page Bosselman for 37 years. As a fourth-generation farmer, I am proud that Audrey Page and I were able to raise our sons, Brian (Kortni) and Hunter (Alex) as fifth generation farmers. Their children are now the sixth generation of Bosselmans to live in the Myrtle community. I enjoy hunting, fishing, tending to my garden, and spending time with my growing family.\n\nWhat are a few of your favorite things about Suffolk, and what sets this city apart from other cities in Hampton Roads?\n\nBorn and raised in Old Nansemond County, I have been afforded a lifestyle including open space, fresh air, and nature. Even as Suffolk has grown, I still enjoy the small town feel that so many people who have always called Suffolk home and people who have recently moved here crave. Suffolk has wonderful natural resources like the Great Dismal Swamp and the Nansemond River with its rich history as home to the Nansemond Indian Tribe. We once laid claim as the “Peanut Capital” of the world, and I am proud of my small contribution to that as a peanut farmer.\n\nWhat made you decide you were interested in serving as mayor?\n\nAbout six years ago, I started becoming more involved in speaking with our city leadership concerning local government and the direction Suffolk is headed particularly with the 2045 Comprehensive Plan. Rural communities in Suffolk have long felt as if they have been ignored. The more I attended meetings and talked to citizens in the suburban and urban areas of the city, I realized that feeling ignored is not unique to the rural communities. I was approached by members of my church family and respected citizens of my community who encouraged me to seek election as Mayor.\n\nWhat experience do you have that qualifies you as mayor?\n\nAs President and Co-Founder of Bosselman Farms, I have developed skills in time management, accounting, fiscal responsibility, understanding market and economic values, crop management, and how to undertake problem solving on a daily basis. In addition to running a thriving business, I serve as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Providence United Methodist Church, Chairman of the Farm Service Agency Committee, and Chairman of the Suffolk Agricultural Advisory Committee. I am a current member of the Farm Bureau Board and have served as Chairman of Tidewater Petroleum.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish should you be elected mayor?\n\nI hope to improve the quality of life for every resident of Suffolk and for future generations who make Suffolk their home. I will listen to and take into consideration what citizens of each Borough have to say about what is affecting their communities. I hope to improve trust between the citizens and the City Government by actually being transparent. I will work to implement a plan for balanced growth based on the city’s ability to provide basic services to support that growth. I hope to make citizens feel like their voices are heard by taking action on their ideas.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in your first 90 days in office?\n\nI will establish a relationship with the City management and get to know the people who work with the City. While the City Manager will always maintain the day-to-day operations, it is important for a mayor to know the names and faces and understand the concerns of the hard-working employees who keep things running. I would like to hear and address citizen’s concerns over the direction Suffolk is being led. I will foster true transparency to build a better rapport between the Mayor’s Office, City Council, Planning & Zoning and the citizens.\n\nWhat are the most important issue(s) facing Suffolk?\n\nThe 2045 Comprehensive Plan is the most important issue facing Suffolk. The current council seems to be bent on moving forward with a plan that expands on the already problematic current plan. The 2035 comp plan has allowed for overdevelopment and traffic congestion and has strained our infrastructure, public services, and our school system. These issues are negatively impacting the overall quality of life for the citizens of Suffolk. We must rethink the passing of the 2045 comp plan by listening to and addressing the concerns of our citizens.\n\nHow do you plan to address those issues?\n\nIf the 2045 Comprehensive Plan is adopted, as Mayor, I will ensure the Council has the information to make truly informed decisions on the impact of its vote on rezoning and other issues. The Council should have robust fiscal impact analysis and community facilities plans for every project prior to approving rezoning and variances. I will encourage each Council member to consider how we have planned to provide basic services to our citizens and how the quality of life will be improved for our citizens in the wake of development instead of playing costly catch-up.\n\nWhat is your long-term vision for the City of Suffolk? Where do you see the city in 5, 10, and 20 years from now?\n\nI envision the City of Suffolk as a community that offers a balance of commercial, residential, agricultural, and recreational areas. I see a Suffolk that has thriving businesses, quality educational systems, to include vocational and technical education programs, and maintains its small-town charm. I fear with the direction we are currently headed that there will be little, if any, agricultural land and open space left in Suffolk. We are at a pivotal point, and we must be better stewards of our City.\n\nWhat is something voters may not know about you that you would like them to know?\n\nI would like the citizens of Suffolk to know although I am “just a farmer,” farming requires much attending and daily problem-solving and operates as a business. As COVID-19 shut down our country in 2020, farmers were considered essential workers. You see, we feed and clothe the world. I am confident in my decision to serve as your mayor.\n\n________________________\n\nMike Duman\n\nTell the voters a little about yourself. (Where are you from, family, work, hobbies, etc.)\n\nI have lived in Suffolk since 1977 and owned a business since 1980. I graduated from Churchland High School and Old Dominion University. I served as a Military Intelligence Officer in the US Army Reserve.I have been married to my wife, Fran, for 52 years. We have two sons and four granddaughters.\n\nMy business and City of Suffolk obligations do not afford me time for hobbies. However, when time permits, I enjoy taking one of my therapy dogs to Obici Hospital or assisted living facilities or reading to kids in schools or libraries.\n\nWhat are a few of your favorite things about Suffolk, and what sets this city apart from other cities in Hampton Roads?\n\nMy favorite thing about Suffolk is its diversity. As a city of 430 square miles with a burgeoning economy, we can offer any lifestyle and landscape an individual may desire and ample opportunities for many businesses.\n\nSuffolk has a unique history and character, unlike any other Hampton Roads City. Our diverse citizenry is engaging, welcoming, and committed to joining together to make Suffolk an exceptional place to live, work, and raise a family.\n\nWhat made you decide you were interested in serving as mayor?\n\nI ran for Mayor four years ago because I wanted to be more effective and accomplish more for our citizens than I was as a Councilman.\n\nI believe the knowledge I gained serving ten years on the City Council and my fifty years of business experience positioned me to lead our city as we continued to grow and prosper.\n\nWhat experience do you have that qualifies you to serve as mayor?\n\nMy extensive experience uniquely qualifies me to continue serving as your Mayor. I have participated in 320 council meetings, presided over 84, and engaged in 16 annual budgets, 2 comprehensive plans, and 4 compensation studies. In the past four years, I secured our AAA bond ratings, saving taxpayers millions. I collaborate closely with the school board and regional leaders, serving on key Hampton Roads commissions. I also garnered $30.1 million for the Rte. 460 project. My strong working relationships with city management, staff, and officials ensure sound decisions and high service levels for our citizens.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish should you be elected mayor of Suffolk?\n\nIf re-elected, I will continue to base my decisions on a comprehensive analysis of current and future ramifications based on data and citizen input.\n\nI will strive to complete ongoing and planned initiatives and capital projects, including concentrating on school construction.\n\nI will continue to ensure that our city is fiscally sound and that the allocation of available resources is equitable and justifiable, manage population and economic growth by balancing the need for revenue with the desire to protect our city’s unique character and our citizen’s quality of life.\n\nSafety and education will continue to be primary concerns as evidenced by the 57% allocation of local tax dollars allocated to these budget line items.\n\nAs Mayor, our city has thrived. It continues to provide exceptional services to our citizens without raising taxes. Quite the contrary, the real estate tax rate was reduced in 2022, tax relief was provided in 2023, and reduced again in 2024.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in your first 90 days in office?\n\nUpon re-election, during my first 90 days, I will contact newly elected City Council and School Board members to build rapport and establish a basis for future communication and collaboration.\n\nWhat are the most important issue(s) facing Suffolk?\n\nIn my opinion, the most important issue facing Suffolk is managing growth. We are fortunate that Suffolk is a city where people from all walks of life desire to live and businesses want to locate\n\nIn recent years, the increase in population and commerce, as well as the buildout of warehousing facilities, has accelerated the need for additional infrastructure and necessitated changes in policy and guidelines.\n\nAnother issue is ensuring public safety. We need to continue to allocate adequate funding to provide the resources and the ability to attract and retain qualified, dedicated personnel.\n\nLastly, securing funding for infrastructure improvements and schools will be a challenge.\n\nHow do you plan to address those issues?\n\nOver the last several years, there have been numerous changes to the Unified Development Ordinance that regulate warehouses, solar facilities, and density. In addition, the 2045 Comprehensive Plan will provide additional guidance.\n\nFortunately, crime is down in Suffolk, and we enjoy one of the lowest crime rates in Hampton Roads. I am most pleased with the recently established Public Safety Committee. The committee has opened lines of communication with our citizens and provided a forum for all public safety and related department heads to collaborate and a process to immediately address safety concerns and enhancements.\n\nWe will continue to aggressively explore all options and pursue funding at the state and federal level for infrastructure to avoid any additional tax burden on our citizens.\n\nWhat is your long-term vision for the City of Suffolk? Where do you see the city in 5, 10, and 20 years from now?\n\nMy long-term vision will be guided by our city’s Vision Statement and the 2045 Comprehensive Plan. Decisions guiding future years regarding economic development, housing, transportation, public facilities and services, and the preservation and enhancement of natural and cultural resources must be carefully considered to support and enhance our city’s unique character and heritage.\n\nWhat is something voters may not know about you that you would like them to know?\n\nI spoon-feed and share a cup of yogurt with my 3 dogs every morning. I have a Harley-Davidson Dyna Low Rider in my garage that I ride occasionally. From 10 years old until I was 17, I showed and trained German shepherds. I am an Eagle Scout. I was in the first ROTC class at Old Dominion University. I participated with the Boy Scouts in the 1964 World’s Fair in New York. I keep a pad of paper and a pen in my nightstand in case I wake up and have a thought I may forget in the morning.\n\n___________________________________\n\nClinton Jenkins\n\nTell the voters a little about yourself.

I’ve gained extensive experience working on legislation that provided resources during the COVID-19 Pandemic, including rental and unemployment assistance, financial support for small businesses, funding to expand broadband services, expanded dental access for all Medicaid recipients, reducing the cost of insulin, funding for infrastructure needs, and pay raises for teachers, emergency responders, state troopers, and sponsors legislation that worked on affordable housing initiatives.

I will stand against the impacts of the proposed Project 2025 plan on our city.\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in your first 90 days in office?\n\nIn my first 90 days, I’ll focus on reviewing current initiatives, meeting with community leaders and residents, and setting clear priorities. I’ll work on improving public safety and youth programs, enhancing communication and transparency, boosting economic development, and addressing immediate community needs. My focus will be on making tangible progress from day one.\n\nWhat are the most important issue(s) facing Suffolk?\n\nKey issues include improving public safety, managing sustainable smart growth, improving our school system, expanding public transportation, availability of affordable housing, and addressing environmental and infrastructure needs. We also need to promote economic development and ensure greater economic access for underserved communities. The needs of our diverse populations, including our African American communities, are crucial to address.\n\nHow do you plan to address those issues?\n\nI’ll tackle these issues by collaborating with federal, state, and local representatives, community members, church leadership, businesses, and subject experts. We’ll use Suffolk’s Geographic Information System (GIS) to make informed decisions about development and infrastructure. Strategic plans will include supporting small businesses, improving our roads, and partnering with schools and businesses to enhance education. Redevelopment efforts will focus on providing economic opportunities for underserved communities, ensuring everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed.\n\nWhat is your long-term vision for the City of Suffolk? Where do you see the city in 5, 10, and 20 years from now?\n\nIn five years, I see improved public safety, Suffolk thriving with enhanced infrastructure, and a strong local economy. In ten years, we’ll have top-notch schools and be a model for Hampton Roads, robust job opportunities, and revitalized communities. In twenty years, Suffolk will be a model of sustainable development and a welcoming, inclusive community where every resident can prosper.\n\nWhat is something voters may not know about you that you would like them to know?\n\nMany might not know about my deep commitment to community service. My dedication to family and community drives me to work tirelessly for Suffolk. I’m determined to lead by example and make Suffolk a place where everyone can thrive and feel proud to call home. Our city has a bright future, and together, we can achieve greatness.\n\n________________\n\nSchool Board Q&As"
