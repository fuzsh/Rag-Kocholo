        "text": "15th November 2017 - Catch Up® Excellence Awards: Coedpenmaen Primary School, PONTYPRIDD - GOLD award winner\n\nCoedpenmaen is a mainstream primary school with additional intake at Year 3 from a local infants’ school. All children are screened at the end of Year 2 to identify any gaps in learning – ensuring that all Year 3 children start Key Stage 2 with the opportunity to fill gaps in basic skills, both in literacy and numeracy. The approach with Catch Up® we have taken at Coedpenmaen has shown that pupils’ confidence and basic skills improve considerably, and that this has a positive impact on pupils’ ability to function more effectively in the classroom. I only wish we could offer it to even more pupils!\n\nRead award entry\n\n26th February 2016 - Catch Up® Excellence Awards: Cogan Primary School, Nr. Penarth - BRONZE award winner (Catch Up® Literacy)\n\nCogan Primary School is situated on the outskirts of the large seaside town of Penarth, and was built in 1884. There are currently 207 pupils on roll. Within the school, there is a Hearing Resource Base with 6 pupils who are integrated into mainstream classes with support. 14% of pupils are on our SEN register and 12% of pupils are on our FSM register. 6% of our pupils speak a language other than English at home.\n\nWe received an excellent report from our last ESTYN inspection in February 2011, placing us within the top 11% of schools in Wales and in which our Hearing Resource Base was deemed ‘sector leading’.\n\nRead award entry\n\nThe Catch Up® Web site use \"cookies\" to help you personalise your online experience.
