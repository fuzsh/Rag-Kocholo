        "text": "4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserIn the morning I received an email to allow me to fill in my personal details to speed up checking as well as a courtesy call to confirm my reservation and expected time of arrival. As someone who worries this was reassuring. When arriving at the hotel it was interesting getting into the car park. Once I got the code I found it very tight due to a car parked in one of the bays protruding much further than the lines. After some careful manoeuvring a member of staff informed me I could park lengthways against the wall instead. Which was a relief. When we walked round to the front of the building the first thing I noticed was the beautiful view and facade of the hotel. It has an attractive coloured glass porch with a lovely art deco design. The location is absolutely perfect. Across the road from the beach and pier and a short stroll from all the restaurants, bars and attractions. The lobby is calm and inviting. We checked in quickly and effortlessly once a very pleasant member of staff arrived. Our room was very spacious and accessible. Immaculately clean and comfortable. The hotel can cater for wheelchair users so there was a wheelchair accessible shower in the bathroom (on the 3rd floor). Due to the nature of the structure the floors are uneven which means there was a small gap under the door. The staff provided extra towels to block this for us. The bar was clean, calm, comfortable and well stocked with a good selection of drinks and snacks. For a hotel so close to the pier it was also reasonably priced (approx £8 for a large white wine). Breakfast was served between 8-10am with lots of choice. The room was spacious. Guests can help themselves to cereals, yoghurt, fruit and pastries etc. There is also a hot buffet. At busy times there was a short wait for some items as they are cooked in small batches. This means while you may wait a bit the items are all hot and fresh. The produce used is good quality and we enjoyed our meal. Other items such as poached and scrambled eggs are available on request. The staff were exceptionally friendly. Anna and Natalia in particular made our stay very enjoyable. My son was upset when we left and already wants to go back. We are looking forward to visiting again soon.\n\nShow More\n\n4.0/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserWe've stayed here several times over the years and always found the hotel well lit outside and warm and welcoming inside. Not now I'm afraid. We arrived on a cold , wet and windy day to find the front door locked. Within minutes I got a call to ask if we were still coming and I pointed out we were parked at the front of the hotel. Very few lights on and when we got to our room it was cold. Apparently the heating doesn't come on until 5 o'clock as ”most guests like to be out during the day”. Not on a day like this in December they don't. And we had a big room. After a visit to a local cafe we returned to find the heating still off. I tried the reception buzzer on three occasions and 'phoned the mobile three times before I got an answer. Heating came on. The smell in the room was reminiscent of football changing rooms in the 1960's - a hint of wintergreen. Room was big, shower room warm and bright and the shower itself efficient. Later we found the TV didn't work , which they changed for us, and we also had a chair with a broken leg. Both caused by the previous occupants apparently. Uncomfortable night as the room never really got warm. Also disturbed by the rattling windows which I fixed by wedging in some cardboard. Breakfast was good and plentiful, but, again , the room wasn't warm. My wife bought an extra fleece to wear in the hotel. The bedroom was only serviced twice during our five days. As it seemed we were the only guests I'd have thought it would be easy to make the beds etc. Somewhat disturbingly there are two signs saying ”It's forbidden to bring in your own food”. Could we phrase that a bit more kindly? What was once a well lit and warm hotel is now dismal. It's not expensive, but there are so many other hotels in this big resort offering very similar prices that they need to make some considerable improvements. I wish them well and hope the improvements happen, but at the moment I can see little to recommend it.\n\nShow More"
