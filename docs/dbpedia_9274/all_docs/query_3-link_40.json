        "text": "Getty Images\n\nMen's Swimming & Diving | August 08, 2024\n\n14 USC swimmers and divers past, present and future wrapped up 13 total days of Olympic competition on Thurs., Aug. 8, tallying nine championship final appearances in total at the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nUSC's highest finish came from two-time Olympian Krzysztof Chmielewski of Poland, who touched fourth in the championship final of the men's 200m butterfly. Chmielewski clocked a school-record worthy time of 1:53.90 to finish fourth and improve four spots from his eighth-place finish at the 2021 Games. Later in the week, the rising Trojan sophomore swam the 1500m Freestyle, clocking a 15:04.99 to finish 16th.\n\nIncoming Trojan diver Kate Miller turned in a stellar Olympic debut as the Canadian finished fourth in the women's 10-meter synchronized diving event alongside her partner Caeli McKay. Less than five points separated the Canadian duo from a bronze medal, as Miller and McKay tallied 299.22 (Great Britain's third-place tallied 304.38 points to earn bronze). Individually, Miller was 20th in the 10-meter platform diving event (266.30).\n\nCurrent USC swimmers Minna Abraham (Hungary) turned in three strong performances for Hungary during her Olympic Games debut, reaching the semifinals in the 200M Freestyle as the Trojan finished 14th in the event. She also swam on Hungary's 4x200m freestyle relay that placed sixth. In the 4x100m Freestyle relay, Abraham helped Hungary to a 10th place finish.\n\nMichal Chmielewski, the twin brother of Krzysztof made his Olympic debut in Paris, finishing 9th in the 200m Butterfly in a personal best time of 1:54.64. Chmielewski made it through to the semifinal but finished in the first-alternate spot for the championship final.\n\nClass of 2020 graduate and NCAA Champion Louise Hansson raced in four events at the Games, finishing eighth in the 100m Butterfly (57.34), 15th in the 100m Backstroke (1:00.47) and helped Sweden to two top-8 finishes in relays.\n\nAnother bright moment for the Trojans came from class of 2016 graduate Kasia Wasick, who finished 5th in the 50m freestyle in 24.33 while representing Poland in her fifth Olympic Games.\n\nFull results from USC's competing Swimmers and Divers can be found below.\n\nRESULTS -- TROJANS IN PARIS\n\nSWIMMING --\n\nMinna Abraham (Hungary)\n\n6th in the 4x200m Freestyle Relay (reached Olympic final)\n\n10th in the 4x100m Freestyle Relay\n\n14th in the 200m Freestyle (1:57.78) (reached Olympic semifinal)\n\nKasia Wilk-Wasick (Poland)\n\n5th in the 50m Freestyle (24.33) (reached Olympic final)\n\n13th in the 4x100m Freestyle Relay\n\nLaticia Transom (New Zealand)\n\n8th in the 4x200m Freestyle Relay (reached Olympic final)\n\nLouise Hansson (Sweden)\n\n5th in the 4x100m Freestyle relay (reached Olympic final)\n\n7th in the 4x100m Medley relay (reached Olympic final)\n\n8th in the 100m Butterfly (57.34) (reached Olympic final)\n\n15th in the 100m Backstroke (1:00.47) (reached semifinals)\n\nAnicka Delgado (Ecuador)\n\n26th in the 50m Free (25.43)\n\nDylan Carter (Trinidad and Tobago)\n\n29th in the 50m Freestyle (22.18)\n\n34th in the 100m Freestyle (49.35)\n\nArtem Selin (Germany)\n\n38th in the 50m Freestyle (22.54)\n\nMichal Chmielewski (Poland)\n\n9th in the 200m Butterfly (1:54.64) (reached Olympic semifinal)\n\nKrzysztof Chmielewski (Poland)\n\n4th in the 200m Butterfly (1:53.90) (reached Olympic final)\n\n16th in the 1500m Freestyle (15:04.99)\n\nVictor Johansson (Sweden)\n\n16th in the 800m Freestyle (7:49.47)\n\n18th in the 400m Freestyle (3:47.98)\n\n17th in the 1500m Freestlye (15:05.62)\n\nVaggelis Makrygiannis (Greece)\n\n9th in 100m backstroke (52.97) (reached Olympic semifinal)\n\nNikola Miljenic (Croatia)\n\n33rd in the 50m Free (49.34)\n\nDIVING --\n\nKate Miller (Canada)\n\n4th in the 10-Meter Synchronized diving event (299.22) (reached Olympic final)\n\n20th in the 10-Meter Platform diving event (266.30) (reached Olympic semifinal)\n\nMoritz Wesemann (Germany)\n\n12th in the 3-Meter Springboard diving event (363.65) (reached Olymic final)\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\nAnicka Delgado\n\nFREE/FLY\n\n5' 9\"\n\nSenior\n\nVaggelis Makrygiannis\n\nBACKFREE\n\n6' 3\"\n\nSenior\n\nArtem Selin\n\nFREE\n\n6' 3\"\n\nJunior\n\nMinna Abraham\n\nFREE/IM\n\n6' 0\"\n\nFreshman\n\nKrzysztof Chmielewski\n\nFREE/IM/FLY\n\n5' 9\"\n\nFreshman\n\nMichal Chmielewski\n\nFLY/FREE\n\n5' 8\"\n\nFreshman"
