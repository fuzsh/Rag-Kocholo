It is the only English medium high school to serve the town and its hinterland. Road and rail links along the North Wales coast are excellent and in one hour or less you can be in Chester, Liverpool, Manchester airport, the Holyhead ferry port to Ireland or within the grandeur of the Snowdonia National Park and its mountains.\n\nThe school is named after the Victorian radical politician John Bright who came to the town for respite and whose young son was buried here. After almost one hundred years the school had outgrown its previous premises and in September 2004 the new school opened on a 25 acre site with excellent facilities.\n\nYsgol John Bright has a very varied catchment area. There are nine designated primaries which range in size and type. We serve two of the most deprived wards and two of the most prosperous wards in the town. Indeed inspectors described us as a “truly comprehensive school”. The roll is currently at 1247, with 224 in our vibrant and expanding Sixth Form.\n\nSchool Buildings\n\nThe new school has been suited for each curriculum area. There are five blocks which are linked by a central mall. Each faculty has an office and there is a large staff workroom adjoining the generous staff-room. Our superb facilities include:-\n\nTechnology Block with workshops, cad/cam with 24 top spec computers, art with pottery wheel and kiln, textiles with display area and food technology rooms including commercial standard stainless steel kitchen.\n\n12 Science laboratories on three floors with a prep room on each floor linked by a dumb waiter.\n\nLibrary resource centre which has fingerprint borrowing system.\n\nWelsh and MFL corridor with seminar rooms for use by language assistants.\n\nDrama classroom with specialist lighting and sound systems.\n\nAll staff now share work through Google Education which is a cloud based learning environment.\n\nSquash courts which are demountable to a dance/performance space.\n\nMusic and photography departments with full suite of Apple Macs.\n\nPE facilities are extensive- gymnasium, very large sports hall, 2 all-weather pitches (one to international hockey standards) 2 fenced tarmac hard play areas and extensive grass pitches and play areas.\n\nSixth Form area with separate Year 12 and Year 13 workrooms with computer facilities.\n\nEvery teacher has a Chromebook and projector in their classroom to enable electronic registration and all have access to the curriculum network and the internet.\n\nStaff Development\n\nThe Governors believe passionately in the continued professional development of all staff employed in the school. Training needs are identified either through Performance Management interviews or within Faculty School Improvement Plans. These are then incorporated into our School Improvement Plan. We have an established programme for the induction of new staff both newly qualified and experienced."
