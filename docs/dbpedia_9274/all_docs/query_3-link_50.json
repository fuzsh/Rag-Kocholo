        "text": "LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - Riding through Ukraine, the ruins become monotonous. They all had stories—a school, an apartment building, a shopping mall. Now, they all blur together in heaps of rubble and rebar.\n\nBut for those living in them, the terror never dulls.\n\n“Now, it’s a lot more scary because we used to hear the sound of artillery, and we hide,” a resident of the northeastern Ukrainian town of Zolochiv said. “Now, we cannot hear anything because it’s just so fast.”\n\nZolochiv is a 40 minute, checkpoint-laden trip north of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city. Just days before we came in mid-May, a missile attack killed a few people in the town’s central courtyard.\n\n“It’s terrifying. You live in constant fear,” the resident said. “Living day by day. There was people driving back home for celebrating one of the holidays and an air alert start sounds. And he just pull over and got hit. That’s how we’re living day by day.”\n\nThe town’s hospital takes in the civilian and military casualties of the war, even as it endures attacks from the air. We travel back to Kharkiv, and as our phones ping, news alerts tell us what—from a hilltop—we see with our own eyes: Smoke columns rising from the city. Missile attacks.\n\nWe rush through traffic and pull up to an apartment complex coursing with chaos.\n\n“I definitely can feel where my heart is because it beating so hard,” Andrey, who lives the struck apartment complex, said. “You can tell people lost their windows, completely blown away all the windows from the strike.”\n\nWe speak with of one those people, a woman wrapped in bandages.\n\n“I was by the window, and all of the sudden, a bunch of glass flew in my direction,” the woman said. “It’s a little bit everywhere deep cuts.”\n\nScorch marks stripe the green space between high rises. No bodies in the twisted metal this time, but plenty of blown eardrums and shattered windows.\n\n“I don’t know what to do now,” the woman said. “I got bandages here a little bit tight, but it’s okay.”\n\nLife above ground in Ukraine is a jungle gym next to a smoldering crater. That’s why some have looked for safety underground.\n\n“There was a 60,000 people or from this city was hiding in a subway,” an education administrator tells us.\n\nMany families fled when Russian bombs started falling, but if everyone did, who would work the land, the factories, the hospitals? So in Kharkiv—just 40 miles from the Russian border—kids needed somewhere to learn.\n\n“We realize we cannot do education on the top,” the education administrator said. “We have to move in the basements or subway.”\n\nLocal leaders revamped existing infrastructure.\n\n“Here was a just transitioning area to the train stations,” the administrator said. “Now, it’s a fully occupied and fully ventilated and equipped for education space for the kids. We have seven classrooms here.”\n\nIt’s hybrid learning—part online, part in person.\n\n“These classes make sure everybody gets a fair chance for education,” the administrator said.\n\nFor in-person instruction, the children come in shifts: one group from 9 to noon, the other from 1 to 4 p.m.\n\n“Social gathering is very important, so they can talk to each other,” the underground school’s director said. “They can communicate, have social interactions.”\n\nThe director says students have everything they need, from desks to books to therapists.\n\n“Look at the kids,” she said. “They’re completely fine. They try to not concentrate on the negative and laugh. Enjoy the education.”\n\nStudents like Iryna—wearing smiles—tell us it wasn’t an easy adjustment, but she learns every day.\n\n“I’m doing fine in the given circumstances,” Iryna said. “Education is very deep, and we try to stay on top of the program.”\n\nSo—no jungle gyms here—at least for now. But it’s a bright space where the next generation blooms beneath the ruins.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our 10/11 NOW daily digest and breaking news alerts delivered straight to your email inbox."
