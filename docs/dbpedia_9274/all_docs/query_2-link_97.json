        "text": "WVU’s Moore Touts Offensive Line Depth\n\nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. – Veteran offensive line coach Matt Moore believes he has more quality players at his disposal than at any time since his arrival here with Neal Brown in 2019.\n\nAnd that's with last year's center Zach Frazier now vying for a starting job with the Pittsburgh Steelers and right guard Doug Nester currently in training camp with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nIt's certainly been a long and arduous process to get to this point.\n\nWhen Brown and Moore took over at WVU, they inherited Colton McKivitz from the previous coaching staff, but were left with gaps, unbalanced classes and literally no depth whatsoever.\n\nEach year, they have added pieces either through the transfer portal or through high school recruiting, and today, Moore is now working with essentially two competent, capable units.\n\nPresently, his first five consists of left tackle Wyatt Milum, left guard Tomas Rimac, center Brandon Yates, right guard Ja'Quay Hubbard and right tackle Nick Malone.\n\nThe second group is comprised of left tackle Johnny Williams IV, left guard Sullivan Weidman, center Landen Livingston, right guard Nick Krahe and right tackle Xavier Bausley. Also getting work with the twos are junior Bryce Biggs, who can play both guard positions, and redshirt freshman Cooper Young, who can play either guard or center.\n\nMoore has two promising true freshmen that he really likes, too, in tackle Lucas Austin and guard Justin Terry, not to mention injured Kyle Altuner, whom he expects to get back at some point this season.\n\nThere was a time in the not-too-distant past when Moore really struggled to come up with six players that he was comfortable putting into a game. Even last year, when West Virginia had the third-best power conference rushing attack in the country, the Mountaineers were doing it with basically seven offensive linemen getting all the reps.\n\nFrazier led the way with 804 snaps, followed by Yates (793), Milum (753), Rimac (689) and Nester (660). Backups Hubbard (432) and Malone (390) were the others to see significant action.\n\nWhen you consider an average Big 12 game last year consisted of roughly 64 plays, that means each starter played what amounts to 10 full games on average, with Frazier averaging out to 12½ full games.\n\nMoore admitted earlier this week that he's closer than he's ever been to getting more guys on the field because he finally has the personnel to do so.\n\n\"If you were out there today, you would have no idea who our starting five was because every period I had different guys working together,\" he said. \"It's not just ones and twos, but three of the starters with two of the second-team guys and three of the second-team guys with two starters.\n\n\"Has Hubbard played beside Tomas enough? Has Wyatt played beside Sully enough? Has Landon played in the middle between the starting guards, because you never know,\" he continued. \"Last year, we had seven guys that started different games and you've got to go through camp and make yourself (play more players). The hard part is when you are going against a defense, and you are wanting to win (the play), you want your best five in there. But this is going to make us better down the road. That's when you feel good about having guys you can rotate by series to keep them fresh.\"\n\nWhich means during Saturday's closed scrimmage, Moore is going to do more mixing and matching than usual.\n\n\"I've got to put Landen Livingston in there with the starting group and see what he can do,\" he explained. \"I've got to put Nick Krahe with the starting group to see what he can do. I've got to put Johnny Williams with the starting crew to see what he can do against the best guys. That's when you find out if the bright lights get to them in August in the stadium instead of the first game of the season.\"\n\nHe continued.\n\n\"I feel good about our first two groups, better than I've felt the whole time I've been here as far as having 10 guys that can go out there and function on this level communicating, seeing movement on defense and being able to react the way we want them to,\" Moore noted.\n\nThe left side of West Virginia's offensive line with Milum and Rimac is as good as any left side in the country. Milum, a preseason All-Big 12 choice, is likely to join McKivitz and Frazier in the NFL following this season, with Rimac attracting the interest of pro scouts next year.\n\nYates did a solid job playing center in place of Frazier during last year's Duke's Mayo Bowl victory over North Carolina. Hubbard has worked extremely hard to get into the best shape of his life and Malone has the intelligence and the athleticism to block the Mountaineers' multiple schemes.\n\nAthleticism and versatility are becoming the norm with this group, not the exception.\n\nFor instance, last year, West Virginia rushed for 336 yards against BYU by running mostly outside zone. Two weeks later against Cincinnati, the Bearcats adjusted their defense to defend the outside zone, so the Mountaineers switched to a gap scheme and ended up running for a season-high 424 yards.\n\nIt takes talent and experience to be able to do that.\n\n\"We don't set out saying, 'Hey, this is who we're going to be.' We want to be good at all of them and then when we go into a game, figure out which one is working versus this team,\" Moore explained.\n\n\"Last year, we had to be good at running the ball because we weren't real sure with a new quarterback and we had a bunch of young receivers,\" he added.\n\nMoore said communication and the willingness to strain are the two key elements that he always emphasizes to his linemen. He wants non-emotional, even-keeled players who do the same thing each day.\n\nMoore cited one Pro Football Focus statistic rating his group among the best offensive lines in the country the last two seasons in terms of blocking efficiency. The metric it used was the percentage of unblocked players at the point of attack on each play.\n\n\"You want to move people and knock people back, but what you don't want to do is knock somebody back one time and then turn a guy loose two times,\" he admitted. \"It's about communicating and understanding defenses and getting hats on hats.\n\n\"The second part is straining every snap and understanding to play offensive line, you've got to strain. That's the two things we work on every single day,\" he said.\n\nChanges adopted by the NCAA have allowed more staff personnel to be involved in on-field coaching this season. Moore said he's taken advantage of this by giving more responsibility to Jens Danielson, who works closely with the older players, and Ryan Alexander, who oversees the younger guys.\n\n\"When the younger guys catch up, then we'll move them to a different pile. I think that's why we have enough depth,\" Moore concluded.\n\nWest Virginia has no on-field activities scheduled for today.\n\nThe Mountaineers are slated to have what Neal Brown terms a \"moderate\" practice on Friday morning ahead of Saturday's closed scrimmage inside the stadium.\n\nSeason and mini-season tickets for the 2024 campaign remain on sale through the Mountaineer Ticket Office and can be purchased by calling 1-800-WVU GAME or by logging on to WVUGAME.com."
