        "text": "We’re inviting entrepreneurs and other experts to discuss their ideas with Robin Millar MP and local councillors on how to unleash Llandudno’s potential. The format of the session will be a collaborative, open discussion with ideas being shared and built upon by attendees. We will consider:\n\nHow best can we unleash the full potential of Llandudno, a North Wales coastal resort?\n\nWhat is needed to create an environment that nurtures growth, fosters ambition and attracts new industries/businesses?\n\nWhat should the Member of Parliament for Aberconwy or a local councillor do to help support Llandudno’s local entrepreneurial ecosystem?\n\nExample topics for discussion include:\n\nEntrepreneurial regeneration of seaside resorts\n\nEngendering innovation in hospitality and tourism\n\nDelivering culture change to foster innovation and economic growth\n\nAttracting and building a talented workforce in a coastal town\n\nThe role of colleges, schools and universities in supporting local entrepreneurs\n\nConnecting with investors outside the main local entrepreneurial networks\n\nBusiness support that helps deliver success\n\nBackground\n\nLlandudno\n\nLlandudno is a seaside resort town in Conwy County Borough located on the Creuddyn peninsula on the edge of the Irish Sea. It is the largest seaside resort in Wales and was specifically constructed in the Victorian era as a holiday town. It is situated within easy distance of the Snowdonia National Park – indeed Conwy Borough is often referred to as “where Snowdonia meets the sea”. In the 2011 census, Llandudno had a population of 20,701.\n\nThe town’s attractions include the Promenade, Victorian Pier, Cable Car, Tramway, and includes a recently opened whisky distillery. There are cultural activities with museums, a gallery and a plethora of annual events. It has a major conference centre and theatre – Venue Cymru - which attracts touring drama, musicals, operas etc. There are frequent events held in Llandudno that draw on the culture and history of the area.\n\nLlandudno has over 100 hotels and guesthouses of varying standards and the economy is heavily reliant on the visitor economy with over 35% of the employed population being involved in retail/wholesale or accommodation and food.\n\nMostyn Estates and Llandudno\n\nMostyn Estates Limited is a private limited company which manages the interests of the Mostyn family across North Wales and elsewhere. Their principal areas of activity are their commercial, residential and agricultural holdings within Llandudno, together with its agricultural estates based in Flintshire.\n\nLlandudno was laid out in 1849 by the Mostyn family, who leased most of the plots for development and influenced the building design and uses of the land. Those leases remain extant. Mostyn Estates are involved in promoting the economic well-being of the town and in recent years promoted Mostyn Champneys Retail Park, Parc Llandudno and the town’s Victoria Centre.\n\nProperties which are leased by, or bought from, Mostyn Estates are subject to covenants which allow Mostyn Estates to control the use of the property and also allow them to maintain standards such as repairs and alterations.\n\nConnections\n\nLlandudno is served by a branch railway line which opened in 1858 which is served from the North Wales Coast Railway Line (connected to the West Coast Mainline) at Llandudno Junction.\n\nThe town is served by Arriva Buses Wales with direct services to Rhyl, Bangor and Caernarfon. The links with the Conwy Valley are provided by Arriva on the western side of the river Conwy and Llew Jones (a local company based in Llanrwst) on the Eastern Side. National Express operates direct services from London, Manchester and Liverpool with connections from most UK towns.\n\nThe nearest Airport is Manchester International Airport.\n\nThere is good access to North West England along the M56 and A55. There are good motorway links with the Midlands and the same roads - the M6, M5 and M1 - also make North Wales accessible to the south of England.\n\nIrish Ferries and Stena Line operate regular and high-speed services to Holyhead from Dublin from where there are good transport links to Llandudno.\n\nStandard and Superfast Broadband are currently available in Llandudno but within the county of Conwy only 9.4% of the constituency are able to access gigabit coverage despite the North Wales communications spine, which is available at public sector premises in Llandudno Junction.\n\nEducation and Health\n\nThere is a community Hospital in Llandudno with a limited hours “Minor Injuries” unit, but the nearest general hospitals are in St. Asaph (Ysbyty Glan Clwyd) and Bangor (Ysbyty Bangor).\n\nThere is only one English medium secondary school serving Llandudno. It has nine designated primary schools that feed into the school which range in size and type. Ysgol John Bright has children from two of the most prosperous wards in the town and the two most deprived. All education in Conwy County Borough is conducted bi-lingually.\n\nThere is a Welsh medium secondary school in the Borough which is situated in Penrhyn Bay. Private day and boarding facilities are available within commuting distance; St. David’s College on the outskirts of Llandudno and Rydal Penrhos within the borough.\n\nInteresting Statistics\n\nThe median house price in Llandudno is £189,300 (Dec.2020) an annual increase of 10.7%. The population educated to NQF 4 is 35.9% (2020).\n\nRobin Millar\n\nRobin Millar is the MP for Aberconwy. He was born and educated in Bangor, North Wales. He graduated from the University of Manchester as a Civil Engineer and worked in Cambridge, Russia, the Netherlands before leaving engineering to establish an independent management consultancy.\n\nRobin’s consultancy specialised in developing public sector/community responses to social problems (post Croydon riots) and improving health care outcomes in deprived areas of the United Kingdom. Alongside his professional career Robin was elected to local government over 20 years ago and has been a Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member on two councils. In the last two years before Robin entered parliament, he was appointed as an interim CEO to a professional organisation where he turned around profits, revenues, membership and introduced wide ranging reforms to governance, operations and member development programs.\n\nHe was selected as the Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Aberconwy in November 2019 and elected in December 2019.\n\nSince entering Parliament, Robin has set up one of the largest backbench Conservative Groups, CURU, which focuses on strengthening the United Kingdom. This group has played an active role in strengthening “the Union”, including setting up a research company and building links with the Lords, devolved administrations and independent groups.\n\nAs part of his community commitment Robin has, alongside his professional career, started an assisted reading programme in local schools and is co-founder of a small charity investing in young people.\n\nRobin is proactive in politics and active in his personal life enjoying taking part in triathlons, trail running and together with his wife Bonny, a leading veterinary nurse, they enjoy walking their dog in the spectacular countryside of Aberconwy.\n\nEmail events@tenentrepreneurs.org to enquire about a place."
