        "text": "For more than 40 years, I’ve called Casper home. I raised my family there and all three of my children are proud graduates of the Natrona County School District. During my 24 years as an orthopedic surgeon in Casper, I served as President of the Wyoming Medical Society and was named Wyoming Physician of the Year. I’ve had decades of experience caring for patients and families across Wyoming.\n\nBefore serving in the U.S. Senate, I represented Natrona County in the Wyoming State Senate. The Wyoming Legislature trained me to effectively represent the interests and advocate for the issues that matter most to our state.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, I’m proud of my strong, conservative record that puts Wyoming first. I serve on committees that directly impact our state’s energy industry, public lands, national parks, and trade. With my leadership positions, I’ve successfully promoted Wyoming’s economy and natural resources, strengthened our national security, cut wasteful Washington spending, and fought against overreaching regulations.\n\nThere is more work to be done. If re-elected, I will continue to fight for Wyoming every day.\n\nMy priority is the people of Wyoming and helping them create a better future. Whether it is coal, oil, or natural gas, Wyoming’s energy powers the nation. The Biden-Harris administration has declared war on American energy. They’ve put in place barriers and restrictions to stop energy production and development. It is hurting our economy and jobs in Wyoming. In the Senate, I’m working on federal legislation to strike Washington’s stifling energy regulations and to expedite the federal permitting process.\n\nIn Wyoming, our livelihoods depend on preserving the health of our federal lands. Wyoming landowners and leaseholders have proven to be the best stewards of the land. Despite our incredible track record, the Biden-Harris administration continues to roll out rules and plans aimed at turning Wyoming’s federal lands from “multiple-use” to “non-use.” We depend on access to these lands for energy and mineral production, grazing, and recreation. I’m leading the fight to stop this attack on our Wyoming way of life.\n\nI’ll continue to do everything in my power to roll back the harmful rules and regulations that are blocking access to our federal lands and energy production across Wyoming.\n\nThe open border policies of the Biden-Harris administration have turned every state into a border state, including Wyoming. Increased drug trafficking has contributed to fentanyl overdose deaths in Wyoming — doubling the number from five years ago. Criminals, including terrorists, are flooding across our southern border. It’s unacceptable.\n\nFirst and foremost, we need a president who will enforce the immigration laws already on the books. We need to focus on solutions that will stop the flood of illegal immigrants and make our communities safer. That starts with building the wall, ending the outrageous catch-and-release program, and bringing back the Remain in Mexico policy.\n\nIn the Senate, I’ve co-sponsored legislation called the “Secure the Border Act.” It restarts construction of a border wall, tightens asylum standards, criminalizes visa overstays and increases the number of Border Patrol Agents. We must secure our borders and secure our nation.\n\nRural health clinics and frontier hospitals across Wyoming work hard every day to provide our rural communities with primary care close to home. I am committed to helping to ensure all patients receive high-quality care.\n\nAs a doctor and co-chairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, one of my top priorities is improving access to health care in communities across our state. Rural health clinics in\n\nWyoming have faced outdated and burdensome regulations for far too long. That’s why I introduced bipartisan legislation to modernize the 30-year-old law governing rural health clinics across the country. It would provide rural clinics with guidance regarding the use of nurse practitioners and physician assistants, improve the ability of rural health clinics to provide mental health services, and remove outdated lab requirements.\n\nIn Wyoming, we face many difficult challenges and I am committed to finding solutions. I am focused on eliminating barriers, diversifying our economy, and increasing opportunities for folks in Wyoming. I will always stand up for Wyoming values, protect our freedom, and uphold the foundation of our country.\n\nDespite the challenges ahead, I’m more excited about Wyoming’s future than I have ever been. Our state has a strong and dedicated workforce, an incredible energy industry that powers America, and an education system that provides the next generation with a solid foundation. We have a rich history and a bright future.\n\n–Senator John Barrasso"
