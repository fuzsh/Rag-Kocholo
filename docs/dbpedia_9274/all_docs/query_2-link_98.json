        "text": "More than 40 classic and modern classic novels are among the almost 3,400 books removed from Iowa school shelves because of Senate File 496.\n\nAmong them: George Orwell's \"1984,\" \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley, “Their Eyes Were Watching God” by Zora Neale Hurston, \"The Kite Runner\" by Khaled Hosseini, “Friday Night Lights” by Buzz Bissinger, \"A Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde and the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel “Maus” by Art Spiegelman.\n\nThe loss of classic books because of bans can hurt students, robbing them of the chance to hear diverse ideas and voices, experts and education advocates told the Register.\n\nPart of the Register's Iowa's Book Ban Battle series.\n\nFor more than 15 years, Shannon Dykstra has been assigning juniors in his advanced American literature class at Mason City Community School District to read \"The Color Purple\" by Alice Walker.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Celie, a young Black girl who writes letters to her sister and to God, delves into intense subjects such as her rape by a man she believes was her biological father, her subsequent pregnancies, her forced marriage and her exploration of her sexuality.\n\nTo Dykstra, a longtime English teacher, the novel explores emotional themes surrounding sexuality, incest and family that consistently evoke deep and thoughtful discussions among his students.\n\n\"I've taught for 22 years, and for whatever reason, I don't have a book that is so universally mentioned among students at the end of the year as having such a great impact,\" he said. \"And I say that talking about a range of students, students whose worldview do not align at all … For whatever reason, that book has produced such rich discussions and has been one of the more memorable reads and classroom experiences for students.\"\n\nBut in more than two-dozen Iowa school districts, students can no longer read Walker's modern classic. School administrators have removed the book in response to Senate File 496, a sweeping education law passed last year that bans novels describing or depicting sexual acts as spelled out in state law.\n\nMason City was among the districts that pulled \"The Color Purple,\" only to later return it after a federal judge issued an injunction in a lawsuit challenging the law. A federal appeals court on Friday lifted that injunction, meaning Mason City could again decide to ban \"The Color Purple\" from its shelves.\n\nIt's not the only classic being removed in Iowa.\n\nAn exclusive Des Moines Register survey of Iowa's 325 public school districts found more than 40 classic and modern classic novels among the almost 3,400 books removed from school shelves because of SF 496.\n\nAmong them: George Orwell's \"1984,\" \"Brave New World\" by Aldous Huxley, “Their Eyes Were Watching God” by Zora Neale Hurston, \"The Kite Runner\" by Khaled Hosseini, “Friday Night Lights” by Buzz Bissinger, \"A Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde and the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel “Maus” by Art Spiegelman.\n\n“Honestly, as a teacher … every day something unexpected happens and you have to be ready to pivot,\" Dykstra said. \"And after 22 years, that's just the deal. Sometimes, situations are out of your control.\"\n\nNow that the injunction has been lifted, Dykstra is waiting to hear how Mason City school leaders plan to proceed before deciding whether “The Color Purple” will need to be replaced.\n\nIf the book is removed, he worries this year’s students will see the quality of their education harmed by not being able to have the same experiences and conversations as his previous students.\n\n“My initial feeling is frustration for this year’s students if they are to be sacrificed for this (law),” he said.\n\nThe loss of classic books because of bans can hurt students, robbing them of the chance to hear diverse ideas and voices, experts and education advocates told the Register. They expressed concern that many of the banned classics were written by Black authors such as Walker, Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou and Alex Haley.\n\n\"A good majority of those are from characters or points of view of people of color or underrepresented folks,\" said Coy Marquardt, the Iowa State Education Association's executive director and a former teacher. \"And that's very troubling and alarming.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers who passed SF 496 say they are simply trying to keep age-inappropriate books out of the hands of children. They accuse educators of purposely misinterpreting the law, particularly when it comes to removing classics.\n\n\"I think the problem that I've been seeing is there are people who are not operating in good faith,\" said Rep. Jeff Shipley, R-Birmingham, \"… and they're including the benign titles just to confuse and obfuscate the issue.”\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds believes school administrators and staff are acting in the best interests of their students.\n\n\"Whether or not a book is removed from schools is left up to the school administration’s judgment,\" Reynolds said in a statement. \"There is no list of banned books in the law that schools are expected or required to follow. I trust Iowa educators are making decisions they feel are best to safeguard their students.\"\n\n'Huckleberry Finn' was out; 'Beloved' was in – until the book ban\n\nWhat is considered a classic is subjective and ever changing.\n\nLoren Glass, chair of the University of Iowa's English department, focuses in his research and teaching on 20th and 21st century U.S. literature, including publishers and books that faced censorship challenges under obscenity laws.\n\nGlass said the idea of a \"modern classic\" was developed by lawyers and publishers from the 1930s to 1960s in part to get around legal prohibitions on obscenity. Books such as \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce that were put on trial in those years are now being removed from shelves because of SF 496.\n\n\"'Classics' were seen as potential exceptions to censorship,\" he said.\n\nRelated: These 5 graphics show the impact of 3,400 books banned from Iowa schools\n\nGlass said there's room for evolution in how people collectively value works traditionally described as classics, such as \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" by Mark Twain, which used to be widely taught in high schools and colleges but has fallen into disfavor because it uses language that now is condemned as racist slurs.\n\n\"'Huckleberry Finn' is probably not the best book to teach young people about race relations. It is a classic, and I would never ban it — people should read it and study it in college, and if you love Mark Twain, by all means read that,\" he said.\n\nHe said works by Toni Morrison — an American novelist who was Black and female — have to an extent become substitutes for Twain's \"Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\nBut those books, too, have run afoul of SF 496. Works by Morrison including \"Beloved,\" \"The Bluest Eye\" and \"Song of Solomon\" had been removed nearly 80 times by Iowa school districts and were rarely reshelved after the injunction, according to a Register survey.\n\nOne reason literature is banned is fear, said Alex Gino, the author of \"Melissa,\" a book about a fictional fourth-grade transgender girl trying to come out to her family and friends — and one of the most challenged children's books in the U.S.\n\nFrom May 2023: The author of one of America's most challenged kids books says 'trans people are unsafe'\n\n\"I don't like withholding literature from anyone because of fears that they might learn about the world,\" Gino said. \"I think that the books that are currently being banned always say something about what our culture is currently afraid of. And so those (classic) books that were … banned tell us what people had been afraid of in the past, and some of them are definitely still the things that we're afraid of.\"\n\nGino pointed out that the classic 1970 Judy Blume book \"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret\" talks about menstruation and was very controversial at the time. It remains controversial enough to be banned twice during the 2023-24 school year by Iowa schools.\n\nNow, the focus increasingly is on \"queer identities and Black identities and racism,\" Gino said.\n\nFrom May 2023: Dozens of books are being challenged in Iowa schools. Here's the ones targeted most often:\n\nSex in '1984' not graphic enough to be banned, law's authors say\n\nLawmakers insist they never intended for classic books such as “1984” to be caught up in the law.\n\nSenate Education Committee Chair Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, has said he reread Orwell's best-known novel during the legislative session to ensure the law wouldn't catch up books like the classic dystopian novel.\n\n\"I very clearly know how much we worked on the specific language … 'prohibiting the depiction or description of sex acts’ and '1984' never met that definition, never did,\" Rozenboom said in a May interview. \"And to this day, I remain puzzled what the rationale was\" for educators removing it.\n\nThe 1949 novel centers on an authoritarian state that censors information. It also contains sexual content: Main characters Julia and Winston talk about and later have sex. Within the first 20 pages of the book, Winston also fantasizes about having sex with Julia and then killing her.\n\nWhether the sex scenes in “1984” and other contested books such as \"Gender Queer\" by Maia Kobabe are in violation of SF 496 rests on how detailed those scenes are, Shipley said.\n\n“Winston's fantasizing about rape and having sex in and of itself is not a violation of the law,” Shipley insisted of \"1984.\" “But if you said, ‘OK, I'm going to choke her and insert my penis into the vagina and I'm going to ejaculate,’ I think the main thing in the law was describing the actual penetration or the ejaculatory function or any of that type of sodomy. I think, that was kind of the line. So, the law did put forth, in my opinion, a pretty bright clear red line.”\n\nIowa joins states such as Florida and Texas that have seen classic novels removed from schools under legislation that restricts the types of books allowed.\n\nLike SF 496, a number of those laws are caught up in ongoing federal court cases, in part because judges have found them too vague, said Ann David, chair of the National Council of Teachers of English's Standing Committee Against Censorship.\n\n“These are not well written laws, and because they are not well written, that also is a challenge for administrators,” said David, an associate professor at the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio.\n\nTo say educators are going too far is specious, she contends.\n\n\"No, they're following the letter of the law,” even when the rules are unclear, David said.\n\nIowa opponents of the bill say they warned lawmakers the classics could be affected if SF 496 passed.\n\n\"I guess they should be more careful about the way they write laws, because if this had unintended consequences, people tried to tell them what consequences this would have,\" former Perry Community School District librarian Mari Butler Abry said earlier this year in an interview, \"and the lawmakers didn't listen.\"\n\nButler Abry is a plaintiff in one of two federal court cases challenging SF 496.\n\nShipley acknowledges there likely are classic books with literary value being removed because they contain detailed sex acts. Senate File 496 does not allow school officials to consider the merits of a book or movie, he said, and it might need to be tweaked.\n\n“We do need to somehow create a way where we can evaluate these texts and get a clear test,\" Shipley said. \"Basically, the state of Iowa can expand and clarify the Miller test, to see how we would work on a case-by-case basis.”\n\nThe Miller test or three-pronged obscenity test is named after the United States Supreme Court case Miller v. California and is used to determine whether a form of expression can be considered obscene.\n\nThe three criteria are:\n\nWhether the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find the matter, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interests.\n\nWhether it depicts or describes sexual conduct in a patently offensive way.\n\nAnd whether it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nThe banning of books like \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm\" in Iowa \"is both laughable and contemptible,\" said Bill Hamilton, the literary executor of the Orwell estate in a statement to the Register. \"Animal Farm\" was removed from shelves in two districts.\n\n\"Laughable because these books are the clearest fictional accounts of the dangers of the suppression of freedom of thought, so the irony of banning them is overwhelming,\" Hamilton said. \"And contemptible because the instinct to ban books is the first sign of totalitarianism, and that has no place in the U.S. or any democracy: It’s a sign of cultural bankruptcy, a fear of thinking itself.\"\n\nCutting diverse books viewed as removing memories, history\n\nThe first time Jackson State University Associate Professor of English Candice Love Jackson visited Iowa, lawmakers she met with spoke often about how proud they were that Iowa abolished slavery in 1846, long before the practice was abolished nationally in 1865.\n\nLaws such as SF 496 seem to be turning the tide and undoing a lot of goodwill built up over the years, Jackson said.\n\n\"It's fascinating to hear that a state that prides itself on having slavery outlawed to become a state in 1846 is now practicing some of the discriminatory and hyper-racist and dogmatic policies that have plagued this nation since the beginning,\" she said.\n\nRepresentation in books and other media helps to heal trauma, Jackson said. She noted \"Roots\" by Haley and Morrison's \"Beloved\" were among the books that tell fictionalized versions of real events and people.\n\n\"Roots\" was removed twice from Iowa schools because of SF 496 and never reshelved, according to Register data.\n\nRemoving these texts means you are not just banning the text but the memories and history they evoke, she said.\n\n\"Not wanting to have hard conversations about race, racism, sexism (and) discrimination doesn't mean it doesn't exist,\" Jackson said.\n\n\"Beloved\" includes a scene where Sethe, one of the main characters, talks about how her milk was stolen, a reference to mammary rape.\n\n\"That sort of sexual abuse of Black women by white men, it happened, it is documented in the history, but ‘Beloved’ it's just a fictionalized report of a real story,\" Jackson said.\n\nA diverse canon of classic books is a \"valid way for young people to learn the history both of their culture and the various cultures that have made the country and the world what it is,\" Glass said.\n\nAnd classics that large numbers of people across the country read while they're in school become \"common currency, common language, common points of reference that then become part of conversation, discussion, contemplation for the rest of your life.\"\n\nRelated: Iowa Board of Education passes new rules on gender identity in schools. What to know:\n\nSilent reading: How to teach books where sex moves the story\n\nAcross the state, English teachers have navigated for decades how to teach novels that feature sex in cases where they felt a book would help students expand their worldview or learn about diverse experiences.\n\nEducators told the Register that students are not reading scenes about rape or depictions of sex out loud in class. In fact, some even tell students they can skip passages or chapters that make them uncomfortable. Schools also give parents the option of having their children read alternative books.\n\nDes Moines Public Schools English teacher Andy Sutton and Dykstra said they talk to students about what they will encounter in books.\n\nKids are more mature than people give them credit for, Dykstra said.\n\n\"They're not in it (to read about sex); they want a literary experience, and sex is a part of the themes,\" he said. \"And it's a reality in the book, but it's just a piece of a larger whole. And honestly students don't get stuck. They don't get fixated on just that singular aspect.\"\n\nOne of the themes the class explores is family, Dykstra said.\n\nFor several years, Sutton taught \"The Kite Runner\" to seniors and would talk with them ahead of time about what they would encounter in the book. She always gave them the option of skipping the chapter where Hassan, the main family's young servant, is raped by an older boy for refusing to give up a kite he caught.\n\nThe book was removed 52 times under the new education law and later reshelved in 14 districts after the injunction.\n\n\"I find that the one area of the world that my kids know absolutely nothing about is the Middle East,\" she said. \"All they get is what they're told on the news, and we know that depending on the news source, they might be getting truth (or) they might be getting an embellishment.\"\n\nThough Des Moines schools have now standardized which books teachers use, Sutton, if given the chance, would like to continue teaching the book.\n\n“The minute I heard of this bill coming out, I knew that would be a book that goes away,” Sutton said.\n\nShe hopes the state will give schools clear guidance on how to navigate the law now that the injunction has been lifted.\n\n“I think there needs to be very direct clarification from the state house that explicitly says they are not trying to target LGBTQ themes and topics for the upper grades that it is just simply about sex acts as described in Iowa code,” she said.\n\nAs a parent, Hosseini told the Register in a statement that he understands \"the parental impulse to safeguard our children from harm. But banning books like 'The Kite Runner' doesn’t ‘protect’ students at all. It betrays them instead. It robs them of the chance that we as parents and instructors owe them, the chance to broaden their human community, to let them walk the world in another’s shoes for a while, to foster empathy for others, to be challenged by the experience and perhaps take a small step toward becoming fuller, richer versions of themselves.\"\n\nWhether Iowa teachers will be able to continue to teach books such as \"The Kite Runner\" or \"The Color Purple\" rests in the hands of the federal courts.\n\nBut for teachers like Dykstra, the underlying issue feels more like politics than education.\n\n\"Frankly, it feels a lot like we're not protecting students; we're instead using them as victims to this political wedge issue,\" he said.\n\nReporter Chris Higgins contributed to this story.\n\nSamantha Hernandez covers education for the Register.
