This group of young people have overcome adversity and challenge in the most difficult of circumstances showing resilience at its very best in unprecedented times. They have also clearly demonstrated a great level of maturity which will serve them very well in the next phase of their lives. We are all very proud of the hard work that our learners have put into their studies and are delighted with their achievements and wish them the very best for their future at university or the world of work.\n\nWe would also like to thank our dedicated staff for guiding our learners though this turbulent time, preparing them for their A level exams. We thank our parents, communities and governors for their support in ensuring the achievements and success of all our pupils.\n\nWell done, Year 13, and all the best for your future successes!\n\nAt Ysgol John Bright we're thrilled that 30% of all grades awarded were A* or A with two thirds of our students gaining at least one A grade. Notable successes included Rhys Boulton and Quinn Doherty, both gaining 4A*, with Roma Sharif gaining 3A* and an A, and Callum Thomas 3A*. Virtually all YJB students gained their first choice offer to study at university this autumn, which is a tremendous achievement. Some of the courses included History and Politics at Nottingham, Law at University of York, Pharmacy at University of Nottingham, Earth Sciences at University of Durham, Civil Engineering at University of Manchester and Psychology and Criminology at Birmingham to name but a few. Rose is starting an Apprenticeship with Amazon and Matej is fulfilling his wish to join the RAF."
