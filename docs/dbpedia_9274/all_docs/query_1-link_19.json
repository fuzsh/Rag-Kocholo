The closure affects pupils at Ysgol John Bright in Llandudno.\n\nIt is unclear how long the 1,147-pupil school on Maesdu Road will be closed for. Conwy County Borough Council has said it will issue an update once it has more information.\n\nThe school said on its Ysgol John Bright Facebook page at about 8am: \"SCHOOL IS CLOSED TO STUDENTS TODAY. Unfortunately due to flooding in the school building overnight, the school will be closed to students all day on the grounds of health and safety.\n\nRead more: World's deepest hotel, zoo and steam railway named among North Wales tourism champions\n\nRead more: Identical twins with telepathic bond reunite after years apart to launch 'dream' venture on North Wales coast\n\n\"We apologise for the inconvenience and we will update you later today when we know more and have had time to fully assess the situation.\" Ysgol John Bright was on a site on Oxford Road in the town from 1907 to 2004.\n\nThen that land was used for an Asda store and the school was rebuilt in its present location, opening in September 2004 in a private finance initiative."
