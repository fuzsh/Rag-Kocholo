        "text": "More than 1,000 pupils go to Ysgol John Bright\n\nControversial plans to build a school on a former toxic waste dump in Llandudno have been backed by an independent expert.\n\nBut the consultant, from the University of Nottingham, says further tests will still be needed ensure the clean-up of the site is effective.\n\nWhen the Welsh Assembly Government gave the go-ahead for the new school, a replacement for Llandudno's aging Ysgol John Bright, it called for safeguards to ensure children's health was not going to be put at risk.\n\nThis report is part of that process.\n\nWhilst it criticises the way previous risk assessments of the site were carried out, it concludes that the planned clean-up will probably be adequate.\n\nThe consultant Dr Paul Nathanail does though call for the remediation work to be tested before the new school opens.\n\nIf the aim of commissioning this report was to allay some parents fears then its failed.\n\nTests\n\nThey are concerned that some toxic material will be left on the site.\n\nAt a public meeting in the school on Tuesday night, parents heard that although some toxic chemical would remain, the clean-up was probably adequate, although further tests would be needed.\n\nThe meeting also allowed parents to put questions to public health expert Dr Richard Roberts.\n\nWork to reclaim the Maesdu Road site for the new private finance initiative (PFI) Â£25m school has already started.\n\nDr Roberts gave a brief outline on the involvement of the North Wales Health Authority.\n\nTime is pressing for a replacement school for Ysgol John Bright pupils.\n\nBuildings\n\nIn the 2002/03 school year there are 1,137 youngsters at the town centre school.\n\nStaff and pupils have to use portable buildings and much of the school is old.\n\nYsgol John Bright draws pupils from the Llandudno, Craig-y-don and Penrhyn Bay areas."
