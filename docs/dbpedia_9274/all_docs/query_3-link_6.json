        "text": "Ysgol John Bright is situated in the heart of the North Wales resort town of Llandudno. It is the only English medium high school to serve the town and its hinterland.\n\nThe school is named after the Victorian radical politician John Bright who came to the town for respite and whose young son was buried here.\n\nAfter almost one hundred years the school had outgrown its previous premises and in September 2004 the new school opened on a 25 acre site with excellent facilities.\n\nIt was built as part of a PFI project and a facilities management company handles caretaking, cleaning and catering."
