Ysgol John Bright is a secondary school on Maesdu Road, Llandudno in Conwy County Borough, Wales. It was founded with money and support from the social reformer John Bright, whose son died in Llandudno in 1864. Until 1969 the school was a selective grammar school known as John Bright Grammar School (JBGS). It reopened in September 1969 as a comprehensive and with a new name – Ysgol John Bright. ("Ysgol" is Welsh for "school") The school serves the state secondary education sector in the Llandudno area and has around 1200 pupils. The current headteacher is Hywel Parry.

The first John Bright school first opened in February 1896 in temporary premises – now the Risboro Hotel. It was bought for £567 and had 62 pupils. By 1905, there were nearly 80 pupils and 5 teachers. It had five classrooms and specialist rooms for cookery, music, art and woodwork, physics and science. The headmaster was J.M. Archer-Thomson, a leading Welsh mountaineer.
