Our unique rating system takes into account a range of different indicators to evaluate a school's performance. The system tracks achievement, attendance, progress, school finances, and whether it is improving.

Data may be missing for some indicators because it has not been published. This may be because the school is new or because it is very small so data has been suppressed to avoid identifying individual pupils. Schools do not lose points for missing data, so will still fare better in the ranking than schools that underperform on that indicator, but they cannot score as highly as schools that perform well on the indicator.

Estyn has given Ysgol John Bright an overall performance rating of Good.

Estyn began a new inspection round in September 2017, so only some schools have been inspected using the new criteria.

How does the Welsh Government rate this school?

The National School Categorisation System was introduced in 2014 to replace Banding as a way of assessing schools.

The system is based on a three-step process:

Step 1: a range of performance information is used by the school to self-evaluate its capacity to improve in relation to teaching and learning. As of 2017, the Welsh Government no longer calculates or publishes standards groups.

Step 2: an evaluation of the school's capacity to improve further, taking account of the evidence about the standards and the quality of leadership, teaching and learning, resulting in an improvement capacity.

Step 3: using the information from earlier steps to decide on the school's support category, colour coded either green, yellow, amber or red.

Green support category - A highly effective school which is well run, has strong leadership and is clear about its priorities for improvement. These schools have a track record in raising the standards that pupils achieve and have the capacity to support other schools to do better.

Yellow support category - An effective school which is already doing well and knows the areas it needs to improve. By identifying the right support and taking action, it has the potential to do even better.

Amber support category - A school in need of improvement which needs help to identify the steps to improve or to make change happen more quickly. Through discussions with the regional school improvement service and local authority, the school will receive a tailored package of support.

Red support category - A school in need of greatest improvement and will receive immediate, intensive support. Progress will be closely monitored to make sure that the necessary improvements take place as quickly as possible.

For 2017, Ysgol John Bright has been placed in the Red support category. The Welsh Government no longer publishes scores or standards groups.

Categorisation Outcome 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Total Score (lower is better) - - 52 45.3 45 Standards Group - - 2 2 2 Improvement Capacity - - B B A Support Category Red Amber Amber Yellow Green
