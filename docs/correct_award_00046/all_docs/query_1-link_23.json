The Norwegian Nobel Committee confirmed that Mahatma Gandhi was nominated for the Peace Prize in 1937–39, 1947 and a few days before he was assassinated in January 1948.Later members of the Committee expressed regret that he was not given the prize.Geir Lundestad, Secretary of NBC in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106 year history is undoubtedly that Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize. In 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the grounds that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" that year. Later, when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n68.

Discussion Why an Indian scientist hasn’t won the Novel prize in Physics ,Chemistry and Medicine after independence ….!? Science in India has developed a great deal since C.V.Raman particularly after the country gained Independence but we are yet to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry or medicine. Is it a reflection on quality of Indian science? Or It has to do with politics of Nobel prize.\n\n76.  1,500,000,000 people  325 languages spoken  550 Universities and 33,623 Institutions  800 Research Centre and R & D Lab  40,000 Professor  Five year Plan (2002–2007) we spent 438 billion for education  We are publishing 10,000 articles in peer reviewed journals /year\n\n77.
