        "text": "Work\n\nThe biochemical processes that take place within an organism's cells are controlled by the genes found inside DNA molecules. Jacques Monod and François Jacob proved how the genetic information is converted during the formation of proteins by means of a messenger, which proved to the substance we now know as RNA. Different cells work in different ways at different times, however. This too is regulated by genes. In the early 1960s Monod and Jacob mapped the intricate processes that determine how genes are expressed or suppressed in a self-regulating process."
