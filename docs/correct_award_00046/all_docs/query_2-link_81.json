        "text": "TITLE OF THE 2023 HEINZ-NIXDORF LECTURE#\n\n“The brain as a chemical machine: importance of allosteric receptors”#\n\nABSTRACT: The human brain, the most complex organ of the body, cannot be simply regarded as an electrical machine or a mechanical computer. Understanding the chemistry of the brain is a prerequisite for the understanding if its basic functions - from the intercellular communications up to the higher cognitive level - together with their pathological alterations. The billions of neurons in the brain make discontinuous networks that are bound together by chemical signals: the neurotransmitters. There are over a hundred of neurotransmitters that mediate information processing in the brain, and thus, all the operations it performs. The discovery of the molecules and molecular mechanisms involved in the signal transduction elicited by neurotransmitters has thus created a “paradigmatic change” in the history of brain sciences leading to considerable progress in the understanding of drugs action in the brain, their possible side effects and among them drug addiction with its known devastating consequences at the social level, and, most of all, their potential therapeutic action.\n\nAt the early stages, a critical role was played by the concept of allostery to qualify the interaction between topographically distinct sites on regulatory proteins - ie an active site and a regulatory site - and its mediation by a conformational change of the molecule (1961). Through their cooperative organisation, allosteric proteins would behave as “molecular switches” (1965). Early on the concept was extended to brain communications and the receptors for neurotransmitters (1964,1967). Then, the first neurotransmitter receptor was identified (1970): the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It was soon demonstrated to be a bona fide allosteric protein carrying several binding sites for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, an ion channel, together with multiple allosteric modulatory sites. The elucidation, today at the atomic level, of the allosteric mechanism through which drugs modulate receptor efficacy opens revolutionary new avenues in the field of drug discovery.\n\nMoreover, the multiple regulations to which acetylcholine receptors have access – together with thousands of subsequently discovered receptors in the brain – further extends the “paradigmatic change” to neuronal brain circuits in general, to their contribution to the short and long-term synaptic changes (ie those engaged in learning and memory), up to higher cognitive functions and - last but not least – to conscious processing. The consequences in the understanding neuropsychiatric diseases and their therapeutics are immense.\n\nErasmus Medal Citation#\n\nJean-Pierre Changeux has been the leader in the field of receptor research and neuroscience for the past half a century. His thorough dissection of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors is a landmark in modern biology. The extension of the allosteric theory to membrane proteins provided a mechanistic explanation for the process of signal transduction by ligands. It has vast implications in several fields of biology, including receptor biology, cellular communications, drug design and development, and neuroscience. Due to his pioneering and seminal activities, Changeux is one of the key founders of modern molecular pharmacology and neuroscience.\n\nAs a graduate student in the laboratories of Nobel Laureates Jacques Monod and François Jacob, Changeux’s studies provided a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation, the allostery model, with a profound impact on the biology of living organisms. He further proposed that allosteric regulation in membrane receptors plays a key role in the transmission of chemical signals in the nervous system. He hypothesized that the acetylcholine receptor could be envisioned as a membrane macromolecule in which the acetylcholine binding site regulates by an allosteric conformational change, the gating of an ion channel. His subsequent career strategically and comprehensively validated this pioneering insight, resulting in a series of important discoveries.\n\nChangeux’s seminal work on the nicotinic receptor forged new fields of research in signal transduction mechanisms, molecular pharmacology, and pathological modifications of chemical communications in the nervous system, including the subsequent molecular identification of brain ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors. Following Changeux’s pioneering work, the notion that receptor activity is controlled by allosteric mechanisms has been extended to G protein-coupled receptors and growth-factor receptors. It is now well-established that ligand binding triggers an allosteric transition that activate or inhibit the G proteins or activate receptor tyrosine kinases.\n\nSubsequently, Changeux used his knowledge of the nicotinic receptors to investigate higher levels of brain organization, in particular the way these receptors participate in reward and cognition. Moving from the molecules and the isolated neurons or muscle cells to the development of neuronal networks, Jean-Pierre Changeux made an outreaching contribution by proposing the theory that long-term epigenesis of neuronal networks occurs by the selective stabilization and elimination of developing synapses. In parallel, he proposed, with his collaborators, theoretical models for defined cognitive tasks that bridge the gap between molecular biology and cognitive science. In these models, allosteric receptors play a key role in the regulation of synaptic efficacy. Changeux and his colleagues further proposed an original hypothesis describing a neuronal mechanism for conscious access, implicating a “global neuronal workspace” composed of a brain-scale horizontal network of reciprocally connected long axon pyramidal neurons.\n\nFinally, throughout his career, Jean-Pierre Changeux has been concerned by the ethical consequences of neuroscience for medicine and for society in general. He has written a number of books, including the iconic “L’homme neuronal”, which not only reveals his status as a leading contemporary figure in neuroscience but also one of the leading thinkers of our times and a worthy contemporary heir of the French Encyclopaedists of the 18th century.\n\nBased on his distinguished scientific achievements, his contributions to European scientific culture and his commitment to Academia Europaea as one of its founding members (membership number: 63), Academia Europaea is pleased and honoured to award the 2022 Academia Europaea Erasmus Medal to Professor Jean-Pierre Changeux.\n\nGeneral biography#\n\nJean-Pierre Changeux MAE\n\nhttps://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/jean-pierre-changeux\n\nShort synopsis#\n\nProfessor Changeux was elected to the Academia Europaea in 1988 and is one of the founder members.\n\n1) Academic training\n\nEcole Normale Supérieure (rue d'Ulm, Paris) (1955) and Licence de Sciences Naturelles (1956, 1957) at Paris University.
