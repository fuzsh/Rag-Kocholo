        "text": "It is of great interest to all microbiology/biomedical students to know about microbiologists and their contribution for which they received Nobel prize. The Nobel Prize is the highest honor that a scientist can receive.\n\nIf we see the list of Nobel prize winners since the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 1901, we can find many microbiologists receiving this Nobel Prize.\n\nIn this article, we are looking back and seeing microbiologists who have won a Nobel Prize. Some of the people who have won Nobel prize in the field of microbiology or immunology, may not be a microbiologist but maybe a physician or biochemist, etc who have contributed in this field.\n\nThe following lists of Nobel Prizes that have been awarded to microbiologists gives outlines the progress of microbiology, molecular biology and Immunology in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\n1901 Emil Adolph Von Behring: Developed serum treatment, especially in diphtheria, and got Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1901.\n\n1902 Sir Ronald Ross: Discovered the life cycle of the malaria parasites in humans and mosquitoes thereby has laid the foundation for successful research on this disease and methods of combating it.\n\n1905 Robert Koch: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905 was awarded to Robert Koch “for his investigations and discoveries in relation to tuberculosis“.\n\n1907 Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran: Showed that the mosquito is the agent of transmission for malaria and the identification of the malaria parasite.\n\n1908 Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov ((Elie Metchnikoff; Father of Natural Immunity), Paul Ehrlich: Studied immune reactions and phagocytic cells.\n\n1912 Alexis Carrel: Developed organ and blood vessel transplantation.\n\n1913 Charles Robert Richet: Discovered and treated anaphylactic shock.\n\n1919 Jules Bordet: Made fundamental discoveries in immunity.\n\n1927 Julius Wagner- Jauregg: Used malaria (malariotherapy) to treat late-stage syphilis.\n\n1928 Charles Nicolle: Made fundamental discoveries epidemic typhus is transmitted by lice.\n\n1930 Karl Landsteiner: Discovered the ABO human blood groups.\n\n1939 Gerhard Domagk: Discovered sulfa drugs.\n\n1945 Sir Alexander Fleming Sir E.

Waksman “for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis”. Selman A. Waksman Discovered streptomycin\n\n1953: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1953 was divided equally between Hans Adolf Krebs “for his discovery of the citric acid cycle” and Fritz Albert Lipmann “for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism”.\n\n1954 The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1954 was awarded jointly to John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins “for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue” and for making polio vaccine possible\n\n1957 Daniel Bovet: Developed antihistamines and synthetic curare-like agents.\n\n1958 The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1958 was divided, one half jointly to George Wells Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum “for their discovery that genes act by regulating definite chemical events” and the other half to Joshua Lederberg “for his discoveries concerning genetic recombination and the organization of the genetic material of bacteria”.\n\n1959 Severo Ochoa Arthur Kornberg: Made fundamental discoveries on the synthesis of DNA and RNA.\n\n1960 F. M. Burnet Peter B. Medawar: Discovered the basis of acquired immunological tolerance.\n\n1962 F. H. C. Crick J. D. Watson H. F. Wilkins elucidated the molecular structure of DNA, The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962 was awarded jointly to Francis Harry Compton Crick, James Dewey Watson and Maurice Hugh Frederick Wilkins “for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material”.\n\n1965 : The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1965 was awarded jointly to François Jacob, André Lwoff, and Jacques Monod “for their discoveries concerning genetic control of enzyme and virus synthesis”.\n\n1966 Charles B. Huggins Francis Peyton Rous: Studied the role of hormones in causing cancer; demonstrated that viruses can cause cancer in animals\n\n1969 M. Delbruck A. D. Hershey S. E.

O. Smith Werner Arber: Used restriction enzymes to map viral genomes.\n\n1980 Baruj Benacerraf George Snell Jean Dausse Paul Berg Walter Gilbert Frederick Sanger: Made fundamental contributions to the biochemistry of recombinant DNA Made fundamental contributions on the sequencing of DNA Studied genetically determined structures in the cell surface that regulate immunological reactions\n\n1983 Barbara McClintock: Discovered mobile genetic elements (transposons)\n\n1984 Cesar Milstein Georges J. F. Koehler Niels Jerne. Developed a method to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibodies\n\n1987 Susumu Tonegawa. Discovered the genetic basis of antibody diversity\n\n1988 J. Deisenhofer R. Huber H. Michel. Described the structure of photosynthetic reaction center in bacteria\n\n1989 J. M. Bishop H. E. Varmus. Discovered the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes, the proto-oncogenes\n\n1990 Joseph E. Murray E. Donnall Thomas. Advanced understanding of organ and cell transplantation in the treatment of human disease\n\n1993 Michael Smith Developed a technique for generating site-specific mutants\n\n1993: Kary Mullis has invented the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique in 1980s. The PCR technique was a breakthrough in our ability to detect tiny amounts of DNA and then amplify them into sufficient quantities. For this invention, Kary Mullis won Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 along with Michael Smith.\n\n1996 Peter C. Doherty, Rolf M.

Beutler Jules A. Hoffmann Ralph M. Steinman Discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity discovered the role of dendritic cells in adaptive immunity.\n\n2015: One half jointly to William C. Campbell and Satoshi Ōmura “for their discoveries concerning a novel therapy against infections caused by roundworm parasites” and the other half to Tu Youyou “for her discoveries concerning a novel therapy against Malaria.”\n\n2018: Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2018) was jointly awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation. James P. Allison found that T-cell proteinCTLA-4 functions as a brake on T cells. Tasuku Honjo discovered PD-1, another protein expressed on the surface of T-cells. He found that PD-1 similar to CTLA-4, functions as a T-cell brake, but operates by a different mechanism.\n\n2020: Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine-2020 was jointly given to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice for the discovery of Hepatitis C virus."
