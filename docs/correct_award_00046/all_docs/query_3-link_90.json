As World War II swept Europe, he abandoned medical school and worked with the French resistance in London. He later joined the French Army, serving as a medical officer in combat at Fezzan, Libya, Tripolitania, Tunisia, and at the battle of Normandy, where his hands were severely injured. He was given France's highest WWII honor, the Croix de la Libération.\n\nJacob's injuries precluded his planned career as a surgeon, and he instead became a research biologist. Jacob and Jacques Monod were the first scientists to propose the operon theory, which describes how the E. coli bacterium represses production of enzymes involved in lactose metabolism when lactose is not available. For his investigation of cell physiology and gene structure, Jacob was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1965, sharing the honor with his colleagues Monod and André Lwoff.\n\nFather: Simon Jacob (merchant)\n\nMother: Thérèse Franck Jacob\n\nWife: Lise Bloch Jacob (concert pianist)\n\nSon: Pierre Jacob (philosopher, b. 1949)\n\nSon: Laurent Jacob (biologist, b. 1952)\n\nDaughter: Odile Jacob (b. 1952)\n\nSon: Henri Jacob (b. 1954)\n\nHigh School: Lycée Carnot, Paris, France (1938)\n\nMedical School: MD, University of Paris (1947)\n\nUniversity: MS Biology, University of Paris (1951)\n\nUniversity: PhD Biology, Sorbonne (1954)\n\nScholar: Cellular Genetics, Pasteur Institute in Paris (1950-64)\n\nProfessor: Cellular Genetics, Collège de France (1964-)\n\nNobel Prize for Medicine 1965 (with André Lwoff and Jacques Monod)\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences 1964\n\nAmerican Philosophical Society 1969\n\nNational Academy of Sciences 1969\n\nRoyal Society\n\nFrench Ancestry\n\nJewish Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nSexuality and the Genetics of Bacteria (1961, with Elie Wollmann)\n\nThe Logic of Life: A History of Heredity (1974)\n\nThe Possible & The Actual (1982)\n\nThe Statue Within: An Autobiography (1987)\n\nOf Flies, Mice and Men (1998)\n\nLe Siècle du Gène (2003, with Stéphane Schmitt)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with François Jacob\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
