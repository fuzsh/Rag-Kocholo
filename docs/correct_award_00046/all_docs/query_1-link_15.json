        "text": "Seymour Benzer is also a really extraordinary person. Seymour came over for a year, quite early on, soon after I arrived at Pasteur. We were in the same lab. And for more or less a year, he arrived in the morning, said, 'Hi!', and we didn't hear from him all day. And in the evening, he would say, 'Bye!' That's all we would hear from him all day. But he was surprising. Because he's a guy who... so you talk to him, you ask him a question, no answer, he doesn't say anything. And then, four days later he comes back and he's got to the bottom of the problem. He's also very very outstanding in his own way.\n\nMichel Morange est généticien et professeur à L'Université Paris VI ainsi qu'à l'Ecole Normale Supérieure où il dirige le Centre Cavaillès d'Histoire et de Philosophie des Sciences. Après l'obtention d'une license en Biochimie ainsi que de deux Doctorats, l'un en Biochimie, l'autre en Histoire et Philosophie des Sciences, il rejoint le laboratoire de Génétique Moléculaire dirigé par le Professeur François Jacob à l'Institut Pasteur. Ses principaux travaux de recherche se sont portés sur l'Histoire de la Biologie au XXème siècle, la naissance et le développement de la Biologie Moléculaire, ses transformations récentes et ses interactions avec les autres disciplines biologiques. Auteur de \"La Part des Gènes\" ainsi que de \"Histoire de la Biologie Moléculaire\", il est spécialiste de la structure, de la fonction et de l'ingénerie des protéines.\n\nMichel Morange is a professor of Biology and Director of the Centre Cavaillès of History and Philosophy of Science at the Ecole Normale Supérieure. After having obtained a Bachelor in biochemistry and two PhDs, one in Biochemistry, the other in History and Philosophy of Science, he went on to join the research unit of Molecular Genetics headed by François Jacob, in the Department of Molecular Biology at the Pasteur Institute, Paris. Together with Olivier Bensaude, he discovered that Heat Shock Proteins are specifically expressed on the onset of the mouse zygotic genome activation. Since then he has been working on the properties of Heat Shock Proteins, their role in aggregation and on the regulation of expression of these proteins during mouse embryogenesis. He is the author of 'A History of Molecular Biology' and 'The Misunderstood Gene'."
