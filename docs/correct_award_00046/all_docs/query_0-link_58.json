Son of Dr. Philip and Janet (née Sherak) Fire [see entry for Philip Fire in American Men & Women of Science: 22nd Edition (Thomson Gale, Detroit, 2005, Volume 2, C-F, p. 1154)]. Philip Fire is a past president (1951) of the MIT chapter of the national Jewish fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi; see http://www.mit.edu/activities/aepi/OLD/history5.shtml. See also http://www.mit.edu/activities/aepi/OLD/index.shtml. Janet Fire is the daughter of the late William and Rose (née Goldstein) Sherak, who were both Russian-Jewish immigrants to the United States.\n\n17. Son of Ernest and Brondelle (née Fleisher) Beutler. Ernest Beutler was a German-Jewish refugee who later became a distinguished American hematologist and biomedical scientist (1975 Gairdner Foundation Award); see Encyclopaedia Judaica, Vol. 11 (Keter, Jerusalem, 1972, p. 1200). Brondelle Beutler was the daughter of Harry and Mary (Krasne) Fleisher, both of whom were Russian-Jewish immigrants to the United States. See also the section entitled \"My background\" in http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/beutler-bio.html.\n\n18. Son of Irving and Nettie (Takefman) Steinman. See Montreal Gazette obituary notices for Steinman's maternal grandfather Nathan Takefman. See also the first paragraph of http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/steinman_bio.pdf.\n\n19. According to a 12 July 1971 New York Times marriage announcement, Rothman's marriage to Ruth Greifinger was conducted by Rabbi Lewis Levitsky. His parents were Dr. Martin and Gloria Rothman. The grave of his father, whose antecedents were Russian Jews, is listed in the JewishGen Online Worldwide Burial Registry. Gloria Rothman's parents were Sol (or Saul) and Sally Hartnick, whose antecedents were Austrian and Polish Jews, respectively. See also the last paragraph of http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2002_b_presentation.htm.\n\n20. In a Lasker Foundation interview, Schekman states (2:00 - 2:10): \"My grandparents came from Eastern Europe and immigrated separately to a small Jewish community in Minnesota, of all places.\" His parents were Alfred Israel and Esther (née Bader) Schekman. See also the last paragraph of http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2002_b_presentation.htm.\n\n21. See \"Clockwork Genes: Discoveries in Biological Time,\" which states on p. 10: \"Rosbash's parents fled Nazi Germany in 1938, 'and my mother went from a wealthy family to cleaning toilets in New York City before my father found a job.' His father was a cantor, a Jewish clergyman who sings or chants prayers; his mother had earlier been forced out of medical school when the Nazi government expelled Jews from German universities.\"\n\n22. Son of Alfred and Mary (née Dworkin) Alter, both children of Russian-Jewish immigrants to America.\n\n23. Son of Sidney and Selma (née Stone) Julius, who were the children of \"immigrants who left Eastern Europe in the early 1900s,\" according to David Julius' Shaw Prize autobiographical note. Selma Julius' parents were Harry and Sarah (née Heller) Stone, both Russian-Jewish immigrants. Sidney Julius' funeral was conducted under the auspices of Riverside Memorial Chapel in Manhattan, which has served the New York Jewish community since 1897.\n\n24. Jewish father, non-Jewish mother. Raised Jewish; wife and children are Jewish. See: https://www.jewishexponent.com/2021/12/16/penn-professor-saves-the-world-with-covid-vaccine-research/.\n\n25. Willem Einthoven (1926), whose name appears on several Jewish lists, had a Jewish paternal grandfather, but based on the biography by H. Snellen (Willem Einthoven, Kluwer, Boston, MA, 1995), it appears unlikely that any of his other grandparents were Jewish. Karl von Frisch (1973) appears to have had a Jewish maternal grandmother: see, e.g., the ninth paragraph of http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/25/raffles.php. Other names that have appeared on such lists include those of Erwin Neher (1991), Bert Sakmann (1991), Richard Roberts (1993), Phillip Sharp (1993), and Edward Lewis (1995), none of whom appear to be of Jewish descent."
