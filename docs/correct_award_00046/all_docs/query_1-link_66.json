        "text": "you can't possibly understand the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Physiology & Medicine without the knowledge of Molecular Biology and Systems Biology.\n\nTo illustrate, taking Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine over one hundred years in the 20th century, we should divide the time period in accordance with in half : You can learn the first 50 years from the article listed at the end of the book, Seven Winners of Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine in One Lab. It was nearly the success of Physical Science that led to the detect of double-helix DNA structure by Watson and Crick in 1953, which initiated the course of ¡§biological Science¡¨ in the later half of the 20th Century, and the success of Chemical Science assisted run through among it. In the last 50 years, Watson and Crick continued to take the lead in exploration of human life secrets by fundamental research in biological science with the molecular biological model. There are two teams of scientists who led the Human Genome Project (HGP): IPHGSC (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium), an ally of 6 countries with National Institute of Health (NIH) in USA in the lead vs Celera Genomics, a private enterprise in USA. They finally completed the research as expected by all humans. Their findings were publicized as follow: ¡GIPHGSC (Nature 409, Feb 15, 2001) and Celera (Science 291, February 16, 2001). These two magazines with a history of about 1 hundred years are the representative of east and west science journals, of which Science was first published in 1848. Therefore, the articles become the science classics representing the highest success of Molecular Biology, and marked the proudest full stop of biological science of 20th century in human science history. At the same time, elements of human biological system and all Genome Sequencing that determines inner messages were decoded. Such glories will be handed to Systems Biology, the new science of Post-gene Era in 21th century, and enhanced it.\n\nSystems Biology will succeed decoding of Gene Sequencing, the science fruits of 20th century, further explore life phenomenon, lead the decoding of Gene Sequencing applied to human HealthCare, Disease Prevention, and Disease Solution. ,and lead human beings enter new era of creating life values in 21th century. Accordingly, Molecular Biology will change from main strength of science to a fundmental tool for research of application science of Systems Biology.\n\nThere has been many coincidences during the 100 year science research. The Nobel Prize Foundation awarded the Nobel Prize for the first time on Dec. 10th, 1901, the first year of 20th century. And the articles of gene decoding were publicized in Science and Nature in Feb, 2001, the first year of 21th century. It is just right 100 years. The first Institute of Systems Biology in the world was established in Seattle, USA in Jan, 2000, the last year of 20th century. One year later, all genes were decoded in Feb, 2001. It's like a timely join with the 21th century and a transmittance to Systems Biology to enhance. Annual International Symposium of Systems Biology was held for the first time in the institute on Apr. 2nd, 2002. It's like an announcement to all humankind that, the Nobel Prize in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology & Medicine across the one hundred years has made the most brilliant contributions and wrote the finest page in human science history of the 20th century, which will soothe Nobel if he knows in the afterworld. For the next 100 years, Human Second Wave Biology, namely epoch-making of application science research of Systems Biology, has formally took over and prepared to march toward the tour of human life phenomena ¡¥Discovery'.\n\nNow it uncovers the new prologue of key plays of human life science in the 21th century: Systems Biology.\n\nWhat is Systems Biology ? Systems Biology studies all components of one biological system like genes, mRNA, proteins, and subsystem interaction of the components under certain conditions. That's to say, different from previous experimental biology that cares only individual DNA genes and proteins, Systems Biology studies all genes, proteins, subsystems, and Subsystem interaction of components. Obviously, Systems Biology is a large science of Multidisciplinary study featured by researching Integrated BioMedicine (IBM).\n\nExperimental biology like molecular biology in the 20th century is characterized by the fact that the scientists can study properties and functions through various methods to interfere biology materials such as inducing gene mutation or protein modification. As an experimental biology, Molecular Biology also involves intervention, the important tool. But establishment of models goes through every stage of Molecular Biology, for the ideal of Molecular Biology is to obtain a theoretical model that is as close to real biological system as possible.\n\nMolecular Biology should be absolutely perfect Integrated BioMedicine (IBM). That is to say, to view human body as a whole system, learn its status and framework by assaying and changing system's input and output, and further disclose inside components of the system and interaction and operation rules of molecular biology. In this way, it may give us a chance to know more about life phenomena.\n\nAdopting the standpoint of Reductionism, Molecular Biology give us a chance to know many unrevealed details and illustrate life phenomena with responding mechanism. Reductionism: Supposing that an individual complex system can be divided into many irrelevant subsystems, we can understand the system by studying the subsystems. If we find the subsystems still too complicated, we can further divide the subsystems and study them one by one. With this set of method, we can successfully illustrate principles of responsive operation on a molecular level, which is an important breakthrough of biology. It's the profile of centennial Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine, to win the prizes by discovery of minute secrets of life. You can have a better understanding by reviewing the appendix of the book, Important Annual Abstract of the Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine, or Summery of Important Abstracts on Cancer and Tumor Researches in the 20th Century below. But after unlimited simplification of Life Secrets for 100 years, we still can not illustrate the overall life phenomena, which is nearly the overall profile of the Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine in the 20th century since its foundation in 1900. Completion of human gene decoding represents only the perfect success of advanced sciences like Molecular Biology. The scientists remain puzzled about gene operation, protein formation, relationship between diseases and genes, etc.. That's the key reason why medical scientists do not understand etiology and provide effective regimens. How come to explore ¡§etiology¡¨ without delving into ¡§life phenomena¡¨ ?\n\nWe can see from the above Summary of Important Abstracts on Cancer and Tumor Researches in the 20th Century that, cancer and tumor researches made the greatest contribution in the history of human diseases, and that interaction of genes, viruses, immune system, and cancers and tumors has nearly been disclosed. But it's amusing that cancer and tumor treatment heads first according to reports of disease treatments. News about regimen or successful treatment of cancer can be read every year, or even every month. But generally speaking, drugs occupy only a small part of cancer's ¡§Life Phenomena¡¨. If only clinical success then reported exaggerated, or often put in head news to encourage people, why the mortality rate of cancers and tumors is highest in global diseases ? Why failure cure rate remains first high in patients with tumors and cancers in hospitals ? And why silent wards of nonenergetic cure are encouraged only in the treatment of cancers and tumors ?\n\nHave the finance we put on the researches of medical field is too little or the medical doctors are not smart enough ? No. In the whole 20th century, the medical field was presided by molecular biology, which is far from competent to explore the changing life and disease phenomena. It's like a bet with eyes covered. All researches focused on inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), a point of the profound phenomena of caners and tumors. EGF was expected to angiogenesis blocking agent or starve cancers and tumors, as we often heard. Then how can we put aside and neglect the centennial science achievements on cancer and tumor research ? On Jan. 9th, 2004, Erbitux, the drug approved by FDA, USA for large intestine cancer is one such EGF product. However, only development of Erbitux cost 24 years as about 1/4 century from 1980 to 2004. Can we eradicate large intestine cancer with Erbitux, then ? Not likely. How can we cure cancer with only one single method regarding the profound ¡§live¡¨ life phenomena of cancer ? It's the pain of humankind, and most helplessness of all caner and tumor patients. Visit the following website for other cancer and tumor drugs¡Ghttp://oncotherapy.us > Biomedical Products > US OncoTherapy MediFormula vs Chemical Drugs.\n\nTreatment of cancers and tumors involves not simply chemotherapy, FDA-approved cancer drugs, or regimens on the news reports. Systems Biology was not established till the beginning of the 21th century. Regarding these, National Cancer Institute (NCI) , National Institutes of Health (NIH) have to face the science truth and announced to invest US$14.9 Million on the new Integrative Cancer Biology Program (ICBP) on Oct. 26th, 2004. The ICBP plan is made to explore development and course of new cancers through a systems-wide approach as Systems Biology. It's an integration of highlights in nine research centers of biomedicine, contains integrative treatment using multidisciplinary approaches of cancer sciences, and includes new techniques like gene body, protein body, and molecular imaging, and computer and maths models that can predict the course of cancer, to disclose every stage of cancer progression.\n\nNCI also further established Cancer Biomedical Information Grid (caBIG) to coordinate all cancer research-derived bioinformatics, which provided cancer population of NCI with therapy and research.\n\nTherefore, the above described ICBP by NCI showed the prophet of on earth cure that the authors and the group started to research on Carcinomatosis in Outflanking Molecular Cytotherapy, a method Systems Biology Integrated BioMedicine (IBM) in treating cancers, tumors, and metastatic tumors 15 years before. It is the key of producing Systems Biology effective Integrated BioMedicine (IBM) in the 21th century of on earth cure method. And it's the reason why Carcinomatosis in Outflanking Molecular Cytotherapy becomes the cover subject of the book and the core science of the group.\n\nYet people in the world took their honest words as a sign of modesty, and ignored the key expression. They're just mad about it. They think it's now possible to copy humans, decode etiology, treat maliganant diseases, improve health and prolong life. Or they are scared like on the doomsday of the world for no reason. At that time, Collins surprised the field of biology, medicine, and medical industry by saying that, \"Apollo moon landing program of biology, it will be like man on the moon, like the start of the industrial revolution. The impact eventually will be enormous in medicine\".\n\nTherefore, Systems Biology will not only be the biology of the 21th century, but the mainstay of science that determines future of medical industry, human health, and disease treatment.\n\nIn fact, organisms are best at applying combination strategies of interaction between subsystems. Therefore, there're many randomized combinations when executing orders of DNA records. That's why only a small fraction of antibody genes can produce hundreds of antibodies to resist various kinds invasion. When randomized factors occur, there's no way to predict the results with Reductionism. Molecular biology can do nothing about the situation. Next comes Systems Biology. Therefore, the biology of the 21th century will integrate Systems Biology with applicative life science represented by the 100-year history of Nobel Prize in Physiology & Medicine in the 20th century.\n\nFor polycells organisms, Systems Biology should realize the integration of genes, tissues, and bodies at different levels. We all know that the core principle of Systemic Science is that, ¡§the whole is more than the sum of all parts¡¨. The property of a system is an ¡§emerging¡¨ new property resulting from interaction of components at different levels. Analysis of components or at low levels can not predict action at high levels. It's a basic challenge for Systems Biology to discover and understand the emerging property of the system via researches and integration. Therefore, the soul of Systems Biology exactly is Integrated BioMedicine (IBM)\n\nThe classic Molecular Biology is a vertical research that studies individual gene and protein with different methods. A certain gene is detected at DNA level first, and then studied functionally with methods like gene mutation and gene elimination. Spatial framework, modification, and interaction of proteins are studied on the basis of gene research. Genomics, proteomics, and other ¡§-mics¡¨ are horizontal research that studies thousands of millions of tens of thousands genes or proteins at a time with one single method. Systems Biology will integrate horizontal and vertical researches as a ¡§three-dimensional¡¨ research. A system is not simply a combination of genes and proteins, but the understanding of framework and molecular dynamics of the system. Besides, Systems Biology is a typical Multidisciplinary Study that needs participation of life science, informatics, mathematics, and computer science.\n\nBiological information can be graded and flow along different levels. Generally speaking, biological information flows in this way: DNA ¡÷ mRNA ¡÷ protein ¡÷ framework of protein interaction¡÷cell¡÷organ¡÷body¡÷colony. It's noteworthy that information at different levels will provide a useful view angle to understanding of operation of life system. Therefore, an important task of Systems Biology is to obtain as much information of subsystems as possible, and integrate them as a Multidisciplinary Study.\n\nFrom perspective of Reductionism, the key problem of system composition involves not the components, but their interaction or connection, which is information in essence. From another angle, life system is an open system far from balance. To maintain its order, the life system should keep exchanging energies with outside environment to resist Entropy Increasing. Entropy is average information volume in physics. Information-based biomedical research will be the core project of Systems Biology. Therefore, Signal Pathway Proteins will be its major issue of bioengineering. We can say that, life system is a course of information flow, and that Systems Biology is a subject to explore the operation rules and phenomena of such information. Hence Biorheology, a subject to study flow and change of blood, mucus, and other cytokines in the body, will be a fundamental platform of Systems Biology.\n\nSystems Biology is a subject combining science and technology. Experts in the fields of biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medicine, and computer work together to produce a new technique of computation biology so as to obtain, store, integrate and analyze biochemical data, and study the system with the processed complicated data. For researchers in biomedicine, it can be used to understand operation of immune system, produce better regimen via drug discovery, understand the struggle between virus and human immune system, find new treatment methods, and simulate the impact of drug components on diseases and body. That's the exact key of diagnostic equation developed between 1990~2004 by US OncoTherapy Systems BioMedicine Group , which involves Assembler Code & Collating Platform of Systems Biology (ACCP/SB) in cellular pathogenesis and physiopathology of symptoms / causes since the molecular medicine holds the promise of checking the progress of diseases, prescription of Pleiotropic Pharmacodynamics Discovery (PPD) and Molecular BioMedicine MediFormula. They now are just supporting http://genelife.net for Asian and global Chinese markets. That's also why our support only list two products as VirusDecoder and CytoThesis at the website http://virusdecoder.com to cover mechanisms included in 5 Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Physiology & Medicine.\n\nTherefore, Profile of Cancer and Tumor Research by the author (Aug, 1998), subsequent An Open Letter to Global All Doctors: Case Study of Diseases (Feb, 2002) (http://oncotherapy.us > News & Announcement > No.19), A Successful Case of Carcinomatosis Treatment ( I ) ( II ) (Jun, 2002) (http://oncotherapy.us > Selected Testimony), A Successful Case of Late Esophageal Cancer Treatment (Mar, 2004) (http://oncotherapy.us > Selected Testimony), and the above described Integrated Cancer Biological Plan by NCI, USA (Oct. 26th, 2004) contain the final summary of integrative highlights of nine biomedical research centers, and provide the best proof and most perfect illustration of Systems Biology.\n\nTherefore, science workers like me has learned the profoundness and wideness of life science, and pay homage from the bottom of the heart. In the 21th century, Genelife, Library of Biomedical Engineering has prepared to work for all human beings in the world."
