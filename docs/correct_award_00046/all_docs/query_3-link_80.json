Video 33: Walter Gilbert, clip 5\n\nJacob and Monod never identified the inhibitor, but Gilbert found it.\n\n16694. Video 33: Walter Gilbert, clip 1\n\nBefore Jacob and Monod, people thought the amount of protein in a cell was constant and proteins turned themselves off.\n\n16695. Video 33: Walter Gilbert, clip 2\n\nJacob and Monod discovered that genes control the amount of protein in a cell.\n\n16700. Video 33: Walter Gilbert, clip 7\n\nTo explain their data, Jacob and Monod had to hypothesize the existence of mRNA.\n\n16696. Video 33: Walter Gilbert, clip 3\n\nWhere did the idea of negative control come from?\n\n16526. Biography 23: Frederick Sanger (1918-2013)\n\nFrederick Sanger received two Nobel prizes (in the same category), for his work on protein sequencing and DNA sequencing.\n\n15884. The lac operon\n\nFrancois Jacob and Ja√ßques Monod figured out how bacteria controlled the production of an enzyme called beta-galactosidase. This system of feedback and negative regulation became the lac operon and was the first model for the control of protein productio"
