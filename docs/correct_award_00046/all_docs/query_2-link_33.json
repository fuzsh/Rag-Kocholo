        "text": "Dr François Jacob had intended to become a surgeon but was prevented from doing so by injuries sustained in the Second World War. He went on to become a leading molecular biologist. Together with Jacques Monod and André Lwoff, he was awarded the Nobel prize in 1965 for uncovering the mechanisms operating inside the cell by which certain genes become activated or inactivated, thereby regulating the cell’s metabolism. Their work laid the foundations upon which current theories of the control of gene expression are built.\n\nWorking with E.coli bacteria in the early 1960s, they discovered that certain proteins were involved in regulating the expression of genetic information. These regulatory proteins bind to sections of DNA Jacob called operators, which are part of a group of"
