        "text": "Schrödinger’s What is Life? has been reviewed many times upon its publication and over the years since. So, there is no reason here to do so. Rather, I limit my comments to three issues. One is introducing the authors of a significant treatise that Schrödinger placed in the center of his book—without his initiative, the treatise might have disappeared into oblivion. The title of the treatise was “Über die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur” (About the nature of gene mutation and gene structure) by N. W. Timoféeff-Ressovsky, K. G. Zimmer, and M. Delbrück [3]. A second issue is Schrödinger’s introduction of the idea of an aperiodic solid. And the third is the book’s influence on the science of the second half of the twentieth century, which I will do primarily by presenting a set of examples in the form of quotations.\n\nThe Timoféeff-Ressovsky-Zimmer-Delbrück paper consists of 4 main parts, whose titles are listed here in English translation:\n\nPart 1: Some facts of mutation research by N.W. Timoféeff-Ressovsky, pp 190−217.\n\nPart 2: The hit theory and its relationship to mutation triggering by K.G. Zimmer, 217−223.\n\nPart 3: Atomic physical model of gene mutation by M. Delbrück, 223−234.\n\nPart 4: Theory of gene mutation and gene structure by all three co-authors, 234−241.\n\nThree decades after the publication of this paper, Zimmer described its story, how the three authors had come together, and how unusual it was at the time—the 1930s in Germany—to produce collaborative research, let alone in an interdisciplinary teamwork. The paper was so unusual it was referred to often by the nickname of “Dreimännerwerk” (Three-men-paper) [4]. Max Delbrück has become very famous over the years, but the other two authors have stayed much less known. Here, I briefly introduce all three co-authors in the order of their authorship.\n\nNikolai V. Timoféev-Ressovsky (1900‒1981) studied and started his research career in Moscow. He was among the first to conclude that there is no threshold level of radioactivity that can cause harm to the human body because even the smallest amount can have negative consequences. Timoféev-Ressovsky called this the radiobiological paradox. He was also among the first to suggest that radiologists should be equipped with a protective apron made of lead. Schrödinger was so impressed by this aspect of Timoféev-Ressovsky’s work that he alludes to it in his What is Life? even though it does not have direct relevance to the main thrust of his book.\n\nIn the mid-1920s, the Soviet Union was still open for international scientific exchange and according to a Soviet-German agreement, the Germans set up brain research in Moscow and the Soviets helped Germany in genetics. In view of the later tragic persecution of geneticists, it is remarkable that genetics was at such a level in the mid-1920s in the Soviet Union that the Germans were willing to learn from their Soviet colleagues. Timoféev-Ressovsky was delegated by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to go to Berlin for a one- or two-year visit. He stayed for twenty years doing research in the academic center of Berlin-Buch. He became an internationally renowned geneticist while the science of genetics was being destroyed in his home country.\n\nUpon his return to the Soviet Union in 1945, he was treated as a prisoner. However, his expertise in the biological effects of radiation was much in demand in the Soviet nuclear program. He was appointed to oversee a biophysical laboratory in Obninsk, a city some 100 km southwest of Moscow, where an important research center was developed after 1945. In 1954, the world’s first nuclear power plant started its operations in Obninsk. Timoféev-Ressovsky was never allowed back to Moscow. In Obninsk, a plaque commemorates him.\n\nKarl G. Zimmer (1911 − 1988) was a German nuclear chemist. He worked with Timoféeff-Ressovsky in the Kaiser Wihelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin-Buch. After World War II, between 1945 and 1955, as a prisoner, he participated in the Soviet nuclear program in a laboratory headed by Timoféeff-Ressovsky. Upon Zimmer’s return to Germany, he settled in West Germany (as it was then) and worked in nuclear research in Karlsruhe. His main research interest was the effect of ionizing radiation on DNA.\n\nMax Delbrück (1906 − 1981, Fig. 1) was a German American biophysicist. He is known not so much for his own discoveries as for his leadership in the molecular biology research community. He studied physics in Göttingen and became Lise Meitner’s associate in Berlin. He produced important results that were not confirmed until much later. His interest gradually turned to genetics, and this led him to the cooperation with Timoféev-Ressovsky and Karl Zimmer [3]. The essence of their joint treatise may sound trivial today, but it was groundbreaking at the time. It dealt with the special stability of genes (without really knowing what they were), which is maintained at 37 degrees Celsius. This refers to the chemical stability of genes and, accordingly, they concluded that the genes are built by molecules. The paper was not noticed for many years, except by Erwin Schrödinger, who made a strong reference to Delbrück in his highly influential book. The way Schrödinger narrated Delbrück’s contribution generated a mystical interest among researchers who became increasingly involved in the science of genetics in subsequent years.\n\nDelbrück left Germany in 1937 and continued his life and research in the United States on a Rockefeller Fellowship. Like many other researchers, he was greatly influenced by Schrödinger's book. Schrödinger writes about an aperiodic crystal in which we can recognize the DNA molecule that carries the information on heredity, a role that was not yet known at the time. It was a coincidence that shortly after the book appeared, Oswald T. Avery and two colleagues published experimental evidence that DNA, hitherto thought to be a dull molecule, was the carrier of heredity (see below), but for several years this was accepted by very few. Two of those few, as will be alluded to below, came to highly significant and influential discoveries.\n\nAfter completing his Rockefeller Fellowship, Delbrück taught at Vanderbilt University. In the 1940s, he formed a research collaboration with the Italian refugee biologist Salvador E. Luria (1912 − 1991) of Indiana University. This duo expanded to include Alfred D. Hershey (1908 − 1997) of Washington University in St. Louis. The three formed the phage research school. Phages are viruses that can infect bacteria. This line of research and Delbrück’s engaging personality attracted many talented young scientists. Among them was James D. Watson (b. 1928), who received his doctorate at Indiana University and later became world famous for his discovery, together with Francis Crick (1916 − 2004), of the double-helix structure of DNA. The phage group regularly held summer schools at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and played a key role in the advancement of molecular biology in modern American and international research. From 1947, Delbrück was appointed professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he stayed for the rest of his life.\n\nDelbrück inspired others, was an excellent critic, and had unquestionable integrity. In 1969, Delbrück, Hershey, and Luria were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discoveries on the reproductive mechanism and genetic structure of viruses\". In his Nobel lecture, Delbrück did not talk about his research; rather, he talked about general topics, such as physics and biology, the body and soul, and the relationship between artist and scientist. As an appendix to the published lecture, he included a paper he wrote in Berlin in 1937 on the mystery of life.\n\nSchrödinger’s book has been one of the most celebrated documents in modern biology whose value is not so much in its findings; rather, it resides in questions it raises and the impact it had. It raised the question of the nature of the gene and brought about the novel idea of the aperiodic crystal as the means of transformation of the information of heredity. It also hinted at the most intriguing possibility that for understanding life, heretofore unknown physical laws might have to be uncovered. The aperiodic crystal found its essential manifestation in the DNA molecule, and its merely formal, but verbatim manifestation in quasicrystals. It is interesting though understandable that the discovery of quasicrystals [5] has never been related to Schrödinger’s aperiodic crystal because there is no functional relationship between them, only semantic. In a phenomenological aspect, the quasicrystals are aperiodic crystals indeed but not in the way Schrödinger used this term. To Schrödinger, a small molecule would be an initial seed for the gene. Its extending by mere repetition – the way a crystal is being formed – could not lead to the gene because periodicity would exclude carrying information. The other way for extending the initial seed molecule would be building up a complex organic molecule – we might add that proteins could be such systems, or DNA as we know it today. DNA, as it was known in Schrödinger’s time, could not be the substance of gene since it had been demonstrated to be uniformly repetitive. This was according to Phoebus Levene’s tetranuleotide hypothesis introduced in 1909 [6] – that the DNA consisted of a repetition of four nucleotides (see, eg, [7]).\n\nAs it was already alluded to above, in an interesting historical coincidence, also in 1944 appeared the seminal paper of Oswald T. Avery (1877 − 1955), Colin M. MacLeod (1909 − 1972), and Maclyn McCarty (1911 − 2005, Fig. 2) [8] pointing to DNA as the substance of heredity. The authors called it, the “transformation principle.” It was almost a premature discovery as most members of the related research community ignored it, not in small part due to a vocal critic, Alfred Mirsky. He argued that with even the most careful purification of the sample under investigation, a tiny fraction of protein impurity might have been left that would still constitute billions of molecules, and that impurity might be the real carriers of heredity [9]. Many years later Mirsky published a paper in Scientific American in which he acknowledged that DNA was the substance of heredity but offered no apology for his early criticism [10].\n\nAvery’s story is of interest also in considering the effects of human traits on the recognition of scientific discoveries. His milestone discovery came quite late in his life and by the time it was published, he had officially retired though he continued working at the Rockefeller Institute (as it was then). According to one of his associates, Maclyn McCarty [9], Avery did not have an outgoing personality. In fact, he was quite restrained and did not like to talk in public, which he did not consider science. On the rare occasions when he gave a talk, he did not let it be printed. Even before Avery had withdrawn from active research, following their pivotal publication in 1944, both MacLeod and McCarty continued in different areas of science. All three of them were physicians by training, and MacLeod and McCarty were offered appointments that were more in line with medicine. The broader recognition that DNA was the genetic material was completed a few years later by a less extensive investigation of Alfred D. Hershey and Martha Chase in 1952 because by then, the broader scientific community was ripe for accepting that DNA has this distinctively unique role in heredity [11].\n\nAbove I called Avery et al.’s discovery “almost premature” because there were two outstanding researchers on whose work it did have an immediate decisive effect: Erwin Chargaff [12,13,14] and Joshua Lederberg [15]. In the long run, the contributions of Chargaff and Lederberg had profound impact in science history generally and Chargaff’s discoveries specifically for the understanding of the nature of DNA. He determined that DNA was not a dull uniformly repetitive molecule; rather, it was organism-dependent, and he made the crucial observation, even if somewhat reluctantly, of base-pairing in DNA.\n\nJoshua Lederberg’s work that was also influenced immediately by Avery et al.’s discovery, led to Lederberg’s Nobel-Prize-winning discovery that “genes act by regulating definite chemical events,” according to the motivation of the Nobel award. It was a joint prize in 1958, shared by Lederberg, George W. Beadle, and Edward L. Tatum.\n\nAs for Schrödinger’s raising the possibility, even necessity, of uncovering heretofore unknown physical laws for understanding life, this notion enhanced the impact of his book on the careers of several outstanding physicists and budding scientists. This influence was in sync with some general research directions in the development of science in the middle of the twentieth century. Thus, for example, Leo Szilard intended to shift his interest toward biology already before Worl War II, that is, well before Schrödinger’s book. However, due to the tremendous development in nuclear physics, he stayed and made the move only after WWII. Let us look at the statements of some well-known scientists for the impact of Schrödinger’s What is Life?\n\nJames D. Watson has repeatedly expressed its profound impact on determining the main thrust of his career leading to the joint discovery with Francis Crick of the double helix structure of DNA [16, 17]: “… [I] spotted the tiny book by the theoretical physicist Erwin Schrödinger. In that little gem, Schrödinger said the essence of life was the gene. Up until then, I was interested in birds. But then I thought, well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it. And that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.”\n\nAccording to science historian Robert Olby [18] “Schrödinger’s vision inspired Crick. ‘It conveyed in an exciting way,’ he explained, ‘the idea that in biology, molecular explanations would not only be extremely important but also that they were just around the corner.’” Watson also noted [2, p 12]: “A major factor in his [Crick’s] leaving physics and developing an interest in biology had been the reading in 1946 of What is Life? …” Roger Penrose mentioned something similar in his Preface written in 1991 to a later edition of What is Life? [19]: “Indeed, many scientists who have made fundamental contributions in biology, such as J. B. S. Haldane and Francis Crick, have admitted to being strongly influenced by (although not always in complete agreement with) the broad-ranging ideas put forward here by this highly original and profoundly thoughtful physicist.” Crick himself wrote [20], “… Schrödinger’s book was very timely and attracted people who might otherwise not have entered biology at all.” Those people included Crick himself, according to Watson: “After Francis read it [the book], he thought, ‘Why not try biology?’” [21, p 5].\n\nAccording to Maurice Wilkins, DNA crystallographer and co-recipient of the Nobel Prize with Watson and Crick for the structure of DNA [22]: “I was attracted by Schrödinger’s thinking in What is Life? because he linked the extremely important biological idea of a gene with the rather strange world of electrons moving in crystals. He wrote about a gene being an aperiodic crystal, and that connected directly with my PhD research … But the main impact of Schrödinger’s book was that it set me in motion. It was not just what he wrote, but how he wrote it. … Schrödinger used the language of physicists and that stimulated me, as a physicist, to persevere with this book and its introduction to genetics, and to decide that this was the general area that I wanted to explore, as a ‘biophysicist’”.\n\nGunter Stent, one of the pioneers of molecular biology, wrote [23]: “It [What is Life?] had a tremendous effect on me and changed my professional career, as it would change also the careers of many of my coevals trained in the physical sciences during the war.”\n\nAccording to an edited volume on Watson and the DNA [24]: “Seymour Benzer is one of the group of physicists who turned to biology after reading Erwin Schrödinger’s What is Life?” Seymour Benzer (1921 − 2007 [25]), a physicist by training, was another among the pioneers of molecular biology and he received, among other distinctions, the Crafoord Prize in 1993. Like the Nobel Prize in Physics and in Chemistry, it is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and it is for discoveries in fields that are not covered by Nobel Prizes (astronomy, biosciences, geosciences, mathematics). His prize motivation read: “for his pioneering genetical and neurophysiological studies on behavioural mutants in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster” [26].\n\nWe need to distinguish between what the contemporary readers might have considered to be the most intriguing message of Schrödinger’s book and what the reader of the book decades later might think. To the contemporary reader, the possible discovery of new physical laws might have been the greatest challenge. Looking back, decades later, Gunter Stent found Schrödinger’s most important idea in considering the gene as an information carrier: “In retrospect, the most important point made by Schrödinger was that the gene is to be thought as an information carrier” (emphasis in the original) [27].\n\nIn the initial part of this essay, I mentioned that Schrödinger resuscitated the “Dreimännerwerk” treatise, and this is what Max Perutz in his 1987 Nature commentary, “Physics and the riddle of life,” acknowledged [28]. Otherwise, Perutz’s review reflects deep disappointment in the book 43 years after its publication. His puzzlingly ungenerous commentary says, “what was true in his book was not original, and most of what was original was known not to be true even when it was written” [28, p 558]. In 2011, Watson remembered his time at the Cavendish Laboratory in the early 1950s: “It [the book] had no impact on Max Perutz because he was already studying molecular structure and thought What is Life unnecessary and overplayed” [21, p 5]. Curiously, Perutz was specifically invited by Nature “to review the influence of What is Life?” ([28, p 558], my emphasis), and he collected a great deal of interesting information on that influence as well. Moreover, he considered the possible sources of inspiration that might have shifted the interests of Max Delbrück and others, including Schrödinger, toward the puzzle of heredity and more generally toward biology. In this connection, Perutz refers to Niels Bohr’ lecture “Light and Life” at an international meeting titled “Light Therapy” in 1932 in Copenhagen ([29] (note that [29] refers to the concluding part of this publication; the first part under the same title is in pp 421 − 423 of the same issue of Nature). Unfortunately, Perutz’s quotation of what Bohr said is incomplete, hence, not entirely accurate. In Perutz, according to Bohr: “The existence of life must be considered as an elementary fact that cannot be explained, but must be taken as a starting point in biology…” [28, p 557]. This sounds rather gloomy. However, in the original, Bohr says: “On this view, the existence of life must be considered as an elementary fact that cannot be explained, but must be taken as a starting point in biology…” [29, p 458, emphasis by me]. Pointing out the difference might seem nitpicking, but it is not so because due to this difference Perutz is taking Bohr’s statement out of context. The sentence under scrutiny is preceded by the following in Bohr’s paper [29, p 458]: “… the conditions holding for biological and physical researches are not directly comparable, since the necessity of keeping of object of investigation alive imposes a restriction on the former, which finds no counterpart in the latter. Thus, we should doubtless kill an animal if we tried to carry the investigation of its organs so far that we could describe the role played by single atoms in vital functions. In every experiment on living organisms, there must remain an uncertainty as regards the physical conditions to which they are subjected, and the idea suggests itself that the minimal freedom we must allow the organism in this respect is just large enough to permit it, so to say, to hide its ultimate secrets from us. On this view…” From this follows that the gloomy view on whether life would ever be possible to explain, should not be necessarily ascribed to Bohr; rather, it refers to the set of conditions Bohr is quoting that might have characterized research of life in biology in the early 1930s. That set of conditions might or might have not been unique in Bohr’s time; it certainly must not have been so at the time Perutz was quoting him, that is, half a century later (and it certainly is not so today). The situation is much less gloomy today than it was in 1932 with respect to the understanding of what life is; this hope stems from, among others, the tremendous progress in the technology of research, such as protein crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, and the ever-evolving non-invasive tools in biological research.\n\nAt this point, let us fast forward from 1944 to 2020, when Paul Nurse’s book What Is Life? [30] appeared. By the time I got my copy of this book, it had been reprinted several times. As soon as I looked up its Contents, the title of Chapter 1, “The Cell: Biology’s Atom,” made me fall in love with it. It brought me back to my childhood, when as an early teen, I learned about physics and about biology for the first time. These were two separate subjects in our school, taught by two very different teachers, and neither of them gave me the confidence to ask them about my tormenting dilemma. In physics, I learned that the smallest unit was the atom, and it had a nucleus, whereas in biology I learned that the cell was the smallest unit, and it had a nucleus. It took a long time of self-study before I resolved this seeming contradiction. I wish I could have asked Nurse or that he had taught in our school.\n\nSir Paul Nurse (b. 1949, Fig. 3) [31] was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2001. He shared it with Leland H. Hartwell and Sir Tim Hunt “for their discoveries of key regulators of the cell cycle.” Nurse did not have a privileged family background, but studied and has become one of the most decorated members of British Society. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1989 and in 2022, he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM) by King Charles III. The membership of this Order is restricted to 24, just to mention two of his distinctions.\n\nNurse is a rare contemporary scientist who is interested in the big picture in addition to the detailed investigation of a particular subject matter. He observed that “biologists often shy away from talking about great ideas and grand theories” [30, p 3]. According to Nurse, the overwhelming diversity of nature and our constantly developing knowledge about it makes it especially hard to arrive at a unifying concept about it. He formulated five ideas to characterize our modern knowledge about it: The Cell; The Gene; Evolution by Natural Selection; Life as Chemistry; and Life as Information. His narrative is a captivating read, and it is concise. It would serve no purpose retelling it here.\n\nOne of the most engaging features of Nurse’s book is that he makes the story of biology personal. He mentions specific contributions of some of the pivotal scientists who shaped the development of our knowledge in general and his scientific views in particular. This is risky in that this may lead to oversimplification as this approach may unjustly ascribe much of the progress to selected individuals. It stems from the nature of science that it is a vertical establishment in that numerous contributions form the foundation of any seminal discovery. In our modern life even more than in the past, we tend to single out people and concentrate much merit in them that should be distributed among many more than just one. The institution of the Nobel Prize multiplies this effect by singling out a few individuals whereas rendering many others, among them commensurably meritorious contributors to the same discovery, to disappear into oblivion. Yet, no doubt, this is an efficient approach to making stories tick and if ever, certainly in a personal account it is justifiable.\n\nReturning to Nurse’s book, his injecting personal features into his narrative, especially when his personal interactions were involved, are most captivating. He may not have attended the topmost universities in Britain, but he came across some of the key personalities of biology. The book mentions several, including the world-famous Francis Crick [32], Sydney Brenner (1927 − 2019) [33, 34], and François Jacob (1920 − 2013) [35] (Fig. 4), and the less well-known, though also Nobel laureate, Peter Mitchell (1920 − 1992, Fig. 5). I see no need to write much here about Crick, Brenner, and Jacob; the references I attached to them above show that I have admired them as well.\n\nPeter Mitchell’s main contribution to science was in bioenergetics; the motivation of his chemistry Nobel Prize in 1978 was “for his contribution to the understanding of biological energy transfer through the formulation of the chemiosmotic theory.” Nurse called him “a true British eccentric” [30, p 109]. Mitchell’s discoveries impacted Nurse, but the two met in person only when Mitchell was already in his seventies. Nurse was “impressed by his unabated curiosity and passion for knowledge” [30, p 109]. Curiosity was also Nurse’s driving force, which turned him to become a scientist [31, p74]. Nurse also mentions in his book that Mitchell ignored his doubters and proved that his unusual idea was correct. A crucial person who initially opposed it, and then supported it, was Lars Ernster (1920 − 1998) [36], a long-time member of the chemistry Nobel committee. According to Ernster, bioenergetics was famous for having tremendous fights in the 1960s and 1970s. At one point, Ernster declared that he did not believe in Peter Mitchell. Then, after a while, after having visited Mitchell’s laboratory, he declared that he was beginning to believe in him because he had seen his experiment [36, pp 388 − 389]. Ernster called Mitchell “a great thinker and a great personality.” According to Arthur Kornberg, Ernster received nasty letters from American chemists protesting Mitchell’s Nobel award in chemistry [37]. This stemmed from ignorance and from a narrow interpretation of what modern chemistry is.\n\nNurse’s universalist interest contrasts with many outstanding contributors to the great successes of the biological and pharmaceutical sciences where the following often happens: the researcher rushes to the frontier of science without building up a broad-based reserve of knowledge, makes a great discovery, and then the career in science is over and is overtaken by a career in companies, in science administration, and/or in authoring influential books. This path does not deduct anything from the significance of the discovery; it is just a different career model. Nurse’s universalist interest is witnessed by his reaching back to science history in his discussion of what the use of information means for cells in regulating themselves. As an illustration of his writing, I mention that he gives a brief description of the mechanism of the operation of the centrifugal governor and its story. The Dutch polymath Christiaan Huygens developed it originally using millstones. Then, the Scottish engineer and scientist James Watt adapted it and fitted it to a steam engine. Its function was to keep the engine running at a constant speed. An amazing recognition of the importance of the governor appears in the sculpture “Science” erected in 1868−1869 in London (Fig. 6). The allegorical science lady holds a governor in her hands. It is conspicuous especially if we consider that in a much less visible way, on her left side, there are other symbolic appearances of other important areas of science and technology. The distinguished references to the governor in both the Nurse book and the allegorical Science sculpture symbolize the unity of science and technology. Referring to this example I wanted also to illustrate the straightforward and easy-to-perceive style of Nurse’s book. As for Nurse’s career, his broad-based interest did not prevent him – perhaps, it may have facilitated – his occupying pivoting positions in science administration, being it the presidency of the Rockefeller University in New York, the presidency of the Royal Society (London), and the chairmanship of the Executive Committee of the Francis Crick Institute (London) and its directorship.\n\nReflecting about the two books of identical title by Schrödinger and by Nurse, even when it is done in a cursory way by picking up a few selected pieces of a mosaic, demonstrates the tremendous progress biology has made in eighty years. It is an uplifting thought that far beyond satisfying intellectual curiosity, this progress has brought about unprecedented benefits in raising the quality of life and heretofore never imagined advances in medicine."
