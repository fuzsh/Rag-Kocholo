Without Chemistry our lives would be dull, dark, boring and short.’\n\nChemistry homework might be hard but a world without Chemistry would be a real pain. Without Chemistry we wouldn’t have more of the medicines that keep us from getting sick or stop us from feeling the pain of a headache, broken bone or tooth extraction.\n\nYear 7 and 8\n\nChemistry is all around us and so taking advantage of the lockdown was achieved by making slime, volcanoes from bicarbonate of soda and vinegar and infusion of bath bombs with essential oils.\n\nStudents in 8 are invited to take part in the annual Chemistry Salters Challenge, which is hosted by UCL. Berkhamsted pupils take the opportunity to investigate the source of a chemical using flame tests and precipitation tests.\n\nKS3/4 Co-curricular Science Club\n\nIf you want to explore science and ignite your curiosity, then this would be for you! We made ‘Ferro Liquid’, an amazing liquid that when subjected to a magnet behaves like a solid in that it has a defined shape. You can have the fun of science without the recording and writing. We use exploration as a way of thinking and discussion so that you can ask the questions that you always wanted to. Delving deeper into science in a logical way will enhance your thinking beyond any curriculum.\n\nSixth\n\nSixth Form Chemistry in Action day at UCL are attended by Year 12 and are a highlight of the academic programme for students as they highlight many different areas where Chemistry can be used in industry including pharmacy and food.\n\nChemistry Olympiad\n\nFor students ‘The Chemistry Olympiad ’ is a great way to increase your problem-solving skills and will challenge you to think about Chemistry in a synoptic way using all of the knowledge that you have gleaned in your Year 12 and 13 course. Written tests comprise of questions based on real-world chemistry problems that often stimulate much debate, raising awareness of what chemistry is all about and provide an opportunity to develop and showcase some of the skills required for studying Chemistry at university and beyond. Our students took part in this in January 2020. We achieved a great set of results right at the start of lock down\n\nYear 12 Challenge\n\nA similar challenge for Year 12 is the C3L6. This comprises questions related to the Year 12 specification and is an excellent way to challenge those honed facts from previous examinations.\n\nKS5 Co-Curricular Chemistry Club\n\nStudents in Year 11 attending this club are taught by Year 13 students some A level practicals which stretch and challenge as well as allowing Year 11 students interested in Chemistry to become familiar with equipment for the future.\n\nFurther Activities Online\n\nChemistry Review – a range of articles to ignite your interest\n\nRoyal Society of Chemistry – a range of resources including career and university advice\n\nUCL Outreach Lectures – a range of resources from UCL and online lectures aimed at Year 12 students.\n\nGlaxo Smithkline resources and ideas for students who are looking for careers in Chemistry\n\nRSC provide a range of activities to complete.\n\nHeadstart programmes have been used extensively by students on work placements to further their knowledge of an experience in industry or at a top University. These need to be applied for well in advance.\n\nBeyond Berkhamsted\n\nThe Chemistry Department have been delighted at the end of the 2019 academic year to send Henry Kergon to UCL and Freya Butler to Oxford University to study Chemistry.\n\nHenry Kergon\n\nHenry completed A Level Chemistry in Summer 2019 and has just completed his first year studying Chemistry at University College London. Here area his reflections on the year.\n\nDoing Chemistry at UCL is a wonderful experience and a privilege. In my first year I have covered a multitude of different subject areas from quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in physical chemistry, to complex mechanisms and reaction pathways in organic chemistry, as well as crystal structures and metals in inorganic chemistry, all accompanied by a high level of teaching.\n\nThe lab sessions are exciting and engaging, due to the research quality equipment, and additionally the work that we do often links into what we are learning in lectures. UCL has also done a great job at arranging first year group projects to get to know others whilst introducing you to the nature of university and academic work. These have included an air pollution project, which involved as a year group collecting data on pollution levels for the majority of central London. Another group activity was a poster project which involved getting to know a member of the research team and speaking to them on some of their work and presenting this information as a group to other members of staff in the department.\n\nThe study of Classics at Berkhamsted divides into two routes for GCSE and A Level: the study of the Latin language and the study of Classical Civilisation. Both are wonderful opportunities to connect with the rich and inspiring civilisations of the Greeks and Romans. We put emphasis on first rate teaching and learning, but we also want you to widen your enjoyment by involvement in wider opportunities outside the classroom.\n\nYear 7 Italy Trip\n\nEach year we organise a trip to Rome and the Bay of Naples. This trip is offered to pupils who study Latin and it is organised to widen understanding of the ancient Roman world. “Must see” places include the Colosseum and the Roman Forum in the city of Rome as well as the House of Caecilius in Pompeii. It is a great trip and the educational value of it is enormous. Be warned that we limit numbers to forty pupils maximum.\n\nAn Informal Evening of Classical Entertainment\n\nWe hold this event in Old Hall every few years and we invite participation from classes which are learning Latin or Classical Civilisation. Everyone is welcomed to attend and to show in an informal setting one aspect of their work. It could be a short presentation or PowerPoint on a topic of interest or perhaps a chance to dress up in a toga and present a short play in English or indeed in Latin. A great occasion for younger pupils to see what is going on in the lessons of older groups. Parents love it too.\n\nJACT Latin Summer Camp\n\nThis is a residential summer school held each year at Wells Cathedral School and students from Berkhamsted are invited to attend. Not only is there excellent preparation and revision for GCSE and A Level Latin students, but there is also a wealth of fun activities to join. The focus is Latin language, literature and culture, but after that there are organised excursions to Bath and Wales, followed by an informal Classical drama production and workshops on Roman cookery. It could be helpful to know that the school offers bursaries to support students with the costs of residential trips like this one.\n\nTrip to Greece\n\nOlder pupils in Year 10 and above are able to participate in the Classics Trip to Greece held every two years in the October half-term. The next trip will be organised by Mr Wille and it takes place in Michaelmas Term 2022. The group flies to Athens and then tours the main archaeological sites of Greece. You will have a chance to visit amazing sites, such as Delphi, Olympia and Mycenae. The trip lasts for a week and is a fantastic way to extend your knowledge of the ancient Greek world.\n\nBritish Museum and the National Gallery\n\nIn Year 8 we take our Classical Civilisation students on a lightning trip to London to visit the British Museum and the National Gallery. The theme is Classical mythology and we look at a small selection of art to see how ancient myths are depicted through the ages. A central theme for us is the Trojan War. This fits perfectly with the Year 8 course in Classical Civilisation.\n\nEssay Competition for Latin and Classical Civilisation\n\nThe Golden Sponge Stick Competition is open to Latin pupils in Year 7. This is a creative writing competition with a very special prize for the winner. If you have read anything by Caroline Lawrence, you will know what a great writing she is. Her Roman mysteries series is set in the ancient Roman world. Have a look at her website here: http://www.romanmysteries.com/ . You will not be disappointed. The task is to write in English a mystery story or an exciting thriller set in ancient Pompeii. The more you include references to topics you have studied in class, the better. Why not try to put in short Latin phrases like “salvete!”\n\nThe London Latin Reading Competition\n\nIf you are studying Latin, reading competitions like this can be great fun. Younger years are asked to prepare short plays from the Cambridge Latin Course and students perform them in front of judges with prizes given to those who bring the stories to life. Last year we entered several categories and won gold, silver and bronze medals. Students also have great fun.\n\nUseful links:\n\nhttps://www.quia.com/\n\nGreat for testing your Latin vocabulary\n\nhttps://www.quizlet.com/\n\nAnother great site for testing yourself\n\nhttp://www.cambridgescp.com/Upage.php?p=clc%5Etop%5Ehome\n\nThe most important website for Latin students at Berkhamsted. Here you can use the online tester, see the webbooks for all stages of the Cambridge Latin Course and access e-learning resources. It is also great for GCSE Classical Civilisation students, as there is much on the OCR Rome City Life topic as well.\n\nHere is a picture from the website http://www.bestlatin.blogspot.co.uk. If you study Latin, you will find that this is a really interesting site. See if you can work out what the proverb is!\n\nQuotations from students:\n\n“The Latin trip to Italy in Year 7 was the best school trip ever! Really!”\n\n“Our Classics teacher gives us incredible tips about how to learn. Mind-mapping and flashcards are his favourites, but I like playing Kahoot with my friends.”\n\n“Now I see Latin words and derivations everywhere. If you give me a very technical or scientific word, I bet that I can work out what it means!”\n\nSixth\n\nBoth libraries subscribe to the Classics’ sixth form magazine “Omnibus”. The latest magazine is the seventy-sixth issue, so it has been going for some considerable time. It contains articles on the Classical world, including an update of competitions to enter. Interesting articles in recent editions include “Did the Romans love their children?” and “The role of the gods in the Odyssey”. The magazine is very much to be recommended to you. Here is a link to follow: http://www.jact.org/publications/omnibus.htm\n\nMassolit\n\nThere are hundreds of amazing academics out there who have dedicated their lives to themes like the Greek Theatre, Homeric Epic, Rome under Augustus and much more, whose knowledge and expertise would be very useful for school students. Previously, these academics have been limited to visiting the school one-by-one, but they can now share their knowledge with us online using Massolit. https://www.massolit.io/ The school has access to a vast range of short lectures, recorded for viewing on your Surface-Pro. They cover the most important areas of our courses and are in bit sized chunks for easy understanding. Great for independent research at school and at home.\n\nThe British Museum\n\nThe British Museum is an important London location for all A Level students of Latin and Classical Civilisation. The department encourages you to visit it regularly to ensure that you can widen your exposure to the ancient world. The website here can be used to see whether there are relevant or imminent exhibitions to interest you. Getting to the British Museum could not be easier: a train journey for 35 minutes, followed by a ten minute walk. All very easy and a very useful place indeed!\n\nhttp://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on.aspx\n\nA Level Study Days\n\nSovereign Education offers a series of A Level study days on parts of your Classical Civilisation or Latin syllabus. These tend to take place in a venue that is very close to Euston Station, so access from Berkhamsted is very easy. In recent years we have attended courses on Greek tragedy and Homer’s Odyssey, but there are also other courses which could well interest us on Latin set texts. Here is the link:\n\nhttp://www.sovereigneducation.co.uk/\n\nThe Greek Trip\n\nThe Greek Trip is a great way to widen your knowledge of the ancient world especially as it allows you to give depth of understanding to your studies, so instead of just talking about the oracle at Delphi, you can actually see for yourselves where the Pythia sat and gained her inspiration in the sanctuary of Apollo. Once seen, never forgotten.\n\nClassical Essay Competitions\n\nEach year there are a number of essay competitions for Latin and Classical Civilisation on Classical themes, which we encourage students to enter. Recent competitions have been organised by a variety of universities and colleges, including St Hugh’s College, Oxford.\n\nOther useful links are:\n\ntwitter@berkoclassics\n\nhttps://blog.britishmuseum.org/how-to-explore-the-british-museum-from-home/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwLmr4OCc6gIVh7PtCh3bKAaMEAAYASAAEgKYRvD_BwE\n\nHave a look at this virtual tour of the British Museum. See the some of the greatest objects in the world from your sofa!\n\nhttps://kahoot.it\n\nKahoot is a free game based learning platform that makes it fun to learn – try quizzes on Greek art and Greek tragedy.\n\nhttp://www.ocr.org.uk/\n\nAccess to the OCR website is very important, as both Latin and Classical Civilisation courses in the sixth form follow OCR specifications:\n\nQuotations\n\n“The A Level course is fantastic and now I want to study Latin at university. It is such an important part of my life! Thank you, Berkhamsted.”\n\n“I took my parents to the British Museum in London during the holidays and amazed them (or I think I did) with my knowledge. They want to study the ancient world too!”\n\n“Delphi is the most amazing place in Greece and in the world. The more I travel, the more I want to go back there!” The home of the ancient oracle has a magical aura about it. Wow!”\n\nTeaser\n\nThere are many exciting opportunities for you get involved in Drama at Berkhamsted. If you love being on stage, supporting backstage, seeing amazing shows or enjoy a chance to be creative with others, we have something for you! “You are never starved of chances to get involved” Toby, Year 11.\n\nSchool Productions\n\nWe put on multiple productions ever year at Berkhamsted, ranging from musicals to comedies to straight plays. Everyone has the chance to be cast or involved in a production. Whether you are an experienced performer or someone who is considering acting in a school show for the first time, we hope you will come and join in the fun! The shows are always spectacular.\n\nBeyond the stage\n\nWe offer multiple opportunities to support our shows beyond acting. There are many areas you can get involved; stage management, directing, choreographing, costume design, playing in the live band/orchestra or lighting and sound design.\n\nSpeech and Drama Lessons\n\nPrivate extra drama lessons are available to all pupils at Berkhamsted to enable you to explore texts (acting) or songs (musical theatre), to devise drama and/or hone your communication and public speaking skills in very small groups or individually. Participants have the opportunity to take exams validated by LAMDA (London Academy of Music and Drama Art) in all disciplines up to Grade 8.\n\nTheatre visits and workshops\n\nEach year we run a number of trips for various year groups to see exciting productions. These range from West End Musicals to smaller productions in fringe venues. We also arrange for theatre companies to perform in our own Centenary theatre and arrange workshops run by top professionals. They are often a highlight of the Drama calendar.\n\nResidential trips to Edinburgh Festival\n\nEvery two years all sixth formers have the opportunity to perform as a professional company at the largest arts festival in the world; Edinburgh Fringe. In recent years, all productions have received 5-star reviews and the experience of the festival is truly unforgettable.\n\nActor of the year competition\n\nOur annual Actor of the Year competition is a most anticipated event. Students from across the school sign up to perform a short scene, either solo or in a pair. The event is adjudicated by an esteemed judge who presents a number of awards for their favourite performances of the night.\n\nHouse Drama and Performing Arts\n\nThis is a hugely exciting biennial event for all pupils in the Senior School houses. Each house presents a short dramatic programme at the end of their first half term of the academic year. The quality of the performances is extremely high and the atmosphere during the competition is electric.\n\nScript writing\n\nIntroduced last year, we have an annual script writing competition to encourage all you budding writers to have a go.\n\nBut don’t just take our word for it!\n\n“The opportunities that the Berkhamsted drama department offers are endless, from being able to direct and perform I feel I have truly experienced the difference aspects of theatre in such a mature way.” Susie, Year 13.\n\n“I find drama extremely fun and exhilarating. We do lots of drama activities over the year like plays and actor of the year which are really fun to try out your drama skills.” Hannah, Year 8.\n\nSenior School\n\nThe D&T department encourages students to make links with the world beyond the classroom. We want students to see the opportunities for designers and engineers to make a difference to our world and help save the planet.\n\nOpen workshops\n\nThe D&T Department runs open workshop sessions on Wednesday’s at Castle Campus and Thursday’s at Kings Campus. These sessions are predominantly for GCSE and A Level students who want to have access to the facilities to extend their learning and making skills. They are also available to students from Years 7 – 9 upon request. Please note that we have to limit numbers for Health and Safety reasons.\n\n“Having access to the workshops after school has really helped improve my making skills”\n\nTrips\n\nWe enjoy organising trips, such as last year’s visit to the Design Museum. Where students were able to develop their understanding of smart materials in an innovative workshop looking at the various applications this material area has. As well as seeing the main Designer Maker gallery, we also visited the Beazley Designs of the year 2019.\n\n“This exhibition really inspired me to see what is possible in D&T”\n\nCompetitions\n\nThere are many competitions for design, engineering and STEM. We believe these are invaluable to students.\n\nThis Year our Year 7 students all took part in Race to the Line, a national competition, where they worked in teams to develop their own model rocket car. Unfortunately, we had to cancel the school heats and the competition was cancelled for this year due to Covid-19.\n\nThis year we introduced the IET Faraday Challenge where 36 of our students competed in teams of 6 to create and model a solution to the following brief “To design a product to support airbus in the work they do around the world helping people in times of need”\n\nArkwright Engineering Scholarship\n\nThe school is very pleased to be able to offer this prestigious national scholarship opportunity to all Year 11 students. Students who are looking to be engineering leaders of the future will benefit hugely from this 2 year programme that includes industry mentors and access to a range of exclusive alumni experiences. But first they must face a rigorous application process that includes an aptitude exam and a formal interview.\n\nhttp://www.arkwright.org.uk\n\nSixth Form\n\nThe D&T Department is always open to D&T students when there is a teacher present. We also support students taking part in Young Enterprise and those who want to use the facilities to build an artefact for their EPQ.\n\n“Great facilities, particularly for CAD”\n\nTrips\n\nOur Sixth Form students attended the Product Design in Action Conference and really enjoyed hearing from a range of successful designers and hearing their stories and experiences.\n\n“ I didn’t realise there were so many opportunities for a designer to work across a range of fields”\n\nGeneral\n\nWe encourage students to look beyond the classroom and get involved in design and engineering, through various organisations. Here is just a selection of our favourites:\n\nThe Design Museum\n\nThis museum has a thought-provoking permanent display and many interesting exhibitions, workshops and talks. We also recommend the upcoming Beazley Designs of the Year 2019\n\nhttps://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/future-exhibitions/future-exhibitions-and-displays\n\nTomorrow’s Engineers\n\nThis organisation has many interesting student resources on its website as well as a multitude of careers information about the many engineering fields.\n\nhttps://www.tomorrowsengineers.org.uk/\n\nSmallpeice\n\nSmallpeice promote STEM and engineering.

The best reader from each class moves forward to the semi-final. Reading with understanding is essential, as are poise, confidence and clear diction. Simply choose a piece of prose or a favourite poem and practise reading aloud. In the Sixth Form, five students from each A Level class enter this public reading competition. Although you enter as a team, individual prizes are also available for the best male and the best female reader – again with prizes to be presented on Prize Day.\n\nOXBRIDGE COMPETITIONS\n\nRun by Peterhouse College, Cambridge, The Thomas Campion Prize is a prestigious annual competition which requires applicants to research and write an extended essay on an aspect of literature. Over the past few years, several of our students have gone on to study at Oxford or Cambridge, having impressed the judges with their submissions for this award. In addition, students enter the Woolf Essay Prize (Newnham, Cambridge) and the Christopher Marlowe Essay Prize (Corpus Christi, Cambridge).\n\nTHEATRE TRIPS / FILM SCREENINGS\n\nOften these will be organised to give you the chance to see the production of a text you have been studying or a similar one to enhance your appreciation of a genre."
