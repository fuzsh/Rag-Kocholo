        "text": "Pasteurians\n\nPasteurians\n\nPasteur Network\n\nNobel Laureates\n\nLegacy of Louis Pasteur\n\nJoin Us\n\nCore Value & Culture\n\nRecruitment & Welfare\n\nJob Opening\n\nAbout 23,000 Pasteurians in the Pasteur Network are striving to excel in research for our health and our future. Among Pasteurians, ten scientists of Institut Pasteur have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the first dating back to the early 20th century. The distinguished award underlines the outstanding research accomplished by Pasteurians and equally importantly promotes the cause cherished by Louis Pasteur: Applying science for the benefit of all humanity.\n\nAlphonse Laveran\n\n1845-1922\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1907\n\nAlphonse Laveran was France’s first Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine. He discovered the parasite that causes malaria.\n\nIlya Mechnikov (Élie Metchnikoff)\n\n1845-1916\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908\n\nIlya Ilitch Metchnikov discovered phagocytes and phagocytosis in 1883. He is considered the father of cell- mediated immunity as opposed to the humoral immunity observed by Paul Ehrlich. He was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908 with Paul Ehrlich.\n\nJules Bordet\n\n1870-1961\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1919\n\nIn 1919 Jules Bordet was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on the role of antibodies and the complement system. His discoveries expanded early 20th century knowledge of immunology considerably.\n\nCharles Nicolle\n\n1866-1936\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1928\n\nIn 1928 Charles Nicolle won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on typhus. He notably discovered the role of lice in transmission of the infection in humans.\n\nDaniel Bovet\n\n1907-1992\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1957\n\nIn 1957, Swiss-born Daniel Bovet won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries relating to synthetic compounds and their effects on blood vessels and skeletal muscles. He discovered the first antihistamine and the first synthetic curare-like agents. Daniel Bovet pioneered medicinal chemistry.\n\nAndré Lwoff\n\n1902-1994\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1965\n\nThe scientific work of André Lwoff was dominated by two major discoveries: bacterial growth factors and dormant forms of bacterial viruses called prophages. With François Jacob and Jacques Monod he was awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for their discovery relating to the genetic regulation of enzyme and virus synthesis.\"\n\nJacques Monod\n\n1910-1976\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1965\n\nFor Jacques Monod molecular biology was a way to piece together the puzzle explaining the mechanisms shared throughout the living world, from bacteria to complex animals. Inspired by André Lwoff, Jacques Monod worked closely with François Jacob to discover the first genetic regulation system, for which they coined the name operon. Four years after publication of the discovery the three scientists were awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize for Medicine.\n\nFrançois Jacob\n\n1920-2013\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1965\n\nFrançois Jacob worked closely with Jacques Monod, developing the concept of genetic regulation considered revolutionary for the time. The two men were awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with André Lwoff \"for their discovery relating to the genetic regulation of enzyme and virus synthesis.\"\n\nLuc Montagnier\n\n1932-2022\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008\n\nLuc Montagnier was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008 together with Francoise Barre-Sinoussi for the discovery of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), which is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). He served as an Emeritus Professor at the Institut Pasteur, where he was director of the Viral Oncology Unit from 1972 to 2000.\n\nFrançoise Barré-Sinoussi\n\nBorn in 1947\n\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008\n\nFrançoise Barré-Sinoussi won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Luc Montagnier for the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus in 1983. Beyond the work of the scientists, the tireless engagement of a whole community in the fight against HIV is recognized. Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, PhD, is Emeritus Professor at the Institut Pasteur and heads the Regulation of Retroviral Infection Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris."
