        "text": "In the 1950s Jacob was working with a team at the Pasteur Institute that was investigating the properties of the bacterium E-coli, which has evolved rapid ways of altering its metabolism to cope with changes in its environment. Jacob was particularly interested in so-called prophages – viruses that are incorporated into, and can remain dormant in, their E-coli host for generations until certain conditions trigger them to emerge and replicate.\n\nNo one could explain how genes in E-coli or its prophages could be quiescent one moment and active the next, and it was experiments carried out by Jacob’s colleague Jacques Monod which provided the first clues.\n\nThe bacterium’s preferred food source is glucose. But if put in a culture in which the only source of energy is the more complex sugar lactose, then the cells will start consuming lactose instead. In order to metabolise lactose, however, E-coli needs to make certain enzymes. Monod discovered that if he fed E-coli both glucose and lactose, only after all the glucose had been consumed did the E-coli start to produce the lactose-digesting enzymes in large quantities.\n\nIn order to explain this phenomenon, Jacob and Monod isolated mutant E-coli strains (a process which allows scientists to elucidate normal gene functions by studying what happens when they are missing or altered). They reasoned that E-coli carries some other protein molecule that normally prevents the enzyme-encoding genes from becoming active. This molecule became known as the repressor, but as yet they had no idea how it worked.\n\nThen, in 1958, while slumped in a cinema watching a particularly boring film, Jacob allowed his mind to wander, and had a brainwave.\n\nWhen glucose is present, he reasoned, the repressor binds itself to E-coli’s lactose-metabolising genes (later known as the lac operon) keeping them dormant. But when glucose is absent and lactose abundant, the lactose binds to the repressor, changing its shape. As a result it can no longer bind to the lac operon, which then activates, allowing the cell to consume lactose. Maybe, Jacob thought, the process might also explain the behaviour of prophage genes.\n\nThere followed an intense debate with colleagues at the Pasteur Institute that culminated in 1960 in the publication of “Genetic Regulatory Mechanisms in the Synthesis of Proteins” in the Journal of Molecular Biology, in which Jacob and Monod described the basic regulatory concept behind the operation of the lac operon.\n\nJacob and Monod’s unravelling of the lac operon not only introduced a new concept of regulatory sites on DNA, but also the concept of an intermediary molecule between DNA and protein which would account for the rapid production of the lactose-metabolising enzymes. In 1961 they proposed the existence of a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), theorising that the messenger carries the information encoded in the lac operon to ribosomes – the primary site of protein synthesis in the cell – where the code is translated into the sequence of amino acids of a protein.\n\nEvery cell of an organism contains all of its genetic blueprint – the genome – but until Jacob and Monod’s breakthrough, no one knew how cells selectively employ parts of the genome to endow themselves with specific capabilities as, say, liver cells or brain cells. The concept they pioneered, known as “negative gene regulation”, is fundamental to cellular regulation for all organisms and is considered central to the subsequent development of molecular biology.\n\nFrançois Jacob was born in Nancy, eastern France, on June 17 1920, the only child of middle-class Jewish parents. His father was a merchant, while his maternal grandfather had been the first Jewish four-star general in the French Army.\n\nJacob completed only two years of his studies for, on his 20th birthday in 1940, he heard Marshal Pétain’s call for an armistice on a café radio. Four days later he slipped aboard a Polish vessel sailing from Saint-Jean-de-Luz to England, where he signed up to General de Gaulle’s Free French Army.\n\nShipped to sub-Saharan Africa, for the next four years he served as a medical officer in General Leclerc’s 2nd Armoured Division, moving from Chad, through Libya and Tunisia, to Algeria and Morocco.\n\nFollowing the D-Day landings, in August 1944 he landed in Normandy, but a week later, as his division moved south toward Le Mans, Jacob was badly wounded when a German fragmentation bomb exploded beside him as he was giving aid to a mortally wounded comrade. So, instead of entering Paris in triumph with his comrades, Jacob arrived in an ambulance and spent the next few months convalescing in Val-de-Grace Hospital.\n\nDischarged from the hospital and the Army, still partially crippled and with metal splinters in his body, Jacob felt out of place in the French post-war environment. Surrounded by former fellow students who had stayed in France and advanced their medical careers, he found his decorations for bravery (he was awarded the Cross of Liberation, as well as the Légion d’honneur and Croix de Guerre) were little help in the job market. His dream of becoming a surgeon had to be abandoned because of his wounds, and although he qualified in medicine in 1947, he found his career opportunities blocked since he had not followed the “proper” path from hospital “externe” to “interne”.\n\nAfter a few unhappy years in which he tried his hand at journalism, filmmaking and work in a penicillin production facility, in 1950 Jacob managed to talk himself into a fellowship at the Pasteur Institute, where he went to work in the “attic’’ presided over by André Lwoff.\n\nJacob became laboratory director at the Pasteur Institute in 1956 and four years later was appointed head of its new department of cell genetics, where he remained until his retirement in 1991.\n\nWhen he, Lwoff and Monod won the Nobel Prize in 1965, it was the first time in 30 years that French scientists had won a Nobel in any of the sciences. The prestige this brought enabled the three men, known to their colleagues as the Three Musketeers, to press the case for radical changes in the French Science Academy, as a result of which much dead wood holding France back from scientific achievement was cleared away.\n\nJacob was Professor of Cellular Genetics at the College of France from 1965 to 1992. He was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society in London in 1973.\n\nHe later devoted his attention to genetic analysis of the mechanisms of cell division and the genetic properties of mammalian cells. He also proved himself to be a man of considerable literary as well as scientific talent.\n\nHis La Logique du Vivant (1970, published in English as The Logic of Life in 1976), was a scholarly, historico-philosophical account of pre-Mendelian studies on the processes of heredity, and won positive reviews from both historians and philosophers of science. In 1987 he published a beautifully-written autobiography, La Statue Intérieure (published in English as The Statue Within).\n\nIn 1947 Jacob married the pianist Lise Bloch, with whom he had four children. She died in 1983, and in 1999 he married Geneviève Barrier."
