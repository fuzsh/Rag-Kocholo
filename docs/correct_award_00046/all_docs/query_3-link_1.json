        "text": "François Jacob (born June 17, 1920, Nancy, France—died April 19, 2013, Paris) was a French biologist who, together with André Lwoff and Jacques Monod, was awarded the 1965 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for discoveries concerning regulatory activities in bacteria.\n\nJacob received an M.D. degree (1947) and a doctorate in science (1954) from the University of Paris. Most of the work of Jacob, Lwoff, and Monod was carried out at the Pasteur Institute (Paris), which Jacob joined in 1950 as a research assistant. In 1960 he became head of the department of cellular genetics at the institute, and from 1965 he was also professor of cellular genetics at the Collège de France. In 1977 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science\n\nWith a coworker at the Pasteur Institute, Jacob discovered that the genes of a bacterium are arranged linearly in a ring and that the ring can be broken at almost any point. In 1958 Monod and Jacob began to collaborate on studies of the regulation of bacterial enzyme synthesis. One of their first major contributions was the discovery of regulator genes (operons), so called because they control the activities of structural genes. The latter, in turn, not only transmit hereditary characteristics but also serve in the production of enzymes, other proteins, and ribonucleic acid (RNA)."
