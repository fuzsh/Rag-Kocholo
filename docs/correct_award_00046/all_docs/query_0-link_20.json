Gaining this knowledge requires fundamental research across different organisms that can lead to translational impacts in biotechnology and biomedicine. NSF is proud to have recognized the importance and potential power of David Julius' research with a Presidential Young Investigators award in 1990.\n\n2017\n\nJEFFREY C. HALL | MICHAEL ROSBASH | MICHAEL W. YOUNG\n\n“For their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm.”\n\nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded jointly to Jeffrey C. Hall and Michael Rosbash of Brandeis University and Michael W. Young of Rockefeller University in New York. Scientists had known that humans and other organisms have an internal \"biological clock,\" but these researchers shed light on how that clock works. The biological clock enables organisms to adapt their physiologies to the phases of the day and affects everything from behavior to metabolism. Hall and Robash received NSF support through grants from the Office of International Science and Engineering (8021519, 8018839) and Robash received an additional award from the Biological Sciences Directorate (8801552).
