        "text": "Social psychologist Jennifer L. Eberhardt to be awarded the 2022 Lewis Thomas Prize\n\nMarch 17, 2022\n\nFor over two decades, Jennifer L. Eberhardt has demonstrated, with hard data, the extensive and inescapable nature of hidden racial biases. She has also developed strategies to correct these damaging attitudes and the behaviors that result from them. In her book Biased: Uncovering the Hidden Prejudice That Shapes What We See, Think, and Do, Eberhardt weaves experimental and observational studies with personal stories from her experience as an African American woman and mother, bringing to life the prejudice that pervades our society.\n\nFor her accomplished record in applying rigorous scientific methods to the behavioral study of race, and her exceptional storytelling, Eberhardt will be presented with the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science on April 7.

Instead, Prum posits that females’ preference for the most stimulating, attractive males is what drives the evolution of many of the most elaborate and extraordinary traits in animals.\n\nFor his exceptional writing, Prum was presented with the 2021 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science last week. The prize, established by the trustees of Rockefeller in 1993, honors scientists as inspirational authors.

Siddhartha Mukherjee has won acclaim for the sensitive and caring treatment he delivers to his patients, and for his innovative cancer biology research. But what has ultimately made him a household name is his work as a science writer, especially his debut piece chronicling the past, present, and possible future of the disease.\n\nMukherjee has delighted, informed, and touched a wide audience through his books and essays, for which he will be awarded the 2019 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. The prize, honoring scientists as inspirational authors, will be presented Monday, April 22, at a free, public event on The Rockefeller University campus.

But even as Dr. Thorne has ventured into the theoretical complexities of the universe, he has successfully brought the rest of us along. With deft explanations and depictions, he draws people into the space-, time-, and mind-bending realm of Einstein’s ideas through books, talks, and films.\n\nFor all this, Thorne will be awarded the 2018 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science, which honors scientists as inspirational authors. He will receive the award Tuesday, April 17, 2018, at a free, public event on The Rockefeller University campus. A reception will begin at 5:30 p.m., followed by the prize presentation and a lecture at 6:30 p.m. More>>\n\nOceanographer and explorer Sylvia Earle will receive the 2017 Lewis Thomas Prize\n\nFebruary 22, 2017\n\nOceanographer, explorer, and author Sylvia Earle has been named the recipient of this year’s Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. The award, given annually by Rockefeller University, recognizes Earle’s body of work, which includes memoirs, atlases, and children’s books, as well as advocacy for global marine conservation. Earle will be presented with the award at a ceremony on March 6.\n\nEvolutionary Biologist Sean B. Carroll Wins Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing About Science\n\nMay 5, 2016\n\n“How many true books about science include a coded message from occupied Hungary, written in invisible starch solution on the inside of a record album to be revealed by exposure to iodine?”\n\nJesse Ausubel, who chairs the selection committee for Rockefeller’s Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science, recently asked this question about Sean B. Carroll’s 2013 book Brave Genius: A Scientist, A Philosopher, and Their Daring Adventures from the French Resistance to the Nobel Prize. For this and other works, Dr. Carroll, an evolutionary biologist, film producer, and author, was awarded the 2016 Lewis Thomas Prize at a ceremony in Caspary Auditorium on March 14.\n\nMathematicians Steven Strogatz and Ian Stewart Win Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing About Science\n\nAugust 21, 2015\n\nIt takes a particular breadth of mind to succeed in bridging the world of advanced science and the world of letters. But perhaps even more unusual is the mathematician who can translate complex numerical investigations into poetry, comedy, suspense, and mystery for readers untrained in the field.\n\nIan Stewart and Steven Strogatz have spent their careers doing just this, and earlier this year, they became the first mathematicians to receive the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science at a ceremony in Rockefeller’s Caspary Auditorium.\n\nLewis Thomas Prize to honor mathematicians Steven Strogatz and Ian Stewart\n\nMarch 13, 2015\n\nTwo mathematicians, Ian Stewart and Steven Strogatz, will share the 2015 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science awarded by The Rockefeller University. Stewart, from The University of Warwick and Gresham College in the United Kingdom, and Strogatz, from Cornell, are the first mathematicians to receive the prize. They will be honored during a program featuring actor Alan Alda, an advocate for science, on Monday, March 30, in Rockefeller’s Caspary Auditorium.\n\nPsychologist and Author Kay Redfield Jamison Awarded 2012 Lewis Thomas Prize\n\nJanuary 31, 2014\n\nThere has always been a fine line between madness and genius. As a clinical psychologist, Kay Redfield Jamison has been able to examine that line from a scientific perspective; and as a writer, she has shared both her scientific and personal findings on mental illness with the public. For her work, Dr. Jamison was presented with the 2012 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science at a ceremony in Caspary Auditorium in June. The award recognized Dr. Jamison’s 1993 book Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament, which examines the relationship between artistic creativity and mood disorders.\n\nMartin Rees is 2009 Lewis Thomas Prize winner\n\nMay 14, 2010\n\nFor as long as humans have gazed at the night sky, we have questioned our place in the universe and how and where it all began. Martin Rees, the celebrated British cosmologist and astrophysicist, has chronicled scientists’ speculations about the cosmos through seven volumes of popular science. On April 26, President Paul Nurse presented Dr. Rees with the 2009 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science. The prize recognizes Dr. Rees’s 2000 publication Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces that Shape the Universe.\n\nRockefeller University names Martin Reese 2009 Lewis Thomas Prize Winner\n\nApril 8, 2010\n\nFor as long as humans have gazed at the night sky, we have questioned our place in the universe and how and where it all began.

When, for young Robert Morris Sapolsky, such lofty aspirations proved less than feasible, he decided on the next most exciting life — becoming a scientist. Upon graduating with a Ph.D. from The Rockefeller University in 1984, Dr. Sapolsky began what would become a lifelong, passionate pursuit studying the baboons of the East African Serengeti Plain. The fruit of that labor, a book aptly titled A Primate’s Memoir: A Neuroscientist’s Unconventional Life Among the Baboons, has won numerous awards. At a ceremony in Caspary Auditorium on June 2, Rockefeller added to the acclaim with the 2008 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science.\n\nLewis Thomas Prize awarded to Richard Dawkins\n\nMay 25, 2007\n\nThe committee that nominates and selects recipients of the Lewis Thomas Prize does not have an easy job; few people eloquently straddle the fields of science and literature. But there was little debate over Richard Dawkins, British ethologist and popular science writer, who was presented with the 2006 Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science April 24.\n\nOliver Sacks, Awakenings Author, Receives Rockefeller University’s Lewis Thomas Prize\n\nMarch 22, 2002\n\nOliver Sacks, author of the best-selling book Awakenings, which was the basis for a movie of the same name starring Robin Williams and Robert de Niro, received The Rockefeller University’s 2001 Lewis Thomas Prize on Monday, March 18, in the university’s Caspary Auditorium. The prize, “Honoring the Scientist as Poet,” has been awarded annually since 1993 to a writer who is accomplished in the realms of both science and literature."
