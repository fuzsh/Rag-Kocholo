        "text": "DNA\n\nDefinition\n\nDNA is a complex, long-chained molecule that contains the genetic blueprint for building and maintaining all living organisms. Found in nearly all cells, DNA carries the instructions needed to create proteins, specific molecules essential to the development and functioning of the body. It also transfers hereditary information between generations.\n\nThis vial contains some of the first DNA Friedrich Miescher isolated from salmon sperm. It is in the possession of the University of Turbingen, Germany. Credit: Alfons Renz.\n\nImportance\n\nDNA is central to biotechnology and medicine by virtue of the fact that it not only provides the basic blueprint for all life, it is a fundamental determinant of how the body functions and the disease process. Understanding the structure and function of DNA has helped revolutionise the investigation of disease pathways, assess an individual’s genetic susceptibility to specific diseases, diagnose genetic disorders, and formulate new drugs. It is also critical to the identification of pathogens.\n\nAside from its medical uses, the fact that DNA is unique to each individual makes it a vital forensic tool identifying criminals, the remains of a missing person, and determining the biological parent of a child. Within agriculture DNA is also used to help improve animal livestock and plants.\n\nDiscovery\n\nThe discovery of DNA stretches back to 1869, when Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss physician and biologist, began examining leucocytes, a type of white blood cell, he had sourced from pus collected on fresh surgical bandages. This he did while working in the laboratory of Felix Hoppe-Seyler in Tubingen, Germany as part of project to determine the chemical building blocks of cells. On looking through the microscope he observed that a substance separated from the solution of the cells whenever he added an acid and then dissolved again once alkali was added. The compound bore no resemblance to any known protein. Believing the substance to originate from the nuceli of the cell, Miescher nicknamed it 'nuclein'. On investigating further he discovered nuclein to be present in many other tissues. While possessing only simple tools and methods, by 1874 Miescher had come close to working out the genetic role of nuclein. He lacked sufficient communication skills, however, to convey the importance of what he had found to the wider scientific world.\n\nIn 1881 Albrecht Kossel, a German biochemist, renamed Miescher's compound deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) based on the fact that he had discovered it to be a nucleic acid. Following this, he began working out its chemical composition. By 1901 he determined it to be made up of five nitrogen bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T) and uracil (U).\n\nFor many decades DNA remained little studied because it was assumed to be an inert substance incapable of carrying genetic material because of its simple structure. Proteins were instead thought to be the carriers of genetic material. In part this was because they had a more complex structure, being made up of 20 different amino acids.\n\nIt would not be until the mid 20th century that attitudes towards DNA began to change. This was prompted by the work of Oswald Avery at Rockefeller Institute in New York. From the early 1930s, Avery began to investigate how a type of non-infectious bacteria associated with pneumonia could transform into dangerous virulent forms if mixed with dead cells from the virulent strain and carried this trait into their offspring. The phenomenon had been first observed by Fred Griffith, a British physician, in 1928. By 1944 Avery had demonstrated with the help of his colleagues Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, that the transformation of the bacteria was linked to a stringy white substance – DNA. While not universally accepted at the time, Avery's finding helped kindle a new interest in DNA. It would take another few years before scientists finally accepted that it was DNA, not proteins, that carried DNA. It was finally agreed following experiments conducted by Alfred Hershey and Martha Hershey at Cold Spring Harbor in 1952.\n\nBy the 1950s a number of researchers had begun to investigate the structure of DNA in the hope that this would reveal how the molecule worked. Its structure was finally unveiled in 1953 through the combined efforts of the biophysicists Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, based at King's College London, and Francis Crick and James Watson based in the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University. Their work determined DNA to be a long linear molecule made up of two strands coiled around each other in a spiral configuration later known as the 'double helix'. Each strand was made up of four complementary nucleotides, chemical subunits: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T). The two strands were oriented in opposite directions so that adenine always joined thymines (A T) and cytosines were linked with guanines (C G). Watson and Crick argued this structure helped each strand to reconstruct the other and facilitate the passing on of hereditary information.\n\nApplication\n\nThe analysis of DNA is pivotal to understanding both the biological mechanisms of life and diseases that arise when this process goes wrong. Many different applications have been developed to understand this process. Today scientists can analyse the molecule through a range of techniques, including DNA sequencing which helps work out its structure, through to PCR, which rapidly amplifies tiny quantities of DNA into billions of copies. Such techniques underpin all tests carried out today to for example identify a genetic mutation that causes cancer, or to determine whether a person carries a gene for a hereditary disease that can be passed on to their offspring. In addition, scientists have found ways to manipulate and construct new forms of DNA, known as recombinant DNA or gene cloning. Such technology is crucial to the mass production of many drugs, such as interferon, and the development of gene therapy.\n\nDNA: timeline of key events"
