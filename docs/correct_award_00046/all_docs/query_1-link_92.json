        "text": "I. Biology at the Margins of Philosophy\n\nThe main thesis of Francesco Vitale's Biodeconstruction, as stated on the first page, seems to be a provocation to anyone even remotely acquainted with Derrida's work. In this new book, Vitale holds that the main concern of deconstruction is life. He writes: \"we shall consider the investigation of life not only an issue of deconstruction but the latter's very matrix\" (2018, 1).\n\nThe word \"life\" in the quote above does not mean exclusively and primarily human existence. The term also refers to the object of the life sciences, that is, [End Page 129] the evolving and developing systems that are studied in labs. And this is striking for at least two reasons: first, because Derrida's references to the life sciences are extremely rare, the only notable exception being a portion of an unpublished seminar from 1975, \"La vie la mort,\" on which Vitale's Biodeconstruction relies substantially. Apart from this one exception, no major concept in Derrida's philosophy is developed in the context of analyses of the life sciences. Second: affirming that life—or anything else—is the matrix of deconstruction is per se highly controversial, as deconstruction consists in the practice of disarticulating all theoretical architectures built upon thematic centers, foundational bases, defined distinctions, and conceptual hierarchies. Deconstruction seeks to recognize how and to what extent suppletive, derived, and even marginal components determine the functioning of any theoretical system.\n\nBut to decree in advance that the proper to Derrida's philosophy is to have nothing proper, and its center to have no center, would be a clumsy gesture, verging on self-contradiction—and surely the first step toward installing a deconstructionist police intent upon hunting down any inclination or tendency to centralization. Derrida knows full well that there will always be conceptual cores, signifying poles, dominant distinctions, systematization, and the like. If he constantly encourages his followers to be vigilant and to prevent deconstruction from turning into a hierarchical body of doctrine, this is because he recognizes that any philosophical discourse naturally tends toward this direction. What practice of argumentation, of analysis, of discussion, or of communication could possibly avoid it? The deconstructionist's point of view seems to be that no central structure, no matrix is immune to what happens in its margins, in its periphery. Components that are marginal or peripheral determine, from their very marginality and by virtue of it, the functioning of the center. Margins are essential to the center—but the understanding of this formula supposes the destabilization of classical, simple, purified notions of essence and identity.\n\nConsequently, the same reasons that make Vitale's main thesis controversial and implausible in fact justify its relevance. Recall that the core of his proposal concerns a corpus that is likely to be one of the most rare or marginal in Derrida's published as well as unpublished work: the part of the 1975 [End Page 130] seminar on \"La vie la mort\" where Derrida engages in a critical interpretation of François Jacob's The Logic of Life. As far as I know, there is no evidence that Derrida ever planned to revise this material for publication. In the following years, other portions of the 1975 seminar will appear in different texts—all but the one concerning Jacob's The Logic of Life.\n\nFrançois Jacob (1920–2013) was a French biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1965. The Logic of Life (1970) is praised worldwide as a masterpiece in the field of scientific dissemination and offers one of the first and most accomplished philosophical elaborations of the molecular vision of life. In Biodeconstruction, Vitale convincingly shows that Derrida's analysis of Jacob's text, in spite of its marginality, is central to understanding the emergence and evolution of several key ideas on life and the living that will increasingly gain Derrida's attention, namely the ideas of \"survival\" or \"living-on\" (survie) and those associated to..."
