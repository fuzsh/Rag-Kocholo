        "text": "March 29, 2016\n\nJacob traces the history of thinking about the nature of life. He goes from Mind-God’s design, to preformation, to mechanism and reductionism, to vitalism, and to cell theory, heredity and natural selection. Cell theory is the beginning of what Jacob sees as a scientific view of life. Cells can be autonomous or they can combine as parts of larger wholes (organs, organisms). In contrast to reductionism and mechanism, and the mysterious holism of vitalism, cell theory integrates parts and wholes so that they function together, as a self-organizing capacity in support of life and replication (i.e., internal coordination of parts and wholes; external coordination with the environment – to obtain energy, and thereby to counter the force of entropy, and to provide barriers against outside threats). Cell theory then moved to genes and heredity, the memory of the species, and genes and heredity perpetuate that memory through replication, and individual variation that is created by random mutation (“without any relation between cause and result”), which is the raw material that is acted upon by natural selection.* When variation is valuable vis-à-vis a particular environment, it is preserved and those beneficial traits spread to become species traits.\n\nAs to how this came about, Jacob writes of the continuity of the origin of life with inorganic matter. More than most others, he sees a seamless transition between the inorganic world of chemistry and bonding with the organic world that is life. “Recognition of the unity of physical and chemical processes,” Jacob writes, “has deprived vitalism of its raison d’etre.” He goes on to state that “Biologists no longer study life today. They no longer attempt to define it. Instead, they investigate the structure of living systems, their functions, their history.” He writes further that the “recognition of the purpose of living systems means that biology can no longer be studied without constant reference to the ‘plan’ of organization…an attitude obviously very different from the reductionism that was long dominant.”** Common to both is the capacity for self-organization, of like molecules matching up with like molecules. In the inorganic world, this is seen best in crystal formation that involves “a union of like units, a geometry strictly ordered by the forces which arrange and unite identical molecules.”*** What life adds is the capacity for molecules to replicate and once that happens, life on earth took off to become what we see today. With this scientifically-based outlook, Jacob says we’ve arrived at a surprisingly simple perspective on the origin and nature of life: “The living being does indeed represent the execution of a plan, but not one conceived in any mind. It strives towards a goal, but not one chosen by any will. The aim is to prepare an identical programme for the following generation. The aim is to reproduce.”\n\n“Memory” and “information” do not convey the significance of the genetic core. It’s the brain of the species. It’s the “pre-formed being” of the individual; it is the design of what the individual is to become. This all starts at the level of the gene which first directs the formation of the structural and regulatory proteins that build and operate body structure. “The gene gives orders. The protein executes them,” Jacob writes. Later, Jacob states this notion as “the power to do and the power to direct what is done.” This genetic core is invariant, immune from the environment; it changes only through chance errors in the replication process. The genetic core is the norm of the species and the norm of the individual. Regulation occurs against this norm. Regulation Jacob writes governs that space between “what must be done” and “what is actually being done.” The norm for each organism is set and how that norm is reached and maintained in our interactions with the environment and the individual choices we make is flexible.**** Life is tightly tied to a norm that tells it what to do and, largely, how to do it. There are, in other words, multiple ways to get to the “end” but it is the end that directs the means.\n\nLife’s organization has a logic that exists both at “horizontal” and “vertical” scales, Jacob argues. Life builds on what has gone before and integrates the new with the old. “Organisms are built by a series of integrations. Each stage is formed “by the integration of sub-units” that Jacob calls “integrons.” The logic of the organism (how life operates internally and externally in the environment) and the logic of its evolution, which is how it came to be this way over time, is almost a deductive logic. It’s the unfolding of life, of species through time and of the individual at any point in time, as contained in its genetic core. Genetic instructions are the “algorithms of the living world.”\n\nIn elaborating on his concept of “integrons” Jacob’s notion seems similar to Dawkins’ extended phenotype. Our genetic core is expressed outward and is embodied in our various human creations: “From family organization to modern state, from ethnic group to coalition of nations, a whole series of integrations is based on a variety of cultural, moral, social, political, economic, military and religious codes. The history of mankind is more or less the history of these integrons and the way they form and change.”\n\nThis is a terrific history of life, though I have two questions about the vision Jacob puts forward. Throughout the book, he makes references to life as reacting to the environment, as if the organism and we are passive beings that only respond to what the environment sends our way. Though this may be merely a terminology issue, it also seems to be at odds with the picture he presents of our genetic nature and its unfolding in time (in evolutionary history, and in individual development). We are first and foremost beings that act, that are designed to act, in the world, and part of that acting in the world is to modify our activity based on what the environment requires. Our interaction is dialectical. Interaction starts both with the subject-thesis acting in the world, as well as the subject-antithesis that reacts to what the environment is doing. The second question I have is whether the genetic program allows for flexibility. As presented by Jacob and Jacques Monod (Chance and Necessity), the genetic instructions are strictly binary, yes-no, actions/reactions, though Piaget and others seem to allow more flexibility and more adjustment based on feedback from the environment, than what Jacob puts forward.\n\nWith life comes death, and Jacob has a few words to say about this. Mutations occur in the somatic (body) cells as well as in the germ (sexual) cells, and eventually these accumulate (“senescence as the result of accumulated errors”) to the point where organisms and organization breaks down and the body can no longer maintain itself. This seems straightforward enough, with death being a “by-product” of the negative effects of “accumulated errors.” Jacob’s description, though, makes it seem like death is necessary for evolution: “The other necessary condition for the very possibility of evolution is death. Not death from without, as the result of some accident; but death imposed from within, as a necessity prescribed from the egg onward by the genetic programme itself. For evolution is the result of a struggle between what was and what is to be….with sexual reproduction, individuals have to disappear.” I can’t say I understood what Jacob is saying here.\n\n*Jacob says natural selection acts at three levels – on the gene itself; on the individual; and on the species, “considered as the sum of all the genes belonging to all the individuals in the species.”\n\n**Jacob writes, “Just to hear one of the leaders in quantum mechanics asking, ‘“What is life?’ and then describing heredity in terms of molecular structures, inter-atomic bonds and thermodynamic stability was enough to fire the enthusiasm of certain young physicists….Their ambition and interest were limited to a single problem: the physical basis of genetic information.”\n\n***At the lowest levels of life, Jacob writes that “the integration of the bacterial cell is based solely on the properties of certain proteins, on their ability to recognize other molecular species selectively.”\n\n****“Ethologists consider that when behavior involves acquired experience, it is dependent on the genetic programme. Learning comes into the framework fixed by heredity.” This statement can be interpreted by some to apply to animal, not to humans who have free will. Yet, it can also mean that while our fundamental life ends are fixed (needs), how we achieve such ends is variable and involves some degree of free choice. It’s the distinction between “how do do” versus “what to do.” Clearly humans have greater free choice than animals. What is not clear, and what Jacob does not discuss particularly, is the degree to which the choices we make are influenced by genetic predisposition"
