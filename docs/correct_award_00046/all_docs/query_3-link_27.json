Nobel Prize recipients are required to provide an autobiographical statement, which can be found on their website (http://www.nobelprize.org). When comparing these two autobiographical works, one finds radical differences in structure and content. I examine here how Jacob approaches the following elements in each work: passage of time, his involvement in World War II, and his family.",
