        "text": "The goal of the Food Safety Program’s enforcement guide is to have and maintain a progressive enforcement approach that includes outreach and education which ultimately ensures each facility is in compliance with the Ohio Uniform Food Code.\n\nA facility may be placed into the enforcement program when there are critical or repeat violations that go uncorrected. If at any given inspection, uncorrected critical violations exist, a follow-up inspection may be performed. If at the time of the follow-up inspection, those violations or additional violations are present, the facility may be placed into the enforcement program. This may include increased inspections, an administrative hearing, or referral to the Board of Health for additional enforcement actions which may include suspension, revocation or placing restrictions on the food license.\n\nPlease contact the food safety program or designated inspector for specific questions regarding our enforcement procedures."
