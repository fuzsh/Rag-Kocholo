        "text": "The Master of Public Health (MPH) is our most flexible degree. With 12 concentrations to choose from, students can tailor their degree to their unique goals while completing classes at their own pace on campus, fully online, or a mix of the two.\n\nWe are accepting applications for the online/part-time format starting in November 2024 or January 2025.\n\nThe Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) is a professional degree alternative to the Master of Public Health (MPH) degree for students who want more focused skills in a specific field of public health or who lack two years of health-related work experience to begin or advance a career as a public health professional. MSPH programs generally require one academic year of coursework, followed by a field placement. The field placement duration and location vary by department/concentration."
