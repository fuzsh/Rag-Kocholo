        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nA country’s food industry is a significant contributor to food security as it is an important supplier of food to the population.1 The Republic Act (RA) No. 7394 or the Consumer Act of the Philippines enforces compulsory labelling, and fair packaging to enable consumers to obtain accurate information as to the nature, quality, and quantity of the contents of consumer products and facilitate comparison of the value of such products.2 Moreover, the Department of Health Administrative Order No. 2014-0030 or the Revised Rules and Regulations Governing the Labelling of Pre-packaged Food Products mandates label information to include the product name or name of food, use of brand name or trademark, a complete list of ingredients, net contents and drained weight, name, and address of the manufacturer, repacker, packer, importer, trader and distributor, lot identification, storage condition, and expiry or expiration date or use-by-date/consume before date.\n\nNutrition labelling, meanwhile, is a system of describing food products based on their selected nutrient content. It aims to provide accurate nutrition information about each food which is printed on food labels as nutrition facts. It is a population-level nutrition communication device at the point of purchase with the information needed to meet the nutritional guidelines of a particular population group.3 The use of nutrition labels has been associated with healthier food choices such as calorie intake, and other nutrients.3-6 Nutrition labelling is still voluntary in the Philippines. However, the Food and Drug Administration issued Circular No. 2021-015 for the voluntary declaration of front-of-pack labelling for energy or caloric content on the labels of processed food products. In 2022, Senate Bill 576 or Traffic Light Nutritional Labelling Scheme on Food Packaging Act and House Bill 1139 or An Act Mandating the Use of Health Star Rating System on the Labels of Packaged Food Products were proposed in the Philippine Congress to mandate the use of different nutrition label formats.7-8\n\nThe awareness in and practice of reading nutrition labels questionnaire among adult consumers is part of the government program participation survey component of the National Nutrition Survey (NNS) and Updating Surveys done by the Department of Science and Technology – Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI). Although the proportion of respondents in the surveys reading food product labels is reported, little is known about the socio-demographic characteristics of those who read always, sometimes, or not at all. This affects their use of food labels as an information and communication tool on nutrition from packaged foods.\n\nThus, this study aimed to describe the socio-demographic characteristics of adult consumers aged 18 years old and above reading food product labels and nutrition facts based on the 2018-2019 survey data in the Philippines. It also determined the likelihood that consumers will not read food product labels and be influenced by nutrition facts when buying food. This will provide insights on consumers’ understanding and usage of food labels and nutrition facts that will help in designing better label formats in packaged foods and other related consumer health education campaigns.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study looked at the socio-demographic characteristics of Filipino adult consumers and the practice of reading food product labels and nutrition facts and found that almost half do not read food labels and less than a fifth read nutrition facts.\n\nFood product labels protect consumers from possible harm through the information on its place of origin and ingredients that should be avoided by people with food restrictions or allergies as well as nutrients the products contain.3,5,6,11 However, based on the results, almost half of Filipino adult consumers do not read food product labels which may make them miss out on information that could be harmful to them especially if they have underlying health conditions.\n\nThe proportion of adults as well as adult consumers who reported reading nutrition facts in the Philippines was low compared to other countries such as in New Zealand, the USA, or Canada where the percentage of self-reported nutrition label use was high.12 There was no existing law yet in the Philippines requiring manufacturers, packagers, or distributors to indicate the nutrition information of food products on the labels except the FDA Circular 2021-015 that set guidelines for the voluntary declaration of front-of-pack labelling for energy or calorie content of processed foods. Although, house and senate bills in the Philippine Congress have been submitted to make nutrition labelling mandatory.13-15 Moreover, the Philippines is currently experiencing a stagnation in its efforts to implement a more comprehensive front-of-pack labelling.16\n\nSimilar to the results of this study, it was found that there were more consumers in Madrid, Spain reported reading nutrition labels occasionally than regularly before purchasing a product,17 while it was found in another study that 70% of Chinese participants claimed to rarely or never read nutrition labels when shopping for food.18\n\nAccording to a study conducted among selected adults in the Philippines, the utilization of nutrition labels was found to be associated with certain factors such as having an intention to use them, perceiving sufficient time for shopping, and seeking out specific information.19 In contrast, a systematic study revealed that individuals refrain from reading product labels due to lack of time, small size of print on packages, difficulty in comprehending technical terms, and concerns about the accuracy of the information provided.20 These reasons for not reading product labels were also noted in this study.\n\nAlthough this study did not examine the comprehension or correct understanding of nutrition labels, it is important to utilize the information and influence of dietary choices. A previous study conducted in Canada highlighted that people struggle with understanding nutrition label information, including converting serving sizes.6 Yet another study found that higher levels of health knowledge have a positive effect on information acquisition from media sources, including reading nutrition labels.21 Additionally, a review study found some evidence supporting a positive relationship between label use and knowledge,22 while some found no evidence supporting this relationship. 23\n\nHaving higher education has been reported as a significant factor in reading nutrition labels. This was also observed in the current study, where the proportion of individuals who read food product labels increases as educational attainment increases.3,5,6,24,25\n\nThere has been no consensus on the effect of age, income, or working status on nutritional label use.26 Meanwhile, consistent with previous similar research,4,5,12,16,26 this study showed that females were more likely to read product labels than males.\n\nIn a similar study, it was found that more than half of the participants did not rely on nutrition information when making their food choices while shopping. Moreover, the study revealed that only 9.3% of consumers claimed using nutrition knowledge when shopping.27 In contrast to the previous study, our study found that a low proportion of adult consumers read nutrition facts. However, our findings indicate a positive correlation between reading nutrition facts and purchasing behavior. The use of nutrition labels affects purchasing behavior mainly because consumers want to avoid certain nutrients or those which they want to reduce consumption, and these effects might be even greater if labelling were combined with an information campaign to educate consumers.11,28,29\n\nA study in New Zealand found that participants who viewed the labels and subsequently purchased the products were significantly healthier than those who viewed the labels but did not purchase the products.29 While label use does not guarantee healthier consumption, it has the potential to alter dietary patterns and contribute to better dietary intake by reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods. For example, using food labels to choose high-fiber foods was associated with higher consumption of fruits and vegetables or low sodium which was associated with a lower intake of salty snacks.28\n\nThis study found that those who are working as professionals, technicians and associates, officials of government and special organizations, entrepreneurs and managers, and clerks were likely the ones who read product labels, in contrast with other results where retired persons were reported to read more and have a full understanding of nutrition labels.17\n\nEven though some studies showed that the provision of nutrition information affects product attitude and purchase intention,30-32 others found that providing information about energy density or other nutritional information did not affect overall energy and fat intake33 or inconclusive association between label use and diet.34\n\nSeveral studies have established that nutrient information does indeed influence food choices.35-37 There are suggestions that label usage is primarily practiced by individuals who are obese, rather than as a health-promoting habit.37 Consumers also have difficulty handling quantitative information such as the interpretation of percentages in nutrition labels.36,38 As in this study, 10.1% of consumers do not read product labels because they cannot understand them.\n\nPeople placing high importance on nutrition are more likely to use nutritional labels17 or to use specific nutrient information.23 As seen in this study, those who have higher educational attainment, with occupations such as government officials, managers, entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians, and clerks, and those belonging to higher wealth status were associated with reading product labels and nutrition facts. However, even among those who reported reading food product labels and calorie information, no significant differences in energy adequacy were observed. This is similar to a study in Malaysia, which showed no association between label reading and nutritional status.39\n\nMoreover, this study showed that older persons (60 years and above), those who have no or low level of education, belonged to poorer households, and whose occupations are in agriculture, are laborers and unskilled workers, craft and related trade work, plant and machine operators, students, pensioners, and have no occupation were more likely not reading food product labels and not influenced by nutrition facts. This implies the need for food label format that would cater to those who cannot or have difficulty reading food labels and nutrition facts. There is also a need for an intensive consumer education, and nutrition and health campaign on reading food product labels.\n\nLimitations\n\nThis study used only secondary data from the survey, thus, other factors that could affect understanding of and motivations in reading nutrition labels were not probed. It also did not ask about the frequency of buying food products with labels as well as the amount of food consumed from products with labels that could affect their dietary intakes and may be explored in further studies. However, the results of the study remain valuable in designing new food labels and nutrition facts formats as well as a consumer education campaign to promote reading and understanding food product labels."
