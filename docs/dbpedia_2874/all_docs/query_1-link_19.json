        "text": "Government Authority\n\nMedical Device regulations in the Philippines are administered by the Center for Device Regulation, Radiation Health and Research (CDRRHR) within the Department of Health. With efforts to harmonize the Philippine Regulatory Guidelines in accordance with the ASEAN Medical Devices Directive, the Philippines Department of Health recently released Administrative Order 2018-0002. The Administrative Order introduces risk classification of medical devices, as well as new requirements for initial device registration and renewal.\n\nMedical Device Status\n\nInstruments, machines, in vitro reagents, software and similar or related articles that make therapeutic or medical claims are considered Medical Devices in the Philippines.\n\nProduct Classification\n\nThe current product classifications are harmonized according to the ASEAN Medical Devices Directive with four classes A, B, C and D ranked from low to high risk categorization. The new review time and registration fees vary by risk categorization:\n\nIn addition to Home/Reference Country Approval, Notifications and Registrations require technical documentation in accordance with the CSDT Template. Notifications require a device description, Certificate of Conformity, Declaration of Conformity, Declaration of Shelf Life and clear, complete, colored pictures of the labeling. Registrations require additional documentation such as risk assessments and clinical evidence.\n\nQuality Systems Conformity Assessment\n\nClass A, B, C and D devices all require ISO 13485 or an audit report from the FDA or Japanese PMDA to certify the quality system of the legal and/or actual manufacturing facilities.\n\nGood Distribution Practice of Medical Devices (GDPMD) is not currently required in the Philippines but we expect it to become a requirement in the near future.\n\nRegulatory Efficiency\n\nMedical device registration in the Philippines is fairly straightforward and efficient.\n\nExpedited Review Options\n\nAs of September 2022, the Philippines FDA is only providing expedited approval for applications submitted with CSDT documents used for applications submitted and approved in other ASEAN markets. This new process aims to shorten the review time to 30 business days. To learn more about this, please see our blog on the topic here.\n\nExceptions to Home Country Approval Requirement\n\nMedical devices used strictly for research, clinical trial, exhibit and/or donated new are exempt from Notification and Registration. Researchers and institutions using exempt devices must apply for a Certificate of Medical Device Listing.\n\nValidity and Renewal\n\nCMDNs and CMDRs are valid for 5 years, and must be renewed every five years after the initial approval. Renewals can be filed 90 days prior to the expiry of the CMDR or CMDN.\n\nCertificates of Product Registration (CPR) issued under the old rules will remain valid until expiry, at which point a license renewal application will generate a fresh CMDN, valid for 5 years with a fee of PhP 5,150 (US $110). Certificates of Exemption (COE) issued under the old rules will remain valid until November 3, 2021, or two years after issuance (whichever is shorter). To learn more of License Maintenance in the Philippines, click here.\n\nLicense Transfer\n\nFor CMDN/CMDR transfer projects, Asia Actual will request to review a copy of the existing license and the supporting Foreign Agency Agreement. The transfer application requires the original Registration certificate. Asia Actual will assist to obtain this document from the current holder in the Philippines. However, if the current holder does not cooperate, then a full registration process will be required. The license transfer process typically takes 2 to 3 months to process.\n\nDocuments required for the transfer include:\n\nLetter of Request\n\nTermination of Contract / Deed of Assignment\n\nCMDN/CDMR (original)\n\nComplete Labeling set\n\nForeign Agency Agreement\n\nISO 13485 certificate\n\nLicense Holder Requirements\n\nThe License Holder must be involved in the customs clearance process for devices for which it holds the Import License. Competitively bid third-party services (e.g., freight forwarding) are charged on a pass-through basis. A Shipment Report is generated per event to record fees and document receipts. The License to Operate of the importer, distributor or manufacturer must be up-dated with the foreign manufacturing source data.\n\nBenefits of Using Asia Actual as Your Independent License Holder\n\nSell directly to multiple regional distributors, avoiding mark-up by a national importer\n\nIncrease transfer pricing\n\nImprove leverage in distributor negotiations/responses\n\nAdd or change distributors as required\n\nKeep intellectual property away from local commercial agents\n\nAssure expert handling of post market vigilance and license maintenance\n\nContact Asia Actual for assistance with your medical device registration in the Philippines or to confirm the cost and time lines that apply to your specific devices of interest. Asia Actual has experienced, bi-lingual consultants in the Philippines to manage the application, importing, and post-market surveillance needs."
