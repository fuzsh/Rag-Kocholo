Operating a successful food business requires understanding the competition, managing staff, knowledge of regulations and more. Food safety cannot get lost in the shuffle.\n\nInfuse is a program developed by the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department (LLCHD) to help owners, managers of food establishments and vendors maintain proper food safety.\n\nACTIVE MANAGERIAL CONTROL - FIVE KEY RISK FACTORS TO FOODBORNE ILLNESS\n\nActive Managerial Control (AMC) is exactly that—a strategy that combines your leadership with good monitoring, consistent documentation and standard operating procedures to help your facility avoid the trouble and even tragedy foodborne illness can cause.\n\nPOOR PERSONAL HYGIENE\n\nPoor practices related to food handler health and hygiene are the biggest contributor to foodborne illnesses each year. AMCs for this Risk Factor is like a 3-legged stool sustained by 1) good handwashing practice, 2) No Bare Hand Contact with Ready-to-Eat Foods, and 3) exclusion of ill employees while they are communicable with foodborne illness symptoms.\n\nIMPROPER HOLDING\n\nTo keep food safe, hot foods must be kept above 135° F and cold foods must be kept below 41° F. Foods kept between 41-135° F are in the Temperature Danger Zone where they are at the greatest risk to support bacterial growth, which can lead to a foodborne illness. Proactive management to hold food at safe temperatures and to minimize the time in the Temperature Danger Zone is a cornerstone to good Active Managerial Control.\n\nINADEQUATE COOKING\n\nCertain foods, particularly meats, are often contaminated with pathogens and can easily easy support their pathogen growth. To minimize the risk of foodborne illness for these foods proper cooking and reheating are essential to proactively manage this Risk Factor. Cooked foods and leftovers must also be properly cooled to move them quickly through the Temperature Danger Zone.\n\nCONTAMINATED EQUIPMENT\n\nAs a regular part of the food preparation process, food particles end up on prep surfaces. Without regular cleaning and sanitation, pathogens are given the opportunity to grow, which can lead to contamination of other food or equipment. Proactive management of food contact surfaces greatly minimizes the risk of cross-contamination.\n\nUNAPPROVED FOOD SOURCE\n\nThe vast majority of food served by restaurants comes from inspected and approved sources, but some establishments seeks alternative food sources. This can carry a great risk to the establishment and customers as the food may be prepared in unsanitary ways. This can put the customer’s health and the restaurant’s future at risk when this food causes foodborne illness. Active Managerial Control ensures all the food served in their facility is from a licensed source for the safety of the customer and the restaurant.\n\nHOW TO PARTICIPATE\n\nInfuse is a partnership between your establishment and an LLCHD Food Safety consultant. Using AMCs, the consultant works with you to evaluate and strengthen your establishment’s core food safety practices.

The cornerstone is the use of the “Take 20!” phrase as a verbal reminder to wash hands. “Take 20!” uses an engaging set of posters on specific handwashing topics that will generate conversation among food handling staff and serve as a visual reminder to wash hands. In addition to the “Take 20!” phrase and posters, the project provides Glo Germ exercises to demonstrate the how, when and why of good handwashing. Regardless of how strong a restaurant’s handwashing culture is, good handwashing practices are such a vital part of food safety that there is always the need to reinforce good handwashing practices with staff and look for ways to improve.\n\nMORE INFORMATION ON TAKE 20.\n\nHow can I get started?\n\nLet us know that you want to participate and we will get you all set up!
