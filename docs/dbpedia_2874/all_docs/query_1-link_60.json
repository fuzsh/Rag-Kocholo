        "text": "Food poisoning is caused by eating contaminated food and affects a large number of Australians every year. Food can be contaminated when it is handled, stored or prepared incorrectly. Some foods have a higher risk of causing food poisoning, and some people are more at risk of getting food poisoning than others.\n\nWatch this video about food safety.\n\nFood poisoning and bacteria\n\nFood poisoning occurs when sufficient numbers of particular types of bacteria, or their toxins, are present in the food you eat. These bacteria are called pathogens.\n\nHigh-risk foods for food poisoning\n\nFood contamination is not just limited to foods you may consider risky, such as chicken or fish. Prepared fruits, vegetables and salads can also be potentially dangerous.\n\nContaminated food will usually look, smell and taste normal. Food poisoning bacteria can grow and multiply on some types of food more easily than others.\n\nPotentially high-risk foods include:\n\nraw and cooked meat - such as chicken and minced meat, and foods containing them, such as casseroles, curries and lasagne\n\ndairy products - such as custard and dairy-based desserts like custard tarts and cheesecake\n\neggs and egg products - such as quiche\n\nsmallgoods - such as ham and salami\n\nseafood - such as seafood salad, patties, fish balls, stews containing seafood and fish stock\n\ncooked rice and pasta\n\nprepared salads - such as coleslaws, pasta salads and rice salads\n\nprepared fruit - such as fruit salad\n\nready-to-eat foods - such as sandwiches, rolls, and pizza that contain any of the foods above.\n\nPeople at risk of food poisoning\n\nSome people are more at risk of getting food poisoning than others. Take special care when buying, storing and preparing food for these people.\n\nVulnerable groups include:\n\npregnant women\n\nthe elderly\n\nyoung children\n\npeople with chronic illness.\n\nCauses of food poisoning\n\nPathogens such as Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli may be found in our food-producing animals. Care in processing, transport, storage, preparing and serving of food is necessary to reduce the risk of contamination.\n\nFood poisoning bacteria can multiply very quickly, particularly in certain conditions. The factors that affect bacterial growth include:\n\nTime - in ideal conditions, one bacterium can multiply to more than 2 million in 7 hours.\n\nTemperature - food poisoning bacteria grow best in the temperature range between 5 °C and 60 °C. This is referred to as the temperature danger zone. This means that we need to keep perishable food either very cold or very hot, in order to avoid food poisoning.\n\nNutrients - most foods contain enough nutrients for bacteria to grow. This is especially the case with potentially high-risk foods such as dairy and egg products, meat, poultry and seafood.\n\nWater - bacteria need water for their growth. Without water, growth may slow down or stop. That is why dried foods do not spoil.\n\npH - is the measure of acidity or alkalinity and is also important for controlling bacterial growth. Low pH (acid conditions) generally stops bacterial growth, but where the pH of food is neutral, as is the case for many foods, most bacteria grow quite well.\n\nSymptoms of food poisoning\n\nThe symptoms of food poisoning may vary depending on the type of bacteria causing the illness. Symptoms can range from mild to very severe. Symptoms can occur almost immediately after eating, or a number of hours later, and they can last from 24 hours to 5 days.\n\nWhen you get sick, you usually experience one or more of:\n\nnausea\n\nstomach cramps\n\ndiarrhoea\n\nvomiting\n\nfever\n\nheadaches.\n\nSome food-borne pathogens cause other symptoms. For instance, pathogenic Listeria bacteria may cause miscarriage or meningitis and can cause severe illness in susceptible people. Food poisoning can also lead to other long-term illnesses and symptoms.\n\nIf you think you have food poisoning\n\nIf you experience symptoms and think you have food poisoning, see your doctor as soon as possible. It's also a good idea to report your illness to your local council or the Department of Health, so that the causes can be investigated. This is particularly important if you think the illness is related to eating out at a restaurant or café, or to food purchased from a shop or takeaway outlet.\n\nHow to prevent food poisoning\n\nThere are some simple rules you can follow to minimise the risk of food poisoning. You should take steps to:\n\nprevent food from being contaminated\n\nprevent the bacteria in the food from growing and multiplying.\n\nBuying food and food poisoning\n\nWhen you buy food:\n\nTry to keep potentially high-risk foods outside the temperature danger zone and buy hot and cold foods at the end of your shopping trip.\n\nKeep hot foods and cold foods separate.\n\nAvoid food past its use-by date and always check labels.\n\nAvoid food in swollen, dented, leaking or damaged cans, containers or other packaging.\n\nDon't buy frozen or chilled foods that have been left out of the freezer, and only buy hot foods that are steaming hot.\n\nCheck that serving staff use separate tongs when handling separate food types, such as meats and vegetables.\n\nCheck that serving staff wear gloves when they handle the food, but not when they are cleaning surfaces or taking money.\n\nMake sure that eggs in cartons identify the supplier, and never buy cracked or dirty eggs.\n\nTake your shopping home quickly and store it immediately.\n\nPreparing food and food poisoning\n\nWhen you prepare food:\n\nWash your hands in warm, soapy water and dry them well before preparing food. Wet hands are more likely to transmit bacteria so take the time to dry them thoroughly.\n\nDon't use the same cutting board for raw food that will be cooked (such as meat) and foods served uncooked (such as salads). This reduces the chances of cross-contamination of food.\n\nIf you don't have separate cutting boards or utensils to prepare raw foods and ready-to-eat foods, thoroughly clean and dry your chopping board and utensils between each use.\n\nNote that most food should be cooked to a temperature of at least 75 °C.\n\nCheck the cooking temperature with a thermometer. If you don't have one, make sure you cook poultry until the meat is white, particularly near the bone. Cook hamburgers, mince, rolled roasts and sausages right through until their juices run clear. Cook white fish until it flakes easily with a fork.\n\nRinse raw fruits and vegetables with clean water before using them.\n\nIf you feel unwell, let someone else prepare the food.\n\nStoring food and food poisoning\n\nWhen you store food:\n\nSeparate raw food from cooked food, and store raw food at the bottom of the fridge to avoid juices dripping onto, and contaminating, other food.\n\nCheck your fridge temperature is below 5 °C and your freezer temperature is below -15 °C.\n\nAllow cooked foods to cool to room temperature (about 21 °C) before storing in the refrigerator. This should not take more than 2 hours - cooling will be quicker if you put hot food into smaller containers rather than leaving it in one large one. This prevents the refrigerator temperature from rising and reduces the risk of bacterial growth in all food stored in the fridge.\n\nCover all food with lids, tin foil or plastic wrap.\n\nDon't store food in opened tin cans.\n\nWhere to get help"
