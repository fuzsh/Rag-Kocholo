        "text": "1.1. Overview of the Philippine Health System\n\nThe Philippines is a middle-income economy in the southeast Asia region, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of 3550 USD in 2021 [7]. It has an estimated population of 111 million in 2021, with the median age of 25.7 years. shows some salient features of the Philippine health-care system. Health expenditures comprised 5.6 percent of its gross national product in 2020, from 4.7 percent the previous year 2019 [8]. The Philippines national health accounts’ data showed that health expenditure by all sectors rose to 12.6 percent in 2019–2020, the first year of the pandemic, from 10.2 percent in the previous two years. Government schemes and compulsory contributory health care financing schemes comprised 45.7 percent of the source of spending, with household out-of-pocket payments at 44.7 percent, and the balance attributed to voluntary payment schemes. The year 2020 saw government and contributory financing schemes overtake household out-of-pocket payments, a welcome development for equity considerations [9].\n\nTable 1\n\nFeaturesFigures (as Indicated)Current Health Expenditures-CHE (NHA 2020 in [8])5.6% of GDPGrowth Rate of (CHE)2019–202012.6%2018–201910.2%Health financing (NHA: 2020 in [8])-households (out of pocket)44.7% Government and Compulsory Schemes45.7%Distribution of Household Out of pocket Expenses (NHA: 2020 in [8])43.8% hospitals28.2% drugs, pharmacies9.0% preventive careUHC Coverage Index (WHO and World Bank data in [10])55%HC Utilization by households (DHS: 2017 in [11])8% of household population sought care past 30 days59% sought from public medical facilities40% sought care from private medical facilitiesHealth service delivery (Dayrit et al., 2018 in [12])1224 Hospital facilities, 64% private and 35% public in 2016;\n\n66% located in main island2587 city/rural health centers, 20,216 village health stations\n\nIn 2016Two-thirds are level 1 hospitals, with 41 beds on average; 10% are level 3, with 318 beds on average Health Human Resources (Philippine Statistical Yearbook/PSY, 2018 in [13])83% of health and medical graduates in 2015–2016 were from private schools (HIT, 2018)3131 doctors in govt service; 1875 Dentists; 5975 Nurses17,112 MidwivesPublic sector employs 61% of nurses and 90% of midwives (HIT, 2018)91% of Medical doctors and 74% of nurses work in hospitals (HiT,2018)Health GovernanceDOH as the overall policy setting of population-based care, and provision of regional hospital and specialist services; PhilHealth, the social insurance arm, as purchaser of personal-based careLGUs as facility owners, managers and implementers of health programs and services Local Health Boards as advisers to chief executives and local legislatures, with DoH representative\n\nhighlights the household preference for public medical facilities, which under the new UHC Act, must maintain 90% of beds as wards and 10% as private beds. The reverse is mandated for private facilities to maintain at least 10% as ward beds of its total bed capacity. The same Act requires no additional user charges be imposed on indigent and other special groups in the ward facilities. While health human resources were largely trained (86%) in fee-paying, private institutions, the new UHC Act expands public medical and health services training, with a return-to-service clause for the scholars of public universities and colleges. The public facilities had a larger share of nurses and midwives. In general, the medical doctors and nurses are found in hospitals, as opposed to primary care facilities.\n\nSince the enactment, 60 operational guidelines and policies have been drawn up to implement UHC, and in accord with its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR). Fifty-five (55) are considered as finalized and issued. Thirty-three (33) implementation sites are considered to be advanced implementation sites (AIS) [14]. The UHC implementation process is presented by the DOH in various roadshows as being built around integration. Below are the ways in which the implementation is described:\n\nStructural integration—toward the creation of the city-wide and province-wide health systems; this means bringing together the inter-local health zones (ILHZ) which group municipalities into districts. This structural integration means having various service delivery structures at province, municipal, and district levels work together more closely. Primary health care, the lowest level of operations, will operate as the system gatekeeper, channeling patients through diagnostic systems at secondary levels and specialist and inpatient care through to tertiary and the apex, as needed;\n\nManagerial integration—towards the strengthening of the Provincial Health Board and the City Health Board; these boards are the policymaking instruments for UHC, as well as the units that approve resource allocation and execute oversight of the implementation; this will entail the bringing together of representatives from the various offices of the Province, Municipalities, DOH, and the private sector, both for-profit and non-profit. This integration will involve the strengthening of the Provincial Health Office as the technical arm of the province in overseeing the hospitals (provincial hospitals, district hospitals), as well as the public health facilities (rural health units, barangay health units). It is conceivable that the private sector facilities will become part of the scope of the Provincial Health Office;\n\nFinancial integration—this means bringing together the resources from national government (internal revenues, PhilHealth remittances, etc.), resources from the province, and resources from the municipality into one or two Special Health Funds (SHF) which will be managed by the province and highly urbanized cities, respectively. From this Special Health Fund, allocations and disbursements will be made.\n\nThis strategy for UHC implementation demonstrates a centralizing approach, as presently the provinces and highly urbanized cities are the owners and the locus of the health services delivery of the health system, responsible for planning, payroll, and budget allocations to government health services and activities in their jurisdiction.\n\nWhen the 2019 UHC Act joint legislative deliberations began in 2017, relatively strong economic growth had been registered in prior years. Election promises and some reduction in the poverty levels have created a wider receptivity to health sector advocacies. The Act was discussed and drawn amidst much fiscal space, benefitting from payroll contributions and new revenue sources in the form of sin taxes (so called taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and sugar content) and reforms that earmarked and increased the financial resources for health. The allocation of roles and responsibilities, where the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) is responsible for personal health services, while the Department of Health (DOH) covers for the population health services, is a convenient way to divide fiscal resources. The role of local government units (LGUs), who are the de jure owner of the facilities below regional levels, such as provincial hospitals, city and rural health centers, and barangay health stations, was not clearly specified. Many of the LGUs were not aware of their roles, as voiced in the deliberations about its implementation rules. A separate law, the Local Government Code (LGC) or Republic Act 7160 in 1991, governs LGUs. The integrated local health systems (ILHS), established within the provincial and highly urbanized cities, are tasked under the UHC Act to be responsible for both the planning and managerial supervision of population-based and individual-based health services within respective local jurisdictions (Sec. 19.8).\n\nOne area affecting national–local relationships is the health workforce. When local governments took over the health functions in the 1991 decentralization, they had to contend with paying health personnel with a higher pay structure, different from regular government personnel, and mandated in another law, the Magna Carta for Public Health Workers Act [15]. The differences in pay structure were justified in terms of hazards, subsistence, longevity pay, laundry, and remote assignments, along with performance-based allowances. The pay and benefit structures are not widely adopted in the private health sector. A comprehensive policy review culled 134 policies consisting of 73 laws and 61 executive policy issuances of different government agencies affecting human resources for health [16]. The payment for the health workforce is a contentious point for private providers, particularly, if this will be part of the requirements for accreditation. The private sector may not be able to pay its workers all of the benefit payments given to public health care workers. The health workers paid from the local government funds are not receiving the same amount as the national government-funded health workers, creating a contentious area within the same workspace.\n\nIn a recent policy development, known as the Mandanas Ruling by the Supreme Court in 2018 (and confirmed in 2019), the LGUs’ share of national funds or the Internal Revenue Allocation (IRA) will increase by an estimated 30.7% under the new funding formula, without earmarks. The increase was made possible as the allocations were expanded from a broader set of taxes, including customs and excise taxes. The intention is to support full devolution, assisting the LGUs with their service delivery functions, including health services [17]. This puts the LGUs in a position of strength with respect to the two other institutional custodians of UHC—the DOH and PhilHealth.\n\n1.2. Pandemic Performance\n\nBy mid-February 2022, the 24th month since the pandemic was officially declared, the Philippines had registered 3.6 million cases and 55 thousand people had died from COVID-19. The active cases, tested via RT-PCR, at that point in time were 72.3 thousand. An estimated 62% of the population were officially reported by then to have received at least one dose of the vaccine [18]. There was no vaccination for children below 12 years old at this point in time. The Philippines ranked bottom of the Bloomberg COVID-19 resilience score in January 2022, due largely to the severity and duration of the lockdown periods, vaccination rates, openness to travel via flights, and travel routes [19].\n\nThe fiscal space for UHC implementation has since shrunk with the pandemic; the structure of service delivery and financing are challenged with the physical and human resource requirements and coordination needs. In exploring complex systems, such as health care, the country’s initial response during this pandemic can be characterized by dysfunctional coordination platforms, inadequate and mismanagement of resources, as well as limited information systems and capacities, as similarly indicated in systems thinking analysis [20,21]. That the country was able eventually to track cases, continue to monitor them, model, and anticipate trends was due to the coming on board of knowledge partners from academia and the private sector. Vaccine orders were made in advance by the private sector for their employees and eventually shared with the public sector, demonstrating regulatory partnerships.\n\nThe pandemic also highlighted the crucial and effective role performance of the LGUs, given weaknesses at the central level. Emergency funding was speedily approved nationally, but distribution to lower levels were not as quick. International partners (such as the Asian Development Bank) were also forthcoming with speedy support for infrastructure, such as laboratories and expensive GenXpert machines. The LGUs looked to the central authorities for guidance and support with materials. When these were unclear, not forthcoming, or delayed, they proceeded within their own mandates through their local legislative systems. Public–private partnerships were launched ( ). It is notable that the public counterparts were local governments (provincial governments and one highly urbanized city) and the University of the Philippines system. The imperatives of responding to the pandemic have seen additional resources poured into the health sector quite speedily, via legislation, private donations, and reallocation from other sectors. The absorptive capacities of some of the LGUs remain a concern [22]. It is interesting to note that these are hospital-based investments.\n\nTable 2\n\nImplementing AgencyInvestment (Php)J-YenUSDStatusPhilippine General Hospital-DilimanUniversity of the Philippines21.3 billion47.9 trillion414.92 millionbefore ICC for approvalBaguio General Hospital and Medical Center, Renal CenterLGU and DOH470 million1 billion8.0 millionCagayan Valley Medical Center Hemodialysis CenterLGU and DOH330 million742 million6.4 millionPhilippine General Hospital—PGH Manila Cancer CenterPGH4.6 billion10.3 billion89.6 millionbefore ICC for approvalMariveles Mental Health and Wellness CenterLGU and DOHMakati Life Medical CenterLGU-Prv5 billion11 billion97.2 million\n\n4.1. National-Local Interactions\n\nThe UHC implementation appears to have been envisioned as a strategy of re-centralization, given the context of integration. At present, the provinces and highly urbanized cities are the owners and locus of health services delivery of the health system; responsible for planning, payroll, and budget allocations to government health services and activities in their jurisdiction. The content assessment, that showed LGUs as having the least attribution or responsibility, points to a critical neglect.\n\nUnder the implementing rules and regulations [28], the local health system refers to “all health offices, facilities and services, human resources, and other operations relating to health under the management of the LGUs to promote, restore or maintain health” (Sec. 19.2). It is envisioned, under Rule 19.6, that the integration of the province and city-wide health systems shall be undertaken “through a mechanism of cooperative undertakings” (pursuant to Section 33 of the Republic Act 7160; The Local Government Code of 1991) [29].\n\nDOH and PhilHealth, outside of headquarters, conduct their primary responsibilities in a ‘cooperative’ arrangement. This arrangement has made for a mixed implementation of the devolution enshrined in the local government code [12]. The new UHC Act, however, has no compulsory power to enforce cooperation between the LGUs in their zones, even as tasks, such as managerial and financial integration and the provision of the needed resources and support mechanisms to make the integration possible and sustainable (Sec. 19.9), are indicated. This highlights the basic vulnerability of national–local relationships, that as political administration changes, so can the strategies and priorities change. The Mandanas ruling mentioned in Section 1.1 has given added leveraging power to LGUs with the increased funding share of the internal revenue allocation (that is, their share of the national taxes). These are not earmarked funds and it will require negotiations with the primary UHC implementors. In terms of accountabilities, only PhilHealth has a quasi-judicial authority on certain matters. The DOH has limited administrative remedies with respect to decision-making in the interlocal health decision making by their boards. The recent developments in public–private partnerships highlighted in above, showed LGUs leading the partnerships in creating new facilities. The strengthening of the financial position of LGUs can be viewed as re-devolution. The integration discussions which strengthen the role of DOH in local matters will need re-calibration.\n\nIt has been indicated in the first part of this paper that one contentious area in national and local relationships has to with the responsibilities and payment for the health workforce. For the implementation of the UHC Act, more work needs to be completed in the harmonization of various laws and policies, as they affect both the government workforces and the private provision of care. The health workers paid from the local government funds are not receiving the same amount as the national government-funded health workers, creating a contentious area within the same workspace. The private providers may not be able to pay its workers all of the benefit payments given to public health care workers, and using this as a precondition for accreditation may put off private providers from UHC implementation. In the midst of the pandemic, there were mounting complaints from the private providers about unpaid accounts, an issue that has always been lodged against the institution [30], and for which the new UHC Act has not provided greater compulsion for PhilHealth, nor redress for the providers.\n\n4.2. Other Stakeholders and Contracting\n\nOur content analysis has shown that engagements with the private sector and community groups were weakly ascribed in the Act, and contracting figured prominently as the main instrument to relate with stakeholders. In the Act’s provisions on the private sector, its participation in the integrated local health system, through a contractual arrangement with the province-wide or city-wide health systems, is encouraged.\n\nSince public (tax) and member funds are involved, services are not just purchased by central authorities but will be underpinned by contracts, or formal agreements among government agencies and affected stakeholders, including public and private facility operators, and the health workforce. Schuhmann and Bautista [30] observed that, while incentives are mentioned 18× in the draft IRR, there are more than 40 counts of contracts or contracting being mentioned in the implementation rules. With DOH and PhilHealth being hierarchical or bureaucratic organizations, contracting has been viewed largely as transactional, and the contracts are used to justify the transfers of resources. One of the biggest scandals during the pandemic was related to the government procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE), masks, and similar items [31].\n\nThe new UHC Act and its IRR view contracting as a “meeting of the minds”; however, among a very diverse group of parties with equally varying interests and considerations, this is not sufficient. It will be a challenge for the DOH, DILG, PhilHealth, and the LGUs to develop a contract that will satisfy the varying interests of the diverse group of entities sought to be brought together. The conceptual nuances of managing through contracts has been discussed in more depth [32]. Much of the language of the Act and the rules regarding contracts is directive, and for the individual-based health care provider networks, it appears that there is a requirement to form a single entity under a network. This is seen in the requirement of “networks exhibiting proof of legal personality” (Sec. 18.4.f). This clause forms a likely disincentive to private sector providers who are normally in competition with one another in small markets.\n\nThe DOH and PhilHealth have been given the task of providing general guidelines for these contractual arrangements, hence the impression and concern that these contracts will be very “top down” in nature is warranted. It is recommended that, to counteract this possibility, the task ahead is to empower and strengthen the Provincial and City Health Boards in order to provide nuanced, localized, and, consequently, responsive oversight and management over the contracts that establish the ILHS and other networks.\n\nThe role of non-government organizations, patient, and community groups was highlighted during the pandemic. They were involved in community mobilization, contact tracing, and coordinating the treatment of individuals in the community, even the provision of social assistance and support. They may continue to be partners post-pandemic. Access to UHC funds is likely also to be through the contracting mechanism. Government procurement systems are not user friendly to community groups and non-government organizations. Membership in the health boards is one venue for participation.\n\n4.3. Other Cross-Cutting Considerations\n\nThe top-down approach has created various anomalies in the light of limited tools utilized to implement the new Act. Moving contracts from being mere transactions to moving monies and paying vendors will require better provider payment systems, which rests on improved information technology systems; with both, steering the system towards health care quality. Financing and information systems form the backbone on which the structure of the health system stands. The new UHC Act’s central feature divided responsibilities by type of intervention; between DOH for population health activities and PhilHealth for personal health care. Linkages on financing, particularly on payments to providers, did not prominently figure in the content assessment.\n\nFair provider payment processes are critical to push for quality services from accredited hospitals, using analytic and evidence-based approaches, rather than relying on its quasi-judicial mandate and flexing its muscle on fraud detection and conflicting policies. The funds from these two agencies will be pooled in provincial and highly urbanized cities to form the special health fund that is managed by reconstituted local health boards. Considering the slight majority of the private sector over government health in the facilities count, there is no indication as to how the private sector will accept not being directly in receipt of funds from the main insurer, PhilHealth. Instead, they will have to collect against the Special Health Fund (SHF), which is managed by the local political bureaus. Furthermore, the payment delays to hospitals, scandals over inappropriate payments, and manipulation of the system through case creep (how one simple case diagnosis will be upgraded to a more complicated case) have percolated into trust issues between PhilHealth and the private providers [33].\n\nWhile the UHC law improves on the governance of PhilHealth by tightening the qualifications of PhilHealth board members, the financing reforms needed would require more transformative leadership. The pandemic experience has shown how easy it is to wipe out the financial reserves saved over the surplus years, erode agency credibility with the scandals and untimely premium increases. Cost efficiency is gained by altering the way payment is made to the providers, by moving from case payments to more cost control systems, such as global budgeting [34]. The Act’s Chapter IV, Section 18-B mentions performance-based, close-end, prospective payments based on diagnostic categories. This will require capacities, technical skills, and information that may not be currently available. Budget transfers, outside of premium revenues, by members will require better budget cycle planning and financial reporting.\n\nThe information requirements and systems needed for efficiency and equity are vast. While new regulatory agencies have been identified in the new UHC Act, such as the Health Promotion Bureau and Health Technology Assessment, the availability and quality of the data and information they will be working with for improved decision-making still need to be constructed. As they generate the data, frequent analysis and updates on diagnostic codes, weights, and costs will form part of the information technology systems that will yield more transparent and robust internal evaluation, utilization processes, knowledge exchange, and management for a nimbler health system.\n\nAs decentralized local delivery systems and a strong private health sector are the contexts under which the centralizing approach of the new UHC will be undertaken, incentives will be the main mechanism by which purchasing agencies, the DOH, and PhilHealth, are going to relate with stakeholders. Under a strengthened central authority, incentives need to evolve from simple ‘carrots’ or bargaining sticks to being part of a global budget scheme, similar to how international agencies, such as the Global Fund, allocate funds to countries. It is based on robust modeling and evaluation protocols. Only through an interface with technology and evidence-based management can the financial flows in the system be used to drive the strategic choices of users, be it as a provider, health center staff, patients, managers, or decision makers. Only then will the system be efficiently and equitably managed to ensure affordability and universal coverage. Without innovations, adoption will be slow, if not resisted.\n\nA key challenge for the information system sector is the provision in the UHC Act’s implementing rules and regulations, stating that the Department of Health and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation will be funding the development and upgrading of the information system software to be utilized by health care providers and insurers, at no cost (Section 36.3) to them. Several initiatives have been undertaken through the Philippines’ eHealth Agenda framework of 2010. Some of the key players in the pandemic case reporting systems were from the group. Central systems must be designed with local capacities and interoperability in mind. Knowledge partnerships have been shown to be critical during the pandemic, and can only be strengthened with less hierarchical systems."
