        "text": "Did you know that most consumer products being imported, manufactured, or sold in the Philippines need to be individually assessed and registered by the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? The Agency’s Certificate of Product Registration confirms that all goods entering the market meet the necessary safety and quality standards.\n\nIf you are planning on expanding your company into the Philippines within a regulated industry, then you will need to ensure compliance through proper FDA registration and certification. This article will dive deeper into the process of applying for FDA certificates in the Philippines.\n\nFDA registration overview in the Philippines\n\nUnderstanding the FDA’s role in business operations in the Philippines\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration reports to the Department of Health in the Philippines and monitors regulations for any business activities that involve manufacturing, trading, and distributing (wholesale, import, or export) within FDA-regulated industries:\n\nFood and beverage\n\nCosmetics\n\nDrugs and pharmaceuticals\n\nMedical Devices and In-Vitro diagnostic devices / Reagents\n\nHousehold/Urban Hazardous Substances (HUHS) and pesticides\n\nToys and childcare articles\n\nBefore your company can register any products, however, you must obtain a License to Operate (LTO) from the FDA. The LTO in the Philippines enables your company to legally carry out any of the aforementioned operations within FDA-regulated industries. To learn more, check out our related article on how to secure a License to Operate in the Philippines.\n\nTypes of FDA certificates in the Philippines\n\nOnce a product has been assessed by the FDA and approved for the Philippine market, they will issue a certificate. This certificate is essential for company operations as it ensures that any goods being produced or sold meet necessary standards. The designation of the certificate varies depending on the type of product being assessed:\n\nCertificate of Product Registration (CPR): The most common type of certificate, applies to food, drug and HUHS products\n\nCertificate of Product Nomination (CPN): Applies to cosmetic products\n\nCertificate of Medical Device Registration (CMDR): Applies to medical devices and related products\n\nEach certificate processing comes with specific fees which are determined on a case-by-case basis. The fees are comprised of FDA/government fees and legal research fees. Cosmetic products may have additional fees depending on the variant. You must keep in mind that failure to secure a product certificate can result in fines and even business closure.\n\nSecuring an FDA Certificate of Product Registration (CPR)\n\nHow to apply for the FDA Certificate of Product Registration in the Philippines\n\nOnce you have obtained a License to Operate in the Philippines for your company, you can apply for the FDA certificate for your regulated products. Certificates are valid for 1 to 2 years and are subject to renewal upon expiration. To apply for an FDA certificate of Product Registration, you will need to submit the following:\n\nApplication form: must be accompanied by a valid LTO issued by the FDA in the Philippines\n\nProduct labels: Copies of product labels in all packaging sizes, including product photos in all packaging sizes and from different angles.\n\nSupporting documentation must be provided for logos, seals, and certification per labeling regulations (e.g. Halal, Sangkap Pinoy Certificate, product information)\n\nProduct documents: Must support any product claims, such as documents detailing physiochemical and microbiological regulations.\n\nThe specification must fall under the ASEAN directive regulations.\n\nCertificate of analysis: Details on the product, must be relevant to food standards and regulations compliance.\n\nProduct Sample: It is mandatory to provide a physical representative sample of the product, which must appear as it would commercially and complete with all labels.\n\nIt is important to note that an FDA certificate is rendered invalid if any changes are made to the product. If changes are brought to the product, you will need to apply for a renewal. Emerhub’s team of advisors is well-versed with FDA registration in the Philippines and can help you prepare the necessary documents and handle the application and renewal process for you.\n\nDetermining the right method of renewing your CPR\n\nDepending on the nature of the product being registered, the CPR in the Philippines expires after one to two years. However, certificates can be renewed directly through FDA offices. All renewals must be requested at least one month before the expiration date. There are two types of FDA certificate renewals:\n\nSome products are more likely to go through amendments and changes, especially with food safety regulations being in constant evolution. Emerhub’s consultants can help you determine which FDA certificate renewal method is appropriate for your product(s) and set up the renewal process.\n\nEnsure compliance to avoid penalties during FDA registration\n\nSelling a product without the proper FDA registration in the Philippines can lead to serious sanctions for your company. Selling uncertified products can result in the FDA issuing a fine and seizing/terminating the product from the market. The Administration will also issue a public warning against your product.\n\nProducts that have been removed by the FDA can be reintegrated after paying the fine and obtaining the right certificate. However, it can be very difficult for a company to recover from the negative consumer response that can result following an FDA public warning. It is therefore best practice to properly register your operations and obtain the appropriate certificates.\n\nEmerhub understands the complexities of FDA requirements and can help guide you throughout the entire registration process to avoid any compliance risks.
