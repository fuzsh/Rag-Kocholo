        "text": "Welcome to the website for the former South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). This website is no longer being updated but will be available for some time as a public service.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, DHEC became two separate agencies â€” the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) and the South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH). Additionally, DHEC's retail food program and milk and dairy lab moved to the South Carolina Department of Agriculture. You can visit the linked agencies for your needs or visit the DHEC homepage to choose the correct agency website.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of either hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans. Both drugs are FDA approved for other diseases and can be taken safely as directed by a doctor. Neither drug is an anti-viral medication.\n\nIn South Carolina, there has been an increase in people needing care in an emergency department for ivermectin and HCQ exposure in 2021. Reports from the poison control hotline confirm an increase in visits for HCQ exposure.\n\nIn some unpublished reports in other countries (e.g., Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq) Ivermectin seemed to improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients, but these were not scientific studies. Multiple studies published on Ivermectin have been subsequently retracted when they were found to be based on falsified data or errors in analysis and are misleading.\n\nAdequate clinical trials have not been done to prove ivermectin is effective to treat or prevent COVID-19. There is not enough evidence to recommend ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment at this time. Clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of Ivermectin as a COVID treatment are ongoing. Other effective treatments for COVID-19 are available on the DHEC and CDC websites.\n\nThe dangers of using ivermectin\n\nDo not swallow ivermectin lotion or cream that is meant for use on the skin.\n\nTaking large doses or doses intended for animals is dangerous and can result in overdose, causing serious harm including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low blood pressure, dizziness, balance problems, seizures, coma, and even death.\n\nIvermectin can cause birth defects if taken early in pregnancy.\n\nDosages intended for animals may contain ingredients that are not meant for people to consume, and how these ingredients can affect humans has not been studied.\n\nThe dangers of using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)\n\nHigh quality research data show the use of HCQ for treating COVID-19 can be dangerous and has no medical benefit. In fact, the FDA has revoked emergency use authorization for HCQ in COVID-19 patients based on these dangers and because it does not help people recover faster.\n\nHCQ should not be taken for COVID-19 infection because it can cause serious heart rhythm abnormalities, severe liver inflammation, and kidney failure.\n\nTaking HCQ on your own outside the hospital is dangerous.\n\nPrevent COVID-19 by getting vaccinated\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective and are the best way to protect against severe COVID-19 illness. High vaccination coverage is the best way to end the pandemic. Vaccines are free and available to anyone ages 5 and over. More information about the COVID-19 vaccines and access to a vaccine clinic are available here.\n\nMore information:\n\nHydroxychloroquine: FDA Revocation of emergency use authorization for HCQ (June 15, 2020)\n\nNational Institutes of Health: Summary of studies showing no benefit and significant harms of HCQ\n\nNational Institutes of Health: Summary of Clinical Data on Ivermectin"
