Filipino medical staff are highly trained, although the facilities may not be as impressive as those found in high-end US or European hospitals. English is spoken throughout the Philippines, so there should be few language barriers preventing expats from accessing healthcare.\n\nWhile the overall quality of the Philippinesâ€™ state-subsidised public healthcare is good, healthcare in rural areas is of significantly lower quality than at hospitals in large cities.\n\nPrivate healthcare in the Philippines provides more consistent care, and facilities tend to be better equipped than public ones."
