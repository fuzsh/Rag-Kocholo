The Novartis Foundation worked with the Philippines’ Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Science and Technology to implement the Leprosy Alert and Response Network System (LEARNS) - the Philippines’ first mobile phone-based leprosy detection system.

LEARNS allowed frontline healthcare providers to send images of suspect leprosy lesions and symptoms via SMS or via an app to a specialist, who could decide on further diagnostic actions to verify the diagnosis.

Partners

Our partners on the LEARNS initiative included the Philippines Department of Health and the Department of Science and Technology, the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, Metahelix and Novartis Philippines.
