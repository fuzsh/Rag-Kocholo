        "text": "The Soft Cavalry is a new band featuring Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell and musician Steve Clarke. The husband-wife duo have announced their self-titled debut album, which is due out July 5 via Bella Union, and shared the lead single “Dive.” Check that out below. The record was produced by Steve’s brother Michael Clarke. According to a press release, the album’s songs were inspired in large part by Goswell; she and Clarke married in 2018.\n\nSlowdive’s most recent album, 2017’s Slowdive, was the band’s first in 22 years. Late last year, they reissued their classic album Pygmalion through a collaboration between Pitchfork and Vinyl Me Please. Read “Why Slowdive’s Post-Rock Masterpiece Pygmalion Still Matters.”"
