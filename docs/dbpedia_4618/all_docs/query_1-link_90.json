        "text": "Tycho’s Epoch is the final album in the trilogy beginning with 2011’s Dive, then 2014’s Awake and culminating with the new album. This period between Dive and Epoch marks a significant maturation for Scott Hansen’s continually expanding project, one that has taken him from a solo performer and bedroom artist to fronting a live 4-piece band on large stages across the world.\n\nEpoch hones the sonic aesthetic of Dive while drawing on the kinetic energy of Awake, it explores darker themes and new musical territory. Epoch was produced and recorded by Hansen predominantly in his home studio in Berkeley, California. The album was arranged alongside long time collaborator and partner in the project, Zac Brown. Brown contributed bass and guitar parts to the songwriting process while Rory O’Connor performed drums on the album. Hansen sees Epoch as a multi-dimensional artistic vision at the confluence of his graphic design work via ISO50 and music with Tycho. The graphic presentation of album artwork is as important as the music itself. The keystone is the central image of Epoch and the colors scheme red and black. This is a stark contrast to the almost rainbow palette of Awake.\n\nWhen discussing the surprise element of this release Hansen said, “I’ve never been fond of the ‘hand in the album then wait 4 months for it to come out’ release schedule. I wanted to be more connected to the people consuming the music.” He continues, “There is a kind of visceral fulfillment you get from sharing something that you’ve just created with other people. We just finished mastering the album in late august so it will barely be a month old when people hear it. That’s a very satisfying feeling as an artist.“\n\nAfter 22 years, Slowdive return with “Star Roving”, their first new material since 1995’s ‘Pygmalion’, which will be released via Dead Oceans, worldwide. The band has been hinting at new music for some time and now the band can finally satisfy the ears of their patient fans. Featuring Neil Halstead (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Christian Savill (guitar), Nick Chaplin (bass), Rachel Goswell (vocals) and Simon Scott (drums, electronics), “Star Roving” embodies the effortlessness for which Slowdive is known — as the song progresses, it expands and contracts in ways that feel infinite. Singer Neil Halstead says: “When the band decided to get back together in 2014 we really wanted to make new music. It’s taken us a whole load of shows and a few false starts to get to that point, but it’s with pride and a certain trepidation we unleash “Star Roving”. We really hope folks enjoy it, it’s part of a bunch of new tracks we’ve been working on and it feels as fun, and as relevant playing together now as it did when we first started”.\n\nSlowdive’s debut album ‘Just For A Day’ was released in 1991 by Creation Records and was followed by the band’s now revered 1993 album ‘Souvlaki’ and 1995’s ‘Pygmalion’ before disbanding. In the 22 years of their virtual disappearance, compilation albums have been released and the core members of the group have gone on to join other musical endeavours. In 2014, the band announced that they’d reunited and more new music would follow. Faithful fans will herald “Star Roving” as a critically worthy return.\n\n‘THROAT’ is the new album by composer/producer Aaron David Ross (ADR). Arriving as the New York artist’s second release on PAN, ‘THROAT’ is made entirely from vocal sounds. It could only be crafted in the ultra-present; an age where the poetry of songwriting is flattened into catchy hooks. As words are sliced into sounds, ideas are reduced to sibilant syllables that still contain a range of emotional power, but deliver it in subversively different ways.\n\n‘THROAT’ exploits these ways, borrowing vocal fragments from everywhere to collage a choral congregation of singing servers; pinging one another to create open-source equal-opportunity electronic pop music. Reichian polyrhythms EDM drop into Bieber-esque beatboxing. Hypothetical K-pop stars conduct holographic choirs in altruistic ritual. Virtual summer festival DJs transcode into pure phonemes; anthropomorphizing formant-shifted vacuums of communication. When you drop the cargo of making sense, you can go so much faster.\n\nAs a classically trained musician inspired equally by pop and contemporary art & technology practices, ADR’s work has distinguished itself through its formal deliriousness and playful tenor. Besides ongoing collaborations with an international community of vocalists, producers, artists and fashion designers, Ross releases solo recordings, composes music for film, TV and advertising, and maintains a practice of live performance and sound installation.\n\nPeckham’s finest are back with another 12″ custom built for discerning dancers. The SE15 label have looked to Poland for inspiration again and returned to the pool hall with a ridiculously good pair of subtle low-key rollers that traverse ethereal, barely-there house territory in the best way possible.\n\nComprised of Baltic-Balearic-Beat legend Bartosz Kruczynski and the man normally known as Matat Professionals, Earth Trax and Newborn Jr’s debut EP for the label, Sax & Flute, beams into the world on October the 14th.\n\nBeing kind souls, we’ve decided to let you have a listen to the A-side. Stream it right now! Yes, right now! Right this second!"
