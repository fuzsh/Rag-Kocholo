        "text": "Francesca Bonci is an Italian based visual artists that creates music videos for bands like Pete International Airport, and Federale, and live visuals at shows as well. She does things a little differently than most in that she likes to keep things as analog as possible, loving to throw oldschool visual units and blenders in the mix. We talked to her as she just finished up her stunning new video for Dutch psychedelic rock band No Man’s Valley, who connected to her on a personal level through the lyrics and feel of their song Seeing Things, a mournful document of slowly going crazy during the pandemic.\n\nHi Francesca! How are you doing at the moment? What was the last thing that amazed you?\n\nHI! I feel pretty good, thanks for asking. And thank you for the interview! Let’s say that for some years now life has been forcing me to face constant challenges, but overall I am ok. I’m not one to feel sorry for myself or to give up in the face of adversity. Even if I’m a little tired. The last thing that really surprised me happened just a few days ago, when a wonderful person helped me to solve a big problem even though he wasn’t a really close friend. And he did it because of what my art conjured up on him. It was a very surprising act.\n\nCan you introduce yourself and the creative things you do?\n\nI am Italian with Thai origins on my mother’s side and I think this has always influenced the way I see and feel things. I have always traveled a lot since I was a child and I love meeting and learning from people of different cultures and languages than mine. I viscerally love music and always, when I listen to it, my mind travels and creates worlds and visions. Through art I have also been able to break down barriers, always be myself, overcome shyness and keep certain demons that inhabit my soul at bay. I create videos and visuals for both songs and live shows of international independent projects. Before the pandemic I participated in many festivals around Europe and I worked a lot with the post-rock world which lent itself more to having visuals projected during live performances. I collaborate with some London based labels and I have some projects with which I collaborate on a recurring basis. I don’t like categorizations and I have the quality of having a recognizable style regardless of the project I collaborate with. When I create I’m really happy. I also have my own personal project called Purple Moon Oneironauts which starts from the idea of unrepeatable performances of audio-visual improvisation with the possibility of audience integration and which takes into account the place where it is implemented. Everything happens in a kind of lucid dream, which is the leitmotif of the project.\n\nDuring the lockdown I did some sessions with the title “Breathing Rooms” where I invited musicians from various countries and we involved radio stations, art platforms, galleries, festivals which then hosted/broadcast the show. The idea was to keep artists and places of culture alive in that terrible moment.\n\nWhat is your educational background? Have you always been creative?\n\nI think I have been since the day I was born. My family never really encouraged my artistic aptitude, but I expressed it in whatever way I could. I love reading, watching movies, writing, drawing, creating things. Then after classical high school, I decided to enter the academy of fine arts at my own expense, where they had just established a new degree in multimedia design and visual design. And all my passions have acquired a different meaning. They were stimulating years, but to tell the truth they didn’t help me settle down on a professional level, in Italy art remains a somewhat difficult topic to deal with, especially video art and after various detours, I decided to carry forward my ideas autonomously and without ever compromising. The Internet helped me show my stuff around the world and get where I never thought I would go and so I started creating videos and visuals for international bands.\n\nWhere do you live and how does it influence your art?\n\nI am currently living in Bologna, but I was born in Turin and raised in the province of Pesaro and Urbino, in central Italy. I arrived here by chance, exactly 10 years ago, after living in Lisbon (a wonderful city) for 7 years. I don’t think Bologna influences my art, it’s just the place where I live with my partner. My whole artistic world develops outside and I have practically no artistic connection with this city.\n\nCan you tell me about your visual art? What is your vision? What are the coolest things you did so far?\n\nWhen I collaborate on a project, I try to get into it and make it my own. First of all I have to love the project because otherwise I just can’t create. The entire first phase is a real study of the concept behind the project, the album, the song. If we’re talking about things I don’t know, then I try to learn more about them through books or films until I really get into them. Then I try to approach it as if I were an added member of the band who has to enrich the song or songs in the case of a live visual set, trying to respect it as much as possible. The true creative phase is pure instinct and emotion. It happens in the timeline or on my setup of analog devices with which I improvise. I literally close my eyes to hear the music and then transform this feeling into visions, colors, shapes. This visceral way of approaching projects creates a fairly deep bond with the people I collaborate with and this is very rewarding because it is almost always mutual. I really like elective affinities and my main intent is mutual support between artists and making sure that art, the beautiful one, the authentic and unconditional one, never dies, because I believe it is the only thing capable of saving us, always.\n\nI can’t really tell you if there are things that are more beautiful than others because in all sincerity they all have a very great value for me. But I can tell you that among the last things I did, collaborating with Peter Holmström of Dandy Warhols in his fantastic project Pete International Airport (https://peteinternationalairport.bandcamp.com ) was an important experience, for many reasons: I am a huge fan of both of Peter’s projects, so to be able to work with someone you’ve always seen on stage and see your name on the vinyl next to all the other records… it was really crazy; It was one of the projects that gave me more visibility and allowed me to interact with a wider audience. I created the album cover artwork Cover /Artwork and the three songs for which I created the videos featured Jagz Kooner, incredible artist and producer of Primal Scream, Massive Attack, Garbage (The Watermark) among others. Lisa Elle from Wild Horses (Next Of Kin) and Rachel Goswell from Slowdive… (TIC TAC); and many other wonderful artists. My relationship with the people involved during the creation was very sweet and they made me feel good, just like anyone else I was lucky enough to work with. I felt I was respected as an artist. And it happened in a very dark moment when I wasn’t feeling very well. I am really very grateful to Peter.\n\nYour work is based on analog devices, right? Can you show us your most important tools and tell us about them?\n\nIt doesn’t rely exclusively on analog devices. In reality they are tools that I use exactly like digital ones or like colored pencils with which I make illustrations or watercolor sketches for animations which I use to create the material that I will then manipulate and assemble in the timeline with my editing software. During the first lockdown I had the time and courage to experiment with some video synths and analogue mixers for the first time, which I use connected to old cathode ray tube TVs and old mixers. Since then they have been an integral and predominant part of my creative setup, but always mixed with a lot of other not necessarily analogue stuff. My analog devices all built by small European DIY producers, which I really can’t do without are: a VHS processor from Lo-Fi Future ((England), a prototype built inside a VHS that acts on the color creating very glitchy chromatic effects interesting, The MisMatcher 01 Rev (which I won!) and its small version MisMatcher Petite from Freedom Enterprise (Portugal) which is a compact device containing 3 analog circuits that can be interconnected via patch cables to create very particular distortions. And finally a Very basic Dirrty Mixer for the image distortion from Mezkalin (Germany) I really like connecting them to a Roland Edirol V4 mixer.\n\nWhat inspires you? Do you actively seek out inspiration?\n\nEverything I have known and learned in my life inspires me. I am certainly very fascinated by a certain science fiction genre that finds its maximum expression in cyberpunk, Philip K Dick, I love the Beat Generation, David Cronenberg, the Fluxus movement and the video art of the 70s, Tarkovsky, Fernando Pessoa, David Carson’s typographic design, the nature, the sky, the dreams I make …I never look to others as a source of inspiration, I realize later that that thing has influenced me. I certainly have some very recurring things in my works: the eyes, the birds, the dream component.\n\nCan you shine a light on the projects you are currently working on?\n\nA video for the band Pulse Park (Germany/Canada) will be released soon, as well as a video for the band No Man’s Valley (Netherlands). I am working on the fourth video for the project One-Legged Heart (San Francisco) and I am working on a video for the beautiful project Federale by Collin Hegna, also a member of Brian Jonestown Massacre. In the meantime I continue to create visions for the experimental music label Specimen Records featuring many artists from the global electronic and dance scene.\n\nYou recently did a video for No Man’s Valley’s song Seeing Things! What can you tell me about the video, and what images the song conjured up for you?\n\nIt was intense. I felt connected because Jasper told me he wrote the song during the pandemic. I think I experienced common feelings and moments and while I was listening to the song I felt all those sensations again. I tried to recreate this emotional surrealism through colors and evocative images: insects, water, lights.\n\nTell me about the future, what should we look out for?\n\nThe future… certainly full of interesting projects. I hope to go back to traveling and doing live shows because I’ve been stuck for too long. I would also like to get back to doing something with my personal project and I would like to have the opportunity to work on theatre. And I will continue to dream.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nIf I intrigued them, please go and see my works and if they are musicians they could also contact me haha.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/francescabonci.visualartist\n\nhttps://francescaboncivisualartist.wordpress.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fraboncivisualartist/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/francescabonci_visualartist/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/scindin/videos\n\nDon’t you just love a surprise? I do, especially when they are as good as Rrrags‘ new album Mundi. Judging by their previous work I expected music more in line with their signature brand of high octane fuzz rock, which was pretty tight and delivered exactly what you might expect from members of Astrosoniq and Lords Of Altamont, but it kind of lacked the left field weirdo psych antics that tickle my fancy. Until now that is!\n\nFor on Mundi this Belgian/Dutch connection has found their hazy, trippy side, and went faaaar exploring it to the fullest. We hear guitars that reference Finnish psych black metallists Oranssi Pazuzu in their otherworldly darkness, desert dune buggy boogies that are allowed to take their good time to fully get their trip on, a newfound appreciation of the school of krautrock, and generally just a band that lets go of any rock restraints and dives headfirst into the rabbit hole, come what may.\n\nSongs like Walkers, Visitors, Slavic Heat, and Galactic Strut fully put on display what it can be like when a band with top notch veteran musicians like Rrrags can sound like when they let themselves go completely apeshit in the best possible way. This is psychedelic freedom executed with a musical professionalism and attitude that is quite rare these days.\n\nRrrags teaches us that it is never too late to get your freak on, and that when you do and fully explore the endless freedom gained, space and beyond are your limits. Mundi is a rare gem that way, and it comes highly recommended for all you freaks and left field psycho rockers out there…\n\nI had a quick chat with Rrrags guitarist Ron van Herpen, who you might also know from his other dark psych rock band Zoon, or Dutch stoner prog giants Astrosoniq. His new journey with Rrrags called Mundi recently took a psychedelic turn though, and so we were of course very curious to find out more about it…\n\nHey How is Rrrags doing these days?\n\nWe’re doing fine. Very relieved that the album finally is coming out after 18 months of work.\n\nCan you introduce the band to the Weirdo Shrine audience?\n\nWe started the band after a jamsession end 2017. Walter from Roadburn heard about this and immediatly offered us a spot on Roadburn 2018. We wrote a couple of songs and from that point we were a band.\n\nSome people at the Doom Charts were under the impression that you may have been disbanded, was there any reason to think so?\n\nNo we’re not disbanded. It was pretty quiet and maybe to quiet on our social mediachannels because we were working on new material. Maybe that’s the reason people thought we broke up but we didn’t.\n\nWhat was the biggest difference creating Mundi in regards to High Protein?\n\nWe decided our sound could use a more psychedelic experimental aproach. So we added krautrock elements in our music and changed songstructures to make them more unconventional. Also we wanted more heaviness.\n\nCan you explain the more “psychedelic” approach? Did that just happen or was it somehow a conscious decision?\n\nWe experimented with different kind of sounds and it just evolved in the music. Then we thought: “why don’t we recording that way”\n\nWhere do you guys live, and how does it affect your music?\n\nRob Martin lives in Antwerpen, Rob Zimmermann lives in Utrecht and I myself live in Oss, a small city in the south of the netherlands. Did it affect our music? Nah, not consciously as far as I know.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your label Lay Bare Recordings, how did you end up there, and what makes you stay?\n\nLaybare records is a label that is made by and for musiclovers. There is no commercial side to it. Love for music is their drive. It’s a small label and that means there is no time preasure, deadlines, tour obligations and things like that. Desirée, the label owner saw us on a small show. We talked and we felt an immediate connection. Now we have our second release on the label. Things go fast when you’re having fun!!\n\nWhat is your ambition with RRRags? And what is something on your band bucket list?\n\nFirst of all we want to promote Mundi. We are very proud of this album and our goal is to give it the promotion tit deserves. Do festivals next year and hopefully some touring. We’re checking out opportunaties at the moment. Rock in Rio is definitely on our bucket list.\n\nWho are some of your favorite contemporary bands at the moment?\n\nFor me personally King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, All Them Witches, Ravencult and Krallice. Maybe not the newest bands but for me they are.\n\nWhat should the readers of Weirdo Shrine do immediately after reading this?\n\nCheck out our new album on Laybare Recordings, keep your love for music, be kind to animals and separate garbage.\n\nhttps://laybarerecordings.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/rrragspower\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/laybarerecordings/\n\nhttps://rrrags.bandcamp.com/album/mundi-2\n\nLet’s start off by stating that Chela is NOT a secret recording of extra terrestrial activity. We have researched this assumption and found out that in fact two earthlings, one Dutch resident by the name of Ajay Saggar, and one Japanese resident by the name of Kohhei Matsuda are the individuals responsible for it. You’ll have to forgive us the confusion though, as Diagonal Drift by their alias Chela is one of the most otherworldly, or even outer-worldly musical experiences we had this year…\n\nTaking their impressive musical explorers’ career from their steady outlets Bhajan Bhoy and Bo Ningen into account, it is not so strange that this music would lean towards the progressive or avantgarde, but I can assure you there is still little that can prepare you for the utter strangeness of Chela and their Diagonal Drift. At times they sound like they emulate two gigantic space ships in the cosmos, at other times they show a more human side with rambling pianos and searchlight synthesisers. One thing is guaranteed though; it never becomes dull or ordinary for even a millisecond.\n\nIt is not quite clear what the purpose of the whole exercise is, other than to absolutely confound us and to show us the sounds the human race can produce when they are able to open their third eye and dive deeply into the cosmos. I bet though, if the people at SETI got a load of this album and would fire it into space they would get finally get an interesting conversation going. Because at the very least, Diagonal Drift is an interesting conversation starter…\n\nStraight out of Amsterdam, The Netherlands, I talked to 50% of the Chela duo, being mr Bhajan Bhoy himself; Ajay Saggar. The other half, Bo Ningen guitarist Kohei Matsuda is represented by him as we talk about the new collab album, and loads of other topics as well.\n\nHow are you? What was the last thing you wondered about?\n\nThe last thing I wondered about was when would it be possible for independent musicians from Europe to tour in the UK and in the USA again without all the stress and costly bureaucracy.\n\nCan you introduce yourself and your multiple musical projects?\n\nMy name is Ajay and I have been making music for most of my life. I started in bands at school and then played in hobby bands whilst at university. After university (in England) I played in a band called Dandelion Adventure (whom John Peel loved…and he gave us a session). Since then I have had groups (in Holland) like Donkey, The Bent Moustache, King Champion Sounds, Deutsche Ashram. Nowadays I am busy with Bhajan Bhoy, Chela, University Challenged, and Volksempfänger.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical background?\n\nI started listening to the John Peel show in 1976 (when my family moved from Kenya to England). I bought my first 7 inch single in 1977 (The Stranglers / “No More Heroes”) my first album in 1978 (The Stranglers / “Black + White”) and attended my first show the same year (The Stranglers). Since then I’ve been a complete music fiend buying tons of records, attending hundreds of shows, and basically having my life dictated by music. My all time favourite group are The Fall. I seriously started to play in band after I left university and was on the dole with the group Dandelion Adventure (I lived in Manchester, and the group was from Preston, Lancashire). Since then I have constantly been playing / making music and releasing a ton of records and playing shows. My tastes in music are incredibly broad….psychedelia, punk rock, dub+reggae, jazz / free jazz / spiritual jazz, electronica, folk, world music, drone, ambient, experimental, etc etc etc. I do a radio show on Radio WORM and also a monthly musical podcast (https://www.mixcloud.com/ajaysaggar/).\n\nWhat does a regular day in your life look like?\n\nGet up early, go to Paradiso (where I work), come home and cook for the family, then spend the whole evening in my studio working on music. If I dont go into Paradiso, then I will spend the whole day and evening working in my studio.\n\nWhat is the best thing about the new Chela album?\n\nI love how this Chela album turned out to be so adventurous and unpredictable….and utterly engaging to listen to.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the collaboration between you and Kohei Matsuda?\n\nKohhei and I have been friends for many years and we enjoy each others company and also making music together. We have played many duo shows together in the past, and I suggested to him that we should finally commit to making an album together….which he was also very keen to do. We had recorded together previously, but then with a third member…Oli Heffernan….under the name University Challenged. This time we did it with just the two of us. The recording process was organic and inspired. I collected everything we had done, and then set about spending several weeks in my studio editing, mixing and producing the whole thing. Kohhei listened to the stuff I had done and really loved it. We made minor adjustments and then got it mastered.\n\nWhen the album had been recorded, it was a case of deciding whether we should release it with our names on it or a group name. We chose for the latter. I suggested CHELA….Chela means disciple in Hindi and claw in Japanese……our cultures and ethnic backgrounds crossing nicely.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nI live in a small town north of Amsterdam called Krommenie. I like it here as I have my home and studio nearby…and so working and focusing on music is easy for me. With regards to playing opportunities, we have a cultural centre called De Groote Weiver, where people are able to organise concerts themselves and perform themselves…..thats pretty unique. Most people however gravitate towards Amsterdam (15kms away) which is understandable.\n\nWhich contemporary musicians do you look up to?\n\nWow….there are soooo many! I wouldn’t be doing justice to the hundreds of musicians I admire who are plying their trade for the sole purpose of making great art. But here are a few….Billy Hart, Bill Orcutt, Annea Lockwood, Steve Gunn, Julia Reidy, Marta Warelis, Chris Corsano, Jeffrey Alexander, Myriam Gendron, Matthew J Rolin, Han Bennink, Ab Baars, Gayle Brogan.\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nHahaha….the ultimate question. I go to my studio, I make a huge pot of tea, I put on an LP and listen to some music, I fire up all the speakers and amps and microphones and synths and equipment, and then when I’m ready, I will sit down and start playing.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nIn 2023, I will release 5 LPs. 3 LPs from Bhajan Bhoy (2 of which were released in March 2023, and another one will come out in October 2023), 1 LP from Chela (release date is late July / early August) and 1 LP from Volksempfänger (out in November). I have produced 2 albums for Ivan The Tolerable this year, one for Kurios Oranj, and another for Humph. I am busy recording new material for Bhajan Bhoy and also for University Challenged. And I plan to continue playing shows near and far if people invite me (I have no booking agent and so book everything myself).\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nI suggest your readers check out these Bandcamp pages :\n\nhttps://chela1.bandcamp.com/album/diagonal-drift\n\nhttps://bhajanbhoy.bandcamp.com\n\nWhether it is noisy freak jazz, saxophone crazed grindcore, froth mouthed black metal, or any other type of music that Dutch duo Dead Neanderthals lay their hands on; it instantly becomes cool. For their latest project they have taken on Skeletonwitch guitarist Scott Hedrick to participate in a full on drone-athon and you might think that it finally turned into a shoegazing snoozefest, but nope: once again it’s hella cool.\n\nSpecters is the second part of the Scott Hedrick collaboration in fact, where its predecessor Ghosts was a more ethereal and dynamic affair. This time Dead Neanderthals have gone for the more primal approach though. Specters is two major 18 minute grinding maelstrom jams, made to drive any forward thinking sane person to absolute madness. The combination of its repetition, its sheer gargantuan size, its heaviness, its maddening drum galloping, all make for an inescapable hypnotic experience. The listeners find themselves trapped in a pulsating spiderweb, only to be released when the mighty Dead Neanderthals allow it.\n\nIt is heavy music experimentalism in its most testing format, you know that thing Dead Neanderthals always strive to do. Only with this duo you might find they add a certain finesse and artful depth that always lifts whatever direction they turn upwards to a higher level. They make it cool. It is a dark, impenetrable heavy drone music, with stylish sunglasses.\n\nI got in touch with drummer René Aquarius of the band to ask him about his music life. Like his soulmate Otto Kokke, he is not just a Dead Neanderthal, he is a multiverse of different personas in a plethora of different disguises. We uncovered all of them, and a lot more…\n\nHow are you and Otto, and how is the band? How has the pandemic period been for you?Hi Jasper, we’re doing fine. Thanks for asking. The band is doing great, working on a lot of new stuff and it looks like we have a few releases lined up for 2023. The pandemic was as bad as it was for every band: limited rehearsals and shows. That just sucks. One of the biggest blows was the cancellation of 4 ten-year anniversary shows at Roadburn 2020, because the country was in lockdown. Luckily we were able to play Roadburn Redux with brand new material and here’s the proof of that:\n\nCan you introduce yourselves and the musical projects you are involved in?\n\nWe’re Dead Neanderthals, a pretty extreme duo from The Netherlands. We started in 2010 and have made over 40 releases and played hundreds of shows all over the world. We like to collaborate and have worked with Machinefabriek, Colin Webster, Dirk Serries, Nick Millevoi, Aaron Turner, Aafke Romeijn and -for Specters– with Scott Hedrick. We encourage everybody to check out our discography here: https://deadneanderthals.bandcamp.com\n\nOn our new album Specters, the band consists of: Scott Hedrick, who’s a founding member of Skeletonwitch and working as a composer and sound editor TV and film in Hollywood. Otto Kokke, who’s also involved in MNHM, Kultus and Glum Lord. Rene Aquarius, who’s a part of DungeönHammer , Plague Organ, Horrid Apparition, Cryptae, Heavy Natural, Celestial Bodies, Sneezing Pus and Coffin Lurker.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nIt’s not really that interesting. We played in some bands and eventually bumped into each other and thought: let’s make music together.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nGet up early. Work all day at our day-time jobs and do all the musical stuff for Dead Neanderthals during the evening (rehearsals, studio sessions, etc).\n\nWhat is the best thing about Specters?\n\nThe collaboration between the three of us. From the minute we started talking about collaborating (which started years ago with our previous album Ghosts), we knew we were all aligned and would be able to make something cool together. Doing it a second time helps in feeling more comfortable in making questionable decisions and seeing where you end up.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nOtto and Rene live in Nijmegen, the Netherlands and Scott lives in LA in the USA.The environment for musicians was better in the past in The Netherlands. Lack of rehearsal spaces and especially small venues means there’s less and less opportunity for musicians to meet each other and to get the experience they need to play bigger shows. Of course there’s always a DIY scene which works hard to get things done in whatever way possible, but that’s way more hard core and less traditional than the methods described above.\n\nWhat do you think of the label “experimental” when it comes to your music?\n\nThough ‘experimental’ is a really broad label and slapped on to a lot of stuff, it’s probably justified. It’s pretty weird to write 2 twenty-minute tracks, slap them together and call it an album. On the other hand, we think there’s enough to like for more people than just ‘experimental’ music lovers. So we hope the label doesn’t scare off too many people.\n\nCan you recommend some of your favorite current music to us?\n\nRene: 2023 has been an exceptional year for music so far! I really love the following albums:\n\nPhrozen – Questioning Society’s Secrets || Amazing mix of metal and hardcore that fills the gap that Power Trip left behind.\n\nTongues of Mount Meru – Kalpa || An uncompromising, 100-minute, wall of sound brought to you by veterans Lasse Marhaug and Jon Wesseltoft. Will transform you once you make the trip.\n\nVomi Noir – L’Innommable Remugle et la Mélopée Cavernuleuse des Râles Agoniques || French, Carcass-inspired goregrind of the highest order. What an album!\n\nNightmarer – Deformity Adrift || Such an insanely heavy album. Hearing is believing.\n\nOtto: Not 2023 but always on rotation:\n\nYoshi Wada – Earth Horns with Electronic Drone || Experimental drone from the early seventies.\n\nJack DeJohnette – Music in the Key of Om || Legendary drummer makes a new age album without drums!\n\nVomir – Black Bag || There’s a lot of Vomir out there – and harsh noise wall in general – so kind of arbitrary maybe, but this one just resonates.\n\nScott: Currently in rotation (some 2023, some not)\n\nNatural Information Society – Since Time Is Gravity\n\nJames Brandon Lewis – Eye of I\n\nDe La Soul – 3 Feet High and Rising\n\nRyuichi Sakomoto – Curated playlist for his own funeral\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs? And/or: what is the best situation to improvise in?\n\nFor the Ghosts and Specters albums it’s usually Otto and René who drafted a basic ‘first structure’. From there on we start discussing and sending over files to see if we can make it work. This process usually takes a while as we go through a lot of options before tying the knot. The most important aspect of it is that we all have to like it. After we feel comfortable about a certain step we make a proper recording and move to the next step. Eventually you end up with an album.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nFirst: release Specters through Utech Records and make sure everybody gets the vinyl in time. Second: Otto and Rene are working on several other records, which will be released later in 2023. Scott is shifting focus to the final touches on an instrumental solo album (Kraut, Pysch, Soundtracky kinda vibe) after Specters. He’s also digging back into the next Skeletonwitch record. All of this is in addition to films/video games he’s currently working on as well.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nDrink some coffee, enjoy and do something unexpectedly nice for someone today!\n\nhttps://deadneanderthals.wordpress.com\n\nhttps://deadneanderthals.bandcamp.com/album/specters\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DEADNEANDERTHALS\n\nhttps://utechrecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.utechrecords.com\n\nIs it a coincidence that the second Majestic Mountain Records album I fall completely head over heels for is once more dressed in pink? After the beautiful sonic haze of CB3 and their My Bloody Valentine inspired sludge album Explorations it is now time for The Machine to be pretty in pink with this scorching fuzz monster called Wave Cannon.\n\nThe Dutch stoner threesome of The Machine have been around for a while, being part of the second wave of bands that followed in the wake of bands like Dozer and Colour Haze in the early 2000s. They have earned their stripes and played every serious venue and every toilet in Europe. It is all the more impressive that after all that time Wave Cannon sounds as fresh and vital as it does.\n\nThe record sounds like a grunge band reinventing themselves, discovering the power of the reverb pedal, turning the volume up to eleven, and eventually launching themselves into endless space. It is a massive sound, one to get lost in every time you dive into it, blissfully, forgetting the world for three quarters of an hour. It is immediately clear why the band called it Wave Cannon too, as they draw up their walls of reverb drenched fuzzy distortion from the get go and engulf the listener with blasts like a tsunami to the head.\n\nThe vocals deserve a mention as well, being modestly buried in the mix, but beautifully executed in the best multi-vocal attack that would instantly gain the Alice In Chains stamp of approval. It is not the only nod to the high times of grunge on the record, The Machine have just taken its good parts and poured a truckload of sludge and massive bass distortion on top of it.\n\nThe result is Wave Cannon, and it’s a blast.\n\nI talked to David Eering, founding member of The Machine, and its singer and guitar slinger. Definitely not at a loss for words he gladly and eloquently explains what his band has been about all these years, and still is, and will be in the future.\n\nHi guys, how have you been?\n\nDoing great! To our most recent standards, we’ve had quite some shows the past month promoting our new album Wave Cannon. It’s been quite satisfying to be on the road again.\n\nCan you introduce The Machine to the ignorant Weirdo Shrine crowds? Especially your new member!\n\nWe’ve been around for the past 15 years, stubbornly doing what we do while maneuvering our way through Europe. We play a style that takes influences from a number of things, but what you’d probably hear in it is a mix of desert/stoner rock, heavy psych, noisy space stuff and quite some of the alt 90s in a very broad sense. We have Chris Both on bass, he’s been with the band for the past 4,5 years now. The newest addition to the family is Klaas Dijkstra on drums, he’s been with us for approx. 6 months. Klaas is a very musical and skilled drummer (and good company to boot) and somehow incomprehensibly managed to stay somewhat under the radar of the more well-known (famous is such a terrible word) bands in the heavy music scene in The Netherlands. He has played in numerous bands during the last two decades, his tenure with Amsterdam 90s fuzz grunge punk band BUG being his most recent. We’re glad that we’ve been able to lure him into our orchestra. My name is David Eering and I play guitar and sing, in addition to being let’s say the curator of this band.\n\nCan you tell me how you “survived” the pandemic as a band?\n\nWe simply did. It wasn’t very practical from time to time in terms of being able (or not) to go into our rehearsal space, practicing social distancing in a cramped room, etc. etc.. This band is not our main income, so we were not financially challenged by the inability to play live shows. We already started the writing sessions for Wave Cannon right before the pandemic hit, so we just made use of the opportunity that was presented by the plague and further finetuned the songs since we were not able to play shows. We recorded WC in the second half of 2021 right when things were loosening up a bit, COVID-wise. By the end of the year we went into a strict lockdown again so our timing was perfect. Wave Cannon is by no means a so called “COVID album” though.\n\nWhere do you live, and how does it affect your music?\n\nI live in Dordrecht, on the edge of the city with one leg in the countryside. Chris lives in Sliedrecht, a small village next to Dordrecht (we also have our rehearsal space there) and Klaas lives in Amsterdam. If I must make an estimation, I’d say this probably does not affect our music. At all.\n\nYou’ve been around for a while…can you describe how you have witnessed the stoner scene change overtime from the 90s till now? And for better or worse In your opinion?\n\nBeen around for a while: yes. Since the 90s? No. We’re not very young anymore but also not that old haha. The 90s were all about Nirvana and such for me, but I was actually way too young to really dive in deep during the first half of the 90s and attend shows. But anyway, the stoner scene. I don’t know man… I became aware of this during the early 00s I’d say. QOTSA was my gateway to Kyuss, then Sleep, then Electric Wizard, etc. etc.. I’d say we’re probably part of the second wave of “stoner” bands in the EU, the first wave being bands like Colour Haze, who were also spearheading a more sophisticated and less cavemen approach to the desert rock sound. Or maybe we’re an in-between generation, who knows. We’re the Xennials of EU stoner rock. No wait, we’re a NWOESR band.\n\nRemind me to put that in our bio. The Machine is a Dutch New Wave Of European Stoner Rock band. We started out and had our first show in 2007, which was already closing in on the end of this century’s first decade. The main difference between now and then is that there are way more bands and a lot of them are sounding similar to each other, copying copies of bands that were copying older bands to begin with and people seem to be easily satisfied by this. Which is fine by me; if you’re having a good time you’re doing it right, right? What comes in the slipstream of this phenomenon, is that there are also more and bigger festivals for instance. There’s more money involved and more money to be made in general for bands and promoters in this scene, which results in more professional festivals and better offers, both financially and exposure wise. Better or worse? Don’t know and it totally doesn’t matter. Like everything else it has its pros and cons. We’re grateful to be playing both big festival stages and small sweaty clubs. The combination of dirty hard work and luxurious fly-in shows keeps this thing interesting.\n\nWhat was your intention when writing and recording Wave Cannon, and how do you look back on creating it?\n\nAs always, it is the intention with every new album to release the best thing we’ve ever done up to that point. Both musically and production wise. It’s our seventh full length but the first album with Chris on board which made it a sort of a special one already right off the bat. Aside from that, there were no special plans or intentions or an overarching concept or anything. The only thing I decided for myself up front was that I wanted more and more interesting melodies for my vocals. For everything else it was: just write, jam on it and compose everything into a coherent song and let’s go. Repeat. Eventually Wave Cannon also turned out to be the last one with our original drummer, so it’ll probably prove to be a transitional album in another year or so.\n\nWho are your favorite music people in the world?\n\nThe other two guys in the band.\n\nWhich recent album has had the highest rotation this year so far?\n\nFor me personally, that’ll probably be a toss between God’s Country (Chat Pile) and Sleeping Beauty (I Like To Sleep). Klaas would probably say Downpour (Kanaan) and with Chris you never know, probably a hipster obscure-but-not-that-obscure indie garage band.\n\nHow was/has been playing with King Buffalo so far? And what are your further future plans?\n\nIt was a rather last minute action, but the support slot for this short run was offered to us by our longtime booking agency (Sound Of Liberation) as a way to at least be able to get out on the road and do some promotion for Wave Cannon. I told them late 2022 to put things on hold for us, because at that point we were suddenly without a drummer but with a scheduled album release date. Klaas joined relatively soon after and we became gig-ready pretty quickly. We then got back to SOL and asked to get us something so we could go out and play with the new lineup. Given the fact that tours normally need to be scheduled and financially planned at least 6-8 months up front in the post-COVID music industry, this slot (and the following shows in May and June) was a welcome opportunity to re-introduce the current The Machine to our existing fan base (and introduce ourselves to people that were not yet aware of us). We have a couple of shows left to do in June and then we’re having a live show break over the summer to focus on writing: we will start working on new material with the current lineup. We have plans for a run in December and other one-off shows are coming up, like Into The Void Festival in September (NL). Record a new album in 2024? Should be doable.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nListen to our new album Wave Cannon, obviously. In case they were already doing that while reading the interview: go get yourself a cup of coffee and start over with Wave Cannon.\n\nhttps://the-machine.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/themachine.nl\n\nhttps://themachineweb.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/majesticmountainrecords\n\nhttps://majesticmountainrecords.bigcartel.com\n\nWhen like minded people meet, beautiful things can grow. Take the instrumental brothers in arms Kombynat Robotron and DUNDDW; they found each other on the European road touring and immediately felt a connection. Now they release a stunning looking split vinyl record through a cool collaboration of labels allover the world and every fan of adventurous instrumental improvisational jams will rejoice.\n\nStriking in the first place about this split is the beautiful artwork, a piece of visual art by DUNDDW’s Huibert der Weduwen (also in Bismut and Phosphor visuals) depicting both bands’ practice spaces in Kiel, Germany, and Nijmegen, The Netherlands on an amazing looking old world map. Together with the blue/orange edition of the vinyl it makes up a package that will sell out quickly (and probably is by the time this article is published).\n\nBut hey, let’s not forget the music either. Of course we all know and love Kombynat Robotron and their organic sounding space jams. We get two for this record, and both radiate a comfortable warmth that make them very fitting for the weather at the moment. They are jams that make you long for the festival summer, lying on your back in a grass patch and spacing out of your wits.\n\nDUNDDW on the other hand is the lesser known of the two here. Of course we know Bismut, the thunderous instrumental stoner unit two thirds of this ensemble derives of, but with DUNDDW the scope is different, and the feel out of this world. It is a trio that starts out exploring themselves and the space they are in, and slowly but certainly they work their jams out into the very cosmos and its outer reaches. To boldly go where no one went before, and to do so intuitively, without any premeditated plans. It is a bold proposition, but DUNDDW makes. it work. We have not heard the last of them yet.\n\nFor this split release Weirdo Shrine decided to talk to both bands, and ask them the same sets of questions, about the album, and about each other. DUNDDW starts off, typing their answers on the road just returning from a gig in Germany, while Kombynat Robotron handed theirs in a little later because they were also in full tour mode. It is. a good time to be a jam band, that is for certain.\n\nDUNDDW:\n\nHow are you these days? What’s happening at the moment?\n\nAt the moment of answering these questions, we are driving home from a cool 3 day festival in the east of Germany: GockelScream (4th edition). We played a 45 minute jam in picturesque surroundings for a sympathetic crowd, alongside great bands like Bees Made Honey in the Vein Tree and Temple Fang.\n\nTell me about your new split album! What is the best thing about it?\n\nWe think it is a fruitful collaboration between 2 improvising bands, across different countries. With the labels Spinda Records (from Spain) and Sunhair Music (from Germany) involved in releasing the album, it feels like a great German/Spanish/Dutch partnership. Musically, it represents 2 different approaches to improvised music with a spacy and kraut-like sound.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the other band?\n\nNot much… just kidding: Kombynat Robotron is a great band, with jams that keep on going and evolving. They really know how to keep a flow going. We also admire their DIY-attitude, with an impressive variety of (solo and split) releases over the past couple of years. That has really solidified their reputation. The idea of the split album originated when Bismut shared the stage with KR at Altena Sounds (and helped them out with car troubles) – 2/3 of DUNDDW also play in Bismut.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the stunning artwork?\n\nWe are very fortunate to have a visual artist as one of our band members: Huibert is part of Phosphor Visuals: a collective that creates analog visuals at concerts. He made the artwork for the split. The attentive observer will see that the artwork also shows maps of the cities where Kombynat Robotron and DUNDDW rehearse/jam out (Kiel in Germany + Nijmegen in the Netherlands).\n\nWhat do you have in store for us in the near future? Will there be more collaborations?\n\nFor sure: we would love to do more collaborations with bands/artists that we like and are inspired by. So in the future we might release a live recording from a gig with a guest artist, or another split like this one.\n\nWhat tips/tricks can you teach us about learning to play improv/jams?\n\nDon’t think about it too much, and try to make contact with your band members. Not necessarily through eye contact, but by getting on the same wave length. Or ride another wave and see what happens: see where you find each other again, or let the waves intertwine or flow their own way. That’s the beauty of improv: there is no right or wrong, just vibrations that merge (and hopefully appeal to us and the listener).\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do after reading this interview?\n\nBuy the split album quickly, because it is almost sold out! And check out more Weirdo Shrine posts to find boundary streching music. And support your local scene.\n\nKombynat Robotron:\n\nHow are you these days? What’s happening at the moment?\n\nWe feel good these days and are happy to have the split with our friends of DUNNDW out now. The response so far is great and that´s something we needed yet. We changed our line-up and play as a three-piece now. With the first two shows a few weeks ago and this split record we know we’re on the right track and it feels good to be back after half a year of a break. All three of us playing in other bands that are more active these days, but its always good to come together and have some jams.\n\nTell me about your new split album! What is the best thing about it?\n\nThe split songs were recorded almost 1 1/2 a year ago in another session we had at the Dickfehler Studio in East Frisia. They are different as we jammed the songs and then re-recorded them. So, it´s not 100% improvised. More like 90%. :D. And that is the different and maybe the best thing about our side of the split. It’s a special form of KR music.\n\nAnd of course, it was a no-brainer to work with DUNNDW, Spinda Records and Sunhair Music together. What a pleasure all around!\n\nWhat can you tell me about the other band?\n\nWe know Peter and Huibert for a long time now. They played a few times with Bismut in our Hometown Kiel. and we met them on the road here and there. So it´s an absolute highlight to see them jamming with another guitarist and make some different music. We heard the tracks a couple of months ago and could not wait to get this project finalized.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the stunning artwork?\n\nIts Huibert´s magic. He came up with the idea to use parts of maps showing our locations of both bands’ rehearsal rooms. With that Psychedelic layer it matches perfect for the split album. Plus, our hometown looks pretty good from above.\n\nWhat do you have in store for us in the near future? Will there be more collaborations?\n\nWe have new album coming later this year on a label we worked together before. It’s from the same session as the split tracks are. And we hope to have another collab coming this or next year but it’s still in talks and we cant tell you any details yet. But when it will happen, it’s going to be huge! We played a video session in Lübeck a month ago, the videos will be online in a few weeks and of course we recorded some new material we are looking forward to release next year.. At the moment we’re working on the concept for that stuff. We have not many shows booked for this year, but we hope to play a little tour in the UK next year. If anybody wants to help feel free to hit us up, we appreciate the help.\n\nWhat tips/tricks can you teach us about learning to play improv/jams?\n\nJamming is very different in set and setting. When we started as a band, we had no concept or idea what direction it will take us.\n\nBut playing together over 5 years now, makes it easier to anticipate the vibe of each other.\n\nIts important to leave the ego outside and work as a unit. Its about communication, listening to each other and recognise space and sometimes step back and make room for your bandmates.\n\nWhen we recorded the sessions at the Dickfehler Studio, it was good to be in another place and have something like vacations to be on the same mindset.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do after reading this interview?\n\nCheck out all the labels we worked together and discover great bands.\n\nSupport the underground, go to concerts, buy merch and enjoy the growing scene.\n\nThanks for having us and thanks for reading.\n\nKombynat Robotron over and out.\n\nSchauen Sie nicht ins Licht\n\nhttps://spindarecords.bandcamp.com/album/split-lp\n\nhttps://dunddw.bandcamp.com/album/kombynat-robotron-dunddw-split\n\nhttps://kombynatrobotron.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttp://sunhair-music.de/\n\nMy first live review on this humble shrine of mine starts off with an apology. For I am truly sorry about my photography skills. While they say that a picture is worth a thousand words, I am afraid that I have to write a thousand more to make up for my lack of composition and sharpness. Please think of these images as pieces of evidence that I was truly there, and look up some better specimens online, which I am sure there will be plenty of as well…\n\nThe evening in my hometown of Maastricht was all about machines, it seemed. The Muziekgieterij venue is an old factory hall, and you could almost smell the machinery that would have been in it once. A good place for Dutch veteran stoner space rock band The Machine to show us their skills. With a brand new drummer and the shiny new album Wave Cannon on the merch table (which releases this Friday on Majestic Mountain Records) the band has definitely undergone some changes.\n\nBut when they start making noise, you wouldn’t tell, because this machine runs tightly enough, and even though they are just three guys they are perfectly able to reach the decibel limit. Their new songs especially stand out in heaviness, weirdness, and massiveness. The only time the Machine really falls flat is in between songs where the silence and the short interaction with the small Maastricht audience felt a bit awkward. An awkwardness that is easily forgiven and forgotten when they reinstate their unrelenting distortion wall of fuzz, reverb, and bleepy weirdness. At the end some of the necks in audience were well warmed up for the main course of today:\n\nKing Buffalo; is also a trio, but from New York, USA. The band has steadily released five studio albums since their magnificent debut Orion in 2016. Their sound has developed from a progressive psychedelic blues rock sound towards including more experiments in a krautrock/electronic direction, but never without losing any of its stoner heaviness.\n\nThe first time I saw King Buffalo after the pandemic was during the Four Day Marches Festival in Nijmegen. What I witnessed then was a machine, putting the emphasis heavily on their last album Regenerator, and being downright danceable in their electronic looping business. Today we see a different beast though.\n\nIn the more intimate setting of the small hall in Maastricht the band shows they show they can be more in contact with their audience as well, handling the interaction between songs naturally, and also adapting their set a bit. Of course King Buffalo still leans heaviest on their most current record Regenerator, with songs like Firmament, Mammoth, and the title track, but there is room for older gems as well. And a bluesier approach, with a lot of attention to McVay’s impressive loop pedal skills and his guitar acrobatics.\n\nA personal highlight formed the grand jam of Centurion, from the brilliant EP Repeater, in which the band embarks on their most massive and extensive riff wall of the evening. A riff wall formed by the many guitar parts looped by McVay, resulting in an ever growing sound experience that sees jaws dropping all round and heads bobbing of pretty much everyone present except maybe for the most stubborn bar hangers.\n\nFortunately there is little room for the much hated “Dutch disease”; the constant yapping throughout the concert. There is just no room for it, between McVay’s loop pedal acrobatics and the kinetic energy of his bands and the pounding rhythms. King Buffalo has got their hooves on us, and we love it. In fact we love it so much we cannot and will not let them go easily, the band is called back for an encore and with the much loved Orion from their debut album the band willing agrees and ultimately satisfies this fanboy and the newly created fanboys and girls in the rest of the audience.\n\nhttps://kingbuffalo.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/kingbuffaloband\n\nhttps://muziekgieterij.nl\n\nPNEM are a Dutch collective of artisan craftsmen who have focussed their skills and creativity on bringing us the finest semi-electronic kraut rock possible on this side of the 1970s. They wear their love for Neu!, Cluster, Kraftwerk and Harmonia on their sleeves, and take a modern run with it. The result can best be described as artful and reverend.\n\nArtful, because the music is so incredibly well constructed, and PNEM obviously takes a meticulous care of details and execution. Reverend because the music lives and breathes a deep respect for their musical ancestors. Both in terms of artwork and musical references. These guys know their classics, and they respectfully use the influences from the past to recreate it and add their personalities to it.\n\nSo far they have released two (digital) EPs; Circadian Rhythms and Public Spaces, which they combined for a physical release on Circadian Rhythms In Public Spaces, which was released on cassette last year by Fuzzed Up & Astromoon Records, and on vinyl this year by the band themselves. Those EPs show a more human side to this mostly instrumental quartet, featuring more frontal guitars, serving synths, and even some sparse vocals.\n\nFor the new full-length tape AM/FM the band has opted for a more synth heavy approach, pushing themselves ever further into electro kraut territories. The robotic character of the music fits the bleak dystopian times in which we live, and offer a cool retro-futuristic soundtrack to it. Considering the full current spectrum of 70s kraut inspired bands, PNEM are perhaps the best representation around right now.\n\nI found guitarist Niels Buijks on Instagram, and of course he was ready to tell us more about PNEM and what the band is all about. It turns out they are a more international operating entity than I thought…\n\nHow are you? How has the pandemic period been for PNEM?\n\nWe are doing good. The pandemic did slow some things down which was great. There was a bit of less in everything and less is often more.\n\nCan you introduce the band, and how did you meet, etc.?\n\nWe grew up in the same town and know each other since we were young. We have played music together for quite some time, I do not even remember how long, but I guess around 7 years. We were not so efficient in finishing tracks but since our synth player is involved our writing process is much smoother.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nWe listen to a big variety of music styles. From psych to piano and from electronic to world music. Music with improvisational and experimental character we find most exciting…\n\nWhat does a regular day in your lives look like?\n\nAll just have regular jobs.\n\nWhat is the best thing about FM/AM?\n\nFauna, Mecari, Amer I, II and III are all improvised during recording. We had some ideas of what to do with the tracks but did not structure anything. These tracks we had to record 1 or 2 times which was enough. Because of this the tracks feel natural and exciting.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your love for the cassette tape?\n\nOur record Circadian Rhythms in Public Spaces, which is just released on vinyl, was quite expensive in recording and pressing. Pressing plants were full in orders and it took one year! until the album finally arrived. Also vinyl is especially expensive in small quantities which makes it difficult or impossible to return all costs.\n\nWith FM/AM we tried to limit all costs and so we will still be able to bring out new music.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nWe all live in different city or even countries (Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam). With the music we play we experience it as a difficult environment for performances. Somehow we get more orders and requests from other countries.\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nStereolab, James Holden, Infuso Giallo, Loscil, Björn Torske, Tommy Guerrero, Battles, Nik Bartsch and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nAs said, we play together for already a long time, but we’re never able to finish stuff. All of our music is based upon improvisational jam sessions and so it was difficult to finish and record tracks. We have our own rehearsal room and record everything when we play together. We then load all potential sessions or tracks upon a cloud server. Everyone can listen the songs back, discover sick parts and leave comments for ideas.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nWe lately improved our recording gear and can make good quality recordings now at our studio. The idea is to release more often online in the form of single tracks or something. We are also planning to organize a small tour begin October in the UK.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nJump in the car, drive fast and listen to our music.\n\nhttps://pnem.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pnemfm\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/pnem\n\nFunus is a Dutch band that shows us the endless possibilities when we let go of genre limitations, and image boundaries. Originally an atmospheric black metal project, on Mono Funus have shed their blackened skin to tread dreamier waters. Not unlike Alcest‘s Neige, Funus’ Ruben Vermeulen has discovered there is freedom in being the sole captain of your musical ship. On Mono only the band’s logo still betrays its metal roots, the music goes in different directions.\n\nWith an echo-y reverb drenched base sound, Funus dives deep into melancholic dreams, conjuring images of modern day Katatonia, the aforementioned Alcest, as well as heavier shoegaze and post rock bands like Nothing, or Mono (Japan). It is music to drown yourself into, driving your head into a pillow and scream without sound.\n\nThere is a shadow looming over Mono, a dark spectre hovering over its beautiful landscape. In all its majestic grandure it is this melancholic blackness that gives Mono its depth. Its cinematic qualities show a movie that is hard to see, as it cuts deep into things better left buried. But you look anyway, touched by the imprint music can still make.\n\nMono shows us the grand, open views of metal, but adds believability and depth. It is a deep pleasure to immerse yourself into it and revel in its adventurous genre bending.\n\nCurious, I reached out to Funus master and creator Ruben Vermeulen, to ask him about his roots, his whereabouts, writing music by yourself, and his musical heroes. This is what he wrote:\n\nHow are you? How has the pandemic period been for Funus?\n\nAt the moment I’m a bit stressed. As an independent artist I am doing almost all band-related work myself: from recording music to reaching out for important connections. For the release of new album MONO there’s a lot of promotion work I’m doing. Gladly I’m getting help from Mike from Hard Life Promotion, who takes care of world wide press promotion for the new album. Next to that I think it’s very cool that some network connections we’ve been reaching out for already responded enthusiastically on the new album and show their interest. So it’s a bit stressful to organize all work, but the same time it’s exciting to see how people react on my newest work.\n\nThe pandemic was actually a good time for a one man band and studio musician behind Funus. During the lock downs I’ve been having lots of time to compose, record and produce the new album. That was all there was to do for me at that time so I think it fit well.\n\nCan you introduce Funus?\n\nFunus is to be recognized with its hazy, dreamy and heavy soundscapes in the style of post rock/shoegaze. Previous work was atmospheric black metal. Every song aims for one special tune, which expands into an atmospheric, hypnotizing loop to let your thoughts flow on. Lyrics and music are an expression of feelings of loneliness and self-confrontation: melancholic themes every one sooner or later needs to deal with in life. I compose, perform and produce all music myself.\n\nFunus was founded in 2006. Back then I had some guitar recordings I used for the first demo (Funus, 2009). I noticed it got received well by the audience in The Netherlands, so I asked some fellow musicians I hung out with to collaborate and perform Funus’ music on stage. After some time with great gigs, other priorities per individual session member made that we stopped as a live band in 2012. That didn’t change anything for me, actually, because I wrote all music for Funus from the beginning. So I moved on and wrote first full length concept album Adrift Alone (2016). You now might assume that name refers to this situation, but it’s rather a symbolic name for the theme of this album: the five stages of loss and grief by psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical background?\n\nI started playing drums on my 10th and electric guitar on my 16th, which lead to my first (punk) band. From my 18th on I got to play guitar and drums in several band formations. I have always loved writing pieces of music with the guitar and a keyboard back then, so that’s what I mostly did. Next to that I regularly got involved with studio recordings and mixing sessions with the bands I participated in. This lead to a growing interest in music production, which is what I’m doing now next to writing and playing.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your life look like?\n\nGet up, drink coffee and give a hug to my wife and going to work. I work as a supervisor for people who live in an assisted-living situation. When I have spare time, I love walking with our adopted stray dog. Doing other essential things like doing groceries, cleaning/maintaining the house and taking care of administration. When I have spare time, I like to be alone and write music and watch psychological and science fiction films with my wife.\n\nWhat is the best thing about Mono?\n\nFirstly, the atmosphere and sound I created with the mixture of instruments I used. I just love the 90’s style Shoegaze sound on which you can let your thoughts go freely. I think I’ve done a decent job making an album with an own atmosphere and sound inspired by that. Secondly, “MONO” refers to dealing with your own problems in life, in which I have plenty of experience, and I think that message has been given form well.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nI live in a small town in the northern part of The Netherlands. The local environment consists of a beautiful area full of farmlands, marshes and forest areas. The silence there is very calming, which gives me a lot of space for inspiration.\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nI’ve been thinking about this question for days, but I just can’t come up with any contemporary musical heroes. To me the musical heroes are from the past because of their golden days area back then (David Gilmour, Jimmy Hendrix and Greg Lake). I though can think of my favorite bands of the present, which are without a doubt Motorpsycho and King Buffalo. I think it’s incredible how they manage to keep on making just really, really good music in a creative way, which also gets me every time.\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nAt first I always get a spontaneous tune coming up in my head, after which I try to get the guitar as soon as possible to play that tune out of my head and record it. Then I give it lots of time by listening to it and playing it again, so I can make room for trying out more parts to fit with it. This way I’m creating a basic song structure. In the next step I try gluing these pieces together, which is the hardest part to me, because this can make or break the song. When I think I succeeded with that, I pre-record this basic song in the studio, giving it more time to listen to and adjust it when I think it’s needed. In my head I then automatically have come up with other instrument layers, like vocals, drums and lead guitar, which I record as well. This is a process of just trying out, being creative and judge what sounds good to me. When I’m done with this, I save it and use more time by listening to it later again. That way I can finetune the song until I think the pre-recording of the song is done. When I have a bunch of pre-recorded songs done, it’s time to record the definitive versions.\n\nTalking about recording specifically: it’s one of the hardest parts to me, because the sound of every individual recorded instrument has to fit with each other like an audio puzzle, without losing quality, clarity and the intention of the sound. This process consists out of trying to catch that specific sound I came up with in my head, by placing the right microphone in the right position of the audio source in the right place of the right room. Right on!\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nI’m working on a promotion campaign for the release of MONO together with Hard Life Promotion. Next to that I work on a next release, which leads to the future plans of Funus. I want to keep on writing music, getting better in it, working together with guest artists and sculpting out the sound more that way. My goal is to put a stamp on the music scene with Funus.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nAlways be both your own biggest fan as well as your own greatest criticist. Also, always believe in yourself, no matter what. If I managed to have gotten your interest, I’m convinced you know how to find Funus to check it out.

And yet, they have not recorded a single studio album to this day. They did do two amazing live albums (Live at Merleyn from 2022, and Fang Temple from 2021) but this EP is actually their fist attempt at some studio magic. And magical it is! There are two longform songs on here, Jerusalem, and The Bridge.\n\nJerusalem is a strong song with huge vocal choruses and deep noodling valleys. It soars epically, combining elements of space rock, stoner, and more progressive elements , ultimately building their own house that is not linked to any other. The Bridge opens up a completely different side of the band, a much calmer version of Temple Fang with a vibe that reminds of Black Sabbath‘s Planet Caravan. Together they show two faces of a band that has in fact many more in them. Just visit one of their live shows to see those. I for one, would welcome a full studio album of their musical prowess like the force they show on display here. Until then, this EP will have to make do.\n\nI talked to bass guitarist and vocalist Dennis Duijnhouwer, who introduces the band and carefully explains their story. A story that might have just begun…\n\nHow are you? How has the pandemic period and its aftermath\n\nbeen for Temple Fang?\n\nMany bands will tell you a similar story, it’s really hard to keep a band together when the thing that bonds you, playing your music for a live audience, falls away for that long. We tried everything we could to stay active and keep the feeling of a band as a gang, but we still ended up losing a member and almost breaking up. When we found our current drummer Egon, we decided to ditch all we had done before, create some new jams and when things opened back up, we hit the road as hard as we could. Since then we’ve played a zillion shows and have really found a new commitment to doing Temple Fang. We are very grateful for this amazing tour season, everyone was so starving for live-music it made for an intense shared experience.\n\nCan you introduce the band, and how did you meet?\n\nJevin de Groot (vox, guitar) and me met when I was doing a barshift and was playing this CD-R from a band called Slint, an album called Spiderland, something I had then recently\n\ndiscovered and was obsessed with. It was kind of my own private secret this record as I didn’t really know anyone who was into this. Jevin walked in the place and immediately came up to the counter and yelled “Spiderland!” at me, we struck up a conversation about this masterpiece and I ended up giving him the CD when he left. Some time later I walked into a rock bar in Amsterdam called the Pits and saw him fronting a band called The Felchers, I had an overwhelming sense of needing to connect with him and do music together, and that just so happened not long after when one of the bands he played in, a punk band named Brezhnev, needed a bass player and we went on our first tour together. (Interesting side note, my former bandmate Oeds Beydals (Iron Jinn) had also walked into that same bar, saw Jevin and decided to dedicate himself to electric guitar.).\n\nIvy van der Veer (guitar) was a kid I had heard about around town, he was in a whole bunch of bands either playing guitar or drums, and when a friend played me some recordings he was on I made a mental note that if I ever needed a guitar player he would be the guy I’d call first, very musical dude.\n\nEgon Loosveldt (drums) we met through our drum auditions when we lost our first drummer. We were already kind of done with the auditions when Egon send us a very sincere and interesting email, saying he saw us play Sonic Whip festival in Nijmegen in 2019 and he imagined himself to be our drummer. It took one jam with him to realize he was indeed our guy, we took that jam and basically turned it into the set we’ve been playing on this tour.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical backgrounds?\n\nOh, that’s a complicated subject. I guess we all have very seemingly contradictory backgrounds. For example, Jevin is the biggest Grateful Deadhead I know, but the first band we played in together was a punk band so besides being a ’70s psychnoodler, he’s also an amazing Ramones style, punk-rock downstroker. Also, listening to him playing Willy Nelson songs in soundcheck is a real treat. Ivy’s first band was a Poison Idea cover-band and he still plays drums in a punk band with his dad called Teenage Tits but is also probably the biggest Yes fan in the band, he might be the most prog guy in Temple Fang. And he has an Opeth tattoo… Egon’s background is still a bit of a mystery to us, he’s definitely the most musically trained person in the band, he’s a jazz guy but he’s always had a thing for loud, underground\n\nguitar music. Egon loves Norwegian jazz-rock, Motorpsycho, Elephant 9, Needlepoint and such. But he’s also spend a lot of time in South America and has strong connections with that scene. As for me, I’ve always kind of been all over the place musically. I was into terrible guitar-shredding when I was a kid and things like Zappa. Since then I’ve expanded my influences to include everything from John Coltrane, Bad Brains, Mahavisnu Orchestra. And Hendrix of course. I have to mention one album in particular that changed the course of my personal musical journey, when I heard Tool-Undertow I got so obsessed with the\n\nbass sound on that record I ended up trading my strat in for a Rickenbacker bass.\n\nFurthermore, the past few years I’ve been really tryin to focus on songwriting and trying to learn from the greats, so I take a lot of influence from Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and such. And contemporary artists like Weyes Blood.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your life look like?\n\nFor me right now, TF is pretty much a full time job. I get up in the morning, do some yoga, then start answering emails, checking mixes, collecting artwork ideas from Jevin, uploading\n\nrehearsal recordings, working on new music ideas etc. Lately it’s been hard to find, but I’ll try to get some ‘me’ time in later in the evening, to get in my creative zone, which could consist of me playing bass along to dub records, writing ‘poetry’, listening to records, just anything that has no real purpose behind it other than just being in the moment. Or just getting lost in youtube rabbit holes and feeling really dirty after that.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the way you have released albums so far? It’s far from the conventional “studio album cycle” right?\n\nJevin says it best, we work with what’s in front of us. Because our creative process is so collective, it’s difficult to make a solid plan and stick to it. So we just kind of wander in the dark until we find something. Now our band is becoming a bit more of a ‘career’, there’s a bit more pressure to follow ‘album cycles’ but we try to work with labels that understand our way of working and respect it. We try not to make much of a difference between live albums, studio albums, EP’s or whatever, there all just things that we do that capture us wherever we are at a particular moment.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nWe live and operate from Amsterdam, Holland. Ivy grew up here and me and Jevin have lived here for a long time. To say there’s a ‘scene’ here for what we do would be lying, we’ve got a network of friends who are all involved in music and art but everyone is operating in different ‘scenes’. Amsterdam is a difficult city for bands, it’s expensive and crowded and being dominated by money and the people involved in that. We’re lucky to have a great studio now, after having been pushed around by gentrification for years. We’ll just have to wait til the neo-liberal system eats itself and collapses and then artists can move back to this beautiful city and create something new from the rubble.\n\nWhat are your favorite contemporary bands and albums right now?\n\nWe’ve played a ton of ’stoner’ festivals this year which made us pretty weary of downtuned Kyuss/Sleep influenced bands, but there’s been a handful of bands we’ve seen and played with that blew us away, Elder, Yob, Ecstatic Vision, Spill Gold, Neptunian Maximalism to name a few. We’re always curious to see what Motorpsycho and King Gizzard put out, or guitar pickers like Steve Gunn or Ryley Walker. Daniel Romano I’ve been obsessing over lately and also, this 2019 record by Dutch singer Eefje de Visser called Bitterzoet has been on repeat. And I’ve been deep diving in the new Richard Dawson record, the ambition he displays on a songwriting level is something I take a lot of inspiration from.\n\nAnd because of my friend Abel from Hang Youth, I’ve been deep-diving into a lot of modern Dutch hiphop, the grimier, the better. I bet no one expects someone in TF to be influenced by Mula B, but I am.\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nAlso in Jevin’s words, we work in layers. So a song that may be birthed as a riff or chord progression one of us has, gets taken to rehearsal, jammed on, rewritten, tried live a couple times, rewritten again etc. Sometimes there’s themes that keep coming back in jams that eventually become songs of their own. It rarely works if one of us brings a complete song in, I wish it was that easy, but it’s not. And songs keep changing after they’re recorded too, that’s why a song might be on multiple albums we do. Also lately we’ve been embracing riffs or melodies being in different songs, we’ve stopped resisting such things, it’s just\n\nhow it works for us.\n\nWhat is “the dream” when it comes to being an artist?\n\nWe’re sort of constantly in a creative zone, our music is in a constant state of flux and there’s always new things happening. If my biggest nightmare is playing in a band doing the same set over and over or having to play the ‘hits’, then this must be the dream!\n\nWhat are your upcoming plans, and what are you looking\n\nforward to most? We’re putting a new EP out on 29-11 and have a new release after that already in the works, more on that soon. Most looking forward to the next rehearsal, we’re working on a bunch of new music that’s starting to take shape so I’m always excited to see what’s gonna happen to these pieces.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nTake a moment to count your blessings that there’s bands out there really going for it, putting in the time and the miles on the road. We’ve all missed it so much, we should never take it for granted! Peace, XO DD/TF\n\nhttps://templefang.bandcamp.com/album/jerusalem-the-bridge\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/templefangband\n\nhttps://www.electricsparkrecords.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/templefang/"
