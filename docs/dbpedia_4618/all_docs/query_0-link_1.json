        "text": "In 1990 Slowdive signed to Creation and were dubbed â€˜the My Bloody Valentine Creation can affordâ€™. Producing three albums for the label before disbanding whilst Oasis-fever swept the nation. Since 1995 Rachel has been a member of Mojave 3 who have been signed to 4AD since they started.\n\nWe caught up with Rachel whilst sheâ€™s recording the new Mojave 3 album due for release Spring 2003.\n\nTell us about how you first started playing in bands.\n\nMy father got me interested in playing the guitar around the age of seven. I studied classical guitar til about the age of 14 and also piano. I decided to start a band with a female friend at school aged 15. The school youth wing had musical equipment there, so one Sunday I went along with my friend Alison and got Neil to set up all this gear. He was the youth leaderâ€™s prefect. The following week, Alison decided she didnâ€™t want to be in a band anymore, I went along to the youth club anyway, and Neil had set everything up. We just started playing together from then on.\n\nHow did you first meet Neil?\n\nWe went to the same primary and secondary schools. My best friendâ€™s mother taught us both classical guitar. We used to pass each other between lessons at her house. We shared some classes together in secondary school but never particularly spoke. It wasnâ€™t til the Sunday youth club that anything happened.\n\nWhat were your main influences in those early days?\n\nThe Primitives, MBV, JAMC, House of Love, Velvet Underground to name but a few!\n\nHow did you meet the other guys in Slowdive?\n\nWe advertised for a female guitarist and Christian was the only one that responded. He said he would wear a dress if necessary. I canâ€™t remember now how Nick came to be in the band. He may have been a friend of our first drummer, Adrian.\n\nDo you have any particular memories of when you first signed to Creation?\n\nNot really. I remember McGee telling me that JD & Coke was the best drink around. And he gave me my first E at a Primal Scream gig at the Hammersmith Palais.\n\nWhat other acts on the label did you like?\n\nI loved Swervedriver to death. And of course, Ride and MBV.\n\nYou received loads of press attention immediately after releasing the first single, was this hard to handle?\n\nNot really. Memories of it was that it was just a real high, but we were waiting after each record for the backlash to begin. Hence the title of the third EP â€“ â€˜Holding Our Breathâ€™ (waiting for the backlash!)\n\nAre there any particular gigs that standout from that era?\n\nKilburn National supporting Ride . The biggest gig we had done at that point. Three thousand people. I was very scared.\n\nThe press started a backlash when grunge came along and killed off Souvlaki and Pygmalion in the UK before they were even released. Did this come as a bit of a shock at the time?\n\nNot at all! The press creates the hype. The press kills the hype. It was frustrating, but not the be all and end all, we were still having an amazing time stateside and in the rest of Europe, so the UK is really small fry.\n\nBy the time you released Pygmalion, Creation must have changed beyond recognition, were you happy to leave or would you have liked Mojave 3 to have been on the label?\n\nHappy to leave. It was inevitable and we felt unsupported by Creation towards the end. The label itself was pretty disfunctional by that point.\n\nCopies of Pygmalion now exchange hands for stupid money (Â£100+ on vinyl and Â£30+ on CD). Does it surprise you given the minimal success the album received when released?\n\nYes. Itâ€™s quite cool though ðŸ™‚\n\nHow did Slowdive come to an end?\n\nWe were dumped by Creation and Neil & I decided to continue on our own. The interband relationships werenâ€™t that great by that point anyway. Nick had already pretty much left the band and was married and settled. Both he and Christian showed little interest in the recording of Pygmalion, Simon had left during this time also, partly because he thought he was being replaced by a drum machine, and partly because heâ€™d done a stupid thing at one of our last shows. Neil & I had stuck together throughout all the shit, and decided to continue without the others.\n\nDo you still stay in touch with the other guys?\n\nI occasionally chat online with Nick & Christian.\n\nHow did Mojave 3 and the 4AD deal come about?\n\nWe still had a deal with EMI Publishing after the dumping from Creation, and utilised that, by using their studio to record demos (Which makes up most of â€˜Ask Me Tomorrowâ€™), we sent a copy to Ivo and within four weeks, had a new deal being offered by 4AD. So it was pretty easy really.\n\nHave you had a chance to listen to Christianâ€™s band Monster Movie?\n\nNo I havenâ€™t, but I hear good things about them. Heâ€™s a talented chap, he was always quietly good at writing songs I thought during the Slowie days. Never had enough confidence in himself. I see that in other people I know now. Itâ€™s frustrating. But Iâ€™m glad he is still making music.\n\nNeil recently released a solo album, did you like it?\n\nYes I do. It was a long time coming as heâ€™s talked about doing his own thing for years. Finally he got to make a record that is all about him and not about compromising with four other people!\n\nDid it seem strange with him playing gigs this summer without you for the first time in over a decade?\n\nA bit I suppose, but itâ€™s good to have your independence!!\n\nI understand youâ€™re making a solo album yourself at the moment, is there anything you can tell us about that yet?\n\nIâ€™ve recorded four songs so far and should have it finished next spring. itâ€™s pencilled for release next autumn. Iâ€™m also doing a couple of moonlighting jobs for other bands but thatâ€™s all I can say about that at the moment. I recorded a cover of â€˜Ifâ€™ for a Bread tribute album that it being released next January I think, in the US. The new Mojave album is due for release next Spring.\n\nMorr Records recently released a Slowdive Tribute album. Have you had a chance to listen to that yet?\n\nYes I have. Itâ€™s weird listening to other peoples interpretations of your songs. Some good covers on there though. Makes me feel a bit long in the tooth to be having a tribute album done.\n\nHow does it make you feel with Slowdive finally gaining so much respect after all these years?\n\nHappy that people have finally realised we did some good stuff!\n\nFinally, have you got a message for the kids today?\n\nGrab every opportunity life throws at you and laugh as much as you can!\n\nInterview: October 2002"
