        "text": "With the recent release of their debut EP, we caught up with rising shoegazers Lemondaze.\n\nNorth-London based threesome Lemondaze dropped their debut four-track EP 'Celestial Bodies' just a couple of days ago, and it's one you definitely do not want to sleep on. Heavily drawing influence from the nineties, the EP is dark, grungy and full of angst. It's the perfect mix of nineties-inspired haze blended with modern-day musical hypnosis: swirly guitars, plenty of delay and lots and lots of reverb! What's not to love?\n\nHaving gained praise from some of their idols, including Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice and Rachel Goswell of Slowdive, it's clear that Lemondaze is a band worth watching!\n\nLemondaze is Isis De Chastelain, Rosie Heard-Edwards, and Jonty Freeman.\n\nHow do you describe your music in three words?\n\nIsis: Hazey, intense, atmospheric\n\nRosie: dreamy, dark, loud\n\nWhere are you from - and what’s the best and worst thing about the place?\n\nWe're from Cambridge!!\n\nWorst thing: The regal wetherspoon\n\nBest thing: The free roaming cows\n\nIf you had to attribute one thing that’s responsible for getting you into music (whether that be a person, moment, artist etc) what would it be?\n\nRosie: The Slowdive Pitchfork documentary\n\nIsis: S club 7\n\nWhat are most of your lyrics centred around?\n\nRosie: Spacey-o\n\nIsis: Space and lesbianism\n\nMost ‘pinch yourself’ moment so far?\n\nThis\n\nWhat’s the first song of yours that people should listen to and why?\n\nRosie: Art Form, because we've only got 2 songs out and this is my favourite\n\nIsis: Defo Art Form, it’s my fave song of ours atm\n\nThe three main artist inspirations for your music?\n\nRosie: Curve, Wolf Alice and SPC ECO\n\nIsis: Slowdive, Wolf Alice and Curve\n\nWhat’s your band/ artist aesthetic?\n\nRosie: It’s definitely a mixture, Jonty is more moody skateboard teen, Isis is bondagey scary and I’m more silky, sparkly and pretty dresses\n\nIsis: I think we all have our own personal styles but I think we all gravitate towards the colour blue and we definitely love spacey and hazey stuff which our artwork shows\n\nOther than music - what are you really passionate about?\n\nRosie: Photography and nothing else\n\nIsis: This past year I have really started getting into drag artistry and I am obsessed with BIMINI BON BOULASH!! And also playing breath of the wild.\n\nWhat would you have been if you weren't a musician?\n\nRosie: fashion photographer\n\nIsis: Idk, something arty and creative I think\n\nWhat’s the best song for lifting you out of a bad mood?\n\nRosie: Get Shaky - Ian carey project"
