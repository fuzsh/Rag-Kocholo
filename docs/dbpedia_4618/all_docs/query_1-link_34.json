        "text": "Slowdive singer Rachel Goswell recently revealed she could not bring herself to watch Danny O’Connor’s 2010 documentary about the band’s former label, Creation Records. When they were cast cruelly aside by Alan McGee’s indie powerhouse after Creation’s darling signing Oasis conquered the world, for Slowdive the 90s was a decade of unfulfilled potential.\n\nThey were also punching bags for the vituperative music press: Melody Maker notoriously likened their second LP, Souvlaki, to “choking in a bath full of porridge”.\n\nGoodness, how these icons of the woozy shoegaze scene have rebounded though. First, with a heartbreakingly beautiful self-titled comeback album in 2017. Now, via the gorgeous, gripping and, in places, dazzlingly dark Everything is Alive.\n\nClocking in at an economical eight tracks, Slowdive’s fifth long-player and their second since reforming in 2014 makes a strong case for shoegaze as one of the most misunderstood genres of recent decades. In the early 90s, it was written off as self-indulgent music for soppy recluses; prog rock without the bonus Lord of the Rings references or sci-fi cover art.\n\nThirty years later, the idea of music for introverts is no longer taboo. For that reason, Slowdive’s mix of ASMR vocals, doomed romance, and thoughtfully apocalyptic guitars packs a punch in a way that feels entirely modern. It’s bedroom pop with the roof off, and the afterburners dialled up to the max.\n\nGoswell’s voice – if only there were another word for it besides “ethereal” – brims with haunting clarity on rumbling opener “Shanty”. Slowdive next slide into heartfelt post-rock on the throbbing “Prayer Remembered”. It’s a pensive piledriver that lands like Mogwai trapped inside a Christopher Nolan movie.\n\nEverything is Alive came together in fits and starts during the pandemic. It was also recorded against the background of two band members each losing a parent. But for all the ennui filtered through songwriter Neil Halstead’s riffing, Slowdive looks to the future with optimism on lilting single “Kisses”.\n\nA tearful odyssey finishes magnificently with “The Slab”, which sounds like The Cure passing through a supernova. As with the rest of the album, it is intimate, epic, and never less than spectacularly gorgeous."
