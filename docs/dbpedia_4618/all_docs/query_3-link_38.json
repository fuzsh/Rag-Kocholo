        "text": "“Folk Arp” feels like the centerpiece of the album. What do you remember about putting that song together?\n\nBraithwaite: It was the first song I put forward for the record. Ultimately it changed a lot from the very start. It’s nice to do music and then have someone else do vocals over the top. People never do what you expect. To be honest, no one in Mogwai writes very many words or particularly enjoys singing, so it’s nice working with Rachel on this.\n\nTrending\n\nHow have your bands responded to the material?\n\nGoswell: The guys in Slowdive have been really positive. Christian [Savill] and Nick [Chaplin] came to see us in London. They really loved it.\n\nBraithwaite: Martin [Bulloch] from Mogwai is playing drums with us live, so he’s not allowed to say he doesn’t like it [laughs]. We were at the studio while I was doing the guitar and Dominic [Aitchison] was pretty surprised about it, how it sounded. I remember him saying that it was a lot more pop, but not like a negative. I guess he just had an idea in his mind of what it would sound like. They’re totally into it too.\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nWhat has it been like to play these songs live?\n\nBraithwaite: It proved to me that we could play a concert with hardly any rehearsals [laughs]. It was loads of fun.\n\nGoswell: It was nerve-racking at the beginning. That first show, which happened to be London, I hadn’t been that nervous in a long time.\n\nBraithwaite: It was quite nerve-racking. It’s a weird feeling when you’re so used to playing with the same people.\n\nGoswell: It was good fun. We did four shows on our mini U.K. run. Certainly by the end of it we were on fire. The last show we did in Glasgow was the best – for me, personally, in terms of what I was doing.\n\nSlowdive is in the process of working on new material, as well. How’s that going?\n\nGoswell: Coming along very nicely, thank you. Contrary to what was said in the last interview I did, we hope to finish the recording in July and expect it to come out next year. I think we’ll be mixing it at the end of the summer. I’m biased, but I’m happy with what we’ve done.\n\nIs the long-distance model something more acts should consider in the future?\n\nBraithwaite: I think a lot of people would be a little too precious to do this. We went into this with really good spirit and a lot of trust in each other. A lot of musicians need minute-to-minute discussions about how things go. Quite often, bands have members that are pretty precious. Thankfully, no band I’ve ever been in [laughs].\n\nGoswell: You have to say that, don’t you, Stuart?\n\nBraithwaite: I don’t think it’s going to overtake everyone getting into a room and playing, but it’s good to know that there are other ways to make records.\n\nGoswell: I agree with you. Slowdive, the way we’ve done this record we’re working on wouldn’t work. Everyone feeds off of each other in a live environment.\n\nWill you make more Minor Victories recordings this way?\n\nGoswell: Not sure, really. Justin’s keen to use the same process for the next record. With time constraints for all of us, it may be on a practical level that this is the only way we can do it. Certainly it worked for us the first time."
