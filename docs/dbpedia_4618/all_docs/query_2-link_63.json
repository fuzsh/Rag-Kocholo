        "text": "Alternative Music Playlists – Vol. 48: 2023\n\nListen To The List: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5G7UWtmFgkxdlr67StUYWP?si=abfdc506e8204763\n\nAlternative music in the year 2023 can mean a lot of different things. Many of the early first wave bands are still making good music for their old fans and many new ones who rightly understand their importance and impact. Then there are the alt rock bands of the 1990’s and early 2000’s that were important and popular when alternative music was at its commercial/mainstream zenith. Finally, there are the newer bands of the past decade or so (including the current new cool artists) that have continued to make alternative music in the age of streaming and the internet. Many of these bands are excellent but have not garnered the same widespread appeal because music is in such a fractured age. Still, alternative rock is well into its third full generation as we get close to the 50th anniversary of punk rock exploding onto the scene in the late 70’s and changing everything. So, in 2023, alternative rock is something of a grab bag of styles, genres, and eras, that sometimes have little in common other than the desire to be different, do something new, or challenge listeners. A different person could compile a different list to represent the year gone by and be perfectly correct. This is one reflection on the state of alternative rock in 2023.\n\n“Carry You Home” – Circa Waves From the album Never Going Under\n\nCirca Waves capture the sound and spirit of newer bands in 2023 very well. On their fifth album Never Going Under the four-piece from Liverpool combines indie rock, 80’s-influenced new wave, and pop to create a modern-sounding fusion of those styles that is filled with plenty of hooks and melody. One of the best songs on Never Going Under is the slightly maudlin “Carry You Home” and it represents the sound of newer alt music in 2023 very well.\n\n“This Is Why” – Paramore From the album This Is Why\n\nParamore had been one of the most lasting of the emo and punk-pop bands of the early 00’s before going on hiatus so that singer/leader Hayley Williams could work on some solo material. However, with emo and pop-punk music having a comeback moment of sorts in the past year or two, it makes sense for Paramore to return. Indeed, the announcement of a Paramore reunion and new album came with a fair amount of positivity from both fans and critics. “This Is Why”, the title track from the new album is a clever and catchy mix of the older Paramore sound with some influences from Hayley Williams’ excellent solo work.\n\n“Tropic Morning News” – The National From the album First Two Pages Of Frankenstein\n\nThe National have slowly built up their reputation and fanbase until they have become one of the most successful bands in alternative rock, and they have done it without ever really scoring a mainstream hit. The National released two albums in 2023 with First Two Pages Of Frankenstein and Laugh Track, both very good albums that hone their sound more than expand it (indeed, in some ways they even pull back a little from the electronic experiments of their previous albums). That said, these albums are nuanced, quietly simmering gems that feature many superb songs. One of the best of these is the first single from First Two Pages Of Frankenstein, the propulsive yet melancholy “Tropic Morning News”, a song that perfectly captures both the sound and the general feeling of The National at their very best.\n\n“Cool About It” – Boygenius From the album The Record\n\nBoygenius is the female singer/songwriter collective of Pheobe Bridgers, Julien Baker, and Lucy Dacus. The three women first set aside their successful solo careers to release an EP together as Boygenius in 2018. However, 2023 saw them come together to release their first full album The Record, which became a major critical (and decent commercial) success. “Cool About It” is a folky, country-influenced song that evokes Laurel Canyon vibes even while vaguely recalling the Simon & Garfunkel classic “The Boxer” in its melody and overall tone. It’s a quiet and lovely song from some of the most talented artists making music right now.\n\n“King Of Oklahoma” – Jason Isbell & The 400 Unit From the album Weathervanes\n\nJason Isbell has been on a hot streak over the past few years and that run continued in 2023 which saw Isbell star in the Martin Scorcese film Killers Of The Flower Moon. His 2023 album, recorded with his usual band The 400 Unit, is a set of songs inspired by his work on the film. Weathervanes is not the soundtrack for the movie, but rather songs inspired by the themes and tone of the film, and “King Of Oklahoma” is both one of the standout tracks and a good example of the film’s themes serving as his muse.\n\n“If You’re Gonna Break My Heart” – Inhaler From the album Cuts & Bruises\n\nIt is not singer Elijah Hewson’s fault that he sounds so much like his famous father, but at least for me, it is so hard to hear Inhaler (who I really do enjoy) and not make comparisons to U2. To be fair, Inhaler has made attempts to step out of U2’s shadow and much of Cuts & Bruises finds the band staking claim on its own sonic territory. However, one of the album’s best songs is the warm, soulful ballad “If You’re Gonna Break My Heart”, which is both a great song on its own merits and (perhaps unfairly) a song that feels like it would have been perfectly at home on U2’s homage to America Rattle & Hum.\n\n“An Arrow In The Wall” – Death Cab For Cutie From the non-album single “An Arrow In The Wall”\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie never put out a bad album and have become one of the most successful bands of the 21st century. That said, on 2022’s album Asphalt Meadows the band felt reinvigorated. 2023 saw Death Cab leader Ben Gibbard in the spotlight as he celebrated the 20th anniversary of both Death Cab For Cutie’s classic album Transatlanticism and The Postal Service’s Give Up; touring with both bands at once and playing both records in their entirety. Death Cab For Cutie didn’t release a new record in 2023 but the band did put out the stand-alone single “An Arrow In The Wall” as a new song to promote the tour. The song continues the more experimental tone of many of the songs on Asphalt Meadows while also having a vaguely electronic vibe to it that at least echoes Gibbard’s work with his Postal Service side project. The song was somewhat overlooked but is another very good song from the boys in Death Cab For Cutie.\n\n“Bauhaus Staircase” – OMD From the album Bauhaus Staircase\n\nOrchestral Manoevres in the Dark have had an incredible late-career revival over the past few years with albums like History of Modern, English Electric, The Punishment of Luxury, and the single “Don’t Go” (which is included on their 2023 album Bauhaus Staircase even though it was first released in 2019). OMD’s new album Bauhaus Staircase is not quite as consistent as those other records in my opinion but it is still a solid listen with several excellent songs. One of the more noteworthy songs is the title track “Bauhaus Staircase” which finds OMD trying to find a happy midpoint between their more experimental artistic side and their more pop-oriented dance/club music. “Bauhaus Staircase” is a bright, uptempo number that still manages to feel like it is connected to their weirder, more artistic and experimental detours.\n\n“Your Side Of Town” – The Killers From the compilation album Rebel Diamonds\n\nThe Killers were always rooted in the electronic and new wave music of the 1980’s but they have never felt quite so connected to the disco sound of the late 70’s and early 80’s as they do on their new single “Your Side Of Town”. It is a sound that is both familiar for The Killers and, yet, a little bit new and different as well. A welcome addition (along with last year’s “Boy” and another new song called “Spirit”) to a new best-of compilation that The Killers released.\n\n“Ghosts Again” – Depeche Mode From the album Memento Mori\n\nDepeche Mode released their best album in years with 2023’s Memento Mori, an album that seemed to draw on nearly all eras of the band’s career and find a way to blend the various sounds and styles into something interesting. A variety of factors may have helped Memento Mori be a stronger album than their recent records. Perhaps Martin Gore and Dave Gahan, the two remaining members, were refocused by the unexpected death of their friend and fellow bandmember Andy Fletcher early in the recording of the album. Gore’s choice to work with an outside songwriting partner for the first time (Richard Butler of Psychedelic Furs) also possibly brought a new spark to the songs. Certainly, the lead single “Ghosts Again”, co-written with Butler, feels like a near-classic Depeche Mode single with its pulsing electronics, defiantly optimistic lyrics, and chiming synths. Indeed, it was a perfect lead single for the album, which deals with themes of mortality and life, darkness and light, across the record. All themes that are made more poignant with the loss of Fletcher. It is unclear if this is the end of Depeche Mode or just the start of another new chapter, but either way, Memento Mori is a fitting record.\n\n“Alife” – Slowdive From the album Everything Is Alive\n\nShoegaze music is another 90’s genre that is having a revival of sorts and Slowdive, always among the more melodic of the shoegaze bands, put out one of the best albums of their career with 2023’s Everything Is Alive. “Alife” wraps its pop-oriented hooks and melody in a gauzy film of sound and production, while Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell intertwine their voices over and through it. In the process making “Alife” feel both strangely current and like a perfect throwback to when alt rock ruled the radio.\n\n“Vampire” – Olivia Rodrigo From the album Guts\n\nOn one level Olivia Rodrigo is undoubtedly a pop singer, but it is undeniable that Rodrigo also is playing a large role in reviving many older alt rock styles as she knowingly draws on nervy new wave like Elvis Costello, bratty pop-punk like Avril Lavigne, and Lilith Fair alt rockers like Alanis Morissette, for a new generation. “Vampire” takes the teenage drama of her earlier hits “Drivers License” and “Traitor” and pushes them a little farther, making them a little bigger and a little stranger. “Vampire” is rewriting the alt rock playbook but it is introducing those rules to a new group of young fans. And it is undeniably catchy.\n\n“i/o” (Bright Side Mix) – Peter Gabriel From the album i/o\n\n2023 saw Peter Gabriel release his first album of new material in 21 years with i/o. Like most Gabriel projects there is more to the album than just a collection of new songs, and i/o is no different as each of the album’s twelve songs has two different mixes, a “bright side” mix and a “dark side” mix (although in most cases the different mixes are relatively similar). Anyone looking for the art-pop of Gabriel’s 80’s work like So won’t find a lot here to love, but to fans who like Gabriel’s deeper and more reflective work, especially Up and the more thoughtful moments of Us, there will be a lot to discover on i/o. Indeed, the title track is a quiet and subtle, yet warm song about life’s interconnectedness that will get under your skin with a few listens. It might not be worth the 21 year wait but it is a good song and a good album.\n\n“Los Angeles” – Lol Tolhurst, Budgie & Jacknife Lee (featuring James Murphy) From the album Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is the work of the unlikely post-punk supergroup consisting of former Cure drummer and keyboardist (and punching bag) Lol Tolhurst, Siouxsie & The Banshees’ drummer and percussionist Budgie, and producer and multi-instrumentalist Jacknife Lee. This trio of post-punk survivors and their producer came together to create musical soundscapes and then invited an array of guest vocalists and instrumentalists in for various songs. “Los Angeles”, the first song released from the trio, features LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy on vocals and is somewhat indicative of much of the record. While the album does have dark and brooding moments, much of Los Angeles sounds like a modern echo of the psychedelic and strange post-punk of The Cure’s post-Pornography singles, the Banshees’ A Kiss In The Dreamhouse, or more psychedelic and experimental Cure and Banshees’ side projects like The Glove or The Creatures. Indeed, the song “Los Angeles” feels like a modern descendant of Oingo Boingo, Nick Cave, and The Cure’s run of quirky pop singles from the early 80’s like “Let’s Go To Bed” and “The Love Cats”. It is a weird but welcome melange of early 80’s influences reimagined for a new era.\n\n“Shame” – Lauren Mayberry From the non-album single “Shame”\n\nLauren Mayberry, singer and frontwoman for Chvrches, decided to try her hand at some solo work and released the singles “Are You Awake?” and “Shame” in 2023. The second of these, “Shame”, is the more interesting of the two. “Shame” draws on peers like St. Vincent, Hayley Williams, and Lorde, and inspirations like the Eurythmics to create a twisted slice of synthpop that is funky, danceable, and just a little dark. “Shame” is the kind of song that likely would have been a radio hit in the 80’s or early 00’s but today is largely lost outside of Mayberry and Chvrches fanbase. And, pun intended, that is a shame.\n\n“Blame Brett” – The Beaches From the album Blame My Ex\n\nThe Beaches are an all-female Canadian rock band that draws on a variety of alt influences from the 80’s, 90’s and 00’s to create a sound that is somewhat akin to Wet Leg. However, these Canadians are not copycats as they began making music together in 2013 and have released a series of EP’s and an album in the years since; even being awarded Canada’s Juno Awards for Breakthrough Group of the Year in 2018 and Rock Album of the Year in 2022. 2023 saw The Beaches release Blame My Ex which featured the single “Blame Brett”. On “Blame Brett” vocalist and bassist Jordan Miller says to blame all of her bad behaviors and insecurities on her ex-boyfriend, not her. It’s a clever twist of a song that comes across as both tough and vulnerable; she’s broken, but it’s not her fault. The Beaches are another in the long line of young female bands and artists that seem to be reviving rock music over the past few years.\n\n“Edging” – Blink 182 From the album One More Time\n\nEarly 2000’s styled pop-punk has been in a full revival over the past few years. A string of new bands have helped to revive the style (not to mention several pop stars have at least played around with the style), while several bands from the early 2000’s, such as Paramore and Avril Lavigne, have made a comeback. Another band from that era that had new music in 2023 is Blink 182, who reunited the classic line-up of Mark Hoppus, Tom DeLonge, and Travis Barker, to release One More Time. A few moments on One More Time find the boys in Blink 182 showing some signs of maturity, but the lead single “Edging” consciously plays up the bratty, immature, ear candy style that made the band famous in the first play.\n\n“Atomic City” – U2 From the non-album single “Atomic City”\n\nMore than forty years after their debut album Boy announced their arrival U2 are still playing a significant role in the world of rock (and old enough to be showing up on the same list as Bono’s son’s band). While one could debate whether or not the non-album single “Atomic City” is worthy of a spot here – although the song is a catchy stab at fizzy pop-punk with a clever, knowing nod to Blondie’s classic “Call Me” – U2 has once again shown themselves to be a band that matters. 2023 saw the opening of Las Vegas’ new, immersive concert venue The Sphere and U2 was tapped to open it with a residency celebrating the anniversary of their career-altering album Achtung Baby. “Atomic City” was a new song recorded and released to help promote the residency. In theory, “Atomic City” is a song written to be in the style of their 90’s work found on Achtung Baby and Zooropa, but truthfully it sounds more like something that would have been on their early 00’s album How To Build An Atomic Bomb (a cousin to “Vertigo”, perhaps). Either way though “Atomic City” is a fun and energetic song from a band that sometimes takes itself too seriously and forgets that rock should be fun and energetic.\n\n“The Narcissist” – Blur From the album The Ballad Of Darren\n\n“The Narcissist” is the lead single from Blur’s 2023 acclaimed album The Ballad Of Darren. In recent years Blur leader Damon Albarn has been better known for his work with his post-modern music side project Gorillaz than for his work with Blur. Blur had scored a well-received comeback with 2015’s The Magic Whip but the release of The Ballad Of Darren shows that Blur is back as a working band. “The Narcissist” finds Blur exploring the melancholy, British Invasion influenced side of their sound and doing it as well as they ever did. Indeed, “The Narcissist” is among the best things Blur has done in quite a while.\n\n“Swimming Pools (Drank)” – Trevor Horn (featuring Tori Amos) From the album Echoes – Ancient & Modern\n\nAlternative music has become very post-modern by 2023. Influences can come from anywhere and unusual combinations of styles, genres, and even collaborators are often the rule, not the exception. That said, the new covers album from noted producer Trevor Horn, a one-time member of new wave band The Buggles and prog rock outfit (gone pop) Yes, is a strangely effective mix of styles and artists. The best of the bunch is probably Horn’s reimagining of Kendrick Lamar’s “Swimming Pools (Drank)” which features Tori Amos on vocals. Horn’s production and orchestration lends the song a dark, haunted majesty and Amos’ vocals work perfectly for the song. It is an unexpectedly effective cover version of the song.\n\n“A&W” – Lana Del Rey From the album Did You Know That There’s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd?\n\nLana Del Rey continues her recasting of the corruption and decay of our modern, urban culture as Camelot-era America (or is it the other way around?) and she continues to find new and interesting ways to do it. By blending modern hip-hop influences and production with the witty, literate, and maudlin observations of Smiths’ era Morrissey, and the candy-coated pop of 60’s girl groups, Lana Del Rey makes lonely, oversexed modern music that feels like a corrupted version of a more innocent time. “A&W” – both a reference to the Root Beer soda chain and burger joint that evokes 50’s nostalgia with its car side service and initials for “American Whore” – is a song suite that transitions from an icy, orchestrated ballad to a pulsing electronic bridge that finally segues into a hip hop section that finds Del Rey directly drawing on the late 50’s R&B song “Shimmy, Shimmy, Ko-Ko-Bop”. “A&W” is a perfect balance of the innocent and the corrupt, of the old and the new, of naivete and sexuality, of pop, indie, and hip hop. Another classic from LDR.\n\nAlternative Music Playlists – Vol. 47: 2022\n\nListen To The List: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0lZUI53h2qZQaYRNOpVgwj?si=f8475810a9f843f4\n\nIt has become increasingly challenging to curate a list of songs that fairly represents a year in alternative music in recent years because of how we listen to music today. There are few places anymore like terrestrial radio or MTV that really act as gatekeepers or build consensus about what music is popular. That is not bad, of course, but it does mean there are fewer and fewer real “hits” outside of the pop world as people simply find what appeals to them, seek out new music from old favorites, and then curate their own playlists. This means we all get to be more in control of our own listening (which is great) but it also means there are far fewer cultural touchstones than in the past. This is only reinforced by the fact that people do not need to purchase music anymore to enjoy it. Again, this is great, but it also means that commercial success is not a very accurate indicator of how impactful and/or popular a song is. So with all of these caveats, and living in a post-modern musical world that is now almost a full 50 years beyond the punk rock explosion that really created “alternative” music (and 30 years beyond “alternative” music becoming mainstream in the 1990’s) here is my list of songs that represent 2022. There are old favorites and rising stars to be found here. There is music inspired by David Bowie’s 70’s glam, the Electronic Body Music of the 80’s, new wave, grunge, punk, indie, post-punk, hip hop, fractured pop, and all points in between. Enjoy 2022:\n\n1. “She Still Leads Me On” – Suede\n\nFrom the album Autofiction\n\nSuede had risen as one of the most interesting of the Britpop bands of the 1990’s by combining the glam crunch of Bowie with the bedsit moping of The Smiths before they faded away into seeming oblivion in the early 2000’s. However, beginning with 2013’s Bloodsports Suede roared back to life and their amazing second act is still going strong four albums in with 2022’s Autofiction. Lead single “She Still Leads Me On” is a soaring rocker that folds elements of early New Order into their own well-defined sound and creates a melancholy majesty that fits Brett Anderson’s lyrics which are a warmly wistful tribute to his deceased mother.\n\n2. “Weird Goodbyes” – The National (featuring Bon Iver)\n\nFrom the single “Weird Goodbyes”\n\n“Weird Goodbyes” is a richly warm and achingly beautiful ode to a lost lover who has chosen to move on. The sepia-toned ballad continues the recent trend of The National to both use electronic textures in their music and to work with collaborators. On “Weird Goodbyes” both of these choices elevate the song and make it stronger. The carefully used electronics add both an appropriate sense of atmosphere and a feeling of movement that keeps the song from bogging down, while Bon Iver’s vocals serve as a near-perfect counterpoint to those of The National’s Matt Berninger. The National continue to work within their own self-chosen sound but with “Weird Goodbyes” they show that there are still interesting nooks and crannies to explore within that sound.\n\n3. “Tonight” – Phoenix (featuring Ezra Koenig)\n\nFrom the album Alpha Zulu\n\nFrench indie-pop band Phoenix rose to fame in the early 2000’s alongside similar new wave and synthpop influenced groups like The Killers and The Bravery and their 2022 album Alpha Zulu is among their best as it emphasizes the band’s ear for a hook and melody over the moody explorations of the atmosphere that sometimes gave their albums less focus. Those pop-inclinations were often brought out to the fore by their friend and sometime producer Philippe Zdar (who produced three Phoenix albums including their most successful Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix) and Alpha Zulu often feels like a tribute to their fallen friend in its sound and production (Zdar died after falling from a window in 2019). “Tonight” is a propulsive pop song that features Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend on vocals and the song is tight blend of the new wave and synthpop revival sound of Phoenix with the more rhythmic and world music driven style of Vampire Weekend. That combination of sounds works well and “Tonight” is a catchy piece of indie synthpop that could have been a mainstream hit in another time.\n\n4. “Karma Climb” – Editors\n\nFrom the album EBM\n\nEditors started life as part of the post-punk revival of the early 2000’s and were often compared (understandably) to both Joy Division and Interpol. However, over the next two decades Editors have been quite willing to explore various styles and sounds and 2022’s EBM continues that musical exploration. The title of the record – EBM – is a clue to what the record offers in two ways. First, EBM or “Electronic Body Music”, was an alternative music genre of the 80’s and early 90’s that combined industrial music, techno, synthpop, and other genres into something that was both aggressive and danceable and bands like Nitzer Ebb and Front 242 found success within this genre. Second, EBM is an acronym for Editors and Blanck Mass. These two facts shape the album as electronic musician and producer Blanck Mass, who the band had worked with to create new mixes of the songs on their previous album Violence, is brought in as a full-status band member for EBM and he helps Editors create music that is at least reminiscent (if not quite a recreation of) the sound and idea of EBM. Songs like “Karma Climb” find the Editors wiry and wintry sounding post-punk fused to fast, hard club beats and other electronic textures. Editors had worked with synths before (their third album In This Light And On This Evening echoes the sound of Depeche Mode’s Black Celebration on several songs for example) but Editors have never sounded like they do on “Karma Climb” or across EBM. Here, Editors and Blanck Mass find a sound that follows a similar path as early New Order, as that band transitioned from the bleak post-punk of Joy Division to the club-friendly textures of New Order. Editors never really sound like New Order on EBM but the fusion of jagged post-punk with hard beats and club textures is a similar blueprint. It will be interesting to see where Editors go from here and whether their marriage to Blanck Mass is a permanent one or just an interesting detour.\n\n5. “Boy” – The Killers\n\nFrom the single “Boy”\n\nFinding themselves unable to tour due to the Covid-19 pandemic and with the band now more firmly within the control of leader Brandon Flowers than ever (both guitarist Dave Keuning and bassist Mark Stoermer took extended leaves from the band to work on other projects) Flowers and drummer Ronnie Vannucci went to work and ultimately released two albums during the pandemic – 2020’s Imploding The Mirage and 2021’s Pressure Machine – the latter of which being an intimate and personal album that was focused on Flowers’ youth in rural, small town, culturally Mormon, Utah and the struggle between the rich spiritual faith and the worldly problems of the people living there. This backstory for Pressure Machine is relevant because “Boy” feels like an extension of the themes explored on that album. Indeed, I would not be surprised at all if “Boy” was written during those same sessions and just left off of the Pressure Machine album for not fitting in musically. “Boy” may feel like an extension of Pressure Machine’s lyrical themes, but musically it is a beat-driven synthpop banger that borrows quite liberally from Erasure’s “A Little Respect” before finishing with its almost anthemic conclusion that features a great guitar part by the returned Dave Keuning. “Boy” sounds like a fusion of the sounds of both Imploding The Mirage and Pressure Machine and is another great single from one of the most successful bands of the 21st century.\n\n6. “Don’t Let The Lights Go Out” – Panic! At The Disco\n\nFrom the album Viva Las Vengeance\n\nPanic! At The Disco is not the emo band it was when they burst onto the scene in the early 00’s. For one thing, Panic! At The Disco is not really a band at all anymore in any meaningful way but the project of sole remaining member Brandon Urie. In fairness though, Urie always was the driving force of the band and Panic! At The Disco has been a solo vehicle in all but name for several albums now. Second, while Panic! At The Disco still draws on its emo roots Urie has moved his band in various stylistic directions in recent years, which has been the key to the continued relevance and success the band has found. 2022’s Viva Las Vengeance (an incredible title for a Vegas-based band) is built on that diverse premise and the album, while still having echoes of emo’s glory days in places, plays more like a love letter to rock and roll of all eras. Many of the songs on Viva Las Vengeance are standouts and the album is easily one of the most consistent of Panic! At The Disco’s career. One of the highlights in the aching “Don’t Let The Lights Go Out”, a soaring ballad that has echoes of The Cars, 80’s hair band ballads, 70’s glam, Vegas cousins The Killers, and some other familiar melody that tickles my memory but that I can’t quite place. Panic! At The Disco has been culling the past for inspiration since at least their Beatles obsessed second album Pretty. Odd but here Brandon Urie does it as well as ever and is also able to shape it into something that is his own.\n\n7. “Here To Forever” – Death Cab For Cutie\n\nFrom the album Asphalt Meadows\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie has been a near constant presence in alternative and indie rock circles in the 21st century. Ben Gibbard and company consistently release albums of moody, mid-tempo, literate, indie rock that draws on 80’s college rock influences as its foundation and then extends out from there. 2022’s Asphalt Meadows continues this trend and is another rewarding album that reveals its charms with repeated listens. Second single “Here To Forever”, which opens with the classic line “In every movie I watch from the 50s/There is only one thought that swirls around my head now/That’s the everyone there on the screen/Yeah, everyone there on the screen they’re all dead now”, feels like classic Death Cab For Cutie. It also perfectly encapsulates the middle age concerns and impending mortality of Gibbard, his bandmates, and much of their fanbase. Asphalt Meadows captures Death Cab For Cutie exploring their classic sound while also finding interesting new directions within it.\n\n8. “The Tipping Point” – Tears For Fears\n\nFrom the album The Tipping Point\n\n80’s icons Tears For Fears had not put out a new album in 18 years, since 2004’s Everybody Loves A Happy Ending reunited Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith after fifteen years apart. Tears For Fears had not been completely silent during that nearly two decade break. The duo had released a few covers of songs by younger bands that were inspired by them in 2013 and had included two new songs on a 2017 hits compilation. The new single “I Love You But I’m Lost” was co-written by members of Bastille and seemed to continue the band’s interest in trying to update their sound. The initial sessions for The Tipping Point also saw the band working with an array of younger artists and producers and an early version of the album was completed but then largely scrapped by the band. Around this same time Roland Orzabal’s wife passed away and the band’s plan to re-enter the studio and work on The Tipping Point again was put on hold first while Orzabal grieved and then because of his own health issues. A silver lining to this tragedy however is that the death of his wife inspired Orzabal to write a new batch of songs and these new songs, including the title track, served as the core of a new version of The Tipping Point. The song “The Tipping Point” was released in late 2021 as the new album’s lead single (but I didn’t include it last year and the album was released in 2022 so here it is) and did quite well, cracking the Top 40 in both the US and the UK. “The Tipping Point” also showed that Tears For Fears new music echoed their classic era while also showing a growth and maturity fitting of their age and is much stronger than the few songs they released while trying to work with younger collaborators. Indeed, The Tipping Point is probably their best album since 1989’s The Seeds Of Love.\n\n9. “Something Changed” – Interpol\n\nFrom the album The Other Side of Make-Believe\n\nSomewhere after their third album Our Love To Admire Interpol began to drift a little. The band could still put out interesting songs but they seemed unsure about how to move forward within the limitations of their sound. 2018’s Marauder found the band recapturing the spark of their early work and that renewed focus is continued on 2022’s very strong The Other Side Of Make-Believe. First single “Toni” felt like a lost classic from the band’s early days (and I strongly included including it here) but the second single “Something Changed” has a dark beauty that shines though with the best of their work while also feeling more original. “Something Changed” is built off a lurching beat and is carried by a piano part that sounds like its being played by a ghost on a piano in an old western saloon. There is a sense of the world moving on and madness setting in on “Something Changed” that is eerie, yet beautiful and the song serves as the heart of the record.\n\n10. “Shotgun” – Soccer Mommy\n\nFrom the album Sometimes, Forever\n\nOn “Shotgun”, the lead single from Soccer Mommy’s third album Sometimes, Forever we find Sophie Allison (who is Soccer Mommy) continuing her confessional, intimate songwriting style. Only this time Soccer Mommy’s musical backing is expanded beyond her typical folk meets grunge style to include other 90’s-hued influences like shoegaze, dreampop, and industrial textures. Indeed, elements of all of these sounds can be heard woven into the formula on “Shotgun” which opens the album on very strong terms.\n\n11. “Anti-glory” – Horsegirl\n\nFrom the album Versions Of Modern Performance\n\nHorsegirl is a three-piece, all female rock band from Chicago, Illinois who made inroads with their debut album Versions Of Modern Performance. Like several other female-dominated bands of recent years Horsegirl finds their main inspiration in the grimy worlds of punk and grunge rock. “Anti-glory” feels like a song title ripped straight from the 90’s when a desire for stardom was anathema and anything that had a whiff of commercialism would rob a band of their credibility and authenticity. “Anti-glory” feels like it could be the love child of a threesome between Nirvana, The Pixies, and The Breeders (while Courtney Barnett watched from a distance) and is built on driving bass part and a fuzzy guitar lick adapted from Nirvana’s “Aneurysm”. “Anti-glory” is the best song on a solid debut and has put Horsegirl on the radar of bands to watch.\n\n12. “Growing Up” – The Lindas Lindas\n\nFrom the album Growing Up\n\nL.A.’s all female pop punks The Linda Lindas made waves over the past few years for a few reasons. First, they were so young that they couldn’t help but seem like a bit of a novelty. Second, bands made up of all Asian and Latin women are rare. Third, songs like “Oh!” and “Racist, Sexist Boy” were actually quite good and deserving of much of the attention they received. Both those tracks are included on The Linda Lindas debut album Growing Up, but it’s the title track shows the band’s songwriting is growing up with the band. “Growing Up” is a fiery punk-pop song about relying on your friends (or bandmates or lover) to deal with all of the new challenges life throws at you. “Growing Up” certainly makes The Linda Lindas feel like the inheritors of the mantle of bands like The Go-Go’s and Blondie.\n\n13. “Angelica” – Wet Leg\n\nFrom the album Wet Leg\n\nUndeniably, one of the breakout alternative acts of 2022 has been the British indie duo Wet Leg. Their first two singles “Chaise Longue” and “Wet Dream” were inescapable in indie circles and led to Wet Leg recording their eponymous debut album, which was released in April 2022. While Wet Leg had released several stand-alone singles (all four of which were eventually included on the Wet Leg album) the song “Angelica” was released in late February 2022 as the lead promotional single for the album. “Angelica” was a good choice for this as it is an excellent fusion of all of the elements that make Wet Leg interesting and unique. “Angelica” has sunny melodies and skewed harmony vocals combined with fuzzy garage rock, all fused with a blunt sexuality, humor, and quirkiness that recalls The B-52’s without sounding like them. Other songs that ended up on Wet Leg got more attention but I think “Angelica” may be the best of the bunch.\n\n14. “Rebels Without Applause” – Morrissey\n\nFrom the single “Rebels Without Applause”\n\nMorrissey has largely become a social pariah by 2022 but it is hard to deny that he can still release a catchy alt-pop single and the very Smiths-sounding “Rebels Without Applause” is another in a long line of them. The song is a blatant throwback to Moz’s early days as the singer of The Smiths. The guitar riff in “Rebels Without Applause” sounds like a lost Johnny Marr classic and the whole song is produced to sound like an outtake from The Queen Is Dead. Morrissey’s recalling of his salad days with The Smiths however is not a blatant attempt to appeal to fans of that era (at least not only that) as the song itself is a tribute to the bands of the first wave alternative era that paved the way for the success of later alternative bands who reaped the benefits. Indeed, the song namechecks both Generation X and X-Ray Spex in the lyrics, both underrated and largely forgotten bands who helped to shape the sound and style of 80’s alternative (along with other groups like The Smiths, of course) who might qualify as the rebels without applause of the song’s title. “Rebels Without Applause” was meant to be the lead single for Morrissey’s new album of the same name but the release of that album is now up in the air due to an issue with his label over Miley Cyrus’ desire to have her vocals pulled from a track on the new record. So, we will see of “Rebels Without Applause” is ultimately a stand-alone single or the first track off a new album.\n\n15. “Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)” – Arcade Fire\n\nFrom the album We\n\nArcade Fire had spent their previous few albums pushing the boundaries of their classic sound by adding it elements of world music and synthpop on recent albums. Those new elements can still be found around the edges of the music on 2022’s We but for the most part We is Arcade Fire’s attempt to return to the sound of their early records. We is only partially successful in that endeavor, the songs are written and structured to be more like those found on Funeral, Neon Bible, and The Suburbs but there is a maturity and slickness here that was generally not found on those early albums. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as it means We feels like a careful move forward for Arcade Fire rather than an attempt to capture an earlier era. However, it also means that parts of the We doesn’t have the spark of the new that can be found on those early albums. One of the exceptions to that though is “Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)” which starts as a simple folk song and builds up into a cinematic anthem that recalls the best moments, and more importantly captures the magic, of Arcade Fire’s early albums.\n\n16. “Sharks” – Imagine Dragons\n\nFrom the album Mercury – Acts 1 & 2\n\n2021 saw Imagine Dragons release the EP Mercury – Act 1 which found the band stripping away much of the production and sonic trickery of their earlier records to create something simpler and, at least comparatively, more intimate than their earlier albums. They released the second album of the Mercury project in 2022 and while it has the same minimalist Rick Rubin production it is a (somewhat) more defiant and buoyant affair than its predecessor as it represents the rise after a fall. One of the highlights of Mercury – Act 2 is the second single “Sharks”. “Sharks” is interesting because it follows the usual Imagine Dragons blueprint of new wave meets hip hop meets club music, only with most of the production bombast used on previous songs like “Radioactive” or “Believer” stripped away. What is left behind on “Sharks” is a supple, slinky track that flows and grooves like Imagine Dragons while also feeling minimalist and raw. (The two Mercury albums were also united into one album titled Mercury – Acts 1 & 2 in 2022).\n\n17. “Cracker Island” – Gorillaz (featuring Thundercat)\n\nFrom the single “Cracker Island”\n\nGorillaz comes back with another new wave/synthpop/Britpop/hip hop/club banger with their 2022 single “Cracker Island”. Damon Albarn’s collaborative art-based side project has grown and evolved over the years until it now feels like Blur was a side project he once did and Gorillaz is his real work (and maybe that is actually true). “Cracker Island” is a funky, groove-based that finds Damon Albarn working with Thundercat to create a song that will get stuck in your head while also making you shake your booty. It’s the kind of song Gorillaz does best when Albarn finds the right collaborators (and Thundercat is a great choice) and “Cracker Island” has that same mainstream appeal that “Clint Eastwood” or “Feel Good Inc.” had back when Gorillaz had radio hits, only this time without Albarn taking second fiddle to his rap collaborators.\n\n18. “Black Summer” – Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nFrom the album Unlimited Love\n\nThe Red Hot Chili Peppers saw guitarist John Frusciante return to the fold after a decade-long absence and the band celebrated his return by hooking up with longtime producer Rick Rubin and recording not one, but two new albums that were released in 2022 – Unlimited Love and Return Of The Dream Canteen. The first release from Unlimited Love, the first of the two albums, was “Black Summer”. Both the single “Black Summer” and the accompanying Unlimited Love went to #1 on the alternative singles and albums charts and continued to show that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were a creative and commercial force. “Black Summer” is a midtempo rocker than merges the classic Frusciante and Flea guitar and bass sound that had made the Chili Peppers popular. The unexpected twist on “Black Summer” is the unusual vocal performance by singer Anthony Kiedis where he sings the verses with a strange accent that sounds something like an Irish pirate might sound like. Some people found Kiedis’ vocal performance distracting or silly, and I can understand that viewpoint, but for me personally Kiedis’ vocal performance is what makes a relatively straightforward Chili Peppers song interesting and notable, and while strange, I personally like the song better because of it.\n\n19. “A Wave Across The Bay” – Frank Turner\n\nFrom the album FTHC\n\nAnyone who knows Frank Turner’s backstory knows that in spite of being mostly folk-based as a solo artist his background is in punk rock and he spent time as the leader of the punk band Million Dead. His 2022 FTHC (an abbreviation for “Frank Turner Hard Core”) is an attempt by Turner to bring more of those punk roots into his music to keep him from becoming too settled in his middle-aged success. The sound on FTHC isn’t too different from his previous solo work but there are full-band blasts that add some piss and vinegar to the album. That said, the album’s best moment may be the heartfelt “A Wave Across The Bay”, which is Turner’s tribute to his friend Scott Hutchinson, the singer for the band Frightened Rabbit, who committed suicide in 2018. “A Wave Across The Bay” is direct, honest and emotional as Turner tells of seeing his friend in a dream and then offers his love and support as he says goodbye to him. Over the course of the song, it builds from a minimalist folky opening to its cathartic, powerful conclusion; proving that the harder-edged approach used on FTHC has merit as “A Wave Across The Bay” would not have near the same power without its powerful ending.\n\n20. “There’s A Moon On” – Pixies\n\nFrom the album Doggerel\n\nThe Pixies return with the third release of their second act with 2022’s Doggerel. It is unlikely Pixies will ever reach the raw power and insanity of their initial run in the late 80’s and early 90’s (and they still miss original bassist Kim Deal) but Doggerel is probably the best album they have released since their reunion. Lead single “There’s A Moon On” however does capture a little bit of their early career energy and wouldn’t have sounded out of place on Bossanova or Trompe Le Monde. “There’s A Moon On” is a rewarding listen and when Black Francis shrieks “come on!” about halfway through a little of the old spirit shines through and its glorious.\n\n21. “Invincible” – Eddie Vedder\n\nFrom the album Earthling\n\nEddie Vedder of Pearl Jam had released solo material before. But his two previous solo albums were his minimalist soundtrack for Into The Wild and an album of songs played on a ukulele. So, in some ways it is possible to look at Earthling as Vedder’s first true solo album. However, doing so is a bit dishonest as that not only negates the excellent Into The Wild soundtrack, but it also ignores the amount of famous friends found on Earthling. Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith plays on much of the album, as does former Chili Pepper guitarist Josh Klinghoffer who also serves as Vedder’s primary songwriting partner. Elsewhere Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Ringo Starr, and Tom Petty & The Heartbreaker’s keyboardist Benmont Tench all make appearances. In spite of all of these famous and talented people working with Vedder Earthling never feels like the work of anyone other than Vedder himself; it doesn’t even feel like Pearl Jam very often. The album is generally hopeful, uplifting, and defiant as it explores the various sounds and styles that have influenced Vedder over the years. Opening song and fourth single “Earthling” captures most of what Vedder is trying to accomplish here, which is warm, Earthy music that draws largely on classic rock, presented by one of the great voices and battle-hardened survivors of the 90’s alternative rock revolution.\n\nAlternative Music Playlists – Vol. 46: 2021\n\nListen To The List: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6XJqnFg8ehgKvvnOUCf2De?si=095e6f18c8e1477c\n\n2021 was a year that saw the spiritual daughters of Kate Bush, Debbie Harry, Tori Amos, Alanis Morissette and the other women of the 90’s Lilith Fair scene rise and make the alternative world take notice. Twelve of the artists included on this year’s list are women or groups where women play a key and vital role in the group. Many of these female artists are still fairly new in their careers, but some are more veteran artists. However, all of them draw on older and varied influences and traditions – how can you not at this point in alt rock history? That said, as I’ve discussed with previous years’ lists, the lines between genres, and even between the alternative and the mainstream, are more blurred than ever; with little to no meaningful distinctions existing between alternative rock, pop, R&B, hip hop, dance, etc. Rock and pop music has become thoroughly post-modern, borrowing from where it wants and combining things in any way that makes sense, especially for younger artists who have grown up with digital music and streaming and where self-made playlists replace the album as constructed by the artist as the primary way to listen to music. As you listen to these songs from 2021 it is easy to hear echoes of the 1970’s, 1980’s, 1990’s, 2000’s, and 2010’s sometimes in the music of artists way too young to have heard those influences firsthand (and vice versa to hear more modern influences in some of the older artists whose commercial heydays are likely past but who are still making interesting music). So while this 2021 list is comprised mostly of younger and newer artists, a few veterans of the alternative rock scene do appear as well and some of these ignore current trends (as much as there are current trends). I’ve also expanded the list from the eighteen songs I have done in the past to a slightly longer 21 track list and may use this as an excuse to go back and lengthen the other yearly lists by three tracks as well at some point. Here is 2021:\n\n1. “Drivers License” – Olivia Rodrigo From the album Sour\n\nOlivia Rodrigo was one of the breakout stars of 2021 with a run of hits that were a perfect blend of pop hooks, emo drama, new wave punch, and Lana Del Rey styled tragedy. Olivia Rodrigo proved she could rock out with “Brutal”, which borrowed liberally from Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up” (and for which he gave his blessing), but it was her quiet/sad/angry girl anthem “Drivers License” that really let her make her mark. A heartbroken ballad of betrayal that draws on the nostalgia of Lana Del Rey, the anger of Alanis Morissette, and the sadness of Death Cab For Cutie, all wrapped into a slow burning and slow building indie pop song. “Drivers License” is a prime example of how the new draws on what came before and twists it in new ways in 2021.\n\n2. “Hush” – The Marías From the album Cinema\n\nThe Marías are built around a core duo of vocalist María Zardoya and drummer/producer Josh Conway. The two met at a Laurel Canyon Music Revival set where Zardoya was performing and Conway was in charge of the sound. The pair hit it off and became musical and romantic partners, building the rest of the band around them. 2021 saw their debut album Cinema released and with it the sultry, sexy, and pulsing single “Hush. “Hush” blends modern indie rock with a streak of 80’s synthpop for something that sounds both modern and retro. “Hush” is dark and slinky and full of hooks, a great single that hopefully predicts a long future for The Marías.\n\n3. “How Not To Drown” – Chvrches (featuring Robert Smith) From the album Screen Violence\n\nScotland’s Chvrches still feel like a fairly new band but 2021 Screen Violence is already their fourth album, making the trio veterans by this point. “How Not To Drown”, like most of Screen Violence, pulls back from the almost pure electropop of their previous record Love Is Dead and returns Chvrches more directly to their 80’s influences. Of course, this is most directly expressed and heard by the fact that “How Not To Drown” is a duet with The Cure’s Robert Smith (who is in good voice). However, the update of the 80’s influences is heard in more than just the fact that Robert Smith sings on the track. The song is built off a synth hook that could almost have been stolen from mid 1980’s Depeche Mode or New Order, while Smith’s distinctive guitar style can almost be heard on the track. All that said, “How Not To Drown” is not an exercise in pure 80’s nostalgia. All of these elements are filtered through the prism of Chvrches’ sound and fits into their own discography easily. Furthermore, “How Not To Drown” deals with the depression and isolation of living in a world lived in lockdown and through screens (hence the album title) due to the global coronavirus pandemic, a very current topic for the time.\n\n4. “The Last Man On Earth” – Wolf Alice From the album Blue Weekend\n\nOver the past few years Wolf Alice has been one of the fast-rising stars of the alt rock world as their first two albums blended (or at least juxtaposed) the fuzzy, distortion and anger of 90’s alt rock with the more effervescent and ethereal dreampop side of 90’s alt music. The Blue Weekend album finally melds these two sides in a way that is both more natural and more the band’s own vision. “The Last Man On Earth” was the lead single from Blue Weekend and it aims big as it builds from a hushed ballad to a massive-sounding, cinematic anthem that is defiantly optimistic. It is powerful and beautiful and in a different time in music history it would have dominated the airwaves. As it is, it is one of the best songs from one of the best bands of the past ten years.\n\n5. “Bed Head” – Manchester Orchestra From the album The Million Masks of God\n\nManchester Orchestra, who actually hail from Atlanta, Georgia, not the industrial English metropolis that is home to many of the greatest alternative rock bands of all time, have been making music since the early 2000’s, slowly increasing in both skill and notice. 2021’s The Million Masks of God blends post-hardcore rock with touches of emo, new wave revival, and the conceptual and thematic arc of prog rock, as the album deals with themes of life, death, and what comes next in response to the death of Robert McDowell’s father from cancer. First single “Bed Head”, which is a great example of the fusion of the band’s sound with the themes of the record, went on to become a successful single on alt rock radio this past year.\n\n6. “Meet Me At Our Spot” – The Anxiety From the album The Anxiety\n\nA duo, made up of Tyler Cole and Willow Smith (yes, Will Smith’s daughter that sang “Whip My Hair” a decade ago) that mixes indie, emo, pop and R&B influences that is both catchy and edgy. Admittedly, I am cheating on this song a little as “Meet Me At Our Spot” was originally released in 2020 without any fanfare or label support and to no success. However, “Meet Me At Our Spot” slowly found an audience over 2021 due to its use on social media platforms like TikTok and in summer playlists and so was rereleased in October of 2021 to radio play and commercial success. In a fusion of style and production that is somewhat reminiscent of the sound of Fun. a few years back, “Meet Me At Our Spot” is an earworm that became a hit almost purely due to people discovering it on their own until the music industry couldn’t ignore it anymore.\n\n7. “Shy Away” – Twenty One Pilots From the album Scaled & Icy\n\nFor their 2021 album Scaled & Icy Twenty One Pilots pulled back some from their flirtations with both gothic overtones and hip hop culture and created an album that is lighter, brighter, and more indebted to the shimmering synths and colorful look of the 1980’s. This brighter tone and mood can be heard on the pop-oriented and catchy “Shy Away”. “Shy Away” is one of several songs on Scaled & Icy (the title itself a derivative of the phrase “scaled back and isolated”) that tries to lighten the pressures of the pandemic era by attempting to lighten the mood and add some light to a dark and lonely time. “Shy Away” is a fun song and a warm new direction in the sound of Twenty One Pilots.\n\n8. “My Limb” – Hayley Williams From the album Flowers For Vases/Descansos\n\nParamore’s Hayley Williams released her second album in under a year when she surprise released her sophomore effort Flowers For Vases a mere ninth months after her excellent solo debut Petals For Armor dropped in 2020. Flowers For Vases feels like a quieter and even more introspective sister album to Petals For Armor, and perhaps that is appropriate since Williams wrote, sang, and played every note on the album. “My Limb” is one of the standout moments on the album, at turns elegant and edgy as Williams struggles with whether to work to save her relationship or not. “My Limb” is a quiet song, but it is the quiet discomfort of internal conflict, of someone at war with themselves, not of tranquility, acceptance, or even resignation. “My Limb” may not roar and rage, but it is a song that is unsettled and unsure, and that gives it an emotional resonance that most of us can relate to. “My Limb”, along with both of Williams’ solo albums generally, makes a strong case for her being a more interesting and inventive artist alone than she ever was in Paramore.\n\n9. “The Walls Are Way Too Thin” – Holly Humberstone From the EP The Walls Are Way Too Thin\n\nBritish, indie pop singer Holly Humberstone was introduced to the world in 2020 with several successful singles (including a cover of Radiohead’s “Fake Plastic Trees”) and the Asleep At The Wheel EP. 2021 saw her follow-up this strong start with another well crafted EP The Walls Are Way Too Thin. The EP also spun of the successful title track “The Walls Are Way Too Thin”, which draws on recent influences like Lorde and Billie Eilish, while also reaching further back to draw from bands like Radiohead and The Police. “The Walls Are Way Too Thin” is a story of jealousy and heartbreak that is set to a quiet pulse that is reminiscent, but not outright theft, of “Every Breath You Take” and it lends the song a sense of familiarity and timelessness that works in this new context.\n\n10. “Arcadia” – Lana Del Rey From the album Blue Banisters\n\n2021 was a busy year for Lana Del Rey as she released not one, but two new albums with Chemtrails Over The Country Club and Blue Banisters. Both albums dial back on the rap/gang culture trappings and other modern references that pepper her earlier work and update the innocent sound of a bygone era for the 21st century. “Arcadia” is a hushed piano ballad that equates her own body to the geography of California as she tells her own story of coming to L.A. to find success and happiness, only to ultimately find one of the two. The song is lush, pained and seductive all at once, with perfectly placed strings and subtle trumpet in the background that raise “Arcadia” from being just another good Lana Del Rey song to a career highlight.\n\n11. “Pay Your Way In Pain” – St. Vincent From the album Daddy’s Home\n\nSt. Vincent continues to channel the ghosts of both Prince and David Bowie (with maybe a little Tori Amos thrown in there as well) on her lead single from Daddy’s Home, “Pay Your Way In Pain”. This is not a bad thing though as the song is damn good. Working once again with producer Jack Antonoff, St. Vincent draws on the musical melee of late 70’s New York City to tell a story based on her own father’s release from prison on “Pay Your Way In Pain”. The song is quirky, slinky, groovy, and a little crazy – perfectly St. Vincent.\n\n12. “Beautiful Beaches” – James From the album All The Colours Of You\n\nBritish indie rock legends James released their 16th album All The Colours Of You in 2021, continuing their excellent late career revival. Recorded under unusual circumstances – the band’s four primary songwriters were each stuck in different countries during the pandemic lockdown so much of the album was recorded remotely rather than together as they usually work – the album sounds somewhat different than some of their previous work. Then again, James have repeatedly changed their sound and style over their career so maybe that is just a coincidence. Either way All The Colours Of You has both high and low points, but one of its best is the second single “Beautiful Beaches”. “Beautiful Beaches” is the true story of singer Tim Booth and his family’s forced evacuation from their home just ahead of the California wildfires in 2019. In spite of its origins “Beautiful Beaches” is a catchy indie pop song that builds to an anthemic chorus that is both uplifting and hopeful. It is another classic should-have-been hit from James.\n\n13. “Solar Power” – Lorde From the album Solar Power\n\nLorde, who has built a career as something of an edgy and icy indie princess, lets her hair down and gets warm and loose for her surprise summer release “Solar Power”. Opening with little more than Lorde’s voice singing in something just above a conspiratorial whisper and an acoustic guitar strumming simply, “Solar Power” is immediately recognizable as Lorde and also sounds like nothing else she has done. Eventually, the song builds into a breezy folk-based ode to the beach before finally opening up into a full-blown pop song with Phoebe Bridgers singing back-up vocals and a horn section providing warm accents. “Solar Power” was successful but it still seems like it should have been an even bigger summer hit. Still, it’s another great song from Lorde.\n\n14. “Intruder” – Gary Numan From the album Intruder\n\nThe last time Gary Numan turned up on one of these yearly lists was when I compiled the list for 1979! That list included his British hit “Are ‘Friends’ Electric?” and makes mention of his sole American hit “Cars”. Now, 42 years later, Numan is on the list again. In truth, Gary Numan, who was one of the true pioneers of electronic/synth music, had never gone out of favor. And while he is remembered primarily as a one-hit wonder in the USA, Numan had a run of hits in the UK in the early to mid 80’s before largely fading away into obscurity. However, he kept making music and evolving his sound, and by the mid 1990’s Numan was being namechecked as an influence by artists like Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and the members of Depeche Mode. Indeed, Numan’s own music slowly moved more in an industrial and electro-rock direction and by the time the 2000’s rolled around Numan was ready to embark on a late career revival that saw him make a run of strong albums and become critically respected in a way he never had been before. This all culminated with this excellent 2021 release Intruder and its superb title track, which is an excellent song that both shows how groups like Nine Inch Nails and Depeche Mode were inspired by him and how he has now, in turn, been inspired by them. Indeed, Numan’s “Intruder” falls somewhere in between the sound of those two legendary bands and proves he is an incredible artist in his own right.\n\n15. “Extreme Greed” – Ist Ist From the album The Art Of Lying\n\nDrawing on obvious references like Joy Division, Interpol, and Editors, England’s Ist Ist carries the torch of gloomy, brooding, post-punk to a new generation. “Extreme Greed” features a wall of guitars and icy synths supporting the deep growl of singer Adam Houghton. While still in debt to their influences Ist Ist’s sophomore album The Art Of Lying finds the band starting to also take those influences in their own direction and is certainly a band worth paying attention to if you are a fan of post-punk or goth rock.\n\n16. “It Won’t Always Be Like This” – Inhaler From the album It Won’t Always Be Like This\n\nInhaler had released a few singles and EP’s over the past few years, but 2021 saw Inhaler finally release their debut album It Won’t Always Be Like This. The opening song is the title track “It Won’t Always Be Like This”, and while there is no escaping the fact that lead singer Elijah Hewson sounds almost like a dead ringer for his father Bono, Inhaler uses the album to expand their sound enough that they don’t quite sound like U2 circa Boy version 2.0. Sure, they still have plenty of U2 in their DNA, but there are also modern production flourishes and perhaps a little more pop-orientation inherent in Inhaler’s sound as well. This difference can be heard on “It Won’t Always Be Like This”, a song the band released as a non-album single in 2019 but was re-recorded here for the album. This new version was then released as a single in 2021. Maybe not quite as strong as their previously best-known song “My Honest Face” (which was also re-recorded for the album), but “It Won’t Always Be Like This” has the same anthemic mix of light 80’s post-punk and college rock influences filtered through the slick pop-sense of recent indie rock; making “It Won’t Always Be Like This” feel like a descendent of Coldplay, The Killers, Travis, or Mumford & Sons (at least without their banjos) as much as U2. Of course, since all of the bands listed there are musical descendants of U2 themselves this may be splitting hairs a bit, still with “It Won’t Always Be Like This” Inhaler seem to be finding a place outside of being the legacy heirs to U2.\n\n17. “Quiet Town” – The Killers From the album Pressure Machine\n\nThe Killers’ new album Pressure Machine continues Brandon Flowers and company’s merging of Bruce Springsteen’s sense of Americana with U2’s cinematic sweep and New Order’s electronic pulse. However, that strange but effective fusion never has worked better than it does on Pressure Machine, an album about the light and dark of growing up and staying in the small, rural, Mormon-dominated towns of central Utah. Pressure Machine is the rare modern album that really is an album and is best listened to from start to finish as a single work. That said, the individual songs work well as snapshot looks into the bigger picture as well, and Flowers knows his subject matter well as he spent many of his formative years living in these towns (and I can verify this accuracy as these towns are where I live now). One of the best songs on Pressure Machine is “Quiet Town”. “Quiet Town” sounds like a 21st century update of one Springsteen’s melancholy story songs from Darkness On The Edge Of Town, The River, or Born To Run (or with its warm 80’s styled synths maybe an outtake from Born In The USA that was deemed to somber for that record). “Quiet Town”, like most of the album, balances a palpable sense of despair that is rooted in the lack of opportunity and diversity found in these places with the sense of faith, hope, and security that is found in their communities and their God. Pressure Machine is an album about the loss of a simpler, more innocent time and place, and the good and bad that comes from this kind of change, and “Quiet Town” is a good example of this overall theme.\n\n18. “Elevator Boots” – Counting Crows From the EP Butter Miracle, Suite One\n\nThe four songs that make up Counting Crows’ new EP constitute the first new music from the 90’s stalwarts in seven years. However, a listen to “Elevator Boots” (or any of the four songs on Butter Miracle) reveals that in the world of the Counting Crows not too much has changed – and that is a good thing. “Elevator Boots” has the same rambling feel influenced by sunny 60’s folk, 70’s heartland rock, and 80’s college rock, that the band has had since “Mr. Jones” made them stars in the early 90’s. Sure, the production here is a little slicker than it was on their early albums, but no more so than on Hard Candy or This Desert Life, and “Elevator Boots” would feel right at home on nearly any of their albums. Yet, “Elevator Boots” is not a retread, it sounds familiar but not redone, and for fans of Counting Crows specifically and the 90’s or early 00’s more generally, that is exactly what a new Counting Crows song should be: Warm, earthy rock and roll that is embedded with a sense of Americana; all while Adam Duritz’ emotive voice tells a story that makes us feel as if we are there in their heads and hearts.\n\n19. “Roots and Wings” – The Wallflowers From the album Exit Wounds\n\nI could almost just rewrite the above comments about Counting Crows here for The Wallflowers’ new song and album as well. Jakob Dylan and company return to their classic sound for “Roots and Wings”, the lead single from 2021’s new album Exit Wounds. “Roots and Wings” sounds like it could have been on The Wallflowers’ 1996 masterpiece album Bringing Down The Horse and is a return to form. While it doesn’t sound much else being played on the radio currently, “Roots and Wings” should appeal to anyone who liked The Wallflowers in the 90’s or that discovered Jakob Dylan through watching Echo In The Canyon, his acclaimed documentary on the mid 60’s California folk rock scene.\n\n20. “Monday” – The Regrettes From the single “Monday”\n\nL.A. pop punk band The Regrettes have previously released two albums that have largely flown under the radar (although their punk pop cover of “Helpless” from Hamilton is a fun listen) but 2021 saw the group earn some real notice and airplay with the hooky earworm “Monday”. More pop than punk “Monday” has the bratty but catchy feel of Blondie or early Avril Lavigne, which means that “Monday” is colorful and fun more than it is dangerous. No matter though because it is an infectious song that deserved the attention it got.\n\n21. “Good Girls (Don’t Get Used)” – Beach Bunny From the EP Blame Game\n\nBeach Bunny is a musical descendent of Avril Lavigne and Paramore and sonic sister of Olivia Rodrigo and Soccer Mommy. While technically a full band, Beach Bunny is primarily the musical outlet of Lili Trifilio, a Chicago indie pop artist who released a run of singles and EP’s as Beach Bunny before expanding Beach Bunny into a full band to record their debut album Honeymoon in 2020. Beach Bunny followed up the success of Honeymoon with the Blame Game EP in 2021; the highlight of which is the punk pop single “Good Girls (Don’t Get Used)”.\n\nAlternative Music Playlists – Vol. 45: 2020\n\nListen To The List: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0HfJPttTglJactjl7HkxNJ\n\n2020 was an unusual year due to the global Covid-19 pandemic and its fallout; both in our daily lives and in the world of music. There were some albums from the early part of the year that were written, recorded, and released without the shadow of Covid-19 hanging over them, but those were outliers in a year where the Coronavirus seemed to affect everything and everybody. Alternative music seemed to generally deal with the spectre of the virus in one of two ways. The music of 2020 either seemed to be somber and brooding, reflecting the state of many as they dealt with illness, isolation and economic stress or rooted in the sounds and styles of the hedonistic and carefree 1980’s (or occasionally 1970’s) as a throwback of sorts to a happier age. This led to newer bands drawing on 80’s influences while several 80’s artists returned with real vigor. So, 2020, is a mix of the light and the dark and the old and the new, and while it was a terrible year to live through it actually did make for some pretty good music.\n\n“I Hate How Much I Want You” – The Struts From the album Strange Days\n\nIf you are a fan of the over the top, oversized, riff-driven rock of 1970’s glam and/or 1980’s hair metal then The Struts are what you have been waiting for as few bands make bombastic rock and roll like this anymore. If you miss the eccentricities of Queen, the sleaze of Motley Crue, and the pop/rock gloss of Def Leppard, then you are in for a treat because the boys from The Struts are back and “I Hate How Much I Want You” is reminiscent of the sound and spirit of bygone times. Indeed, The Struts left their native UK with a plan to go to Los Angeles and revel in the seedy hometown of their Sunset Strip heroes while recording this album, and while Covid kept them from following in the debauched footsteps of their Hair Metal heroes behavior, they still drew upon them for inspiration. In fact, Def Leppard’s vocalist Joe Elliot and guitarist Phil Collen both show up for the fantastic and fun “I Hate How Much I Want You”, a Hair Metal homage that is just knowing enough to be in on the joke and feel ironic at the same time.\n\n“Bloodstream” – Soccer Mommy From the album Color Theory\n\nSoccer Mommy (the stage name for singer/songwriter Sophie Allison) expertly walks the line between confessional singer/songwriter and 90’s grunge rocker. This is territory she has mined before but what makes her 2020 album Color Theory more interesting is that she recorded in the studio with her live backing band for the first time. This gives the music a fuller sound than on previous releases and allows her to draw on her interest in 90’s rock more directly as can be heard on the album’s opening cut, the excellent “Bloodstream”.\n\n“Bad Decisions” – The Strokes From the album The New Abnormal\n\nThe Strokes came back in 2020 with The New Abnormal, one of the best albums of their career. The band continued the trend of their more recent work where they blend elements of the garage rock of their early years with 80’s new wave and post-punk influences. The change here though is that on The New Abnormal The Strokes rarely rock out. It is a much more mid-paced and moody record and “Bad Decisions” is a great example of this direction. While “Bad Decisions” never sounds like anyone other than The Strokes the band infuses a guitar riff lifted straight from Modern English to create a moody and tense hybrid of classic sounds from different eras.\n\n“Dance Of The Clairvoyants” – Pearl Jam From the album Gigaton\n\nPearl Jam has put out several very solid records in the 21st century. All of them are very listenable and feature some really good songs. That said, Pearl Jam fans generally knew what they were going to get with a new Pearl Jam record as well, as the band had fallen into a comfortable late career groove that maybe had even become a little staid at times. So it came as a surprise that delighted some fans and shocked others when “Dance Of The Clairvoyants” came out as the lead single ahead of their album Gigaton and the song featured synth-like keyboards and a tense and jerky new wave-inspired rhythm that made many think of Talking Heads. While little else on the album sounds much like “Dance Of The Clairvoyants”, it showed that Pearl Jam still had a desire to experiment and evolve, and while some old fans didn’t like it, I personally found it to be an exciting new direction and one of the best songs of their latter career.\n\n“Come On Out” – The Airborne Toxic Event From the album Hollywood Park\n\nMikel Jollett, the singer, primary songwriter, and driving force behind The Airborne Toxic Event, released a book based on his life titled Hollywood Park and the band’s 2020 album of the same name is meant to be an aural companion piece to it, drawing on the same textures, stories, and influences as the book. It is another solid record from The Airborne Toxic Event and one of the standout tracks is the dark but yearning “Come On Out”. Built up from a pulsing rhythm “Come On Out” finds the sweet spot between moody post-punk, colorful new wave, and anthemic epic.\n\n“Aries” – Gorillaz From the album Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez\n\nWhat started out as an art rock meets hip hop collective fronted by Blur’s Damon Albarn has evolved over the years into a melting pot of sounds, styles, genres, and collaborators, all loosely held together by Albarn (and his co-conspirator visual artist companion Jamie Hewett) as Gorillaz evolved into his main musical focus over the years. While not as strictly tied to its hip hop influenced origins as it once was the musical circus that is Gorillaz still mashes together anything that catches Albarn’s fancy and his ability to work with others successfully has become almost legendary. “Aries” is a collaboration between Gorillaz and former New Order bass god Peter Hook and “Aries” sounds like nothing less than a great lost New Order song. In a way this makes perfect sense as New Order, like Gorillaz a decade or so later, was interested in mixing alt rock with club culture and urban rhythms. The song is excellent and hearing Hook dig into the bassline with his singular sound is the best kind of ear candy.\n\n“Simmer” – Hayley Williams From the album Petals For Armor\n\nPunk-pop princess Hayley Williams of Paramore took a break from her band to make her first solo album with the superb Petals For Armor. Sometimes when band leaders make solo albums they seem to have little reason to exist as a solo record other than the artist doesn’t have to share the money with their bandmates but that is definitely not the case with Hayley Williams’ Petals For Armor. This is an not album that she could have made with Paramore and, quite frankly, it is better than most of that band’s work. Here, Williams draws on a list of female alt rock influences (most notably Tori Amos and Kate Bush) to create a vibrant and interesting record of indie pop of which the slow burning “Simmer” is probably the best song.\n\n“Cyr” – Smashing Pumpkins From the album Cyr\n\nThe title track to Smashing Pumpkins 2020 release is the type of icy, synth-driven rock that Corgan and company began exploring with “1979” and then delved into more fully on the Adore album. While the Pumpkins made their name with their bombastic and vaguely psychedelic alt rock, Corgan has never hidden the fact that he is a child of the 80’s and loves that eras new wave, post-punk and synthpop, and he has steered the band increasingly in that direction over the years. “Cyr” may well be Smashing Pumpkins best synth/electro-rock moment since “Eye” was included on the soundtrack for the film Lost Highway (or maybe even all the way back to “1979” itself). What Corgan and company manage to do on “Cyr” is create a song that is driven by its synthesizers while still feeling like a big, full, rock song and this makes the song feel special.\n\n“No-One” – Psychedelic Furs From the album Made of Rain\n\nThe Psychedelic Furs came out of a twenty-nine year recording hiatus and sound like they never went away. The songs on Made of Rain are very strong individually and the album is among the classic band’s best. There is no pandering to modern trends, no attempt to reinvent themselves, update their sound, or protect their legacy. All across Made of Rain the Furs create tense, angular, moody, heartbroken rock just like they did in their early 80’s heydey and it works, both because musical trends have brought their style back into vogue and because their atmospheric and angst-driven music is a great fit for the mood of 2020. The album is full of great songs but “No-One” is among the best and embodies everything that works about the album.\n\n“Anxiety” – Idles From the album Ultra Mono\n\nIdles mashes together elements of hardcore punk, angular post-punk, and the nervous energy of early new wave without ever quite sounding like any of those influences. “Anxiety” is tense and tough and continues a strong run of albums from the band while also capturing the feeling of many during the pandemic of 2020. Something about “Anxiety” is almost timeless; it feels like a song that could have come out in the 1970’s, the 1980’s, the 1990’s or anytime in the 21st Century.\n\n“Shameika” – Fiona Apple From the album Fetch The Bolt Cutters\n\nFiona Apple’s “Shameika” was the lead single from her heralded 2020 album Fetch The Bolt Cutters and the song, like the album, feels like it is right on the edge of losing control of a carefully contained rage. One can still hear the melodic indie and pop influences of Apple’s early career that scored her hits like “Criminal” and “Shadowboxer”, but “Shameika” and the other songs on Fetch The Bolt Cutters are more experimental and non-traditional. “Shameika” still has a melodic heart but it veers off into unexpected directions without warning to create a unique sound and vision from one of modern indie rock’s most unique artists.\n\n“Waving At The Window” – Travis From the album 10 Songs\n\nWhile Travis never found the success of some of their earnest and anthemic indie peers like Coldplay, Snow Patrol, and Oasis, especially in the USA, the band has been releasing beautiful, melodic, melancholy indie rock for almost three decades now. Nothing about their 2020 album 10 Songs is revelatory or a major change for the band. It is another album of excellent songs from a band who know who they are and what they do best and album opener “Waving At The Window” is a prime example of that and rivals their best work or that of their more famous peers.\n\n“Bobby, Don’t You Think They Know?” – Morrissey From the album I Am Not A Dog On A Chain\n\nWhile his politics have made Morrissey a pariah in the indie circles that once idolized him, that hasn’t stopped him from creating some of the most unusual and unexpected music of his career. And while his latter-day albums are not as consistently strong as either his work with The Smiths or his own early solo work he still can create stunning (and even shocking) music, which he does on “Bobby, Don’t You Think They Know?”. The song begins as a very good, put somewhat standard Morrissey song, but just when you feel like you know where the song is going Morrissey’s still tremendous voice is joined by the soulful voice of forgotten 1970’s disco queen Thelma Houston. It is a completely unexpected pairing that can feel jarring at first, but then quickly becomes strangely perfect. Then, just when the vocal pairings genius feels natural, Morrissey allows his bandmates to add synthesizers, a circus organ, and jazzy horns. All of this creates a song that would have been almost unimaginable for Morrissey to make during his early career yet feels like a natural, if very unexpected, evolution. Much of the rest of his 2020 album I Am Not A Dog On A Chain can’t match this level of unexpected creativity but Morrissey proves he still can push boundaries with his music.\n\n“Nerves Of Steel” – Erasure From the album The Neon\n\nErasure has continued to release catchy synthpop since the mid 1980’s and 2020’s The Neon continues that trend. “Nerves Of Steel” was the second single from The Neon, an album that was meant to recall the band’s early days (although since Erasure’s Vince Clarke almost always relies on classic analog synths everything they do feels tied to the 80’s). And while the album doesn’t necessarily feel all that different than their other recent albums in sound, it does seem more consistent. “Nerves Of Steel” could be from 1987’s The Circus or 1988’s The Innocents (that said it would feel right at home on 2005’s Nightbird too). However, what the song does do well is showcase Andy Bell’s still gorgeous voice and expansive range while also featuring Clarke’s classic synth hooks. True, that is what good Erasure has always done, but it is nice to see them still doing it so well halfway through their fourth decade.\n\n“Caution” – The Killers From the album Imploding The Mirage\n\nThe Killers continue to put out very good albums that blend the sound of 80’s new wave with the earnerst storytelling of Bruce Springsteen and the cinematic grandeur of U2 and 2020’s Imploding The Mirage is their best album in a while. “Caution” is classic sounding Killers that recalls their early 00’s heydey, falling somewhere in between the neon glitz of Hot Fuss and the dusty cinematic sprawl of Sam’s Town. “Caution” is catchy and affirming and has a great guitar solo from none other than Lindsay Buckingham.\n\n“First Nation” – Midnight Oil From the album The Makarrata Project\n\nAlways a political band Midnight Oil came out of a fifteen or so year retirement to address some of the political fallout of their homeland in 2020. Long champions for the rights of Australia’s aboriginal peoples (and other first nations around the globe) Midnight Oil released a new EP that addresses these and other concerns. The Oils sound, for the most part, like little has changed. Their music is muscular and tight, the work of a band that has been playing together since the late 1970’s, and Peter Garrett still sounds like a mad prophet. The only nod to current musical trends are that the song is performed with Tasmin Keith and Jessica Mauboy, both of whom add some modern flavor. However, even when Keith raps it fits the song and doesn’t feel forced, especially in the context of the whole EP which is intended to be a collaborative project. “First Nation” is a nice treat that wets the appetite for Midnight Oil again and hopefully they will not wait another fifteen years to release new music.\n\n“Life In Quarantine” – Ben Gibbard From the non-album single “Life In Quarantine”\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard spent much of the 2020 quarantine performing at-home shows in an attempt to raise money for those in need and awareness for responsible behaviors during the Covid quarantine. Connected to this effort was a simple, pretty solo song Gibbard released called “Life In Quarantine”. The title says it all and, while not a hit, it definitely could be the song that best fits the feel of the year.\n\n“Fare Thee Well” – Stone Temple Pilots From the album Perdida\n\nIn spite of the death of two former frontmen in Scott Weiland and Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington (who was vocalist for the band for a few years and did one studio EP with the band) 90’s rockers Stone Temple Pilots have persevered. Hiring new singer Jeff Gutt a few years back and moving on yet again. 2020 saw the release of the album Perdida, a largely acoustic and melancholy affair meant to help the band deal with the deaths of their friends and other trials. While written and recorded pre-pandemic, the mood and tone of the album is a perfect match for its time and “Fare Thee Well” feels like classic, if subdued, STP. Gutt’s voice is similar to Weiland’s and it is easy to fall into the song and feel like you are listening to a forgotten favorite from their 90’s peak.\n\nAlternative Music Playlists – Vol. 44: 2019\n\nListen To The List: Alternative Music Playlists – Vol. 44: 2019\n\n2019 was a strong year for the quality of indie and alternative rock. It also seems to be a year that saw the alternative music world pull back just a little from the worlds of straightforward pop and hip-hop music. Those genres can still be heard here, after all younger music fans (and bands) have grown up in a world where genres mean little and rap and pop has dominated the radio as much, or more, than rock. Still, the songs that make up the 2019 list feel more rooted in rock and roll than in the past couple of years, even if the production on much of it smooths off many of the rough edges and keeps it from feeling too raw. Few of these songs roared up the mainstream charts (with a few exceptions) but many of these songs did make their presence felt, which gives me hope that alternative rock has a solid future ahead.\n\n1. “Alligator” – Of Monsters & Men From the album Fever Dream\n\nWhen Iceland’s Of Monsters & Men burst onto the scene in 2012 with their hit “Little Talks” I really liked the song, which walked the line between classic indie rock and the Folk Revival that was big at that moment; I also was almost positive they were a band that would be a one hit wonder. In spite of having a dedicated fan base time seemed to prove me right. Then, in 2019 the band would release the excellent “Alligator”, a song that has echoes of their earlier sound mixed with the dance overtones and glossy production that is key to success now. “Alligator” feels like a sonic cousin to Arcade Fire’s recent Everything Now album and maybe even beats Arcade Fire at their own game, at least for this one song.\n\n2. “My Honest Face” – Inhaler From the single My Honest Face\n\nFor those who don’t know Ireland’s Inhaler in fronted by Elijah Hewson, the son of U2’s lead singer Bono, and his band sounds and feels like the inheritors of U2’s early post-punk infused sound. Hewson has a voice very reminiscent of his famous father and his bandmates spin out a tense and taut energy on “My Honest Face” that would fit right in on U2’s debut album Boy. It is very early in Inhaler’s career, and some of the other singles they have put out fall further outside the influence of early U2, but none of them are as good as “My Honest Face”, which really is a testament to Inhaler’s talent and potential regardless of who they are connected to. “My Honest Face” would have been a hit in 1981 and could have been in 2019 if the music scene wasn’t so focused on other styles of music.\n\n3. “Ready To Let Go” – Cage The Elephant From the album Social Cues\n\nCage The Elephant is a band that has never really dented the mainstream, but when people look back at the rock scene of the 21st century’s first two decades it is going to be impossible to ignore how important and present Cage The Elephant is. In many ways Cage The Elephant is the model for an indie rock band. They have a large and very supportive fan base that buys their music, supports their tours, and helps them get songs played on alternative rock radio, even if they never quite crossover. “Ready To Let Go” is another in a long line of catchy, rock-oriented songs that should have been more successful than it was. This song has a swagger and groove that gets you moving and a chorus that gets stuck in your head, without ever feeling shallow or silly.\n\n4. “Everyone Here Hates You” – Courtney Barnett From the single Everybody Here Hates You\n\nAustralian rocker Courtney Barnett was the “next big thing” when she released her 2015 debut album. However, her indebtedness to the fuzzy sound of the 90’s combined with a sophomore album that was only decent had people jumping off of her bandwagon. Barnett however returned to the satirical wit and droll social commentary that made her famous on this excellent non-album single. Musically, “Everybody Here Hates You” combines a fuzzy 90’s grunge vibe with a bluesy, rootsy vibe not that far removed from Jack White or other recent garage rockers.\n\n5. “The Finest Somersault” – Pablo Dylan From the EP The Finest Somersault\n\nA year ago Pablo Dylan had released a few singles, including “The Eye Of The Storm” which was on last year’s list, but his debut EP came out in 2019 and this song, “The Finest Somersault”, is the title track. A fast and jumpy folk rock song that is Pablo Dylan’s modern version of his famous grandfather’s “Subterranean Homesick Blues”, it’s full of junk culture references and biting social commentary that at times are hard to tell apart (or maybe one in the same). Pablo Dylan’s The Finest Somersault EP is proof that his early promise was not a fluke.\n\n6. “This Land” – Gary Clark Jr. From the album This Land\n\nBlues revivalist Gary Clark Jr. tackles the racism and red-state revivalism of the modern era head on with his confrontational “This Land”. Opening with the salvo, “Paranoid and pissed off/Now that I got the money/Fifty acres and a model A/Right in the middle of Trump country” Clark announces his attention to claim what is rightfully his and that is no less than America itself. Clark follows this up with the refrain “this land is mine” and calling himself “America’s son”. It is political/protest song set to a smooth hip hop groove and featuring Clark’s expert blues guitar chops, but is all fiery rock and righteous indignation.\n\n7. “Can’t Knock The Hustle” – Weezer From the album Weezer (The Black Album)\n\nWeezer, like most rock bands that were making music in the 00’s, flirted with pop and hip-hop influences. These albums were pretty solid overall but had the effect of angering many of Weezer’s very loyal fans (even though the band’s dalliances into hip hop were obviously done very tongue-in-cheek and well in line with their longstanding sense of humor). So, in order to make their fans happy Weezer had spent recent years returning to their roots, releasing the decidedly classicist Everything Will Be Alright In The End before finally recording and releasing the long begged for by fans cover of Toto’s “Africa” (after first trolling them with a cover of Toto’s “Rosanna”). It seemed Weezer had left their flirtations with pop and hip-hop behind, but leader Rivers Cuomo can’t help himself and on much of the Black Album he takes the band back to the world of hip-hop and pop as can be heard on “Can’t Knock The Hustle”. This may not be what longtime Weezer fans want but they need to loosen up and let the band evolve, because the truth is the hip-hop influenced rock of “Can’t Knock The Hustle” is a slinky, silly, and almost sexy song that is well worth a listen.\n\n8. “Doin’ Time” – Lana Del Rey From the album Norman F***ing Rockwell\n\nWell, it doesn’t get much more meta than this. Lana Del Rey, who has made a career out of singing beautiful, gloomy songs about the failure of the American Dream in the fallen paradise of California, covers Sublime’s “Doin’ Time”, which itself heavily samples “Summertime” from the American jazz opera Porgy and Bess. Sublime’s version uses the “Summertime” sample to create a humid sense of urban decay in their tale of a failed romance. Lana Del Rey’s version keeps the hip-hop underpinning but plays up the lazy heat and romantic angst perfectly, making the song hers even though it has two previous incarnations that are both already classics.\n\n9. “Bad Guy” – Billie Eilish From the album When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\n\nBillie Eilish continues her fusion of alt rock, dance, pop, emo, electronica and hip-hop on her full-length album When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? The album went on to be one of the most critically and commercially successful albums of 2019 and “Bad Guy” was probably its biggest hit. A perfect encapsulation of the sound of the album, a dark and sexy song with a great hook and interesting production.\n\n10. “Light Years” – The National From the album I Am Easy To Find\n\nPost-punk revivalists The National close their 2019 album I Am Easy To Find with the elegant piano ballad “Light Years”, which was also the second single from the album. A fairly simple song with a fragile beauty to it, “Light Years” is a masterpiece of atmosphere and melancholy that continues The National’s ability to find new ways to express themselves within the confines of their genre.\n\n11. “Gloria” – The Lumineers From the album III\n\nI never thought for a second that The Lumineers would have a career beyond their surprise 2012 hit “Ho Hey”, let alone become one of the leading lights of the alternative rock scene with a large and devout fan base. However, The Lumineers have put out three albums of expertly crafted, moody, indie folk and have proven themselves to be great talents far more skilled than the folk stomp of “Hey Ho” would have ever indicated. “Gloria” is a deceptively upbeat look at the pains of alcoholism and another great song from The Lumineers.\n\n12. “Sister Rosetta” – Frank Turner From the album No Man’s Land\n\nFrank Turner’s 2019 album No Man’s Land was a concept album where he wrote songs from the perspectives of women who have been overlooked or misunderstood by history. “Sister Rosetta” is his homage to rock and roll’s nearly forgotten female pioneer Sister Rosetta Tharp, who is considered by some to be the inventor of rock and roll music. While that accolade is up for debate there is no doubt that she was a major influence on many of the early stars of rock and roll and Turner’s “Sister Rosetta” tells her story in fine folk/pop fashion.\n\n13. “Harmony Hall” – Vampire Weekend From the album Father Of The Bride\n\n“Harmony Hall” is the full blossoming of Vampire Weekend from indie rock/world music fusion darlings into a fully formed rock band that takes all the threads of their influences and weaves it into something uniquely and fully their own. One can still hear Vampire Weekend’s heroes and influences on “Harmony Hall” but not so obviously and overtly as before. Bright piano runs through the song and the funky, almost classic country sounding breakdown on the bridge is warm and wonderful. In fact, “Harmony Hall” feels like a modern take on the folky/hippy/soft rock sound of the late 60’s and early 70’s.\n\n14. “Hard Times” – Guster From the album Look Alive\n\n“Hard Times” doesn’t sound much like the Guster of yesteryear. Gone is the poppy indie rock that was rooted in 80’s college radio. “Hard Times” features extensive synths and keyboards to create a moody atmosphere that sounds similar to latter-day Death Cab For Cutie. Under the new layer of synths and production one can still hear the indie pop roots on “Hard Times”; indeed, the song has a nice melody and hook that subtly works its way into your head. “Hard Times” may not be the Guster people expect, but the song is really good and a nice change of pace.\n\n15. “Don’t Go” – OMD From the single Don’t Go\n\nOMD’s “Don’t Go” doesn’t sound like much else released in 2019, in fact it sounds like something they themselves would have released in 1985 – and that is a good thing. OMD’s excellent late career revival continues with this heartbroken, retro synthpop non-album single. Masters of the tension between synthpop melancholy and dancefloor beats “Don’t Go” is another is a long line of OMD songs that perfect this balance. A duo that has been at the cutting edge, that proved both their indie cred and pop skills repeatedly, that faded away and came back as good as ever, OMD has nothing left to prove yet keeps putting out expertly crafted songs that bands 40 years younger should be envious of.\n\n16. “The Way I Feel” – Keane From the album Cause & Effect\n\nKeane returns from a lengthy absence with “The Way I Feel”, a song that balances the bands early anthemic tendencies with their later 80’s retro pop in a way that feels very natural. “The Way I Feel” should appeal to fans of both aspects of the band while also feeling modern in its production and songcraft. In other words, “The Way I Feel” is a great comeback single from a band that seemed close to superstardom once before fading away. That chance to be huge is likely gone but songs like this prove Keane can still make good music.\n\n17. “Thrash Metal Cassette” – Dinosaur Pile-Up From the album Celebrity Mansions\n\nDinosaur Pile-Up combines the pummeling heavy metal of the late 70’s, with the fuzzy punk influenced alternative rock of the 90’s, and just a touch of pop to create a strange hybrid of music that potentially could be loved by fans of Judas Priest, Nirvana, and Billie Eilish. Dinosaur Pile-Up obviously has a sense of humor but this is no novelty band and they are serious about those riffs. “Thrash Metal Cassette” is the opening track and lead single and a perfect example of what the world has been missing.\n\n18. “In The End” – The Cranberries From the album In The End\n\nThe Cranberries’ final album In The End was finished by the band after the death of singer Delores O’Riordan, using the nearly completed vocal demos she had already done. For an album created in this manner In The End holds together very well. This title track was the closing track on the album and a beautiful final goodbye from Delores and the band. “In The End” showcases O’Riordan’s gorgeous and unique voice while still allowing the band to play their modern take on The Smiths moody jangle pop, and it all comes together beautifully one last time.\n\nAlternative Music Playlists – Vol. 43: 2018\n\nListen To The List: Alternative Music Playlists – Vol. 43: 2018\n\n2018 saw the continuation of the general trends of the past few years where hard genres have largely broken down. That said, some of the key musical influences on alternative music at this time tends to be hip hop flavored pop, 80’s influenced synth, indie folk music, and all combinations of those styles; all though nothing is really ruled out in the anything goes modern era. Another interesting factor for 2018 is that we are now deep enough into the new century that all but three of these groups, including even the more veteran acts on the list, are bands that formed and found their success in the 2000’s. This means that we are now firmly into the third era of alternative music.\n\n“Jumpsuit” – Twenty-One Pilots From the album Trench\n\nTwenty-One Pilots followed up their blockbuster breakthrough album Blurryface with 2018’s much anticipated Trench, which opened with the hard hitting, bass-driven “Jumpsuit”. While at heart “Jumpsuit” follows the familiar pattern established by Twenty-One Pilots the song does push the boundaries of their sound by adding heavier metallic and emo elements to their musical formula (the song kicks especially hard at its introduction before falling into a more recognizable form), while lyrically the song introduces the vaguely prog storyline of the Trench album. It is a song designed to both keep old fans and potentially win new ones and it works.\n\n2. “You Should See Me In A Crown” – Billie Eilish From the single “You Should See Me In A Crown”\n\nLike many other new artists Billie Eilish not only straddles the line between alt rock, hip hop, pop, and dance, she moves back and forth from genre to genre effortlessly and without thinking about it or worrying about her audience. A musical descendent of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, among others, “You Should See Me In A Crown” is a sharp, club-friendly, genre-defying grinder that allows Eilish to brag with rap like arrogance, while the music buzzes with the dark and sexy menace of Depeche Mode or one of their younger progeny. It’s a great track that is a near perfect embodiment of the current state of music.\n\n“Gold Rush” – Death Cab For Cutie From the album Thank You For Today\n\nWhile Death Cab For Cutie is primarily the project of singer/songwriter Ben Gibbard, the album Thank You For Today found the group working without longtime guitarist, producer, and secret weapon Chris Walla in any capacity for the first time. To deal with this subtle but key loss Gibbard adds two new members to the group and returns the band to the quiet, intimate character sketches and still lives of the group’s early work, while keeping the slick, pristine production of their later albums. It is a strategy that takes a few listens to reveal its genius but undoubtedly works, as lead single “Gold Rush” – actually one of the slightly harder edged moments on the album – proves as it unwinds its tale of urban sprawl and the loss of memory associated with it.\n\n“Make America Great Again” – Frank Turner From the album Be More Kind\n\nMaybe no song better captures the political zeitgeist in the era of Trump than British folk/punk singer Frank Turner’s “Make America Great Again”. The song is a plea for a better world that "
