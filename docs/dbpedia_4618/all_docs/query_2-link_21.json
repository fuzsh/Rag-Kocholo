        "text": "Photo via Slowdive's Facebook\n\nRachel Goswell of Slowdive, Editors' Justin Lockey, Mogwai's Stuart Braithwaite, and James Lockey of Hand Held Cine Club are at work on a new album as Minor Victories, Goswell has announced. It'll feature Mark Kozelek's previously reported duet with Goswell, with more collaborations in the pipeline.\n\nSpeaking about the project, James Lockey said:\n\nSo there's a record (like a real long player from back in the day) being made, a band being formed, noise being traded, analogies thrown around between Rachel Goswell (Slowdive) Justin Lockey (Editors) Stuart Braithwaite (Mogwai) James Lockey (handheldcineclub). There's some other people involved too but more on that later... For the time being, it's sounding fucking class."
