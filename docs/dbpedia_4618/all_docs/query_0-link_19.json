        "text": "Marissa Conlon April 17th, 2019 - 2:29 AM\n\nEnglish singer songwriter and musician Rachel Goswell announced the creation of her new band The Soft Cavalry. The band will include both Rachel Goswell and Steve Clark. Additionally, The Soft Cavalry just released their new song titled “Dive” off the band’s self titled album which will be released on July 5th of this year.\n\nThe Soft Cavalry is a duo made up of Rachel Goswell and her husband Steve Clarke. The two were married back in 2018. Rachel Goswell has made contributions to many groups and was a member of Slowdive and Mojave 3. The sounds of Slowdive included psychedelic guitar layering and soft vocals that became indicative of most of their tracks. On the other hand, Mojave 3 sounded less electronic and more acoustic with folk music influence. These themes most likely informed “Dive” as the folk driven vocals intermix with the psychedelic sounding electric guitar.\n\n“Dive” has a mellow, modern, and dreamy feel to it. The looping, slow, and steady guitar line anchors the song throughout and is almost meditative as it repeats over and over. It’s slow tempo, soft drumming, and ringing guitar notes make for a wonderfully calming tune. Even in the more intense parts of the songs where the guitar becomes increasingly distorted, the track still maintains an air of simplicity and tranquility. The vocals in the tune aren’t particularly impressive but its subdued sound helps maintain the song’s melancholy musical themes. Listen to the song below:\n\nIt should be intriguing to hear what other songs this new band has in store. Hopefully, The Soft Cavalry will have tracks that are just as easy to listen to and as musically diverse as “Dive.”\n\nHere’s the track list below:\n\n1. “Dive”\n\n2. “Bulletproof”\n\n3. “Passerby”\n\n4. “The Velvet Fog”\n\n5. “Never Be Without You”\n\n6. “Only In Dreams”\n\n7. “Careless Sun”\n\n8. “Spiders”\n\n9. “The Light That Shines On Everyone”\n\n10. “Home”\n\n11. “Mountains”\n\n12. “The Ever Turning Wheel”\n\nPhoto Credit: Michele Baptista"
