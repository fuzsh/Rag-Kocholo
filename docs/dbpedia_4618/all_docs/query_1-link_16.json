        "text": "British shoegaze legends Slowdive are one of the few massively important ’90s guitar bands (or at least, the ones without dead frontmen) who haven’t reunited yet, but there’s still a very good chance that they could get back together sometime soon. Last year, former frontman Neil Halstead played a pair of solo shows in London, and his old bandmate Rachel Goswell joined him for a few songs. And in an interview last year, Halstead said that the band was open to getting back together; the only requirement would be “just shitloads of money.” Signs now show that someone has anted up. As Vanyaland points out, there’s a new Slowdive Twitter account that’s been quietly activated, and all the band members except Halstead were among the first followers. They have also been counting down to 1/29 on their person Twitters. That’s obviously something less than a formal announcement, but it’s still a hopeful sign."
