        "text": "One should never judge a book by its cover, but looking at the album art of Kaskashir but the Australian band Endless Valley may give you a pretty good idea of what is in store musically. For this is colorful music in many (endless) aspects; taking hints from ethno folk, desert blues, fuzz rock, and psychedelic mantra music and creating a incredibly positive vibe that breathes vibrancy and joy.\n\nSinger Luna takes credit for a lot of that vibrancy; presenting herself as a manic shaman, joy bringer, enchantress, and altogether stylish and theatrical frontperson of Endless Valley. Her vocals consist of a mixture of lyrical poetry and wordless chants creating a mystical atmosphere.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the band weave their musical story around her, never bound to any single genre. Where they need to be fuzzy and heavy they are, where they need to be dreamy they are, and when shit needs to be fired up on the dance floor they deliver too.\n\nThe combined mixture is as colorful as the album art promises, and a very enjoyable and inspiring listen on its own, but I suspect that Endless Valley ultimately is a most magical live experience, and one can only. hope they will venture outwardly from their continent soon into the world to spread their songs of joy and dreams.\n\nWe asked singer Luna to introduce her band and she gladly did so. We talked about the strange language on the album, their influences, and of course their dreams…\n\nHi guys, how is Endless Valley doing, how has your day been so far?\n\nHey, we are feeling really excited. The Kaskashir tour begins this Saturday in Sydney so just feeling pumped. We also had a rehearsal last night which went really well.\n\nCan you introduce yourselves to the Weirdo Shrine audience?\n\nI’m Luna the lead singer and percussionists we have Brad on bass, Cavell rhythm guitar. Joining us for the tour will be Sandro on drums, Leigh on lead guitar and Dylan synth and percussion.\n\nWhat are your musical backgrounds?\n\nWe seem to have a pretty eclectic taste. Mostly take influences from African/middle eastern music. Western rock/folk. I’ve been listening to mostly Afghani funk recently.\n\nWhere do you live and how does your geographical situation influence your music?\n\nWe are based in Brisbane but Leigh is based in Tasmania which makes it a little limited for us to jam but when we do get together we make the most of it. We also still jam and play live with Seb Ward who plays lead on Kaskashir. Endless Valley is endless so whoever is around is welcome.\n\nCan you explain what Nayavida and Kaskashir mean? What language are they and where does it come from?\n\nNayivada just like Never Neverland or Narnia is a make believe land I created in my dreams as child and still visit till this day. It’s a portal in the sun where I am at peace, where I feel at home and as one with source. I come from a very pretty magical family where creativity was deeply encouraged as well as music. As a child I would create chants with my sisters and sing them to my parents. That’s when I started chanting and later would chant with my friends in Nayivada wrote them down in the hopes to share them through a musical project when I was older. To be honest I believe it’s light language. If you know what that means then you understand what I’m talking about. Brad came up with the word ‘Kaskashir’ and we gave it meaning ‘eternal’ because we are eternal beings.\n\nWhat are the most important musical influences to your music?\n\nIt would be music with a message that can heal this planet.\n\nWhat are the most important non-musical influences to your music?\n\nTraveling, connecting with different cultures. There is so much we can learn from one another. Reading, because of course knowledge is power. It awakens the soul and opens a gateway to another realm only one can imagine. We are seekers and deliverers of the truth.\n\nWhat are your dreams for Endless Valley?\n\nTo keep making music together and explore different sounds. Travel across this beautiful planet and connect with musicians from all walks of life to join the endless valley family. We hope to release more music shortly after our tour. But most importantly to keep spreading the message of peace and to do as much as we can to help heal planet earth because that is our mission.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do after reading this interview?\n\nGo and listen to Kaskashir and meditate the fuck out of it!!\n\nhttps://www.copperfeastrecords.com/\n\nhttps://copperfeastrecords.bandcamp.com/\n\nhttps://endlessvalley.bandcamp.com/album/kaskashir\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/endlessvalley\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/endlessvalleyband\n\nFrancesca Bonci is an Italian based visual artists that creates music videos for bands like Pete International Airport, and Federale, and live visuals at shows as well. She does things a little differently than most in that she likes to keep things as analog as possible, loving to throw oldschool visual units and blenders in the mix. We talked to her as she just finished up her stunning new video for Dutch psychedelic rock band No Man’s Valley, who connected to her on a personal level through the lyrics and feel of their song Seeing Things, a mournful document of slowly going crazy during the pandemic.\n\nHi Francesca! How are you doing at the moment? What was the last thing that amazed you?\n\nHI! I feel pretty good, thanks for asking. And thank you for the interview! Let’s say that for some years now life has been forcing me to face constant challenges, but overall I am ok. I’m not one to feel sorry for myself or to give up in the face of adversity. Even if I’m a little tired. The last thing that really surprised me happened just a few days ago, when a wonderful person helped me to solve a big problem even though he wasn’t a really close friend. And he did it because of what my art conjured up on him. It was a very surprising act.\n\nCan you introduce yourself and the creative things you do?\n\nI am Italian with Thai origins on my mother’s side and I think this has always influenced the way I see and feel things. I have always traveled a lot since I was a child and I love meeting and learning from people of different cultures and languages than mine. I viscerally love music and always, when I listen to it, my mind travels and creates worlds and visions. Through art I have also been able to break down barriers, always be myself, overcome shyness and keep certain demons that inhabit my soul at bay. I create videos and visuals for both songs and live shows of international independent projects. Before the pandemic I participated in many festivals around Europe and I worked a lot with the post-rock world which lent itself more to having visuals projected during live performances. I collaborate with some London based labels and I have some projects with which I collaborate on a recurring basis. I don’t like categorizations and I have the quality of having a recognizable style regardless of the project I collaborate with. When I create I’m really happy. I also have my own personal project called Purple Moon Oneironauts which starts from the idea of unrepeatable performances of audio-visual improvisation with the possibility of audience integration and which takes into account the place where it is implemented. Everything happens in a kind of lucid dream, which is the leitmotif of the project.\n\nDuring the lockdown I did some sessions with the title “Breathing Rooms” where I invited musicians from various countries and we involved radio stations, art platforms, galleries, festivals which then hosted/broadcast the show. The idea was to keep artists and places of culture alive in that terrible moment.\n\nWhat is your educational background? Have you always been creative?\n\nI think I have been since the day I was born. My family never really encouraged my artistic aptitude, but I expressed it in whatever way I could. I love reading, watching movies, writing, drawing, creating things. Then after classical high school, I decided to enter the academy of fine arts at my own expense, where they had just established a new degree in multimedia design and visual design. And all my passions have acquired a different meaning. They were stimulating years, but to tell the truth they didn’t help me settle down on a professional level, in Italy art remains a somewhat difficult topic to deal with, especially video art and after various detours, I decided to carry forward my ideas autonomously and without ever compromising. The Internet helped me show my stuff around the world and get where I never thought I would go and so I started creating videos and visuals for international bands.\n\nWhere do you live and how does it influence your art?\n\nI am currently living in Bologna, but I was born in Turin and raised in the province of Pesaro and Urbino, in central Italy. I arrived here by chance, exactly 10 years ago, after living in Lisbon (a wonderful city) for 7 years. I don’t think Bologna influences my art, it’s just the place where I live with my partner. My whole artistic world develops outside and I have practically no artistic connection with this city.\n\nCan you tell me about your visual art? What is your vision? What are the coolest things you did so far?\n\nWhen I collaborate on a project, I try to get into it and make it my own. First of all I have to love the project because otherwise I just can’t create. The entire first phase is a real study of the concept behind the project, the album, the song. If we’re talking about things I don’t know, then I try to learn more about them through books or films until I really get into them. Then I try to approach it as if I were an added member of the band who has to enrich the song or songs in the case of a live visual set, trying to respect it as much as possible. The true creative phase is pure instinct and emotion. It happens in the timeline or on my setup of analog devices with which I improvise. I literally close my eyes to hear the music and then transform this feeling into visions, colors, shapes. This visceral way of approaching projects creates a fairly deep bond with the people I collaborate with and this is very rewarding because it is almost always mutual. I really like elective affinities and my main intent is mutual support between artists and making sure that art, the beautiful one, the authentic and unconditional one, never dies, because I believe it is the only thing capable of saving us, always.\n\nI can’t really tell you if there are things that are more beautiful than others because in all sincerity they all have a very great value for me. But I can tell you that among the last things I did, collaborating with Peter Holmström of Dandy Warhols in his fantastic project Pete International Airport (https://peteinternationalairport.bandcamp.com ) was an important experience, for many reasons: I am a huge fan of both of Peter’s projects, so to be able to work with someone you’ve always seen on stage and see your name on the vinyl next to all the other records… it was really crazy; It was one of the projects that gave me more visibility and allowed me to interact with a wider audience. I created the album cover artwork Cover /Artwork and the three songs for which I created the videos featured Jagz Kooner, incredible artist and producer of Primal Scream, Massive Attack, Garbage (The Watermark) among others. Lisa Elle from Wild Horses (Next Of Kin) and Rachel Goswell from Slowdive… (TIC TAC); and many other wonderful artists. My relationship with the people involved during the creation was very sweet and they made me feel good, just like anyone else I was lucky enough to work with. I felt I was respected as an artist. And it happened in a very dark moment when I wasn’t feeling very well. I am really very grateful to Peter.\n\nYour work is based on analog devices, right? Can you show us your most important tools and tell us about them?\n\nIt doesn’t rely exclusively on analog devices. In reality they are tools that I use exactly like digital ones or like colored pencils with which I make illustrations or watercolor sketches for animations which I use to create the material that I will then manipulate and assemble in the timeline with my editing software. During the first lockdown I had the time and courage to experiment with some video synths and analogue mixers for the first time, which I use connected to old cathode ray tube TVs and old mixers. Since then they have been an integral and predominant part of my creative setup, but always mixed with a lot of other not necessarily analogue stuff. My analog devices all built by small European DIY producers, which I really can’t do without are: a VHS processor from Lo-Fi Future ((England), a prototype built inside a VHS that acts on the color creating very glitchy chromatic effects interesting, The MisMatcher 01 Rev (which I won!) and its small version MisMatcher Petite from Freedom Enterprise (Portugal) which is a compact device containing 3 analog circuits that can be interconnected via patch cables to create very particular distortions. And finally a Very basic Dirrty Mixer for the image distortion from Mezkalin (Germany) I really like connecting them to a Roland Edirol V4 mixer.\n\nWhat inspires you? Do you actively seek out inspiration?\n\nEverything I have known and learned in my life inspires me. I am certainly very fascinated by a certain science fiction genre that finds its maximum expression in cyberpunk, Philip K Dick, I love the Beat Generation, David Cronenberg, the Fluxus movement and the video art of the 70s, Tarkovsky, Fernando Pessoa, David Carson’s typographic design, the nature, the sky, the dreams I make …I never look to others as a source of inspiration, I realize later that that thing has influenced me. I certainly have some very recurring things in my works: the eyes, the birds, the dream component.\n\nCan you shine a light on the projects you are currently working on?\n\nA video for the band Pulse Park (Germany/Canada) will be released soon, as well as a video for the band No Man’s Valley (Netherlands). I am working on the fourth video for the project One-Legged Heart (San Francisco) and I am working on a video for the beautiful project Federale by Collin Hegna, also a member of Brian Jonestown Massacre. In the meantime I continue to create visions for the experimental music label Specimen Records featuring many artists from the global electronic and dance scene.\n\nYou recently did a video for No Man’s Valley’s song Seeing Things! What can you tell me about the video, and what images the song conjured up for you?\n\nIt was intense. I felt connected because Jasper told me he wrote the song during the pandemic. I think I experienced common feelings and moments and while I was listening to the song I felt all those sensations again. I tried to recreate this emotional surrealism through colors and evocative images: insects, water, lights.\n\nTell me about the future, what should we look out for?\n\nThe future… certainly full of interesting projects. I hope to go back to traveling and doing live shows because I’ve been stuck for too long. I would also like to get back to doing something with my personal project and I would like to have the opportunity to work on theatre. And I will continue to dream.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nIf I intrigued them, please go and see my works and if they are musicians they could also contact me haha.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/francescabonci.visualartist\n\nhttps://francescaboncivisualartist.wordpress.com/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fraboncivisualartist/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/francescabonci_visualartist/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/scindin/videos\n\nThere is an ethereal mist surrounding Sons Of Zöku that completely sets them apart from their peer in psych pop/rock today. Could it be their Australian roots? The remoteness and the otherworldliness also found in bands like King Gizzard and Tame Impala? Who knows, and also who cares really; the important thing is that they are here, and that we can dive into their wonderful tranquil pool of soothing multi vocals, reverb, and fuzz….\n\nLike other contemporary psychedelic indie colleagues Upupayama, Vampire Weekend or Wolf People, Sons Of Zöku have found a natural way to merge ancient folk vibes from allover the world into their mellow psych songs. From the pastoral flutes of the Irish fields to the Touareg blues of the African desert, or the sitar song of India, Sons Of Zöku respectfully borrows, forges new connections, and morphs it into their own sound.\n\nAnother strong vibe that radiates from Ëndlëss is that it is more than just a piece of music, it presents itself as a portal or a shrine through which we might find more than just music. When they chant “meet me on the other side if you will” you feel the willingness to take their hands and transcend to a lighter state of being. Leaving troubles behind, clearing the mind of clutter. Mindfulness in indie rock form, just the thing we needed in this hurried bustling world. Sounds vague? Nah, you just need to spin this album a few more times…it will come to you.\n\nI reached out to the band and found Portuguese born Ricardo Da Silva (vocals/guitar) at the helm, willing to provide the answers to my questions. An image unfolds of a strong collective with a unified vision that will very probably take them across many seas and hopefully even to Europe. But let’s meet them first and get to know Sons Of Zöku:\n\nHi guys, how is Sons Of Zöku doing these days? What is the last thing you did that gave you an energy boost?\n\nPretty exciting to see our second album ËNDLËSS getting ready to be released, looking at all the amazing art work on vinyls and things like that, its pretty exciting. Also getting invited to play gigs like supporting Minami Deutsch in Perth and in our hometown, things like that always give us an extra boost.\n\nCan you introduce the band to the Weirdo Shrine?\n\nOf course, Ric (me) on vocals, guitar and electric sitar, Ica on flute, keys, vocals and everything percussion, Jordan Buck on Bass and so much more behind the scenes, Hannah Yates on vocals, bongos, congas, electric guitar and keys, Oscar Ellery on electric guitar and sitar and Eddie Hannemann on drums.\n\nWhat are your musical backgrounds?\n\nI started playing guitar and singing with my friends in Portugal, they had a band and I used to come around and watch them play and thought was the greatest thing ever. Eventually they told me if you can learn a song then I would be in the band, I took it literally and started practicing, I still sucked but eventually they let me join because we were all best friends. When I moved to Australia that was always the idea, to create a musical family. With time and watching each other bands and projects the band started taking shape, first me and Ica, then Jordan, then Hannah, Oscar and Eddie. A few different members in between but I won’t bore you with that.\n\nWhere are you based, what is the scene like, and how has it influenced your sound?\n\nWe are based in South Australia, Adelaide. The music scene is really diverse, lots of different styles and sounds. It’s a great place to live, has a bit of everything, ocean, hills, countryside, a bit of desert.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the new album and its path to enlightenment? How should we listen to it in regard to its message?\n\nTo us, ËNDLËSS represents our path to enlightenment individually and as a band. We are all in our own journeys to find purpose which brings us closer to happiness I guess. This album sings a lot about that, songs like Earth Chant sing lines like… ”air is all I got, my god is air” or “when here and now we eternally bound” talk about to truly live is to simple breathe and in the moment so cliché yet so hard to achieve, or a song like Hunters… “we strong enough never to drown at sea, just weak enough never to make it to shore” or “we walked and sailed for days at once to a place where all the clouds were gone, to find nothing we found everything still we try and try and try, but words got in our way” and “ many years gone by but we still try searching for something we can’t be sure”, the struggles of becoming a successful band, to find our shore. Yumi, “here we are all form enlightened, here we are the void in spite of” or simply “the arrow is your guru”, what you aim to do in life is your purpose, guides you. Kuhnoo…”will we ever bloom to bear our own weight”, Nu Poéme.. “say what you feel say what you want for once”… so many examples I could give you but at the end of the day we would like to believe that music transcends all that, and that the listener will find their own meaning out of it.\n\nEndless is your second album, what difference in approach did you guys take when creating it?\n\nSÜN was more of a collection of songs over the years as a band, ËNDLËSS is more a representation of the band at a specific moment in time, a time where we are ever-changing in our personal lives and musically. It was a more calculated effort to say what we feel and less stream of consciousness type of writing.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the non-music influences that inspired you to make the album?\n\nWe truly believe art is life and living, getting ideas in terms of music and sound from other artists is a big part of music, but to turn it into art and something meaningful to us, life and how we feel is the most important thing to us. We have lived, and we are living, that is the biggest catalyst in our songwriting.\n\nWho are some artists that you really hold dear at the moment?\n\nMdou Moctar, Les Filles de Illighadad, The Perks of being a wallflower soundtrack, North Americans “Going Steady” album, Air, Vashti Bunyan, also I swear I have on repeat Raly Barrionuevo “De Alberdi” song and Nicholas Britell “Little’s Theme” from Moonlight motion picture soundtrack.\n\nWhat does the future look like for Sons Of Zoku? And when can we expect a European tour?\n\nRight now the plan is to release ËNDLËSS into the world and then to see how our European fans receive it, but we definitely have them in our sights and we can’t wait to meet them all soon.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nFollow Sons of Zöku on Spotify then put your headphones, ear pods or whatever, press play on any of our songs and go do something, bike ride, the dishes, cooking, jog, lay down, meditate, whatever, just let us be the soundtrack to whatever is happening in your life. If you like it, privately share it with a friend or loved one, that’s what’s all about.\n\nhttps://sonsofzoku.bandcamp.com/album/ndl-ss-2\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/sonsofzoku/\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/sonsofzoku\n\nhttps://www.copperfeastrecords.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CopperFeastRecords\n\nFor one of the final pieces of the blog to finish up this interview with Heave Blood & Die seems pretty appropriate. Especially considering the fact that their new album is called Burnout Codes, and that it puts the emphasis on our fast paced society and being tired all the time. After the wonderful covid-inspired daydream album Post People, HB&D are showing themselves to be ready to shed their shoe gazing selves and dance. With a just confirmed spot at the prestigious showcase festival Eurosonic it would seem to be only a matter of time before you will too. I talked to vocalist, guitarist and drum machine operator Karl Løftingsmo Pedersen.\n\nHi guys! Good to hear you are back! Last time we spoke we were in the midst of the pandemic, how have you been since?\n\nHello, thanks! It’s been stormy and turbulent these last years. But I sense we’re moving towards brighter times and the release of Burnout Codes is going to be redemptive.\n\nAny changes within the band, be it literally or in mindset?\n\nQuite literally there have been changes. After we finished recording this record we lost our good friend and bassist Eivind to suicide. I am ever grateful for Luna who joined the band in a heartbeat and joined us on tour in Europe for her first shows with us.\n\nThe new album sounds invigorating! Am I right in hearing less of the melancholic vibe of the previous album? Do you agree and can you explain it?\n\nThanks!\n\nEvery point of view on a record is valid, it’s nice to hear your outlook!\n\nFor me it’s as sad as it gets, it might be because of the process and time we have left behind us. Burnout Codes is closer to reality for me, I’ve always covered up the things that’s difficult, but this time around it’s more open and stripped down.\n\nThe faster tempo all across this record makes it feel less mopey than Post People, we wanted to push in a more restless, energetic and violent direction.\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about the background of the album title Burnout Codes? Is there an overall theme on the album?\n\nThe title of the record is meant as a self-help book; a step by step guide to being really fucking tired all the time.\n\nIf I were to visualise the record with just a few sentences, it would be something like: «late nights in big cities wandering aimlessly in the middle of high intensity traffic strung out with seemingly never ending anxiety in strobing neon lights».\n\nI am very inspired by sci-fi movies and ambient textures, goth and new-wave music, also I really like using looping as a workflow when composing.\n\nIf you could change anything about society right now, what would it be?\n\nIt’s easy to say “everything”, but I don’t think that answers anything.\n\nCan I solve it with “fuck/marry/kill”?\n\nFuck – war\n\nMarry – the environmental movement\n\nKill – right-wing populists\n\nWhat role do you think a band and its messages play in modern society?\n\nI am under the impression that everything I have done since adolescence is somehow influenced by music, the need to create and the subcultures that surround it. Underground scenes are inspiring and will continue to shape people. Music creates changing ripples in everything from human values to aesthetic across society, it’s really something.\n\nHow are you received in your home country? And what differences do you see when you perform in other countries?\n\nI think the main difference in playing shows back home and what we have experienced abroad is that you can feel people’s energy more in Continental Europe, people move more and give more of themselves. We’re quite rigid here in Norway.\n\nWhat are some of the new bands you have picked up recently that you listen to and that may have had their influence?\n\nThere’s some Norwegian bands that are really worth checking out!\n\nFor northern Norwegian bangers you have to check out Nonne, highlight track: “Om igjen”.\n\nDaufødt is really cool, Annika who makes our artworks is the vocalist. noise-rock for the masses! Highlight track: “Knekken” (with guest vocals from yours truly).\n\nAlso, Outer Limit Lotus for mopey goth tunes!\n\nHighlight track: “Let The Night Ride You Home”.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to most in the remainder of 2023?\n\nBeing with my dog and girlfriend, hiking, working at the bar and attending my group therapy.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nPat a dog, talk to someone you care about and if you’re feeling low – seek help. You should listen to our newest release on repeat!\n\n—–\n\nOkidoki\n\nhttps://heavebloodanddie.bandcamp.com/album/burnout-codes\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/heavebloodanddie\n\nhttps://www.heavebloodanddie.com/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/heavebloodanddie\n\nWorking on an album all by yourself within the DIY ethic can be quite a pain in the backside, especially when it comes to planning. I am working on such a project with my band at the moment and I can completely relate to Cameron Selbig and his band Bleeding Lizard that way. So it was no surprise to me that even though we finished our interview months ago, it still took until November to release the new album The Mind Garden and for Weirdo Shrine to publish this article. It is all good though, just listen in quickly and see why nobody into some seriously psychedelic indie rock should miss this gem!\n\nHow are you? How was the pandemic period for Bleeding Lizard?\n\nWell to be quite honest, this band formed well after the whole pandemic period. Since we’ve been refraining from live shows for now, there hasn’t been much interaction with us and the COVID virus. Let’s hope things stay that way when we get out on the road haha\n\nCan you introduce yourself and your multiple musical projects? And what can you tell me about your musical background?\n\nMy name is Cameron Selbig and I have been releasing music since I was 13 years old (I’m 20 now). I’ve had a love for music ever since I was a little toddler and that has only grown as I get older. In middle school, my best friends (Benson Wood, Noah Tresner) and I started our first band called “Borderline Youth” because we all liked playing music and being in a band just sounds awesome when you’re 13 years old. We actually ended up playing quite a few shows and making a little 5 song self-titled EP and a Christmas single. Those times were fun but as we got older and entered highschool, drama arose and we eventually broke up. After that I took on making music on my own with a tiny little audio interface and a single microphone. I took on making beats in an FL Studio Demo and quickly became infatuated, I made a few horrid sounding demos and decided that music was something I would put aside for a while. Eventually I joined forces with Benson and Noah again to become what is now our main project, “Flying Fuzz”. In our time apart, Benson and Noah had picked up heavy metal and punk music and indoctrinated me into the culture. We soon picked up another member, Albert Motzel, and started playing shows all over the midwest and have made an album and 2 EPs since.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your life look like?\n\nA regular day for me isn’t much to share about, typically I’ll wake up, go into my job at the University of Minnesota, exercise, cook something nice for myself and then find some time to get outside and do something creative\n\nWhat is the best thing about The Mind Garden?\n\nThe absolute best part of The Mind Garden is that it is a culmination of almost all of my musical influences up to this point and serves as a look into my mind. I feel like this album is truly a full expression of me and my essence and I hope that some people can relate to my experiences.\n\nWhere do you live and what is the environment like for musicians like you?\n\nAs of writing this I am living in both Minneapolis, MN and Madison, WI. I think that the environment for musicians in Minneapolis is amazing, there are a ton of bigger venues for smaller local artists to make their way to as well as a community for almost every genre. I do have to say there is heavy favoritism and weird clique drama between a lot of the local bands around here though. It IS avoidable if you stick mostly to yourself but honestly finding close connections in the music world here is very difficult. Lots of transactional relationships and shit-talking other bands. Madison is much worse though, there is almost nowhere to play anymore unless you’re just setting up your equipment in a park somewhere, almost all venues are 21+ and usually don’t book local acts unless they are huge bands. The DIY scene has always been great with a lot of comradery but its taken a hit this past year with the death of many of the venues that were willing to allow local acts to play. R.I.P Truckers Atlas. This is a topic I could talk about much more in depth for much longer but I feel that this interview is already getting a bit lengthy\n\nWho are some contemporary musical heroes of yours?\n\nLauryn Hill, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, Mac Demarco, Crumb, VomBom, SHOOBIE are all amazing\n\nCan you tell me about how you go about composing and recording songs?\n\nOur process is fairly unorthodox at the moment, everything is DIY and we are only just beginning to understand the nuance of the recording arts. We record out of a bedroom studio doing live drum takes into a 16-track recorder and then layering the rest of the instruments and vocals on top. Most of the songs were written as they were recorded and each one took about a day or two to record. Overall it took us about 2 weeks to be finished writing and recording. Since then, I have been spending countless hours in FL Studio, mixing and mastering all of the songs to get them to a professional sounding quality.\n\nWhat are your immediate and long term future plans?\n\nWe will be preparing our live band for fall shows and planning an album release show in November.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nGo head on over to our spotify to listen to our first 2 singles, check out our instagram too, where we keep updates on how the band is doing plus what we’re working on 🙂\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bleedinglizard/\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/0tB0WfAnVpPZs33PmihxcL?si=gmIrOhfNQyq7rVMk_wLyZQ&nd=1\n\nThe combination between the French progressive rock avantgardos Poil and the Japanese chant singer Ueda remains one of the most striking sounds that ever hallowed the Weirdo Shrine. Especially live, the Poil Ueda is a spectacular sight to be seen. It’s good then that with Yoshitsune they have gathered some more material to display on the international stages. It is the companion piece to last year’s self-titled album, and another work of art to marvel at. We looked up the band on the road for a little chat…\n\nHi guys! How has the time between the debut album and Yoshitsune been for you as a band?\n\nWe toured a lot and consolidated our cohesion with Junko. The concerts generally went very well and we got warm feed back from the audience.\n\nHow have the reactions been? What were some of the most striking responses?\n\nMany people tell us that they have never heard this kind of music before.\n\nYou have played a lot of live shows and made quite an impression on many people, what are some of your best memories playing live?\n\nIt is very difficult to give a quick answer. We played in many different kinds of venues, sometimes people were very expressive, dancing and headbanging, and other time the audience sat down, very concentrated, listening to the details of our music. One of my favorite memories is our concert in Rudolstat (DE) with a large and captivated audience. Each concert at Tor9, in Bremen is a great pleasure, with the right grain of madness. Our balkan tour last spring was a delicious journey, the Polish audience is especially inflamed and we like that !! Rakia from Zagreb was tasty… And we love the Agly festival, and Luc’s Wine.\n\nIn what way was creating Yoshitsune different from making the debut album? It sounds like a natural progression to me 😉\n\nIt was the same process, at the same time in the same place. It is just two parts of one big work. So I understand your feeling ;))\n\nWhat can you tell me about the artwork? It feels like it ties the two album together quite nicely!\n\nthe artwork has been created by Lilas Malas , a French artist we very much love the work . We had already worked with her for Brossaklitt , our third record . Lilas did both covers of “PoilUeda” and “Yoshitsune” , the music itself comes from a same recording session and was written at the same moment , that is why we wanted the covers to show a very similar ambiance .\n\nWhat is the album about lyrically? Did you talk to Ueda about this in detail?\n\nThe album is written upon a traditional japanese epic story about a very famous samouraï named Yoshitsune , forced to flee through the country after being sentenced to death by his older brother . the lyrics are written in the layout of the album\n\nWhat is/are some of the most important things you have learned over the last year?\n\nFinland is NOT in Scandinavia\n\nHow is touring with Ueda, she hasn’t been in your band before, has she become a full member?\n\nTouring With Junko Ueda is a daily pleasure , and yes she is a full member of the band .\n\nWhat are your plans for the near future? And what are your dreams for the further future?\n\nRelease the album , play amazing shows all around . We would love to tour Japan !\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nThrow the fruit and eat the shell.\n\nhttps://poil.bandcamp.com/album/yoshitsune\n\nhttps://duretdoux.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://duretdoux.com/en/home/\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/POILband\n\nWe are time travelling back to the year 1998, Philadelphia in the United States Of America. The Asteroid No4 is releasing their debut album, a wonderful album full of new interpretations of early Pink Floyd‘s weirdo music, hazy shoe gazing Velvet Underground inspired psych, and just wonderful psychedelic indie rock music. If you play it today it still sounds fresh. Which is exactly why it makes so much sense to re-release it on vinyl today. Little Cloud Recordings and Cardinal Fuzz jumped at the occasion. We talked to vocalist/guitarist Scott Vitt and harked back some great memories.\n\nHi guys, how is The Asteroid no4 doing? What was the last thing on your minds?\n\nHey. We’re doing well. We’ve got a few things kicking the remainder of this year and into next, so a lot of organzing to do. The last thing on our minds? How can we make sure to make time for this apparently really good pizza joint while in Phoenix.\n\nLet’s take it all the way back to 1998, I was 14 at the time haha! What do you remember most about the time you released “Introducing…?”\n\nI don’t remember much other than all of us really wanting to make an interesting record. There was a lot happening in Philly at the time musically and there was something brewing because outsiders were aware of it, at least those in the press, etc. But really just many like-minded people wanting to make good music, an active live scene where everyone supported each other, and us having a great studio of our own to not only record ourselves, but have our peers coming in to do the same.\n\nWhat was being in the band like around that time, what were your goals and expectations?\n\nWell again, it was just wanting make good music, at least what we thought of as good, and we of course hoped that other people dug it. We were never expecting anything beyond that. I don’t recall any of us being naive in thinking that the kind of music we were interested in making would lead to anything more. So our goals have always been internal steps to becoming better songsmiths, trying what we want when we want, and to never stop experimenting or pushing ourlselves.\n\nWhat role did drugs play in the band and in its music?\n\nProbably none. Some drugs may have enhanced some experimentation, but on the flipside and in most cases, I mainly remember them slowing down our progress or making someone a “no show”. Most of our favorite bands had the facade that they were fucked up the entire time, but in reality most were very much in control and clear minded, preferring to save the drugs for listening back only after the actual work was done. Any thing else is more about someone’s attempt at being a cliche rather than a serious artist.\n\nWhat were your musical backgrounds before starting the band? Where did you all come from?\n\nWe’re all self-taught musicians and none of us neccessarily came from musical families. We may have learned about great stuff of the past from our fathers, a cool uncle, cousin, older friends, etc. Matty, Eric and I were all born and raised in and around Philadelphia, and our drummer Mark is originally from Kansas City before meeting him in the Bay Area. Eric and I have been friends since we were kids and we came up together in punk/hardcore, post-punk, goth etc of the 80s. Then we fell hard in the early 90s for shoegaze. Those bands led me right back to what my father had schooled me on from the 60s including the Byrds, The VU, and the obvious British Invasion acts.\n\nWhat was the “scene” like if there was one? Were there any important peer bands or people you looked up to?\n\nIn the mid to late 90s, Philly consisted of a lot of musicians similar to us that came out of the hardcore punk scene. There were some specific moments when a band like Dinosaur Jr. or Ride or Lush would out of nowhere be playing a club we all frequented to see punk and hardcore shows. So it was like a whole pack of music fans moving through time together. Our peers at the time were all great. We played many shows with other local bands like Lenola, Bent Leg Fatima, Bardo Pond, Asuze Plane and we admired all of them. We were also fortunate enough to be one of the bands asked to support touring bands when they came through Philly, so had the opportunity to play with bands like Medicine, The Swirlies, Mazzy Star, and The Brian Jonestown Massacre of whom we’re still friends and continue to support from time to time. I’d say of all the peers and local acts we looked up to the most, it was Kurt Heasley and Lilys. No other band has had a more profound impact on us in how they would evolve from record to record and glide between shoegaze, psychelic and our 60s influences like Kurt could.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the creation of crazy songs like No More Vitamins? What inspired those?\n\nI don’t have the faintest idea. If I were to try and tie it to what we were listening to, we were just very much inspried by everything from early Floyd in how they approached soundtracks. Also our original drumer, Bill Reim, was a few years older than us so he had a far larger and diverse record collection than any of us which was mostly made up of german bands from the late 60s and 70s. We were fortunate to have that exposure as far back as ’95 as much of the “krautrock” acts hadnt been reissued or become known to a wider group of American indie kids prior to the internet.\n\nWhat do you remember most about playing live in the 90s? What was the biggest difference with today?\n\nHard to say. I’d say we were fortunate to have been doing what we were doing and starting in a decade that in hindsight seems arguably as prolific as the 60s.\n\nWhen you listen to it now, what do you think of it? Would you have changed anything in hindsight if you could travel back in time?\n\nEvery now and then I’ll give it a listen and I still like a lot of moments on it. Some records of ours I really regret doing for a host of reasons or simply wished erased from memory and this one is far from that. I guess if we could change anything, some things would’ve been recorded differently, but its irrelevant now.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the changes made to the recordings and the extras added to the re-issue?\n\nOur current drummer, Mark Tarlton, also happens to be an amazing sound engineer. So as a way to tie our earliest selves to who we are today, we asked him if he’d remaster it. It sounds so much better to us now. Not an easy task for him as the original master tape is long gone, so he made some magic out of it. The new packaing and art is also killer and blown away about how supportive the Little Cloud guys have been in making this happen for us. We did add a bonus disc of songs that were either on singles from that time period, never released or rarities from comps.\n\nWill you play some of it live in future sets? And when will you tour again?\n\nWe often throw in a few of our songs from that time and will continue to do so. We’re about to play a handful of US west coast shows with the Brian Jonestown Massacre this month and look forward to getting back to Europe again in ’24 to support what will be a new record coming out on Club AC30 in the spring. In the meantime, we also have a 5 song EP coming out in December on Silver Arrow Records, which is Chris Robinson from The Black Crowes imprint.\n\nhttps://theasteroidno4.bandcamp.com/album/re-introducing\n\nhttps://theasteroidno4.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/theasteroidno4/\n\nhttps://littlecloudrecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://littlecloudrecords.com\n\nhttps://cardinalfuzz.bigcartel.com/product/asteroid-no-4-re-introducing-the-asteroid-no-4-3xlp\n\nWe talked to Germany’s threesome ZAHN. If their new album Adria proves anything, Berlin, it is how very versatile and rich instrumental music can be. It is a tour de force, with an hour and twenty minutes of widely varying tunes mixing up post rock with noise rock, punk, metal, psych and sludge. One thing is guaranteed: you won’t be bored. Let’s meet the band.\n\nCan you tell me how Zahn is doing, and who is in the band right now?\n\nZahn is doing extremely well, thank you! The band consists of Chris Breuer on electric bass, synthesizer and pedal steel guitar, Nic Stockmann on drums and electronic drums, and myself, Felix Gebhard, on electric guitar and occasional synth.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the formation of the band?\n\nWe met at a show we all were playing in Leipzig, Germany in late 2019. Since we immediately got along very well, we decided to try and make music together, which we did a few weeks later. Another few weeks later, with a global pandemic making its way across the globe, there wasn’t really anything else to do except play music, so we made our first album.\n\nWhere do you live and how does it affect your music?\n\nWe all live in Berlin. The big city makes certain things easy for bands, like renting a van or getting a gig. Other things, like dividing your time between being creative and having other, worldly, commitments, can get a little more complicated. That is why for recording our albums we usually withdraw to our friend Peter Voigtmann’s studio Die Mühle, in rural seclusion in Northern Germany.\n\nWhat is your musical background, and which other bands did you play in?\n\nI had some early musical training as a child, but didn’t pick up the guitar until I was about seventeen. I started playing in bands right away, faking my way around. I always played with excellent drummers, so that made up a little for my initial inabilities. My first band was called Shitlist, but you’ve certainly never heard of it. One band that traveled a little further was Home Of The Lame, which existed between 1993 and 2012.\n\nWhat is your earliest good music memory?\n\nI remember listening to cassettes in my parents’ Volkswagen T2. We used to drive across many European countries during the summer holidays every year and there was always music playing. It was then that I discovered that I liked a journey to have a specific soundtrack, which led to myself making mix tapes for my own travels later on.\n\nWhich artists were most influential for starting up Zahn and making the music you do?\n\nI wouldn’t say that there was one or more specific artists that were influential for starting this band. All three of us have many years of playing and listening to all kinds of music under the belt and I can’t say we ever talked about how we wanted this band to sound. We just dove in right away, working on a few ideas, found out that we had a cool chemistry going on and went from there and formed our first material.\n\nCheeky theory: I guess that makes ourselves the most influential artists for this group!\n\nBeing an instrumental band, how important is improvisation? How do you write songs, for that matter?\n\nAlthough I like playing improvised music, in Zahn we almost never do this. We usually have a specific riff or a beat that someone, oftentimes Chris, brings to the table and then we start working from there, trying out different ways of playing it or combining it with other parts until it makes sense to us.\n\nWhat can you tell me about your record label? What is the latest news?\n\nCrazysane Records is run by Chris. This makes for a very comfortable situation for us as a band, as we’re very quick in making decisions and managing our things. The latest news is that our second album Adria will come out on November 24. We’ve already released three tracks off the album – check them out!\n\nWhat does an ordinary day in your life look like?\n\nI play in three bands and have three kids, there are no ordinary days in my life. However, I like to sit around somewhere, read a book, sip an espresso and watch people go by, which is a one-hour pastime that I try to squeeze in regularly.\n\nWhat can we expect from the near future, and what would be a dream to come true for next year?\n\nLike I mentioned above, Adria will come out in November and we’re looking forward to taking this album on tour and playing a lot of Zahn shows in 2024.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nTurn off the electronic device they’ve read this interview on and go out to take a walk.\n\nhttps://zahn3.bandcamp.com/track/zehn\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zahn.band\n\nhttps://crazysanerecords.com\n\nhttps://crazysanerecords.bandcamp.com\n\nTRAVO is a band that has the ability to completely kick your ass and give you a much needed energy boost when you’re down. These Portuguese energetic psych prog wizards have taken the best parts of King Gizzard, Elder, Voivod, and DEVO and morphed it into a brilliant steaming psychedelic rock stew for your brain travelling purposes. I was invigorated by its sheer fierceness, and I think you will be too. So let’s not wait a minute longer and meet the band!\n\nHi guys, how are you? Can you introduce the band to the Weirdo Shrine audience?\n\nWhat’s up everyone, we are TRAVO, and we’re a psych rock band from Braga, Portugal. We\n\nare David Ferreira (bass), Gonçalo Carneiro (guitar and synths), Gonçalo Ferreira (vocals\n\nand guitar) and Nuno Gonçalves (drums). We’ve been playing together since 2017, released\n\nour first album “Ano Luz” in 2019, and “Sinking Creation” in 2022. Now we’re about to\n\nrelease our third studio album “Astromorph God”.\n\nWhere do you live, and how would you say it influences your music?\n\nAlthough we’re originally from Braga, three of us live in Porto. This city has some impact on\n\nour music, and it’s a story we like to share. There is an old shopping center, Centro Comercial STOP, where the local community transformed its aging shops into rehearsal rooms and music studios. It has become an iconic cultural center that has seen great bands emerge from there. For the past three years, we’ve spent countless hours in this unique space that has not only provided us with a sanctuary to practice but has also fueled our creativity in a very cool way, making us write our last two albums here. We think that this is the biggest influence we get on our music from the city where we live, although we obviously get inspired by a lot of artists from our hometown, Braga. Unfortunately, STOP is in the process of being shut down by the pricks who run this city, so we will have to find a new place to rehearse, but that’s another story.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the creation of Astromorph God?\n\nHalfway through 2022, a year in which we had concerts almost every weekend, we felt the\n\nneed to compose new material to continue our process of evolution as a band. We aimed for something heavier, faster, more psychedelic and with more jamming moments. We started with some basic ideas recorded at home, and then developed them further in the rehearsal room by jamming and experimenting different things throughout each track. We spent about two months working on it, fine-tuning each song until we were satisfied with it. Before going to the studio we had the opportunity to test it live which was a great warm up for the live recordings.\n\nWhat is the background story of the album title/the lyrics?\n\nWe had composed and recorded demos of all the songs with vocals, but the lyrics were just\n\ngibberish that matched the rhythm and melody of the vocal line. We had a vague idea of\n\nwhat we wanted the story to be, and decided to make each song a chapter in a fantasy saga\n\nabout five mystical stones that are hidden in five different castles, guarded by five different creatures. From then on we took the already recorded vocal lines and gibberish, and started\n\nwriting words that would fit well with the metric, the melodies and the theme. It was during\n\nthis process that the rest of the story and the elements in it acquired detail and we\n\nestablished that a main character would be present and had as his main objective the\n\nretrieving of these 5 sacred spheres. We tried to describe the appearance and abilities of\n\nthis character and the beasts, as well as the settings and events of each encounter.\n\nThe album title, Astromorph God, came much later, in a time where all the songs were\n\ncomposed and the artwork practically finished. It was heavily inspired (to say the least!) by\n\nthe name of a fictional alien species in the book All Tomorrows, by C. M. Kosemen. In this\n\nbook this alien species is called Asteromorph Gods and they’re the supreme entities of the\n\nwhole universe. We thought it fitted the vibe of the album/cover.\n\nWhich bands would you say were strongly influential in creating your own sound?\n\nThree fourths of the band met in middle school and started playing early on, before TRAVO\n\neven existed. It was around the time Tame Impala released Lonerism and we were hooked\n\non that sound and just wanted to emulate it every time we could, so I would say that was a\n\nbig influence, at least for getting started. The truth is that since then we’ve always wanted to make psychedelic music. Later on we all got into the stoner rock and metal scene, largely because SonicBlast festival is almost on our doorstep, and inevitably were influenced by some big names of this genre. If we had to choose the most influential it would definitely be Elder. As we matured as individuals and musicians our tastes changed, and so did our\n\nunderstanding of what psychedelic music can really encompass. We found stuff like\n\nMahavishnu Orchestra’s jazz fusion or Yes’ prog rock to be extremely mind altering listening experiences and we can say that it has influenced us in some way. These may be, from our perspective, the most obvious influences, but, as cliché as it sounds, we really are influenced by all the music we listen to and everything we experience in our daily lives.\n\nWhat would be the best thing to happen to Travo in the coming years?\n\nBeing able to have financial stability solely from the band’s activity would be “the dream”.\n\nAlthough half of us live from music, playing live and composing new songs for TRAVO is\n\nwhat fulfills all of us completely. We know that’s very difficult, specially in Portugal, but that’s definitely the best thing that could happen to us\n\nWhat was the best show you played so far and why?\n\nWe think that Sonic Blast was very special. It is the biggest pure rock and roll festival in\n\nPortugal and, as mentioned before, all of us are assiduous attendants. We saw many of our\n\nbiggest influences throughout the last decade and had the lucky slot of playing at 1 AM, real\n\nfestival prime time. It was a magical night, and we won’t forget it anytime soon.\n\nWhat are your immediate future plans?\n\nIn the immediate future we intend to tour intensively to show you all our new songs. We have a domestic tour scheduled, some gigs in Spain and hopefully a EU tour in 2024. And as\n\nsoon as we feel like it we’ll hit the studio again to record the next one.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nThey should sit back, relax, put on some music (Astromorph God or anything else) and\n\ntravel as far as they can within themselves. It was a pleasure answering your questions.\n\nGodspeed,\n\nTRAVO\n\nhttps://travoband.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/travoband\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/travo_band\n\nhttps://spindarecords.bandcamp.com\n\nhttps://spindarecords.com\n\nThe new Oslo Tapes album Staring At The Sun Before Going’ Blind is the definition of lush.Its rich use of reverb and various other space effects flood your speakers, and the whole album is a feast for your ears. It out-shoegazes most shoegaze bands these days, without strictly adhering to any musical genre tag. At the same time it pays homage to influences like kraut (Deja Neu) and even black metal. Let’s see what bandleader Marco Campitelli had to say about it…\n\nHi Marco, how have you been? Can you tell me about the period between Ør and the new album? Highlights/other important events?\n\nHi, thanks for the time that you are dedicating to me. The first thing that comes to my mind with the ØR album released on Pelagic Records is…Me and Mauro my long time bass player and friend and the fact that we put together a new line up and after I remember the light on the faces of the audience of the Roadburn Festival (NL) and you know, Roadburn isn’t only a festival but an immersion in the depth of music. I spent my time composing new music.\n\nCan you introduce the band to us? Who is in it, what do you do?\n\nOslo Tapes is a collective where I involve various musicians after composing the parts of a song. We have permanent members such as Mauro Spada (bass) and Davide Di Virgilio (drums) on records and live. Lucio Piccirilli (guitar/programming) is a musician and technician who plays with us at live gigs. But on every album we have different guests in every song. On this album we have great musicians like Kaouenn, Sicker Man of Trialogos, Dahm Majuri Cipolla (Mono) and Amaury Cambuzat who plays and is producer of the album as well.\n\nWhat are your musical backgrounds? What got you into the music you are making now?\n\nI started to make music in 1997. We were in the post grunge era, but I was also in love with the heavy-psych of the 70’s and the new wave of the 80’s. I’m a good fan of metal too. It might seem strange if you listen to the new album, but actually I’m listening to black metal bands. After all, on the album I used a black metal logo, I suppose that their aesthetic was as deep as the music. I want to do the same with my music.\n\nWhat makes Oslo Tapes stand out from other bands in your perspective?\n\nI’m living the music with a spiritual approach in this moment of my life and making music is something sacred,so I can say to feel myself in connection with those who do the same.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the creation of the new album “Staring at the Sun before goin’ blind”? What changed most in regard to the previous album?\n\nThe previous album was made by various producers and maybe you can listen in every song the differences.\n\nMusically “Staring at the Sun before goin’ blind’ ‘ is an album with only one producer, Amaury Cambuzat gave it another kind of feel, he is an expert for kraut noise/post rock territories. The album is more obscure than previously, with different themes from how I’ve lived my life.\n\nWhat else can I say? It’s a reflective album, I’m in the middle of my life (maybe…) and my dreams are burning inside me.\n\nWhat does the album title allude to? Is there an overall message, and what is it?\n\nI like metaphors and word plays and the title is like this. But I think that life could burn like your eyes when you look at the Sun.\n\nWhat is the best piece of music equipment you have and why?\n\nGood question, I have a lot of instruments. I can say that for this album I used my VI String Bass more than usual, maybe not the best piece of music equipment but it was the most useful to create interesting melodies.\n\nWhat is your favorite effect pedal recently and why?\n\nI think my Electro Harmonix C9 Organ Machine and Freeze.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to most in 2023?\n\nRight now I’m focused on the album’s promotion. But I want to play these new songs live.\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine readers do immediately after reading this interview?\n\nHopefully in their curiosity they will jump to our bandcamp https://oslotapes.bandcamp.com/ to listen to the new single or grab a copy of the album.\n\nhttps://oslotapes.bandcamp.com/album/staring-at-the-sun-before-goin-blind-4\n\nhttps://echodelickrecords.bandcamp.com/album/staring-at-the-sun-before-goin-blind\n\nhttps://www.soundeffect-records.gr/oslo-tapes\n\nhttps://grazilrecords.bandcamp.com/music\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/oslotapes/\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/oslotapes\n\nhttps://oslotapes.it"
