Back in 2020, they shared a series of photos from in the studio, both on their official Instagram and that of Goswell, captioning them with the hashtag “#slowdivelp5”.\n\nThe first photo originally appeared on Goswell’s socials, featuring the band’s drum kit. It was followed by an image of Nick Chaplin on his bass, and then Halstead playing guitar.\n\nSlowdive formed in the late 1980s, releasing three albums, ‘Just For A Day’, ‘Souvlaki’ and ‘Pygmalion’, before the band’s members fractured into different groups to pursue other projects.\n\nRecommended\n\nIn 2014, the band announced they would be reforming to perform at Barcelona’s Primavera Sound, following up with their first London show in 20 years.\n\nTwo years later, they announced they were working on a new album, the first since their 1995 record, ‘Pygmalion’. Following a cryptic teaser video and single ‘Star Roving’, the band released their self-titled album in 2017, their first in 22 years.\n\nLast year, it was revealed that members of Slowdive, Flaming Lips, The Soft Cavalry and Casket Girls had joined forces to form a new supergroup, Beachy Head.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe band comprises Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell and Christian Savill, Flaming Lips drummer Matt Duckworth, Ryan Graveface (Casket Girls, Dreamend) and Steve Clarke (The Soft Cavalry)."
