        "text": "Welcome back to the second (and final) installment of the 40 Best Valentine’s Day Albums Of All Time.\n\nClick here to read Part One.\n\nSo without further ado, here are the top 20 sexiest and most romantic albums ever made, comprised mostly of alternative rock, funk, soul, electronica and jazz.\n\nI’ll have essential romantic tracks under each entry. If you’d like to own any on Amazon, just click on the album image, or if you prefer iTunes, click on the album titled (highlighted in blue)\n\nClick here for my Ultimate Alternative Valentine’s Day Playlist, for single tracks that fit the occasion.\n\n20. Electric Warrior – T. Rex (1971)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B006HH5Y6K” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Electric Warrior[/amazon_image]\n\nThe sexiest glam rock record ever made. The late Marc Bolan coats every guitar lick and vocal utterance in glorious funky lust.\n\nEssential Tracks: Mambo Sun, Cosmic Dancer, Jeepster, Bang A Gong (Get It On), Girl, Life’s A Gas\n\n19. TIE: Souvlaki – Slowdive (1993) /Ask Me Tomorrow – Mojave 3 (1995)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000YV42BI” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Souvlaki[/amazon_image][amazon_image id=”B00000IP5F” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Ask Me Tomorrow[/amazon_image]\n\nIn one corner, the (recently reformed) dream pop group’s swirling set of love drunk tunes. In the other a alt-country folk group featuring Slowdive members Neil Halstead and Rachel Goswell, full of autumnal amorous bliss.\n\nSouvlaki Essential Tracks: Alison, Machine Gun, Dagger, When The Sun Hits, Here She Comes\n\nAsk Me Tomorrow Essential Tracks: Love Songs On The Radio, Candle Song 3, You’re Beautiful, Where Is The Love\n\n18. So– Peter Gabriel (1986)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B008V59AF2″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]So (25th Anniversary Remaster)[/amazon_image]\n\nGabriel ditched prog-rock weirdness for this stately collection of tunes, most of which are his most romantic to date (cue John Cusack raising his boom box):\n\nEssential Tracks: In Your Eyes, Red Rain, Don’t Give Up, Mercy Street\n\n17. xx – The xx (2009)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B002N1AEN2″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]XX[/amazon_image]\n\nThe British trio’s début album fuses trip-hop, blue-eyed soul and modern electronics into a winning package; the go-to 21st century bedroom music.\n\nEssential Tracks: Shelter, Night Time, Teardrops, Infinity, Stars\n\nClick here for my review of The XX’s Coexist\n\n16. Achtung Baby – U2 (1991)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B005Y5D7JM” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Achtung Baby (Deluxe Edition)[/amazon_image]\n\nIreland’s biggest band toned down the social commentary in favor of the affairs of the heart with Achtung Baby. It’s Bono at his most lovelorn, remaining the hopeless romantic at all costs (the original album title was Fear Of Women, due to The Edge’s recent divorce).\n\nEssential Tracks: One, So Cruel, Mysterious Ways, Love Is Blindness, Ultraviolet (Light My Way), Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\n\n15. Loveless – My Bloody Valentine (1991)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000002LRJ” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Loveless[/amazon_image]\n\nCan’t have a list of best Valentine’s Day albums without this one. Going beyond the obvious inclusion due to the band’s name, Loveless is a warm blanket of amorous emotion. Its fuzz guitar, androgynous vocals and electronic textures create a kaleidoscopic wash of diffuse romance.\n\nEssential Tracks: To Here Knows When, When You Sleep, Sometimes, Blown A Wish, I Only Said\n\nClick here for my review of their comeback album M B V\n\n14.( ) – Sigur Rós (2002)\n\nWho knows what exactly Jón Þór Birgisson is singing about in his made-up dialect, but every song on () hits sonorous notes that makes the perfect soundtrack for a soft-focus evening for two.\n\nEssential Tracks: Perfect from start to finish.\n\nClick here for my review of Sigur Ros’s Kveikur\n\n13. Hats – The Blue Nile (1989)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B00000I3JO” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Hats[/amazon_image]\n\nThis Scottish group’s smooth new wave/80’s contemporary sound is perfect for clinking celebratory champagne glasses together and all that comes afterward.\n\nEssential Tracks: Over The Hillside, The Downtown Lights, Let’s Go Out Tonight, Headlights On The Parade, Saturday Night\n\n12. Floating Into the Night – Julee Cruise (1989)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000002LH4″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Floating Into The Night[/amazon_image]\n\nAngelo Badalamenti scored David Lynch’s finest films. And together they discovered siren Julee Cruise, culminating in this epic collection of 50’s rock-jazz with a dark tinge.\n\nEssential Tracks: Floating, Falling, Mysteries Of Love, Into The Night, The World Spins\n\nMany of the songs were reinterpretations of tracks from the Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet Soundtracks, which are moody romantic works in their own right.\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000002LMM” link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Soundtrack From Twin Peaks[/amazon_image][amazon_image id=”B000001545″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Blue Velvet: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack[/amazon_image]\n\n11. Moon Safari – Air (1998)\n\nPretty much every Air album is awesome make-out music, but Moon Safari is perhaps their most direct sentiment.\n\nEssential Tracks: La Femme D’Argent, Sexy Boy, Talisman, You Make It Easy, Le Voyage De Penelope\n\n10. Tie: Violator– Depeche Mode (1990) / Ultra – Depeche Mode (1997)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000002LK1″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Violator[/amazon_image][amazon_image id=”B00I458258″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Ultra (180 Gram Vinyl)[/amazon_image]\n\nDepeche Mode have made an entire career out of slinky electronic sexual grooves, so much so that I couldn’t choose between their commercial peak of Violator or the underrated and understated, lovely Ultra. Both feature their signature themes of love, sex, kink and interconnection.\n\nViolator Essential Tracks (besides the hit singles): World In My Eyes, Sweetest Perfection, Halo, Waiting For The Night, Blue Dress\n\nUltra Essential Tracks: The Love Thieves, Home, It’s No Good, Sister Of Night, Freestate, Insight\n\nClick her for Albums Revisited: Depeche Mode’s ‘Ultra’\n\n9. Disintegration – The Cure (1989)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000002H70″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Disintegration[/amazon_image]\n\nThe Cure’s finest album is also their most romantic, even if it’s of the doomed variety. Perfect bedroom listening.\n\nEssential Tracks: All of them.\n\nClick here for my Rainy Day Playlist featuring The Cure and more…\n\n8. Boys and Girls – Bryan Ferry (1985)\n\nThe Roxy Music frontman hit his solo stride on this release, with some of the best sexual sugar high torch songs of the 80’s, all topped with his ethereal croon. Plus it has a song called Valentine, so there ya go.\n\nEssential Tracks: Valentine, Slave To Love, Boys And Girls, Swept Away, Don’t Stop The Dance\n\n7. Kind of Blue – Miles Davis (1959)\n\nEven if you’re not a jazz fan, you need Kind Of Blue in your collection. It fits any occasion, especially those of the romantic variety.\n\nEssential Tracks: Blue In Green, Flamenco Sketches, So What, All Blues\n\n6. Number 1’s – Marvin Gaye (2007)\n\nI tried to avoid going with greatest hits comps, but if you want the best Marvin Gaye bedroom tunes, picking one album just won’t work. This Greatest Hits collection has you covered. I just wish it had Trouble Man on there.\n\nEssential Tracks: What’s Going On, Let’s Get It On, Sexual Healing, Mercy, Mercy Me, etc, etc.\n\n5. Dummy – Portishead (1994)\n\n[amazon_image id=”B000001FI7″ link=”true” target=”_blank” size=”medium” ]Dummy[/amazon_image]\n\nThe Trip-Hop masterpiece mixes breakbeats, scratching, James Bond guitar twang and blaxploitation wah-wah, culminating in a lusty (if harrowing) epic.\n\nEssential Tracks: Sour Times, Glory Box, Wandering Star, It’s A Fire, Roads\n\nClick here to see where Dummy ranks on my list of Darkest Rock Albums\n\n4. The Hits / The B-Sides – Prince (1993)\n\nAgain, I was faced with a dilemma. What’s the sexiest Prince album? At his peak, any of his works would qualify, so just go for the hits collection, with all his best single, deep album cuts, and B-sides (Erotic City, the most notable)\n\nEssential Tracks: Too many to count. All good.\n\nClick here for my list of Best Rock B-Sides\n\nGreatest Hits Honorable Mention:\n\nThe Best of The London Suede – The London Suede (2011)\n\nI so badly wanted to include Suede as an official entry, but once again, any/all of their albums could qualify and I ran out of room. By far the most romantic of the Brit-pop set, this greatest hit collection has your romantic interlude more than covered.\n\n3. Mezzanine – Massive Attack (1998)\n\nMassive Attack always makes sexy music, but Mezzanine is their high water mark. It’s foreboding, yet beautiful, sensual and atmospheric, with great vocal work from reggae legend Horace Andy and Cocteau Twins singer Liz Fraser.\n\nEssential Tracks: Angel, Risingson, Teardrop, Inertia Creeps, Dissolved Girl, Man Next Door\n\n2. Love Deluxe – Sade (1992)\n\nHard to believe that Sade has only produced a meager 6 studio albums since her start in the 80’s. But lovers the world over have made do with her small, yet potent discography, and Love Deluxe ranks among the best.\n\nEssential Tracks: No Ordinary Love, Cherish The Day, I Couldn’t Love You More, Like A Tattoo, Bulletproof Soul\n\n1. Avalon – Roxy Music (1982)\n\nRoxy Music’s final proper studio album has been praised for years for its bedroom powers, and far be it from me to say otherwise. It’s a slow burner from start to finish, mixing glam and new-wave with a soulful sheen. If you’re looking to set the mood, this one never fails.\n\nEssential Tracks: More Than This, Avalon, To Turn You On, The Main Thing, The Space Between, etc, etc…\n\nSo there you have it, my list of the 40 best valentine’s day albums, or for that matter, any romantic anniversary or special occasion. As always a few fell through the cracks (apologies to Smashing Pumpkin’s Adore, in particular), but that’s the trouble with finite lists.\n\nWhich albums would make your list of most romantic?
