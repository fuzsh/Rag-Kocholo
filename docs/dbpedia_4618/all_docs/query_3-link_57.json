        "text": "The second single for Slowdive’s new album everything is alive, titled “skin in the game,” arrived this week. Along with the latest single, the five-piece band have announced a limited run of their 2017 self-titled album on Apple Opaque Vinyl.\n\nFollowing the band’s return on June 20th with leadoff single “kisses,” their newest track continues the dark, dreamy atmosphere the band is known for. Neil Halstead – guitarist, vocalist, and producer for the group – provides the prominent vocal performance, with spacey background embellishments from guitarist Rachel Goswell. Contributions from guitarist Christian Savill, bassist Nick Chaplin, and drummer Simon Scott complete what feels like an ocean of sound, with depth and layers to sink into. The guitars and vocals are submerged in reverb, obscuring most of the lyrics and creating a soft, padded force of sound.\n\nIn addition to the single, Slowdive has added a new edition of vinyl records to their webstore. In 2017, the group returned from a 22-year absence to release their fourth album Slowdive, their first since the turn of the century. This monumental album, which contains fan favorites such as “Sugar for the Pill” and “Star Roving,” is being re-released on a new, limited edition Apple Opaque vinyl. These are available to pre-order on the Secretly Store, as well as the band’s Bandcamp."
