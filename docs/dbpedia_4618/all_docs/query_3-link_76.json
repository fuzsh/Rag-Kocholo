        "text": "The new band is made up of Slowdive guitarist Christian Savill (with guest vocals from Rachel Goswell), Flaming Lips drummer Matt Duckworth, Ryan Graveface of Dreamend and The Casket Girls, and The Soft Cavalry's Steve Clarke, who is also Goswell's husband.\n\nBeachy Head will be releasing their self-titled debut album next month, and have released the closing song \"Destroy Us\" as the first taster of their album.\n\nBeachy Head by Beachy Head\n\nThe idea for Beachy Head happened in 2019 after Savill started writing and demoing songs while having a year off from Slowdive. Graveface and Savill started building the songs in Savannah, Georgia right before the global pandemic last year, while Clarke contributed his harmonies and other instrumentation in between lockdowns in the UK.\n\nBeachy Head's name is inspired by the chalk cliff in Sussex also called Beachy Head, which is one of Britainâ€™s most popular beauty spots but is also known as a notorious suicide spot.\n\nTracklist:\n\nWarning Bell\n\nMichael\n\nDistraction\n\nAll Gone\n\nLooking for Exits\n\nOctober\n\nHiddensee\n\nDestroy Us"
