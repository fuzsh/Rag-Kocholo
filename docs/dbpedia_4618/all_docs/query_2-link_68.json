        "text": "This week we are #CRUSHING on indie rock band Beach Fossils. This Brooklyn, New York collective is currently on tour for their third full-length LP, Somersault. We got a chance to chat with their frontman Dustin Payseur about what it took to release their first album in 4 years, their personal influences, and their upcoming show at the Casbah.\n\nDustin Payseur lives and breathes music. Raised by musicians, Payseur never really thought about music as anything other than a fun way to express himself. When it turned into a career for him, it never felt like work. \"I got into [music] as a kid. Both of my parents are musicians, so I've always been playing. I feel like \"career\" is almost a dirty word. It's just something I'm doing for fun and I'm lucky enough that other people enjoy it,\" he said.\n\nStatee in 2009, Beach Fossils was originally a solo project for Payseur. 8 years, 3 albums, and a few band additions later, Beach Fossils have quite a few accomplishments under their belts. Their sophomore album, Clash The Truth, peaked at number 40 on the independent albums chart, and in 2016, they starred on the HBO television series, Vinyl.\n\nThe latest single released off of Somersault is lyrically heavy but sonically light. \"Sugar,\" a hazy, nostalgic track, is about a struggle with addiction. \"Sugar is about my relationship with a bunch of friends who had been going through some pretty difficult times, with drug abusing and addiction and stuff like that. It's about watching some of your best friends turn into different people because of a substance,\" Dustin said. \"It's about wanting to lend a hand but not really being able to. It's a really fragile situation for people to be in, and trying to respect that and what they're going through.\"\n\nSomersault, which dropped June 7, is about ownership-- ownership of mistakes, of relationships, of growth and loss. The tracks are introspective and raw when written about personal experiences, observant and poignant when written about the perceived experiences of others. There are guest appearances from Cities Aviv and Slowdive's Rachel Goswell.\n\nSomersault is the first record Beach Fossils have put out in four years. With years of experimentation, the record had a different process than their past efforts. \"We just kind of let loose and let the songs take their own course,\" Dustin said. \"Different sounds, different textures come up. Over the last four years we probably made five full records that we would trash and then pull from later until the songs told us that they were ready.\"\n\nPayseur says that his inspiration for this album didn't come from any musical source. Rather, it was all experiences, whether he had that experience himself or witnessed it firsthand. The writing process for this album could be described as internal. \"I guess we inspired ourselves more than anything, just look inside. The most important thing I think is to not look externally for anything, because the biggest downfall for people making stuff is trying to find inspiration or influences and then being like 'yeah I wanted to be like this,' whereas for us, we were just sitting in a room for hours on end just messing around until something came out,\" Payseur said.\n\nBeach Fossils are coming to San Diego July 20th and are pumped for their show. \"It's gonna be a little mix of everything, some old and new, and some stuff we've never put out before,\" Payseur said. \"There are gonna be some surprises in there for sure.\"\n\nLike what you hear?
