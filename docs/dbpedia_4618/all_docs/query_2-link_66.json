        "text": "Maybe there’s a car, there\n\nDriving away from here\n\nTaking all the ghosts\n\nThe hurt…\n\nSlowdive, the iconic shoegaze ensemble, has pulled back the curtain on their eagerly awaited fifth studio album, Everything Is Alive, set for release on September 1st via Dead Oceans. The band has also introduced their latest single, “Kisses”, and revealed an ambitious tour for 2023\n\nThe inception of Everything Is Alive dates back to the fall of 2020, with the band embarking on a two-year recording journey across the UK. The album, produced by lead guitarist-songwriter Neil Halstead, was partially crafted in his home studio, with six of the eight tracks benefiting from the expertise of Grammy-winning engineer Shawn Everett.\n\nThe record is a heartfelt tribute to Rachel Goswell’s mother and drummer Simon Scott’s father, both of whom passed away in 2020. Goswell shared in a statement, “There were some profound shifts for some of us personally,” alluding to processing the life-changing losses. The album is a sonic exploration of life and hope, reflecting the deep personal transitions experienced by the band members. Despite the undercurrent of melancholy, the album is a beacon of hope, encapsulating an overarching sense of thankfulness. Goswell further added, “Those crossroads are reflected in the many-layered emotional tenor of Slowdive’s music; ‘Everything Is Alive’ is heavy with experience, but each note is poised, wise, and necessarily pitched to hope. Its unique alchemy subtly embodies both sadness and gratitude, groundedness and uplift.”\n\nNeil Halstead also shared his thoughts on the album: “It wouldn’t feel right to make a really dark record right now. The album is quite eclectic emotionally, but it does feel hopeful.”\n\nThe music video for the album’s lead single, “Kisses,” is a dreamlike journey through Naples. It features a young protagonist driving around the city with various passengers on the back of their scooter, with the backdrop of notable landmarks such as the Castel Sant’Elmo, football murals, and Mt Vesuvius.\n\nOn filming “Kisses,” the director Noel Paul stated: “If this video evokes emotion, it’s largely due to our excellent cast. In particular Charlie and Claudia, two courageous and beautiful souls who threw themselves into their roles and set a tone of fearless vulnerability.\n\nWatch the video for “Kisses” below:\n\nIn addition to her work with Slowdive, Rachel Goswell has been part of the supergroup Beachy Head. This collective, formed by members of Slowdive, Flaming Lips, The Soft Cavalry, and Casket Girls, includes Goswell and Christian Savill from Slowdive, Matt Duckworth from Flaming Lips, Ryan Graveface from Casket Girls, and Steve Clarke from The Soft Cavalry. Their eponymous debut album was launched in April 2021 via Graveface’s own record label.\n\nGoswell also recently joined forces with Drab Majesty for their EP, An Object in Motion, contributing her ethereal vocals to the first single, “Vanity.”\n\nSlowdive’s 2023 tour is set to span the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and North America, including a debut performance at Glastonbury. The North American leg of the tour will kick off in Toronto on September 23rd, with performances in cities like New York, Chicago, DC, Philadelphia, San Franciso, and Seattle, before wrapping up in Los Angeles on October 14th.\n\nTickets for all dates go on sale Friday, June 23 at 10 AM local time.
