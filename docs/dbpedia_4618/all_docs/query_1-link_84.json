        "text": "Out of all of the social media trends I participated in, blogging was one i thought I’d never do. I was never really outspoken with these sort of things, and i mainly browse on other social media platforms. To me, blogging is the online version of a journal. A person can pour out all of their personal thoughts in a post, tell you how their day has been, or talk about a niche hobby. Since I spend a lot of time browsing music online, I decided that I would should about a certain genre.\n\nInitially I felt nervous about my writing being open to the public, but I got more used to it after the first few posts. If I decide to continue this, I might write more opinionated posts. I have many ideas, but I’m still not sure how to clearly communicate them to an audience. Writing this blog gave me much insight into my own writing skills and how to utilize them. I feel that this is like a first step that is helping me get prepared for an online media career.\n\nBut of course, I did run into a few obstacles. Using Twitter and other social media to promote my blog didn’t add much to my audience. I still feel that most people are turned off by certain promotions or advertisements, so they tend to avoid it. My biggest challenge is openly promoting myself on social media. This blog has helped in that area, and I feel that I’m better connected to the online world because of it. Writing has always been a struggle for me, and I always thought I wouldn’t need it as a skill. But, now I realize how important it is in this field, and I hope to be proficient with it in the future.\n\nMany of the current shoegaze bands initially started off as a different genre. They usually stay within the genre of Indie Rock, so it isn’t always a complete change. This is true of some older acts like My Bloody Valentine or Ride, who started as punk or brit-rock, but they focused on being shoegaze sooner than most of the current bands. One of these new bands who have evolved from their emo/hardcore style is Title Fight. Since their change they’ve received more attention.\n\nThey were first formed in 2003 by Jamie Rhoden and twin brothers Ben and Ned Russin. They did a lot of touring and recordings in their first few years. Eventually they were able to make all their EPs into a compilation entitled “The Last Thing You Forget.” At this time they toured with other emo/alternative bands like New Found Glory. Soon they were signed to a label and were able to put out full length albums.\n\nSlowly they started evolving into their current sound. Many of their songs used more guitar melodies rather than a heavy guitar crunch. The single Head in the Ceiling Fan is a good example of this new style. Their collaborations with Whirr also helped influence their sound on their newest album Hyperview. While still including elements of hardcore in some of their songs, Rose of Sharon for example, they focused on a melodic shoegaze style.\n\nTitle Fight are now among many of the current successful shoegaze acts. The members have displayed a lot of talent by being able to evolve from their previous genre, and will continue to put out good material\n\nPopular YouTuber Anthony Fantano runs his own channel called The Needle Drop. On it are mainly reviews of albums, but he also reviews some songs, talks about the music business or covers live music events. Mainly the content is more focused on the independent artists of each genre, but he does cover a lot of well known artists as well. At the start of each of his videos he refers to himself as “The Internet’s Busiest Music Nerd”. I think he’s earned that title.\n\nWhat I like about his reviews is the time and attention he puts into it. He doesn’t just start reviewing the album, rather he first tells us about the artist and their previous albums. Fantano does his best to explain what the artist was trying to achieve on the song or album and interprets the message pretty well. While most listeners casually listen to an album, he studies it and points out some things that might have gone unnoticed. Personally, this is where I get a lot of new music recommendations, so I do my best to keep up with it.\n\nWhat’s special about him is that he reviews all types of albums and isn’t biased towards any genre. He does his best to be all round, but occasionally some people don’t agree with his ratings. He is fully aware of that, and rather than ignore it, he communicates with the YouTube community really well. Also, he occasionally incorporates some humor in his videos. This is usually through his “roommate” Cal Chuchesta, or the subtle editing in the video.\n\nOverall, Anthony Fantano is a music reviewer that knows exactly what he’s talking about in his videos, and provides great insight about the music.\n\nOne of the other recent shoegaze acts worth hearing about is Whirr. They were formed in 2010 by Nick Bassett and have had a changing lineup throughout their career. Since their formation they have released many EPs and albums. Unlike other recent acts, their inspiration seems to come from other bands like My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive. Just like these bands, they have a soft-spoken female vocalist, focus more on melodies, and implement many effects with their guitars.\n\nBut the band is also infamous for other reasons. Those more familiar with the band and it’s fanbase know that Whirr aren’t the best at responding well to others on social media. Many suspect the band leader and guitarist, Nick Bassett, to be the cause of most of the negative comments. Also, they are known to be pretty rude to people in charge of venues as well as many others in person. Many people have left their live shows disappointed because of this and their recklessness on stage.\n\nWhile they aren’t the most pleasant people to be around, they still are making their mark in the shoegaze scene. It is evident through the many other bands they collaborate with. Bassett is also the bassist for Nothing and was part of the black-metal band, Deafheaven. Recently, Nothing and Whirr released an EP together with a few songs; Ease being their standout track. Whirr are currently on tour for their recent album, Sway, and have no plans on stopping\n\nFor the next few posts, I want to focus on some more recent acts. The first one being a band simply named Nothing. They’ve only released one album and a few EPs but they’ve caught the attention of many people. Nothing are quite different from the other shoegaze acts since they have a more intense hard rock sound. This provides a good platform for the dark lyrics written by founding member Dominic Palermo, whose had his share of problems.\n\nPrior to forming Nothing, Palermo was in a hardcore punk band called Horror Show. The band would have violent outbursts and one of these instances resulted in drug-addicted Palermo stabbing another man during a brawl. He spent 2 years in prison for aggravated assault and attempted murder. After his release. he spent 4 years to himself sort of lost. In an interview with Noisey.com, Palmero is quoted saying that “… I didn’t know what else to do with my life, what would make me want to wake up every day. I really struggled with that for like four years and, not to sound dramatic or anything, but I thought about blowing my brains out every day.” (Noisey, 2014). Wanting to move away from the punk scene, he formed Nothing.\n\nWhat makes this band unique in the shoegaze genre, is their use of darker lyrics and straight edge rock. The music video for “Bent Nail” is one the prime examples of Palermo’s vision for the band. This helps with the reputation they’ve received for their intense live shows as well. Palermo has said that they like to play as loud as possible with 130 decibels being the loudest they’ve reached. On some occasions, guitarist Brandon Setta has smashed his guitar onstage.\n\nEven though they only have one album out, Nothing are one of the current bands dominating the shoegaze genre. The fact that they were formed in Philadelphia, as opposed to the other acts formed in England or Ireland, shows how far the influence of the genre has reached. Nothing’s success will only increase that influence.\n\nAnother band out of England, Ride were one of the more melodic bands when compared to My Bloody Valentine. In fact, they were very popular among mainstream audiences and had the potential to become another great British rock band. But, their direction in where to take there music led to their breakup in 1996.\n\nRide were formed in Oxford, England in 1988 while the members were in college. The lineup of the group- Andy Bell, Mark Gardener, Laurence Colbert and Steve Queralt- never changed. They played their first gigs around their college campuses and were able to secure a record deal for one of their performances. At this time they were able to get a decent size fan base and critical fame through their first EPs. Their first album, Nowhere, was loved by fans and critics as well.\n\nThey were pretty famous in the U.K. during this time, and demand was high for another release. Their second album, Going Blank Again, was another success but didn’t bring them the international fame they hoped for. A rift was starting to grow in the band. They decided to change their musical direction for the next two albums. Instead of the britpop melodies distinct in their songs, they took a more direct psychedelic rock approach. This change didn’t go over well with fans and critics, and soon afterwards the band split up\n\nEven though the band rejected their shoegaze title, their music is a massive influence in the genre. Nowhere, is another essential listen for any fan of the genre and includes some of their greatest songs. “Vapour Trail“, which is their biggest hit, shows off the best features of the band’s overall sound. Unlike Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine, they don’t have a female vocalist and the lyrics are a lot clearer in most songs. Also, Bell and Gardener’s style of singing was similar to other britpop artists. These qualities made the band more radio friendly and able to acheive some mainstream success. But they did have some songs that featured intense instrumentals such as “Dreams Burn Down“, and “Leave Them All Behind“\n\nSince their breakup, the members have all stayed in the music industry except for Queralt. Bell played bass for the band Oasis in 1999 and formed Beady Eye with the other member’s after Oasis’ split. Gardener and Colbert formed The Animalhouse but the band didn’t last long. Gardener then went solo. Finally in 2014, the band announced a reunion and a tour in North America and Europe. This proves that they are still one of the giants in the shoegaze genre.\n\nFormed in 1989 by childhood friends Neil Halstead (vocals,guitar) and Rachel Goswell(vocals,guitar), Slowdive became one of the most influential acts of the shoegaze genre. Like most shoegaze bands, they were under appreciated and active only for a few years. After adding members Christian Savill (guitar), Nick Chaplin(bass) and Simon Scott(drums), they started recording music.They caught enough attention to secure a record deal and in 1991 released their first album Just for a Day. They gained a small following but were bashed by critics. Shoegaze was beginning to die out due to the rise of grunge and britpop.\n\nIt was around this time that many popular shoegaze and indie rock bands, including Slowdive, would hang out and perform at each other’s shows. The press referred to these groups of bands as “The Scene That Celebrates Itself.” Even though they enjoyed being part of this group, Slowdive struggled to release their next album. After disagreements with their label and constant criticism from the press, they were finally able to release their sophomore album, Souvlaki, two years later. Today, Souvlaki, is one of the most distinguished albums of the genre, but at the time it received negative reviews from many critics. To make matters worse, their U.S. record label failed to promote their album, and refused to fund their tour. Slowdive were able to support themselves for a two week tour in the U.S.\n\nBy the time they were recording their third album, the only members remaining were Halstead and Goswell. The album, mainly the work of Halstead, was vastly different from their usual work and more ambient. Soon after the release, they were dropped from their label and formed another group\n\nSince their split, many of the members have still remained active in the music industry. Halstead and Goswell formed the group Mojave 3 then went on to release their own solo work. Savill started the group Monster Movie with an old friend while Scott dabbled in numerous projects. Noticing the comeback of shoegaze, Slowdive reunited with all the members in 2014. They played numerous festivals, toured again and announced plans for a new album.\n\nThey are considered one of the essential shoegaze bands. With Souvlaki, they left behind many songs that are a cornerstone to the genre (e.g. Alison; Souvlaki Space Station). They still have more to bring with their upcoming album, and will have an even larger fan base to support them\n\nFormed in the early ’80s in Ireland, My Bloody Valentine were one of the first bands to popularize the “shoegaze” genre and are arguably the most popular to come out of it. The band went through numerous lineup changes before the two founding members, Kevin Shields and Colm O Ciosoig, settled on Bilinda Butcher and Debbie Googe. The changing lineup and having not yet found their own sound caused them to struggle with releasing an album. In 1988 they released their first album, Isn’t Anything. This album was very influential on the genre, but they still hadn’t peaked yet. Their second album, Loveless, gave My Bloody Valentine legendary status among shoegaze fanatics and was praised by many critics. However, they never became popular among other mainstream artists and split up soon after. They didn’t release anything until their reunion in 2013.\n\nThe unique sound\n\nMy Bloody Valentine were shoegaze pioneers in many ways.Their music featured many characteristics of the genre: hushed vocals, distorted guitars and dreamy melodies. In a way, guitarist and vocalist Kevin Shields is seen as more of a pioneer because of his unique guitar style and his production on Loveless. Their influence goes farther than just shoegaze bands, but many rockstars as well. Billy Corgan, Courtney Love and The Edge have cited them as influences in their music at one point in their career. Corgan even admitted that he tried to replicate the sound off of the album Loveless. “Sometimes” and “To Here Knows When” are perfect examples of Shield’s craft work. Some of Shield’s work is even featured on the soundtrack to the movie Lost In Translation.\n\nWhat are they up to now?\n\nThey reunited in 2008 and played many music festivals. The released their first album in 12 years in 2013 titled m b v. Critics and fans loved it, and the band continued touring. There has been talk about a fourth album but nothing has been confirmed yet."
