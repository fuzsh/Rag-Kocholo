        "text": "The band delivers an execution at a reinvention of a sonically superb album.\n\nBy: Jaelyn Gonzalez\n\n“Everything is Alive” is a dream pop album, not a shoegaze one. It’s a hard pill for new fans to swallow, expecting “Souvlaki” two. A comeback was on the horizon for Slowdive. In 2020, Gen Z fled to TikTok and created a new community of music lovers exchanging their favorite records. This community on the platform would launch a new generation of listeners to discover the late 80s and early 90s subgenre of rock, commonly known as shoegaze. The indulgence of fuzzy guitars and dissonant bass has yet to fade away. The online space of shoegaze resurgence offered Slowdive a new lease on life, in addition to a crowd of 17-year-olds at their concerts. Previously the band had re-entered music again after rumors of calling it quits in 2014 and performing at the Pitchfork Music Festival, but their new record proves they are here to stay once more. Coming from the depths of other old goth, obscure and shoegaze bands that were left in the grave.\n\nIn accompaniment to the genre revival, a call for music from new fans set the stage for the band’s latest comeback since their self-titled 2017 LP. “Everything is Alive,” is their fifth full-length LP and is one of their most adventurous projects. Instead of leaning heavily on distorted guitars, the band turns to a brighter sound with synthesizers. Frontman Neil Halstead has always had an appreciation for this sound, as he has previously contacted Brian Eno to record synths for “Souvlaki.” Electronic and ambient sound is essential to the record while remaining to their roots with mixed-in dense guitars.\n\nThe first three records from Slowdive are known as the glue to their distinctive sound and contribution to shoegaze, which contains buried vocals behind melodic guitar distortion. In 2017, the band made a return to music after a 22-year hiatus. “Slowdive” delved slightly farther away from their typical craft as they leaned into the use of synths as a driving sound for a great transition into their latest project.\n\nInstead of returning to old demos of reverb-drenched sound to satisfy fans, the band ditches what they were known for and grows away from their past in an unanticipated way.\n\nThe album is an immersive and levitative journey. The tracks guide the listener through a listening experience filled with somber voices from vocalists and guitarists, Halstead and Rachel Goswell. “Shanty” starts the album off and begins with electronic echoes interrupted by a powerful punch of the shoegaze classic processed guitar. Its blend of electronic synths and blurred rhythms is representative of the entire project. The track also prepares the listener for the overarching theme of grief, which runs present throughout the record. “Time runs on once more / Another ghost is born.”\n\nIn 2020, the band originally put the recording of the album at a halt. Goswell’s mother and drummer, Simon Scott’s father passed away putting music aside for the two. Before “Souvlaki” Halstead and Goswell previously dated, yet their friendship never faded as he attended Goswell’s mother’s funeral. He wrote the album in dedication to his bandmates’ familial passing and it is written all over the records.\n\n“The Slab” closes the LP. An instrumental soaked in mumbly incomprehensible vocals, it is a sonic battle between thick guitar riffs and luscious minor scaled keys. While the band credits the song as their darkest, it’s arguable that “Skin in the Game” is more haunting, with its eerie repetition of the chorus layered in between acoustic guitars.\n\nCombining Halstead’s heartbreaking and emotional lyrics with Goswell’s supporting velvet voice, the two make a perfect duo for a tranquil listen. “Everything is Alive’s” production and mixing, by Halstead and producer Shawn Everett, is Slowdive’s best yet. Its instrumentation is smooth, making it best listened to on over-the-ear headphones. Everett has worked on projects for Alvvays, Belle and Sebastian and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, it is clear the LP’s dreamy psychedelic sound comes from other artists rather than the band’s.\n\nWhile it’s a new approach and an interesting exploration for the band itself, it does not bring anything new to the table in the realm of dream pop. Its inclusion of synths and softly sung vocals can closely be compared to many artists who have taken inspiration from the band. With a long-awaited return comes pressure to release a five-star record. “Everything is Alive” is Slowdive’s big step in returning to music, pushing aside their commonly associated sound. Yet instead of reimagining their sound, their inspirations have seeped too far into their work.\n\nIn conversation with the Recording Academy, Halstead admitted his personal listening to Aphex Twin and Warp Records bands was a large part of the recording process for the record. “[Everything is Alive] was really enjoyable because it kind of brought those electronic things into Slowdive world as well,” Halstead told the Recording Academy. With his lean towards electronic music and Slowdive’s guitar-centered core, the new release is a Frankenstein’s monster mashup of dream pop unoriginality.\n\nHowever, this release ensures they can produce more than a shoegaze reiteration and not fall to the demands of fans. The album reaches into the depths of electronica and ambient music, proving they are not afraid to step out of their comfort zone. It marks a huge step forward in the evolution of their discography, giving potential for a tasteful blend of something uniquely Slowdive in their future projects.\n\nSlowdive lives on in their latest release. The band is not stepping anywhere near retirement, as they are stacked with soldout shows and will be touring into 2024. As their fanbase evolves, so does the band. But for the band to flourish beyond their shoegaze legacy, Halstead needs to realize that he cannot reproduce Warp Records’ Aphex Twin and Oneohtrix Point Never and call them Slowdive."
