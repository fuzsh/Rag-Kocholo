The band's debut double 7-inch single was recorded by Kramer and released by Hi-Fidelity Recordings in 1994. After listening to it, Kranky contacted the band.\n\nThe band's first album, Bowery Electric, was recorded by Michael Deming at Studio .45 in Hartford, Connecticut and released by Kranky in 1995. The album was included by Andrew Earles in his 2014 book, Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981–1996. In 2016, Pitchfork named it the 36th best shoegaze album of all time."
